Introduction\nThe recent literature on international trade documents (and emphasizes) sizable trade-\nrelated differences across firms. Firms not only vary strongly by trade activity; typically, only\na small fraction of a countrys firms engage in exports and imports. More notably, firms that\nexport also differ significantly from non-exporters in (almost) all other relevant firm\ncharacteristics. Exporters are larger in size, more productive and pay higher wages than non-\nexporters; see, for instance, Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2007). Exporters also tend\nto produce a wider range of products and are less likely to cease operations; see Bernard and\nIn this short paper, we examine the difference between exporters and non-exporters\nalong another dimension: access to (and use of) bank credit. The dramatic decline in world\ntrade in 2008/2009 after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers (`Great Trade Collapse') has led\nto a growing interest in the procedures of trade financing, highlighting the role of financial\nfactors for trade activity. We aim to describe the association between finance and cross-border\ntrade in further detail, analyzing empirically to what extent the provision of bank loans is\naffected by firm-specific characteristics, including the firm's export status.\nOur analysis is based on a novel data set of bank-firm relationships in Germany.\nSpecifically, we match information from the German credit register (which covers the credit\nexposure of banks towards individual borrowers) with detailed balance sheet data on the\nborrower. The resulting, newly-compiled data set has, for our purposes, three key advantages.\nFirst, the database covers all large-scale credit relationships in Germany. Since lenders are\nrequired by law to report their credit exposure with a borrower exceeding a certain threshold\nto the German central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, our results are derived from a full\nsample of bank-firm credit linkages. Second, due to the pair-wise structure of the credit\nregister, the lender is properly identified. This structure allows controlling directly for bank-\nspecific features of credit provision such as differences in lending policies or profitability.\nThird, the balance sheet data covers, along with other firm data, information on the\nborrowers' foreign sales. Based on this data, we compute measures of a firm's (aggregate)\nexport activity.\nPreviewing our results, we find large exporter premia in bank lending. Our estimates\nindicate, for instance, that German exporting firms take, on average, 15 percent larger loans\nthan non-exporters, holding constant for other factors. To the extent that we properly control\nfor firm-specific determinants of access to external finance, these findings appear to provide\nbroad support for the trade finance channel between banks and exporters which suggests that\nexports are particularly sensitive to financial conditions. Amiti and Weinstein (2011), for\ninstance, emphasize that international trade involves higher default risk and higher working\ncapital requirements; exporters rarely properly evaluate default risk (turning instead to banks\nto provide insurance) and need more working-capital financing because of long delivery\ntimes.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the relevant\nliterature. In Section 3, we describe our empirical approach and the data, followed by a\npresentation of the empirical results. Finally, Section 4 provides a brief conclusion.\nII. Literature\nA (by now) sizable empirical literature identifies economically large and statistically\nsignificant differences between firms that export and firms selling exclusively on the domestic\nmarket. Many studies re-examine and strongly confirm this finding for a broad range of\nindicators of firm activity. There are also a large number of papers which aim to replicate this\nobservation for various countries, obtaining similarly affirmative results.1\nFor Germany, our country of interest, Bernard and Wagner (1997) document sizable\nand robust exporter premia for various plant characteristics. Based on a regional sample of\nfirms, they find that German exporting plants are more productive than non-exporters (with a\npremium of about 20 percent), have a higher capital intensity (by about 12 percent) and invest\nmore per worker (about 8 percent) than non-exporters; firms also employ more workers and\npay higher wages, with the premia varying by the type of worker. Holding constant for the\ncharacteristics of both the worker and the workplace, Schank, Schnabel and Wagner (2007)\nestimate that employees working in a plant with an export-sales ratio of 60 percent earn about\n1-2 percent more than similar employees in otherwise identical non-exporting plants. Finally,\nexport activity is also associated with measures of firm performance and firm success; Fryges\nand Wagner (2010) argue that exporting has a positive causal effect on profitability.\n1 Given that relevant firm-level data sets often differ in design across countries and are not\nalways readily accessible, few surveys seek to combine and summarize findings for various\ncountries; see, for instance, Mayer and Ottaviano (2007).\nThe role of financial variables for firm export behavior, by contrast, was initially\nemphasized primarily in theory. Building on the assumption that entry into foreign markets\ninvolves sunk costs, it is hypothesized that only firms with (access to) sufficient financial\nresources are able to start exporting. Chaney (2005) and Manova (2006), among others,\nformalize this idea, adding liquidity constraints to a standard heterogeneous firm model of\ninternational trade. Specifically, Chaney (2005, p. 5) argues that \"one [additional] dimension\nof heterogeneity along which exporters may differ from non-exporters is their ability to access\nfinancial intermediaries\", with less financially constrained firms being more likely to export.\nThe few empirical studies which aim to analyze the exporter premium for financial\nvariables typically find evidence in support of this hypothesis.2 However, since these studies\noften examine measures of the financial health of firms, such as firm liquidity, they seem to\nprovide only limited insights. For one thing, financial health, which is the most\ncomprehensive outcome measure of a firm's business policies, depends on many factors,\nincluding the decision to export itself. In fact, given the seemingly robust finding of\nsignificant differences in financial positions between exporters and non-exporters, the\nempirical analysis mainly focuses on causality, with mixed results. Analyzing a panel of\nBritish manufacturing firms over the period from 1993 to 2003, Greenaway, Guariglia, and\nKneller (2007) find that participation in export markets improves firms' financial health,\nwhile export starters display low liquidity. In contrast, Bellone, Musso, Nesta, and Schiavo\n(2010) find for a sample of French firms that exporters are already more liquid before entry,\nwith no further growth in financial variables relative to non-exporters in the following years.\nMore notably, measures of financial health are, at best, only a very imperfect proxy for\nthe variable of interest, access to external finance. For instance, a large stock of liquidity may\nreflect weak fundamentals rather than easy credit when firms are forced to hoard cash in times\nof financial constraints. As a result, the association between a firm's financial position and its\naccess to external financial funds seems to be generally ambiguous.\n2 A related literature in finance explores the capital structure decisions of firms, including the\nuse of external finance. For instance, examining a broad range of financing sources, Beck,\nDemirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2008) find that exporters tend to use more bank, leasing\nand supplier finance.\nThe special importance of external financial conditions for international trade\nactivities has been further highlighted in recent research on the `Great Trade Collapse'. The\nsharp decline in world trade in 2008/2009 is widely attributed to a drop in the provision of\ntrade finance by troubled financial intermediaries in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\nAhn, Amiti and Weinstein (2011) provide suggestive evidence, showing that the prices of\nseaborne-shipped goods, which are likely to be most dependent on trade credit, rose relative\nto the prices of goods sent by alternative modes of transportation. In similar fashion, Chor and\nManova (2012) document that countries with tighter credit markets exported less to the\nUnited States between September 2008 and August 2009, with the effect being especially\npronounced in sectors that require extensive external financing; see also Levchenko, Lewis,\nfind that the health of banks providing finance affects the growth in their client's exports\nrelative to its domestic sales.\nIII. Methodology and Data\nIn this paper, we aim to describe trade-related bank-firm relationships in more detail,\nfocusing in particular on the role of external finance for foreign sales. To identify possible\ndifferences in bank lending between exporters and non-exporters, we run regressions of the\nfollowing general form:\n(1) ln(Loanijkt\n)=  +  Exporterijt\n+ {  Xijt\n} + j\n+ t\n+ ijkt\nwhere Loanijkt\nis a measure of the credit exposure of bank k to firm i in industry j at time t,\nExporter is a measure of the firm's export activity, typically a dummy variable that takes the\nvalue of one if a firm has positive foreign sales (and zero otherwise), X covers a number of\nother firm characteristics (such as firm size),  and  are comprehensive sets of industry-\nspecific and time fixed effects, respectively, and  is the residual. Bernard, Jensen, Redding,\nand Schott (2007) use a similar approach to quantify exporter premia for other firm\ncharacteristics. As potentially relevant firm-specific variables for lending other than export\nstatus, we consider total sales, the number of employees, firm age, equity, foreign equity\nholdings, and whether the firm operates more than one plant. In addition, we experiment with\n3 For a contrasting view, see Bricongne, Fontagn\u00e9, Gaulier, Taglioni, and Vicard (2012). They\nfind, for a sample of French firms, that the financial crisis particularly hit firms in sectors\nhighly dependent on external finance, but conclude that the overall impact of credit\nconstraints on trade has been limited.\nthe inclusion of controls for firm location (federal state), the legal form of the firm, and the\nlending entity (bank). In our most demanding specification, we also use a comprehensive set\nof firm-specific fixed effects, thereby identifying the association between exports and lending\nfrom the variation in a firm's export status over time only.\nWe estimate equation (1) for bank-firm relationships in Germany, using quarterly data\nfor the period from 2005 to 2010. Our main source of data is the Deutsche Bundesbank's\ncredit register, named MiMiK, which contains information on all loans in excess of\n1.5 million euro granted by banks in Germany to firms worldwide. According to section 14 of\nthe German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz), banking institutions based in Germany are\nrequired to report their large exposures on a quarterly basis to allow the central bank to\nmonitor indebtedness; Schmieder (2006) provides a more detailed description of the\ndatabase.4 For each bank-firm relationship, the size and composition of the credit exposure\n(both on and off balance sheet) is provided, along with the name and address of the borrower\nas well as information on the lender.\nWe match loans with (annual) balance sheet data for the borrower from the corporate\nbalance sheets database of the Bundesbank, Ustan. The Bundesbank has collected, mainly for\nrefinancing purposes, extensive data on individual firms; the data are primarily extracted from\nannual accounts and financial statements submitted directly to the Bundesbank.5 Most notably\nfor our purposes, the database includes information on firms' export sales. Since the firm\nidentifiers differ between the two data sets, we match the data using a propensity score\nmatching algorithm, based on the name, the legal form and the location of the firm; see\nGoldbach and Nitsch (2013) for a more detailed description.\nTable 1 presents a brief overview of the data. In total, the Bundesbank's credit register\ncontains information on almost 1 million bank-firm pairs for the 24 quarters from 2005\nthrough 2010. For the large majority of the more than 14,800 loan-taking firms in the data set,\nwe also have complementary information on firm characteristics. In fact, we lose only about\n4 The German credit register was initially established in 1934, but reporting requirements\nwere occasionally adjusted to take account of inflation (raising the regulatory reporting\nthreshold) and structural changes in banking and financing techniques (e.g., adding credit\nderivatives to the definition of credit exposure).\n5 As St\u00f6ss (2001, p. 132) notes, these accounts are used for an examination of the\ncreditworthiness of parties to bills of exchange, since the Bundesbank Act requires the central\nbank to purchase bills \"backed by parties known to be solvent\".\n20 percent of the total number of (loan-quarter) observations through our matching procedure.\nMost notably, the matched data set does not differ significantly from the full credit register\ndata. For instance, the pair-wise credit exposure consistently averages at about 8 million euro.\nIV. Empirical Results\nFirm-specific information on large-scale loans by financing entity allows identifying\ndirectly the exporter premium in external finance. Benchmark estimation results are tabulated\nin Table 2. Each of the four columns reports the results of a different regression specification\nof equation (1), gradually increasing the number of additional explanatory variables to control\nfor differences in bank lending across firms.\nColumn (1) presents our default specification, in which we regress the log value of a\nbanks credit exposure to a firm on the export status of the borrower, holding constant for\ndifferences in lending relationships across (two-digit) industries and over time. The estimated\n() coefficient on the exporter dummy takes a significantly positive sign; the effect is also\neconomically large. According to our most parsimonious specification of equation (1), the\npoint estimate of  indicates that being an exporter tends to increase the credit exposure of a\nfirm by, on average, about 37 percent.\nThe next two columns show that about one-half of this effect is explained by firm\ncharacteristics other than export participation. In column (2), we control for size, age and\nstructure of the firm; in column (3), we additionally include fixed effects for the location and\nlegal form of the firm as well as lender-specific fixed effects. While the estimated \ncoefficients on the auxiliary variables take on the expected sign and are statistically and\neconomically significant, with larger and older firms taking more loans whereas multi-plant\nfirms and firms with access to foreign capital often use alternative sources of financing, the\nestimated  coefficient falls to about 0.15. These estimates suggest that exporters take about\n15 percent larger loans than non-exporters, holding other things constant.\nIn a final perturbation, we add to our specification a comprehensive set of firm-\nspecific fixed effects. Since this estimator takes account of all time-invariant firm\ncharacteristics and, thus, exploits only variations in factors over time, the association between\nexternal finance and trade is exclusively identified from switches in a firm's trade activities.\nUnfortunately, there are only few changes in the exporter status of firms in our sample; we\nexport stops (representing, in total, a fraction of 5.4 percent of our sample of about 800,000\nobservations).6 Still, the estimate of  remains positive and significant, again indicating that\nforeign sales are positively associated with bank lending. Specifically, the point estimate of\n0.02 implies that a financial institution tends to increase its credit exposure to a firm that\nbecomes an exporter by about 2 percentage points.\nWe perform extensive sensitivity analyses. Table 3 provides some of our robustness\nchecks and extensions. Again, there are four columns (on the left of the table) which contain\nparameter estimates; each of these columns tabulates the result of a different regression\nspecification, corresponding exactly to those of Table 2. To economize on space, however, we\nonly report estimates for the coefficient of interest ; that is, the specifications now also vary\nacross rows such that each cell of the table presents the result of a separate regression. The\ncolumn on the right of the table reports the number of observations since sample sizes differ.\nWe begin by varying our measure of export activity, replacing the plain export dummy\nwith the log share of foreign sales in total sales.7 We also experiment with using employment\ninstead of sales as our proxy for firm size or adding a separate control for firm productivity.8\nReassuringly, none of these perturbations has a qualitative effect on our results. Next, we split\nthe sample into two sub-periods, showing that the exporter premium has become smaller since\nthe beginning of the financial crisis. However, while the magnitude of the decline depends on\nthe exact regression specification, our finding that exporters take out significantly larger loans\nthan otherwise identical non-exporters remains consistently unchanged. We also split our\nsample along other lines. For instance, examining results by credit exposure indicates that\ncensoring should not be an issue; the point estimates of  turn out to be particularly strong for\nfirms with low credit exposure. Similarly, when we divide the total credit exposure into direct\ncredit debt and off-balance sheet liabilities the results become slightly less robust; our\nestimates indicate that the exporter premium in bank lending is mainly due to an exporting\n6 Since all firm-specific information, including data on exporting, is only available at annual\nfrequency, we cannot identify the exact quarter of the switch in exporting status. Therefore,\nwe attribute the switch to all (four) quarters in the year of the change.\n7 Before taking logs, we increase foreign sales by the value of one to deal with the problem of\nzero entries.\n8 We compute a productivity measure, the ratio of value added to the number of employees,\nfrom accessible firm-level information in the Bundesbank's corporate balance sheet statistics;\nfirm's access to a wider range of financing instruments. The specification seems to become\neven more demanding, with mixed estimation results, when we use credit shares instead of\ncredit values as dependent variable.9 Finally, our benchmark estimates remain essentially\nunaffected when we use lagged explanatory variables or allow for time-variant industry and\nbank fixed effects.10\nDespite their overall consistency, our estimation results are still subject to limitations.\nFor instance, a potential issue might be omitted variables bias. The estimated exporter\npremium may be mainly due to characteristics of the exporting firm (some of which are\npotentially unobserved) rather than the nature of the export activities, a critique that appears to\nbe generally less relevant for our specification which includes firm fixed effects. Further, loan\nsize may be affected by the frequency of transactions for which we have, unfortunately, no\ndata. An obvious issue, open for future research, is to establish causality.\nV. Conclusions\nThe sudden stand-still in world trade after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in\nSeptember 2008 has led to growing interest in procedures of trade finance. A growing body of\nevidence seems to suggest that export-related activities of firms indeed depend\ndisproportionately on finance from external sources.\nThis paper contributes to this recent literature by examining differences in bank\nlending between exporters and non-exporters.

As a result, policy\nmeasures and interventions that improve the strength of the domestic banking and financial\nsector and, thereby, help avoiding financial market disruptions are expected to have a\nmeasurable impact on a country's international trade.\nReferences:\nAhn, JaeBin, Mary Amiti, and David E.
