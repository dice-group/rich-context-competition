These are important components of 21st-cen-\ntury skills (Griffin, McGaw, & Care, 2012). The National\nResearch Council (NRC; 2012) prominently identified non-\ncognitive characteristics (interpersonal and intrapersonal\nskills) as core developmental characteristics to be successful\nin life and work. The NRC argued that cognitive, intraper-\nsonal, and interpersonal skills can be taught and learned and\ncontribute to successful adult outcomes. These skills also are\nfound in the Common Core State Standards (Kyllonen, 2012)\nandincludefactorsthatshapeschoolperformance(Farrington\net al., 2012), college and career readiness and success\n(Dymnicki, Sambolt, & Kidron, 2013), and more generally,\npositive youth development and resilience (Benson, Scales,\nThere exist many attempts to develop measures of such\nskills in diverse populations and at different ages or develop-\nmental stages, with significant measurement challenges\narena for measurement, rigorous measurement quality evalu-\nation addressing the validity of score interpretations has been\nlimited. \"Validity refers to the degree to which evidence and\ntheory support the interpretations of test scores for proposed\nuses of tests\" (American Educational Research Association\n[AERA], American Psychological Association [APA], &\nNational Council on Measurement in Education [NCME],\n2014, p. 11).

The investigation of MI is now a standard\ncomponent of test development for most large-scale tests,\nparticularly those with high stakes (AERA, APA, & NCME,\nThere is increasing interest in the assessment of noncog-\nnitive characteristics, 21st-century skills, and developmental\nassets among youth. These measures should be held to the\nsame standards as educational and psychological tests if we\nare to defend their use to inform practice and policy.\nDevelopers of such measures must provide evidence of\ninvariance across relevant subgroups, including race and eth-\nnicity, language status, gender identity, and developmental\nstages--those groups for which the assessments are intended\nto be used (Millsap, 2010; Widaman, Ferrer, & Conger,\n2010). The point is to identify subgroups that may have char-\nacteristics that potentially influence responses in construct-\nirrelevant ways. This is consistent with the standard approach\nto validation, based on a well-articulated interpretation and\nIn this article, MI is evaluated in a relatively new and flex-\nible approach, through explanatory item response models\n(EIRMs). The study employs a measure of developmental\nassets administered to a large sample of middle and high\nschools'Latino students with different English language pro-\nficiencies. This provides a rich context for the evaluation of\nMI and the exposition of these principles in the growing\narena of social-emotional measurement.\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate MI in measures of\nSupport and Positive Identity. To present a coherent model of\nthe process, the contexts of research in Latino youth devel-\nopment is presented in terms of the role of culture and lan-\nguage status; a review of positive youth development and\ndevelopmental assets places the target measures in perspec-\ntive; the evaluation of MI is reviewed; EIRMs to support this\nwork are described; the methods and results of the study are\nsummarized; and implications for measuring Support and\nPositive Identity are discussed. This serves two purposes, the\nstudy of MI of measures of Support and Positive Identity and\nthe exposition of the evaluation of MI for measures of social-\nemotional characteristics for instructional purposes. In addi-\ntion, as we have discovered, the evaluation of MI across\ndevelopmental stages provides us with a deeper look into the\ndevelopmental nature of developmental assets.\nLatinos and Youth Development\nU.S. Latinos are not only the largest ethnic minority group in\nare disproportionately young with 36% younger than the age\nlikely to face higher levels of developmental challenges\nincluding high poverty levels, residing in disadvantaged\nneighborhoods, attending low-quality schools, involvement\nin risky behaviors, and being raised by parents with low aca-\ndemic attainment and limited English skills (Eamon &\nMulder, 2005; Kuperminc, Wilkins, Roche, & Alvarez-\nJimenez, 2009). Latinos are diverse, based on generational\nstatus, country of origin, English language proficiency, age\nof immigration, residency status, and race (A. K. Fuligni &\nPerreira, 2009). Measures that assess development among\nLatino youth must consider the broad diversity of Latino\nyouth populations to yield meaningful interpretations\n(Knight, Roosa, Calder\u00f3n-Tena, & Gonzales, 2009). In addi-\ntion, Latinos have been underrepresented and not equitably\ntreated in developmental research, where studies that\nincluded Latino youth were deficit oriented and often\nunguided by a theoretical framework (Rodriguez & Morrobel,\n2004). The need to address positive Latino youth develop-\nment remains.\nOne of the core characteristics of Latino youth relevant\nto developmental considerations, particularly for school-\nage youth, is language and English language status\n(Rodriguez & Morrobel, 2004). In this study, the psychoso-\ncial role that English language acquisition plays among\nLatino youth is examined regarding its potential influence\non the measurement of developmental assets. This recog-\nnizes an important characteristic contributing to the diver-\nsity of Latino youth, and one that may influence\nmeasurement in construct-irrelevant ways. English lan-\nguage fluency plays an integral part in the identity forma-\ntion of Latino youth. Language skills determine how\neffectively they can interact within the spheres of English-\nspeaking peers, teachers, and communities. Similarly, the\namount of time in which Latino youth have contact with\nmainstream American culture affects how Latino youth\ndevelop identity and experience support in multiple con-\ntexts (Fuligni & Perreira, 2009). This multicontext influ-\nence on Latino youth is also recognized as a source of\ncultural resilience, as youth traverse and manage the multi-\nlingual and multicultural spheres of family, peers, teachers\nand school, and community (Taylor & Want, 2000).\nThe Role of Language\nSecond language acquisition has traditionally been studied in\nterms of cognitive development and educational contexts,\nbut to a lesser extent regarding how it relates to social-emo-\ntional development. Language development plays an integral\npart in Latino youth development in the United States. In\n2012, 74% of the Latino population reported to speak Spanish\nat home (U.S. Census Bureau, 2014). Maintaining a native\nlanguage has been associated with retention of family values\nand cultural traditions as well as a protective factor against\ninvolvement in risky behaviors (i.e., an asset) among Latino\nyouth (Kuperminc et al., 2009; Perez, Espinoza, Ramos,\nBulut et al. 3\nLimited English fluency has been associated with devel-\nopmental risk factors including low socioeconomic status,\nresiding in disadvantaged neighborhoods, low educational\nattainment by parents, and a perceived sense of stigmatiza-\ntion for not speaking English (Dawson & Williams, 2008;\nGarcia & Scribner, 2009). As Latino youth become more\nfluent in English, they also begin to interact more with the\nmainstream American culture and therefore be influenced\nby it (South, Crowder, & Chavez, 2005). Similarly, family\nresponsibilities often increase for Latino youth as they\nbegin to serve as mediators between their home culture and\nthe surrounding communities when they act as family\ninterpreters and translators (Morales, & Hanson, 2005;\nWeisskirch, 2005). The context facing recent immigrants is\nalso challenging as it takes on average between 3 and 5\nyears to develop English-speaking fluency (Hakuta, Butler,\n& Witt, 2000). This makes English language status relevant\nin the study of Latino youth development and thus impor-\ntant in the evaluation of MI of developmental asset mea-\nsures. However, language is just one component of culture\nand identity.\nLatino Cultural Context\nNot only are Latino youth underrepresented in develop-\nmental research, but also researchers who study Latino\nyouth often treat Latinos as a homogeneous group, employ\nexploratory methods without theoretical grounding, and\nare largely deficit oriented (Rodriguez & Morrobel, 2004).\nA deficit orientation puts an emphasis on negative attri-\nbutes and focuses on interventions addressing develop-\nmental risk factors. It is from the imbalance of assets and\ndeficits that many of the problems faced by Latino youths\noriginate (Peck, Roeser, Zarrett, & Eccles, 2008;\nRodriguez, & Morrobel, 2004). A call to refocus the orien-\ntation of Latino youth development research to a positive\nyouth development approach has been raised by research-\ners (Kuperminc et al., 2009; Rodriguez, Morrobel, &\ntive youth development approach (Benson et al., 2006;\nLerner, Almerigi, Theokas, & Lerner, 2005) aims to iden-\ntify more appropriate environments where Latino youth\ncan embrace their qualities and have a greater opportunity\nto enhance their abilities to thrive and succeed (Rodriguez\nTwo developmental assets are of particular interest,\nSupport and Positive Identity, because of the critical role\nthey play in Latino youth development. Also, both constructs\nhave strong developmental characteristics. Support is an\nexternal (interpersonal) asset as it characterizes engagement\nwith others, whereas positive identity is an internal (intraper-\nsonal) asset as it is manifested within the individual (Benson\nSupport\nThe benefits of support received from family, community, and\nschool among Latino youth have been well documented.\nParental support has been associated with academic educational\noutcomes (Eamon & Mulder, 2005; Green, Rhodes, Hirsch,\nPhinney, & Dennis, 2006), as a protective factor against involve-\nment in risky behaviors (Costello, Swendsen, Rose, & Dierker,\nBelgrave, & Zea, 1996; Antrop-Gonzales, Velez, & Garrett,\n2008). Similar benefits have been found when experiencing a\nsupporting environment in the community (Faircloth, & Hamm,\nUma\u00f1a-Taylor, & Bamaca, 2006), and peers and other unrelated\nadults (Scales, Benson, & Mannes, 2006). However, research\non the dynamics of Latino youth perceptions of support across\ndevelopmental stages, particularly during adolescence, has been\nscarce (Grau, Azmitia, & Quattlebaum, 2009). There is some\nevidence that family support, community support, and school\nclimate affect academic performance differently for 6th-, 9th-,\nand 12th-grade MexicanAmerican students, indicating a poten-\ntial interaction with developmental stage (Cabrera, Rodriguez,\nPalma, & Stanke, 2014). Support plays an important role in\nLatino youth development, but little is known about the role\ndevelopment plays in the perception of support.\nPositive Identity\nIdentity development is a core milestone during adolescence\n(Erikson, 1968). For Latino youth, identity development\nmust be considered with respect to ethnic identity develop-\nment and consideration to the cultural and environmental\ncontexts that influence identity formation. Ethnic identity\nhas been considered part of the overall concept of personal\nidentity (Phinney, 1996) and, for Latino youth, it is regarded\nwith more centrality (Quintana & Scull, 2009). Identity\ndevelopment is complex. U.S. Latino youth must navigate\nbetween their culture of origin and the dominant or new cul-\nture where they reside as they work to form their identity\n(Quintana & Scull, 2009). At the same time, ethnic identity is\nhighly influenced by language skills (often, unbalanced\nbilingual skills), age, interpersonal relationships with parents\nand peers (Phinney, Romero, Nava, & Huang, 2001; Quintana\n& Scull, 2009), and the broader society where youth develop\ntheir identity in the context of stigmatization and numerous\nadversities (Quintana & Scull, 2009), not to mention racism\nand anti-immigrant sentiments.\nPositive ethnic identity has been associated with factors\nof well-being in Latino youth, including self-esteem (Uma\u00f1a-\nTaylor, Gonzales-Backen, & Guimond, 2009), academic\nachievement (A. J. Fuligni, Witkow, & Garcia, 2005; Ong\net al., 2006), and positive attitudes toward one's social/cul-\ntural group and other groups (Whitehead, Ainsworth, Wittig,\n4 SAGE Open\n& Gadino, 2009). However, Latino youth are more likely to\nlive in disadvantaged neighborhoods with greater exposure\nto poverty, gangs, and crime, with limited support for devel-\noping a positive identity (Santrock, 2011). Like support, the\nrole development plays in one's sense of positive identity is\nless understood, compared with the role positive identity\nplays in youth development.\nEvaluation of MI\nMI can be examined in many different ways. The challenge\nis to identify potential sources of measurement interference\nor differential functioning and hopefully address them. In\nthis context, MI is based on evidence that a measure can be\nconsistently interpreted across relevant subgroups, that there\nis no distortion in scores that is construct irrelevant and inter-\nferes with score interpretation. Score distortion can be caused\nby construct-irrelevant responses to items in a measure or\ntest, including person characteristics that are associated with\nexperiences or opportunities to learn (which may result in\ndifferential item functioning [DIF]; see, for example, Albano\n& Rodriguez, 2013), or shifts in item performance over time\npossibly due to changes in local culture or demographics,\nchanges in curriculum or teaching methods, or major local or\nworld tragedies or relevant events (which may result in item\nparameter drift [IPD]; Goldstein, 1983).\nMI analysis is a class of methods appropriate for assess-\ning invariance, which addresses the question of whether the\ninstrument is measuring the same trait across all subgroups\nin a population or over measurement conditions. MI analysis\nis often implemented at the scale level via factor analytic\nmethods (e.g., multigroup confirmatory factor analysis).\nAlthough a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis of sub-\ngroups may reveal equivalent factorial structures, item-level\ndistortions can still be present (Zumbo, & Koh, 2005).\nTherefore, it is essential to conduct item-level analyses for\nevaluating item-level invariance among subgroups and to\nidentify items that may affect score interpretation (Zumbo,\n2007). In the context of Latino youth development with\ndiverse Latino communities in terms of language status, we\nface multiple potential sources of measurement inconsis-\ntency, including differences in language status (DIF based on\nELL status) and differences in developmental stages (IPD\nbased on grade in school).\nThe IPD (Goldstein, 1983) is one approach to detecting\nmeasurement inconsistency at the item level. This study\ndemonstrates IPD as an item-level method for investigating\nMI of youth development measures with a large Latino stu-\ndent sample, given English language learner (ELL) status, as\ncurrently receiving ELL services, received but exited ELL\nservices, or never received ELL services, and grade levels as\nan indicator of developmental stages. EIRM (De Boeck &\nWilson, 2004) was used to define various IPD models for\ndetecting item-functioning variance as a result of ELL status\nand grade level. The findings of the study are discussed\nregarding invariance of youth development measures and\npossible implications for the substantive study of youth\ndevelopment itself.\nConsistent score interpretation is a potential challenge\ngiven the nature of development and changes in response\npatterns to items in measures of youth characteristics. In\nstandard measurement literature, violations of MI are thought\nof as construct irrelevant. As a concrete example, consider\nthe measurement of school violence as perceived by stu-\ndents. We may measure perceptions of school violence\nthrough a number of items addressing various aspects of\ndirect, indirect, physical, and relational violent behavior and\nincidents occurring in schools. Over time, because of the\nincreasing level of attention to high-profile weapon use in a\nfew cases across the United States and the dominance of\nzero-tolerance school policies, an item about the presence of\nweapons in school may function differently over time (i.e.,\nIPD). As students are exposed to extreme examples of\nweapon use in schools, minor weapon infractions (e.g., car-\nrying pocket knives or box cutters, etc.) appear to be less\nimportant or relevant or severe. If responses to the items in a\nmeasure of school violence should be a function of perceived\nschool violence (the trait being measured), then we should be\nable to predict an individual's responses to each item given\nhis or her overall level of perceived school violence.\nTechnically speaking, once we condition on overall level of\nperceived school violence, we might find that the item about\nthe presence of weapons in schools functions differently over\ntime. Even under the same level of perceived school vio-\nlence, students would be less likely to indicate that the pres-\nence of weapons in schools is a problem. If the presence of\nweapons is an important indicator of school violence, and\nthis aspect shifts in its functioning over time, the construct\ndefinition of school violence is changing, whether we change\nour interpretation of the scores or not--and unless we assess\nthe presence of IPD, we have no reason to consider changes\nin score interpretation.\nGoldstein (1983) introduced IPD as a way to measure\nchanges over time in academic achievement exams. Item\nresponse theory (IRT) models are commonly used to investi-\ngate IPD under various contexts. An example includes a lin-\near drift model of item location parameters (a measure of\nitem difficulty) using a time-dependent item response model,\nwhere researchers argued that IPD can occur because of\nchanges in curricular emphasis and be described as a func-\ntion of time, that time-dependent item response models can\ndescribe data to maintain scales over long periods of assess-\nment reporting (Bock, Muraki, & Pfeiffenberger, 1988).\nThere are many examples in the literature of IPD analy-\nses. Researchers have investigated such tests as the Armed\nServices Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) and found lit-\ntle evidence of IPD, perhaps because aptitude is less variable\nthan achievement over time (Chan, Drasgow, & Sawin, 1999).\nIn an examination of measures of information literacy and\nglobal issues, items on the information literacy measureshowed\na greater magnitude of IPD, possibly resulting from rapid\nchanges in the field (DeMars, 2004). In a recent examination\nBulut et al. 5\nof IPD in a measure of school climate, a few items became\neasier to endorse over time conditioned on overall school cli-\nmate, suggesting that students may have become desensi-\ntized on some issues related to school climate as time passed,\npotentially changing the interpretation of school climate\nFrom the body of research on IPD and exploratory studies\ninvestigating sources of IPD, we find potentially useful\nresults. First, the construct being measured actually may\nchange over time. Changes in the construct can indicate\nunintentional shifts in content over time (as items in a mea-\nsure are replaced, reworded, or eliminated). Similarly, the\nconstruct as perceived by an individual may change due to\nreal changes in cognitive abilities or social/emotional devel-\nopment. In addition, a construct as generally understood and\ndefined by relevant populations may change over time\nbecause of the impact of individual-life or world events.\nAssessing MI\nIn this study, MI is evaluated using EIRM. EIRM is a special\ncase of IRT in the context of generalized linear mixed models\n(GLMMs) where it is possible to specify between-group dif-\nferences in the latent constructs being measured (De Boeck\nwhich describes the probability of responding in a particular\nway to an item as a function of the difference between the\nability or trait level of person j and the location of item i on\nthe trait continuum (commonly called item difficulty for\nachievement test items). This EIRM extension of the model\ncan be written as a GLMM. The notation for this is a modi-\nfied version of the hierarchical generalized linear modeling\nframework (Kamata, 2001). The Level-1 portion of the\nRasch model, the item response level, can be written as a\nlogistic regression model in terms of the log-odds of a cor-\nrect response:\nlog\nP\nP\nX\nij\nij\nij j j ij\nkj kij j qj qij\nq\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n = = + +\n+ = +\n=\n  \n  \n\nk\nk\n ,\nwhere ij\nis the log-odds (probability of correct response\ndivided by probability of incorrect response) of person j\nendorsing the dichotomous item i; 0j\nis an intercept term and\nthrough kj\nare coefficients associated with indicators X\nthrough X\nkij\nthat indicate items. The indicators Xqij\nrepresent\nthe qth dummy variable for person j, and are coded as nega-\ntive one when q = i and zero when q  i. Because indicator\ncoding uses negative one and zero, the item parameters can\nbe interpreted as item location, the trait level associated with\na 50% chance of endorsing the item. Level 2 of the model,\nthe person-level, is\n \n \n \nj j j j\nj\nkj k\nu u N\n= ( )\n=\n=\nwhere  ,\n,\nwhere the intercept term, u0j\n, is a random effect for persons.\nCoefficients \nthrough kj\nare the fixed item locations (dif-\nficulties) \nthrough \n. Note that there is no fixed effect,\n\n, included in the intercept term because the model does not\nconsider a reference item when estimating the remaining\nitems. When Level 1 and Level 2 are combined, the log-odds\nmodel is then\n \nij j q qij\nq\nk\nu X\n= +\n=\n\n.\nBecause the indicator variables are coded as negative one\nwhen the response is associated with a particular item and\nzeros for all other items, the linear portion of the model can\nbe simplified to \nij\n= u\n- \n, the difference between the\nperson effect and the item location; another representation of\nthe Rasch model. The Rasch model assumes that items pos-\nsess the characteristic of local independence, meaning that\nafter taking into account the parameters of the items and the\npersons, the responses to items are independent of one\nanother. This implies that a single trait is responsible for each\nitem response. In addition, MI is essential for ensuring gen-\neralizability across populations and test occasions (Rupp &\nZumbo, 2006), supporting score interpretation and use; when\nMI does not hold, something other than the intended single\ntrait is responsible for item responses.\nEIRM and Study Design\nAs described earlier, we evaluated the role of two student\ncharacteristics, ELL status conceptualized as a potential\nsource of DIF and grade level conceptualized as a potential\nsource of parameter drift across developmental stages. This\ndesign employed student characteristics as features of the\nmeasurement model.\nThis study was conducted based on data gathered in an\nurban district in the state of Texas. Latino students who par-\nticipated in the assessment are included in this secondary\ndata analysis, including students in 6th through 12th grade.\nIn addition, students were classified as (a) receiving ELL ser-\nvices, (b) received but exited ELL services, or (c) never\nreceived and/or never were eligible for ELL services. To\nreceive ELL services, students report a home language other\nthan English, are evaluated to determine their level of English\nproficiency, and receive a Broad English Ability score of 4 or\nlower on the Woodcock\u00adMu\u00f1oz Language Survey\u00adRevised.\nLatino students who have exited ELL services have satisfied\n6 SAGE Open\ntheir ELL learning goals, performed at the advanced level (or\nlower with additional evidence of proficiency) on the Oregon\nEnglish Language Proficiency Assessment, and have the\nability to participate meaningfully in the general education\nprogram. Latino students who are not ELL students are those\nfor whom English is their primary language.\nThe full explanatory model, including ELL status (two\ndummy variables to capture the three groups), grade level,\nand their interaction, is as follows:\n \n  \n\nj j j j\nj j\nj\nu u N\nExitedELL\nELL\n= ( )\n= + ( ) +\n( ) +\nwhere  ,\n\n \n\n \nGrade\nExitedELL Grade ELL Grade\nj\nj j\nkj k\n( ) +\n\u00d7\n( ) + \u00d7\n( )\n= +\n+ ( ) +\n( ) + ( ) + \u00d7\n \n \nk j k\nj k j k\nExitedELL\nELL Grade ExitedELL Grade\n(\n( ) +\n\u00d7\n( )\nj\nk j\nELL Grade\nIn this model, u0j\nis the trait level for person j; q0\nis the\nlocation for item q (1 to k) for a student belonging to the non-\nELL group (the reference group) in sixth grade (Grade 6 is\ncoded as zero, Grade 7 as 1, Grade 8 as 2, etc.); \nis the item\nlocation difference for exited-ELL students; q2\nis the item\nlocation difference for ELL students; \nis the linear devia-\ntion in item location across grades for non-ELL students; \nis the linear deviation difference in item location across\ngrades for exited-ELL students; and \nis the linear deviation\ndifference in item location across grades for ELL students.\nVariations in EIRM Specification\nThe EIRM, as a form of a GLMM, allows for a more flexible\nspecification of the student characteristics in the model. As\ndescribed above, ELL status is a factor (a categorical vari-\nable as in an ANOVA) and grade is a continuous linear pre-\ndictor (a continuous variable as in regression). In the EIRM,\ngrade is evaluated to the extent that its effect is linear across\nGrades 6 to 12, conditioned on other variables in the model.\nIn other words, holding overall level of the trait constant\n(e.g., level of perceived Support), it evaluates the extent to\nwhich items shift in location across grades in a linear man-\nner. This is referred to as the multigroup linear IPD model,\nwhere parameter drift may occur over grade or conceptually,\ndevelopmental stages.\nAlternatively, grade can be specified as a categorical vari-\nable, where the effect of each grade on item location is esti-\nmated independently. This is referred to here as the Grade \u00d7\nGroup factor model, where ELL status and grade are both\nconsidered factors (as in ANOVA) with interaction terms\nbetween each ELL status group and each grade level. The\nmain advantage of the EIRM compared with other popular\nmethods for testing MI (e.g., multigroup confirmatory factor\nanalysis) is that the EIRM allows for the evaluation of IPD\nover grade levels not only linearly but also independently for\neach grade level (i.e., nonlinear drift).\nMethod\nMeasures\nA questionnaire measuring developmental assets was admin-\nistered to students in 6th through 12th grade in an English\nform and a bilingual form presenting English and Spanish\nversions on opposite pages. Students receiving ELL services\nwere given the bilingual form and other students were given\nthe option of which form to use. The Spanish version of the\nquestions on the bilingual form were initially translated by\none of the authors of this article and reviewed by a second\nauthor. The bilingual form was also reviewed by school per-\nsonnel in the participating district with Spanish language\nbackgrounds and a small number of issues were resolved\nthrough consensus. In part, the use of a bilingual form (pre-\nsenting English and Spanish on opposite pages) was intended\nto avoid the influence of inappropriate translation. The trans-\nlating authors and the school personnel reviewing these\nforms were of Mexican descent, similar to the vast majority\nof Latino students in the district.\nThe questionnaire included the Developmental Assets\nProfile (DAP; Search Institute, 2005), which measures eight\nassets based on students'experiences at the self, family, peer,\nschool, and community levels. Data from two assets of inter-\nest, Positive Identity and Support, were used for the analysis.\nThe Positive Identity measure consists of six rating-scale\nitems, including issues related to feeling good about one's\nself and future, dealing with disappointment, and having a\nsense of purpose. The Support measure consists of seven\nrating-scale items, including issues related to having parents\nwho are encouraging and available to talk, having others in\nthe community who are supportive, and being in a school\nthat is supportive and encouraging.\nAlthough the original items are on a 4-point scale, they\nwere dichotomized to reduce the complexity of linear drift\nanalysis in the EIRM, for illustration purposes only. Options\n\"not at all or rarely\" and \"somewhat or sometimes\" were\ncoded as 0, and \"very often\" and \"extremely or almost\nalways\" were coded as 1. In this way, item responses were\nthen on a scale indicating more (1) or less (0) of the con-\nstruct, as represented by each item. However, this is not rec-\nommended for general practice, but is indicated to simply\nfacilitate ease of analysis and interpretation for our purposes\nhere. Using the 4-point rating scale in the factor model evalu-\nating nonlinear MI, for example, would produce more than\n500 coefficients for the Support measure alone (three thresh-\nold coefficients are needed to describe the locations of the 4\nrating-scale points, across 168 coefficients from the factor\nBulut et al. 7\nmodel as described below). This would be cumbersome for\nthe interpretation purposes here.\nTo use the EIRM framework in estimating person and\nitem parameters (as in the Rasch model), the measures should\nmeet the general assumptions of IRT, such as unidimension-\nality. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted in\nMplus 6 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2010) to confirm the unidimen-\nsional latent structure of the Positive Identity and Support\nmeasures. One challenge is that if MI does not hold, the CFA\nwill indicate problems regarding the fit of a unidimensional\nmodel. Goodness-of-fit criteria, including root mean square\nerror of approximation (RMSEA), Tucker\u00adLewis index\n(TLI), and comparative fit index (CFI), were used to evaluate\nmodel-data fit of the unidimensional CFA model for the two\nmeasures. CFI and TLI are incremental fit indices that range\nbetween 0.0 and 1.0 with values closer to 1.0 indicating good\nfit. RMSEA is an absolute fit index that is independent of\nsample size and thus performs well as an indicator of practi-\ncal fit. For CFA models, Hu and Bentler (1999) suggested\nthat for categorical data, RMSEA < .06, TLI > .90, and CFI\n> .90 indicate good fit. The CFA results indicated that\nable levels of model-data fit on at least one criterion each;\nhowever, the RMSEA results were problematic. This is\nmostly an indicator that the simple unidimensional Rasch\nmodel may not be an appropriate approach to model item\nresponses--which is consistent with the findings of mea-\nsurement inconsistency reported below. The correlation\nbetween the two assets was .65, indicating a moderate rela-\ntion between the two constructs (42% shared variance).\nSample Characteristics\nAs the focus of interest, the responses from 24,322 Latino\nstudents were analyzed. The counts of Latino students by\ngrade and ELL status are reported in Table 1. The sample con-\nsisted of 36% ELL students, 53% exited-ELL students, and\n11% non-ELL students. Approximately 50% were female,\n5.9% were receiving special education services, 87.5% were\nidentified by the district with a low socioeconomic status\nindicator, and 89% participated in free or reduced lunch.\nResearch Questions\nWe investigated one primary research question regarding\nMI: Does item functioning vary by grade, English language\nproficiency (language status), or their interaction? If drift\ndoes occur across grades as a function of ELL status, the\ninteractions will be significant, requiring consideration of\nparameter variability across grade by ELL status. Other pos-\nsibilities include the presence of drift that is constant across\nELL status and the presence of DIF between ELL status\ngroups. We simultaneously investigated MI as a function of\nboth DIF by language status and IPD across grade level.\nThis led to substantive issues regarding the role of lan-\nguage status and developmental stage in the measurement of\nthese two developmental assets. Important questions are\naddressed in the \"Discussion\" section regarding the impact\nof measurement variance on score interpretation for different\nsubgroups of Latino students and regarding the developmen-\ntal aspects of the measures themselves.\nData Analysis\nIn an exploratory study preceding this analysis (Stanke,\nPalma, Bulut, & Rodriguez, 2013), four models were fit to\nthe data for Positive Identity and Support: (a) the Rasch\nmodel assuming MI, (b) a model to detect IPD treating ELL\ngroups as invariant (no DIF), (c) a model to detect multiple-\ngroup IPD allowing for separate linear drift parameters for\nthe three ELL groups (DIF \u00d7 IPD), and (d) a model treating\ngrade as a factor that interacts with ELL status that allows\nparameter drift across grades to be nonlinear and differ by\nsubgroup (Grade \u00d7 Group factor model). The models were fit\nto the Positive Identity and Support measures using the glmer\nfunction from the package lme4 (Bates, Maechler, & Bolker,\n\u00d7 Group factor model, appeared to fit best on a number of\ndimensions and resulted in item parameter estimates for each\ngrade-by-group combination (Stanke et al., 2013). In any\ncase, it was clear that MI was not a tenable assumption.\nBased on these preliminary results, consistency of score\ninterpretation of Positive Identity and Support is in part a\nfunction of Latino subgroup defined by language status, and\ndevelopment may not be represented on these two constructs\nin ways that are invariant; the measurement of Positive\nIdentity and Support may vary in some items as a function of\nboth grade level and language status. The results of the mul-\ntiple-group linear IPD model are briefly presented and the\nlinearity of the IPD is evaluated based on a graphical review\nof the Grade \u00d7 Group factor model. The R code for estimat-\ning the Rasch and the multiple-group linear IPD models are\nprovided in Appendix A.\nTable 1.

Item locations, q0\nthrough q2\n, were not tested for significance.\nELL = English language learner.\nResults\nTo begin with, the Rasch model item locations and item fit\nstatistics for Support and Positive Identity are reported in\nTables 2 and 3. In the EIRM, the person parameter is nor-\nmally distributed with a mean of zero; items are then located\nrelative to the scale defined by person location. The infit and\noutfit fit indices indicate the extent to which the data matched\nthe Rasch model (Bond & Fox, 2001), where values between\n0.75 and 1.3 indicate adequate item fit (Smith, Schumacker,\n& Bush, 1998). Based on these suggested cutoff values, there\nis lack of adequate item fit for some items in both Support\nand Positive Identity, signaling that item difficulties may not\nbe similar across ELL status and grade level. In the subse-\nquent models, the items with adequate item fit were consid-\nered as anchor items in testing MI for Support and Positive\nIdentity.\nIt is challenging to review a large number of coefficients;\nhowever, the results for the multiple-group linear IPD model\nare presented as the basis for evaluating MI. For Positive\nIdentity, there are the person parameters (person trait level)\nand six items each with six coefficients; similarly for Support,\nthere are seven items each with six coefficients. All coeffi-\ncients are in the logit metric, due to the Rasch parameteriza-\ntion of the model.\nTable 4 contains the 36-item coefficients for the multiple-\ngroup linear IPD model for the Positive Identity measure.\nSimilarly, Table 5 contains the 42-item coefficients for the\nmultiple-group linear IPD model for the Support measure. A\nWald test assessed the statistical significance of each param-\neter being different from zero. The item locations, q0\nthrough\n\n, were not tested relative to a null hypothesis; their loca-\ntions are a function of the trait level required to be likely to\nendorse an item (whether that is different than zero is not of\ninterest).\nPositive Identity Multiple-Group Linear Drift\nRegarding the Positive Identity measure, 5 of the 18 drift\nparameters from the multiple-groups IPD model, \nthrough\n\n, had p values less than .01; 3 of 6 drift parameters for\nexited-ELL students, 1 of 6 for ELL students, and 1 of 6 for\nTable 2.

As only five coefficients were significant, the\nMI is not overwhelming--These effects will be reviewed\nitem by item below. However, as will be noted below, impor-\ntant differences were observed among Latino ELL sub-\ngroups, indicating the presence of DIF.\nSupport Multiple-Group Linear Drift\nRegarding the Support measure, 18 of the 21 drift parameters\nfrom the multiple-groups IPD model had p values less than\n.01. The significant drift estimates on the Support measure\nshowed an interesting phenomenon: as grade increased, the\nlikelihood of endorsing an item became more difficult--\nPositive coefficients indicate that endorsement requires\nhigher trait levels across grade level. For five of the seven\nitems, this effect was significant for all three ELL groups.\nThis phenomenon that occurs to some extent across all seven\nitems on the Support measure suggests that when item loca-\ntion parameters are treated as measurement invariant, 12th-\ngrade students' perceived level of Support is being\nunderestimated and 6th-grade students' perceived level of\nSupport is being overestimated. In addition, DIF was\nobserved as a function of Latino ELL subgroup.\nTo investigate the extent to which IPD is linear, the\nparameters for each item were plotted across grade level and\na visual analysis of the linear drift parameters was compared\nwith the grade-by-group factor model. Recall that the factor\nmodel employs dummy variables for each grade, consider-\ning grade to be categorical, and thus involves a much larger\nnumber of parameters. Because there are eight main effects\n(intercept, two ELL status dummy variables for the three\nELL groups, and five grade dummy variables for the six\ngrades) and 15 interaction effects (3 \u00d7 5) for each item, the\nnumber of coefficients is too large to report in tables (138\nfor Positive Identity and 161 for Support). To facilitate\ninterpretation of the results, graphic displays are presented\nfor each item, illustrating the linear and factor model results.\nFigures 1 to 6 display the item parameters for Positive\nIdentity; Figures 7 to 13 display the item parameters for\nSupport.\nTable 5.

Visual misfit (nonlinearity) occurred on three of\nthe six Positive Identity items (Figures 4 to 6). The items\nillustrating nonlinear drift were about dealing with disap-\npointments (Figure 4), dealing with things that are hard in\nlife (Figure 5), and thinking about one's purpose in life\n(Figure 6). Each graphic display is briefly interpreted to pro-\nvide more concrete meaning regarding the results.\nThe first Positive Identity item (Figure 1) concerns having\na sense of control in one's life. The drift parameters were\nnonsignificant for this item, as seen in Table 4 (\nto \n).\nNotice in Figure 1, the lines are relatively flat. The top solid\nline is for students receiving ELL services, the middle dashed\nline is for non-ELL students, and the bottom dotted line is for\nexited-ELL students. Also notice that the lines are relatively\naligned with the location of the markers, indicating the item\nlocation independently for each group across grades from the\nfactor model. The triangles (ELL) closely align to the top\nsolid line, the squares (non-ELL) closely align to the middle\ndashed line, and the diamonds (exited-ELL) closely align to\nTrait Level\nGrade\nLinear IPD Model\nExited-ELL\nELL\nGrade\u00d7Group Model\nExited-ELL\nELL\nFigure 2.

There appears to be no systematic\ndrift in item location (level of Positive Identity required to\nhave a sense of control) across grades.\nHowever, notice there are differences in the location of\nthese lines on the trait scale. This indicates significant DIF\ngiven ELL status. From Grade 6 to 12, the ELL student line\nis above those of the other two groups although the lines con-\nverge closer to Grade 12. To endorse this item regarding a\nsense of control in one's life, students receiving ELL services\nmust have a higher level of Positive Identity, indicated by the\nhigher location of the ELL line on the trait level (Figure 1)\nand the higher item location estimate (\n, Table 4). If a con-\nstant item location was used to estimate students' level of\nPositive Identity on this item, -2.06 as estimated by the\nRasch model (Table 2), ELL students' level of Positive\nIdentity would be underestimated and that of exited-ELL and\nnon-ELL students would be overestimated. Because endors-\ning this item requires a higher trait level for ELL students,\nendorsing the item should indicate a higher level of the trait\nfor those students. The person estimation (scoring) model\nestimates a trait level that is commensurate with the location\nof the item for those individuals endorsing the item and\nreporting to have a sense of control in their life (and similarly\nfor those who do not endorse the item, reporting to not have\na sense of control).

Moreover, developmental profiles of\ndifferences in students across grades will be distorted (more\non the meaning of this in the \"Discussion\" section).\nThe second and third Positive Identity items (Figures 2\nand 3) follow similar linear drift patterns. Item 2 (feeling\ngood about one's self) is characterized by significant linear\nparameter drift for ELL students (the solid line in Figure 2\nand the significant coefficient \nin Table 4), where the trait\nlevel required to be likely to endorse the item (item location)\ndecreases across Grades 6 to 12. Item 3 (feeling good about\none's future) is characterized by positive drift for exited-ELL\nand non-ELL students (Figure 3), where the item location\nincreases across grades.\nThe fourth, fifth, and sixth Positive Identity items (Figures\n4 to 6) are characterized by a common characteristic. First,\nthe items function similarly for the three ELL groups, but the\nIPD across grades does not appear to be linear. For all three\nitems, the item location increases from Grade 6 to 8, then\ndecreases to Grade 12. This suggests that for all three groups,\nto endorse an item requires an increasingly higher level of\nPositive Identity to Grade 8, then a decreasing level of\nPositive Identity to Grade 12.

The visual analysis showed that\nthe drift parameters for all three groups either followed linear\ndrift for an item or the absence of drift (only 3 of the 21\nparameters). Overall, linear parameter drift occurs in at least\none group for every item, and all three groups for five of the\nseven items.\nThe first Support item (Figure 7) concerns asking parents\nfor advice. The drift parameters were significant for exited-\nELL and non-ELL students for this item, and nonsignificant\nfor ELL students, as seen in Table 5 (\nto \n). Notice in\nFigure 7 that there is some variation around the linear drift\nparameters (as can be seen by the markers), but the solid line\n(ELL) is flat, the dotted line (exited-ELL) is slightly increas-\ning, and the dashed line (non-ELL) is more steeply increas-\ning. There is another more subtle pattern that is similar to the\npattern observed with the Positive Identity items: There is a\nslight increase for all groups from Grade 6 to 8 (or 9), then\neither a leveling off or slight decline to Grade 12. Again, this\nsuggests that to be willing to endorse the item about asking\nparents for advice (that the student does ask parents for\nadvice), it requires a higher level of Support overall for stu-\ndents in Grade 8 or 9 than other grades (more on the meaning\nof this in the \"Discussion\" section). However, the overall\ntrend appears more linear than not, particularly for the\nremaining items.\nacross grade, where all three ELL groups exhibit similar pat-\nterns, indicating no DIF across ELL subgroups. Item 5,\nregarding other adult support (Figure 11), illustrates linear\ndrift for non-ELL students only. For Items 6 and 7 (Figures\n12 and 13), all three groups are characterized by linear\nparameter drift, where the increase in item location is more\npronounced from Grades 6 to 8 and levels off to Grade 12.\nOverall, on the Support measure, there is much less DIF\nacross ELL subgroups, with the exception of Item 1 (Figure\n7; asking parents for advice), where ELL students are more\nwilling to endorse the item, holding overall Support con-\nstant. However, there is systematic, mostly linear, parameter\ndrift across Grades 6 to 12. This occurs at some level with\nevery item. The empirical item locations increase across\ngrades, suggesting that the construct as a whole shifts across\ngrades; students must have higher levels of Support overall\nto endorse each item (items are becoming more difficult to\nendorse across grades).\nDiscussion\nDespite the importance of MI in terms of the validity of score\ninterpretation and use, and the increasing attention to subgroup\nDIF (typically regarding gender or race), there is often a lack\nof concern for MI when an assessment is administered across\ndifferent age groups or developmental stages, particularly\nwith social/emotional domains. With increasing attention to\nmeeting the developmental needs of diverse youth, closing\nachievement gaps, reducing school suspensions, and increas-\ning graduation rates, assessments informing educators and\npolicy makers on social/emotional characteristics of youth\nmust be carefully examined to ensure appropriate, meaning-\nful, and useful score interpretation across subgroups and\ndevelopmental stages.\nThis study illustrates the use of EIRM to explore the eval-\nuation of MI in the form of DIF (between ELL subgroups)\nand IPD (employing grade level as an indicator of develop-\nmental stage). DIF analysis has a long history and is a routine\ncomponent in achievement test design and analysis\n(Livingston, 2006). IPD is typically used for evaluating MI\nacross multiple administrations of a test over time. In this\nstudy, MI is evaluated by accounting for DIF and IPD. A\nquestionnaire measuring developmental assets was adminis-\ntered to 6th- to 12th-grade students in an urban school dis-\ntrict with a large Latino student population, including\nstudents receiving ELL services, students who had exited\nELL services, and students who never received ELL ser-\nvices. Two assets, Positive Identity and Support, were evalu-\nated for MI across ELL status and grade level.\nThe results of the MI evaluation indicated that some items\nfunction differently across ELL status and grade. For Positive\nIdentity, the functioning of some items was influenced by\ngrade level differentially based on language status. For\nSupport, the functioning of nearly every item was influenced\nby grade level and, much less so, by language status. This\nhas implications for interpretation consistency.\nImplications for the Measurement of Positive\nIdentity\nThe Positive Identity measure shows some DIF and IPD\noverall. However, this varied across items and language\ngroups. Regarding DIF, for most items, ELL students needed\na higher level of Positive Identity to have a likelihood of\nendorsing each item, and for some items, this was particu-\nlarly true for 6th-grade ELL students, and less so for 12th-\ngrade ELL students. For ELL students to be likely to agree\nwith the components of Positive Identity (e.g., feeling in\ncontrol of their life, feeling good about their future, dealing\nwith life's challenges and having purpose in life), they\nneeded to have a higher level of Positive Identity overall.\nThese items, based on a constant item location (assuming the\nsame item parameter for everyone), are underestimating the\nPositive Identity of ELL students. This occurs when ELL stu-\ndents tend to endorse such items when they have higher lev-\nels of Positive Identity than non-ELL or exited-ELL students\nwho endorse the items with lower levels of Positive Identity.\nFor three items, the parameter drift was nonlinear. For\nitems about dealing with disappointments, dealing with hard\nthings in life, and thinking about one's purpose in life, the\ndrift appears to be systematic where the item location\nincreases from 6th to 8th grade and decreases from 9th to\n12th grades. This suggests that something triggers a shift in\nthe increasing item location in 9th grade, causing the item\nlocation to then decrease. A potential reason could be that\nthis is the time when students transition from middle to high\nschool toward more independence. Students who endorse the\nitems in later grades tend to have lower levels of Positive\nIdentity overall; it becomes easier to agree with items in later\ngrades and is most difficult to agree with items in 8th grade,\ncontrolling for overall Positive Identity.\nImplications for the Measurement of Support\nWith the measure of Support, parameter drift was uniformly\npositive, where item locations increased from Grade 6 to 12\nand mostly in a consistent way across ELL subgroups. All\ngroups require lower levels of perceived Support to agree\nwith items in the Support measure in earlier grades and\nhigher levels of perceived Support at later grades. Because of\nparameter drift, estimates of perceived Support levels of stu-\ndents across grades are biased, where Support for students in\nyounger grades is overestimated and Support in older grades\nis underestimated.\nThe questions remaining have to do with the impact of\ndevelopment on the measurement of developmental assets\nlike Positive Identity and Support, and the variation that is\nfound across Latino ELL subgroups. For Support (including\nfamily, school, and community support), it is more difficult\nto agree with statements about being supported for older stu-\ndents (requires an overall higher level of Support). So, inter-\npretation of perceived Support across grade levels is\ndistorted. When a 6th-grade student agrees with Support\nstatements, his or her overall level of Support is estimated\nbased on the location of the items in the measure. Because\nthe item locations are lower on the trait scale in the linear\ndrift model than in the constant-location (Rasch) model, their\nlevel of Support is overestimated. Similarly, because the item\nlocations are higher on the trait scale for 12th-grade students,\nusing a constant-location model underestimates Support for\nthem. As students move from middle school grades to high\nschool grades, Support becomes a slightly different construct\n(even with the same items), as the items become more diffi-\ncult to endorse, indicating that if the same items are being\nendorsed in older grades, this should indicate a higher level\nof perceived Support than when endorsed in younger grades.\nImplications for the Evaluation of MI\nMI can be evaluated at the item level through DIF and IPD\nanalyses. In this study, both DIF and a form of IPD (in cross-\nsectional data across grades) were applied in a single EIRM\nthat allows the detection of both linear and nonlinear drift in\nitem locations. Most items on the Positive Identity and Support\nmeasures examined here appeared to follow linear drift, but\nthere were some items where drift was not linear and depended\non language status (DIF). Methodologically, the use of IPD to\nmeasure drift across grade levels is not a common approach\nfor examining parameter drift when data collection is cross-\nsectional, but this concept could be applied easily to a variety\nof cross-sectional settings. Through the use of the EIRM\napproach, both DIF and IPD and their interaction (IPD across\ngrade levels depends on ELL status) can be evaluated suc-\ncinctly. In addition, the model can be made flexible enough to\nassess the extent to which drift is linear or nonlinear.\nLimitations and Future Research\nRecommendations\nThe Latino student sample was obtained from several second-\nary schools in a single district. Although the proposed inter-\npretations of IPD and DIF were not made for the purpose of\ngeneralizing across a broader Latino youth population, these\nspecific findings may be a function of unique school district\nor school effects. However, a larger point of this work is to\nreinforce the practice of MI evaluation in noncognitive mea-\nsures with diverse populations. The evaluation of MI should\nbecome common practice to defend interpretation and use of\nmeasures of social-emotional characteristics. Through wider\nexamination of these issues, potential school effects or com-\nmunity-specific effects can be identified as well.\nThere are several areas recommended for future research.\nFirst, future studies could be completed to examine the pat-\nterns of drift across developmental stages for ELL, exited-\nELL,andnon-ELLstudentsusingdifferentethnicpopulations\nand different noncognitive measures. This also suggests that\ndevelopmental stages be assessed more directly, rather than\nindirectly through grade level (as an indicator). This holds\npromise for contributing to developmental theory as well.\nGreater diversity in ethnic groups and measures will inform\nthe future of this work and its implications. Second, the\nresearch could be extended to include predictors that explain\nthe drift parameters. For instance, for items where drift var-\nies as a function of ELL status, other information like immi-\ngrant status (especially regarding Positive Identity) or time\nspent interacting with adults (especially regarding Support)\nmight serve explanatory functions. This type of study could\nbe easily completed in the EIRM framework, as additional\nvariables in the model. In this study, dichotomization of the\nitems did not lead to a great deal of information loss at the\nscale level (see Appendix B). However, the models can be\nextended to the polytomous cases, taking advantage of the\nfull information in more typical multipoint rating scales\n(although the researcher must be prepared to deal with hun-\ndreds of coefficients).\nThis study provides a unique example of examining MI of\nmeasures of developmental assets across developmental\nstages and language status. Although unconventional, given\nthe typical examination of parameter drift in longitudinal\ncontexts, the EIRM model provided a flexible and powerful\napproach to assessing IPD and DIF simultaneously. As the\neffects of IPD and DIF and their interactions were esti-\nmated simultaneously, it also provided a more direct way to\nevaluate MI in the target measures. This also provided for a\nunique opportunity to interpret developmentally relevant\nyouth characteristics (development as a major driver across\nthe grade levels and ELL status) and their effects on the\ninterpretation of scores. The purpose of this study was to\ninvestigate parameter invariance using a multiple-group\nlinear drift model, where the findings exposed implications\nfor interpreting youth development measures among ELL,\nnon-ELL, and exited-ELL students across developmental\nstages.\nAppendix A\nEstimating the Rasch and IPD Models Using the lme4 Package in R\nData Preparation\n### The data need to be reshaped from wide to long format\nlibrary(reshape2)\nlibrary(car)\nsupport.long = melt(support, id=c(\"id\", \"ELL\", \"grade\"), value.name = \"response\")\n### Rename \"variable\", the default name given by the melt function, to \"item\"\nsupport.long$item = support.long$variable\n### Recode grade as a linear variable.\n### Create an interaction term for the factor IPD model\nsupport.long$gr.ell.item = as.factor(paste(support.long$grade, support.long$item, support.long$ELL, sep = \"\"))\nModel Estimation\n### Activate the lme4 package\nlibrary(lme4)\n### Rasch model assuming measurement invariance across the groups\nrasch = glmer(response ~ -1 + item + (1|id), family = binomial, data = support.long)\n### Multiple-group linear IPD\nlinear.ipd = glmer(response ~ -1 + item:ELL + item:grade:ELL + (1|id), family = binomial, data = support.long)\n### Group x Grade Factor IPD\nfactor.ipd = glmer(response ~ -1 + gr.ell.item + (1|id), family = binomial, data = support.long)\nFigure B1.
