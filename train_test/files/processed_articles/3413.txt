Indeed, humankind may have a\nparticular need to be near nature, in its many forms, in order to remain psychologically\nhealthy: \"Cultural beliefs and practices that are inconsistent with our evolutionary\nconstitution and physical environments that stray too far from that in which we evolved\nMoreover, from an evolutionary perspective, some environments and characteristics\nof those environments may be more attractive to us than are others and this may influence,\namong other things, habitat selection (Heerwagen and Orians, 1993; Orians and\nHuman-natural environment relationships\nHeerwagen, 1992). It has been argued, for instance, that the African savannah may have\nbeen a primary site for mankind's early development, offering optimal features for safety,\nshelter and subsistence (Orians, 1998). Some research has shown savannah-like landscapes,\ndenoted by open woodland with little undergrowth, to be preferred to other natural\nenvironments such as deciduous and coniferous forests (Falk and Balling, 2010) partly as a\nfunction of the density of forests and woodlands (Herzog and Kutzli, 2002). As modern\nurban parks may be reminiscent of savanna-like landscapes (Orians and Heerwagen, 1992),\nthis may be part of the explanation for the positive relationship found between house prices\nand the proximity to and size of recreational parks (Poudyal, Hodges, and Merrett, 2009).\nPeoples motivations to visit inner-city parks may also be partly due to the social\ninteractions that take place there (Burgess, Harrison, and Limb, 1988; Krenichyn, 2004), a\nresearch finding which has found support in research focused on the use and benefits of\nevidence seems to suggest that the restorative potential of urban green spaces, particularly\nparks, may be due to the relative absence of people (Grahn and Stigsdotter, 2010).\nHowever, there also exists a small body of evidence that seems to suggest\npreferences for environments other than savanna-like landscapes, particularly for\nenvironments comprising bodies of water such as lakes and coastlines (Hartmann and\nApaolaza, 2010; Ogunseitan, 2005). In addition to the idea that environments containing\nbodies of water may be important sites for recreation, sustenance and socializing (Kaplan\nthat built environments containing water may evoke equal levels of preference as do green-\nonly environments (White, Smith, Humphryes, Pahl, Snelling, and Depledge, 2010).\nThere is also tentative evidence to suggest that positive reactions to the natural\nenvironment may be a fairly widespread, if not ubiquitous, phenomenon (Korpela, Hartig,\nKaiser, and Fuhrer, 2001; Newell, 1997). However, some research has indicated that\nnatural environments may evoke negative reactions (e.g., Staats, Gatersleben, and Hartig,\n1997). The aim of the present study was to discover the relationship between different\nnatural environments and different experiential feeling states. Furthermore, the pattern of\nthe relationships between experiential feeling states and the extent of experience of the\nnatural environment was also investigated, in order to gather evidence on how peoples\ndepth of experience corresponds with their affective responses to the natural environment.\nBiophilia\nThe biophilia hypothesis proposes that there is a fundamental human need to\naffiliate with life and life-like processes (e.g., Kahn, 1999). Biophilia has been described as\nour affective responses to nature and natural environments, each of which has its own\n\"peculiar meaning rooted in the distant genetic past\" (Wilson, 1984, p. 113). Biophilia has\nbeen loosely defined as \"an innate tendency to focus upon life and lifelike forms, and in\nsome instances to affiliate with them emotionally\" (Wilson, 2002, p. 134). Affective\nreactions to certain stimuli can undoubtedly be learned or be derived from conditioning,\nsuch as repeated exposure, but importantly allied to the biophilia hypothesis is the idea that\n\"specific sensory cues can elicit...innate affective or emotional meaning\" (Blascovich and\nMendes, 2000. p. 71). Much evidence is accumulating regarding the affective relationships\nthat may develop with the natural environment in its many forms (e.g., Ulrich, 1993). For\nHuman-natural environment relationships\ninstance, the giving and receiving of flowers can have both short and long term positive\neffects on mood, social interactions, emotions and memory (Haviland-Jones, Rossario,\nIt has been argued, however, that the genetic basis to any biophilic predisposition\nmay be a weak one, requiring the addition of learning, culture and experience of nature to\nactive engagement with the natural environment rather than passive observation may\nawaken the dormant genetic, psychological traits that enabled our ancestors to survive in\nthe natural environment, which have been subdued by relatively recent social and cultural\nforces. Similarly, Orr (1993) has suggested that the reintroduction of humans to nature,\nparticularly in terms of allowing children greater unsupervised play in natural\nenvironments, is both necessary to foster biophilia and for what it means to be human.\nIndeed, several perspectives have been prominent regarding the importance for\npsychological wellbeing of contact with the natural environment. Ulrichs functional-\nevolutionary perspective suggests an importance for humankind to be in contact with the\nnatural environment for a range of cognitive and affective functions, such as problem\nsolving, creativity and stress reduction (e.g., Ulrich, 1993). In addition, Kaplan and\nKaplans (1989) attention restoration theory (ART) proposes that the natural environment\nmay provide a range of important qualities (e.g., ,,fascination) that aid recovery from over-\nexertion of psychological capacities.\nExperience of the natural environment and positive reactions\nExposure to the natural environment has been shown to have a range of\npsychological benefits such as the restoration of cognitive abilities diminished by mental\nover-exertion, stress reduction and the evocation of positive emotions (Abraham,\nSommerhalder, and Abel, 2010; Groenewegen et al., 2006). For example, having views of\ntrees from ones home may positively predict how relaxed and comfortable people feel\n(Kaplan, 2001) and trees in inner-city and suburban environments may be related to\nincreased feelings of safety (Kuo, Bacaicoa, and Sullivan, 1998). Research indicates that\nindirect, even subliminal exposure to natural environments (Korpela, Klemettil\u00e4, and\nHietanen, 2002; Schultz and Tabanico, 2007) tends to elicit largely positive affective\nreactions (Ulrich, 1993; van den Berg, Koole, and van der Wulp, 2003). Moreover, it has\nbeen argued that there is a strong positive relationship between how restorative an\nenvironment is perceived to be and preferences for that environment (Korpela et al., 2001;\nvan den Berg, Hartig, and Staats, 2007).\nA growing corpus of research and opinion has suggested that childhood experiences\nof nature may be important for the development of deep and meaningful bonds with the\nnatural environment (Gross and Lane, 2007; Kahn, 1999). For instance, Lohr and Pearson-\nMims (2005) found that participants who reported having some minimal childhood\nexperiences of planting trees and the care of indoor plants, compared to those participants\nwho reported never having done these things, were more likely to perceive trees as having a\ncalming effect and as having personal and symbolic meaning.\nFurthermore, evidence seems to suggest that elements of some of these natural\nenvironments are able to positively affect people's social interactions (Groenewegen, van\nden Berg, de Vries, and Verheij, 2006). For example, the presence of plants within a\nHuman-natural environment relationships\nlaboratory setting has been shown to elicit both greater generosity in participants than does\na laboratory setting devoid of plants (Weinstein, Przybyiski, and Ryan, 2009), and, within a\nnaturalistic study of classroom behavior, with children's self-reported levels of friendliness\nEudemonic and hedonic wellbeing\nPsychological wellbeing may be conceived of as comprising two distinct\ndimensions (Ryff, Singer, and Love 2005; Waterman, 1993). First, Hedonism, typically\nmeasured by subjective well-being (SWB), comprises indices to gauge general negative\nand positive affect and life satisfaction (Schwarz and Strack, 1999). However, the ability of\nthis concept to reflect the more meaningful and to some extent more intrinsic aspects of\npeoples well-being (i.e., those that are inherently satisfying rather than based upon\nexternal approval) has been challenged (Ryan and Deci, 2001).\nSecond, Eudemonia may be described as living a personally meaningful existence\n(Ryan and Deci, 2001). There is some indication that the intrinsic values associated with\neudemonia may include feelings of inner peace, contemplation, vitality and a deep\nappreciation of life (Huta and Ryan, 2010; Ryan, Huta, and Deci, 2008). For example, the\nemotion awe is associated with feelings of reverence, wonder and aesthetic pleasure and\ncan be experienced in response to \"natural objects that are vast in relation to the self\"\n(Keltner and Haidt, 2003, p. 310) such as oceans, trees and mountains. Moreover, the\nexperiencing of awe is argued to be the result of primordial or \"hard-wired pre-cultural sets\nof responses that were shaped by evolution\" supported by elaborated or culture-specific\nEigner (2001) found that for some people, being in close proximity to the natural\nenvironment produced \"an amazing feeling of happiness\" and an \"inner sort of calm\"\n(Eigner, 2001, p. 191). Eigner suggests that the well-being associated with direct\nengagement with the natural environment may be a qualitatively different, ,,higher quality,\nwell-being than the more hedonistic type of well-being characterized by the ease and\ncomfort of modern lifestyles. Whilst there have been attempts at measuring, with various\ninstruments, some indication of these sorts of experiences with nature (e.g., of a sense of\nconnectedness), other aspects of peoples experiences (e.g., feeling alive and\ncontemplative) have apparently not so readily lent themselves to empirical assessment (e.g.,\nNegative affective reactions to the natural environment\nOf course, not all reactions to the natural environment are entirely positive (e.g.,\nBixler, Carlisle, Hammitt, and Floyd, 1994; Herzog and Kutzli, 2002): biophobia is the\nnegative and largely innate 'biological preparedness' response to natural stimuli such as\nsnakes and heights (Orians, 1998; Ulrich 1993). One suggestion is that negative reactions\nto the natural environment, specifically in relation to wilderness-type environments, can\ninvolve terror because of the apparent feelings of mortality that such encounters might\nengender (Koole and van den Berg, 2005). In particular, it has been argued that the absence\nof human influence, such as the lack of buildings and people, within wilderness\nenvironments leads people to be confronted \"with their own finitude\" (Koole and van den\nBerg, 2005, p. 1026) which people may be buffered against while they are located in\nHuman-natural environment relationships\nlargely synthetic and human-controlled modern (and chiefly western) habitations.\nSimilarly, overly dense forests with little accessibility may engender feelings of foreboding\n(Herzog and Kutzli, 2002; Staats et al, 1997), whilst other environments may be perceived\nas not providing adequate safety and sustenance (Orians, 1998).\nAmbivalent affective reactions to the natural environment\nBeyond the simple dichotomous categories of either positive or negative reactions\nto the natural environment, there is the possibility the natural environment may instill both\npositive and negative reactions, even simultaneously (cf. Bonnes, Passafaro, and Carrus,\n2011). Early western experiences with mountains, for example, have elicited what might be\ndescribed as an affective ambivalence: great fear but also heightened positive emotions\nof crossing the Italian Alps as \"a delightful horrour, a terrible joy\" (p. 73). These\nsentiments have been echoed by other nature writers in other less precipitous natural\nenvironments: Emerson (1836/1982), for instance, describes his emotions during a night-\ntime crossing of a common in winter: \"I have enjoyed perfect exhilaration. I am glad to the\nbrink of fear\" (p. 38). Some evidence of these types of reactions has recently been found in\nempirical research. For example, in one study it emerged that different types of\nenvironmental encounters seemed to elicit ambivalent emotional states involving\ncombinations of fear, awe, respect, and happiness (van den Berg and ter Heijne, 2005).\nUrban and rural living\nSome evidence indicates that physical-demographic variables, such as distance of\nresidence from an outdoor recreation area, have little relationship with peoples sense of the\npsychological restoration provided by the natural environment (Hartig, Kaiser, and\nStrumse, 2007). The same study also indicated that female participants were more likely\nthan male participants to perceive the natural environment as more positive (restorative).\nConversely, there is a body of evidence which suggests that rural living, in comparison to\nurban living, may engender more positive reactions towards the natural environment\n(Berenguer, Corraliza, and Mart\u00edn, 2005; Hinds and Sparks, 2008). For example, Hinds and\nSparks (2009) found that people from rural childhood locations, compared to those from\nurban childhood locations, reported more positive affective wellbeing and stronger\nenvironmental identities. After controlling for a multitude of variables (e.g., physical\nhealth, access to a car, employment, age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, overcrowding,\nstructural housing problems, and income based socioeconomic status), rural people, in\ncomparison to urban people, have reported significantly lower rates of depression and\nanxiety (Weich, Twigg, and Lewis, 2006). Other research has found that people living in\nrural areas, compared to people living in urban areas, exhibit less negative affect (e.g.,\ndepression, boredom, and loneliness) in their lives and tend to be more satisfied with their\nlives (Pa\u00fal, Fonseca, Mart\u00edn, and Amado, 2003). Moreover, some research has indicated\nthat there may be little effect of selective migration on the physical health differences often\nfound between rural and urban populations, where rural populations often report fewer\nhealth problems (Verheji, van de Mheen, de Bakker, Groenewegen, and Mackenbach,\nHuman-natural environment relationships\nThe present study\nIn addition to the indicators of general positive responses towards the natural\nenvironment, the research reviewed above has also suggested that there are likely to be\ndifferent emotional reactions to different types of natural environment. Using the\npsychometric method (e.g., Slovic, Fischhoff, and Lichtenstein, 1980) several studies have\nsought to illustrate diagrammatically the general structural relationship among all\ncombinations of two sets of variables (B\u00f6hm, 2003; McDaniels, Axelrod, and Slovic, 1996;\nWhite and Dolan, 2009) The present study is a unique application of the psychometric\napproach concerned with examining the relationship between (a) different types of natural\nenvironments and (b) a broad range of positive and negative affect-based experiential\nstates. We were also interested in how experiential states associated with natural\nenvironments may be associated with frequency of experience of the natural environment\nand childhood location.\nSpecifically, we (i) sought to explore the structure of peoples experience of\ndifferent types of natural environments, (ii) expected that participants from rural childhood\nlocations, in comparison to participants from urban childhood locations, would report more\npositive, and less negative, experiential states associated with being in the natural\nenvironments, and (iii) expected that participants reporting greater experience of the natural\nenvironment, compared to those reporting less experience, would report more positive, and\nless negative, experiential states associated with being in the natural environment.\nDespite some debate about whether any environment in the present day can be\ndescribed as truly natural (e.g., Cronon, 1996; McKibben, 2003), we chose to retain 'natural\nenvironment' and operate a working definition similar to that employed by Abraham et al.s\n(2010) study of landscape preference: \"a continuum between 'wild' nature and designed\nenvironments such as urban and rural forests, green spaces, parks, gardens, waters, and\nneighbourhood areas\" (p. 59).\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants (N = 90; female = 82; male = 8) were a sample of undergraduate social\nscience students at the University of Sussex, UK. Their mean age was 21.1 years (SD =\nMaterials\nAll participants received a questionnaire assessing, among other variables, the\nrelationship between (i) being in different natural environments and (ii) different\nexperiential states. All responses were recorded along fully anchored Likert-like scales.\nChildhood location. Following questions relating to age and gender, participants\nwere asked to indicate the type of location in which they grew up: \"In what sort of location\ndid you spend the majority of your childhood?\" with three possible responses: Urban (n =\nEnvironments and experiential states. Ten environments were derived from a\nHuman-natural environment relationships\ndiscussion between the authors retaining those likely to be found in the UK (forest,\nmountain, garden, beach, valley, woodland, hill, river, farmland field, and park). These\nenvironments were rated in terms of 14 experiential states by asking participants \"To what\nextent would you expect to feel each of the following\" (relaxed, a sense of awe, a sense of\nfreedom, refreshed, connectedness, isolated, anxious, alive, contemplative, talkative, sense\nof fun, empathy, loneliness, and serenity). These experiential feeling states were derived\nfrom previous exploratory research (N = 75) which used the working definition of the\nnatural environment as ,,any areas and settings produced by nature, such as woodland, hills,\nlakes, moorland, valleys, coastal areas, heathland, mountains, rivers and forests.\nParticipants were asked to \"Please list all the words or short phrases that you would\nassociate personally with being in the natural environment\".\nUsing methods to elicit participant feelings about place that have been utilized\nelsewhere (e.g., Hartig, Korpela, Evans and G\u00e4rling, 1997), the present study asked\nparticipants to, for example: \"Imagine yourself being in a garden environment. To what\nextent would you expect to feel each of the following?\" (not at all [1] to extremely [7]).\nFrequency of experience of the natural environment. Frequency of experience of\neach environment was measured by the item: \"Please indicate how often you are actually in\neach of the following types of environment.\" Responses were recorded on 5-point scales\nranging from 1 (very often) to 5 (never) and reversed coded for analysis. Frequency of\nExperience was computed by mean-averaging the frequency of experience across all ten\nenvironments for each participant. These were then converted by median split procedure\n(retaining the median category, viz. ,,2) into a three level grouping variable: Low\nexperience (n = 40), Median experience (n = 12) and High experience (n = 38).\nProcedure\nParticipants were presented with a questionnaire listing natural environments and\nwere asked to rate each environment on ten experiential feeling states by imagining being\nin each one \u00ad no visual stimulus was utilized to elicit responses.\nResults\nExperiential state structure\nA principal components analysis (with varimax rotation) of the mean scores of each\ncombination of experiential state and environment was carried out, producing a two\ncomponent solution accounting for 89.35% of the variance (see Table 1). Based on\nare included.\nThe first component (58.75%) was labeled Eudemonia with the following variables\nloading heavily: serenity, a sense of awe, contemplation, empathy, alive, a sense of\nfreedom, connectedness, and refreshed. The second component was labeled Apprehension\n(30.60%) with isolated, lonely, and anxious loading heavily and positively and with a sense\nof fun, talkative, and relaxed loading heavily and negatively. The means and standard\ndeviations for each environment for each feeling state are presented in Table 2.\nThe retained factor scores for each environment from the PCA were then used as\nHuman-natural environment relationships\nindices to map each environment relative to each other about the axis of the two-factor\nsolution, namely Eudemonia and Apprehension. The two component space (see Figure 1)\nshows, for example, that mountain, forest, woodland, and valley are located relatively\nhighly on the Eudemonia component as well as being relatively high on the Apprehension\ncomponent; beach and river are located relatively high on the Eudemonia component and\nrelatively low on the Apprehension component; hill and farmland field are located\nrelatively low on the Eudemonia component and relatively high on the Apprehension\ncomponent; garden and park score low on the Eudemonia component and relatively low on\nthe Apprehension component. This analysis provides an overall picture of the relationship\nbetween different environments and different experiential states at an aggregated level. We\nwere also interested however, in more fine-grained analyses of the experiential states\nassociated with individual environments.\nTable 1.

Likewise, a measure of Apprehension ( = .91) was computed by taking the\nmeans of the scores of the experiential states that loaded heavily on that component (viz.\nisolated, lonely, anxious, a sense of fun [reverse coded], talkative [reverse coded], and\nrelaxed [reverse coded] scores) for all the environments.\nwoodland\nforest\nmountain\nriver\nbeach\nvalley\nhill\nfarmland field\npark\ngarden\n(serenity, awe, alive, empathy, refreshed, connectedness, freedom, contemplative)\n(isolated, anxious, lonely, fun, talkative relaxed)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman-natural environment relationships\nTo investigate the effect of childhood location and experience of the natural\nenvironment on experiential states, a 3 (Childhood Location: urban vs. suburban vs. rural) x\n3 (Frequency of Experience: low vs. medium vs. high) MANOVA of both Eudemonia and\nApprehension was carried out using Roys largest root (largest) as the determining P value.\nBoth Levenes test of equality of error variance (Eudemonia, F(7,81) = 1.29, p = .27);\np = .65) were non-significant and assumptions of normality were thereby satisfied.\nMultivariate analyses revealed a significant main effect of Frequency of\nUnivariate analyses revealed that for Frequency of Experience there was a\nbetween Frequency of Experience and Childhood Location for either Eudemonia F(3,81) =\nHuman-natural environment relationships\nTable 2.

Rural childhood participants compared to urban childhood participants\nDiscussion\nOur psychometric analysis of experiential states associated with various natural\nenvironments revealed an interesting pattern of relationships. Notable was the tendency for\nthe more natural or wild environments, such as forests and mountains, to be associated with\nhigher levels of Eudemonia than were the less natural environments, such as farmland field\nand parks. Moreover, some of the more natural environments also seemed to engender\nfeelings of isolation and loneliness, such that mountains, forests and woodland elicited high\nscores not only on Eudemonia but also on Apprehension. The pattern of results described\nhere is consonant with the idea of ambivalent attitudes to the natural environment found\nempirically (e.g., van den Berg and ter Heijne, 2005) and those mentioned anecdotally\nHowever, one relationship that may challenge this interpretation of ambivalence is\nthat between Eudemonia and the items lonely, isolated and anxious. Although these three\nitems loaded strongly on what we have called the Apprehension component, they also\nHuman-natural environment relationships\nloaded positively on the Eudemonia component. In other words, one possible interpretation\nof this finding could be that being lonely, isolated and anxious in some environments is\nexperienced positively (cf. Grahn and Stigsdotter, 2010).\nGarden, park, beach and river environments were more likely to elicit reported\nfeelings of fun, relaxation and talkativeness than were other environments. It has been\nsuggested elsewhere that gardens, parks (Bhatti and Church, 2001; Burgess et al., 1988)\nand waterscapes (Ogunseitan, 2005; Tuan, 1974) may be important places for social\ninteractions and the maintenance of positive affective states (Regan and Horn, 2005). The\naffective states associated with such social interactions may also be qualitatively different\nfrom the affect associated with exposure to the natural environment.\nThe present study found waterscapes, such as river and beach, to be high in terms\nof Eudemonia. In other words, waterscapes seemed to elicit a broad array of positive\nexperiential states (high Eudemonia), high levels of fun, relaxation and talkativeness but\nlittle in the way of negative experiential feeling states (low Apprehension). Therefore, it\nmay be suggested from the pattern of results that although the more natural environments\ntend to elicit more Eudemonia, some are also perceived as more fun (e.g., waterscapes) and\nsome as more lonely and isolating (e.g., forests and mountains) (see Staats et al., 1997).\nThese findings have some degree of resonance with an evolutionary perspective of human\nThe expectation that rural participants would report more positive experiential states\nin connection with the various natural environments was not supported, although the\npattern of means was in the expected direction. This unanticipated finding may reflect a\nwidespread positive appreciation of the natural environment (e.g., Hartig et al, 2007;\nNewell, 1997). However, participants with a rural childhood location, compared to\nparticipants with an urban childhood location, reported less Apprehension in relation to\nbeing in the environments. Therefore, one hypothesis meriting consideration is that\ngrowing up in a rural childhood location may have a larger role to play in the avoidance of\nthe feelings of anxiety, loneliness and isolation that urban childhood participants associate\nwith the natural environment, than it does in accentuating positive experiential states.\nIt was also found, as expected and in line with previous research (e.g., Hinds and\nSparks, 2009), that participants reporting greater experience of the natural environment,\ncompared to participants reporting less experience, tended to report greater Eudemonia in\nrelation to the natural environments. This finding may be seen as reinforcement of the idea\nthat biophilic, and to some extent biophobic, predispositions may be awakened or enhanced\nIt could be argued quite reasonably that people who enjoy the natural environment\nmore are likely to be motivated to engage with it more frequently. It may also be the case\nthat people who have greater experience of the natural environment tend to experience\nmore positive experiential states, although there may be other additional explanations for\nthis. For instance, certain personality types may be more inclined both towards greater\nfrequency of experience of the natural environment and to experiencing (and / or reporting)\ncertain affective experiential states. Undoubtedly, these possibilities may interact to shape\npeoples behavior and affective responses. However, given the evidence from previous\nexperimental research that positive responses towards the natural environment may be\nHuman-natural environment relationships\nelicited through simple exposure (e.g., Korpela et al., 2002; van den Berg et al., 2003), the\npresent studys findings are at least congruent with the idea that greater experience of\nnatural environments can stand as a causal antecedent of more positive experiential states.\nHaving said this, the present findings would benefit from further substantiation\nfrom future research employing methods to examine actual natural environmental\nencounters. Such research could, for example, quantify and describe the duration and\nnature of those experiences. This would obviate the reliance (evident in the present study)\non participants subjective accounts of their frequency of experience of the natural\nenvironment. In a similar vein, participants could be asked to provide examples of the\nenvironments they respond to in order to determine if there is some degree of consensus of\ntheir subjective understandings of those environments.\nIt must also be acknowledged here that the sample used for the present research was\ndisproportionately female which may have biased results towards positive responses\ntowards the natural environment (cf. Hartig et al., 2007). Moreover, the sample was\nrelatively small and homogenous, thus inhibiting the generalizability of the findings to\nbroader populations. Additionally, there may be problems with identifying exactly what\nconstitutes urban or rural categories (e.g., Weich et al., 2006). Urban and rural groups may\nalso differ on how they perceive different environments (Berenguer et al., 2005). Therefore,\ndespite the present study finding support for similar research using this particular method\nof collecting rural / urban data (e.g., Hinds and Sparks, 2008), these differences should be\ntreated tentatively, awaiting further research employing more objective methods to elicit\nrural and urban classifications.\nIn summary, the present findings suggest that there may be a diverse pattern of\nexperiential states associated with different natural environments. However, what is also\napparent is the significant role that Eudemonia plays in reactions to the majority of those\nenvironments. Although previous research has identified the importance of affective factors\nin evaluations of the natural environment (Korpela, et al., 2002), the present research has\nbeen able to show how some environments (e.g., mountains) may be associated with\nparticular experiential states (e.g., indicating Eudemonia), and others (e.g., parks) seem to\nelicit other positive experiential states (e.g., fun and relaxation). Additionally, the role of\nApprehension seems to be more strongly associated with the more natural environments\nsuch as mountains, and negligibly associated with both (some) waterscapes and other, less\nnatural, environments such as parks.\nGiven the increasing need for a more engaged, pro-environmental, population, the\nfindings presented here highlight the potential of experience of the natural environment for\neffecting more positive affective reactions towards the natural environment. Additionally,\nthere is the suggestion that early experience of the natural environment, measured here as\nchildhood location, may be conducive to the avoidance of negative experiential states\nassociated with those environments.\nThe present study provides a novel perspective on the relationship between\naffective experiences and the natural environment. In particular, it is the quality of positive\naffect associated with eudemonic well-being that represents a rather novel insight into that\nrelationship. Certainly, the quantitative investigation of eudemonic well-being and its\nassociation with natural environment experiences has received little published research\nHuman-natural environment relationships\nattention to date. Our research also shows that different environments elicit different\naffective responses, thereby adding to the broader body of knowledge regarding human\nrelationships with specific natural environments. Finally, the work described here lends\nsupport to the growing body of evidence pointing to the importance of direct experience of\nthe natural environment as a contributor to psychological well-being.\nReferences\nAbraham, A., Sommerhalder, K., and Abel, T.
