Research on women's multiple roles frequently adopts one of two perspectives: role strain, which argues that\nassuming multiple roles is detrimental to mental well-being, or role enhancement, which argues that engaging in multiple roles\nenhances mental well-being. We argue that the relationship between role occupancy and well-being is manifested through mul-\ntiple dimensions of role experiences. We investigate the association between depressive symptomatology and various dimen-\nsions of the roles of wife, mother, paid worker, and informal caregiver to aging parents.\nMethods. Data are from the 1992 wave of the Health and Retirement Study. Depressive symptomatology, measured by a\nsubset of the CES-D scale, is the dependent variable. To assess the robustness of findings relative to different functional forms\nof the dependent variable, we estimate multiple regression, log-linear regression, and multinomial logit models. Independent\nvariables include demographic characteristics, measures of role occupancy, role demands, and role satisfaction.\nResults. Although the number of roles women assume affects their reports of depressive symptoms, once the demand and\nsatisfaction associated with these roles is controlled, number has no effect; that is, the effect of the number of roles is indirect.\nDiscussion. Our results highlight the importance of women's perceptions of the quality of their roles in relation to their\noverall well-being. Future investigations of women's multiple roles should examine how roles may provide rewards, impose\nconstraints, or generate conflict, as well as the extent to which the willingness to assume multiple roles and the reported levels\nof role satisfaction and mental well-being may be jointly endogenous.\nTHAT women spend much of their adult lives juggling the\ndemands of multiple roles is not news. Because the roles\nthat women occupy depend, in part, on age and family struc-\nture, roles common to women of one age may be much less\ncommon and, perhaps, much less enjoyable for women of dif-\nferent ages. As more people survive to old age and live longer\nas elders, more women find themselves assuming the role of\ncaregiver to multiple generations of family members while they\ncontinue in their roles as wives and paid workers. Managing\nmultiple roles can be both stressful and satisfying. Even very\ndemanding roles can be associated with enhanced well-being if\nthey reinforce a positive sense of identity. Studies that examine\nthe impact of women's multiple roles on their well-being gen-\nerally explore the roles of wife, mother, and paid worker, but\nexclude the role of informal caregiver to aging adults. In addi-\ntion, although role occupancy and role demands are generally\nincluded, role quality often is not.\nHow are women's experiences in multiple roles related to\ntheir well-being in midlife? Recent cohorts of women--partic-\nularly married women and women with children--exhibit\nhigher rates of labor force participation than previous genera-\ntions (Moen, 1992). Women also constitute the majority of in-\nformal caregivers to elderly people (Brody, Kleban, Johnsen,\nHoffman, & Schoonover, 1987; Guberman, Maheu, & Maille,\nThus, midlife women are increasingly likely to be engaged in\nvarious types of paid and unpaid labor. The obligations and ex-\npectations that accompany these roles may be incompatible,\nnegatively affecting women's well-being and resulting in symp-\ntoms of depression. On the other hand, roles may be reinforcing\nand rewarding, leading to enhanced well-being.\nTwo perspectives central to role theory--role strain and role\nenhancement--predict different outcomes for women occupy-\ning multiple roles. Whereas a role strain perspective suggests\nthat multiple roles can make women feel overburdened, thereby\nhaving a detrimental effect on mental and physical well-being\n1989), a role enhancement perspective argues that multiple\nroles improve mental well-being (Brody, Litvin, Hoffman, &\nWomen's roles outside the home may put them in touch with\nmore emotional and economic resources and temper their con-\nflicting responsibilities. Having more outlets for the release of\ntension and more sources of support may be beneficial for\nwomen. Furthermore, a difficulty in one role can be offset by\nEmpirical studies often address the number of roles a woman\noccupies, but multiple roles are not uniformly beneficial or\ndetrimental. The quality of those roles can also affect well-\nbeing (Baruch & Barnett, 1986; Parris Stephens, Franks, &\nTownsend, 1994). In fact, satisfaction with a role may have a\ngreater effect on well-being than actual role demands (Baruch\n& Barnett, 1986). Here we examine how women's mental well-\nbeing is linked to the number, demands, and satisfaction with\nthe multiple roles they occupy.\nRole strain or role enhancement.--The role strain perspec-\ntive emphasizes the potential negative consequences that the\nstress and competing demands of multiple roles may have for\nof time and energy, adapting to multiple roles may adversely\naffect mental well-being (Brody, 1990) and compromise friend-\nships and other emotional resources (Stoller & Pugliesi, 1989).\nBecause relationships formed through sets of roles tend to be\nstable and important to individuals, stress can increase when\nChronic role strains applicable to women in this study include\nrole overload (e.g., when demands exceed capacities, common\nto informal caregivers), interrole conflict (e.g., when demands\nof multiple roles are incompatible), role captivity (e.g., when an\nindividual takes on a role unwillingly), and role restructuring\n(e.g., when adult children assume increasing responsibility for\ntheir parents). These changes in relationships can result in feel-\nings of betrayal, status loss, and the violation of expectations.\nAccording to the role enhancement perspective, the accumu-\nlation of multiple roles can increase social integration leading\nto an increase in \"power, prestige, resources, and emotional\ngratification, including social recognition and a heightened\nthis perspective is that too few roles may be detrimental to men-\ntal well-being. Women who are not employed outside the home\nmay experience stress from isolation, have fewer outlets for the\nrelease of tension, and be less satisfied with their lives (Oakley,\n1974). In general, the demands of multiple roles tend to be off-\nset by the support received (Brody et al., 1992; Parris Stephens\nExperiences in one role may affect experiences in another\nthrough a \"role spillover\" effect (Parris Stephens & Franks,\n1995). For example, for an employed woman with a fulfilling\njob but a difficult informal caregiving relationship, the positive\nemployment experience may make the caregiving easier, or her\nnegative caregiving experience may interfere with her paid\nwork. Parris Stephens and colleagues (1994) examine role qual-\nity in terms of the stresses and rewards and argue that although\nthe accumulation of stress across roles may be detrimental to\nwomen's well-being, the accumulation of rewards across roles\nmay be beneficial. Role history--an individual's accumulated\nexperience in a role--also suggests that some life events may\nbe nonproblematic or even beneficial to individuals by offering\nan escape from a chronically stressful role situation (Wheaton,\nMental well-being, central to both perspectives, has been\nlinked to life satisfaction, on the one hand, and to depressive\nsymptoms, on the other. Well-being and distress (which may be\nmanifested as depression) may be conceptualized as opposite\nends of a continuum (Mirowsky & Ross, 1989); therefore, tests\nof role theories can examine the correlates of either well-being\nor distress to establish the connections between role occupancy\nand mental health outcomes.\nWomen's roles at midlife.--Some studies of women's roles\nat midlife emphasize changes within a role that occur in\nmidlife; others examine the interaction between roles. One\nmidlife transition that affects the mother role is the departure of\nchildren from the home, often referred to as the \"empty nest\"\nsyndrome (Levinson, 1996). Some women may become de-\npressed when their children leave home, while others experi-\nence a sense of liberation from the maternal role (Apter, 1995;\nLevinson, 1996). Although most midlife women no longer have\nyoung children at home, an increasing number of older children\nhave been returning to live at home (Aquilino & Supple, 1991).\nFor women who enjoyed freedom from the maternal role, the\nreturn of adult children to the parental household may cause\ntension. The quality of the relationship with the adult child is\ncentral to mothers' satisfaction with the living arrangements\nThe effects of being an employee, a wife, and a caregiver on\nwell-being depends, in part, on the conditions under which the\nroles are enacted. Employed women are less distressed than\nwomen who are exclusively homemakers, but more distressed\nthan employed men (Mirowsky & Ross, 1989). However, little\ndifference persists between homemakers and employed women\nonce the working conditions of the roles (e.g., security, com-\nplexity, autonomy, discretion) are controlled (Lennon, 1994).\nMarried people score higher than unmarried people on mea-\nsures of well-being, although the difference is greater for men\nthan women (Baruch & Barnett, 1986; Lee, Seccombe, &\n1990). However, marriages characterized by inequality, con-\nflict, and a lack of consideration may decrease well-being\n(Mirowsky & Ross, 1989). The subjective experience of the\nwife role or an unequal division of labor within the household\nmay also affect marital satisfaction (Glass & Fujimoto, 1994).\nFinally, caregiving can complement or interfere with other role\nobligations. Role strain may result from trying to balance care-\ngiving for elderly parents with career and family responsibili-\nties (Lerner, Somers, Reid, Chiriboga, & Tierney, 1991; Mui,\nhigh levels of assistance are necessary (Stoller & Pugliesi,\n1989). Caregiving may also negatively affect performance at\nwork, increasing absenteeism, tardiness, work interruptions,\nmissed advancement opportunities, and thus increasing job\nPositive aspects associated with performing multiple roles\ninclude enhanced self-esteem, identity strengthening, informal\nsupport networks, and improved access to material and social\nStoller & Pugliesi, 1989). In fact, many married women care-\ngivers find that the esteem and effectiveness they experience in\nthis role benefits their relationships with their husbands (Parris\nStephens & Franks, 1995). Married women caregivers also\nhave more socioeconomic and instrumental support, and finan-\ncial resources; they report less depression than unmarried care-\ngivers (Brody et al., 1992). Employment provides increased in-\ncome to informal caregivers and can lead to an improved\nrelationship between the caregiver and care recipient\n(Scharlach, 1994). In sum, a sense of accomplishment and ex-\ntended interpersonal relationships can overshadow the negative\naspects of combining caregiving with employment.\nBoth the role strain and role enhancement perspectives lack\ndimensions that allow for the complexity of women's lives as\nthey balance multiple roles. Studies of women's multiple roles\ndisplay a mixture of methodologies; their samples are often\nsmall and unrepresentative, and gender is not always controlled.\nIn addition, the range of roles in which women engage is often\nlimited to two or three, with informal caregiver and employee\nbeing the most frequently excluded. For these reasons, the rela-\ntionship between multiple roles and well-being is an open ques-\ntion. Although the number of roles coupled with the demands\nand quality of each role are all implicated in well-being, most\nresearch focuses primarily on the number of roles women as-\nsume and the compatibility of those roles, but excludes enjoy-\nment of those roles and their implied relationship. We build on\nprevious research [e.g., Baruch & Barnett (1986), Parris\nexamine the interrelationship between women's roles using\nmeasures of role occupancy, role demand, and role satisfaction.\nIn this article, we assess whether the effects of multiple roles\nare additive or interactive; that is, are certain combinations of\nroles more strongly linked to well-being or distress? Second,\nwe test whether the relationships between well-being and vari-\nous role dimensions are direct or indirect.\nMETHODS\nData.--Our data are from the 1992 wave of the Health and\nRetirement Study (HRS), which provides a nationally represen-\ntative sample of men and women aged 51-61 and their spouses\nor partners. Cases were drawn from a sample of 70,000 house-\nholds that were screened for age-eligible respondents. The sam-\nsurvey was designed to study labor force participation and pen-\nsions, health conditions and health status, family structure and\ntransfers, and economic status (Burkhauser & Gertler, 1995).\nFrom these data, we analyze age-eligible women (5,116), as the\nout-of-age-range spouses are not representative of their age\ngroups. The survey oversamples African Americans, Hispanics,\nand Florida residents. Our analyses are based on the person-\nweighted data to readjust for the differential sampling weights.\nGiven that the average age of female adult-child caregivers is\nan appropriate sample in which to include informal caregiver as\nan optional role. Women in this age group have parents who are\nlikely to be experiencing chronic and acute illness that may re-\nquire informal caregiving or who may need help with activities\nof daily living (ADLs). Therefore, they occupy the midlife age\nrange in which the multiple roles of wife, worker, parent, and\ncaregiver are likely to overlap.\nHowever, we also face data limitations. HRS includes mea-\nsures of satisfaction for the paid worker and wife roles; it does\nnot offer measures of satisfaction specific to the parental or in-\nformal caregiving roles. However, a measure of satisfaction with\n\"family life\" is available. Clearly, the roles of wife, mother, and\nparental caregiver all involve family life and relationships. Given\nthe separate measure of marital satisfaction (which should par-\ntial out this dimension of family life for all wives), we are left\nwith a measure that is relevant to both the role of parent and the\nrole of caregiver, as well as to other potential family connec-\ntions. Also, because this study is cross-sectional, it is not possi-\nble to establish direct causal relationships between the indepen-\ndent and dependent variables, nor can we control for preexisting\nlevels of depressive symptoms. We can, however, investigate the\ncorrelative linkage between women's experiences of their multi-\nple roles and their reported symptoms of depression.\nIndependent variables.--The analyses include four cate-\ngories of independent variables that are described in Table 1. A\nfew points should be noted. First, the informal caregiver role\ndistinguishes women who assisted their own or their spouse's\nparents with ADLs such as bathing, eating, and dressing in the\npast year from those who did not. This definition of informal\ncaregiving does not include activities such as transportation,\nshopping, or cooking. Thus, the informal caregivers in this anal-\nysis are involved in the most intensive hands-on caregiving ac-\ntivities, though the time they spend engaged in these activities\nvaries widely. We include measures of the demand associated\nwith the roles of paid worker, mother, and informal caregiver,\nbut not wife. For both paid work and caregiving, we created\ndummy variables indicative of levels of demand consistent with\nnatural cutpoints in the distribution; the omitted (reference) cat-\negories are the highest levels of demand. By treating the contin-\nuous variables for hours at work and hours of informal care as\nsets of dummy variables, we are better able to capture nonuni-\nform effects across levels of demand. Measures of role de-\nmands and role quality apply only to women who occupy those\nroles. The distributions on these independent variables are\ntherefore a combination of zeros (for women not in the role)\nand observed values (for women occupying the role). The inter-\npretation of these \"embedded variables\" is discussed in the\nAnalysis Plan section.\nDependent variable.--The dependent variable for this analy-\nsis is the respondent's score on a 14-item scale that is a subset\nof the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-\nD) 20-item scale; it serves as a measure of depressive symp-\ntomatology. Depressive symptomatology has been found to be\na fit indicator of distress for women. It is important to distin-\nguish here between distress and depression and their different\nmanifestations for men and women. Measures of alcohol con-\nsumption and other outward displays of depressive symptoms\nmay be more suitable for men than women, because alco-\nholism, for example, has been suggested as a masculine form\nThe CES-D was designed to measure symptoms of depression\nin the general population. Its purpose is not to diagnose depres-\nsion but rather to assess the level of symptoms of depression\nwith an emphasis on depressed mood (Radloff, 1977). Thus,\nwe employ the 14-item scale not as a diagnostic tool, but as an\nindicator of distress. Many researchers use this shorter version\nof the CES-D scale and have found it to be highly internally\nconsistent (Wallace & Herzog, 1995). The scale has an alpha of\n0.88 for the present sample and is therefore considered a reli-\nable measure of depressive symptomatology.\nAnalysis plan.--We estimated ordinary least squares (OLS)\nand multinomial logit regression models with different specifi-\ncations of the dependent variable (raw score, logged score, bi-\nnary, multinomial) to test the strength of our findings under\nvarying sets of assumptions. In each case, we examined the net\neffects of the independent variables in stages, moving from less\nto more complex specifications, that is, from basic demographic\ncharacteristics, to role occupancy (wife, mother, paid worker,\nand informal caregiver to parents), role demands (for mother,\npaid worker, and informal caregiver), and finally role quality.\nThe combination of the first and second models can be written\nas:\n= a + pd\nDemogj + 7,Rolesr\nwhere Y;\nis the raw score for the 14-item CES-D scale, a is the\nconstant, (3d\nare the coefficients for the \"d\" demographic char-\nTable 1.

Because the role occu-\npancy variables are dummy-coded, the coefficients in -yr\ncan be\nthought of as increments or decrements to the intercept, show-\ning how role occupants differ in their average CES-D scores\nfrom those not in the role when other variables are controlled.\nThe full model adds embedded measures of demand and role\nquality. It can be written as:\n= a + + 7r\nRolesr\nQualityk\nwhere a, f3d\nare as before, 8j are the coefficients for the j\nrole demand variables, and 8k\nare the coefficients for the k role\nquality measures. These remaining independent variables are\nexamples of embedded variables in that they are constructed so\nthat the coefficients refer only to the women engaged in those\nroles. For example, women who are not employed are coded\nzero for the employee role and, therefore, also coded zero on all\nthe dummy variables for hours worked, and zero for job satis-\nfaction. The same situation holds for women who are not care-\ngivers. For married women, the distribution on marital satisfac-\ntion reflects this same logic; however, we have no measure of\nmarital demand. By controlling for role occupancy, we limit the\ncoefficients for role demand and role quality to those women\nwho occupy the role. For example, the coefficients for the\ndummy variables indicating hours of work estimate how differ-\nent work regimens increase or decrease the expected CES-D\nscore among women who work. Similarly, the coefficient for\njob satisfaction describes the net effect of role quality on well-\nbeing for working women.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive statistics.--Thefirstcolumn of Table 2 displays\nthe mean values for all variables. The typical respondent was a\nWhite, 56-year-old woman with a high school diploma. The\nmajority of women were married and employed. Six percent of\nthe sample were informal caregivers to aging parents who aver-\naged between 2 and 3 hours caregiving per day. Women who\nwere employed worked on average almost 40 hours per week.\nOne third had children over 18 years old at home, with one\nchild over 18 as the average. Four out of five women reported\nbeing in good to excellent health. Married women were gener-\nally satisfied with their marriages (only 10% scored 3 or\nbelow), and employed women expressed somewhat less satis-\nfaction with theirjobs (15% scored 3 or below).\nGiven the prominence of employment and marital status in\nthe literature, we report within-category means by both em-\nployment status and marital status. The second and third\ncolumns of Table 2 display the group means for employed and\nnonemployed women. Although employed and nonemployed\nTable 2.

Nonemployed women are also more likely to\nbe married, non-White, somewhat older, in poorer health, have\nless schooling, and lower household incomes. Unmarried\nwomen, compared to married women, are significantly more\nlikely to be employed, older, in poorer health, non-White, have\nlower socioeconomic status, and higher CES-D scores (see\nFor all women in the sample, the mean score on the CES-D\nsubset is 8.68, which is a low level. Nonemployed women aver-\nage somewhat higher levels of symptoms than employed\nwomen, as do unmarried women compared to married women.\nAt the bivariate level, these findings support a relationship be-\ntween marriage and employment, on the one hand, and better\nphysical and mental health, on the other. However, these find-\nings cannot distinguish between two competing hypotheses:\nDoes marriage or employment enhance women's health, or do\nhealthier women tend to be married and/or employed?\nRegression results.--Thefirstregression model estimates the\nnet coefficients for basic demographic characteristics. The coef-\nficients and their standard errors are found in thefirstcolumn of\nTable 3. This initial model explains approximately one fifth of\nthe variance in depressive symptoms. Years of school and age\nhave somewhat modest net effects on depressive symptoms--a\none- to two-tenth decrement for each additional year. House-\nhold income is also negatively associated with depressive\nsymptoms and registers a relatively strong effect. CES-D scores\nfor women in fair or poor health are almost 6 points higher than\nscores for healthy women. Race, however, is not a significant\nnet predictor of CES-D scores.\nThe second regression model explores how assuming differ-\nent roles relates to expected CES-D scores. These coefficients\nare found in the second column of Table 3. Once we add mea-\nsures for the various types of roles women can assume, the ex-\nplanatory power of the model increases only marginally, ex-\nplaining 22% of the variance in CES-D scores. Nevertheless,\nwhen we control for demographic differences, these roles are\nsignificantly related to the level of depressive symptoms.\nWomen who have children over 18 at home tend to have\nmarginally higher CES-D scores than women who do not, and\nwomen who are caregivers tend to have higher CES-D scores\nthan noncaregivers. In contrast, married women have lower\nCES-D scores than nonmarried women, and employed women\nhave lower CES-D scores on average than nonemployed\nwomen.\nTo further explore the relationship between marital status\nand employment status, we include an interaction term to deter-\nmine whether the positive effect of employment status is the\nsame regardless of marital status. In fact, it is not. The negative\neffect of employment on CES-D scores is larger for nonmarried\nwomen than married women. Similarly, marital status reduces\nCES-D scores for nonemployed women more than for em-\nployed women. Overall, women who are either married or em-\nployed, or both married and employed, have similar scores, in-\ndicating significantly lower CES-D scores than for women who\noccupy neither role. Hypothesized interactions between other\ncombinations of roles were not supported, indicating that, with\nthe exception of wife and paid worker, the effects of other roles\non predicted CES-D scores were uniform.\nIncluding the role indicators in this model had little effect on\nthe estimates for education, age, and health, and somewhat re-\nduced the effect for household income (which was probably a\nfunction of adding employment status and marital status, be-\ncause they are also related to household income). The largest\nchange occurred in estimated racial differences. When we com-\npare White and non-White women with the same demographic\ncharacteristics who occupy the same roles, White women have\nsomewhat higher CES-D scores than non-White women. The\neffect is small but nonetheless significant.\nThe third regression model explores the demand associated\nwith three of the four roles in Model 2. Rather than entering\nhours spent caregiving and hours of paid work as interval mea-\nsures, these distributions were classified into categories of de-\nmand so we could test for nonlinearities in their effects. The\nthird column of Table 3 reports these results. In this model, the\ndemand variables act as embedded measures. Because they\nonly apply to those who occupy the role, the demand variables\nare essentially interaction terms that measure the effects of\nhigher levels of demand on CES-D scores among those who\nAs in Model 2, we are interested in comparing those who are\nnot caregivers with those who provide care. However, by\nadding the role demand dimension, we elaborate this compari-\nson. We now compare those who are not caregivers to several\ndifferent groups of caregivers providing different amounts of\ncare. When we hold other variables constant, 7cg\nmates the net difference in CES-D scores, comparing those not\nproviding care to women providing care at the highest level. In\nModel 3, therefore, the net group differences depend on the\nlevel of demand. For remaining levels of caregiving, the net\ngroup difference is the sum of the coefficients for the dummy\nvariable caregiving (-.6944) and the coefficient for the speci-\nfied level of hours spent caregiving (8j). For example, between\nhours of care, the net difference on their expected symptom\nship between caregiving and CES-D scores occurs among\nwomen who spend the fewest hours in the role. Although all of\nthe coefficients are positive, only the lowest demand levels have\nsignificant coefficients.\nThe effects for employment are similarly constructed. Again,\nthe reference category represents the highest level of demand\n(more than 40 hours per week). The significant coefficient for\nthe dummy variable employed (-2.22) suggests that women\nworking the most demanding schedules have the lowest scores\non the CES-D subset scale.\nModels 4 and 5 add in role satisfaction measures ranging in\nvalue from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating the most satisfaction. As\nHRS provides measures of satisfaction specific to marriage and\njob, Model 4 adds in only those variables. In Model 5 we added\nproxy measures of satisfaction for the roles of caregiver and\nparent that were based on the respondent's satisfaction with\nfamily life. Although slightly more than one third of the care-\ngivers had children over age 18 in the home, only 6% of par-\nents with children over 18 in the home were also providing care\nto older parents. For these women (caregivers to both genera-\ntions), the measure of satisfaction for these two roles is identi-\ncal. Clearly, we would prefer separate measures for each role,\nbut they are not available.\nResults from Model 5 show that the average CES-D score is\nlower among employed women, married women, parents with\nchildren over age 18 in the home, and parental caregivers (in a\none-tailed test only) as their levels of satisfaction with these\nroles increase. Reviewing the coefficients for previously in-\ncluded variables, we find that, for the most part, patterns of ef-\nfects are unchanged. Examining the dummy variables for role\noccupancy, we find that (a) having older children in the home,\nand (b) the interaction between married and paid worker, are\nthe only statistically significant occupancy effects.\nAs an illustration of how these multiple-role dimensions can\nbe translated into various levels of depressive symptoms, con-\nsider three fictional women. All three are 55-year-old White\nwomen in good health, with 12 years of school, no children in\nthe home, and a household income of $36,000. The first\nwoman is married, employed, and working 30 hours per week,\na caregiver providing 150 hours of care each year, and has a\n19-year-old living in the household; she is very satisfied in all\nher roles. The second woman differs from the first only in that\nshe is not satisfied with any of her roles. The third woman is\nneither married nor employed, provides the lowest level of\ncare, and is not satisfied. Respectively, the predicted CES-D\nTable 3.

From these\nresults, it appears that role satisfaction measures capture di-\nmensions of the multiple role experience that would otherwise\nbe confounded or excluded. Women's sense of well-being is\nlinked not only to what roles they occupy and the demands\nthese roles place on them, but also to quality of their experi-\nences in these roles.\nAlternative models.--To test the robustness of these findings\nunder different sets of assumptions, we estimated models with\nthe same set of explanatory variables for alternative specifica-\ntions of the dependent variable. Results based on the natural log\nof the CES-D subset scores were consistent with the findings\nreported above. We also estimated binary logistic and multino-\nmial logistic models for categorizations of the dependent vari-\npoint scale to this 14-point subscale by straightforward\nable \"0\" if equal to or below the threshold of 11 (and therefore\nnonproblematic) and \"1\" if above the threshold of 11 (depicting\na potentially problematic level). Once again, the binary logit\nmodels essentially reproduced the findings from earlier models.\nHowever, results from the multinomial logistic regressions pro-\nvide some additional insight into the nature of these relation-\nships. From the CES-D, we constructed a 4-category dependent\nand higher. Multinomial logistic regression normalizes results\nrelative to the \"0\" category; therefore, estimation of the final\nmodel produces three sets of coefficients and standard errors.\nEach set of coefficients reports the net effects of the indepen-\ndent variable on the log-odds of being in categories 1, 2, or 3\n(respectively) versus category 0. In other words, the log-odds of\nreporting symptoms consistent with a score of 6 to 8 rather than\n0 to 5 (the lowest level of symptoms) are reported in the first\ncolumn of Table 4; effects on the log-odds of a score from 9 to\n11 versus 0 to 5 are reported in the second column; and effects\non the log-odds of a score 12 or higher versus 0 to 5 are re-\nported in the third column.\nWe can summarize the detailed findings reported in Table 4\nby categorizing independent variables into those that affect the\nlog-odds across the entire range of scores, those that affect the\nlog-odds toward the upper end of scores, and those that affect\nthe log-odds only at the extremes. Health, race, and job satis-\nfaction have consistent effects across the range of CES-D\nscores. Not only do these measures discriminate those with\nproblematic from nonproblematic levels of symptoms, but they\ndiscriminate among those with virtually no symptoms and\nthose with a low level of depressive symptomatology. Age, hav-\ning children over age 18 in the household, and family satisfac-\ntion (with children over 18) distinguish those with the lowest\nsymptoms from those with scores of 9 or higher (the upper two\ncategories). Finally, household income, education, working a\ntraditional full-time or part-time schedule (40 hours per week\nor 20-39 hours per week), supplying the lowest levels of care,\nand marital satisfaction are added to the previous list of vari-\nables, all of which discriminate those with the highest levels of\nsymptoms from those with the lowest levels of symptoms.\nTable 4.

Our findings show that only the combination of\nmarriage with employment interacts in this way; other combi-\nnations were not significant. Overall, these findings support the\nimportance of social integration for well-being, but suggest that\nthere may be a threshold effect: Being either married or em-\nployed is associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms,\nbut being both married and employed does not provide any ad-\nditional increment to well-being. Second, we hypothesized that\nthe effects of role occupancy measures would be translated\nthrough different indicators of demand and role satisfaction.\nOur findings support this view. Thus, although women's reports\nof depressive symptoms are linked to the kinds of roles they oc-\ncupy, role occupancy alone does not fully reflect the complex-\nity of the relationship of both demand levels and satisfaction to\nwell-being.\nThis analysis explores in more detail the nature of role expe-\nriences and how those experiences may be correlated with men-\ntal health. Roles that involve women outside of the home, such\nas employment, are positively linked to mental health. Further-\nmore, roles that integrate women into family settings, such as\nmarital status, may also have a positive relationship with mental\nhealth. However, in both cases the effects are indirect. Greater\nrole satisfaction is linked to lower depressive symptomatology\nand, in the case ofjob satisfaction, its effect is consistent across\nthe range of symptom levels.\nThe relationship between employment and well-being is of\nparticular interest. Women who work 20-40 hours per week ex-\npressed the highest level of symptoms. Based on this analysis,\nwe can only speculate as to why this may be the case. Some\npossibilities may be the nature of their work or their need for\nincome, and the possibility that they would prefer either to work\nmore or fewer hours. Indeed, the specific qualities of theirjobs\nmay be important predictors of their well-being. Job character-\nistics such as autonomy,flexibilitywith scheduling, and the ex-\ntent to which their employment promotes positive self-identity\nformation may affect how women experience their paid work\ntional sex segregation may also influence women's paid work\nexperiences because predominantly female jobs are often in-\nflexible and unaccommodating to family caregiving responsi-\nIt is unfortunate that this survey does not include specific\nmeasures of satisfaction with the informal caregiver role, nor\nwith the role of parent. Although results are consistent with ex-\npectations, the overlap among quality measures for family roles\ncomplicates the estimation. The pattern of the relationship be-\ntween well-being and caregiving demand remained U-shaped.\nAgain, we can only speculate that this pattern may involve\nsome necessary renegotiations of relationships between the\ncaregiver and the care recipient. Specifically, at the lowest lev-\nels of care, the care recipient may be adjusting to the transition\nfrom independence to partial dependency, while the caregiver is\nstruggling to define her responsibility and renegotiate a rela-\ntionship that takes this increased dependency into account. At\nhigher levels of care, the issue may be one of disability. Because\nthe caregiving measure was specifically limited to ADL assis-\ntance, the interventions are likely linked to health-related de-\nclines. Thus, the relationship between caregiver and care recipi-\nent may be strained as the family copes with anticipatory\nbereavement or faces questions of the need for professional\ncare or institutionalization (Abel, 1986).\nThe chronic role strains identified by Pearlin are useful for\ndescribing many informal caregivers' experiences. Pearlin\nviews informal caregiving as an extreme form of role restruc-\nturing, as changes in the parent-child relationship create stress\nfor the caregiver. The stress associated with role captivity may\nbe a reality for women who reluctantly assume the informal\ncaregiving role--and this may be especially true for women\nwho spend the least amount of time in the caregiving role.\nthe importance of coping strategies and social support as medi-\nators of informal caregivers' stress. While these dimensions of\ncaregivers' experiences are not included in this analysis, future\ninvestigations should explore these factors and their effects on\ncaregivers' mental health.\nLimits of the study.--Several limitations of this analysis\nmerit discussion. First, well-being is indicated only by the re-\nspondent's level of depressive symptomatology. There are other\ndimensions of well-being, such as self-esteem and the respon-\ndent's perception of the quality of her life in general, that would\nalso be useful indicators of well-being. Second, we are also\nlimited as to numbers of roles and an uneven coverage of levels\nof demand and role quality. Future data collection efforts that\ncarefully assess a more extensive repertoire of women's roles\nalong with associated levels of demand and quality of experi-\nence would be welcome. Third, this research is cross-sectional,\nand therefore cannot take into account preexisting emotional\nproblems or the conditions under which women undertake mul-\ntiple roles. For example, it is not possible to know whether\nwomen who have low levels of depressive symptoms take on\nroles because they are able to, or if having multiple roles lowers\nwomen's depressive symptomatology. Indeed, Moen and col-\nleagues (1995) found that the effects of caregiving on women's\nemotional health are moderated by their previous mental well-\nbeing. Further studies of these sorting processes are needed.\nFinally, although our analysis treated role quality dimensions as\nexogenous, future work will attempt to assess inherent endo-\ngeneities in these processes. Testing whether the complexity of\nrole sets, role demands, role satisfaction, and well-being are\njointly determined would be an appropriate next step in this\nresearch.\nContributions to the literature.--On the positive side, this re-\nsearch contributes to the literature on women's multiple roles in\nfour important ways. First, our sample is more readily general-\nizable to the population at large than many previous studies; the\nsample is representative of the population, includes a suffi-\nciently large number of minority women to allow an assess-\nment of racial/ethnic differences, and identifies a substantial\nnumber of caregivers to elderly parents. Second, this research\nadds to the role enhancement literature, which argues that en-\ngaging in multiple roles is not uniformly detrimental for\nwomen's well-being (Stoller & Pugliesi, 1989). Instead, as\nMoen and coworkers (1995) conclude, the answer to the role\nstrain versus role enhancement debate is that \"it depends\" (p.\n270). Third, our findings add support for and supplement the\n\"role spillover\" literature, which emphasizes the interrelations\nbetween roles (Parris Stephens & Franks, 1995; Parris Stephens\net al., 1994). Finally, we extend previous research by Baruch\nand Barnett (1986) by including role quality in our conceptual-\nization of women's multiple roles.\nThe present inquiry highlights the importance of respon-\ndents' perceptions of the quality of their roles. A realistic con-\nceptualization of women's lives must include the possibility of\nwomen assuming many combinations of these roles. Moreover,\nwe must examine not only how the roles may constrain or con-\nflict but also how women themselves manage their obligations.\nAs we attempt to understand how women juggle competing de-\nmands, how they are trapped in unsatisfactory situations, or\nhow they successfully weave together multiple threads of re-\nsponsibility, we must find better ways to assess not only the op-\nportunities and the constraints that women face, but also the re-\nsources that promote their well-being.\n"
