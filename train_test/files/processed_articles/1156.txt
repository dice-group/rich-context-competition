This study examines health inequality as a potential explanation for socioeconomic differences in age\nidentity. The following dimensions of health are examined: comparative self-rated health, self-assessed changes in\nphysiological well-being, prospective self-rated health, perceived control over health, chronic conditions, and\nparents' health. Components of health also are explored as possible mediators of age differences in the effect of\nsocioeconomic status on age identity.\nMethods. Using the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, ordinary least squares regression\nmodels of age identity are estimated for a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population between the\nResults. The older identities held by the less socioeconomically advantaged are explained by their worse health,\nparticularly their less favorable predictions of future health, compared with their wealthier peers. Differences in age\nidentity by education and perceived financial well-being are greatest among older adults; however, health only partially\naccounts for these age patterns.\nDiscussion. This study reveals that health inequalities shape the subjective experience of aging. Further work using\nlongitudinal data is needed to determine the precise causal pathways linking socioeconomic status, health, and age\nidentity.\nSOCIOECONOMIC status (SES) is a major factor shaping\nthe multiple strands of the life course, including family,\nwork, and health trajectories. An earlier onset of health\nlimitations and faster rate of decline in functional ability are\nfound among those of lower SES (House et al., 1994). In\naddition to facing earlier health decrements, they tend to\nexperience many of the transitions marking one's passage\nthrough the adult life course, such as the completion of\neducation, marriage, parenthood, and retirement, at younger\nages than their more advantaged peers (Axinn & Thornton,\nBecause it influences the timing of life transitions and rate of\nphysiological decline, SES is a primary determinant of the\nsubjective experience of aging; it shapes the way an individual\nthinks about age and the stages of life in general and his or\nher own age and life stage in particular. Compared with\ntheir wealthier counterparts, individuals of lower SES tend to\nperceive a more temporally compressed life course. They view\nthe onset of old age as occurring at a younger age, perceive\nearlier cultural age deadlines for many adult transitions, and\nanticipate a shorter life span (Mirowsky & Ross, 2000; Rosow,\npatterns, the less advantaged tend to adopt older age identities\nthan the more privileged (George, Mutran, & Pennybaker,\nOne may argue that these findings on the perceptions of\none's life course and age are not surprising or of much concern,\nbecause lower SES is, in fact, associated with earlier life course\ntransitions and shorter life expectancy. However, they can be\nviewed not only as mirrors of the objective reality of divergent\nlife course patterns that are produced in a highly economically\nstratified society, but also as indications of some of the\ndeleterious, psychological consequences of occupying a disad-\nvantaged position in such a society. Maintaining a youthful\nidentity as one ages has been viewed as a self-enhancing\nstrategy in a culture, like the dominant culture in the United\nStates, that highly values youth (Barak & Stern, 1986;\nMontepare & Lachman, 1989). Indeed, research indicates that\nbeginning in middle-age, Americans adopt increasingly youth-\nful identities (Goldsmith & Heiens, 1992; Montepare &\nLachman, 1989). Moreover, there is evidence that it is an\neffective means of self-enhancement: Adults with youthful\nidentities in middle and later life have better mental health, life\nsatisfaction, morale, and self-esteem (Barak & Stern, 1986).\nMembers of lower socioeconomic strata use this strategy to\na lesser degree; as a result, they are disadvantaged not only by\nobjective conditions of their lives (such as their health), but also\nby conceptions of their age.\nBecause the older identities of the less advantaged are\nindications of some of the harmful, but less visible, effects of\noccupying lower socioeconomic strata, this topic deserves more\nattention than it has received in the last decade or so. The link\nbetween SES and age identity has been well-documented;\nhowever, much less is known about the underlying social\npsychological mechanisms. Drawing on the strong relationships\nbetween social class and health (Adler et al., 1994; Williams &\nCollins, 1995) and between health and age identity (Logan,\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2003 by The Gerontological Society of America\nfocuses on dimensions of health as potential explanations for\nsocioeconomic differences in age identity. Of particular interest\nis not only objective and subjective health, but also multiple\npoints of reference for one's perceived health. Drawing on prior\nresearch reporting that socioeconomic differences in health\nstudy also examines potential age differences in the effect of\nSES on perceptions of one's age.\nSES and Age Identity\nResearch has found consistently that occupying lower\nsocioeconomic strata is associated with having older identities.\nCompared with the more advantaged, individuals of lower SES\nare more likely to classify themselves as ``old'' or ``elderly''\nthan their chronological age (Baum & Boxley, 1983; Steitz &\nMcClary, 1988). This pattern is found across indicators of SES,\nincluding education (Markides & Boldt, 1983; Steitz &\n& George, 1982). Subjective assessments of financial well-\nbeing have been rarely examined, and results have been\ninconsistent (Bultena & Powers, 1978; Steitz & McClary,\nMost of the explanations for the older identities of the more\ndisadvantaged center on class differences in the timing of social\nand biological aging. For example, Neugarten and Moore\n(1968) argue that the earlier timing of life events--such as\nmarriage, childbearing, and retirement--may account for the\nmore rapid pace of the subjective life course of those of lower\nSES. Although the temporal pattern of life transitions has not\nbeen examined empirically as an explanation for socioeco-\nnomic differences in age identity, some research exploring role\nlosses in later life supports this hypothesis. Some have found,\nfor example, that widowhood (George et al., 1980; Mutran &\nMutran & George, 1982) are associated with older identities;\nhowever, the findings have not been consistent (cf. Logan et al.,\nAnother explanation for social class differences in age\nidentity also rests on role transitions; however, it focuses on\nperceived losses associated with the transitions, rather than their\ntiming in the life course. Rosow (1967) posits that individuals\nof higher SES have ``more to lose'' by relinquishing younger\nidentities and their accompanying social resources. In other\nwords, role losses typically associated with later life, such as\nretirement, are more threatening to the status of middle class\nindividuals; therefore, they have a greater incentive to deny\ntheir age.\nHealth trajectories explanation.--In addition to the temporal\npattern and perception of family and work transitions, a third\nhypothesis has been offered regarding socioeconomic differ-\nences in age identity. Rosow (1967) has argued that occupying\nlower socioeconomic strata produces a more rapid rate of\nphysiological aging as a consequence of cumulative hardships\nover the life course; hence, older identities are found among the\nmost disadvantaged. The mediating role of health has received\nlimited attention in research; however, it is plausible given the\nassociations among social class, health, and age identity.\nResearch has found consistently that lower SES is related to\nworse physical health (Adler et al., 1994; Williams & Collins,\nManor, Matthews, & Power, 1997). Work on age identity has\nrevealed that worse health is associated with feeling older than\nand describing oneself as ``old'' (Logan et al., 1992; Markides\n& Boldt, 1983). This pattern has been found across a range of\nhealth indicators, including objective measures such as number\nand severity of chronic conditions and use of health services\nsubjective ratings of health (Baum & Boxley, 1983; Logan\net al., 1992). Corroborating the evidence from quantitative\nresearch, the qualitative work of Sherman (1994) reports that\nchanges in health are the most frequently cited reasons for\nbeginning to feel older.\nHealth has been treated largely as a control variable in\nstudies of age identity. The only work I have found that\nincludes analyses useful in examining the potential mediating\nrole of health is by Mutran and Burke (1979). Although not\na focus of their study, they find that education exerts an effect\non age identity through self-rated health. However, they use an\nindicator of age identity that differs from those most often used\nin subjective age research. In contrast with items that ask\nrespondents direct questions about their self-perceived ages, the\nauthors examine measures indicating the degree to which\nrespondents identify with characteristics stereotypically associ-\nated with older ages. It is not known whether similar results\nwould be found using indicators that more directly reflect\nperceptions of one's age.\nLimited attention has been given to the potential mediating\neffects of health; further, the relative importance of various\ndimensions of health in an individual's construction of sub-\njective age is not known. Objective and subjective di-\nmensions of health have been found to be predictors of age\nidentity; Ward and colleagues (1988) examine both and report\nthat they exert similarly strong effects. Other dimensions of\nhealth that may shape age identity have not been examined, in\nparticular those reflecting the multiple frames of reference that\nindividuals may use in evaluating their health.\nTheories of social evaluation and reference groups would\nsuggest that individuals construct their own age identities\nthrough a process of comparing the conditions of their lives,\nincluding their health, against same-age peers as well as more\ngeneralized images of persons in their stage of life (Festinger,\nexamined in some research on age identity: More favorable\nevaluations of one's health relative to peers are associated with\nyounger identities (Bultena & Powers, 1978; Logan et al.,\nspondents frequently made comparisons with same-age peers or\nfamily members in constructing their own age identities,\na recurring theme in her interviews that she refers to as the\n``comparative self.''\nFindings reported by Sherman (1994) point to other frames\nof reference that are relevant to examining the role of health in\nthe construction of subjective age. The ``retrospective self,'' or\nthe way one remembers oneself in younger years, suggests that\nperceptions of past health, perhaps as a point of comparison for\ncurrent health, may shape age identity. Perceptions of age may\nBARRETT\nbe influenced not only by one's remembered past health, but\nalso images of what one's health will be in the future.\nConsidering both the comparative and temporal elements of age\nidentity, one's images of future health may be shaped by\nperceptions of the health trajectories of one's parents or other\nrelatives. As Neugarten (1968) notes, people may begin in\nmiddle-age to identify with the older generation and wonder if\nthey will age in similar ways.\nIn addition to dimensions of comparative health, other\nperceptions that may influence age identity have not been\nexplored, including perceived control over health that is\npositively related to SES (Mirowsky, Ross, & Van Willigen,\n1996). Adopting a more youthful, and more age-discrepant,\nidentity can be seen as an active reinterpretation of one's\nchronological age; maintaining a youthful identity is likely to\nrequire a high degree of perceived control over one's health. As\nLinn and Hunter (1979, p. 50) note: ``If one is in poor health,\nuneducated, and poor, then feeling younger than one's age\nprobably takes a strong inner belief in one's ability to control\nlife events.''\nAge differences in the relationship between SES and age\nidentity.--Not only has limited attention been given to the\nprocess through which age identity is constructed, but also little\nis known about potential age differences in the effect of SES on\nage identity. It is well-documented that older persons adopt\nmore age-discrepant, youthful identities than those in midlife\n& Lachman, 1989), but is this pattern found across all\nsocioeconomic strata? The only work I have found that ex-\nplores the potential interactive effect of age and social class on\nage identity examines only two groups, those younger than 75\nand those 75 or older; this study finds that the effect of SES is\nstronger in the younger group (Rosow, 1967). More fine-\ngrained analyses, however, would help to identify points in the\nlife course at which members of lower socioeconomic strata are\nespecially disadvantaged by their views of their aging selves in\na culture valuing youth.\nAs individuals age, advantages held by members of higher\nsocioeconomic strata, such as having more financial resour-\nces and better health, become magnified (House et al., 1994;\ncumulative advantage and disadvantage hypothesis, this di-\nvergence in resources over the life course raises the pos-\nsibility that a similar process occurs in perceptions of age:\nSocioeconomic differences in age identity that produce older\nidentities among the less advantaged may be greatest in later\nstages of life. Considering this hypothesis in conjunction\nwith the strong link between health and age identity further\nsuggests that health may play a critical role in explaining\nage differences in the effect of SES on age identity. In other\nwords, the cumulative effects of poor health and more\nlimited access to health care among disadvantaged members\nof society may produce wider socioeconomic differences in\nage identity in later life.\nDrawing from prior research and the theoretical frameworks\nunderlying this study, the following hypotheses are made: (1)\nlower SES will be significantly associated with adopting an\nolder identity; (2) dimensions of health, both objective and\nsubjective, will partially mediate the effect of SES on age\nidentity; (3) the effect of SES on age identity will be strongest\namong older adults; and (4) dimensions of health, both\nobjective and subjective, will partially account for the stronger\neffect of SES on age identity among older adults.\nMETHODS\nSample\nData are drawn from the National Survey of Midlife\nDevelopment in the United States (MIDUS; Brim et al.,\nT. MacArthur Foundation Network on Successful Midlife\nDevelopment. The MIDUS sample (n 5 3,032) is representa-\ntive of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population between the\nages of 25 and 74 who have telephones. The sample was\ngenerated through random-digit dialing; older respondents and\nmen were oversampled. MIDUS involved a telephone interview\nand two self-administered mail-back questionnaires. The over-\nall response rate was 60.8%. Because MIDUS includes\nmeasures of age identity and self-assessed health, the data are\nappropriate for this study. However, a limitation is introduced\nby the use of cross-sectional data. The broad questions\nstimulating this research involve temporal processes. Social\nclass is hypothesized to affect health which, in turn, influences\nage identity. It is also expected that the effect of SES on age\nidentity becomes stronger as individuals age. Although findings\nmay be consistent with these age effects and causal pathways,\nalternative interpretations cannot be eliminated.\nOf the 3,032 respondents completing the telephone and mail-\nback surveys, 111 were not included because they were missing\non items used in the construction of the dependent variable (i.e.,\nchronological age or subjective age). To avoid the influence of\nextreme scores in the analyses, respondents with age identities\nfalling in the top or bottom 1% of the scores were excluded\nfrom the analyses yielding a study sample of 2,864. In analyses\npresented, data are weighted to adjust for selection probabilities\nand nonresponse.\nAs described in Table 1, age identity is indicated by the\ndifference between one's subjective and chronological age; on\naverage, respondents feel between 6 and 7 years younger than\ntheir actual age. Six measures of health are used: comparative\nself-rated health, self-assessed changes in physiological well-\nbeing, prospective self-rated health, perceived control over\nhealth, parents' health, and number of chronic conditions. The\nindicators of SES are education, household income, and\nperceived financial well-being. The following sociodemo-\ngraphic variables associated with age identity are included as\ncontrols: age, gender, and race (Barak & Stern, 1986). For each\nof the following variables, less than 5% of the sample contained\nmissing values, and means are used to impute values: race,\nincome, education, perceived financial well-being, comparative\nhealth, self-assessed physiological changes, prospective self-\nrated health, perceived control over health, and chronic\nconditions. Approximately 12% of the sample have missing\ndata on the status of one or both parents (typically the father);\nhowever, a third of these respondents report having a parent in\ngood health. These respondents are assigned to the ``no\nparent(s) in poor health'' category. Of the remaining respond-\nents missing on these variables, those age 65 or older are\nassigned to the ``both parents deceased'' category; those\nyounger than 65 are assigned to the ``no parent(s) in poor\nhealth'' group.\nAnalyses\nOrdinary least squares regression is used to examine the\neffect of SES on age identity. To explore the mediating effect of\nhealth, several models are run. First, age identity is regressed on\neducation, income, perceived financial well-being, age, gender,\nand race. Each health indicator is then entered in a separate\nstep. A final model includes all health measures. To examine\npotential age differences in the effect of SES on age identity,\ninteractive models are run. Three interaction terms are added,\none at a time, to the model containing age, gender, race, and the\nindicators of SES: age*education, age*income, and age*per-\nceived financial well-being. To reduce multicollinearity,\nvariables are centered at the mean before constructing the\ninteraction terms. In the last stage of analyses, the potential\nmediating effect of health on the interaction between age and\nSES is examined by entering each of the health measures in\na separate step. In tables reporting the results of regression\nanalyses, mediating effects are indicated by the difference\nbetween coefficients from the baseline model (Model 1 in each\ntable) and coefficients generated in each subsequent model.\nRESULTS\nTable 2 reports the results of the regression of age identity on\nSES and the health measures. Model 1 reveals that older\nchronological age is associated with reporting a younger\nidentity; however, the effect of age is weaker at older ages.\nBeing non-White and having more education and better\nfinancial well-being are predictive of more youthful identities.\nIn Models 2\u00ad7, all the health measures reach significance;\nhowever, the magnitude of the role they play in the process\nlinking SES and age identity varies. Model 2 indicates that\nmore favorable assessments of one's health compared with\npeers are related to more youthful identities. For example,\nhaving ``much better'' health than one's peers is associated with\nan age identity that is approximately 2 years younger than that\nreported by individuals with only ``somewhat better'' health.\nMoreover, the coefficient for education falls by 50% and is no\nVariable Description Range Mean (Standard Deviation)\nAge identity Subjective age-chronological age, in which subjective age is\nthe response to the following: ``Many people feel older or\nyounger than they actually are.

The results indicate that the more advantaged\nhave younger identities, in part, because they make more\nfavorable comparisons of their health with that of their peers.\nModel 3 reveals that more positive assessments of one's\nrecent physiological changes are associated with younger\nidentities, and they partially mediate the effect of financial\nwell-being on age identity (i.e., the coefficient declines by\n25%). However, this variable slightly suppresses the effect of\neducation on age identity. Contrary to expectations, higher\nlevels of education are associated with less favorable assess-\nments of recent physiological changes.\nModel 4 indicates that each 1 point increase in anticipated\nfuture health on the 10-point scale is associated with an age\nidentity that is 1 year younger. Of all the dimensions of health\nexamined, the largest mediating effects are found for pro-\nspective self-rated health. The coefficients for education and\nperceived financial well-being do not reach significance. In\nother words, the less favorable predictions of one's health in the\nfuture made by individuals of lower SES play a large role in\nexplaining their older identities.\nMediating effects also are observed with the addition of\nperceived control over health (Model 5); however, the\nmagnitude of the effects varies across indicators of SES. The\ncoefficient for perceived financial well-being falls by 48%, but\nthe effect of education declines by only 13%. Not only are\nsubjective indicators of health part of the process linking SES\nand age identity, but also the number of chronic conditions\nplays a mediating role (Model 6); with the inclusion of chronic\nconditions, the effect of education declines by 29% and\nperceived financial well-being by 40%.\nModel 7 indicates that, controlling for respondent's age,\nthose reporting a parent in poor health have age identities that\nare approximately 1 year older on average than those of\nrespondents without a parent in poor health. Although the effect\nof self-reported parents' health is significant, it is not part of the\nprocess linking SES and age identity; the coefficients for the\nsocioeconomic variables change little with the addition of\nparents' health into the model.\nThe last model in Table 2 includes all the health measures.\nThe effects of neither education nor financial well-being are\nsignificant, indicating that the generally worse health of those\noccupying lower socioeconomic positions accounts for their\nolder identities. Further, it is noted that the explained variance\nincreases by approximately 50%, reflecting the importance of\nhealth in the construction of age identities.\nAlthough not the central foci of this paper, several other\nfindings are noted. Comparative self-rated health and chronic\nTable 2.

Health is involved also in the\nprocess linking race and age identity. In brief, race differences\nin comparative self-rated health appear to play an important\nrole in explaining the younger identities reported by non-White\nrespondents. Contrary to the findings of other work (e.g.,\nMutchler & Burr, 1991), non-White respondents in the MIDUS\nsample report significantly better comparative self-rated health\nthan White respondents.\nSignificant interactions of age with education (Table 3;\nModel 1) and perceived financial well-being (Table 4; Model\n1), but not household income (not shown), are found. As\nFigures 1 and 2 illustrate, among younger respondents,\ndifferences in age identity by level of education or financial\nwell-being are minimal. Wider differences are found among\nolder respondents.\nIn contrast to the main effects models (Table 2), health plays\na more limited role in explaining the wider socioeconomic\ndifferences in age identity among older respondents. As\nreported in the last column of Table 3, no change is observed\nin the coefficient for the interactive effect of age and education\n(bae\n) when all health measures are added. Only one measure,\nprospective self-rated health, exerts a mediating effect, and the\neffect is fairly small. Health plays a larger role in explaining the\ninteractive effect of age and perceived financial well-being on\nage identity. With all of the health measures included (Table 4;\nModel 8), the coefficient for the interactive effect of age and\nfinancial well-being (bap\n) is reduced by 25%. Models entering\none health measure at a time reveal that chronic conditions and\nprospective self-rated health are the components of health\nacting as mediators. Prospective health, as found in the main\neffects model (Table 2; Model 4), exerts a strong mediating\neffect; with the inclusion of this health measure, the coefficient\nfor the interactive effect of age and perceived financial well-\nbeing does not reach significance. Consistent with age patterns\nin age identity observed across levels of education and financial\nwell-being, socioeconomic differences in prospective self-rated\nhealth are greatest in later life.\nDISCUSSION\nInterpreting youthful constructions of one's age as a means\nof enhancing self-esteem in a society valuing youth, the\nfindings of this study suggest that individuals of lower\nsocioeconomic strata, especially those in later life, are\nTable 3.

The findings\nare consistent with prior research revealing that the less\nadvantaged tend to have older identities than their more\nprivileged peers (e.g., Baum & Boxley, 1983; Markides &\nBoldt, 1983). Moreover, the observation that health accounts\nfor the main effect of SES, as indicated by education and\nperceptions of economic well-being, on age identity parallels\nthe patterns found in the only published work in which this\nrelationship could be examined, that of Mutran and Burke\n(1979), which reports that self-rated health mediates the effect\nof education on age identity. Because this prior work uses\na more indirect measure of age identity (i.e., an individual's\nidentification with characteristics stereotypically associated\nwith old age), the results of the present study indicate that\nthis pattern is also found for more direct measures of age\nidentity.\nBy examining multiple dimensions of health, this study\nextends the literature by providing further clues about the\nprocess through which one's position in systems of stratifica-\ntion affects the subjective experience of aging. Although most\nof the dimensions of health examined in this study emerge as\nmediators of the main effect of SES on age identity, the\nfindings indicate that the less advantaged have older identities\nprimarily because they hold less optimistic views of their\nhealth. Future work should give closer attention to the\nprocesses of social comparison underlying this relationship.\nHow do individuals form predictions about their future health,\nand how is this process shaped by socioeconomic position?\nImmediate interpersonal environments and generalized images\nof women and men in various life stages should be examined as\npossible mechanisms through which individuals' socioeconom-\nic positions shape the assessments that they make of their\nexperiences of aging, including expectations of health declines.\nIn addition to illuminating the process through which SES\ninfluences age identity, this study finds that socioeconomic\ndifferences in age identity, as indicated by education and\nperceived financial well-being, are greatest among older adults.\nThis pattern is consistent with the cumulative advantage and\ndisadvantage hypothesis that has been examined more\nextensively in work on the objective experience of aging, such\nas functional health (House et al., 1994) and income (O'Rand,\n1996). The findings of this study suggest that the concept may\nalso be applicable to subjective dimensions of aging: Higher\nTable 4.

However, other interpretations of the findings are\nplausible because the data are cross-sectional. Rather than\nreflecting a process occurring as individual age, the youthful\nidentities and wide socioeconomic differences in age identity\nobserved among older respondents in this study may reflect\nperiod or cohort effects; these patterns may describe today's\nolder adults but not future cohorts. Challenging this in-\nterpretation, however, is the persistence of two social phe-\nnomena, negative views of aging and economic inequality.\nAlthough these trends suggest that youthful identities and\nsocioeconomic differences in health and age identity will be\nfound in future cohorts of older adults, answering this question\nwill require further investigation using longitudinal data.\nThe cross-sectional data used in this study introduce other\nlimitations. Although the findings suggest that health is part of\nthe process linking SES and age identity, causal order cannot be\ndetermined by this study. In particular, there is likely to be\na reciprocal relationship between age identity and health; not\nonly does health affect age perceptions, but having a more\nyouthful identity may lead to behaviors, such as exercise, that\nare health-enhancing. Nearly all reported work on age identity\nuses cross-sectional data; longitudinal data will permit the\ncausal relationships to be more clearly identified.\nSubsequent research on age identity also should examine\nexplanations for the stronger effect of SES on age identity in\nlater life. This study finds that, although health accounts for the\nmain effect of SES on age identity, it only partially explains the\nobserved age differences. Socioeconomic differences in age\nidentity are widest in later life, in part, because the\ndisadvantaged elderly have more chronic conditions and hold\nmore pessimistic views of their future health, compared with\ntheir wealthier peers. In exploring possible explanations for the\nobserved age patterns, other hypotheses should be considered\nthat have been offered in the literature, in particular, those\nhinging on social class differences in the timing of adult\ntransitions and the perceived losses associated with these\ntransitions.\n"
