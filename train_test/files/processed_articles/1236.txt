Schwartz2\n1Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin and 2Departments of Cancer\nBiology and Epidemiology and Prevention, Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Winston-Salem, North Carolina\n Introduction\nProstate cancer is the second most fatal cancer among\nmen in the United States, accounting for f28,000 deaths\nin 2008 (1). Considerable epidemiologic attention in\nprostate cancer has focused on the vitamin D\u00adendocrine\nsystem and on calcium (2\u00ad4). Although numerous\nstudies have investigated prostate cancer with respect\nto calcium intake from the diet, the subject of calcium\nin serum has received scarce attention, perhaps because\ncalcium levels in serum are believed to be under strict\nhomeostatic control. In the only study to specifically\naddress this question, we found an f3-fold increased\nrisk of fatal prostate cancer in the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemio-\nlogic Follow-up Study for men with levels of total serum\ncalcium in the upper tertile at the baseline exam (5). In\nthis article, we confirm and extend that finding using\nan independent cohort, the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). A unique\nfeature of NHANES III is that it included measurements\nof ionized serum calcium, the physiologically active\nfraction of total serum calcium.\nMaterials and Methods\nData were derived from NHANES III, which provides\npublic use mortality files with record linkage of\nparticipants in NHANES III to the National Death Index\n(6). Eight thousand one hundred twenty-five men partici-\npated in NHANES III. We excluded men with missing\ninformation on serum calcium (n = 1,210), a prior history\nof cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer; n = 199),\nmen who died from prostate cancer within 12 months\nof examination (n = 2), and men without follow-up\ninformation (n = 4). The final analytic cohort consisted of\nin serum could be influenced by the presence of\nundetected prostate cancer, we did additional analyses\nexcluding prostate cancer deaths that occurred during\nthe first 3 years of follow-up (n = 8).\nWe evaluated associations between prostate cancer\nmortality, total serum calcium, and ionized serum\ncalcium corrected for serum pH. Approximately half of\nthe total serum calcium is in the ionized or physiolog-\nically active state. Another 40% is bound to serum\nproteins, principally albumin, and the remaining 10% is\nbound to anions, such as lactate and phosphate. Because\nthe binding of calcium to proteins is altered by changes\nin blood pH, measures of ionized calcium in blood are\ncommonly pH corrected to a standard pH using\nregression analysis (7).\nPerson-time was computed as the number of months\nfrom initial examination to date of prostate cancer\nmortality (events), death from another cause, or the end\nestimated relative risks adjusted for potential confound-\ners using Cox proportional hazards.

Conversely, there is considerable variation in\ncalcium levels between individuals, with normal levels\nof total serum calcium ranging from 8.5 to 10.5 mg/dL\nThis study has several strengths. It is hypothesis\ntesting, is prospective, and uses a population that is\nrepresentative of the U.S. population. The greatest threat\nto the validity of prospective cohort studies, loss to\nMeasurement of calcium in serum preceded death from\nprostate cancer by an average of 5.3 years (SD 2.5).\nBecause the latency between blood draw and death was\nrelatively short, the presence of occult prostate cancer\ncould have influenced the levels of calcium in serum\n(i.e., ``reverse causality''). However, this possibility likely\nwould reduce the relative risks because men with ad-\nvanced prostate cancer typically are normocalcemic or\nhypocalcemic due to the transfer of calcium ions from\nserum into bony metastases (12, 13). To address this\npossibility, we analyzed the data after excluding fatal\nprostate cancers that occurred within 36 months of the\nbaseline examination. Compared with men in the lowest\ntertile of ionized serum calcium, the relative hazard for\nfatal prostate cancer for men in the middle tertile was\nan unlikely explanation for the positive association\nbetween ionized serum calcium and prostate cancer\nmortality.\nOur results could be influenced by misclassification\nand by confounding. The use of total serum calcium as\nan exposure variable is subject to misclassification\nbecause f50% of the total calcium in serum is non-\nionized and is physiologically inert (11). The potential\nmisclassification associated with ionized serum calcium,\nthe physiologically active fraction of total serum calcium,\nis far smaller. This is consistent with our finding of a\nsubstantially higher relative risk of prostate cancer in\nrelation to ionized serum calcium than in relation to total\nserum calcium (RR, 3.2 versus 2.1, respectively).\nFatal prostate cancer was measured using record\nlinkage between NHANES III and the National Death\nIndex. To preserve the privacy of participants in\nNHANES III, an algorithm applied to the Public Use\nMortality Data files randomly reassigned the cause of\ndeath for some participants, a procedure that may have\nintroduced some misclassification. Because the misclas-\nsification was nondifferential with respect to exposure,\nit should underestimate the true association between\nserum calcium and prostate cancer mortality. Finally,\nseveral epidemiologic studies have implicated vitamin D\ndeficiency as a risk factor for prostate cancer (2). Vitamin\nD deficiency is unlikely to confound the observed\nassociation between prostate cancer and high serum\ncalcium because vitamin D deficiency is associated with\nnormocalcemia or hypocalcemia (11).\nIn persons without cancer, most cases of serum\ncalcium that are elevated outside the reference range\nare caused by elevated serum levels of parathyroid\nhormone; (PTH), i.e., primary hyperparathyroidism\n(11). Similarly, some persons with serum calcium levels\nthat are elevated but within the reference range may\nhave ``high normal'' levels of serum PTH. It is therefore\nunclear whether the mechanism for the increased risk of\nfatal prostate cancer that we observed in association with\nelevated serum calcium involves elevated serum calci-\num, elevated serum PTH, or both factors. There are\nplausible mechanisms by which either high levels of\ncalcium or PTH could each increase prostate cancer\nmortality (14). For example, prostate cancer cells express\nthe calcium-sensing receptor and the common receptor\nfor PTH and parathyroid hormone-related protein\n(PTHrP). At physiologic levels, both calcium and PTH\npromote the proliferation and metastasis of prostate\nRelatively small differences in the levels of ionized\ncalcium in serum were associated with large differences\nin the risk of fatal prostate cancer. The effects of small\ndifferences in the levels of ionized serum calcium could\nbe magnified at sites of bony metastases via feed-forward\nmechanism. As shown by Sanders et al., ionized calcium\nin serum induces prostate cancer cells to synthesize\nPTHrP, which causes local osteolysis of bone, resulting in\ngreatly elevated levels of extracellular calcium within the\nbony microenvironment (16). Whereas ionized calcium\nin serum normally circulates at 1.1 to 1.3 mmol/L, levels\nof extracellular calcium in the bony microenvironment\nof metastatic prostate cancer cells may reach 8 to\n40 mmol/L (17). These high levels of extracellular\ncalcium then elicit further secretion of PTHrP by prostate\ncancer cells which exacerbates the progression of\nosteolytic and osteoblastic metastases (18).\nOur results may help to resolve some discrepant\nfindings in the literature on dietary calcium and prostate\na positive association between high levels of dietary\ncalcium, from food and from supplements, and ad-\nvanced and/or fatal prostate cancer. For example, in the\nHealth Professionals Follow-up Study, Giovannucci et al.\nfound a significantly increased risk of advanced and fatal\nrecommended allowance for calcium for men ages\nepidemiologic studies reporting more moderate intakes\nof dietary calcium have not found significantly elevated\nCalcium levels in serum are tightly controlled over a\nwide range of dietary calcium and generally are not\ncorrelated with dietary intake of calcium (22, 23).\nHowever, the consumption of large quantities of calcium\n(e.g., via self-medication with calcium supplements, such\nas calcium-containing antacids) can cause hypercalcemia\nin some individuals (24). Thus, we hypothesize that\ncalcium intakes that exceed the recommended allowance\nmay increase the risk of fatal prostate cancer because\nthese intakes may increase the levels of calcium in serum.\nOur results are based on a small number of deaths\n(n = 25) and the confidence intervals around the relative\nrisks are relatively large. Thus, these findings require\nconfirmation by other prospective studies. If confirmed,\nour finding that prediagnostic levels of ionized calcium\nin serum strongly predict risk of fatal prostate cancer\nhas important implications for clinical decision making\nand for prostate cancer prevention. For example,\nmost incident prostate cancers that are detected using\nCancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention\nResearch.\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\nprostate-specific antigen screening would not prove fatal\nif untreated. Thus, deciding which screen-detected\ncancers need treatment is intensely problematic (25).\nHigh levels of serum calcium significantly predicted fatal\nbut not incident prostate cancer in NHANES I and\nsignificantly predicted fatal prostate cancer in NHANES\nIII (for which data on incident cancers are not available).\nThis suggests that in addition to other clinical variables,\nthe knowledge of a man\u00b6s serum calcium level could\ncontribute to informed decisions about whether his\ncancer is likely to be life-threatening and therefore\nrequire therapy. Because the relative risks associated\nwith elevated serum calcium are high and because levels\nof calcium in serum can be changed (13), further study\nof the role of serum calcium in the natural history of\nprostate cancer should be a research priority.\nDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest\nNo potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.\n"
