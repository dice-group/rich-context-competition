Substantial con-\ntroversy among surgeons regarding the opti-\nmal fixation pattern (plate fixation [PF] or\nintramedullary fixation [IF]) of these injuries\nexists and further research on better treat-\nment options is needed.\nTo date, multiple forms of plating and\nintramedullary devices have been used to fix\nmidshaft clavicle fractures, including pre-\ncontoured dynamic compression plates\n(DCP), use of a reconstruction plate for\nPF and Knowles pinning, elastic stable\nintramedullary nailing with a Rockwood\nclavicle pin and an Acumed clavicle rod for\nIF9\u00ad12. PF is a popular technique providing\na rigid fix, allowing early rehabilitation\nprotocols.13 A precontoured plate, designed\nto parallel the S-shaped curve of the clavicle,\nhas become a popular PF pattern. However,\nextensive soft-tissue dissection, implant\nprominence, postoperative infection, scar-\nring, hardware failure and refracture after\nthe removal of the plate are all negative\nfactors for PF.14\u00ad17 With IF, the soft tissue\nenvelope, periosteum and vascular integrity\ncan be preserved,18,19 early hardware migra-\ntion appears to be solved by an improved\nlocked intramedullary device, but the issue\nof low biomechanical stability remains.20\nBarlow et al.21 and Houwert et al.22 have\nconducted relevant systematic reviews com-\nparing IF and PF methods of midshaft\nclavicle fracture repair, but with qualitative\nand equivocal conclusions.

An electronic\nliterature search was performed in PubMed\u00d5,\nMedline\u00d5, Embase and the Chinese National\nKnowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), to identify\nrelevant studies published between January\nwords were used: `clavicular' or `clavicle' and\n`midshaft' and `fracture' and `intramedullary'\nand `plate' or `plating' and `complications'\nor `effectiveness' or `results' or `outcome'. A\nmanual search of references in the included\noriginal articles or systematic reviews was also\nperformed, to identify any potential add-\nitional studies.\nInclusion criteria\nTwo reviewers (H.G., T. Z.) independently\nevaluated the titles and abstracts of the\nidentified papers. Only full text articles with-\nout language restriction were included in this\nmeta-analysis. Disagreements were resolved\nthrough discussion; if they remained unre-\nsolved, a third reviewer was consulted.\nInclusion criteria were RCTs or case\u00adcontrol\nor cohort studies comparing the outcomes of\ntwo methods for treating midshaft clavicular\nfractures, at least one set of results in each\npaper had to be original, the age of partici-\npants in both groups had to be <65 years\n(young, active participants), participants in\nstudies were followed up for !12 months and\nsufficient data were provided to estimate the\nodds ratio (OR) or standardized mean dif-\nference (SMD) with 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs).\nQuality assessment and data extraction\nThe quality of studies was evaluated by\nthe tool recommended in the Cochrane\nHandbook 5.1.0: `The Cochrane collabor-\nation's tool for assessing risk of bias', which\nwas used by Fang et al.29 This scale includes\nsix major potential sources of bias, including\nsequence generation, allocation concealment,\nblinding, incomplete data, selective outcome\nreporting and other outcomes reporting.\nData were carefully and independently\nabstracted from eligible studies by the same\ntwo reviewers (H.G., T.Z.). The following\nbasic characteristics were abstracted from\neach study: first author's name; publication\nyear; patients' age and sex; follow-up dur-\nation; definition and numbers in each IF and\nPF group; the number of studies providing\ninformation for each surgical method.\nStatistical analyses\nOdds ratios and 95% CI were estimated\nand pooled across studies to assess for\nany differences between the two methods.\nA P-value < 0.05 was considered significant.\nHeterogeneity among studies was tested by\nand further measured by I2 statistics, with\nI2 > 50% indicating significant inconsistency.\nA random-effects model was used to calculate\npooled ORs in the case of significant hetero-\na fixed-effects model was used.31 The out-\ncome of the meta-analysis for variables was\nsummarized graphically using forest plots.\nPublication bias was assessed and presented\nusing funnel plots.

The American Shoulder\nand Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scale37 is a\ncommon tool to assess shoulder function\nrecovery. Narsaria et al.24 reported that the\nASES score at the 24-month postoperative\nfollow-up was slightly higher in PF patients\nthis finding was not significantly different.\nDiscussion\nMidshaft clavicle fracture has traditionally\nbeen treated conservatively, without sur-\ngery, but this method has a high rate of\ncomplications.6,8 Surgery appears to offer a\nbetter alternative for fractures of this type.38\nHowever, there is controversy regarding\nwhether IF or PF provides the optimum\noutcome for patients. In this study, a meta-\nanalysis of 12 original studies was used to\naddress this key issue. The results showed\nthat IF outperformed PF, with a lower rate\nof symptomatic hardware, less hypertrophic\nscarring, fewer refractures after implant\nremoval and better functional outcome at\nthe 6-month follow-up. Other complications\n(including overall complications, implant fail-\nure, nonunion, malunion, delayed union, the\nneed for major revision surgery, temporary\nbrachial plexus lesion and reduced shoulder\nmotion) showed no significant difference\nbetween the methods.\nSurgeons commonly pay more attention\nto patients' complications that might affect\nprognosis and functional recovery; severe\ncomplications may cause secondary sur-\nincidence was more likely in the PF group\ncomplications of acute midshaft clavicular\nfracture in active young patients were due to\nsurgical procedures and the actual implant\nitself, and less associated with the patients'\nunderlying diseases. In this study, three\nimplant-related complications: symptomatic\nhardware, hypertrophic scarring and refrac-\nture after implant removal were all more\nlikely to occur in PF rather than IF groups.\nAs PF generally requires a large incision,\nextensive exposure and soft tissue dissection,\nthis technique is more likely to produce\nhypertrophic scarring, compared with IF. In\nsustained symptomatic hardware or incision\ncomplications, which were attributed to\nintraoperative traction and/or stretching of\nthe nerves over the plate. Refracture after\nhardware removal was reported to occur only\nin patients treated with plates, with an overall\noccurring at the junction of the middle-third\nand outer-third regions of the clavicle.\nImplant removal after fracture healing\nreduces the mechanical strength of the clav-\nicle, and the screw holes create weak spots in\nthis thin bone, which together may initiate\nImplant failure is an important complica-\ntion that affects operative success and causes\nover 80% of the revision surgery for midshaft\nclavicular fractures.28 In this analysis, the\nincidence of implant failure was similar in\nboth techniques. In PF, implant failure was\nmainly triggered by excessive movement and\noften manifested as plate bending or loosen-\ning; in IF, lack of stability caused migration of\nthe intramedullary device.40,41 Therefore, to\nprevent this complication, the stability of IF\nneeds to be improved, and excessive move-\nment, especially in the early stages of recovery\nNo significant difference was observed in\nshoulder motion range and functional\nrecovery between IF and PF, except for the\nConstant Score at the 6-month follow-up.\nThis suggests that IF is more likely than PF\nto yield a better early functional outcome,\nbut there is no difference between the tech-\nniques at the bone union stage and the late\nstage of recovery. In some studies, rapid\nunion has been confirmed with IF, which\nmight be important in functional recovery\nThe present study suffers from some weak-\nnesses. Firstly, only four prospective RCTs\nwere included in this meta-analysis, which\nmight lower the power. Secondly, the types of\nfixations applied in the studies were varied and\nthe follow-up periods of each study ranged\nwidely. Thirdly, the age of patients in each\ngroup was not similar, except for one study.\nThe choice of treatment was decided by the\ndemands of each treatment, the surgeons'\nexperience and the patients underlying med-\nical conditions. Advanced age generally has a\nnegative effect on the level of function\nrestored, and this aspect needs further future\nstudy.\nAlthough this study had limitations that\nwere unavoidable, it still has merit. First, the\nsearch style using both the computer and\nmanual searching ensures a complete inclu-\nsion of relevant studies. Secondly, no sig-\nnificant heterogeneity was observed in most\nvariables, except for active external rotation.\nThis heterogeneity was diminished by sensi-\ntivity analysis, without altering the result.\nLastly, but most importantly, this is the first\nquantitative meta-analysis to date to give a\ndefinitive preference to one of the two\nmethods for treating complex fractures of\nthe proximal humerus, reflecting the current\nstatus of this issue.\nIn conclusion, based on present evidence,\nIF appears to be superior to PF for the\nmanagement of midshaft clavicle fractures.\nCompared with PF, IF provides a better\nshoulder constant score at 6 months and\nfewer incidences of symptomatic hardware,\nrefracture after hardware removal and\nhypertrophic scarring. This could aid sur-\ngeons in making decisions for fixing mid-\nshaft clavicular fractures.\n"
