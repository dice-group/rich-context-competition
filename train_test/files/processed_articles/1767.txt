Blacks have higher rates of vitamin D deficiency than non-Hispanic whites, and vita-\nmin D deficiency has been associated with CRC. The authors of this report investigated the association of vitamin D\ndeficiency with excess risk for CRC mortality for blacks in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) that was conducted from 1988 to 1994. METHODS: The association between serum 25(OH)D levels and\nCRC mortality and its contribution to elevated risk among blacks were studied using baseline data from NHANES III\nand CRC mortality data through 2006 from the National Death Index. By using survival models, the adjusted risk of\ndeath from CRC for African Americans was examined with and without adjusting for vitamin D deficiency, which was\ndefined as an 25(OH)D level <20 ng/dL. RESULTS: Black race (hazard ratio [HR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval [95%\nof CRC (HR, 7.22; 95% CI, 2.12-24.6) predicted CRC mortality. When added to the model, vitamin D deficiency was\nassociated significantly with CRC mortality (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.11-4.00), and the effect of race was decreased (HR,\nobserved when participants who had a history of CRC were excluded from the analysis.

Black Americans have significantly lower mean serum levels of vitamin D than whites across the life-\nspan.10,11 This difference is attributable largely to darker skin pigmentation, which reduces the activation of oral vitamin\nD,12 in addition to lower intake of foods that contain vitamin D13 and less sun exposure.14\nGrowing observational data suggest that low serum vitamin D levels are associated with colonic adenomas, CRC,\nand CRC mortality.15-18 The International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization reviewed\nevidence and concluded that evidence for vitamin D levels in reducing cancer risk was strongest for CRC, but randomized\ncontrolled trials were needed to confirm a causal role.19 Thus, if causality can be established, then it is plausible that low\nvitamin D levels might contribute to the observed racial disparity in CRC mortality.20,21\n(wileyonlinelibrary.com)\nCorresponding author: Kevin Fiscella, MD, MPH, Department of Family Medicine, University of Rochester, 1381 South Avenue, Rochester, NY 14620; Fax: (585)\n1Department of Family Medicine, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York; 2Department of Community and Preventive Medicine, University of Rochester,\nRochester, New York; 3Center for Healthcare Policy and Research, University of California at Davis, Davis, California; 4Department of Pediatrics, University of Cali-\nfornia at Davis, Davis, California; 5Department of Surgery, Colorectal Division, University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan; 6Department of\nFamily and Community Medicine, University of California at Davis, Davis, California\nOriginal Article\nThe objective of the current study was to test the hy-\npothesis that low serum vitamin D levels may help to\nexplain the correlation between black race and CRC mor-\ntality. Specifically, we examined whether vitamin D defi-\nciency assessed at baseline in a national US sample would\nbe associated with CRC mortality and whether this associ-\nation may partly mediate the racial disparity in CRC\nmortality.\nParticipants\nWe constructed a retrospective cohort using publicly\navailable data from the nationally representative Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III), which was conducted from 1988 to\n!20 years who participated in the baseline examination\nand were eligible for mortality follow-up. Serum\ncorresponding to 95.2% of the target population\n(weighted).\nVitamin D\nSerum 25(OH)D was measured using a radioimmunoas-\nsay kit (DiaSorin, Stillwater, Minn).23 Although 1,25-\ndihydroxyvitamin D is the biologically active form of vita-\nmin D, serum 25(OH)D is regarded as the best indicator\nof vitamin D status in individuals without kidney dis-\nease.24 We defined vitamin D deficiency based on a\nlowest quintile in the NHANES sample.\nRace and Ethnicity\nWe assessed race and ethnicity based on self-reported race\nand ethnicity (white, black, Latino, and other).\nCRC Deaths\nAssessment of death continued from data collection until\nLinked Mortality file from the National Death Index\nusing International Statistical Classification of Diseases,\nwas based on codes C18 through C21.

These included educational level\n(<high school, high school, or >high school),27 house-\nhold income as a percentage of the Federal Poverty Level\n!300%),28 health insurance status (insured or unin-\nfasting glucose level >126 mg/dL, or glycohemoglobin\n>6%),33 physical activity level (both self-reported physi-\ncal inactivity [about the same or less than most individu-\nals] and average metabolic equivalent task score per\nmonth),33 alcohol intake (g/day),33 dietary calcium intake\n(g/day),34 meat intake (servings/day),33 dietary fiber\nintake (g/day),35 and dietary saturated fat intake\n(g/day).36 We also included the region of the country (a\nseries of dummy variables) and the month of vitamin D\ntesting. Region is associated with vitamin D levels because\nof differences in sunlight (ie, ultraviolet [UV] radiation\nexposure)2 and with rates of CRC screening.37 Vitamin D\nlevels fluctuate according to the time of year because of\ndifferences in UV exposure.2 We also included a dichoto-\nmous variable for reported history of CRC at baseline.\nStatistical Analyses\nAnalyses were conducted with the SUDAAN (version,\n10.01; RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC)\nand Stata (version 10.1; Stata, Inc., College Station, Tex)\nstatistical software packages. The analyses were adjusted\nfor the complex survey design of NHANES III to yield\nappropriate standard errors and population parameter\nestimates.\nWe implemented Cox semiparametric proportional\nhazards survival analyses and compared the results with\nproportional hazards parametric log-linear (Poisson)\nregression models.38,39 In the Poisson models, each indi-\nvidual contributed an observation for each full or partial\nyear of follow-up, and offset terms were used to control\nfor variations in observation lengths. The adjusted hazard\nratios (HRs) estimated in the Cox models were very simi-\nlar to the adjusted incidence rate ratios estimated in the\nPoisson models. The parametric Poisson models were\ndeveloped because they allow formal statistical compari-\nson of parameter estimates among nested models. Two\nmain models were developed. Model 1 excluded vitamin\nOriginal Article\nD, and Model 2 included vitamin D. The parameter esti-\nmates for black individuals from the 2 Poisson models\nwere compared using the method of Clogg et al40 as a test\nfor the hypothesis that vitamin D partly mediates the\nincreased CRC mortality risk for African Americans.41\nThe percentage attenuation was defined as 100*(bModel 1\n\u00c0 bModel 2\n)/(bModel 1\n), where b is the parameter estimate\nfor black race.\nIndependent variables that were included in the\nanalyses were age, sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic\nwhite, black, Hispanic, and other), and serum 25(OH)D\ndeficiency (present or absent). To minimize bias from\nmissing data and avoid over fitting, we omitted potentially\nconfounding variables that met the following criteria: 1) P\nvalues >.20 and 2) an effect on the parameter estimates of\n25(OH)D or race by <10%. The final model included\neducation, health insurance, BMI, and history of CRC.\nFor each of the covariates in our regression models, we\nexamined smoothed scatter plots of the scaled Schoenfeld\nresiduals versus follow-up time to assess the appropriate-\nness of our proportional hazards specification.42\nSensitivity analyses were used to examine the contri-\nbution of nonlinear components of all continuous covari-\nates, including 25(OH)D as a continuous variable or by\nquintiles and excluding individuals who had CRC at base-\nline. We also examined interactions between 25(OH)D\nand age, sex, and race.\nRESULTS\nThe mean serum 25(OH)D level in the sample was 29.5\nng/mL (73.6 nmol/L). Table 1 shows the distribution of\nbaseline characteristics among individuals with and with-\nout deficient levels. In bivariate analyses, 25(OH)D defi-\nciency was associated with older age; being a man or being\nblack; region of the country; the time of year tested; less\neducation; lower income; no health insurance; currently\nsmoking; higher BMI; less physical activity; diabetes; and\nless intake of fiber, meat, saturated fat, and calcium.\nThere were 91 CRC deaths (0.4% of total mortality;\npopulation weighted) among individuals who had no\nmissing data. The association of risk factors with CRC\ndeath is summarized in Table 2. In Model 1 (25[OH]D\nomitted), CRC death was associated with older age, black\nrace, not having health insurance, and a history of CRC.\nBlacks had twice the risk of dying of CRC as non-His-\npanic whites. This relation was not affected appreciably\nby forcing the inclusion of any of the covariates, including\npoverty, into the model. When vitamin D was added\n(Model 2), deficiency was associated with a 2-fold\nincreased risk of CRC mortality. Notably, adding vitamin\nD deficiency to the model attenuated the CRC mortality\nrisk associated with being black by 40%, and the attenua-\nThe sensitivity analyses produced no evidence for\nnonlinear effects for any of the continuous variables and\nrevealed a significant effect for 25(OH)D when it was\nincluded as a continuous variable (and attenuation of the\nparameter estimate for black race was consistent with that\nreported). Analyses that excluded individuals who had\nCRC at baseline were consistent with those presented.\nThere were no significant interactions between 25(OH)D\nand age, sex, or race.\nDISCUSSION\nBy using a nationally representative sample of adults from\nthe United States, we examined the hypothesis that vita-\nmin D deficiency contributes to the black-white racial dis-\nparity in death from CRC. We observed that being black\nwas associated with higher CRC mortality compared with\nbeing whites, and adjusting for vitamin D deficiency atte-\nnuated this race effect by 40%. The attenuation did not\nappear to be attributable to a range of potential confound-\ners, including those related to socioeconomic status,\nhealth insurance, or behavioral risk factors. These findings\nare consistent with the hypothesis that vitamin D defi-\nciency explains a portion of the observed black-white dis-\nparity in CRC mortality and raise the possibility that\nvitamin D supplementation may reduce this disparity.\nThe current study adds to a growing body of evi-\ndence indicating that there is an association between vita-\nmin D and CRC incidence and/or mortality. The\nadjusted risk of vitamin D on CRC mortality observed in\nour study was slightly higher than the risk on CRC inci-\ndence derived from meta-analysis18 but similar to an effect\non mortality that was observed with a shorter follow-up\nperiod in this cohort.43 The findings of the current study\nare consistent with prior observational studies but go\nbeyond previous research to explore the relation between\nvitamin D deficiency and CRC disparities among African\nAmericans.\nA review of the published literature on the associa-\ntion between vitamin D and CRC revealed a lack of evi-\ndence from randomized controlled trials that vitamin D\nsupplementation prevents CRC.44 Therefore, causality\nhas not been established definitively, and chemopreven-\ntion has been proven effective only for intermediate\nRacial Disparity in CRC Death/Fiscella et al\nTable 1.

Vita-\nmin D, possibly in combination with calcium intake,\nappears to promote colorectal epithelial cell differentia-\ntion and apoptosis, increase DNA mismatch-repair pro-\nteins, and reduce oxidative damage and adenoma\nrecurrence.49-54 Furthermore, polymorphisms in the vita-\nmin D receptor have been associated with the risk of ade-\nnoma and cancer in various studies.55,56 Although these\ndata come from mostly studies that were conducted on\nparticipants without neoplasms at baseline, it is possible\nthat similar processes accelerate the progression of cancer,\npotentially affecting both incidence and survival.\nIn contrast to geographic and mechanistic studies,\nthe current study contributes to a body of research exam-\nining associations between serum vitamin D levels and\nCRC risk. A meta-analysis of serum 25(OH)D and the\nincidence of colonic adenomas revealed an inverse, graded\nresponse.15 Gorham et al conducted a quantitative meta-\nanalysis of nested case-control studies on serum levels of\nprediagnostic 25(OH)D and the subsequent incidence of\nCRC.18 In 3 of the 6 studies, statistically significant asso-\nciations were observed. A meta-analysis of all 6 studies\nrevealed a significant effect and dose-response with the\nvery lowest levels associated with the highest incidence.

We observed no interaction\nbetween race and serum 25(OH)D levels. Thus, given the\nhigh rates of vitamin D deficiency among blacks in this\nnational sample and the finding of an overall effect of low\nlevels with CRC mortality, it is not surprising that defi-\nciency among blacks contributed to the racial disparity in\nCRC deaths. This finding is noteworthy. If it is demon-\nstrated that vitamin D supplementation reduces CRC,\nthen it could have a substantial impact on the racial dis-\nparity in CRC mortality.\nImportant limitations of these findings include the\nsample size, the ascertainment of CRC deaths, a single\nmeasurement of vitamin D, and the potential for unmeas-\nured confounding. Consistent with previous studies,29,30\nlack of insurance remained a significant predictor of CRC\ndeath in the final model, yielding a 2.5-fold increase in\nrisk. However, that variable was measured only at base-\nline, and subsequent changes in health insurance may\nhave confounded the correlation between race and CRC\nmortality. Socioeconomic status is a multidimensional\nconstruct that arguably includes factors such as commu-\nnity of residence, which were not available in these data,59\nand residual confounding between race and socioeco-\nnomic status is possible. Furthermore, although our initial\ncohort was fairly large, the relatively small number of\nCRC deaths reduced our power to detect effects, and the\nconfidence intervals were wide.\nDeath certificate data appear to be reasonably accu-\nrate for ascertaining CRC deaths but may over-report co-\nlon cancer deaths and under-report rectal cancer.60\nFindings from a meta-analysis demonstrated effects of\nvitamin D on both colon cancers and rectal cancers.57\nThus, this misclassification may be moot. The level of\ncoding of cancer permitted in public data may have\nincluded anal cancer. The pathophysiology of anal cancer\ndiffers fundamentally from that of CRC but likely had a\nnegligible effect on our findings given its very low\nAlthough we measured vitamin D at a single point\nin time, prospective studies have revealed moderate corre-\nlations (0.7) over time.58 Any change in levels likely\nwould bias the results toward the null because of measure-\nment error. Finally, although we controlled for multiple\nfactors, confounding cannot be fully excluded in observa-\ntional studies. Previous cancer protective effects observed\nfor various nutrients have failed to hold up in randomized\ncontrolled trials and, in some cases (for example, beta car-\notene for smokers), has been associated with increased\nIn conclusion, the current findings add to the grow-\ning body of literature on the association between vitamin\nD and CRC57 and provide the first direct evidence that\nhigh rates of vitamin D deficiency among blacks may\naccount for some of the racial disparity in CRC deaths.\nThese findings underscore the need for randomized con-\ntrolled trials, such as the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial\n(VITAL) Study,63 to assess whether supplementation\nwith much higher doses than currently recommended not\nonly will reduce deaths from CRC in general but also will\nreduce the black-white racial disparity in the second lead-\ning cause of cancer-related death in the United States.\nthe National Cancer Institute (National Institutes of Health\nREFERENCES\n1.
