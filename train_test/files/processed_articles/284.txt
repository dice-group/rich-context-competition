This figure was nearly triple the amount spent\nshould not be surprising that the cost of health care\nand what to do about it has been, and is today, a\nnational preoccupation, even to the point of being a\nsubject of presidential debates [2]. Recently, several\neconomists and policy analysts have completed studies\nfocusing on health care as an investment rather than\njust as a cost, asking and attempting to answer the\nquestion: what is the value of the benefits associated\nwith these expenditures? [3\u00ad6] These researchers have\ncompared estimates of the dollar value of incremental\nhealth benefits (based on the value of a statistical life--\nsee Table 1) to incremental health-care costs and gen-\nerated estimates of the return on the increasing US\nhealth-care investment.\nNordhaus (2002) [3] argued that the utility form of\nincome accounting measures the value that the popu-\nlation gets from its current level of consumption, thus\nallowing for the enumeration of the increased value of\nadditional longevity and better health as well as the\nvalue from consumption of the traditional market out-\nputs. Valuing a statistical life at $3 million, and using\ndata on the increase in health-care costs and life\nmated that every additional dollar spent on health care\nUsing $5 million as the value for a statistical life,\nMurphy and Topel (1999) [4] calculated that increases\ntrillion annually to the US economy. This was reduced\nto $2.4 trillion annually when increases in annual\nhealth-care expenditures over the same time period\nity-adjusted life-year (QALY), Cutler and McClellan\n(2001) [6] calculated an overall return on investment\n$3.71, and found that net benefits of treatment of five\nconditions (heart attacks, low-birth weight infants, de-\npression, cataracts, and breast cancer) ranged from zero\nIn an analysis using the Medical Expenditure Panel Sur-\nvey (MEPS) data, Lichtenberg (2001) estimated a re-\nduction in other health-care costs of $71.09 for every\nadditional $18 spent on newer generation drugs [5].\nReturn on Investment in Health Care 147\nThe purpose of the present research was to extend\nthe previous work, cited above, in the following ways.\nFor the return of investment of total US investment in\nhealth using national data, we extended the analysis an\nvide estimates of ROI to Medicare using its data for\nfour specific health conditions, heart attack, type 2 dia-\nbetes, stroke, and breast cancer and we supplement\nthese analyses with estimates of ROI for major new\ntreatment advances in the four specific conditions. By\nproviding this multifaceted approach, we hope to pro-\nvide more definitive evidence about the ROI in health\nthan has previously been published.\nMethods\nThe study utilized three distinct approaches to \"trian-\ngulate\" the evidence as related to the ROI in health care\nin the United States. The first approach involved a cal-\nculation of the ratio of annual increased expenditures\non overall health-care services in the United States for\ndecrease in deaths or increase in life expectancy in the\nsnapshot view of the relationship between health-care\nspending for both prevention and treatment and health\noutcomes in a single year. Because health outcomes in\na given year are partially dependent on health expen-\nditures in previous years, this approach assumes that\nthe expenditures on health-care services in 2000 will\ninfluence future health outcomes in the same way as\nhealth-care expenditures before 2000 influenced health\noutcomes in 2000. To more accurately reflect the fact\nthat health outcomes in a given year are partially\ndependent on health expenditures in previous years, we\nused two additional estimation approaches. The sec-\nond approach estimated the ROI in Medicare health-\ncare treatment services for the period from 1985 to\n2000 for four health conditions: heart attack, stroke,\ntype 2 diabetes, and breast cancer. The third approach\nlooked at the same four health conditions, but esti-\nmated the ROI for selected major treatment innova-\nThe four health conditions were chosen based on\nseveral factors:\n\u00b7 Each disease is widely prevalent (see Table 2)\n(heart attack affects 2.6% [7.6 million persons] of\nsons], stroke 1.6% [4.7 million persons], breast\ncancer 0.7% [2.2 million persons]), thereby lead-\ning to high death and disability rates with costly\nimplications;\n\u00b7 A broad spectrum of demographic groups is\naffected by these diseases; across sex, race, and\nage, to a lesser degree.\n\u00b7 Major financial investments have been made in\nthe treatment of the chosen diseases over the past\nfew decades [7], including numerous technologi-\ncal innovations and advances in drug therapy,\nwhich raises the question of the return to society\nof those investments.\nApproach 1: ROI in Overall Health\nAnnual summaries of health-care expenditures and\nhealth outcomes (death rates, average life expectancy),\nfor the US population was compared for two points in\nand health outcomes for the 2000 US population were\ncompared with costs and health outcomes that would\nhave been observed for the 2000 US population if the\nage-adjusted per person expenditure rates, age-\nTable 1 Estimates of values of a statistical life\nAuthor (year)\n($ base year) Notes\nTable 2 Prevalence of diseases included in study\nHeart attack Type 2 diabetes Stroke Breast cancer\nLuce et al.\nadjusted death rates, and age-adjusted life expectancy\nhad remained at the 1980 levels. The costs included\ncosts for all health-care services including inpatient,\noutpatient, and public health, publicly funded health-\ncare research, and for health facility construction. The\nItems\" from the Consumer Price Index [8] to express\nthese costs \"relative to prices in the economy as a\nwhole\" [6]. The differences in annual costs, deaths,\nand life expectancy represent the incremental costs and\nhealth gains experienced in 2000, compared with those\nthat would have been experienced at the 1980 values.\nBased on estimates by Cutler and Kadiyala (1999)\n[9], we assumed that 66.5% of the improvements in\nhealth outcomes observed in 2000 compared with\n1980 are attributable to the increased expenditures on\nwas estimated from Cutler and Kadiyala's estimates\nfor cardiovascular mortality that 33% of the reduction\nin mortality was attributable to new medical technol-\nogy and 67% to the spread of new medical informa-\ntion through physicians and health-care providers as\nwell as the media and other sources. We assumed that\n50% of the spread of new medical information\noccurred during a health-care service visit. We\nassumed that changes in other factors associated with\nhealth outcomes (behavioral, environmental, and soci-\noeconomic) over this time period had mixed effects on\nhealth outcomes, some improving them. For example\nreduced levels of smoking and hypertension and\nreduced accident rates, and some worsening them\n(increased obesity) resulting in 33.5% of the total\ngains in health outcomes. The importance of this\nassumption was tested in a threshold analysis.\nTo compute the ROI in overall health care, the gains\nin mortality (i.e., avoided deaths) or life expectancy\n(both outcomes examined) were converted into dollars\nbased on published estimates of the value of a statis-\ntical life and value of a statistical life-year. Estimates of\nthe value of a statistical life have ranged from $1 mil-\nlion to $9 million based on the type and year of the\nstudy [6] (Table 1). The current study used a value of\na statistical life of $4 million and applied it uniformly\nwithout regard to the age of death. This value was cho-\nper undiscounted life-year which has been used in pre-\nvious studies to value health gains [6]. The value of an\nundiscounted life-year, of a discounted life-year, and of\nthe annual consumption (annuity) value of 1 life-year\nwere computed from the $4 million value of a statis-\ntical life using the following steps:\n\u00b7 Assumed age at which value of a statistical life is\nestimated = 39 years.\nundiscounted using the US life table.\n\u00b7 Remaining life expectancy at 39 years = 23.1 dis-\ncounted at 3% using the US life table.\n\u00b7 Annual consumption (annuity) value of 1 life-\n\u00b7 Annual consumption (annuity) value of 1 life-\nApproach 2: Return on Medicare's Investment in Four\nHealth Conditions\nThis analysis compared changes in inflation-adjusted\nMedicare payments to changes in health outcomes\nfor incident cohorts of patients with the four health\nconditions, heart attack, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and\nysis have previously been reported [10].\nviduals aged 65 and older randomly drawn for selec-\ntion into the National Long-term Care Survey\n(NLTCS). All Medicare institutional claims (hospital\ninpatient, outpatient, home health, skilled nursing\nfacility, and hospice) were searched for ICD-9-CM\ndiagnosis codes specific to each of the four index dis-\neases. Persons were selected into the sample based\non a hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of AMI\npersons were selected into the sample at the first occur-\nrence of a primary or secondary diagnosis on an insti-\ntutional claim (N = 5018). For breast cancer, women\nwere selected based on a primary diagnosis of breast\ncancer or a related procedure code on either a hospital\ninpatient or an outpatient claim (N = 1160).\nOutcomes common to all four diseases, heart\nattack, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and breast cancer, were\nchanges in survival, activities of daily living (ADL) lim-\nitations, cognitive status, prescription drug cost, and\nplacement in a nursing home. Mean life expectancy\nwas predicted during the 5-year period after the first\nservice date on the claim, separately for: 1) persons\ndictions (2\u00ad1), and (3\u00ad1) reflected gains in life expect-\nancy, controlling for changes in other covariates (i.e.,\nsex, race, age, educational attainment, health status\n[the DxCG score]) [11].\nMedicare cost was real (using the Consumer Price\nIndex, all items, all urban consumers), total Medicare\npayments (2000 dollars) for the first 5 years after the\nbeneficiary's first date of service on the claim used to\ndefine the index event. Linear regression was used with\nthe natural logarithm of cost after diagnosis as the\ndependent variable. Increases in the cost of nursing\nReturn on Investment in Health Care 149\nhome use and prescription drugs cost were treated as a\nreduction in the value of health outcomes. The cost of\nnursing home use was calculated using an estimate of\nannual cost at the midpoint of the first and last study\nexclude Medicare's share of such cost. The cost of pre-\nscription drugs was calculated using NLTCS commu-\nnity survey responses on the number of prescription\ndrugs purchased, and either the dollar or percentage\ncost borne by the beneficiary. A two-part model of\ndrug costs was used because not all individuals had\nprescription drug expenditures: logistic regression to\npredict the probability of purchasing any prescription\ndrugs, and linear regression to predict either the per-\ncentage or dollar amount paid for out-of-pocket by\nthose respondents who reported at least one prescrip-\ntion drug purchase.\nThe dollar values of health outcomes represented\ngains in survival, and reductions in the increase in ADL\nlimitations and cognitive impairment, net of increases\nin non-Medicare nursing home and prescription drug\nlife-year without an ADL limitation [14\u00ad16]. For a life-\nyear with an ADL limitation, we used a value of\nthe value of a life-year with or without an ADL lim-\nitation by $2500 per question answered incorrectly.\nApproach 3: ROI in Major Innovations\nFor each disease of interest, heart attack, type 2 dia-\nbetes, stroke, and breast cancer, we first compiled a\ntimeline of major treatment innovations that had\noccurred in the past 25 years (see Appendix A). This\nprocess was based on both consultation with clinical\nexperts and review of key clinical literature.\nSecond, a literature search was conducted using\nsearch terms for the four diseases of interest, as well as\nthe following economic terms: \"costs and cost analy-\nsis,\" \"pharmaceutical economics,\" \"cost-benefit anal-\nysis,\" and \"health-care costs.\" The search was limited\nto English language articles published since 1975.\nEach retrieved article was reviewed to determine\nwhether it met the following study inclusion criteria:\n1. Included at least one treatment option that was\nincluded in the list of selected treatment innova-\nAppendix A)\n2. Did not compare similar forms of the same treat-\nment innovation (e.g., two innovative drugs\nwithin the same drug class, such as two statins)\n3. Utilized cost-effectiveness or cost-utility method-\nology that produced either a cost-effectiveness or\ncost-utility ratio (i.e., cost per life-year gained or\ncost per QALY gained) for comparator treatments\n4. Study based in the United States or incorporated\nUS treatment patterns and costs\nFor relevant treatment comparisons within the\nselected published studies, the ROI in a particular\ntreatment innovation was calculated as follows:\n1. All costs reported as part of the cost-effectiveness\nor cost-utility ratio results were updated to year\n2000 US dollars based on the Medical Services\ncomponent of the Consumer Price Index [8].\nvalue of an undiscounted life-year or QALY\ndiscounted life-year or QALY gained and applied\nto the study estimates of life-years gained or\n3. The value of the incremental health gains was\ndivided by the incremental costs. Or an equivalent\ncalculation was to divide the study estimated cost\neffectiveness ratio (inflated to $2000) by the value\nfor a undiscounted or discounted life-year.\nAs an example, a published study reports the incre-\nmental cost-utility ratio for Treatment A relative to\ndiscounted both costs and outcomes, so the value\ngains for every dollar spent on Treatment A.\"\nResults\nReturn on Investment in Overall Health\n(16%); life expectancy from birth increased by\n3.2 years (4%) and average life expectancy for all ages\nincreased by 2.18 years; and disability rates for people\nsons (25%) [17]. However, there was a concomitant\nincrease in health spending. However, there was a con-\ncomitant increase in health spending during the same\ntime period, with annual (age-adjusted) per person\nthat each additional dollar spent on overall health-care\nservices produced health gains valued at $1.55 to\n$1.94 (Table 3). The ROI in overall health-care serv-\nices is greater than one under a wide range of alterna-\ntive assumptions. As an example, for every additional\ndollar spent on health-care services, the ROI remains\ngreater than $1 for all scenarios where a statistical life\nis valued at >$2.6 million and for all scenarios where a\nlife-year is valued at >$64,500. Alternatively, assuming\nour base case values of $4 million for the value of a sta-\ntistical life and $100,000 for the value of a life-year, for\nevery additional dollar spent on health-care services,\nthe ROI remains greater than $1 for all scenarios\nwhere at least 43% of the life expectancy gains are\nLuce et al.\ndirectly attributable to the additional health-care\nexpenditures.\nReturn on Medicare's Investment in Four\nHealth Conditions\nThe results of the Medicare claims analysis are pro-\nvided in Table 4. The health gains that occurred for\nheart attack patients between the periods of 1985 to\nincreased life-years) were valued at $28,632. After\nsubtracting the increase in heart attack treatment costs\nover the same time period ($26,093), the net benefit in\ndollars was $2539 or, stated differently, the return on\nhealth gains associated with heart attack treatment\nwas estimated to be $1.10 for every additional dollar\nspent by Medicare. The return on health gains associ-\nated with treatment for the other three health con-\nadditional dollar spent by Medicare for stroke, type 2\ndiabetes, and breast cancer, respectively (Table 4).\nReturn on Investment in Major Innovations\nThe literature review identified a total of 23 pub-\nlished studies that reported cost-effectiveness or cost-\nutility ratio results that could be utilized in ROI\nsearch results in Table 5). The results of the ROI cal-\nculations are provided in Table 6. As an example,\nness of statin therapy (vs. no statin therapy) in\npatients with type 2 diabetes who did not have cardi-\novascular disease. The cost-effectiveness ratio ranged\ncounted life-year gained, depending on study assump-\ntions. Thus, the return on health gains for this\npatient population was $7 to $31 for every addi-\ntional dollar spent on statin therapy. For all studies\nincluded in Table 5, the ROI ranged from both sav-\nings in treatment costs and gains in health to a return\ntional dollar spent.\nAnnual outcomes\nChanges in\noutcomes*\nChange in outcomes from\nhealth-care services\nValue of changes in outcomes\nfrom health-care services ($)\nReturn on investment of $1\nin health-care services ($)\nAssuming 66.5% of the change in outcomes is attributable to the use of health-care services.\nChange in outcome valued in dollars divided by change in annual health-care costs between 1980 and 2000 ($646.1 billion).\n\u00b6Assuming the annual consumption value of an increased year of life expectancy is $2455 at 0% discount rate--this value is equivalent to a net present value of a life-year of\nTable 4 Five-year Medicare treatment costs and health outcomes for diseases of interest: change between periods 1985\u00ad1989 and\nAverage\nlife-years\nValue of additional\nlife-years ($)*\nAverage\ncosts\nNet\nbenefits ($) ROI ($)\n*Value of $100,000 per life-year gained without any activity limitation, $50,000 per life-year gained with an activity limitation, and $2500 decrease per life-year for each cognitive\nquestion answered incorrectly.\nROI, return on investment.\nTable 5 Number of studies identified and included in ROI analysis\nDisease\nNo. of studies\nidentified based\non search terms\n(1) No. of studies\nexcluded because\na relevant treatment\ninnovation not\nevaluated\n(2) No. of remaining\nstudies excluded\nbecause CEA/CUA\nnot utilized\nNo. of remaining\nstudies excluded\nbecause ex-US\nNo. of remaining\nstudies excluded\nbecause compared\nsimilar forms of\nsame innovation\nNo. of studies\nincluded in ROI\nanalysis\nCEA, cost-effectiveness analysis; CUA, cost-utility analysis; ROI, return on investment.\nReturn on Investment in Health Care 151\nTable 6 Return on investment (ROI) for major innovations\nReference Comparators Population ROI\nHeart attack\nCretin (1977) [26] Mobile coronary care unit vs. usual care Hypothetical cohort of heart\nattack patients\nFor every additional dollar spent, gain of\nGoldman et al.\nRoutine therapy with beta-blockers vs.\nusual care\nHeart attack survivors beginning\ntherapy with beta-blockers\nLow-risk patients: for every additional\ndollar spent, gain of $6.49.

We are all aware that improved health has value\nto society as does access to the latest medical and\nhealth-care advances. The question is how much value\nrelative to the cost.\nBut quantifying the value of these health-care gains\nhas received much less attention in the United States\nuntil fairly recently, and our findings are consistent\nwith those studies that preceded ours [3,4,6]. For\ninstance, the Economic Policy Institute demonstrated\na remarkable positive correlation between national\nhealth-care spending and life expectancy across all 30\ncountries of Organization for Economic Cooperation\nand Development with, interestingly, two outliers: the\nUnited States ranks highest (by far) in spending but\n21st of 30 in life expectancy whereas Japan rates first\nin life expectancy and 15th in expenditures (http://\n2005). However, our findings are not necessarily con-\nsistent with other international work. For example, a\nWorld Bank study found no clear correlation between\nnational health expenditures with life expectancy\nacross developed and developing countries [19,20]. It\nis not clear to us why this inconsistency may exist but\nmay be have more to do with the limitations of the\ndata, for example, difficulty controlling for covariates,\nthan the absence of a relationship between health and\nexpenditure. As well, time series analyses of the impact\nof change in a single country, as we have done, are a\nvery different analytical approach than the interna-\ntional studies which have looked at the aggregate levels\nof expenditure and health across countries at a single\npoint in time. Thus, our findings may not be in conflict\nwith these international comparison studies. In any\ncase, there is no strong theoretical or empirical argu-\nment that increasing expenditure will not increase\nhealth.\nTo fully appreciate our findings, it is important for\nthe reader to understand several issues and caveats.\nFirst, we attempted to take a broad, representative\napproach to valuing health care in the United States.\nThis is important because of the complexity of the\nquestion we faced and the imperfect nature of the\navailable evidence. We accomplished this by focusing\nour research efforts across several dimensions. That is,\nwe chose to examine both overall health-care indices\nrelative to overall health-care costs; as well as to\nexamine in more depth four major diseases (heart\nattack, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and breast cancer) in\nterms of costs and benefits incurred by and accrued to\nMedicare and resulting from key innovations over\ntime. These four diseases were chosen for several rea-\nsons, including their being highly prevalent, costly and\neach has been the subject of a great deal of expensive\nand often effective innovation. Had we chosen other\ndiseases, we may well have seen different patterns of\nROI, which is one reason we were determined to also\nestimate the overall ROI for national health-care\nspending.\nSecond, our effort to develop the evidence presented\nin this study was broad-based in that we researched the\nexisting clinical, economic, technology assessment and\noutcomes literature, consulted with clinical specialists\nin each of the four chosen conditions and examined in\ndetail the Medicare claims database and long-term\ncare survey data.\nThird, although our primary task was to estimate\nthe ROI in health care, we fully recognize that many\nnonhealth-care factors affect the population's health\nboth positively and negatively. For instance, although\nhave led to positive gains in health (e.g., lower smok-\ning rates), many others (e.g., increased obesity) have\nled to negative outcomes. Other factors such as rates of\nexercise and environmental conditions may have both\npositive and negative impacts on overall health indices.\nIt was not possible to adjust for all of these factors. In\nour base case analysis, we have assumed that 66.5% of\nattributable to the provision of health education and\nof preventive and treatment health-care services. A\nsensitivity analysis explored higher and lower values\nfor this parameter. The confounding problem noted\nabove is much less of a concern for our disease-specific\nfindings because, for each disease, we begin our anal-\nysis with a population already afflicted with the dis-\nease, then we calculate the gain in health over time\nrelative to the health-care cost invested. Thus, for each\ndisease, the reader can more comfortably assume that\nthe estimated benefits are due to the investment in\nhealth care.\nBecause of scope and access to data reasons, we\nchose to concentrate our analysis on therapeutic rather\nthan preventive technologies. With few exceptions,\nMedicare does not cover prevention. Had we chosen to\ninclude prevention, we may have found different\nresults, although we are aware of no evidence that this\nwould be the case. Russell argued back in 1986 that\nthe focus on costs of prevention `. . . more precise, the\nassertion that prevention saves money . . . was a mis-\nplaced notion.' (Russell LB. Is prevention better than\ncure. Studies in Social Economics. The Brookings Insti-\ntution, Washington, DC; 1986.) She went on to note\nthat although there were a few published studies dem-\nonstrating medical costs savings and a few others dem-\nonstrating preventing disease were estimated to be less\ncost-effective than letting the disease develop and then\ntreat it, her main conclusion was consistent with ours:\nthat the public policy issue should be value not cost. To\nReturn on Investment in Health Care 153\nour knowledge, the only study that has attempted to\nevaluate the overall ROI of prevention was published\nby the Public Health Services in 1995. (US Department\nof Health and Human Services. Public Health Service.\n\"For a Healthy Nation: Returns on Investment in Pub-\ntrue ROI was not calculated, the study reported that\nattributed to public health/prevention efforts and that\nsome unspecified future investment in prevention and\npublic health could save up to 11% ($69 billion in\nFourth, we attempted to evaluate the return on a\nbroad range of types of investment in health care as\nopposed to restricting our efforts to high technology.\nFor instance, we note the significant advances of more\nefficient hospital use (lower lengths of stay and hospi-\ntal costs), better public health focused surveillance\ntechniques, better diagnosis and counseling for those\nwith high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels,\nand better practices in glucose control as well as use of\nmany innovative pharmaceuticals, medical devices,\nand diagnostic technologies.\nFinally, we specifically examined whether the incre-\nmental investment in health care has yielded a positive\nreturn. We did not address whether society could\nachieve these same health benefits at a lower cost or\nwhether the health-care system is operating efficiently\nas a whole. This study should, however, provide addi-\ntional perspective as the nation debates health-care\ncost containment strategies, helping to refocus atten-\ntion on increasing value rather than cost reduction as\nthe primary objective.\nThe results from the current study are likely to\nunderestimate the ROI in overall health-care services\nbecause, for the most part, they do not include the\nvalue of the morbidity gains from the reduction in dis-\nability over age 65 and gains in worker productivity\nand quality of life attributable to new treatments for\nspecific health conditions. Over the past 20 years, sig-\nnificant gains in productivity and quality of life asso-\nciated with health-care interventions in those less than\n65 years of age have been shown for several diseases\nincluding influenza, migraine, diabetes, and depres-\nsion. Unfortunately, comprehensive national estimates\nof changes in US productivity or quality of life attrib-\nutable to health conditions are not available. If these\ndata were available, the ROI to overall health-care\nservices would likely be higher.\nused in our analyses and that have been used by others\npreviously were derived from empirical estimates of\nthe value of a statistical life. They support the view\nbenchmark value that is frequently use for cost-\neffectiveness analyses, $50,000 per QALY, is an under-\nestimate of the amount that people in the US are will-\ning to pay for an additional year of life.\ntheories of better health measured by reduced mortal-\nity--that better health results from: 1) economic\ngrowth; 2) new medical knowledge and practice; 3)\nbetter access to health-care services; 4) better public\ninformation about the new medical knowledge and\nbehavioral changes; and 5) government actions to\nreduce risky behavior. They argue that in the US, the\nimprovements in life expectancy at the beginning of\nthe 20th century occurred as a result of economic\ngrowth, whereas those in the middle of the century\nwere associated with medical advances in the treat-\nment of infection, and those in the later part of the cen-\ntury were associated with better public information\nand behavioral changes as well as improving preven-\ntion and treatment services. The dependence of life\nexpectancy on all of these factors may confound the\nrelationship between levels of health-care spending\nand life expectancy. This article has presented three\nmethods for measuring this relationship in an attempt\nto obtain quantitative estimates of the ROI in health\ncare.\nThe authors would like to thank Manishi Prasad, formerly of\nthe MEDTAP Institute at UBC, who assisted with the litera-\nture synthesis.
