Public consideration for religious leaders can easily\nsurpass public attention to politicians, especially if the\nissues tackled by their statements have broad audiences that\ngo beyond traditional political constituencies. Yet, little is\nknown on when these actors speak politically and how their\npolitical pronouncements relate to the statements of secular\nauthorities.Atypical argument is that certain religious lead-\ners have more political personalities or clearer political\ninterests. For example, Pope Francis is often considered a\nmore political pontiff than others before him.1 However, to\ndate there is no systematic evidence that either confirms or\nrejects this common wisdom.\nSpecifically, studies of the political announcements of\nspiritual leaders are virtually nonexistent. This research gap\nis puzzling, given the agreement that the positions of reli-\ngious institutions have powerful effects on voters' ideology\nstudy of international relations, where morality and norms\nare deemed as important determinants of political prefer-\nences, analyses of the statements of spiritual leaders are de\nfacto missing. Considering the global popularity of the\nchurch and the politically dividing topics that relate to the\nsphere of religion, it seems natural to ask under which con-\nditions religious leaders are more likely to release political\nstatements.\nTackling these questions, in this article I argue that reli-\ngious authorities are more likely to issue political messages\nwhen secular institutions are unwilling or incapable to take\nclear political positions. In order to test my argument, I con-\ncentrate on the high-level statements of the Roman Catholic\nchurch presented by the Vatican.2 I focus on the Vatican for\nthe following reasons. Theoretically, the clear spiritual role\nof the Roman church permits to assume that its leaders are\nindependently motivated from other political institutions. In\nother words, the preferences of the Roman church should be\nexogenous from secular political interests, because the\nVatican commands that religious leaders do not enter pro-\nfessional politics and vice versa.3 Empirically, studying the\nPolitics ex cathedra: Religious\nauthority and the Pope in modern\ninternational relations\nFederica Genovese\n Keywords\nReligion, international politics, authority, Pope, crises\nUniversity of Essex, UK\nCorresponding author:\nFederica Genovese, University of Essex, Wivenhoe Park, Colchester\nEmail: fgenov@essex.ac.uk\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nVatican allows relying on a body of written documents that\nto date have never been studied from a rigorous political\nscience perspective. Leveraging state-of-the-art text analy-\nsis methods, and specifically topic modelling, I present an\nanalysis of all of the papal encyclicals since the end of World\nWar II. My analysis identifies the political terminology that\nemerges in these ecclesiastic documents and indicates with\nprecision which documents are more concentrated on politi-\ncal themes. Moreover, the new data allow me to trace at\nwhich points in time the church has released more politi-\ncally relevant statements, thus providing evidence for the\nextent to which the Vatican is sensitive to the void of global\naction on pressing political issues.\nThe results indicate the scope of \"politics ex cathedra\":\nthe Vatican has dedicated roughly one third of its post-war\nencyclicals to the political themes of social justice, civil rights\nand economic development. In addition, the findings suggest\nthat the timing of the more political encyclicals follows regu-\nlar patterns, as the more political documents correlate with\nyears in which clear international crises break out. The evi-\ndence indicates that strong political statements by this high-\nprofile religious authority are anti-cyclical to states'positions\non political problems. Put differently, the church has histori-\ncally filled a void of secular leadership incapable or unwilling\nto address political change. These results speak to the role of\nreligious authorities in a politically polarized world and indi-\ncate that the Vatican's contemporary political signals are con-\nsistent with a long tradition of engagement at the occurrence\nof political crises. This is contrary to the claims that some\npopes are more political than others and that their writings are\nsystematically different from each other.4\nReligious authority and global\ngovernance\nSince the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, sovereign nation\nstates have been the central international decision-makers.\nEven today, in an interdependent world where political\nproblems systematically jump borders and increase scale,\nstates are the polities in charge of enacting global policies.\nHowever, states are not the only actors maneuvering the\ninternational system. As a large body of research indicates,\nthe nation-centric understanding of international politics\ndoes not exclude the political relevance of non-state actors\n(Drezner, 2007). Religious authorities, together with corpo-\nrations, non-governmental organizations and social move-\nments, lack the international legal status of states, but they\npossess the power to tilt international politics towards their\npreferences. This power takes different forms. On the one\nhand, power is leveraging material influence and mobilizing\nhand, power is possessing legitimacy, which induces con-\nformity and obedience (Barnett and Duvall, 2005; B\u00fcthe,\n2004). Using both types of influence, non-governmental\nactors behave as lobbies to states, which are the only\nsovereign territorial institutions that can enact their favoured\npolicies. However, the relationship between the political\npreferences of these actors and traditional governments is\nstill a point of discussion. It is open to question whether\nthese authorities echo states' positions or have genuine,\nindependent political stands. Relatedly, it is unclear when\nthey would decide to take vocal positions on some specific\npolitical issues.\nThe political positioning of religious authorities is partic-\nularly puzzling due to the historical role of religion in inter-\nnational relations. Despite the nominal separation of state\nand church in the Middle Ages, the two camps have inter-\nacted substantively in modern times (Bueno De Mesquita,\n2000). For example, Christian communities were involved in\ndiplomatic affairs at the end of the 19th century with the\nemergence of numerous new European nation states.\nFurthermore, after World War II, many religious denomina-\ntions embraced modern political attitudes in their practices\ndue to several important reforms.5 These reforms coincided\nwith religious leaders starting to make explicit statements on\ngovernment morality and political action (Stark, 2015).\nHowever, in spite of anecdotal evidence on these political\nstands, little light has been shed on how these positions have\nmanifested themselves and, more importantly, how they are\nrelated to states' positions on global politics. The answer to\nthis question depends on how one perceives the relation\nbetween state and church. To the extent that states' govern-\nment and religious leadership are two complementary\nsources of political mobilization, their political force should\nemerge uniformly, and perhaps at the same time. To the\nextent that these sets of actors substitute each other, when-\never one is in charge of a political issue, the other is not, and\nvice versa. Hence, it is up to debate whether political state-\nments of religious authorities are either cyclical or anti-cycli-\ncal to the statements of formal political institutions.\nI argue that spiritual leaders are more likely to take vocal\npolitical stands on international issues when states have dif-\nficulties or constraints in addressing them. This is due to a\nset of reasons that can be linked to rational choice theory\nand the logic of credible commitments. Firstly, spiritual\nleaders should be more inclined to substitute secular lead-\ners because they are actors that want to maximize their suc-\ncess while minimizing their costs of action. Success\ncorresponds to maintaining, and possibly increasing, the\nnumber of church members. Thus, maximizing success\nimplies giving voice and anticipating the worries of the\naverage congregant. By contrast, minimizing costs means\neluding reputation loss and avoiding competition with other\ninstitutions. So, it is plausible that religious leaders want to\nincrease the resources spent addressing a political issue that\na significant number of followers deem as relevant if doing\nso strengthens the reputation of the church. By contrast,\nreligious leaders should ignore political issues that are not\nat the heart of their audiences and that compete with other\nauthorities in charge. If stressing an issue with clear and\nGenovese 3\ndeterminate language means marking political influence\n(Edelman, 1985), then religious leaders should release\npolitical statements only if this action can solidify their\nmoral power. If public audiences are disinterested or if they\nare more responsive to the guide of other institutions, reli-\ngious leaders are better off focusing on spiritual problems.\nSecondly, spiritual leaders should be more likely to take\npolitical stands on issues that states fail to address because,\nlike secular leaders, religious authorities are bound to cred-\nible commitments, which constrain them about which\nissues to pick and how to perpetrate them. Differently from\nsecular leaders, however, religious authorities become\nmore credible when morality becomes stronger vis-\u00e0-vis\nother motivations of political action (Tavits, 2007). When\nformal political institutions are ambiguous about a political\nproblem, morality may matter more for the public, so the\nchurch should respond to an increased demand for moral\nauthority with a more political position. Consequently, if\nsecular leaders are incapable or unwilling to act on a par-\nticular issue, then the religious leader's commitment to that\nissue should be even more credible.\nTo place this argument in a more specific context, con-\nsider the politics of international public good provision,\nsuch as security agreements or environmental cooperation.\nWhen states have the domestic political capability to push\nthe international agenda forward, then international collec-\ntive action is feasible and the state's intention to address the\npublic goods is credible. However, when domestic political\ninterests are not aligned with international agreement,\ncooperation is unfeasible. In that instance, religious author-\nities are relatively more free to work on the international\nagenda and address the externalities of public good failure.\nAfter all, the church seeks to influence secular politics and\nmaneuver social policies to maintain, and possible extend,\npublic credibility and followers' attention. Hence, it is in\nthe church's interest to tackle issues that affect their trans-\nnational audience, such as global injustice, international\nconflict and world poverty. This leads me to expect that\nwhen national governments do not take a position on press-\ning political issues, religious authorities substitute them in\norder to fill their political void. Surely political statements\nare also a function of the personal idiosyncrasies of the\nleaders in charge. For example, the leader's place of origin\nand his intrinsic issue salience may matter a great deal for\nthe framing of some topics. Nonetheless, political failures\nshould be relevant for triggering political discussions\nwithin spiritual organizations, ceteris paribus. Thus, I\nexpect that international crises that weaken the political\npower of secular institutions should drive the political\nstatements of international spiritual authorities.\nNote that my argument implies that in times of crises the\nchurch may produce political statements to influence both\nsecular authorities and the public. The link between crises\nand the church's political statements should hold whether\nor not people are already sensitive to political messages, as\nlong as there is a political problem that will affect them.\nAlso, my argument de facto predicts a negative correlation\nbetween crises and more spiritual topics. If religious\nauthorities are a `thermometer' of public opinion and if\nthey have incentives to anticipate public concerns, they\nshould be less interested in engaging politics when govern-\nments and people are not affected by the consequences of\nany crisis. This means that, while more political themes\nshould emerge in religious communications at crucial his-\ntorical moments, more spiritual themes should feature the\nchurch's messages when the world is sufficiently governed\nby secular authorities, in the absence of a crisis.\nData selection, research design and\nmethod\nTo test my argument, I concentrate on the body of commu-\nnications of the modern Roman Catholic church of the\nHoly See. The Catholic church represents a special interna-\ntional icon of religious authority. In 1870 the Papal territo-\nries were incorporated in the new Kingdom of Italy, which\nended the church's millennial temporal power. That same\nyear corresponded to the First Vatican Council that resulted\nin a first breakaway with the Old Catholic Church. In 1958\nthe Second Vatican Council started a series of reforms that\nturned the Holy See into what it is today. But despite the\nVatican's specific historical developments, its relations\nwith secular politics should be comparable with other mod-\nern religious authorities. For example, His Holiness the\nDalai Lama and the Gran Imam of Egypt are considered the\nhighest authority in Buddhist and Sunni Islam communi-\nties, respectively.6 In this light, the Vatican's structures and\naudiences resemble other religious denominations and, in\nprinciple, guarantee the external validity of investigating its\nmessages vis-\u00e0-vis modern politics.\nIn order to perform a rigorous analysis of the nature and\nrecurrence of political themes in Vatican communications,\nI choose a homogenous group of papal writings known as\nencyclicals. I focus on these texts for two reasons. First,\ndifferently from other papal documents such the apostolic\nletters and homilies, encyclicals are written to instruct\nbishops in all countries about a number of different mat-\nters. Therefore, they are quite comprehensive and their\nreadership is universal. Moreover, while papal notes and\nspeeches are published weekly, the pontiff defines when,\nand under which circumstances, encyclicals should be\nissued. These characteristics are useful for testing my\nhypothesis that global politics should be systematically\naddressed in papal documents at the outbreak of interna-\ntional crises. At the same time, because all encyclicals\ninevitably concern the Catholic doctrine, they should also\naddress issues directly related to faith and preaching. This\nmeans that using the encyclicals allows me to avoid select-\ning on the dependent variables, i.e. contents and timing of\npolitical papal messages.\n4 Research and Politics \nFor my analyses I collect all of the encyclicals from\nthat the Second Vatican Council radically changed the\ngoal of these papal communications. While beforehand\nthe papal writings were still mostly concerned with terri-\ntorial relations and spiritual dogmas, after 1958 the\nChurch revamped the purpose of encyclicals in order to\ndiscuss \"the most characteristic and ultimate purpose of\nthe teachings\" of the church, in the words of Paul VI.7 The\n34 documents are all available online in multiple lan-\nguages. After the Second Vatican Council, Italian became\nthe vernacular of the Catholic Church, which means that\nencyclicals since then have been written in Italian and\nthen translated in other languages. Hence, I selected the\noriginal Italian versions.8\nThe analysis of the encyclicals could involve different\nmethods, from supervised human coding to less supervised\napproaches. I choose to proceed with an automated content\nanalysis. There are two reasons why automated content\nanalysis is preferable, although not a perfect substitute, to\nhuman coding in the case of the papal texts. The first reason\nis one of practicality. While my text corpus is rather small,\nthe content is lengthy: a scarce few of the 34 encyclicals are\nbelow 10 pages, while more than two thirds are more than\n40 pages (the mean word count of the pre-processed docu-\nments is 32,169). A reliable human coding exercise would\nhave required at-the-time infeasible resources, and would\ncertainly cost months. By contrast, the automated content\nanalysis is highly efficient, reliable and economical.\nSecondly, the choice of automated text analysis is sup-\nported by a small-scale validation experiment where I com-\npared the word associations generated by the automated\nmethod with associations elicited through human input.\nThe results, which are reported in the Appendix and are fur-\nther discussed below, indicate that the automated analysis\ncan efficiently and substantively categorize the papal com-\nmunications, and human coding is neither more advanta-\ngeous nor necessary.\nFrom the range of automated content analysis models, I\nneed a method that identifies the frequency and density of\npolitical contents. If my argument is valid, encyclicals with\nmore politically dense topics should be issued after highly\ncontentious moments where states fail to coordinate political\naction. Topic models can help distinguish political themes in\nthe encyclicals, because they can indicate which of them are\nmore or less \"political\" based on the latent topic structures. If\na topic that lacks politically meaningful words dominates an\nencyclical, the topic model would estimate with a certain\nlikelihood that this is not a political text. By contrast, if a\ntopic characterized by politically meaningful words is more\ndominant, the topic model would indicate that this encyclical\nshould be considered a more political text.\nTo conduct the core analysis of this study I rely on a\nsimple type of unsupervised topic model that finds sets of\nwords that characterize the documents' latent dimensions.\nFollowing the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) approach\n(Blei et al., 2003), I assume that each topic is characterized\nby a distribution over words w. So, I first create the list of\nwords w used in the set of encyclicals. I then count w\nij\n, the\nnumber of times each word j appears in each encyclical i.\nThis creates a matrix summarizing the distribution of words,\nwhere each word in each document has a certain weight.\nThen, through the LDA estimation, I assess the systematic\ncorrelations of words, which means that I inductively gener-\nate topics based on a probability distribution over terms.9 In\naddition, I test the data with alternative topic models that\nbuild off of the LDA tradition. In particular, the structural\nallows me to explicitly estimate the relationship between the\nencyclicals and information on crises.\nBefore moving to estimate the LDA topic model, the\nnumber of topics needs to be specified. Following my theo-\nretical argument, I expect the encyclicals to be mainly\ndivided between two dominant topics: a spiritual topic and\npolitical topic. This binary choice is not a classical setup for\ntopic models, where usually multiple themes are analysed.\nCommonly, the number of topics is better justified through\ninductive topic discovery. To inductively explore the topic\ndensity in my documents, I estimate two LDA-derived\nmeasures: the \"perplexity\" score, where a lower value indi-\ncates better generalization performance, and the marginal\nlikelihood, which is an auxiliary measure of model fit\nLDA models with a number of topics ( k ) set from 2\nthrough 6 that are calculated using different initialization\nvalues to ensure that my conclusions are not driven by the\nstarting parameters. The resultant perplexity and log-likeli-\nhood values are plotted in Figure 1 for every initial set of\nthe starting parameters (grey) and each measure's respec-\ntive mean values across all initializations (red). The plots\nsuggest that a number of topics above 2 does not drastically\nimprove the perplexity and log-likelihood measures,\nbecause the estimated values of neither metric critically\nchanges moving from 2 to 6 topics. In other words, limiting\nthe analysis to two topics should not compromise the opti-\nmality of the analysis, while it allows a more straight for-\nward test of the theory.\nThis conclusion can be also drawn from the estimation\nof coherence and exclusivity scores (Roberts et al., 2014)\nof a three-topic model. Although these scores are usually\nemployed to assess topic quality, comparing across topics\nmay indicate whether two topics capture enough of the\nword variation. In fact, these dimensions provide informa-\ntion on the consistency and differentiation of the topics.\nFigure 2 shows that these scores mainly distinguish a more\n\"political\" topic (Topic 1) from the other two topics (Topic\n2 and 3), which combine more spiritual words. I interpret\nthis distance between the two clusters of topics as further\nevidence that a two-topic model may capture an important\nsemantic distinction across the encyclicals.\nGenovese 5\nFilling a political void: the case of the\nThis article seeks to investigate whether the content of papal\nencyclicals is correlated with international political crises. A\ndescriptive overview of the documents indicates that termi-\nnology tilted towards international political issues is indeed\npresent in these texts: although the most frequent words, not\nsurprisingly, are god (dio) and church (chiesa), which are\nwords such as work (lavoro) and politics (politic-) are\ntop 60 words of the corpus of encyclicals. Topic models help\nshedding more rigorous light on this pattern.\nI run the two-topic models 50 times using different ran-\ndom initialization values to ensure that my conclusions are\nnot driven by the starting parameters. The LDA decomposes\nthe words of the 34 encyclicals into two clusters and provide\na list of words loading on each dimension. The two topics\nare not exclusive in that some words are included on both\nsimultaneously. Nonetheless, there is a set of words that\nconsistently load on the first topic, such as church (chiesa),\nChrist (cristo), faith (fede) and truth (verit\u00e0). By contrast, a\nsecond separate set of words load on a topic that refers to the\nconcepts of work (lavoro), development (sviluppo), social\n(social-) and men (uomini). Evidently, the first topic seems\nto capture the more \"spiritual\" papal messages, while the\nsecond topic reflects the more \"political\" ones.\nThe LDA analysis also indicates which encyclicals load\nmost on which of the two topics in relative terms.As Figure 3\nFigure 1. Model selection: model fit metrics by different\ntopic numbers. This figure illustrates the perplexity and\nmarginal likelihood scores calculated for the entire corpus of\nencyclicals with an estimation repeated 20 times using different\ninitializations.\nFigure 2. Model selection: semantic cohesiveness and exclusivity in three-topic model. This figure plots the semantic coherence\nand exclusivity scores of the topics in an LDA model with three topics. On the exclusivity dimension the differences are small,\nwhich indicates that the top words for the topics can appear within top words of other topics. On the semantic coherence\ndimension the differences are larger, to indicate that the words that are most associated with the corresponding themes do not\noccur equally within the documents. This is evidence that spiritual topics are more coherent, but also that the top words of the\npolitical topic are differently consistent.\n6 Research and Politics \nshows, roughly two thirds of the encyclicals group on the first\nmore spiritual topic. By contrast, one third are principally\nmarked by the words of the second more political topic. The\nspiritual encyclicals are concentrated on the holy spirit (spir-\nito), the world (mondo), saints (sant-) and love (amor-),\namong other themes. Contrastingly, the political encyclicals\nplace less emphasis on divinity and more on people (person-),\njustice (giustizia), as well as economy (economi-) and society\n(social-).At minimum, this is evidence that a stratum of polit-\nical language distinctly appears in a significant subset of\npapal encyclicals across the years, and that the Vatican has\nsystematically focused on pressing international political\nissues across time.\nNote that this division of the post-1958 encyclicals is\ngenerally in line with an extensive body of historical\nVatican studies. Accordingly, most political encyclicals\nidentified through my topic analysis belong to the unoffi-\ncial group of documents commonly referred to as Catholic\nSocial Teaching. Nonetheless, the LDA is possibly more\nnuanced than this categorization, as I evinced with a post-\nestimation validation test. Following Grimmer and King\n(2011), I assessed the quality of the clustering of encycli-\ncals on the two topics revealed by the LDA analysis by\ncomparing it to a qualitative human categorization and the\nCatholic Social Teaching classification.10 The differences\nbetween the LDA-based clustering and the other approaches\nis presented in the Appendix and shows that the LDA clus-\ntering has higher quality than these alternative clusterings\nof documents. Other validation tests that encompass a\nWordfish scaling evaluation (Slapin and Proksch, 2008)\nindicate that the clustering patterns of the main LDA esti-\nmations are robust.\nFigure 3. Two-topic model of post-1958 papal encyclicals. This figure illustrates the results of a two-topic LDA estimation process\nwith 50 random initialization values and indicates the relative loadings of encyclicals on spiritual (yellow) and political (green) topics.\nGenovese 7\nBut is the timing of the more political encyclicals random\nor is it in any way related to secular politics? To provide an\nanswer to this question, Figure 4 illustrates the schedule of a\nset of political encyclicals in comparison to a number of rel-\nBelow the plotted time line I highlight the years of the his-\ntorical events, while above the line I report the encyclicals\npublished along those years. Through this figure, it becomes\nclear that the political encyclicals systematically follow the\nhistorical events. More precisely, more political encyclicals\nare issued in the span of one to two years after the outbreak\nof an international episode. For example, the 1963 Pacem in\nTerris by John XXIII promptly followed the conflict between\nthe White House and the Kremlin during the Cuban Missile\nCrisis. Not surprisingly, the encyclical indicates that con-\nflicts \"should not be resolved by recourse to arms, but rather\nby negotiation\" (126). Similarly, the Centesimus Annus con-\ntains a message for states at the dawn of the post-Cold War\nera. In the 1991 encyclical, John Paul II writes that \"the free\nmarket is the most efficient instrument for utilizing resources\nand effectively responding to needs\" and the state has the\nduty of \"directing the exercise of human rights in the eco-\nnomic sectors\" (34, 48). Comparably, more recent encycli-\ncals make explicit reference to the costs of mishandling the\nBenedict XVI argues against an unregulated market econ-\nomy and concludes that \"in commercial relationships the\nprinciples of gratuitousness and the logic of gift as an expres-\nsion of gratuitousness can and must find their place within\nnormal economic activity\" (36). Importantly for my argu-\nment, Benedict XVI also indicates regrets with the way\n\"some states, power groups and companies hoard resources\"\nand expresses concerns with \"the development in poor coun-\ntries\" (49). Together with the topic models' quantitative\ninference, these qualitative excerpts support the argument\nthat the Vatican's release of political statements follow deep-\nening political crises and the incapabilities of states to deal\nThe theory is further validated through a more explicit\nSTM analysis, which permits to calculate statistical corre-\nlations between topics (the outcome variable) and external\ncovariates at the document level of analysis. To run STM, I\ngenerated the binary variable \"crisis\", which takes the\nvalue of 1 if the year in which an encyclical is published is\none of crisis ( t = crisis) or if the year was recently pre-\nceded by a crisis (i.e. t -1 and t - 2 ).12 The STM algo-\nonly with a model of minimum 3 topics, so I specify k = 3\n. This is basically the model specified to construct Figure 2\nwith the additional crisis covariate. Following Figure 2,\nTopic 1 should represent the more political themes, while\nTopics 2 and 3 are more concentrated on classical doctrine.\nSo, according to the theory, Topic 1 should be positively\ncorrelated with the crisis covariate, because the occurrence\nof an international crisis should lead to more political inter-\nventions by the Vatican.\nI estimate the mean difference in topic proportions for\nthe two different values of the covariate (0 for no crisis and\n1 for crisis). Figure 5 presents these results with 80% con-\nfidence intervals. The point estimates with respect to Topic\n1 are indeed positive and border the said level of statistical\nsignificance. This is evidence that the words captured by\nthe topic are triggered by historical events, and particularly\nby the crisis of international secular power. Topic 2 also\npresents a positive coefficient, although the confidence\ninterval is less reliable. More interestingly, the point esti-\nmate of Topic 3 is negative and statistically significant\n(even at higher levels of statistical confidence). This indi-\ncates that crises decreases the proportions of words cen-\ntered on highly spiritual concepts. Thus, the effects shown\nFigure 4. International crises cause more political encyclicals: selected events.\n8 Research and Politics \nwith this analysis indicate that the relative portions of top-\nics in the encyclicals are, to some extent, substitutes to each\nother. This is in line with the theoretical expectation.\nIt is especially important to underline that the mecha-\nnism outlined here seems to work regardless of the papacy\nin charge at the time of the encyclical. Of course, religious\nleaders give different importance to different issues and\ntake different positions on different social policies.\nNonetheless, the sensitivity of the Catholic church to inter-\nnational problems appears to translate into a consistent and\nsignificant political message independently on personal-\nity-based explanations. In order to illustrate this point, I\nexplore the most recent 2015 encyclical called Laudato Si.\nMany have depicted this document as a political break-\nthrough, if not even a political manifesto.13 In addition to\nits unprecedented focus on ecology and climate change, it\nis also the first encyclical fully written by Pope Francis,\nwho is considered an exceptionally modern pope for rea-\nsons related to his modest practices and his attachment to\nthe South of the world. Is his message really as different as\nsome have pointed out? Decomposing the document in\nword frequencies helps answering this question.As already\nhighlighted in the historical topic models, the 2015\nencyclical is focused on political issues, as human (uman-),\nsocial (social), development (sviluppo) and politics (polit-)\nappear in the list of the top 15 words. However, god (dio),\nworld (mondo) and creation (creato) appear as well and in\ncomparable amounts.\nAlong these lines, Figure 6 shows the loadings of the key\nwords that belong to the two estimated topic models. The\nfirst topic clearly captures the same spiritual theme found in\nthe aggregated historical calculations. Consequently, the\nencyclical is still dominated by a thorough discussion of\n\"universal destination\" and connectivity between god and\nmen. At the same time, the second topic is explicitly con-\nnected to my argument that the Vatican responds to the inac-\ntion of political institutions, because the encyclical\nrecurrently points to the issues that have stalled international\ndebates such as the United Nations negotiations on climate\nchange. For example, highlighting the fact that international\nleaders have failed at properly incorporating basic adapta-\ntion strategies in the international climate regime, the encyc-\nlical says, \"there is an urgent need to develop policies so\nthat, in the next few years, the emission of carbon dioxide\nand other highly polluting gases can be drastically reduced,\nfor example, substituting for fossil fuels and developing\nsources of renewable energy\" (26). Similarly, the Laudato Si\ntakes a position on the failures of carbon credit allocation by\nsuggesting that \"in no way does [emission trading] allow for\nthe radical change which present circumstances require\"\n(171). In sum, the encyclical clearly reacts to a series of\ninternational coordination failures, such as the infamous\nCopenhagen fiasco in 2009 and the saturated post-Kyoto\nProtocol negotiations after 2012. At the same time, it is built\non increasingly frequent demands for political change such\nas the 2014 Climate People's March, which has given\nmomentum to this global public issue. These observations\nare consistent with the theoretical argument: following pop-\nular demands and reacting to the political void of incapable\nstates, the church has systematically filled a rhetorical space\nfor political action.\nFigure 6. Word clouds of topics in 2015 Laudato Si. This figure\nillustrates the top words' loadings estimated from the two-\ntopic LDA model of the 2015 encyclical. Higher word font size\ncorresponds to higher word frequency.\nFigure 5. The effect of international crises on papal\ncommunications. This figure illustrates the statistical influence\nof crises included on the topical content of the encyclicals. The\nestimation is based on a STM specified with three topics (Figure\n2). Each dot corresponds to the estimated coefficient, while the\nline corresponds to the 80% confidence interval.\nGenovese 9\nConclusions\nPolitical scientists are increasingly interested in the role of\nreligion in international politics, and the study of religious\nattitudes and religious organizations is currently expand-\ning. However, little is known of how spiritual leaders use\npolitical statements with respect to world politics. In this\narticle I argued that religious authorities have an interest in\nmaking themselves heard on pressing global issues. I\nhypothesized that religious authorities should be more\ninclined to substitute rather than complement states' posi-\ntions on global issues, especially when such secular posi-\ntions are unclear, non-credible or non-effective.\nI tested my claim by studying the post-world wars encyc-\nlicals of the Roman Catholic church. The results from latent\ntopic models indicate that the encyclicals differ between those\nthat are more prominently spiritual and those that are more\ndominantly political. I find that the more political encyclicals\nare principally issued following moments of political instabil-\nity and coordination failures. Thus, the evidence suggests that\nthe church decides to explicitly address politics when states\nfail to do so. This holds across papacies and is also valid for\ntexts that may have generally been considered exceptional,\nsuch as the 2015 climate change encyclical.\nWhile the main lesson of this article is that the Vatican\nconsistently exposes the problematic aspects of worldly\ndisorders and inefficient governance through official docu-\nments, the author does not seek to argue that all Popes take\nthe same uniform political sides. In fact, the qualitative\ninvestigation revealed some variation in the formulation of\npositions. For example, Jean XXIII's Pacem in Terris and\nFrancis's Laudato Si seem to take more explicit stands\nagainst certain directions of action on specific topics, i.e.\nstopping nuclear deterrence or halting climate change with\nmarket instruments, than encyclicals such as Paul VI's\nHumanae Vitae, which is still critical but more generic.\nThese positions may vary across Popes, but my data is too\nlimited to test any claims on ideology. Future studies may\nwant to collect alternative data to evaluate the different\nsides of right- and left-leaning Popes. Additional work may\nalso build on this contribution to test whether my argument\ntravels other spiritual denominations beyond the Catholic\nchurch. Moreover, future research may expand on my anal-\nysis in order to explore how religious statements are con-\nnected to the observed behaviour of spiritual leaders in the\ninternational arena.\n"
