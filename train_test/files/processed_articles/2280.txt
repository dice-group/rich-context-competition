    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Ethnic minorities with depression are more likely to seek mental health care through primary care\nproviders (PCPs) than mental health specialists. However, both provider and patient-specific challenges exist. PCP-\nspecific challenges include unfamiliarity with depressive symptom profiles in diverse patient populations, limited\ntime to address mental health, and limited referral options for mental health care. Patient-specific challenges\ninclude stigma around mental health issues and reluctance to seek mental health treatment. To address these\nissues, we implemented a multi-component intervention for Asian American and Latino American primary care\npatients with depression at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).\nMethods/Design: We propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a culturally appropriate intervention to\nimprove the diagnosis and treatment of depression in our target population. Our goals are to facilitate a) primary\ncare providers' ability to provide appropriate, culturally informed care of depression, and b) patients' knowledge of\nand resources for receiving treatment for depression. Our two-year long intervention targets Asian American and\nLatino American adult (18 years of age or older) primary care patients at MGH screening positive for symptoms of\ndepression. All eligible patients in the intervention arm of the study who screen positive will be offered a culturally\nfocused psychiatric (CFP) consultation. Patients will meet with a study clinician and receive toolkits that include\npsychoeducational booklets, worksheets and community resources. Within two weeks of the initial consultation,\npatients will attend a follow-up visit with the CFP clinicians. Primary outcomes will determine the feasibility and\ncost associated with implementation of the service, and evaluate patient and provider satisfaction with the CFP\nservice. Exploratory aims will describe the study population at screening, recruitment, and enrollment and identify\nwhich variables influenced patient participation in the program.\nDiscussion: The study involves an innovative yet practical intervention that builds on existing resources and strives\nto improve quality of care for depression for minorities. Additionally, it complements the current movement in\npsychiatry to enhance the treatment of depression in primary care settings. If found beneficial, the intervention will\nserve as a model for care of Asian American and Latino American patients.\nBackground\nThe project proposes a randomized controlled trial to\nevaluate a culturally focused intervention to improve the\nrecognition and treatment of depression in Asian Amer-\nican and Latino American primary care patients at\nMassachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The interven-\ntion entails using multi-lingual consultations and toolk-\nits, for providers and patients, over the course of two\nvisits. Goals of the project are to facilitate a) primary\ncare providers' ability to provide appropriate, culturally\ninformed care of depression in adult Asian American\nand Latino American patients, and b) patients' knowl-\nedge of and resources for receiving treatment for\ndepression.\n* Correspondence: ntrinh@partners.org\n Contributed equally\n1Depression and Clinical Research Program, Massachusetts General Hospital,\nOne Bowdoin Square, sixth floor Boston, MA 02114, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2011 Trinh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Targeting both\nthe provider and patient in the intervention is impor-\ntant for a variety of reasons. Providers may face chal-\nlenges in correctly diagnosing depression in patients\nwhose ethnic background is different from their own,\ndue to difficulties in correctly identifying depressive\nsymptoms or using different cues or vocabulary to\ndescribe depression [2,3]. In addition, there may be\nsome variation in symptom presentations. For example,\nLatino Americans may give greater emphasis to somatic\ncomplaints than non-Latino Caucasians [4], and as\nAsian Americans become more acculturated, they tend\nto report worsening levels of mood symptoms [5].\nThese varying symptom presentations can differ from\nwhat most clinicians are trained to expect, resulting in\nclinical misdiagnoses [6]. Patients themselves are reluc-\ntant to seek treatment; Asian Americans may experience\nhigher levels of perceived stigma related to seeking\nmental health treatment, particularly from their families\n[7]. In addition, Latino Americans may have had fewer\nhelpful mental health treatment experiences than non-\nLatino Caucasians, which may make them less willing\nto seek treatment in the future [8].\nAs one solution to bridge this gap between provider\nknowledge and patient needs, Kirmayer et al. developed\nthe Cultural Consultation Service (CCS) model in 1999\n[9,10]. The CCS responded to requests for assistance\nplaced by primary care providers and mental health pro-\nfessionals facing difficulties with the assessment or treat-\nment of ethnically diverse patients. In their evaluation of\n100 cases referred to the CCS, Kirmayer's group found\nthat cultural misunderstandings were associated with an\nincreased risk for incomplete assessments, incorrect\ndiagnoses, and inadequate or inappropriate treatment.\nBy providing cultural consultations and formulations\nbased on the DSM-IV cultural formulation model, the\nCCS effectively improved diagnostic assessment and\ntreatment for their diverse population [9].\nIn a critical review of the literature, Van Voorhees et\nal evaluated interventions attempting to reduce dispari-\nties between non-Latino Caucasians and ethnic minori-\nties and found that multi-component interventions were\nsuccessful in improving depressive symptoms and func-\ntional status in nearly every study [11]. These interven-\ntions utilized a chronic disease management model,\ncomplete with case management, enhancement of access\nto care, and a variety of approaches tailored to the spe-\ncific system, provider, and patient factors. One study,\nthe \"Improving Mood-Promoting Access to Collabora-\ntive Treatment\" (IMPACT), not only improved all out-\ncomes, but also eliminated ethnic disparities [12]. This\ntrial randomized older adults with depression to usual\ncare or to an intervention including case management,\npatient education, and either medication or problem-sol-\nving psychotherapy within a collaborative care model\nincluding available psychiatric consultation. The inter-\nvention demonstrated a reduction of depressed mood by\nat least 50 percent as compared to usual care; however,\nthere was little cultural tailoring of the materials, i.e.,\nthe \"matching of study intervention goals and materials\nto the needs and sensitivities of specific populations.\" In\nfact, Van Voorhees et al concluded that none of the stu-\ndies in their review compared culturally tailored inter-\nventions with standard interventions in a randomized\ncontrol trial. They also wondered if \"structural changes\nin the pattern of delivery of mental health services\" and\n\"culturally tailored mental health service programs\" may\nprove to be particularly effective to minorities impacted\nby mental health issues [11]. The proposed intervention\nseeks to provide such a model to Asian American and\nLatino American primary care patients - understudied\npopulations in health care disparities intervention\nPreliminary Studies\nThe first part of the proposed intervention, conducting\nclinic-wide screening for depression, builds on the work\nby Dr. Albert Yeung. In one project using widespread\ndepression screening in an Asian American population\nused a Chinese bilingual version of the Patient Health\nQuestionnaire (CB-PHQ-9) to screen and identify\npatients with possible depression. Patients who screened\npositive were interviewed to establish psychiatric diagno-\nsis and to engage them in treatment. Their work\ndemonstrated that depression could be identified in this\nsample of primary care patients, using a translated\nscreening questionnaire and a culturally sensitive clinical\nevaluation to engage patients in mental health treat-\nment. In addition, 44% of those who screened positive\nagreed to come in to be assessed by a psychiatrist;\namong those who were then diagnosed with MDD, 93%\nwere willing to accept treatment. These findings demon-\nstrate that screening minority patients in primary care\nsettings can be both a feasible and effective tool to iden-\ntify patients likely to have clinical depression.\nMischoulon et al. reported that screening in primary\ncare settings may not be enough; independent screening\nby psychiatrists in primary care settings may not be ade-\nquate to ensure appropriate management of depression\nby PCPs [16]. In this study, patients were screened for\nMDD in a community-based primary care health center.\nFor those who met criteria for MDD, a letter was mailed\nto their PCP informing them of their patient's diagnosis\nof MDD. Forty outpatients, of whom 29 (72 percent)\nwere Latino American, were found to meet criteria for\nMDD. Medical record charts were reviewed 3 months\nlater to determine the PCPs' management following the\ndiagnosis. Of the 38 patients who remained in the study\nat 3 months, 20 (53 percent) received no intervention\nfor depression from the PCP, and of these, 14 (70 per-\ncent) were Latino American. Only five (13 percent) were\nprescribed an antidepressant by their PCP, nine (24 per-\ncent) were referred to mental health services for medica-\ntion, psychotherapy or combination treatment, and four\n(11 percent) were prescribed an antidepressant and then\nreferred to mental health services. Mischoulon and col-\nleagues concluded that possible explanations for this\nlack of treatment of depression may include time con-\nstraints during primary care visits, patient and/or physi-\ncian reticence, and insufficient education of PCPs about\nclinical depression. These findings suggest that screen-\ning and notification must be supplemented by additional\ninterventions if they are to have an impact on the care\nof depression.\nThe second part of this proposed intervention derives\nfrom a pilot project from our group that applied a cul-\nturally focused psychiatric consultation service for a\ngroup of high service-utilization patients. In the initial\npilot, the service was based on the Cultural Consultation\nService (CCS) model developed by Kirmayer et al [9,10].\nAs part of the consultation service, members of the pro-\nject team met monthly with case managers who were\nfollowing a group of chronically, medically ill patients.\nCases with difficult psychiatric issues were discussed,\nand formal consults could be requested for patients\nwhose presentation and treatment was complicated by\ncultural issues. Members of the consultation service also\nmet regularly to discuss cases. Results of the initial\nneeds assessment indicated that case managers per-\nceived a strong need for such a culturally focused psy-\nchiatric consultation service, but tended to refer patients\nfor psychosocial issues rather than for psychiatric diag-\nnostic assessment. Similarly, in a six-month follow-up to\nthe culturally focused psychiatric clinical intervention,\ncase managers were asked about their overall perception\nof the utility of the service and obstacles to its use.\nBased on their responses, case managers perceived a sig-\nnificant value, but tended to underutilize the service.\nThis experience suggested four hypotheses. The consul-\ntation service would benefit from: a) focusing on a spe-\ncific psychiatric diagnosis; b) targeting patients at their\nprimary care providers' offices directly, providing a\ngreater ability to connect with minority patients than an\nintervention that serves as a liaison to staff; c) making\nthe consultation service more user-friendly; and d)\nenriching the intervention with patient-focused materi-\nals, in order to maximize patient knowledge and skills.\nThese findings further supported the recruitment of\npatients through screening for those who meet criteria\nfor likely depression, rather than relying solely on refer-\nrals by PCPs.\nA final component of the CFP intervention was based\non the team's experience with adapting cognitive beha-\nvioral interventions for the treatment of depressive dis-\norders in chronically ill Latino Americans [17,18]. For\nexample, in a sample of HIV-positive foreign-born\nLatino Americans, a cognitive behavioral intervention\nwas linguistically/culturally adapted and administered by\nbilingual/bicultural staff. Participants received either a\n10-week cognitive behavioral stress management\n(CBSM) intervention or a one-day seminar. Results indi-\ncated that, compared to those who only received the\nseminar, participants who received the CBSM interven-\ntion reported significantly less anger, maladaptive cop-\ning, and HIV-related symptoms [19]. These results led\nto recommendations for including culturally-adapted\ncognitive behavioral therapy techniques within clinical\ninterventions for chronically-ill Latinos, for example, by\naddressing cultural factors such as familismo and\nrespeto.\nStudy Aims\nThis study is a randomized controlled trial of a cultu-\nrally focused psychiatric consultation model for Asian\nAmerican and Latino American primary care patients\nwith depression (see Figure 1). The primary aim of the\nstudy is to determine the feasibility, satisfaction and cost\nassociated with implementing a CFP consultation service\nwithin a primary care setting at MGH. Additionally, an\nexploratory aim serves to describe (e.g., demographic\nfactors; level of depression; service utilization) the parti-\ncipant patient population at screening, recruitment and\nenrollment, as well as to determine which, if any, of\nthese variables influence participation in the study (e.g.,\nconsent to be contacted).\nMethods/Design\nOverview\nThis is a randomized controlled trial of the CFP inter-\nvention. During the study period, all patients in partici-\npating primary care clinics will receive a screening form\nfor symptoms of depression; data on age, gender, race,\nethnicity and primary language will be obtained at the\ntime of screening. Asian American and Latino American\npatients who screen positive for clinical depression will\nbe contacted by study staff and invited to participate in\nthe CFP study. Eligible patients will be randomized\neither to the intervention arm or usual care based on\ntheir primary care provider. Patients in the intervention\narm will receive the CFP intervention over two visits\nand then called at six-months by study staff to adminis-\nter follow-up questionnaires (described below). Patients\nin the usual care arm will be called at baseline and at\nsix-month follow-up by study staff to administer ques-\ntionnaires (described below). To evaluate the cultural\ncomponents of the study, a number of qualitative inter-\nviews will also be conducted with participants in the\nintervention and usual care arms, and with members of\nthe target population who did not participate in the\nstudy. Please see Figure 1 for the study flowchart.\nDescription of Intervention\nThe CFP intervention includes two major components:\n1) Patients receiving the intervention will undergo a\nCFP consultation assessment by a member of a multi-\ndisciplinary team of mental health providers (e.g., psy-\nchiatrists, psychologists) who are bilingual and/or\nbicultural, trained in culturally competent techniques,\nand familiar with the cultures and languages of the cli-\nents served. The Engagement Interview Protocol and\nDSM-IV-TR Cultural Formulation model will be utilized\nto make a culturally appropriate diagnosis, assess the\npatient's psychiatric needs in a cultural context, conduct\na culturally focused intervention, engage the patient, and\nclinician will work collaboratively with the patient's PCP\nto communicate diagnostic and treatment recommenda-\ntions after the two-week follow-up visit. Given the criti-\ncal nature of communicating the CFP findings to the\nPCP, the CFP clinician will work with the PCP to deter-\nmine his preferences for communication. Recommenda-\ntions can be given to the PCP by multiple avenues: by\ne-mailed letter, and/or by page or phone call as needed.\nClinicians will make themselves available to PCPs on an\nas-needed basis throughout the study period.\n2) Patients will receive a culturally appropriate CFP\nconsultation patient toolkit, available in their language\nof preference (i.e., English, Spanish, Chinese, or Vietna-\nmese), as well as training in using the toolkit materials.\nThe patient toolkit was added to enrich the intervention\nby providing patients with psychoeducation, handouts\non managing depression based on cognitive behavioral\ntherapy techniques, and information on community\nresources [22]. To help in the management of their\n&\n1 PHQ-2 screen to be completed by patients at PCP clinics.\n2 Includes structured interview, self-report measures (e.g., depressive symptoms, service utilization) and electronic medical record review; letter with\nrecommendations to primary care provider sent either after baseline or two-week follow-up.\n3 Includes self-report measures (e.g., depressive symptoms, service utilization) and electronic medical record review.\n4 Qualitative interviews conducted after six-month assessment with study participants and members of target population.\nPrimary Outcomes\n-Evaluation of Project\nImplementation\n-Provider and Patient Satisfaction\n(Treatment Arm Only)\n-Cost Analysis\nExploratory Outcomes:\n-Description of study population\n-Quantifying the effect of\nintervention on Depression-related\noutcomes\nRandom\nAssignment\nby\nPrimary\nCare\nPractice\nIntervention Group: CFP Consultation\nInitial\nScreen\n(includes\nComparison Group: Treatment as Usual\nInitial\nScreen\n(includes\nTwo-\nWeek\nFollow-\nUp\nReview\nCFP\nToolkit\nSix-\nMonth\nSix-\nMonth\nBaseline\nCFP\nConsult\n&\nToolkit\nBaseline\nFigure 1 Clinical Research Intervention Design.\ndepression, patients will be encouraged to complete\nthese materials and bring them to visits with their PCP.\nIn addition, within two weeks of the initial consultation,\npatients will attend a follow-up visit with the CFP clini-\ncian to review and answer their questions about the\ntreatment of their depressive symptoms. The CFP clini-\ncian will also review patients' understanding of the\ntoolkit, including their use of the cognitive-behavioral\nbased handouts. To add flexibility in follow-up for\npatients, these visits can be done in person or over the\nphone.\nCFP Intervention Training\nAt the beginning of the study, CFP clinicians attend four\nhour-long training sessions on the CFP consultation\nstudy procedures to ensure that the intervention is\napplied in a standard fashion. Clinicians will audiotape\nall CFP sessions, and a weekly group supervision meet-\ning for CFP clinicians will be held to review cases and\nprovide supervision for issues related to clinical diagno-\nsis and intervention. Finally, the CFP consultation ser-\nvice will meet weekly to discuss consultation requests,\nfollow up on the impact of consultations, and to address\nother logistic issues.\nInclusion/Exclusion Criteria\nPatients will be included based on the following criteria:\nadults who 1) are 18 years of age or older; 2) are mem-\nbers of either targeted Asian American or Latino Ameri-\ncan minority groups; 3) screen positive for symptoms of\ndepression; and 4) are able to consent to study partici-\npation. Patients will be excluded if they have active\nunstable, untreated psychiatric illness precluding partici-\npation in the study (e.g., actively suicidal or homicidal\nor actively psychotic). Patients in the intervention arm\nwill be excluded if they have bipolar disorder.\nTarget PCP practices\nThe intervention will be conducted at four MGH pri-\nmary care practices; each PCP practice consists of multi-\nple sub-practices called pods.\nRecruitment strategy\nAll patients in participating primary care clinics will be\noffered screening for the symptoms of depression by the\nPatient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) as part of their\nroutine primary care visit [23]; data on age, gender,\nrace, ethnicity and primary language will be obtained at\nthe time of screening. Asian American and Latino\nAmerican patients who screen positive for clinical\ndepression will be called by study staff and invited to\nparticipate in the CFP consultation intervention. Patients\nalso may be referred by participating PCPs. For the qua-\nlitative interviews, a subset of study participants will be\ninvited to participate after the six-month follow-up visit,\nas well as eligible members of the target population who\nnot participate in the study.\nRandomization scheme\nPrimary care patients at MGH will be randomized by\npods, which comprise multiple clusters of 5-6 PCPs\nwithin each practice site. Using electronic medical\nrecords data from 2007, practices will be matched based\non an index composed of two variables: 1) the number\nof patients who are members of the target minority\ngroups and 2) the rate of diagnosed depression. Within\neach pair, one practice will be randomized to participate\nin the intervention and the other will be assigned to the\n\"usual care\" arm.\nTarget Health Condition\nAll patients in the intervention and usual care (control)\narms will be screened for clinical depression using the\nself-rated PHQ-2 at their primary care visit. Both\npatients and PCPs will be notified of positive screening\nresults for all patients assessed. For the intervention\narm, diagnoses of specific depressive disorders (major\ndepressive disorder, dysthymia, depressive disorder\nNOS, adjustment disorder with depressed mood) will be\nestablished during the baseline clinical interview using\nDSM-IV-TR criteria [21].\nDefinition of Usual Care\nPCPs of those patients who screen positive on the PHQ-\n2 in the usual care arm will receive written feedback on\ntheir patients' PHQ-2 results, in addition to a standard\nlist of referrals to MGH mental health resources. At the\nend of the study, patients in the usual care arm will be\noffered the intervention.\nHuman Subjects Approval\nAll study procedures have been approved by the hospital\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB).\nAnalytic Plan\nDescription of Measures (See Table 1):\nInitial Screen\nOn the screening form, patients will be administered\nthe PHQ-2 and asked additional questions about gen-\nder, age, race, ethnicity, and language spoken at home.\nUsing a cutoff score of two or above (out of a possible\ntotal score of six), the PHQ-2 has been validated for\ndiagnosing any clinical depressive disorder with a 82.1\npercent sensitivity, 80.4 percent specificity, and a posi-\ntive predictive value of 48.3 percent (assuming 18 per-\ncent prevalence of any depressive disorder) [23]; it\nconsists of the first two questions of the PHQ-9, which\nhas been translated into Chinese, Vietnamese, and\nSpanish [23-27]. The screening form will be available\nin multiple languages (English, Spanish, Chinese, and\nVietnamese).\nBaseline Visit\nBoth patients in the intervention and usual care arm will\ngive consent to participate in the study at the beginning\nof the baseline visit. In the intervention arm, assessment\nmeasures used at baseline to characterize the interven-\ntion patient population will include the Mini Interna-\ntional Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) [28], Quick\nInventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated\nScale (QIDS-SR) (see Appendix 2) [29], Global Assess-\nment of Functioning (GAF) [21], and Schwartz Outcome\nScale (SOS-10) [30]. Questionnaires regarding the\npatients' demographics and utilization of resources will\nalso be assessed. In the usual care arm, for target mino-\nrities who screen positive, the assessment measure will\ninclude the QIDS-SR and SOS-10.\nSix-month follow-up\nPatients will have the option to complete the visit over\nthe phone or in person. In both the intervention and\nusual care arms, patients will be given the QIDS-SR\nself-rated questionnaire and asked a brief \"Resource Uti-\nlization Questionnaire\" with questions regarding use of\nantidepressant medications, referrals/visits to mental\nhealth specialists, or alternative providers both in and\nout of the MGH system. The electronic medical record\nwill also be reviewed at baseline and at the six-month\nfollow-up for both intervention and usual care arms to\nobtain depression diagnoses, prescription of antidepres-\nsant medications, and referrals/visits to mental health\nspecialists in the system.\nSample size and power\nInitially, we planned for a total sample size of 506\npatients, split evenly between the intervention and usual\ncare groups. We calculated this sample size to yield 84\npercent power to detect a difference in the reduction of\ndepressive symptoms on the QIDS-SR by 50 percent in\nthe intervention arm versus 35 percent in the treatment\narm, paralleling the experience of patients in the inter-\nvention arm in STAR*D, an multi-center effectiveness\nstudy of Major Depression in primary care settings [31]\nas well as the experience of patients in usual care arm\nin several studies [32-34]. However, given the multiple\nrecruitment challenges we have faced to date, we have\nrevised our total sample size to 120 patients, split evenly\nbetween intervention and usual care groups. Although\nthis sample size is significantly smaller, the results of\nboth the qualitative and exploratory analyses of this\nstudy will inform further iterations of this intervention\nand study design.\nQualitative analysis\nThe project's implementation process and satisfaction\n(providers' and patients') with the CFP consultation\nintervention will be assessed in several ways. Qualitative\ndata will be collected through interviews, meetings and\nconversations with the project and primary care practice\nstaff, as well as reviews of project records and meeting\nsummaries. Interviews will be transcribed and translated,\nwith content analysis used to assess for convergent and\ndivergent themes.\nThe patient interviews will include samples of Asian\nAmerican and Latino American patients. In addition,\ninterviews will be conducted with members of the target\npopulation who did not participate in the study. The\ninterviews will be conducted by telephone, or in person\nTable 1 Patient measures administered over study period\nScreen Baseline\nAssessment\n2 Week Follow-\nUp+\n6 Month Follow-\nUp+\nQualitative\nInterview+\nMINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)* X\nQuick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology\nResource Utilization Questionnaire X X\nCFP Consultation, Assessment & Toolkit* X X\nGlobal Assessment of Functioning (GAF)* X\nPatient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) X\nPatient Satisfaction Questionnaire X\nSchwartz Outcome Scale (SOS-10) X X X\nDemographic Questionnaire X\nQualitative interview X\n*Intervention arm only.\n+ Visit may be conducted by phone.\nas needed. The interviews will assess the extent of\npatients' involvement with the project or perception of\nthis kind of intervention. All participants will be asked\nfor their opinions about offering this service through\ntheir primary care office and the screening process. In\naddition, intervention participants will be surveyed\nabout satisfaction, use of the toolkit, opinions about the\ncultural tailoring of the intervention, and asked for their\nsuggested changes to the intervention. Intervention\npatients will also be asked about their follow-up on\nrecommendations from the consultation and discussions\n- if any - with their PCP resulting from the intervention.\nUsual care participants will be asked about their use of\nmental health services, their understanding of the study\nwhen they enrolled, and their views on what they believe\nwould be important to include within toolkits or a cul-\nturally focused psychiatric consultation service.\nUsing open- and closed- ended questions, the project\nstaff and practice staff (including PCPs, practice man-\nagers and frontline staff) will be asked about their per-\nceptions of, experiences with, and satisfaction with the\nproject's implementation, including the screening and\nreferral process. The organizational structure and\nresources of each participating primary care practice will\nbe characterized at the beginning of the project to assist\nin the understanding and interpretation of implementa-\ntion differences across the sites. Through the review of\norganizational data and regularly collected project data\nand the interviews, the identified organizational issues\nwill be addressed with the practices, possibly identifying\nthe need for procedural changes or additional staff\ntraining.\nAdditionally, the costs of implementing and continu-\ning the program will be assessed. Initial startup costs\nand the ongoing costs of the intervention will be\ntracked. Both the direct dollar outlays associated with\nprogram implementation and the dollar values of pro-\ngram resources not reflected in the program budget will\nbe calculated. While the project budget and expenses\ncan be calculated directly from project data, work will\nbe done with practices to estimate the cost of consulta-\ntions and coordinating care.\nOther questions to be asked within this cost analysis\nwill be whether patients' utilization of practice and hos-\npital services\u00adincluding primary care, emergency depart-\nment and inpatient visits and their associated costs\u00ad\nchanged as a result of participating in this project. Costs\nof the care provided to the patients will also be com-\npared to the cost of usual care in the control group.\nUsing the figures above, the total range and average\ncosts of care for the patients receiving the intervention\nwill be calculated. A preliminary analysis also will be\nundertaken to look at differences in the use of services\nin the treatment versus the control group, i.e., if the two\ngroups differ in their utilization and costs of primary\ncare, emergency department visits and inpatient care.\nSuch cost analyses may provide preliminary estimates of\nthe costs of implementing such interventions in aca-\ndemic medical centers.\nExploratory analysis\nDescriptive analyses will be performed to provide infor-\nmation related to the study's experience conducting the\ninitial screening patients within their primary care\nclinics.\nData from initial screens will be utilized to provide a\ngreater description of the patient population at screen-\ning, recruitment and enrollment (e.g., race; ethnicity;\npreferred language; age; gender; level of depression (i.e.,\nPHQ-2 score); service utilization, as well as identify\nwhich of these variables, if any, served to influence par-\nticipation in the study. This information will allow us to\ndescribe, for example, whether consent to be contacted\ndiffers by level of depression and whether this is moder-\nated by demographic factors (e.g., race, ethnicity, gen-\nder). Additionally we will provide additional data\ndescribing rates of enrollment as compared to the total\nscreened.\nSecondary exploratory analyses will explore the impact\nof the intervention on depression. Patients' scores on\nthe QIDS-SR will be compared between the usual care\nand intervention arms. To measure changes in racial\nand ethnic disparities in depression recognition and\ntreatment, rates of depression diagnoses will be com-\npared from baseline to six-month follow-up for the\nintervention and usual care arms. As measures of the\nuse of any ongoing specialty mental health care, the\nrates of prescription of pharmacotherapy and referrals/\nvisits to mental health specialists as provided by patient\nself-report will be compared at baseline and at the six-\nmonth follow-up. Data analysis will be conducted using\nSTATA statistical software [35].\nA general linear model that accounts for clustering at\nthe PCP level will be used. Analyses of the main out-\ncomes will include as covariates any patient or physician\nfactors that differed significantly between study arms.\nOutcomes regarding diagnosis and treatment will be\nassessed using general estimating equations with a bino-\nmial link and standard errors will be adjusted to account\nfor clustering within practice. Separate analyses will be\nconducted for each outcome (i.e., dependent variables)\n\u00ad changes in depressive symptoms, diagnosis of and\ntreatment (prescription of antidepressant medications;\nreferrals/visits to mental health specialists) for depres-\nsion at six months after enrollment. The effect of study\narm on each outcome will be assessed, controlling for\nsignificant differences emerging from the bivariate\nanalyses.\nDiscussion\nThe intervention is designed to provide enhanced recog-\nnition and treatment of depression in Asian American\nand Latino American primary care patients, while pla-\ncing minimal additional burden on the existing primary\ncare system at MGH. Several challenges to the imple-\nmentation of this intervention exist, including minimiz-\ning burden to participating sites, recruitment and\nretention issues, and language and literacy issues.\nRegarding the first challenge, obtaining staff and part-\nnership buy-in during the grant-writing stage, and soli-\nciting feedback from all levels of administration during\nevery step of the process of designing and implementing\nthe study has been instrumental. Regular meetings with\nparticipating sites are crucial to clarify workflow, ques-\ntions about the service, and other issues that may arise.\nKeeping the protocols simple and easy to implement\nwill be critical.\nAs with any clinical research intervention, recruitment\nand retention (e.g., dropout, loss to follow-up) are con-\ncerns (40). This is particularly relevant for recruitment\nand retention of minorities. Within recruitment and\nretention, the CFP team will consider how and which\ncultural issues are applicable in order to target Asian\nAmerican and Latino American primary care patients.\nAmong these groups, examples of such characteristics\nmay include language and literacy, use of complemen-\ntary and alternative treatments, the perceived impor-\ntance of the quality of interpersonal relationships\nbetween the patient and CFP team, and the relationship\nbetween the PCP practices and the CFP team.\nTo address language and literacy issues, all materials\n(e.g., consent forms, study instructions) and the CFP\nconsultations will be provided in the patient's preferred\nprimary language, and materials for the toolkit will be\ndeveloped at a sixth-grade reading level. The patient\ntoolkit has also been prepared in audio CD format for\npatients with literacy issues. Recruiting research assis-\ntants and clinical staff with Spanish, Mandarin, Canto-\nnese and Vietnamese proficiency are crucial to the team.\nIf patients and providers indicate strong satisfaction\nwith the CFP intervention, it is hoped that the interven-\ntion can be expanded through a large scale randomized\ncontrolled trial of the intervention. Findings from such a\nstudy will provide evidence for the effectiveness of this\nmodel to improve the mental health of minorities in pri-\nmary care settings.\nAlthough this intervention is being piloted at MGH\nwith Asian American and Latino American patients, the\ngoal is ultimately to make it more generalizable with the\nability to disseminate the intervention to different set-\ntings. To this end, a crucial end-product of this inter-\nvention will be the creation of a manualized \"start-up\nguide\" which will include the tools used to develop the\nCFP consultation, including conceptual models, proto-\ncols used for assessment, implementation process and\nits evaluation. A detailed evaluation will be conducted\nto understand the implementation process and costs (e.\ng., start-up and implementation). This implementation\nevaluation and cost analysis will inform the generaliz-\nability of this intervention. Organizations seeking to\nimplement the CFP consultation intervention could use\nthis guide to inform the development of an intervention\nappropriate to their setting.\nRegarding dissemination, this consultation model could\nbe used in any health care setting with outpatient clinics\nand sufficient staffing capacity to create a psychiatrically\nfocused consultation service. Certainly, questions arise\nregarding the ability of an organization to implement this\nintervention with a significant minority population but\nfew bicultural/bilingual providers, or in a setting where\nproviders have not been trained to conduct similar cultu-\nrally focused interventions. Such an organization may\nneed concrete details regarding intervention implementa-\ntion as discussed above. Similarly, the organization may\nbenefit from seeking outside supervision and support\nfrom others experienced in conducting culturally focused\ninterventions. However, such supervision and support is\navailable and more readily accessible. One of the senior\nmembers of our team, Dr. Yeung, is an expert in the field\nof telepsychiatry and is currently developing a model of\ntelepsychiatry consultation via the internet for Chinese\nAmerican immigrants with depression. He is interested\nin eventually expanding a network of multicultural clini-\ncians that can serve as consultants to patients in areas\nwith underserved minorities, or as consultants to organi-\nzations planning to implement this model. The MGH\nCFP consultation team would be eager to serve in this\ncapacity. If this intervention is disseminated to other\norganizations, further research regarding the generaliz-\nability and dissemination process of this intervention\nwould inform this approach.\nBy improving the identification and treatment of\ndepression in Latino American and Asian American\npopulations, this intervention will help reduce the well-\nknown problems with under-recognition and under-\ntreatment of these minority patient groups. This CFP\nconsultation service complements the current movement\nin psychiatry to enhance the treatment of depression in\nprimary care settings, especially useful for minority\npatients who are unwilling or unable to access specialty\nmental health care.\nConclusion\nThe proposed CFP intervention complements the cur-\nrent movement in psychiatry to enhance the treatment\nof depression in primary care settings. This project\nserves as a model for understanding both a) the\neffectiveness of improving the mental health care of\nminorities in primary care settings; and b) the feasibility\nof this intervention through the use of an implementa-\ntion evaluation and cost analysis.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research project is funded by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation's program, \"Finding Answers: Disparities Research for Change\"\n(RWJF grant number 66709) to Dr. Trinh, with additional support from the\nMGH Department of Psychiatry.
