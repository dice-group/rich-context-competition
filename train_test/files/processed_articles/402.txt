    "abstract": "Abstract\nOsteoporosis, defined by low bone mineral density (BMD), is common among postmenopausal women. The distribution of\nBMD varies across populations and is shaped by both environmental and genetic factors. Because the candidate gene\nvitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) generates vitamin K quinone, a cofactor for the gamma-\ncarboxylation of bone-related proteins such as osteocalcin, we hypothesized that VKORC1 genetic variants may be\nassociated with BMD and osteoporosis in the general population. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped six VKORC1 SNPs in\n7,159 individuals from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). NHANES III is a nationally\nrepresentative sample linked to health and lifestyle variables including BMD, which was measured using dual energy x-ray\nabsorptiometry (DEXA) on four regions of the proximal femur. In adjusted models stratified by race/ethnicity and sex, SNPs\nwith decreased BMD among Mexican-American males (n = 795; p = 0.004). We then tested for associations between VKORC1\nSNPs and osteoporosis, but the results did not mirror the associations observed between VKORC1 and BMD, possibly due to\nsmall numbers of cases. This is the first report of VKORC1 common genetic variation associated with BMD, and one of the\nfew reports available that investigate the genetics of BMD and osteoporosis in diverse populations.\nCitation: Crawford DC, Brown-Gentry K, Rieder MJ (2010) VKORC1 Common Variation and Bone Mineral Density in the Third National Health and Nutrition\nEditor: Michael Hendricks, Harvard University, United States of America\nCopyright: \u00df 2010 Crawford et al.

Rieder3\n1 Center for Human Genetics Research, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America, 2 Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics,\nVanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America, 3 Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of\nAmerica\n Introduction\nThe candidate gene vitamin K epoxide reductase complex\nsubunit 1 (VKORC1) was first identified as part of the vitamin K\nepoxide reductase multiprotein complex (VKOR) in 2004 [1,2].\nThe product of VKORC1 is a rate-controlling enzyme in the\nvitamin cycle and is essential for the production of vitamin-K-\ndependent, c-carboxylated proteins such as clotting factors II, VII,\nIX, X protein C, S, and Z. Thus, VKORC1 has broad implications\nfor clotting, a property well-appreciated: even before the gene was\nidentified, VKOR has long been the target of warfarin, a\ncommonly prescribed anticoagulant used to prevent stroke and\nother thromboembolic events. It is now known that rare mutations\nin VKORC1 cause warfarin resistance, and common polymor-\nphisms in VKORC1 account a large proportion of the variability of\nwarfarin dosing in most populations studied [3].\nIn addition to having broad effects on the coagulation cascade,\nthe vitamin K cycle is also essential in the formation of the bone\nmatrix. Vitamin K, which is synthesized by plants (K1\n) and\nbacteria in the gut (K2\n), is a required co-enzyme for the c-\ncarboxylation of three glutamic acid (Glu) residues in osteocalcin,\nconverting them to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla). This post-\ntranslational Glu to Gla modification of osteocalcin, a bone and\ndentin protein produced by osteoblasts, is necessary for calcium\nbinding. Evidence suggests that vitamin K1\ndeficiency is associated\nwith decreased BMD [4,5] and that high-dose vitamin K\nsupplementation prevents fractures in at-risk patients [6]. Also,\nsome inconsistent evidence suggests that long-term warfarin\ntherapy, which by design inhibits the vitamin K cycle and\nprevents the Glu to Gla modification, is associated with low BMD\nin patients compared with patients not on warfarin-therapy [5,7].\nThis latter observation in humans, however, is not supported by\nrecent experiments in male rhesus macaques that demonstrate\nlong-term warfarin therapy does not affect BMD while on a diet\nhigh in calcium and vitamin D [8].\nDespite the discordant observations between humans and\nmacaques, preliminary studies in humans suggest that VKORC1\ncommon variation is associated with mean undercarboyxlated\nosteocalcin [9] and dietary vitamin K intake [9,10]. Based on role\nof VKORC1 in the vitamin K cycle and based on the preliminary\ndata presented in other studies, we hypothesized that common\nVKORC1 genetic variation is associated with BMD in humans. To\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) and tested for associations with measures of\nwith one another and are associated with warfarin dosing in\npopulations of European-descent [3,11,12]. We also tested for\nassociations between VKORC1 SNPs and osteoporosis, an extreme\nphenotype of BMD. Unadjusted and adjusted results suggest that\nVKORC1 SNPs are associated with these bone phenotypes in\nhuman, but their effect size is likely small compared with other\ngenetic and non-genetic factors.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy Population\nParticipants were consented by the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC) at the time of the survey and sample\ncollection, and consent included the storage of data and biological\nspecimens such as blood for future research [13]. The present\nstudy was approved by the CDC Ethics Review Board. Because\nthe study investigators did not have access to personal identifiers,\nthis study was considered non-human subjects research by the\nVanderbilt University Internal Review Board.\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the CDC.\nNHANES is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey\ndesigned to represent non-institutionalized Americans at the time\nof ascertainment [14,15]. NHANES is also a complex, multi-stage\nsurvey that oversamples minorities (non-Hispanic blacks and\nMexican-Americans), children, and the elderly. Sampling weights\nare calculated and provided for analysis to account for non-\nresponse bias and to adjust for the oversampling of specific groups\nso that all estimates are nationally representative. All participants\nwere asked to complete a household interview and physical\nexamination in the Mobile Examination Center (MEC). If the\nparticipant was not able to visit the MEC, a home examination\nlines were established from blood samples of participants .12\nyears of age. The total number of NHANES III phase 2\nparticipants was 16,530, and sample weights were recalculated\nusing methods previously described [16] for participants with\nDNA samples to avoid non-response bias. NHANES III DNA\nsamples became available to study investigators beginning in 2002\nBMD of the proximal femur was measured during the physical\nexam on non-pregnant female and male participants at least 20\nyears of age using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [20].\nBone mineral content and BMD are available for the femur neck\nregion (gm/cm2), the trochanter region (gm/cm2), the inter-\ntrochanter region (gm/cm2), the Ward's triangle region (gm/cm2),\nand the total region (gm/cm2). Cotinine levels were determined in\nparticipants using STC Diagnostics cotinine enzyme immunoassay\n(EIA) kits (Bethlehem, PA). Serum vitamin D levels were\ndetermined in participants using the DiaSorin radioimmunoassay\n(RIA) kit (formerly the INCSTAR 25-OH-D assay; Stillwater,\nGenotyping\nNHANES III DNA samples were distributed as aliquots of\ncrude cell lysates to study investigators. NHANES III DNA\nconcentrations vary and are estimated to range from 7.5\u00ad65 ng/\nmL with an average of approximately four micrograms in 100 ul.\nNHANES III DNA samples are distributed in 96-well plates along\nwith four 96-well plates of CDC-supplied blinded duplicates and\nblank controls. NHANES III experimental DNA samples are\nrandomly distributed across plates without regard to race/\nethnicity, sex, or case/control status. NHANES III DNA samples\nrepresent several major racial/ethnic groups, including non-\nMexican-Americans (n = 2,073), and other racial/ethnic groups\nTagSNPs were selected using LDselect [22] and the MultiPop-\nTagSelect algorithm [23] as previously described [3] for non-\nHispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks. A total of 16 tagSNPs\nbe successfully converted into a genotyping assay and was omitted\nfrom further genotyping attempts. Five tagSNPs were targeted for\ngenotyping because they represent the vast majority of common\nvariation in European-descent populations [3]. These five tagSNPs\nalso represent the haplotypes associated with warfarin dosing in\nboth non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks [12,24]. A\nnon-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks, was targeted for\ngenotyping given that there is evidence this is the functional SNP\nin the association with warfarin dosing [11,25].\nA total of six SNPs were genotyped in 7,159 DNA samples in\ngenotyped using Applied Biosystem's TaqManH SNP Genotyping\ngenotyped using Sequenom's iPLEXH Gold coupled with\nMassARRAY MALDI-TOF MS detection (San Diego, CA).\nThe SNP genotyping call rates ranged from 90% to 99%, with an\naverage call rate of ,95%. All SNPs were in Hardy Weinberg\nEquilibrium (HWE) at p.0.05, and all SNPs passed CDC quality\ncontrol measures based on tests of HWE on the experimental\nDNA samples and 368 blinded duplicates on CDC-supplied\ncontrol plates. All genotypes have been deposited into CDC's\nGenetic NHANES database and are available for secondary\nanalysis.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses were conducted remotely in SAS v9.2 (SAS\nInstitute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC) using the Analytic Data Research by\nEmail (ANDRE) portal of the CDC Research Data Center in\nHyattsville, MD. All analyses presented here were performed\nweighted. Unweighted analyses were not substantially different\ncompared with weighted analyses (data not shown).\nLinear regressions stratified by sex and race/ethnicity were\nperformed where BMD was the dependent variable. Models were\nadjusted for the following variables: age (in years; continuous),\nbody mass index (kg/m2; continuous), current smoking status\n(defined by ``do you smoke cigarettes now?'' or cotinine levels\n.15 ng/ml; binary); family history of osteoporosis (``Doctor told\nmother she had osteoporosis''; binary), thyroid disease (``Doctor\never told you had thyroid disease''; binary), menopause (defined as\na woman .60 years of age answering ``no'' to ``have you had a\nperiod in the past 12 months'' or as a woman with bilateral\noophorectomy answering ``yes'' to ``have you had one or both\novaries removed'' and ``both removed''; binary); hysterectomy\n(``have you had a hysterectomy''; binary), education (defined as\nless than high school, high school, and greater than high school\nfrom ``highest grade or year completed''; categorical), use of\nhormone replacement therapy (defined as ``ever/never'' from\nthree questions: ``ever take estrogen by mouth,'' ``have you ever\ntaken or used estrogen or female hormones in the form of vaginal\ncream,'' and ``have you ever used female hormones in the form of\npatches that are placed on the skin''; binary), and oral\ncontraceptive use (``have you ever taken birth control pills for\nVKORC1 and Bone Mineral Density in NHANES III\nany reason?''; binary). Dietary variables such as calcium (mg;\ncontinuous) and alcohol consumption (gm; continuous) were\ndefined from the 24-hour dietary recall.\nLogistic regression was performed where osteoporosis was the\ndependent variable. Osteoporosis was defined as less than or equal\nto 22.5 standard deviations from the mean BMD total region.\nThe mean BMD used to define cases and controls is based on\nparticipants 20\u00ad29 years of age in each sex and race/ethnicity\ngroup, which is based on the criteria outlined by WHO in 1994 (as\ndescribed in [26]). We adjusted models using the same variables\nfrom the linear regression.\nSNPs were included in both the linear and logistic regression\nmodels assuming an additive genetic model (genotypes coded as 0,\n1, and 2). SNPs were first included in the model without\nadjustment and then included in the fully adjusted models.\nResults\nThe study population characteristics are given in Table 2. For\neach VKORC1 SNP, unadjusted tests of association for BMD total\nregion were performed assuming additive genetic model stratified\nby race/ethnicity and sex (Table 3). Among non-Hispanic black\nmales, two SNPs were significantly associated with increased BMD\namong non-Hispanic white males (p = 0.011). No significant\nassociations were identified in non-Hispanic white females, non-\nHispanic black females, or Mexican American males or females.\nAdjustment for age, body mass index, smoking status, maternal\nfamily history of osteoporosis, thyroid disease, menopause,\nhysterectomy, oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement\ntherapy, education level, alcohol consumption, dietary calcium\nand vitamin K, and serum levels of vitamin D did not appreciably\nalter the associations observed in the unadjusted analyses (Table 4).\nassociated with decreased BMD among non-Hispanic black males\nsignificant in unadjusted models, was significantly associated with\ndecreased BMD among Mexican-American males (p = 0.004).\nGiven that VKORC1 SNPs were associated with BMD total\nregion, we tested whether VKORC1 SNPs were associated with\nosteoporosis. In unadjusted tests of association, only rs7294 was\nassociated with osteoporosis. This significant association\n(p = 0.001) was observed only among non-Hispanic white males\nS2). After adjustment for age, body mass index, smoking status,\nmaternal family history of osteoporosis, thyroid disease, education\nlevel, alcohol consumption, dietary calcium and vitamin K, and\nserum levels of vitamin D, the association between rs7294 and\nosteoporosis among non-Hispanic white males remained signifi-\nAdjusted models also revealed a significant association not\nobserved in unadjusted analyses (Table S3). Specifically,\nDiscussion\nWe genotyped six SNPs in the candidate gene VKORC1 in 7,159\nparticipants of NHANES III to determine if these common genetic\nvariants contribute to the variability in BMD in the general\npopulation. Previous studies suggested that the vitamin K cycle is\nessential to the formation of the bone matrix. Furthermore, patients\non long-term warfarin therapy, of which VKORC1 is the target, have\non average lower BMD compared with those not on long term\nwarfarin [7]. Our results suggest that common variants in VKORC1\nare indeed associated with BMD and perhaps osteoporosis, but many\nof these results are limited to African Americans. Also, the VKORC1\nSNPs, while associated at p,0.05, contribute very little to variability\nof BMD (,1%) compared with other risk factors, making it unlikely\nthat this locus is a major contributor to BMD as a main effect.\nThe weak contribution of VKORC1 SNPs on BMD and\nosteoporosis is not surprising given that BMD and osteoporosis\nTable 1.

Twin and family studies suggest 40\u00ad80% of the\nvariability observed in BMD in various study populations can be\nattributable to genetics [27\u00ad33]. Likewise, for osteoporosis, a\nfamily history of the condition is strongly associated with cases\ncompared with controls [34,35]. To date, the genetic component\ndescribed in these twin and family studies seems to consist of many\ncommon genetic variants, each with very small effects. That is,\ncandidate gene [36\u00ad39] and genome-wide association studies\nassociated with hip and spine BMD and/or osteoporosis, each\nwith effect sizes explaining ,1 to 4% of the variability in BMD or\nwith an odds ratio of ,1.5 for osteoporosis.\nThis is the first report of an association between BMD and\nosteoporosis and these VKORC1 SNPs in the literature. VKORC1\ngenetic variation on chromosome 16 is not in linkage disequilib-\nrium with genetic variation known to be associated with BMD\n(such as ESR1 variants on chromosome 6 [47]) through GWAS\nand candidate gene studies. Thus, the associations reported here\ncould represent false-positive findings or could represent associa-\ntions that fall below the accepted threshold for significance in\nnote, however, that our associations in BMD are mostly limited to\nAfrican American males. To date, few GWAS studies have been\nperformed in populations of non-European descent for BMD or\nosteoporosis, and none have been reported for populations of\nAfrican-descent. This latter situation has an impact on our ability\nto replicate the associations described here as GWA studies\navailable in dbGaP [48], the public repository for genotypes and\nphenotypes, are not from populations of similar genetic ancestry\n(i.e., the Framingham Heart Study is of European-descent). For\nearly replication studies, the preferred sequence of events is to first\nreplicate and confirm associations in populations of similar genetic\nancestry before performing characterization studies in other\nracial/ethnic populations [49].\nIndeed, differences in genetic variation and linkage disequilib-\nrium patterns may explain, in part, the population-specific\nassociations described here. As already previously described\n[3,50], the linkage disequilibrium pattern in VKORC1 differs\nbetween European-descent and African-descent populations, with\nthe latter having less pair-wise LD. Four of the six SNPs\nNHANES III are in strong LD in the non-Hispanic white\nnot in LD with other genotyped VKORC1 SNPs in non-Hispanic\nblacks and was associated with decreased BMD in males. This\nSNP, along with the three in LD with it, was not associated with\nBMD in the non-Hispanic white population. It is possible this\nindependent association observed in non-Hispanic black males is\ntagging a genetic variant not genotyped in this study that is more\ncommon in African-descent populations compared with Europe-\nan-descent populations. In contrast, the two SNPs in LD in non-\nHispanic black males were associated with increased BMD, but,\nagain, neither these SNPs nor the two SNPs in LD with them were\nassociated with BMD in non-Hispanic whites. The lack of\nassociation observed in non-Hispanic whites is less straightforward\naffects VKORC1 gene expression [25]. Nevertheless, it is still\npossible that the association with increased BMD in non-Hispanic\nblacks also represents an unknown genetic variant tagged by\nIn relation to VKORC1's association with warfarin dosing, it is\nassociated with increased BMD in non-Hispanic black males. The\nminor alleles of these two VKORC1 SNPs are also associated with\ndecreased warfarin dose compared with the major alleles [11].\nAnd, several studies have shown that these VKORC1 minor alleles\nare associated with decreased VKORC1 expression in liver [12,25].\nNHANES III participants are drawn from the general population,\nso the relationship between warfarin dose, BMD, and VKORC1\ncould not be directly assessed in this population.\nOf note, also, is the sex-specific nature of the associations\ndescribed here. It is already known that mean BMD differs by\nTable 4.

Additionally, previous segrega-\ntion, linkage, and association studies support sex-specific genetic\neffects for BMD [53,54] and osteoporosis-related fractures [37]. It\nis unlikely that power explains the lack of associations observed\namong non-Hispanic black females given that the sample size for\nthis subgroup (n = 809) is larger than the non-Hispanic black male\nsubgroup (n = 619). Also, in adjusted analyses, we included the\nsame demographic and dietary variables in all sex-specific models,\nwith the only differences related to female-only variables (such as\nmenopause, oral contraceptive use, and hormone replacement\ntherapy). We cannot rule out the possibility that unknown\nvariables (confounders) are responsible for the observed associa-\ntions in males only; nevertheless, the sex-specific effects are\nintriguing and warrant further study.\nThis is a large, population-based study of a diverse sample from\nthe United States. Despite the strength of sample size for BMD,\nthis study has several limitations. First, the age range of the study is\nwide, as participants in NHANES III aged 12 years and greater\nare available for Genetic NHANES III, and those $20 years have\nBMD measurements available. Attempts to examine older adults\nwith BMD are hampered by small sample sizes within any one\nsubgroup, as evidenced by the small number of cases of\nosteoporosis. Second, our study is a candidate gene study and\nnecessarily limited compared with genome-wide association\nstudies. Third, we did not adjust for multiple comparisons using\nBonferroni correction given this method is conservative when\nSNPs are linkage disequilibrium with one another [55]. Even if we\nchose to adjust using Bonferroni, it is not clear how to implement\nthis correction given each subpopulation has a distinct pattern of\nlinkage disequilibrium for this candidate gene [3]. Therefore, we\npresent here unadjusted p-values. Finally, Genetics NHANES III\ndoes not have ancestry informative markers or GWAS data\navailable to adjust for population stratification. We used self-\nreported race/ethnicity to stratify NHANES prior to analysis.\nWhile population stratification may still be a concern in this study,\nit is worth noting that previous studies have found self-reported\nrace/ethnicity is highly concordant with genetic ancestry deter-\nmined by genetic markers [56].\nIn conclusion, we describe several sex- and race/ethnic-specific\nassociations between BMD and VKORC1 SNPs in adults\nascertained for a large, population-based cross-sectional survey\nof the United States. This is the first report of VKORC1 SNPs\nassociated with BMD; therefore, further studies are required to\nreplicate and characterize the association to establish this\ncandidate gene as a locus relevant to BMD and perhaps associated\nphenotypes such as osteoporosis.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (r2) for\nNHANES III participants genotyped for six VKORC1\nSNPs, by populations.\nTable S2 Unadjusted and weighted single SNP tests of\nassociation, by race/ethnicity and sex, for osteoporosis.\nOdds ratios (95% confidence intervals) are presented.\nTable S3 Adjusted and weighted single SNP tests of\nassociation, by race/ethnicity and sex, for osteoporosis.\nSingle SNP tests of association were adjusted for variables in\nTable 2.
