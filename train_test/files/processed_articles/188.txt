Diabetes and\ncomorbidities (coronary heart disease, intermittent claudication, stroke, arthritis, and visual\nimpairment) were assessed by questionnaire. Physical disability was assessed by self-reported\nability to walk one-fourth of a mile, climb 10 steps, and do housework. Walking speed, lower-\nextremity function, and balance were assessed using physical performance tests.\nRESULTS -- Among subjects 60 years of age with diabetes, 32% of women and 15% of\nmen reported an inability to walk one-fourth of a mile, climb stairs, or do housework compared\nwith 14% of women and 8% of men without diabetes. Diabetes was associated with a 2- to 3-\nfold increased odds of not being able to do each task among both men and women and up to\na 3.6-fold increased risk of not being able to do all 3 tasks. Among women, diabetes was also\nassociated with slower walking speed, inferior lower-extremity function, decreased balance, and\nan increased risk of falling. Of the 5 million U.S. adults 60 years of age with diabetes, 1.2\nmillion are unable to do major physical tasks.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Diabetes is associated with a major burden of physical disability in\nolder U.S. adults, and these disabilities are likely to substantially impair their quality of life.\nE p i d e m i o l o g y / H e a l t h S e r v i c e s / P s y c h o s o c i a l R e s e a r c h\nGregg and Associates\nThree tests of physical performance\n(walking speed, chair stands, and tandem\nstand) were assessed at the physical exam-\nination using a standardized protocol\nsecond) was measured as the mean of 2 tri-\nals over an 8-foot course. Lower-extremity\nfunction was measured using the time to\ncomplete 5 stands (in seconds) from an\narmless chair 50-cm tall. Balance was mea-\nsured using a tandem stand, which mea-\nsures the number of seconds (maximum =\n10) that the participant can stand with 1\nfoot directly in front of the other. Among\nattendees at the physical examination, 464\njects on the walking speed, chair stands,\nand tandem stand tasks, respectively,\nrefused or had incomplete data. The pro-\nportion refusing or having incomplete data\ndid not vary according to diabetes status or\nsex (2% difference for all tests and\nspeed, chair stand, and tandem stand\ntasks, respectively, were unable to perform\nthe tests because of physical limitations\nand were categorized in the poor perfor-\nmance group for statistical analyses.\nCovariates\nAge, ethnicity, education, and smoking were\nassessed by questionnaire. Height and weight\nwere measured with a standard protocol and\nwere used to calculate BMI (in kilograms\nper meters squared). Self-reported weight\nand height were used to compute BMI for\nsubjects without physical measurements (n =\ntheir history of heart attack, congestive heart\nfailure, stroke, cancer, arthritis, or hip frac-\nture. Angina and intermittent claudication\nwere assessed using the Rose Questionnaire\n(15). Visual impairment was defined as diffi-\nculty seeing with 1 or both eyes (even when\nwearing corrective lenses).\nStatistical analyses\nAll analyses were conducted using SUDAAN\nto obtain estimates representative of the\ncommunity-dwelling U.S. population 60\nyears of age (16). Our primary analyses esti-\nmated the prevalence (crude and age- and\nduration-specific prevalence) of levels of dis-\nability (none, some difficulty, much diffi-\nculty, inability) in walking one-fourth of a\nmile, climbing 10 steps without rest, and\ndoing housework among participants with\nand without self-reported diabetes.\nWe used multiple polytomous logisti-\ncal regression to estimate the association\nbetween diabetes and disability level while\ncontrolling for age, ethnicity, education,\nand BMI (17). Ordinary multiple logistical\nregression was used to estimate associa-\ntions among diabetes and falls, injurious\nfalls, and poor performance (defined as\ninability or performance in the lowest quar-\ntile) on walking speed, chair stands, and\ntandem stand tasks. For polytomous\nregression, both cumulative (proportional\nodds) and generalized (multinomial) logit\nmodels were evaluated. Cumulative logit\nmodels provide a single estimate of the\nodds ratio (OR), assuming that the associ-\nation between the exposure (diabetes sta-\ntus) and the outcome (disability) is\nconstant at all levels of the outcome vari-\nable. The generalized logit estimates sepa-\nrate diabetes ORs for each level of disability.\nCoronary heart disease (CHD), stroke,\npoor vision, intermittent claudication, and\narthritis were added separately to the base\nmodels to evaluate their contribution to\nassociations between diabetes and disabil-\nity. Finally, we evaluated the association of\ndiabetes with disability while controlling\nsimultaneously for all measured diabetes-\nrelated comorbidities.\nRESULTS -- The estimated prevalence\nof self-reported diabetes was 13.1% among\nwomen and 12.4% among men. Among\nsubjects with diabetes, 23% of men and\n23% of women were taking no diabetic\nwomen were taking oral antidiabetic med-\nications but not insulin, and 29% of men\nand 34% of women were taking insulin.\nPeople with diabetes had higher BMIs and\nwere more likely to be nonwhite and to\nreport fair or poor health, cardiovascular\ndiseases, and visual impairment than indi-\nviduals without diabetes (Table 1). Women\nwith diabetes were also less educated, were\nmore likely to have angina and arthritis,\nand were less likely to have had cancer than\nwomen without diabetes. Men with dia-\nbetes were less likely to be smokers than\nmen without diabetes.

No signifi-\ncant associations were evident between dia-\nbetes and falls in men.\nDisability by age and duration of\ndiabetes\nThe adjusted odds of having a physical dis-\nability were higher with longer duration of\ndiabetes (P for trend 0.001 for both men\nand women).

Men with\ndiabetes were 50% more likely to per-\nform poorly on walking speed than men\nsignificant differences were evident on chair\nstands or balance, nor were differences evi-\ndent on walking speed after controlling for\ndiabetes-related comorbidities in men.\nEffect of diabetes-related\ncomorbidities\nAmong women, CHD and BMI were more\nimportant than other comorbidities in\nexplaining the increased disability risk\namong individuals with diabetes (Table 3).\nTable 2--Prevalence and odds of disability* according to diabetes status\nWomen Men\nNo No\nDiabetes diabetes Adjusted OR* Diabetes diabetes Adjusted OR*\nWalking one-fourth\nof a mile\nClimbing steps\nHousework\nmore tasks\nmore tasks\ntasks\nData are % or ORs (95% CIs). *Odds of each level of disability associated with diabetes compared individuals with-\nout diabetes obtained from a generalized logit model wherein individuals with no disability are the reference group.\nORs corresponding to total disability for each outcome were obtained from cumulative odds logit models (ORs\nrepresent overall odds of disability associated with diabetes). All ORs were controlled for age, ethnicity, education,\nand BMI. Tasks include walking one-fourth of a mile, climbing 10 steps without rest, and doing housework.\nGregg and Associates\nControlling separately for BMI and CHD\nreduced diabetes-related odds of disability\nby 24 and 34%, respectively, whereas con-\ntrolling for CHD and BMI together reduced\nthe diabetes-related odds by 52%. Con-\ntrolling for other comorbidities including\nstroke, poor vision, arthritis, and claudica-\ntion led to more modest reductions in dia-\nbetes-related odds of disability. Among\nmen, controlling for BMI had little effect on\ndiabetes-associated disability, but control-\nling for CHD and stroke each reduced the\nodds of diabetes-associated disability by\nties were added to the model, women and\nmen with diabetes still had a 50 and 46%\nincreased odds of disability, respectively,\nversus people without diabetes.\nCONCLUSIONS -- In this nationally\nrepresentative sample of older U.S. adults,\ndiabetes was associated with a 2- to 3-fold\nincreased risk of being unable to do mobil-\nity-related tasks. When applying this sam-\nple to the U.S. population, we estimate that\n1.2 million (or approximately one-\nfourth) of older American diabetic adults\neither cannot walk one-fourth of a mile,\nclimb 10 stairs, or do housework. Approx-\nimately one-half (or 2.5 million) have\nsome difficulty doing these tasks. Diabetes-\nrelated disability was also reflected in several\nphysical function tests, including slower\nwalking speed, chair stand performance,\nand balance. These findings are important\nbecause physical disability, whether mea-\nsured by self-report or by objective physical\nfunction tests, predicts future declines in\nhealth status, institutionalization, and\nhealth services use as well as serious reduc-\ntions in quality of life (1\u00ad6).\nAn excess risk of disability among\nadults with diabetes is not surprising given\nthe associated comorbidities, including\nCHD, peripheral vascular disease, stroke,\nvision loss, and neuropathy. Previous stud-\nies have related diabetes to decreased qual-\nity of life, including decreased physical, role,\nand social functioning and increased depen-\ndence on others to perform activities of\nalso been related to cognitive decline, which\ncould affect physical functioning (22).\nOur results suggest that CHD is a\nmajor contributor to diabetes-related dis-\nability among both men and women and\nthat stroke is an important contributor to\ndiabetes-related disability among men.\nComparison of models with and without\nadjustment for BMI suggests that obesity is\nalso an important factor influencing dis-\nability among women and raises the ques-\ntion of whether weight loss would decrease\ndisability among people with diabetes (23).\nVisual impairment, arthritis, and claudica-\ntion were also related to diabetes and were\nsecondary contributors to diabetes-associ-\nated disability in this study. Unfortunately,\nwe lacked data on other potential contrib-\nutors to disability, including neuropathy,\nFigure 1--Prevalence of inability to do 1 or more physical tasks for women (A) and men (B) strati-\nfied by age (in years) and diabetes duration.

We also lacked com-\nplete data on lower-extremity amputations\nand end-stage renal disease, but both of\nthese conditions are likely to be rare in this\nnoninstitutionalized sample.\nOur findings suggest that, in people\nwith diabetes, impairments in lower-\nextremity physical functioning are key con-\ntributors to loss of physical independence.\nIncreased risk of walking and climbing dis-\nability were paralleled by decreases in gait,\nbalance, and ability to do chair stands. Sev-\neral pathophysiological factors could medi-\nate these differences, including impaired\nblood flow and decreased muscle strength,\nmotor coordination, and proprioception.\nSimilarly, decreased cardiorespiratory\ncapacity has been associated with type 2\ndiabetes and may influence disability risk\n(24). In addition, hyperglycemia has been\nassociated with general weakness, muscle\ncramps, blurred vision, and dizziness (25).\nThis study is limited by its cross-sec-\ntional design, so disability may have pre-\nceded diabetes rather than the reverse.\nCross-sectional studies are vulnerable to\nsurvivor bias, which may partially explain\nwhy the disability rates were higher for\nwomen than for men. Disabled individuals\nmay have been more likely to be among the\nnonrespondents to NHANES III, which\nwould lead to an underestimation of over-\nall disability prevalence. Similarly, the fact\nthat NHANES III was conducted among\nthe noninstitutionalized U.S. population\ncould lead to an underestimation of the\ntotal prevalence of physical disability.\nMany of our variables were based on\nself-report, including diabetes status. Self-\nreported diabetes has been shown to be\nreliable as a measure of diagnosed diabetes\nnosed diabetes may have been misclassified\nin the nondiabetic group. We replicated\nour analyses among a subsample of adults\nin whom glucose measurements were avail-\nable and were thus able to classify individ-\nuals with undiagnosed diabetes. These\nanalyses yielded similar overall results and\nwider CIs because of the smaller sample\nsize. However, the relationship between\ndiabetes and walking disability was weaker\nwhen diabetes was defined by American\nDiabetes Association criteria because these\ncriteria likely resulted in a healthier sample.\nInherent limitations also exist in self-\nreports of physical disability. For example,\nreporting level of difficulty on tasks such as\nwalking or housework could be affected by\nsex, home environment, and how much\nthese activities are part of one's daily rou-\ntine. Previous research has found these\nmeasures to have high predictive and face\nvalidity, however, and associations between\nproblems with these tasks and diabetes in\nour study were supported by several objec-\ntive physical performance measures (5,6).\nThe results of this study may have\nimplications for disability prevention, clini-\ncal management, and disability-free life\nexpectancy of people with diabetes. Poten-\ntial strategies to limit disability include spe-\ncialized lower-extremity strength and\nbalance training, tai chi, and walking, which\nhave been shown to be effective in main-\ntaining muscle mass, in preventing falls, and\nin maintaining physical functioning (28,29).\nBecause a substantial proportion of diabetes-\nrelated disability was accounted for by pre-\nventable comorbidities, other preventive\ncare practices including weight control;\nmanagement of blood lipids, blood pressure,\nand glycemia; aspirin use; and foot and eye\ncare may improve long-term physical func-\ntioning. Continued surveillance of diabetes-\nrelated disability, increased awareness of\ndisability as a potentially modifiable com-\nplication, and use of interventions to reduce\ndisability should become health priorities for\npeople with diabetes.\nReferences\n1.
