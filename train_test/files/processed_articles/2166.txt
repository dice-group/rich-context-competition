Garces et al15 noted small posi-\ntive, insignificant effects on educational attainment of the\nyounger siblings of Head Start participants but a signifi-\ncant reduction of 11% in the risk of being charged with a\ncrimeamongtheyoungersiblingsofAfricanAmericanpar-\nticipants.Ifsucheffectswereseenmorebroadly,theywould\nprovide additional justification for early childhood educa-\ntional programs, especially those with a parenting compo-\nnent. To address this issue, we examined outcomes for\nyounger siblings born after the intervention child in IHDP\nby obtaining interviews and developmental observations\nduring the age 18\u00adyear follow-up of the IHDP sample.11\nMETHODS\nThe IHDP was a multisite randomized controlled trial of an edu-\ncational intervention until 3 years of age for low-birth-weight pre-\nterm infants at 8 sites. Infants were sampled from 2 birth-weight\n2499 g [heavier low-birth-weight (HLBW) group]) to ensure an\noversample of those at higher developmental risk (LLBW group)\nand continuity with studies of poor, normal-birth-weight chil-\ndren(HLBWgroup).Randomassignmenttothearmsofthestudy\nresulted in balance by sociodemographic and health variables\nknown to affect child development (see the \"Baseline Variables\"\nsubsection). The intervention (INT) consisted of home visits\nweekly for the first year and every other week in the second and\nthird years and daily center-based education beginning at 12\nmonths and continuing until 36 months of age (both corrected\nfor duration of gestation). At all sites, both components fol-\nlowed structured protocols and a common curriculum designed\nto enhance parental abilities to anticipate and foster child devel-\nopment and to address other issues affecting parents' lives.16-18 All\nchildren received intensive pediatric follow-up care, which for\nthe other arm of the study was the only service provided (fol-\nlow-up only [FUO]). The program and its results have been de-\nscribed in detail elsewhere.13,19-22 In summary, at the end of the\nintervention period (3 years of age), all participants in the INT\ngroup averaged higher IQ and lower behavioral problem scores\nthan those in the FUO group.19 In addition, measures of the home\nenvironment and parenting behaviors favored the INT group.23,24\nAt subsequent ages, no differences in IQ, achievement testing, or\nbehavior were seen for the LLBW children. In the HLBW group,\nthe INT group had persistently higher IQ scores compared with\nthe FUO group, but the differences were smaller than at the end\nof the intervention. In addition, the HLBW group had higher\nachievement scores and exhibited less risky behavior.11,20,21 Sub-\nsequent childbearing among the IHDP mothers was equivalent\nin both arms of the study at the 36-month assessment.25\nAs part of the preparation for the assessment at 18 years of\nage, personnel at the study sites were asked to identify younger\nsiblings born within 5 years of the study child based on records\nheld at the study sites from the follow-up at 8 years of age. Five\nyearswasselectedtoidentifyyoungerchildrenbornrelativelysoon\nafter the IHDP child who might benefit from the parent-focused\ncomponents of the intervention and likely not to be the product\nof new family formation. In instances of multiple eligible sib-\nlings, we selected the sibling closest in age to the IHDP child of\nthe same biological mother. Twin siblings of the IHDP child were\nnot eligible for assessment because they participated in the INT\nphase according to a prespecified protocol.13\nThe assessment of younger siblings included psychological ob-\nservations and interviews with the sibling and primary care-\ngiver. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Wechs-\nler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence.26 The Wechsler scale\nprovides IQ information and includes total, verbal, and per-\nformance IQ scores referenced to a mean (SD) of 100 (15).\nTheyouthwereaskedtoreportontheirownbehavior,expec-\ntations of future success, and relationship with the primary care-\ngiver.

Future expecta-\ntionswereascertainedusing9questionsselectedfromapreviously\nused scale to ascertain the likelihood of higher education, a good\npaying job, a happy family life, friends, and good health.28 Each\nitem was answered along a 5-point Likert scale from very low to\nvery high likelihood, with higher scores indicating higher expec-\ntationsofsuccess.Finally,theyouthwereasked12itemsfromthe\nConflictTacticsScaleforParentandChild29 selectedfromthever-\nsion fielded in the third wave of the Project on Human Develop-\nment in Chicago Neighborhoods.30 Items were selected to reflect\narangeofparentingdisciplinarystrategiesbutnotthosethatmight\nrequireareporttochildwelfareagencies.Theitemsarescoredon\na 6-point scale from never happened to happened more than 20\ntimes in the past year; items were scored as written if reported as\nsingledigitsorinthemiddleofthosereportedasranges.31 Thescores\nPrimary caregivers provided information on attendance at\nschool, grade and school difficulties (classification for special\neducation or repetition of a grade), and expectations for how\nfar they thought the sibling would go in school. They also pro-\nvided the sibling's birth weight and sex.\nA standard set of variables obtained at the beginning of the study\nbefore randomization was used to compare participants and non-\nparticipants in this assessment and to adjust the outcomes for\ndifferences across sites. These included maternal age in years\nat the time of the birth of the IHDP participant; maternal race/\nethnicity (African American, Hispanic, and white/other as self-\ndeclared by the mother at the time of recruitment into the study);\nmaternal educational attainment at the time of the birth of the\nIHDP participant (high school graduate, high school gradu-\nate, and high school graduate); and study site: Arkansas (Little\nRock), Einstein (South Bronx, New York), Harvard (Boston,\nMassachusetts), Miami (Miami, Florida), Pennsylvania (Phila-\ndelphia), Texas (Dallas), Washington (Seattle), and Yale (New\nHaven, Connecticut). In addition, they included the birth weight\nstratum (LLBW or HLBW) and the arm of the study of the IHDP\nparticipant (INT or FUO).\nDistributions by the baseline variables were used to compare\nstudy participants at 18 years of age with and without younger\nsiblings and to compare younger siblings who did and did not\nparticipate (ie, completed an interview and/or psychological as-\nsessment).

As done pre-\nviously,11 the effect of the losses to the cohorts on the out-\ncomes was assessed using separate linear (analysis of covariance)\nmodels for each outcome variable derived from the S-plus soft-\nware.32 These models controlled for the baseline variables mea-\nsured at enrollment to estimate the differences between INT\nand FUO groups. The linear models provided population mar-\nginal mean values and differences (INT vs FUO) for each out-\ncome by substituting into the linear model the average values\nof the covariates. Nominal P values derived from the linear mod-\nels were used for primary outcome comparisons. Under the mod-\neling assumptions, this method removes nonresponse bias.\nThe study was approved by the institutional review boards of\nall participating institutions.

As predicted, the home\nenvironments and parenting skills were rated as more\nlikely to be associated with better child develop-\nfavoring the intervention, no long-term changes were seen.\nOne explanation for the lack of sibling effect is that\nthe parenting components of early childhood education\nprograms may contribute to the differences shortly after\nthe intervention period but not account for a significant\nportion of the sustained effects seen in some programs,\nwhich may directly influence the child.2,3,34 This hypoth-\nesis has been experimentally tested in only 1 evaluation\ncomparing a strategy of home visits only in which most\nof the intervention would be through the parents, with\na strategy of home visits plus high-quality early child-\nhood education and using the curriculum from which\nthe IHDP program was developed.35 In comparison with\nthe control participants, significant differences in child\noutcomes were seen with the strategy of home visits plus\nhigh-quality early childhood education but not with the\nhome-visits-only program. Other suggestive evidence is\nderived from observations that effect sizes for parenting\noutcomes across numerous studies are smaller than those\nfor child outcomes,36,37 including the lack of overall dif-\nferences in maternal outcomes by study arm in IHDP at\nSeveral factors may account for the lack of a sibling ef-\nfect in IHDP compared with other studies and include the\nsociodemographic characteristics of participating fami-\nlies, the nature of the parental tasks for supporting devel-\nopment, and changes or differences in families who re-\nceivedearlyinterventionprograms.TheIHDPisnotastudy\nsolely of disadvantaged families, and many of our partici-\npants would have had the resources to support the devel-\nopment of their children as suggested by the lack of effect\nin the original trial in more advantaged sites or fami-\nlies19,33 andbythehigherIQsamongtheIHDPsiblingscom-\npared with those for the siblings in the Early Training Pro-\ngram (85).14 We continued to see no difference when\nthe analyses were restricted to less-educated mothers, but\nthe power for this analysis was limited.\nWhere sibling effects have been observed more fre-\nquently are studies of serious behavioral problems.39-41\nProviding parents with standard ways of fostering posi-\ntive behaviors and extinguishing negative ones may be\nmore generally applicable across children than the ob-\nservation and tailoring of developmental tasks used in\nIHDP.17,18 Moreover, in some studies, the siblings were\nclearly involved in the intervention.39,40 Finally, many of\nthese studies relied on parental report of behavioral prob-\nlems as the outcome, with the suggestion that the inter-\nvention may not diminish the behavioral problems but\nrather the parental distress in response to them.41\nWhere sibling effects have been seen in developmen-\ntal studies, they occur in the context of profound changes\nin the families with greater maternal educational attain-\nment,limitationsinfamilysize,andgreatereconomicwell-\nbeing.42 Alternatively, families may differ at baseline, such\nas those who seek out educational opportunities for their\nchildren (as in Head Start) in unknown ways that would\nlead to better developmental and school outcomes,43 thus\naccounting for better outcomes among younger sib-\nlings. In IHDP, the 2 study arms were carefully bal-\nanced for significant predictors of child outcomes13,19; dif-\nfered very little in maternal workforce participation,\nfurther maternal educational attainment, or subsequent\nchildbearing at the end of the intervention phase25; and\nshowed no long-term differences in a variety of mater-\nnal attitudes or behaviors at 18 years of age.38 Thus, our\nresults differ from studies of disadvantaged populations\nOur results should be considered in the light of some\nof the limitations of the study. One limitation is the lack\nof early childhood data on the younger siblings. We did\nnot, for example, have information on birth or early health\nevents that might affect school performance and later out-\ncomes or on the child care arrangements and early educa-\ntional experiences of these youth. In addition, although we\nattempted to account statistically for siblings not as-\nsessed, cohort attrition may have affected the results. Like-\nwise, the youth were still in school; therefore, we were un-\nable to assess their long-term outcomes, such as school\ncompletion and criminal behavior, which is in contrast to\nthe study by Garces et al,15 who reported differences.\nDespite these limitations, this study adds to the lit-\nerature on the effects of early childhood education. In\nparticular, it raises questions about the potential for ef-\nfects other than those seen among the primary targets of\nan educational intervention.\nCorrespondence: Marie C.
