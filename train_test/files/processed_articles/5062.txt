The\nresult is somewhat troublesome, because of the effect of supposedly irrelevant factors. For instance,\nnot just the intensity gradient determines the resulting perception, the circular outline is just as\nimportant (a square outline yields a very different perception; Wagemans, van Doorn, & Koender-\nink, 2010). However, this basic pattern has been adopted in a large volume of research, which is the\nreason why we used it in the present study (Figure 1).\nMost observers report that the basic stimulus appears to them as a pictorial relief, modulated\nin depth. A small group of observers sees a flat intensity gradient (we are not in a position to put a\nnumber on this, from our experience, we would guess at least one out of ten). Observers who report a\ndepth articulation declare to see either a \"cap\" (convexity, like the outside of an eggshell) or a \"cup\"\n(1) We say \"conventional stimulus,\" because this is the stimulus that pervades the literature on \"shape from\nshading\" from the earliest times on. There is no doubt it was (and is) used because conceived of as \"the minimal\nstimulus\". However, this it is not. The conventional stimulus is made up of a localized linear gradient (which\nindeed might count as a \"minimal stimulus\") and a circular disk with a sharp edge. The edge typically accounts for\nmuch of the shape impressions evoked by the stimulus. For instance, changing it to a square evokes a cylindrical,\ninstead of spherical shape, and changing it to triangular induces a conical shape. The true \"minimal\" stimulus\nwould be a localized gradient in the appropriate formal sense (scale space; Koenderink, 1984), thus an intensity\ndistribution modulated with the first derivative of a symmetric Gaussian function. It is hardly ever used although\nbecause the edge is so important in inducing a phenomenal three-dimensional shape impression (Erens, Kappers,\n& Koenderink, 1993), that is to say, because of the mixed nature of the conventional stimulus.\nAwareness of the light field: the case of deformation\n*Corresponding author.\n(concavity, like the inside of an eggshell). The depth ambiguity has been familiar for a long time (Rit-\ntenhouse, 1786). As we have argued elsewhere, the fact that only caps or cups are reported is perhaps\nsurprising, since inverse optics shows that cylinders (either convex or concave) and saddle shapes are\nequally valid interpretations. Here \"valid\" refers to \"Shape From Shading\" (SFS) theory, based on\nwe mention only Belhumeur, Kriegman, & Yuille (1999), Forsyth & Ponce (2002), Horn & Brooks\nDiggelen (1959), From a Bayesian viewpoint, saddles should be the preferred interpreta-\ntion (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2003b). Whereas cylinders are indeed reported for a square outline,\nsaddle shapes are (in our experience) never spontaneously reported. The \"cap or cup\" decision is often\ndetermined by the direction of the gradient, which is possibly interpreted as the direction of illumina-\ntion in the \"scene\".\nIt is well known that a group of such basic stimulus patterns tends to \"synchronize\" (Kleffner &\nRamachandran 1992). That is to say, when you view a group of such stimuli with gradient directions all\nlined up, one tends to be aware of a group of all caps or all cups (Figure 2, left). If there is an outlier in a\nflock of caps, it is often reported as a cup and vice versa (Figure 2, second from the left). This finding is\nalso related to the work on the perception of light flow direction (Koenderink & Pont 2003; Koenderink\nand van Doorn, 1996; Koenderink, van Doorn, & Pont, 2004; Koenderink, van Doorn, Kappers, te Pas,\nIn the Appendix, we explain the concept of \"light field\" and \"surface illuminance flow\" in some detail.\nRoughly speaking, the \"light field\" describes the transport of radiant power, whereas the \"surface illu-\nminance flow\" describes the aspect of the illumination that photometrically reveals the roughness of the\nilluminated surface.\nRecently, we have found (van Doorn, Koenderink, & Wagemans, 2011) that this \"synchroniza-\ntion\" (a kind of \"grouping\") also occurs for divergent and convergent illuminance flows (Figure 2,\nthird from left) but not for rotational illuminance flows (Figure 2, right). This is interesting, because\nall first-order singularities of the illuminance flow field (i.e., divergence, rotational, and deformation\napparent selective sensitivity appears perhaps surprising. In any case, it is a nontrivial property of the\nFigure 1. The conventional stimulus pattern used in psychophysical shape from shading research.

Third from left has concurrent gradient directions (divergent illuminance flow).\nRight, a group of basic stimuli with a rotational illuminance flow.\nLight field deformation blindness 469\nstructures in human visual awareness. The stimuli shown in Figure 2 may be understood as abstrac-\ntions from naturally occurring patterns, rendered suitable for a structured empirical investigation.\nIn Figure 3, we show the basis for the linear (local) approximation of illuminance flow fields.\nThe zeroth-order, unidirectional, uniform field can be locally deformed by linear combinations of\nthese four patterns. When the uniform flow vanishes, at singular points of the illuminance flow field,\none generically has a purely linear flow pattern. All these components occur in the natural environ-\nment. Thus, it makes sense to find out whether deformation patterns can group (like divergent pat-\nterns) or not (like rotational patterns).\nIn this paper, we test whether human observers are able to group deformation patterns as they do\nuniform or divergent patterns or whether they are blind to these as they are to cyclic (rotational) pat-\nterns.\nObservers\nObservers AD, JK, JT, and JW were the authors, whereas EG, MS, RK, and SC were naive to the\nissue. We do not consider the addition of a group of naive observers to be essential, because we are\ninterested in a possible form of selective blindness. If a group of experienced observers turns out to\nbe unable to group deformation patterns, it is hard to imagine why this would be different for naive\nobservers. Moreover, the advantage of the experienced observers is that they are very well docu-\nmented as observers in various subdomains of visual perception. Three (AD, JK, and JW) were also\nobservers in a previous, related study (van Doorn et al., 2011). One (JT) has a known tendency to re-\nport only \"caps\" (never \"cups\") when confronted with the conventional stimulus pattern. As it turned\nout to be the case (see Results), both groups of observers yielded equivalent results.\nStimulus design\nThe stimulus design was similar to that used in an experiment upon which we have reported before\n(van Doorn et al., 2011). The only difference is the number of basic stimulus patterns placed on the\nannulus (Figure 4), which is eight in the present and six in the previous experiment. The number is\nimportant, because the deformation stimuli cannot be represented very well using only six samples,\nwhereas eight samples suffice.\nFigure 3. A basis for the first-order structure of the illuminance flow. Any first-order structure can be expressed\nas a linear combination of these components. At top left one has a divergence, at top right a rotation, in the bottom\nrow, two mutually independent deformation patterns. The divergence and rotation are specified by magnitude\nalone, the deformations also have an orientation.\n3 Experiments\nWe report on two related experiments. Both potentially yield an answer to our research question,\n\nalthough the second experiment perhaps allows some additional conclusions.\nSimultaneous task\nIn the \"simultaneous task,\" we presented stimulus patterns like those shown in Figure 4, randomly\nrotated over some multiple of 45\u00ba. The observer fixated the red cross, then was presented with the\npattern for 2 s, after which the observer had to indicate whether the eight patterns were either\n\u00b7 all caps,\n\u00b7 all cups,\n\u00b7 not all the same.\nThis is a simple, overall decision. When all subpatterns are either cup or cap, the whole pattern\nlooks like it was made of one piece, it becomes a single Gestalt.\nThe patterns were presented on a computer screen. The background gray disk was 15 cm in\nFigure 4. Left, The stimulus patterns used in the experiment. At top left a uniform field, at top right a random field\n(of course this is just one instance, all instances are different). The bottom row shows two deformation fields with\ndifferent orientations. The red cross is used for fixation. Right, the same patterns, but shading gradient indicated\nwith arrows.\nFigure 5. The presentation sequence for the simultaneous task. Each trial starts with a blank plus fixation mark.\nThis enables the observer to fixate the red mark. The observer initiates the next presentation, which presents the\nstimulus pattern for 2 s. In the next phase, the blank pattern is on until the observer has responded. The response\nindicates a triadic judgment: all caps, all cups, or mixed.\nLight field deformation blindness 471\ndiameter and binocularly viewed from 50 cm. Room lights were dimmed. The trials were self-paced\nby the observers (See Figure 5.)\nObservers were tested with 500 presentations in all (1,000 AD, JK, JT, and JW), equally distrib-\nuted over uniform, random, and deformation fields, in random order. In the case, the observer felt\nfully uncertain, the trial could be dumped, and another one initiated. This happened in not more than\nabout one in 100 cases. Overall, all observers judged the task as \"easy but dull\". All but one observ-\ners completed the task in one session, observer JW needed two sessions.\nFor the uniform patterns, we checked how the all cap/cup report correlated with the direction of\nthe gradient (Figure 6). We find the expected pattern for the observers. Outlier is observer JT, who\n(as we knew) will never report all cups. The remaining observers have a strong but idiosyncratic\npreference for cap over cup.\nConclusions simultaneous task\nThe results of responding \"caps\", \"cups\", or \"different\" are shown as a triangle plot in Figure 7. One\nhas to judge whether the deformation results are more like the random or the uniform results. The\nanswer is immediately obvious. The result for the deformation patterns is like that for the random\npatterns, and very different from that for the uniform patterns.\nThe conclusion is that human observers fail to group deformation into a single Gestalt. The\nFigure 6. At left, the polar frequency plot for reporting \"all caps\" (red) or \"all cups\" (blue) as a function of the\ndirection of the gradient. The concentric areas show the quartiles over all observers. Notice the decided preference\nfor cap over cup. At right, the plot for observer JT. This observer is special in that he never reports awareness of\nall cups.\nFigure 7. Triangle plot of responding convex (\"all caps\"), concave (\"all cups\"), or \"different\". The elliptical\nareas show the 95% and 50% probability areas, the dots show individual cases. The bluish area corresponds to the\nuniform pattern, the reddish area to the random patterns, whereas the yellowish area represents the deformation\npatterns. Conclusion is that the results for the deformation patterns resemble those for the random, rather than the\nuniform patterns.\ndeformation patterns look qualitatively different from the uniform patterns (and, to the three ob-\nservers who participated in an earlier experiment, to the convergence or divergence patterns). They\nlook more like the random patterns (and again, to the three observers who participated in an earlier\nexperiment, to the rotation patterns).\nSuccessive task\nIn the \"successive task,\" we again presented stimulus patterns like those shown in Figure 4. The ob-\nserver fixated the red cross and was then presented with the pattern for 1 s. After this, there came two\nsuccessive periods of half a second each. In each period, one subpattern was indicated with an easily\nvisible dot. For the first period, the dot was red; for the second, it was blue. In this task, the observer\nhas to indicate, for both the first and the second interval, whether the indicated subpattern was judged\nto be a cap or a cup. Thus, there are four possible responses, namely cap-cap, cup-cup, cap-cup or\ncup-cap. In the former two cases, the two partial responses are correlated; in the latter two cases,\nthey are anti-correlated. (See Figure 8.)\nThe timing of the presentations is important. Naive observers initially tend to complain that the\npresentation is fast, although they evidently are able to handle it. Experienced observers sometimes\ncomplain of the slowness of the presentations because they notice occasional cap-cup or cup-cap\nflips which interfere with the task. The timing that we eventually settled on is somewhat of a com-\npromise. The temporal intervals were chosen such that it is unlikely that the second fiducial would\nhave flipped with respect to its appearance during the indication of the first fiducial. We could draw\non our previous experience here. The probability of a flip is less than a percent or so.\nThe patterns were presented on a computer screen. They were again 15 cm in diameter and bin-\nocularly viewed from 50 cm. Room lights were dimmed. The trials were self-paced by the observers.\nAgain, random, uniform, and deformation patterns were generated with equal probability. They were\nrandomly rotated over multiples of 45\u00ba. We used a total of 500 presentations (1,000 for AD, JK, JT,\nand JW). This task is rather more difficult than the simultaneous task. In a few percent of cases, the\nobserver failed to see the first or second indication. Such cases could be discarded, and an additional\ntrial generated.\nIn the case of observer JT, who never reports to be aware of cups, the \"cup\" judgment was\nreplaced with a \"not cap\" judgment. Judging from the results, this at least partly succeeded. At least\nthe random and deformation cases are evidently distinct from the uniform case. Observer JT reports\nto be aware of pictorial relief; he apparently does not merely respond to the gradient directions. In\nthe case of caps, these appear as convincingly three-dimensional; in the case of cups, these are \"less\nconvincing\" and might as well be interpreted as planar gradients.\nWhat is interesting from a phenomenological viewpoint is that the observers apparently used the\nrelief appearance, rather than the (two-dimensional) gradient representation. It happens occasionally\nthat one is aware of a cap-cap event, whereas (in reflective afterthought) one notices that the gradi-\nents were opposite. In such (rare) cases, the microgenetic process possibly assumed different local\nillumination directions for the first and second fiducial subpattern.\nFrom the results, we may compute autocorrelation functions (see Figure 9). These specify pre-\ncisely how seeing cap or cup at the second presentation depends upon cap or cup at the first presenta-\nFigure 8. The sequence of presentations in a trial of the successive task. The trial starts with a blank plus fixation\nmark, enabling the observer to fixate. The observer initiates the following three presentations. First the stimulus\npattern is presented for 1 s. Then, follow two one-half-second presentations in which the fiducial patterns are\nidentified: the first through a red, the second through a blue dot. The fourth presentation is blank again. It ends\nwhen the observer has responded. The response involves a cap-cup decision for the first (red) pattern and one for\nthe second (blue pattern). Thus, possible responses are cap-cap, cap-cup, cup-cap, and cup-cup.\nLight field deformation blindness 473\ntion, as a function of the angular separation of the subpatterns.\n3.2.1Conclusions successive task\nThe results from the successive task are--at the expense of some hard labor--much more detailed\nthan those of the simultaneous task. A cursory glance shows that the deformation case is much like\nthe random and very much unlike the uniform case. Thus, the conclusion that human observers\nappear to be blind to the deformation patterns is immediate, without the need for any significance\ntesting.\nOf course, one has certain predictions. In the case of the uniform pattern, we expect the appear-\nance to be either all caps or all cups. Thus, one expects the autocorrelation function to be equal to\none (perfect correlation) for all angular separations. This expectation is borne out to a surprising\nextent.\nFor the random case, one expects (of course) the correlation to be perfect if the angular separa-\ntion is zero. Anything less would imply cap-cup flips within a half-second interval. This is pretty\nmuch borne out. One also expects correlations for non-zero angular intervals to be essentially (within\nthe random scatter) zero. Perhaps surprisingly, this is not borne out. Except for observer JT, who fails\nto report cups in any case, observers tend to (minor) anti-correlation, except for the smallest angular\nseparations, for which there is a (minor) tendency to positive correlation. We do not understand these\n(minor) trends, which are evidently systematic.\nFor the deformation case, one expects (in case grouping would fail to pertain) antipodes (around\n180 angular separation) to anti-correlate separations of plus or minus ninety degrees not to correlate\nat all. Except for the (special) case of observer JT, this appears to be borne out by the data. However,\nthe difference with the random case (which we fail to fully understand) is only slight, so we can\nhardly conclude otherwise than that the deformation case is very much like the random one.\nFigure 9. At top, the median autocorrelation functions for all observers except JT and the three stimuli (from left\nto right: uniform, random, and deformation). The error bars indicate the interquartile ranges. The correlations\nspecify how the judgment at the second location depends on that at the first location, as a function of the angular\ndistance between the locations.

At bottom,\nthe autocorrelation functions for observer JT (the 95% significance intervals are indicated in red). This observer\nevidently shows a different pattern. JT's results for the uniform patterns are not different from those for the other\nobservers. His results for the random and deformation patterns are different but do not contradict our overall\nconclusions.\nangular separation\nAutocorrelation\nUniform\nangular separation\nRandom\nangular separation\nDeformation\nangular separation\nangular separation\nangular separation\n4 Overall conclusions\nThe overall conclusion from these experiments is clear-cut: human observers do not group deforma-\ntion patterns like they do uniform, convergent or divergent ones. We have not been able to robustly\ndifferentiate the results for the deformation patterns from the results of the random patterns. They are\ncategorically different from the results for the uniform patterns though. Thus, the research question\nposed at the initiation of the experiments has been definitively answered.\nThere remain interesting unanswered questions. For instance, it is unclear how the anti-corre-\nlations for non-zero angular separations in the random case arise. We guess that this has to do with\nlocal grouping processes (for angular separations of less than half the annulus) that mutually com-\npete to settle the global grouping. The \"grouping\" seems to be accompanied by an \"anti-grouping\".\nWe have met similar effects in a previous experiment for the case of rotations. This appears to be a\nworthy target for experiments yielding more detailed data. Such experiments are not likely to be easy\nthough in view of the fact that it took several decades to move from preliminary qualitative observa-\ntions to detailed quantitative data. There is clearly more detail to be probed. For instance, our observ-\ners occasionally spontaneously noticed a dissociation between pictorial relief (cap-cup distinction)\nand visual field (gradient direction) properties. It might be possible to probe this.\nA side issue, which is nevertheless of interest, is the difference between observer JT and the\nothers. All observers are aware of compellingly three-dimensional caps, but whereas all but one\nobserver are also aware of equally compelling cups, observer JT is not. Whereas the \"cups\" are obvi-\nously \"non-caps\" (which is why JT was able to complete the experiment), they are not compelling\nas three-dimensional objects but might as well be described as planar figures. In the past, we have\nencountered similar observers, as well as observers who failed to see any conventional stimulus as\nconvincingly three-dimensional. In two cases, we met with reviewers who declared that they failed\nto \"get the illusion\", meaning that they were not visually aware of caps or cups. Apparently, one may\ndistinguish among various groups of distinct observers. There appears to be no literature on the is-\nsue; it seems a potentially rewarding research topic.\nIn conclusion, the human visual system appears to be idiosyncratic in that it easily groups\nunidirectional, convergent, and divergent illuminance flow patterns but fully ignores rotational and\ndeformation patterns. This is the case even though the first-order patterns all occur in the natural en-\nvironment (Mury et al., 2007, 2009b). This \"selective blindness\" is reminiscent of the inability to be\nvisually aware of the conventional stimulus pattern as anything else but cap or cup (Wagemans et al.,\nthat the saddles which are ignored are actually more abundant in the natural environment than the\ncaps and cups taken together (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2003b). To understand such idiosyncrasies,\none will need to study the affordances of these patterns in further detail than has been attempted so\nfar. Perhaps insights from the arts, rather than from classical physics will prove useful there (Baxan-\n"
