Using self-reported data from the 1992 Health and Retirement Study of 1,150\nAfrican-American women aged 30-70 years, this report first compares chronic disease prevalence and\nseverity, pain, sensory deficits, and mobility difficulty across four categories of body mass index and, second,\ninvestigates whether body mass index affects the association of chronic disease with mobility difficulty. Body\n30-34 (24%), and 35 or over (18%), respectively. There were few differences when comparing the medium\ncategory with either the low or high category. Those in the severe body mass index category, however,\nreported significantly more frequent and severe hypertension, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, arthritis, pain,\nsensory deficits, and mobility difficulty than did those in the medium body mass index category. Obesity did\nnot appear to affect the association between chronic disease and mobility difficulty. The relatively high rates\nof mobility difficulty observed among the severe body mass index group appear to be more likely a result of\nrelatively high chronic disease prevalence and severity than to a disproportionate impact of these on mobility.\nblacks; body mass index; chronic disease; movement; obesity; women\nBecause of its high prevalence, obesity represents\na serious public health concern among African-\nAmerican women, particularly during the middle and\nlate adulthood years (1). It has been shown that two\nthirds of late middle-aged (e.g., 51-61 years)\nAfrican-American women are obese and that over one\nhalf report mobility difficulty (2). Relative to Cauca-\nsian women and African-American men, African-\nAmerican women are over 1.5 times more likely to\nhave a body mass index of 30 or greater and to report\na mobility limitation or difficulty (1-6). Obesity ap-\npears to have important implications for mobility (2, 5,\n7-9), and mobility, in turn, has important implications\nReceived for publication July 9, 1996, and accepted for publica-\n1 Department of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN.\n2 Regenstrief Institute for Health Care, Indianapolis, IN.\nfor the performance of basic and household activities\nof daily living (10).\nThe relation between obesity and mobility is likely\ncomplex but may operate largely through chronic dis-\nease, the most important being arthritis. In fact, several\nstudies have shown that obesity elevates the risk and\nseverity (based on symptomatic and radiographic data)\nof osteoarthritis of the knee (11-14) by increasing the\nmechanical stress that is placed on the knee (15).\nObesity is also known to be associated with a range of\nchronic diseases other than arthritis, including cardio-\nvascular disease (particularly hypertension), diabetes\nmellitus, and some cancers, but epidemiologic studies\nto determine whether obesity exacerbates the lower\nbody impact of these diseases are generally not avail-\nable.\nThe 1992 Health and Retirement Study provides an\nopportunity to investigate whether obesity affects the\nimpact of chronic disease on mobility difficulty among\n1,150 African-American women who range in age\nfrom 30 to 70 years. We have limited our analyses to\nAfrican-American women because of their particularly\nhigh rates of obesity and mobility difficulty. First, we\ncompare distributions on sociodemographic character-\nistics, health behaviors, chronic disease prevalence\nand severity, pain and sensory impairments, and mo-\nbility difficulty across four categories delineated by\nover. Second, we present the results of multiple re-\ngression equations that estimate the association be-\ntween chronic disease and mobility difficulty for each\nof the body mass index categories while controlling\nsociodemographic characteristics and health behav-\niors. Our specific hypothesis is that chronic disease in\ngeneral and arthritis in particular are stronger risk\nfactors (i.e., have greater associations) for mobility\ndifficulty among African-American women with body\nwith body mass indexes of less than 30.\nData\nThe Health and Retirement Study was funded by the\nNational Institute on Aging, conducted by the Institute\nfor Social Research at the University of Michigan, and\ndesigned to provide in-depth data for the investigation\nof analytical and policy issues surrounding retirement.\nThus, the primary age group selected (ages 51-61)\nwas intended to include a majority of persons who had\nnot yet retired but who would likely retire in the\ncoming decade. Approximately 70,000 households ob-\ntained through an area probability sample were\nscreened to identify age-eligible respondents. Census\ntracts containing a high density of African Americans\nwere oversampled by a 2:1 ratio. All households\nwithin the high density census tracts that were identi-\nfied as having an age-eligible respondent were se-\nlected. All spouses were included in the study regard-\nless of age because of the frequency of dual-earner\ncouples and the influence of spouses in the retirement\ndecision process. Thus, in addition to the 965 African-\nAmerican women aged 51-61 years who form a\nrepresentative sample of this age category, the Health\nand Retirement Study includes data on 236 African-\nAmerican women outside this age range. The latter\nwomen do not constitute a representative sample. By\nthe most conservative criteria, the overall response\nsus data provide no indication of sample bias. Because\nof the subjective nature of several of the measures\nused in the equations that follow, we limit our analyses\nto self-respondents. The proxy response rate among\nAfrican-American women was 2.6 percent, leaving\nMeasures\nA body mass index was created by dividing self-\nreported weight in kilograms by self-reported height in\nmeters squared. We partially follow the weight tables\nlineating weight categories. In that report, body mass\n29, and 30 or over. Because of the large percentage of\nrespondents in the 30 or over category, we have split\nhave labeled these categories low, medium, high, and\nvery high body mass index. The Health and Retire-\nment Study contains 19 African-American women\nwith a body mass index of less than 19, and those\nwomen were excluded from the analyses presented\nhere.\nIn the Health and Retirement Study, respondents\nwho considered themselves primarily black or African\nAmerican were coded accordingly. Sociodemographic\nmeasures included age, number of children associated\nwith the.respondent, marital status, mother's and fa-\nther's educational status, respondent's educational sta-\ntus, financial status (including income and net worth),\nworking status, and southern geographic residence.\nObesity has been shown to be associated with moth-\ner's and father's educational attainment, an indicator\nof childhood social and economic status (1, 17) and\nperhaps genetic inheritance (17). Obesity is also asso-\nciated with parity, but we were unable to determine\nexact parity through the Health and Retirement Study\ndata and have created a measure of the number of\nchildren associated with the respondent. This variable\nrepresents all children living with or without the re-\nspondent. An indicator for southern residence is used\nin an attempt to capture important geographic differ-\nences in experience and lifestyle that may exist within\nthe older African-American population (18). Distribu-\ntions on all measures and their coding schemes are\nshown in tables 1 and 2.\nThe previous year's combined income for husband\nand spouse (if present) is obtained through summation\nof the many different measures of income provided in\nthe Health and Retirement Study. Missing data on\nwages and salary occurred on a relatively modest 12\npercent of the sample, and the Institute for Social\nResearch assigned these missing cases predicted val-\nues based on a simple regression model including age,\nrace, and sex. Unfortunately, difficulties with missing\ndata on questions of net worth are a larger problem in\nsurvey research. The use of bracketing techniques in\nChronic Disease and Mobility across Body Mass Index Categories 867\nthe baseline Health and Retirement Study had a sizable\nimpact on item-nonresponse rates (reducing nonre-\nsponse by 75 percent on most items), and the Health\nand Retirement Study compares favorably with other\nlarge social surveys in terms of missing asset data\n(19). Still, 40 percent of Health and Retirement Study\nhouseholds have missing asset values on at least one\nitem, and imputation was necessary. The imputation\nfor net worth followed the approach used for income.\nFor both income and net worth, we have used a di-\nchotomy set at 10,000 dollars, which minimizes the\nimpact of imputation and provides a measure that\napproximates yearly earnings of one full-time, mini-\nmum wage job.\nFor health behaviors, respondents were asked\nwhether they have ever smoked cigarettes (defined as\n100 or more over their life), whether they currently\nsmoke cigarettes, and how many they currently smoke\nin 1 day. Pipe smoking and cigar smoking were not\nincluded. Alcohol consumption was measured with\nfour questions that form the CAGE scale of alcohol\nconsumption (20). A score of \u00a32 on the CAGE scale\nis generally used to indicate alcoholism. Two ques-\ntions regarding physical activity are available in the\nHealth and Retirement Study. One asks about the\nfrequency of light physical activity (e.g., dancing,\nwalking), and the second asks about the frequency of\nheavy physical activity (e.g., running, swimming). In-\ndicator variables were used to represent those who\nreported participating in these activities at least once a\nweek.\nIt is important to note that self-reports of disease are\nsomewhat less reliable than medical records data, and\nthere is some evidence that blacks underreport chronic\ndisease (21). To minimize bias, the Health and Retire-\nment Study asked respondents whether they had ever\nbeen told by a doctor that they have high blood pres-\nsure or hypertension, diabetes or high blood sugar,\ncancer other than skin cancer, or chronic lung disease\n(excluding asthma) such as chronic bronchitis or em-\nphysema. The name of the organ or body site of the\nmost recent cancer was obtained. Respondents were\nalso asked in a single question whether they had ever\nbeen told by a doctor that they had had a heart attack,\ncoronary heart disease, angina, or other heart prob-\nlems. In separate questions, respondents were asked if\nthey had ever been told by a doctor that they had had\na stroke or have congestive heart failure. Finally, re-\nspondents were asked whether they have ever had or\nhave ever been told by a doctor that they have arthritis\nor rheumatism and whether they currently have\nasthma.\nWhile prevalence indicators such as these are com-\nmon, measures of disease severity have been difficult\nto obtain in health surveys and have rarely been inte-\ngrated into analyses (22). To begin to address this\nlimitation, we assigned one point for reports of the\npresence of a condition and additional points for re-\nports of symptoms and medication use associated with\na specific condition. The prevalence, symptom, and\nmedication indicators that make up what we have\nlabeled disease severity scores are detailed in table 2.\nWe have used the disease severity scores previously in\nthe context of multivariable regression models of mo-\nbility difficulty and found them to add considerably to\nmodel fit in comparison with models that substitute\ndisease prevalence for disease severity (6).\nAs noted by Wallace and Lemke (22), the distinc-\ntion between disease severity and impairment is often\nambiguous, particularly in social and health surveys.\nHere, measures of symptoms of impairment capture\nsensory deficits and pain without reference to a par-\nticular disease. Vision impairment has important con-\nsequences for disability and functional limitation,\nwhile the role of hearing impairment appears to be less\nsignificant (23, 24). Respondents were asked if they\nwear glasses or contacts and if their eyesight is excel-\nlent, very good, good, fair, or poor (with glasses).\nRespondents were also asked whether they wear a\nhearing aid, how often (always, often, sometimes,\nalmost never), and whether they would say their hear-\ning is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor (with\naid).\nPain has often been thought to predict disability and\nfunctional limitation as well but has rarely been mea-\nsured. A recent review of experiments investigating\nthe reporting of chronic pain on health surveys, how-\never, concluded that pain recall is quite reliable (25).\nThe Health and Retirement Study asks respondents\nwhether they are often troubled with pain, whether the\npain is mild, moderate, or severe when it is at its worst,\nand whether it is mild, moderate, or severe most of the\ntime.\nOur dependent variable consists of a five-point mo-\nbility scale created from four indicators. Respondents\nwere assigned one point for each activity that they\nindicated they had difficulty doing, did not do, or\ncould not do. The activities were as follows: climb one\nflight of stairs, climb several flights of stairs, walk one\nblock, and walk several blocks. Cronbach's alpha for\nthe mobility scale was 0.77 among the low body mass\namong the high, and 0.76 among the very high.\nAnalyses\nWe first present and compare sociodemographic,\nhealth behavior, chronic disease, and impairment mea-\nsures for the low, medium, high, and very high body\nz\np\no\nCO\nCO\nTABLE 1.

Second, we present the results\nof multivariable regression models intended to assess\nthe association between chronic disease and mobility\nfor each of the four body mass index categories, while\ncontrolling sociodemographic, health behavior, and\nsymptom of impairment indicators. By running sepa-\nrate models for each body mass index category, we are\nable to estimate the impact of body mass index on the\nassociation between chronic disease and mobility dif-\nficulty. Statistically significant differences among the\npartial regression coefficients for the different body\nmass index categories are determined using t tests\n(26). To be conservative, we noted only statistically\nsignificant differences where the confidence intervals\nof the two partial regression coefficients do not over-\nlap. To limit comparisons, we used the medium body\nmass index category in reference to all others.\nRESULTS\nAmong the 1,150 African-American women self-\nrespondents, 20 percent had low, 38 percent had me-\ndium, 24 percent had high, and 18 percent had very\nhigh body mass indexes. As shown in table 1, the\nmean body mass index among the very high category\nwas 40. The very high body mass index women tended\nto have had more children and to have had fewer years\nof education than did those with a body mass index in\nthe medium range. The mothers of the respondents in\nthe high and very high body mass index categories\naveraged 0.7 year of education less and the fathers\naveraged one full year of education less than did the\nmothers of the respondents in the medium category.\nTwenty-eight percent of those in the very high cate-\npercent had fewer than 10,000 dollars in net worth.\nThis was significantly different from the medium cat-\negory, where the percentages were 16 and 36, respec-\ntively. The percent working is similar across all weight\ncategories except the very high category, where it is 15\npercentage points lower. Those in the high category\nare slightly less likely to reside in the South than those\nin the medium category, while those in the low cate-\ngory have higher CAGE scores on average than those\nin the medium category. Finally, those in the high and\nvery high weight categories are considerably less\nlikely to be current smokers than those in the medium\ncategory and are slightly less likely to participate in\nlight physical activities.\nAs shown in table 2, 91 percent of those in the very\nhigh weight category reported at least one chronic\nillness, and the prevalences and severities of hyperten-\nsion, diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis were all\nsubstantially and significantly greater among the very\nhigh category in comparison with the medium cate-\ncategory\nChronic disease and impairment measures among African-American female self-respondents to the 1992 Health and Retirement Study, by body mass index\no\nc\nCO\nChronic diseases*\nHypertension Diabetes\n% with\nany\nself-reported\nillness\n%ever\ntold had\nhypertension,\nNo.\n% taking\nmedication\nfor\nhypertension,\nHypertension\nseverity score,\nMean SDf\n% ever\ntold had\ndiabetes,\nNo.\n% taking\noral\nmedication,\n% with\ndiabetes\nDiabetes\nseverity score,\nMean SD\np values\n-\u00a7\n.\nChronic diseases\no\no\nCancer Respiratory Illness\ng\no|\no.\np values\nML\nMH\nMVH\n%ever\ntold had\ncancer,\nNo.\nLun>\n--\n--\n% of site with high\nmortality, 2 points\ng t\nBreast\n-- --\n-- --\n% received\ntreatment, 1 |\nChemo-\ntherapy\n--\n--\nSurgery\n--\n--\njoint\nRadiation\ntherapy\n--\n--\nCancer severity\n--\nMean SD\n/o ever\ntold had\nor\nasthma,\nNo.\n% taking\nmedication\nfor\n--\n--\n%ot\nreports\nwith\nrespira-\ntory\nsymptoms\n--\n--\nRespiratory severity\nMean SD\nCO\nCO\nl\nChronic diseases\np\no\nCO\nCO\nj\nHeart disease Congestive heart failure\np values\nML\nMH\nMVH\n% ever\nhad heart\ncondition or\nattack,\nNo\n% currently % taking\nhave heart\nangina, medication,\n% ever\nhad\ncardiac\nsurgery,\nHeart disease\nseverity score,\nMean SD\n% ever\ntold had\nNo.\n% taking\nmedication\nlor CHF,\n%of\nsymptoms\ndue to\nCongestive heart\nfailure severity score,\nMean SD\ng\n|\np values\nML\nMH\nMVH\n% ever\ntold you\nhad stroke,\nNo.\nChronic diseases\nCerebrovascular disease Arthritis\n% had\nresidual\nneurologic\nloss,\n% taking\nmedication\nfor\nstroke,\nCerebrovascular disease\nseverity score,\nMean SD\n%ever\ntold had\narthritis,\nNo.\n% currently\nhave Joint\nsymptoms,\n% taking\nmedications\nfor\narthritis,\nArthritis\nseverity score,\nMean SD\nQ.\nO\nf\nCD\nO\nQ.\nQ .\nCD\nX\nO\na.\nCD\nCO\nO\ncn\nTable 2 continues\nm\nO\n: #\nIs\nE\u00b0^\u00b0o\nf\nD i g\n(D * - O\nd o\" d\ncn \u00bb- p <o\n^ c\\i oi oi\nc o K & S\n\u00ab - CM O I T -\nco \u00b7* co m\ni- n in w\n^ ^ r c\nO\nco cn co CD\nco *\n-- o\n<o co o\no p q\no d d\nco o> CM\nr-- co \u00b7 -\nT> T- O\no d d\nto o o\nN in o\no d d\ncn o\nir\nmi\no d d\nN 'a- in\nu) en N\nin cq r-;\no d d\nco co o\nm r~- o\nc\\i o> o\no d d\nrv co co\nco co o\nC\nO Oi O\no d d\n\u00b7<* CO CO\no d d\n\u00a7\nE\nI\ng\nI\nB\n>\n\"o\n:.s\nE\n\"TJ <\nO\nf\n= CD\no\nUs\n(D O P\nB s ^ c\no\nal-\ngory. Hypertension was 1.5 times more prevalent\nwithin trie very high category in comparison with the\nmedium category. Diabetes was two times more prev-\nalent among those in the very high category, and those\nin the high category also had greater diabetes preva-\nlence than those in the medium category. Heart disease\nis 1.9 times more prevalent and arthritis is 1.6 times\nmore prevalent among those in the very high category\nin comparison with those in the medium category.\nInterestingly, despite being one third less likely to\ncurrently smoke than those in the medium category,\nthose in the very high category are nearly 1.5 times\nmore likely to report having been told they have\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma.\nThe disease severity scores did not follow a propor-\ntionate dose-response pattern. In other words, although\ndisease severity increased in the expected direction\nacross the body mass index categories, the increases\nwere not uniform. The arthritis severity score, for\nexample, is 12 percent greater among those in the\nmedium category in comparison with those in the low\ncategory, 20 percent greater in the high compared with\nthe medium category, and 54 percent greater among\nthose in the very high category in comparison with\nthose in the high category. Similarly, the diabetes\nseverity score increases by 33 percent from low to\nmedium, 43 percent from medium to high, and 69\npercent from high to very high. Similar patterns are\napparent for hypertension, heart disease, cancer, and\nmobility difficulty.\nThere is also a considerably greater percentage of\nsevere pain reports, both daily and when at its worst,\namong those in the very high category. In fact, reports\nof severe pain are well over two times more common\namong those in the very high category than among\nthose in any of the other categories. Ratings of fair or\npoor eyesight are also considerably more common\namong those in the very high category. A majority of\npersons in all obesity categories reported some mobil-\nity difficulty, but mobility difficulty is significantly\nmore prevalent among the high and very high catego-\nries than in the medium category. The prevalence of\nmobility difficulty among those with body mass in-\nvery high body mass index categories, respectively.\nBecause the level of difficulty among those with dif-\nficulty is also greater among those in the very high\ncategory (table 2), the overall mobility scores for those\nin the very high category are significantly greater than\nthose for the medium body mass index respondents.\nTable 3 represents the results of the multivariable\nlinear regression of mobility difficulty among each of\nthe four body mass index categories.

With the\nexception of an increase in the coefficient for income\nwith working status excluded, sensitivity analyses in-\ndicated that the exclusion of these variables did not\nalter the estimates of included variables.\nFor the sample as a whole (table 3), income, pain at\nits worst, fair or poor vision, and disease severity\nscores for hypertension, diabetes, respiratory disease,\nand heart disease were significantly associated with\nmobility difficulty. Of these, heart disease, diabetes,\narthritis, and pain account for 90 percent of the vari-\nance explained by the model. Comparing results\nacross all of the models reveals that only arthritis\nseverity and reports of pain at its worst have a statis-\ntically significant association with mobility within\neach of the body mass index categories.\nAge, currently smoking, diabetes severity score,\npain at its worst, and fair or poor vision were the only\npartial regression coefficients for which t tests (not\nshown) indicated statistically significant differences\nbetween the medium weight category and any other\ncategory. Mobility difficulty scores had a strong sig-\nnificant association with age (range, 30-70 years)\namong those in the very high weight category, but age\nhad no association with mobility among those in the\nmedium weight category (or any other category). Cur-\nrently smoking and fair or poor vision had stronger\nassociations among those in the high weight category\nin comparison with those in the medium weight cate-\ngory. Pain at its worst had a lower association among\nthose in the high and low categories than among those\nin the medium category, while diabetes scores had\nlower associations among those in the high and very\nhigh categories. In sum, it does not appear that chronic\ndiseases have a stronger association with mobility\ndifficulty among African-American women with body\nwith those with body mass indexes of less than 30. The\nrelatively high rates of mobility difficulty observed\namong the very high body mass index group appear to\nbe more likely a result of relatively high chronic\ndisease prevalence and severity than due to a dispro-\nportionate impact of these on mobility.\nDISCUSSION\nThere are several limitations to this report that must\nbe kept in mind. First, the data used for this report are\ncross-sectional. While there is plenty of evidence to\nconclude that obesity increases the likelihood of de-\nveloping a chronic disease, the possibility exists that\nchronic disease leads to obesity through lifestyle ad-\naptations, adverse coping mechanisms, or physiologic\nchanges. As more waves of the Health and Retirement\nStudy are completed, these relations can be tested and\nreciprocal associations identified. Second, the Health\nand Retirement Study is representative of the respon-\ndents aged 51-61 years but not of those falling outside\nthis age range. We have included those outside the\nrange of 51-61 years to maximize the sample size. We\nran the models with only those in the 51-61 range and\ndid not find the estimates to be significantly different\nfrom those shown here. Third, we made multiple com-\nparisons in tables 1 and 2, and a few of the differences\ncould have been due to chance. Fourth, the disease\nprevalence measures are based on self-report, and er-\nror in reporting could have led to imprecise classifi-\ncations of disease or body mass index. Fifth, the use of\nimputed data is likely to have artificially lowered the\nvariance of the net worth and income measures. Our\nuse of indictor variables for low net worth and low\nincome should have minimized the impact of imputa-\ntion on the estimates obtained in the multivariate mod-\nels.\nSixth, the indicator for arthritis is not specific re-\ngarding the type or location of arthritis. This lack of\nspecificity may explain why we found no evidence to\nsupport the hypothesis that mobility difficulty is more\nstrongly associated with arthritis among the obese.\nPrevious studies have found that obesity exacerbates\nthe disabling effects of knee arthritis among older\nadults in general. Our inability to show a differential\nimpact (or association) of arthritis by obesity status\nmay be due to our inability to identify the location(s)\nof the arthritis (8, 28). Our use of a disease severity\nscore in place of a simple disease prevalence indicator\nmay have also reduced the likelihood of finding dif-\nferential associations by body mass index, although\nreplacing severity with prevalence (data not shown)\ndid not yield differential associations either.\nFinally, the disease severity scores created with\nthese data represent an interesting approach, but alter-\nnative assignments and scoring algorithms are cer-\ntainly possible. Although we have used these scores in\nother analyses and found them to add considerably to\nmodel fit statistics, the predictive validity of the scores\nhas not been established. With the availability of\nHealth and Retirement Study follow-up data, we will\nbe able to test the ability of the scores to predict\nadverse events and health services use.\nSome authors have speculated that the association\nbetween obesity and health risks may be weak among\nAfrican-American women (1). Our findings do not\nsupport this conclusion. Although the association be-\ntween mobility and chronic disease was not greater\namong those in the very high body mass index cate-\ngory, disease prevalence and severity, pain, and mo-\nbility difficulty were much more frequent. The arthri-\ntis disease severity score, for example, was 85 percent\ngreater, and the mobility difficulty score was 75 per-\ncent greater among those in the very high body mass\nindex category in comparison with those in the me-\ndium body mass index category. Similar patterns were\napparent for most other disease severity scores.\nThere are a couple of findings in these data and this\nreport that merit particular mention for their potential\nto affect future efforts of disability prevention among\nAfrican-American women. First, none of the compar-\nisons between the low (i.e., ideal) and medium body\nmass index categories yielded statistically significant\ndifferences. The medium body mass index category of\n25-29 in this report is often considered moderately\nobese (16), but the lack of significant differences be-\ntween \"normal\" and \"moderately\" obese respondents\non any of the prevalence or severity indicators, includ-\ning mobility difficulty, suggests that the impact of\nmoderate obesity on disability may be minimal among\nAfrican-American women.\nSecond, those with very high body mass indexes of\n35 or over had disproportionately high rates of chronic\ndisease and nearly universal mobility difficulty.\nWeight loss and treatment may thus be most valuable\nas a tool for disability management or prevention\nwhen targeting individuals with very high body mass\nindexes. Weight loss has proven to be very difficult\nand expensive, however (29, 30), and identifying in-\ndividuals at risk for developing severe obesity and\nChronic Disease and Mobility across Body Mass Index Categories 875\nattempting to prevent its development may prove to be\nthe more effective strategy for disability prevention\nand management. Future studies should help to iden-\ntify appropriate targets of obesity and disability pre-\nvention, which represent critical and growing public\n"
