    "abstract": "Abstract\nExperience has shown that the application of ethical guidelines developed for research in\ndeveloped countries to research in developing countries can be, and often is, impractical\nand raises a number of contentious issues. Various attempts have been made to provide\nguidelines more appropriate to the developing world context; however, to date these efforts\nhave been dominated by the fields of bioscience, medical research and nutrition. There is\nvery little advice available for those seeking to undertake collaborative social science or\nnatural science research in developing countries and what is there tends to be held within\ndisparate sources. Charting the development of a set of ethics documentation for future use\nby the Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme research community,\nthis paper outlines past and present attitudes towards ethics procedures amongst this\ncommunity and suggests ways in which ethics procedures might be made more relevant and\nuser-friendly to researchers working in this area.\n",

Ethical review by\nResearch Ethics Committee (REC) is now a standard part of the grant application/\naward process for social science and natural science research in UK universities\n(Jaspers et al., 2013) \u00ad particularly since the publication of the Economic and\nSocial Research Council (ESRC) Framework for Research Ethics and the Natural\nmost institutions and organizations who support pure and/or applied research will\nnow have a college, if not school, level REC (Ekberg, 2012).\nThere are a number of reasons why it is desirable for researchers to adhere to\nethical norms. As Resnik (2011) synthesizes, it helps to promote the aims of\nresearch (knowledge, truth, avoidance of error) and the values that are essential to\ncollaborative work (trust, accountability, mutual respect, fairness), it ensures pub-\nlic accountability (particularly important when researchers are funded by public\nmoney), it can help build public support for research (trust in quality and integ-\nrity), and assist in promoting other important moral and social values (social\nresponsibility, human rights, etc.). Where the research involves international col-\nlaboration between researchers from developed and developing countries it can\nremind those working in privileged positions and in wealthier countries of the\nneed to reflect not only on their own framework of thinking, but also on the impli-\ncations of the very different mind-sets and environments in which their research\nprojects will be carried out (Benatar, 2002; Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2002).\nIt can also draw attention to the risk of exploitation that might result from inequali-\nties (e.g. financial, access to resources) between the project collaborators (European\nUnion, 2010). There is also a strong case for REC regulation. Responsible for\nreviewing research proposals before data collection commences to evaluate the\nrisks faced by the researcher and researched, RECs play a key role in \"the wider\nquality assurance and quality enhancement processes that operate within all insti-\ntutions that conduct research\" and, in turn, help to protect the integrity and reputa-\nWhilst researchers largely accept the rationale for ethical oversight (Klitzman,\n2011; Nind et al., 2012) there is, however, rising concern regarding the perceived\nand the applicability of the prevailing biomedically-derived model of research eth-\nresearch involves qualitative or ethnographic methods (Burr and Reynolds, 2010;\n`fault lines' are especially apparent in international collaborative research involv-\ning developed and developing countries (London, 2002). Although there are some\ntransferable elements (e.g. security considerations) it is frequently impractical to\napply ethical frameworks created for research in developed countries to develop-\n2011) and there is a real danger that researchers end up reproducing \"the colonial\nestablished authority of Western epistemologies\" (Chilisa, 2005: 675) whilst\nFor example, the conventional principle of informed consent assumes that\n\"research participants are individuated subjects who are more-or-less autonomous\nof social ties and obligations, literate, adult, and accustomed to relating to others\nin the context of formal contractual agreements\" (Butz, 2008: 242; Hoeyer et al.,\nVries's (2008: 108) opinion, even when `tweaked' to relocate autonomy in the\nfamily, clan, or with an elder, the concept of the researched as an autonomous\nbeing \"is an assault on the tradition and values of non-Western societies who\nbelieve in the matrix of relationships in dynamic equilibrium of the cosmos\". What\nis more, any efforts to make bioethics more `culturally appropriate' have to date\namounted to little more than `adapting' western bioethics to `varied cultural set-\ntings' (Chattopadhyay and De Vries, 2008).\nThe identification of procedures which both meet the ethical demands of the\nresearch sponsor(s) and are appropriate to the context within which the research\nis to be carried out is an all too familiar problem for those involved in interna-\ntional collaborative research between developed and developing countries\namplified if (and as is usually the case) the presiding REC is unfamiliar with the\nsocial, political and cultural circumstances of the host country (Mollet, 2011;\nSmith, 2012) or if it lacks the resources to undertake independent assessment of\nthe risks associated with the research under review (European Union, 2010).\nAlthough this is an area which has received significant attention in recent years\nMcIntosh et al., 2008), there is still very little advice available for those seeking\nto undertake collaborative social or natural science research in developing coun-\ntries. As Molony and Hammett (2007) attest, searching academic databases for\nguidance on the ethics of employing local research assistants, and advice on the\nadditional difficulties frequently experienced when researching in the develop-\ning world, is a frustrating experience. The natural scientist searching for guid-\nance on sampling rare or endangered taxa/species and then transporting these\nsamples out of the host country would find a similar dearth of material. Guidance\nfrom sponsor organizations is also scant and researchers wishing to undertake\nresearch in these areas are forced to obtain advice from a number of disparate\nsources (e.g. professional Codes of Conduct in related disciplines, national and\ninternational legislation, international treaties, etc.). To compound this, although\ncertainly growing in numbers (Klitzman, 2012), properly functioning RECs sim-\nply do not exist in many developing countries and where they do they tend to be\nineffective, under-resourced and unevenly distributed (Nuffield Council on\nIn 2012, recognizing these problems, the Ecosystem Services for Poverty\nAlleviation (ESPA)1 Directorate (see ESPA, 2014) commissioned the author to\nproduce an ethics form and accompanying guidance notes for future use by the\nESPA research community. The ethics documents had to be accessible, relevant to\nboth natural and social scientists, and cover all pertinent issues including health\nand safety. To date, the named Principal Investigators (PIs) on the grants awarded\nby the ESPA research programme have, with only a few exceptions, been based in\nUK institutions (although this does not necessarily mean that the UK is their coun-\ntry of origin). The work funded by ESPA has, however, involved collaborations\nbetween academic colleagues in a diverse range of disciplines, non-governmental\norganizations (NGOs), government institutions, and other stakeholders in coun-\ntries across Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America.\nThe aim was not to provide an iron-clad formula for `ethical' research; rather, it\nwas hoped that the new ethics procedure would foster discussion, offer a frame-\nwork for making decisions for both social and natural science researchers, encour-\nage PIs and their Co-Investigators (Co-Is) to design culturally sensitive and\nappropriate studies, make intelligent choices before, during and after their time in\nthe field and, as a result of undertaking ethically aware research, develop relevant\ncapacities in the host countries (Sultana, 2007). As such, ESPA understood that\nresearch ethics involves far more than just anonymity or confidentiality, issues\nthat can sometimes consume the `protectionist discourses' of RECs (Nind et al.,\n2012); rather, they wanted their ethics guidance to be \"embedded in the totality of\nThis paper focuses on the findings of the research which later went on to\ninform the development of this ethics guidance. It begins with a brief outline of\nthe research strategy and the work done to engage members of the ESPA research\ncommunity in the design process. I then outline the extent to which the members\nof this community had (or had not) engaged with ethics procedures in the past\n(be this in their own institution, a collaborating institution, overseen by the fund-\ning body, relevant professional panel, or in-country department/panel) and their\nattitudes towards ethics review procedures focusing, in particular, on their\nresponses to questions regarding the communication of ethical protocols, host-\ncountry review, monitoring and evaluation, IPR and authorship, and collabora-\ntive relationships. In so doing, the paper highlights points of consensus but also\nareas of contention which must be taken into consideration in the design of eth-\nics documentation.\nThe design process\nThe design process incorporated four key phases. Phase One comprised a desk-\nbased literature and Code of Practice review to highlight pertinent issues and col-\nlate examples of best practice from research in a range of disciplines relevant to\nthe work funded by ESPA (e.g. African studies, agriculture, anthropology, biology,\nbusiness, civil engineering, conservation, development studies, economics, educa-\ntion, energy studies, environmental science, forestry, health studies, geography,\nlife sciences, meteorology, psychology, social policy, urban studies, zoology). The\nguid*, code, practice, conduct, protocol, committee, collab*, consent, confidenti-\nality, intellectual property rights (IPR), international, data, sampl*, indigenous,\nspecimen, environment, field site, non-governmental organization (NGO), field/\nresearch assistant, permit, treaty, trans*, dissemination, benefit, capacity, health,\nsafety, travel. The databases searched included Academic Search Elite, Article\nFirst, ASSIA, Google Scholar, IngentaConnect, Web of Knowledge, and Scopus.\nA snowballing technique was then implemented using the reference lists of the\npapers identified during the search; recommendations made by the questionnaire\nrespondents and interviewees were also followed up. Draft documents were then\ncreated (using the University of Edinburgh School of GeoSciences ethics proce-\ndure as a template as requested by NERC) and published on the ESPA website for\ncomment (these included an ethics form, Self-Assessment Guidance Notes, and\nFull Assessment Guidance Notes for those undertaking research on vulnerable\nhuman subjects or sensitive topics, using invasive procedures, and certain types of\nbiophysical research, e.g. sampling rare/endangered or harmful taxa/species).\nPhase Two involved the distribution of a Project Information Sheet and ques-\ntionnaire to all past and present ESPA grant holders and, to broaden out the\nresponse, all recipients of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) \u00ad\nDepartment for International Development (DFID) Joint Scheme for Research on\nInternational Development (Poverty Alleviation) Phase 1 and Phase 2 awards (for\nDenscombe, 2009) (n=146). For data protection reasons ESPA requested that the\nquestionnaire be emailed to the ESPA grant recipients via the ESPAAdministrator;\nI emailed the questionnaire directly to the ESRC-DFID grant recipients. Similarly,\nESPA were also unable to provide contact details for the Co-Investigators (Co-Is)\non their projects and the ESRC-DIFD award website only stated the PI's institu-\ntional affiliation. As a result it was agreed that all the PIs would be asked to for-\nward a copy of the questionnaire to their respective Co-Is; the responses show that\nsome did comply with this request, but it is impossible to determine how many\nCo-Is actually received the survey. All the questionnaire recipients were requested\nto return their completed survey to me personally and were assured that ESPA\nwould not see the raw data. Split into two sections, the anonymized questionnaire\nincluded a mix of Likert Scale, straight yes/no and open-ended questions; Part 1\ncanvassed the recipients' views on the need for, and value of, research ethics and\nasked questions relating to the `doing' of collaborative research with particular\nreference to their ESPA or ESRC-DIFD award, and Part 2 solicited their feedback\non the draft documents. The quantitative survey data was analysed using Microsoft\nExcel 2010; a database was created and the data was coded and analysed to obtain\nresponse ratios. The qualitative survey data was analysed and coded thematically.\nIt is important to note that not all the respondents answered all the questions that\nwere relevant to their project.\nIn Phase Three, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with self-\nselecting questionnaire respondents in order to gain a deeper insight into their\nviews on research ethics and current procedures, to follow up specific responses,\nand to discuss how the draft form and guidance notes might be modified to increase\ntheir relevancy and make them more user-friendly. At the participants' request all\nbut two of the interviews were conducted via Skype, the exceptions being con-\nducted in person at the individual's place of work. All the interviewees gave their\npermission for the interviews to be audio-recorded and the anonymized interview\nfiles were transcribed in full by an independent transcription service. Each inter-\nviewee was assigned a pseudonym (e.g. Interviewee 2) and informed that every\neffort would be made to delete project identifiers (e.g. country, region, specific\nsubject matter, project partners); however, participants were also made aware that,\ndue to the unique nature of some projects, they might be identifiable to those who\nwere intimately connected to, or knowledgeable about, their work. Each individ-\nual was given the opportunity to view their transcript and to make amendments.\nAll the interviewees provided written or verbal consent; two requested to see the\nreport before its submission to ESPA. The interview material was analysed and\ncoded thematically.\nThe final stage of the project, Phase 4, involved the production of a revised set\nof ethics documentation incorporating feedback from Phases Two and Three.\nAttitudes towards ethical review\nOnly 23 completed questionnaires were returned by the deadline despite email\nreminders (Table 1); a further two questionnaires were returned after the quantita-\ntive analysis had been completed. The quantitative data from these responses has\nnot been included here, but the qualitative material has been used where applicable.\nEight of the emails sent to the ESRC-DFID PIs were returned as `undeliverable',\nfive elicited an `out of office' response, and one ESPA PI noted that their project\nhad not yet started. Nine interviews were conducted, including one PI who did not\ncomplete the questionnaire but agreed to be interviewed, and one with an expert in\nthe field of development research ethics recommended by an interviewee.\nTwelve respondents confirmed that they had been involved in a research project\nin a developing country in the last eight years (the time elapsed since the ESRC\nand NERC launched their respective research ethics protocols) which had not been\nethically reviewed by any REC or professional body (Table 2a). The reasons for\nthis were diverse, with interviewees citing the lack of a perceived need due to the\nnature of their research (e.g. data processing, no human subjects), lack of demand\nfrom the funding body, and the absence of an institutional REC (a particular prob-\nlem for those based in developing countries, although not exclusively). Several\ninterviewees who self-identified as natural science researchers and/or who used\ndata modelling or secondary data said they associated research ethics primarily\nwith work involving human subjects or animals. As Interviewee 4 commented:\nmost of our projects are environmental projects. So we're trying to improve [environmental]\nquality or [resource] availability, you know, the general eco-system. [...] we're not using\nhumans as test subjects, we're not using animals. So it's always been something that we're used\nto preparing for any proposal, but it's always just kind of like the last paragraph you prepare\nbecause usually there's no major ethics considerations, and that maybe because I'm a scientist\nand I may not be understanding what ethics are. But as far as I'm concerned it's, you know,\nthere's usually not very many ... we're not doing medical science, so there's no ethics. There's\na lower ethics [...] let's say.\nWhen these interviewees considered research ethics it was a reactive rather than\nproactive process, often at the specific request of the funding body or the home\ninstitution and done at the last minute with little in-depth consideration of the\nTable 1. Respondent demographics (n=23).\nCharacteristics ESPA ESRC-DIFD\nRole of respondent \nDuration of grant (months) \nCountry of residence \nrelevant issues or `dilemmas'. These interviewees also expressed ambivalence\ntowards the procedural aspects of ethics review, which they saw as an inconven-\nience in the life-course of a research project, and several noted that they `dreaded'\nthe bureaucracy of securing ethics approval (Pickersgill, 2012). In order to `pass'\nthey went through the motions of ticking what they presumed to be the `right\nboxes' or `saying the right thing' rather than thinking through the relevant ethical\nprinciples and making substantive ethical judgements about their work and prac-\nAll the questionnaire respondents said they felt that it was important to consider\nresearch ethics (however, it is necessary to conclude, given the quote above, that\nthis may be brief in some cases) and the majority were confident that they knew\nwhere to find information relating to, and were knowledgeable about, ethics in their\nsubject area (Table 2b). Seven said they had, in the past, been involved in research\nTable 2a.

The\nmost common causes for concern being the research participants' exposure to risk\n(e.g. through the absence of adequate compensation mechanisms, ineffective com-\nmunication, inadequate risk/benefit assessment, ineffective project management,\nthe absence of formal contractual agreements for local field assistants, lack of or\nineffective project monitoring and evaluation, and lack of informed consent), and\nthe inequitable distribution of IPR (including instances of academic imperialism,\nineffective dissemination, and failure to ensure fair distribution of potential bene-\nfits). Describing their involvement in a previous project, Interviewee 1 stated:\n[The specialist researchers] said they would provide [additional assistance for the control\ngroup]. Now because this is in a remote place people don't have the same understanding[s] [...]\n[and] although the [specialist had] explained it to their satisfaction it made absolutely no sense\n[to the research participants] and it was followed ... it was not properly followed up because the\n[specialists] left [a] local community [...] worker to do the following up and he was based at a\nconsiderable distance and wasn't given any particular incentive to carry this out and as a result\none [group experienced huge losses] and was very puzzled and distressed and couldn't\nunderstand what had gone wrong.\nThis interviewee felt that the project leaders in this situation had `violated' both\nthe principle of prior informed consent and the ethics of practice but recalled\nfeeling powerless to do anything about it given there was no recourse provided\nby a pre-approved ethics document. It is worth noting, however, that only five\nrespondents said they had chosen not to participate in a project because a desir-\nable standard could not be met and there was no evidence to show that any col-\nlaborative agreements had broken down because of disagreements relating to\nSixteen questionnaire respondents confirmed that their ESPA or ESRC-DFID\nproject(s) had been ethically reviewed (either by the PI's institutional REC and/or\nprofessional body in the PI's country of residence) (Table 3), although one inter-\nviewee appeared to have misunderstood the function of the JES system, assuming\nthat ethical review was part of the post-submission vetting process:\nwe write a proposal with, on what is the Joint [Electronic] Submission system [...] so we fill\neverything in then, [...] it goes to the university administration and then [...] I know it goes\nthrough various checks and whatever and so it might be that one of the checks is not for review\ncommittee but to be honest, well, yeah, it's probably the nature of scientists trying to not ... or\nyeah, as long as it goes through and it gets to the funding agents then we're happy and basically\nthe rest did not really occur to me ever that I would have to actively look for an ethical committee,\nI always thought that and other requirements or whatever would be taken [care] of by the [...]\ngrants managing entity in [my university] or the other universities. (Interviewee 3)\nThe interviewees who had not had their project reviewed, or were unsure if it had\nbeen reviewed, confessed that they were unsure of their institutional ethics\nprocedure and had either neglected to think about ethics at the time of the application\nor had assumed/hoped that someone else (either another member of the research\nteam or someone in their institution) would take care of, or assume responsibility\nfor, this on their behalf. Although these researchers were in the minority (indicating,\nperhaps, that consideration of ethics is becoming the norm rather than the excep-\ntion), the question of who should take responsibility for ensuring that projects have\nbeen ethically reviewed looms large here. Certainly more could be done to empower\nresearchers to take responsibility for the ethical conduct of their research and the\ncollaborative relationships they enter into. However, it would seem that current grant\napplication and funding mechanisms play a key role in enabling abstention and fail-\nure to engage meaningfully with research ethics.\nOnly five questionnaire respondents confirmed that their project had been\nreviewed by a REC in the host country (Table 3). One felt very strongly that all\nresearch handling personal data should be subject to ethical review first in the host\ncountry (if this was not the PI's country of residence) before being reviewed by the\nPI's institutional REC (or appropriate professional body), a response which ques-\ntioned directly the validity of undertaking ethical review in a developed country if\nthe research is being undertaken in an entirely different socio-cultural, economic,\nand environmental context (Honan et al., 2013). There is some support for a one-\ntrack approach given the increased level of detail and amount of documentation\nnow required by many RECs, the increasing number and complexity of the rules\nTable 3. Ethical review and training.\nYes No Do not know\nWas the project proposal subject to ethical review\nbefore the research commenced?\nWho reviewed the proposal? 13 \u00ad \nResearch Ethics Committee internal to the PI's\ninstitution\n\nResearch Ethics Committee external to the PI's\nInstitution in the PI's country of residence\nResearch Ethics Committee in the host country 5 \nWere/will relevant Codes of Conduct and/or ethical\nguidelines (be) communicated to all members of\nthe project team (including translators and/or local\nfield assistants)?\nWere/are there any members of the project team\n(including translators and/or local field assistants)\nwho had/have not previously received appropriate\nresearch ethics training?\nDid/will the project provide, or allocate funds to\ncover, training?\nto which researchers are expected to adhere, and the ever growing raft of univer-\nsity and government regulations that are being put in place to regulate research\nresearch collaborations between developed and developing countries should be\nethically reviewed in both the host and the PI's country of residence as standard\npractice (Hyder et al., 2004), thus enabling the specificities of each context to be\ntaken into account (Ravinetto et al., 2011). One has to assume that the paucity of\ndeveloping country RECs had a significant impact on the number of projects\nreviewed within the host countries, but there are a number of other possible rea-\nsons why researchers from developed countries may fail to apply for ethical\napproval in a developing country regardless of REC availability, including: igno-\nrance, perceptions of cost, an assumption that certain research is exempt (as dem-\nonstrated above), arrogance or paternalism (Van Teijlingen and Simkhada, 2012).\nAs demonstrated by the quotes from Interviewees 3 and 4 above, at least some of\nthe ESPA/ESRC-DFID award holders fall into one or more of these categories.\nThe questionnaire respondent with strong views on host country review further\nadvocated that if the local partners had no REC, they should be supported to estab-\nlish one. When the interviewees were asked to respond to this suggestion there was\nsome debate as to where responsibility for this might lie, but they all felt that it was\nunfeasible to include this within the remit of a single project. The key prohibiting\nfactors were the relatively short duration of the projects, funding limitations, and\nthe amount of institutional support required by RECs to make them credible (e.g.\nindependent ethical review boards \u00ad especially those which charged a fee \u00ad were\nseen as being venal). As Interviewee 1 commented:\nI really don't think it's feasible because, you know, basically the developing countries that I've\nworked in, any sort of regulation is minimal, is easily corrupted, is easily bent and I think that\nwhile it would be admirable to put resources to that, we've already talked about the difficulty of\ncarving up the resources and working in these places and I just, to be honest I just don't see that,\nbut I do think that, you know, we try and work by example and we have growing numbers of\ncolleagues who've maybe been through the UK system or similar systems with ethics training\nand who take that very seriously and who [...] apply those practices in their own works so I\nthink that being realistic about it that's about as good as you can get and being quite clear that\nyou don't get involved in projects where there's going to be contravention. That may be slightly\ntoo pragmatic and not sufficiently idealistic a response but I can't begin to envisage [...] to set\nup an ethics committee. I can envisage having those discussions with people at every opportunity\nand raising it as an issue and expecting the best standards from people and encouraging the best\nstandards.\nIn general, although host-country REC review was a valid and highly desirable\nlong-term goal, the interviewees felt that for the time being it would be sufficient\nfor ESPA to insist that all projects go through some form of approved institutional\nethical review (regardless of where this took place) on the understanding that the\nethics protocols for each project had been developed through cross-country dia-\nlogue (Tikly and Bond, 2013) and that the project partners would discuss the ethics\nof their research at every opportunity. In the meantime, it should be the funding\nbodies (ESPA included) and the PI institutions who took responsibility for helping\nto establish robust host country RECs.\nEighteen questionnaire respondents confirmed that their project involved work-\ning with local NGOs and/or experts not named on the grant application, while 17\nsaid that their project involved working with translators and/or local field assis-\ntants (Table 4). When asked if relevant Codes of Conduct and/or ethical guidelines\nhad been, or would be, communicated to all members of the project team (includ-\ning local NGOs and/or experts, translators and/or local field assistants), only three\nsaid no. The interview data suggested, however, that the channels of communica-\ntion were stronger in some projects than others and ranged from ad hoc discussion\nof ethical issues as they arose through to providing specific research training for\ntranslators and/or local field assistants:\nit's, exactly, not a conscious decision but more, yeah, but we'd never really thought about it [...]\nwe know each other pretty well as a team and, yeah, solve problems when they come [up].\n(Interviewee 3)\nWe have a kind of system of a three or four day pre-testing. So that starts with, you know,\ncareful explanations of the questionnaire or if it's qualitative, you know, the focus group, and\nthen they do role plays amongst themselves, and that's actually very effective for screening out,\nyou know, people seem to learn much more if they get a chance. [...] After that couple of days\nof kind of workshop-based training, then they go to the community and try out again and then\ncome back and review and sort of ... and it gives us a chance to review the questions as well\n(Interviewee 5)\nOne interviewee who had answered `yes'to this question clarified that all collabo-\nrating partners involved in undertaking the fieldwork had been sent the ethics\napplication and the comments of the REC, but it was left up to them which ele-\nments of this they passed on to their field assistants and that they would not know\nuntil the final field study report what training had been provided and to whom.\nThis devolvement of responsibility is particularly interesting given that research\ndata collection in the type of project funded by ESPA frequently takes place in\nareas which are physically and economically distanced from the PI's institution\n(Kingori, 2013). As a result, a great deal pivots on data collectors' practices and\nviews (Kingori, 2013), and as Interviewee 1 demonstrated above, many play a\ncrucial and often under-recognized and under-supported role in `doing ethics' in\nthe field, with important implications for the success and quality of the research\nitself. If the collaborating partners fail to take them seriously as collaborators and\npartners in research endeavours (Molyneux and Geissler, 2008) and to adequately\nsupport their decision-making, it could have very serious consequences for the\nTable 4.

For example, compliance with research ethics protocols may be\nfar more difficult to achieve in poor countries where basic infrastructure is lacking\n(Heimer, 2013), and local fieldworkers face significant challenges in mediating\nbetween the very different priorities and concerns of research institutions and\nlow-income communities in which they may themselves live (Molyneux and\nto light.\nAttitudes towards ethics documentation and guidance\nChilisa (2005: 676) highlights that collaborative research between developed and\ndeveloping countries `invariably'begins with a contract that positions the research-\ners within a hierarchical structure in a \"framework which goes back to colonial\ntimes, when the colonized were regarded as empty vessels to be filled\". A decade\non, the ESPA and ESRC-DFID funding schemes appear to be well aware of the\nfundamental importance of \"strong collaborative partnerships with local and\nestablished individuals, institutions and structures\" (Molyneux and Geissler, 2008:\n690). On the whole, the questionnaire respondents registered a high degree of col-\nlaboration amongst the project partners at all stages of the research design and\nimplementation across the projects surveyed (Table 4). Of the 18 respondents who\nanswered the question, however, less than half said that the relationship between\nthe project partners on their grant had been, or was, subject to monitoring and\nevaluation (Table 4). These monitoring and evaluation strategies tended to be\nbased on established institutional codes of conduct or working agreements (e.g.\nconsultancy contracts) or had been developed organically to suit the needs of the\nresearch programme and the individual partners. As Interviewee 2 explained:\nwe decided to design a fairly very simple [...] [two-strand] strategy, that [...] helps to track\nimplementation and execution of the project, [...] as we designed it, [...] one of them is to\nmonitor the quality of work we do, another one is to monitor collaboration [and this] looks at\nthe honour and the respect that is given to intellectual property and the contribution of business.\nThe interviewees stressed, however, that this type of agreement requires commit-\nment and sustained input from all parties to be successful and of mutual benefit.\nSeveral of those whose projects did not have a formal monitoring and evaluation\nstrategy challenged this `unnecessary bureaucratization' (Stanley and Wise, 2010,\nin Monaghan et al., 2013), arguing that it was often impractical or unfeasible to\nexpect individuals to work to strict deadlines (which they associated with such\nprocedures), that it would add undue pressure to an already pressurized working\nsituation, that it would add another level of `complication'to the project, that there\nwas not enough time to do this given the short duration of many of the projects (the\naverage was 28 months) and that it would be an unnecessary burden given the\nseemingly endless amount of reporting that researchers are now expected to do\nduring the life-course of a research project. As Interviewee 4 noted:\nThere is no formal monitoring process [in our project] where we evaluate the participation of\neach partner. It's an informal process where, you know, if you participate ... the more you\ncontribute, the more you appear in scientific publications, [...] what you put in is what you get\nout, more or less. But, you know, it isn't ... it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to come up with\na formal monitoring programme of partner activities, but it's ... it would complicate things. It's\na two year project so there's very little, you know, not a lot of time to do the actual work and\nthere's already so many forms [...] that we don't want to complicate things any further.\nSeveral interviewees questioned why the success of a project could not be judged\nsimply on its deliverables, for without good working relationships no outputs\nwould ever be produced \u00ad an opinion which suggests a slightly na\u00efve approach to\nthe power imbalances which can occur in this type of research.\nFormal IPR agreements covering data and results, publications, and authorship\nwere also relatively scarce and only seven questionnaire respondents confirmed\nthat their project had this type of accord in place and that all the project partners\nnamed on the grant application had been required to sign up (literally and meta-\nphorically) to it prior to the commencement of the research (Table 4). These tended\nto be based on the rules of the Vancouver Protocol, sometimes with additional\nclauses covering the inclusion of collaborators from the host country in the publi-\ncation of the research findings. Those interviewees without a formal agreement\ncited, by way of explanation, the lack of a perceived demand from the funders,\nlack of time, a desire to avoid additional bureaucracy, a lack of interest among\nnon-academic partners in peer-reviewed publications, the presence of already\nwell-established collaborative relationships and/or non-project-specific blanket\nethics clearance agreements. Interviewee 3 noted:\n[I'm] not very keen [on IPR agreements] because it's a lot of bureaucracy. [...] So if not really\nnecessarily, I try to avoid as much as I can, because [it's] bureaucracy for me, for them, and in\ngeneral so far it has worked very well. Also because they have, the other partners they're\ntypically, at least those that I work with have less interest in really peer-review publications, it's\nof course nice and it's great for the CV, but it's not going to change their life, particularly the\nNGOs. On the other hand, they are much more concerned with outreach publications and so I\n... and then of course I do collaborate with them on writing outreach publications and I probably\nhave more than a typical scientist, because I believe that it's important just for the type of stuff\nwe're doing and because it's a great way to get our research into policy of course, but we have,\nsomehow we are flexible about that, yeah, and I admit being guilty of having put strategic\nco-authors on papers sometimes just, just, yeah, well, but try to find a balance between those,\nbut yeah, I've never really felt the need.\nIt is not uncommon for academics to prefer peer-reviewed papers (a desire driven\nin part by the need to secure yet more funding, establish professional reputations,\nearn promotion, etc.) and for non-academic partners to place more weight on pro-\nject reports which might assist them in obtaining further funding and/or impacting\nupon policy (Jeffery, 2014). However, it was startling how freely this interviewee\nadmitted to `authorship disintegrity'(Abu-Zaid et al., 2014) and one would assume\nthat if it is this easy to add authors then it must be just as easy to leave other con-\ntributors off.\nThat said, it would be wrong to assume that agreements regarding IPR were\ncompletely absent in those projects with no formal accord. For some interviewees\nat the start of their funding IPR agreements were not yet in place but were on the\nagenda and had featured in early discussions. Others spoke of tacit agreements with\ntheir collaborating partners regarding who was entitled to have their name attrib-\nuted to which publications. In general, these informal arrangements were said to\nwork well, but what was less clear was how they were policed, how decisions were\nmade regarding author order, how and to whom grievances might be aired, or\nwhether some individuals (particularly those who were not named on the funding\napplication given that 18 questionnaire respondents said that their project included\nthis type of person) might find this type of working arrangement more pressured or\nstressful than if a formal agreement had been in place from the outset. Undoubtedly\nthere can be problems with authorship agreements: staff may change, differing dis-\nciplinary or cultural expectations can make for awkward negotiations (Jeffery,\n2014; Teixeira da Silva, 2011), and the research may change as it progresses, neces-\nsitating re-evaluation of the agreement (Friedman Ross et al., 2010). However, a\n`pre-contract' with an agreed ethical approach to authorship and contribution at the\nstart of the project (Hayter et al., 2013) means that there will always be a point of\nreference which can provide guidelines and clarification (Henry, 2013).\nOnly 16 questionnaire respondents answered when asked if there had been, or\nwere, any tensions in the relationship(s) between the collaborating partners on\ntheir project (Table 4). The seven who said yes identified budget allocation (e.g.\ninformal approach to accounting on the part of one partner, the practical allocation\nof funds), commitment to deadlines (e.g. some partners' unwillingness to prior-\nitize the project above other projects they were involved in, partners failing to\nmake the inputs they promised at the proposal stage), and differing work practices\n(e.g. different approaches to field research in different disciplines, division of\nlabour, timing of inputs) as the main sources of tension. The interview quotes\nbelow highlight two different scenarios:\nwe were working with [...] an NGO and they had their own rules and regulations [...], what we\nwere doing was providing them with the money to allow them to employ the researchers, the\nassociates on our project but they saw them as part of their team, so they, [...] were actually\nexpected to go on team building weeks and [do specific work] within the organization, which\nhas sometimes cut across what we wanted them to do. [...] because they were then members of\nthe [NGO] team, they had to follow the rules about expenses and travelling allowances and [...]\nwe were prepared to say, I mean, because these funds are trivial in our terms, you know, [...] if\nyou can't come by train, for God's sake, buy an air ticket and, and go you know, it's, it's within\nthe budget, but then the rules [of that] organization said, that if these people are allowed to do\nthat, then we have to do it for everybody else, and we can't have that. (Interviewee 7)\n... we thought that it would be appropriate to have [a] partner organization [in CountryA] which\nspecializes in [X skill] and broadly speaking that works [...] they were actually recommended\nto me by the other partners who have worked with them in the past. [...] but because of the way\nthat the project was structured [...] we ended up with a situation where the three research\ninstitutes got the lion's share of the overheads. That was very upsetting to the [skilled] group\nand partly because of the timeline and partly because of the fact that sort of doing this over\nSkype and email that we just didn't really get to a point where they were completely happy with\n... I found as many ways as I could to make it work for them but essentially I think that they felt\nthat they were marginalized by that process. You could say they were. (Interviewee 1)\nThis interviewee acknowledged that a number of these issues could have been\ndealt with more effectively by the management of expectations, but they pointed\nout that the lack of regular face-to-face contact (which is a common feature of\nresearch of this type due to the geographical distribution of the project partners)\ncan hinder the successful resolution of problems. This shows that while formal\nethics guidelines play an important role in regulating research practice, implicit\nday-to-day social relations and engagements between people are fundamental to\nthe research process (Molyneux and Geissler, 2008). A situated research ethics as\nopposed to a universal ethics requires a contextualized understanding of the\nresearch process itself, which partly revolves around the politics of partnership\nand demonstrates the need to engage with the complexities of power relations not\nonly between the researcher and researched (Tikly and Bond, 2013) but also\nbetween the collaborating partners. The establishment of trust through relation-\nship-building seems to be particularly important here, taking time to listen to each\nother's concerns, interests and needs and incorporating them into the research\nOne respondent felt very strongly that ESPA were wasting their time creating\nwhat would inevitably be another set of universal guidelines wherein western\nnotions would be applied to societies in which attitudes and practices were very\ndifferent. Yet 19 agreed that ethics guidelines could be useful in heightening\nresearchers'sensitivity to ethical issues. When asked to elaborate, the interviewees\nnoted that the guidance such as that proposed by ESPA could potentially raise\nissues that the researchers may not have been aware of or may have ignored in the\npast (e.g. their privileged position and relative wealth) (Molyneux and Geissler,\n2008). Whilst it was indeed wrong to assume that biomedically-rooted research\nethics could be universally applicable, the principles inherent in the ethical con-\nduct of research \u00ad integrity, respect for persons, beneficence, and justice \u00ad still\nprovided a useful yardstick against which to measure research practice (Honan\nA key concern was the inability of standardized REC protocols to take into\naccount ethical issues that arise in the field and the many evolving situational\njudgements that social (and one could argue natural science) researchers must\nmake as their project develops and circumstances change (Klitzman, 2012; Heimer,\nscope of a research study and suite of participants/actors with whom one will come\ninto contact can be anticipated in advance (Boden et al., 2009); however, as Blee\nand Currier (2011) point out, knowledge production is temporally, spatially and\nculturally bounded. All the interviewees stressed that context is crucial in the type\nof research that ESPA funds and that any ethics procedure and documentation\nmust be flexible enough to facilitate rather than inhibit their work, allowing them\nto take different customs into account (e.g. age at which one becomes an adult,\nnature of consent) and adjust to local circumstances without the need for a revised\nethics assessment (Araali, 2011). As Interviewee 7 argued:\nI think some of the ethics literature is not very helpful at all. It's, kind of, dancing on the point\nof a needle to make fine, fine judgements about things, which you can't make fine judgements\nabout in practice, particularly not in developing country settings. [...] there are real potentials\nfor making ethics make research impossible, [...] the idea that, you know, you set it all out in\nadvance, and if you change it, if you go back [...] to the ethics committee, to [...] approval of\nanything, any change ... well, ethnographic field work is always adjusting to local\ncircumstances and you can't go back, [...] and get further approval, because, you know, [...]\nit takes six months out of, you know, a year's field work time ... you've lost it ... you've just\ncompletely lost the project. [...] the other thing [...] we had [...] is that the local ethical\nreview board starts saying, `oh we don't think much of this project, you ought to be doing this\ninstead', and we think, `well we just got funded to do this', you know, how many times are\nwe going to go forwards and backwards with people who say, `we don't think you can do the\nresearch because it's not ethically viable because it's not scientifically viable or valid', and\nthen you have to go back to the funders and say `we're having to change the programme', you\nknow, and then you come and go, again, for six months before you're allowed to start. And\nit's, it's usually trivial.\nbetween macroethics (the domain in which RECs institute general principles for\nethical research conduct in the field) and microethics (everyday ethical dilemmas\nin specific research contexts), while Heimer (2013) notes the disparity between\nofficial ethics (ethics on the books) and ethics on the ground (ethics in action).\nBoth argue that ethics form part of \"an ongoing process that is always subject to\nnegotiation and reinterpretation rather than reification outside the research con-\ntext\" (Monaghan et al., 2013: 68). It is important that ethics guidance uphold core\nethical principles, but it has to meet the contextual needs of the researchers (Guta\net al., 2012) and give them the security to adapt methods as they see fit without the\nneed for further review (McCormack et al., 2012).\nThe interviewees also felt ethical guidance should be sensitive to specific issues\nsuch as the disruption of social norms. Although one interviewee noted that the\nwhole ethos of their discipline was to cause as little disruption as possible, the\nmajority felt that an element of disruption was inevitable given the nature of the\nprojects that ESPA funds (e.g. engaging with local communities, knowledge\nexchange, development), that this would happen regardless of where the researcher\nwas from, and that it was not necessarily always a bad thing. For example:\nWell I guess there ... it's a kind of a utilitarian perspective somewhat, which is the social norms,\nare they in the good of society as whole? So if it's a social norm, for example, that women have\nno control over certain household assets or livestock, it may be, in the short term, [...] something\nwhich is useful for the men, but in the long term, it's not useful for the society as a whole. So I\nthink that you shouldn't do ... disrupt social norms just for the sake of it, or if harm could result,\nbut if, if ... sometimes social norms have to change in order for development to happen. So,\nbasically, it's something we should be careful about, think it through, but certainly not a blanket,\nyou know. I mean female circumcision is a social norm. (Interviewee 5)\nA clear distinction was made between positive and negative disruption; whilst\nany social interaction is disruptive, the consensus amongst the interviewees was\nthat it is important to ensure that it is supportive and encouraging rather than\naggressive and unpleasant. The overall sense was that no set of guidance notes\nwould ever be able (or should indeed try) to take all eventualities into account and\nit was impractical to ask researchers to document these on a form, However,\nresearchers must be aware of their potential impact on the situations they found\nthemselves in and the people they come into contact with, and realize that there\nmight be a lasting impact that remains long after the research is complete\n(Molyneux and Geissler, 2008). Likewise, researchers must find ways to recog-\nnize and strengthen the agency of so-called vulnerable individuals, groups and\ncommunities, whom institutional review has thus far only viewed as candidates\nConclusions\nThe principle aim of this research was to produce an ethics form and accompany-\ning guidance notes for the ESPA research community which would sensitize\nmembers to the ethical issues associated with undertaking collaborative research\nin developing countries. Despite the small sample size, the findings from the sur-\nvey and interview data suggest that the participants did accept the importance of,\nand need for, ethical review when undertaking collaborative work in developing\ncountries (Librett and Perrone, 2010) and that they were more likely than not to\nhave had their ESPA/ESRC-DIFD projects reviewed. However, negative percep-\ntions of what this entails (e.g. time, effort, bureaucracy) and /or an ambivalence\ntowards ethics have in the past meant that some respondents have not taken ethi-\ncal assessment seriously (Dyer and Demeritt, 2008; Mollet, 2011) or have avoided\nit where possible. As such, consideration of ethics appears to have been the result\nof external drivers rather than a desire to critically think through research practice\nand the nature of the collaborative relationships in which these researchers were\nparticipating. Whilst there appears to be a particular need to raise awareness of\nthe relevance and potential benefits of ethical review amongst natural science\nresearchers and/or those using modelling or secondary data, it would seem that\npart of the problem lies not necessarily with `ethics'per se but with the prevailing\nsystems of ethical governance and the bureaucracies imposed by current REC\nregulation (Emmerich, 2013). For example, even those participants who had\nattempted to fully engage with their institutional ethics procedures (or those of a\nrelevant professional body) expressed dissatisfaction with the rigidity of REC\nregulation and highlighted the difficulty of applying certain principles in devel-\noping world contexts \u00ad critiques which are already well-established within the\nliterature.\nThe respondents cautioned against fostering a compliance culture wherein to\nbe `ethical' means to conform to the `prescriptions and proscriptions' of the REC\n(Hammersley, 2014). Their advice was that the ESPA guidance should facilitate a\nsituated ethics (Ekberg, 2012) which appreciated the need for flexibility and gave\nresearchers the confidence and support to make in situ decisions without the need\nfor further validation. This would require a rethinking of ethics as `practice' and\nan appreciation (on the part of the REC) of the locally specific relationships\nbetween the researchers and researched, but also require a higher degree of reflex-\nivity (on the part of the researcher) in relation to the research process and their\ncollaborative relationships. For example, there is a need to raise awareness of the\nmutual benefits and reassurances that can be derived from formal agreements\n(e.g. in relation to IPR, collaborative relationships with non-academic partners,\nmonitoring and evaluation procedures). Conversely, there is also a need to recog-\nnize that long-standing collaborative relationships or blanket ethics clearance\nagreements between institutions may lead to complacency and prevent new pro-\njects from being ethically assessed on a case by case basis. A key determinant of\nthe above of course is time; grant recipients must be encouraged and enabled to\nbuild time into their projects to think about the practicalities of ethical research\nand share this information with their collaborating partners to form mutually\nagreeable parameters.\nThe overall sense from the research participants was that ESPA's initiative was\nnot misguided per se as it would go some way towards ensuring that proper respect\nwas shown to the people with whom, and environments that, ESPA funded\nresearchers came into contact with, particularly given the dearth of RECs in the\ndeveloping world. In this sense, the ESPA ethics guidance notes would not be ask-\ning the researchers to do anything different from what they should be doing any-\nway; rather, they would encourage the researchers to give in-depth consideration\nto the ethical issues involved in their research, whether it involved human partici-\npants or not, to ensure that they had ethical clearance from the appropriate authori-\nties/people, and ensure that their protocols were locally appropriate (de Vries et al.,\n2011). That said, it was recommended that if the PI was based in the UK (or in an\ninstitution outside the UK which has a robust REC), the research should be ethi-\ncally reviewed by their institution REC or ESPA, but not by both. RECs which\nlack experience in, or are uninformed about, this type of research sometimes have\na `paternalistic' tendency to require researchers to take additional (and often dis-\nproportionate) precautions to ensure the `safety' of the research participants\n(Klitzman, 2012; de Vries et al., 2011); in such cases the researchers would be able\nto draw on the ESPA guidance in order to justify their protocols. Any guidance\nissued by ESPA should of course be subject to periodic renewal and revision\n(Bond, 2012). In time, the hope would be that all ESPA grant recipients would\nmake every effort to get all, or at least part of, their proposed research reviewed by\na robust REC in the host country. However, it was recognized that this may not be\npossible in some countries for a considerable length of time. Just who should be\nresponsible for helping to facilitate the development of robust host country RECs\nremains to be seen, but the respondents were keen to place this burden at the feet\nof funding bodies such as ESPA and the PI institutions rather than the award\nholders.\n"
