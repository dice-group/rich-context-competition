This will be done by an analysis of riots in the\nNetherlands in the last five decades and of one exemplary case of a recent riot known as\nthe `Slotervaart riots' of 2007. The focus of this article is thus on collective disturbances\nof public order in a Dutch context \u00ad with a special light on the societal reactions such\nriots evoke \u00ad that highlight the struggle between dominant and subordinate classes and/\nor cultures, as well as the labelling processes involved.\nAnalytical approach\nThe data used in this article are derived from a review of secondary material on riots in\nthe Netherlands in the last five decades and from an ongoing study into societal reactions\nto Moroccan Dutch youngsters in the Netherlands, consisting of a critical analysis of two\nriots in which these ethnic youngsters played a prominent role, namely the 2007\n`Slotervaart riots' and 2010 `Culemborg riots', and of a riot in which these youngsters\ndid not play any role,2 namely the 2007 `Ondiep riots'. These three riots, and the societal\nreactions they evoked, have been examined using Cohen's (2002) classic moral panic\ntheory, which offers a number of sensitizing concepts (Blumer, 1954) for understanding\nsocietal reactions to social deviance, including both `folk devils' (Cohen, 2002) and the\nprocess of `Othering' (Young, 2007). Following Altheide's method of qualitative docu-\nment analysis (Altheide and Schneider, 2013), these sensitizing concepts have been\ntranslated into protocol questions and are used as a focus in the analysis of the media\ndiscourse. This protocol is a way to ask questions of the documents, in order to capture\n`definitions, meanings, processes and types'in the media discourses following these riots\n(Altheide and Schneider, 2013: 44\u00ad5). The answers to these protocol questions found in\nthe media discourse were then coded in Atlas.ti, using codes comprising a prefix (an\nabbreviated precode) referring to the sensitizing concept (the question) and an `open\ncode' derived from the quotation (the answer). Thereafter, the coded data were com-\npared, categorized and conceptualized (Hennink et al., 2011) in Network Views. The\nmedia discourse is chosen because it is one of the most important arenas of public dis-\ncourse and is a window on societal reactions in a society. It consists of newspaper articles\nin Dutch newspapers Telegraaf (TG), De Volkskrant (VK) and Metro (ME), and televi-\nsion news programmes NOVA (NO), EenVandaag (EV) and Pauw & Witteman (PW),\npublished and broadcast in the three months following the triggering event.3\nThis article is divided into two parts. First, a change in the dynamics of riots in the\nNetherlands in the last five decades is delineated, and, second, the 2007 Slotervaart\nriot is discussed as an exemplary case of a recent riot in which these changes are\nreflected best.\nFrom `political' riots to `social' riots of the Other\nA recent history of riots in the Netherlands\nDuring the secularization and cultural and sexual revolutions of the 1960s, social move-\nments, action groups and countercultures, mainly consisting of students, squatters and\nleft radicals, flourished in the Netherlands. Their resistance manifested itself in protests,\nprovocations and confrontations in public spaces directed at the established order\ndemonstrations escalated into riots against the police. On 10 March 1966, a protest by a\nleft radical anti-authoritarian social movement called Provo, against the engagement of\nPrincess Beatrix to `ex-Wehrmacht soldier' Claus von Amsberg, escalated into riots\nagainst the police. Three months later, a protest by unorganized construction workers\nagainst vacation salary cuts, supported by Provo and other left radical movements, esca-\nlated into riots against the police and a newspaper headquarters (COT, 2002: 17\u00ad19;\nagainst the Board of the University of Amsterdam, demanding democratization and con-\nsisting of demonstrations and the occupation of a part of the university, ended with a\nsignificant confrontation between students and the police (Bervoets, 2011: 343\u00ad6).\nThese escalated protests of the turbulent 1960s proved to be the prelude to more politi-\ncal riots in the two following decades, mainly involving squatters and members of envi-\nronmental and anti-nuclear movements. The squatters'movement, which originated in the\n2009: 17\u00ad22), was mainly involved in riots that broke out during evictions, such as in the\nNijmegen and the 1990 `WNC riots' in Groningen (Van der Varst, 2011). But the climax\nof these `squatters' riots' was during the coronation of Princess Beatrix in 1980. In these\nlatter, so-called `coronation riots', squatters clashed with the police in several places in the\nAmsterdam city centre under the motto `no houses, no coronation' (Duivenvoorden,\nanti-nuclear movements, were preceded by protests against or blockades of nuclear power\nor against nuclear weapons, such as the blockades of ammunition trains in 1982 and the\nFrom the 1990s onwards, the readiness to take action appeared to decline among\ning protest movements and other left activists resorted more and more to legal resistance,\nConcurrently, the dynamics of riots changed from escalated politically or ideologically\nmotivated protests, evictions, blockades and other forms of resistance to increasingly\n`apolitical' and isolated incidents triggering riots lacking such clearly articulated politi-\ncal components (COT, 2002: 33\u00ad4). These `social' riots of the last two decades largely\ntook place in urban neighbourhoods, in contrast to the symbolic places where the earlier\npolitical protests were held, such as the universities, squats and power plants. In addition,\nthey tended to be triggered by isolated incidents, for example a police shooting of a resi-\nNew Year's Eve disturbances (see the Oosterparkwijk 1998 and Terweijde 2010 riots).\nThe urban neighbourhoods that served as stages for these riots are largely disadvantaged\nneighbourhoods that harbour an accumulation of social problems (for example, poverty,\nunemployment, poor education and housing, nuisance and crime), a general feeling of\ninjustice and marginalization among the residents, tensions with the police and other\nOthering the rioters\nWith this lack of clearly articulated motives in these contemporary social riots, it is more\ndifficult for the authorities, the politicians, the media, scientists and the general public to\ndetermine who these rioters are and what their motives are. Simultaneously, despite this\nlack of clarity or precisely because of this obscurity, `folk devils' (often the usual sus-\npects) are yet simplistically designated in the societal reactions as the rioters, who are\nthen demarcated as exogenous groups and often differentiated from the neighbourhood\nresidents as autonomous groups. For example, whereas in the Oosterparkwijk, Slotervaart\n(2007) and Terweijde riots, the rioters were claimed to be groups of `criminal youngsters'\nwho it was suggested had been terrorizing `the neighbourhood residents' long before the\nriots, in the Graafsewijk (2000 and 2005) and Ondiep riots, thrill-seeking `football hoo-\nligans' and so-called `riot tourists' flocking from all parts of the city and country for a\n`moral holiday' were held responsible for the neighbourhood disturbances. In the\nSlotervaart (1998 and 2007) and Culemborg riots, an ethnic Other was constructed,\nbecause Moroccan Dutch youngsters were designated as the folk devils.4 This designa-\ntion of simplistic demarcated groups of Others as the culprits (Othering) is explained by\nYoung (2007) as a natural reaction or solution of a society to increasing ontological and\neconomic insecurity and increasing pluralism in late modernity. This solution consists of\ndistancing \u00ad the blaming of `factors or groups which are seen as unrelated to the normal\nfunctioning social order' (Young, 2007: 142) \u00ad and of an inversion of the society-and-\ncrime relation in which riots are seen as an autonomous problem `for' society instead of\n`arising from' the problems of society (Young, 2007: 142). Thus, it has tended to be\nclaimed that the underlying `problems of society' that are strongly reflected in disadvan-\ntaged neighbourhoods (such as poverty, social exclusion and class differences) have not,\nor at least not primarily, caused the disturbances. Rather, the demarcated groups and their\nconduct are pushed forward as an autonomous problem for society. For instance, the\nanalysis of societal reactions to the three-day Ondiep riots revealed a focus on the so-\ncalled `football hooligans'and `riot tourists'as the main culprits, whereas the neighbour-\nhood itself and its residents, including their ongoing anger and discontent about the\nactions and reactions of the police, their own socioeconomic status, the gentrification\nprocess instigated by local authorities, and ongoing problems with loiterers, were more\nusually discussed as the setting for the riots than as the roots of the riots (see also Van\nA similar observation is made by Schinkel (2007) in a broader Dutch context, where\nhe describes a similar urge of the Dutch dominant cultural majority to place social prob-\nlems outside of the normal, pure and healthy societal body, by linking them (more spe-\ncifically) to migrant cultures and thus enabling assimilation into the `flawless' Dutch\nculture and society to be brought forward as `the' solution. This linking of social prob-\nlems to ethnic groups, and those of Moroccan ethnicity in particular, can be seen in two\nof the most recent riots that took place in the Netherlands, in the disadvantaged\nneighbourhoods of Slotervaart (2007) and Terweijde (2010). The first of these two riots,\nthe 2007 Slotervaart riot, will be presented in the remainder of this article, because,\ndespite being one of the least serious social outbursts of the last two decades, it excel-\nlently illustrates the nature of these recent `social' riots in the Netherlands and the\nOthering processes they put in motion. Being one of the least serious riots, one could ask\nwhether these public disturbances can qualify as a riot when compared internationally?\nIn practice, these disturbances are riots from a Dutch perspective, in which small-scale\nand/or one-day riots are more regular than large-scale and/or multi-day riots (Adang\nSlotervaart 2007: Riots of `the Moroccan Other'\nThe prelude: The social construction of `the Moroccans drama'\nSince the arrival of Moroccan `guest workers' in the 1960s and 1970s, and then their\nwives and children during the 1970s and 1980s, the social situation of some of this immi-\ngrant group has improved, with increasing numbers of Moroccan Dutch succeeding in\neducation, the labour market and the housing market, and a Moroccan Dutch middle\nclass emerging as a consequence (Dagevos et al., 2006; SCP, 2009). However, despite\nthese positive developments, this community, complex and fragmented as it is, is also\nsubject to a number of negative images and representations, which focus in particular on\nsome Moroccan Dutch male youngsters who `stand out'in social problems, such as crim-\ninality, nuisance, unemployment, high school dropout rates (CBS, 2014) and Islamic\nradicalization (AIVD, 2007; Buijs et al., 2006) when compared with other ethnic groups\nin the Netherlands. These social problems have gained a prominent role in Dutch public\ndiscourse, especially around high-profile events such as the earlier riots in Slotervaart\n(1998), the murder of cinematographer Theo van Gogh (2004), the activities of the\n(alleged) Islamic terrorist group known as the `Hofstadgroep'(2004\u00ad5), the nuisance and\ncrime in the Gouda neighbourhood of Oosterwei (2008\u00ad9), the travelling of Moroccan\nDutch fighters to Syria and Iraq since 2011, the rise of a `Moroccan mafia' and related\ngangland killings since 2012, and the failed jewellery robbery in Deurne (2014). As a\nconsequence of these events and societal reactions, Moroccan Dutch youngsters have\nbecome the prime symbol of nuisance, crime and Islamic radicalization in cities such as\nAmsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht, but also in smaller towns such as Gouda, Veenendaal\nand Ede. These social problems and debates in the media, political and scientific dis-\ncourse of the last decade, are now being referred to as `the Moroccans problem', `the\nSlotervaart is constructed as just another episode in this long litany of trouble.\nThe drama: The police shooting of Bilal B\nSlotervaart, a disadvantaged neighbourhood in the Dutch capital of Amsterdam, is known\nfor its relatively large Moroccan Dutch community, comprising 20 percent overall\nSlotervaart, 2007) and is often linked to many social problems, including poverty,\novercrowded housing, dysfunctional parenting, unemployment, high welfare dependency,\nhigh school dropout levels, language delay, nuisance, crime and Islamic radicalization\n(for example, in municipal reports: Gemeente Amsterdam, 2007, 2015b; in the media:\n`Vogelaar neighbourhoods', the 40 most problematic neighbourhoods in the Netherlands\nthat were part of a national programme for urban improvement led by Secretary Ella\nVogelaar of Housing, Neighbourhoods and Integration (VROM, 2007). On Sunday 14\nOctober 2007, neighbourhood resident Bilal B., a 22-year-old schizophrenic Moroccan\nDutchman on leave from a mental hospital, was shot dead by the police after walking into\nthe neighbourhood's police station and stabbing two officers. Out of fear of a recurrence\nof the 1998 Slotervaart riots, where Moroccan Dutch residents clashed with the police\nafter a young Moroccan Dutch resident was arrested, the local authorities quickly con-\ntacted several influential people and representatives from the neighbourhood in an attempt\nThe next day, the identity of Bilal and his Moroccan ethnicity were revealed in an\nafternoon press conference, and in the neighbourhood the media had an increasingly high\nprofile, which caused some tensions with residents and resulted in a television camera\ncrew being threatened, assaulted and chased away by some residents (for example, NO,\n15 October 2007). Yet the local authorities and neighbourhood residents and representa-\ntives still managed to maintain calm throughout the day, until around 11 o'clock in the\nevening, when residents gathered on the August Alleb\u00e9 Square in front of the police sta-\ntion, some out of curiosity and others demanding answers about the police shooting.\nFrom within the crowd, dozens of youngsters began to vandalize public and private\nproperty, damaging cars and setting one on fire, and throwing stones at the police station,\nsmashing some windows. It took until midnight before the police, who were surprised by\nthe outbreak, were able to take control of the situation, though even then they were not\nable to make any arrests. From that point on, extra police, including riot police, were\ndeployed to guard the August Alleb\u00e9 Square and to keep the calm. Nevertheless, 19 cars\nwere set on fire in and around the neighbourhood during the rest of the week, and only\neight people were arrested on suspicion of trying to set cars on fire, none of whom was\nsubsequently convicted. This collective and spontaneous disturbance of public order on\nMonday evening 15 October in Slotervaart and the 19 car fires that disturbed the nights\nthat followed in the rest of the week have been defined as `the riots of Slotervaart' in\npublic discourse by different actors (local authorities, politicians, media, etc.), and have\neventually been stored as such in the collective memory.5\nThe audience: Othering the rioters\nIt never became clear to the law enforcement agencies, however, who (exactly or even\nroughly) the dozens of rioters at the August Alleb\u00e9 Square on Monday were, who contin-\nued setting cars on fire in the ensuing nights, let alone what their (political or ideological)\naims and motives might have been, assuming they had any. Information about those\narrested does not provide an answer, for there were only about 17 in all (and no one was\narrested during the riot on the Monday), the vast majority of whom were quickly released\nand never convicted because of a lack of evidence and/or just cause (Police Chief Bernard\nthis lack of a clear view, the rioters were nevertheless defined as an autonomous and\nexogenous group of `Moroccan youngsters' in societal reactions. Police Chief Welten\nofficials and politicians (for example, NO, 19 October 2007) explicitly pointed to the\nusual suspects: a group of Moroccan Dutch criminal youngsters who it was claimed had\nbeen terrorizing Slotervaart for years. Different estimates were roughly given, with this\ncriminals' in the whole Amsterdam-West borough (for example, Mayor Cohen in: TG, 1\nNovember 2007: 37). In the more general social reactions to the violence, Bilal and the\nrioters were broadened from a small number of problem youngsters in Slotervaart to all\n`Moroccan problem youngsters' in Amsterdam, and at the same time, as we will see\nsubsequently, were implicitly and explicitly linked to Moroccan ethnicity and culture,\nand then linked to the more general so-called `Moroccans problem' in the Netherlands.\nDistancing the rioters. This symbolization of the Slotervaart riots as just another episode of\n`the Moroccans problem' and `Moroccan youngsters' as the folk devils in societal reac-\ntions, comprises the distancing of Bilal and the rioters as `Moroccans'. The first distanc-\ning, concerning Bilal, symbolized him as a typical `Moroccan folk devil', beginning with\nthe use of his Moroccan ethnicity as a signifier (ethnicization). This started after the press\nconference on the day after his death, where the Chief Public Prosecutor of Amsterdam,\nLeo de Wit, said of the incident: `It concerns the 22-year-old from Amsterdam of Moroc-\ncan descent, Bilal B.'(NO, 15 October 2007). What followed was a great many references\nin public discourse to the `Moroccan' (VK, 1 November 2007: 3), the `Moroccan young-\nThe second distancing contained a discussion of three strongly intertwined themes in\npublic discourse. The first, in which Bilal was presented as `a psychiatric patient', com-\nprised an elaboration of his psychiatric history (for example, VK, 16 October 2007: 3)\nand a public debate on the treatment of mental illness in the Netherlands in general (for\nexample, EV, 17 October 2007). The next theme was one in which Bilal was spoken of\nas `a hardened criminal', and involved an elaboration of what was taken to be Bilal's\ncriminal and violent history, despite his not having any police contact in the previous two\nyears (for example, TG, 16 October 2007: 1 and 3). The final theme involved suggestions\nthat Bilal was `a terrorist', and claims were made about alleged ties between him and\nMohamed B., the Moroccan Dutch murderer of cinematographer Theo van Gogh in\n2004, Samir A., a Moroccan Dutch youngster convicted of planning terrorist attacks in\nthe Netherlands, and the `Hofstadgroep', an alleged Dutch terrorist network (for exam-\nple, NO, 15 October 2007). Using these three themes (psychiatric patient, hardened\ncriminal and terrorist), Bilal was linked in the public discourse to wider anxieties that\nwere part of a perceived `Moroccans problem', namely the relatively high number of\nMoroccan Dutch youngsters with mental health issues and criminal records, and the\nproblem of the radicalization of Moroccan Dutch youngsters in the Netherlands.\nIn a process paralleling the presentation of Bilal, the rioters were also symbolized as\ntypical `Moroccan folk devils', again through ethnicization and by linking them to the\nperceived general `Moroccans problem'. First, through ethnicization, the rioters were\nlinked to the Moroccan ethnicity with frequent references to `Moroccan youngsters'\n`Moroccan rioters' (for example, VK, 17 October 2007: 7), `rioting Moroccan young-\n`Moroccan folk devils' also consisted of the linking of the rioters in public discourse to\na number of other social problems usually linked to `Moroccans', including crime, nui-\nsance, unemployment and school dropout. Anti-social and criminal behaviour in particu-\nlar were most commonly attributed to the rioters and `Moroccan youngsters' in general.\nThey were spoken of as `nuisance makers' (for example, PW, 15 October 2007), who\nwere claimed to be `terrorizing the streets' (VK, 27 October 2007: 15), `loitering' (for\n`troublemakers'(for example, ME, 19 October 2007: 18), `using profanity'(for example,\nbe `criminals'(for example, ME, 18 October 2007: 1), associated for example with `theft'\n(for example, EV, 16 October 2007), `criminal threatening'(for example, PW, 17 October\nNovember 2007: 22\u00ad3). Furthermore, the rioters were linked to the general social prob-\nOctober 2007: 5) and to other riots in which `Moroccans' played a prominent role, such\nInverting the cause. The roots of this deviant and immoral behaviour by these constructed\n`Moroccan' folk devils were mainly sought within two intertwined explanatory frame-\nworks: culture and structure. The cultural framework locates the overall problem in\n`Moroccan culture', mainly by referring to a lack of `integration' into Dutch society or\nculture (for example, TG, 17 October 2007: 3) or too much `segregation' from the Dutch\nclaim that the deviant culture and morality of `the Moroccans' is the cause for the many\nsocial problems Moroccan Dutch youngsters experience, and they were supported in this\nsocial problems and fears to cultures is a result of what he calls culturism (a contraction\nof `culture'and `ism'), an equivalent of racism that has risen in the Netherlands since the\n1990s, in which social problems are linked not to race but to cultures, and the social\nexclusion or stigmatization of peoples is based not on racial but on cultural characteris-\nThe structural framework focuses on the disadvantages of an `underclass' (for exam-\ncation (for example, ME, 24 October 2007: 16). Yet it is the combination of these two\nframeworks that became the most common explanation, with structural disadvantages\nbeing linked to the Moroccan ethnicity, not least by referring to the relatively high num-\nber of Moroccan Dutch suffering from these disadvantages, thus placing these problems\nunder the umbrella of `the Moroccans problem'(for example, VK, 1 November 2007: 3).\nHence, instead of speaking of general alienated poor suffering from socioeconomic dis-\nadvantages, the public discourse focused on the ethnic and cultural background of these\ndesignated culprits. An example of the structural cultural link is the association of the\nMoroccan ethnicity with dysfunctional families living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods.\nThese `dysfunctional Moroccan families' are herein linked to `poverty' (TG, 19 October\nparenting' (for example, NO, 19 October 2007), `domestic violence', harmful `imports',\ndiscipline children without beating' (PW, 17 December 2007).\nThese two most prominent explanatory frameworks, and their intertwining, are both\nclassic examples of liberal Othering, where the Other is problematized and seen as lack-\ning the morality of the dominant cultural majority caused by `cultural circumstances or\nmaterial deprivation' (Young, 2007: 5\u00ad7). This linking of riots, nuisance, crime, terror-\nism, mental illness, unemployment and school dropout with the Moroccan ethnicity, and\nthe focus on the `other' Moroccan culture in the search for the roots of the riots, places\nthese social problems `outside' the Dutch social order and constructs them as imported\n`into' society. In other words, it is a `Moroccan' problem, not a `Dutch' problem.\nDiscourse of Othering. This process of Othering in societal reactions is facilitated by\nwhat Schinkel (2008) calls multiculturealism (a contraction of `multiculturalism' and\n`realism'), a discourse that emerged in the public discussion of the immigrant Other\nwas the dominant discourse in debates on the immigrant Other, in which political cor-\nrectness was the norm and a taboo was placed on the linking of social problems to\nethnicities and cultures. From the 1990s onwards, this discourse became increasingly\ncriticized as being dysfunctional and too `idealistic' and became more and more\nreplaced by `multiculturealism', consisting of a populist, chauvinistic and `realist'\nstyle of political incorrectness, and a reversed taboo, namely a taboo on the denial of\nthe link between social problems and ethnicity and culture (Schinkel, 2008; see also\nVan Swaaningen, 2005). This relatively new discourse of `multiculturealism' has\nbeen hegemonic in the last two decades in the Netherlands, and has opened the door\nfor the blaming of ethnic groups (distancing), the search for exogenous roots of social\nproblems (inversion) and the explicit Othering of ethnic people, because this is no\nlonger obstructed in the public discourse by the former ambiance of taboos and politi-\ncal correctness.\nIn societal reactions to the Slotervaart riots, this dominant discourse of `multiculture-\nalism', plays an important facilitating role and manifests itself in three types of claims in\nthe public discourse on Moroccan Dutch: denial, neutralization and pampering.\nFirst, there are claims of denial in which it is claimed that the problems of `Moroccans'\nare being denied and that there has been too little naming of the Moroccan ethnicity and\nlabelling of `Moroccans'. For instance, Henk Kamp, MP of the Dutch Liberal-\nConservative party VVD, and Mayor Cohen both emphasize that these problems with\n`Moroccan' youngsters should not be `denied' this time (PW, 17 December 2007).\nAnother example is to be found in letters to the editors, where the government is often\naccused of `sticking their heads in the sand' for problems relating to `Moroccans' (for\nSecond, if `the Moroccans problem' is acknowledged, claims of neutralization are\nmade, in which it is claimed that these problems are still being nuanced or played down\ntoo much, as when Ella Vogelaar, the Secretary of Integration, was vilified on live televi-\nsion by journalist Jort Kelder and author Heleen van Royen for too much nuancing and\nplaying down of the problems of `Moroccan youngsters' (PW, 13 November 2007).\nThird, through claims of pampering, claims-makers complain that the government,\nstate officials and politicians are being too `soft' on `Moroccans', for example by refer-\nring to the (former) patronizing Dutch governments (for example, TG, 19 December\n2007, p. 3), or, more in line with culturism, by accusing them of `drinking too much tea'\nwith `Moroccans' (for example, EV, 16 October 2007), referring to the Moroccan tea\nculture, instead of clamping down on these folk devils.\nIn conclusion\nThe 1960\u00ad90 era was the heyday for social movements, action groups and countercul-\ntures in the Netherlands. Their resistance during these decades often manifested itself in\nstreet protests, which sometimes escalated into `political'riots. From the 1990s onwards,\nthe readiness to take action declined and the remaining protest movements and other left\nactivists increasingly resorted to legal resistance or were absorbed into the political sys-\ntem. As a consequence, the earlier political riots were replaced by `social' riots lacking\nsuch clearly articulated political components, and which tended to be triggered by `apo-\nlitical' and isolated incidents in disadvantaged neighbourhoods.\nBecause of this lack of clearly articulated motives in such recent social riots, it is\nincreasingly the case that any precise identification of who rioters were initially remains\nsomewhat obscure for the law enforcement agencies. Yet, in public discourse, the pattern\nis for fingers to be quickly pointed at demarcated groups of folk devils, such as the `foot-\nball hooligans' and `riot tourists' coming from `other' cities as the culprits in the\nGraafsewijk and Ondiep riots. With this focus on simplistic demarcated exogenous\ngroups of Others during riots, it has tended to be claimed that the underlying `problems\nof society', which are strongly reflected in disadvantaged neighbourhoods, have not\nbeen, or at least not primarily, among the causes of the disturbances. Rather, the demar-\ncated groups (for example, `football hooligans') and their conduct (`rioting') are pushed\nforward as autonomous problems for society.\nThe 2007 Slotervaart riot, an exemplary case of such recent riots in the Netherlands,\nillustrates how a riot without a clearly articulated political component occurred in a dis-\nadvantaged neighbourhood of Amsterdam and evoked negative societal reactions that\nwere primarily and quickly directed at the demarcated ethnic group of Moroccan Dutch\nyoungsters, designating them as folk devils. Within this societal reaction, the riots were\nlinked to Moroccan ethnicity and to other social problems and fears, such as crime, nui-\nsance and radicalization, which are usually linked to this `migrant' group, reproducing\nand enforcing the so-called `Moroccans problem'in the Netherlands. With the placing of\nthis riot under the umbrella of `the Moroccans problem', facilitated by the rise of `cultur-\nism' and the dominant discourse of `multiculturealism', this social problem and its roots\nare placed outside of the normal, pure and `flawless' Dutch societal body.\nThese societal reactions to these recent social riots, in which clear boundaries are\nsought and placed between the normal Self and the deviant Other, can be seen as natural\nreactions or solutions of societies to increasing ontological and economic insecurity and\nincreasing pluralism in late modernity (Young, 2007). A consequence of such societal\nreactions is that attention in the public discourse is too much focused on these designated\nautonomous and exogenous groups of Others (distancing) and on exogenous causes that\nare unrelated to the normal functioning social order (inversion), while the underlying\n`problems of society' (such as poverty, social exclusion and class differences), which are\nstrongly reflected in the disadvantaged neighbourhoods where these riots take place, are\npushed to the periphery of attention.\n"
