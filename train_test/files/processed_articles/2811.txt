[1, 2] Longitudinal analyses examining dis-\nability progression have accounted for this variation by using multiple trajectories. [2\u00ad4] Often\nthese analyses use advanced statistical techniques, such as latent class growth analysis or mix-\nture modeling to identify distinct groups of individuals that follow similar patterns of change\nover time. However, this statistical methodology requires large sample sizes and several time\npoints to ensure model convergence, validity, and sufficient statistical power. [5\u00ad7] Alternative\nmethods that overcome these constraints would facilitate trajectory research among a wider\nvariety of study designs and populations.\nMost studies investigating disability trajectories in late-life have focused on activities of\ndaily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), [2\u00ad4, 8, 9] and few have\nexamined trajectories of mobility change. Mobility limitations, which conceptually precede\ndisability within models of disablement, are typically the target of rehabilitative intervention.\nLimitations in mobility are common among older adults, affecting approximately one quarter\nof adults aged 70 years and older and half of those aged 80 years and older. [10] Mobility limi-\ntations pose a significant threat to the health and independence of older adults, leading to poor\noutcomes such as falling, hospitalization, nursing home admission and mortality. [11\u00ad17] The\nBoston Rehabilitative Impairment Study of the Elderly (Boston RISE), was designed to investi-\ngate key research questions identified by experts in geriatric rehabilitation, such as identifying\nunderlying predictors of poor and declining mobility. [18] Thus, mobility trajectories repre-\nsent a major outcome for Boston RISE.\nWhile advanced statistical techniques used to model trajectories require adequate sample\nsize and sufficient time points, the values for these requirements are not completely rigid and\ndepend on additional factors such model complexity and the amount of variance explained by\nthe model. [7] Nevertheless, there are certain generally accepted guidelines. For example, three\nor more follow-up time points are typically required, although two time points may be ade-\nquate in the case of partially missing data for some participants. [7, 19] In addition, a sample\nsize of at least 100 participants is generally preferred for growth curve modeling; however the\nadequacy of this number is also dependent on the number of observations per individual, and\ntherefore more participants may be needed when fewer follow-up time points are available. [7]\nThis study aimed to identify distinct trajectories of mobility change using 3 time points\nover 2 years of follow-up within 430 older adult primary care patients. To overcome the con-\nstraints of modest sample size and minimal follow-up time points, we generated trajectories of\nmobility change using a novel approach that incorporated both clinical reasoning and distribu-\ntion-based methodology. We demonstrated the validity of our approach using latent class\ngrowth analysis and by comparing differences across trajectories in baseline mobility-related\nhealth conditions, body functions/impairments, personal factors, and physical function/activi-\nties consistent with the World Health Organization's International Classification of Function-\ning, Disability, and Health and Nagi disablement models. [20\u00ad22] We hypothesized that that\nthese factors, particularly body functions/impairments and physical function/activities, would\ndiffer across trajectories with more deficits observed for unfavorable mobility trajectories.\nMethods\nThe Boston Rehabilitative Impairment Study of the Elderly (Boston RISE) is a prospective\ncohort study designed to identify modifiable impairments that are associated with mobility in\nolder adults. Study methods have been previously detailed. [23] Briefly, primary care patients\naged !65 years were recruited from 9 practices across the greater Boston area from December\nA Novel Approach to Identifying Trajectories of Mobility Change in Older Adults\nFunding: This work was supported by the National\nwww.nia.nih.gov/); the Eunice Kennedy Shriver\nNational Institute of Child Health and Human\nwww.nichd.nih.gov/Pages/index.aspx); and the\nNational Center for Research Resources in a grant\nto the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science\nnih.gov/about/almanac/organization/NCRR.htm).\nREW is supported by the National Institute on\nDisability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation\nprograms/NIDILRR/).

Patients who met preliminary inclusion criteria within the practices\nwere randomly selected for inclusion on a master recruitment list. The master list was divided\ninto subgroups based on age, sex, and race, and oversampling was used to ensure that the\ncohort was representative of the older adult population residing within a 10 mile radius of the\nhealthcare facility. Eligibility included difficulty or task modification with walking one-half\nmile and/or climbing 1 flight of stairs. [16] Exclusions included moderate or severe dementia\n(Mini-Mental State Examination score <18), and severe mobility limitation (Short Physical\nPerformance Battery [SPPB] score <4). [24, 25] All methods were approved by the Spaulding\nten consent was obtained from all participants. Baseline assessments were completed by 430\nparticipants. This analysis included 391 participants (n = 8 died, n = 8 withdrew due to illness,\nn = 23 withdrew or were lost to follow-up) with mobility measured at baseline and either or\nboth annual assessment in the two year follow-up period (n = 46 had outcome at year 1 but\nnot year 2; n = 1 had outcome at year 2 but not year 1).\nLLFDI Lower-Extremity Function\nThe Lower-Extremity Function component of the patient-reported Late Life Function and\nDisability Instrument (LLFDI) is a widely used, validated measure of mobility [26] that\nassesses functional limitations applicable to daily life [27] consistent with both the Interna-\ntional Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health [20] and Nagi disablement [22]\nmodels. The LLFDI contains two lower-extremity scales: 1) Basic Lower-Extremity Function\n(BLE)\u00adtasks involving standing, stooping, and basic walking; and 2) Advanced Lower-Extrem-\nity Function (ALE)\u00adinvolving higher levels of physical ability and endurance, such as walking\nseveral blocks or standing up from the floor. Higher scores represent better mobility. We have\npreviously shown that a change of 4.4 in BLE and 6.3 in ALE reflect the minimal detectable\nBaseline Characteristics\nThis analysis included various baseline characteristics from several of the domains within the\ndisablement models. Personal factors included age, sex, race, and education. Cognition was\nmeasured using the widely-used and validated Mini-Mental State Examination. [29, 30] Over-\nweight and obesity status were defined using body mass index categories. Sensory loss was\nmeasured using the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. A 4.17 monofilament (providing a\nstandardized force of 1.4g) was applied to the dorsum of the right toe until the thread buckled.\nIf the participant could not feel the 4.17 monofilament during at least 3 out of 4 trials, a 5.07\nmonofilament (providing a standardized 10g force) was applied. Inability to feel both the 4.17\nand the 5.07 monofilament during 3 out of 4 trials was considered evidence of sensory loss.\n[31] Several neuromuscular impairments that were associated with baseline mobility were\nincluded. [32] Strength was measured on a pneumatic leg press machine using a previously\npublished protocol. [23] Strength asymmetry was calculated by dividing the higher value side\nby the lower value. Leg velocity was calculated by dividing peak leg press power by peak force.\n[33] Knee flexion and ankle range of motion (ROM) were measured using a goniometer. [34]\nTrunk extensor muscle endurance was measured with the participant lying prone on a special-\nized plinth positioned 45\u00b0 from vertical using a previously published protocol. [35] Because\nsome participants were unable to complete some of the neuromuscular tests (up to 14%),\nweighted multiple imputation was performed on these data. [36] The Activities-Specific Bal-\nance Confidence Scale is a valid and reliable measure of confidence in performing 16 daily\nactivities without losing balance or becoming unsteady. [37, 38] Scores ranged from 0\u00ad100\nA Novel Approach to Identifying Trajectories of Mobility Change in Older Adults\nwith higher scores indicating higher confidence. The SPPB measured standing balance, usual\npaced walking speed, and 5-repetition chair stand time. Scores ranged from 0\u00ad12 with higher\nscores indicating better performance. Usual gait speed (m/s) was measured over 4 meters. A\nvalidated co-morbidity index measured the presence of 13 common chronic conditions. [39]\nPrevalence of the following individual conditions was also included: heart disease, hyperten-\nsion, lung disease, diabetes, cancer, depression, osteoarthritis, back pain, neurologic disease,\nand peripheral arterial disease. Participants were asked if they had ever been told by a doctor\nor health professional that they had the disease.\nStatistical Analysis\nRecent studies investigating disability among large cohorts of older adults have identified 5\ndistinct trajectories of change. [2, 3] Based on this literature and clinical reasoning, we gener-\nated a five level categorical variable to define persistent states and meaningful change in mobil-\nity for each the BLE and ALE scales of the LLFDI across baseline, year 1, and year 2. The five\ncategories included: persistently poor, decline, persistently intermediate, improvement, and\npersistently high. \"Decline\" and \"improvement\" were defined as a decrease and increase,\nrespectively, !MDC90\nbetween any two time points. If both decline and improvement\noccurred, the amount of change from the first time point to the last was used as the tie breaker.\nWhen no meaningful change occurred, \"persistently poor\" and \"persistently high\" were\ndefined as scores at the final follow-up (year 2 or 1) within the lowest or highest quartiles,\nrespectively. \"Persistently intermediate\" was defined as scores at the last follow-up between the\nhighest and lowest quartiles.\nTo validate the number of trajectories for both LLFDI scales, we performed latent class\ngrowth analysis, and estimated the log Bayes factor using the Bayesian Information Criterion\n(BIC) score with the following equation: 2 x [(BICgreater trajectories model\n)\u00ad(BICfewer trajectories\nmodel\n)]; where a positive score indicates an increase in fit for the model with the greater num-\nber of trajectories and a negative score indicates a decrease in fit. [19, 40] This score is used for\nnested models, and is thus appropriate for testing the inclusion of different numbers of trajec-\ntories within a model. Guidelines for interpreting the extent of evidence provided by the log\nBayes factor for model complexity while accounting for model parsimony are as follows:\n0\u00ad2 = weak evidence; 2\u00ad6 = moderate evidence, 6\u00ad10 = strong evidence, and >10 = very strong\nevidence. [40] We additionally used model convergence to judge fit.\nWe evaluated known-groups validity among the trajectories by testing differences in base-\nline characteristics through three sets of pairwise comparisons: comparisons between the per-\nsistently poor and each of the other trajectories, comparisons between the persistently high\nand each of the other trajectories, and comparisons between the improvement and decline tra-\njectories. Chi-squared, t-tests, and non-parametric equivalents were used with an alpha level of\n0.01, since multiple comparisons were performed. We also performed two separate sensitivity\nanalyses in which we adjusted comparisons for age and sex and tested the differences in neuro-\nmuscular impairments between the trajectories using non-imputed data.\nResults\nWhen validating the number of trajectories generated for ALE mobility, we found positive log\nBayes factor scores indicating an increase in fit for the models with the greater number of tra-\nalthough the model with 5 trajectories did not converge. For BLE mobility, positive log Bayes\nfactor scores indicated an increase in fit for the models with the greater number of trajectories\nA Novel Approach to Identifying Trajectories of Mobility Change in Older Adults\nfactor = 41.2), and 7 vs. 6 trajectories (log Bayes factor = 11.3), although the model with 7 tra-\njectories did not converge.\nMean LLFDI scores for each trajectory at each time point are presented in Fig 1. Table 1\nshows that participants with persistently poor ALE mobility were more likely to have a high\nschool education, and less likely to have had graduate/professional schooling than those in the\nimprovement and high mobility trajectories, although the latter were marginally significant\n(p<0.05). Participants with persistently high ALE mobility had the fewest chronic conditions,\nbest knee flexion ROM and SPPB scores (Table 2), and a lower rate of back pain than those\nrespectively; p<0.01 for both). The persistently poor BLE trajectory had lower cognition scores\n(Table 3), the slowest limb velocity, poorest knee and ankle flexion ROM, the most chronic\nconditions (Table 4), and higher rates of lung problems, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and back pain\nFig 1.

This approach extends\nthe use of trajectory analyses to studies with smaller sample sizes and fewer follow-up time\npoints than previously allowed by traditional statistical approaches. Such findings have the\npotential to promote the investigation of a broader scope of research questions involving tra-\njectory analyses within aging populations of varied sizes and traits.\nModel fit indices showed very strong evidence (log Bayes factor >10) that the optimal num-\nber of trajectories fell between 4 and 6, suggesting our selection of 5 trajectories was appropri-\nate. This number of trajectories is also consistent with the number reported in previous studies\nof disability among large cohorts of older adults. [2, 3] Although we used a clinically intuitive\napproach, we observed similar patterns of mobility change to those previously described using\nadvanced statistical techniques. For example, the decline trajectory described in this analysis,\nis conceptually similar to \"progressive\", \"developing\", [2] or \"accelerated increase\" [3] in dis-\nability trajectories from other studies. However, less often included is an \"improvement\" or\n\"recovery\" trajectory, [41] despite high rates of recovery from disability reported in older\nadults. [42] We found that 25% and 17% of our cohort experienced meaningful improvement\nin BLE and ALE mobility, respectively. It is possible that we were able to detect improvement\nin mobility while others were not due to responsiveness of the LLFDI to improvement, dem-\nonstrated previously within this study population. [28] Categorizing individuals with improve-\nment in mobility is particularly important for research informing interventions since it\nsupports that improvement of mobility is achievable for older adults.\nOverall, we found that participants in the persistently poor mobility trajectories had the\nleast favorable mobility-related baseline characteristics, while participants in the persistently\nhigh mobility trajectories had the most favorable characteristics. This included a number of\npersonal, health-related, body function/impairment, and physical function/activity factors.\nThe improvement and decline in mobility trajectories had more favorable characteristics than\nthe poor mobility trajectories and less favorable characteristics than the high mobility trajecto-\nries; however, the characteristics of the improvement and decline trajectories did not differ\nFig 2. Baseline prevalence of self-reported chronic diseases by BLE mobility trajectory (N = 391). *p<0.01, p<0.001 for\ncomparisons with Persistently High. p<0.01, \u00a7p<0.001 for comparisons with Persistently Poor. BLE = Basic Lower-Extremity\nFunction; OA = Osteoarthritis; PAD = Peripheral Artery Disease.\nA Novel Approach to Identifying Trajectories of Mobility Change in Older Adults\nfrom each other. This may be evidence of contributing factors to change in mobility that were\nnot included in this analysis, such as healthcare leading to improvement in mobility or medical\ncomplications leading to decline.\nThis is the first study to identify mobility trajectories using the LLFDI, a widely used, vali-\ndated measure of mobility, specifically designed to be responsive to change. [26] We previously\nshowed within this cohort, that the LLFDI detected meaningful decline and improvement\ncomparably to performance-based measures such as the SPPB and gait speed. [28] This analy-\nsis extends these results by showing that the LLFDI is able to capture a number of different tra-\njectories of meaningful mobility change over a relatively short time period of 2 years.\nLimitations\nAlthough targeted recruitment within this study resulted in demographic distributions consis-\ntent with the 2004 census for older adults living within the recruitment area, [32] our findings\nmay not be fully generalizable to older adults within other geographical regions. Some partici-\npants were unable to perform some neuromuscular tests resulting in missing data; to address\nthis we performed multiple weighted imputation on these data. [36] Persistently poor and high\nmobility trajectories had modest numbers of participants, which may have resulted in low\npower for some comparisons. Despite this, we found numerous significant differences when\ncomparing these trajectories to others. We only assessed baseline predictors of mobility and\nthe duration of our follow-up was relatively short; however, this may mirror annual wellness\nvisits in which a clinician must target risk factors for mobility decline assessed within a single\ninitial evaluation. Future work should examine the predictive ability of these different trajecto-\nries on key health-related outcomes. Further validation of this approach may be warranted\nusing additional instruments.\nConclusion\nUsing a novel approach designed to overcome constraints of modest sample size and few fol-\nlow-up time points, we identified five trajectories of mobility change within this study of older\nadults. We demonstrated the validity of this approach by using latent class growth analysis to\nconfirm the optimal number of trajectories and by comparing known mobility-related charac-\nteristics between the trajectories. This approach has the potential to extend trajectory analysis\nto a wider variety of studies and populations.\n"
