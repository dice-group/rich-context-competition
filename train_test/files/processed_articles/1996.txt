Notably, the association between\nrace and albuminuria was no longer significant (OR 1.19; 95% CI\nresults were observed when participants with macroalbuminuria\n(ACR 300mg/g) or elevated parathyroid hormone (>74 pg/ml) were\nexcluded or when a continuous measure of 25(OH)D was substituted\nfor the categorical measure.There were no interactions between\nrace and vitamin D status though racial disparity in albuminuria was\nobserved among participants with the highest 25(OH)D levels.\nConclusion\nSuboptimal vitamin D status may contribute to racial disparity in\nalbuminuria. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine\nwhether supplementation with vitamin analogues reduces risk for\nalbuminuria or reduce racial disparity in this outcome.\nKeywords:albuminuria;bloodpressure;healthstatusdisparities;\nhypertension;vitaminD\nAmericanJournalofHypertension, advance online publication 30 June 2011;\nOpen\noriginal contributions\nVitamin D and Disparities in Albuminuria\nsized arm cuffs.20\u00ad22 Readings were taken from participants\nwhile sitting after 5min of rest.

Among untreated participants, BP\nwas classified using the Seventh Joint National Committee\nfor Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of\nHigh BP (JNC-7) guidelines23: normal (systolic BP (SBP) was\nor DBP of 90\u00ad99mmHg), and stage 2 hypertension (SBP of\nantihypertensive drugs were considered to have controlled BP\nif their SBP was <140mmHg and their DBP was <90mmHg.\nVitamin D status. Serum 25(OH)D was measured using a radi-\noimmunoassay kit (DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN). The coefficient\nserum 25(OH)D was adjusted for assay drift using methods\nrecommended by the National Center for Health Statistics.25\nAlthough 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is the biologically active\nform of vitamin D, serum 25(OH)D is regarded as the best\nindicator of vitamin D status in individuals without kidney\ndisease.26 We grouped 25(OH)D into the following categories:\nAlbuminuria. The untimed urinary albumin/creatinine ratio\n(ACR) was classified as normal if ACR <30mg/g, microalbu-\nminuria if ACR is between 30\u00ad299mg/g, and macroalbuminu-\nria if ACR 300mg/g.27 In addition to predicting progression\nof renal disease, albuminuria (both micro and macro) predicts\ncardiovascular disease.28 The definition of ACR was based on\nthe criteria of the National Kidney Foundation.29 The rationale\nfor using ACR of 30mg/g and above is based on evidence that\nmicroalbuminuria is a predictor of cardiovascular disease and\nIn our primary analysis, we combined participants with\nmicro and macroalbuminuria into a single category: albu-\nminuria. In secondary analyses, we focused on microalbu-\nminuria by excluding participants with macroalbuminuria\nfrom the analysis.\nRace. Race and Hispanic ethnicity were assessed by self-report\nand were categorized as white (non-Hispanic) or black (non-\nHispanic). Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, and par-\nticipants who self-identified with more than one race/ethnic\ngroup were not included in this study.\nControl variables. We adjusted for potential confounding by\nincluding variables associated with albuminuria and vitamin D.\nThese include age, sex, smoking, body mass index (BMI), BP,\nand diabetes.31\u00ad36 This represents a conservative approach since\nsome of these variables may be affected by serum 25(OH)D\nlevels.\nAge at screening was grouped into categories of 20\u00ad34,\nstatus was defined as never smoked, current smoker, and\nformer smoker. BMI was determined based on participants\nassessed weight (kg) and height (m) and categorized (<25.0;\nreport of physician diagnosis or current use of medications for\ndiabetes mellitus.\nStatistical analyses. Analyses were conducted with SUDAAN\nadjusting for the complex survey design of NHANES to yield\nappropriate standard errors and population parameter esti-\nmates. We examined the independent association of race with\nalbuminuria (present or not) using logistic regression mod-\nels. We compared the black-white differences in log odds of\nalbuminuria before and after adjustment for 25(OH)D. We\nassessed interactions between 25(OH)D and race and between\n25(OH) D and BMI. We also conducted analyses stratified\nby serum 25(OH)D levels to examine possible differences in\neffects by race. Finally, we conducted several secondary analy-\nses. For this purpose, we repeated our analyses using micro-\nalbuminuria as a dependent variable, and excluding those with\nmacroalbuminuria. We also repeated the analyses excluding\nthose with elevated PTH and also using 25(OH)D as a con-\ntinuous variable.\nThe model was checked for multicollinearity and no prob-\nlem existed (all variance inflation factors <2). Since all of our\nindependent variables are categorical, logit plots for linearity\nassessment were not needed. Independence is assumed due to\nthe strict sampling methodology used by the NHANES group.\nInspection of residuals did not reveal any influential outliers.\nIn addition, a Hosmer\u00adLemeshow Goodness-of-fit 2 statistic\nResults\nOur final sample included 7,651 non-Hispanic blacks and\nnon-Hispanic whites, ages 20 years and older. Rates of miss-\ning data ranged from 0.01% for diabetes to 0.65% for estimated\nglomerular filtration rate. Albuminuria was missing for 3.5%\nof participants. Age, BP, and smoking were independently\nassociated with missing albuminuria data.

As expected, those with\nhypertension, older than 55, less education, obese, diabetes,\nand those with lower serum 25(OH)D levels had higher preva-\nlence of albuminuria.

Based on 2 tests for association.\noriginal contributions Vitamin D and Disparities in Albuminuria\nvitamin D explains the association between race and albu-\nminuria in a national sample of black and white adults. The\nfindings reported in this study confirm our hypothesis that\nvitamin D contributes to the noted racial disparity in albu-\nminuria. Consistent with a previous report,4 we observed\nsignificantly higher prevalence of albuminuria among non-\nHispanic blacks compared with non-Hispanic whites. We\nconfirmed previous risk factors for albuminuria including\nolder age, diabetes, BP, and smoking.31,32 Unexpectedly, the\nassociation of BMI and albuminuria was not statistically sig-\nnificant. This could represent adjustment for factors in the\ncausal path between BMI and albuminuria (e.g., diabetes and\nBP) and/or inadequate statistical power.\nAs reported in a previous study,9 we also observed a graded,\ninverse response between 25(OH)D levels and albuminuria.\nThe lowest levels were associated with the highest prevalence\nof albuminuria. Our findings did not change when partici-\npants with macroalbuminuria or elevated PTH were excluded\nfrom the analyses.\nNotably, when we adjusted for serum 25(OH)D, the rela-\ntionship between race and albuminuria was no longer sta-\ntistically significant. This is consistent with the hypothesis\nthat 25(OH)D may partly mediate the association between\nrace and albuminuria. This finding is broadly consistent\nwith a growing body of evidence suggesting that suboptimal\nvitamin D status is associated with vascular-related condi-\ntions that are more prevalent among blacks. These include\nhypertension,37 diabetic nephropathy,10 peripheral vascular\ndisease,38 kidney disease progressing to renal failure,11 and\ncardiovascular diseases39 and mortality.40\nEndothelial dysfunction represents a possible underlying\nmechanism of the effects of low vitamin D levels on albu-\nminuria. Emerging data suggest that low vitamin D levels are\nassociated with endothelial dysfunction and its correction alle-\nviates this dysfunction.16,41\u00ad44 Albuminuria is associated with\nendothelial dysfunction including impaired vascular func-\ntion.45,46 Intriguingly, blacks have higher rates of endothelial\ndysfunction and small vessel disease than whites.47,48 Thus, it\nis conceivable that suboptimal vitamin D status among blacks\nmight contribute to disparities in vascular-related conditions\nvia endothelial dysfunction as manifested in part through\nalbuminuria.\nAnthropological data suggest an evolutionary link between\nrace and vitamin D consistent with an interaction between\nhealth outcomes, skin color, and latitude offering further\nplausibility for this provocative hypothesis. Vitamin D levels\nin response to ultraviolet (UV) exposure from the sun may\nhave played a pivotal role in the evolution of differences in\nskin pigment that emerged based on continental ancestry.49\nAt low latitudes where UV exposure is high, dark skin pig-\nment from higher concentrations of melanin may protect the\nskin and circulating blood folate.50 As human populations\nmoved north with less intense UV exposure, selection pres-\nsures from vitamin D deficiency resulted in lighter skin pig-\nment. Reductions in UV exposure from northern residence\nand less exposure (more in door activity and greater use of\nsun protection) appear to be associated with rising preva-\nlence of vitamin D deficiency.51 Consistent with the findings\nfrom our study sample, vitamin D levels are lowest among\nThese findings are subject to several important caveats. First,\nbecause our findings are based on cross-sectional data, we can-\nnot determine the temporal relationship between 25(OH)D lev-\nels and albuminuria. A previous study showed that low vitamin\nD levels at baseline predicts progression of kidney disease up\nto 16 years later.11 Such results are conceivable given the rela-\ntive stability of serum 25(OH)D levels over time.53,54 Second,\nwe cannot exclude the potential for confounding; it is possible\nthat vitamin D is simply a marker for other factors associated\nwith albuminuria. However, findings from a small randomized\ncontrolled trial suggest the possibility of a causal relationship,\nsuch that supplementation with the vitamin D analog, parical-\ncitol, reduced albuminuria among persons with chronic kidney\ndisease.44 Third, the use of a single untimed ACR sample may\nunderestimate albumin excretion among blacks (due to higher\ncreatinine excretion).55,56 Thus, use of ACR to assess kidney dis-\nease provides a conservative estimate of this racial disparity. Last,\nalthough we did not observe a statistically significant interaction\nbetween race and 25(OH)D, we observed a statistically signifi-\ncant effect of race and albuminuria only at 25(OH)D levels equal\nto or above 75nmol/l. Whether this represents a chance finding\nor a differential effect by race, it has implications for the extent to\nwhich vitamin D status might contribute to this disparity. There\nis some evidence for vitamin D economy among blacks for bone\nturnover and formation, meaning that blacks maintain bone\nhealth at lower levels of vitamin D.57 Further study is needed to\ndetermine whether this holds for other outcomes. In particular,\ninterventional trials are needed to both confirm a causal role of\nvitamin D status in albuminuria for both whites and blacks and\ndetermine whether there is a threshold effect.\nIn conclusion, vitamin D status may contribute to racial\ndisparity in albuminuria. Randomized controlled trials are\nneeded to determine whether supplementation with vitamin\nanalogues will prevent albuminuria or mitigate racial disparity\nin albuminuria.\nDisclosure:The authors declared no conflict of interest.\n1.
