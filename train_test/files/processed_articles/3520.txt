    "abstract": "Abstract\nA survey of 222 Deaf or hard of hearing college students in an upstate New York university provided a unique opportunity\nto explore possible differences between Deaf students' and hard of hearing students' experiences and risk factors of\npsychological and physical abuse in their intimate relationships. Previous research has indicated that Deaf and hard of\nhearing college students in the aggregate were significantly more likely to experience abuse than were hearing students. A\ncomparison of Deaf students with hard of hearing students revealed that hard of hearing individuals were significantly more\nlikely to experience physical abuse than were Deaf students but not more likely to experience psychological abuse. Findings\nalso revealed that in most cases, traditional risk factors for partner violence (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, living on campus)\nused in hearing college samples were not significant. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.\n",

The small body of existing research on violence\nagainst persons that are Deaf and hard of hearing indicate\nthat prevalence rates of experiencing interpersonal violence\nare more than doubled for Deaf and hard of hearing individu-\nals in college samples and community populations when\ncompared with hearing populations (Anderson, 2010;\nAnderson & Leigh, 2011; Barnett, McKee, Smith, & Pearson,\nDespite the growing literature on the victimization expe-\nriences of Deaf and hard of hearing individuals, these inves-\ntigations have not yet queried whether there are differences\nin experiences of physical and psychological abuse in inti-\nmate relationships between Deaf college students and hard of\nhearing college students. Previous research recommends the\nneed to explore whether risk factors vary between Deaf and\nhard of hearing individuals and suggest that hard of hearing\nindividuals may face a greater risk of victimization than Deaf\nindividuals given that hard of hearing individuals are often\nmembers of mainstream culture and a Deaf subculture\n(Barrow, 2008). In response to this recommendation, the cur-\nrent study extends the literature on intimate partner violence\n(IPV) by providing a more comprehensive investigation of\nabuse by comparing the victimization experiences of Deaf\nand hard of hearing college students and examining whether\nrisk factors for physical and psychological victimization\nvary between Deaf and hard of hearing college students.\nThe question about possible differences arises from the\ndangers inherent in aggregating groups that have similar char-\nacteristics but are not alike in many very important ways.\nDisaggregating Deaf and hard of hearing individuals also\nillustrates the importance for health professionals of avoiding\na \"one size fits all\" approach to addressing interpersonal vio-\nlence in these communities. While Deaf and hard of hearing\nindividuals experience hearing loss, the term deaf (lower case\n\"d\") refers to individuals \"that are medically incapable of\nhearing\" and hard of hearing refers to \"individuals for whom\nthe sense of hearing, although defective, is functional with or\nthe capital \"D\" is to acknowledge the unique cultural identity\n1Rochester Institute of Technology, NY, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLaVerne McQuiller Williams, Department of Criminal justice, Rochester\nEmail: llmgcj@rit.edu\nA Comparison of Deaf College Students'\nand Hard of Hearing College Students'\nExperiences and Risk Factors of\nPsychological and Physical Abuse\nLaVerne McQuiller Williams1 and Judy L.

This includes a strong affiliation to the\nDeaf community and a shared language (American Sign\nLanguage [ASL]; Anderson, Leigh, & Samar, 2011).\nMoreover, language, communication, and culture are radi-\ncally dissimilar for Deaf students and for hard of hearing indi-\nviduals. Individuals who identify with the Deaf culture share a\ncommon language and culture that embodies many subtle\nways of communication beyond the use of ASL. For example,\nDeaf culture shares music, literature, plays, and other means\nof interaction that are by necessity dissimilar from the main-\nHard of hearing individuals may or may not use ASL as\ntheir primary language and ASL may not be used at all. Hard\nof hearing individuals may or may not identify with Deaf\nculture (Kersting, 1997). Research suggests that hard of\nhearing college students evidence some difficulty in feelings\nof belonging to Deaf culture or to the mainstream, and some\nhard of hearing individuals have expressed that they do not\nfeel they belong to either group--Deaf or hearing, and do not\nexperience a culture among hard of hearing individuals\n(Kersting, 1997). Mainstreaming Deaf or hard of hearing stu-\ndents in their primary or high school education may affect\nindividuals' ability to join either group. For example, if a\nhard of hearing individual is mainstreamed early in their edu-\ncation he or she may not learn ASL fluently, if at all, having\ndeveloped other communication strategies.\nUsing a survey instrument with a sample of college stu-\ndents in the northeastern United States, the current study\nsought to compare two forms of dating violence, psychologi-\ncal and physical abuse, between Deaf college students and\nhard of hearing college students. The importance of examin-\ning psychological abuse with physical abuse has been noted\n(Raghavan, Swan, Snow, & Mazure, 2005) and previous\nresearch indicates that psychological abuse often occurs in\nconjunction with other forms of abuse (Aosved & Long,\n2005). Psychological abuse refers to \"words or actions [used]\nto isolate, humiliate, demean or control an intimate partner\"\nlogical abuse may have as great a negative impact on vic-\ntims, if not greater, than physical violence (Adams, Sullivan,\nPhysical and Psychological Abuse in\nU.S. College Populations\nRecent estimates suggest that nearly one third of college stu-\ndents have experienced some form of physical abuse in a dat-\ning relationship (Orcutt, Garcia, & Pickett, 2005; Perry &\nFromuth, 2005). Psychological abuse is more commonly\nreported than physical abuse in college dating relationships\nwith as many as 80% of college students reporting experi-\nencing such abuse (Avant, Swopes, Davis, & Elhai, 2011;\nCercone, Beach, & Arias, 2005; Forke, Myers, Catallozzi, &\nPrevious research has identified several risk factors for\ndating violence. Risk factors for dating violence are variables\nthat are associated with its increased probability, but are not\nnecessarily direct causes (Medeiros & Straus, 2006, p. 4). In\nthe current study, a number of risk factors--gender, living\nalone, living on campus, and race/ethnicity--were included\ndue to prior research with hearing samples that has found a\nrelationship between these variables and victimization.\nRegarding gender, men and women have been found to per-\npetrate and experience abuse while in college. For example in\na review of 15 studies examining female perpetrated physical\nabuse and psychological abuse among college students, in 14\nof the 15 studies, rates for physical abuse ranged from 11.7%\n89.3% for psychological abuse (Williams, Ghandour, & Kub,\nand men, conducted on three college campuses, found more\nthan half of the abusive acts reported, including slapping and\ninsulting, were perpetrated by a partner, and were more likely\nto be physical or emotional violence. More than half of col-\nlege women and more than one fourth of college men had\nbeen victimized in their lifetime. During their college years,\n10.2% of women and 2.8% of men experienced physical\nabuse and 16.2% of women and 5.9% of men reported expe-\nriencing psychological abuse. Cercone et al.'s (2005) study of\ncollege men and women found that women, more than men,\nreported committing physical assault. Other studies suggest\nthat the rates of receiving and inflicting abuse are similar\nPrevious research also suggests that living arrangements\nmay be associated with victimization risk, whereby college\nstudents that live independently and off campus may be more\nvulnerable than those living with others and on campus\n(Forke et al., 2008; Lehrer, Lehrer, Lehrer, & Oyarzun,\n2007). Some research also suggests that race/ethnicity may\nbe associated with the risk of victimization, although studies\nare inconclusive. For example, some research has found\nhigher rates of interpersonal violence among African\nAmericans and Hispanic couples when compared with\nWhites (Caetano, Schafer, & Cunradi, 2001; Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, 2010; Eaton, Dais, Barrios,\nwhile other studies have found no differences across racial/\nPhysical and Psychological Abuse\nAmong Deaf and Hard of Hearing\nCollege Students\nThere are nearly half a million Deaf people in the United\nStates (Mitchell, Young, Bachleda, & Karchmer, 2006).

Using a ran-\ndom sample of more than 1,000 college men and women,\nincluding more than 200 Deaf or hard of hearing students at\na large U.S. northeastern university, it was found that Deaf\nor hard of hearing college students were twice as likely\nto report experiencing psychological abuse and nearly\n2.5 times more likely to report experiencing physical abuse\nat the hands of a partner than were hearing students in the\nStudies of IPV among Deaf or hard of hearing college\nstudents as a group at a predominantly Deaf college in\nWashington, D.C., found psychological abuse to be more\nprevalent (30%) than physical abuse (11%) in their current\nrelationships among the Deaf or hard of hearing men and\nwomen respondents (Mason, 2010). Anderson and Leigh's\nDeaf and hard of hearing undergraduate women students at\nthe same university found psychological abuse to be much\nmore prevalent (more than 90%) than physical abuse and\n50% had been the victim of a physical assault.\nGiven the exploratory nature of this study, the research\nquestions guiding this study are as follows:\nResearch Question 1: Are there differences in experi-\nences of physical and/or psychological victimization\nbetween Deaf college students and hard of hearing col-\nlege students?\nResearch Question 2: Do risk factors for physical and\npsychological victimization vary between Deaf and hard\nof hearing college students?\nMethod\nData Collection\nThe data for this study were collected from college students\nat a university in upstate New York. Forty classes that were\nlimited to Deaf and hard of hearing college students were\nrandomly selected. After receiving approval from the\nInstitutional Review Board at Rochester Institute of\nTechnology (RIT), pen-and-paper questionnaires were dis-\ntributed within those classes to students. A total of 222\nrespondents participated and the response rate was 100%.\nMeasures\nThe dependent variables for analysis were dummy variables\ncreated from a variety of questions pertaining to psychologi-\ncal and physical abuse. To measure psychological and physi-\ncal abuse among dating partners within the past school year,\na modified version of Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, and\nSugarman's (1996) Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2)\nwas used to measure IPV by \"a partner\" over the previous\nschool year. Use of the term partner denotes IPV may exist\namong heterosexual and same-sex partners. The CTS2 is a\ncommonly used measure of IPV that measures the frequency\nwith which respondents had experienced psychological and\nphysical abuse from their dating partners. Three items\nassessed psychological abuse (e.g., insults and threats;\nCronbach's  = .592). Seven items assessed physical abuse\n(e.g., slapping, kicking, choking, and beat up; Cronbach's\nAuditory status is the primary independent variable of\ninterest. Auditory status was measured with the question:\n\"Which best describes your auditory status?\" Students were\nable to answer hard of hearing or Deaf. As discussed in the\nliterature review, gender, living alone, living on campus, and\nrace/ethnicity were included as variables due to prior research\nwith hearing samples that has found a relationship between\nthese variables and victimization. The victimization vari-\nables were dummy variables that indicated the presence or\nabsence of abuse. Binary logistic regression analyses were\nused to examine the effect of auditory status and other vari-\nables on physical and psychological victimization. Data were\nCharacteristics of the Sample\nThe sample of Deaf and hard of hearing students were nearly\npants were hard of hearing.

Although none of the demographic\nindicators were statistically significant and associated with\n4 SAGE Open\neither Deaf or hard of hearing, it is interesting to note that\nmore women were Deaf and more men were hard of hearing.\nWomen were in the majority in the 21 years and older cate-\ngory for both auditory groups (Table 1).\nResults\nPsychological Abuse\nThe most prevalent type of abuse at the hands of a partner\nsample reporting such abuse. Of those experiencing psycho-\nlogical abuse within the past year, 61.7% experienced at least\none incident of abuse 1 to 2 times, while 38.3% experienced\nat least one incident of abuse 3 times or more. When auditory\nstatus is disaggregated, 63.5% (n = 31) of hard of hearing\nstudents and 61.6% (n = 113) of Deaf students reported expe-\nriencing psychological abuse by their partner in the past\nschool year. Table 2 reports the binary regression results for\npsychological abuse using PASW Statistics 18. The binary\nregression analysis includes Deaf, hard of hearing, gender,\nrace, and whether one lived on or off the college campus.\nLiving off campus was the only variable that was statistically\nsignificant and associated with psychological abuse in a\nbinomial regression analysis that included Deaf or hard of\nhearing, residence, gender, and race. Those students who\nlived off campus were at a greater risk of experiencing psy-\nchological abuse than were those students who lived on cam-\nPhysical Abuse\nA significant number of Deaf and hard of hearing students\nexperienced physical abuse by their partner in the last school\nyear, with 88 students or 39.6% of the sample reporting such\nabuse.

The\nstrongest association in both analyses is for being hard of\nhearing and physical abuse with hard of hearing students\nexperiencing nearly twice the risk of physical abuse than\nDeaf students.\nDiscussion\nFindings from this study were consistent with existing stud-\nies that indicate that among Deaf and hard of hearing college\nstudents, physical abuse and psychological abuse are alarm-\ningly high (Anderson & Leigh, 2011; Porter & McQuiller\ncollege students has historically neglected the experiences of\nmembers of underrepresented groups such as Deaf and hard\nof hearing students, results of this study provide data on\nthese relatively unexamined populations. The current study\nis unique because it is the first to disaggregate the victimiza-\ntion experiences of Deaf and hard of hearing students.\nThe results of this study illustrate the importance for col-\nlege health professionals and others dealing with college\npopulations of avoiding a \"one size fits all\" approach to\naddressing dating violence. A substantially high number of\nhard of hearing and Deaf students reported experiencing psy-\nchological abuse, although in the current study there was not\na significant difference between these groups. For the entire\nsample, with the exception of living off campus, no other\ntraditional risk factors for psychological dating violence\nwere significant. This suggests the need to investigate factors\nother than those relied on with hearing college samples to\nunderstand the dynamics of dating violence victimization\namong Deaf and hard of hearing college students.\nFor physical abuse, a significant difference was found\nbetween hard of hearing and Deaf students, with hard of\nhearing students more likely to experience such abuse.\nBarrow (2008) suggests that because hard of hard hearing\nindividuals are often members of both Deaf culture main-\nstream (hearing) culture, this places them at a greater risk of\nabuse than Deaf individuals. As Anderson et al. (2011)\nacknowledges, within the dynamics of the relationships that\ninclude one hearing partner and a hard of hearing partner,\nthere lays the potential for the hearing partner to abuse their\nhearing privilege. This may include the perpetrator using\ntheir hearing to manipulate the victim (not share with him or\nher what is being said) and/or communicating with police\nofficers and others because they are hearing (Deaf Hope,\n2006). This suggests the need for more directed research,\nincluding qualitative studies, on victimization and factors\nthat contribute to it on college campuses.\nWhen developing interventions to prevent incidences or\nto intervene in cases of relationship violence, it is important\nto understand that hard of hearing students may face differ-\nent issues than Deaf students. Deaf students may have more\nof a support group than hard of hearing students via a shared\nDeaf culture and primary language--ASL (Kersting, 1997).\nHard of hearing students may not use ASL as their primary\nlanguage or at all and may not identify with or be accepted\ninto Deaf culture (Kersting, 1997). Hard of hearing students\ndo not view themselves as a culturally distinct group as do\nmany of the Deaf students and may find acceptance into\nhearing groups difficult as well (Kersting, 1997). More\nknowledge is needed about the cultural assimilation and\nidentification of hard of hearing students as well as their\nexperiences with abuse.\nAmong the traditional risk factors used to examine dating\nviolence in hearing college samples, only gender was signifi-\ncant, with males more likely to experience physical abuse\nthan women. While this finding is consistent with previous\nresearch (Cercone et al., 2005), females receive far more\nphysical injuries as a result of dating violence than do males\n(Straus & Ramirez, 2007). Accordingly, future research\nshould examine the injuries sustained in violent dating\nsituations.\nAlthough the current study extends research on IPV in\nunderrepresented groups, findings should be viewed with\ncaution in light of several limitations. First, data were\nobtained by self-report. Thus, the possibility of deliberate\nresponse distortion must be considered. Second, present\nfindings may not generalize beyond the particular sample.\nTable 3. Physical Abuse.\nVariables B SE Wald df p Exp(B)\nLower Upper\nNote. CI = confidence interval.\n6 SAGE Open\nWe note our sample consisted of a small number of Deaf and\nhard of hearing college men and women attending a mid-\nsized, private institution who may differ from other groups in\ntheir experiences of received psychological and physical\nabuse. The study does, however, provide evidence for future\ncomparisons. Future studies would benefit from a multi-\ncampus approach. A study that looks at multiple universities\nor colleges could help in removing any biases inherent in one\nuniversity or college.\nAdditional research on partner violence among underrep-\nresented groups is clearly warranted. Substantiation of the\npresent findings, which indicate that partner abuse occurs\nwith frequency among Deaf and hard of hearing college stu-\ndents, that hard of hearing students have significantly higher\nrates of physical abuse, and that most traditional risk factors\nfor dating violence among hearing college samples are not\nsignificant when examined for Deaf and hard of hearing stu-\ndents, is crucial for the dissemination of educational infor-\nmation. When developing programs and services, college\nhealth professionals must strive for inclusivity, as well as\ndevelop targeted approaches for outreach to populations on\ntheir campuses that may be at greater risk of abuse.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdams, A.
