We aim to examine the effect of Metabolic syndrome (MetS) on heart attack and overall mortality in\nMexican-American elderly persons over 7-year follow-up.\nMethods. We studied 3050 Mexican Americans aged 65 or older from the Hispanic Established Population for the\nEpidemiological   conducted in five Southwestern states of the United States. Participants were\ncategorized into two groups: those with or without MetS. A total of 333 (11%) respondents at baseline had met the criteria\nof MetS (at least three of five characteristics--hyperinsulinemia or fasting plasma glucose 110 mg/dl, abdominal\nobesity, and hypertension--as defined by the World Health Organization).\nResults. Of 333 participants with MetS, the mean age was 71.1 years and 68% were females (compared with 73.2 years\nand 56% in those without MetS). Eighty percent of participants with MetS rated their health as fair or poor, compared to\n55% of those participants without MetS. Fifty-four percent and 65% of patients with MetS had arthritis and at least one\nimpairment in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), compared to 39% and 55% of those participants without\nMetS. MetS was significantly associated with increased incidence of heart attack (odds ratio: 2.75, 95% confidence\ninterval: 1.67\u00ad4.54) and was a significant predictor for overall mortality (hazard ratio: 1.46, 95% confidence interval:\n1.16\u00ad1.84) over a 7-year period after adjusting for other demographic and clinical variables.\nConclusions. Among Mexican-American elderly participants, those with MetS had poorer self-rated health. MetS was\nsignificantly associated with increased incidence of heart attack and higher mortality over a 7-year period.\nMETABOLIC syndrome (MetS) is a concurrence of\nimpaired glucose and insulin metabolism, overweight\nand abdominal fat accumulation, mild dyslipidemia, and\nhypertension (1). It is extremely common, particularly in\nolder individuals and in Mexican Americans (2). This\nsyndrome is important because of its association with\nsubsequent development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (3),\nand cardiovascular diseases (4\u00ad6), and because of its\nassociation with increased mortality from cardiovascular\ndisease and all causes (7). Alone, each component of the\ncluster conveys increased cardiovascular risk, but in\ncombination they become a more powerful threat to health\n(8). MetS is on the rise world-wide because of the obesity\nepidemic and sedentary lifestyles (9).\nMetS is characterized by insulin resistance and is also\nknown as Insulin Resistance Syndrome (IRS) (1,3,10), and\nSyndrome X (11). The IRS is a condition characterized by\ndecreased tissue sensitivity to the action of insulin, leading\nto a compensatory increase in insulin secretion (12). It is\ncharacterized by the clinical characteristics of hypertension,\nabdominal obesity, high triglyceride levels, and low HDL\nlevels (11,13). Family history of Type 2 diabetes is another\nclinical factor that may also increase the risk for insulin\nThe pathogenesis of this syndrome is still unclear,\nalthough environmental factors such as diet and physical\nactivity, coupled with still largely unknown genetic factors,\ntance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake seems to modify\nbiochemical responses in a way that predispose to metabolic\nThe prevalence of MetS, as defined by the Adult\nTreatment Panel (ATP III) in the United States, was es-\ntimated to be 22% among U.S. adults (17) and it increases\nrapidly with advancing age (2,6). By age 70, the incidence\nof metabolic disorders reaches epidemic proportions\n(13,15). The overall prevalence of MetS is lower in black\nmen than in white or Mexican-American men, and is higher\nin Mexican-American women than in white or black women\n(2,6). Epidemiological studies confirmed that MetS occurs\ncommonly in a wide variety of ethnic groups including\nEuropeans, African Americans, Native Americans, Mexican\nAmericans, Asian Indians and Chinese, Australian Aborig-\nines, Polynesians, and Micronesians (11,18).\nJournal of Gerontology: MEDICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America\nDespite a substantial amount of research, definitions of\nthe MetS and the various cutoffs for its components have\nvaried widely (4,11). The recently released Third Report of\nthe National Cholesterol Education Program Expert panel\non Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood\nCholesterol in Adults draws attention to the importance of\nthe MetS and provides a working definition of this\nsyndrome for the first time (19). Furthermore, the World\nHealth Organization (WHO) consultation for the classifica-\ntion of diabetes and its complications (20) and the National\nCholesterol Education Program (NCEP) expert panel (19)\nhave recently published the definitions of MetS.\nDespite high prevalence of MetS, little is known about\nother factors associated with it in older populations. A\nvariety of factors, including concomitant illnesses, general\nhealth status, and socioeconomic factors, may influence\ntreatment decisions (19). We use cross-sectional data at\nbaseline and 7-year follow-up data to examine the impact\nof MetS on heart attack incidence and overall mortality,\nand to determine demographic and clinical characteristics\nassociated with MetS in community-dwelling older\nMexican Americans.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population Sample\nThe Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemio-\nlogical   is a population-based study of\nnon-institutionalized Mexican Americans aged 65 or older\nfrom five Southwestern states (Texas, California, New\nMexico, Colorado, and Arizona). Participants were selected\nby using area probability sampling procedures that involved\nselection of counties and households within selected cen-\nsus tracts. Census tracts were selected with probabilities\nproportional to the number of Mexican-American elderly\npersons. These were the primary sampling units. Three\nthousand fifty Mexican-American elderly persons (repre-\nsenting an 83% response rate) were interviewed in either\nSpanish or English, depending on their preference. Of these,\nwere interviewed by proxy. In most cases, the proxy was\na close family member. Baseline interviews were obtained\nand interview process can be found in our previous\nMeasures\nThe MetS is defined as presence of either hyper-\ninsulinemia (upper quartile of the nondiabetic population)\nleast two of the following: 1) abdominal obesity (waist\ncircumference of .102 cm for men and .88 cm for women\nor body mass index  30), 2) dyslipidemia (serum\ntriglyceride  150 mg/dl or HDL cholesterol , 35 mg/\ntreated with medication). In our study, a participant was\nconsidered to have MetS if he or she had diabetes,\nhypertension, and abdominal obesity. Serum lipids, which\nare the other two criteria of the five characteristics of MetS,\nwere not taken into account in this population. Diabetes was\ndetermined by asking participants if they had ever been\ndiagnosed with diabetes by a doctor. Blood pressure level\nand abdominal measurement were taken and recorded by the\ninterviewer at the time of the interview. A respondent was\ncategorized as obese if he or she had a waist circumference\nSociodemographic factors included age, sex, marital\nstatus (married or not married), years of education, living\narrangements, and health insurance coverage. Living\narrangements were determined by asking respondents if\nthey lived alone or with others. Respondents were also\nasked if they had health insurance coverage (including\nprivate, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits). Participants were\nthen classified as having or not having any coverage.\nHealth-related factors assessed at baseline included\nsmoking status, alcohol consumption, self-rated health\n(excellent, good, fair, or poor), family history of diabetes,\nduration of diabetes and hypertension, treatment received\nfor hypertension, previous heart attack, stroke, hip fracture,\nand arthritis. Smoking status was measured by asking\nrespondents if they were current/former smokers or never\nsmoked. The number of cigarettes smoked per day was also\ncomputed. Alcohol consumption was measured based on\ncurrent frequency and volume of consumption of beer, wine,\nor liquor during the month prior to the interview. The\nnumber of cans/bottles of beer, the number of glasses of\nwine, and the number of alcoholic drinks consumed in the\npast month were computed. Respondents who reported\na diagnosis of diabetes were also asked if they had a family\nhistory of diabetes (categorized as none/unknown and one/\nboth parents). Duration of diabetes and/or hypertension was\ncategorized as ,10 years or 10 years. Treatment received\nfor hypertension was categorized as none, with medication,\nor unknown. Other medical conditions were assessed by\nasking respondents if they had ever been told by a doctor\nthat they had a previous history of heart attack, stroke, hip\nfracture, or arthritis. The number of hospitalizations and\nnumber of doctor's visits in the year prior to the baseline\ninterview were also recorded. Physical function was\nmeasured using a modified version of the Katz Activities\nof Daily Living (ADL) scale (25). The Instrumental\nActivities of Daily Living (IADL) items were measured\nfrom the modified Rosow\u00adBreslau scale of mobility\nfunction (26). Procedures used to collect information for\nparticipants in the Hispanic Established Population for the\nEpidemiological   were provided in\nprevious publications (21,22). Causes of deaths among\ndeceased participants were determined from family mem-\nbers and a mortality search performed using the National\nDeath Index.\nData Analysis\nThe percentages in Tables 1 and 2 were adjusted for\nsampling weights and design effects to minimize any\nclustering bias in our estimates using the SUDAAN program\n(27). Logistic regression analyses and Cox proportional\nhazards regression analyses were performed using the SAS\nprogram (28). Logistic regression analyses (Table 3) were\nused to assess the risk (odds ratio) of having a new heart\nattack over the 7-year follow-up. Cox proportional hazards\nregression analysis (Table 4) was used to estimate the risk of\nmortality over the 7-year follow-up for people reporting\nheart attack with and without presence of other risk factors.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents the sociodemographic characteristics of\nparticipants with and without MetS. Of the 3050 participants\nat baseline, 333 (11%) reported having at least three\ncharacteristics of MetS.\nParticipants with MetS had a mean age of 71.1 years\ncompared with 73.2 years for participants without MetS\nwith MetS were females, compared with 56% of those\nwithout MetS (p \u00bc .001).

The prevalence of\nMetS in this population was 11%; this group was\nsignificantly associated with increased risk of heart attack\nand mortality over 7-year follow-up.\nMetS is a widespread problem among U.S. adults, and the\nprevalence rates are highly variable among ethnicities, ages,\nbody mass indexes, and lifestyle factors such as smoking\nstatus, physical activity, and dietary caloric intake (6). For\nexample, studies based on the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) reported by Park and\ncolleagues (6) found that 27.2% of Mexican-American\nfemales had MetS, followed by black women and white\nwomen. Ford and colleagues (17) found that 31.9% of\nMexican-American adults have MetS. In both studies (6,17),\nthe age range was between 20 and 74 years; however, in our\nstudy, age range was reported between 65 and 99 years.\nAlthough lower educational level was not statistically\nassociated with MetS in our study, it is an important factor\nfor weight reduction and exercise program (6,17). One study\nreported that U.S. blacks with a lower educational level\nwere more likely to engage in less physical activity during\nleisure time than were whites (29).\nThe waist circumference measure is a simple and useful\ntool for identifying patients who are susceptible to MetS\n(30). Waist circumference measure was one of the tools used\nin our study to measure abdominal obesity for the MetS\ndefinition. Eighty percent of Mexican-American elderly\nparticipants with MetS had poorer self-rated health. Also,\ngreater percentages of participants with MetS were hospi-\nthe year before the interview compared with the participants\nwithout MetS. Current smoking was not found to occur\nmore frequently among the participants with MetS, whereas\nother studies (6,31) reported an association between\nsmoking and MetS. Family history of diabetes was found\nto be statistically significantly higher in those participants\nAt 7-year follow-up, 13% of participants with MetS had\nCI: 1.67\u00ad4.54) was a predicting factor for heart attack in this\npopulation. MetS was also a significant predictor for\nmortality over the 7-year follow-up, after adjusting for\nother demographic and clinical variables (hazard ratio: 1.46,\ntion has been found to be associated with lower cardiovas-\ncular risk, possibly through beneficial alterations in HDL\ncholesterol and blood pressure (32).\nThe importance of MetS from a clinical and public health\nperspective may be greatest in its predictive value for\ncardiovascular disease or diabetes (1) and the serious\nimplications for the U.S. health care cost (17). All five\ncomponents of MetS can be easily evaluated in the clinical\nsetting (6). Knowledge of the impact of MetS, according to\nthe standard definitions of cardiovascular and overall\nmortality in the general population, is crucial for developing\npublic health policy and clinical guidelines for its preven-\ntion and treatment (1). Therefore, an important aspect\nof identifying features of MetS in Mexican-American\nelderly persons is to recognize this risk and to initiate\nearly and appropriate treatment to minimize the risk of\ncardiovascular diseases.\nThere were several limitations in this study. First, we\nmainly used self-reported data from older Mexican\nAmericans with no clinical evaluations. However, the self-\nreported approach is a commonly used methodology in\nepidemiological research (33) and has been generally\ndocumented to provide reasonable information on de-\nmographic and health-related problems including heart\nattack (33\u00ad35). Second, we did not have laboratory-based\ninformation on triglyceride and/or HDL cholesterol levels,\nwhich are the other two criteria of the five characteristics of\nMetS. Although the diagnosis of this syndrome can be made\nif any three of the five characteristics are met (20,23,24), our\nestimate of MetS without these two characteristics is\nunderascertained. Finally, the study findings from this\nMexican-American sample may not be generalizable to\nother populations because we used only a subgroup of the\noriginal sample.\nConclusion\nEleven percent of Mexican-American elderly persons had\nMetS, which was significantly associated with increased risk\nof heart attack and mortality over the 7-year follow-up.\nPrevention, better control of diabetes and high blood\npressure, and programs for exercise and weight reduction\nseem important to improve health and to reduce mortality.\n"
