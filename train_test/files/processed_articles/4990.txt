    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this article we examine whether the proposal to criminalize illegal stay in the Netherlands was\npreceded by increased negative media attention for unauthorized immigrants. Using a corpus\nlinguistics approach, we carried out a quantitative discourse analysis of all newspaper articles on\nunauthorized migrants over a period of 15 years. Our results show that the amount of media\ncoverage actually strongly decreased in the years before the proposal, and this coverage was\nmoreover increasingly less negative. This study thus nuances the somewhat popular belief that\nunauthorized migrants are increasingly portrayed in negative ways and shows that the framing\nof migrants as criminals is a more diffuse process in which the media seem to follow rather than\nfuel politics and policy.\n",

As negative sentiments towards immigrants have come to dominate the\npolitical and public discourses, increasingly stricter and more repressive responses to \u00ad\nmostly unauthorized \u00ad migratory acts have been adopted, including the resort to criminal\ndevelopments fit into the broader trend of crimmigration, a term that was first introduced\nby Juliet Stumpf (2006) to refer to the convergence of criminal law and immigration law\nand has attracted considerable interest from primarily Anglo-Saxon legal scholars\nscholars have only more recently started to adopt the crimmigration terminology, thereby\nidentifying the need for a broader definition that encompasses crime control and migra-\ntion control, in this way allowing for the inclusion of social practices, discourses, percep-\ntions and framing in research (Aas, 2011; Van der Leun and Van der Woude 2012; Van\nder Woude, et al., 2014). This would also enable more empirical research and make\ncomparative studies possible \u00ad something lacking in the primarily legal-oriented scholar-\nship in this field so far.\nWithin the European context, the Netherlands has been identified as a particularly\ninteresting country in which to study the crimmigration process because of its pioneering\nrole in the adoption of restrictive migrant policies and the strong anti-migration dis-\ncourse surrounding these policies (Aarts and Semetko, 2003; Lesisnka, 2014; Mutsaers,\n2014; Vliegenthart and Boomgaarden, 2007). Over the past two decades a large number\nof policy measures have been implemented to deter, exclude and remove unauthorized\nmigrants in particular, policies that increasingly focus on detection, detention and depor-\nder Woude, 2012; Van Liempt, 2007). Whereas immigration and integration issues did\nnot receive widespread attention from the Dutch media and public in the 1990s, a stark\n2007). De jure criminalization has stepped up since 2000, with a strong increase in the\nnumber of undesirable migrant resolutions per year and a lower threshold for being crim-\ninally liable with the national implementation of the EU returns directive (Leerkes and\nThese developments recently came to a symbolic conclusion when the government\nintroduced a bill that would lead to the formal criminalization of illegal stay, the quintes-\nsential step in the crimmigration process and `the provisional culmination of twenty\nyears of stepping up against illegal residence with criminal legislation' (Van der Woude\net al., 2014: 569). Following serious debates, the bill was eventually withdrawn in the\nspring of 2014. The Liberal Party, the main sponsor of the bill, agreed to this withdrawal\nin return for a set of tax reforms. Although previous governments also discussed formal\ncriminalization, it was never so seriously considered, thus raising the question of why\nthis government deemed it necessary and achievable.\nVarious authors have stated that the media play a central role in the construction of\nmigrants as deviant and criminal, shaping public views and thereby justifying the appli-\ncation of criminal justice responses to unauthorized migration (Gerard and Pickering,\nit has been argued that discursively constructing certain immigrant groups as criminal in\nthe media serves to legitimize the development of crimmigration legislation (Kinney,\nclaim is largely lacking though, making the Dutch bill that criminalized illegal stay a\nvaluable case study. In this article we therefore examine whether media representations\nof unauthorized migrants have been a driving factor behind the proposed criminalization\nof illegal stay in the Netherlands. Drawing on theories of agenda-setting, framing and\nmoral panics, we hypothesize that the increasingly repressive policies towards unauthor-\nized migrants in the Netherlands should be preceded by growing attention for this group\nin the Dutch media, including increasingly negative representations. In particular, we\nexpect newspapers to systematically and increasingly link unauthorized migrants to\nissues of crime. Because this hypothesis is hard to test through the often used qualitative\napproaches towards discourse analyses, we have carried out an innovative computer-\naided quantitative discourse analysis of all articles on unauthorized migrants that\nappeared in Dutch national newspapers between 1999 and 2013, which does allow for an\nempirical test of this crucial hypothesis.\nAgenda-setting, framing and moral panics: Why media\nrepresentations matter\nCrimmigration legislation does not arise in a vacuum, but is the result of inter-relational\ndiscursive processes in which migrants are constructed as social threats. The social\nconstruction of the migratory threat essentially rests on reinforcing interactions between\npolitical, public and media discourses, with direct causal relationships within this trian-\ngle being generally quite difficult to establish (Duffy and Frere-Smith, 2014). The mass\nmedia are assigned a central position in these processes, through the selection of topics\nand issues and through processes of labelling and attributing qualities to groups and\nindividuals, and inferring causes and meaning (Helbling, 2013; Maneri and ter Wal,\n2005). The organization and selection of topics relates to the agenda-setting theory,\nwhich suggests that, by paying considerable attention to certain issues, the media have\nthe ability to influence what people think about and as such can set the public's agenda\nrelated to processes of labelling and attribution, is the concept of framing (Goffman,\n1974): it is not only relevant what issues the media write about, it is equally important\nhow they write about these topics (Boomgaarden and Vliegenthart, 2009). According to\nEntman (1993: 52), this means to `select some aspects of a perceived reality and make\nthem more salient in a communicating context', which can be identified through `the\npresence or absence of certain keywords, stock phrases, stereotyped images, sources of\ninformation and sentences that provide thematically reinforcing clusters of facts or\njudgments'.\nCaviedes (2015: 900) has argued that `the more often the press mentions a particular\nissue and links it to a social ill, the more likely that issue is to be considered a \"crisis\"\nmeriting political action and resolution'. This resonates closely with Cohen's (1972: 9)\nconcept of moral panics, which entails that a `condition, episode, person or group of\npersons emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests'. A defin-\ning characteristic of moral panics is that the concern itself and the actions taken are\nhighly disproportionate; they exaggerate concerns when the actual threat itself does not\njustify criminalization or the curtailing of rights (Goode and Ben-Yehuda, 2009; Hall\net al., 1978). The concept has previously been used to explain the criminalization of\nillegal stay in Italy (Maneri, 2011), the criminalization of immigration in post-9/11\nUnited States (Hauptman, 2013), the criminalization of asylum seekers in the United\nKingdom and the United States (Welch and Schuster, 2005; Welch, 2004) and crimmi-\ngration processes in Australia (Welch, 2012).\nTerminology\nDescribing unauthorized immigrants as criminals can happen in direct ways, but more\nsubtle forms are apparent too. In this regard, considerable attention has been drawn to the\nuse of the term `illegal', which is criticized not only because it `stresses criminality' and\n`defines immigrants as criminals' (Lakoff and Ferguson, 2006: 1), but also for being\ninaccurate: although a migratory act might be illegal, people themselves cannot be ille-\ngal. Moreover, it does not do justice to the complex question of legal and illegal stay,\nwhich includes numerous `in-between' situations described as `semi-compliance'\negories\" that lack any descriptive coherence or precision, but are nevertheless replete\nwith connotations and implicit associations'. Many academics, human rights organiza-\ntions and EU institutions, but also various international news associations,1 therefore use\nterms that are perceived to be more neutral, most notably `irregular'and `undocumented',\nalthough some academics also explicitly use the term `illegal migrant'in order to empha-\nsize the role of the state in creating processes that render individuals illegal (Schuster,\nthe term `illegalized'. Others also defend use of the term `illegal' for being clear and\naccurate, arguing that the alternatives are merely politically correct euphemisms.2 The\ndebate surrounding terminology has taken on a distinct political character, perhaps most\nnotably in the United States, where liberal and conservative advocates have both sought\nto get their terminological frames to dominate in the media (Merolla et al., 2013). The\npreferred word choice then roughly reflects whether someone is in favour of a more\nrestrictive approach or a more rights-based approach. For example, Anderson and Ruhs\n(2010: 175) argue that `\"illegality\" is also the term that is often used by those elements\nof the mass media that promote and reinforce negative public attitudes to immigration,\nand illegal immigration in particular'.3\nMethodology\nIn general there is no lack of scholarly attention for the representations of migrants and\nother minorities in Western media, although Thorbjornsrud (2015) notes that the num-\nber of studies that focus specifically on unauthorized immigrants is relatively small.\nMost of this research has been more or less a critique of the media, focusing on negative\ndepictions of immigrants and minorities that demonstrate an underlying structural bias\nin the media \u00ad or even society at large (Bleich et al., 2015a). Many of these studies have\nadopted a qualitative approach and often focused on a relatively short time period or a\nsingle event, analysing only a small number of texts (Sciortino and Colombo, 2004).\nBecause a large number of these researchers also take an explicit stand, such studies\nhave sometimes been criticized for lacking representativeness and being subject to\n`cherry-picking', where researchers select only those articles that confirm their existing\nStubbs, 1994). Several more recent studies have therefore employed more systematic\nand comparative methods, resulting in various articles demonstrating the complexity of\nimmigration coverage and challenging the idea that the media are intrinsically biased\nand consistently engage in negative framing of immigrants and minorities (Bleich et al.,\n2015). Yet, despite these important methodological advances, none of these studies\nemploys what we believe to be one of the most promising approaches towards media\nanalyses: a corpus linguistics approach.\nCorpus linguistics (CL) refers to the study of (often very large bodies of) real-life\ntextual data (the corpus) with the aid of computer software (Baker, 2006; Mautner, 2009;\nMcEnery and Wilson, 1996). Corpora are large, representative (or even comprehensive)\nbodies of naturally occurring language, and, because they are stored electronically, it\nbecomes possible to carry out statistical analyses that can reveal \u00ad possibly counter-\nintuitive \u00ad linguistic patterns and frequency information (Baker, 2006). Until now, cor-\npus techniques have only rarely been used for discourse analyses, although the advantages\nof using CL in media studies have repeatedly been demonstrated (Allen and Blinder,\n2004; Mautner, 2009). One of these advantages is the fact that a researcher can work with\nvery large amounts of data, which is particularly interesting when studying media con-\ntent: as Fairclough (1989: 54) has rightly argued, `a single text on its own is quite insig-\nnificant: the effects of media power are cumulative, working through the repetition of\nparticular ways of handling causality and agency'. Computer-assisted analyses of big\ndata sets also greatly reduce a researcher's bias and increase the internal validity of a\nstudy, by employing a comprehensive rather than a selective approach (Baker, 2006;\nbetween manual and automated analyses is far from clear-cut, with computers amplify-\ning rather than replacing human work (see also Grimmer and Stewart, 2013). But,\nalthough much still depends on the individual researcher's choices and his/her interpreta-\ntion of the findings, `it becomes less easy to be selective about a single newspaper article\nwhen we are looking at hundreds of articles' (Baker, 2006: 12).\nFor the current study we used the software program `Wordsmith Tools'to carry out four\ntypes of analysis. First, frequency lists are one of the most basic applications but a good\nstarting point for the analysis of a corpus (Baker, 2006). They reveal the most frequently\noccurring words in a corpus, or show how often specific words appear. Through the analy-\nsis of collocates a more discursive analysis of the way immigrants are described becomes\npossible on a quantitative level. Collocates are words that appear near another word more\noften than could be expected by chance only (Blinder and Allen, 2015), and thus they pro-\nvide `a way of understanding meanings and associations between words which are other-\nwise difficult to ascertain from a small-scale analysis of a single text' (Baker, 2006: 96).\nWordsmith Tools can identify statistically significant collocates, based on their co-occur-\nrence, the relative frequency of both words in the corpus and the full size of the corpus.\nFollowing previous studies, we used a window of 10 words for our analysis, 5 to the left\nand 5 to the right, using both log likelihood (LL, required minimum score of 6.63) and\nmutual information (MI, required minimum score of 5.0) to test for statistical significance\nand strength of the relationship between two words (Allen and Blinder, 2013; Baker et al.,\nword that appears directly before the keyword, because this will often be an adjective\ndirectly describing the word of interest (Blinder and Allen, 2015). Following Gabrielatos\nand Baker (2008), we also use the notion of consistent collocates (c-collocates) for words\nthat are collocates in at least two-thirds of the annual sub-corpora. The results of a colloca-\ntion analysis go further than a mere content analysis, providing `the most salient and obvi-\nous lexical patterns surrounding a subject, from which a number of discourses can be\nobtained' (Baker, 2006: 114). Keyness allows the researcher to compare two data sets and\nsee which words occur significantly more often in one of them, making it a particularly\nvaluable tool for comparisons. Finally, Concordances combine quantitative and qualitative\nmethods of content analysis. Baker (2006: 71) describes concordances as `simply a list of\nall of the occurrences of a particular search term in a corpus, presented within the context\nthat they occur in'. This context usually means a number of words, to be decided by the\nresearcher, to the left and the right of a search term \u00ad for example, `illegal migrants'.\nConcordance analyses thus allow for a closer and more in-depth examination and manual\nreading of a selection of relevant articles, and can act as a bridge towards an informed criti-\ncal discourse analysis of a smaller number of relevant articles. Here we used it mainly to\nprovide a `vital validity check' of our quantitative results (Blinder and Allen, 2015: 12).\nThe corpus\nFor this study we have created our own specialized corpus, consisting of all newspaper\nitems on unauthorized migrants that appeared in Dutch national newspapers between 1\nperiod from before the watershed events at the beginning of the century that have been\nidentified as causing a negative change in Dutch public discourse on immigration (Pakes,\ntral' media content.5 We chose newspapers because their archives are readily available\nonline and, although numbers have been declining, newspaper readership is still rela-\ntively high in the Netherlands, with dailies reaching about 70 percent of the population.\nOf the five main newspapers, De Volkskrant, Trouw and NRC Handelsblad are consid-\nered as broadsheets, or `quality newspapers', with the first two being more left-wing and\nNRC Handelsblad liberal-conservative. De Telegraaf has the highest circulation in the\nNetherlands and, together with Algemeen Dagblad, is considered to be a right-wing,\n`popular' newspaper. However, unlike in for example the United Kingdom, the distinc-\ntionbetweentabloidandbroadsheetnewspapersholdsminorrelevanceintheNetherlands:\nthe `popular' newspapers are generally far less populist and sensationalist than, for\nexample, the Sun or the Daily Express (Bakker and Vasterman, 2007; Broersma and\nGraham, 2013). The Dutch media landscape further consists of various free dailies\nmainly distributed on public transport (Metro, Spits, De Pers and Dag, with the latter two\nexisting only briefly) and two conservative Christian newspapers (Nederlands Dagblad\nand Reformatorisch Dagblad). To avoid too much repetition we excluded regional news-\npapers, which, following a number of mergers, often have the same sections on national\nand foreign news as national newspapers.\nBefore starting our analyses we manually read a small random sample of newspaper\narticles. Besides further familiarizing a researcher with its corpus by already pointing\ntowards interesting language patterns that require attention further in the analysis, this\nprocedure can also help either to find specific terms or synonyms that have been missed\nin the original search string or to reveal that a high number of irrelevant articles is found\nwith the search string. The final search string we used was the result of various of these\ntrial and error steps and, although one can never be entirely sure to have captured all\nrelevant articles, we believe that in this way we have created a comprehensive `unauthor-\nized migrants' corpus without a high number of irrelevant articles. Our final corpus con-\nwords.6 All these articles were sorted by publication month and newspaper, allowing us\nto carry out comparisons between newspapers and over time and identify trends.\nResults\nFigure 1 shows the number of articles on unauthorized migrants per annum. Because not\nall newspapers appeared throughout the complete research period \u00ad some went out of\nbusiness, and others started \u00ad and results would therefore be skewed towards years with\nmore newspapers, this figure is based on the five main newspapers only,7 with additional\nchecks confirming that other newspapers showed similar trend lines. Whereas newspa-\nper attention for unauthorized migrants was quite stable until 2006 \u00ad fluctuating only\nslightly each year \u00ad there was a sharp decrease in the number of articles per year during\nthe period 2006\u00ad9, after which attention steadily increased again. However, the annual\nnumber of newspaper articles did not ever reach the same numbers as in the 1999\u00ad2006\nperiod. If we look at the distribution of newspaper articles per month in 2010, November\nand December have by far the most articles. The proposal to criminalize unauthorized\nstay was introduced in October 2010, practically the lowest point of media attention.\nFrequency lists and concordance analyses confirmed that the rise in attention for unau-\nthorized migrants during the last three years of our study is primarily due to the political\nand public controversy over the proposal.\nOne possible reason for the decline in newspaper articles on unauthorized migrants is\nthe enlargement of the European Union with 10 (mainly East European) countries in\n2004, and Bulgaria and Romania in 2007. Overnight this legalized unauthorized immi-\ngrants from those countries and it is one of the most important explanations for the\ndecreasing number of estimated unauthorized migrants in the Netherlands (Van der\nHeijden et al., 2011). At the same time there appears to have been a shift in the public\ndebate, where populist resistance against Islam and immigration has been replaced, or at\nleast supplemented, by a fierce resistance against European integration (Wansink, 2007).\nIt therefore seemed plausible that part of the media attention for unauthorized migrants\nhas shifted to migrants from East European countries \u00ad and that they are no longer referred\nto as unauthorized migrants. But, whereas a LexisNexis analysis indeed showed a much\nhigher number of annual articles about East European migrants since 2004, a content\nanalysis of various nationalities and terms such as `East European' did not show a declin-\ning trend in our corpus \u00ad either absolute or relative. This means that, although there has\nbeen a general increase in newspaper attention on East European migrants, this cannot\nexplain the decrease in articles on unauthorized migrants. Instead, there does not seem to\nbe one, clear explanation for the decline in newspaper attention for unauthorized migrants.\nLooking at the distribution of newspaper articles per month, it becomes immediately\nclear that there are a few spikes in newspaper attention for unauthorized migrants. Closer\nexamination of these months reveals that these can be explained by specific events that\nattracted strong media attention for a brief period of time. In June 2000, most articles are\nabout 58 Chinese migrants who died of suffocation in the back of a truck while on their\nway to the United Kingdom. The high points in February 2004 and September and\nDecember 2006 are primarily due to political controversies surrounding the former\nDutch Minister for Aliens Affairs and Integration Rita Verdonk, who was known for her\ntough stance towards unauthorized migrants. The most recent peak in May 2013 is due\nto serious debates within the governing Labour Party about the proposed criminalization\nof illegal stay. It therefore seems that political debates and developments are the main\ncause of intense media attention on unauthorized migrants. Gabrielatos and Baker (2008:\n18) noted a similar effect in the United Kingdom, where immigrants `were thus function-\nalised as part of a struggle for political hegemony, being discursively constructed as a\npeople who merely constitute the topic of political debate, somewhat dehumanised as an\n\"issue\"'. It is also noteworthy that other high-profile events that involve or could poten-\ntially be linked to unauthorized migrants \u00ad a fire at the airport immigrant detention centre\nthat killed 11 unauthorized migrants, various (international) terrorist attacks \u00ad have not\ncaused the same increase in newspaper articles on unauthorized migrants.\nDiscourse: Terminology\nIn Dutch newspapers, `illegal' is by far the most often used term to refer to unauthorized\nmigrants \u00ad over 95 percent of instances. `Irregular' and `undocumented' are very rarely\nused, and sometimes even in different contexts, such as `irregular rebel groups'.\nMoreover, this finding applies, without exception, to newspapers across the political\nspectrum. Similar figures were recently found in the United States, where. in over 95\npercent of cases newspapers used the term `illegal' (Merolla et al., 2013). If we look at\nthe distribution of cases where the term `illegal' is used, it becomes evident that it is\nmuch more often used as a noun (`illegals') than as an adjective (`illegal migrant' or\n`illegal immigrant'). When `illegal' is used as an adjective, the most common noun is\n`immigrant', followed by `migrant' and `alien'. Instances of `illegal asylum seeker' and\n`illegal refugee' \u00ad legally speaking impossible constructions \u00ad also appear several dozen\ntimes per year. The term `rejected asylum seekers' (`uitgeprocedeerde asielzoekers'),\nwhich does not convey the exact same meaning, is the second most often used term, but\nthe saliency of this term varies widely between years. Use of `illegal' as a noun does\nshow a steady decline throughout the period, both absolutely and relatively, but this can-\nnot be explained by a replacing term. Rather, it seems to be the result of an increasing\nfocus on the condition of `illegality' in later years, as a place in which people can `disap-\npear' or `end up in'.\nA criminal discourse?\nConsidering the fact that `illegals' was the most common way to describe unauthorized\nmigrants, and we were interested in how unauthorized migrants as a group were\ndescribed, we carried out a collocation analysis for this term. Table 1 shows an overview\nof the statistically significant collocates of `illegals', sorted on the L1 position (the posi-\ntion immediately before `illegals') for the period 1999\u00ad2013, without words such as\n`the', `or', `and'.\nThe most important L1 collocate for `illegals' is `white', referring to a group of unau-\nthorized migrants who had long resided in the Netherlands but, owing to the enactment of\nthe 1998 LinkingAct, suddenly lost most of their rights. The word `white'is used here with\nthe connotation of a semi-documented position in society and does not refer to physical\nappearance. The focus on this group is entirely clustered in the initial years, particularly in\nN Word Total Total left Total right L1\n1999. Our results also show that numerical terms are often used to describe `illegals', indi-\ncating that an important characteristic is how many there are. Except for absolute numbers\n(`000', `million', etc.), these include more vague numerical descriptions (`thousands', `tens\nof thousands', even `millions') and group descriptors (`a lot', `groups of'). Vollmer (2011:\n330) noted that `number games' play a crucial role in policy discourses on unauthorized\nmigration throughout the EU, where `higher numbers justify control and enforcement poli-\ncies, whereas lower numbers ease the political landscape'. `Stream' is also a strong L1\ncollocate, which confirms earlier findings that aquatic terms are frequently used in con-\njunction with migratory movements. Tsoukala (2005) argues that these terms have quickly\nbecome standardized in discourses on immigration and create a notion of uncontrollability\nand threat. What is, however, particularly notable for our main hypothesis is that `criminal'\nis one of the most important adjectives used with the term `illegals', showing that one of\nthe most common ways to describe `illegals' is as criminals.\nTrends and developments\nAlthough `criminal' was one of the most important L1 collocates for `illegals', we were\nalso interested in identifying patterns over time. Therefore we tested whether it was a c-col-\nlocate by carrying out collocation analyses for the word `illegals' in each separate year.\nThis showed that `criminal' as an adjective8 scored significant LL scores in all 15 years of\nof the 5.0 requirement). Turning it around, the term `criminals' is a significant c-collocate\nof the adjective `illegal', falling short of the required statistical scores only in 2006 and\n2011. The term `criminals' was also a significant collocate of `illegals' in all years after\nshows that `illegals' often appear in the same sentence as `criminal' and `criminals'.\nBoth `criminal illegals' and `illegal criminals' are thus constructions that can be regu-\nlarly found, demonstrating that in newspaper articles on unauthorized migrants crime is\none of the main topics discussed, and this has been the case throughout the 15 years of\nour corpus. Similar analyses with the terms `asylum seekers', `refugees', `migrants' and\n`immigrants' showed fewer or no references to crime. Although our corpus is not a rep-\nresentative reflection of all newspaper content on these groups \u00ad it contains only news-\npaper articles that also mention unauthorized migrants \u00ad this suggests that, in Dutch\nnewspapers, unauthorized migrants in particular are strongly associated with crime.\nYet, although the adjective `criminal' is a c-collocate of `illegals', a content analysis\nof the phrase `criminal illegals' showed a steady decrease in use of the term between\nFigure 3 shows that, over time, not only did usage of the word `illegal' show a steady\ndecrease, but Dutch newspapers also described unauthorized migrants less often as crim-\ninals. In the last two years of the period studied, only four instances of `criminal illegals'\nper year occurred, of which two did not even refer to the Netherlands. Although some\nother variations appear in the corpus \u00ad especially `criminal aliens', albeit still only one-\nthird of the times `criminal illegals'\u00ad there is no contrary trend visible in the use of these\nterms. Although crime remains an important topic in newspaper articles throughout our\ncorpus, it is far less of an issue in the period around the proposed criminalization of\nillegal stay than it was around 2000, and unauthorized migrants are gradually less often\ndirectly described as criminal.\nDifferences between newspapers\nWhereas there are thus indications of a criminalizing discourse in Dutch newspapers\nregarding unauthorized migrants, we found considerable differences between newspa-\npers, as illustrated by a keyness comparison between the left-wing `quality' newspaper\nDe Volkskrant and the right-wing `popular' De Telegraaf.\nFigure 4 shows how often various crime-related terms appeared per 10,000 words in both\nnewspapers. The words `criminal'and `criminals'appeared three to four times more often in\nDe Telegraaf than in De Volkskrant. Related terms \u00ad `police' and `arrested' \u00ad were also\nFigure 3. Content analyses of the phrase `criminal illegals'.\nFigure 4. Keyness of crime-related terms in De Telegraaf and De Volkskrant.\nfound significantly more often in De Telegraaf, thus lending empirical support to the asser-\ntion that right-wing newspapers more often link unauthorized migrants to issues of crime.\nConclusion and discussion\nIn this study we have analysed 15 years of Dutch newspaper content on unauthorized\nmigrants. Employing a corpus linguistics methodology, we have been able to identify\nvarious patterns in both the frequency of newspaper articles and the discursive ele-\nments of how unauthorized migrants are described, thus testing the hypothesis that\nmedia content fuels the crimmigration process. Our analysis revealed some familiar\nways in which unauthorized migrants are consistently depicted by all Dutch newspa-\npers. The first and foremost is the constant way in which these newspapers refer to\nunauthorized migrants: `illegals', or at best `illegal (im)migrants'. The term `illegal'\nis also consistently used in the Dutch political discourse, and it seems to have rele-\nvance for arguments regarding actual legislation: in the debate about the formal crimi-\nnalization of unauthorized stay at least one politician publicly argued that `it is of\ncourse very strange that something is illegal, but has no punishment to it'.9 At the EU\nlevel there have been attempts to stop use of the term `illegal' and instead employ the\nwords `irregular' and `undocumented'.10 The Platform for International Cooperation\non Undocumented Migrants (PICUM) recently launched a campaign to ban use of the\nterm `illegal migrant', including a leaflet with preferable equivalents in all major\nEuropean languages. For the Dutch language the NGO suggests the terms `mensen\nzonder papieren' and `mensen zonder wettig verblijf' (literally: `people without\npapers' and `people without lawful stay'). These descriptions seem rather long for\neveryday usage and therefore unlikely to become part of popular discourse; although\nthe second option is to some extent an accepted term in Flanders,11 it does not appear\na single time in 15 years of Dutch newspaper articles. Whereas in the United States\nrecent changes in the stylebooks of major media outlets suggest a greater prevalence\nof alternative terms in the near future (Merolla et al., 2013), in the Netherlands there\ndoes not appear to be any meaningful discussion going on about terminology. At the\nsame time, one can wonder if a terminology replacement might not merely lead to\nwhat has been dubbed `the euphemism treadmill' (Pinker, 2007), whereby the replace-\nment terms themselves become offensive over time. Moreover, two recent studies in\nthe United States showed that terminology frames \u00ad `illegal' versus `unauthorized'/\n`irregular'/`undocumented' \u00ad did not influence public opinion regarding the provision\nof certain rights for unauthorized migrants, leading the authors to suggest that it might\nbe more useful for migrant rights activists to focus on actual policies and how they are\nframed, rather than on terminology frames (Knoll et al., 2012; Merolla et al., 2013).\nIn this regard it is interesting to note that the rise in newspaper articles about unau-\nthorized migrants in the last years of our corpus can be solely attributed to the politi-\ncal and public discussion this bill triggered, but newspaper content during this time\nwas not necessarily characterized by the framing of unauthorized migrants as crimi-\nnal. Some concordance analyses even indicate that various newspapers offered a plat-\nform for substantial critique of the proposal, in this way possibly even playing a role\nOne of the findings that stood out in our analysis was that `criminal' was one of the\nmost important collocates of `illegals', providing evidence for a criminal discourse and\na merger of references to migration and crime. Dutch newspaper articles about unauthor-\nized migrants deal significantly often with issues of crime; indeed, it is one of the most\nsalient themes. Needless to say, this is the quintessential discourse on which the crimi-\nnalization of unauthorized migrants rests. Framing unauthorized migrants as criminals,\nin combination with a strong focus on numbers, serves as a powerful catalyst for what\nVollmer (2011: 331) calls `the demonstration of efficient governance', resulting in\nrepressive and punitive policies with an intense focus on control.\nAlthough these findings are a reason for concern, our main hypothesis proved incor-\nrect: media attention for unauthorized migrants strongly decreased after 2006 and news-\npaper articles about crime among unauthorized migrants featured mainly in the first\nyears of our corpus. The proposal to criminalize illegal stay came at practically the low-\nest point of media attention for unauthorized migrants, and seems to have been the result\nof a change in government rather than of active agenda-setting by the media or another\nactor. This provides some modest support for Threadgold's (2009: 1) statement that there\nis `a small but growing body of evidence that political and policy discourse concerning\nimmigration actually fuel the media discourse, which in turn drives policy'. The present\nstudy has clearly demonstrated that the bill to criminalize illegal stay in the Netherlands\nwas not preceded by strong and increasing media attention for criminal illegal migrants.\nRather, the framing of migrants as criminals is a more diffuse process in which the media\nseem to follow rather than fuel politics and policy.\nWhereas the initial years of our corpus support the idea of a moral panic episode\nabout `criminal illegals', this is not something we see in later years. However, we also\nsee that the problem of the `criminal illegal'keeps lingering on and surfacing every now\nand then. In this regard it is interesting to see that Cohen (2002) more recently noted\nthat reactions to asylum seekers do not follow the ordinary temporary moral panic\nmodel, but are subject to continuous negative, excluding and hostile messages. In their\nstudy on UK media reporting around Bulgarian and Romanian EU accession, Mawby\nand Gisby (2009: 48) argue that this model is `now a more accurate way to model a\ncluster of issues, such as immigration in general' and they note that `this open-ended\nform of moral panic has seemingly \"stepping stoned\" its way from asylum seekers to\nimmigrants, to EU enlargement, to general anxieties about crime'. This is relevant,\nbecause although our corpus showed that newspaper articles about unauthorized\nmigrants decreased, articles about migrants from new EU countries actually increased,\nand it is questionable whether the general public is always aware of such distinctions\nwithin the broad category of `foreigners'. If negative attention for unauthorized migrants\nhas merely been replaced by negative attention for foreign EU citizens and other ethnic\nand racial minority groups, and in the public perception these various categories are\nassembled into one homogeneous problematic group of outsiders, the decrease in news-\npaper articles on (criminal) unauthorized migrants will have had hardly any effect on\npublic opinion about this specific group. In light of increasing European integration and\nthe negative backlash this seems to cause in primarily West European countries, it\nwould be worthwhile to examine media content on new European citizens and what this\nmeans for the future of the European project.\nWhile this study provided valuable insights into newspaper reporting on unauthorized\nmigrants in the Netherlands, it simultaneously raised various questions that point to\ninteresting areas for future research. Here we have focused only on print media, but\nanalyses of web-based content could be equally interesting. Furthermore, linking the\nanalysis of media content to a more systematic analysis of the political discourse could\nincrease our understanding of who influences whom. Finally, and most importantly,\nalthough here we have focused on the Netherlands only, we believe the approach we\nhave introduced is particularly suitable for large-scale comparisons and hope to have laid\nthe foundation for future comparative work between various European countries. This\ncould focus on unauthorized migrants, but it would also be particularly worthwhile to\nexamine how newspapers in different European countries have reported on the recent\nrefugee crisis. The corpus linguistics approach allows for quick replications of analyses\nwith large sets of longitudinal data. Because the statistical tests offer easy to compare\noutcomes, it is eminently appropriate for a systematic comparison of discourses in vari-\nous countries.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nNotes\n1.

We use the term `unauthorized migrant' because it is most inclusive of the population we\nrefer to here, and other terms either are too limited in scope (for example, not all unauthorized\nmigrants are undocumented) or seem to reflect a particular political stand or viewpoint. See\nPassel et al. (2004) for some additional discussion.\n4.

For some considerations regarding\nthe selection of the right query terms, see Gabrielatos (2007). We included the term `rejected asy-\nlum seeker'because it is often used interchangeably with unauthorized migrant, at times it simply\noverlaps and in order to see if there were different discourses around different terms.\n5.
