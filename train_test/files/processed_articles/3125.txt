How diseases and symptoms\nare associated with health status is not completely understood.\nObjectives: to \u00aend diseases, symptoms and demographic factors associated with physical and mental health status\nin older Americans.\nMethods: we analysed data from a survey of over 100 000 Medicare bene\u00aeciaries aged 65 and older. We used the\nshort-form 36 physical and mental summary scores as measures of health status. Other data collected included\ndemographic details, symptoms and diagnoses.\nResults: age as a single variable explained 4% of variation in physical health status. Adding other demographic\ninformation and increased disease burden explained variation to 8% and 27% respectively. Together, shortness of\nbreath, back pain, dif\u00aeculty getting in and out of chairs, arthritis of hip or knee, a recent change in health and age\nexplained 54% of variation. All available variables explained 59%. The role of age as an independent factor decreased\nmarkedly after disease and symptoms were considered. Similar factors were associated with lower mental health status,\nbut age was not.\nConclusion: these data suggest that heart and lung disease and back pain are the most important factors affecting the\naverage physical health status of older people. Sex, marital status and race have very little independent effect. Efforts\nto improve average physical health status scores might best be targeted at these conditions rather than demographic\ncharacteristics. Mental health status does not decline with age, and similar factors affect it but to a lesser degree.\n",

Recently, the Centers for Medicare &\nMedicaid Services (CMS) began collecting health status\ndata in order to monitor healthcare outcomes over time\nin different Medicare settings. Healthcare providers,\nmanagers and payers are interested in factors that affect\npopulation health status [2].\nA \u00aerst step in understanding what affects the health\nstatus of the older population is to examine character-\nistics associated with their health status. Analysis of\nbaseline data from the HCFA Health Outcomes Survey\nprovides an opportunity to examine these associations\nin a very large population of older people.\nMethodology\nCMS's Health Outcomes Survey collects information\nfrom Medicare bene\u00aeciaries enrolled in managed care\nplans. CMS randomly selects 1000 people enrolled from\neach of )250 plans. Independent contract vendors\nexecute the survey and collect data. The \u00aerst question-\nnaires were mailed in 1998. Here, we present data from\nthat baseline survey.\nThe survey's health status measure is the short-form\n36 (SF-36), a widely used generic health status question-\nnaire that has been found to be valid for older people [3].\nThe SF-36 asks questions such as: ``Does your health\nlimit you in (speci\u00aec activities)?'', ``How much bodily\npain have you had during the past 4 weeks?'' and ``As\na result of your physical health, have you accomplished\nless than you would like?'' There are also questions about\nmood and mental state such as: ``How much of the time\nduring the past 4 weeks have you felt downhearted\nand blue?''.\nAnswers to these questions are used to compute\ntwo summary scores: the physical component summary\n(PCS) score, used as a measure of general physical health\nstatus, and the mental component summary (MCS), used\nas a measure of general mental health status [4]. Lower\nscores imply lower physical or mental health status.\nAdditional Health Outcomes Survey questions ask\nabout characteristics that have been shown to affect or\nare hypothesized to affect health status. The questions\nwere suggested by an expert panel, based on the experts'\nreview of literature and personal experiences. The\nquestions ask about co-morbidity, such as symptoms\nor diagnosis of heart problems, neurological conditions,\narthritis and cancer. For example, there are questions\nabout chest pain with exertion, shortness of breath\n``when lying down \u00afat'', and ``numbness or loss of\nfeeling in your feet''. These questions generally provide\na scale of possible responses, from `all of the time' to\n`none of the time'. Diagnosis questions ask whether\n``a doctor ever told you that you had . . . angina/a heart\nattack/high blood pressure/cancer/stroke/emphysema/\nasthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/\nCrohn's disease or other in\u00afammatory bowel disease/\nany other condition''. These questions allow yes/no\nresponses. Other questions ask about conditions: for\nexample, urinary incontinence is indicated by a `yes'\nresponse to the query: ``Do you have dif\u00aeculty control-\nling urination?''. Three questions ask about depression\nand sadness.\nAdditional questions seek demographic informa-\ntion (sex, age, education, marital status and household\nincome).\nResponse rate and response validity\naccording to insurance plan records. This was the target\ngroup for our analysis. Among the target group, there\nwho completed the survey.\nBecause we had less con\u00aedence in proxy responses\n[5], we limited this analysis to individuals who had\nanswered the questions themselves. Thus, the sample\nliving individuals aged 065 who completed the ques-\nhad completed the questionnaires suf\u00aeciently for us to\ncalculate SF-36 summary scores. Accuracy of coding\nresponses was evaluated by independent contractors\nwho coded a sample of 2397 survey response forms,\nusing double-coding procedures, and compared the\nresults with the original coding. This showed the original\ncoding of the data to be )99.5% accurate (personal\ncommunication from S. C. Haffer, Centers for Medicare\nAnalyses\nApproach and dependent variables\nWe focused on factors associated with physical and\nmental health status as re\u00afected by the two SF-36\nsummary scores. We expected multiple variables to affect\nthese summary scores, so we used stepwise multiple\nregression as a convenient method for multivariate\nanalysis. The models used either the PCS or the MCS as\nthe dependent variable. Calculations were carried out\nusing SAS software, release 6\u00b112 7 (SAS Institute, Cary,\nIndependent variables\nWe used responses to the additional survey questions as\nindependent variables. We also used the health transition\nquestion, which asks the respondent to rate his or her\nhealth now compared to 1 year ago. This question is\nincluded in the SF-36 form, but is not used for\ncalculating either the PCS or the MCS.\nAnalysis of MCS was identical to that of the PCS\nexcept for the different dependent variables and, because\nmood questions are part of the SF-36 questionnaire\nand are used to compute the MCS, questions about\ndepression and sadness were not used as independent\nvariables.\nSince some respondents did not answer all questions\nand simple regression requires complete response sets,\nregression analyses reported here represent responses\nResults\n74% were high-school graduates.

In the \u00aerst model, we analysed the association\nJ. K. Cooper, T. Kohlmann\nof PCS score with age alone. Only 4% of the variance in\nPCS score was associated with age alone. Next we added\nthe demographic variables income, education, sex, race\nand marital status. These additional variables increased\nthe explained variation to 8%. Next, to estimate the\neffect of disease burden, we added to the model the total\nnumber of medical conditions that the respondent\nindicated he or she had: 27% percent of the variation\nin PCS score was associated with these independent\nvariables. Then, instead of disease burden indicated by\nnumber of conditions, we added the disease diagnoses\nand symptoms. This produced a model R2 of 58%.\nFinally, we added health transition responses: 59% of the\nvariation in PCSs was associated with these independent\nvariables (R2 =0.591). Being short of breath climbing\nstairs was the most associated symptom (Table 3).\nIn a separate regression analysis, `shortness of breath\nclimbing one \u00afight of stairs' was most associated with\n`shortness of breath walking -1 block' (R2 =0.64 in a\nmodel in which total R2 =0.67; Pearson's correlation\n=0.83). We grouped these two variables into a single\nnew variable, `short of breath with exercise'. We de\u00aened\nthis as `yes' if the response to either of the original\nquestions was `some of the time' or more often. We\nanalysed this dichotomous variable using logistic regres-\nsion.

Only about 20% of the variation in MCS could\nbe explained by stepwise regression (R2 =0.208) in this\nmodel. Age and sex were not signi\u00aecantly associated\nwith the MCS. Most of the independent variables con-\nPCS, having a recent negative health transition and back\npain were associated with MCS. However, a slightly\ndifferent group of other clinical problems was also\nassociated with )1% of its variance. These were short-\nness of breath when sitting or resting and chest pain or\npressure with exercise (Table 4).\nThe impact of the other chief variables on the mean\nphysical and mental health status is shown in Table 5.\nDiscussion\nThe physical and mental summary scores reported here\nare scaled based on the general United States population\n[6]. The scaling algorithm adjusts scores so that a score\nof 50 is the same as the mean score of the adult US\npopulation, and each 10-point difference represents one\nstandard deviation. This scaling assists interpretation of\nscores. For example, if a `small clinically signi\u00aecant\ndifference' is arbitrarily de\u00aened as 0.2 standard devi-\nations [7], this effect is re\u00afected as a difference of two\npoints in the scaled SF-36 summary scores.\nPhysical health status declines with age. As expected,\nat 42, the mean PCS for this older population was below\nthe norm for adults of all ages (50) [8]. However, age was\nassociated with only 4% of PCS variance when it was\nused as the only explanatory variable in this population\nof people aged 65 and over. Adding other variables to\nthe model reduced the importance of age. When the data\nwere adjusted for all other variables, the contribution of\nThere was some fall-off in response rate among older\nwhat effect this relative under-representation of the\nmost-old produces. However, we analysed each age\ncategory separately, and the top \u00aeve associations in each\ncategory were the same. `Age' did not reach the level of\n1% association in these limited age groups because there\nwas less age spread\u00d0i.e. respondents in each group are\nnearly the same age. This suggests that for the popu-\nlation we studied who responded, the major associ-\nations are consistent across age groups. We have no\nway of knowing what the associations are among\nnon-respondents, who may be more frail or differ in\nother ways.\nBesides non-response bias, another potential source\nof error is with self-reported diagnoses, even though the\nquestion asks whether ``a doctor ever told you that you\nhad . . .''.\nDisease burden, as measured by number of diagnoses\nacknowledged by respondents, can be useful in explain-\ning or adjusting for health status, but it is not as effect-\nive at explaining variation as speci\u00aec symptoms and\ndiagnoses.\nThe variable `shortness of breath climbing stairs' was\nassociated with the largest share of the variation in PCS\nscores in multivariate analysis. Our further analysis of\nthis variable linked it to the presence of emphysema,\nasthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,\ndif\u00aeculty getting in and out of chairs and the presence\nof heart disease. It is not clear why dif\u00aeculty getting in\nand out of chairs is associated with shortness of breath\nclimbing stairs. It may be a re\u00afection of general frailty, or\nit may be that people with arthritis that causes dif\u00aeculty\ngetting in and out of chairs become deconditioned.\nBack pain is the second most important single\nvariable associated with a lower PCS score. Other studies\nhave implicated back pain as having an important impact\non health status. For example, back pain, arthritis or\nsciatica had the highest negative impact on bodily pain\nTable 3.

In our analysis, the PCS\nscore among those who indicated they had back pain\nthat interfered with their usual daily activities `all the\ntime' was 25.8, re\u00afecting a very low functional status.\nThe MCS for this group was 46.2, also well below the\naverage (Table 5). Overall frailty manifesting as dif\u00aeculty\ngetting in and out of chairs is also a major factor\nassociated with the PCS.\nMental health status does not appear to decline with\nage. At 53, the mean MCS for this population was\nslightly above the national adult norm for all ages.\nThe greatest association was found with shortness of\nbreath while sitting, back pain and chest pain on\nexertion, although these variables contributed relatively\nlittle to MCS. While the MCS was constructed to be\nindependent of physical components, these results\nsuggest that complete separation of physical and\nmental components in SF-36 surveys is dif\u00aecult to\nachieve.\nPerhaps the most intriguing \u00aending in this analysis\nis that demographic factors\u00d0sex, race, education and\nhousehold income\u00d0have little independent effect on\nhealth status as measured by the SF-36. These data\nsuggest that healthcare planners and clinicians should\nfocus interventions on the disease processes that affect\nfunctional status, rather than on the demographic char-\nacteristics of the population served. Pulmonary and\nheart disease and conditions that cause back pain would\nseem to be appropriate targets, at least from a population\nperspective. Individuals who have had a recent decline\nin health also are among those with lower health status\nscores. Urinary incontinence, dif\u00aeculty seeing or hearing,\nTable 5.

SF-36 scores have been respons-\nive to a number of treatment interventions, including\ngeriatric assessment [10], pulmonary surgery and rehab-\nilitation [11], total hip arthroplasty [12] and treatment\nof sleep apnoea [13]. Shortness of breath climbing stairs\nmight be prevented or reduced by preventing or treating\nheart failure, by improved individual physical condition-\ning and by treating arthritis. However, one study of\ntreatment of heart failure showed only little effect on\nSF-36 scores [14]. Obesity has been associated with\nshortness of breath and back pain and low SF-36 scores\n[15], but few programmes have been successful in\nreducing obesity. MCS in large populations may also\nbene\u00aet from improved treatment of cardiovascular\ndisease and back pain\u00d0although, to our knowledge,\nthis has not been tested.\nData such as these should encourage the use of\na systematic approach to improving care for older\npeople, which offers the potential for improved health\nCMS monitors the quality of Medicare-\u00aenanced\nhealthcare, using a number of mechanisms that have\nevolved over time [17]. Measuring health status using\nthe SF-36 provides an opportunity to monitor health-\ncare status in different settings. The SF-36 is a well-\nvalidated instrument that re\u00afects the concepts of\nphysical and mental health [18]. As healthcare quality\nmeasurement evolves, the use of health status measures\nsuch as the SF-36 will probably increase.\nOver 5 million older Americans currently are in\nhealthcare plans that are required to use the SF-36 as\npart of their healthcare quality monitoring by CMS [19].\nCMS is exploring the possible use of the SF-36 to\nestimate the health status of bene\u00aeciaries in traditional\nfee-for-service plans, which would expand its use to\nover 98% of Americans aged 65 and over. Because of\nthe SF-36's widespread use as a health status measure,\nit is important for clinicians and others who manage\nhealthcare to understand the clinical and demographic\nfactors associated with SF-36 scores.\nAddendum\nAfter submitting this manuscript, we had the opportun-\nfrom 1999 survey data.
