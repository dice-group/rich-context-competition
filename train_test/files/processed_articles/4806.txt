    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe body of information on the Internet is becoming increasingly geographical. This is both due to the expansion of\nestablished categories of geographic information (e.g., digital maps and geospatial databases) and to the simultaneous\nenrichment of other types of information through geographic identifiers (e.g., geotags, check-ins, and global positioning\nsystem coordinates). As this repository of geographic information expands, it is also a key site for multiple processes of\ncommodification transforming informational resources into market goods. Understanding the dynamics driving the\nintegration of geographic information into the digital economy requires a comprehensive political economic analysis.\nA key component of this analysis is to explain the logics of creation and allocation of economic value from geographic\ninformation on the Internet. Addressing this need, in the present article I deploy the property regimes schema developed\nby Schlager and Ostrom and expand it to elucidate the differentiated commodification processes of geographic informa-\ntion on the Internet. Property regimes are arrangements that define rules, distribute rights, and delineate roles with\nrespect to particular goods. These arrangements are enabled by elements such as legal frameworks, jurisdictions, type of\ninformation, and technologies of access. In this article, I explore how the legal frameworks regulating traditional\ncategories of geographic information (such as maps) have been destabilized in the process of technological innovation,\nleading to the creation of new informational goods along with their respective property regimes, and rearticulating legal,\neconomic, and sociotechnical relations. To illustrate this, I analyze the case of Google Street View images through their\nproperty regimes in various jurisdictions.\n",

Property regimes are ways of\norganizing diverse bundles of rights with respect to a\nspecific resource. These rights are the product of rules,\nwhich define how they can be allocated to particular\nactors, which in turn creates roles with specific func-\ntions within the property regime.\nA well-defined conceptual schema of property\nregimes can help sharpen the analysis and management\nof resources and their economic exploitation. In this\narticle, I mobilize the schema developed by Schlager\nand Ostrom (1992) and extend it to analyze the com-\nmodification of digital geographic information on the\nInternet. The goal is to produce a more finely grained\nunderstanding of how geographic information is inte-\ngrated into the digital economy. This analysis begins by\nDepartment of Geography, University of California, Los Angeles,\nCorresponding author:\nLuis F Alvarez Leo\n\u00b4n, Department of Geography, University of California,\nEmail: lfalvarez@ucla.edu\nBig Data & Society\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons Non Commercial CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-\nNonCommercial 3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction\nand distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages\n(https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nexploring how the digitization of geographic informa-\ntion has destabilized and reconfigured property regimes\nfrom established informational categories such as maps\nand databases.\nThrough the lens of property regimes, I explore the\ninteractions and configurations between actors, tech-\nnologies, and institutional frameworks that both\nenable and result from the creation of market\ngoods through digitized geographic information.\nFurthermore, by showing the diverse dynamics of com-\nmodification, this article contributes to the necessary\ntask of building a richer political economy of geo-\ngraphic information on the Internet (Elwood and\nbeyond the geotag,'' or transcends the locative aspects\nof geographic information and analyzes its contextual\nelements in greater depth (Crampton et al., 2013).\nBy organizing the allocation of rights over resources,\nproperty regimes also articulate social relations among\nactors. This process is mediated by technologies tai-\nlored to specific types of resources and individual\ngoods. Such technologies are used to grant access to\nand monitor the use of the resource, as well as\nto define, allocate, and regulate the rights specific to\neach particular role. Technology thus plays a key role\nin the allocation of rights to a resource and therefore its\nmanagement, exploitation, and commodification. For\nexample, a fishery will require management technolo-\ngies quite different from digital systems controlling\naccess to copyrighted digital content. New kinds of\nproperty rights management technologies have prolif-\nerated in digital information environments. Some\nexamples of these include anti-piracy digital rights man-\nagement software (DRM), password protection, region\nencoding, and subscription charges, among many\nothers. Following the widespread imperative to extract\nprofit from information, the digital economy is increas-\ningly characterized by the use of rights management\ntechnologies in the context of monetary exchanges.\nHowever, in digital environments, the technologies\nused to access, manage, and commercialize information\noften go unnoticed or appear `natural' to many users.\nIn his discussion of the `disburdenment' of human intel-\nligence from the context of experience, Borgmann\n(2000) cautions that the increasing complexity of med-\niating technologies often obscures the nature of the\nsocial relations they articulate. Building on this insight,\nthe property regimes analysis advanced in this article\ncontributes to a political economy of digital informa-\ntion that tackles the power dynamics, socioeconomic\nrelations, and technological configurations behind an\neconomy of digital information--which, despite its\nphysical expressions (Blanchette, 2011) and infrastruc-\ntural requirements (Blum, 2012), is often abstracted\ninto an immaterial ``cloud'' (Mosco, 2014) and\ncharacterized as ``bits'' rather than ``atoms''\nA crucial instance of this mediation is the techno-\nlogical composition of information, or how specific\ntechnologies and formats shape its structural features.\nSince technology and information are inseparable from\nthe rest of the social world, the technological compos-\nition of information is influenced by socioeconomic\nrelations (Pinch and Bijker, 1984) and simultaneously\nimpacts them (Winner, 1993). This mutually constitu-\ntive relationship has important implications for the\nconstruction of property regimes of digital geographic\ninformation. An illustrative case in point is the contrast\nbetween digital and print information technologies. In\nthe last four decades, increased digitization has entailed\na sweeping disruption of long-established information\npractices and categories. The emergence of new media\nto store and display information has transformed sig-\nnificantly how goods are categorized in law and prac-\ntice, affecting the rules regulating their economic\nexploitation. These reconfigurations of rules, technolo-\ngies, and practices have created new property regimes\nfor the management and economic exploitation of\ninformational goods.\nThe growing repository of geographic information\non the Internet (often referred to as the `geoweb') is\nthe result of cumulative technological innovations\nsuch as social media, the exponential increase in pro-\ncessing speed, widespread cloud storage, and the emer-\ngence of server-side web-mapping (Tagoe and Mantey,\n2011). These technological developments, along with\nthe economic imperatives to commercialize geographic\ninformation, the regulatory frameworks of particular\ninformational categories, and territorial jurisdictions\nat different scales jointly articulate the property regimes\nof geographic information. Analyzing how these\nproperty regimes come together is an important step\ntowards understanding the commodification affecting\ndigital geographic information, as well as the broader\npolitical economy in which it develops.\nIn the following section, I introduce and explain\nof property regimes in the contexts of theories of prop-\nerty and the problem of distributed rights in digital\nenvironments. I then propose an extension of this\nschema tailored to the analysis of digital geographic\ninformation. Afterwards, I show how new property\nregimes are created through the technological trans-\nformations of established informational goods, such\nas in the process of digitization. To illustrate this,\nI use the example of maps, a paradigmatic good\nin the category of geographic information. By exploring\nthe transition from printed to digital formats, I show\nthe emergence of new property regimes and how this\ndestabilizes existing categories, creates new ones, and in\n2 Big Data & Society\nthe process rearticulates processes of commodification.\nI then deploy the property regimes schema to analyze\nthe commodification of geographic information in the\ncase of a good that is a result of the integration of\ndifferent types of geographic (and non-geographic)\ninformation in a networked digital environment:\nGoogle Street View. The analysis shows the various\ntypes of rights attached to each component of this\ngood, the allocation of these rights, and the manage-\nment technologies that mediate this process. One\nimportant implication is that the integration of different\nkinds of information and the emergence of new prop-\nerty regimes in the process of commodification often\ncreates tension between sets of values and logics,\nwhich often transcend property rights understood in\nisolation. A key example of this is privacy rights. As I\nshow in the case of Google Street View, information\nthat points to location and context must inevitably con-\nsider the aspects of privacy that arise from its collection\nand distribution. I conclude the analysis of the com-\nmodification of Google Street View by exploring how\nshifting notions and new constructions of privacy are\ndeeply constitutive of the creation of new geographic\ninformation products and the property regimes that\ncome together in this process.\nProperty regimes and the\ncommodification of\ngeographic information\nThe expansion of geographic information on the\nInternet should be understood in the context of a\nwider political economy characterized by the increasing\nreliance of capitalism on immaterial, symbolic,\ncognitive-cultural, and informational goods (Lash and\ndramatic growth of the digital economy (Ng, 2014;\nForum and Boston Consulting Group, 2013). This het-\nerogeneous body of informational products includes\ncommercial databases as well as resources whose pri-\nmary purpose is not necessarily commercial, such as\npublic information repositories, like the US Census\nBureau's American Fact Finder, and collaborative pro-\njects like OpenStreetMap. The capabilities of geo-\ngraphic information to provide location and context\nhave fueled its growing demand in a wide range of\nactivities, from retail and advertising to political cam-\npaigning (Henttu et al., 2012; World Economic Forum\nand Boston Consulting Group, 2013). In this expanding\neconomy of geographic information, the lines between\ncommercial and non-commercial products are continu-\nously redrawn, and their property regimes reconfigured.\nCommodification, or the process of creating goods\nfor the market, implies the delineation of property\nrights suitable for economic exchange. However, prop-\nerty rights must function within a broader infrastruc-\nture that includes legal, political, and technological\narrangements. Radin has called this ``the legal infra-\nstructure of private-property-plus free contract''\n(Radin, 2002). This draws attention to the mutual con-\nstitution of property rights with social and institutional\nrelations that emerge from and regulate the use, own-\nership, and exchange of any particular good.\nDigital information has posed particular challenges\nfor the definition of property rights. Samuelson identi-\nfied six characteristics of digital media that challenge\nand disrupt existing intellectual property systems:\n(1) ease of reproduction, (2) ease of transmission,\n(3) ease of modification and manipulation, (4) equiva-\nlence of digital works, (5) compactness of digital works,\nand (6) new methods of searching and linking digital\nworks (Samuelson, 1990). These challenges to existing\nnotions of property rights become even more acute in\nnetworked information environments. Overcoming\nthem is a key requirement for the digital economy,\nwhich increasingly relies on the monetized exchanges\nover the Internet. This has led to new approaches in\nthe allocation of distributed property rights. Often\nthese take the form of technical solutions such as the\ninformation controls and DRM systems mentioned\nabove. These systems have prompted discussions\n(Becker et al., 2003) regarding their role in privatizing\ncopyright (Lessig, 1999), narrowing property rights\n(Cohen, 1998), overreaching intellectual property\nenforcement (Samuelson, 1999), and even their futility\nin the face of alternative distribution networks \u00ad such as\npeer-to-peer sharing (Biddle et al., 2003).\nIn challenging and redefining the property rights\nenforcement, digital technologies have produced new\nconfigurations of social relations, institutions, and tech-\nnologies that come together in various ways for the\ncommodification of particular informational goods.\nThis requires analyses able to integrate the allocation\nof rights with the commodification of digital informa-\ntional goods into the multiple dimensions at which\nthese take place: infrastructural (e.g., cables, server\nfarms, terminals), geographical (e.g., territorial jurisdic-\ntions, borders), informational (e.g. information man-\nagement technologies and governance regimes of\nspecific informational categories).\nThese and other technological challenges have been\nreinforced by theoretical shifts away from absolutist\nand individualistic conceptions of property and\ntowards more contextually dependent readings.\nPerhaps the most influential, cited, and critiqued defin-\nition of property has been Blackstone's definition of\nprivate property, from Commentary on the Laws of\nEngland: ``that sole and despotic dominion which one\nman claims and exercises over the external things of the\nLeo\nworld, in total exclusion of the right of any other indi-\nBlackstone's analysis of property rights was more\nnuanced than his definition would suggest (Schorr,\n2009), the underlying idea of a ``sole and despotic\ndominion'' ``rings through the ages, and continues to\nblock clear thinking about private property'' (Heller,\nplemented by two additional categories to settle into\nwhat Michael Heller calls the ``well-worn trilogy of\nownership forms \u00adprivate, commons, and state prop-\nproperty owned by particular individuals (or families\nor firms); the second, by no one in particular; and the\nclassification broadens the idea of property to associate\nit with different actors, it does not reflect the diversity\nof arrangements that exist in practice.\nAn alternate conception of property, which chal-\nlenges absolutist and individualistic notions, is that of\na ``bundle of various rights, liberties, and powers that\ncan be divided among many parties in numerous ways''\nof departure, (Elinor and Vincent) Ostrom, along\nwith other scholars of the Bloomington School of\nPolitical Economy, developed a systematic approach\nto the distribution of property rights, the analysis of\ntheir different configurations in practice and their the-\noretical synthesis. A particularly useful and versatile\ntool among these contributions is the conceptual\nschema proposed by Schlager and Ostrom ``for array-\ning property-rights regimes that distinguishes among\ndiverse bundles of rights ranging from authorized\nuser, to claimant, to proprietor, and to owner''\nThis schema enables an organized analysis of how\nbundles of rights are distributed in the management of\na resource system. In this context, ``rights'' refers to\n``particular actions that are authorized,'' which are allo-\ncated to different ``roles.'' ``Rights'' are the product of\n``rules,'' or the prescriptions that create certain author-\nto three different levels of action: operational, collective-\nchoice, and constitutional. Schlager and Ostrom explain\nthe distinction between the first two categories as ``the\ndifference between exercising a right [operational] and\nparticipating in the definition of future rights to be\nexercised [collective-choice]'' (Schlager and Ostrom,\nwhere collective-choice rules are defined. The schema\nproposed by Schlager and Ostrom focuses on the\norganization of the first two levels of action in a prop-\nerty regime: the rules that create certain rights, and the\nroles defined by the allocation of those rights to par-\nticular actors. These elements, which together consti-\ntute any given property regime, are represented in\nThe property regimes schema illustrated by Table 1\nis comprised by two levels of action (operational and\ncollective-choice), five rights (access, withdrawal, man-\nagement, exclusion and alienation), and four roles\n(authorized user, claimant, proprietor, and owner)\nallocation of rights to different roles shows how prop-\nerty rights can be disaggregated and distributed in a\nvariety of ways. In this arrangement, the authorized\nuser has the least rights (access and withdrawal) and\nthe owner has the most (full set of property rights,\nincluding alienation). While the owner's full set of\nproperty rights echoes the Blackstonian definition\nproperty discussed above, a key insight from Schlager\nand Ostrom is that owners are not the only users who\n``make long-term investments in the development of\nTable 1.

Seeking to complement\nthis body of work, the present article analyzes a move-\nment in the opposite direction of knowledge commons:\nthe commodification of digital geographic information\non the Internet.\nCoexisting in a networked environment, repositories\nof government-produced, privately collected, and vol-\nunteered geographic information (among other types)\nare increasingly recombined to produce new market\nand non-market goods. Each of these informational\ninputs is often governed by different regulatory\nframeworks, which are articulated in the development\nof new property regimes. For example, as is discussed\nlater in the article: the privacy rights related to the\ncollection images and wireless data during the\ncreation of Google Street View have brought this prod-\nuct under a regulatory framework not applied previ-\nously to traditional maps. This highlights why the\npolitical economy of geographic information requires\na detailed and contextualized understanding of the\nnew property regimes that emerge in the process of\ncommodification.\nSpecifically in the case of geographic information,\nCho advances a notion compatible with ``bundles of\nrights'': layers of property rights over geographic infor-\nmation, which have a technical basis on the model of\nsuperimposed datasets used by most Geographic\nof rights'' can be thought of as a ``vertical'' allocation\nof partial rights over an entire good, ``layers of rights''\nin geographic information suggests a ``horizontal'' div-\nision. The coexistence of these in electronic maps and\nother geographic informational goods shapes negoti-\nations in the rights attached to discrete sets of informa-\ntion superimposed on each other, but which may each\nhave diverse origins and property regimes. This is a\nfeature that makes digital cartographic products sub-\nstantially different from print maps, which only showed\nthe graphic output of a specific arrangement of infor-\nmation, while concealing the layers of input required in\ntheir production. When digital maps and other types of\ngeographic information are uploaded to the Internet,\nthese complexities are intensified because they become\npart of an informational environment with great\npotential for widespread distribution, accessibility,\nand recombination.\nConsidering digitized geographic information, this\narticle extends Schlager and Ostrom's property regimes\nconceptual schema by focusing on three key elements to\nanalyze commodification of geographic information:\n(1) the role of information technologies (such as the\ntechnological composition of particular informational\ngoods, and technologies of access and management,\n\u00ad e.g., application programming interfaces, or APIs),\n(2) the specific features of digitized geographic informa-\ntion, such as the six features of digital media identified\nby Samuelson above, and the information layers char-\nacteristic of geographic information, and (3) the inter-\nsection and conflict between different logics and values\nresulting from the combination of informational inputs\nin the production of digital goods \u00ad such as issues\nwith property and privacy rights discussed in the case\nof Google Street View. Together these elements shape\nthe commodification of digital geographic information\ngoods, by modulating the allocation of rights over them\nand articulating new property regimes.\nThe property regimes of geographic information and\nits commodification take shape within a broader polit-\nical economy affected by the changing role of the state\nin the collection and provision of geographic goods. On\nthe one hand, many national and subnational adminis-\ntrations are adopting ``open data policies'' (Huijboom\nand Van den Broek, 2011). On the other hand, there is a\n``roll back'' by different governments away from previ-\nously publicly provided functions and services, which\nimpacts the production of geographic information\n(Leszczynski, 2012). This retreat has produced at least\ntwo concurrent developments. Firstly, it has transferred\nmapping capabilities to private corporations and com-\nmunities of users. This transfer has occurred explicitly\nthrough outsourcing and subcontracting, or implicitly\nthrough passive non-competition and the creation of\nmarket spaces for the development of a geographic\ninformation industry. In the past decade, this process\nhas been accelerated by the availability of web-based\nmapping technologies. Secondly, this process has reori-\nented state capacity towards intensifying the publicly\nfunded collection and production of restricted-access\ngeographic information, much of it towards the swel-\nling surveillance and security apparatus of various\nDigital geographic information incorporates key fea-\ntures in contemporary capitalism such as digitization,\nintellectual property, regulatory restructuring, and the\ndigital economy. This makes understanding its com-\nmodification a necessary task. In the following section,\nI begin this task by showing how property regimes are\nreconfigured through the digitization of information\nLeo\nand focus on the transition from print to digital maps.\nThis lays the groundwork for analyzing the commodi-\nfication of a particular digital geographic information\ngood: Google Street View.\nFrom maps to databases\nTo illustrate the interdependence between technological\nchange and property regimes in the context of geo-\ngraphic information, consider an example that predates\n\u00ad and prefigures \u00ad developments in the ``geoweb'': the\ntransition from paper to electronic maps. Since\nthe appearance of Geographic Information Systems in\nthe 1960s, the focus on hand-drawn paper maps as\nproducts of the cartographic process has shifted\ntowards the dynamic manipulation of different kinds\nof geographic information through innovations in\ncomputing and geographic information technologies\nThese changes in cartography, geographic information\nmanagement, and their widening range of applications\nhave fueled an industry with an estimated $USD\na multiplier effect of $USD 1.6 trillion in U.S. economic\ngrowth (Henttu et al., 2012). The digitization of maps\nand computerization of the cartographic process have\nalso redefined geographic information. This epistemic\nshift is at the crucible of significant legal changes, such\nas the emergence of new property regimes involved in\nthe management and commodification of geographic\ninformation.\nIn the United States, maps have been a protected\ncategory under Copyright Law since the first\nHowever, the term ``map'' is no longer a stable cat-\negory. For the first two centuries of US Copyright\nLaw, while there were intermittent arguments regard-\ning what constitutes originality in a map \u00ada require-\nment for copyright protection \u00ad (Whicher, 1963) \u00ad\nthese were not focused on the question of what a map\nis. Maps were tacitly understood in the legal context as\npictorial representations of spatial information. The\nincreased production of maps by digital geographic\ninformation systems has destabilized the legal consen-\nsus governing the definition of these objects and the\nprotections granted to them.\nCopyright Law considers maps the pictorial outputs\nof the cartographic process. However, maps are\nincreasingly defined not by their pictorial aspects, but\nby the informational inputs and operations involved in\ntheir production. This technological shift has recali-\nbrated the economic valuation of maps. Geographic\nInformation Systems enable the organization, analysis,\nand transformation of spatial data while making\nthe creation of graphical maps a secondary task.\nConsequently, the value attributed to the mapping pro-\ncess has shifted to the increasingly complex databases\nof spatial information and the techniques used to\nextract meaningful patterns from them. With the\nMayer-Scho\n\u00a8 nberger and Cukier, 2013), the database\ncomponents of maps have found ever wider applica-\ntions (e.g., real-time enhanced navigation such as\nWaze, and geo-targeted advertising) and market poten-\ntial relative to the graphical component of maps.\nNotwithstanding the growing economic value of\ndatabases, contrasting degrees of protection are offered\nto the pictorial and informational components of digi-\ntal maps. Whereas pictorial maps are still protected by\nCopyright Law, databases are subject to a more con-\ntested legal regime (Reichman and Samuelson, 1997).\nThe US Supreme Court decision on the case of\nFeist v Rural in 1991 established that databases are\nnot de facto protected by copyright because they are\nconsidered compilations of facts. This ruling disquali-\nfied databases from automatic protection for two main\nreasons: Firstly, facts themselves cannot be copy-\nrighted. Secondly, compilations do not necessarily\nmeet the minimum threshold of creativity required to\nbe considered original expressions (Feist Publications,\nInc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 1991).\nThe Feist verdict was reached by concluding that\nFeist Publications' copy of over 1000 entries from a\ntelephone directory published by Rural Telephone\nService did not imply a copyright violation. While the\norigins of this ruling may seem rooted in a different era,\nits resonance for the digital economy has become sig-\nnificant due to its impact on the protection of databases\ncompiled in any medium. In the context of geographic\ninformation, this implies a discrepancy in the property\nregimes of the different informational components of\nthe map that has not been fully resolved and is expected\nto continue generating debates in the courts.\nFurthermore, this decision has generated new ways\nof managing the value of maps and allocating rights to\ntheir use and commercialization. However, since the\nunderlying databases are not de facto protected by\ncopyright, this opens the door for increased use of con-\ntracts (Karjala, 1995) or hybrid sui generis protections,\nboth of which may be much more restrictive than the\nmost stringent copyright protections and have signifi-\ncant anti-competitive effects while constraining access\nto essential inputs for knowledge creation (Reichman\nThese developments show that the transition from\nprinted to electronic maps affected much more than\nthe technical aspects of geographic products: it also\ntransformed their meaning, value, and regulation. In\nthe following section I deploy the property regimes\nschema to analyze the commodification of Google\n6 Big Data & Society\nStreet View, a new type of geographic information pro-\nduct in the context generated by the technological and\nregulatory rearticulations discussed above.\nConstructing Google Street View's\nproperty regime\nThe commodification of Google Street\nView images\nReleased in 2007, the Google Street View platform was\nnot the first service to show a map with linked photo-\ngraphs for specific locations: Amazon launched the\nshort-lived BlockView in 2005 and Microsoft's\nStreetside appeared in 2006. Yet Google Street View\nsoon developed competitive advantages through exten-\nsive primary data collection by Google vehicles and\nintegration with Google Maps and Search platforms.\nThis allowed Google Street View to produce a compre-\nhensive and navigable virtual environment. Initially\nlaunched in five cities (San Francisco, New York, Las\nVegas, Miami and Denver), it now covers 3000 cities in\n54 countries and is expanding to cover features such as\nthe Amazon and the Grand Canyon (Fisher, 2013).\nThe development of Google Street View also\nentailed the production of new cartographic perspec-\ntives. These perspectives signaled not only new\nground in cartographic representation, but also shift\nin image processing and delivery technologies, as well\nas new modes of user engagement with digital maps. An\nelement of this is the innovation of the R5 and R7\nrosette cameras, which are mounted on Google vehi-\ncles, and can produce a continuous 360-degree panora-\nmic high-resolution digital environment (Anguelov\net al., 2010). As mentioned above, another element is\nthe integration of this virtual environment into Google\nMaps and Search (Vincent, 2007). This enables users to\nnavigate space by transitioning between the carto-\ngraphic ``view from above'' provided by Google\nMaps, with its turn-by-turn navigation interface\n(which directs drivers at each step of their route), and\nthe virtual landscape of Google Street View with its\nreproduction of the street-level point of view, of the\ncar or pedestrian (Anguelov et al., 2010). These features\nare further enhanced by the inclusion of satellite layers\non the Google Maps and with the separate release of\nthe Google Earth application.\nBeyond contributing to Google Maps' hegemony of\ngeneral-purpose web-mapping service and mobile navi-\ngation applications (Smith, 2013), the significance of\nGoogle Street View lies in blurring the lines between\ndigital maps, navigation services, and virtual environ-\nments. This results from expanding the scale (millions\nof images), scope (growing coverage), perspective\n(ground level linked to view from above), and usability\n(navigation function and articulation with search) of\ndigital maps on the Internet. By integrating these elem-\nents into a consumer product which users can access\nthrough tiered service (involving both informational\nand monetary exchanges), Google has engaged in per-\nhaps the most thorough and expansive commodifica-\ntion of geographic information ever attempted.\nSince the tiers of service provision correspond to sets\nof rights transferred to users in various types of\nexchanges, a property regimes analysis through an\nextension of Schlager and Ostrom's (1992) schema\ncan help illuminate how Google Street View and\nGoogle Maps commodify geographic information.\nA first step in the commodification of geographic\ninformation is securing the property rights for the digi-\ntal images in Google Street View for their assembly into\na virtual environment. This constitutes a process of\nlandscape production. According to Cosgrove, since\nits inception in Renaissance Europe, landscape as a\n``way of seeing'' has achieved ``the control and domin-\nation over space as an absolute, objective entity, its\ntransformation into the property of individual or\nwas bound up with activities of power, control, and\nstrategic domination of space such as survey and\nmapping of estates by the urban bourgeoisie, defensive\nfortification, and cartographic projection (Cosgrove,\nof landscape involves the gradual accumulation of geo-\ngraphic information into a new market commodity: a\nvirtual navigation platform which users pay (through\nmonetary or informational exchanges) to access, use,\nand manage various functions ranging from explor-\nation to API use by third party applications.\nElements of the environment, such as buildings,\nstreets and parks, are framed and captured as land-\nscapes when they are fixed on a visual medium. In\nCosgrove's terms, this is the point when each photo-\ngraphic image is ``produced by the sovereign eye,'' into\na landscape where ``space is rendered the property of\nthe individual detached observer, from whose location\nit is a dependent, appropriated object'' (Cosgrove,\nthe personalized production of landscapes enabled\nthrough the customized views offered by Google\nStreet View.\nThe landscape production by Google's cameras\nresults from the appropriation of visual information,\nthe first step in the process of commodification of\nGoogle Street View. In terms of property rights, these\nphotographs are protected by copyright in the US and\nother jurisdictions since they amount to original images\nfixed on a tangible medium of expression. On the other\nhand, the production of Google Street View images\nimplies more than the photographs captured by the\nLeo\nvehicles. As will be discussed below, regulators have\nshown that Google vehicles collect wireless communi-\ncations data from private wireless networks in the\ncourse of taking Google Street View photographs.\nThis brings an added layer of complexity to the prop-\nerty regime of Google Street View because wireless\ncommunications (and the private information therein)\nfall under a different regulatory framework to photo-\ngraphs. This highlights how privacy issues have become\nincreasingly intertwined with the commodification of\ngeographic information in the digital economy.\nWhile Google Street View is a result of commodifi-\ncation through landscape creation, each individual\nlandscape image has negligible value for Google. The\nvalue creation of Google Street View takes place\nthrough the massive integration of individual images\ninto a navigable virtual environment. Google Street\nView is then made into a commodity through the accu-\nmulation of millions of infinitesimally valuable proper-\nties, which are assembled into a coherent, fully\ninteractive virtual ``landscape of landscapes.'' This\nproduct only accrues value once it is functional and\nreleased online for users to navigate it. This value is\nfully realized when different kinds of users interact\nwith the features of Google Street View and Maps\nthrough monetary and/or informational exchanges.\nThere are two kinds of users for Google Street View\nand Maps: first, the advertisers, who pay to have their\nads shown on the map itself. Second: the end users of\nthe maps and the map API. For the advertisers, Google\nStreet View and Maps represent a way to reach and\nresearch geographically targeted market segments at\nincreasingly more detailed scales. On the other hand,\nend users have a variety of interactions with this prod-\nuct that include monetary and non-monetary transac-\ntions and range from exploration and navigation to\nservice provision through the use of the Google Maps\nAPI in third party applications.\nThe first tier of end users engages in a non-monetary\ntransaction involving the collection of their search\ninformation by Google in exchange for the use value\nprovided by Google Street View: navigation directions\nand detailed place-based information. A second tier of\nusers (Standard API users) can integrate the Google\nMaps API, which includes Google Street View, into\ntheir own online services. The paid service for this tier\nincludes a volume of 25,000 map load requests per day\nfor a period of 90 consecutive days. For requests\nexceeding this limit, there is a third tier of service\n(Premium API users), which charges according to the\nvolume of requests (Google, n.d.). For users to inte-\ngrate the Google Maps API into their services, access\nmust be open to the public and free of charge, unless an\nexception is explicitly specified in the agreement with\nIn these transactions, governed by licenses, users\nprovide information or money in exchange for different\nuses of the Google Street View and Maps. Through this\ntriangular exchange between advertisers, end users, and\nGoogle (through Google Maps/Street View and Google\nSearch), the commodity realizes its value in different\nways for the three parties involved. The users receive\nthe service of navigation and exploration (for first tier\nend users), or a product that they can incorporate into\ntheir own applications (for second and third tier API\nend users); Google receives a combination of users'\ninformation, money, and the diffusion of their product\nthrough third party services (API users). Google\nthen uses this information to sell search engine\nand map space to advertisers, who in turn receive\nincreased exposure. These exchanges are summarized\nin Table 2.\nTable 2.

Above I discussed the construc-\ntion of property through the allocation of specific rights\nas a result of monetary and non-monetary exchanges.\nThese exchanges in turn create roles that come together\nto form a property regime specific to Google Street\nView images. Table 3 summarizes these exchanges\nand the rights assigned through to them to various\nroles, using the terminology of Schlager and Ostrom\n(1992). In the following subsection, I turn to the role\nof privacy in the creation of a property regime specific\nto Google Street View.\nThe role of privacy in Google Street View's\nproperty regimes\nIn the preceding subsection, I outlined two key issues in\nthe creation of a property regime for Google Street\nView: property and privacy. The technological means\nof imagery collection and the very nature of the Google\nStreet View platform make these concerns increasingly\ndifficult to disentangle. In this context, the second con-\ncern, privacy, stems initially from the capture of Google\nStreet View images as well as from the degree of inva-\nsion of someone's private sphere implicated by this\naction. Since this is a service offered in many countries,\nthe property regimes shaping its commodification will\nvary across jurisdictions. These variations affect\nthe product itself. For example, the information\nincluded on the map can change due to geopolitical\nconsiderations, and the various privacy regulations\ncan restrict the collection of certain data. While there\nare many factors that may influence the local configur-\nation of these property regimes, a key indicator is the\nrelative weight given in each case to the privacy and\nproperty of the images and information involved in\nthe triangular exchange (users \u00ad Google \u00ad advertisers)\nexplained above.\nIn order to discuss the privacy implications of\nGoogle Street View imagery collection, it must be\nnoted, as Elwood and Leszczynski have done (2011)\nthat the geoweb has catalyzed a reconceptualization\nof privacy, as well as the associated social (and legal)\nstruggles to define, maintain, and protect it. The fact\nthat large datasets and imagery can be directly linked\nwith particular physical locations creates a qualitatively\ndifferent context in which to discuss what privacy\nmeans and how it is constructed. As Google Street\nView and other products in the geoweb have shown,\nlarge and networked datasets are becoming associated\nwith spatial presence in ways that were unavailable to\npurely textual, tabular, or numerical data. This funda-\nmentally alters the position and relations between\nactors who produce, access, use, or control these data\n(Elwood and Leszczynski, 2011). These relations are\ntechnological as much as they are institutional, polit-\nical, and economic.\nIn the case of Google Street View, the production of\nthis digital commodity must negotiate shifting concep-\ntions of privacy, which are further transformed by the\nvery act of imagery collection. In the course of collect-\ning imagery, Google Street View vehicles physically\nnavigate public thoroughfares. However, the public\nTable 3.

For example, Google has acknowledged\nthat some Street View images may contain sensitive\ninformation. In light of this, the company announced\nmeasures to blur people's faces and vehicle license\nplates (Google, n.d.), as well as to comply with individ-\nual, community and government requests to omit cer-\ntain locations from Google Maps and Google Street\nView (Google, n.d.; IT Security Editors, n.d.).\nFurthermore, governments often submit content\ntakedown requests to Google based on a range of cri-\nteria. While technically subject to legal oversight, it is\nGoogle that executes the content removal. The all-\nencompassing image capture of Google Street View\ncombined with the power of discretionary removal\nthat ultimately lies in the hands of Google have made\nprivacy a major point of contention regarding the oper-\nations of this service in a number of countries. The\nprivacy concerns that began with the collection of ima-\ngery intensified in 2010 when Data Protection\nAuthorities in Ireland and Germany pressed Google\nto admit that in the course of their operations,\nGoogle Street View cars also collected information\nabout private wireless networks (Google, 2010), such\nas router identifiers (SSIDs), computer MAC addresses,\nand even emails and browsing content in the case of\nunencrypted networks (Stroz, 2010). Google Street\nView has thus been identified as a threat to privacy\nand received renewed scrutiny around the world\nthrough government investigations and private lawsuits\n(Electronic Privacy Information Center, 2010).\nThese incidents have highlighted two aspects of priv-\nacy associated with the production of Google Street\nView: the collection of the images themselves, and the\ncollection of wireless network data that takes places\nduring image capture. These two aspects cannot be\nreadily separated since the technology used for naviga-\ntion purposes and image collection contained the code\nthat collected wireless network data (Stroz, 2010).\nAccording to Google, their vehicles collected both\nallegedly stopped this practice (Google, 2010).\nIn the United States, there have been private and\nclass action lawsuits from parties who see Google\nStreet View's imagery collection as a breach of privacy\n(Geissler, 2012). This concern over image collection has\nbeen compounded with responses focused on the wire-\nless data collection. European countries have been the\nmost vocal against both types of data collection. For\nexample, there has been public outcry and massive\nremoval requests in the UK and Germany. In Greece,\nthe Czech Republic and Austria, data protection autho-\nrities temporarily banned collection to allow further\nreview (Electronic Privacy Information Center, 2010;\nIn light of these accusations in the US and the EU,\nGoogle argued that their cameras capture the same\nimages that any passerby on the street would be able\nto see. However, most Street View cameras stand nine-\nfeet tall, mounted on top of fast-moving vehicles, have\n360-degree vision and produce high-resolution images\nthat can be augmented by zoom. Critics argue that the\ncombination of these features means that ``most Street\nView imagery is created in a way that exceeds normal\nthat it should be considered in a different bracket\nfrom ordinary public view.\nWith regard to imagery collection, the courts in\nGermany and the United States have been asked to\ndecide whether Google Street View's image collection\nviolates individuals' right to privacy. While the plain-\ntiffs' claims have been dismissed in both countries,\nGeissler points out that there is an underlying contrast\nin how the right to privacy has been construed in each\njurisdiction. In the United States, tort law places a\nmuch higher burden on private citizens to protect\n``courts have interpreted [text in the German consti-\ntution] to imply a right to privacy that not only\nencompasses an affirmative government obligation to\nprotect this right, but one that also constrains pri-\nvate parties' interactions with other private parties''\nto operate in Germany, the company reported that\nas of November 2014 they are not engaged in the\ncollection of Street View imagery for public display,\nand only use it to improve Google Maps (Google\nThe privacy issues raised by the collection of ima-\ngery are further complicated by the associated collec-\ntion of wireless communications data by Google\nvehicles. While these are developing in different ways\nacross several jurisdictions, they highlight how the\nproperty regimes of digital information often tran-\nscend both property rights considered in isolation\nand the regulatory frameworks that govern any one\nof the inputs into new informational products. The\nintegration of debates on privacy, ownership, and\nthe commodification of geographic information is cru-\ncial to understand the generation of value by products\nsuch as Google Street View. How privacy is concep-\ntualized, debated, and resolved plays an important\nrole in how informational commodities are produced\nand commercialized. Along with the allocation of\nrights of access, use and ownership of Google Street\nView images, the particular constructions of privacy\nshaped by variegated legal challenges across jurisdic-\ntions contribute to construct the property regimes gov-\nerning the production and appropriation of value\nthough this product.\n10 Big Data & Society\nConclusion\nThe analysis of Google Street View presented in this\narticle applies Schlager and Ostrom's property regimes\nconceptual schema (1992) to explore an instance of the\ncommodification of geographic information on the\nInternet. This analysis represents an extension of\nthe property regimes schema by considering the chal-\nlenges of digital information to the allocation of\nproperty rights and by focusing on the role of\ntechnologies in the transformation of legal protections.\nFurthermore, by incorporating the discussions on\nprivacy with the allocation of property rights, this\nanalysis brings into discussion the different values\nand logics (such as privacy) that have become increas-\ningly intertwined in the commodification of digital\ninformation. Finally, by focusing on the transition\nfrom printed maps to digital maps and illustrating\nthe emergence of new property regimes in the case\nof Google Street View, the article highlights how the\ncharacteristics of geographic information and its\ntechnological developments affect its new possibilities\nfor its commodification in digital networked environ-\nments. The framework presented here can be deployed\nproductively to examine other geographic information\nplatforms (such as Bing Maps or OpenStreetMap)\nand understand the commodification of different\ntypes of information (such as satellite, crowdsourced,\nand health data).\nIn a broader context, the arguments in this article\ncontribute to a political economy of geographic infor-\nmation on the Internet. This has been characterized by\nthe reduction of the role of the state in the ``carto-\ngraphic project,'' a process which has been accelerated\nby neoliberalization (Leszczynski, 2012). In combin-\nation with technological changes such as digitization,\nthe movement away from state-centric cartography\ntowards an expanding geographic information ecosys-\ntem is necessarily implicated in the redistribution of\npower dynamics between the state and other actors.\nIt is at this juncture that we should understand\nand analyze the emergence of a digital economy of\ngeographic information and its expansion on the\nInternet through processes of commodification. At\na time when evermore information is becoming\ndigitized, and much of it commodified, it remains a\nnecessary task to conduct increasingly granular ana-\nlyses of the production of value through information\nand understand their meaning within broader social\ntransformations.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial sup-\nport for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle: The research and writing of this article were under-\ntaken with the support of the UC MEXUS-CONACYT\nDoctoral Fellowship.\nReferences\nAnguelov D, Dulong C, Filip D, et al.
