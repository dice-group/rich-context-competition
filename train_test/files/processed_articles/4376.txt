    "abstract": "Abstract\nStates vary in standards for sex education, some requiring an emphasis on abstinence. Schools seek to identify curricula that\nreflect local community values and meet state standards. Choosing the Best (CTB), a classroom-based abstinence education\ncurriculum, has been implemented in 75 Georgia school districts since 1995. CTB Inc., sought to determine if this popular\nprogram had an impact on abstinence attitudes, intentions, and behavior. Six Georgia public schools (1,143 ninth graders)\nparticipated in the study in 2009-2010. Four randomly assigned schools received the CTB curriculum, taught by trained CTB\nstaff.Two control schools received their usual textbook-based abstinence lessons. Surveys were conducted at the beginning\nand end of 9th grade,and the beginning of 10th grade.Data demonstrated significant impact of CTB at the end of 9th grade on\ncommitment to abstinence, proabstinence beliefs and attitudes, intentions to maintain abstinence, and lower onset of sexual\nintercourse, and at the beginning of 10th grade on proabstinence attitudes. In two communities that sought an abstinence\neducation approach, CTB had a short-term impact on abstinence attitudes, commitment, and behaviors, and a longer term\nimpact on abstinence attitudes only.\n",

The majority of the TPP\nprograms funded have been comprehensive sex education\nprograms, although limited funds for abstinence education\nprograms were appropriated in the 2010 health reform legis-\nSince 1996, a variety of abstinence education programs\nproliferated. Evaluation of their impact, however, has yielded\nonly limited studies, which have suggested delayed sexual\ninitiation (Denny & Young, 2006; Weed, Ericksen, Lewis,\nGrant, & Wibberley, 2008), several demonstrating that the\nbeen rigorous enough to draw conclusions (Kirby, 2007,\n2008). One study demonstrated long-term impact of an absti-\nnence program on sexual behavior; however, the program's\ndefinition of abstinence did not meet A-H abstinence-\nuntil-marriage guidelines (Jemmott, Jemmott, & Fong, 2010).\nWhile the Federal government has made a significant\ninvestment in abstinence education since 1996, states have\nvaried widely in their approaches to curriculum require-\nments, some taking advantage of the federal funds and their\nassociated matching requirements, which required programs\nto meet the A-H abstinence-only-until-marriage definition.\nOther states opted out of the federally funded program,\nthereby not having access to the federal funds, but enabling\nindividual school districts to choose programs with or with-\nMeanwhile, state standards for curricula vary widely.

In all, 13 states expressly\nrequire inclusion of information on the negative outcomes of\nteen sex and pregnancy, and 36 require that instruction on\nabstinence be provided. Georgia mandates that sex education\nfor public school students include \"abstinence from sexual\nactivity as an effective method of prevention of pregnancy,\nsexually transmitted diseases, and acquired immune defi-\nciency syndrome.\" Furthermore, Georgia allows, but does\nnot require, information on condoms or contraception (State\nof Georgia Department of Education, 2011). Similarly, Texas,\nAlabama, and Mississippi promote or require schools to adopt\nprograms that focus exclusively or at least partially on absti-\nnence (Table 1; eLobbyist, 2011; FindLaw for Legal\nProfessionals, 2011; The Institute for Youth and Development,\n2004). Despite varying state standards, a significant number\nof teens nationwide continue to report having sex and engag-\ning in behaviors that place them at risk for pregnancy, HIV,\nand sexually transmitted infections (STIs; Centers for Disease\ncommunities seek to address these issues, school districts try\nto identify curricula that both reflect local community values\nand meet their state education standards.\nChoosing the Best (CTB; Cook, 2009) has been utilized in\nschools in 48 different states, although its use has been more\nprevalent in Southeastern and Midwestern states. More than\n3 million students have participated in a CTB program since\nselected the CTB program since 1995. Georgia's teen preg-\nnancy rate has gone down at a higher rate than the nation-\nwide trend over that same period, but remains alarmingly\nDepartment of Human Services, 2007). Recognizing that the\nco-occurrence of high rates of program use and lower rates\nof teen pregnancy do not demonstrate evidence, CTB sought\nto determine if its approach, while popular in communities\nseeking an abstinence curriculum, was actually resulting in\nthe maintenance of abstinence or a return from sexual activ-\nity to abstinence.\nCTB is a classroom-based curriculum, providing devel-\nopmentally phased messages--for Grades 6 through 12--\nabout the risks of sexual activity, including, but not limited\nto, intercourse. CTB uses medical information to empha-\nsize the role of abstinence as the best way to prevent preg-\nnancy, disease, and emotional consequences of sexual\nintercourse, as well as its role in supporting academic and\nother goals for future success. In accordance with the\nreview process for all federal abstinence education grant-\nees, CTB was reviewed and deemed \"medically accurate.\"\nOne study suggested that CTB significantly affected a\nrange of \"cognitive mediators\" for sexual behavior, as well\nas onset of sexual activity 1 year after the program (Weed\n& Anderson, 2005). The mediators included holding absti-\nnence values, personal efficacy to maintain abstinence val-\nues, future orientation to goals as they relate to maintaining\nabstinence, independence from peer pressure, maintaining\nattitudes that do not justify sexual behaviors, and intentions\nand commitment to remain abstinent. Despite several meth-\nodological limitations, the study's findings suggested that a\nmore rigorous, experimental evaluation was warranted.\nFunding from a Community-Based Abstinence Education\ngrant enabled CTB Inc., to conduct an independent study in\nthe program, focused on CTB Journey (Cook, 2009). CTB\nJourney is the component designed for the 9th grade, where\nabstinence education is typically taught in high school and\nwhen the majority of students report that they have not had\nsexual intercourse (Eaton et al., 2010). It should be noted\nthat most large-scale studies of such school-based pro-\ngrams use random assignment of schools, but few are able\nto randomize individual students or classrooms within\nschools (Kirby, 2008). Such studies are very difficult to\nimplement and are subject to contamination across students\nwithin a particular school.\nMethod\nParticipants\nStudy participants were 1,143 ninth graders in two Georgia\nschool districts that had a total of six high schools, randomly\nassigned to intervention (four schools) or control (two\nschools). These two school districts were chosen because\nthey did not already offer the CTB program, but expressed\nan interest in it, and were therefore willing to cooperate in a\nstudy in which some schools would randomly be assigned to\nthe control condition. Ninth graders in control schools\nreceived their regular textbook-based health lessons\nincluded a discussion of abstinence, that is, the \"usual care\"\nin these districts. Ninth graders in intervention schools\nreceived the eight-session CTB Journey program, taught\nduring health class, by trained CTB staff. The schools in\nthese two districts, one rural and one a very large suburban\ndistrict, were widely spread out from each other, and there\nwas limited contact between students from different schools\nwithin or between each of the districts.\nThe pool of eligible students included approximately\nninth graders in the control schools. Ultimately, 1,143 stu-\ndents, 38% of the total eligible pool, returned parental con-\nsent to participate in the research. The rate of parental\nconsent did not differ between the intervention and control\nschools. Comparison of study participants to the overall\nschool demographics suggested that those who received con-\nsent were more likely to be female and African American\nfrom the population of ninth graders in the intervention\nschools, but the control group sample did not differ from the\nninth graders in their schools. These differences are dis-\ncussed further in the \"Results\" section.\nLieberman and Su 3\nTable 1.

Students in the\nprogram receive a maximum of eight, 45-min classroom\nsessions during their regular health classes. In those sessions,\nCTB teaches that abstinence from sexual activity until mar-\nriage is the best way to avoid teen pregnancy, disease, and\npossible negative emotional consequences, and is the best\nway to help students focus on academic and other future-\noriented goals. CTB discusses both benefits and limitations of\n4 SAGE Open\ncondoms and other forms of contraception in preventing preg-\nnancy and STIs, in the context of promoting abstinence until\nmarriage as the healthiest and most reliable choice. Built on\nthe Theory of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior (Ajzen\nfocuses on building intention to maintain abstinence, provid-\ning students opportunities to explore their own beliefs and\nvalues, and to understand how these are influenced by others'\nbeliefs. In addition, CTB is designed to help students under-\nstand how to set limits in relationships and establish refusal\nskills to build a sense of control and power (Albarrac\u00edn,\nJohnson, Fishbein, & Muellerleile, 2001). Consistent with this\ntheory, the study hypothesized that students in the CTB\nschools would demonstrate significantly greater increase from\nbaseline to posttest than those in the control schools in atti-\ntudes and beliefs that support abstinence, discussions about\nabstinence with their parents and others whose opinions were\nimportant to them, sense of empowerment and confidence\n(self-efficacy) to maintain abstinence to meet their long-term\nlife goals, and delay of sexual activity. Similarly, it was\nhypothesized that these significant differences would increase\nor be maintained at the long-term follow-up.\nInstruments\nIn early 2009, a draft survey instrument, based on existing,\nnew, and funder-required items, was developed by program\nand evaluation staff. The survey was approved by school dis-\ntrict personnel and Boards of Education of two Georgia\nstudents from one ninth-grade class in each of the two school\ndistricts. The final survey, modified using pilot data and feed-\nback, included items that reflected six separate scales:\nProabstinenceAttitudes,ProabstinenceBeliefs,Empowerment/\nHopefulness for the Future, Commitment to Abstinence,\nParent/Child Communication, and Self-Efficacy.1 Scales were\ncreated using the mean of the individual items for each of the\nsix constructs. Table 2 presents the scales, sample items, and\nCronbach's alpha for each of the scales. Additional items\nmeasured abstinence intentions (likelihood of having sex\nwithin the next year, and likelihood of having sex as a teen\nbefore marriage), whether or not they had had sexual inter-\ncourse, and, if so, when was the last time. Although the cur-\nriculum focuses on a range of sexual behaviors, the evaluation\nspecifically defined sex as \"sexual intercourse or going all the\nway.\" Due to concerns about the schools' and communities'\nsensitivity to more explicit questions, and the primary focus\non abstinence behavior, the schools and researchers agreed\nthat the survey would not include questions regarding contra-\nceptive use among those who had had sex.\nProcedure\nStudents were surveyed 3 times--at the beginning and end\nof 9th grade and at the beginning of 10th grade. The evaluator\nto elicit support in encouraging students to return consent\nforms. The evaluator trained data collection staff in proto-\ncols, confidentiality, and completion of cover sheet identify-\ning information. Data collectors were CTB staff not teaching\nor involved in the program at those schools.\nConsent forms were mailed to all 9th-grade parents,\nbefore the 1st week of school, directly from the principals,\nwith a second request 1 or 2 weeks later. As an incentive to\nencourage their parents to return a consent form, students\nwere eligible to be enrolled in a lottery for an ipod player at\ntheir school, if their parent returned a consent form. Pretests\nfor all students who had active consent took place during\nAugust 2009, in their regular English classrooms. Students\nwho did not have parental consent were given an alternative\nassignment in another location, as determined by each school's\nadministration. Data collectors had students place the sur-\nveys directly into an envelope, which was sealed while in the\nclassroom, and then delivered to the project evaluator for\ndata entry and analysis.\nAfter all baseline surveys were completed, the evaluator\nused a table of random numbers to assign the six schools to a\nstudy condition. The randomization process successfully\nresulted in two of the three high schools in each district serv-\ning as intervention schools and one school in each district\nassigned to the control condition.\nCollection of post and follow-up data took place in English\nclasses, during May and October 2010 (the end of 9th and\nbeginning of 10th grades). Teachers in control schools and\nCTB program staff completed a student attendance form for\nevery session that the CTB program and textbook lessons\nwere taught. Those data were entered by name and ID and\nthen transmitted to the evaluator by ID only, to merge with\nthe survey database for calculation of program dosage.\nData Analysis\nChi-square tests and t tests compared baseline means and\nproportions. Each participant had three measurements on the\noutcome variables; thus, outcome variables (continuous and\nbinary) were analyzed using generalized estimating equation\nmodels for longitudinal data (proc genmod procedure in\nSAS 9.1, logit link function was used for binary outcome\nvariables). The models included terms for treatment condi-\ntion, time, a time-by-treatment interaction, and other con-\ntrolling covariates--pretest scores, age, gender, race/\nethnicity, and program dosage. Models were built for all\nstudents and separately for those who were virgins at pretest\nand for those who had had sex. A second set of models for\neach of the groups also controlled for pretest commitment to\nabstinence. This set is presented here, as commitment to\nabstinence improved the models, but did not influence the\ntreatment outcomes.\nThe intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calcu-\nlated for the continuous outcomes, to study the school-level\nLieberman and Su 5\nclustering effect in the analyses. The ICC overall was com-\nputed using the linear mixed-effects model with the schools\nas the random effects (Stanish & Taylor, 1983). The ICC for\nthe outcome variables are all less than .01 in this study.\nResults\nMore than a third (38%) of the ninth-grade parents gave\nactive consent for their child to participate (n = 1,172), and\nparticipated in the study. The control group sample was rep-\nresentative of their schools' overall gender and race/ethnicity\ndemographics. The intervention study sample was more\nlikely to be female and less likely to be White than the\noverall demographic for their respective study schools. The\ntotal study sample was slightly more female than male (57%\nfemale), just over half were Caucasian (55%), and a third\n(33%) were African American. Additional descriptive infor-\nmation about the sample is reported in Table 3.\nThere were no significant differences between the inter-\nvention and control samples on age or gender (Table 3).\nThere was a significant between-group difference on race/\nethnicity, with the control group more likely to be White and\nless likely to be African American than the intervention\ngroup. Because there were significant differences between\nthe treatment and control group on race/ethnicity, the\nTable 2.

There were no\nsignificant intervention/control group differences on pretest\nsexual activity or any of the scales at baseline.\nAt the pretest, 69.3% of the CTB group reported that they\nwere virgins, that is, had never had sexual intercourse,\nwhereas 72.3 % of the control group were virgins. At the\nposttest, 66% of the CTB group were still virgins and 63% of\nthe control group were still virgins. By the long-term follow-\nup, 58% of the CTB group and 61% of the control group\nwere still virgins, a drop of 11% from the pretest in both\ngroups. None of the differences between groups at baseline,\nposttest, or follow-up were significant.\nTable 4 presents the sample size (N), means at pretest,\nposttest, and follow-up on each of the study variables. It also\npresents the effect size at the posttest for the outcome vari-\nables for all students. Retention rates from pretest to post-\ntest and from pretest to follow-up were 85% and 78%,\nrespectively, in the intervention group, and were 81% and\n69% in the control group. Analyses compared pretest gender,\nethnicity, and sexual experience for those lost to follow-up\nbetween the intervention and control groups. There were no\nsignificant differences in loss to follow-up between interven-\ntion and control groups in terms of gender, ethnicity, and\nsexual experience.\nTable 5 presents modeling results for each of the models\ncontrolling for age, gender, baseline commitment to absti-\nnence, pretest score on each of the dependent variables, pro-\ngram or lesson dosage (i.e., how many lessons were received,\nregardless of whether they were CTB or the control textbook\ncondition), and race/ethnicity. All the models were fitted by\nusing the pretreatment value as a covariate in the analyses of\nposttreatment (both posttest and follow-up) outcomes. Thus,\nin the estimated models, the treatment estimates represent\nthe treatment difference at the posttest from pretest. The\ntreatment-by-time interaction estimates represent treatment\nand control group difference in terms of the change from\nposttest to follow-up (Fitzmaurice, Laird, & Ware, 2004).\nAs shown in Table 5, there were strong short-term (i.e.,\nend of ninth grade) intervention effects on proabstinence atti-\ntudes, proabstinence beliefs, self-efficacy, commitment to\nabstinence, empowerment/hopefulness, intention to delay\nsex, and intention to wait until marriage, in both the total and\nTable 3.

There was no program effect on\nparent\u00adchild communication about abstinence and sex.\nTreatment effect sizes (Table 4) at posttest ranged from a low\nof 0.08 to a high of 0.34, indicating relatively small to medium\neffect sizes on some variables, at the short term. The odds\nratio of 1.43 was reported as the effect size for the binary\noutcome variable \"onset of sex,\" which can be interpreted to\nmean that virgins in the CTB program were nearly 1.5 times\nmore likely to delay the onset of sex than virgins in the con-\ntrol group at the posttest measurement. As described below,\nhowever, these effects did not last over the longer term.\nAs shown in Table 5, all significant treatment-by-time\ninteraction effects had a negative sign compared with the\ntreatment effect, except on proabstinence attitudes, which\ndid not have a significant interaction effect. This indicates\nthat by the 10th-grade follow-up, all but one of the treatment\neffects had significantly diminished.2\nWith respect to sexual onset, there was a short-term effect\nof treatment among those who were virgins at pretest. The\nstatistical model (Table 5) indicates that treatment had a pos-\nitive effect to \"onset of sex,\" indicating that the virgins in\nCTB group were more likely to delay sex than the virgins in\nthe control group, when controlling for gender, baseline\ncommitment to abstinence, dosage, and race/ethnicity at the\nposttest measurement.\nThe treatment-by-time interaction analysis, however,\ndemonstrated that the program effect on sexual onset was not\nsustained at the long-term follow-up. In addition, lesson dos-\nage (whether of the CTB program or the textbook lessons)\nand baseline commitment were significant predictors of sex-\nual onset, at both short and longer term follow-up.\nAmong students who had already had sex by the time of\nthe pretest, there were short-term treatment group differ-\nences on proabstinence beliefs and on intentions to \"return to\nTable 4.

More specifically, analy-\nses controlling for gender, age, race/ethnicity, pretest scores,\nand baseline commitment to abstinence, among virgin stu-\ndents, yielded significant short-term treatment group effects\non intentions to remain abstinent, proabstinence attitudes,\nproabstinence beliefs, commitment to maintaining absti-\nnence, self-efficacy to set and communicate boundaries in\nrelationships, and sense of power in reaching future goals.\nAmong the sexually active group, there were significant\nshort-term program effects on beliefs and intentions only.\nAlthough the program did include parent\u00adchild homework\nactivities in an attempt to expand the school curriculum's\nreach to parents, there was no program effect on parent\u00ad\nchild communication about abstinence and sex among either\nvirgin or sexually active students, suggesting the need to\nstrengthen efforts to directly engage parents.\nCTB students who were virgins at the pretest were nearly\n1.5 times more likely to delay onset of sexual behavior by\nthe end of the 9th grade, a difference, however, that was not\nsustained by the beginning of the 10th grade. CTB students\nwho had already had sex were more likely than the control\ngroup to report an intention to return to abstinence at the\nposttest, but there was no treatment group impact on time\nsince last sex, and the effect on intentions to return to absti-\nnence was not sustained by the 10th-grade follow-up.\nNotably, among these 9th graders, more than one in four\nreported that they had already had sex, reflecting significant\nrisks by the beginning of high school.\nThus, some of the study hypotheses were supported,\nwhereas others were not. Students in the CTB groups showed\nsignificantly greater increase in abstinence attitudes and\nbeliefs, intentions to maintain abstinence, and delay of sexual\nbehavior at the posttest. Hypotheses related to empowerment\nand parent communication, however, were not supported, and\nat the long-term follow-up, only the hypothesis regarding\nabstinence beliefs was supported, but not those related to\nother predictors, to intentions, or to sexual behavior. For\nthose that were supported, effect sizes were relatively small,\nbut these are consistent with other studies of abstinence pro-\nThe CTB program, when taught by professional staff,\nappeared to be more effective than a typical classroom text-\nbook-based program on ninth-graders' attitudes, beliefs,\nintentions, and behavior at the short-term posttest. The pro-\ngram's impact on proabstinence attitudes and commitment\nto abstinence for virgin students are notable. One longitudi-\nnal study of sexually abstinent adolescents found that con-\nservative values contributed to the ability of adolescents to\npersist in sexual abstinence (Blinn-Pike, Berger, Hewett, &\nOleson, 2004), and another suggested that holding a strong\ncommitment to abstinence may contribute to maintaining\nsexual abstinence (Buhi, Goodson, Neilands, & Blunt,\n2011). A study of virginity \"pledges\" (i.e., a formalized\ncommitment to remain abstinent until marriage) demon-\nstrated that, under certain very limited circumstances, ado-\nlescents who had taken an abstinence pledge remained\nvirgins longer than those who had not (Bearman & Bruckner,\n2001). These data suggested that virgin students in the pro-\ngram increased both proabstinence attitudes and commit-\nment to abstinence. Their relationship to intentions and\nbehavior, however, are not clear, as the short-term treatment\neffect on both intentions and sexual onset were not sustained\nat the longer term follow-up.\nStudents received a maximum of eight, 45-min sessions,\nfor both the CTB program and the regular textbook health\nlessons focused on abstinence in one school year. The CTB\nprogram, by design, is intended to be offered in a sequenced\nmultiyear format (Cook, 2009). Unfortunately, school dis-\ntricts are often unable to provide the entire scope and\nsequence in such multiyear programs, given pressures to ful-\nfill more mandates across primary academic participants\n(Tappe, Allensworth, & Grizzell, 2010). The lack of long-\nterm impact of the program may illustrate what is known\nabout the challenges of school-based health interventions,\nwhich may not last a sufficient number of hours, be rein-\nforced over multiple grade levels (Connell, Turner, & Mason,\n1985), and/or are not maintained in schools over time, to\nachieve sustained attitude and behavior change (Smith,\nRedican, & Olsen, 1992). The finding that higher dosage of\neither program was associated with some positive outcomes\nfurther suggests the importance of classroom time and rein-\nforcing messages, regardless of the approach.\nQuestions about the impact, positive or negative, of absti-\nnence education programs on students who are already sexu-\nally active have been raised in the literature (Santelli et al.,\nninth grade are not yet sexually active, nearly one in four of\nthis study population reported that they had already had sex\nby the time of the pretest. Among those students, the study\nfindings were limited to short-term abstinence beliefs. This\nstudy tested only the impact of the single-year CTB program\nin the ninth grade; thus, it did not address the potential cumu-\nlative impact of a program that is designed to begin in the\nsixth grade, when nearly 95% of students would not yet have\nLimitations\nThe study compared the CTB abstinence-focused curricu-\nlum taught by its own professional staff with a typical health\nclass textbook-based approach that contained lessons about\nabstinence, that is, the \"usual\" intervention in these high\nschools. Thus, it was not an attempt to compare CTB with\nother philosophical or practical approaches, nor to make the\ncase for abstinence education overall.\nAn experimental study that included more schools was not\nfeasible, given the myriad challenges of school-based\nresearch, for example, concerns at the district level about ran-\ndomization, sensitivity of the subject matter, that is, sex, and\nlimited instructional time, thereby creating hesitancy to use\nclassroom time for survey research. The study used the most\nfeasible design, randomization at the school level, involving\ntwo districts with supportive administrators who agreed to\nmaintain two schools as control schools for the duration of\nthe study. This design eliminated the threat of contamination\nwithin schools, and the schools' level of cooperation resulted\nin a study in which treatment groups and protocols were suc-\ncessfully maintained. The analyses took clustering into\naccount, as a way to address randomization by school, but the\ntotal number of school units was still relatively low. The com-\nplexity and cost of including large numbers of units (i.e.,\nschools) in randomized studies is a significant challenge and\nlimitation of most school-based research.\nBaseline and follow-up data were collected at the begin-\nning and end of the school year, at the same time for all study\nparticipants. Students in the study, however, took ninth-grade\nhealth in either the fall or spring. They were scheduled for\nfall or spring health class by computer; thus, there were no\nsystematic demographic or academic differences that might\nbe associated with sexual behavior variables between stu-\ndents who received the program in the fall or spring. This\nmethod resulted in high rates of survey completion among\neligible students and also accounted for maturational differ-\nences between students who had health in the fall or the\nspring of ninth grade. The scheduling did result, however, in\nvarying follow-up periods, with posttests ranging from 3\nmonths for those who had health in the spring semester to 6\nmonths for those who had it in the fall. Consequently, longer\nterm follow-up was a range of 7 to 10 months. Ultimately,\nthe ability to gather more data and to control for maturation\nby conducting all surveys at the same points was considered\nby the researchers to outweigh the disadvantage of the vari-\nable follow-up periods. This is, however, a significant limita-\ntion of the study and makes estimation of the length of time\nthat the program impact \"lasts\" nearly impossible.\nBehavioral data were limited to self-reports, as most stud-\nies of this type. Monitoring pregnancies within each of the\nschool districts would have offered additional objective infor-\nmation. Furthermore, questions about contraception and con-\ndom use among students who were already having sex were\nnot able to be asked. Both the intervention and the study,\nitself, were relatively short term, following students who had\nreceived a maximum of eight class sessions in the ninth grade\nthrough the beginning of tenth grade. Thus, if generalized,\napplication of the findings must be limited to single-year pro-\ngrams and relatively short-term outcomes, and within com-\nmunities that are already supportive of an abstinence\neducation approach, as these study school districts were.\nConclusion\nIn a randomized study design, with schools as the unit of\nrandomization, the study demonstrated that, in two commu-\nnities that supported and sought an abstinence-focused\napproach, CTB \"Journey\" resulted in significant short-term\nimpact on ninth-graders' commitment to abstinence, proab-\nstinence beliefs and attitudes, and intentions to remain absti-\nnent. Among pretest virgins, there was a lower onset of\nsexual intercourse by the end of ninth grade. Among stu-\ndents already sexually active, there was a short-term treat-\nment effect on intentions, but not sexual behavior. The study\nwas designed to determine the effectiveness of the CTB\nabstinence education curriculum, as compared with the typi-\ncal health textbook approach to discussion of abstinence. It\nwas not designed to study the overarching question of\nwhether abstinence education is more or less effective than\nother approaches. Rather, it was designed to test the effec-\ntiveness of this curriculum on a range of outcomes, within\ntwo communities that sought an abstinence message for their\nhigh school students and which were within a state that\nrequires an abstinence emphasis.\nAs educational theories and data demonstrate, long-term\nchanges in skills, attitudes, and behaviors are rarely achieved\nwith short-term approaches, but require repetition, reinforce-\nment, and increasing complexity. The CTB program was\ndesigned for developmentally phased and sequenced lessons in\nmultiple grades. This study measured a single-year's interven-\ntion only and demonstrated positive short-term effects on ninth\ngraders who were not yet sexually active. Future studies should\ninclude multiple years of intervention, beginning in earlier\ngrades, to determine if this particular abstinence program can\ndemonstrate a longer term impact on sexual activity.\n"
