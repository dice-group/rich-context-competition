    "abstract": "Abstract\nRecent years have witnessed an increase in members' use of lettermarks--letters written to the bureaucracy in an\neffort to secure federal funding for their districts. In spite of the vitriol that has been directed toward the practice, it is\nunclear whether lettermarks are even effective in aiding legislators' attempts at funneling dollars toward their districts.\nIn an effort to determine whether lettermarks \"work,\" we combined content analysis of letters sent by members to\nthe Department of Labor with data on monies awarded to particular districts through the Department of Labor from\nthe stimulus to investigate the relationship between letter writing and awards to members' districts. We find that,\nconditional on ideology, lettermarking can have an effect on the likelihood that a district received stimulus money\nthrough the Department of Labor. For most legislators, though, lettermarking does not appear to be an effective device\nfor securing federal dollars for their districts. This nuanced set of findings suggests that the bureaucracy may be sensitive\nto member ideology when deciding whether to fund certain projects. Given the limited time frame and scope of our data,\nthough, we urge researchers to continue to pursue this important line of inquiry.\n",

Under pressure from anti-spending\nwatchdog groups, though, members of Congress have\nincreasingly taken a pass on the pork barrel in recent years.\nWhile some in Congress have publicly decried such devel-\nopments as an abdication of Congress's responsibility to\nguard its spending power from executive encroachments,\nmany members have turned to other, more surreptitious,\nmeans of securing federal funding for pet projects. That is,\nmembers of Congress, including many of the most vocal\nopponents of particularistic spending, have taken to writing\nletters to bureaucratic agencies in an effort to fund specific\nThis practice, more colloquially known as \"letter-\nmarking,\" allows legislators to fly beneath the radar\nwhen it comes to bringing home federal monies, as they\nare able to outwardly give the appearance of opposing\nearmarks while at the same time privately lobbying for\nspending that benefits narrow interests within their dis-\ntricts.

Far from being a \"cattle prod to agency\nempirical work exists on the subject suggests that letter-\nmarks from members of Congress alone are not effective\nin securing particularistic outcomes for individual legisla-\ntors (Mills and Kalaf-Hughes, 2015; Mills, Kalaf-Hughes,\nand MacDonald, 2016). But existing evidence on this\npoint is drawn from one federal agency, the Federal\nAviation Administration (FAA), and employs one, partic-\nularly visible, measure of congressional success: the issu-\nance of a national interest exemption for control towers\nthat were marked for closure (Mills and Kalaf-Hughes,\nconsistent with a lettermarks \"do no harm\" or \"don't mat-\nter\" conclusion, the nature of these requests means that\nthey are likely very visible to organized interests, affected\nconstituents, and ultimately, voters. Furthermore, the\npotential impact of such exemptions on policy and jobs is\nboth regulatory and substantial. Consequently, while anal-\nysis of lettermarking is challenging due to the need for\nsystematic data on requests matched to awards or deci-\nsions, drawing more generalized inferences about the\neffectiveness of lettermarking on the basis of requests for\nexemption from FAA recommendations for tower clo-\nsures is difficult.\nBy contrast, the present study focuses on an outcome\nthat might very well go unnoticed by watchdog groups,\nunless, of course, the member chooses to advertise it: the\nreceipt of federal monies from the American Recovery and\nReinvestment Act (ARRA) as administered through the\nDepartment of Labor (DOL). Using content analysis of let-\ntermarks to the DOL obtained through a Freedom of\nInformation Act (FOIA) request by Cause of Action\nInstitute, coupled with data on the allocation of federal dol-\nlars from the stimulus, we endeavor in this brief paper to\nanswer a question that has dogged researchers for some\ntime: Are members of Congress successful in securing par-\nticularistic spending for their districts through the use of\nlettermarks? In the following section we describe the data\nand methods that we employ in our analysis and highlight\nour expectations. After detailing the results from a regres-\nsion model predicting the receipt of ARRA dollars from the\nDOL, we then go on to situate our findings within the nas-\ncent literature on lettermarking.\nData, methods, and expectations\nThe data used in this paper come from several sources.\nRecipient and agency spending data from the stimulus were\nobtained from quarterly reports from Recovery.gov--the\ngovernment's official website devoted to ARRA spending.1\nWe reduced this dataset just to the awards that were handed\ndown through the DOL. This was done so as to combine\nour federal awards data with content analysis of lettermarks\nthat were sent to the DOL over the period from February\nthe same time frame, further cutting it down to feature only\nawards administered by the DOL that could have possibly\nbeen awarded at the behest of a member (or members) of\nCongress. And while we cannot be certain that these files\nrepresent the complete universe of letters sent to the DOL\nfrom members of Congress throughout this time period,\nthey comprise the best evidence available to us at the cur-\nrent juncture, pending additional FOIA requests to other\ngovernment agencies.\nLettermarks sent to the DOL were coded for several\nitems, including whether the letter mentioned the ARRA,\nmentioned a particular dollar amount (and, if so, what that\namount was), and whether multiple legislators signed on to\nthe same letter. In total, 294 unique letters were content-\nanalyzed from 165 individual legislators. The number\neventually included in this study is smaller, however, as we\nfocus only on members of the US House in this study in an\neffort to be as precise as possible about our outcome varia-\nble of interest, as it is nearly impossible to determine\nwhether ARRA spending targeted toward, say, a congres-\nsional district in New York should also count as spending\ntargeted toward Senator Chuck Schumer. Focusing only on\nmembers of the US House leaves us with a total of 175 let-\nters from 124 different legislators.\nIn addition, information on members' partisan affilia-\ntions and ideological proclivities (as measured by\nDW-NOMINATE) was merged with our content analysis\nand data from the stimulus. We also included a measure of\ndistrict \"need\" as well--the percent unemployed in each\ndistrict (see also Mills and Kalaf-Hughes, 2015).3 This\nmeasure was culled from the US Census. The unit of analy-\nsis in the final dataset is the individual legislator, leaving us\nwith 446 total cases--the number of unique legislators who\nserved in the US House over the time period under investi-\ngation.4 As such, several of our content analysis items were\ncalculated in terms of counts (such as the number of letters\nto the DOL authored by a particular legislator over this time\nperiod) or proportions (for instance, the proportion of all\nletters that were co-authored by other legislators--typically\nan entire state delegation).\nThe dependent variable that we employ in the first part\nof our analysis is the natural log of the stimulus dollars\nreceived from the DOL by the legislator's district over the\nperiod under examination. We obtain the same basic results,\nNeiheisel and Brady 3\nthough, if we use a binary indicator of whether or not a\ndistrict received any awards from the stimulus through the\nDOL (results not shown). Our key independent variables\ninclude an indicator for whether a legislator wrote a letter to\nthe DOL requesting funds, a measure of legislator ideology,\nlegislator partisanship, and a series of interaction terms.\nWe include these interaction terms in an effort to explore\nthe possibility that the effect of lettermarks may be condi-\ntional on the ideological leanings of the legislator request-\ning funding from the DOL and his or her party. For much as\nthe effect of lettermarks appears to be conditioned by the\npreferences of the granting agency (Mills and Kalaf-\nHughes, 2015; Mills, Kalaf-Hughes, and MacDonald,\n2016), we expect the political leanings of a bureaucratic\nagency's principal--the president--to affect their willing-\nness to bend to pressure from legislators. Since the legisla-\ntive agendas of Democratic presidents typically fare better\namong more liberal members of Congress--Democrat and\nRepublican alike--we expect that the bureaucracy is more\nlikely to grant requests for funding from more liberal repre-\nsentatives. Doing so serves to reward members for their\nsupport of the president (or a promise of future support)\nand, in turn, provides legislators with the ability to credit-\nclaim (Grimmer, Messing, and Westwood, 2012).\nLegislators often highlight their ability to channel pub-\nlic dollars toward their own districts in their pursuit of re-\nbureaucracy to be more than happy to offer members\nopportunities to do so, conditional on their ideological\nleanings (Alexander, Berry, and Howell, 2016) and parti-\nsanship (Berry, Burden, and Howell, 2010; cf. Dynes and\nlar, we might expect pleas for stimulus dollars from liberal\nDemocrats to be especially effective at seeing results.\nIdeological extremity is often punished at the polls (Canes-\nWrone, Brady, and Cogan, 2002), and ideologically\nextreme members of the majority party may see more in\nthe way of credit-claiming opportunities funneled their\ndirection in an effort to compensate them for any possible\nlosses that they might incur from assembling a voting\nrecord that is reliably liberal in nature (see, for instance,\nCarroll and Kim, 2010). While ideological purism from\nco-partisans in Congress is likely a boon to the administra-\ntion's legislative agenda, victories in the legislative arena\ncan only be sustained if the president's core supporters\nkeep their jobs in the next election. Alternatively, the exec-\nutive may have simply sought to reward good partisans for\ntheir loyalty when they saw it fit to ask for something over\nwhich the bureaucracy held dominion.\nAs for our expectations regarding specific features of\nthe letters themselves that might track with the receipt of\nstimulus dollars, it seems likely that several might matter.\nIn particular, we suspect that mentioning a specific mone-\ntary amount should correlate with the amount received\ngiven the voluminous literature on policy implementation\nthat points to specificity as a key determinant of bureau-\ncratic compliance (Huber and Shipan, 2002; Van Horn and\nVan Meter, 1977). Bureaucrats may be unwilling to write\nmembers a blank check for initiatives in their district, but\ndiscrete amounts that are (presumably) coupled with more\ndetailed plans for the funds are likely to be effective. The\nnumber of legislators signing on to a particular letter may\nalso serve as a heuristic for bureaucrats who are seeking to\ndetermine the support for particular initiatives, thereby\nincreasing the possibility that funds will be allocated for\nsuch a purpose.\nResults\nIn testing our expectations we began by estimating a model\npredicting the logged dollars received by a representative's\ndistrict through the DOL from stimulus funds. Table A1 in\nthe online Appendix displays estimates from this model,\nwhich includes measures of party, ideology, and district\nneed in addition to a series of interaction terms. It is impor-\ntant to note that we cannot reject the null that lettermark-\ning, in isolation, has no effect on the receipt of stimulus\ndollars. The inclusion of a triple interaction necessitates,\nthough, that we visually inspect the substantive effect of\nlettermarking, conditional on both party and ideology\n(Brambor, Clark, and Golder, 2005). Figure 1 therefore\ndisplays the marginal effect of writing a letter to the DOL\nover the observed range of DW-NOMINATE for both\nRepublican and Democratic members. For Republicans,\nwriting a letter to the DOL has no discernible effect on the\namount of money that they received through the DOL from\nthe stimulus (see the right panel in Figure 1). While the\neffect of letter writing is not statistically significant (with\n90 percent confidence intervals) throughout the observed\nrange of DW-NOMINATE for Republicans, the overall\npattern suggests that those who lobbied the bureaucracy\nfor funds actually did worse than those who did not. We\nare reluctant, however, to suggest that the bureaucracy\nmay punish conservative legislators who request money\nfor their districts via lettermarking. Rather, we suspect that\nRepublican (GOP) members of the House who engaged in\nsuch activities were attempting to overcome some kind of\na deficit by contacting the DOL about the need to fund\nprojects in their districts.\nOn the Democratic side of things (see the left panel in\nFigure 1), it appears that lettermarking had a positive and\nstatistically significant (p<0.1) effect on the receipt of funds\nthrough the DOL from the stimulus, but only for extreme\nliberals. Democratic members who engaged in lettermark-\ning and are -0.5 or lower on our measure of ideology (scores\nthat correspond with more liberal roll call voting records)\nreceived more ARRA dollars than did similarly situated\nDemocrats who did not write a letter to the DOL. Although\nthe effect is not statistically significant, the pattern dis-\nplayed in Figure 1 suggests that more moderate Democrats\n4 Research and Politics \nwho wrote a letter to the DOL actually received less money\nthan other moderate Democratic members who did not\nattempt to lobby the bureaucracy. This result mimics the\npattern observed among GOP members. Our results there-\nfore demonstrate that only liberal Democrats--those who\nare the most likely to support the president's legislative\nagenda--reaped any benefit from contacting the bureau-\ncracy in an effort to secure a slice of the federal pie for their\nconstituents. Although we do not show them here, these\nsame basic results obtain when we substitute raw\nDW-NOMINATE scores for the ideological distance\nbetween each member and the estimated ideology of the\nDOL under Obama--as calculated by Chen and Johnson\n(2015). That is to say that Democratic legislators to the left\nof the DOL were the only ones who appear to have benefit-\nted from engaging in lettermarking.6\nControlling for district partisanship (as proxied by the\nDemocratic share of the vote for president in the previous\nelection) pushes even this conditional effect into the realm\nof statistical insignificance (results not shown). Thus, while\nthere is some evidence that lettermarking \"works\" when\nundertaken by liberal Democrats, on balance, our results\nsuggest that, for most members across both sides of the\naisle, letter writing was epiphenomenal or served some\nother interest beyond securing dollars. Still, the presence of\na marginal effect for the most loyal Democrats is worthy of\nadditional research, if and when additional lettermarking\ndata were to be available as a means to analyze vote trading,\npartisan reward, and/or bureaucratic bias in conjunction\nwith the distribution of federal discretionary grants.\nBut are there any features of lettermarks that make them\nespecially effective? Using measures constructed from the\ncontent analysis described above, we estimated a model\npredicting the (logged) funds received from the stimulus\n(via the DOL) using data on only those members who wrote\nat least one letter. Results from this model are displayed in\nTable A2 in the online Appendix. What is striking about\nthis segment of the analysis is that remarkably few features\nof the letters that the members sent to the DOL have any\ndiscernible impact on the receipt of stimulus awards.\nConsistent with the patterns displayed in Figure 1, legisla-\ntor ideology is statistically significant (p<0.05), with more\nconservative members of the House receiving fewer stimu-\nlus dollars throughout the period under observation. But\nonly one feature of members' letters correlates with the\namount received from the ARRA. The proportion of mem-\nbers' letters that mentioned a particular dollar amount is a\npositive and statistically significant (p=0.05) predictor of\nthe amount allocated to their district. Specificity, it seems,\npays dividends when it comes to lettermarking.7\nOf course, this finding squares with a broader constella-\ntion of results from earlier studies exploring principal-agent\nrelationships across a range of different contexts. Boyd\n(2015), for instance, finds that federal district judges are\nmore likely to change their behavior in response to specific,\nunambiguous signals from their direct principal--circuit\nFigure 1. The effect of lettermarking on members' awards conditional on ideology and party.\nNeiheisel and Brady 5\ncourt judges. Similarly, the literature on policy implemen-\ntation suggests that \"policy precision,\" to use Huber and\nShipan's (2002) terminology, is a powerful tool that legisla-\ntors can use to exert control over the bureaucracy. Along\nthese same lines, Van Horn and Van Meter (1977) maintain\nthat bureaucratic compliance with the policy standards set\nforth by their principals requires that legislators communi-\ncate their expectations with a level of clarity that promotes\neffective policy implementation. Effective communication\nof what, exactly, they would like to see in the form of dis-\nbursements from the DOL through their letters appears to\nhave aided legislators in their pursuit of credit-claiming\nopportunities.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nAlthough our study is limited in scope to a short timeframe\nand draws upon evidence from a single entity within the\nbureaucracy, the findings outlined in this brief note build\nupon existing research on lettermarking and effectively\nqualify normative critiques of the practice that have charac-\nterized communications from legislators as having undue\ninfluence on the bureaucracy. By analyzing a different pol-\nicy area across a broader range of potential projects, our\nanalysis takes a significant step forward in advancing our\nunderstanding of lettermarks as a replacement for earmarks\nin an era that is increasingly characterized by Congress's\nwillingness to delegate authority over the power of the\npurse to the president and the federal bureaucracy.\nWe find that lettermarks can be effective when they\ninclude specific details such as a dollar amount.\nFurthermore, the effect of lettermarking is conditioned by\npolitical attributes of the legislator making the request--\nsuch as partisanship and ideology. It therefore appears that\nthe bureaucrats responsible for doling out federal funds are\nsensitive to the ideological leanings of legislators as they\ngo about making decisions about which districts receive\nawards (see also Alexander, Berry, and Howell, 2016). That\nthe effectiveness of lettermarking may be moderated by\npolitical factors (notably increasing toward the direction of\nthe president) mirrors some of the politics of earmarks\nwhere the victors get the spoils and the loyalists get even\nmore. This suggests, consistent with other recent work by\nMills and colleagues (2016), that the bureaucracy is now\nthe ultimate arbiter of (to channel Lasswell) who gets what,\nwhen, and how. Even though certain members of Congress\nmay be able to guide the process from time to time, it\nappears that the bureaucracy is very much in the driver's\nseat when it comes to the distribution of stimulus dollars.\nAs such, if Congress wishes to assert control over the purse\nstrings, then a return to good old-fashioned earmarking\nmay be necessary.\nIn closing, then, it is important to note that most legisla-\ntors do not appear to have benefitted from writing letter-\nmarks to the bureaucracy. This raises the question, of\ncourse, of why members across the partisan and ideological\nspectrum engage in such efforts. In his seminal work,\nregarding their efforts at providing particularized benefits\nto their constituents must be credible. The existence of let-\nters to the bureaucracy requesting funds or special consid-\neration for pet projects in their home districts likely afford\nlegislators with a measure of credibility in this arena, even\nin cases in which their actions were not determinative. As\nsuch, lettermarks may provide members with ample credit-\nclaiming opportunities in the absence of a direct linkage\nbetween their actions and the geographic targeting of fed-\neral dollars (see also Grimmer, Messing and Westwood,\n2012). We therefore urge future researchers to continue\npursuing this line of inquiry.\n"
