Parents have a distinct investment\nin grown children reflecting decades of child rearing. This\nstudy drew on the developmental stake hypothesis, which\nposits that parents are more invested in their grown children\nthan children are in parents (Giarrusso, Feng, & Bengtson,\noffspring as extensions of themselves, even after their\nchildren are grown (Levitzki, 2009). As such, parents may\nexperience lower well-being when grown children suffer\nproblems. Likewise, parents may experience increased\nwell-being when children are successful.\nFurther, we considered multiple children. Although fer-\ntility rates have dropped in the past 50 years, most parents\nin the United States have more than one child (Hagestad &\nUhlenberg, 2007). Yet, most studies of parental well-being\nhave examined only one grown child (e.g., Knoester, 2003;\nThe few studies addressing problems and successes have\nasked about children in general, rather than considering\nwithin-family patterns (Pillemer & Suitor, 1991; Ryff, Lee,\nEssex, & Schmutte, 1994). Parental well-being may vary\ndepending on whether one child or all children suffer problems,\nwhether some are successful, or all offspring are successful.\nGrown Children's Problems and Successes and Parental\nWell-being\nWe tested two models regarding multiple grown chil-\ndren's problems and successes: (a) an exposure model and\n(b) a cumulative stress and rewards model. The exposure\nmodel implies that having even one problem-ridden or suc-\ncessful child may evoke emotional reactions associated\nwith parental well-being. The cumulative model suggests\nthat having a greater number of problems or successes in the\nfamily will show an incremental association with better or\nworse parental well-being.\nOffspring problems.--Due to their investment in off-\nspring, parents may be distressed when offspring incur dif-\nficulties. Prior studies have found associations between\nOnly as Happy as the Least Happy Child: Multiple Grown\nChildren's Problems and Successes and Middle-aged\nParents' Well-being\nKaren L.

Middle-aged parents' well-being may be tied to successes and failures of grown children. Moreover, most\nparents have more than one child, but studies have not considered how different children's successes and failures may be\nassociated with parental well-being.\nMethods. Middle-aged adults (aged 40\u00ad60; N = 633) reported on each of their grown children (n = 1,384) and rated\ntheir own well-being. Participants indicated problems each child had experienced in the past two years, rated their chil-\ndren's successes, as well as positive and negative relationship qualities.\nResults. Analyses compared an exposure model (i.e., having one grown child with a problem or deemed successful)\nand a cumulative model (i.e., total problems or successes in the family). Consistent with the exposure and cumulative\nmodels, having one child with problems predicted poorer parental well-being and the more problems in the family, the\nworse parental well-being. Having one successful child did not predict well-being, but multiple grown children with\nhigher total success in the family predicted enhanced parental well-being. Relationship qualities partially explained\nassociations between children's successes and parental well-being.\nDiscussion. Discussion focuses on benefits and detriments parents derive from how grown progeny turn out and\nparticularly the implications of grown children's problems.\nKey Words: Family--Grown children--Middle age--Midlife--Stress--Well-being.\noffspring's problems and poorer parental well-being (e.g.,\nGreenfield & Marks, 2006; Milkie, Bierman, & Schieman,\nstudies, researchers have assessed negative events in off-\nspring's lives such as illnesses, emotional problems, di-\nvorce, problems with the law, and financial or employment\nissues. Detrimental life events lead to increased worry and\ndepressive feelings among parents (Hay, Fingerman, &\nLefkowitz, 2007), perhaps in part because they violate pa-\nrental desire to see children in a positive light. Likewise,\noffspring's distress as a result of difficult life circumstances\nmay affect parents' well-being. Knoester (2003) found\nthat children's psychological distress led, over time, to an\nerosion of parents' well-being.\nMoreover, parents may experience greater distress when\noffspring's problems may be due to their own behaviors or\nlifestyle, as opposed to less controllable physical or emo-\ntional situations (Birditt, Fingerman, & Zarit, 2010; Pillemer\nexample, parents may deem problems with the law or drug\nand alcohol addiction as more controllable, thus evoking dis-\nappointment and anger. Physical and emotional difficulties\nsuch as health problems, developmental disabilities, or psy-\nchopathology may evoke empathetic distress but less blame.\nThe exposure model suggests that even one child with\nproblems may diminish parental well-being as in the apho-\nrism, \"A mother is only as happy as her least happy child.\"\nThis model is consistent with the premise that negative\nemotions are more intense and exert greater influence on\nwell-being than positive emotions (Baumeister, Bratslavsky,\nFinkenauer, & Vohs, 2001). Even one child suffering a\nproblem may dampen parental well-being, particularly if\nthe problem arises from the child's own behaviors (Pillemer &\nThe cumulative model is derived from theories of stress\nthat suggest individuals may weather a single stress suc-\ncessfully but find it increasingly difficult to cope when mul-\ntiple challenges accumulate (Pearlin, Pioli, & McLaughlin,\n2001). Based on this theory, we predicted parents with a\ngreater number of problematic children would have lower\nwell-being than parents with fewer problematic children\nOffspring success.--By contrast, due to parents' invest-\nment in their children, parental well-being may benefit from\ngrown children's achievements. Successful offspring may\nmake parents feel they did a good job raising them (Ryff\net al., 1994). Parents may bask in their children's accom-\nplishments. Successful offspring also provide support to their\nmiddle-aged parents (Fingerman, Miller, Birditt, & Zarit,\n2009) and are expected to provide assistance in the future\nwhen parents experience declines of old age (Pillemer &\nPrior studies of offspring's achievements have taken two\napproaches to measurement. Some studies have examined\nattainment of adult roles (e.g., marriage, employment) as\nindicators of achievement (Fingerman, Chen, Hay, Cichy, &\nstudies, however, have used parental assessments of off-\nspring's successes (e.g., Birditt et al., 2010; Cichy, Finger-\nYoung adults may be working to attain adult roles, and thus,\nobjective indicators do not assess their potential for eventual\nsuccess (e.g., an 18-year-old may be pursuing education).\nParents' appraisals of grown children's successes may\nbetter incorporate future potential than do objective indica-\ntors especially among offspring aged 18\u00ad23 (Fingerman\net al., 2009). Here, we used parental appraisals of offspring\nachievement.\nWith regard to multiple children, consistent with the\nexposure model, one successful child may give a parent\nbragging rights, provide support, or render a sense of ac-\ncomplishment that enhances well-being. Having many suc-\ncessful grown children may enhance these effects.\nAlternately, due to ceiling effects on measures of well-being,\na plateau may occur whereby parental well-being is not\nimproved by more children with more successes.\nMixture of children with problems and successes.--We\nalso examined the mix of children suffering problems or\ndeemed particularly successful in the family. Family mem-\nbers often share socioeconomic backgrounds associated\nwith problems and success (Grundy, 2005). Thus, a parent\nwho has one child suffering a problem may have other chil-\ndren who suffer problems. Alternately, siblings' attempt to\ndifferentiate themselves from their brothers and sisters may\nlead to differences in achievement or problems among sib-\nlings in the same family (Conley, Pfeiffer, & Velez, 2007;\nSulloway, 1996). Thus, we examined whether children in\nfamilies are similar to or different from one another with\nregard to successes and problems (e.g., all children suffer\nproblems, all have successes, or there is a mixture in the\nfamily).\nLikewise, we were interested in whether a successful\nchild mitigates effects of children who suffer problems on\nparental well-being. This issue has not been investigated but\nhaving a successful child may reaffirm one's ability as a\nparent, support the sibling with problems, or mitigate dele-\nterious effects of the child who suffers problems. We exam-\nined possible moderating effects of successful children in\nthe same family as children who suffer problems.\nRelationship Qualities With Grown Children Who Suffer\nProblems or Incur Success\nThe second goal of this study was to assess whether rela-\ntionship qualities explain associations between grown chil-\ndren's successes and problems and parental well-being.\nChildren engulfed in their own problems may generate con-\nflict. Milkie and colleagues (2008) found that parents who\nreported their children had problems also reported being\npoorly treated by children. Another study found parents ex-\nperienced more negative feelings in relationships with off-\nspring suffering problems (Birditt et al., 2010). Offspring\nwho incur problems also evoke greater ambivalence for par-\nwe predicted parents with children who suffer problems\nwould report poorer well-being, in part because parents ex-\nperience more conflict and negative emotions with these\noffspring.\nWe also considered positive feelings in the relationship.\nOur prior research suggests parents experience comparable\nfeelings of affection for children who suffer problems and\nwho incur successes (Birditt et al., 2010). Other studies sug-\ngest parents have more positive relationships with grown\nchildren who have achieved normative markers of adult-\nhood (Suitor et al., 2007) and who are deemed successful\n(Fingerman et al., 2009). Thus, affectionate ties or positive\nquality relationships may help explain why successful chil-\ndren would be associated with better parental well-being.\nAdditional Factors Associated with Relationships Between\nAdults and Their Parents\nIn examining the models, we considered family size.\nLarger families may be more likely to provide support for\nthe exposure model because the probability of having at\nleast one child with a problem or perceived as successful is\ngreater in larger families. Family size also has implications\nfor the cumulative model; the total number of problems or\nsuccesses is greater in larger families. Studies have included\nnumber of children as a control variable and found contra-\ndictory associations with parental well-being (Koropoeckyj-\nand considered possible moderating effects of family size\non patterns of association.\nMiddle-aged parents have relationships with grown chil-\ndren spanning from late adolescence to early midlife them-\nselves. Children of different ages may have different\nimplications for parental well-being. For example, parents\nmay habituate to older offspring's problems or successes.\nThus, younger offspring might have a greater impact on\nwell-being because their problems or successes have long-\nterm implications for their future. Alternately, parents may\nview offspring in young adulthood as malleable and may be\nless affected by what they view as transient problems or\nsuccesses. We examined offspring's age as a possible mod-\nerating variable on patterns in this study.\nWe also included covariates that might account for paren-\ntal well-being. Some studies find mothers' well-being is\nmore susceptible to grown children's successes and prob-\nbut other studies have found offspring affect mothers and\nPillemer & Suitor, 1991). We included parental gender\nwithout a specific hypothesis. Parental marital status also\nmay play a role in patterns of association. Parents who are\nmarried typically rate their spouse as their most important\nsocial contact, but unmarried parents rate their children as\ntheir most important contacts (Fingerman, Hay, & Birditt,\n2004). Socioeconomic status indicators such as household\nincome and education are associated with well-being\n(Farmer & Ferraro, 2005). We also considered race because\noffspring problems have been found to exert a greater effect\non African American than White parents (Milkie et al.,\n2008). Finally, because families may share stressful circum-\nstances (Greenfield & Marks, 2006), we controlled for\nproblems in the parents' own lives to ascertain whether their\nchildren's problems contributed to their well-being.\nIn sum, this study examined problems and successes of\nmultiple children and parental well-being. We compared (a)\nthe exposure model (i.e., having one child with a success or\nproblem) and (b) the cumulative model (i.e., multiple chil-\ndren with multiple problems and successes). The literature\ndoes not provide a basis for favoring one model. Using\nthese models, we expected parents with children who incur\nproblems to report more negative relationship quality and\nnegative relationship qualities to be associated with parents'\npoorer well-being. We predicted the opposite pattern for\nsuccessful grown children.\nMethod\nThe sample included adults aged 40\u00ad60 from the Family\nExchanges Study who had at least one child older than 18\nyears and who resided in the Philadelphia Primary Metro-\npolitan Statistical Area, covering urban, suburban, and rural\nareas (Pennsylvania State Data Center, 2001). Potential par-\nticipants were identified via purchased listed samples and\nrandom digit dialing within regional area codes. Partici-\npants completed computer-assisted telephone interviews\nregarding their well-being and relationships with grown off-\nhouseholds with landlines (Blumberg & Luke, 2008).\nSample Description\nParticipant characteristics.--Table 1 includes back-\nground information regarding participants and their grown\nchildren. By oversampling high-density minority neigh-\nborhoods, we obtained a diverse sample; 31% of the sam-\nple identified themselves as African American and 6% as\nmultiracial.\ntal status; and household income in 2007 coded as 1 (less\non income to the general population of the Philadelphia area\n5 (excellent), participants rated their health as good to very\nOffspring characteristics.--On average, participants had\nFor each child older than 18 years (N = 1,384), participants\nreported background characteristics, problems, and support.\nTo avoid fatigue, we asked participants detailed information\n(i.e., success, relationship qualities) for up to three grown\nchildren. Most participants (n = 555, 88%) had three or\nfewer children. For the 12% of participants with four or\nmore grown children, we selected the child who received\nmost assistance, least assistance, and a random child.\nBecause this study focused on parental well-being, we\naggregated offspring characteristics within parents prior to\nexamining descriptive information about the offspring.\nThus, characteristics of offspring in larger families did not\nbias the descriptive data. As can be seen in Table 1, off-\nilies with more than one child, 25% had all daughters, 31%\nhad all sons, and 44% had a mix of sons and daughters.\nIndependent Variables\nLife problems scales.--Drawing on techniques in other stud-\nies to assess life problems, we asked participants whether\nTable 1.

We then coded each problem dichotomously (0,\n1) for each child. Drawing on prior research (Pillemer et al.,\nphysical and emotional problems and lifestyle or behavioral\nproblems (Birditt et al., 2010). Physical and emotional\nproblems included developmental delay, physical disability,\nhealth problem or injury, and psychological problems. Life-\nstyle\u00adbehavior problems included trouble with the law,\ndrinking or drug problems, financial difficulties, divorce, or\nserious relationships problems. We asked about being a vic-\ntim of a crime, but this item did not load on either scale in\nconfirmatory factor analysis. We also generated a total scale\ncombining the two subscales. We also had reports of these\nproblems for a subset of parents (n = 399) whose family\nmembers also participated in the study.\nOffspring achievements.--Participants rated each child's\nachievement compared with adults the same age for (a)\nrelationships and family life and (b) education and career\nfrom 1 (less successful) to 5 (more successful). These two\nitems were derived from a study using open-ended re-\nsponses regarding offspring's achievements (Ryff et al.,\n1994). The measure was parsimonious to allow parents to\ncomplete it for each child. These parental ratings corre-\nspond to actual achievements for offspring older than 24\nyears (Fingerman et al., 2009). See Table 2 for the distribu-\ntion of offspring's problems and successes by family.\nRelationship qualities with offspring.--As in prior stud-\nies, we assessed positive qualities of the relationship using\ntwo items (how much does he/she make you feel loved and\ncared for, how much does he/she understand you) and nega-\ntive relationship qualities using two items (how much does\nhe/she criticize you or make demands on you) rated from 1\n(not at all) to 5 (a great deal; Birditt et al., 2010; Fingerman\nDependent Variable: Parental Well-being\nUsing procedures based on World Health Organization\nrecommendations and prior studies, we devised a composite\nscore for psychological well-being (Antonucci, Ajrouch, &\nnization Quality of Life Group, 1998). The score combined\na standardized one-item assessment of life satisfaction\n(Diener, Gohm, Suh, & Oishi, 2000), rated from 1 (not at\nall satisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied) and the five-\nitem depression scale from the Brief Symptom Inventory\nWe reverse coded the depression scale prior to estimating z\nscores, such that higher scores represent better psychological\nwell-being.\nCovariates\nWe included covariates coded as follows: gender 1\n(father), 0 (mother); age in years; marital status 1 (married\nor remarried), 0 (not married); years of education; income\nminority status 1 (ethnic or racial minority), 0 (non-Hispanic\nWhite); and number of children in the family. Because we\nonly obtained parental problems for a subset of parents, we\ncontrolled for parental problems in post hoc analyses.\nAnalytic Strategy\nWe first examined the distribution of children's successes\nand problems. Then, we assessed effects of multiple grown\nchildren on parental well-being with regard to the exposure\nand the cumulative stress model. Choices in aggregating\nmultiple children have theoretical as well as statistical im-\nplications. We considered (a) an exposure model, using the\nmetric of the presence of one child suffering problems or\ndeemed successful, and (b) cumulative stress and rewards\nmodel, using the metric of the total sum of problems or the\ntotal success scores across all children in the family. Consis-\ntent with other studies of multiple grown children (e.g.,\nWard, 2008), we used ordinary least squares (OLS) regres-\nsion to examine associations among these metrics (e.g., to-\ntal number of problems) and parental well-being.\nWe conducted analyses to assure that family size did not\nbias results. Analyses included two tests of whether family\nsize moderates associations between children's problems\nand successes and parental well-being: (a) regression mod-\nels with interaction terms between family size and problems\nor successes and (b) separate regression models for families\nwith one grown children versus multiple grown children.\nWe also estimated the exposure models in a stratified man-\nner by family size, including a weight for the probability of\nhaving a child with a problem or deemed successful.\nFinally, we first tested hypotheses regarding children's\nproblems by examining behavioral\u00adlifestyle problems versus\nhealth and emotional problems in separate models. The\npattern of findings was identical for the two types of prob-\nlems. Thus, we did not differentiate types of problems further.\nResults\nDistributions of Successes and Problems\ngrown child suffered one or more problems in the prior two\nyears. The proportion of parents who had a grown child\nwho was above average in success (i.e., 4 or 5 on ratings of\nNext, we looked at these ratings with regard to each child.\nOverall, parents indicated 45% of their offspring had expe-\nrienced at least one problem in the prior year and rated\n43.4% of their offspring as more successful than others the\nsame age.\nGiven these findings, a median split offered a mathemat-\nically simple and face-valid means of dividing grown chil-\ndren as high or low on problems and successes. For\nproblems, the median fell at 1 problem. The median split\nfell between 3 and 4 on each success item.\nUsing this split, we examined the distributions of chil-\ndren suffering problems and success within the same fami-\nlies. Distributions for the 633 parents were as follows: (a)\nall children above average in success and none suffering\nproblems (n = 106, 17%), (b) all children suffering at least\none problem and none above average on success (n = 96,\n15%), (c) a mixture of children suffering problems or\ndeemed successful (n = 382, 60%), or (d) no children in the\nupper half for problems or success (n = 49, 8%).\nWe looked separately at parents who had two or more\ngrown children (n = 431) and thus had the possibility of\nboth a child deemed successful and a child with problems.\n(12%) had all successful children, 39 (9%) had all children\nsuffering problems, and only 13 (3%) had children with nei-\nther indicator. In sum, most parents with more than one\nchild reported a mix of problematic and successful children.\nChildren With Problems or Success and Parental\nWell-being\nTo test hypotheses regarding children's successes and\nproblems, we used OLS regression with the composite\nwell-being measure as the outcome. Table 3 presents the\ntests of the exposure and cumulative models for the associa-\ntion between child problems and parental well-being. Con-\nsistent with the exposure model, having even one child\nsuffering problems was associated with poorer well-being.\nConsistent with the cumulative stress model, a higher sum of\nproblems in the family was associated with poorer parental\nwell-being.\nTable 3 presents the test of the exposure and cumulative\neffect models for associations between children's success and\nparental well-being. Findings did not support the exposure\nmodel; simply having one successful child was not associ-\nated with parental well-being. Findings did support the\ncumulative model; parents who reported more children with\ngreater total success reported better well-being.\nWe then conducted analyses to examine whether associa-\ntions between children's problems and success and parental\nwell-being were consistent in analyses using family con-\nfiguration. We estimated a regression including the categor-\nical classification of families: (a) all successful children, (b)\na mixture of children deemed successful and children suf-\nfering problems, and (c) all children suffering problems.\nPost hoc tests for this categorical predictor revealed the\nthree groups significantly differed with regard to parents'\nwell-being. Participants who had all successful children re-\nported the highest level of well-being, followed by partici-\npants with a mix of children with success and problems, and\nparents whose children all suffered problems reported the\npoorest well-being, controlling for number of children and\nother variables.\nFinally, we tested the hypothesis that having a successful\nchild or multiple successes in the family buffers against del-\neterious effects of children with problems on parental well-\nbeing. We included interaction terms between children with\nsuccesses or problems: (a) presence of one or more children\nwith problem \u00d7 one or more children with success and (b)\ntotal number of problems \u00d7 total success scores within family.\nThese interaction terms were not significant.\nRelationship Qualities and Parental Well-being\nWe then examined whether relationship qualities may\nexplain why children with problems or success are associated\nwith parental well-being. We averaged negative relationship\nquality scores for children in each family and also consid-\nered the average of positive relationship quality scores for\nchildren within each family (e.g., Lowenstein, 2007).\nWe estimated four OLS regressions with average ratings\nof positive and negative relationship quality in the family as\nthe outcome variables. The metrics of problems and success\nfor the exposure and cumulative models (i.e., presence of\none child with problem or above median success, sum of\ntotal problems and success scores within the family) served\nas the predictors, and we included the control variables. For\nexample, we estimated a regression with average positive\nrelationship quality as the outcome and metrics for the\nexposure model (i.e., presence of at least one child with\na problem or one child above the median on success) as\npredictors. Then, we did the same for negative relationship\nquality.\nFor the exposure model, the presence of at least one prob-\nlematic or successful child did not predict positive relation-\nship quality. The total number of problems and success in\nthe family predicted both positive and negative relationship\nquality (see Table 4). Parents who had more problematic\nchildren and fewer successful children reported greater neg-\native and lower positive relationship quality.\nTable 3.

Positive and negative qualities of\nrelationships were associated with parental well-being, and\nthe effect of successful children was no longer significant\nand reduced in size in this model. Having children with\nproblems continued to be significantly associated with\nparental well-being (see Table 3).\nFamily Size and Parental Well-being\nWe conducted analyses to ascertain whether patterns of\nfindings differed as a function of family size. First, we con-\nsidered whether number of children moderates patterns of\nassociation. Treating family size as a continuous variable,\nwe centered the variables on their means and then estimated\ntwo interaction terms, number of children \u00d7 problems and\nnumber of children \u00d7 successes. We estimated regressions\nwith each of these interaction terms, including main effects\nand covariates. No significant interactions emerged, but the\nmain effects remained significant.\nWe also separated the sample into the following: (a) fam-\nilies with one child and (b) families with two or more chil-\ndren. When we examined these models, the effects remained\nsignificant.\nFinally, we estimated analyses regarding the exposure\nmodel to account for differing probabilities of having at\nleast one child with a problem or with a success. For ex-\nample, 45% of grown children had at least one problem. In\nfamilies with two children, the chance that at least one child\nhad a problem was 69%; in families with three children, the\nprobability jumps to 83%. For the exposure model, we reran\nanalyses stratifying by family size and weighting by the prob-\nability that at least one child had a problem (1 - pfamily size,\ni.e., 1 - .55family size for problems). The pattern of findings\nwas surprisingly robust, and significant effects remained for\nproblems and successes when analyses were estimated in\nthis manner.\nPost hoc Tests of Stability in Findings\nWe reestimated the models to assure findings were stable.\nWe repeated the models with other metrics to assure stabil-\nity of findings: (a) maximum scores within a family (e.g.,\nchild with the best and the worst relationship quality; Ward,\n2008), (b) total number of children in the family with a\nproblem or deemed successful. Findings were consistent\nacross metrics.\nWe also estimated the models for the 399 parents with\nreports on their own problems, controlling for the number\nof parent problems as a predictor. Parents' problems were\nsignificantly associated with their well-being in all analy-\nses, but offspring's problems and successes remained sig-\nnificant in each model as well.\nWe examined associations involving children's problems\nor success and parental well-being for different groups of\nparents. We estimated models separately for mothers and\nfathers, for White and minority families, for married and\nunmarried parents, and for families in which all the off-\nspring were younger than 24 years and for families in which\nat least one child was aged 24 or older. Again, findings were\nconsistent.\nDiscussion\nThis study contributes to a burgeoning literature indicating\nthe parent\u00adchild tie is associated with parents' well-being\nTable 4.

Importantly, there is considerable vari-\nability in parents' perceptions of their children's successes\nand problems within and between families, and these per-\nceptions are associated with parents' overall well-being. In\nparticular, children suffering problems appear to affect their\nparents' well-being, above and beyond the presence of suc-\ncessful children or their own problems.\nGrown Children With Problems or Deemed Successful\nPrior studies have suggested that parents' well-being\nsuffers when grown children incur problems with health,\nfinances, or other circumstances (Koropoeckyj-Cox, 2002;\ncontributes to that literature by assessing grown children's\naccomplishments as well as problems. Our findings suggest\nthat parents may react to their grown children's successes as\nwell as their failures, but as we discuss, only when suc-\ncesses in the family are cumulative.\nTo examine implications of grown children's successes\nand failures, we considered an exposure model and a cumu-\nlative model for the total number of problems or success\nscores for all children. Interestingly, different theoretical\nmodels apply when predicting parents' well-being, depend-\ning on whether we considered children's problems or suc-\ncesses. Consistent with the exposure model, having even\none problematic child is harmful to parents' well-being but\nhaving at least one successful child does not appear to have\nthe same effect. In line with the cumulative model, having\nmore grown children suffering a greater number of prob-\nlems was associated with poorer parental well-being. For\nsuccesses, only when parents had many children with high\nsuccess, did parental well-being fare better. Thus, it may be\ntrue that parents are only as happy as their least happy child.\nIndeed, these findings are consistent with theory regard-\ning negative emotions. Literature reviews have established\nthat negative experiences typically are more salient and\nmore difficult to emotionally regulate than positive experi-\nmore, studies find negative emotions tend to be of longer\nduration and to exert a stronger influence on well-being\nthan do positive emotions (Larsen, 2009). The general\nhuman tendency to be on the alert for negative events is\nevident in other relationships. In the marital tie, differences\nin negative interactions predict which couples will divorce,\nbut positive interactions do not (Karney & Bradbury, 1997;\nMarkman, Rhoades, Stanley, Ragan, & Whitton, 2010). At-\ntention to adverse events involving one's progeny may have\nserved evolutionary purposes for survival and persist after\nthose offspring are grown.\nThe difference in findings for problems and successes also\nmay reflect distinct measurement techniques. Consistent\nwith prior research, we assessed negative life events by ex-\namining children's problems (Greenfield & Marks, 2006;\nThe success ratings depended on subjective appraisals\nartifacts shaped the findings, however, we might expect\nsubjective appraisals of success to be more strongly associ-\nated with participant well-being than an objective list of\nproblems. Furthermore, in most families with more than one\ngrown child, parents rated children with successes and with\nproblems, suggesting parents were not rating offspring based\non their own psychological state. It is also notable that off-\nspring's problems and successes contributed to parental well-\nbeing controlling for their own problems. Nonetheless, future\nresearch might seek greater comparability in assessments.\nMoreover, our findings indicate the importance of con-\nsidering multiple children in a family on parental well-\nbeing (Ward, 2008). Having two children suffering problems\nwas more demanding than having only one child who suf-\nfers problems. We also ascertained that one successful child\ndoes not buffer effects of children suffering problems.\nRelationship Qualities With Grown Children\nConsistent with other studies (Fingerman et al., 2008;\nand negative qualities of relationships with grown children\nwere associated with parental well-being. Prior research re-\nvealed that parents experienced more negative quality rela-\ntionships with children suffering problems than with\nsuccessful children (Birditt et al., 2010), and poor quality\nrelationships were linked to diminished well-being (Milkie\net al., 2008). In this study, variations in relationship quality\naccounted for the effect of successful children on well-\nbeing but not the effect of children with problems. Parents\nmay feel proud and derive benefits from low conflict and\nhigh regard with successful grown children. Relationship\nquality may not explain diminished well-being when off-\nspring suffer problems because multiple factors lead to\npoorer well-being among these parents such as the drain on\ntheir resources, shameful interactions with other parents,\nand their own sense of failure as a parent.\nLimitations and Future Directions for Research\nWe recognize several limitations of the study that provide\nimportant directions for future research. The cross-sectional\ndesign and self-report nature of data may yield biases. Par-\nents who are higher in psychological well-being may view\ntheir offspring as more successful and may also report bet-\nter relationships, simply because they feel better about their\nlives. In addition, the study included a limited definition of\nwell-being, pertaining to parents' depressive symptoms and\nlife satisfaction. Indeed, although the regressions and pre-\ndictors were significant, the proportion of variance ac-\ncounted for in those analyses was small to modest. Studies\nthat incorporate a wider range of positive aspects of well-\nbeing, such as feelings of pride and self-acceptance, might\nfind stronger associations between offspring's successes\nand parental well-being. Moreover, longitudinal research is\nnecessary to verify causal ordering of parental well-being\nand offspring experiences.\nBy examining parents' perceptions of multiple children,\nthis study revealed that children have differential associa-\ntions with parents' well-being. This study examined chil-\ndren's successes as well as their problems. Children's\nsuccesses were associated with more positive and lower\nnegative relationship qualities, whereas children's problems\nwere associated with poorer quality relationships that may\ngenerate conflicts and stress for parents. Parental well-being\nreflected these combined factors across multiple children.\nPrevious studies have examined problems in the aggregate\nor parents' perceptions of one child. This study included\nmultiple grown children and helped substantiate that grown\nchildren's distress may be contagious. Grown children's\nproblems may harm parental well-being, even when other\nchildren in the family are thriving.\nFunding\nIntergenerational Transfers (K.
