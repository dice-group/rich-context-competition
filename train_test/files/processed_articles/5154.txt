We hypothesized that the illusive nature itself causes the increased\naesthetic and affective valence of illusions compared with their non-illusory counterparts. We created\npairs of stimuli. One qualified as a standard visual illusion whereas the other one did not, although\nthey were matched in as many perceptual dimensions as possible. The phenomenal quality of being\nan illusion had significant effects on \"Aesthetic Experience\" (fascinating, irresistible, exceptional,\netc), \"Evaluation\" (pleasant, cheerful, clear, bright, etc), \"Arousal\" (interesting, imaginative, complex,\ndiverse, etc), and \"Regularity\" (balanced, coherent, clear, realistic, etc). A subsequent multiple\nregression analysis suggested that Arousal was a better predictor of Aesthetic Experience than\nEvaluation. The findings of this study demonstrate that illusion is a phenomenal quality of the percept\nwhich has measurable aesthetic and affective valence.\n",

Psychologists\nhave been searching for cognitive principles or rules of illusory effects because illusions have been\nconsidered relevant for testing perceptual theories. Furthermore, people often become fascinated or\nmoved by various visual illusory effects, and it seems that such a visual experience is both perceptually\nand emotionally rewarding. This observation might be supported by the popularity of trompe l'oeil or\nillusion art.\nFor centuries the study of visual or aesthetic preference has focused on stimulus properties such as\nsymmetry, proportion, or complexity, which were regarded as determinants of preference that tended\nto yield agreement across individuals. However, recent approaches to visual aesthetics have argued\nagainst those classic ideas and have suggested a \"knowledge-based\" view of aesthetic preference,\nstressing the importance of subjective evaluative processes and semantic associations with visual\nstimuli. Furthermore, these studies have argued that cognitive and evaluative processes are intertwined\nIn recent studies cognitive factors, such as meaning, novelty, or semantic interpretability, have\nbeen regarded as more essential than perceptual factors in determining visual preference. This new\napproach to aesthetics advocates that proximal determinants of preferences are internal factors that\nreflect subjective and therefore inherently individual evaluations (Vessel and Rubin 2010). These\nevaluative meanings attributed or projected to the external world are referred to as \"subjective,\"\n\"connotative,\" or \"implicit.\" It is commonly opposed to denotative meaning, referred to as \"objective,\"\n\"referential,\" or \"explicit\" (objective properties such as angular, light, and wooden) (Jankovi in press).\nGiven this, we would argue that aesthetic processes do not necessarily involve evaluative processes\n113 Stevanov  J, Markovi S, Kitaoka A\nof artistic works alone, but can also be related to any object in the environment with which we are\ngreater qualitative diversity than everyday stimuli, incorporating syntactic (ie, stylistic) as well as\nsemantic (ie, subject matter) information. Others (Zeki 2002) argued that ambiguity is a highly prized\ncharacteristic of great art because it offers an observer the option of choosing from many alternatives.\nExactly like artworks, visual illusions can also be discussed in terms of ambiguity and qualitative\ndiversity. This leads us to propose that visual illusions possess aesthetic attributes common to any\nother aesthetic object.\nIn the 1970s, Berlyne suggested that stimulus attributes such as novelty, complexity, surprisingness,\nand incongruity (conflict) play a major role in aesthetic responses (Berlyne 1971; Cupchik and Berlyne\n1979). In addition, observers need to understand or resolve ambiguity. Silvia (2005a) claimed that\nonce observers understand the meaning of an observed object, their emotional interest becomes high,\nwhich elicits a strong Aesthetic Experience. Russell and Milne (1997; Russell 2003) have empirically\nproven that people enjoy modern art more if they grasp its meaning. Paintings accompanied by brief\ndescriptions were judged as easier to understand and also more enjoyable and interesting. In addition,\nBiederman and Vessel (2006) argued that the key concept for understanding human preference is the\nsubject's ability to understand the stimuli. Their findings indicate that repeated exposure to stimuli\nleads to increased pleasure (see Carbon 2011 for more discussion). This is related to the \"click\" of\ncomprehension (Biederman and Vessel 2006), often accompanied by an \"A-ha\" experience (see Van\nde Cruys and Wagemans 2011 for more discussion). In this study, we first examined the Aesthetic\nExperience and evaluative meaning of visual illusions (referred to as \"implicit features\" of visual\nillusions) by using dynamic stimuli that enable observers to discern the included illusions.\nImportance of \"surprisingness\" and \"incongruity\" in the aesthetic study of visual\nillusions\nThere was, in fact, a precursor in the area of the experimental aesthetics of visual illusions. Noguchi's\n(2003) study addressed aesthetic preference regarding several geometrical illusions, including the\nOppel\u00adKundt grid and concentric circles, Helmholtz radials, the Delboeuf illusion, the Morinaga\u00ad\nNoguchi illusion, the Ehrenstein figure, or the Kanizsa\u00adNoguchi square. His study revealed a strong\ncorrelation between affective and perceptual judgments. Strong affective preference occurred with\nstrong effects of illusion; thus, Noguchi suggested that aesthetic as well as perceptual processes should\nbe investigated. Furthermore, most of the stimuli Noguchi and his colleagues used (Noguchi 2003;\nYoshino et al 2009) were so simple that they were unlikely to be affected by additional meanings or\nlearned contexts.\nIn contrast, in the present study, we first selected much richer types of geometrical illusions as\nwell as other related illusory phenomena, such as ambiguous figures (eg, Rubin's vase profile or\nduck-rabbit) and impossible figures (eg, Penrose's triangle or M C Escher's drawings of impossible\nbuildings), as we assumed that certain properties of miscellaneous illusory effects could be closely\nrelated to Berlyne's (1965) concept of surprisingness and incongruity (conflict). As mentioned before,\nthese stimulus attributes considered by Berlyne are important aesthetic properties of objects that play\na major role in aesthetic responses. He defined surprisingness as a certain degree of uncertainty that\nexists when any number of alternative events occurs. Informational theory expresses uncertainty\nas a sum across alternatives, and its maximum is reached when a large number of alternatives are\nequally likely. For example, in understanding ambiguous figures, creative processes of a lower order\nare initiated. Observers need to consider only a limited number of alternative meanings that could\nbe attributed. Most observers primarily see only one, although additional explanation and guidance\nwould reveal other possible meanings. Other good examples would be the tasks of discovering a\nhidden meaning or a hidden figure within complex surroundings, eg, Dalmatians among rocks and\nsimilar ambiguous images.\nThe second aesthetic property suggested by Berlyne (1965) is \"incongruity (conflict),\" which\nrefers to received information differing from existing information, such as expectancy violation, or\nperceiving incongruent parts within a complete object (see Silvia 2006 for more discussion). For\nexample, impossible figures are paradoxical, and the paradox is between what we see and what we\nknow to be possible (Kanizsa 1979). It is also about the contradiction created between different parts of\nthe same image, which creates a perceptual paradox resulting in a psychological sense of astonishment\n(Pinna 2007) and fascination. The perceptual paradox arises from the conflict between the local and\nAesthetic valence of visual illusions 114\nglobal distribution of elements, for example, where parts of a figure or scene are possible but their\ncombination is impossible.\nIn other examples of illusions, such as the Optimized Fraser Wilcox illusion or the Rotating Snakes\nillusion (Kitaoka 2005; Kitaoka and Ashida 2003), we experience a conflict between what we see and\nwhat is objectively there, described as an expectancy violation. For example, although the Rotating\nSnakes illusion is a static image, most observers perceive illusory movement. When viewing illusion\nprinted on paper, one remarks the conflict is even higher than on a PC display. That is, on first seeing an\nillusory figure, most novice viewers do not expect to watch a scene that is not veridical, ie, which does\nnot correspond to what is objectively there. Certain illusory figures are perceived as illusory only when\ntheir actual physical properties are revealed. In a striking variant of the Craik-O'Brien-Cornsweet\neffect (Cornsweet 1970; Purves et al 1999), most observers perceive and believe that the upper gray\nsurface is darker than the lower one, although the brightness of both surfaces is exactly the same. This\nimpression is created by the gradient region around the border between the two gray surfaces. If we\ncan cover this region, it would be easy to see that actually both surfaces are the same in luminance.\nA surprising moment of the discovery of what is illusory in an observed scene (ie, when the \"A-ha\"\nexperience is derived) sparks fascination, and thus the excitement of the moment of discovery may be\nfollowed by an Aesthetic Experience. This reasoning is highly compatible with a view on the pleasure\nof art as derived from a predictive coding account (see Van de Cruys and Wagemans 2011). Thus, we\nhypothesized that our stimuli that showed how the illusion can be disambiguated or those showing\ngradual transformation starting from weak-or-no illusory figures to fully illusory figures should be\nregarded as more interesting and more fascinating than the visual patterns with no illusory effect or\nwith \"unnoticed\" illusion.\nStudy of subjective judgment of a form (SJF12) and Aesthetic Experience (AE3)\nIn the early 1970s, Daniel Berlyne initiated numerous studies in which semantic differential scales\nwere used to investigate the judgments of paintings (Berlyne 1971; Berlyne and Ogilvie 1974; Cupchik\nshowed great similarity among the extracted factors. The most commonly extracted factors can be\nclassified in three groups: (1) Evaluation or Hedonic tone (good\u00adbad, pleasant\u00adunpleasant, etc), (2)\nPotency or Arousal (strong\u00adweak, interesting\u00aduninteresting, etc), and (3) Activity or Uncertainty\n(active\u00adpassive, complex\u00adsimple, etc). Similar factors extracted from studies by Tucker (1955) and\nOsgood et al (1957, 1975) suggest that the elementary implicit features converge into three more\ngeneral categories, irrespective of the object of judgment (paintings or non-artistic visual patterns).\nMarkovi and Jankovi (2001) focused on the latent structure of the subjective or evaluative\nmeaning. They analyzed whether the numerous evaluative attributes that we find in natural language\ncould converge to a smaller number of latent dimensions that might indicate the underlying mental\nstructures responsible for a great variety of the evaluative attributes by which we assess our\nsurroundings (see also Augustin et al 2011, for a similar approach). This approach was based on the\nlexical hypothesis that relative frequency of the attributes in the language corpus indicates their relative\nimportance in the relevance of their usage for evaluating objects around us. In a similar manner,\nsubsequent studies analyzed the latent structure of visual stimuli's subjective, evaluative meaning--ie,\nthe subjective judgments of artistic and non-artistic pictorial content. Through the use of a production\ntask, a set of descriptors of the subjective experience of visual patterns was obtained. Participants were\nasked to list the attributes that expressed their impression of (imagined) visual patterns. In summary, a\nset of 65 descriptors was selected. All were given in the form of adjectives, and this form was used to\nconstruct a set of bipolar 7-point scales. In the main experiment, participants rated 16 abstract visual\nstimuli on the 65 descriptors. The stimuli were constructed and selected to cover a wide spectrum of\nvisual Gestalten (from simple geometric figures to abstract artistic drawings). In the factor analysis\n(the principal component method plus Promax rotation), the following three factors were obtained:\nEvaluation (pleasant, cheerful, serene, clear, etc), Arousal (interesting, imaginative, diverse, complex,\netc), and Regularity (harmonious, coherent, definite, realistic, etc; see Table 1). These factors formed\nthe instrument that measured subjective judgment of a form on 12 scales, hereinafter referred to as\n115 Stevanov  J, Markovi S, Kitaoka A\nTable 1. Results from the Principal ComponentAnalysis + Promax rotation. The first three factors with percentage\nof explained variance. The coefficients of saturation were obtained from the pattern matrix.\nA similar procedure was used to specify the structure of the aesthetic and emotional domains of\nviewers' experience of paintings. Twenty-four paintings used in Markovi and Radonji (2008) were\nselected as stimuli for their study. First, 100 paintings were randomly selected from a larger set of 200\nfigural and 200 semi-figural paintings (50 from each category). Next, participants in a preliminary\nstudy were asked to select 24 paintings to cover the widest possible spectrum of different styles\nand motifs (themes). In the main experiment, participants rated the 24 paintings on 31 descriptors\n(7-point bipolar scales). The factor analysis revealed two general factors: the bipolar factor, Affective\nTone (descriptors on the positive pole: lovely, charming, cheerful, etc; descriptors on the negative\npole: scary, disgusting, hateful, etc), and Aesthetic Experience (descriptors: exceptional, fascinating,\nirresistible, etc). The three most loaded scales with the obtained factor constituted the instrument for\nmeasuring Aesthetic Experience, hereinafter referred to as AE3. The scales ranged from 1 to 7, where\nnumber 1 was equivalent to the assessment of a stimulus as \"slightly fascinating\" and 7 was equivalent\nto the assessment of the stimulus as \"extremely fascinating.\"\nIn our study, we chose to test illusion patterns using both instruments SJF12 and AE3 assuming\nthat Aesthetic Experience and implicit features of illusions are conceptually different aspects that\nmay govern visual preference of illusory patterns. Given the results of the study of the implicit and\nexplicit features of paintings (Markovi and Radonji 2008), we expected the Aesthetic Experience\nof visual illusions to correlate positively with Arousal and Evaluation. Observation time was also\nmeasured. Previous studies demonstrated significant correlation between the observation time and\ncollative variables (complexity, novelty, etc; Berlyne and Lewis 1963; Berlyne and Lawrence 1964;\nthe object or a scene; Silvia 2005b). If our hypothesis is correct, significant correlations between\nobservation time and Evaluation, Arousal, Regularity, and Aesthetic Experience should be obtained,\nin addition to longer observation times for illusory stimuli compared with stimuli with reduced-or-no\nillusory effect.\nMethods\nThirty-one high school students (18 female and 13 male; mean age 17.0 years old), who visited\nthe Petnica Science Center, participated in this experiment. We avoided university students from\nthe psychology department because they might have substantial knowledge about the visual illusions\nused in this study.\nStimuli\nWe produced dynamic stimuli, which showed gradual transformation starting from weak-or-no\nillusory figures to fully illusory figures. Our general idea was to show the process of how the illusion\nemerges or how the illusion can be revealed. Figures with reduced-or-no illusory effect looked much\nsimilar to illusory figures in the number of elements and visual appearance; however, those patterns\neither generated weak illusory effect or could give an illusion once observers became aware of it.\nThere were 15 pairs of images. For each pair, one was an illusory image and the other was an image\nAesthetic valence of visual illusions 116\n(a)\nFigure 1. The first column shows original illusory patterns that were presented first.

The illusory images included the Anderson illusion (Anderson\n2005; Figure 1a), the Angel columns figure\u00adground reversible figure (see http://www.psy.ritsumei.\nac.jp/~akitaoka/illnews14e.html; Figure 1b), the enhanced Cornsweet effect (Cornsweet 1970; Purves\net al 1999; Figure 1c), the frog\u00adhorse figure (19th-century art work, USA; Figure 1d), the Necker cube\n(Necker 1832; Figure 1e), the shadow ball illusion (Kersten et al 1991; Figure 1f), the modification of\nthe M\u00fcnsterberg checkerboard figure, the Caf\u00e9 Wall illusion (Fraser 1908; Gregory and Heard 1979;\nFigure 2a), the Penrose triangle (Penrose and Penrose 1958; Figure 2b), the Pinna illusion (Pinna and\nSquare illusion (Shiffrar and Pavel 1991; Figure 3a), the Kanizsa Square illusion (Kanizsa 1955,\n1976; Figure 3b), the Luckiesh pattern (Luckiesh 1922; Figure 3c), the Marilyn\u00adEinstein hybrid image\nFirst, we describe the stimuli that were perceived as illusory once their actual physical properties\nwere revealed to observers and how original illusory patterns were modified for that purpose. This\ngroup includes the six stimuli and the actual animations as shown in Figure 1.\n1. For example, when seeing the Anderson illusion for the first time (Figure 1a), most\nnovice viewers would not perceive it as an illusory figure, as they would not believe that\nthe chess pieces of the two images are of the same luminance. The upper chess figures\nare usually seen as dark objects behind a light cloud, and the lower chess figures as light\nobjects behind a dark cloud. This image could be noticed or perceived as illusory once\nobservers saw both chess sets being physically identical in luminance. For that reason,\nthe black background in the lower image was slowly unveiled, revealing the bright\nbackground of the upper image, and then turned back to the original black background\n(click on figure to view animation). In this way, observers were supposed to become\naware that the chess figures in the upper image were of the same luminance as those in\nthe lower image. One movie sequence was 8 s long and was played in a loop until the\nobservers pressed the button to move to the next trial.\n2. The Angel columns image (Figure 1b) shows silhouettes of persons standing between\ncolumns, but it is primarily seen as columns in front of the light background because\nthe columns appear to be realistic objects. In order to demonstrate how the figure and\nthe background can reverse, black masks emerged from the right and left borders of the\nimage until the image was covered such that only two white background tiles remained.\nWe assumed that by blacking out the columns in this manner, the observers would\nexperience a perceptual flip from the foreground figure to that of the background region,\nthereby redirecting their focus from the columns to the human figures. One movie\nsequence was 6 s long and was played in a loop until the participants pressed the button\nto move to the next trial.\n3. When seeing the enhanced Cornsweet effect (Figure 1c), most novice viewers believe\nthat the upper surface is darker than the lower one, although the brightness of both\nsurfaces is exactly the same. However, if the region containing the sharp border between\nthe two gray surfaces and the gradient around the border is hidden under the black mask,\nit becomes evident that the brightness of both surfaces is the same. At first, we showed a\ndark rectangle passing behind the gray surfaces, in which case the rectangle did not cover\nthe key region and hence observers should perceive the brightness of the surfaces as\nbeing different. In the next scene, the dark rectangle passed in front of the gray surfaces\nblacking out the key region when the observers were supposed to see that the brightness\nof both surfaces was the same. In both stimuli, one cycle was 6 s long and played in a\nloop until the participants pressed the button to move to the next trial.\n4. The frog\u00adhorse figure (Figure 1d) is an example of an ambiguous figure in which\nobservers tend to see a frog in the left of the image and a horse on the right. In order to\nmake observers discern this ambiguity, we made a dynamic stimulus in which the left\n\"frog\" was continuously rotated counterclockwise through 90\u00b0 to make it identical to the\nright \"horse\". In this way, observes could experience a flip between two very different\nalternative percepts. Each rotation sequence was 7 s long and was repeated until the\nparticipants pressed the button to move to the next trial.\n5. The Necker cube (Figure 1e) is an ambiguous line drawing showing a cube in which\nobservers perceive a cube flipping between two perspectives. In the first scene (Figure 1e),\n119 Stevanov  J, Markovi S, Kitaoka A\na rod passed in front of the cuboid in oblique perspective. We expected that observers\nwould not see reversals in perspective because their attention should be focused on the\nfast-moving rod. In the next scene, one rod moved rightward along the cuboid of one\nperspective while the other rod moved downward along the cuboid of the alternative\nperspective. This movie was expected to make participants understand how the cube\ncould change its perspective by changing the sides of the cube appearing behind the rod.\nThe movie was looped in 4 s cycles.\n6. The Shadow Ball illusion (Figure 1f) demonstrates how the motion of the \"shadowless\"\nball is perceived ambiguously: It can be perceived as either rolling diagonally across the\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 2. The first column shows weak illusory patterns that were presented first. Strong illusory\npatterns are shown in the second column, and they were presented subsequently: (a) Modification of\nthe M\u00fcnsterberg checkerboard figure, the Caf\u00e9 Wall illusion (Gregory and Heard 1979), (b) Penrose\ntriangle. (c) Pinna illusion (Pinna and Brelstaff 2000), (d) Rotating Snakes illusion (Kitaoka 2005).\nClick on image to view animation.\nAesthetic valence of visual illusions 120\nfloor or as rising diagonally along the same depth plane. It is believed that our visual\nsystem cannot decide between the two simplest possibilities for the movement of the\nball. The trajectory of the ball without a shadow is consistent with a ball rising on the\nsame depth plane as well as a ball receding into the distance against a level surface. A\nshadow is a strong cue for both the ball's trajectory and its depth. Thus, in the first scene\npresented to participants a gray ball without a shadow moved along a diagonal trajectory.\nThe participants were supposed to perceive it as either rolling diagonally across the floor\nor as rising diagonally along the same depth plane. The movie sequence was 10 s long\nand was played in a loop. In the following scene, we added the diagonal and \"zig-zag\"\nmoving shadow, which should have made the ball appear to roll diagonally across the\nfloor in the first case or to bounce along the floor in the second case. Participants who\nsaw this series of stimuli were supposed to understand that the ball's perceived motion\ndepends on the shadow's motion. One movie sequence was 10 s long and was played in\na loop until the participants pressed the button to move to the next trial.\nIn the second group of stimuli, each pair contained one figure with reduced illusory effect and one\nfigure with the highest possible intensity of illusory effect. This group includes the four stimuli shown\nin Figure 2.\n1. A modification of the M\u00fcnsterberg checkerboard figure (Figure 2a) has the checkerboard\npattern with horizontal borders isoluminant with the light regions. When the position of\nthe dark and light tiles deviates from the standard checkerboard pattern, the alternate\nhorizontal lines appear to be slightly tilted in opposite directions. The strongest effect\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 2 (continued).\n121 Stevanov  J, Markovi S, Kitaoka A\noccurs when the rows of the tiles are separated by a thin line of mortar and its luminance\nis between the luminance of the dark and light tiles. This was demonstrated by Gregory\nand Heard (1979) as the Caf\u00e9 Wall illusion. In the first scene presented to our participants,\nmortar lines between rows were of the same luminance as the light tiles. Alternate\nrows were moving horizontally in the same direction at a constant speed. Observers\nwere supposed to perceive the mortar lines being slightly tilted when the position of\nthe dark and light tiles deviated from the usual checkerboard pattern. However, in the\nfollowing scene, we changed the mortar lines' luminance to gray. Participants should\nhave experienced a strong tilt illusion. One cycle was 5 s long and was played in a loop\nuntil the participants pressed the button to move to the next trial.\n2. The Penrose triangle (Figure 2b) is a tribar that appears to be a solid object made of three\nstraight beams of a square cross section that meet pairwise at right angles at the vertices\nof the triangle they form. Parts of the triangle are not ambiguous, but they are drawn\nin incompatible perspectives and thus cannot be realized by any three-dimensional\nobject in ordinary Euclidean space. In such ambiguous figures, there is a perceptual\nconflict between the local and global distribution of the elements. In order to create\n\"disambiguous\" figures, we needed to resolve the local\u00adglobal perceptual conflict. The\nfirst scene presented to the participants had a triangle split into three pieces shaped like\nthe letter V, and we called it a \"disambiguous\" figure because the two tiles of each letter\nV are drawn in a possible perspective. In the following scene the three V-shaped pieces\nwere joined at the ends to form a triangle, but in this case, the triangle they formed had\nsides drawn in incompatible perspectives. We used dynamic demonstration to show how\nthe illusion can emerge and to allow time for participants to discern how the ambiguity\narose. One cycle was 6 s long and was played in a loop until the participants pressed the\nbutton to move to the next trial.\n3. The Pinna illusion (Figure 2c) has the parallelograms delineated by two white and two\nblack edges, each of which are grouped by proximity in three concentric rings. All the\nparallelograms have the same width, length, and orientation in relation to the center of\ntheir circular arrangements. When the observers' heads are slowly moved toward the\nfigure with the gaze fixed at the center, the inner ring of the parallelograms appears\nto rotate counterclockwise while the outer ring clockwise. The direction of rotation is\nreversed when the observers move away from the figure. In the first scene presented to\nthe participants, the rings of the parallelograms expanded and contracted physically as if\nthe observers were moving their heads toward and away, respectively, from the figure. We\nadded shorter parallelogram diagonal lines, which were supposed to even out the local\ndistribution of elements in all rings, and therefore, participants should have perceived a\nweak illusory effect (Ferm\u00fcller and Malm 2004). While expanding, the inner ring of the\nparallelograms should have appeared to rotate slightly in the counterclockwise direction\nand the outer ring slightly in the clockwise direction. The perceived direction of rotation\nshould have been reversed when the image contracted. In the following scene, instead of\nthe short lines, we added longer diagonal lines to the middle ring squares, which were\nsupposed to enhance the illusory effect caused by the uneven distribution of elements\n(Ferm\u00fcller and Malm 2004). In both stimuli, one cycle was 5 s long and was played in a\nloop until the participants pressed the button to move to the next trial.\n4. The Rotating Snakes illusion (Figure 2d) is a static image that appears to move slowly\nand \"spontaneously.\" The strongest illusory effect is seen in the radial circular pattern.\nTo reduce the strength of the Rotating Snakes illusion, we rearranged its constituent\nelements into a columnar pattern, as it gives weak or no illusory motion. Participants\nwere presented first with a columnar pattern and then with a circular radial pattern.\nIn the third group of stimuli, each pair contained one non-illusory figure and one illusory figure. This\ngroup includes the five stimuli shown in Figure 3.\n1. The Breathing square illusion (Figure 3a) has a red square rotating at a constant speed\naround an imaginary y-axis. The rotating red square is partially hidden by four blue\nsquares (occluders). What is commonly perceived is that the red square appears to grow\nand shrink as it turns, but in fact its size does not change. This illusion depends on the\nsize of the occluders, and thus in the first scene presented to the participants, the width of\nAesthetic valence of visual illusions 122\nthe cross arms formed by the blue occluders was 50% to 60% of the length of the side of\nthe rotating square. What most observers were supposed to see was the square rotating\nbut not changing in size. In the next scene we changed the size of the occluders, forming\na cross of small arm width. When the red square rotated, most observers were supposed\nto perceive the square changing in size so that it appeared to \"breathe\"--contract and\nexpand. After a few seconds, occluders began to contract, and once the occluders were\nsmall enough (the same size as that in the first scene), the illusion disappeared. In both\nstimuli, one cycle was 8 s long and played in a loop until participants pressed the button\nto move to the next trial.\n2. The Kanizsa square (Figure 3b) image has four black Pac-Men facing inward that create\nan impression of the white illusory square superimposed on the four black circles. If four\nPac-Men are randomly placed on a white canvas, most observers should not perceive\nanything else besides those four Pac-Men. Thus, to show how the illusion arises, the\nfour randomly placed Pac-Men were put in rotation until they were facing inward to\nform the illusory square, although none was drawn. The illusory square was supposed to\ndisappear once the Pac-Men began rotating backward to return to their initial position.\nOne cycle was 6 s long and played in a loop until participants pressed the button to move\nto the next trial.\n3. The Luckiesh pattern (Figure 3c) is an optical illusion that demonstrates how bounding\nobjects such as circles can appear distorted in the presence of radiating lines. The first\ndynamic stimulus presented to the participants showed a circle passing through the\nvertical parallel lines in which case the circle should not appear distorted. In the next\nscene the circle passed through the set of radiating lines that made the circle appear\ndistorted. Observers who saw these dynamic stimuli series were supposed to understand\nthat the circle would appear distorted only in the presence of the radiating lines but not\nin the presence of the vertical parallel lines. In both stimuli, one movie sequence was\n17 s long and played in a loop until the participants pressed the button to move to the\nnext trial.\n4. Combining a low-spatial-frequency and a high-spatial-frequency image yields a hybrid\nimage that can be interpreted differently depending on the viewing distance. We used the\nMarilyn\u00adEinstein hybrid image (Figure 3d), which is a combination of the low-spatial-\nfrequency Marilyn Monroe image and the high-spatial-frequency Albert Einstein image.\nWhen seeing it close up, most observers can recognize the face of Albert Einstein, but\nif they step back, the image of Marilyn Monroe becomes clear. In the scene presented\nfirst to the participants, we used high spatial frequency images of Marilyn and Albert\nwhose interpretation does not depend on the viewing distance (size of the image on the\nscreen--large vs thumbnail size is irrelevant). In the following scene we presented a\nlarge size hybrid image of Albert Einstein and Marilyn Monroe, and most observers were\nsupposed to see only the image of Albert Einstein. To reveal the presence of the low-\nspatial-frequency image of Marilyn Monroe, after a few seconds, the hybrid image\nshrank to thumbnail size when the thumbnail image of Marilyn Monroe appeared\nbelow and most observers were supposed to see notable resemblance in these pictures.\nIn both stimuli, one \"zoom in zoom out\" sequence was 5 s long and played in a loop until\nthe participants pressed the button to move to the next trial.\n5. The Sound Wave illusion (Figure 3e) has the checkerboard pattern as the basic image.\nThe rows of dark and light tiles are separated by a thin line of mortar. The mortar lines\ndo not appear to be distorted or tilted in a typical checkerboard pattern; however, if\nsmall white squares are added in the corners of the larger black squares, the vertical or\nhorizontal mortar lines appear distorted. Using animation, we gradually added the small\nwhite squares to the larger black squares of the checkerboard pattern and then in the same\nfashion gradually removed them. In this way, observers were supposed to understand\nthat the mortar lines appear distorted only when small white squares are present in the\ncorners of the larger black squares.

Participants sat approximately 50 cm away from the computer\nscreen. Each participant was presented with all experimental trials. Thirty stimuli were presented\none at a time in 15 pairs of trials. For each pair, one was an illusory image while the other was an\nimage with reduced-or-no illusory effect. The presentation of the no-or-weak illusory stimulus always\npreceded that of the illusory stimulus (Figure 3). Subjects were given the task to look at the object or\nthe scene as long as they wanted or needed to until the image became boring. Their observation time\nwas measured. They were instructed to observe each scene carefully, paying attention to changes.\nIn each trial, participants indicated their judgments of implicit features and Aesthetic Experience\n(choosing the value on the SJF12 and AE3 scales) for the image shown in that particular trial. The\npresentation time was individual because subjects decided how long they wanted or needed to see each\nscene. When they were ready, they pushed the forward button, and the next trial began. There was no\ninterstimulus interval. Pairs of stimuli were randomized in order to neutralize the possible effect of\nFigure 3 (continued).\n(d)\n(e)\n125 Stevanov  J, Markovi S, Kitaoka A\nsequence and practice. In addition, the order of the scales was randomized for each participant and\neach stimulus.\n3 Results and discussion\nFor Evaluation scores, the pooled average rating of the illusory stimuli (Mean 4.67, SD 1.18) was\nhigher than that of the stimuli with reduced-or-no illusory effect (Mean 4.29, SD 1.04)(F(1,30) =\nSD 1.29) was higher than that of the stimuli with reduced-or-no illusory effect (Mean 3.95, SD 1.39)\n(Mean 4.61, SD 1.14) was lower than that of the stimuli with reduced-or-no illusory effect (Mean 4.73,\nSD 1.09), but this difference was not statistically significant (F(1,30) = 2.45, ns). Finally, the pooled\naverage of Aesthetic Experience scores for the illusory stimuli (Mean 4.08, SD 1.61) was higher than\nThese results revealed that illusory stimuli were judged significantly higher than stimuli with reduced-\nor-no illusory effects for Arousal, Evaluation, and Aesthetic Experience, but not for Regularity.\nIn addition, the results revealed a significant effect of \"stimuli\" on judgments of Evaluation\nFigure 4. The lower sequence of images shows the stimulus presented first, and the upper sequence of\nimages shows the subsequent stimulus. The lower sequence of images shows the enhanced Cornsweet\neffect, in which the upper gray surface is commonly perceived as darker than the lower one, although\nthe brightness of both surfaces is exactly the same. Novice viewers do not see this illusion until it is\ndemonstrated that the brightness of both surfaces is exactly the same. Thus, by covering the gradient\nregion containing the border between the two gray surfaces (upper sequence of images), observers are\nsupposed to see that the brightness of both surfaces was the same.\nAesthetic valence of visual illusions 126\nFor Evaluation scores (Figure 5), certain stimuli got relatively high average ratings; for example,\nthe Penrose triangle, Rotating Snakes figures, Necker cube, Kanizsa square, and the Sound Wave\nillusion. The Cornsweet effect figure was rated significantly lower than all other illusions used in\nthis study. Furthermore, for Arousal scores (Figure 6), the Cornsweet effect figure, together with the\nKanizsa square and the Luckiesh pattern, received statistically lower average ratings than the Rotating\nSnakes figure, Penrose triangle, frog\u00adhorse figure, Caf\u00e9 Wall, Anderson, and Sound Wave illusions.\nSimilarly, for Regularity scores (Figure 7), the Luckiesh pattern, Cornsweet effect figure, and Necker\ncube figure received lower ratings than theAngel columns,Anderson illusion, frog\u00adhorse, and Kanizsa\nsquare figures. Finally, the Penrose triangle, Rotating snakes pattern, frog\u00adhorse figure, Caf\u00e9 Wall, and\nSound Wave illusion received statistically higher aesthetic scores compared to the Luckiesh pattern,\nCornsweet effect figure, and Kanizsa square (Figure 8). The Necker cube was rated significantly lower\nthan the Penrose triangle, Rotating snakes pattern, and frog\u00adhorse figure.\nInterestingly enough, the largest differences between illusory and reduced-or-no illusory patterns\nwere obtained forArousal andAesthetic Experience scores of the Necker cube and Sound Wave stimuli.\nRelatively large differences between illusory and reduced-or-no illusory patterns were also obtained for\nthe Marilyn\u00adEinstein hybrid image, Shadow ball illusion, Breathing square, Kanizsa square, Luckiesh\npattern, and Caf\u00e9 Wall stimulus pairs. However, certain partial differences for Arousal and Aesthetic\nExperience scores were not significant; for example, the frog\u00adhorse stimulus pair, Penrose triangle\nstimulus pair, Pinna illusion stimulus pair, and Rotating Snakes stimulus pair. Partial differences\nbetween aesthetic scores of illusory patterns and patterns with reduced-or-no illusory effects were\nsignificant except for the Rotating Snakes stimulus pair (Figure 8).\nFigure 5.

Our results agreed with these studies because significant Pearson's\ncorrelation coefficients between Evaluation and Aesthetic Experience (r(28) = 0.70, p < 0.01) and\nbetween Arousal and Aesthetic Experience (r(28) = 0.97, p < 0.01) were obtained. For the correlation\nand regression analysis, we calculated the mean rating score for each stimulus (15 illusory and 15 with\nreduced-or-no illusory effect) on Evaluation, Arousal, Regularity, and Aesthetic Experience. Multiple\nregression analysis of the data matrix consisting of SJF12 and AE3 dimensions in columns and stimuli\np < 0.05) significantly predicted Aesthetic Experience scores (Figure 9), whereas Regularity was not\nfound to be a significant predictor of Aesthetic Experience (t(26) = 0.74, p > 0.05). Beta coefficients\nimplied that Arousal might be a better predictor than Evaluation, but in order to determine whether\nArousal was a significantly better predictor than Evaluation, we used an additional test. First, we\nexamined multicolinearity between Arousal and Evaluation because the correlation between them was\n0.61. If there was multicolinearity, we could not argue their independent contributions to the regression\nmodel. Colinearity statistics indicated that the tolerance for Evaluation was 0.567 and for Arousal was\n0.571, which was much higher than 0.02 (a lower boundary that would suggest multicolinearity).\nFurthermore, the average VIF value was 1.53, which was lower than 10 (an upper boundary). Thus,\nwe found no problem of multicolinearity and could proceed with testing which of the two independent\nvariables would better predict aesthetic responses. We used a test proposed by Meng et al (1992), a\nsimple extension of Dunn and Clark's (1969) work, which uses Fisher's Z transformation and includes\nthe test and confidence interval for comparing two correlated correlations. The Z test value was 5.86\nwhen comparing the correlation between Arousal and Aesthetic Experience (r\ncorrelation between Evaluation and Aesthetic Experience (r\nAesthetic Experience responses significantly better than Evaluation.\nFigure 8.

We expected significant\ncorrelations between observation time and Evaluation, Arousal, Regularity, and Aesthetic\nExperience, in addition to longer observation time for illusory stimuli compared to stimuli\nwith reduced-or-no illusory effect. Some of these expectations were confirmed by the\nresults of this study, but others were not. The pooled average of the observation time for\nillusory stimuli (Mean 21.69 s, SD 17.58 s) was significantly longer than the observation\n57.87, p < 0.001), which suggests that subjects spent more time viewing illusory stimuli.\nshowing no significant differences in observation time between certain illusory patterns\nand patterns with reduced-or-no illusory effect for the frog\u00adhorse stimulus pair, Caf\u00e9 Wall\nstimulus pair, Penrose triangle stimulus pair, Rotating Snakes stimulus pair, and Kanizsa\nsquare stimulus pair (Table 2).\nWe found non-significant positive correlations between observation time and\n> 0.05). In addition, regression analyses showed that none of the SJF12 factors or AE3\n3). Future studies could test these tendencies on a greater number of illusion examples.\nOther physiological measures that may reflect affective changes should also be taken into\naccount, eg, the psychogalvanic reflex or heart rate.\nTo summarize, we can say that some of our hypothesis were confirmed: the stimuli that enabled\nobservers to discern the included illusions (which showed how the illusion can be disambiguated or\nshowing gradual transformation starting from reduced-or-no illusory figures to fully illusory figures)\nwere regarded as more interesting and more fascinating than the visual patterns with reduced-or-no\nillusory effect. In other words, we would argue that the illusive nature itself, if revealed to observers,\nincreases the aesthetic and affective valence of visual patterns. This is most evident with the stimuli\nwhich are rather simple in shape or with fewer details like the Necker cube and Kanizsa square.\nThe large differences in aesthetic scores obtained between illusory and their non-illusory counterparts\nspeak in favor of this idea. In order to test the generalizability of this finding and to try to establish a\nbetter experimental control, we conducted the second experiment.\nFigure 9. Scatterplot of the regression analysis: (a) Arousal and (b) Evaluation were predictors, and\nAesthetic Experience was a criterion variable.\nAesthetic valence of visual illusions 130\nTable 2.

Multiple regression analysis: The relationship between observation time (criterion variable) and SJF12\nand AE3 judgments (predictor variables).\nt(25) Significance level\nIn Experiment 1, reduced-or-no illusory stimuli always preceded illusory stimuli, suggesting a\npossibility that this fixed order might have affected the results. To examine whether the order of\npresentation has an effect on aesthetic and affective scores, Experiment 2 compared the order when\nnon-illusory stimuli were followed by illusory stimuli with its reversed order when illusory stimuli\nwere followed by non-illusory stimuli.\nNon-illusory and illusory patterns were matched in as many perceptual features as possible: the\nnumber of elements, visual appearance, and the presence or duration of the motion, hence the notable\ndifference was whether or not illusion was included and discerned. We selected a few pairs of stimuli\nthat showed remarkable differences in Experiment 1, such as the Necker cube or Kanizsa square, to\nobtain better control stimuli and to test generalizability of the findings of Experiment 1. In this respect,\nwe asked university students to participate in this experiment, rather than to merely replicate the first\nexperiment.\nMethods\nStudents of the Ritsumeikan University from the psychology and history departments (4 females and\nStimuli\nWe chose to develop further the four stimulus pairs used in the first experiment, which had yielded the\nlargest differences between reduced-or-no illusory and illusory figures: The Kanisza square stimulus\npair, the Caf\u00e9 Wall stimulus pair, the Necker cube stimulus pair, and the Sound Wave stimulus pair.\n131 Stevanov  J, Markovi S, Kitaoka A\nAs the fifth stimulus pair, we added the modification of the optimized Fraser\u00adWilcox illusion type IIa\n(Kitaoka 2008a, 2008b) as a variation of the Rotating Snakes pattern. In the first experiment, only the\nRotating Snakes stimulus pair received no significant differences in Aesthetic Experience scores. The\nversion we used in the present study is rather novel to participants, which is one of the reasons why\nwe did not include the Rotating Snakes illusion as many participants may have been familiar with it.\nFigures with no illusory effect looked as similar to the illusory figures as possible in the number of\nelements and visual appearance but without illusory effect (Figure 10). In the first experiment, we used\nseveral stimulus pairs in which the reduced-or-no illusory figure was stationary and the illusory figure\nwas dynamic. One may argue that the motion might have increased aesthetic scores; thus, all stimuli\nused in the present study were dynamic (ie, no stationary images were used).\n1. For example, in the first experiment, the modification of the Kanizsa square was a\nstationary image with the four Pac-Men randomly placed on a white canvas, hence\nno illusory square could be observed. In the second experiment, we made dynamic\nmodification of the same image. Those four Pac-Men rotated simultaneously until they\nwere aligned outward and for the illusory stimulus, the Pac-Men rotated simultaneously\nuntil they were facing inward (Figure 10a). In this way the possible motion effect could\nbe controlled.\n2. The Caf\u00e9 Wall illusion (Figure 10b) was a bit modified for the second experiment. For\nthe non-illusory stimulus instead of using the mortar lines that are isoluminant with\nthe light tiles, we followed Gregory's definition of the Caf\u00e9 Wall illusion (Gregory and\nHeard 1979) and used the light and dark gray tiles separated by a thin line of mortar\nwhose luminance wasn't between the luminance of the dark and light tiles ie they were\nblack. For the illusory stimulus, the luminance of the mortar lines was exactly between\nthe luminance of the dark and light tiles. Alternate rows were moving horizontally in the\nsame direction at a constant speed. The version we created for the second experiment is\nnot the typical version of the Caf\u00e9 Wall illusion, thus participants should not be familiar\nwith it.\n3. For the modification of the Necker cube illusion (Figure 10c) we used a grayscale rod\nthat moved along the horizontal and vertical trajectories in front of the cuboid in oblique\nperspective. In the first experiment, the rod was of a different color in illusory and non-\nillusory stimulus; thus we wanted to make them as similar as possible. For the illusory\nstimulus, one rod moved rightward along and through the cuboid of one perspective,\nand the other rod moved downward along and through the cuboid of the alternative\nperspective. This movie was expected to make participants understand how the cube\ncould change its perspective by changing which cube side appeared behind the rod.\n4. The non-illusory modification of the Sound Wave illusion pattern was created by adding\nsmall white squares in the center of the larger black squares. In this way, the horizontal\nand vertical mortar lines did not appear to be distorted or tilted but the non-illusory and\nillusory stimulus were matched in visual appearance and presence of the motion. In\ndynamic version of the Sound Wave illusion small white squares are added in the corners\nof the larger black squares, hence the vertical or horizontal mortar lines should appear\ndistorted (Figure 10d). The area of those small white squares was subtracted from that of\nthe larger white squares placed in the center of the non-illusory pattern. Observers were\nsupposed to understand that the mortar lines appear distorted only when the small white\nsquares are present in the corners of the larger black squares.\n5. The optimized Fraser Wilcox illusion type II pattern has an array of four regions of\ndifferent luminance in the systematic order \"black,\" \"dark grey (blue),\" \"white,\" and\n\"light grey\" (yellow), which evokes the perception of a slow rotational illusory motion.\nIf the color sequence between adjacent units is reversed, most observers do not perceive\nany rotational movement (Kuriki et al 2008). Thus, for the reduced-or-non illusory\nstimulus (Figure 10e), we created circular patterns with units of colors in the following\norder: blue, black, blue, white, yellow, black, yellow, white or blue, white, blue, black,\nyellow, white, yellow, black. Using a video transition that fades out one scene while\nfading in the next, after a few seconds, two adjacent blue units switched places with the\ntwo adjacent yellow units. Black and white units kept their positions. For the illusory\nstimulus the color sequence reversed between adjacent yellow and blue units to create the\nAesthetic valence of visual illusions 132\nFigure 10.

Subjects were individually tested. Participants\nsat approximately 70-cm away from the computer screen. Each participant was presented with all\nexperimental trials. Ten stimuli were presented one at a time in five pairs of trials. For each pair, one\nwas an illusory image and the other was a non-illusory image. One group of the participants was\npresented with the non-illusory stimulus followed by the presentation of the illusory stimulus. Another\ngroup of participants had the illusory followed by non-illusory stimulus. In each trial, participants\nindicated their judgments of implicit features and Aesthetic Experience (choosing the value on the SJF\n12 and AE3 scales) for the image shown in that particular trial.\n5 Results and discussion\nThe mean rating scores for Evaluation, Arousal, Regularity, and Aesthetic Experience are shown in\nFigures 11\u00ad14. Results revealed that there was no significant effect of presentation order for each score\n(all F < 1). There were also no significant interactions between \"illusion\" and \"stimuli\" for each score.\nThese results exclude the possibility that testing order might have played a part in Experiment 1.\nFor Evaluation scores, the pooled average rating of the illusory stimuli (Mean 4.96, SD 1.12) was\nArousal scores, the pooled average rating of the illusory stimuli (Mean 5.18, SD 1.23) was higher than\nthe pooled average rating of the illusory stimuli (Mean 4.58, SD 1.13) was higher than that of the\nstimuli without illusory effect (Mean 4.40, SD 1.02), but this difference was not statistically significant\n(F(1,19) < 1). Finally, the pooled average of Aesthetic Experience scores for the illusory stimuli (Mean\n39.35, p < 0.01). These results revealed that illusory stimuli were judged significantly higher than\n(d)\n(e)\nFigure 10 (continued).\nAesthetic valence of visual illusions 134\nnon-illusory stimuli for Arousal, Evaluation, and Aesthetic Experience, but not for Regularity. These\nresults are entirely consistent with those of Experiment 1.\nFurthermore, the results revealed a significant effect of \"stimuli\" on judgments of Arousal\n3.4, p < 0.01). There was also a significant interaction between \"illusion\" and \"stimuli\" for judgments\nFurthermore, partial differences for Arousal scores between illusory and non-illusory patterns\nwere not significant for the Kanizsa square stimulus pair and optimized Fraser Wilcox illusion type II\nstimulus pair. Interestingly enough, partial differences between aesthetic scores of illusory and non-\nillusory patterns were significant except for the optimized Fraser Wilcox illusion type II stimulus,\nwhich confirms the results of Experiment 1.\nSimilarly, large differences between illusory and non-illusory patterns were obtained for the\nArousal and Aesthetic Experience scores of the Necker cube and Sound wave figures, which is in line\nwith the results of Experiment 1. Furthermore, the Kanizsa square and the Necker cube received overall\nlower ratings on Arousal and Aesthetic Experience than the Caf\u00e9 Wall, Sound Wave, or optimized\nFraser Wilcox illusion, although they showed significantly higher scores on Regularity than the Sound\nWave or optimized Fraser Wilcox illusion. These results also agree with those of Experiment 1.\n6 General discussion\nIn this study we obtained judgments of implicit features and Aesthetic Experience for pairs of stimuli,\nan illusory pattern and its reduced-or-no illusory counterpart. The results suggest that illusory patterns\n(1) are more arousing, ie, they were judged as more interesting, imaginative, complex, diverse, etc;\n(2) have higher hedonic tone, ie, they were scored as more pleasant, cheerful, bright, clear, etc; and\n(3) possess aesthetic qualities, ie, they were judged as more fascinating, exceptional, irresistible,\netc. However, variations in illusion strength did not affect cognitive clarity (definite, realistic, etc)\nor aesthetic balance (harmonious, coherent, etc). The stimuli we examined were designed to enable\nobservers to discern the included illusions. Two stimuli sets were matched in as many perceptual\nfeatures as possible, but the notable difference was whether or not illusion was included and discerned.\nFigure 11.

Vertical bars\ndenote +/- standard errors.\nAesthetic valence of visual illusions 136\nOnce the illusion was revealed to observers, it increased the aesthetic and affective valence of the\nvisual patterns. This was the most evident with the stimuli which are rather simple in shape or with\nfewer details like the Necker cube and Kanizsa square. As visual patterns, they received relatively\nlow overall ratings on Arousal and Aesthetic Experience as compared with the more complex richly\ndetailed visual patterns like the Rotating Snakes, Caf\u00e9 Wall, frog-horse, or Marilyn\u00adEinstein hybrid\nimage. It agrees with the notion that the complexity\u00adsimplicity dimension of visual patterns affects\naesthetic responses. However, the differences in Arousal and Aesthetic scores between illusory and\ntheir non-illusory counterparts were among the largest. In other words, the presence of illusion created\na robust effect on Arousal and Aesthetic judgments.\nOne possible explanation of this finding is that stimulus properties are actually less important for\naesthetic assessment of visual illusions than the ease of discerning the included illusion (ie, the ease\nof deriving an \"A-ha\" experience). Furthermore, this strongly agrees with the idea that objects which\npossess \"high conceptual fluency due to meaningfulness\" are processed more efficiently (achieving\nawareness of illusory effect) with less cognitive resources and therefore preferred over objects whose\nprocessing requires more of the cognitive resources (see Winkielman et al 2003; Reber et al 2004, for\nfurther discussion). In this respect, the understanding of the meaning of an object is weighted more\nheavily than stimulus factors in determining visual preference of the illusory patterns. We suggest that\nthe Aesthetic Experience of visual illusions might reflect an interaction between assessments of the\nillusory effect (how fascinating it might be) and efficiency of cognitive processing in observers (how\neasy it was to understand it).\nOne surprising result of this study is that variations in strength of the motion illusion effect,\nsuch as in Rotating Snakes figures, did not affect judgments of Aesthetic Experience. Both figures\nwith strong and weak motion illusion obtained overall high aesthetic scores. It might be possible that\ncertain illusions do not have an effect on Aesthetic Experience judgments, but we also recognize the\npossibility that the weak illusory figures possess such abundant colorfulness and richness in details to\nequal the aesthetic contribution from the illusion.\nOther findings of the present study suggest that Aesthetic Experience of visual illusions is closer\nto Curiosity (ie, preferring unusual and interesting contents) than to Hedonic tone (pleasantness), as\nresults indicated that Arousal is a better predictor of Aesthetic Experience than Evaluation. In defining\nFigure 14. Aesthetic experience scores for each stimulus by order of the presentation.

Most theories proposed Berlyne's family of collative\nvariables (novelty, complexity, surprisingness, incongruity, etc) or similar concepts like information\nfound that the underlying dimension of interest reflected the perception of novelty and meaningfulness,\nwhile that of enjoyment reflected the perception of emotional warmth.As mentioned earlier, we argued\nthat visual illusions can be related to the concepts of \"surprisingness\" and \"incongruity\", which were\nexpected to play an important role in aesthetic assessment of visual patterns. The results of this study\nagree well with our theoretical assumptions (see also Van der Cruys and Wagemans 2011).\nPrevious studies (Noguchi 2003; Yoshino et al 2009) found that strong affective preference\noccurred with strong effect of illusion; however, most of the stimuli Noguchi and his colleagues used\nwere simple geometrical illusions. In this study we tried to cover a much wider range of illusory\npatterns and to offer a better understanding of the implicit features and aesthetic properties of the\nillusory figures. Moreover, we tried to isolate and capture the contribution of the illusion in assessment\nof the visual patterns as a phenomenal quality that has measurable aesthetic and affective valence.\nHaving in mind all constraints of the present study, we may say that it provides a useful framework for\nstudying the Aesthetic Experience of visual illusions. Future studies could, using a variety of visual\nstimuli (both artistic and non-artistic, eg, visual illusions), identify those invariants that bind together\ndiverse types of artistic and non-artistic aesthetic objects, scenes, and events.\n"
