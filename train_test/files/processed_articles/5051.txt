Often these attitudes have been not particularly\nnegative, and presently in some places these attitudes are still relatively positive. For\nLife history and cousin marriage in Mexico\nexample, according to Kuper (2002), marriage between cousins was permitted in ancient\nIsrael and was practiced in classic Greece and Rome. Although in the 4th century, Emperor\nTheodosius I introduced a ban on marriage between cousins, this practice continued and\namong the people attitudes were generally more or less neutral. Much more recently, in the\n18th and 19th century in England, cousin marriages became increasingly accepted in\nespecially the higher classes. Up until the middle of the 19th century, cousin marriage was\npermitted in the United States, and in many European countries. However, since the 19th\ncentury attitudes towards cousin marriage in the Western world began to change\ndrastically. The main reason for this was that the progeny of cousins were believed to be\ninflicted with genetic defects and poor breeding, resulted in delays in progress within\nsociety (see e.g., Bittles and Neel, 1994). Currently, thirty-one states in the United States\nhave laws that prohibit the marriage of cousins or laws that regulate the practice\n(Ottenheimer, 1996). And while presently, cousin marriage is legal in all European\ncountries, attitudes towards this type of union remain generally rather negative (Paul and\nSpencer, 2008). Particularly negative attitudes towards cousin marriage also exist in a\nnumber of East Asian countries. For example, in northern India, prior to marriage,\npedigrees are examined up to five generations on the female side and seven on the male in\norder to ensure that the bride and groom are not related (Bittles, 2002). In contrast,\ncurrently, attitudes towards cousin marriage tend to be particularly positive in a number of\nIslamic countries. About 50% and more of the marriages in countries such as Jordan,\nKuwait and Saudi Arabia occur among cousins (Jaber, Shohot, and Halpern, 1996). Not\nmuch is known about the rate of cousin marriage in African countries outside of the Middle\nEast, yet it is estimated that about 35-50% of all sub-Saharan African ethnic groups allow\nor prefer marriage between cousins (Bittles, 1994).\nThe historically and cross-culturally often observed accepting attitude towards\ncousin marriages clearly suggests that there is as such not an evolved mechanism against\nmating with cousins. In fact, we would like to suggest that such marriages may be, or may\nhave been, adaptive under certain conditions. For instance, cousin marriages may have had\ndirect biological benefits. Hoben, Buunk, Fincher, Thornhill, and Schaller (2011) showed\nthat cousin marriages may have arisen as an adaptive response to high pathogen prevalence\nand may function to maintain co-adapted gene complexes and local adaptation that defend\nagainst local pathogens. In a similar vein, a study in a French Canadian isolate\ndemonstrated that women who were biologically related to their partner experienced lower\nintrauterine mortality, which in turn resulted in greater fertility (Philippe, 1974; see also\nBittles, Grant, Sullivan, and Hussain, 2002). From the perspective of inclusive fitness,\nmarrying a cousin may also allow for a smoother transition for a woman to her husband's\nfamily, as the woman may receive more support from the family of her husband because\nshe is genetically related. In addition, there may be various proximate factors that make\ncousin marriages acceptable. For instance, in areas of lower socioeconomic levels, cousin\nmarriage may help facilitate finding a spouse among the poor because it allows them to\navoid payments that are traditionally associated with marriage such as a dowry or bride\nwealth. For the more prosperous, marrying cousins may keep familial wealth together as it\nmay prevent land and other wealth from distribution outside of the family; thus it may\nmaintain or increase the status and power of the family in society (e.g., Thornhill, 1991;\nLife history and cousin marriage in Mexico\nJoseph, 2007). Geographical isolation may also play an important role. In small, isolated\npopulations, individuals have limited access to mates except from within their group,\nincreasing the frequency of cousin marriage. Finally, in the Middle East, cousin marriage\nseems in part an extension of the wider phenomenon of agnatic (father's lineage) solidarity.\nA marriage within the father's line (i.e., father's brother's son) allows male relatives to\nremain in close contact with their daughter, sister or niece, thus preventing dishonorable\nbehavior such as infidelity or premarital sex (Holy, 1989).\nRemarkably, there has hardly been any investigation of the actual attitudes and\nbeliefs regarding cousin marriage in current populations, and of the factors that may\nexplain these attitudes. In the present research, which was conducted in three ethnic groups\nin the state of Oaxaca in Mexico, we examined the attitudes and beliefs towards cousin\nmarriages in a sample of parents of children in the mating age. We assessed first the beliefs\non the positive and negative consequences of cousin marriages. Next, we investigated the\ncentral assumption in our research that a negative attitude towards cousin marriages is\nrelated to a slow life history strategy. We also examined if parents who favor a high degree\nof influence on the mate choice of their children, have a less negative attitude towards\ncousin marriages. Finally, we paid attention to sex differences. From the perspective of the\ninbreeding hypothesis, we hypothesized that mothers will be more disapproving of\nmarriage between cousins than fathers will be. For women, the immense investment that is\nnecessary to gestate a child and the amount of postnatal care is so great that it is more\ncostly for a female to invest in a child that may suffer from harmful recessive mutations.\nFor men, the initial investment of time for copulation and contribution of sperm is the\nminimum investment necessary (Trivers, 1972). Consequently, the potential biological\nharm of mating with a cousin will not be as costly for men, which may make women more\nattuned to the potential disadvantages of cousin marriages.\nLife history strategy: The \"slow\" vs. \"fast\" continuum\nThe central issue examined in the present research is whether current population\nattitudes towards cousin marriage might reflect differences in life-history strategy. In\ngeneral, because of limited resources, individuals, in order to successfully reproduce, are\nforced to make trade-offs between mating effort, i.e., locating a mate and courting him or\nher, and parenting efforts, i.e., gestation, childbirth, and postnatal care of children (e.g.,\nChisholm, 1993; Figueredo, Vasquez, Brumbach, Schneider, Sefcek, et al., 2006). These\ntrade-offs can be arranged on a continuum that was originally usually described in terms of\nthe r-K model of reproductive strategies (e.g., Charles and Egan, 2005, Ellis, 1988), but is\nnow more commonly referred to as the \"fast\" vs. \"slow\" continuum of life history strategy.\nIndividuals at the faster end of the continuum seek to produce many offspring without great\ninvestment in their welfare (i.e., low parental and high mating effort), whereas individuals\nat the slower end of the continuum produce fewer offspring and provide greater nurturing\n(i.e., high parental and low mating effort). Although both strategies may have been equally\nfavored by natural selection, they differ in the type of reproductive success they maximize.\nWhereas the fast strategy particularly maximizes short-term reproductive success, the slow\nlife history strategy maximizes long-term reproductive success (e.g., Figueredo et al., 2006;\nKaplan and Gangestad, 2005). That is, having fewer, high quality, offspring may result,\nLife history and cousin marriage in Mexico\nultimately, in more descendants in distant future generations than having numerous lesser\nquality offspring, whose reproductive success depends more on luck.\nIn general, as a species, humans tend to follow a \"slow\" life history strategy\n(Bjorklund and Shackelford, 1999; Chisholm, 1993). However \u00ad as in many other species \u00ad\nin order to adapt to changing environmental conditions, individuals in each new generation\nalso show variation regarding their position on the \"fast\" vs. \"slow\" life history continuum\n(Figueredo, V\u00e1squez, Brumbach, and Schneider, 2007). That is, some individuals are\n\"slower\" in their life history strategy than others (Chisholm, 1993). Overall, a faster life\nhistory strategy may be the optimal reproductive strategy when the environment is adverse\nor unstable (e.g., Chisholm, 1993), and when populations are still growing (e.g., Rushton,\n2004). In contrast, when population size stabilizes, and mortality rates are low, slower life\nhistory strategy individuals come to predominate because under steady state conditions,\nthey are more competitively successful at raising young and organizing the more complex\nsocieties that sustain them (e.g., Buunk, Klavina, and Figueredo, 2009; Figueredo et al.,\n2005). There is considerable evidence that stressful experiences in and around their\nfamilies of origin \u00ad such as marital discord, father absence, or traumatic separation from\none's parents \u00ad lead to a faster life history strategy. This particular strategy is characterized\nby investing disproportionately in mating and in early reproduction, whereas a slower life\nhistory is characteristic of individuals who grow up in harmonious homes and homes where\nthe father is present. Such individuals tend to mature later, to postpone sexual activity and\nto display greater investment in the fewer children they produce (e.g., Belsky, Steinberg\nAs marrying cousins over generations may involve genetic risks, we predicted that\nindividuals who adopt a slow life history strategy will have a more negative attitude\ntowards cousin marriages, whereas individuals with a fast life history strategy cannot afford\nto be too selective in their mate choice, and may therefore have a more open attitude cousin\nmarriage. We do not assume that the effect of slow life history upon a negative attitude\ntowards cousin marriages reflects the operation of a cousin-specific adaptation; rather it\nmay be just be one aspect of a more general tendency to be selective in one\u00b4s mate choice,\nand to be overall more cautious and risk-avoidant \u00ad typical features of a slow life history.\nParental control of mate choice\nWhereas the previous reasoning may apply to individuals whether they are parents\nor not, we also examined a factor that may specifically explain attitudes of parents towards\ncousin marriages, i.e., the desire of parents to maintain and strengthen the in-group through\ncontrolling the mate choice of their offspring. In most cultures and throughout history,\nparents have exerted a strong influence on the mate choice of their offspring (Buunk, Park,\ngathering societies as well as in agricultural and postural societies, parental arrangement\nwas the most frequent type of marriage, especially for females. Even near the end of the\n20th century, about half of the marriages of Indian immigrants in the US were arranged\n(Menon, 1989). In a study among second-generation South Asian immigrants living in\nNorth America, about a quarter of the participants indicated that their parents would likely\nLife history and cousin marriage in Mexico\narrange their marriage (Talbani and Hasanali, 2000). Also within cultural groups and\nsocieties where `love based marriages' are the norm, parents may exert a considerable\ndegree of control over their children's mate-choice. For example, through controlling the\nchild's social networks, and through imposing curfews on children that may serve to limit\ncontact with members of the opposite sex and peers (Das Gupta, 1997; Faulkner and\nSchaller, 2007; Perilloux, Fleischman, and Buss, 2008; Wight, Williamson, and Henderson,\nParents do not randomly control the mate choice of their children. Apostolou\n(2010b) found that in preindustrial societies, in addition to a good character, a good family\nbackground and a similar social status were among the most important characteristics\nmentioned by parents for a son-in-law and a daughter-in-law. A series of studies conducted\nby Buunk, Parks, and Dubbs (2008) showed that in current societies individuals perceive\nthat their parents would object when they would choose a mate with traits indicating a low\ncooperation with the in-group, such as a different ethnicity, a different religion, and coming\nfrom a lower social class. These results were established in culturally diverse samples\nincluding young people from the United States, Kurdistan (Iraq), the Netherlands, Uruguay\naddition, in a study among parents with children between 15 and 25 years of age,\nparticipants perceived characteristics of a son-in-law or a daughter-in-law indicating a lack\nof cooperation with the in-group as more unacceptable to themselves than to their offspring\nmay be the most effective way of ensuring the spouse comes from the in-group. In addition,\nrelatedness between a person and his cousins is .125, but relatedness between a person and\nhis nieces and nephews is .25. Thus, parents will tend to want their children to cooperate\nmore with their cousins than they might naturally want to. We therefore hypothesized that\nthe attitude towards cousin marriage would be more positive among those parents favoring\nmore parental control over mate choice.\nThe Mexican context\nThe present research was conducted among parents from a rural population in\nOaxaca, one of the poorest states of Mexico, and focused primarily on the indigenous group\nof the Mixtecs. Around 30% of the Mexican populations considers themselves to be\nAmerican Indian (or predominantly so), and the Mixtecs are an indigenous people who\nwho constituted one of the major civilizations of Middle America - people that are well\nknown for their exceptional mastery of jewelry, their codices (phonetic pictures), their\nhistory, their art and their genealogy. The Mixtec region covers most of the current state of\nOaxaca. The Mixtecs are considered to be a very cohesive ethnic group that maintains its\nidentity despite the high level of migration (see e.g., Joyce, 2010). However, historically,\nindigenous cultures such as the Mixtecs have been considered as inferior, (e.g., see\nTo examine whether the pattern we found would be characteristic of the Mixtecs,\nand not of the Mexican population as a whole, we included also a sample of Mestizos. In\ntotal, around 60% of the Mexican population perceive themselves to be Mestizos. Whether\nLife history and cousin marriage in Mexico\none considers oneself as a Mestizo is to an important extent dependent on political and\ncultural factors, and in Mexico one's social identity seems rather fluid, and is not only\ndependent on ancestral origins (e.g., Knight, 1990). Following the Mexican revolution, the\nMestizos were promoted as the prototypical Mexicans, when a new ideology of mestizaje\nemerged that defined Mexico as essentially a Mestizo nation. To examine if the pattern\nfound among the Mixtecs was typical for this indigenous population and not for a minority\npopulation as such, we included a quite different ethnic minority group, i.e., Mexican\nBlacks. It is not widely known that Mexico has a black community, but it has been\nline with anthropologist Laura Lewis (2000) who studied Mexican Blacks in depth, we\nsimply refer to Afro-Mexicans as Blacks (negros), a term generally used in Oaxaca to refer\nto them. Although most Blacks were absorbed into the Mestizo population, and by the end\nof the colonial era Blacks were rarely recognized as a distinct racial or ethnic group\n(Villarreal, 2010; Lewis, 2000), over the past years, however, there has been somewhat\nmore attention for the African roots of the Mexican Blacks. Veracruz and Oaxaca - where\nthe present research was conducted - have substantial Black populations.\nMaterials and Methods\nSelection of respondents and data collection\nIn line with the study among Dutch parents on parents' attitudes towards their\nchildren's mate choice (Dubbs and Buunk, 2010), we chose the age range of 15 to 25 for a\ncouple reasons. By the age of 15, most children have reached puberty, and have begun to\nshow interest in the opposite sex. In Mexico, the mean age at marriage for women is 22.4\nand for men 24.6. Therefore, parents of children in the age range we chose, will generally\nbe, or recently have been, confronted with potential prospective marital partners; thus for\nthem whom their child marries will be a salient issue. A collaborator from the region who\nwas affiliated with the Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropolog\u00eda\nSocial (CIESAS) did the data collection. To collect the data, the collaborator first went to\nthe local officials (comisariado) that represented the people, and explained them what the\nnature of the research was, and showed them how to fill out the questionnaire by explaining\neach of the questions. The letter of recommendation given by the CIESAS helped\nconsiderably, because it convinced the officials that she just was going to collect data and\nnot promote any political viewpoint. The officials arranged the day and time at which she\ncould administer the questionnaire. At these times, people were approached and asked if\nthey did fit the criteria, and next asked if they were willing to fill out the questionnaire. The\nparticipants were all paid 65 Mexican pesos (around $6) for their participation. For the vast\nmajority of participants, this was more than their daily income. Although a number of\npeople felt the money was not enough, in most places, the people were nice and\ncooperative, and the sample can be considered quite typical for the local population.\nSample\nThe sample consisted of 205 respondents from three rural ethnic groups. Half of the\nLife history and cousin marriage in Mexico\n65) were Mestizos (for two participants the ethnic background was unknown). A large\nmajority (94%) was Roman Catholic. There were about equal numbers of males (n= 100),\nand females (n= 105), and the sexes were nearly equally distributed over the three ethnic\ngroups. The mean age in the sample was for women M = 44.79 (SD = 8.09), and for men =\n49.85 (SD = 9.91). For the following percentages, because of rounding off and missing\nvalues, the total percentage is sometimes different from 100%. Most women (90%) were\nhomemakers, 5% had a profession, and 6% indicated not to have a profession. Of the men,\nthe large majority (74%) were farmers, 10% were fishermen, 16% had a variety of other\nprofessions, and 2% indicated to have no profession. Among women, there was no\nMestizos (85%) as well as Mixtecs (77%), the large majority were farmers, and virtually\nnobody was a fisherman (0% and 2%, respectively), with similar numbers of other\nprofessions (15% and 17%, respectively). In contrast, only half of the Blacks were farmers\n(50%), and nearly as many were fishermen (45%), with few (5%) involved in other\nprofessions. The incomes were low; 63% had an income of less than 55 pesos a day (less\nmore than 200 pesos a day (> $16). In this respect, the three ethnic groups did not differ,\nAttitude towards cousin marriage\nTo assess the attitudes towards cousin marriage, a paper and pencil questionnaire\nwas created that assessed the beliefs about the positive and negative effects of marrying a\ncousin. As is recommended in social psychological research, when assessing the beliefs we\nreferred to a specific behavior and the attitude was considered more positive, the more\npositive effects and the less negative effects, marrying a cousin was assumed to have. The\nquestionnaire was based on an extensive review of the literature on the assumed advantages\nand disadvantages of cousin marriages, as well as on a series of informal interviews with\nstudents and people from the community. The questionnaire consisted of 9 items, 4 of\nwhich expressed a negative, and 5 of which expressed a positive consequence of marrying\na cousin. At the beginning of the questionnaire, participants were presented with the\nstatement \"Marrying a cousin....\" Then the 9 items followed. The five positive statements\nincluded 1) means that you marry someone with the same values; 2) enhances the unity in\nthe family; 3) keeps wealth in the family; 4) makes it easier to get along with your spouse;\n5) makes your marriage more stable. The four negative statements included: 1) may lead to\nchildren having a high risk of defects; 2) is wrong for religious reasons; 4) leads to family\nconflict; 5) leads to a relationship without passion. Participants were asked to indicate on a\nscale from 1 (extremely disagree) to 5 (extremely agree) how much they were in agreement\nwith the 9 statements. A scale was made with all the negative items (alpha = .65, which\ncould be enhanced to .69 by deleting the item `Leads to a relationship without passion'),\nand a scale was made with all the positive items (alpha = .73). For the total scale of attitude\ntowards cousin marriage, the negative items were recoded, so that higher scores indicated a\nLife history and cousin marriage in Mexico\nmore positive attitude. The reliability of the total scale was .59 (which could be enhanced\nto by deleting the item `leads to a relationship without passion', alpha = .64). The scores\nwere divided by the number of items.\nLife history strategy.\nLife history strategy was measured with the Mini-K Life History Strategy Short\nForm (Figueredo et al., 2006), a 20-item short form of the Arizona Life History Battery\n(ALHB; Figueredo, 2007), which is a battery of cognitive and behavioral indicators of life\nhistory strategy compiled and adapted from various original sources. These self-report\npsychometric indicators measure graded individual differences on various complementary\nfacets of a coherent and coordinated life history strategy, as specified by life history theory,\nand converge upon a single multivariate latent construct, the \"slow\" factor. The component\nscales are scored directionally to indicate a \"slow\" life history strategy on the \"fast-slow\"\ncontinuum. In a series of psychometric studies, Figueredo and his colleagues (e.g.,\nFigueredo et al., 2005; 2006) have shown that a slow life history strategy can be\nconceptualized as a higher order construct characterized by a number of reproductive,\nparental and sexual behaviors, including good executive functions, positive relationships\nwith one's parents, positive attachment to an adult partner, low mating effort, low\nMachiavellianism, low levels of risk taking, more foresight and planning, and persistence\nand self-directedness. The Mini-K correlates 0.85 with the full ALHB (Gladden, Sisco, and\nFigueredo, 2008), and uses a 7-point Likert scale, which ranges from -3 (disagree strongly)\nto +3 (agree strongly). Alpha reliability in the present sample was .66.\nParental control of mate choice.\nTo assess the preferred degree of parental control of mate choice, the Parental\nInfluence on Mate choice (PIM) scale developed by Buunk, Park, and Duncan (2010) was\nused. This scale covers the range of possible forms of parental influence on mate choice\n(varying from complete autonomy of children to complete control by parents), and was\ndeveloped to be sensitive to variations in the degree of parental influence within and\nbetween cultures. For instance, it includes an item that seems to represent the extreme form\nof parental influence \u00ad the practice in which a daughter is treated as a kind of property that\nthe father is allowed to give to another man. As well as an item that represents the other\nextreme \u00ad the norm that children have the right to select their own partner without any\ninterference by their parents. All items had the format of a statement to which people could\nrespond on a 5-point scale from I disagree completely to I agree completely. Seven items\nconsisted of statements expressing parental influence on mate choice, whereas three items\nconsisted of statements expressing individual choice. In the present sample, the reliability\nwas low, alpha = .51. By omitting two items, the reliability could be raised to .60.\nHowever, to keep our results comparable to those of previous research, we decided to use\nthe same scale. The low alpha reliability is in itself not necessarily a problem, as the items\nwere explicitly chosen to represent the whole continuum of the scale, and when participants\nhave a clear preference for one level of control, they do not necessarily have a moderate\npreference for a related level of control. We return to this issue in the Discussion. The sum\nof the scale was divided by the number of items, M = 2.32, SD = .62.\nLife history and cousin marriage in Mexico\nResults\nAttitude towards cousin marriage\nResults revealed that, overall, participants did agree most with the negative\nstatements pertaining marrying a cousin and least with the positive statements (see Table\n1). A paired samples t-test was then conducted to determine if there was a significant\ndifference between the total mean ratings of positive and negative statements. Participants\ntowards marrying a cousin, t (199) = .98, p = .38. GLM analyses with gender and ethnic\ngroup as factors showed no significant main or interaction effects of ethnic group, Fs <\n1.37, ps > .25. We also examined if life history differed between men and women, and\nbetween the three ethnic groups. A GLM analysis with gender and ethnic group as factors\nshowed no significant effects, Fs < 1.37, ps > .26.\nTable 1. Attitudes towards cousin marriage\nMarrying a cousin ...

On average,\nparticipants were neutral with respect to the statement that marrying a cousin would mean\nthat you would marry someone with the same values. They were on average most, and very\nmuch, in agreement with the statement that marrying a cousin is wrong for religious\nreasons, nearly as much with the statement that marrying a cousin leads to family conflict,\nand somewhat less with the statement that marrying a cousin would lead to relationship\nwithout passion.

The results demonstrate that participants overall had a negative\nattitude to marrying a cousin, and that the three ethnic groups did not differ in this respect.\nUnlike what is often assumed, the main objection against marrying a cousin was that it is\nwrong for religious reasons, and the risk of genetic defects of children born out of such\nmarriages was considered relatively unimportant. In line with this, we found that, albeit\nonly among men, marrying a cousin was viewed more negatively the more religious one\nwas. Cousin marriage was neither considered to contribute to the quality or unity of\nmarriage and the family. These findings may suggest that the attitudes towards such\nmarriages differ from those in Western cultures where especially the risk of genetic defects\nof offspring is considered important (Ottenheimer, 1996), as well as from those in Eastern\npopulations where cousin marriages are considered to preserve the unity of the clan and the\nfamily (cf. Jaber et al., 1996). Furthermore, as predicted, we found a sex difference with\nwomen having overall a considerably more negative attitude towards cousin marriage than\nmen. This is in line with parental investment theory (Trivers, 1972). Since females invest\nthe most in conception, birth and postnatal care, investing in a potentially unviable\noffspring is extremely costly. Therefore, women may be more concerned that marrying a\ncousin leads to children that have a higher risk of being mentally and physically\nhandicapped. Regardless of whether or not progeny of cousins actually have an increased\nrisk of being handicapped, if it were believed that this indeed is the case then this would be\nmore salient for females than for males. Furthermore, the negative view of cousin marriage\nmay in part be the result of an evolved mechanism to prevent incest (Fessler and Navarrete,\nincluding the populations in the present research, this mechanism has extended beyond the\nimmediate family to include cousins. Cousins are always defined as family, and the notion\nof `family' may have become strongly conditioned to the notion `no sex allowed'.\nConsequently, it is possible that the mere mention of sexual relationships between family\nmembers could activate the incest avoidance mechanism.\nAs far as we know, this is the first study providing evidence in an indigenous\npopulation, i.e., the Mixtecs in Mexico, that life history strategy is quite strongly related to\nLife history and cousin marriage in Mexico\nattitudes towards cousin marriage. Our findings clearly suggest that especially in this\npopulation, more negative attitudes towards cousin marriages do reflect primarily a slow\nlife history strategy, characterized by typical features such as good executive functions,\npositive relationships with one's parents, low mating effort, lower levels of risk taking,\nhigher levels of foresight and planning, and more persistence and self-directedness.\nIndividuals with this type of strategy do seem to be relatively less inclined to run the risk of\nhaving offspring with genetic defects because of mating with kin. From a theoretical point\nof view this slow life history strategy maximizes long-term reproductive success (e.g.,\nFigueredo et al., 2006; Kaplan and Gangestad, 2005) by having fewer, high quality,\noffspring rather than having numerous lesser quality offspring, whose reproductive success\ndepends more on luck. Vice versa, a relatively less negative attitude towards cousin\nmarriage was found among those with a faster life history. As noted by Belsky et al.\n(1991), stressful experiences related to one's family background \u00ad such as marital discord\nor father absence \u00ad may lead individuals to invest disproportionately in mating as opposed\nto parenting. This may make one less selective in the choice of a mate, and less concerned\nabout the possible negative effects on fitness that mating with a cousin might have.\nPsychosexual development involves a self-assessment of one's socio-sexual capabilities\nand opportunities, calibrating optimal utilization of physical assets such as size, strength,\nhealth, and attractiveness, as well as psychosocial assets such as intelligence, self-efficacy,\nsocial skills, personality, and socioeconomic status or prospects (e.g., Hunter and\nWhile we did not find differences between the ethnic groups in their attitudes\ntowards cousin marriage, the effect of life history strategy was not only apparent among the\nMixtecs, but also among the Blacks. However, it was not found among the Mestizos,\nsuggesting that it is more typical of groups that are relatively peripheral in society. Indeed,\nalthough we are reluctant to over-interpret this finding, it is noteworthy that the effect of\nlife history strategy was not present among the group with the highest status in Mexican\nsociety, for whom apparently the attitude towards cousin marriage is not dependent on\none's preference for a fast or slow life history strategy. While the lower status groups \u00ad the\nMixtecs and the Blacks \u00ad did not differ from the Mestizos in terms of life history strategy\nand attitudes towards cousin marriage, within both groups there was meaningful variation\nin these attitudes, dependent on the extent to which one favored a slow or fast life history.\nIt must be emphasized that the lack of a relation between life history and attitudes towards\ncousin marriage among the Mestizos could not be due to a lower variance of these variables\nin this group, as the standard deviations did not differ between the three groups.\nAn additional finding was that, overall, those who approved of controlling the mate\nchoice of their offspring had a more positive, or less negative, attitude towards cousin\nmarriage. This suggests that, as expected, in general, fostering marriages with cousins may\nbe the ultimate consequence of the preference to control the mate choice of one's offspring\nby selecting in-group members as mates for one\u00b4s offspring. Indeed, a plethora of studies\nshows that in a wide variety of cultures, a major concern of parents is that the mate of their\noffspring comes from the same group (e.g., Buunk et al., 2008). A prime example of this\nare the various Islamic cultures such as Iran and Saudi Arabia where parents determine to\nan important extent whom their offspring marries, and where cousin marriages are very\nLife history and cousin marriage in Mexico\ncommon (Jaber et al., 1996). One of the benefits of having one's offspring marry a cousin\nis that family and clan alliances are strengthened, and loyalty from one's son and daughter-\nin-law better safeguarded.\nThis study has a number of potential limitations. First, except for life history\nstrategy and parental control over mate choice, we did not explore other factors that might\naffect the attitude towards cousin marriage, including disease avoidance, social isolation\nand scarcity of potential mates. Second, we do not know which aspect of life history\nstrategy is responsible for the effect on the attitudes towards marrying a cousin. For\ninstance, it may be a result of the fact that those with a slow life history strategy are in\ngeneral choosier, or are in general more cautious than those with a fast life history strategy\nare. Third, the reliability of the parental control measure was low in this sample, which may\nin part be because the items were developed to cover a wide range of behaviors and\nattitudes related to parental control of children's mate choice. As these items can be scaled,\nthis scale does not have the characteristics typical of a Likert scale. Nevertheless, the fact\nthat we did find such rather consistent and strong effects with this scale, suggests that the\nscale is a useful measure. Fourth, we had uneven numbers of participants in the three\ngroups, and especially Blacks were underrepresented, which may have reduced the power\nto find effects. However, it seems that most effects were robust enough to be found even in\nthe relatively small Black sample. Fifth, while we were primarily interested in the attitudes\nof the parents towards the mate choices of their children, and therefore collected data from\nparents with children of a marriageable age, the attitudes towards marrying a cousin were\nframed in a general way, and not particularly as they applied to the mate choice of their\nchildren. However, it seems very unlikely that parents would not have thought about their\nchildren when filling out the questions, or would have different standards in this respect for\ntheir children than for people in general. Finally, we cannot say with absolute certainty that\nthe samples were representative for the populations studied, as, for example, a number of\npeople refused to participate, and it was not possible to draw a random sample from each\ngroup. Nevertheless, the data collection was done very conscientiously, and there is no\nreason to assume that there is a substantial bias in the sample. To conclude then, we\ncollected data from parents in a unique setting, i.e., a rural region with different ethnic\ngroups that live in close contact with each other. We included in our research in addition to\nan indigenous people, i.e., the Mixtecs, also Mestizos \u00ad who constitute the majority of\nMexican inhabitants \u00ad as well as the rarely studied Black Mexican people. By examining\nhow cultural factors may affect the factors affecting attitudes towards cousin marriage, our\nresearch underlines that a resistance against cousin marriage is, dependent on the ethnic\ngroup, related to life history, and overall, to parental control of the mate choice of one's\noffspring. This suggests that marrying a cousin may often not just be a matter of\nindividuals freely selecting a mate, but may to an important extent be affected by the\nparents. In general, our research further exemplifies that for a more complete understanding\nof human mating, future research must attend more carefully to the role of life history and\nparental control of mate choice in affecting attitudes and behaviors concerning cousin\nmarriages.\n"
