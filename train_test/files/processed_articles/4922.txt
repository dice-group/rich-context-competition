This is perceived as responding to the\nlearners' interest and needs. In every classroom, some chil-\ndren need special attention and planning for them to be able\nto meet up to the teachers'expectations. However, some chil-\ndren lack pre-requisite skills and knowledge, which are\nappropriate for their age. Such children are referred to as\n\"learning-disabled\" children. Learning is an enduring change\nin the way an organism responds based on the organism's\nexperiences (Drew, 2002). Therefore, learning has to do with\nchange in behavior due to environmental and developmental\ninfluences. For Igbo (2012), learning is knowledge facili-\ntated through experiences within the school and outside the\nschool environments. Learning is seen as internal events that\ngo inside the students' brain.\nFor Kuppuswamy (2010), learning is the process by\nwhich an organism, as a result of its interaction with a situa-\ntion, acquires a new mode of behavior, which tends to persist\nand affect the general behavioral pattern of the organism to\nsome degree.\nThe ability to create learning connections through the\napplication of teacher-made instructional materials are the\nskills through which children develop new combinations and\nrelationships in organizing ideas, symbols, objects, and\nwords (Charlesworth, 1996). Ordinarily, teacher-made\ninstructional materials create curiosity for the learning-dis-\nabled child who may seize this opportunity to explore and\ncreate. These abilities to explore and create often tend to\nincrease the children's knowledge and cognitive\ndevelopment.\nChildren learn a lot from their teachers through the pro-\ncess of applying instructional materials. Bello (1999) is of\nthe opinion that the provision and utilization of teacher-made\ninstructional materials will promote the intellectual ability of\nchildren. Probably, this is because instructional materials act\nas motivator to the children and will equally awaken their\ninterest, more especially children with learning disabilities.\nLearning disabilities refer to certain kinds of disorders in\nthe basic psychological process of individuals. These disor-\nders have to do with intrinsic factors such as specific defects\nin information processing or the ability to learn (Mangal,\n2011). The disorders manifest with significant difficulties in\nlanguage acquisition and ability to solve simple mathemati-\ncal problems. Such children are not as efficient as their class-\nmates or age-mates without learning difficulties.\nGenerally, learning disability is a broad terminology that\nis used to cover different conditions whose major character-\nistic is significant impairment of mental functioning.\nLearning disabilities are described differently all over the\nworld. This implies that there is no consensus or agreement\n1University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nJanet N.

Igbo1 and Joachim C. Omeje1\n Keywords\nlearning disabilities, mathematics disability, teacher-made instructional materials, education\n2 SAGE Open\non the definition of learning disabilities. Recently, children\nwith learning difficulties have been referred to as handi-\ncapped, subnormal, or retarded. In short, all children with\nintellectual deficits, however profound, are referred to as\nlearning-disabled children (Bennett, 2011). The explanation\nof this is that learning-disabled children are children with\nlearning difficulties, no matter how minor or severe the\nlearning problem might be.\nLearning disability is a type of helplessness or handicap\nthat can be felt by the learner in terms of his or her academic\nperformance in the same way as experienced by a mentally\ndisabled child in terms of his or her mental functioning\n(Mangal, 2011). This implies that learning-disabled children\nare children who undergo extra stress in learning. These are\nchildren who have difficulties in their academic perfor-\nmances, in spite of the fact that they are not mentally\nimpaired, do not lack learning opportunities, and have no\nemotional difficulties or problems.\nMathematics is important in the life of every individual.\nThis is because individuals come in contact with mathemat-\nics directly or indirectly as they interact with people. For the\nNational Institute of Mental Health United States (1990),\nmathematics has to do with the recognition of facts, under-\nstanding abstract concepts such as fractions and place values.\nMathematics disability can be attached to a number of fac-\ntors running from individual perception, problems in cogni-\ntive functioning, and inappropriate instruction. Therefore,\nmathematics disability has to do with pupils' inability to co-\nordinate properly.\nGarofalo and Lester (1985) listed four categories of activ-\nities involved in mathematics problem solving as orientation,\norganization, execution, and verification. This implies that\nfor a child to operate appropriately in mathematics, the child\nrequires these qualities.\nFor the purpose of this study, mathematics-disabled chil-\ndren are children who operate 2 years below the standard\nfrom their classmates. In addition, the continuous assessment\nscores were equally used as a criterion for declaring children\nas mathematics disabled.\nTeacher-made instructional materials are constructed\nteaching materials developed by teachers in their respective\nsubjects or subject areas for easy teaching and learning.\nOtuka (2004) sees teacher-made instructional materials as\nimprovised teaching materials. In this case, the teacher acts\nas the improviser by composing instructional or teaching\nmaterials that will make teaching and learning easy. It\ninvolves the ability of the teacher to make or invent teaching\nmaterials in the absence of already made instructional mate-\nrials for the purpose of meaningful interaction between the\nteacher and the learners in the classroom.\nTeacher-made instructional materials are the teaching\nresources that are purposely designed by the teacher or by\nboth teacher and pupils mainly to promote meaningful teach-\ning and learning in the classroom (Crawford, 2003). These\nare usually teacher-initiated instructional materials which are\nused to facilitate teaching and learning processes. Going by\nthis definition, teacher-made instructional materials will\nhave some positive effect on mathematics-disabled children\nand will also improve their level of understanding in class-\nroom situations under which teaching process usually take\nplace. This means that teacher-made instructional materials\nwill foster or boost the learners' cognitive learning\nprocesses.\nTeacher-made instructional materials can provide the\ndriving force or incentive for children to explore and dis-\ncover already stated objectives. This can be acquired by the\nmanipulation of these instructional materials and will boost\nthe interest of children toward achieving the stated objec-\ntives. Changing the pattern of teaching and learning by\napplying these teacher-made materials will excite learning-\ndisabled children and make them explore, by being creative\nand seeking for what is new in the usage of teacher-made\ninstructional materials.\nThompson (2001) has also observed that the application\nof instructional materials tend to sustain and attract chil-\ndren's attention, and make teaching and learning more inter-\nesting irrespective of the gender.\nGender means culturally specified assignments or post of\ntraits and roles to human beings. Culturally, in some coun-\ntries, there are roles expected from girls and boys, respec-\ntively. According to Martin and Osborne (1992), the process\nbegins with labels. For instance an infant is called a boy or a\ngirl and dressed in blue or pink, respectively. These affect\nchildren directly or indirectly even in their academic perfor-\nmances and academic achievements. In a study carried out\nby Mbajiogu F.O.(2002) on male and female students'\nachievement in biology, the findings indicated that male stu-\ndents performed better than their female counterparts. It is\nassumed that with the application of teacher-made instruc-\ntional materials, the possibility of both girls and boys improv-\ning is not ruled out. Besides, the difference in their academic\nachievement might not be significant.\nStone and Michael (1986) carried out a study on objects\nsorting on mathematics-disabled children. The researchers\nused tasks ranging from objects sorting and concept attain-\nment to more complex hypothesis testing. The findings indi-\ncated that mathematics-disabled children struggled to\nidentify critical attributes in tasks and are ineffective in their\nuse of feedback.\nIn another study carried out by Otto and Smith (1980) on\nobjects sorting in mathematics, the findings indicated that\nduring the pre-primary and primary years, many children\ncannot sort objects by size, match objects, understand the\nlanguage of mathematics, or grasp the concept of rational\ncounting.\nIn a study carried out by Young (2003) on the application\nof cartoons in teaching Grades 6 to 9 students, the findings\nindicated that cartoons acted as visual aid and equally\nincreased the learning achievement acquired by students. If\nthis is so, the implication is that teacher-made instructional\nIgbo and Omeje 3\nmaterials that are mostly visual teaching aid will go a long\nway in minimizing the mathematics disability of children in\nthe primary school.\nAccording to the findings of Olaitan,S.O. and Akpan, A.E\ndences indicate that learning processes carried out through\nteacher-made instructional materials such as visual aids,\nflash cards, pictures, and cards have been effectively used in\nteaching and learning at pre-primary and primary school lev-\nels. Therefore, most of the findings on the efficacy of teacher-\nmade instructional materials were from outside Nigeria.\nFrom literatures reviewed so far, it is obvious that the\neffective application of teacher-made instructional materials\nis important and needs to be addressed in Nigeria, with par-\nticular reference to mathematics-disabled children. If this\nproblem is addressed appropriately, it might reduce or mini-\nmize mathematics disabilities among children in Nigeria.\nThis is the thrust of the study.\nThe study examined the perceived efficacy of teacher-\nmade instructional materials in the promotion of learning\namong mathematics-disabled children. Specifically, the\nstudy determines the perceived efficacy of teacher-made\ninstructional materials in promoting learning among primary\n5 mathematics-disabled pupils. The following research ques-\ntion guided the study:\nResearch Question 1: What is the perceived efficacy of\nteacher-made instructional material in promoting learning\namong primary 5 mathematics-disabled children?\nHypothesis 1: One hypothesis tested at .05 level of sig-\nnificance guided the study.\n: There is no significant difference between the mean\nratings of male and female pupils with regard to perceived\nefficacy of teacher-made instructional materials among\nmathematics-disabled pupils.\nMethod\nThe study applied survey design. This is because it involves\nassessing opinions, preferences, and perceptions (Cohen,\nManion, & Morrison, 2011). The survey design was used for\ngathering data on pupils' opinions and perceptions on effi-\ncacy of teacher-made instructional materials.\nThe study was carried out in Nsukka Central Education\nZone, which is made up of five sub-zones: Enugu Road,\nOdenigbo, Leja, Obimo, and Obukpa sub-zones. The area\nwas chosen because of the poor learning attitudes, which cre-\nated mathematics problems for the pupils. Therefore, the\nresearchers examined whether teacher-made instructional\nmaterials will help enhance learning among mathematics-\ndisabled children.\nThe population of the study was 155 primary 5 learning-\ndisabled pupils in Nsukka Central Education Zone (Source:\nNsukka Central Education Authority). This is made up of 82\nmale and 73 female pupils. The teachers identified these\npupils as mathematics-disabled children based on their\nyearly performances. It is expected that at primary 5, pupils\nmust have acquired mathematics skills.\nRandom sampling technique was adopted in selecting 25\nprimary schools for the study. Purposive sampling technique\nwas adopted to select the mathematics-disabled children in\nthe schools selected. There were altogether 155 mathemat-\nics-disabled children who were identified by their teachers in\nthe schools, and all the pupils were involved in the study. In\nidentifying the mathematics-disabled children, the research-\ners involved the teachers who provided the continuous\nassessment records of the children. The researchers requested\nfrom the teachers to select those children who were experi-\nencing mathematics disabilities. This was provided by the\nteachers based on the pupils' continuous assessment records.\nThese children were selected based on the pupils' uneven\nperformances across the school subjects and particularly in\nmathematics.\nInstrument and Method of Data Analysis\nThe technique for data collection was through question-\nnaires. The cut-off point for the decision making was 2.5.\nTherefore, 2.5 and above were regarded as acceptable for the\nperceived efficacy level of the teacher-made instructional\nmaterials. Mean and standard deviation were used in answer-\ning the research question, while t-test was used to test the\nhypothesis.\nIn collecting the data, 155 copies of the questionnaire\nwere personally distributed to the pupils by the researchers\nwith the help of two research assistants. Copies of the ques-\ntionnaire were distributed to the pupils almost immediately.\nTwo research assistants helped the researchers in the distri-\nbution and retrieval of the questionnaire. The return rate was\nThe instrument was face validated by three experts in\neducational psychology guidance and counseling and an\nexpert in measurement and evaluation all from the University\nof Nigeria, Nsukka. Some items were deleted while some\nwere restructured to meet the standard.\nThe researchers subjected the validated instrument to trial\ntesting with 20 primary 5 mathematics-disabled pupils in\nEnugu Urban. These pupils are outside the research area. To\nascertain the internal consistency of the instrument\nCronbach's alpha was used. The Cronbach's coefficient for\nthe internal consistency was 0.78. Mean and standard devia-\ntion were used in answering the research question, while\nt-test was applied in testing the hypothesis.\nResults\nFrom the table, the data indicate that 15 items out of 18 items\nindication is that, there is a general acceptance of the items\non the application of teacher-made instructional materials as\n4 SAGE Open\na way for enhancing teaching and learning among the learn-\ning-disabled children in the primary schools studied.\nHowever, only 3 items have indications of \"disagree.\"\nThe mean score is above the criterion mean of 2.5.\nTherefore, the means scores are evidence that teacher-made\ninstructional materials can help enhance learning among the\nlearning-disabled children.\nThe data on Table 2 indicate that male pupils had a mean\nscore of 3.00 while the female pupils had a mean score of\n3.15. The data were analyzed using t-test analysis, to enable\nthe researcher find out whether there is a significant differ-\nence existing between the rating of male and female pupils.\nThe result indicates that there was no significant difference\nbetween the mean rating of male and female pupils in their\nperception of teacher-made instructional materials. This is\nsimply because the result is less than a .05 level of signifi-\ncance by which the hypothesis was tested. This implies that\nthe effect due to gender is not significant at the .05 level of\nsignificance. Therefore, the null hypothesis is accepted.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of the study was to ascertain the perception of\nprimary school children on the use of teacher-made instruc-\ntional materials. The results revealed that teachers enrich the\nperformance of learning-disabled children by utilizing\nteacher-made instructional materials in teaching. This could\nbe attributed to the fact that the children came in contact with\nthe teaching materials. They had the opportunity to see, feel,\nand sometimes touch the objects and this might have appealed\nto their various sense organs. In addition, the results indi-\ncated that pupils feel comfortable and relaxed whenever\nteacher-made instructional materials were used. They learn\nfaster, achieve more, and prefer contact with teacher-made\ninstructional materials. This is in line with Gillingham and\nTable 1.

The results of the\ngrand mean score of 3.09, with the criterion bench mark of\n2.50, is evidence on the influence of teacher-made instructional\nmaterials. The above result is also in line with the finding of\nIgbo (2006) that the use of real objects in the teaching of learn-\ning-disabled children is very effective and highly significant.\nOn the male and female pupils taught using teacher-made\ninstructional materials, the finding revealed that there is no\nsignificant difference in the mean ratings. This is in line with\nfound no difference in the achievement of children based on\ngender. This finding could be attributed to the fact that both\nmale and female pupils were all taught under the same envi-\nronment and condition by the teachers. When this is achieved,\nthe teacher has successfully made learning connections\nthrough the teacher-made instructional materials. For the fact\nthat the teaching materials are created by the teacher, he or\nshe ensures that the environment is not threatening and learn-\ning becomes easier. Teachers are always ready to take steps\nand learning becomes easier to increase motivation and con-\ntinuous desire for the learners to learn from the new situation\nwhich the teacher has created. Usually, when education\ninvolves the processes of constructing physical and logical\nmathematical evidences, the teacher's role is more of facili-\ntating learning and initiating the instruction.\nGenerally, the findings revealed that among the 18 items\nstated, 16 items were agreed on by the respondents as items\nthat could help in the process of learning using teacher-made\ninstructional materials in primary schools. The favorable rat-\ning of the teacher-made instructional materials with high\nagreement by respondents indicated that it is necessary to lay\nmore emphasis on teacher-made instructional materials. This\nis in agreement with Olaitan,S.O. and Akpan, A.E (2003),\nwho found already made materials such as audio and visual\nand flash cards relevant in the process of teaching pre-pri-\nmary and primary school children. In support of the findings,\nWeikart (2000) also indicated that visual teaching aids, cards,\nand pictures have been found relevant in enhancing teaching\nand learning at the primary school level. The findings could\nbe attributed to the fact that children are usually attracted by\npictures, actions, and demonstrations. Besides, from the\nobservation made by the researchers, primary school-level\nchildren are very good in imitating and using their teachers\nas role models.\nConcluding Remarks\nThe result, as indicated by the study, shows that the use of\nteacher-made instructional materials was highly useful in\nenhancing the learning-disabled children's performance in\nthe classroom as perceived by the children in this study.\nThere is the indication that there is no significant differ-\nence between male and female pupils taught using teacher-\nmade instructional materials. Therefore, the place of\nteacher-made instructional materials in the process of\nteaching and learning cannot be over emphasized. They\nattract the attention of pupils and enable them to contribute\nto discussions on the topics being taught, using the materi-\nals to illustrate and in that process store the information\nacquired in their long-term memory for further\napplication.\nRecommendations\nThe following recommendations were made based on the\nfindings of the study:\n1. Teacher-made instructional materials should be\nincluded for teaching all the subjects in primary\nschools to enable children to get information from\nthe primary source.\n2. The curriculum planners should encourage teachers\nto use teacher-made instructional materials by paying\nspecific allowance, basically, for this purpose.\n3. Curriculum planners should make use of the findings\nof this study to revisit and review the application of\nteacher-made instructional materials for enhancing\nteaching and learning.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBello, H.
