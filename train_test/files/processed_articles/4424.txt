Using scenarios involving high-risk acts, the prediction was confirmed for\nheroic (brave, altruistic) but not for non-heroic (brave, non-altruistic) acts. Apparently,\nwomen's concerns over risks to their mates overrode any positive signal value of men's\nrisk taking, when the acts were highly risky and had no redeeming practical value.\nThe present studies revisited the costly-signaling hypothesis using both medium- and high-\nrisk scenarios, and it was predicted that for non-heroic acts women would prefer risk takers\nover risk avoiders for medium-level risks but not for highly risky acts. The prediction was\nsupported in two studies. In Study 1, risk takers were preferred for non-heroic medium-risk\nacts, but risk avoiders were preferred for high-risk acts. For heroic acts, risk takers were\npreferred for both high- and medium-risk acts. Study 2 crossed two act risk levels with two\nactor skill levels, with non-heroic risks. Risk takers were preferred for the least risky\ncombination (medium-risk act, high-skill actor) and also for the two moderately risky\ncombinations, but risk avoiders were preferred for the riskiest combination (high-risk act,\nmedium-skill actor). In Study 1, participants compared high-level risk takers versus risk\navoiders on several person adjectives. Both heroic and non-heroic risk takers were\nperceived as more brave, athletic, physically fit, impulsive, attention-seeking, and foolish,\nand less emotionally stable and self-controlled, compared to risk avoiders. But only heroic\nrisk takers were perceived as more altruistic, agreeable, conscientious, and sexy than risk\navoiders.\n",

For example, the signaled qualities might make\nthe signaler more attractive as a mate or as a hunting or coalition partner. In order for costly\nsignaling behaviors to persist and to possibly become evolved behavioral adaptations, two\nother requirements, besides potential benefits to the signaler, must be met. The signal must\nbe truly costly or risky, so that it cannot be faked, and noticing of the signal must be of\nsome benefit to the one who notices it (such as the potential mate or coalition partner). For\nexample, Hawkes and Bleigh Bird (2002) have explained the persistence of hunting among\nmales as a case of costly signaling, in hunter-gatherer-gardener societies where hunting is a\nrelatively inefficient way of obtaining food. Successful hunting shows a man's skill and\ncourage and physical fitness, and it also shows generosity when he shares the meat with\nothers, without expecting or receiving any reciprocation in kind. In the modern world,\ncharitable giving or blood donating may be cases of costly signaling.\nCostly signaling theory is a descendant of Zahavi's (1977; Zahavi and Zahavi,\n1997) handicap hypothesis, designed to explain certain sex differences in structure or\nbehavior among animals (for example, the peacock's heavy plumage), and of Hawke's\n(1991) show-off hypothesis, intended to explain some aspects of human male behavior as\nattention-getting behavior to attract females. Costly signaling theory is broader in\nconception than the show-off hypothesis, in that it allows that costly signaling might be\ndone by either males or females, and that the intended recipients might be of either the\nsame or opposite sex.\nFarthing (2005) tested a hypothesis derived from costly signaling theory in regard to\nphysical risk taking. Two facts about physical risk taking are particularly striking: (1) It is\ndone much more by men than by women, and (2) it is done more by men of peak\nreproductive age (late teens, early 20s) than by older or younger males (Arnett, 1995;\nByrnes, Miller and Schafer, 1999; Irwin, 1993). These differences have been shown for a\nvariety of different physically risky activities, such as risky sports, fast driving, aggression,\nand petty crime. They also occur for the special case of homicide, for which Wilson and\nDaly (1985) coined the term \"the young male syndrome.\" The term is appropriate also for\nnon-homicidal physical risk taking by young males.\nFarthing (2005; also Kelly and Dunbar, 2001) suggested that part of the explanation\nfor the young male syndrome in regard to physical risk taking may be that it is a costly\nsignal designed to attract the favorable attention of young women. When a man engages in\na physically risky activity, such as skiing fast down the expert slope or climbing up a steep\nmountain, he is displaying his athleticism, physical fitness and courage. Thinking back to\nhuman ancestral times, for women these characteristics would be desirable in a potential\nmate, since they suggest that a man is athletic, brave and healthy and capable of being a\ngood provider for a woman and her children. A man with such traits would also presumably\nhave \"good genes\" for making healthy children. In the modern world, aside from war, men\nrarely have an opportunity to demonstrate their bravery and physical prowess by doing\npractical things, such as hunting big game with spears. Such qualities can usually be shown\nonly in rather arbitrary, non-practical risky activities, such as risky sports. One practical\nrisk-taking situation that occasionally arises, however, is an opportunity for heroism, when\nNeither daredevils nor wimps\none takes physical risks in order to save someone else's life (for example, jumping into a\nriver to save a drowning person). Heroic risk taking should be doubly attractive to a\npotential mate, since it indicates not only courage and physical prowess, but also altruism.\nFarthing (2005) predicted that women would be significantly more attracted to men\nwho are physical risk takers, compared to risk avoiders, for both heroic and non-heroic\nrisky acts. Participants read several scenarios in which a person had to decide whether to\nengage in a physically risky act. Some scenarios involved heroic acts (both physically risky\nand altruistic, such as saving a child from a fire), whereas others were non-heroic (e.g.\nwhitewater kayaking, high-speed driving, traveling alone in a dangerous country). All of\nthe acts were explicitly characterized as \"very risky.\" Participants were asked to indicate\ntheir relative degree of preference, as a long-term mate, for a person who decides to take\nthe risk versus one who decides not to take the risk.\nFarthing's (2005) results supported the costly signaling theory prediction for a set\nof four heroic risky acts: both men and women significantly preferred risk takers over risk\navoiders as potential mates, with the preference being greater for female participants than\nfor males. However, the prediction was not supported for a set of ten non-heroic physical\nrisks: neither women nor men preferred risk takers as mates, and in fact, both women and\nmen significantly preferred risk avoiders over risk takers for non-heroic risks, on the\naverage.\nIn explaining the unexpected contrary results regarding women's preferences for\nnon-heroic risk takers, Farthing (2005) pointed to the fact that all of the risky acts had been\nexplicitly characterized as \"very risky.\" He suggested that women (and men) prefer mates\nwho avoid highly-risky, non-heroic acts because they don't want their mates to be seriously\ninjured or killed doing things that have no compensating practical or altruistic value, such\nas heroic life saving. Thus, though women might be attracted to men who display traits\nsuch as bravery, athleticism, and physical fitness, such a preference could be overcome by\nconcerns about the potential mate's personal safety.\nThe question arises, then, whether women would be attracted to takers of non-\nheroic physical risks if the risks were not too great. Perhaps the original hypothesis, that\nwomen would prefer non-heroic physical risk takers over risk avoiders as mates, would\nhold true for activities described as only low to medium in riskiness. In other words, while\nwomen might not want daredevils as mates (they would prefer avoiders of high risks), they\nwould not want wimps, either (they would prefer risk takers over risk avoiders for\nmoderate risks).\nThus, it seems worthwhile to re-open the question of attitudes toward risk takers as\nmates by examining the effects of the degree of riskiness of the act in question. The level of\nriskiness of an act for a particular individual can be affected by two different factors: (1)\nactivity riskiness per se, that is, inherent features of the risky act and/or the situation itself\n(such as steeper mountain ski slopes, more turbulent whitewater rivers, faster driving\nspeeds, two bullies or one), and (2) the skill of the actor for the relevant action (e.g. his/her\nexperience and skill at skiing, kayaking, driving, self-defense). When the actor is more\nskilled, his or her effective risk level is lower than for the less skilled actor, regardless of\nthe inherent riskiness of the situation.\nStudy 1 examined the effect of activity riskiness per se, for both heroic and non-\nNeither daredevils nor wimps\nheroic physical risks, on women's preferences for risk takers versus risk avoiders as long\nterm mates. It was predicted that preferences for risk-taking mates would be inversely\nrelated to the riskiness of the acts. More specifically, in accordance with the derivation\nfrom costly-signaling theory, for non-heroic physical risks women would prefer risk takers\nas mates where the risk level was only low to moderate, but in accordance with prior results\n(Farthing, 2005), it was predicted that women would prefer risk avoiders where the risk\nlevel was very high. Also, in accordance with prior results, it was predicted that the level of\npreference for heroic risk takers would be greater than for non-heroic risk takers, at both\nhigh and moderate risk levels.\nIn Study 2 the relationship between risk level and preference for risk-takers versus\nrisk avoiders as mates was further examined by varying both the inherent riskiness of the\nrisky act and the actor's skill level for the required action, for non-heroic physical risks. It\nwas predicted that both factors would affect preferences, such that preference for risk-\ntakers as mates would be greatest for highly-skilled actors taking moderate risks, and\nlowest for moderately-skilled actors taking high-level risks.\nStudy 1: Heroic vs. Non-Heroic Risk Takers\nWomen rated their degree of preference for risk-takers versus risk-avoiders in 16\ndifferent risky-decision scenarios, in a study with a repeated-measures design involving 2\nrisk types (heroic vs. non-heroic) X 2 risk levels (high vs. medium). After reading each\nscenario, participants indicated their degree of preference for either the risk taker or the risk\navoider as a long-term mate. Participants also rated the perceived riskiness of each of the\nscenarios, so that relationships between perceived riskiness and mate preferences could be\ncompared across all 16 scenarios.\nA secondary purpose of Study 1 was to assess women's perceptions of risk takers\nversus risk avoiders for a number of person adjectives. It was predicted that risk takers\nwould be perceived as more brave and athletic than risk avoiders. In addition, it was\npredicted that heroic risk takers would be perceived as more altruistic and conscientious\nthan non-heroic risk takers.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants were undergraduate women at the University of Maine. As an incentive\nto participate they received bonus points in their introductory psychology course. Since it\nwas not possible to obtain a broadly representative sample, it was decided to create a more\nhomogenous sample by selecting only participants of American or Canadian nationality. In\naddition, since questions about mate preferences are most important for younger women,\nonly women under age 30 were selected. About 5-10% of potential participants were\neliminated because of these constraints. Usable data were obtained from 76 women (mean\nAfter signing consent forms, participants responded to three questionnaires in the\nfollowing sequence: (1) Activity Riskiness Questionnaire; (2) Person Adjectives Scale; and\n(3) Attitudes toward Risk Takers Questionnaire.\nRisk scenarios. The 16 risk scenarios involved four different heroic risk situations\nNeither daredevils nor wimps\nand four non-heroic risk situations. Each risk situation was used in two different scenarios,\nwith one described as and labeled as \"very risky\" and the other described as and labeled as\n\"somewhat risky.\" The four heroic risk situations were saving a child from a burning\nhouse, saving a child from a river, defending a child from a bully, and saving a skater who\nhas fallen through the ice on a lake. The four non-heroic physical risk situations were\nAlpine (downhill) skiing, speeding in a car, defending oneself from a mugger, and\nswimming in a lake. The first three scenarios in each list were similar to those used by\nFarthing (2005). See the appendix for the wording of all 16 scenarios on the Attitudes\ntoward Risk Takers Questionnaire.\nExamples of heroic and non-heroic risk scenarios:\nHeroic high-risk scenario: \"While walking near the shore of a frozen lake, Person sees a\nskater fall through the ice into the freezing water. After a minute of struggling the skater cries\n\"Help! I can't get out!\" Person sees that the skater is far from shore, and the ice near her\nlooks barely thick enough to support someone. Person is tempted to approach and try to\nrescue the skater, though he thinks it would be very risky to do so. The alternative is to go find\nsomeone who can help. Person is somewhat knowledgeable about ice rescues; he has watched\na TV show about it.\" (Italics not in the original.)\nHeroic medium-risk scenario: The scenario was the same as above, except for the part in\nitalics: \"Person sees that the skater is not far from shore, and the ice near her looks thick and\nsolid. Person is tempted to approach and try to rescue the skater, though he thinks it would be\nsomewhat risky to do so.\"\nNon-heroic high-risk scenario: \"While sitting on a beach at a lake, Person sees a small boat\nanchored about 400 yards from shore (almost \u00bc mile). It is a cool, windy day, and the water is\ncold and choppy. Person is tempted to try to swim out to the boat and back, though he thinks it\nwould be very risky to do so. The alternative is to stay on shore. Person is a moderately skilled\nswimmer.\"\nNon-heroic medium-risk scenario: The same as above, except for the part in italics:\n\"Person sees a small boat anchored about 200 yards from shore (almost 1/8 mile). It is a\nsunny day and the water is calm and warm. Person is tempted to try to swim out to the boat\nand back, though he thinks it would be somewhat risky to do so.\"\nIn all scenarios the actor (Person) was described as moderately skilled or\nknowledgeable about the risky action, in order to reduce variability that might result from\ndifferent participants making different assumptions about Person's skill level.\nActivity Riskiness Questionnaire. The 16 scenarios were presented in matching high\nand moderate-risk pairs, with heroic and non-heroic pairs alternating, and the more risky\nscenario presented first in each pair. Below each scenario was a question about how risky it\nwould be for Person to try to do the risky activity. Participants responded by marking a\nshort vertical line across a 14 cm horizontal scale. The scale was marked \"0, Not at all\nrisky\" at the left end, and \"100, Extremely risky\" at the right end. The scale was divided by\nvertical hashmarks into ten segments corresponding to 10, 20, etc. (the hashmarks were not\nlabeled).\nPerson Adjectives Scale. Only the eight high risk scenarios (comparable to those\nused by Farthing, 2005) were used in the Person Adjectives Scale, since the focus of this\nNeither daredevils nor wimps\npart of the study was on the comparison of heroic vs. non-heroic risk takers. Heroic and\nnon-heroic scenarios were alternated. Following each scenario, two persons were\ndescribed, where Person A decides not to take the risk and Person B decides to go ahead\nand take the risk. For example, for the ice-skater rescue scenario:\nPerson A decides to go find someone who can help.\nPerson B decides to go ahead and try to rescue the skater from the icy water.\nBelow that were lines labeled 1 through 18. Each number label was followed by a\ndifferent adjective. Participants were asked to compare Person B and Person A on the\nperson adjective by circling a digit on a seven point -3 to +3 scale. For example:\n\"Impulsive. Person B (risk taker) is ___ impulsive as/than Person A (risk avoider).\" Cover-\npage instructions defined the ratings as follows: -3 much less; -2 less; -1 slightly less; 0\nequally as; +1 slightly more; +2 more; +3 much more.) See Table 1 for the full list of\nadjectives.\nAttitudes toward Risk Takers Questionnaire. All 16 risk scenarios were used; they\nwere presented in a quasi-random sequence. Each scenario was followed by a description\nof the decisions by Person A (risk avoider) and Person B (risk taker), as in the Person\nAdjectives Scale. Below that was the question: \"Which person, A or B, would be more\ndesirable to you as a long-term mate or spouse, other things being equal?\" Participants\nresponded by making a short vertical line through a 15 cm scale. The scale was divided into\nten equal segments by vertical hashmarks, but only the middle and end points were labeled.\nAt the left end the scale was labeled \"100, A is much more desirable than B,\" the right end\nwas labeled \"100, B is much more desirable than A,\" and the middle hashmark was labeled\n\"0, A and B are equally desirable.\"\nResults\nAttitudes toward risk takers. Cronbach alpha reliability coefficients for mate\npreference ratings for the four scenarios within each condition (2 risk types x 2 risk levels)\nwere moderate but high enough to justify using the condition means of each subject in\nfurther data analyses. Alphas were .79, .76, .67 and .62 for the high-risk heroic, low-risk\nheroic, high-risk non-heroic, and low-risk non-heroic conditions, respectively.\nFigure 1 shows the mean mate preference ratings for each of the four conditions: 2\nrisk types (heroic vs. non-heroic) x 2 risk levels (medium vs. high). Note that in the data\nfigures, preferences for Person A (risk avoider) are indicated as negative values to\ndistinguish them from preferences for Person B (risk taker). However, negative values were\nnot used on the response scale itself, in order to avoid any connotation that negative was\nsomehow less desirable than positive.\nA repeated-measures GLM analysis (SPSS for Windows 12.0) of 2 risk types X 2\nfor risk takers as mates was greater for heroic risks than for non-heroic physical risks, and\ngreater for medium risks than for high-level risks. The interaction effect indicated that the\neffect of risk level was somewhat greater for non-heroic risks than for heroic risks.\nAn additional analysis used single-sample t-tests (two-tailed) to compare each of\nNeither daredevils nor wimps\nthe four mate-preference means in Figure 1 against the zero reference level (no preference).\nFor heroic risks, women significantly preferred risk takers over risk avoiders as mates for\n= .15. For non-heroic risks, women significantly preferred risk takers over risk avoiders for\nmoderately risky tasks, t = 4.48, p < .001, but for highly risky tasks they significantly\npreferred risk avoiders over risk takers, t = - 6.69, p < .001.\nFigure 1. Women's mean preference ratings for risk-takers versus risk-avoiders as long-\nterm mates, for medium- and high-risk heroic and non-heroic physical risks.

The vertical bars represent the standard errors of the means.\nMedium High\nRisk Level\nMate Preference\nRisk Avoider Risk Taker\nHeroic Risks\nNon-heroic\nMean riskiness ratings were 71.4, 66.5 for high-risk heroic and non-heroic\nscenarios, respectively, and 43.9 and 34.6 for medium-risk heroic and non-heroic scenarios,\nrespectively, on the zero to 100 riskiness scale. A 2 x 2 GLM repeated-measures analysis\nThe intent had been to design scenarios that were identical in perceived riskiness for heroic\nNeither daredevils nor wimps\nand non-heroic risks at each risk level, on the average. However, the fact that the heroic\nrisk scenarios were perceived as slightly riskier than the non-heroic scenarios indicates that\nthe finding that heroic risk takers were more preferred than non-heroic risk takers (Figure\n1) cannot be explained by assuming that the heroic scenarios were less risky.\nPerceived riskiness varied across the four individual risk scenarios in each of the\nfour risk type x risk level conditions. The scatterplot in Figure 2 shows that the mean\ndegree of preference for risk takers as mates was significantly negatively correlated with\nmean perceived riskiness across all eight risk scenarios, for both heroic (r = -.91, df = 6, p <\n.01) and non-heroic risk scenarios (r = -.89, p < .01). The scatterplot also shows that at any\nparticular perceived riskiness level, the preference for risk taker mates is greater for heroic\nthan for non-heroic physical risks.\nIn addition, within each of the four risk type by risk level conditions there was a\nsignificant negative correlation across participants between mean mate preference ratings\nand mean perceived riskiness, r = -.38, -.37, -.45, and -.-44, for the high-risk heroic, low-\nrisk heroic, high-risk non-heroic, and low-risk non-heroic conditions, respectively (all df =\nFigure 2.

Risk\nNeither daredevils nor wimps\nPerson adjectives. Table 1 shows the mean ratings for each of the 18 adjectives of\nthe Person Adjectives Questionnaire, for heroic and non-heroic risk takers. All of the\nscenarios were high risk, with the actor described as moderately skilled or knowledgeable\nabout the required action. Although the adjectives were originally presented in a quasi-\nrandom sequence (starting with \"intelligent\"), in Table 1 they are grouped with\nconceptually similar items. Columns 2 and 3 show the mean ratings for heroic and non-\nheroic risk takers on the seven-point +3 to -3 rating scale. Positive numbers indicate that\nthe risk taker was rated as \"more ___ than\" (e.g. more brave than) the risk avoider, while\nnegative numbers indicate that the risk taker was \"less ____ than\" (e.g. less emotionally\nstable than) the risk avoider.\nParticipants judged risk takers to be significantly different (all p < .001) from risk\navoiders for most of the person adjectives, for both heroic and non-heroic risks. Risk takers\nwere judged to be significantly more brave, athletic, and physically fit than risk avoiders, as\npredicted. Risk takers were also judged superior on some other desirable traits, including\nambitious, self confident, fun to be with, and open to new experiences. However, for both\nheroic and non-heroic risky acts, risk takers were judged to have higher levels of several\nundesirable traits, including impulsive, attention-seeking, and foolish, while they were\njudged as less self controlled and intelligent compared to risk avoiders. The fact that risk-\ntakers were rated as less intelligent than risk avoiders suggests that participants perceived\nhigh-level risk taking as reflecting poor judgment by the actors (i.e., the potential mates).\nThe fourth column in Table 1 shows the differences in mean ratings for heroic\nminus non-heroic risk takers. Most noteworthy is the finding that heroic risk takers were\nrated significantly more positively (compared to risk avoiders) than non-heroic risk takers\nfor three pro-social adjectives: agreeable, conscientious, and altruistic. Heroic risk takers\nalso had higher ratings for brave and sexy, compared to non-heroic risk takers. On the other\nhand, heroic risk takers were rated significantly less badly than non-heroic risk takers for\nseveral adjectives, including attention seeking, emotionally stable, self-controlled, and\nNeither daredevils nor wimps\nTable 1.

In column 4, * indicates p < .001 for the difference\nbetween means for heroic versus non-heroic risk scenarios (t-tests, two-tailed).\nStudy 2: High- vs. Medium-Skilled Risk Takers\nStudy 1 showed that, for non-heroic physically risky activities, women preferred\nrisk takers over risk avoiders as long-term mates for moderately risky activities, but not for\nhigh-risk activities, where they preferred risk avoiders as mates. Across the eight non-\nheroic risk scenarios, perceived riskiness was negatively correlated with the degree of\npreference for risk-takers over risk-avoiders as mates.\nThe actual physical riskiness of an activity to an individual would depend not only\non the inherent riskiness of the act itself, in its particular context, but also on the\nNeither daredevils nor wimps\nindividual's level of skill for the required action. For example, skiing down a steep and\nnarrow trail would be more risky than skiing down a relatively wide and moderately-sloped\nbeginner trail, but skiing either trail would be less risky for an expert skier than for an\nintermediate-level skier. Study 2 manipulated 2 act riskiness levels X 2 actor skill levels. It\nwas predicted that, for non-heroic risks, participants would prefer risk takers as mates in the\nlowest risk condition (medium-risk act, high-skill actor), but they would prefer risk-\navoiders as mates for the highest-risk combination (high-risk act, medium-skill actor), with\npreferences for risk takers being intermediate for the two medium-riskiness conditions.\nA secondary purpose of Study 2 was to determine whether participants' attitudes\ntoward personal physical risk taking were affected by the same variables, in the same way,\nas their attitudes toward risk takers as mates. Farthing (2005) found a positive correlation\nbetween reported likelihood of self risk taking and preferences for high-level risk takers as\nmates, suggesting assortative mate selection on the basis of attitudes toward risk taking. It\nwas predicted that within each of the 2 risk levels x 2 skill levels conditions there would be\na positive correlation, such that participants reporting greater likelihoods of self risk taking\nwould also report more favorable attitudes toward risk takers as mates.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants were different volunteers from the same subject pool, under the same\nconditions as in Study 1. Usable data were obtained for 63 females and 55 males, mean age\nParticipants answered two questionnaires, Attitudes toward Risk Takers\nQuestionnaire and Attitudes toward Personal Risk Taking Questionnaire, with about half of\nthe participants taking each questionnaire first. The procedure for the Attitudes toward Risk\nTakers questionnaire was the same as in Study 1. (Study 2 was actually conducted before\nStudy 1.) Participants read brief scenarios where a person had to decide whether to engage\nin a specified risky act. They then rated the relative attractiveness of a risk-taker versus a\nrisk-avoider as a potential long-term mate, using a linear scale like that used in Study 1.\nQuestionnaires for males and females were worded appropriately, such that they were\njudging the attractiveness of risk takers of the opposite sex.\nParticipants judged 24 different risky scenarios, arranged in a quasi-random\nsequence. For half of the participants the sequence of the scenarios was the reverse order of\nthe sequence for the other participants. The scenarios included four different types of non-\nheroic physically risky acts, and two heroic risky acts. Each of the six act types was used\nfour times, with variations in the description suitable for a design of 2 risk levels X 2 skill\nlevels. Thus, for each risk type two of the scenarios involved acts that were explicitly\nlabeled as \"very risky,\" while the other two were described as \"somewhat risky,\" with\nappropriate variations of the details of the description. For each of these scenario pairs, in\none the actor was described as \"expert\" at the type of activity required whereas the actor\nwas described as \"moderately skilled\" or knowledgeable in the other scenario. The\nscenarios were similar to those used by Farthing (2005). The four non-heroic scenarios\nincluded Alpine (downhill) skiing, whitewater kayaking, speeding in a car, and self-defense\nfrom a mugger. The two heroic scenarios included rescuing a child from a river and\ndefending a child from a bully.\nNeither daredevils nor wimps\nThe Attitudes toward Personal Risk Taking Questionnaire employed the same 24\nscenarios. For each pair of high-risk and moderate risk scenarios, participants were asked to\nassume that they were \"expert\" at the required skill in one scenario, and \"moderately\nskilled\" in the other scenario.

For\nwomen, all points differed significantly from zero (p < .001), except for a marginal\ndifference in the high-risk, high-skill condition (p < .10).

Skill\nNeither daredevils nor wimps\nDiscussion\nThe main purpose of the present studies was a further test of a derivation from\ncostly-signaling theory, that women would be attracted to physical risk takers as long-term\nmates. Farthing (2005) found that women were attracted to heroic risk takers, but not to\nnon-heroic risk takers, for highly risky acts. In this study the riskiness of the actions was\nvaried, and it was predicted that women would prefer takers of non-heroic risks over risk\navoiders when the risk level was low to moderate, but not when the risk level was very\nhigh. It was also predicted that the degree of preference for risk takers as mates would be\nnegatively correlated with the degree of riskiness of the various acts, for both heroic and\nnon-heroic risky acts.\nPredictions about the effects of activity riskiness on women's preferences for risk\ntakers as mates were supported in both studies. In Study 1 (Figures 1 and 2) women\npreferred takers of non-heroic physical risks over risk avoiders as mates when activities\nwere described as \"somewhat risky,\" but the preference was reversed in favor of risk\navoiders when the acts were described as \"very risky.\" At both medium and high risk\nlevels, preferences for risk takers were greater for heroic risks than for non-heroic risks,\nconfirming Farthing's (2005) results. In addition, Study 1 found that women's degree of\npreference for risk takers over risk avoiders was inversely related to act riskiness, for both\nheroic and non-heroic risks. This latter finding is consistent with results reported by Wilke,\nHutchinson, Todd, and Kruger (2006), where for both women and men the reported\nattractiveness of risk-taking dating partners was negatively correlated with the perceived\nriskiness of activities in several domains (recreation, ethics, gambling, investment, health,\nand social domains).\nIn Study 2 (Figure 3), riskiness to actors taking non-heroic physical risks was\nmanipulated in a 2 x 2 design, with high or medium levels of inherent activity riskiness\ncrossed with high or medium levels of the individual's skill or knowledge about the\nrequired risky activity. Both variables significantly affected preferences for risk takers as\nmates, for both women and men. Preferences for risk takers were greater for medium than\nfor highly risky activities (as in Study 1), and preferences were greater for highly skilled\nactors than for moderately skilled actors. The effects of the two variables were\napproximately additive, such that risk takers were most strongly preferred over risk\navoiders in scenarios involving the least risky combination (medium-risk act, high-skill\nactor), and risk takers were less strongly but still significantly preferred for the moderately\nrisky combinations (medium-risk act with medium skill, high-risk act with high skill), but\nrisk avoiders were significantly preferred over risk takers in the riskiest condition (high risk\nact, medium skilled actor).\nThese results support Farthing's (2005) original prediction derived from costly-\nsignaling theory, that women would prefer takers of non-heroic, as well as heroic, physical\nrisks as mates over risk avoiders, provided that the risk level to the potential mate is low to\nmoderate, but not if the risk level is very high. In other words, for non-heroic acts, women\ndon't want wimps as mates, but they don't want daredevils, either.\nThe proposed interpretation of the results is that takers of low to moderate non-\nheroic physical risks may be successfully signaling desirable traits such as bravery and\nfitness, compared to risk avoiders. But daredevils who take high level risks are not\nNeither daredevils nor wimps\npreferred because positive attributes such as bravery and fitness are overshadowed by the\npossibility that they could be seriously injured or killed, thus reducing or eliminating their\nvalue as mates. For heroic risks, on the other hand, the altruistic component of the risky\nacts is such an important signal of mate quality that it can overcome worries about risks to\nthe mate's physical safety, such that heroic risk takers may be attractive as mates even\nwhen the risk level is very high.\nOf course, preferences for risk takers versus risk avoiders as mates are likely to be\naffected by other factors besides the riskiness and altruism of the activity. For example,\nStudy 2 found positive correlations indicating that participants who reported being more\nlikely to engage in physically-risky activities themselves (Figure 4) also had more\nfavorable attitudes toward risk takers as mates. This finding suggests positive assortment\nfor mate selection on the basis of attitudes toward risk taking. Evidence for such positive\nassortment was also found by Farthing (2005) and Wilke et al. (2006). Also, factors related\nto the personal or cultural meanings of different risky activities would be expected to affect\nattitudes toward risk takers as mates.\nZahavi, 1997) have argued that altruism may be a costly signal that affects mate selection.\nPeople who show generosity or willingness to take risks to protect or help other people are\nlikely to do the same thing for their own mate and children, thus making them more\nattractive as mates. In further support of the idea that heroism may be a costly signal that\ninfluences sexual selection, Griskevicius et al. (2007) found that men (but not women)\nreported being more likely to engage in risky, heroic acts when romantic or sexual motives\nwere induced, compared to a condition where such motives were not induced.\ncompetitive altruism hypothesis, which says that people may compete in shows of\ngenerosity when their generosity can increase their status among potential mates or\ncoalition partners who perceive their generous acts. Several studies have presented\nevidence in support of the idea that altruists--generous or helpful people--are more\nattractive as mates than non-altruists (e.g. Farrelly et al, 2007). The competitive altruism\nhypothesis implies that people who are perceived as more altruistic will be judged more\nattractive as mates than people who are perceived as less altruistic. But whereas taking\nhigher-level heroic risks is logically more altruistic than taking lower-level heroic risks, in\nthe present study takers of high-level heroic risks were actually preferred less than takers of\nlower-level heroic risks (Figure 1). Apparently, determinants of attitudes toward altruists\nwho do risky, heroic acts are not entirely the same as those for altruists who are generous\nwith their money or time and effort. Also, the actual performance of heroic versus\neconomic altruistic acts is affected by different variables for men and women (Griskevicius\nThe effects of riskiness and other variables on attitudes toward risk takers as mates\nmay be mediated by observer's inferences about various desirable and undesirable personal\ntraits of the actors. Study 1 (Table 1) assessed participants' judgments comparing risk\ntakers versus risk avoiders on eighteen different personal adjectives, for both heroic and\nnon-heroic high level risks with moderately-skilled actors. Since attitudes toward risk\ntakers as mates were much more favorable for heroic risk takers than for non-heroic risk\nNeither daredevils nor wimps\ntakers (Figure 1), we would expect to find judgments of the traits of heroic risk takers to be\nmore favorable than judgments of non-heroic risk takers, for at least some of the desirable\ntraits, and less negative for some of the negative traits. This was indeed the case. Most\nnoteworthy, heroic risk takers were judged more positively than non-heroic risk takers for\nthree pro-social traits: altruistic, conscientious, and agreeable. Also, there were some traits\nwhere both heroic and non-heroic risk takers were judged less favorably than risk avoiders,\nbut the ratings were less unfavorable for heroic than for non-heroic risk takers, including\nattention-seeking, emotionally-stable, self-controlled, and intelligent.\nNot surprisingly, both heroic and non-heroic risk takers were judged more brave,\nathletic and physically fit than risk avoiders. These positive traits had been posited as costly\nsignals that would make risk-takers attractive as mates. But risk takers were also judged to\nbe more impulsive and foolish, traits that would make them less attractive as mates, at least\nfor high-level risks. This study only measured trait judgments for takers of high-level risks;\nfuture research should compare trait judgments for high-, medium- and low-level risk\ntakers.\nThe present investigation of subject's judgments of the personal traits of risk takers\nwas primarily exploratory in nature. It indicated some of the personal traits that may be\nmost useful for understanding attitudes toward risk takers under various conditions. It\nshowed differences in trait judgments for heroic versus non-heroic risk takers. In future\nresearch it would be worthwhile to examine and compare trait judgments for performers of\ndifferent specific acts that are equally risky but which differ on other dimensions. For\nexample, risky acts might differ in familiarity, legality, and riskiness to self versus others.\nAlso, it would be worthwhile to examine and compare trait judgments for risk takers in the\nfive different evolutionarily valid domains of risk taking that have been proposed by\nmen and women's attitudes toward risk takers as mates were similar. But Farthing (2005)\nfound that men had more favorable attitudes toward same-sex risk takers as friends than\nwomen did. Thus, it would be worthwhile to compare male and female trait judgments of\nrisk takers as same-sex or opposite-sex friends, as well as as short-term or long-term mates,\nto learn more about possible mediators of attitudes toward risk takers for various types of\nrisks.\nNeither daredevils nor wimps\nReferences\nArnett, J.
