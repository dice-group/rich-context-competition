    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study examined individual difference correlates of belief in a narrative about the discovery of giant skeletal remains that\ncontravenes mainstream scientific explanations. A total of 364 participants from Central Europe completed a survey that\nasked them to rate their agreement with a short excerpt describing the giant skeleton myth. Participants also completed\nmeasures of the Big Five personality factors, New Age orientation, anti-scientific attitudes, superstitious beliefs, and religiosity.\nResults showed that women, as compared with men, and respondents with lower educational qualifications were significantly\nmore likely to believe in the giant skeleton myth, although effect sizes were small. Correlational analysis showed that\nstronger belief in the giant skeleton myth was significantly associated with greater anti-scientific attitudes, stronger New Age\norientation, greater religiosity, stronger superstitious beliefs, lower Openness to Experience scores, and higher Neuroticism\nscores. However, a multiple regression showed that the only significant predictors of belief in myth were Openness, New\nAge orientation, and anti-scientific attitudes. These results are discussed in relation to the potential negative consequences\nof belief in myths.\n",

Common science-related\nmyths include the misconception that human beings only use\n10% of their brains and that the Great Wall of China is the\nonly human-made object visible from the moon (Swami,\nStieger, Pietschnig, Nader, & Voracek, 2012). Such myths\nhave sometimes been referred to as \"na\u00efve science,\" because\nit is thought that individuals acquire such beliefs in a primi-\ntive, trial-and-error fashion (Pine, Messer, & St. John, 2001)\nand because they carry some significance that motivates their\npreservation and propagation (Brunvand, 2002).\nUnderstanding science-related myths remains an impor-\ntant task for a number of reasons. First, it is known that, once\na myth is accepted, new information is frequently distorted\nor ignored (Dole, 2000), and the incorrect belief is strength-\nened and becomes difficult to dislodge (Vosniadu, 2001). In\naddition, acceptance of science-related myths has a detri-\nmental effect on scientific literacy, which in turn may have a\nnegative impact on academic achievement, economic pro-\nductivity, and participation in civic affairs (Hazen & Trefl,\n2009). In some cases, myths--including myths derived from\nwithin social science (Ferguson, 2013)--may also be at the\ncenter of moral panics and unnecessary fears in society\n(Radford, 1999) or result in harmful or wasteful effects (e.g.,\nseeking out ineffective medical or psychological treatments;\nLilienfeld, Lynn, Ruscio, & Beyerstein, 2010). Conversely,\nbetter understanding of myths as well as attitudes toward sci-\nence may help practitioners promote acquisition of more\naccurate knowledge (Sturgis & Allum, 2004).\nTo date, however, much of the literature on science-\nrelated myths has focused on belief in myths of psychology,\nor what Lilienfeld etal. (2010) termed \"psychomythology.\"\nThus, studies have reported that members of the general pub-\nlic have difficulty distinguishing between factual and fic-\ntional claims about human behavior (e.g., Bensley, Lilienfeld,\nHouzel, 2002). Related work has indicated that even students\n1Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK\n2HELP University College, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n3University of Vienna, Austria\n4University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany\nCorresponding Author:\nViren Swami, Department of Psychology, Anglia Ruskin University, East\nRoad, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire CB1 1PT, UK.\nEmail: viren.swami@anglia.ac.uk\nWho Believes in the Giant Skeleton Myth?\nAn Examination of Individual Difference\nCorrelates\nViren Swami1,2, Ulrich S.

More specifically, the authors\ndeveloped the 20-item Belief in Science-Related Myths\nScale (BiSMyS) consisting of popular science-related narra-\ntives, which they reported could be reduced to two moder-\nately correlated factors (r = .46) concerning human-related\n(e.g., \"The average woman swallows six pounds of lipstick\nduring her lifetime\") and non-human-related myths (e.g.,\n\"Storing batteries in a refrigerator or freezer will improve\ntheir performance\"). In addition, Swami and colleagues\n(2012) reported that human-related, but not non-human-\nrelated myths, were significantly associated with anti-scien-\ntific attitudes, New Age orientation, and the Big Five\npersonality factor of Extraversion.\nAlthough the BiSMyS is a useful addition to the armory\nof researchers wishing to examine belief in science-related\nmyths, an alternative method of approaching the same topic\nis to focus on belief in specific myths. For example, in 2004,\ndigitally altered photographs purporting to depict \"giant\nskeletons\" were paired with a fictitious narrative based on\nthe Islamic account of the people of Aad. In 2007, the hoax\nwas repeated and widely disseminated through social net-\nworking sites and email forwards, with the locale changed\nfrom Saudi Arabia in the original to northern India in the new\nversion (Mikkelson & Mikkelson, 2010). Although a myth\n(the origin of accompanying photographs have been traced to\nan entry to create an archaeological hoax1), the narrative was\nwidely disseminated, including by reputable news agencies\nThe giant skeleton myth offers a useful means of examin-\ning belief in myths for two reasons. First, the fuller narrative\nof the myth and the use of accompanying imagery allow\nscholars to examine belief in the myth in a similar fashion to\nits original transmission. That is, by utilizing the myth as it\nwas originally transmitted, it should be possible to focus on\nbelief in a myth that retains most, if not all, of its transmis-\nby focusing on a specific myth, it is possible to examine indi-\nvidual difference correlates of belief in the myth specifically,\nrather than science-related myths in general.\nIn this study, then, we focused on belief in a giant skeleton\nmyth that was presented to participants in a similar manner\nto its original transmission. Specifically, participants were\npresented with information about the purported discovery of\nthe skeletal remains of a giant along with an accompanying\n(doctored) image, and were asked to rate their belief in the\nclaim. In addition, we examined associations between belief\nin this particular myth and measures of the Big Five person-\nality factors, anti-scientific attitudes, and New Age orienta-\ntion. Based on previous work (Swami et\nexpected that belief in the giant skeleton myth would be\npositively associated with anti-scientific attitudes, New Age\norientation, and possibly the Big Five traits of Openness to\nExperience and Extraversion. In addition, participants also\ncompleted a measure of superstitious belief and, given the\nmyth's religious connotations, a measure of religiosity.\nMethod\nParticipants\nGerman = 17.1%, other = 2.2%). Participants ranged in age\nity of participants were of European Caucasian descent\nmarried, 2.8% were divorced or separated, 2.2% were wid-\nowed, and 1.7% were of some other marital status. In terms\nof educational qualifications, 4.5% had completed minimum\ncompulsory schooling, 68.4% had completed secondary edu-\ncation, 7.1% had an undergraduate degree, and 19.5% had a\npostgraduate degree.\nMeasures\nBelief in the giant skeleton myth. Participants were presented\nwith an excerpt that purportedly reported on the discovery of\nthe skeletal remains of a giant skeleton (see the appendix).\nThe excerpt was adapted from a blog entry that was circu-\nlated via email (and attributed to an April 2004 Times of\nIndia article), with the locale set in northern India (for details,\nsee www.snopes.com/photos/odd/giantman.asp). Accompa-\nnying the excerpt was an image purportedly depicting the\nremains of a giant, which had been circulated along with the\noriginal email. Once participants had read the excerpt and\nviewed the image, they were asked to rate their agreement\nwith four statements, namely \"This article presents good evi-\ndence for the existence of giants,\" \"I am convinced that\ngiants once existed on Earth,\" \"I believe this article is a\nhoax,\" and \"The arguments of this article are convincing.\"\nEach of these items were rated on a 6-point Likert-type scale\n(1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree) and the third item\nwas reverse-coded prior to analyses for consistency. The fac-\ntor structure of this measure is evaluated in the \"Results\"\nsection.\nBig Five personality dimensions.Participants completed the\nNEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI; Costa & McCrae,\nwhich assesses each of the dimensions of Neuroticism, Extra-\nversion, Openness to Experience,Agreeableness, and Consci-\nentiousness with 12 items each (sample item, \"I often feel\ntense and jittery\"). These dimensions reflect an individual's\nSwami et al. 3\npersonality at the broadest level (i.e., through the inclusion of\na maximum spectrum of different traits) and with efficiency\n(i.e., with a minimum set of dimensions).All items were rated\non a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 =\nstrongly agree) and dimension scores were computed as the\nmean of items associated with each subscale. The parent\nNEO-FFI and its translations have been shown to have very\ngood patterns of reliability and validity (Costa & McCrae,\n1989). In the present study, Cronbach's  for the subscales\nAgreeableness, .75; and Conscientiousness, .85.\nAnti-scientific attitudes.To measure anti-scientific attitudes,\nwe used the Anti-Scientific subscale of the New Age Beliefs\nScale (Yates & Chandler, 2000; German translation: Swami\netal., 2012; sample item: \"The primary purpose of scientific\nlanguage is to confuse the average person\"). This is an 8-item\nmeasure of negative attitudes toward contemporary science,\nin which items are rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale (-3 =\ntotally unbelievable, +3 = totally believable). For the present\npurposes, scores were recomputed prior to analysis (1 =\ntotally unbelievable, 7 = totally believable) and an overall\nscore was computed as the mean of all items (higher scores\nreflect greater anti-scientific attitudes). Previous work has\nreported that this subscale has a one-dimensional factor\nstructure with good internal consistency (Yates & Chandler,\n2000). Cronbach's  for this scale in the present study was\nNew Age orientation. Participants completed the 22-item New\nAge Orientation Scale (NAOS; Granqvist & Hagekull, 2001;\nGerman translation: Swami etal., 2012; sample item: \"The\nposition of the stars at birth affects how one will live one's\nlife or how one's personality will develop\"). This scale mea-\nsures individual differences in broad and specific systems of\nthought, beliefs, interests, and activities that can be described\nas New Age. Items were rated on a 6-point Likert-type scale\n(1 =strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree) and an overall\nNewAge orientation score was computed by taking the mean\nof all items (higher scores reflect greater New Age orienta-\ntion). The NAOS has been shown to have good patterns of\nvalidity and reliability. In the present study, the scale's inter-\nnal consistency was .94.\nSuperstitious beliefs.Superstitious beliefs were measured\nusing the six-item Lucky Charms Scale developed by Wise-\nsample item: \"Have you avoided walking under a ladder\nbecause it is associated with bad luck?\"). The scale measures\nagreement with both negative (e.g., walking under a ladder)\nand positive (e.g., touching wood) superstitions (1 = totally\ndisagree, 6 = totally agree). Although it is possible to calcu-\nlate separate scores for positive and negative superstitious\nbeliefs, Voracek (2009) showed that the German version of\nthis scale was best considered as one dimensional. Therefore,\nan overall score was computed as the mean of all six items,\nwith higher scores reflecting stronger superstitious beliefs.\nCronbach's  for this scale in the present study was .85,\nwhich is similar to that reported for previous uses of the Ger-\nman translation of the scale (Swami etal., 2011; Voracek,\nReligiosity.Participants' religiosity was measured using a\nsingle-item measure of intrinsic religiosity (1 = not at all\nreligious, 7 = very religious). Although the use of a single\nitem is limited in terms of breadth, single-item measures of\nreligiosity have been shown to have good reliability and\nvalidity among community samples (e.g., Abdel-Khalek,\nDemographics.\nParticipants provided their demographic\ndetails consisting of sex, age, nationality, ethnicity, marital\nstatus, and highest educational qualification.\nProcedure\nAll participants were recruited opportunistically; that is,\neight researchers directly recruited participants from among\ntheir personal contacts. Participants were given brief infor-\nmation about the project, provided informed consent, and\ncompleted an anonymous paper-and-pencil version survey.\nOrder of appearance of the scales was fixed (belief in the\ngiant skeleton myth, NEO-FFI, NAOS, Anti-Scientific sub-\nscale, Lucky Charms Scale, demographics, religiosity). All\nparticipants took part on a voluntary basis and were not\nremunerated for participation.\nResults\nGiant Skeleton Myth\nTo examine the factor structure of the four-item measure of\nbelief in the giant skeleton myth, we computed a principal-\naxis exploratory factor analysis using quartimax rotation,\nbecause of the expectation of the emergence of a general fac-\ntor (Pedhazur & Schmelkin, 1991). Bartlett's test of spheric-\n(KMO) measure of sampling adequacy, KMO = .86, showed\nthat the items of this scale had adequate common variance\nfor factor analysis. Both, the EGV1 criterion (eigenvalues\nwith a value > 1.0) and examination of the scree-plot, sug-\ngested the extraction of a single factor, which accounted for\nthis factor with loadings in the range of .74 to .84. Based on\nthese results, we computed an overall score of belief in the\ngiant skeleton myth as the mean of all four items, with higher\nscores indicating greater belief that the article was truthful.\nCronbach's  for this measure was .79.\nStronger agreement with the giant skeleton myth was\n4 SAGE Open\n(M = 2.04, SD = 1.06). An independent t test showed that the\ndifference between women and men was significant, t(362) =\nshowed that whereas there were no significant between-\ngroup differences as a function of nationality, F(2, 360) =\np\n2 < .01, there were some small between-\ngroup differences as a function of education, F(3, 360) =\np\n2 = .03. Participants who had completed\nagreed more strongly with the giant skeleton myth than par-\nticipants with upper secondary education (M = 2.21, SD =\nHonest Significant Difference post hoc tests, ps < .05; par-\nInter-Scale Correlations and Multiple Regression\nDescriptive statistics (M and SD) and inter-scale correlations\nfor all variables included in the study are reported in Table 1.\nAs can be seen, stronger belief in the giant skeleton myth\nwas significantly associated with greater anti-scientific atti-\ntudes, stronger New Age orientation, greater religiosity,\nstronger superstitious beliefs, lower Openness to Experience\nscores, and higher Neuroticism scores. We next conducted a\nmultiple linear regression with belief in the giant skeleton\nmyth as the criterion variable and the Big Five traits, anti-\nscientific attitudes, New Age orientation, superstitious\nbeliefs, and religiosity as predictors. Results showed that the\nadj. R2 = .20. Multicollinearity was not a limiting factor in\nthis regression (all variance inflation factors <2.36).\nRegression coefficients are reported in Table 2 and, as can be\nseen, the only significant predictors of belief in the giant\nskeleton myth were Openness to Experience, New Age ori-\nentation, and anti-scientific attitudes.\nDiscussion\nOur results showed, first, a significant and negative relation-\nship between belief in the giant skeleton myth and Openness\nto Experience. It is likely that this association is based on the\nfact that Openness correlates with intelligence and intellec-\ntual curiosity. For example, studies have indicated that\nOpenness is moderately correlated with crystallized and\nfluid intelligence (e.g., Moutafi, Furnham, & Crump, 2006).\nImproved cognitive abilities, in turn, may mean that indi-\nviduals are more intellectually suspicious, particularly when\npresented with information that is diffuse and of unknown\nTable 1.

The Unstandardized and Standardized Regression Coefficients for the Variables Entered Into the Regression Model.\nVariable B SE  t p\nSwami et al. 5\nveracity. Consistent with this perspective, it has also been\nshown that Openness is positively associated with need for\ncognition (Fleischhauer etal., 2010), that is, a personality\nconstruct referring to an individual's tendency to scrutinize\ninformation and to think deeply about ideas and concepts.\nMore broadly, this perspective may also help to explain why\nindividuals with lower educational qualifications more\nstrongly endorsed the giant skeleton myth than those with\nhigher qualifications, although it should be noted that the\neffect size of this difference was small.\nOur results also showed that greater belief in the giant\nskeleton myth was associated with stronger New Age orien-\ntation. It has been suggested that New Age beliefs may rep-\nresent a secularized religion that incorporates a blend of\ningredients (Granqvist & Hagekull, 2001; Houtman &\nAupers, 2007), including systems of thought (e.g., astrology,\nEastern philosophies) and specific beliefs (e.g., in parapsy-\nchological phenomena). Indeed, two particularly notable\naspects of New Age orientation are its religious syncretism\nand epistemological subjectivism (Hanegraaff, 2002). These\ncharacteristics may make the myth of the giant skeleton a\nparticularly appealing one to individuals with a strong New\nAge orientation. In addition, the New Age approach to truth\nis often opposed to the analytic methods of science (Flere &\nKirbis, 2009), which may enhance belief in the giant skele-\nton myth either directly or through the association between\nNew Age orientation and anti-scientific attitudes (in our\nThis suggestion links with our third key finding, namely,\nthe relationship between belief in the giant skeleton myth\nand anti-scientific attitudes. The latter refers to an aversion to\nthe analytic methods of mainstream science, particularly\nrules of evidence generation and evaluation (Yates &\nChandler, 2000). This may make individuals who are hold-\ning stronger anti-scientific attitudes less willing or able to\ncritically evaluate claims of a dubious nature, such as the\ngiant skeleton narrative. Although anti-scientific attitudes\nwas the weakest of our significant predictors in our regres-\nsion, this relationship is consistent with the earlier finding\nthat anti-scientific attitudes are correlated with belief in sci-\nence-related myths (Swami etal., 2012). More broadly, it\nmight be suggested that holding anti-scientific attitudes\nmakes the assimilation of anomalous beliefs, such as the\ngiant skeleton myth, more likely.\nA number of additional findings of the present work are\nworthy of mention. First, we found that religiosity emerged\nas a significant correlate of belief in the giant skeleton myth\n(indeed, it was one of the stronger correlates), but did not\nemerge as a significant predictor in our multiple regression.\nIf New Age beliefs do indeed represent a secularized religion\n(Granqvist & Hagekull, 2001), then it is likely that there is a\ngood deal of shared variance accounted for by New Age ori-\nentation and religiosity. Likewise, there is likely a good deal\nof overlap between New Age beliefs and superstitious\nbeliefs, which may explain why the latter emerged as a\nsignificant correlate of belief in the giant skeleton myth but\nnot as a significant predictor.\nIn addition, our results suggest that belief in the giant\nskeleton myth may have a number of unique personality pre-\ndictors compared with belief in science-related myths more\nbroadly. Specifically, science-related myths appear to be\nassociatedwiththeBigFivepersonalityfactorofExtraversion\n(Swami etal., 2012). However, Extraversion did not emerge\nas a significant correlate of belief in the giant skeleton myth,\npossibly suggesting a distinction between meta-theoretical\nbeliefs about science-related myths and specific myths. We\nalso found that women were significantly more likely to\nbelieve in the giant skeleton myth than men. This finding\nstands in contrast to the lack of gender differences in belief\nin science-related myths (Swami etal., 2012), although it\nshould be noted that the effect size of the difference in the\npresent study was small.\nThere are a number of ways in which the design of the\npresent study could be improved upon. First, our sampling\nmethod may have introduced an inherent bias and our find-\nings should only be generalized to the wider population with\ncaution; utilizing a more representative sample would offer\none means of improving on the present work. Second,\nwhereas we have focused on individual difference correlates\nof belief in a specific myth, future research may wish to\nincorporate a different theoretical perspective, such as the\ndual-process persuasive model (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993;\nPetty & Cacioppo, 1996). Such a perspective may be particu-\nlarly useful in understanding the assimilation of myths, inso-\nfar as it focuses attention on variables associated with the\nsource and message, which the present study did not\nmanipulate.\nThe findings of the present study suggest that there are a\nnumber of individual difference correlates of belief in a spe-\ncific myth that contravenes conventional scientific explana-\ntion. Although our study was limited to a specific myth, it\nshould be noted that most such myths have a specific format\nand are typically in continuous circulation (Sacco, 2005),\nthus allowing for some generalization of findings. Moreover,\nsuch myths can sometimes emerge from within social sci-\nence itself (Ferguson, 2013). If our research can be corrobo-\nrated (e.g., with a further set of myths or using a naturalistic\ndesign), our findings will prove useful for policy makers\nseeking to inoculate individuals from erroneous narratives,\nwhich may bring a raft of negative consequences with them\nAppendix\nThe Excerpt of the Giant Skeleton Myth\nPresented to Participants\nRecent exploration activity in the northern region of India has\nuncovered the skeletal remains of a human of phenomenal\n6 SAGE Open\nsize. This region of the Indian desert is called the Empty\nQuarter. The discovery was made by the Indian Division of\nthe National Geographic Team, with support from the Indian\nArmy as the area comes under the jurisdiction of the Army.\nThe exploration team also found tablets that suggest the giant\nbelonged to a race of superhumans that are mentioned in the\nMahabharata, a Hindu epic poem from about 200 BC.
