Most notably, they have to respond to different political environ-\nments that in different locations may give rise to varying political risks. Political risk\nencompasses not only `sovereign risk', the risk that the sovereign will interfere with a firm's\nability to pay its investors as promised, but also other forms of political, economic and\ncountry-specific risks that affect the profitability of an investment in a foreign country and\nthat would not be present if the country had more stable and developed business environ-\nment and legal institutions (Hill (1998) and Buckley (1992)). This risk ranges from outright\nexpropriation to more subtle forms like confiscatory taxation, corruption, or economic con-\nstraints such as exchange rate controls. MNE can try to insure against political risk, but\nthey can never do so fully.2\nIn this paper we investigate, both theoretically and empirically, the way MNE choose\ntheir capital structure in response to political risk. For this purpose, we distinguish different\ntypes of political risk. We find that it is important to identify the type that prevails in a\nparticular country, because different types of risk affect the optimal financing decision in\ndifferent ways.\nWe focus on two choice variables that determine the capital structure - the level of\n1E-mail: iris.kesternich@lrz.uni-muenchen.de, schnitzer@lrz.uni-muenchen.de.

Second, many investors are unaware of the existence\nof political risk insurance and even those who are aware of its existence often do not have such\ninsurance (www.political-risk.net).\nleverage and the ownership structure of the foreign affiliate. Choosing higher leverage\nreduces tax payments but increases the risk of bankruptcy, involving some bankruptcy cost.\nThe investor balances optimally these costs and benefits of debt financing. Furthermore,\nhe chooses how much of the affiliate to sell to outside investors, taking into account how\nthe ownership structure affects the agency costs and the value of the affiliate.\nWe distinguish three prototypes of political risk throughout the paper.3 In Scenario I,\npolitical risk takes the form of outright expropriation or nationalization, where the investor\nloses all assets and can no longer service his credits. In the past, this type of political\nrisk used to be very important (Kobrin (1980), Andersson (1991)). Though in general it\nseems to be less prevalent nowadays there are very recent examples indicating its latent\nrelevance.4\nScenario II captures political risk as a form of creeping expropriation that lowers the\nexpected returns of the project. Examples could be lack of protection for intellectual\nproperty rights or unreliable contract enforcement, but could also be economic constraints\nlike currency or exchange rate controls, or particular regulatory requirements directed at\nforeign multinationals. Political violence that negatively affects market conditions and\nhence expected revenues would be another example.\nIn Scenario III, we capture political risk that directly affects the profits of the invest-\nment, i.e., after servicing potential debt payments. This type of political risk arises if the\nhost country imposes discriminatory and confiscatory taxation, asks for bribes or blocks\nthe repatriation of funds from the host country to the home country.\nOur analysis shows that these different forms of political risk affect equity holders and\ndebt holders in different ways and can therefore result in the multinational choosing dif-\nferent capital structures. We find that the optimal debt level decreases with increasing\npolitical risk in both Scenarios I and II because (creeping) expropriation increases the risk\nof bankruptcy, which calls for smaller leverage. But the optimal debt level increases with\npolitical risk in Scenario III because the negative effects of discriminatory or confiscatory\n4Recent examples where expropriations have taken place are Zimbabwe and Venezuela. In\n2007, a law was adopted in Zimbabwe that forces foreign investors to find a majority Zimbabwean\nshareholder within five to ten years (compare for example dpa and netzeitung.de (27/09/2007)\npany, and Sidor, Venezuela's biggest producer of steel, were expropriated by the Venezuelan govern-\nment without paying appropriate compensation (compare for example AP (01/05/2008), Romero\ntaxation can be contained with higher leverage. Furthermore, we find that, in all three sce-\nnarios, the optimal ownership share tends to decrease as the level of political risk increases\nbecause political risk reduces the investor's expected returns from the foreign affiliate, but\ndoes not reduce the managerial cost of running the firm. Interestingly, though, due to the\ninteraction with the optimal debt choice, the ownership share reduction is less pronounced\nin case of confiscatory taxation, where the debt level increases, as compared to the case of\n(creeping) expropriation, where the debt level is reduced as a response to political risk.\nIn our empirical analysis, we use the Microdatabase Direct Investment (MiDi) of the\nDeutsche Bundesbank to investigate the impact of political risk on both the choice of own-\nership shares and the leverage of foreign affiliates of German multinationals. The dataset\ncontains balance sheet information on the foreign affiliates. German parent companies are\nrequired by law to report this information when the balance sheet total of the affiliate and\nthe ownership share are larger than a certain threshold. As a measure for political risk, we\nuse the time-varying, country-specific index that is provided by the International Country\nRisk Guide (ICRG) and that is composed of 12 weighted variables covering both political\nand social attributes.\nWe estimate the impact of political risk on our two choice variables, ownership share\nand leverage. We start by looking at the linear effects of political risk. Our ownership\nregression indicates that MNEs hold a smaller share of the equity of the foreign affiliate\nwhen political risk is high, confirming our theoretical predictions. Regarding the leverage\nchoice, we find that affiliates of MNE use a higher level of debt in countries with a higher\nlevel of political risk. This would suggest the prevalence of the less invasive Scenario III\ntype of political risk.\nWe then attempt to capture the theoretical insight that the effects of political risk\nmay differ for different scenarios of political risk. For this purpose we follow two different\nstrategies. One strategy is to employ various empirical measures, reflecting different types\nof political risk, and to identify them with different scenarios. Following this strategy of\nusing different measures we can confirm that the ownership share decreases in political risk\nno matter what type of measure we introduce, while leverage can either increase or decrease\nin response to different types of risk. The second strategy is to rank the scenarios according\nto their severity and to introduce a quadratic function of political risk which allows the\nmarginal effects of political risk to vary with the severity of political risk. Following this\napproach, we find that indeed leverage first increases and then decreases in political risk.\nFor ownership, it is comparatively more likely that the ownership share decreases with\npolitical risk.\nOur paper is related to two strands of literature, the literature on political risk and the\nliterature on the capital structure choice.\nThe first strand studies the effects of political risk on foreign direct investment. The\nearly theoretical papers were primarily concerned with the question of how foreign direct\ninvestment can be sustained if there is a risk of nationalization. The seminal paper in this\nliterature is Eaton and Gersovitz (1983), which shows under what circumstances reputation\ncan sustain foreign direct investment. Other papers study how political risk affects the\nmultinational's investment strategy. This may induce the investor to choose an inefficient\ntechnology (Eaton (1995)), inefficient investment paths (Thomas and Worrall (1994), and\nSchnitzer (1999)) or excess capacity (Janeba (2000)). More recent papers have investigated\nthe sale of shares to locals as a possible way of mitigating the risk of confiscatory taxation\nor creeping expropriation (Konrad and Lommerud (2001), Mueller and Schnitzer (2006)).\nHowever, none of these authors have allowed for different forms of political risk that impact\non the investor's decisions in different ways. Empirical studies have focussed on the question\nof how country characteristics affect the ownership structure in foreign direct investment\nThe second strand of literature has so far mainly focused on taxes as the driving force\nbehind the capital structure choice. It has been shown both empirically and theoretically\nthat tax incentives lead to national differences in the level of leverage of affiliates of MNE\n(see for example Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004), Huizinga, Laeven, and Nicodeme (2006),\nBuettner, Overesch, Schreiber, and Wamser (2006) and Mintz and Weichenrieder (2005)).\nHowever, there is much less evidence on how differing levels of political risk may affect the\ncapital structure of affiliates that are located in different countries. For US-data, Desai,\nFoley and Hines (2004) find that political risk increases affiliate leverage. Aggarwal and\nKyaw (2004) also use US data, but on a more aggregated level. In contrast to Desai, Foley\nand Hines, they find that political risk reduces affiliate leverage. Novaes and Werlang (2005)\nstudy foreign affiliates in Brazil and find that they are more highly leveraged than their\nBrazilian counterparts and that the difference increases with Brazil's political risk. This\nconflicting evidence suggests that the relationship between political risk and leverage is not\nstraightforward and hence needs more examination.\nThe contribution of our paper is twofold. Firstly, it provides a theoretical framework\nthat explicitly models the choice of the capital structure in response to political risk. It is\nalso the first paper to distinguish in a theoretical framework different kinds of political risk.\nSecondly, our paper contributes to the empirical literature on political risk by investigating\nthe impact of political risk on both leverage and ownership choices, and by distinguishing\nthe impact of different types and magnitudes of political risk. As our theoretical analysis\nsuggests, the coefficient measuring the impact of political risk on leverage may indeed\nchange signs, depending on the type of political risk. We find this possibility of different\ncoefficients confirmed in our empirical analysis.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our theoretical\nmodel and analyzes the optimal financial structure in the baseline model. Section 3 intro-\nduces different types of political risk and investigates the optimal financial structure in the\npresence of political risk. In section 4, we derive empirical predictions. Section 5 introduces\nthe data set. In Section 6 we present our empirical results. Section 7 concludes.\n2 The base line model\nConsider a multinational investor who intends to invest a fixed amount I in a foreign\nlocation. The project generates a stochastic return R, with R being uniformly distributed\non the interval [0, \u00af\nR]. The investment can be financed with either debt, D, or equity, E, or\na combination of the two, such that E + D = I.\nThe investor has to take two decisions, he has to choose (i) how much debt finance D\nto use as opposed to equity finance and (ii) what share  of the affiliate to keep for himself,\ni.e., what share (1 - ) of the affiliate to sell to outside investors. In the corporate finance\nliterature, these decisions have always been studied separately. Thus, to jointly investigate\nboth decisions, we set up a model that draws on both strands of the corporate finance\nliterature, the one on the debt versus equity decision and the one on the optimal ownership\nshare.\nLeverage choice\nTo model the debt versus equity choice, we consider the well established tradeoff that debt\nfinancing allows to save on tax payments but increases the probability of bankruptcy, giving\nrise to potential dead weight losses.5 To capture this tradeoff, we assume that in case of debt\nfinancing D the investor's liability is restricted to the investment project. So if the investor\ntakes up debt D, he has to repay (1 + r)D, where r denotes the interest rate. He can do so\nonly when the project is sufficiently successful, i.e., generates returns R  (1 + r)D. The\nremaining profits, after interest payments have been deducted, are subject to local taxation,\nat interest rate t. If the returns are not sufficient to cover the repayment, the project is\nliquidated and the investor has to give up all the returns to the bank. The affiliate's value\nV for a given level of D is thus\nV =\n\u00af\nR\n(1 - t)[R - (1 + r)D]\n\u00af\nR\ndR + D - I (1)\nBanks are assumed to operate in a competitive market and to be risk neutral. This\nmeans that, for any level of debt that the investor wants the bank to finance, the interest\nrate r is chosen such that the bank can expect to break even. We assume that in case\nof bankruptcy transaction costs are incurred during the bankruptcy procedure such that\nthe bank is able to seize only some share s of the returns that are generated, with s < 1.\nThis assumption is supposed to capture the dead weight loss that is associated with debt\nfinancing due to the risk of bankruptcy. The interest rate is implicitly defined by the bank's\nbreak even condition\n\u00af\nR\n\u00af\nR\ndR +\nsR\n\u00af\nR\ndR = D (2)\nwhere the first integral represents the expected interest payments and the second integral\nrepresents the expected payoff the bank realizes in case of bankruptcy.\nOwnership choice\nConsider now the ownership choice of the investor, i.e. what share (1 - ) of the foreign\naffiliate to sell to outside investors. If financial markets are competitive and perfect, i.e.\nwith no transaction costs and risk neutrality, then the assets will be valued by outside\ninvestors at their expected value. So the price the investor realizes for selling a share of\n5In the corporate finance literature, this tradeoff is often called the tradeoff between interest tax\nshields and the costs of financial distress. See, e.g., Brealey and Myers (1996), pp. 496ff. Seminal\n(1 - ) of the affiliate, P((1 - )V ), is equal to (1 - )V .6 We will discuss below how\nthings change if markets are not perfect, in particular if the exposure of outside investors\nto political risk differs from that of insiders.\nTo model the ownership decision, we draw again on the corporate finance literature.\nIn this literature, two potential effects are discussed why (and how) the ownership choice\nmay affect the firm's value. The convergence-of-interest hypothesis predicts that larger\nownership stakes are associated with higher firm values, because they allow for a better\nalignment of the incentives of owner and manager or inside and outside investors.7 The\nentrenchment hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that insiders who control a substantial\npart of the shares may indulge in non-value maximizing behavior at the cost of outside\ninvestors.8 Empirical studies on this issue suggest that the firm value as a function of\nthe insider's ownership share  follows an inverted u-shaped pattern. This evidence has\nbeen interpreted such that the convergence-of-interest effect dominates for low and the\nentrenchment effect for large values of .9\nFollowing the convergence-of-interest hypothesis we assume that the investor increases\nhis effort as  increases, at cost K(), with K () > 0 and K () > 0, as larger ownership\nstakes imply more effort to be spent on the firm. Following the entrenchment hypothesis,\nwe assume that the investor enjoys private benefits B() that increase in , i.e. B () > 0,\nbut at a decreasing rate, i.e. B () < 0. The combination of effort and entrenchment\neffects are reflected in the revenues of the affiliate that can be appropriated by the investors\nin the following way: \u00af\nR is an inverted u-shaped function of , with \u00af\n\u00af\nR () < 0 and \u00af\nR (^\nThe investor's payoff function from holding equity share , selling equity share (1 - )\nand experiencing private benefits and costs can thus be summarized as follows:\nU(D, ) = V (D, ) + P[(1 - )V (D, )] + B() - K() = V (D, ) + B() - K() (3)\nThe investor chooses both the optimal debt level D and the optimal ownership share  in\norder to maximize his payoff function.\n9See, e.g., Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny (1988), McConnell and Servaes (1990) and Short and\nThe optimal financial structure\nWe now turn to solving the base line model without political risk. For this, consider again\nthe investor's payoff function, which, using the specification of the firm value in equation\nU(D, ) = V (D, ) + B() - K() (4)\n=\n\u00af\nR()\n(1 - t)[R - (1 + r)D]\n\u00af\nR()\ndR + D - I + B() - K() (5)\n=\n\u00af\nR()\n\u00af\nR() +\n(1 + r)2D2 + D - I + B() - K()\nUsing equation (2) we can rewrite the payoff function in the following way (see Ap-\npendix)\nU(D, ) = (1 - t)\n\u00af\nR() -\nD +\nD - I + B() - K() . (6)\nThe investor's maximization problem is characterized by the following two first order\nconditions.\ndU\nd\nd \u00af\nR\nd\n-\nD\ndr\nd \u00af\nR\nd \u00af\nR\nd\ndU\ndD\n= -(1 - t)\ndr\ndD\nD +\nThe following result summarizes the solution to this maximization problem:\nResult 1 The investor's maximum payoff is\nU(D, ) =\n\u00af\nR()\n1 - s + st\n- I + B() - K() (9)\nwhere  is implicitly defined by\n1 - s + st\nd \u00af\nR\nd\nand D is given by\nD =\n\u00af\nR\nt\nProof: See Appendix\nThe following result summarizes the comparative statics with respect to the local tax-\nation rate t.\nResult 2 The optimal debt level D increases as the local tax rate t increases.\ndD\ndt\n=\n\u00af\nThe optimal ownership share  decreases as t increases, if \u00af\nR > 0 in the relevant parameter\nrange, i.e.\nd\ndt\n=\nd \u00af\nR\nd\nR\n+ B - K\nProof: See Appendix\nResult 2 shows the expected pattern for the optimal debt level: as the tax rate increases,\nthe debt level increases. It is also straightforward to show that dD\nds\n> 0, i.e. as the\ninefficiency of bankruptcy decreases, the optimal debt level increases. This captures the\nwell established tradeoff of debt versus equity financing. For the ownership share, we find\nthat  decreases if \u00af\nR > 0 in the relevant parameter range, which, as equation 10 shows, is\nthe case if B < K , i.e. unless the entrenchment benefits are particularly large.\n3 Political risk and the optimal financial structure\nConsider now that the investment project is subject to political risk in the foreign location.\nTo study how this affects the firm's financial structure, we distinguish different forms of\npolitical risk.\n(1) Expropriation\nThe first type of political risk we consider is expropriation or nationalization. This is the\nclassic form of political risk where a sovereign simply takes property without compensation\n(Buckley (1992), Hill (1998)). We capture this form of political risk by assuming that the\ninvestment is expropriated with some probability 1, i.e. the investors lose control and cash\nflow rights from the investment. This leads to the following modified firm value function.\n\u00af\nR\n(1 - t)[R - (1 + r)D]\n\u00af\nR\nCredits are serviced only if the investment is not expropriated. So the zero profit\ncondition for banks needs to be modified. This is captured by the following condition.\n\u00af\nR\n\u00af\nR\ndR +\nsR\n\u00af\nR\nOf course, if the investment is expropriated, the investor also loses his benefits from\npotential entrenchment, B(). His managerial effort cost of running the firm are incurred\nbefore the potential expropriation takes place and hence are not affected. Thus, the in-\nvestor's payoff function is now\n\u00af\nR\n\u00af\nR\nThis payoff function implicitly assumes that outside investors, no matter where they\nare located, are affected by the danger of expropriation in exactly the same way as the\nmultinational investor. Of course, there may be circumstances where they are better pro-\ntected against expropriation, e.g. because they are local investors and the government\ncompensates them for their losses. In this case their perceived value of the affiliate is not as\nnegatively affected as the multinational investor's perceived value. We will discuss below\nhow this affects our results.\n(2) Creeping Expropriation\nAnother form of political risk we consider is creeping expropriation or political violence that\nnegatively affects the expected returns of the investment project. Other examples would be\ncurrency or exchange rate restrictions, or a failure to enforce or respect the agreed property\nand contract rights (Buckley (1992), Hill (1998)). We capture this by assuming that the\ninvestor can capture only a share (1 - 2) of the returns R. This leads to the following\nmodified firm value function.\n\u00af\nR\n\u00af\nR\nThe expected returns of the investment project also affect the zero profit condition for\nbanks that needs to be modified in the following way.\n\u00af\nR\n\u00af\nR\ndR +\n\u00af\nR\nAs above, also creeping expropriation jeopardizes the investor's chances of enjoying benefits\nfrom entrenchment but leaves managerial effort cost unaffected. Thus, the investor's payoff\nfunction is now\n\u00af\nR\n\u00af\nR\nWe now investigate how political risk affects the optimal financial structure. The follow-\ning result describes how the investor chooses the optimal ownership share and the optimal\ndebt level in the presence of (creeping) expropriation.\nResult 3 The investor's maximum payoff in case of (creeping) expropriation is\nU\n(D\n, \n)\n\u00af\nR()\n1 - s + st\nwhere \nis implicitly defined by\n)\n1 - s + st\nd \u00af\nR\nd\nand D\nis given by\nD\n)\n\u00af\nR\nt\nProof: See Appendix\nWe now determine the comparative statics with respect to the political risk parameter 1/2\n.\nResult 4 Both the optimal debt level and the optimal ownership share decrease as (creep-\ning) expropriation increases\ndD\n= -\n\u00af\nR\nt\nd\n=\nd \u00af\nR\nd\n+ B\nR\n+ B - K\nProof: See Appendix\nInterestingly, we find that both types of political risk, expropriation and creeping ex-\npropriation, affect the financial structure and the investor's payoff in the same way. For\na given debt level, the risk of expropriation makes it less likely that interest payments are\nmade. This has to be compensated by a higher interest rate, which in turn increases the\nrisk of bankruptcy. As a consequence, the investor chooses a smaller debt level. In case of\ncreeping expropriation, overall revenues are smaller, increasing the likelihood of bankruptcy\nfor any given level of debt. This leads to the same reduction of the optimal debt level.\nWith the same debt level, the overall payoff of the investor is the same, for any given\nownership share. (Creeping) expropriation reduces the monetary and non-monetary payoff\nfrom the investment but does not change the managerial effort cost of running the firm.\nThus, the investor optimally lowers his ownership share. This effect would be even larger\nif outside investors were less exposed to political risk and hence would value the foreign\naffiliate more highly.10\nDesai, Foley, and Hines Jr. (2006), who find empirically that debt is higher in high\npolitical risk countries, have argued that credits taken by local creditors may not react\nas much to political risk because local creditors may be more restricted in their choice of\ninvestment opportunities. The empirical evidence does, however, suggest that local interest\nrates react positively to political risk (Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004), Aggarwal and Kyaw\n(3) (Confiscatory taxation)\nOur third scenario captures the type of political risk that directly affects the multinational's\nprofits. Examples would be the blocking of the repatriation of funds from the host country\nto the home country, or corruption and discriminatory and confiscatory taxation that treats\nforeign firms differently from domestic firms (Buckley (1992)). We model this as a form\nof profit tax, i.e., interest payments can be deducted and are not subject to taxation or\nbribes. This scenario is particularly relevant if credits are obtained locally and hence the\nlocal government has no interest in jeopardizing the repayment of local credits.\n10This effect will also be larger if the allocation of ownership rights can be used as a means of\ninfluencing the likelihood of nationalization. As Konrad and Lommerud (2001) and Schnitzer (2002)\nhave shown, it could be in the interest of the investor to share ownership with host country firms,\neven without compensation, if this makes the host country less prone to engage in expropriation or\nconfiscatory taxation.\nThe affiliate's value is thus given by\n\u00af\nR\n\u00af\nR\nThis type of political risk has no impact on the zero profit condition for banks, provided\nthat the government indeed exempts the interest payments from discriminatory taxation.\nThus the break even condition for the bank is the same as in the baseline model\n\u00af\nR\n\u00af\nR\ndR +\nsR\n\u00af\nR\nAs this type of political risk applies to profits rather then revenues, the private benefits of\nthe investor, B(), are not likely to be affected, nor is the managerial effort cost, K().\nThis implies the following payoff function:\n\u00af\nR\n\u00af\nR\ndR + D - I + B() - K() (27)\nThe following result describes how the investor chooses the optimal ownership share and\nthe optimal debt level as a function of political risk.\nResult 5 The investor's maximum payoff is\nU\n(D\n, \n) =\n\u00af\nR(\n)\n- I + B(\n) - K(\nwhere \nis implicitly defined by\nd \u00af\nR\nd\nand D\nis given by\nD\n=\n\u00af\nR\nProof: See Appendix\nWe can now determine the comparative statics with respect to political risk 3.\nResult 6 The optimal debt level increases as confiscatory taxation increases.\ndD\n=\n\u00af\nThe optimal ownership share \ndecreases if \u00af\nR > 0 in the relevant parameter range, i.e.\nd\n=\nd \u00af\nR\nd\nR\n+ B - K\nProof: See Appendix\nIn contrast to the case of (creeping) expropriation, confiscatory taxation does not in-\ncrease the likelihood of bankruptcy, but instead induces the investor to choose a higher\ndebt level to avoid this drain on profits. As pointed out above, this strategy is particularly\nworthwhile if debt holders are not negatively affected and hence do not have to increase\ninterest rates. The optimal ownership share is likely to decrease as confiscatory taxation\nincreases, provided \u00af\nR > 0, which, according to the first order condition that implicitly\ndefines \n, is the case if B (\n) < K (\n).\nWe can summarize the findings from our theoretical analysis as follows:\nFor the optimal debt level, we find that the effects depend on the type of political\nrisk. In scenario (1) and (2) the effects were negative. Only in scenario (3) did we find\na positive effect of political risk on the optimal debt level. The effect of political risk on\nownership share tends to be negative in all three scenarios. Only in scenario (3) could it be\npositive, and only if the benefits from the entrenchment effect are particularly large. The\nfollowing result states furthermore that the optimal ownership share reacts more negatively\nto (creeping) expropriation than to confiscatory taxation.\nd\n<\nd\nd\nProof: See Appendix\nThis is due to the interaction with the optimal debt choice. The ownership share\nreduction is smaller in case of confiscatory taxation, where the debt level increases, than in\ncase of (creeping) expropriation, where the debt level is reduced as a response to political\nrisk.\n4 Empirical predictions\nWe now turn to the predictions that can be derived from our theoretical analysis. The\nfollowing predictions capture the results 4 and 6.\nHypothesis 1 The effect of political risk on the affiliate's debt level is negative in case of\n(creeping) expropriation and positive in case of confiscatory taxation.\nHypothesis 2 The effect of political risk on the ownership share is negative in case of\n(creeping) expropriation and tends to be negative in case of confiscatory taxation.\nThe problem of directly testing these hypotheses is that it may be difficult to identify\nempirically which type of political risk is present. An alternative approach would be to\nrank the different political risk scenarios according to their severity. It seems natural to\nargue that the first two scenarios of (creeping) expropriation capture a more severe type\nof political risk because they describe situations where political risk increases the risk of\nbankruptcy, whereas the third scenario describes a situation where political risk is less\nsevere, because it affects the profitability of the investment only, without jeopardizing the\nsurvival of the affiliate and hence without imposing additional dead weight losses. Following\nthis approach, we can state the following hypothesis.\nHypothesis 3 The more severe the political risk, the more likely the debt level will be\nnegatively affected.\nSimilarly, we can formulate our hypothesis about the ownership share.\nHypothesis 4 The more severe the political risk, the more likely the ownership share will\nbe negatively affected.\nResult 6 also allows us to compare the relative reactions of leverage and ownership share\nto political risk. Whereas the reaction of debt is always positive in case of confiscatory\ntaxation, this is possible for the ownership share but not necessary. From this, we derive\nthe following prediction.\nHypothesis 5 The ownership share is more likely to react negatively to political risk than\nthe debt level.\nFinally, we include one prediction about the impact of taxation on the level of debt and\nthe ownership share, based on Result 2.\nHypothesis 6 The effect of taxation is positive on the optimal debt level and it tends to\nbe negative on the ownership share.\nThe empirical analysis presented in section 6 is based on the Microdatabase Direct Invest-\nment (MiDi) of the Deutsche Bundesbank. The database contains a panel dataset of yearly\nfirm-level information on German parent companies and their foreign affiliates for the pe-\nriod 1996-2006. The parents are required by law to report information on their investments\nabroad and on the financial characteristics of their foreign affiliates if the balance sheet\ntotal of the affiliate and the ownership share are larger than a certain threshold that varies\nThe MiDi contains 469,332 observations with yearly observations over 11 years. As we\nare interested in outward FDI, we exclude all observations on inward FDI. This leaves\n303,870 observations that represent affiliate-year cells. Dropping all affiliates that are\npresent more than once in one year leaves 292,494 observations and deleting all indirect\nFDI leaves 208,441 observations. Deleting all firms that report negative equity removes\nobservations.\nIn each year, our sample consists of about 5,000 to 8,000 German parents and of about\nWe augment the MiDi dataset by country-level information. As a measure of political\nrisk, we use the time-varying International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) index provided by\nthe Political Risk Services (PRS) Group. The index is composed of 12 weighted variables\ncovering both political and social attributes.11 We recode the index in such a way that an\nincreasing value represents higher political risk.\n11Government stability, socioeconomic conditions, investment profile, internal conflict, external\nconflict, corruption, military in politics, religion in politics, law and order, ethnic tensions, demo-\ncratic accountability and bureaucracy quality.\nThere are numerous indices that try to capture the variation of political risk across\ncountries. A good overview is provided in Howell (2008). For our analysis, the ICRG\nindex is the best choice for three reasons: First, it takes into account diverse dimensions\nof political risk like corruption, bureaucratic quality, but also ethnic and religious tensions\nand socioeconomic conditions. Second, while many indices provide only information on a\nselective sample of countries, the ICRG index covers more than 140 countries. Third, the\nICRG index varies according to time and provides information for all years that are covered\nin the MiDi dataset.\nInformation on GDP, GDP per capita and the rate of inflation is taken from the World\nEconomic Outlook Database of the IMF (www.imf.org). The Private Credit variable is\nbased on Beck, Demirg\u00a8\nuc-Kunt, and Levine (1999). It measures the ratio of private credit\nlent by deposit money banks to GDP. Statutory tax rates are taken from the Institute for\nFiscal Studies (www.ifs.org.uk), as well as from various issues of the Corporate Tax Guides\nof Ernst&Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers.\nTable 2 provides descriptive statistics of the variables used in our analysis. The defi-\nnitions of the variables are standard, and they are also presented in Table 2. Comparing\nthe descriptive statistics to those of American MNE in Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004), we\nfind that regarding most variables used in our analysis, on average American and German\nMNEs tend to be quite similar. Both are active in about all countries worldwide. Conse-\nquently, the means of our country variables differ only insofar as the time period considered\nIn the period we analyze, both average inflation and political risk are lower. Affiliate-level\nvariables are also quite similar for German and US-American affiliates, the sole exception\nbeing profits over total assets: while Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) report a share of profit\nto assets of about 15 percent, this ratio is at only 4 percent for the German affiliates.\n6 Econometric Analysis\nThe aim of our analysis is to investigate how the capital structure choice of multinational\nenterprises reacts to political risk. The two choice variables we consider are the ownership\nshare and the level of leverage. We define the level of leverage as debt over total assets\nand the ownership share as the share of equity of the foreign affiliate held by the German\nparent.\nLeverage has a mean of 0.61 and a standard deviation of 0.31 at the firm-level. The\nstandard deviation of average leverage per country is 0.12. The mean of the ownership\nshare is 0.87, while its standard deviation is 0.24, and the average ownership share per\ncountry has a standard deviation of 0.14. The political risk indicator has an average value\nExamples of countries with extremely high political risk in our sample (an average\npolitical risk score above 0.45) are Algeria (with a political risk of 0.50), Colombia (with\nan average political risk of 0.47), Nigeria (with an average political risk of 0.54), Pakistan\n(political risk at 0.49), Yugoslavia (with an average political risk of 0.47) and Zimbabwe\nwith a political risk of 0.51. The country with the lowest average political risk in our sample\nperiod is Luxembourg with an average political risk score of 0.07.\nFigure 1 presents how the mean of the ownership share by country varies with political\nrisk. The graph suggests a negative relationship between the ownership share and political\nrisk even if we do not control for any other country or affiliate specific factors. When\nplotting leverage aggregated by country versus political risk (Figure 2), we cannot deduct\nany clear relationship between the two variables from the graph. In a regression analysis\nat the firm-level we are going to analyze the relationship more thoroughly.\nAll regressions presented in this paper are estimated by OLS and include parent-fixed-\neffects in order to control for parent-specific individual heterogeneity, and we include year\nand affiliate industry dummies. Thus, we aim to make use of the observed variation between\naffiliates of the same parent which are located in different countries as well as of the variation\nover time. In all regressions, we use heteroscedasticity robust standard errors, and we\ncontrol for clustering of the standard errors by parent company.\nIn Table 3, we present the effect of political risk on both our independent variables as\na first test of our hypotheses. We report each regression with and without including our\nstatutory tax variable, because we lose many observations when including it. The choice\nof independent variables is similar to Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) where the authors\ninvestigate the capital structure choice of US-American MNEs. The signs of the coefficients\nin our leverage regressions are equal to those presented in Desai, Foley and Hines with some\n12The coefficient of the private credit lent by deposit money banks to GDP is negative and\nOn average, an increase in political risk leads to an increase in affiliate leverage and\nto a decrease in the ownership share the parent holds in the foreign affiliate. This seems\nto be consistent with our hypothesis 5 that leverage is more likely to react positively, if at\nall, to political risk, than to the ownership share. In the leverage regression, the coefficient\nof political risk of 0.1491 can be interpreted as follows: when political risk increases by\nrepresents 2.3 percent of its mean value. This effect is quite close to the 2.9 percent\nestimated by Desai, Foley, Hines (2004) for affiliates of US-American MNEs. The estimated\n2.8 percent of its mean value. Thus, the relative impact of a change of one standard\ndeviation in political risk on leverage versus a one standard deviation change in statutory\ntaxes is about 81 percent. The estimated effect of political risk on the ownership share is\nsmaller. A one standard deviation increase of political risk decreases the ownership share\nby 1.1 percent of its mean value.\nThe fact that a firm's ownership and leverage choices might be related to each other can\nbe captured by a correlation of the error terms of the two regressions. The two equations\ntherefore form a system of seemingly unrelated regressions (Zellner (1962)). In general, it\nis more efficient to estimate this system of equations using feasible GLS and to allow for\ncorrelation of the error terms in the asymptotic variance matrix than to use OLS. In our\ncase, however, there is no efficiency gain from estimating the equations jointly, because the\nsame regressors are included in both regressions (Cameron and Trivedi (2005)). We test\nfor correlation of the estimated residuals and we find a positive and significant correlation\nin the residuals of the two regressions. This implies that a positive shock on one of the two\nvariables is also associated with an increase in the other variable.\nDesai, Foley, and Hines (2004) and Desai, Foley, and Hines Jr. (2006) assume a linear\neffect of political risk on the capital structure choice. By contrast, according to our model\nthe influence of political risk differs by type or strength of political risk, as noted in our\nhypotheses 1 to 4. To study this effect in more detail, we follow two empirical strategies.\nWe first continue to work with the aggregated ICRG index for political risk, but include\nsignificant at the 5 percent level in our leverage regression, while it is not significant even at the 10\npercent level in their regression. The logarithm of the affiliates sales shows a significant and positive\neffect in our regression, while it is not significant at the 10 percent level in the leverage regression\nreported by Desai, Foley and Hines.\npolitical risk squared, to allow for the the marginal effect of political risk to change with its\nlevel. This corresponds to our interpretation above, that the different scenarios or political\nrisk can be ranked with respect to their severity, with scenario III being the less severe\nand scenarios I/II the more severe. Our second strategy is to use alternative disaggregated\nmeasures for political risk, with the idea to capture more specifically one particular scenario.\nTable 4 presents our results for the ICRG political risk index, including political risk\nsquared. In both regressions, the estimated marginal effect of political risk on the variable\nin question is positive for low levels of political risk and negative for high levels of political\nrisk. Both results are consistent with the predictions of hypotheses 3 and 4. The big\ndifference between leverage and the ownership share is in the level of political risk where\nthe marginal effect changes from positive to negative: for leverage, a maximum is reached\nat a level of political risk of about 0.3. The vast majority (about 91 percent) of affiliates of\nGerman MNE operate in countries where the political risk is weaker than this - thus, for\nthem, the predicted effect is positive. Only for about 9 percent of all affiliates, we predict\nthe effect of political risk on leverage to be negative. When we model leverage as a linear\nfunction of political risk, the positive effect that we predict for the majority of affiliates of\nGerman MNEs, prevails, as seen in Table 3. For the ownership share, the change from a\npositive to a negative effect of political risk is predicted to take place for a much lower level\nof political risk (about 0.13). This is in fact consistent with our hypothesis 5.\nAs outlined above, as a second strategy to capture different scenarios of political risk,\nwe try different measures of political risk. We use two measures taken from the ICRG\ninvestment risk component (contract risk and repatriation risk) and three measures from\nthe Heritage Index (corruption, investment risk and property rights risk). Data on contract\nrisk and repatriation risk have only been available since 2001. Contract risk is defined as the\nrisk of unilateral contract modification or cancelation and, at worst, outright expropriation\nof foreign owned assets. Repatriation risk captures to what extent profits can be transferred\nout of the host country. Impediments include exchange controls, excessive bureaucracy and\na poor banking system. Corruption is defined as failure of the integrity of the system.\nInvestment risk measures the degree of restrictions on foreign investment, considering a\ncountry's policies towards foreign investment, as well as its policies towards internal capital\nflows. Property rights risk measures the lack of freedom to accumulate private property as\nwell as the risk to be expropriated.13\nAll measures have been recoded in such a way that first, higher values are associated\nwith higher risk and, second, they lie between 0 and 1. Table 5a shows that, as in Table\n3, the influence of political risk on the ownership share is negative, for all types of political\nrisk measures considered. Interestingly, however, political risk can have either a positive\nor a negative influence on the level of leverage, depending on the type of risk present\n(Table 5b). It is positive for corruption, investment risk and property right risk. According\nto our interpretation, this suggests that these three types of risk reduce the profitability\nof the investment without significantly increasing the risk of bankruptcy. In contrast,\nthe coefficient is negative for contract risk, which seems to affect the chances to generate\nrevenues and hence increases the risk of bankruptcy. Surprisingly, it is also negative for\nrepatriation risk, even though this kind of political risk is more about the use of profits,\ni.e., scenario 3, for which a positive coefficient is predicted. If, however, credits are taken at\nhome, not locally, the negative coefficient would make sense, because barriers to repatriation\nprofits would undermine the ability to repay credits.\n7 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have investigated how MNEs adapt their capital structure choices in\nthe presence of political risk, both theoretically and empirically. Our analysis suggests\nthat, when it comes to assessing the potential effects of political risk, it is important to\ndistinguish different types of stakeholders and how these are affected by different political\nmeasures. Only then is it possible to determine the optimal reaction of the investor to this\nrisky environment.\nAlmost by definition, any form of political risk negatively affects the profitability of a\nMNE as a whole. The investor as one of the equity holders is residual claimant of the MNE.\nThus, it is not surprising that he will want to reduce his stake in the firm when political\nrisk becomes more severe.\nBut, as our analysis has shown, the effects are less straightforward for debt holders. If\ndebt holders expect debt service to become less likely, they have to adjust their interest\n13For a more detailed description of the methodology underlying the Heritage Index see Beach\nrates. The larger the additional dead weight losses, the more costly debt financing becomes\nand hence the more leverage is reduced. If, instead, debt service is less affected than the\nreturns to equity holders, then debt can act as a shield against political risk and the balance\nshifts towards more debt finance relative to equity finance.\nWhy does it matter how political risk affects the multinational's choice of capital struc-\nture? Smaller ownership shares, for example, may negatively affect the governance structure\nof the MNE because they typically lead to smaller incentives for controlling the firm effec-\ntively. In addition, smaller ownership stakes could reduce the investor's incentive to transfer\nnecessary technology. These effects, though not explicitly modelled here, are well known\nin the literature. Higher leverage, and hence higher risk of bankruptcy, on the other hand,\nlead to higher dead weight losses arising from inefficient bankruptcy procedures and, in this\nway, add to the social cost of political risk.\nThus, we would expect different kinds of inefficiencies and dead weight losses to prevail,\ndepending on how political risk affects equity holders relative to debt holders. If ownership\nshares are reduced and leverage increases, one may have to face deteriorating governance\nstructures and more inefficiencies from increased risk of bankruptcy. If instead both own-\nership shares and leverage are reduced, it is mostly deteriorated governance structures one\nhas to expect.\nMathematical Appendix\nProof of Result 1\nRecall that the interest rate is implicitly determined by the following break even condition\nfor the bank:\n\u00af\nR\n\u00af\nR\ndR +\nsR\n\u00af\nR\nSolving and rearranging yields\n\u00af\nR\n(1 + r)D \u00af\nR -\n\u00af\nR\n-\nD\nFrom the implicit function\nwe can derive how the interest rate reacts for a change in the debt level D, using the implicit\nfunction theorem.\ndr\ndD\n= -\nR - (2 - s)(1 + r)D]\nUsing (38), this simplifies to\ndr\ndD\n=\nFurthermore, we can use (38) to derive how the interest rate reacts to a change in \u00af\nR, again\nusing the implicit function theorem.\ndr\nd \u00af\nR\n= -\nR - (2 - s)(1 + r)D]\nUsing (38), this simplifies to\ndr\nd \u00af\nR\n= -\nR\nThe investor maximizes\nU(D, ) = V (D, ) + B() - K() (43)\n=\n\u00af\nR()\n(1 - t)[R - (1 + r)D]\n\u00af\nR()\ndR + D - I + B() - K() (44)\n=\n\u00af\nR()\n\u00af\nR() +\n(1 + r)2D2 + D - I + B() - K()\nUsing equation (34) we can rewrite the payoff function in the following way\nU(D, ) = (1 - t)\n\u00af\nR() -\nD +\nD - I + B() - K() .
