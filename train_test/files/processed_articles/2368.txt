We examine associations of weight with\nindicators of biological risk in three nationally representative populations: the US National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, and the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study in Taiwan.\nIndicators of biological risk were compared for obese (defined using body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference) and normal\nweight individuals aged 54+. Generally, obesity in England was associated with elevated risk for more markers examined; obese\nAmericans also had elevated risks except that they did not have elevated blood pressure (BP). Including waist circumference in\nour consideration of BMI indicated different links between obesity and waist size across countries; we found higher physiological\ndysregulation among those with high waist but normal BMI compared to those with normal waist and normal BMI. Americans\nhad the highest levels of biological risk in all weight/waist groups. Cross-country variation in biological risk associated with obesity\nmay reflect differences in health behaviors, lifestyle, medication use, and culture.\n1. Introduction\nRising levels of obesity are becoming a worldwide phe-\nnomenon and are increasingly identified as a health problem\nacross the globe [1\u00ad4]. Higher weight has been associated\nwith adverse health indicators and outcomes, including\ncardiovascular disease [5\u00ad12], stroke [5, 13], cognitive and\namong aging populations is relatively recent and aging among\npeople who have been obese for much of their lives is also a\nof obesity in the US has continued to rise from about 17%\nalso increased during this period, from approximately 9%\nobesity remains much lower in England [26]. Additionally,\nthe difference in obesity between the US and England is\nmore pronounced for women. The level of obesity in US\ninvestigate differences in how obesity relates to indicators of\nphysiological dysregulation in men and women of diverse\npopulations. This comparison will lead to an improved\nunderstanding of how obesity might be differentially related\nto health and mortality across cultures and lifestyles.\nObesity was relatively rare in most populations until\nthe second part of the last century, but it has now become\ncommon in many countries [27]. The US population is\nrecognized as among the most obese in the world, although\nmany other countries are now approaching the US level\nand most countries are experiencing increasing obesity. This\nworldwide obesity epidemic began with the epidemiological\n2  \nrevolution and the virtual elimination of infectious disease;\nthe decline in manual labor needed to provide sustenance\nwith the industrial revolution; and the increasing availability\nObesity may result from behavioral differences across cul-\ntures or among individuals within cultures. Obesity reflects\nsome combination of calorie intake, diet content, and amount\nof physical activity. In some cultures, lack of physical activity\ncan be a more important determinant of obesity; in other\ncultures, overeating or food composition may be the more\nimportant determinant of obesity. It is also true that within\ncountries, individuals could differ in the causes of obesity. For\ninstance, changes in activity might be more characteristic of\nwomen or men resulting in different reasons for obesity by\ngender.\nThese differences may affect how obesity is related to\nother risk factors for poor health, and it may determine the\noverall health risk associated with obesity. If physical activity\nis maintained, the overall effect of obesity may be less than\nif the activity is not. One indication of the cause of obesity\nmay be the relationship between waist size and weight [30, 31].\nIn societies where obese people are more physically active,\nwaist size of the obese may be smaller than where physical\nactivity levels are lower. Waist circumference has also been\nlinked to late life mortality, where high waist circumference\nhas been associated with increased mortality among men\nand women in The Netherlands, while high BMI was not\nassociated with mortality [32]. This paper builds upon current\nobesity research by using both BMI and waist circumference\nto quantify obesity in order to determine how a combined\nindicator of weight and adiposity is related to physiological\ndysregulation in populations with different cultures, diets,\nbehaviors, and epidemiological histories.\nObesity has been related to many indicators of physi-\nological dysregulation including cardiovascular risk factors\nsuch as hypertension [33] and metabolic dysregulation in\nlipid levels or insulin resistance [34]. Obesity is also related\nto higher levels of systemic inflammation [35]. Most studies\nthat investigate the differences in biological risk associated\nwith excess weight have examined Western populations [33,\n36]. Comparative studies on the health risks associated\nwith obesity that examined the US and England reported\nthat obese Americans had an increased risk of diabetes\nand a higher waist circumference [37, 38]. These studies\nsuggested that differences in physical activity, diet, and social\nenvironments may explain these national differences. While\nthese differences have been observed between the US and\nEngland, these two Western countries have roughly similar\nlife expectancy, levels of living, history, and culture even while\nthe US has poorer health by a number of indicators of disease\nprevalence and biological risk [36, 39].\nComparative studies of the links between obesity and\nhealth outcomes and risk factors for obesity comparing\nWestern and non-Western countries indicate important dif-\nferences in the causes and consequences of obesity. A compar-\nison of the association of disease with overweight and obesity\nin Japan and the US indicated that the associations were\nstronger in the US than in Japanese women and that there was\nno association in Japanese men [40]. Links between social,\ndemographic, and behavioral risk factors for obesity also dif-\nfer markedly in Japan, Korea, and the US [41]. The availability\nof biomarker data from Taiwan--a middle-income country\nundergoing rapid economic growth, increasing obesity, and\nwith life expectancy recently increasing to levels similar to\nthat of the US and England--allows for investigation of the\nbiological risk associated with obesity in a population charac-\nterized by very different cultural, behavioral, socioeconomic,\nand dietary parameters.\nWe examine how elevated weight and obesity (using an\nindicator that considers both BMI and waist circumference)\nrelate to having levels defined as clinical risk for cardiovas-\ncular, metabolic, and inflammatory markers in three aging\nsocieties that are now relatively similar in life expectancy but\nthat differ in the timing of the epidemiological transition and\nobesity epidemic, history of economic development, socioe-\nconomic levels, general lifestyle habits, health behaviors, and\nhealth care systems: the US, England, and Taiwan. Finding\ndifferences in the relationship between obesity and indicators\nof physiological dysregulation in these three aging societies\nwill clarify whether increases in weight gain are equally\nproblematic across all countries.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Participants and Settings. We use data from three nation-\nally representative samples: the US National Health and\n3855), the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA,\nBiomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS) in Taiwan (2000;  =\n1023). These surveys collect information on demographics,\nas well as anthropometric, physical, and biological measures.\nNHANES regularly monitors the health and nutritional\nstatus of the US population. Every year, approximately 5,000\nindividuals undergo detailed interviews and medical exam-\ninations, which include collection of several physiological\nmeasures. NHANES utilizes a complex sampling design, and\nwhen weights are applied, the sample is representative of\nthe noninstitutionalized American population. We use the\nwhich matches the period in which ELSA was collected. For\nNHANES, we use individual-level data based on a sample of\nELSA includes participants drawn from households\nresponding to the Health Survey for England (HSE) in 1998,\npopulation aged 50 and older. The core ELSA sample (wave\nhousehold who were born prior to March 1, 1952, and their\n2009), which includes a nurse visit, includes wave 1 core\nmembers, if they are still alive and do not refuse further\ncontact after the first interview at wave 1. It also includes a\nrefresher sample to maintain the age structure of the sample\n(in waves 3 and 4), and their partners. For ELSA, we use\nindividual-level data based on a sample of 7,384 individuals\n  3\nTable 1: Characteristics of persons aged 54+ in the US, England, and\nTaiwan.\nUS England Taiwan\nAt-risk levels of biomarkers (%)\nHigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol\nLow-density lipoprotein cholesterol\nIn Taiwan, this indicates having smoked in the past 6 months.\nSEBAS is drawn from a follow-up survey of the Survey\nof Health and Living Status of the Near Elderly and Elderly\nin Taiwan (also known as the Taiwan Longitudinal Study\nof Aging (TLSA)), a nationally representative survey of\nTaiwanese adults (including institutionalized individuals)\nsubsample of individuals was randomly selected for inclusion\nin SEBAS.

We examine the following indicators of phys-\niological dysregulation often associated with obesity and\nalso associated with increased risk for multiple adverse\nhealth outcomes and obesity [43, 44]: (1) cardiovascular\nmarkers: high systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure\n(DBP); (2) metabolic markers: high levels of blood lipids\n(total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and\nfasting triglycerides), low levels of high-density lipoprotein\n(HDL) cholesterol, and high fasting glucose and glycated\nhemoglobin; (3) high levels of inflammatory markers C-\nreactive protein (CRP; available in NHANES and ELSA) and\ninterleukin-6 (IL-6; available in SEBAS), as CRP and IL-\n6 have been positively associated with BMI [35]. For each\nindicator we use clinical cutpoints or widely used research-\nbased cutpoints to indicate high levels of risk which are shown\nThere has been debate as to the best indicator of\nobesity: body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference.\nWaist circumference is thought to be a better measure\nof abdominal adiposity than BMI and a better indicator\nof risk of poor health outcomes, including all-cause and\ncardiovascular mortality [46, 47]. For this reason we combine\nthe two indicators in our investigation. We investigate the\nassociation between BMI and biomarkers across categories\nof BMI (underweight <18.5 kg/m2, normal and overweight\n35 kg/m2) and waist circumference categorized as normal\nor high waist (high waist: men 120 cm, women 88 cm).\nWe create a composite measure of obesity and adiposity by\ncategorizing individuals into five groups: (1) underweight and\nnormal waist (all underweight individuals had a normal waist\ncircumference), (2) normal/overweight BMI (termed normal\nBMI) and normal waist circumference (reference group),\n(3) normal/overweight BMI (termed normal BMI) and high\nwaist circumference (termed high waist), (4) obese and high\nwaist (all obese individuals had a high waist circumference),\nand (5) very obese. We also evaluate an alternate definition for\nobesity in Taiwan based on BMI 27, as it has been suggested\nby some that obesity levels should be differentially defined for\nAsians [48, 49]. A similar composite measure of obesity and\nadiposity was calculated using this alternate definition of BMI\nin Taiwan.\nBecause these risk factors are all assumed to be associated\nwith obesity and because dysregulation in multiple physio-\nlogical systems has been shown to predict many of the poor\nhealth risk outcomes associated with aging, we also create\ntwo summary measures of risk based on the total number\nof at-risk levels of biomarkers, either 9 or 8 [50]. Because\nCRP values for SEBAS are not available, this measure is not\nincluded in the 9-item summary measure for Taiwan, but\na summary measure (range 0\u00ad9) was calculated for Taiwan\nusing IL-6, another indicator of inflammation, instead of\nthe CRP values included for the US and England. A second\nalternate summary measure of biological risk, excluding the\ninflammatory marker (range 0\u00ad8), was examined for all three\ncountries. Biological risk summary scores were computed\nfor individuals who had missing values on no more than 3\nbiological markers.\nWe examine multiple covariates in our investigation of\nthe relationship between obesity and biological risk. Self-\nreported use of antihypertensives was determined in all three\ncountries, and use of lipid-lowering statins was only asked in\nthe US sample. Dichotomous variables were created to indi-\ncate whether the respondent reported being a current smoker\nand participating in at least moderate physical activity for\nexercise (e.g., brisk walking, running, or swimming) in the\npast 30 days (for the US and England) or generally exercising\nonce a week (for Taiwan).\n2.3. Statistical Analysis. We use logistic regression models\nto determine the odds of having at-risk levels of a specific\nbiomarker for obese men and women among the three\n4  \npopulations. For all countries, the comparison group for BMI\nand waist circumference is the normal BMI and normal\nwaist group. The regressions included indicators of age, use\nof antihypertensives, current smoking status, and having\nexercised in the past 30 days. Ordinary least squares (OLS)\nregression models were used to determine the relationship\nbetween the summary measures of biological risk and the\ncomposite measure of obesity and adiposity. The OLS models\nwere run with the same covariates as the logistic regression\nmodels.\n3. Results\nLevel of Physiological Dysregulation. We begin by examining\nnational differences in the high risk levels of individual\nbiomarkers (Table 1). Elevated blood pressure is more preva-\nlent in Taiwan than in England or the US. Low levels--or\nhigh risk levels--of HDL cholesterol are also more common\nin Taiwan. High total and LDL cholesterol is more common\namong the English; lower levels of plasma glucose, CRP, and\nglycated hemoglobin are also characteristic of the English.\nFew adults in England have elevated levels of fasting glucose\nand Taiwanese adults.\nLevels of BMI and Waist Circumference. In all countries, most\npeople in this age range are in the normal to overweight\nTaiwan, respectively) (Table 2(a)). Americans are more likely\nTaiwanese (7.2%). Among the obese, Americans are much\nmore likely to be very obese: 13.4% of the total US sample,\n10.1% in England, and about 1% in Taiwan. Both among the\nobese and very obese, the average BMI is higher in the US\nand England compared to Taiwan. Few are underweight in\nTaiwan, resp.).\nWhen we examine waist circumference, the US has the\nhighest average waist circumference, with 65.5% of Amer-\na high waist size (Table 2(a)). This means that high waist\ncharacterizes a substantial number of those who would be\ncategorized as normal weight in the US and England. Among\nthose in the normal and overweight group about half (49.5%)\nof Americans and a third (36.4%) of the English have high\nwaist (Table 2(b)). Almost all obese individuals have a high\nEngland), but only 78.4% of the obese in Taiwan also have\na high waist. When we use the alternate obese cutpoint of\n27 kg/m2 in Taiwan, less than half of the obese individuals\nhave a high waist (not shown here).\nValues of Control Variables. Americans exhibit the highest\nproportion of the older population taking antihypertensive\nmedication (47.1%) (Table 1). The percentage who reports\ntaking antihypertensives is lower in England (32.0%) and\nTaiwan (28.6%). Americans are more likely to be current\nland (13.9%). More than half of the population in all countries\nreport having exercised in the past 30 days, with more English\nLinks between Obesity and Physiological Dysregulation. Men\nwith normal BMI and high waist have a greater likelihood\nthan men with normal BMI and normal waist size of having\nhigh-risk levels of triglycerides in all three countries. In\nthe US and England, men with high waist are more likely\nto have high levels of glycosylated hemoglobin and higher\nCRP; fasting glucose is also elevated among this group in\nthe US (Table 3(a)). Men who are obese in the US have\nfewer elevated risk factors than those with high waist who\nare not obese; in the US, obese men are only more likely\nthan normal weight men without high waist to have elevated\nglycated hemoglobin, fasting glucose and CRP. Taiwanese\nobese men also have elevated glycated hemoglobin and\nhigh triglyceride levels. English men who are obese have\nmore elevated risk: both blood pressure indicators, HDL\ncholesterol, triglycerides, glycated hemoglobin, and CRP.\nVery obese men in England have the same elevated risk\nfactors with the exception of DBP. Very obese men in the US\nare more likely to have elevated fasting glucose in addition to\nCRP and glycated hemoglobin.\nResults for women were somewhat different. English and\nTaiwanese women with normal weight and high waist are\nmore likely to have elevated SBP, DBP, and glycosylated\nhemoglobin; only British women with higher waist have\nsignificantly elevated triglycerides and only the Taiwanese\nwomen had more HDL risk. High risk CRP is more common\namong both American and English women with normal BMI\nand high waist, and this risk of elevated CRP is also higher\nin the obese and very obese (Table 3(b)). Obese women in\nBritain had elevations in the same markers as normal BMI\nand high waist English women, while obese women in the\nUS only have elevated fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin,\nand CRP; obese women in Taiwan only had high DBP. With\nthe exception of Taiwan, levels of the inflammatory markers\n(CRP in the US and England; IL-6 in Taiwan) are more likely\nto be elevated among persons with a high waist and normal\nBMI, obese or very obese, compared to their normal BMI and\nnormal waist counterparts.\nAmong men, an increase in the biological risk summary\nscore (range 0\u00ad9) is associated with having a high waist\nrelative to being of normal BMI and normal waist in all\nthree countries (Table 4(a)). Being obese or very obese is\nalso related to a higher biological risk summary score (0\u00ad9)\nfor men in the US and England. Generally, the size of the\nassociated increase is larger with increasing weight. These\nequations explain 6 to 11 percent of the variance in the\nsummary indicator of biological risk. These relationships are\nsimilar for women (Table 4(b)), with one exception: obese\nTaiwanese women do not have a significantly increased\nbiological risk compared to their normal weight and normal\nwaist counterparts.\nWhen we consider the alternate summary score that\nexcludes our indicators of inflammation (range 0\u00ad8), being\nobese or very obese is no longer associated with a higher\nbiological risk summary score in US men compared to men\n  5\nTable 2: (a) Distribution of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference and mean BMI by BMI categories of high waist circumference\nin the US, England, and Taiwan.

The\nsize of the effects of the obesity categories is reduced on the\n8-indicator summary measure in both England and the US,\nindicating the strong link between CRP and obesity. The 2\nis also reduced in these equations for England and the US.\nFor Taiwan, the 8 and 9 category measures yield very similar\nresults.\nWomen in England and Taiwan, but not women in the\nUS, with a higher waist but who are not obese have signifi-\ncantly higher physiological dysregulation compared to their\nnormal BMI and normal waist counterparts. Obese women\nin all three countries have elevated risk and the very obese\nhave even higher risk (Table 5(b)). The alternate biological\nrisk summary measure (0\u00ad8) yields different relationships\nbetween weight and physiological dysregulation in the US\nand Taiwan. In the US, only very obese women have a higher\nalternate biological risk summary score (0\u00ad8). In Taiwan,\nobese and normal BMI and high waist women exhibit higher\nalternate biological risk summary scores compared to their\nnormal BMI and normal waist counterparts, except when\nsmoking status, physical activity, and use of hypertensives are\nincluded.\nFigures 1(a) and 1(b) illustrate the predicted alternate\nbiological risk score (0\u00ad8) for each weight category for men\nand women (respectively) aged 65 who are nonsmokers, do\nnot engage in physical activity, and are currently taking anti-\nhypertensive medication. Equations in Tables 5(a) and 5(b)\nare the basis of this estimation. This figure allows for country\ncomparisons of individuals with these characteristics within\neach weight category and across weight categories. Generally,\nincreases in weight categories correspond to an increase in\nbiological risk score. The effect of weight appears to be largest\namong Taiwanese men. Across countries, the predicted values\nindicate that the US has the highest biological risk score\nwithin each respective weight category among men and\nwomen of the same age and lifestyle behaviors. With the\nexception of women in the normal BMI and high waist group,\nEngland has the second highest biological risk score within\neach weight category, followed by Taiwan. Among 65-year-\nold women with the noted lifestyle behaviors and with a\nnormal BMI and high waist, Taiwan has a slightly higher\nbiological risk score than England.\nWhen we consider the alternate BMI cutpoint for obesity\nin Taiwan (BMI  27 kg/m2), our findings for the individual\nbiomarkers and summary measures of biological risk are\nsimilar to using the BMI  30 kg/m2 cutoff for Taiwan except\nthat the category normal weight with high waist no longer\ndiffers from the omitted category (results not shown).\n4. Discussion\nThis study observes three general findings about how bio-\nlogical risk is associated with obesity in three countries that\ndiffer in lifestyle and culture. First, obesity is associated\nwith physiological dysregulation in all countries with differ-\nences in the links between specific indicators of biological\nrisk and obesity. Generally, obesity in England is associ-\nated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and elevated glycated\nhemoglobin; Americans who are obese are not more likely to\nhave hypertension. In Taiwan, obese women are more likely\nto have elevated DBP and obese men have an increased risk\nof elevated triglycerides and glycated hemoglobin compared\nto their nonobese, normal waist counterparts. Our biological\nrisk summary scores indicate that at all levels of weight\nphysiological dysregulation was highest in the US, followed\nby England (with one exception), with Taiwanese exhibiting\nthe lowest biological risk in all groups among the three coun-\ntries. Second, these relationships remain after controlling for\ndemographic factors, participation in physical activity, and\n6  \nTable 3: Odds ratios from logistic regression models predicting at-risk levels of biomarkers by BMI and waist circumference groups (normal\nBMI and high waist, obese, and very obese) among American, English, and Taiwanese aged 54+.\n(a) Men\n Normal BMI + high waist\nUS England Taiwan\nUS England Taiwan\nCardiovascular risk factors\nMetabolic risk factors\nInflammation markers\nObese Very obese\nUS England Taiwan US England Taiwan\nCardiovascular risk factors\nMetabolic risk factors\nInflammation markers\nCould not be estimated.\nSBP: systolic blood pressure, DBP: diastolic blood pressure, Total-C: total cholesterol, HDL-C: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C: low-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol; OR: odds ratio; CI: confidence interval.\nAll models adjusted for age, use of antihypertensives, smoking status, and physical activity.\nHigh-waist circumference men  102 cm, women  88 cm.\nReferent group: normal body mass index (18.5\u00ad29.9 kg/m2) + normal waist.\nThe results are not computed for Very Obese in Taiwan because too few individuals are classified as very obese.\n(b) Women\n Normal BMI + high waist\nUS England Taiwan\nUS England Taiwan\nCardiovascular risk factors\nMetabolic risk factors\n  7\n(b) Continued\n Normal BMI + high waist\nUS England Taiwan\nUS England Taiwan\nInflammation markers\nObese Very obese\nUS England Taiwan US England Taiwan\nCardiovascular risk factors\nMetabolic risk factors\nInflammation markers\nSBP: systolic blood pressure, DBP: diastolic blood pressure, Total-C: total cholesterol, HDL-C: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C: low-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol; OR: odds ratio; CI: confidence interval.\nAll models adjusted for age, use of antihypertensives, smoking status, and physical activity.\nHigh-waist circumference men  102 cm, women  88 cm.\nReferent group = normal body mass index (18.5\u00ad29.9 kg/m2) + normal waist.\nThe results are not computed for Very Obese in Taiwan because too few individuals are classified as very obese.\nother behavioral factors. Third, similar to obese older adults,\nhigh waist individuals with normal BMI also exhibit greater\nphysiological dysregulation in all countries compared to their\nnormal BMI and normal waist counterparts. This dysregula-\ntion appears to be largest in Taiwan. There are, however, noted\ngender differences across the countries. Obesity in US men\nappeared to have a somewhat smaller effect on physiological\ndysregulation.\nThe country differences in the links between obesity\nand biological risk are particularly interesting. Our finding\nof a higher physiological dysregulation, as shown by the\nalternate biological risk summary score, in Taiwan compared\nto the US and England could be due to a couple of potential\nexplanations. First, it may be due to differences in the years\nlived with obesity. The prevalence of obesity in the US\nand England is much higher than in Taiwan, indicating an\nearlier initial rise in obesity relative to Taiwan. From 1978\nto 2002, the proportion of obese Americans and Britons\nwomen, resp.) [26]. The estimates for obesity prevalence in\nTaiwan indicate a recent increase for men but not women.\nlevels of risk among older adults who have lived longer years\nwith obesity could be a reflection of better pharmacologic\ncontrol of physiological dysregulation (e.g., through statin\nuse), which may in turn confer less biological risk in these\npopulations compared to populations of currently obese Tai-\nwanese adults who may have more recently begun living with\nobesity.\nA second reason for the observed country differences\nin obesity may be due to differences in dietary habits and\nlifestyle. The US and England are two modern, Western\npopulations whose diets have been influenced by increased\nindustrialization and have over time come to be characterized\nby high glycemic loads and high fatty acid composition\n[52]. Taiwan, on the other hand, represents a country that\nhas experienced the effects of the industrial and scientific\nrevolutions later than that of the US and England but is\ncurrently rapidly undergoing economic development and\ndemographic change. The recent economic changes in Taiwan\nmay indicate that obese older adults in Taiwan have more\nrecently begun to consume high-fat diets, which could result\nin greater initial physiological dysregulation associated with\naccess to Western-influenced dietary habits.\n8  \nTable 4: Regression coefficients of the full summary measure (range: 0\u00ad9) of biological risk on body mass index (BMI) and waist\ncircumference among older adults.\n(a) Men\nSummary measure (0\u00ad9)\nBMI and waist circumference\nNormal BMI + normal waist Reference Reference Reference Reference\n(b) Women\nSummary measure (0\u00ad9)\nBMI and waist circumference\nNormal BMI + normal waist Reference Reference Reference Reference\nbecause too few individuals are classified as very obese).\nModel 1 includes age and BMI and waist circumference category.\nModel 2 includes Model 1 covariates in addition to smoking, physical activity, and antihypertensives.\nAll underweight individuals had a normal waist circumference.\nAll obese individuals had a high waist circumference.\nIncludes CRP (for US and England) and IL-6 (for Taiwan);  < .05.\nDespite controlling for lifestyle behaviors thought to be\nlinked with health, the country differences in obesity and\nphysiological regulation remain. Moreover, the consideration\nof antihypertensives does not alter our substantive conclu-\nsions on these associations. This suggests that despite the\ngreater use of medications to treat hypertension in the US,\nobesity among Americans is associated with greater overall\nbiological risk than the other two countries. This is supported\nby findings from the general population of Americans relative\nto England, which report that the US is faced with greater\nhealth disadvantages than England in adulthood [36] and\nacross the life span [38].\nWe also note differences in biological profiles of obese\nindividuals between the two Westernized countries: the US\nand England. The excess risk of hypertension associated\nwith obesity in England was not found in the US. These\ndifferences may be due to the higher use of medications\namong Americans compared to the English, with about\n16% more men and 18% more women in the US aged\n65+ taking antihypertensive medication compared to their\n  9\nTable 5: Regression coefficients of the alternate summary measure (range: 0\u00ad8) of biological risk on body mass index (BMI) and waist\ncircumference among older adults.\n(a) Men\nSummary measure (0\u00ad8)\nBMI and waist circumference\nNormal BMI + normal waist Reference Reference Reference Reference\n(b) Women\nSummary measure (0\u00ad8)\nBMI and waist circumference\nNormal BMI + normal waist Reference Reference Reference Reference\nbecause too few individuals are classified as very obese).\nModel 1 includes age and BMI and waist circumference category.\nModel 2 includes Model 1 covariates in addition to smoking, physical activity, and antihypertensives.\nAll underweight individuals had a normal waist circumference.\nAll obese individuals had a high waist circumference.\nExcludes CRP (for US and England) and IL-6 (for Taiwan);  < .05.\nBritish counterparts [53]. The greater use of hypertensive\nmedications in the US is also noted when compared to Japan\nand countries across Europe [53].\nTwo notable differences in country patterns of the rela-\ntionship between obesity and physiological dysregulation by\nsex are found. Among men in England and Taiwan, the order\nof magnitude of physiological dysregulation increases with\nhigher weight categories; however, this is not observed for US\nmen. This difference may be due to our inability to consider\nstatin use in England and Taiwan, which may be particularly\nimportant in the relationship between obesity and physio-\nlogical dysregulation for men. Conversely, the importance of\nconsidering statin use may be less vital to understanding the\ncountry differences in the association between obesity and\nphysiological dysregulation among women, given that the\nrelationship for women is more consistent across countries,\nnamely in the US and England.\nDifferences in underweight and physiological dysregula-\ntion are also observed. In US women, underweight corre-\nsponds with higher biological risk (though nonsignificant)\n10  \nUnderweight\nNormal BMI +\nnormal waist\nNormal BMI +\nhigh waist\nObese\nVery obese\nUS\nEngland\nTaiwan\nBiological risk score\n(a)\nUnderweight\nNormal BMI +\nnormal waist\nNormal BMI +\nhigh waist\nObese\nVery obese\nUS\nEngland\nTaiwan\nBiological risk score\n(b)\nFigure 1: (a) Predicted biological risk summary measure (range: 0\u00ad\n8) in the US, England, and Taiwan by weight categories for men\naged 65 who are nonsmokers, do not engage in physical activity,\nand are currently taking antihypertensive medication.

Further studies will be\nrequired to explore possible explanations for these differences\nin physiological dysregulation.\nThe higher biological risk observed among normal BMI\nand high waist individuals relative to normal BMI and normal\nwaist older adults builds upon previous studies that report\non alternate indicators of body shape, which vary across\ncountries [54]. The importance of waist circumference is\nunderscored by our current study, as well as a growing body\nof literature on the predictive value of waist circumference\non indicators of health. Higher rates of diabetes among older\nAmericans compared to Britons have been accounted for\nby high waist circumference as opposed to BMI differences\n[30]. Additionally, increasing waist circumference is more\npredictive of greater risk of incident diabetes than BMI in\nmiddle-aged British men ([55] and the European Prospective\nInvestigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam\nstudy [56]). Waist circumference, as an indicator of central\nfat mass, is thought to be more strongly associated with\ndisease risk, and in our case with physiological dysregulation,\ncompared to BMI, which is considered a cruder index\nof adiposity. Banks and colleagues [30] cite differences in\nphysical activity, diet and greater psychosocial environmental\nchallenges in America compared to England as potential\nmechanisms linking central adiposity and type 2 diabetes.\nOur study considers some of these possible mechanisms (e.g.,\nphysical activity and antihypertensive use) but finds that they\nexplain little of the relationship between biological risk and\nadiposity among the three countries. Together, these results\nhighlight the importance of considering waist circumference\nin investigating the links between indicators of health and\nadiposity. They also support the need for identifying addi-\ntional mechanisms that explain these relationships.\nOur finding of the biological risks associated with obesity\namong older Taiwanese adults underscores the growing\nconcern for risks associated with obesity in countries rapidly\nundergoing modernization. In comparing the biological risk\nof obese individuals among the three countries, we are able\nto use these international comparisons to our advantage\nto examine how differences in modernization influence the\nhealth of older adults in different populations. This may\nhave potential health policy implications that underscore the\nimportance of addressing and controlling the rising obesity\nepidemic that has become most widespread in countries,\nlike the US and England, that have long experienced high\neconomic growth and in countries currently undergoing\nrapid economic development. The increasing use of biological\ninformation to inform our understanding of health repre-\nsents an innovative method in biodemography that will fur-\nther contribute to the testing of current comparative theory\nand the potential creation of new paradigms surrounding the\ninfluence of modernization on health.\nThere are a number of principal strengths of the current\nstudy. First is the use of a broad range of biological markers\nacross three large-scale population surveys. The inclusion\nof biological information as objective precursors of health\nallows, to some extent, a fairly comparable comparison of\nindicators of health across the different populations. An\nexception to this uniform comparison of biomarkers across\nthe three surveys is our use of inflammatory marker CRP in\nthe US and England and our inclusion of a different marker\nof inflammation (IL-6) in Taiwan. Of note, CRP seems to\nbe more strongly associated with obesity than IL-6. Second,\nour study considers two indicators of obesity: BMI and\nwaist circumference. A growing body of literature has made\n  11\ndistinctions between BMI and waist circumference, namely,\nsuggesting that waist circumference is a better indicator of\nabdominal obesity, which in turn has been associated with\nobesity-related health risks. Our findings generally report a\nsimilar association between increased biological risk and (1)\nnormal BMI and high waist and (2) obese and high waist.\nUsing the US NHANES, [57] reported that when both waist\ncircumference and BMI were included in their analyses, only\nwaist circumference was a significant predictor of comorbid-\nity. Although this and other studies have suggested that waist\ncircumference may be a better indicator of obesity and risk for\nadverse health outcomes, our study finds the two indicators\nto be similarly associated with biological risk across the three\ncountries.\nWe note some limitations of the current study. First, we\nexamine population-based data from three countries at a\nsingle time point. This limits our ability to distinguish among\nage-period-cohort effects. Future studies of longitudinal data\nwill allow for further investigations of the potential role of\nobesity on biological risk observed in the current associa-\ntions. Second, we do not have measures of some lifestyle and\nmedical behaviors for some of the datasets (e.g., statin use),\nwhich likely influence the relationship between obesity and\nbiological risk. As such, we are unable to include such factors\nin our analyses of all three countries. It is possible that these\nlifestyle behaviors are key explanatory factors to the noted\ncross-country differences in obesity-related biological risk.\nThe cross-country differences in the relationship between\nincreased biological risk for individuals who are obese and\nhave a high waist underscore potential differences in health\nand lifestyle behaviors. These behaviors may be a result of\ncountry differences in economic development that we are\nnot able to observe in this study. The country differences\nin the links between obesity and physiological dysregulation\nare particularly marked when comparing obesity among\nTaiwanese older adults relative to Westernized populations,\nsuch as the US and England. Further examination of these\nrelationships over time and across other countries will\ncontribute to our understanding of the potential factors\nresponsible for these country-specific variations in biological\nrisk, as obesity becomes increasingly more prevalent and\nolder adults in various countries live more years with obesity\nand increased adiposity.\n"
