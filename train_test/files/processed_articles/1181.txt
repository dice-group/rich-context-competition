Results suggest a need to target multiple neighborhood and individual\ncorrelates simultaneously to reduce secondary violence exposure among children\nand adolescents. Directions for future research are discussed.\nKeywords adolescence; childhood; neighborhood context; secondary exposure;\nviolence\nIntroduction\nOver the past decade, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reports that violent\nvictimizationagainstchildrenandadolescentsintheUnitedStateshasbeendeclin-\ning (Klaus & Rennison, 2002). American youth, however, still experience high levels\nof violence compared to many other age groups (Centers for Disease Control [CDC],\n2000). In fact, those between the ages of 12 and 17 have historically had the highest\nratesofviolentvictimizationcomparedtootheragegroups(Rennison,2002).While\nviolent victimization of youth has been a topic of much empirical research\nUnited States are vulnerable to other forms of violence that are also important\ndue to the adverse consequences related to them (see Buka, Stichick, Birdthistle,\n& Earls, 2001). One of these is secondary exposure to violence defined as witnessing\nor hearing violence, as opposed to primary violence, i.e., being the victim of a\nphysically violent act (Buka et al., 2001). Examples of secondary exposure include,\nbut are not limited to, witnessing someone being shot, murdered, and attacked\nand hearing gun shots. The current study concentrates on secondary exposures\nthat children and adolescents experience in the neighborhoods they live.\nIn July 2002, several federal agencies including the Center of Disease Control,\nthe National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Institute of Justice spon-\nsored an extensive workshop titled, \"Children Exposed to Violence: Current\nStatus, Gaps, and Research Priorities.\" Violence researchers from around the\nUnited States convened to discuss the gaps in knowledge and what future\nresearch priorities should be regarding children's exposure to various types of\nviolence. One conclusion was that understanding pathways of exposure to\ncommunity violence is vital to curb the effects it can have on children. During\nthis workshop researchers identified several negative consequences of exposure\nto violence including post traumatic stress disorder and psychobiological\noutcomes that manifest in changes to physiological arousal (e.g., high blood pres-\nsure and cortisol production). They also concluded that community exposure to\nviolence is associated with negative behavioral outcomes such as aggression,\nantisocial behavior, and substance abuse. Given these consequences, it is impor-\ntant to understand the contextual and individual-level risk factors that are\nrelated to the frequency of neighborhood exposure to violence. However, no\nstudies have yet empirically addressed both neighborhood and individual risk\nfactors in the same study, primarily due to data restrictions and designs that have\nnot allowed for these investigations (e.g., children nested in many neighborhoods\nand reliable measures of structural and social processes of neighborhoods\ncombined with individual measures of families and children living in neighbor-\nhoods). In turn, such restrictions make it difficult to disentangle the competing\neffects of neighborhood characteristics versus individual characteristics on\nsecondary exposure to violence, consequently leading to an incomplete set of\nfindings for informing intervention and preventions practices. In sum, we know\nlittle about if and how neighborhoods in which children live influence their\nfrequency of exposure above and beyond individual characteristics (Buka et al.,\n2001). Researchers have identified several individual correlates of exposure but\nhave largely done so without accounting for the contexts in which children reside.\nWe now have considerable knowledge about the individual factors contributing\nto violent victimization (Christiansen & Evans, 2005; Esbensen & Huizinga, 1991;\nimpacts of violence--and how communities contribute to them--is far more\nstanding the calls from some researchers to give greater attention to studying\nsecondary violence (Buka et al., 2001). Scholars have made calls to target the\nenvironments in which children live to alleviate violence exposure and the result-\ning negative consequences (Luther & Goldstein, 2004; Sullivan, Kung, & Farrell,\n2004), but such calls do not appear to be empirically grounded in research that\nindicates structural and social aspects of neighborhoods are any more important\nthan individual risk factors.\nIt is logical to suspect that neighborhood factors contribute to violence expo-\nsure, as much research has found a link between neighborhood conditions and\nviolent crime (Sampson, Raudenbush, & Earls, 1997). Community factors, like\npoverty and lack of social cohesion within neighborhoods, may create a context\nladen with risk for children independent of individual action and individual\nprotective factors. For instance, an individual may possess a number of\ndifferent traits and characteristics that decreases their risk of being exposed\nbut may still witness and hear violence if the community structure facilitates\nhigh levels of violence.1 Moreover, a person's behavior may be bounded by the\nstructural characteristics of the local community. For instance, recent research\n1. Several explanations have been put forth as mechanisms to explain why children and adolescents\nexperience violence (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2000). Jencks and Mayer (1990) identified several\ntheoretical frameworks for linking adverse child and adolescent outcomes to neighborhood conditions.\nForinstance,collectivesocializationmodels,suggestthatneighborhoodsinfluencechildrenandadoles-\ncents through community social organization, control, and collective efficacy, including the presence\nof adult role models and social control agents who, in addition to structuring routines and opportunities\nin the neighborhood, supervise and monitor children and adolescents in the neighborhood.\nhas shown that in structurally disadvantaged neighborhoods adolescents and\nchildren adopt what Anderson (1999) identifies as the \"code of the streets\"\nwhere they are willing to engage in violence or show their toughness to gain\nrespect among others in their neighborhood so that they are less vulnerable to\nviolent attacks (i.e., Baumer, Horney, Felson, & Lauritsen, 2003; Stewart et al.,\n2006). Recent research, however, shows evidence supporting the opposite in\nthat kids who adopt the \"street code\" are at an increased risk for becoming\nviolently victimized, especially for those residing in increasingly more violent\nneighborhoods. This could perhaps also explain why some kids are at an\nincreased risk for witnessing and hearing violence in disadvantage neighbor-\nhoods.2 In sum, it is important to understand how neighborhood conditions\ndirectly facilitate and ameliorate risk for exposure, above and beyond individual\nrisk.\nA growing body of research does support the fact that particular characteris-\ntics of youth are correlated with experiencing secondary violence. These charac-\nteristics include gender, race, age, socioeconomic status, and even behavioral\nand parenting characteristics (for a review see Buka et al., 2001). Unfortunately,\nstudies on secondary exposure to violence rarely move beyond such characteris-\ntics. Therefore, this study will also identify an additional, potential risk factor\nfor exposure, i.e., low self-control, which predicts personal victimization and\n2004), but, to our knowledge, has not been implemented in research on second-\nary exposure to violence. Ultimately, identifying additional risk factors and\nmaking adjustments for them will aid in isolating whether neighborhood effects\ndo exist.\nTo address gaps in extant research, the current study uses data from waves 1\nand 2 of the longitudinal cohort study (i.e., 9-, 12-, and 15-year-old cohorts) of\nthe Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) to assess\nif and how characteristics of neighborhoods where children reside matter in\ntheir secondary exposures to violence within their neighborhoods. Data were\ncollected on children and adolescents residing within socially, racially, and\neconomically diverse neighborhoods of Chicago. Exploiting the nested data\nstructure of the PHDCN by estimating a series of multilevel models, we were\nable to identify the influences of neighborhood characteristics on exposure\nwhich indicate that some structural dimensions of neighborhoods, as well as the\npresence of youth organizations, are important for explaining secondary\nexposure. Before discussing these data and our results, we define secondary\nexposure to violence, discuss its prevalence and consequences, how individual\nand neighborhood characteristics can be important determinates of exposure,\nand then point to limitations of past contextual research.\n2. While Anderson's (1999) hypothesis regarding the \"code of the streets\" and violence exposure\ncould be a possible explanation as to why we might expect a correlation between neighborhood\nconditions and exposure to secondary violence, this hypothesis is beyond the scope of the current\nstudy, and we encourage other researchers to directly examine this possibility.\nDefining Types of Exposure to Violence\nExposure to violence has traditionally been separated by two primary catego-\nries: direct and indirect exposure (Martin, Gordon, & Kupersmith, 1995;\nsure, or personal violent victimization, is defined by purposeful acts of others to\ncause injury, such as being a victim of a shooting, stabbing, being robbed, or\nthreatened. Indirect or secondary exposure entails witnessing, and even hear-\ning, acts of violence. Although some definitions of secondary exposure are\ninconsistent, studies often refer to eye-witnessing acts such as murder, assault,\nshootings, or threats of violence, while others have included hearing violent\nevents such as gunshots. Buka and colleagues (2001) have recently redefined\nthis construct by categorizing different levels of exposure that include primary,\ni.e., personal victimization, secondary, i.e., violence seen or heard, and\ntertiary exposures, i.e., learning of violence experienced by others such as\nfriends of family members. While much is already known about predictors and\nconsequences of primary exposures (Christiansen & Evans, 2005; Esbensen &\nsame cannot be said for secondary exposures that children and adolescents\nexperience in their neighborhoods.\n : Prevalence and Consequences\nStudies indicate that youth experience various types and amounts of secondary\nviolence in their communities. For instance, some studies report that up to\n47 percent of low income Black children to 1 percent of middle to upper class\nWhite children witnessed a murder. Further, studies show that 9 percent to\n54 percent of children have witnessed a stabbing in their life time and that\n4 percent to 70 percent have witnessed a shooting (Fitzpatrick, 1997; Gladstein,\nRusonis, & Heald, 1992). Prevalence estimates of these most studied forms vary\nas a function of who is reporting the exposure (i.e., child self-report vs. paren-\ntal reports of child exposure), sampling characteristics (low income inner city\nyouth vs. middle class Caucasian youth), and measuring instruments (Buka\net al., 2001). Exposure to violence is also cumulative in that children and\nadolescents witnessing any particular act of violence are more likely to witness\ntherefore, making it difficult to isolate exposures with the greatest potential for\nadverse affects on children.\nThere is a growing recognition of the link between secondary violence expo-\nsure and a range of negative behavioral, mental, and physical health outcomes.\nStudies conducted in the last two decades have found that secondary violence\nexperienced during childhood and adolescence is related to increases in\nemotional problems such as anxiety, depression, and post traumatic stress\ndisorder (Fitzpatrick, 1993), aggression and violent behavior (Bell & Jenkins,\nsubstance abuse (Gilvarry, 2000), lack of empathy, decreased academic perfor-\nmance, and heart rate and sleeping disturbances (see Buka et al., 2001). As\nsuch, it is important to appropriately identify and understand the multilayered\nrisks so that adverse consequences can be minimized.\nIndividual-Level Risk Factors\nIt is fair to say that individual characteristics are likely the most studied\ncorrelates of secondary violence exposure. For instance, several demographic\ncharacteristics have been identified that are related to experiencing secondary\nviolence. These factors include gender, race, age, and socioeconomic status\n(SES). In summary, males are more likely than females to be exposed to higher\nlevels of secondary violence (Fitzpatrick & Boldizar, 1993; Selner-O'Hagan\net al., 1998). Blacks are more likely than Whites and Hispanics to experience\nsecondary exposure to violence, and Hispanics are more likely than Whites to\nGenerally, older youth are more likely than younger youth to experience second-\nary exposures to violence (Richters & Marinez, 1993; Selner-O'Hagan et al.,\n1998; but cf. Fitzpatrick & Boldizar, 1993), although some studies do not find a\nrelationship between levels of exposure and age. Youth from lower socioeco-\nnomic backgrounds and those living in poorer neighborhoods compared to their\ncounterparts report the highest rates of secondary violence exposure (Campbell\nhave also been implemented in predicting secondary exposure to violence;\nhowever, these studies are less consistent in their effects (Gorman-Smith &\nTolan, 1998) and some scholars even argue that parenting variables work as\nmoderators instead of having direct effects on exposure (see Buka et al., 2001).\nFor instance, some studies reveal that factors which describe parent-child rela-\ntions such as monitoring, conflict, and involvement do not predict exposure\n(Miller, Wasserman, Neugebauer, Gorman-Smith, & Kamboukos, 1999), while\nothers conclude that parental supervision/monitoring and support can (Gorman-\nbehavioral problems, especially antisocial and delinquent behaviors, put youth\nat an increased risk for experiencing secondary violence (Kuo, Mohler,\nwhether these relationships are causal because both have also been studied as\noutcomes of exposure.\nSeldom has research moved beyond individual factors discussed above when\npredicting secondary exposure to violence among children and adolescents.\nWe believe that factors known to predict involvement in delinquent/criminal\nlifestyles and personal victimization may have implications for explaining\nsecondary exposure to violence. In particular, low self-control increases the\nlikelihood that individuals will engage in delinquency (Pratt & Cullen, 2000),\nbecome victims of violent crime (Schreck, 1999), and select into risky envi-\nronments/situations that have a high likelihood for violence to occur (Schreck\nThose with low self-control have a tendency to prefer instant gratification\nthat brings pleasure and excitement immediately while failing to carefully plan\nand seriously think about the consequences of their actions. According to\nGottfredson and Hirschi (1990), low self-control is due to a lack of parental\nsocialization, disciplining, and monitoring in that parents who do not recognize\nbad behaviors, do not give adequate supervision, and punish erratically and\ninconsistently will encourage their child's impulsive and instantly gratifying\nbehaviors, ultimately resulting in a child lacking self-control. Furthermore, they\nargue that such aversive parenting styles that promote low self-control are more\nlikely to manifest if primary caregivers or parents lack warmth and affection.\nBeyond evidence of the negative consequences related to low self-control\n(Pratt & Cullen, 2000), we argue that a measure of this trait is important to\ninclude when investigating the link between neighborhoods and the etiology of\nsecondary violence exposure for two reasons. First, an argument for a relation-\nship between low self-control and secondary exposure to violence is largely due\nto recent theoretical and empirical work that assesses how and why low self-\ncontrol predicts violent victimization among youth. Several studies have shown\nthat the likelihood of primary exposure to violence (i.e., personal victimization)\nis increased for those possessing low self-control and that such individuals\nare at risk for being victimized over and over again (Schreck, 1999; Stewart,\nElifson, & Sterk, 2004). Those with low self-control may continue to be violently\nvictimized due to the fact that they resist curbing their involvement in risky\nlifestyles (e.g., delinquency, drug use, hanging around delinquent peers) even\nafter they experience primary exposures to violence (Schreck et al., 2006).\nResearch linking low self-control to personal victimization is not too surprising\nbecause those who have low self-control tend to create danger for themselves\nthrough mingling with others who are motivated to offend and often hanging\nout in risky situations that have a high probability of crime and victimization\noccurrences.\nWe believe that evidence linking low self-control to primary exposure to\nviolence is applicable to witnessing and hearing violence. Those with low self-\ncontrol tend to hang out with deviant peers or people who are motivated to offend\nand use drugs (Schreck et al., 2006). Since we know that deviants offend and\nsuffer more victimization, it would naturally follow that those with low self-\ncontrol (compared to high self-control youth) will be likely to have more exposure\nto secondary violence due to the fact that they hang out with individuals who\nexperience more violent victimization. Furthermore, individuals who possess low\nself-control tend to hang out in \"high risk\" settings which may facilitate seeing\nand hearing violence take place even when they are not an active participant.\nSecond, including a measure of low self-control is important when investigat-\ning the effects of neighborhood conditions on witnessing and hearing violence so\nthat selection effects are less problematic. That is, we must take into account\nindividual risk factors that could potentially account for a link between\nstructural and social factors of neighborhoods and secondary violence exposure.\nChildren and adolescents who live in disadvantaged neighborhoods may have\nhigher rates of violence exposure due to the possibility that they, on average,\nhave lower self-control. In an assessment of neighborhood influences on child\nand adolescent development, Wikstr\u00f6m and Sampson (2003) specifically argue\nthat self-control of youth is partially influenced by community socialization and\nthat this impact is due to the level of collective efficacy present in a neighbor-\nhood. Structurally disadvantaged neighborhoods are likely to have lower levels\nof informal controls and residents are less likely to look after kids in a neighbor-\nhood. This is likely related to the frequency in which children experience behav-\nioral settings disadvantageous to the development of self-control. Specifically,\nchildren living in neighborhoods low in child-based collective efficacy are\nexpected to encounter behavioral settings that provide less support and moni-\ntoring of their behaviors. Following the above logic, if self-control is not taken\ninto account we risk mis-specifying a model specifically created to estimate\nneighborhood effects on children and adolescents exposure to secondary\nviolence.\nNeighborhood Influences\nWhile studies have produced somewhat consistent findings on individual risk\nfactors, the same cannot be said for the role of neighborhood variables in\nchildren and adolescents secondary exposure. In fact, Buka and his colleagues\n(2001) recently concluded that neighborhood influences on exposure to\nviolence, compared to family and individual correlates, are poorly understood.\nThe few studies that have assessed community risk factors assess structural\naspects such as poverty rates and racial/ethnic composition of neighborhoods in\nwhich children live (Fitzpatrick & Boldizar, 1993; Selner-O'Hagan et al., 1998).\nThese studies typically find that children living in lower income, urban environ-\nments have higher levels of exposure to secondary violence when compared to\nother children.\nWhile community/neighborhood studies are few, as well as mixed and limited\nmethodologically, scholars continually advocate for a focus on alleviating\ncommunity risk so that consequences of exposure to violence can be reduced.\nFor instance, a recent special issue of the Journal of Clinical Child and Adoles-\ncent Psychology [2004, Vol. 33, No.3] was devoted to children's exposure to\nviolence. As such, several scholars make statements about the importance of\ntargeting communities for intervention and prevention. Sullivan and his\ncolleagues (2004) argue that prevention efforts must be made to reduce\nviolence within communities, while Luther and Goldstein (2004) indicate that\nefforts should focus on the environment rather than the individual who is\nexposed. Further, Luther and Goldstein (2004) argue that social scientists have\na responsibility to improve the environments that pose exposure risk for\nchildren. Unfortunately, as will be discussed, studies that could be used to\nadvocate such approaches have been ill-equipped to disentangle the effects of\nthe community/environment from the individual-level characteristics that could\nput children at risk. Therefore, it is not only important to employ appropriate\ndata and statistical models, but it is also important to identify contextual\nfactors that could be related to exposure to secondary violence.\nIt is well known that neighborhoods are believed to influence the development\nof children and the experiences they are subjected to (Brooks-Gunn, Duncan, &\nto those who study developmental processes, neighborhood influences are part\nof an ecological model in which individuals are viewed in the context of a series\nof environments (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). Focusing on community or neighbor-\nhood conditions does make sense for explaining secondary exposure to violence,\nespecially given the fact that a long line of criminological research has shown\nthat some urban neighborhoods have markedly higher levels of violent crime than\nothers (Sampson et al., 1997; Shaw & McKay, 1942). Social disorganization theory\nand its recent advances have been at the forefront of this discussion. As early as\nthe 1940s, Shaw and McKay found that neighborhoods with high poverty, racial\nand ethnic heterogeneity, and residential mobility had higher crime rates. They\ntheorized that when neighborhoods were fraught with such characteristics the\nlikelihood of bond formation between neighbors would be unlikely, thus limiting\na neighborhood's ability to control crime and disorder. For instance, neighbor-\nhoods with high residential mobility limits the likelihood that local residents will\nget to know each other and discuss neighborhood goals.\nA number of scholars have advanced Shaw and McKay's theory by articulating\nand measuring intervening factors that weaken a neighborhood's ability to control\nSmith & Jarjoura, 1989). Perhaps one of the most important developments of\nintervening mechanisms is the development and measurement of the concept\ncollective efficacy (Sampson et al., 1997). Conceptually, collective efficacy is\ndefined as the expectation on the part of residents that they should contribute\ntoward the common good of their neighborhood. According to Sampson et al.\n(1997), collective efficacy consists of two correlated dimensions. First, it is the\nwillingness of residents to exercise informal social control and intervene for the\ncommon good of the neighborhood (e.g., kids loitering outside while truant, paint-\ning graffiti). Second is social cohesion and trust among local residents where they\ncollectively approve of sentiments such as \"neighbors help each other,\" \"this is\na close knit neighborhood,\" and \"people in this neighborhood generally get along.\"\nStudies have found that neighborhoods high in collective efficacy have less violent\ncrime, children with fewer internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems,\nFurthermore, Sampson and colleagues (1999) identified three components for\ncollective efficacy directed towards children that they suggest will impact devel-\nopment, including intergenerational closure, reciprocal exchange, and social\ncontrol. Intergenerational closure speaks to the closeness of parents and children\nwithin a community, and it is argued that this closeness is important for neigh-\nborhood control of children beyond parental childrearing practices and monitoring\nby providing social support, information to parents, and help in facilitating\ncontrol. Reciprocal exchange is the interaction of families with respect to chil-\ndrearing. Such exchanges can span from advice, material goods, and information\nabout childrearing. Finally, child-centered social control relates to the willingness\nof residents to intervene if neighborhood children are getting into trouble or up\nto no good, beyond intervention by a child's parents (Sampson et al., 1999). Such\nneighborhood phenomenon are not only related to violent crime--those having\nhigher amounts of child-based collective efficacy have less violent crime--but we,\nas well as others (Luther & Goldstein, 2004) believe that they can influence\nsecondary violence exposure among children and adolescents. As such they are\nconsidered protective factors that promote safety and concern for neighborhood\nchildren. Neighborhood social processes such as these may also perhaps mitigate\nResearch on  : What Do We Not Know?\nAfter reviewing studies on secondary exposure to violence among children and\nadolescents there are many things we do not know about who is more likely to\nexperience higher rates of exposures. First, we do not know if and how\nneighborhoods will determine whether children and adolescents are at risk for\nexposure to secondary violence when taking into account individual risk factors.\nStudieshavebeensuccessfulatassessingexposureamongsamplesofyouthresiding\nin one, as opposed to various, neighborhoods. Studies have also been successful\nat making dichotomous comparisons between urban or suburban environments,\nbut they did not compare many youth residing across many diverse neighborhood\ncontexts. Studies designed as such were unable to partition the variance of expo-\nsurebetweenneighborhoodsandindividuals,consequentlyresultinginmodelsthat\ndo not disentangle the differences of exposure between neighborhoods versus\nindividuals. Second, past studies have not assessed whether neighborhood differ-\nences in levels of exposure are due to individual characteristics of the child and/\nor characteristics of the neighborhoods in which they reside. Perhaps children and\nfamilies residing in particular neighborhoods have similar characteristics to one\nanother when compared to their counterparts living in other neighborhoods, thus,\nmaking it difficult to understand if characteristics of the neighborhoods or the\nchildren and their families put them more at risk. Other studies have collected\ndata on national samples and consequently cannot reliably estimate contextual\neffects. Finally, past studies often have not included independent and reliable\nmeasures of neighborhood structural and social processes that may serve as\nmechanisms for increased/decreased exposure to secondary violence.\nThe current study investigates questions regarding secondary exposure to\nviolence that we don't know the answers to yet. That is, (1) does secondary\nexposure to violence for children and adolescents vary by neighborhood context\nand (2) if so, what neighborhood characteristics matter, net of important family\nand child characteristics or do individual characteristics explain contextual\ndifferences?\nMethods\nSample\nThe PHDCN is an interdisciplinary study aimed at advancing scientific knowledge\non the contextual determinates of children's psychological, social, and behavioral\ndevelopment. A multistage sampling strategy was required so that neighborhoods,\nfamilies, and children could be studied simultaneously. Data from the PHDCN are\nparticularly well suited to assess the influence of neighborhood variables on expo-\nsure to violence because of (1) the exhaustiveness of contextual measures created\nfrom these data and validated over time (Sampson et al., 1997), and (2) data have\nbeen collected on several cohorts of children at different stages of development.\nThere are two components to the sampling design: selection of neighborhood\nclusters and dwellings for the longitudinal cohort study. First, 847 census tracts\nwere combined to create 343 neighborhood clusters (NCs). A stratification\nprocedure generated a representative sample of the racial, ethnic, and socio-\neconomic diversity of Chicago neighborhoods and produced a balanced sampling\ndesign. Data on NCs were obtained from several sources including the 1990 US\nCensus used to measure neighborhood structural characteristics, a separate\ncommunity survey measuring neighborhood social processes, and crime data\nfrom incident based records of the Chicago Police Department. From the 343\nNCs, a stratified probability sample of 80 was selected for the longitudinal\ncohort study, resulting in a set of racially/ethnically diverse NCs that spanned a\nrange of socioeconomic stratum.\nSecond, block groups were randomly selected from each of the 80 NCs.\nWithin each sampled block group a list of dwellings was compiled and household\nmembers were enumerated, resulting in over 35,000 dwellings screened.\nInfants, children, and adolescents (including 18 year olds) were recruited to\nparticipate. Subjects were recruited if they were within six months of the\ncohorts that span major developmental milestones. Primary caregivers of\nrespondents were also recruited to participate. Respondents and caregivers\ncohorts who completed wave one and two interviews.3\n3. Response rates for wave one ranged from 71.6 percent to 75.9 percent for the screened eligible\npercent, and 82.7 percent for the 9-, 12-, and 15-year-old cohorts, respectively.\nMeasures\nSecondary exposure to violence\nOur secondary exposure to violence measure is a 9-item index of various violent\nevents that subjects self-reported witnessing or hearing in the past 12 months\nprior to the wave two interviews. Since we are concerned with witnessing and\nhearing violence in neighborhood contexts, our measure is limited to neighbor-\nhood-specific exposures that include: (1) saw someone hit, slapped, punched or\nkicked, (2) saw someone attacked with a weapon, (3) saw someone get shot, (4)\nsaw someone get shot at, (5) heard gunfire, (6) saw accident where someone\nwas hurt, (7) saw someone killed, (8) saw someone threaten to seriously hurt\nanother person, and (9) saw someone get chased. Each question was coded 1 =\nyes or 0 = no. Responses to each question were summed to create a scale ranging\nfrom 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating more secondary exposures to violence\nwithin their neighborhoods. Our measure has a Kuder\u00adRichardson reliability esti-\nStructural neighborhood characteristics\nThree neighborhood structural variables were considered in our analyses (for\nscale items and descriptive statistics see Appendix A and Table 1, respec-\ntively). First, we include a measure of concentrated disadvantage, which\ngenerally reflects the extent of poverty and segregation of a neighborhood.\nConcentrated disadvantage was measured using six items including percent-\nage neighborhood residents below the poverty line, percentage on public\nassistance, percentage of female-headed families, percentage unemployed,\ndensity of children by percentage younger than 18, and percentage Black.\nThis measure has been validated and used in previous studies with the PHDCN\n(see Sampson et al., 1997). It was standardized with increasingly positive\nscores reflecting more concentrated disadvantage. Second, immigrant concen-\ntration was measured by the percent foreign born and the percent Latino\nresidents indicating the concentration of immigrants within neighborhoods.\nScores were standardized with more increasingly positive scores indicating\nmore immigrant concentration. Third, residential stability is a two-item\nmeasure reflecting home ownership and length of residency in neighborhoods.\nMore positive scores on this measure represent more neighborhood residential\nstability (for factor loadings of items in each measure see Sampson et al.,\nAdditionally, a standardized measure of neighborhood violent crime was\ntaken from incident based records of the Chicago Police Department in 1993.\nIt consists of murders, robberies, rapes, and aggravated assaults. Higher\nscores indicate more violent crime, whereas lower scores indicate less violent\ncrime.\nChild-based collective efficacy\nSeveral social organizational variables are included that can be considered protec-\ntive factors for children and adolescents from experiencing secondary violence\nexposure. Specifically, these characteristics include intergenerational closure,\nreciprocal exchange, and child-centered social-control (see Sampson et al., 1999\nfor a more thorough discussion of these measures and their construct validity).\nEach measure was derived from the independent, PHDCN community survey by\naggregating individual scores within each NC to achieve an average for each NC.\nIntergenerational closure is a five-item scale and assesses the closeness of\nparents and children within a community which provides social support for\nchildren, information to parents, and helps in facilitating control. For example,\nitems include whether: \"there are adults in this neighborhood that children can\nlook up to,\" \" Parents in this neighborhood know their children's friends, \" and\n\"You can count on adults in this neighborhood to watch out that children are safe\nand don't get into trouble.\" Items were coded on a likert-type, 5-point scale rang-\ning from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Higher scores on this measure indicate\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics\nVariables M SD\nNeighborhood Level (n = 77)\nNeighborhood Structure\nChild Based Collective Efficacy\nmore intergenerational closure in a neighborhood. Reciprocal exchange is a five-\nitem scale which assesses the interaction of families with respect to childrearing\n(bothparentandchildren),andsuchexchangescanrangefromgivingadvice,mate-\nrial goods, and information about childrearing. For example, items ask: About how\noften do you and people in your neighborhood do favors for each other?\" and \"How\noften do you and other people in this neighborhood visit in each other's homes\nor on the street?\" Items were coded on a 4-point scale and responses ranged from\nnever, rarely, sometimes, or often. NCs with higher scores on this measure reflect\nmore reciprocal exchange within a neighborhood. Child-centered social control\nis a three-item scale which reflects the collective willingness of residents to inter-\nvene on behalf of children in the neighborhood beyond intervention by a child's\nparents. Residents were asked, on a 5-point scale how likely (very unlikely to very\nlikely) that their neighbors would do something if skipping school and hanging out,\nspray painting graffiti, and showing disrespect to an adult. Likewise, NCs with\nhigher scores indicate that they have more child-centered social control.\nFinally, although not a child-based collective efficacy measure, a measure of\nyouth services is included as a neighborhood variable given that researchers recog-\nnize that communities may want to provide after school programs for children and\nadolescences to help reduce exposure (Luther & Goldstein, 2004). This measure\nis an inventory of youth services within neighborhoods that include youth centers,\nrecreational programs, afterschool programs, mentoring and counseling services,\nand crisis intervention. This measure was standardized to reflect the amount of\nyouth services in each NC, with more positive scores indicating more youth services\nand less positive (or increasingly negative scores) indicating less youth services.\nDemographics\nInfluenced by previous research, we chose to include gender, age, race/ethnic-\nity, and socioeconomic status as our individual, demographic characteristics.\nGender was coded as 0 = female or 1 = male. Age was measured continuously with\na set of dichotomous variables where 1 = Black, 1 = Hispanic, and 1 = Other\n(White is the reference group for each category). Socioeconomic status was\nmeasured using the principal component of three variables including household\nincome, maximum education level of primary caregiver and partner, and the\nsocioeconomic index (SEI) for primary caregiver's and partner's jobs. Socioeco-\nnomic status is treated as a continuous variable with higher scores representing\nhigher family socioeconomic status.\nParenting characteristics\nItems from the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME)\nInventory were used to measure parenting characteristics. This inventory was\ngenerally designed to capture the quantity and quality of stimulation in a child's\nhome environment from primary caregivers (Caldwell & Bradley, 1984; Leventhal,\nSelner-O'Hagan, Brooks-Gunn, Bingenheimer, & Earls, 2004). We included three\nparenting variables measured during the wave one in-home interviews that\ninclude: parental warmth, parental supervision/monitoring, and parental lack of\nhostility. Parental warmth is measured using 9-item index derived from inter-\nviewer's observations of parents during the in-home interview, including obser-\nvations such as \"parent voices positive feelings to child,\" \"parent caresses, kisses,\nor hugs child,\" and \"parent responds positively to praise of child.\" Similarly,\nparental lack of hostility consists of an index of four observational items, including\nobservations such as, \"parent does not shout at child during visit\" and \"parent\ndoes not slap or spank child.\" All items, for both measures, were coded 0 = no or\n1 = yes. Responses were summed to create overall scale scores for the parental\nwarmth and lack of hostility measures, with higher scores indicating more\nparental warmth and less hostility. Further, these measures exhibit acceptable\nKuder-Richardson reliabilities of .71. and .70, respectively (see also Leventhal\net al., 2004). Parental supervision is a scale of 13 items where primary caregivers\nself-reported on how they directly and indirectly monitor their children. Specif-\nically, this measure reflects primary caregiver's knowledge of their child's where-\nabouts, familiarity with child's friends, and rules surrounding curfews and\nactivities with friends. Higher scores on this scale indicate more parental super-\nvision. The parental supervision scale exhibits a Cronbach alpha of .50.\nOffending and antisocial propensity\nMeasures of prior offending/delinquency and propensity to engage in antisocial\nbehaviors, i.e., self-control, were administered during the wave one interviews.\nA 19-item variety index of \"yes\" or \"no\" self-reported property and violent\noffending questions are used to measure involvement in crime. Specifically, ques-\ntions asked respondents if they have ever engaged in any of the delinquent and\noffending behaviors. For instance, property offending includes items such as ever\nbroken into a building, stolen from a store, damaged property, and stolen from\na household member. Violent offending includes items such as ever attacked\nsomeone with a weapon, robbed someone, been in a gang fight, thrown objects\nat people, forced sex, and carried a weapon. Past research has shown that delin-\nquent involvement increases the likelihood of secondary exposure to violence\n(Selner-O'Hagan et al., 1998) and also indicates that delinquency, especially\nviolent delinquency, is perhaps an outcome of exposure. Using this measure from\nwave 1 data collection as a predictor of levels of secondary violence, we establish\ntemporal ordering. Youth who are at an increased risk for violent victimization\nwill often live a lifestyle that encompasses criminal and antisocial behaviors.\nAntisocial propensity is measured using a 17-item scale that primary caregivers\nreport on their children's level of self-control during wave 1 interviews.\nSelf-control has been measured in past studies using a variety of attitudinal and\nbehavioral items, but some of the most widely used measures have been attitudinal\nbased (Pratt & Cullen, 2000). Researchers have found that behavioral and attitu-\ndinal measures of self-control perform similarly and that there is little evidence\nthat behavioral measures should be more highly valued (Tittle, Ward, & Grasmick,\n2003). Furthermore, Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990) argue that the validity of self-\nreport, attitudinal questions can be jeopardized because level of self-control can\nimpact how individuals respond; therefore, we feel that a measure taken from\nprimary caregiver reports will not be affected by this potential concern.\nSpecifically, items from the EASI-temperament instrument are used including\nthe following subcomponents: inhibitory control, decision time, sensation seek-\ning, and persistence (see Buss & Plomin, 1975; Gibson, Sullivan, Jones, & Piquero,\n2007). These dimensions are consistent with Gottfredson and Hirschi's conceptu-\nalization of self-control, as well as past self-control measures (see Grasmick,\nInhibitory control reflects the inability to delay gratification and control frus-\ntrations. Examples of items include: trouble controlling impulses, can't stand\nwaiting, and has trouble resisting temptations. Those who possess low self-control\nhave a difficult time controlling their anger and are also likely to live in the \"here\nand now\" and do not think about balancing instant gratification with the potential\nadverse outcomes it may lead to (Gottfredson & Hirschi, 1990). Decision time taps\ninto a child's (in) ability to delay decision-making until other alternatives can be\nseriously considered. For example, such items include: I often say the first thing\nthat comes into my head, often have trouble making up my mind, often times act\non the spur of the moment, and like to make detailed plans before I do something.\nSensation seeking items reflect a preference for novel stimuli and responses and\nthe likelihood of acting on the spur of the moment and such items include: gener-\nally likes to seek new and exciting sensations and experiences, sometimes does\n\"crazy\" things just to be different, and willingness to try anything once. Persis-\ntence is the likelihood that a child will follow through or complete a task. Children\nwith low self-control often may be the first to initiate a task, but also the first\nto abort the task because they find it dull and boring, especially when the task\nis not associated with immediate gratification. Examples of these items include:\ngenerally likes to see things through to the end (reverse coded), tends to give up\neasily, and once started on something hates to stop.\nAll items were on a 4-point, likert-type scale. Responses to items were\nsummed and standardized, where more positive scores reflect lower self-control\nand more negative scores reflect higher self-control. Our self-control scale has a\nCronbach's reliability coefficient of .71.\nAnalytic Procedure\nA Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling (HGLM) strategy is used because\nchildren living in one neighborhood are more similar to each other than to chil-\ndren living in others. Nested data can result in correlated error terms which\nmanifest in biased standard errors in traditional regression. While an HGLM\nallows for correcting of standard errors due to nested observations, it also\nallows estimation of effects for both neighborhood and individual-level variables\nwith minimal statistical bias. Furthermore, it allows estimation of the variance\nin children's secondary exposure to violence between and within neighborhoods\nBecause our outcome variable has a distribution that is a count of secondary\nviolence exposures which is positively skewed and violates the normality\nassumption of a linear model, it is appropriate to treat it as an event or count\nvariable. Thus, we fit a HGLM (poisson model with constant exposure) that uses\na log link function. We estimated a two-level model, with subjects (level 1)\nnested within NCs (level 2). The expected number of exposures to violence in an\nNC, Yij, for subject i in NC j is its event rate, ij, times its exposure, mij; and\nwhere the variance equals the mean. The expected value of Yij can be described\nas: E(Yij|ij) = mij\nij. First, we estimate an unconditional model to assess\nwhether statistically significant variance is present between neighborhoods for\nchildren's exposure. Second, if so, we estimate a model with only individual\ncharacteristics to assess if selection processes account for the significant vari-\nance between neighborhoods. Third, if significant variance between neighbor-\nhoods remains, we include contextual variables, while simultaneously making\nadjustment for individual-level variables to assess the unique contributions of\nneighborhood level characteristics.\nResults\nA considerable number of children report experiencing secondary violence in\ntheir neighborhoods during the year prior to their wave 2 assessments. For\n(10.2 percent) saw someone being attacked, 79 (5.1 percent) saw someone shot,\n(20.2 percent) saw someone chased.\nAs shown in Table 1, of the nine violent acts, the average number witnessed\nis 1.27, with the largest being 9 and the smallest being 0. Regarding demograph-\nics, the average age is 12.07, with the youngest being approximately 8 and the\noldest being approximately 16 years of age. Our sample consisted of 50 percent\nmales and 50 percent females. In addition, 16 percent are White, 34 percent\nBlack, 47 percent Hispanic, and 3 percent are classified as \"other.\"\nTables 2 and 3 present results from multilevel models predicting secondary\nexposure to violence. Table 2 shows an unconditional model that reports the\nvariance across NCs absent of individual or contextual variables. As shown,\nsecondary exposure to violence significantly varies across neighborhoods (00 =\nshows the effects of individual-level variables only; whereas, model 2 includes\nboth individual and neighborhood variables. In model 1, several individual-level,\ndemographic variables were found to be significant predictors of secondary\nviolence. Consistent with past research, males were significantly more likely to\nexperience higher levels of secondary violence exposure than females. Older\nchildren, compared to their younger counterparts, were significantly more\nlikely to experience higher levels of exposure. Relative to the reference group\n(White), the likelihood of exposure was higher for Blacks, but not for Hispanics\nor those in the other category. However, the risk of exposure was no more likely\namong children and adolescents whose parents show a lack of warmth, more\nhostility or less supervision and monitoring than those children whose parents\nshow more warmth, less hostility, or more supervision and monitoring. The role\nof prior offending and delinquency in witnessing violence was highly significant,\nwhere those reporting more delinquent acts at wave 1 were more likely to\nreport higher levels of exposure to secondary violence. Finally, children and\nadolescents with less self-control (i.e., higher scores on the self-control scale)\nwere significantly more likely to experience more exposure to secondary\nviolence than those with more self-control. While our reported individual-level\neffects are supportive of past research, they do not account for all of the vari-\nance in secondary violence shown in Table 2, suggesting that contextual-level\nfactors are possibly important. Specifically, secondary violence exposure still\nbut, nonetheless, the variance between neighborhoods is substantially reduced.\nAs shown in model 2 of Table 3, when neighborhood variables are added the\nindividual-level effects on exposure were maintained. However, none of the\nchild-based collective efficacy measures emerged as statistically significant\npredictors and the violent crime measure was not a significant predictor either.\nIn contrast, both immigrant concentration and concentrated disadvantage were\npositive and statistically significant predictors of exposure, indicating that\nchildren and adolescents living in poorer, segregated neighborhoods and those\nliving in areas with higher concentrations of immigrants were more likely to\nwitness and hear violence, even after adjustments were made for individual-\nlevel factors. Further, youth living in neighborhoods that have more youth\nservices were significantly less likely to be exposed to secondary violence than\ntheir counterparts living in areas with fewer youth services available. Nonethe-\nless, when neighborhood variables are added the variance between NCs\nTable 2 Unconditional Poisson HGLM: Variation in secondary ETV across Chicago\nneighborhoods\nFixed Effect Coefficient SE\nRandom Effect Variance Component df 2\nremained statistically significant, although it was reduced (00 = .061; 2 =\nDiscussion\nOur study builds on previous research generally and with the PHDCN more\nspecifically, resulting in several new and important results that contribute to\nthe understanding of children and adolescents exposure to secondary violence\nin their neighborhoods. First, our study has shown that children's exposure does\nTable 3 Hierarchical generalized linear models (Poisson) predicting secondary ETV (robust\nstandard errors)\nFixed Effect\nNeighborhood Level\nNeighborhood Structure\nChild-Based Collective Efficacy\nIndividual Level\nDemographics\nParenting Characteristics\nAntisocial Propensities\nRandom Effect Variance component Variance component\nsignificantly vary across geographical areas of Chicago and that it cannot be\nfully explained by individual-level risk factors. Second, we find that several\nneighborhood variables have significant effects on exposure above and beyond\nindividual risk factors. Specifically, youth living in poverty stricken areas and\nthose living in areas with higher concentrations of Latino's and foreign born are\nmore likely to witness and hear violence in their neighborhoods. The immigrant\nconcentration effect is particularly interesting given that recent studies from\nthe PHDCN data show that living in an area with more immigrants is a protective\nfactor against children engaging in violence (Sampson et al., 2005).4 Further,\nwe found that youth services in neighborhoods can act as protective factors\nagainst witnessing and hearing violence in that the more youth services in a\nneighborhood the less children are exposed to secondary forms of violence.\nHowever, we must be careful how this relationship is interpreted. Our data\ncannot identify the mechanisms in which youth service facilities are working to\nprotect kids from being exposed. For instance, do such outlets keep youth off\nthe streets, therefore reducing time they have to be exposed to violence? Or,\nare youth service facilities teaching children about the consequential impacts of\nexposure to violence?\nFinally, we found that neighborhood informal social controls and protections\nfor children did not reduce secondary violence exposure. That is, child-based\ncollective efficacy variables did not have statistically significant effects on\nexposure. Children who live in neighborhoods where parents share information,\nmonitor children, etc. are no more likely than children living in dissimilar neigh-\nborhoods to have higher rates of exposure to secondary violence. Although such\nsocial processes within and between neighborhoods have been hypothesized to\nbe related to negative outcomes for children and adolescents, this finding is\nperhaps not so surprising because collective efficacy measures targeting kids\ncould have a larger impact on primary exposure, i.e., personal violent victimiza-\ntion, because such communities can help remove kids from dangerous situations.\nBut, some kids still live in dangerous neighborhoods where violence may not be\nunder control of community members or parents and therefore kids may certainly\nstill hear and witness violent acts. In Anderson's (1999) research on the \"code of\nthe streets\" he discusses how good families and kids, i.e., \"decent families,\" live\nin bad neighborhoods. While parents may have some influence over what their\nchildren become involved in, they may not influence what they see or hear. In\nsum, our findings on neighborhood predictors address several recent charges by\nscholars to target communities in reducing violence exposure and its conse-\nquences (Luther & Goldstein, 2004; Sullivan et al., 2004). Our findings are some-\nwhat consistent with their suggestions in that context does matter, regardless of\n4. Importantly, we should note that violence occurring in neighborhoods did not have a significant\nimpact on whether children were exposed to violence. We originally thought that perhaps this could\nbe due to multicollinearity with other contextual variables, but further diagnostic analyses, e.g.,\ncorrelations and variance inflation factors, indicated that severe multicollinearity was not a\nproblem. All VIFs were below 4, and bivariate correlations were below .7.\nindividual actions, personalities, and demographic characteristics of children and\nadolescents.\nWe have also learned that neighborhood conditions are not the only piece of\nthe violence exposure puzzle and that careful attention should be paid to\ndemographic, behavioral, and personality characteristics of children that\nincrease exposure risk above and beyond neighborhood conditions. Among indi-\nvidual-level risk factors, our analyses support past research that has found\nBlacks, males, and older youth are at highest risk for exposure to secondary\nviolence. Further, our analyses support prior research that indicates those\ninvolved in more offending and delinquent behaviors to be at a higher risk\n(Selner-O'Hagan et al., 1998). Importantly, these effects remain even when\nadjustments are made for the context in which these children and adolescents\nlive.\nFinally, our study finds that a lack of self-control increases the risk of\nwitnessing and hearing violence. This effect is consistent with criminological\nresearch which shows that youth with low self-control are more at risk for\nengaging in delinquency, associating with other delinquent youth, being person-\nally victimized, and putting themselves in high risk situations that could amplify\net al., 2006). This finding suggests that to limit exposure to secondary violence\nand its consequences, intervention efforts should start early to target self-\ncontrol development, as Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990) argue that the develop-\nment of self-control occurs by late childhood and then remains relatively stable\nthroughout the life-course.\nWe should note, too, that somewhat contrary to expectations, parental\nwarmth, parental supervision, and parental lack of hostility were not signifi-\ncantly associated with secondary exposure to violence. This is somewhat\nsurprising given the long line of research indicating that parents have strong and\nrobust effects on their children's behavior. Perhaps exposure to violence is\nlargely outside the influence of parents, and may be more of a function of\nindividual- and neighborhood-level characteristics. The results of the hierarchi-\ncal models definitely support this possibility, but more research is needed to\nexplicate more fully the relationship between exposure and parenting styles.\nAnalysis of the PHDCN data also revealed that a substantial number of\nchildren witnessed and heard acts of serious physical violence. These findings\nshould not be casually glossed over. Exposure to violence has serious deleterious\nconsequences that are carried forward throughout the life course. Youth who\nwitness violence, for example, have higher rates of PTSD, depression, and\ndistress. Just as importantly, however, is that externalizing behaviors and\nengaging in acts of aggression are more common among youths who are exposed\nThe close nexus between exposure to violence and involvement in offend-\ning/antisocial behaviors is of particular importance to crime and delinquency\nprevention efforts. Reducing offending behaviors of youth should lead to a\nconcomitant reduction in secondary violence exposure. In particular, low\nself-control and concentrated disadvantage--two potent risk factors to adoles-\ncent delinquency--emerged as predictors of exposure. Although only specula-\ntive, if these two risk factors could be attenuated, then we would perhaps\nexpect that crime and delinquent involvement should decrease, exposure to\nsecondary violence should decrease, and the emotional well-being of children\nshould increase. Of course the risk factors identified in our research represent\nonly a handful of variables that contribute to the understanding of violence\nexposure. Future researchers needs to expand on our work and begin to map\nout the ways in which other individual-, familial-, and neighborhood-level char-\nacteristics work independently and synergistically to promote exposure to\nsecondary violence.\nWith these findings in mind, it is important to point out the main limitations\nof our research. Perhaps most important is the need to reproduce our results in\ncities other than Chicago to determine whether our findings are generalizable to\nother geographical areas. This largely remains an open-empirical question that\nneeds to be addressed in future research. Even so, we should note that the\nfindings reported in respect to age, race, gender, and offending/delinquency\nmirror those found in other studies (see Buka et al., 2001), indicating that our\nfindings are in alignment with data drawn from other regions.\nFurthermore, our analyses are restricted to only assessing correlates of\nsecondary exposure to violence. Although many studies have identified the\nnegative consequences associated with exposure, limited work has been\nconducted on how neighborhood conditions may moderate or interact with\nthese relationships to further exacerbate the negative impacts of exposures on\nchildren. We view this as a ripe area for future research that has mostly been\nneglected.\nThe mechanisms that can explain the direct relationships between neighbor-\nhood conditions and exposure to violence need further exploration. For\ninstance, we found that concentrated disadvantage is a risk factor for exposure\nand thought that perhaps the intervening mechanisms that could explain this\nlinkage would be child-based collective efficacy. This, however, was not the\ncase. A fruitful line for future research might be to focus on how structural\nconditions of a neighborhood (e.g., level of concentrated disadvantage) may\nstructure behaviors of youth which in turn lead to higher levels of exposure. As\nmentioned earlier, Anderson's (1999) \"code of the streets\" could be helpful in\nunderstanding why children living in neighborhoods with high concentrations of\ndisadvantage are more susceptible to secondary violence exposure. Further-\nmore, research has shown that concentrated immigration has a beneficial effect\non adolescents' violent behavior (Sampson et al., 2005), however, we show the\nopposite for exposure to secondary violence. Therefore, it is important to\ncontinue exploring the mechanisms for why concentrated immigration increases\nexposure for youth.\nNeighborhood specific exposures to secondary violence were under investiga-\ntion herein. Of course exposure can occur in various contexts including, but not\nlimited to, schools. Future investigations should assess multiple contexts and\ndetermine whether (1) children exposed to more secondary violence in their\nneighborhood are also more likely to be exposed at high levels in other contexts\nand (2) if such a correlation exists, whether individual propensities (e.g., low\nself-control) can help explain this relationship. Perhaps youth with extremely\nlow self-control put themselves in high risk environments that increase their\nexposure across all types of contexts, regardless of the conditions of the neigh-\nborhoods in which they live. It seems intuitive to extend our results by pursuing\na more profound assessment of when neighborhoods matter more and when\nthey matter less. This could perhaps be conditioned by individual behaviors and\npropensities.\nWe close by noting that exposure to secondary violence is due to a multifac-\ntorial arrangement of individual attributes and neighborhood characteristics.\nMost of the secondary exposure to violence literature, however, has focused on\ndelineating the individual-level risk factors, leaving neighborhood determinates\nless understood. But as our research indicates, context is important and should\nbe addressed more fully by future researchers. Only by examining the close\ninterconnections between individuals within contexts will we be able to better\nexplain, predict, and ultimately reduce exposure to and minimize the conse-\nquences of secondary exposure to violence.\nReferences\nAnderson, E.
