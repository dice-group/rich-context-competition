The\nevidence is based on a statistical association analysis and a functional analysis of MAOA promoter activity\nusing two human brain-derived cell lines: neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and human glioblastoma 1242-MG. The\nassociation analysis shows that men with a 2R report a level of serious delinquency and violent delinquency\nP \u00bc 0.008 for serious and violent delinquency, respectively) as high as those for participants with the other\nvariants.

Because\nof its ability to catabolize neurotransmitters, MAOA is\nfrequently a candidate gene in the study of psychiatric\ndiseases and behavioral traits. Evidence that implicates the\nMAOA gene in aggressive behavior has come from knock-\nout mouse models and human data. Cases et al4 and Shih\nand Thompson5 developed a line of mice with a targeted\ndisruption of the MAOA gene. They observed an increase in\nthe brain levels of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephr-\nine, and an increase in manifested aggression among men.\nBrunner et al6 reported mental retardation and impulsive\naggression among eight men in an extended Dutch family\nwith an uncommon sex-specific point mutation in the\nMAOA gene.\nThe MAOA genomic sequences and promoters7 \u00ad 9 were\nstudied extensively in search of polymorphisms that might\n*Correspondence: Professor G Guo, Department of Sociology, Carolina\nCenter for Genome Sciences, Carolina Population Center, University of\nE-mail: guang_guo@unc.edu\nwww.nature.com/ejhg\nbe potentially associated with psychiatric disorders and\nbehavioral traits. These basic studies led to a discovery of a\n30-bp promoter region VNTR in MAOA, affecting level of\ntranscriptional activity by Sabol et al.10 The PCR product\nusually consists of five possible fragment sizes that include\nrepeats are much more common than the 2, 3.5, and 5\nrepeats in human populations. Sabol et al10 showed that\nsequence are transcripted more efficiently than alleles with\n3 (3R) or 5 (5R) copies of the repeat. Sabol and colleagues\ndid not examine the MAOA 2R.\nCaspi et al11 did not find a main effect of MAOA variants,\nbut reported that maltreated male children in New Zealand\nwith the 3R or 5R of the VNTR in MAOA were more likely to\nengage in violent behavior than maltreated children with\nthe 3.5R or 4R of the VNTR. Widom and Brzustowicz12\nreported a replication of these results. Haberstick et al13\nfailed to replicate the gene\u00adenvironment interaction\nfindings in this same Add Health data set used in this\nstudy. The present study focuses on the main effects of\nMAOA variants. Meyer-Lindenberg et al14 studied the\nimpact of the MAOA VNTR on brain structure and function\nwith MRI in a large sample of healthy human volunteers.\nThe study showed that the low expression variants predict\ndifferences in the size of limbic structures such as the\namygdala and that men with the low expression variants\nexhibited increased reactivity of the left amygdale and\nhippocampus during the recall of aversive information.\nThe objective of this study is twofold. The First, to\ninvestigate the association between the self-reported\nserious and violent delinquency and the 30-bp VNTR in\nthe MAOA gene in a cohort of 2524 adolescents and young\nadults in the United States in the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The specific\nhypothesis is that the MAOA 2R is associated with higher\nlevels of delinquency. Second, to perform a functional\nanalysis that evaluates the promoter activity in an MAOA\n1.3-kb promoter-luciferase construct containing 2-, 3-, and\n4-repeat sequences of the 30-bp VNTR, using two human\nbrain-derived cell lines: neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and hu-\nMaterials and methods\nSubject\nThe data source for our analysis is the sibling subsample of\n2524 participants in the National Longitudinal Study of\nAdolescent Health (Add Health), which started as a\nnationally representative sample of more than 20 000\nUnited States.15 Add Health is longitudinal; the respon-\ndents have been followed by two additional in-home\nIII). Add Health was stratified by region, ethnic mix, size,\nurbanicity (urban/suburban/rural), and school type (pub-\nlic/private/parochial). Our analysis uses the sibling sample\nof Add Health because DNA measures collected at Wave III\nin 2002 are available only for this subset of the Add Health\nrespondents. Table 1 provides the mean (SD), proportion,\nand frequency of the sample characteristics.\nMeasures\nWe constructed a serious delinquency scale and a violent\ndelinquency scale using the 12 questions asked to all the\nAdd Health respondents at Waves I\u00adIII. The questions and\nscaling weights used to create the scales are given in\nAppendix 1. These two scales are variations of a widely\nused type of scales in contemporary research on delin-\nquency and criminal behavior.16 Our scales are closely\nrelated to the scales used by, for example, Hagan and\nand by Hannon20 in the analysis of data from the National\nLongitudinal Study of Youth. Our serious delinquency scale\noverlaps with the delinquency scale of Hagan and Foster17\nto a substantial extent. As the descriptor suggests, our\nviolent delinquency scale focuses on an array of violent\ndelinquent behavior that could potentially be classified as\nviolent offenses by the criminal justice system.\nTable 1 Mean (SD), proportion, or frequency of\nsample characteristics\nMales Females\nSerious delinquency\nViolent delinquency\nGenotype\nEthnicity\nAge (mean; in years)\nSibling type\nVNTR 2 repeat in MAOA and delinquent behavior\nG Guo et al\nEuropean Journal of Human Genetics\nFollowing the delinquency literature,17 \u00ad 19 we divided\nthe 12 items into the nonviolent and violent types. The\nnonviolent delinquency includes stealing amounts larger\nor smaller than $50, breaking and entering, and drug\nselling. Violent delinquency includes serious physical\nfighting that resulted in injuries needing medical treat-\nment, use of weapons to get something from someone,\ninvolvement of physical fighting between groups, shooting\nor stabbing someone, deliberately damaging property, and\npulling a knife or gun on someone. The serious delin-\nquency scale (nonviolent and violent) is based on the\nentire 12 items and the violent scale is based on a subset (8)\nof the 12 items. The Cronbach's a-values for the serious\ndelinquency scale for Waves I, II, and III are 0.81, 0.79, and\n0.73, respectively. For Waves I, II, and III, the Cronbach's a -\nvalues for the violent delinquency scale are 0.75, 0.74, and\nMeasuring delinquency and crime is challenging. Offi-\ncial measures based on the police reports and the justice\nsystem have been long known to substantially under-\nmeasures reflect not only the behavior of offenders, but\nalso the decisions made by the justice system. For these\nreasons, many criminologists have turned to self-reports in\nrecent decades.24,25 Self-reports are now a fundamental\nmethod of measuring criminality and seem capable of\nyielding reliable and valid data.16\nAs with any survey of sensitive private information,\nreporting accuracy is a concern. To protect confidentiality,\nreduce nonresponses, and increase reporting accuracy, this\nsection of the interview in Add Health was self-adminis-\ntered by audio-CASI (computer-assisted self-interview). The\nsensitive question was read to respondents by means of\naudio headphones. Respondents were given instructions by\nthe computer on how to complete their answers. Self-\nreported rates of illegal and embarrassing behavior are\nhigher when computer-assisted techniques, particularly\nself-administered techniques, are used.26,27\nDNA preparation and genotyping\nAt Wave III, in collaboration with the Institute for\nBehavioral Genetics in Boulder (CO, USA), Add Health\ncollected, extracted, and quantified DNA samples from the\nsibling subsample. Genomic DNA was isolated from buccal\ncells using a modification of published methods.28 \u00ad 31 All\nof the methods employed Applied Biosystems instruments\nand reagents. Microsatellite and VNTR polymorphisms\nwere performed using fluorescent primers that were\nanalyzed on an ABI capillary electrophoresis instrument.\nTo reduce errors, two individuals independently scored all\ngenotyping. The additional details on DNA collection and\ngenotyping can be found at Add Health website (Smolen\nand Hewitt, http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/).\nThe MAOA-uVNTR polymorphism was assayed by a\nmodified method.10,13 The primer sequences for the\n30-bp VNTR in the promoter region of the MAOA open\nreading frame were: forward, 50ACAGCCTGACCGTGG\nAGAAG-30 (fluorescently labeled); and reverse, 50-GAACGTG\nACGCTCCATTCGGA-30.10 The reaction yielded five frag-\n3, 3.5, 4, and 5 repeats, respectively). This analysis focuses\non the effect of 2R (291) vs all the other alleles. Only 11 men\npossess a 2R. These 11 individuals are from 11 families with\nsix from six pairs of DZ twins and five from another five\nfamilies of full siblings. Of 31 women who possess one or\ntwo 2R alleles, six are from three pairs of MZ twins, three\nfrom three pairs of DZ twins, and 22 from 19 families of full\nsiblings. We performed a Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilibrium test\nfor the 2R allele among women and obtained a w2-value of\n0.012 for one degree of freedom indicating that the\nequilibrium is not violated.\nAnalytical strategies\nTo test the associations of the MAOA 30-bp VNTR\npolymorphisms with serious and violent delinquency, we\nfollowed a three-step analytical strategy. The first step is a\ncontingency table analysis in which the mean scores of\nserious delinquency and violent delinquency across geno-\ntypes were compared within each Add Health Wave and\ngender (Add Health Waves refer to the initial Add Health\nThe second step is regression analysis. Our sample\nconsists of twins and siblings as well as the repeated\nobservations of the same individual over different Add\nHealth Waves; these observations are not independent. The\nmixed model has long been established in the statistical\nliterature for the analysis of data that are not indepen-\ndent.32,33 The following equation describes the basic\nstructure of the mixed models used in our analysis\nDelinquencyjit\u00f0s\u00de\ngenotypeji\nagejit\njit\ngenderji\nethnicityji\n\u00fe vji\n\u00fe ejit\u00f0s\u00de\nwhere j, i, and t index sibling pair or cluster, individual, and\nAdd Health Waves, respectively; s \u00bc m, d, or f indicates\nwhether the sibling cluster or pair are MZ twins, DZ twins,\nor full biological siblings. The basic trajectory of serious\nand violent delinquency is described by age and age2, and\ntheir parameters. The model allows the random effect at\nthe sibling cluster level and the level of observations to\nvary by type of sibling cluster because the strength of the\ncorrelation in these types of sibling clusters varies con-\nsiderably. Conditional on the three random intercepts at\nthe level of sibling clusters and one random intercept at the\nindividual level, the siblings and repeated measures\nare assumed to be independent. The models are estimated\nby SAS.\nVNTR 2 repeat in MAOA and delinquent behavior\nG Guo et al\nEuropean Journal of Human Genetics\nIn our third step, we used two strategies to address the\npotential impact of population structure. First, we adjusted\nfor self-reported race/ethnicity in all regression analysis.\nTang et al34 showed a near-perfect correspondence between\nthe four self-reported ethnic categories (European Amer-\nicans, African Americans, East Asians, and Hispanics) and\nthe categories determined by 326 microsatellite markers.\nAs a second strategy, we applied the procedure by Allison\net al35 to test for possible population stratification.\nFollowing the idea used in the development of sibship\ntests of linkage and association,36 \u00ad 38 Allison et al reasoned\nthat the probabilities of genotypes of siblings depended\nentirely on parental genotypes and that controlling for the\neffects of sibship would be equivalent to controlling for\nparental genotypes. Indexing sibships by j, individuals by\nk, and genotypes by i, they proposed a procedure that can\nbe written as a mixed model\nYijk\n\u00bc m \u00fe ai\n\u00fe bj\n\u00fe \u00f0ab\u00de\nij\n\u00fe eijk\nwhere ai\n, or the effect of genotype i, is assumed to be fixed;\nbj\n, or the effect of sibship j, is assumed to be random; and\n(ab)ij\nis an interaction term specifying the dependence of\nthe random effect of sibship on genotype. This model is a\nFunctional analysis of promoter activity\nThe analysis of promoter activity was based upon two\nhuman brain-derived cell lines: neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y\npromoter-luciferase construct was generated by PCR using\nan MAOA 2-kb luciferase reporter gene construct (contain-\ning 4.5 repeat) as a template. The PCR product (MluI/\ncloned into the polylinker site (MluI/HindIII) upstream of\nthe luciferase gene in the pGL2-Basic vector. Site-directed\nmutagenesis was utilized to generate 4, 3, and 2 repeats,\nrespectively, using the MAOA 1.3-kb promoter-luciferase\nconstruct as a template (Figure 1). The three primers used\nfor mutagenesis of VNTR sites were the following (deleted\nnucleotides are underlined and in lowercase): 50- GCACCA\nrepeat sequence; deleted 15-bp nucleotides using MAOA\n1.3-kb promoter-luciferase construct containing 4.5-repeat\nsequence as a template); 50-GCACCAGTACCCGCACCAG\nTaccggcaccggcaccagtacccgcaccagtGAGCGCAAGGCGGAGG\nsequence; deleted a 30-bp nucleotides using MAOA 1.3-kb\npromoter-luciferase construct containing 4-repeat se-\nquence as a template); and 50-GCACCAGTACCCGCACCA\nGTaccggcaccggcaccagtacccgcaccagtGAGCGCAAGGCGGAG\nrepeat sequence; deleted another 30-bp nucleotides using\nMAOA 1.3-kb promoter-luciferase construct containing 3-\nrepeat sequence as a template).\nThe mutated nucleotide sequences of all mutant con-\nstructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfections\nLipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were plated at a\ndensity of 5 \u00c2 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. In the\nfollowing day, 0.5 mg MAOA promoter-luciferase construct\n(for one well) was co-transfected with 20 ng of plasmid\npRL-TK (the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase\npromoter fused upstream to the Renilla luciferase gene,\nwhich is used as an internal control; Promega) into the\ncells as described previously. Controls were the pGL2-basic\nluciferase reporter gene vector instead of MAOA promoter-\nluciferase construct. After 24 h, cells were harvested with\nluciferase assay lysis buffer (Promega). The cell lysates were\nassayed for luciferase activity using the Promega Dual\nLuciferase Assay system.\nResults\nContingency table analysis\nTable 2 compares the mean score of serious and violent\ndelinquency across genotypes within each gender and each\nof the three Add Health Waves. The number of observa-\ntions and the standard deviation are also given for each\nmean score in parentheses. The declining trend of both\nserious and violent delinquency over the Waves is a\nreflection of the well-known age pattern of delinquent\nand criminal behavior. For men, the genetic variants on the\nsingle X chromosome are grouped into three categories\nand 3.5R or 4R. The most striking result for men is the\nmuch higher scores of those with a 2R allele than those in\nthe other two categories. The much higher score for 2R\nholds for both serious and violent delinquency and is\npresent at all Waves of Add Health. In contrast, the\ndelinquency scores of those with 3R or 5R do not seem to\ndiffer systematically from individuals with the 3.5R or 4R.\nThe delinquency score for 2R tends to be twice as high as\nthose in the other two genotype categories.

The female participants were classified into\nthree genotype categories: Any2R, those with only 3R or\n5R, and those with 3.5R or 4R. For women in Table 2, the\n2R stands out being associated with much higher scores for\nboth serious and violent delinquency at Waves II and III.\nThe serious and violent delinquency scores for the other\ntwo genotype categories do not seem to differ from one\nanother.\nBecause of the sibling clustering in the data, standard\nsignificance tests are not valid for these comparisons. The\nnext section presents significance tests for the genotype\neffects obtained from the mixed regression models that\ntake the correlations into consideration. These exploratory\nresults suggest that the genotype effects may be relatively\nconstant over ages in adolescence and young adulthood, or\nthe trajectories of delinquency across genotypes appear to\nbe parallel over the age range.\nRegression analysis\nThe regression analysis compares serious and violent\ndelinquency scores between the 2R genotype and all the\nother genotypes within each gender after adjusting for the\neffects of age and self-reported race/ethnicity (Table 3).

For men, the 2R genotype scored 1.72\n(P \u00bc 0.025) points higher than the other genotypes on the\nserious delinquency scale. For the violent delinquency\npoints higher than the other genotypes. Figure 2 plots the\nmodel-predicted serious delinquency over age for those\naverage scored about twice as high as the non-2Rs. The\neffects of 2R for violent delinquency are similar to those in\nFigure 1 and the data not presented. Using 3.5R or 4R as the\nreference category in a reestimated regression model shows\nthat the 3R or 5R genotype does not differ from the 3.5R or\n4R genotype.\nThe female effect of Any2R genotype is similar to the\nmale effect. Women with the Any2R genotype scored 0.47\nother genotypes on the serious and violent delinquency\nscales, respectively. These regression coefficients represent\na large increase in the serious and violent delinquency\nscores among women.\nTo address potential bias from population stratification,\nwe controlled for self-reported race/ethnicity in all regres-\nsion models presented in Table 3. In addition, we\nperformed the procedure of Allison et al4 (Equation (2))\nThe model includes one random effect (bj\n) at the sibling-\ncluster level, a second random effect at the individual level\n(eijk\n), and the key interaction term [(ab)ij\n] between\ngenotype and the random effect at the sibling-cluster level.\nIn all Allison's models we have estimated, the random\ninteraction term is not significant indicating that within-\nfamily effects may not be sufficiently influential to\ngenerate population stratification.\nPromoter activity\nTo test whether the statistical link between the MAOA\nVNTR 2R and delinquency has a biochemical basis, we\ncarried out an analysis of MAOA promoter activity by\ngenotype. As shown in Figure 3, the transient transfection\nand luciferase assay reveals three levels of promoter activity\nfor the three 30-bp nucleotide repeat sequences in MAOA\na higher level of promoter activity than the 3R sequence.\nAlleles with the 3.5R or 4R sequence had been previously\nshown to transcribe more efficiently than those with the\n3R or 5R sequence.10 Our finding is that the 2R sequence of\nthe MAOA promoter displayed the lowest level of promoter\n+ pGL2 Basic\n+ MAO A promoter\nMAO A Promoter 1.3 kb\nLuc\nLuc\nLuc\nFigure 3 Relative luciferase activity.

Data were the mean\u00b1SD from three independent\nexperiments with triplicates for each experiment. The six t-tests (three for each cell) between 2 and 3 repeats, 2 and 4 repeats, and 3 and 4 repeats are\nall highly significant (t46).\nSerious Deliquency\nAge\nFigure 2 Projected MAOA 2R and non-2R serious delinquency by\nage.\nVNTR 2 repeat in MAOA and delinquent behavior\nG Guo et al\nEuropean Journal of Human Genetics\nactivity. In both SH-SY5Y and 1242-MG cells, the level of\npromoter activity for the 2R sequence is substantially lower\nthan that of the 3R and only a fraction of that for 4R. The\nextremely low level of promoter activity in the 2R sequence\ncorresponds to the much heightened level of serious and\nviolent delinquency for the 2R genotype.\nWe performed a series of t-tests between the 2R, 3R, 4R,\nand the controls (pGL2-Basic) and among 2R, 3R, and 4R\n(3R vs 2R, 4R vs 2R, and 3R vs 4R). All the t-tests are highly\nsignificant, with t-ratios reaching 10 or above in most\ncases. The smallest t-ratio is 6.\nDiscussion\nGenetic studies of serious delinquent and criminal beha-\nvior in non-patient or general human populations are rare.\nCaspi et al11 reported an interaction between maltreatment\nin childhood and level of MAOA activity for violent\nbehavioral problems; they did not find a main effect of\nthe MAOA gene. Chen et al39 hypothesized the association\nof aggressive behavior in adolescents with both the\ndopamine D2 receptor gene and the dopamine transporter\ngene. They provided suggestive evidence from a small\nstudy of 11 adolescents diagnosed to have impulsive\u00ad\naggressive violent behavior. Guo et al40 reported the main\neffects of the TaqI polymorphism in the DRD2 gene and the\n40-bp VNTR in the DAT1 gene on serious and violent\ndelinquency among men in the same Add Health data.\nThe present study demonstrated a link between the 2\nrepeat of the 30-bp VNTR in the MAOA gene and much\nhigher levels of self-reported serious and violent delin-\nquency. The finding is supported by a statistical association\nanalysis and a functional analysis of MAOA promoter\nactivity. The association analysis showed that men with a\n2R reported a level of serious delinquency in adolescence\nand young adulthood that were at least twice as high as\nthat for those with the other variants in the VNTR. A very\nsimilar finding was obtained for violent delinquency for\nmen. Women with Any2R also reported much higher levels\nof serious and violent delinquency than those with other\nrepeats, although the P-values associated with these\nIn the functional analysis, the 2 repeat exhibited the\nlowest level of promoter activity, that is, 25\u00ad30% of the\npromoter activity exhibited by the 4 repeat. The level of\npromoter activity for the 3 repeat is located between the 2\nand 4 repeats, which is consistent with the previous\nreport.10 The excessively low promoter activity of the 2R\nsuggests a biochemical basis for the excessively high levels\nof serious and violent delinquency.\nAlthough the promoter activity differs significantly\nbetween 3R and 4R, we did not find a significant difference\nin serious and violent delinquency between those posses-\nsing 3R and those possessing 4R. This result is not\ninconsistent with the findings reported by Caspi et al,11\nwho found a higher level of violent behavior for 3R (and\n5R) than 4R (and 3.5R) only among men who were\nmaltreated in childhood. Kim-Cohen et al41 reported a\nmain effect of 3R against 4R as well as an interaction effect\nin a sample of 7-year old Caucasian boys born in England\nand Wales.\nAlthough our sample is large, the 2 repeat is rare.\nThough the findings concerning 2R for men have passed\nthe standard tests of significance in spite of the small\ncategory of 2R, it is possible that some of our findings\ncould be attributable to chance. For this reason, it is\nimportant that these findings are replicated in a much\nlarger population-based study. Future replications may\nprove the importance of the 2R allele, but the allele\ncannot possibly be involved in most delinquent behavior\nbecause of its rarity, just like the rare mutation in the\nMAOA gene the Dutch family6 cannot explain most of the\ndelinquency.\nThe weaker results for women could be due to the\nambiguity in defining the X-linked MAOA VNTR genotypes\nfor women, which is equivalent to measurement errors.\nThe Any2R category used in the present study may include\nthose whose 2 repeat is not fully active. A test of this\nhypothesis requires a much larger sample that contains a\nsufficient number of participants homozygous for the 2\nrepeat.\nOur measures of serious and violent delinquency are\nconstructed in the tradition of research on delinquency\nand crime. Serious delinquency measures the overall\ndelinquency including violent delinquency, but it does\nnot include acts more typically viewed as common\nadolescent deviance such as lying to parents/guardians\nabout where they had been, minor vandalism, being loud\nin a public place, and driving a car without its owner's\npermission. Violent delinquency measures violent\nbehavior that is typically treated as violent offense by\nthe criminal justice system. Our findings suggest that the\nMAOA*2R may be more predictive of violent delinquency\nthan nonviolent delinquency. Future work should test this\nhypothesis explicitly using nonviolent and violent\ndelinquency measures.\n"
