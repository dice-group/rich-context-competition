These datasets provide\nindividual-level health-related measures in a large and representative sample of the United States\ndisease-related factors, such as diabetes and obesity (e.g., refs 1\u00ad3), drug use4, and present reference\nintervals for child growth, such as head circumference. These data have helped to shape public health\npolicy. For example, these data were used to demonstrate the effect of removal of lead from gasoline\n(a gross decrease since legislation). Many have used these data to create hypotheses regarding associations\nbetween biomarkers of environmental chemical factors and disease, such as diabetes and heart disease. We\nhave used these data to perform the first `environment-wide association studies' (EWAS)5, linking >250\nenvironmental biomarkers with disease phenotypes, such as diabetes6,7, self-reported preterm birth8,\nserum cholesterol levels9, blood pressure10, all-cause mortality11, telomere length12, and income13.\nThe NHANES is a CDC program that began in the 1960 s and in the current day, bi-annually samples\n15 counties of United States population (N ~ 5 K per year). Each year, the counties that are sampled\nchange, ensuring a representative and diverse sampling. Specifically, NHANES uses a multistage and\n`probability' sampling design. To provide reliable statistics, the NHANES `over-samples' persons 60 and\nolder, African Americans, and Hispanics and analysts.\nThe NHANES is designed to estimate major disease prevalence, such as diabetes, obesity, and\ncardiovascular disease in the United States. It is one of the only studies that combines simultaneously\nassessed self-reported questionnaires and physical measurements. Self-reported instruments include\ndietary questionnaires the estimate nutrient content of foods consumed around the time of survey and\nhealth and disease-related questionnaire. Second, the NHANES contains phenotypes such as blood\npressure, pulse rate, respiratory capacity, height, weight, and tooth count in an effort to estimate the range\nand prevalence of these phenotypic measures. They are not used for medical diagnoses for the\nparticipants.\nThe exposome has been touted as the comprehensive battery of environmental exposures encountered\nin humans14. The CDC NHANES is one of the first population survey programs to have exposome\nmeasurements. The CDC samples urine, blood, and other human tissue to measure environmental\nexposure indicators of the exposome using gold standard mass spectrometry and immunological assays.\nEnvironmental exposure assays include, for example, lead, mercury, arsenic, pesticide metabolites, air\npollution indicators, and plasticizing agents, all hypothesized to have some relationship with health. The\nNHANES has been instrumental in providing what and how many environmental chemicals are found in\nhuman tissue (e.g., ref. 15). Clinical and physiological phenotypes of the phenome include cholesterol\n(e.g., HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides), glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein (CRP), white\nblood counts, and other blood or urine based measures. All of the measures are taken simultaneously.\nThe NHANES raw datasets for surveys currently exist in >250 number of separate proprietary\nSAS-formatted files (e.g.: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/1999-2000/DEMO.XPT). Description of\neach variable (e.g., a human-readable variable name and units of measurement) exist in a separate\ntable embedded in an.html webpage (e.g.: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/variablelist.aspx?\nComponent = Demographics). All technical information about each variable, such as way it was\nmeasured, are also available on the NHANES website as a.html page. The NHANES has variables of\nmany types, including biomarkers of environmental exposures, clinical markers, physiological measures,\nquestionnaire items, that are continuous or categorical. Next, the NHANES consists of multiple `survey\nOur data resource allows investigators move beyond examining a handful of variables to one that\ntakes advantage of the multiple variables across a number of NHANES survey waves (e.g., akin\nto refs 11,16,17). Second, our data resource allows for quick evaluation of hypotheses before executing a\nformal scientific investigation. We are offering this integrated resource ready to analyze for free of cost,\nleveraging our previous experience.\nWe also offer a way to access the dataset programmatically through an `application programming\ninterface' (API). We utilize i2b2/tranSMART, a data repository software platform used to implement\nBD2K Patient Information Commons-Standardized Unification of Research Elements (PIC-SURE) (http://\npic-sure.org). The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) open-source software was\ndeveloped to provide a federated informatics infrastructure to house/store, maintain, and analyze cohort\ndata emerging from population-level datasets from around the nation for the purpose of driving\nbiological discovery18\u00ad20. i2b2 enables the cohesive analysis of heterogeneous phenotypic data.\ntranSMART is an open-sourced `application layer' for i2b2 (refs 21,22), providing a software add-ons\nto i2b2 for user interfaces, data mapping, and loading cohort data. This software provides a means to\nassemble, query, and analyze disparate and heterogeneous cohort datasets, such as the NHANES. The\nPIC-SURE software technology provides an accessible representation of NHANES, facilitating ad hoc\nquerying of the health measures of the US while providing an application programming interface (API)\nfor consumption by external applications and scripts, such as statistical tools such as R.\nIn this data descriptor, we provide (1) a data descriptor for unified raw NHANES data, (2) sample\nstarter analytic code, analytic compute environment in a Docker container, and guide to conduct analysis\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\nwith the NHANES data, and (3) introduce the PIC-SURE enabled web application to browse and\ndownload the data through an `application programming interface' (API). Further, we have provided a\nWe emphasize our data descriptor is an introduction for use of the NHANES dataset and that all\nanalyses must be verified with data from CDC/NHANES directly. Furthermore, we also emphasize that\nthe derived variables we include were suitable for our own analyses of NHANES and may not be suitable\nfor hypotheses specific to other investigators. Therefore, we include all raw variables in our integrated\ndataset for investigators.\nMethods\nNational Health and  s (NHANES) data\nNHANES datasets are publicly accessible through the United States Centers of Disease Control and\nPrevention (US CDC)23\u00ad26. All NHANES participants have consented for their information to be used in\nresearch.\nFigure 1 shows our procedure. We downloaded 255 total data files, encoded in proprietary SAS `.xpt'\nCDC website in January 2014. We chose to focus on these surveys as they had the greatest number of\nvariables available at the time of download. We will make future instances of merged NHANES available\nvia DataDryad with additional Data Descriptors.\nEach participant of the NHANES has a unique identifier; in other words, there is no overlap in\ncontain information on 41,474 distinct individuals representative of the United States population and\nEach.xpt formatted data file consists of information structured in a `N \u00d7 M' form, in which N number\nof individuals make up every row and M number of columns of variables for each individual (Fig. 1a,b) and\na participant identifier (called `SEQN'), the primary key that joins the data files together (shown as a gray\ncolumn, Fig. 1a). The CDC/NHANES have binned each file in 4 separate `modules' that corresponded to\n(1) whether they contain demographic information (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, survey characteristics,\nincome [Fig. 1a, red folder]), (2) laboratory measures (e.g., biomarker measurements assayed in biological\ntissue, such as serum or urine, depicted in orange [Fig. 1a, orange folder]), (3) physical examination\n(e.g., measurements such as body mass index, weight, height; [Fig. 1a, green folder]), or questionnaire\n(e.g., food-frequency questionnaire or health status questionnaire [Fig. 1a, blue folder]). Each of these\ncategories, or `modules', are called Demographics, Laboratory, Examination, and/or Questionnaire\nmodules respectively.\nIn total, we downloaded 4 Demographics data files, 163 Laboratory data files, 19 Examination files,\nand 69 Questionnaire data files. Fig. 1b and Table 1 depicts the total files for each NHANES module for\nAfter downloading all 255.xpt files, we executed a number of data processing steps. First, all.xpt files\nwere converted into.csv files using using the `foreign' R package27, preserving the original `N \u00d7 M' form of\nthe data. Next, we created some derived variables to ease potential downstream analyses, including\n(1) occupation (1 variable), (2) chronic disease (40 variables), and (3) pharmaceutical drug use\nWe coded occupation as variables that correspond to (1) white-collar and professional jobs that are\ncoded as white-collar and semi-routine (e.g., technicians), blue-collar and high-skill (e.g., mechanics,\nconstruction trades, and military), blue-collar and semi-routine (e.g., personal services, farm workers) as\npreviously described in our previous EWAS28. Labor force participation was defined as working at a job\nor business or having a job or business within the last two weeks, not including work around the house.\nWe defined presence of 6 types of chronic diseases, including diabetes (1 variable), coronary disease\n(1 variable), hypertension (1 variable), asthma (1 variable), rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and\n30 site-specific cancers. We coded diabetes as present (as an integer 1) if the participant had a fasting\nblood glucose greater than 125 mg/dl (as per American Diabetes Association [ADA]) threshold for\ndiabetes diagnosis or if the participant answered `yes' to the question, `Other than during pregnancy, have\nyou ever been told by a doctor or health professional that {you have/{he/she/SP} has} diabetes or sugar\ndiabetes?'. If the participant did not have both of those characteristics, he/she were coded as 0 (ref. 29).\nSimilarly, we defined presence of hypertension as 1 if the participant had a systolic over diastolic blood\npressure greater than 130 over 90 or answered `yes' to the question, `Have you ever been told by a doctor\nor other health professional that you had hypertension, also called high blood pressure' and 0 otherwise.\nWe defined presence of coronary disease as 1 if the participant answered `yes' to the question, `Has a\ndoctor or other health professional ever told you that you had coronary (kor-o-nare-ee) heart disease?'\nand 0 otherwise. The NHANES also contains coding for site-specific cancers. First, participants were\nasked whether a doctor has `ever told you you have cancer?'. If the participant replies yes to a question,\na followup question is administered, `what type of cancer do you have' and the participant can answer\nfrom a set of 27 cancers, such as breast, skin, lung, colon, bladder, kidney, and other type of cancers. We\nturned these into 27 separate variables that are coded 1 if the site-specific cancer is present, 0 otherwise.\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\nThird, we extracted pharmaceutical drug use for each participant. The CDC used a Master Drug\nDatabase (MDDB), a proprietary but comprehensive database of all prescription and some\nnonprescription drug products available in the U.S. drug market. The CDC NHANES interviewer asked\nparticipants whether they were taking a drug in the past month, and if they were, what drugs they were\ntaking. The CDC NHANES interviewer matched each drug to an MDDB identifier and drug description\n(e.g., METFORMIN or ALBUTEROL). Second, the CDC NHANES interviewer--if the interview was\nFigure 1. Methods overview for creating the unified NHANES dataset.

Participant identifiers to\nmerge data files across modules are depicted as gray colums. (b) File number breakdown by survey year and\nmodule. (c) We processed the data to create new variables, added pharmaceutical drug information, and added\nmortality information. (d) We merged all 255 files by the patient identifier to create a large unified table\n(`MainTable') consisting of 41 K participants and 1191 unique variables. (e) We created a data dictionary that\ncontains human readable variable descriptions and other meta-data, such as variable category and the levels of\nthe variable if categorical.

Each\nrespectively. To keep the merged data table (Fig. 1d) of tractable size, we chose to focus on the top 100\ndrugs that were most prevalent in the population. We coded a participant was on a drug if (1) they\nreported use of a drug and (2) whether the interviewer verified the container was present.\nThe CDC also ascertained cause and time of death (mortality) information for a subset of the\nparticipants in 2006 by linking eligible participants to the National Death Index. We incorporated this\ndata into our data merge (n = 11,429 participants). The variables that describe the mortality information\ninclude ELIGSTAT (whether the person was eligible for death linkage), MORTSTAT (whether the\nparticipant was deceased), PERMTH_INT (time to death from interview or time to linkage if participant\nis living [censored data]), PERMTH_EXM (time to death from examination or time to linkage if\nparticipant if living), DIABETES (if the cause of death was diabetes), HYPERTEN (if the cause of death\nwas hypertension, and HIPFRACT (if the cause of death was hip fracture).\nFinally, we combined the 255 files together into single data file by merging by the patient identifier\n(`SEQN') (Fig. 1d). This merge resulted in one consolidated and analysis-ready data file representing a\nCreation of a digital handbook: annotating and categorizing the NHANES datasets\nThe CDC NHANES have provided a.html formatted codebook (e.g.: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/\nNhanes/Search/variablelist.aspx?Component = Laboratory&CycleBeginYear = 1999) that consists of vari-\nable name (column in the.xpt file) and a human-readable description of each variable. For example, the\nvariable with names RIDAGEYR or LBXGLU is described as `Age in Years' and `fasting serum glucose\n[mg ul-1]' respectively. These descriptions include the variable units, such as `ug/mL' (inferred as a\ncontinuous variable), or `positive'/`negative' (a binary variable) of each variable.\nWe have extended the CDC NHANES data description methodology in the following ways (Fig. 1e) to\nfacilitate analysis and data browsing. Specifically, we have created a data dictionary that contains the name\nof the variable, a human readable description of the variable, what `module' a variable belongs to, what\nsurvey the variable was measured (e.g., 1999\u00ad2000). Second, we have binned each variable into categories\nthat offer more specificity than the CDC NHANES `module' characterization. We make available the data\ndictionary (Fig. 1e) along with the data set (Data Citation 1). A summary of the number of variables per\ncategory, the median sample size for the variables in the category, and the demographic representation\n(percent female and race/ethnicity available for each variable) in Table 2. The entire data dictionary is\navailable as Table 3 (available online only) (Data Citation 1 and Table 3 (available online only)).\nThese categories aide in the filtering and querying of variables with common types, such as `nutrients',\n'body measures', `pharmaceutical drug', `viral infection', and `pesticides'. Second, we have created a column\nthat denotes the categorical levels for variables that are categorical or binary. For example, `Are you a past,\ncurrent, or never smoker?' is a variable that has three levels, one representing `never smoker', `current\nsmoker', and `past smoker'; these categories are captured in a column called `categorical levels'.\nBrowsing and accessing the data through BD2K Patient-Centered Information\nCommons (PIC)\nWe leveraged the Patient-Centered Information Commons (PIC, for an overview, see: http://pic-sure.\norg)) platform is leveraged to (1) enable interactive web browsing of the NHANES data (see: https://\nnhanes.hms.harvard.edu) and (2) access data through an application programming interface (API). PICs\nare built using the i2b2/tranSMART software stack. Data is organized into a hierarchy resembling a\ndirectory structure to facilitate browsing (Figs 2 and 3). Raw data can be also queried using a drag and\ndrop interface (Fig. 3). With the NHANES, we organized each of the 1171 variables into a multi-level\nhierarchy that was ordered by the module (i.e., `Laboratory', `Examination', `Demographics', and\n`Questionnaire') and category (i.e., `pesticides', `body measures', etc, see Table 2). To display this\nNHANES data hierarchy in our user interface we created a Metadata mapping file located here: https://\ngithub.com/hms-dbmi/public-data-deployments/blob/master/NHANES/nhanes_9906.map and used this\nmapping file to integrate the data file.\nThe merged dataset (`MainTable') and data dictionary (`VarDescription') (Fig. 1d,e) are made\navailable in DataDryad (Fig. 1f). A Usage Guide and.Rdata files are provided for download in GitHub\n(Fig. 1f). Finally, all data are browsable at https://nhanes.hms.harvard.edu.\nDescription NHANES module Number of variables Number of files\nDemographic attributes and cause of death in 2006 Demographics and mortality 28 4\nTable 1.

Highlighted in the screen shot are all laboratory measures of dioxins, a type of\nenvironmental exposure assayed in serum.\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\nrace/ethnicity) that we believe will aid in planning analyses of the data. Second, we have built an online\ncourse (http://www.chiragjpgroup.org/exposome-analytics-course/) to guide users step-by-step through\nan investigation our group recently published (Patel et al., 2016).\nWe plan to assess how frequently our data descriptor and data resources are being utilized by the\nscientific community through traditional means (e.g., number of citations to this descriptor), but also\nthrough by counting the number of unique visitors to the Vimeo video website, the web application\n(http://nhanes.hms.harvard.edu), and through feedback from course materials.\nCode availability\nWe demonstrate 3 use-cases in using the integrated NHANES datasets in a R markdown source file\n(see `Usage Notes'). Code is available on GitHub here: https://github.com/chiragjp/nhanes_scidata. One\nother example using our API access is available here: https://github.com/hms-dbmi/R-IRCT/blob/master/\nExample_NHANES.Rmd\nI2b2/TranSMART software stack. Code to implement a PIC is open-sourced and available here:\nhttps://github.com/hms-dbmi/HMS-DBMI-transmartApp\nData Records\nData record 1: Integrated NHANES dataset and data dictionary in.csv format.\nThe integrated NHANES dataset and a data dictionary is available online at Dryad (Data Citation 1) as\na .zip file which includes 3 .csv formatted files. The first file (`data file') contains each individual (as rows)\nsurveyed in 1999\u00ad2006 with all of their measurements (as columns) (`MainTable', Fig. 1d). The second\nfile contains a data dictionary file which contains the name of the variable as represented in the data file, a\nhuman readable description of the variable, the categories that the variable belongs to), and the levels of\nthe categories (if a categorical variable) (Fig. 1e). The third file is a dictionary specifically for demographic\ninformation, such as describing the columns for age, sex, race/ethnicity, whether the participant was born\nin the US, education level, income level, and mortality information. Also, to facilitate analyses using the\nR programming language, we have provided a 4th file that contains all the files described above as a R\ndata object in.Rdata format.\nTechnical Validation\nThe raw data contained herein are from the CDC NHANES. The CDC NHANES have performed\nextensive technical validation of their data described elsewhere (e.g., refs 30,31).\nUsage Notes\nThe NHANES utilizes a `multistage survey sampled' study design to ensure minority subgroups\n(e.g., Blacks, Mexican-American, elderly, pre-adolescents) of the population are appropriately represented\nin the dataset32 and to optimize sampling resources. Therefore, statistical analyses need to take into\naccount the structure of the sampling into account to provide accurate estimates of the population, such\nas means, standard errors, and correlations33.\nTo demonstrate how to properly analyse NHANES data, we provide a R markdown files in our\nGitHub repository (https://github.com/chiragjp/nhanes_scidata) to re-create several relevant analyses.\nFigure 3.

In the guide (https://github.com/\nchiragjp/nhanes_scidata/blob/master/User_Guide.Rmd), we describe how to associate one of the top\nfindings, serum cadmium, with all-cause mortality using survey-weighted Cox proportional hazards\nregression.\nDistribution of serum lead in in children: Accessing the NHANES in PIC-SURE API\nIn this guide (https://github.com/chiragjp/nhanes_scidata/blob/master/User_Guide_PIC.Rmd), we\ndemonstrate how to access the NHANES data programmatically through the PIC-SURE API. In our\nexample, we show how to query the API to estimate the quartiles of serum lead in the US population of\nall ages and aged under 18.\nRedistributable analytics environment in Docker\nThe issue of reproducibility, replicability, and scalability in computational scientific research has been\nraised on multiple occasions34,35. We promote a reproducible practice by packaging the curated\nNHANES data (Data Citation 1) with an analytics environment comprised of R-3.3.0 (ref. 36) and the\nRstudio-0.99.902 (ref. 37) web interface in addition to a custom R library for regression studies in a\nDocker container38. The packaged environment is publically available on Docker hub (https://hub.\ndocker.com/r/chiragjp/nhanes_scidata/) and can be consistently deployed across local or cloud-based\nenvironments. We have provided these materials as a hands-on short course available here: http://www.\nchiragjpgroup.org/exposome-analytics-course/\nReferences\n1. Skinner, A. C., Perrin, E. M., Moss, L.
