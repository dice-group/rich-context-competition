    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Across the United States, many states have actively banned the sale of soda in high schools, and\nevidence suggests that students' in-school access to soda has declined as a result. However, schools may be\nsubstituting soda with other sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and national trends indicate that adolescents are\nconsuming more sports drinks and energy drinks. This study examined whether students consumed more non-\nsoda SSBs in states that banned the sale of soda in school.\nMethods: Student data on consumption of various SSBs and in-school access to vending machines that sold SSBs\nwere obtained from the National Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Study (NYPANS), conducted in 2010. Student\ndata were linked to state laws regarding the sale of soda in school in 2010. Students were cross-classified based on\ntheir access to vending machines and whether their state banned soda in school, creating 4 comparison groups.\nZero-inflated negative binomial models were used to compare these 4 groups with respect to students' self-\nreported consumption of diet soda, sports drinks, energy drinks, coffee/tea, or other SSBs. Students who had access\nto vending machines in a state that did not ban soda were the reference group. Models were adjusted for race/\nethnicity, sex, grade, home food access, state median income, and U.S. Census region.\nResults: Students consumed more servings of sports drinks, energy drinks, coffee/tea, and other SSBs if they\nresided in a state that banned soda in school but attended a school with vending machines that sold other SSBs.\nSimilar results were observed where schools did not have vending machines but the state allowed soda to be sold\nin school. Intake was generally not elevated where both states and schools limited SSB availability \u00ad i.e., states\nbanned soda and schools did not have SSB vending machines.\nConclusion: State laws that ban soda but allow other SSBs may lead students to substitute other non-soda SSBs.\nAdditional longitudinal research is needed to confirm this. Elevated SSB intake was not observed when both states\nand schools took steps to remove SSBs from school.\nBackground\nFor decades, diet patterns around the world have shifted\ntoward greater consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages\n(SSBs) [1]. Some of the most striking trends have occurred\nin the United States (U.S.), where the proportion of daily\nenergy intake that came from SSBs increased from 4.8% to\neven higher among 12- to 19-year-olds, who consumed\nother food/beverage group among 14- to 18-year-olds\n(approximately 946 kJ/day) [4]. Overall SSB consumption\nolds still consumed 10.5% of their energy from SSBs in\nThese trends have become a prominent public health\nconcern due to the large volume of evidence that SSB\nconsumption is associated with increased weight gain\nand cardio-metabolic risk factors [6-8]. In response to\nthese concerns, state and local policymakers in the U.S.\nhave aggressively targeted adolescent soda consumption,\noften by banning the sale of soda in schools.

Sev-\neral studies have since reported that schools were less\nlikely to sell soda if their state or district had a policy\nbanning soda sales in schools [11-14]. Overall, the pro-\nportion of high school students in the U.S. who could\npurchase soda in school was cut in half in a 5-year span\nTrends in adolescent soda consumption reversed dur-\ning this time, as adjusted mean intake decreased from\nlescents may be replacing soda with other SSBs. The\ndecrease in soda consumption was balanced by a nearly\nequal increase in adjusted mean consumption of energy\nday) [5]. Most countries have not measured beverage-\nspecific trends as extensively, but a study in South Korea\nalso reported that adolescent soda intake was stable from\nincluding sports/energy drinks, increased [16].\nAdolescents often perceive these beverages as healthy\nalternatives to soda [17] and beverage companies adver-\ntise them as such [18]. However, sports drink consump-\ntion has been actively discouraged by the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP) because of sports drinks'\nhigh calorie and sugar content [19], and energy drink\nconsumption has been strongly discouraged by the AAP\n[19], American Medical Association [20], and Interna-\ntional Society of Sports Nutrition [21] because of energy\ndrinks' high caffeine content and understudied additives\nsuch as taurine and guarana [22]. Few countries care-\nfully track adverse health events that are tied to energy\ndrink consumption, but several adverse events have\nbeen reported in Germany and New Zealand [22]. Some\ncountries, including Turkey and Uruguay, have banned\nenergy drinks entirely [22].\nPolicymakers in the U.S. have not targeted non-soda\nSSBs as aggressively. The Institute of Medicine (IOM)\nrecommends that all SSBs be banned in schools [23,24],\nhigh school students were in a district that banned soda\nin vending machines, but only 6% were in a district that\nbanned all SSBs in vending machines [9]. In the same\nyear, 87.8% of high school students nationwide reported\nhaving access to some type of SSB in school [15]. State\nlaws that ban all SSBs in high schools are virtually non-\nexistent [25]. The Alliance School Beverage Guidelines,\ncreated from a partnership between the American Bev-\nerage Association, American Heart Association, and\nClinton Foundation [26], permitted the sale of sports\ndrinks and low-calorie soda (up to 10 calories per 8\nounces) in public and private high schools.\nIn the absence of more comprehensive policies, there\nis growing evidence of schools substituting soda with\nother SSBs. Studies in California [11] and Washington\n[27] reported that non-soda SSBs were widely available\nin schools even after sodas were removed. A U.S.\nnational study also reported that student-reported access\nto SSBs did not decline if states only banned soda [12].\nNo study, to our knowledge, has examined whether\nsimilar substitution patterns have occurred in response\nto policies in other countries.\nThe notion of individuals substituting soda with other\nSSBs, in response to policy change, is frequently dis-\ncussed but rarely studied. Other policy initiatives have\nbeen struck down on the rationale that people would\nsimply substitute; when the New York City Board of\nHealth attempted to limit SSB portion sizes, for exam-\nple, state courts blocked the proposal in part because\nthe limits would not apply to all SSBs in all locations\n[28]. Some experts have questioned the effectiveness of\nSSB taxes for similar reasons [29,30]. Simulation studies\nsuggested that policies could reduce caloric intake even\nwhen substitution was taken into account [31-33], but\nthese results were largely theoretical, not based on\nempirical data or randomized trials. Little research has\ndirectly examined whether policies that target soda are\nassociated with higher consumption of non-soda SSBs.\nThis study was designed to analyze substitution pat-\nterns, particularly examining whether high school stu-\ndents consumed more sports drinks, energy drinks, and\nother SSBs if their state banned soda in school.\nMethods\nThis cross-sectional study linked student data from the\nNational Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Study\n(NYPANS), conducted by the Centers for Disease Con-\ntrol and Prevention (CDC) in spring 2010, with state\nlaws regarding the sale of soda in school venues during\nInstitutional Review Boards of the University of Illinois\nat Chicago and the University of Texas Health Science\nCenter at Houston.\nStudent sample\nNYPANS was designed to measure diet, physical activity,\nand sedentary behaviors, weight status, and environmen-\ntal determinants of these measures in a nationally repre-\nsentative sample of 9th-12th grade students [34]. Students\nwere sampled using a 3-stage cluster sample design; the\nschool response rate was 82%, the student response rate\nwas 88%, and the overall response rate was 73%. In total,\n10,887 public school students participated in NYPANS.\nTaber et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and\nFor the purpose of our study, students were excluded\nif they were missing data on self-reported vending\nmachine access within school (n=691), SSB consumption\n(n=98), or other variables of interest (n=208), or if they\nwere unsure if vending machines that sold SSBs were\navailable in school (n=1,194). Students who were\nexcluded did not differ from the study sample with\nrespect to sex, weight status, vending machine access, or\nconsumption of most sweetened and unsweetened bev-\nerages, but they were more likely to be racial/ethnic\nminorities (p<0.001), tended to be in lower grade levels\n(p<0.001), and tended to consume more diet soda,\nenergy drinks, and coffee/tea than students in the study\nstudents in 27 states.\nStudent-level measures\nAll student data that were utilized in this study were\nobtained using a written questionnaire completed in class.\nThe NYPANS questionnaire was similar in format to the\nYouth Risk Behavior Survey that has been administered by\nthe CDC in odd-numbered years since 1991 to study\nhealth risk behaviors in 9th-12th grade students [35]. Our\noutcomes of interest were overall consumption of various\nSSBs other than regular soda, including diet soda, sports\ndrinks, energy drinks, coffee/tea, and \"other\" SSBs (e.g.,\n<100% fruit juice, flavored milk), each of which was mea-\nsured using separate items. Students were asked to report\nthe number of times they consumed each beverage in the\nprevious 7 days; response options ranged from zero to\n\"4 or more per day.\" The questionnaire instructed students\nto include consumption from all locations. It should be\npointed out that there was overlap between the questions\nfor coffee/tea and \"other SSBs,\" as the latter included a list\nof examples that included \"coffee drinks\" and \"sweetened\ntea.\" It should also be pointed out that the question for\ncoffee/tea included \"any kind of tea,\" not necessarily\nsweetened.\nStudents also reported whether the school had \"a\nvending machine that students can use to purchase soda\nor pop, sports drinks, or fruit drinks that are not 100%\njuice, such as Coke, Gatorade, or Sunny Delight.\" Here-\nafter, we use the term \"vending machines\" to refer spe-\ncifically to this type of vending machine.\nOther survey data that were utilized in this study were\nrace/ethnicity, sex, grade, and home food access. Race and\nethnicity were measured separately; for the purpose of this\nstudy, students were classified as non-Hispanic White,\nnon-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic Other.\nHome food access was measured by asking students to\nreport how often fruits and vegetables were available at\nhome and how often chips/cookies/cakes were available at\nhome. Both items included 5 responses ranging from\n\"never\" to \"always.\" For the purpose of this study, students\nwere classified based on whether they usually or always\nhad access to fruits and vegetables only, chips/cookies/\ncakes only, both, or neither.\nState data\nLaws regarding the availability of soda in high school\nvending machines, school stores, and cafeterias (a la carte)\nWestlaw and Lexis-Nexis legal research databases. Laws\nwere double-coded by two trained coders and verified\nagainst secondary source state law data to ensure complete\ncollection and coding interpretation. [36-38]. Laws for the\nthree venues were analyzed separately and then combined\nto create one binary indicator of whether the state prohib-\nited soda in all three venues. If a state banned soda only in\nspecific venues (n=5), it was coded as a `0' because this\nessentially meant that soda was not banned. These laws\nwere compiled by the Bridging the Gap research program\nat the University of Illinois at Chicago.\nTo be clear, a school could adhere to state law by\noffering vending machines that sold SSBs other than\nsoda. If students reported that vending machines were\navailable, this was not an indication that schools were\nnot adhering to state law, as schools could adhere by\noffering other SSBs. We explored studying whether laws\nwere more effective if states banned SSBs other than\nsoda, but no state in NYPANS had such restrictions on\nAnalyses also utilized state data on Census region\n(Northeast, South, Midwest, or West) and median\nhousehold income, which were obtained from the 2010\nU.S. Census.\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses used a zero-inflated negative binomial model\ndue to the highly-skewed distributions of SSB consump-\ntion. For each SSB in this study, a large proportion of the\nsample consumed zero servings and a small proportion\nconsumed a large quantity. For example, 42% of students\nconsumed zero servings of sports drinks in the past 7\ndays, but 11% consumed 14 or more servings of sports\ndrinks (mean=3.5, SD=6.0). The zero-inflated negative\nbinomial model estimates both the log odds of students\nreporting zero servings and the log count of servings that\nIn analyses of state soda laws, students were cross-classi-\nfied based on whether their state banned the sale of soda\nin all school venues and whether their school had vending\nmachines that sold other SSBs. This categorization scheme\nwas chosen because soda bans that are similar, on paper,\nmay have a different effect in practice if students still have\naccess to other SSBs in vending machines. The reference\ngroup was students who had access to vending machines\nin school and resided in a state that allowed soda in\nTaber et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and\nschool. Indicator variables were used to mark the other 3\ngroups: 1) students who had access to vending machines\nin a state that banned soda, 2) students with no access to\nvending machines in a state that allowed soda in school,\nand 3) students with no access to vending machines in a\nstate that banned soda.\nEach model controlled for race/ethnicity (reference\ngroup: non-Hispanic White), sex (reference group: boys),\ngrade (continuous), home food access (reference group:\naccess to fruits/vegetables only), Census region, and state\nmedian income (log-transformed) in the logistic portion\nof the model, and race/ethnicity, sex, grade, and home\nfood access in the negative binomial portion of the\nmodel. Census region was modeled as a 3-category\nvariable \u00ad South/Midwest (reference group), Northeast,\nWest \u00ad because there were no Midwestern states in\nNYPANS that banned soda.\nAnalyses were conducted in the overall sample and\nthen repeated by race/ethnicity and sex. This stratifica-\ntion was conducted because consumption of specific\nSSBs has been found to vary by race/ethnicity and sex\nResults\nTable 1 displays descriptive statistics of the study sam-\nple, overall and by state/school measures of SSB access.\nTable 1.

International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and\nCensus region and racial/ethnic distributions differed\nconsiderably across categories of state laws. Specifically,\nno Midwestern states in the study banned soda. Due in\npart to the demographics of the Midwestern states,\nwhich tend to have a relatively large proportion of non-\nHispanic White residents, students who resided in a\nstate that did not ban soda were far more likely to be\nsumed an average of 5.4 servings of soda per week;\namong the SSBs that we analyzed in this study, `other\nSSBs' such as <100% fruit juice were the most heavily\nconsumed (4.1), followed by sports drinks (3.5). Students\nin states with no soda ban were more likely to report\nhaving access to SSB vending machines (84.0%), but\nsuch vending machines were still widely available in\nstates with soda bans (68.9%).\nResults from analyses of state soda laws and school\nvending machine access are presented in Table 2. Para-\nmeter estimates in Table 2 represent the difference in log\nodds of reporting zero servings (\"logistic\") and difference\nin the log number of servings consumed in the past 7\ndays (\"negative binomial\"). Here, to make results more\ninterpretable, we present the relative measures of con-\nsumption (e.g., RR=relative number of servings per week)\nthat are calculated from the parameters in Table 2.\nConsistently, state laws banning soda and vending\nmachine access were not associated with the odds of\nreporting zero/no servings of SSBs. (As a reminder, the\nreference is students who had access to vending\nmachines in a state that allowed soda.) Among SSB con-\nsumers, however, the quantity of consumption tended to\nbe higher in 2 of the 3 comparison groups \u00ad 1) students\nwith access to vending machines in a state that banned\nsoda, and 2) students with no access to vending\nmachines in a state that did not ban soda. In other\nwords, SSB consumption tended to be higher if indivi-\ndual state or school restrictions on SSB access were in\nplace, but usually not if both state and school restric-\ntions were in place.\nFor example, students who had access to vending\nmachines in a state that banned soda in schools\nschool with no vending machines in a state that allowed\nintake of SSBs was not elevated among students who\nattended a school with no vending machines in a state\nthat banned soda (n=1046), with the exception of a\nTable 2.

International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and\nin the past decade. Prior to the diffusion of school nutri-\ntion policies, sodas had been widely available in schools\nnationwide [15] and were consumed in large, unhealthy\nquantities by a large proportion of adolescents in the\nU.S. [2,4,5]. Policies have been very successful in remov-\ning soda from schools, as intended [11-14], but this\nstudy raises questions of how students may be compen-\nsating for such changes.\nWe found that students tended to consume more\nsports drinks, energy drinks, coffee/tea, and other SSBs if\nthey resided in a state that only banned soda in schools.\nThese trends were most apparent where the state banned\nsoda at schools but students still had access to vending\nmachines that sold sweetened beverages. The NYPANS\nmeasure of vending machines explicitly instructed stu-\ndents to include vending machines that sold any type of\nSSB, and nearly 70% of students in states with soda bans\nreported having access to such vending machines at\nschool. Thus, it is plausible that schools in NYPANS\nadhered to laws by replacing soda with other SSBs, as\nelevated SSB intake among students whose school did\nnot have SSB vending machines but the state did not ban\nsoda at school. The inverse association between vending\nmachine access and SSB consumption may represent a\ndifferent causal mechanism, such as students leaving\ncampus if schools did not have vending machines and\nstate laws were not actively requiring healthier beverages\nwithin school. We can only speculate about why these\npatterns were observed; additional research is needed to\nexplore the mechanisms behind them.\nInterestingly, SSB consumption was not elevated if both\nschools and states took action to reduce SSB access \u00ad i.e.,\nstates banned soda and schools did not offer vending\nmachines. A recent study similarly reported that students\nwithout vending machines consumed more soda unless\nthe state also banned soda in school [41]. Different\nfactors may explain the null results that were observed\nwhen both schools and states restricted SSB access. One\nexplanation is that the comprehensive effect on policy/\nenvironmental changes at the state and school level cre-\nated healthier environments overall (e.g., access to heal-\nthier beverages). Previous research reported that the sale\nof unhealthy foods/beverages in elementary schools was\noften lowest when both state and local policies were\nenacted [13]. Low statistical power is another possible\nexplanation for the null results, however, as the group\nwith both state soda bans and no access to vending\nmachines had a relatively small sample size.\nResults also suggested that different sub-populations\nmay have substituted soda with different SSBs. Non-\nHispanic Blacks tended to consume more sports drinks\nand energy drinks, in particular, when the state banned\nsoda; these results differ from racial/ethnic trends in\nSSB intake in the U.S. overall, as reported elsewhere [5].\nThe increase in energy drink consumption among\nBlacks is particularly concerning as health organizations\ncontinue to speak out against the harmful effects of\nenergy drink consumption [19-21]. Energy drinks have\nno health benefits and include several additives that are\nunderstudied and unregulated [22]. They commonly\ncontain 70-80 milligrams (mg) of caffeine per 8 ounces,\nmore than twice the concentration in cola drinks; 20-\nounce energy drink containers include up to 325 mg of\ncaffeine, comparable to 3-4 cups of coffee [42].\nChanges in industry marketing practices may have\ncontributed to the results that we observed. In the U.S.\nin 2006, a coalition of food/beverage companies pledged\nto market \"healthier dietary choices\" to children <12\nyears old, but recent evidence suggests that companies'\nmarketing of unhealthy foods has shifted toward 12-17\nyear-olds [43]. Advertising spending on energy drinks\nage companies' marketing is often targeted at Black and\nHispanic youth [18]. More research is needed to deter-\nmine if changes in marketing practices have contributed\nto high consumption of SSBs that were observed in this\nstudy and in the general population [5].\nThese results underscore the limited scope of existing\nschool beverage guidelines at the high school level. In the\n14 of 50 states in the U.S. met IOM recommendations to\nban all SSBs at the elementary school level, but Connecti-\ncut was the only state that met IOM recommendations\nfor high schools [25]. High school students are a popula-\ntion whose SSB preference has shifted toward non-soda\nSSBs in recent years [5]. This shift may be a direct conse-\nquence of policies that targeted soda, of increased mark-\ning of other SSBs, or it may be a coincidence. Regardless,\npolicies need to shift accordingly to improve the overall\nquality of adolescents' beverage intake and thereby\nreduce the health risks that are associated with overall\nsweetened beverage consumption. Policies that restrict\nSSB availability should also be accompanied by initiatives\nthat promote low-cost alternatives such as filtered water\nwhile recognizing that beverage choices are commonly\nbased on taste and price, not health [44].\nAs with any observational study, we cannot conclude\nthat laws or vending machine access were the causes of\nelevated SSB intake. States may have banned soda, in\npart, because of students' elevated SSB intake, which\nwould partially explain the associations that we observed.\nWe could not control for unmeasured student-level vari-\nables such as socioeconomic status (SES), either. Our\nanalyses of vending machines were further limited\nbecause students were not asked which specific SSBs\nwere available in vending machines, nor were students\nTaber et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and\nasked where they were consuming these beverages or\nwhether SSBs were available in other school venues.\nTherefore, we cannot ascertain if schools were substitut-\ning soda with other SSBs or students were simply obtain-\ning SSBs elsewhere. We should also point out that,\namong the three comparison groups in our analysis, the\nsample size was largest for the category of students who\nhad access to vending machines in a state that banned\nsoda; statistical power was more limited in the other two\ngroups. NYPANS was also designed to be representative\nat the national, not state, level.\nFinally, we did not analyze specific measures of nutrient\nintake, a topic that should be explored further in future\nresearch. The overall impact of SSB substitution on stu-\ndents' nutrient intake, weight status, and cardio-metabolic\nhealth has not been studied extensively and is difficult to\nproject due to variance in serving sizes and compositional\ndifferences between beverages and brands. The energy and\nsugar content of energy drinks and fruit drinks can vary\nenormously by brand and variety [45]. Sports drinks con-\nare commonly sold in 32-ounce containers (in contrast to\nthe typical 12-ounce soda can or 20-ounce soda bottle.)\nFurthermore, traditional SSB measures do not fully cap-\nture beverages that are calorically sweetened after pur-\nchase, but recent methods have been designed to account\nfor this [47]. Careful research is needed to determine how\nSSB substitution behaviors translate to health outcomes\nwhen these variables are taken into account.\nConclusions\nOur study raises concerns about whether policymakers'\nfocus on soda may have unintended negative conse-\nquences at the high school level, as laws that ban soda\nwere associated with higher intake of other SSBs when\nvending machines were still available. We cannot prove\ncausality, but the elevated SSB intake suggests that state\nsoda bans were, at best, not addressing the beverage\nconsumption patterns of the adolescent populations in\nthese states. Adolescents' SSB preferences have shifted\nin the U.S. overall, but high school SSB policies have\nnot followed suit even though high school is a period\nwhen children tend to consume the most SSBs. Existing\npolicies may need to be expanded to restrict the sale of\nall SSBs, in accordance with IOM recommendations\n[23,24], and ensure that students are able to access low-\ncost healthier alternatives in school. Additional longitu-\ndinal research is needed to determine whether more\ncomprehensive SSB restrictions can reduce consumption\nof all SSBs.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nDT conceived and designed the study, oversaw the statistical analyses, and\nled the writing of the manuscript.
