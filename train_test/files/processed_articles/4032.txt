    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe propose that resilience effectively helps people cope with stress, thus predominantly reducing the negative. However,\nwe argue that individuals' social identification has the potential to contribute to their well-being, thus fostering the\npositive. A two-wave survey study of 180 students shows that resilience is more strongly (negatively) associated with\nill-health (i.e. stress and depression), whereas social identification is more strongly (positively) related to well-being (i.e.\nsatisfaction and work engagement). We believe that it is necessary to see these two routes to improving people's health\nas complementary, both in future research and for therapy and interventions.\n",

Of course, you would go and see a dentist or a doctor.\nBut what do you do when you are feeling physically okay\nbut you want to get into a more positive mood? Your first\nthought is probably not to seek help from a physician.\nFor a long time, psychologists have focused on negative\nmental states and developed, practiced, and evaluated ther-\napies for curing these states. When introducing positive\npsychology, Seligman (2002) strongly demanded that psy-\nchology should focus more on positive well-being. Rather\nthan just trying to get people from -5 back to the 0 line, we\nshould aim at getting them to +5. In this article, we will\npresent two routes to better health, each focusing on one\nspecific aspect. On one hand, we will discuss resilience as\nan individual difference factor that helps people cope with\nstress and prevents them from becoming ill. On the other\nhand, we suggest that social identification with teams and\ngroups provides a social cure (Jetten et al., 2012) that helps\npeople maintain happy and engaged lives beyond the mere\nabsence of ill-health. More specifically, our study aimed to\nextend previous research by testing, for the first time, the\nhypothesis that resilience as an individual difference varia-\nble helps people cope with stress--that is, reducing the\nnegative--whereas social identification with groups helps\npeople to achieve a satisfactory life and increase their well-\nbeing--that is, fostering the positive.\nResilience and well-being\nStress-related illness represents one of the biggest chal-\nlenges to modern societies, but there is mounting evi-\ndence that individuals substantially vary in how they\nreact to stressors. When facing daily hassles such as time\ncal life events such as job loss or a divorce, some people\ndevelop mental illnesses such as depression or anxiety\ndisorders. Other people, however, do not show such neg-\native reactions to similar stressors. In other words, some\nTwo sides of the same coin and two\nroutes for improvement: Integrating\nresilience and the social identity\napproach to well-being and ill-health\nRolf Van Dick1,2, Charlene Ketturat3,\nJan Alexander H\u00e4usser4 and Andreas Mojzisch3\n Keywords\nhealth, positive and negative well-being, resilience, social identification, social identity approach\n1Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany\n2Work Research Institute (AFI), Oslo, Norway\n3University of Hildesheim, Germany\n4Justus Liebig University Giessen, Germany\nCorresponding author:\nRolf Van Dick, Department of Social Psychology, Goethe University\nFrankfurt, Theodor-W.-Adorno-Platz 6, 60323 Frankfurt am Main,\nGermany.\nEmail: van.dick@psych.uni-frankfurt.de\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nindividuals seem to be resilient against stressors and they\napparently have the biological, social, or psychological\nresources to cope with such negative experiences.\nLuthans et al. (2007) defined resilience as the \"capacity\nto rebound or bounce back from adversity, conflict, or\nfailure\" (p. 18). It is one of the core concepts of positive\npsychology that has been studied and found to be predic-\ntive of people's health--even under stressful circum-\nstances. Gloria and Steinhardt (2016), for instance, found\na buffering effect of resilience on the relation between\nstress and anxiety and depression. Shamaskin-Garroway\net al. (2016) found more adjustment to effects of\nParkinson's disease, and Yi-Frazier et al. (2015) found\namong diabetes patients that high resilience was associ-\nated with less distress, better glycemic control, and the\nuse of more adaptive coping strategies.\nA recent meta-analysis by Hu et al. (2015) summarized\n60 studies with a total of 111 effect sizes and looked at the\nrelation between trait resilience and health-related variables.\nThe analyses revealed an average effect of -.36 between\nresilience and negative indicators of well-being (i.e. depres-\nsion, anxiety, and negative affect). The authors also identi-\nfied positive relations between resilience and general life\nsatisfaction and positive affect but no measures of domain-\nspecific satisfaction or work engagement were included in\nthe analyses. We found only one study that has investigated\nthe relationship between resilience and work engagement by\nMache et al. (2014) who reported a positive correlation in a\ncross-sectional survey of medical doctors in Germany. In\nline with the definition of Luthans et al. (2007), which sug-\ngests that resilience shows a buffering effect in the occur-\nrence of negative event, Hu et al. (2015) also found that\nadversity was moderating the resilience-ill-health effect.\nThat is, resilience was more strongly (negatively) related to\nill-health in times of adversity. In this study, we further\nexplore the idea of resilience as a variable that helps people\ncope with stress and thus reduces ill-health.\nSocial identity and well-being\nThe social identity approach (cf. Haslam, 2004; Jetten\net al., 2012) states that groups that provide us with a sense\nof belonging are good for health and well-being. The theo-\nretical foundation for these beneficial effects is derived\nfrom social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner, 1979) and\nself-categorization theory (Turner, 1985). A key idea of\nthese theories is that when individuals identify with groups,\nthey have a common perspective and coordinate their\nbehavior with respect to group norms. This also leads to\nproviding and receiving more social support which in turn\nhelps developing a stronger sense of collective self-effi-\nfor the mediating role of collective efficacy between moti-\nvational climate and the well-being of athletes). In addi-\ntion, it has been proposed that a shared social identity\nserves as a basis for a more favorable interpretation of\nsocial support (Haslam et al., 2012). In line with this\nnotion, it has been found that social support has more posi-\ntive effects if the provider and recipient of support share a\nsocial identity (Frisch et al., 2014). Above and beyond this\npotential to better cope with stressors due to more support\nand higher self-efficacy, social identification should also\nlead to greater well-being because it satisfies basic human\nneeds for belonging and affiliation, certainty, and safety\nimportance of social relationships for well-being has also\nbeen suggested by Rusk and Waters (2015) in their psy-\ncho-social system approach and by Stavrova and Luhmann\n(2016) who found that collective connectedness was\nrelated to a higher sense of meaning in life and vice versa.\nAlong similar lines, Stok et al. (2014) showed that partici-\npants who identified strongly with groups with pro-health\nnorms had higher vegetable consumption. On one hand,\none would predict such positive effects of shared group\nidentities and high identification only if the respective\ngroup is supportive and promotes healthy living norms\n(e.g. Sani et al., 2015). Group membership may, on the\nother hand, harm well-being when the group norms pre-\nscribe unhealthy behaviors (e.g. binge drinking, see\nGardner et al., 2012), or when relations between members\nin a group are toxic and hostile.\nSteffens et al. (2017) have recently provided meta-ana-\nlytic evidence that identification in organizational contexts\nis indeed related to people's health. Importantly, these\nauthors also argued that identification should be more\nclosely related to the presence of well-being rather than to\nthe absence of stress because \"high social identification is\ngenerally construed to be a basis for experiencing positive\noutcomes (e.g. support, belonging, control, agency) rather\nthan to be a basis for avoiding negative outcomes\" (Steffens\nlongitudinal study with students at the beginning and at the\n(generally more stressful) end of the academic term.\nHypotheses\nBuilding on existing theory and research, we predict the\nfollowing:\nHypothesis 1. Students'resilience at the beginning of the\nacademic term will positively relate to (a) study satisfac-\ntion and (b) work engagement, and negatively relate to\n(c) anxiety and depression and (d) chronic stress\n3months later.\nHypothesis 2. Students' social identification at the\nbeginning of the academic term will positively relate to\n(a) study satisfaction and (b) work engagement, and\nnegatively relate to (c) anxiety and depression and (d)\nchronic stress 3months later.\nVan Dick et al. 3\nFurthermore, we predict that resilience is more closely\nrelated to ill-health rather than well-being. This should be\nthe case because the definition of resilience involves some\nadversity and coping with it. Resilience thus buffers nega-\ntive effects of stressors and should help people not getting\nill from such adversity. Identification, on the other hand,\nnot only helps activating social support resources and foster\ncollective self-efficacy but also exerts a main effect on peo-\nple's health because of its function to satisfy people's needs\nfor belonging, affiliation, and safety:\nHypothesis 3a. Resilience will be more strongly related to\nmeasures of ill-health than to measures of well-being.\nHypothesis 3b. Social identification will be more\nstrongly related to measures of well-being than to meas-\nures of ill-health.\nMethods\nSample and procedure\nWe used an online survey to measure the study concepts.\nIn introductory lectures, we approached students in\nBachelor and Master programs of various disciplines at the\nbeginning of the academic term and informed them about\nthe purpose and design of this study. We explained that the\ndata were collected anonymously and that participation\nwas voluntary. A total of 235 students participated in the\nfirst wave and provided an individual code so that we\ncould match the data at the second wave, 3\nmonths later.\nFor the second wave, we chose a time around the end-of-\nterm exams which should be perceived as stressful by stu-\ndents (see for an analysis of stress among undergraduate\nand graduate students: Bedewy and Gabriel, 2015). At\ntime 2, 180 students participated again and formed the\nbasis of our analyses. Of these, 91.7percent were female,\naverageagewas22years(standarddeviation(SD)=5years)\nand 79percent were first year students.\nMeasures\nAt time 1, we measured the dependent variables, namely,\nidentification and resilience. Social identification with fel-\nlow students, lecturers, and the university were measured\nadopting items from Doosje et al. (1995) and Mael and\nAshforth (1992). We provided the items with a 7-point\nanswering scale (endpoints \"completely agree\" and \"com-\npletely disagree,\" sample item: \"I feel strong ties with other\nstudents in my program\"). Altogether, 14 items were used\nand collapsed into one scale. We measured resilience using\nthe Brief Resilience Scale (Smith et al., 2008) with six items\n(sample item: \"I tend to bounce back quickly after hard\ntimes\") and the same answering scale as for identification.\nAt time 2, we measured all dependent variables. We\nmeasured students' study satisfaction with five items\nadapted from Holm-Hadulla and Hofmann (2007). The\nitems asked for satisfaction with several aspects such as the\ngeneral study conditions or one's personal study situation\n(5-point answering scales with endpoints \"very dissatis-\nfied\" and \"very satisfied\").\nWork engagement was measured using the 17-item\nUtrecht Work Engagement Scale (Schaufeli et al., 2006;\n7-point answering scale with endpoints \"never\" and\n\"always,\" sample items: \"At my work, I feel bursting with\nenergy,\" \"I find the work that I do full of meaning and pur-\npose,\" \"Time flies when I am working\").\nChronic stress was measured with the Trier Inventory\nfor Chronic Stress (TICS) screening scale (Schulz et al.,\n(endpoints \"never\" and \"very often,\" sample items: \"I\nfind it difficult to ignore negative thoughts and stop wor-\nrying,\" \"Despite my best efforts, my work finds no\nrecognition\").\nFinally, depression and anxiety were measured with four\nitems of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4)\n(Kroenke et al., 2009; 4-point answering scale with end-\npoints \"never\" and \"almost daily,\" sample item: \"Over the\npast two weeks, I experienced little interest and enjoyment\nin my work\").\nResults\nTable 1 provides means, standard deviations, scale inter-\ncorrelations, and Cronbach's alphas. First, we used con-\nfirmatory factor analysis using MPlus 7 to test whether the\nfour dependent variables form distinctive factors. For the\nlatent factor of depression/anxiety, we used four and for\nthe latent factor of satisfaction, we used five variables as\nindicators. For the latent factors of work engagement and\nstress, we used parceling and combined half of the items\ninto one indicator each (i.e. two parcels for engagement\nand two for stress). As expected, a model comprising four\nlatent variables with two second-order factors, namely, one\nfactor for ill-health (comprising stress and depression/anxi-\nety) and a second factor for well-being (comprising satis-\ndegree of freedom (df)=60, p\n<\n.05; comparative fit index\n(CFI)=.94; Tucker\u00adLewis index (TLI)=.92; root mean\nsquare error of approximation (RMSEA)\n=\nized root mean square residual (SRMR)=.058) and signifi-\ncantly better than a model with all indicators (respectively,\nAs expected, the two second-latent order factors were sig-\nnificantly related (-.71, the average absolute correlation\nbetween the four scales is much lower with r=.47) but the\nunshared variation of about 50percent shows that they are\nnot simply endpoints of a continuum but represent distinct\naspects--which supports our view of well-being and ill-\nhealth being two sides of one coin.\n4 Health Psychology Open \nTo test our hypotheses, we compared correlation coeffi-\ncients and ran regression analyses (see Table 2). Resilience\nwas, as predicted in Hypothesis 1, both in the simple correla-\ntions and in the regression analyses, significantly and posi-\ntively related to students' satisfaction (H1a) and work\nengagement (H1b) 3months later and negatively and signifi-\ncantly related to depression/anxiety (H1c) and stress level\n(H1d). As predicted in Hypothesis 2a and b, we found sig-\nnificant and positive relations between social identification\nand students' satisfaction and engagement. Unexpectedly,\nhowever, we found no relation between social identification\nand depression/anxiety or stress (H2c and H2d).\nAs can be seen in Tables 1 and 2, identification was\nmore closely related to measures of well-being compared to\nresilience, whereas resilience was more closely related to\nmeasures of ill-health. To test Hypothesis 3 more formally,\nwe computed average correlations and tested the differ-\nences using z-tests. The average correlation of resilience\nand ill-health was .44 (absolute value) compared to the\naverage correlation of resilience and well-being of .25; the\nq=.22), thereby supporting H3a. The average correlation of\nidentification and ill-health was .06 (absolute value) com-\npared to the average correlation of identification and well-\nbeing of .29; the difference was significant (z=3.18,\nDiscussion\nWe found that indicators of well-being and ill-health repre-\nsent two sides of the same coin. As predicted, students'\nresilience and social identification both explained positive\noutcomes (i.e. less stress and greater well-being) over a\nperiod of 3\nmonths. However, social identification was\nrelated to well-being but not to ill-health. Resilience was\nrelated to both aspects but, as expected, was more strongly\nrelated to ill-health than to well-being.\nOur study has some limitations. Most importantly, we\nonly surveyed a specific group of university students which\nis not representative of the wider population. However, we\nsee no reason to assume, that the general pattern of resil-\nience being a stronger predictor for negative outcomes and\nidentification being a stronger predictor for positive out-\ncomes should not generalize to other domains, even though\nthe specific types of stressors might differ. Second, the use\nof self-reports may limit the validity of our findings.\nHowever, we used standardized scales designed for and\ncommonly used as self-assessment. Also, it has been shown\nrepeatedly that subjective indicators of health such as satis-\nfaction are predictive of objective outcome such as longev-\nClearly, the strength of our study is the longitudinal\ndesign allowing tentative causal inferences, and the fact\nthat we actually found the predicted effects over a period of\n3months. It would be desirable to replicate our findings in\nfuture studies in other occupational groups, and using\nobjective health indicators (e.g. endocrinological meas-\nures) and even longer time periods.\nAs implications for practice, our results point to the fact\nthat both resilience and social identification are important\npathways for reducing stress and ill-health and for creating\nsatisfaction and well-being. The good news is that both\nTable 1. Means, standard deviations (SDs), and intercorrelations.\naCronbach's alphas are displayed on the diagonal. N=180 (listwise).\nTable 2.

Leppin et al. (2014) meta-analyt-\nically supported the idea that resilience can be built up\nwith stress-management trainings. They identified 13 stud-\nies which provided a generalized stress training and meas-\nured resilience within 3months of follow-up and found a\nthe effects of an intensive mindfulness intervention with\n10\u00ad12hours of training per day for 1month and found sig-\nnificant increases in resilience compared to a control\ngroup. Adler et al. (2015) found positive effects on resil-\nience trainings of soldiers during basic combat training for\nanxiety reduction.\nLikewise, with respect to social identity, Haslam et al.\n(2016) have recently shown a relatively simple but effective\nway to increase people's usage of their social relations. Based\non the social identity approach to health and well-being, the\nauthors devised \"groups 4 health,\" a manualized five-module\npsychological intervention aiming at developing social group\nrelationships. In a non-randomized control design with young\nadults who suffered from social isolation and affective disor-\nders, a significant increase in participants' social identifica-\ntion was found which in turn significantly improved mental\nhealth, well-being, and social connectedness.\nIt has already been shown that group-based trainings--\npossibly because of increased social identity--can be more\nsuccessful than individual trainings, for instance, in mind-\nfulness mediation trainings to reduce weight (Mantzios and\nAnother way to increase people's well-being at work is\nthrough authentic leadership which has been suggested to\nunfold its positive effects through increased social identifi-\ncation (e.g. Hystad et al., 2014). Future applications of the\ntwo pathways and research combining the two fields of\nresearch are clearly promising.\n"
