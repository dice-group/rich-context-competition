This study examined the differential impact of social roles and socioeconomic resources on the mental\nhealth of Korean men and women aged 65 years or older.\nMethods. The study sample was a weighted population of 930 people (905 survey samples) aged 65 years or older who\nhad responded to the health behavior survey of the 2001 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nResults. We observed striking gender differences in the correlates of poor mental health. Living alone was significantly\nassociated with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in men but not in women. Living in a multigenerational family\nwithout a spouse and having a lower household income were significantly associated with poor mental health in both men\nand women.\nDiscussion. We discuss the intriguing evidence of gender differences in the correlates of mental health within the\ncontext of traditional Asian society and suggest further research on social components of gender differences in mental\nhealth across diverse cultures.\nRESEARCHERS have attributed differences in the mental\nhealth of men and women to the influence of gender-\nrelated social exposures (Simon, 1995). Such exposures range\nfrom differential socioeconomic experiences of men and\nwomen in terms of labor force participation, financial in-\ndependence, and the division of labor and exercise of authority\nTurner & Turner, 1999), to health-related behaviors such as\nsmoking and drinking. These exposures become gender-related\nbecause they are associated with gender roles and socialization.\nMental health problems may result in selection out of social\nroles such as being married or employed (Aneshensel, Rutter,\n& Lachenbruch, 1991). If the selection is gender related, it may\nalso contribute to differences in mental health between gender\ngroups.\nTheoretical hypotheses on gendered patterns, arising from\nthe influence of different social exposures of men and women,\nassume that men have traditionally been socialized to give\npriority to the breadwinner role, so that any conflict affecting\nthe employee role may have greater adverse effects on the\nmental health of men compared to women (Turner & Turner,\n1999). For example, the loss of work roles (stemming from job\nloss or retirement) is more threatening to the mental health of\nmen than of women (Mo\n\u00a8ller-Leimku\nsocieties in which gender roles are much more strongly\ndemarcated (e.g., men as primary breadwinners). In contrast,\ndomestic caregiving needs, such as caring for the young and the\nold, affect women's mental health more strongly than men's\n(Rosenfield, Vertefuille, & McAlpine, 2000). Women and men\nhave different expectations of social roles and relationships in\nthe household over the course of their lives; thus, the health\nconsequences of family structure vary (Logan & Spitze, 1996).\nFor example, in midlife, men are the main beneficiaries of their\nwives' household work and child care; they suffer more distress\nthan women after they lose their spouse, particularly due to the\nburden of domestic tasks and their lack of social networks and\nsupport through, for example, church attendance or voluntary\ngroup participation (Lee, DeMaris, Bavin, & Sullivan, 2001;\nUmberson, Wortman, & Kessler, 1992). Living alone is\nparticularly detrimental to men, whereas its effects on women\nare weaker or inconsistent (Hughes & Waite, 2002; Joutsen-\nniemi, Martelin, Martikainen, Pirkola, & Koskinen, 2006).\nLikewise, Hughes and Waite found that women in late midlife\nexhibited more depressive symptoms when living alone with\nchildren, whereas men living in a similar situation did not.\nDifferences of gender-related social roles and relations\nbetween countries may result in different gendered patterns\non mental health. Korea, like other East Asian societies, has\nmaintained a culture characterized to a great extent by\npatriarchy and Confucianism, as evidenced by traditional\nnorms governing the household division of labor, the high\ngender income gap (the ratio of female to male income is 0.48),\nand the low representation of women in national politics (13%\nof parliamentarians are women; United Nations Development\non the 2005 UNDP index of gender empowerment, which\nsummarizes women's economic autonomy and political par-\nticipation in society. Takeda and colleagues (2004) observed\nthat patriarchal family structure may influence the mental health\nof women. For example, women in multigenerational house-\nholds have significantly higher caregiving concerns than\nwomen living with only their husband. Patriarchal culture\nmay also impose a penalty on men through pressure to\novercommit to work, leading to health-damaging coping\nbehaviors such as heavy drinking with (male) colleagues after\nwork. Over the past decades, however, rapid social and\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2007 by The Gerontological Society of America\neconomic changes such as the rising standard of living,\nindustrialization, expansion of formal education, and increased\nfemale labor force participation have had profound implications\nGiven the persistence of traditional norms and concurrent\ndramatic social changes, older Korean adults who have been\nfaithful in the performance of their filial duties and sex-\nsegregated roles are faced with the undesirable impact of rapid\nsocial changes. For example, many older adults, especially\nolder women living with extended family members, cannot\nalleviate their family obligations by deferring the burden to\ntheir married children and daughters-in-law, as their parents did\nunder traditional norms. Rather, they, instead of their working,\nmarried children and their children's spouses, often continue to\ntake care of the extended family.\nIn addition to gender differences, which researchers have\nalmost universally noted with respect to the prevalence of\npsychiatric morbidity, predictors of mental health may also\nbe gendered. Therefore, this study examined social correlates\nand gender differences in the socioeconomic and psychosocial\ncorrelates of mental health among older Koreans. We hypoth-\nesized that there would be a differential impact of social factors\non mental health between elderly women and elderly men in\nSouth Korea.\nMETHODS\nDesign and Study Population\nThe data came from the Korean National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) conducted in\n2001 by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare.\nKNHANES surveys have been repeated with very similar\ncross-sectional designs since 1992 at 3- to 4-year intervals with\nnationally representative samples of noninstitutionalized per-\nsons residing in Korea. The most recent data available at\nFor the 2001 KNHANES, researchers selected a nationwide\nprobability sample of the population via a stratified multistage\nprobability sampling design based on geographic area, gender,\nand age group using the 2000 Korean National Census Registry\n(Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2002). For the health\nbehavior survey, investigators selected 4,400 households within\nnoninstitutionalized individuals aged 12 and older. A total\nof 9,170 individuals completed interviews by a trained inter-\nviewer, constituting a response rate of 88.45%. The present\nstudy limited its analysis to a weighted population of 930 (905\nsurvey samples) elderly people aged 65 years or older from the\nhealth behavior survey of the 2001 KNHANES. Comparisons\nto census data showed that the sample was representative of\nthe Korean elderly population aged 65 or older in gender and\nage. The Research Ethics Review Board of the Seoul National\nUniversity School of Public Health approved the protocol for\nour analysis.\nMental Health Outcome Measures\nWe used two self-reported mental health indicators, de-\npressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, as outcome measures\nfor this analysis. Depressive symptoms were assessed by\na single item: ``How often have you felt depressed or sad during\nthe past year?'' Responses were on a 4-point interval scale:\nalways, sometimes, seldom, and never. We divided the\nresponses into categories for binary logistic regression analysis\nby classifying responses of ``always'' in the depression\ncategory and combining all other responses into the no\ndepression category. Researchers successfully used this method\nin a previous study using 1998 KNHANES data (I. H. Kim,\nMuntaner, Khang, Paek, & Cho, 2006). Different categoriza-\ntions can be used with other statistical methods. For example,\nthree categories of outcomes (obtained by collapsing ``seldom''\nand ``never'' into one category) may be used for multinomial\nlogistic regression analysis, and all four categories may be used\nfor ordinal logistic regression analysis. In our study, because\nthese methods gave similar results, we used the more simple\nbinary definition of depression for our analysis. Suicidal\nideation was assessed by a single yes/no response item:\n``Have you ever thought of taking your life during the past\nyear?''\nSocioeconomic Measures\nEducation levels were classified as middle school or higher,\nelementary school, and uneducated. Current labor market\nparticipation was categorized into yes or no (``no'' included\nretired, unemployed, and disabled and out of work). Household\nequivalized income (total household income divided by the\nsquare root of the number of household members) was\ncalculated into tertiles to detect a nonlinear relationship.\nSubjective socioeconomic status was assessed by the question\n``How would you describe your current socioeconomic status?''\nPossible answers were 1 \u00bc very rich, 2 \u00bc rich, 3 \u00bc neither rich\nnor poor, 4 \u00bc poor, 5 \u00bc very poor. To avoid collinearity with\nhousehold income, we dichotomized the responses so that\n``poor'' and ``very poor'' contrasted with the remaining\ncategories.\nHealth Behavior and Living Arrangements\nWe used two indicators of health behavior. Smoking and\ndrinking status was classified as never, former, and current,\nwith never smokers/drinkers as the reference category. Living\narrangements were divided into four categories: (a) living with\nspouse only; (b) living with spouse and adult children, elderly\nparents, or nonrelated individuals; (c) widowed and living with\nchildren or others; and (d) living alone.\nOther Covariates\nWe also included age and self-reported health status (overall\nperceived health, number of physical illnesses) as covariates.\nWe measured global self-rated health with the question ``How\nwould you rate your health in general?'' There were five\nresponse options: 1 \u00bc very good, 2 \u00bc good, 3 \u00bc fair, 4 \u00bc bad,\nand 5 \u00bc very bad. We dichotomized the responses to this\nquestion as ``very good'' or ``good'' versus the rest. We eval-\nuated the number of physical illnesses using the responses to\nquestions inquiring about a history of chronic disease such\nas cancer, stroke, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and\ndiabetes mellitus. We classified participants into three catego-\nries according to the total number of aforementioned physical\nStatistical Methods\nWe calculated the age-standardized prevalence of the\nendpoints (depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation) with\nage adjustment for 5-year age groups using the direct method.\nWe used the distribution of all samples as the standard in cal-\nculating prevalence. We performed logistic regression analyses\nto assess the association between mental health indices and the\ncovariates. We present results here as odds ratios (ORs) with\n95% confidence intervals (CIs). We evaluated possible multi-\ncollinearity between covariates such as age and labor market\nparticipation by correlation analysis and collinearity statistics\ntests (tolerance and variance inflation factor tests) as suggested\nfor logistic regression (Allison, 2003). There was no significant\ncollinearity between any of the covariates. As we found a\nsignificant interaction between gender and living arrange-\nment in the case of both depression and suicidal ideation\n( p , .05), we present all results separately for men and women.\nTo verify whether there was a significant difference between\ngender groups, we performed statistical tests comparing logit\ncoefficients across groups (Allison, 1999) with the following\ntwo steps. First, we used Wald chi-square statistics to test the\ndifference in the coefficients between the gender-specific\nmodels. Second, we fitted disturbance variance unconstrained\nmodels to assess whether there was significant residual varia-\ntion across gender groups. All statistical analyses were pre-\nformed with SPSS (Version 12.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL) or SAS\n(Version 9, SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\nRESULTS\nTable 1 summarizes the descriptive information for our\nsample, as well as the age-adjusted, gender-stratified prevalence\nof mental health problems (depressive symptoms and suicidal\nideation). As expected, men reported significantly higher levels\nof educational attainment than women, as well as higher levels\nof active labor market participation. Men were less likely than\nwomen to belong to the bottom tertile of household income and\nwere also less likely to be living alone. In addition, as expected,\nmen were more likely than women to be current smokers and\ncurrent drinkers. In contrast, women were more likely than men\nto report physical illnesses. The majority of elders in our\nsample rated their health as either poor or very poor (74.9% of\nWomen reported significantly higher age-adjusted prevalence\nfor depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation than men. Among\nboth men and women, mental health problems were associated\nwith indicators of socioeconomic position in the expected\ndirections (i.e., lower educational attainment, lower equivalized\nhousehold income, and lower subjective socioeconomic status\nwere each associated with a higher prevalence of mental health\nproblems).Livingaloneoraspartof amultigenerationalhousehold\n(couples living with their children, elderly parents, or others) was\nalso associated with significantly elevated risks for mental health\nproblems compared to living with a spouse alone. Mental health\nproblems were similarly associated with other predictors in the\nexpected directions (e.g., a higher prevalence of depressive\nsymptoms and suicidal ideation was associated with a greater\nnumber of physical illnesses and poor self-rated health; Table 1).\nNext we examined gender differences as correlates of mental\nhealth problems. The adjusted ORs for depressive symptoms and\nsuicidal ideation stratified by gender showed some interesting\ndifferences. Living alone was strongly associated with de-\na multigenerational family without spouse was significantly\nassociated with depression in women and with suicidal ideation\nin both men and women. Gender difference was significant in\nliving arrangement by Wald chi-square test ( p , .05).\nAlthough the difference in effects by gender was not sta-\ntistically significant, being separated from the labor market was\nsignificantly associated with suicidal ideation in men (OR \u00bc\nlikely to report suicidal ideation in the past year than other\ngroups, whereas among former drinkers, higher depression\nwas reported by women; however, the difference in effects\nby gender was not statistically significant. In addition, lower\nequivalized household income was significantly associated with\npoor mental health in both men and women (Table 2). None of\nthe unconstrained models showed a significant disturbance\nvariance, suggesting that the differences in the coefficients\nbetween men and women had not arisen from differential\nresidual variation.\nDISCUSSION\nOur study revealed evidence of gender differences in\ncorrelates of mental health among older adults in Korea within\ntheir living arrangement. In addition, labor market participation\nwas a significant correlate among men but not among women.\nLower socioeconomic status was significantly associated with\npoor mental health in both men and women.\nResearchers have generally assumed that in cultures in which\nintergenerational ties are highly valued, coresidence with\nchildren has a positive influence on the mental health of elders.\nFor example, a study of people older than 65 in Spain, where\nchildren's obligation toward their elderly parents is a social\nnorm, reported that coresidence was associated with a low pre-\nvalence of depressive symptoms (Zunzunegui, Be\n\u00b4land, & Otero,\n2001). Similarly, studies in rural Taiwan (Wang, Snyder, & Kaas,\nextended family is culturally dominant, found a positive effect of\ncoresidence with children on mental health and physical well-\nbeing. In contrast, studies in the United States (Hughes & Waite,\nlater life is highly valued, found that coresidence with children\ncan be detrimental to the psychological well-being of elders. Our\nstudy shows that both older men and women living with other\nfamily members (e.g., children or aging parents) reported worse\nmental health than did those living with their spouses only. This\nfinding is consistent with the results from other studies that\nsuggested a social transition in Korea from multigenerational\ncoresidence as a standard living arrangement to a more\nWesternized family lifestyle with heightened values of privacy\nand independence (C. S. Kim & Rhee, 1997). Gender differences\narising from family living arrangements are even more striking if\nthe estimates are compared between living with children and\nliving alone. Compared to living with children, living alone\nappears detrimental to men, whereas living alone appears\nbeneficial to women. This suggested difference may be explained\nby the fact that older women are often expected to provide\nsupport and care for their grandchildren while their daughters or\ndaughters-in-law work outside the home. Today, working\nmarried women are much more common among younger couples\nin Korea (Brinton, Lee, & Parish, 1995). However, social support\nof child care for working mothers is lacking, and, as a result, child\ncare is often transferred to grandparents in the same household\n(Chae & Jeong, 2004). In a Korean study of parenting stress of\nmothers with infants aged 4 to 36 months delegated their caring\nresponsibility to their mothers or mothers-in-law. Living alone\nwas also associated with a three- to sixfold increase in the risks\nof depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among men but\nnot among women. When their spouses die, men lose many of\nthe benefits that wives provide, such as emotional support and\nthe maintenance of social contact with children and others\nTable 1.

Unlike our\nresults, the strong relationship between living alone and psy-\nchological distress in men was attenuated after adjusting for\nother social variables (i.e., unemployment, lack of social support,\nand household income) in a recent representative Finnish study\n(Joutsenniemi et al., 2006) and an American study (Hughes &\nWaite, 2002). In our sample, the more strongly gendered pattern\nof mental health among those living alone reflects the traditional\nnorms governing the roles of men and women in Korean society.\nIn our study, the harmful consequences of living with other\nwidowed people may partly reflect the influence of spousal loss\nJudd, 1997). The gender differences in the effects of being\nwidowed and living with others may partly account for the\nstronger adverse effects of depression on widowers than on\nTable 2.

According to data compiled by the UNDP (2005),\nKorean men spend 88% of their time in market activities and\n12% in nonmarket activities. In contrast, Korean women\nallocate 45% of their time to market activities and 55% to\nnonmarket activities. Although this degree of gender imbalance\nin time allocation is fairly typical of Asian societies (e.g., Japan,\nIndia), the division of labor between market and nonmarket\nactivities is shared much more equally among men and women\nin developed Western societies (UNDP, 2005). In other words,\ncompared to women, Korean men may be much more invested\nin their work, deriving status, authority, and meaning from their\nrole as primary breadwinner for their household. Consequently,\nseparation from work roles through either job loss or retirement\nmay be more detrimental to the mental health of men than it is\nto that of women.\nIn sum, gender difference in the effects of living arrange-\nments and labor market participation on mental health among\nelderly Koreans seems to result from two sources specific to\nKorean society: men's strong traditional social roles that are\nlost later in life and women's traditional social burdens that are\nintensified later in life. In addition, the social transition in Korea\nhas increased women's labor participation and has added a new\nburden to their traditional burden of child care, which now\noverflows to the older generation.\nTurning to other correlates of mental health, our findings\ndemonstrate the importance of household income for mental\nhealth among both older men and women. This result is con-\nsistent with the results of other studies in Korea (Bae, Kim, &\nHo, & Woo, 2005). In contrast, evidence relating income to\nmental health among elderly individuals in Western developed\ncountries is less consistent. Researchers have observed no\nassociation of income with depression in some U.S. studies\nfound this association in other studies (Kahn & Fazio, 2005).\nThe finding of a strong association between household income\nand mental health in Korea may be explained, in part, by\ninadequate social safety nets for elders. For example, only\n12.4% of elderly Koreans receive a public pension, and only\n15.6% of these pensioners receive a pension designed to help\nprotect elderly people with low incomes who are excluded from\nthe National Pension Scheme (National Pension Service and\nKorea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, 2005). Thus, the\nfamily still remains the traditional unit for the care and support\nof elders, who tend to live with their children, predominantly\nwith their sons (J. S. Kim, 2005). Taking care of elders has\nbecome a burden for low-income families, especially since the\n1997 economic crisis that has deepened income inequality in\nReaders should consider several limitations when interpret-\ning our results. First, our data were cross-sectional, so we\ncannot rule out reverse causation for several of the associations\nwe found. For example, mental health problems could\nprecipitate job loss and early retirement, rather than vice versa.\nPeople with mental health problems may also tend not to marry\nor may become separated from their spouses, and thus may\nmore frequently live alone. However, we would have expected\nthese biases to operate similarly for men and women, whereas\nwe found a strong association only among men and not among\nwomen. This suggests that some other process is at work\nbesides social selection alone.\nOur measures were also limited in several respects. The\nKNHANES survey included information on living arrangement\nonly. No detailed information was available on such factors as the\nhousehold division of labor, caregiving burdens, availability of\nsocial support, and expectations of reciprocity. Further studies are\nneeded to examine how such variables could explain gender\ndifferences in mental health, as well as the relationships between\nwork and home conflicts and mental health. Finally, our study was\nlimited with respect to the single-item measures used to assess\nmental health problems. Although the single-item assessments\nprobably had limited reliability, we nevertheless demonstrated\nthat each outcome (depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation)\nwas associated with known predictors in the expected directions.\nIn summary, this study provides support for the evidence of\ndifferential impact of social resources in mental health between\nmen and women and suggests that social components of gender\ndifferences in mental health may differ across diverse cultures.\nWe invite more empirical evidence from diverse cultural settings,\nespecially from Asian societies, to substantiate this finding.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nAddress correspondence to Soong-Nang Jang, PhD, Center for Aging\nand Population Research, Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul\nNational University, 28 Yeongun-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, Republic of\nKorea.
