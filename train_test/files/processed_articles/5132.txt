For more than a century, psychologists have tried to measure them\nand to evaluate their impact on social and interpersonal processes. More recently, a large\nnumber of meta-analyses have become available to researchers, thus offering a valuable\nyardstick against which to assess the magnitude of psychological sex differences. The\nresults have been widely variable, but a pattern clearly stands out: Most of the studies find\nrather high levels of statistical overlap between the male and female distributions, with\nconventionally \"large\" effects being the exception rather than the rule. This applies to\nstudies of spatial abilities (overall Cohen's d = .37; Voyer, Voyer, and Bryden, 1995), self-\nSex differences\ndisclosure (d = .18; Dindia and Allen, 1992), self-esteem (d = .21; Kling, Hyde, Showers,\naggression (overall d = .24; Bettencourt and Miller, 1996), and the list could go on. Hyde\n(2005) conducted a second order meta-analysis of sex differences on 128 published meta-\nanalyses, and found that 78% of all the effect sizes fell below a standardized mean\ndifference of d = .35, which is conventionally regarded as \"small to moderate\". In terms of\nstatistical overlap, d = .35 means that--assuming normality--the male and female\ndistributions share about 75% of their joint area (Cohen, 1988). Hyde used this result in\nsupport of the \"gender similarities hypothesis\", i.e., that males and females are similar\nrather than different on most psychological variables. While Hyde's analysis has been\ncriticized for omitting some large-effect studies and for not organizing variables in\nbiologically relevant categories (Davies and Shackelford, 2006; Lippa, 2006), it is true that\nthe effects reported in the empirical research often seem to imply little statistical separation\nbetween male and female distributions.\nIs this a valid assessment of the data? And most importantly, should we care? I\nsurmise that, if we want to build a comprehensive evolutionary theory of sex differences,\nwe need to proceed in two directions at once: On one hand, we should aim to build more\ndetailed models, develop finer distinctions between functionally distinct subtypes of traits\nand behaviors, and identify the specific contexts in which sex differences are magnified or\nreduced. On the other hand, we should try to measure the global patterns of sex differences\nin different areas of human psychology, and use the quantitative information carried by\neffect sizes to better understand the selective processes that have shaped our male and\nfemale minds. In addition, comparing the magnitude of effect sizes across different\npsychological domains may provide useful support in the evaluation of competing\nexplanatory hypotheses on the origin and function of mental and behavioral traits (see\nbelow).\nIn the present article I will argue that mainstream research has severely\nunderestimated the magnitude of human sex differences by failing to fully appreciate the\nmultidimensional nature of many psychological constructs. I will then show how to address\nthis shortcoming by calculating multivariate indices of effect size (ES). In particular, I will\nintroduce the multivariate generalization of Cohen's d: the Mahalanobis distance D, a\nstandardized mean difference calculated simultaneously on k correlated variables. Finally, I\nwill illustrate the practical import of multivariate ESs with two reanalyses of published\ndatasets on sex differences in personality and aggression.\nThe interpretation of effect sizes\nWith few exceptions, psychological researchers adhere to the convention of\ninterpreting the magnitude of group differences after a set of guidelines supposedly\nrecommended by Cohen (1988). As the convention goes, d = .20 represents a \"small\"\neffect, d = .50 is a \"moderate\" effect, and group differences of d = .80 or more are \"large\".\nMany would be surprised to learn that Cohen (1988) did, in fact, advise against the use of\nconventional ES measures; he reluctantly proposed his famous guidelines as a last-resort\napproximation to employ when researchers need to perform power analysis, but have no\nprevious information on the investigated variables (see also Hedges, 2008). Indeed, there is\nno justification in statistical theory or methodology for using such conventional labels in\nthe interpretation of research findings; it is impossible to evaluate the practical magnitude\nSex differences\nof an effect size without considering the theoretical relationship between variables, their\nmeasurement error, an the context in which they are measured and analyzed (see e.g.,\nstatistically small deviation from a set value may have important consequences (think of\nthe rigidly controlled mechanisms that regulate body temperature), while in others even\n\"large\" differences may be inconsequential or comparatively small (e.g., a drug reducing\ndepressive symptoms by d = .80, when all other drugs on the market reduce them by d = 2\nor more).\nThe practical significance of a difference between means also depends on where\none is looking: differences that have almost undetectable effects in the central region of a\ndistribution can be amplified by orders of magnitude as one moves toward the distribution\nextremes. For example, even if males (on average) were only slightly superior to females in\ntheir visuo-spatial abilities, the male:female ratio would increase dramatically when\nconsidering people with extremely high levels of the same abilities. Whereas such a small\ndifference might have virtually no consequence in most aspects of everyday life, it could\nstill determine large sex biases in specialized contexts where high visuo-spatial abilities are\nrequired (e.g., skilled hunting in traditional societies). This distribution-tail effect is often\ncompounded by the larger variance exhibited by males in many psychological traits,\nperhaps especially in those with a history of strong sexual selection (Archer and\nMehdikhani, 2003; see also Halpern et al., 2007). Finally, division-of-labor social and\ninterpersonal processes may amplify initially small psychological sex differences, ending\nup in large differences in the actual behavior of the two sexes (e.g., Becker, 1991).\nEffect sizes and the evolutionary psychology of sex differences\nEvolutionary theory provides reasons to expect reliable sex differences in\npersonality, cognition, and behavior (see Buss, 2004; Geary, 1998), and evolutionary\npsychological research has often focused on the adaptive value of male-female differences\nSilverman and Eals, 1992). Although current models are still too coarse to make\nquantitative predictions about the absolute magnitude of sex differences, it is already\npossible to generate several predictions on their relative magnitude in different traits or\nconstructs. First of all, the strongest psychological sex differences are expected \u00ad and found\n\u00ad in reproduction-related traits and in those subject to divergent sexual selection pressures\npreferences ESs are often in the d = .80 \u00ad 1.50 range (Buss, 1995), higher that those found\nin most other psychological domains. Careful application of sexual selection theory\nsuggests additional, subtler predictions: As discussed by Miller (2000), sex differences in a\nsexually selected trait are likely to be small (or even nonexistent) if (1) the trait is subject to\nreciprocal mate choice, or (2) both sexes need to possess the same psychological\nmachinery, in order for members of one sex to evaluate the quality of the trait when it is\nexpressed by members of the other sex.\nImportantly, several psychological constructs that on the surface may appear\nunrelated to reproduction turn out to be involved in mating as well. For example, Big Five\npersonality traits show remarkable evidence of reciprocal sexual selection and assortative\nmating (reviewed in Figueredo et al., 2005). At the same time, some of the same traits are\nlinked to sex-typical mating strategies: Both openness to experience and extraversion\nSex differences\npredict increased numbers of sexual partners (Miller and Tal, 2007; Nettle, 2005), and\nmales might be expected to show higher average levels of these traits in many (but not all)\necological contexts (see Gangestad, Haselton and Buss, 2006; Gangestad and Simpson,\n2000; Schmitt, 2008). Similarly, sex differences in visuo-spatial abilities may have been\nindirectly shaped by sexual selection because of the involvement of these abilities in sex-\ntypical activities that contributed to mating success, such as hunting (Silverman and Eals,\n1992). Effect sizes can be used to compare the magnitude of sex differences among\ndifferent psychological constructs and, potentially, to adjudicate between alternative\nexplanations of their evolution (e.g., a model involving reciprocal mate choice versus one\npositing divergent sexual selection pressures). Depending on the level of analysis, effect\nsize comparisons can involve narrow traits such as extraversion or physical aggression, as\nwell as complex multidimensional constructs such as mate preferences or personality.\nMultidimensional effect sizes can also be useful when evaluating the magnitude of\nsex differences across different social and ecological contexts. For example, there is\nevidence that sex differences in personality traits vary among cultures (Costa et al., 2001);\nhowever, this may or may not translate in a change in the overall statistical overlap between\nmale and female personality profiles, since different combinations of univariate sex\ndifferences may result in the same overall ES. The study of ecological variation in the\noverall patterns of sex similarity/difference has fascinating evolutionary implications; in\nthis context, multivariate indices can be a valuable addition to standard univariate\nmeasures, and can be employed in cross-cultural studies to explore variation at a level\nhigher than that of individual variables.\nAnother potential application of multivariate effect sizes is in the study of the folk\npsychology of sex differences. Are people's perceptions of sex differences basically\naccurate, or are they prone to distortion by socially transmitted stereotypes? To begin\nanswering this question, one has to know how large sex differences are in the first place;\nand the case can be made that overall, multidimensional sex differences (for example in\npersonality or aggression) may be a more natural and intuitive metric than differences in\nthe narrowly specified, individual traits measured by psychologists. It is then possible that\nwhat appear as inflated stereotypes (Hyde, 2005) might actually turn out to be realistic and\naccurate representations of the overall statistical distance between male and female profiles.\nSuch findings would be highly relevant to the evolutionary study of social cognition, folk\npsychology, and social learning.\nFinally, the rhetorical impact of effect sizes should not be underestimated. The\nargument that males and females possess evolved, sexually differentiated psychologies has\nbeen met with especially strong skepticism (e.g., Buller, 2005; Eagly and Wood, 1999);\nfindings of \"small\" effect sizes tend to reinforce the skepticism by suggesting that sex\ndifferences are trivial, unimportant, or too small to be of \"real\" biological significance (see\nfor example some of the commentaries to Del Giudice, 2009). While this kind of\ninterpretation is often unwarranted and based on inadequate criteria (see above), the present\nreality is that most researchers are likely to be intrigued by a \"large\" ES much more than by\na \"small\" one. Showing that the overall sex differences in constructs such as aggression or\npersonality are substantially larger than previously assumed can alert many researchers to\nthe fact that sex differences are not an ignorable nuisance of human psychology, but a\nrobust phenomenon deserving satisfactory theoretical explanation.\nSex differences\nThe logic of multivariate differences\nAs stated in the introduction, the standard approach to the evaluation of sex\ndifferences dramatically underestimates their overall magnitude when dealing with\nmultidimensional psychological constructs. The common procedure employed in meta-\nanalyses of sex differences goes as follows: (1) sex differences are measured on a set of\nvariables making up an integrated, multidimensional construct (e.g. the Big Five\npersonality factors, multiple measures of aggression, or a battery of visuo-spatial tasks); (2)\nsex differences on these variables are not combined into a multivariate effect size, but\nconsidered only one at a time; and (3) an average measure of the univariate effect sizes is\ntaken, and is then treated as an estimate of the overall sex difference in the investigated\nconstruct.\nWhy is this procedure inadequate? When measuring a multidimensional construct,\nthe overall difference between two groups is not the average of the effects measured on\neach dimension, but a combination of those effects in the multidimensional space: Many\nsmall differences, each of them on a different dimension, can create an impressive effect\nwhen all the dimensions are considered simultaneously. Crucially, such overall differences\nare likely to matter more than their individual components, both in shaping people's\nperceptions and in affecting social interaction. A geometric example may help at this point\n(Figure 1): Consider a cube with edges of length 1, where the three dimensions correspond\nto three uncorrelated personality traits (labeled A, B and C), and make vertex M the\nposition of the male group on the three traits. Now imagine that vertex F represents the\nmeans of females on the same three traits, so that the female mean on each trait is equal to\nthe male mean plus one. The average sex difference on the three traits is, of course, equal to\none; however, the length of segment MF (i.e., the actual distance between males and\nfemales in this three-dimensional space) is the square root of 3, that is, MF  1.73. Failing\nto combine univariate sex differences into a proper multivariate measure leads, in this\nsimple case with just three dimensions, to underestimate the overall male-female difference\nby 42%. In other words, the overall sex difference in this fictional personality space is\nalmost twice as large as the sex differences observed on each of the three personality\nfactors. Note that this example assumes orthogonal (uncorrelated) dimensions: If the\ndimensions were correlated, then the overall sex difference could become larger or smaller\nthan the one just calculated, depending on the specific pattern of correlations (see below).\nSex differences\nFigure 1. Geometric illustration of the difference between univariate and multivariate\ndistances.\nNote: The cube represents a hypothetical three-factor personality space with orthogonal\nfactors.\nA multivariate effect size: The Mahalanobis distance\nThe Mahalanobis distance D (Mahalanobis, 1936) is a generalized distance metric\ncalculated on two or more correlated variables. Like the popular Cohen's d, it is a\nstandardized distance, i.e., distances are expressed in terms of the standard deviation of the\nmeasured variables. Let there be a set of k variables, and let d be a column vector of length\nk whose elements are the between-group differences on each variable; D is given by\nd\nS\n' -\n=\nwhere S is the covariance matrix of the k variables. If d is a vector of standardized\ndifferences (i.e., Cohen's d's), then S is the correlation matrix. If the variables are\northogonal, D reduces to the euclidean distance between groups; if k = 1, D reduces to\nCohen's d. In addition to estimating between-group distances, D can be used to measure the\ndistance between two cases or between a group and a case; in this last form, it is often\nemployed to detect outlier cases (see Huberty, 2005 for an introduction; De Maesschalck,\nJouan-Rimbaud and Massart, 2000 for a more technical treatment). The Mahalanobis\ndistance is closely related to Hotelling's t2, a common multivariate statistic for two-group\ncomparison.\nThe interpretation of D is straightforward, as it represents the difference between\ntwo groups in terms of the standard deviation of the multivariate distribution. Thus, the\ninterpretation of its magnitude is the same as that of Cohen's d; for example, if D = 1, the\ntwo groups are one (multivariate) standard deviation apart. When the k variables are\ncorrelated, the standard deviation can be represented by an ellipsoid; D refers to the\nstandard deviation in the direction given by the two group centroids. Figure 2 illustrates the\neffect of correlations on D in the case of two variables. The main difference between d and\nD is that the latter is an unsigned coefficient (always positive), and as such cannot be used\nto test directional predictions. To understand the pattern of directional differences between\nSex differences\ngroups, one has to refer to univariate d values; thus, univariate and multivariate ESs should\nbe seen as complementary rather than alternative tools.\nFigure 2. The effect of correlations on the magnitude of D, illustrated in the bivariate case.\nNote: Small circles indicate group means on the two variables (group centroids); the\nstandard deviations of the bivariate normal distributions are shown as ellipses. Panel A\nshows two orthogonal variables: the standard deviation is the same in all directions\n(ellipses reduce to circles), and D reduces to the euclidean distance, D = .72 (grey line). In\npanels B and C the two variables are correlated (r = +.5 and r = -.5, respectively); whereas\nunivariate differences between means (d) are the same in the three cases, D becomes larger\nin panel B (about one standard deviation) and smaller in panel C. Notice that larger D's\ncorrespond to smaller overlap between distributions, that is, higher statistical separation\nbetween the two groups.\nAs with Cohen's d, Mahalanobis D can be translated into approximate measures of\nstatistical overlap by assuming multivariate normality. The overlapping coefficient OVL\nrepresents the proportion of each distribution that is shared with the other distribution, and\nis given by\nwhere  \n() is the CDF of the standard normal distribution (Bradley, 2006; Reiser, 2001).\nThe OVL coefficient can be easily converted to Cohen's index of nonoverlap U1\n; whereas\nOVL is calculated on a single group, U1\nis calculated on the joint distribution of the two\ngroups:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n-\n=\nOVL\nOVL\nU\nFor consistency with the psychological literature (e.g., Hyde, 2005), in the present\narticle I will always report (1 - U1\n) as an index of overlap. If desired, exact confidence\nalternatively, using bootstrap procedures. An R script for computing D estimates and exact\nconfidence intervals is available for download at the website:\nSex differences\nhttp://www.psych.unito.it/csc/pers/delgiudice/pdf/mahalanobis.zip .\nWhen applied to k correlated variables making up a multidimensional construct, the\nMahalanobis distance D is almost invariably larger than any of the corresponding\nunivariate d's, and will thus give a larger effect size (ES) estimate than simply taking an\naverage value of d. The only exception occurs when the variables are perfectly correlated\n(i.e., when the construct is in fact unidimensional).\nA simple calculation will help the reader get an intuitive feeling of the expected\nincrease in effect size when computing the D index instead of relying solely on univariate\nd's. Imagine that a researcher was investigating sex differences in aggression, and that\nhe/she had measured a number of different aggression-related variables. Also imagine that\nthose variables were completely uncorrelated with one another, and that the standardized\nsex difference was exactly the same on all the variables, a conventionally \"small\" d = .25.\nIn this case, the size of Mahalanobis D only depends on k, the number of variables\nmeasured by the researcher. Since the variables are orthogonal, D reduces to the euclidean\ndistance and the overall ES is given by D = .25 k . With two variables, the overall sex\ndifference would be D = .35. If the variables were three, D would equal .43. For five\nuncorrelated variables, D = .56; and if the researcher had measured participants on ten\ndifferent aggression variables, each showing a univariate d = .25, the overall ES would be\nD = .79. As noted earlier, relatively small differences on many dimensions can add up to a\nremarkable overall effect. Finally, adding correlations among variables could make D\nlarger or smaller (sometimes substantially so), depending on the exact pattern of\ncorrelations (see Figure 2).\nIn summary, computing multivariate effect sizes will give researchers a more\naccurate estimate of the overall difference between males and females on any truly\nmultidimensional construct. First, the standard procedure almost invariably leads to\nunderestimate the magnitude of sex differences construct-wise, and such underestimation\nbias becomes more severe as the number of measured variables increases. Second, there\nsimply is no way of properly taking into account the effect of correlations between\nvariables without calculating a multivariate effect size such as D.\nExample 1: Sex differences in personality\nI will now turn to a real-world example that strikingly demonstrates the importance\nof calculating multivariate effect sizes in addition to univariate ones.

In fact, multivariate effect sizes tell a rather different story. I reanalyzed the same\ndata (kindly provided by E. Noftle, personal communication) by calculating the\nMahalanobis distance from Cohen's d values and the correlation matrix of the five BFI\nscales (calculations were performed in R 2.7.2; R Development Core Team, 2008)3. As\nshown in Table 1, the overall male-female difference on the construct defined by the five\npersonality scales was D = .84 (with a 95% upper bound of .87)4. Correcting for scale\nunreliability raised the estimated ES to Dc\n= .98, i.e., a sex difference of about one standard\ndeviation. The corresponding overlap between the male and female distributions is about\n45%; the statistical separation between the sexes in the Big Five personality space is clearly\nmuch larger than could be inferred by looking at individual scales one at a time. Given that\n3 To avoid the spurious effect of sex on whole-sample correlations, the correlation matrix\nused to calculate D was obtained by pooling within-sex correlation matrices using weighted\nmeans, as suggested by Hunter and Schmidt (2004): rpooled\n=\nF\nM\nF\nF\nM\nM\nN\nN\nN\nr\nN\nr\n+\n+\n.\n4 In some instances, the lower bound of the confidence interval cannot be estimated with\nexact methods; however, it is often possible to compute one-sided confidence bounds, as in\nthis case. See Reiser (2001) for discussion and simulations.\nSex differences\nboth d values and inter-scale correlations in Noftle and Shaver's study are typical of\npersonality research, this result is most likely to generalize to the entire field of sex\ndifferences in personality traits.\nExample 2: Sex differences in aggression\nIn a recent article, Archer (in press) discussed the hypothesis that sexual selection is\nresponsible for the consistent pattern of sex differences observed in same-sex human\naggression. He presented a summary of the meta-analytic findings in aggression research\n(Table 2 in Archer, in press) clearly showing that males are higher than females in physical\nand verbal aggression, and lower in indirect (or \"relational\") aggression. The average effect\nsizes on the three aggression dimensions, pooled across assessment methods (e.g.,\nobservation, self report, teacher report), are shown in Table 2 (they were virtually identical\nto the median effect sizes and to the combined effect estimates by Knight, Guthrie, Page,\nand Fabes, 2002, thus confirming their robustness as overall estimates). The largest sex\ndifferences are found in physical aggression (average d = .58), the smallest in relational\naggression (average d = \u00ad.16). While it is important to discriminate between different\naspects of aggression and to interpret the univariate effect sizes one at a time, it can also\nuseful to ask how much males and females differ in their overall aggression profiles. The\naverage univariate effect size module is d = .34; correcting for attenuation by assuming\nmeasurement reliability equal to .80 (a realistic estimate for psychological measures)\nproduces a slightly higher average of dc\nIn order to compute D, an estimate of the correlations between different types of\naggression is needed. For the purposes of this illustrative example, rough estimates of\ntypical correlation magnitude can be obtained by surveying the relevant literature.\nCorrelations between physical and verbal aggression are typically around .40, ranging from\nAcquarini, and Di Ceglie, 2003; Harris, 1997; Meesters, Muris, Bosma, Schouten, and\nBeuving, 1996). Very similar correlations are found between physical and indirect\naggression (from about .20 to .55; Miller, Vaillancourt and Boyle, 2008; Ostrov, Ries,\nStauffacher, Godleski, and Mullins, 2008; Vaillancourt, Brendgen, Boivin, and Tremblay,\n2003). A correlation coefficient of .40 was chosen as a reasonable approximation of both\ncorrelations. There are fewer published data on the correlation between verbal and indirect\naggression; however, the overall correlation between direct (physical plus verbal) and\nindirect aggression was estimated at .60 in the meta-analysis by Card and colleagues\n(2008). I computed D twice, using two different estimates of the verbal-indirect correlation:\nthe .60 coefficient reported by Card et al. (2008) and a more conservative .40 (i.e., the same\ncorrelation as that between physical and indirect aggression).\nSex differences\nTable 2.

Effect sizes\nare shown before and after correcting for scale unreliablity, assuming all reliability\ncoefficients equal to .80. Negative effect sizes indicate higher scores in females.\nAs shown in Table 2, the estimated overall sex difference in aggression is D = .75 \u00ad\n.80. Assuming .80 reliability, the disattenuated estimate is Dc\nmales and females differ about one standard deviation in their overall aggression profiles.\nThis corresponds to a statistical overlap of about 44 \u00ad 49%. Despite the error margin due to\nthe rough estimates of correlations and reliabilities, this illustrative re-analysis indicates\nthat the overall size of sex differences in human aggression may be more than twice as\nlarge as the average of the univariate ESs.\nLimitations\nThe above examples show that proper aggregation of effect sizes can reveal\nsubstantial sex differences in multivariate psychological constructs. Of course, this does not\nmean that aggregation will always be useful or meaningful. I want to underline once again\nthat I'm not proposing to automatically substitute univariate ESs with their multivariate\ncounterparts; rather, the latter offer a complementary source of information, one that can be\nmore or less interesting depending on the research question at hand. Most evolutionary\nhypotheses are highly domain-specific, and may be best answered by comparisons on\nsingle variables. In some instances, differences between males and females may be\nqualitative rather than quantitative, with distinct processes at work in the two sexes; clearly,\nin such cases any simple calculation of effect sizes (univariate or multivariate) would be\nuninformative or even misleading.\nMethodological remarks\nBefore concluding, I will briefly discuss some additional methodological aspects of\nusing D as a summary effect size. First of all, the reader may be wondering about the\nrelationship between the number of measured variables and the magnitude of D. If D tends\nto increase with the number of variables making up the construct of interest, won't\nSex differences\naggregating large number of variables produce inflated estimates of sex differences? To\nanswer this question, one has to remember that D depends on the pattern of correlations\nbetween variables in addition to their number. Imagine that researcher A measures\npersonality using only 5 scales, whereas researcher B employs 30 different scales. The 30\nscales of researcher B are likely to show more content overlap with one another, and larger\nbetween-scale correlations; if the many scales he/she uses are psychometrically redundant,\nthis will lead to relatively smaller estimates of D. In other words, adding variables\ncontributes to D only as long as they provide new information about sex differences.\nConversely, if the \"true\" dimensionality of that personality space is closer to 30 than to 5,\nand/or if some of the 30 scales reveal interesting sex effects that are masked in the 5 scales\nof researcher A, then researcher B may correctly get a higher estimate of the overall sex\ndifference. The issue of how many variables to aggregate is, at bottom, a theoretical one:\nCareful definition of the traits under investigation is essential to ensure that the chosen\nvariables provide a satisfactory coverage of the intended construct.\nThat said, it is true that sampling error will tend to inflate estimates of D when large\nnumbers of variables are aggregated together. Even if all the univariate sex differences in\nthe population were equal to zero, it would be virtually impossible that all the sample d's\nturned out exactly zero as well. The same phenomenon leads to inflated R2 estimates when\nadding large numbers of independent variables to a multiple regression model. For this\nreason, when computing multivariate effect sizes researchers should (1) avoid including\nunnecessary or clearly redundant variables, and/or reduce the dimensionality of the\nconstruct via factor analysis; (2) in particular, keep the number of variables small when\nsample size is not large; and (3) when possible, compute confidence intervals on D to check\nthe reliability of the estimate.\nFinally, a note on correlation matrices: sometimes sex differences in two or more\nvariables create spurious correlations between those variables that can muddle up the\ninterpretation of D. For example, imagine that females were both more nurturing and less\ndominant than males, but that nurturance and dominance were otherwise completely\nunrelated within each sex. When computing whole-sample statistics, dominance and\nnurturance would be negatively correlated, but that would be solely due to sex differences\nin the two variables. Using the overall correlation coefficient to compute D would count the\neffect of sex differences twice, thus biasing the result in potentially misleading ways. For\nthis reason, it seems advisable not to use whole-sample correlation matrices when\ncomputing Mahalanobis D to measure sex differences; whenever possible, a better estimate\nof correlations (unbiased by between-group differences) can be obtained by computing\nseparate correlation matrices for males and females, then pooling them with one of the\navailable methods. Of course, computing a pooled estimate is only meaningful if the\nwithin-sex correlation matrices are reasonably similar to one another.\nConclusion\nCurrent research practices lead to inadequate assessment of the overall\npsychological differences between males and females; relatively small univariate\ndifferences are taken at face value, without properly aggregating them into multivariate ES\nindices. When differences are measured on multidimensional constructs, multivariate\nindices will almost invariably produce larger estimates of the statistical distance between\nSex differences\nthe sexes. Luckily, the appropriate multivariate ES indices are readily available, although\nseldom presented in data analysis textbooks; the Mahalanobis distance D is a highly\nintuitive measure of multivariate differences between groups, and has the same basic\ninterpretation of Cohen's d.\nIn this article I argued that accurate assessment of the magnitude of sex differences\ncan foster progress in evolutionary research; indeed, I believe that evolutionary\npsychologists are especially likely to benefit from better measurement in this area. While\nthe available models are still rudimentary in some respects, they already make it possible to\npredict the relative weight of sex differences between different psychological domains; and\nas theory will grow more sophisticated, empirical tests will increasingly depend on accurate\nquantification of between-sex variation, thus making effect size computation ever more\nimportant. I hope the present article will contribute to bring this important topic to the\nattention of researchers interested in human sex differences; I also hope it will prompt\npsychologists (regardless of their theoretical background) to challenge the received wisdom\nand consider the possibility that, taken as groups, human males and females are more\ndifferent from one another than we currently believe.\n"
