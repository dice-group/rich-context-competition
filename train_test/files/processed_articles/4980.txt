The data show that there\nis a statistically significant difference in the achievement of African American and Hispanic students compared with their\nCaucasian and Asian academic counterparts. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to describe the implications of\nthe gap in achievement for young urban adults. The participants were five African American students who had dropped out\nof traditional school. These students described their academic decline through interviews and focus group sessions at two\nalternative educational sites. The data were collected and the results indicated that the students felt disconnected from their\nteachers and the process of education. As a result of this disconnection, they became adrift in the educational system and\nwere eventually swallowed by the undertow.\n",

The research indicates, however, that African Americans\nbegin schooling at a tremendous disadvantage. If education\nand success are synonymous, the lack of an education is tan-\ntamount to a lifetime of frustration. According to Jencks and\nAfrican Americans score lower than European Americans on\nvocabulary, reading, and math tests, as well as on tests that claim\nto measure scholastic aptitude and intelligence. The gap appears\nbefore children enter kindergarten and it persists into adulthood.\nIt has narrowed since 1970; however, the typical American\nBlack still scores below 75 percent of American Whites. There\nis a lot of overlap between the two groups. Nonetheless, the test\nscore gap is large enough to have significant social and economic\nconsequences. (p. 24)\nJohnson (2002) further interjected that despite a multitude\nof school reform efforts directed at closing the gap in\nachievement, we begin the 21st century with the same prob-\nlem. These gaps are in evidence with large percentages of\nlow-income African American, Latino, and Native American\nstudents when compared with their middle- and high-income\nCaucasian and Asian counterparts.\nThe purpose of this phenomenological study was to\ndescribe the implications of the gap in academic achieve-\nment for young urban adults. The achievement gap will gen-\nerally be defined as the discrepancy in academic achievement\namong different groups of students. The gaps appear by\nincome, race, and ethnicity.\nThis review of the literature was designed to determine\nthe research currently available to address this discrepancy,\nand future research needed to gain a total perspective of the\neconomic, social, and political issues involved in this educa-\ntional conundrum. This research study has been conducted to\nanswer the following research question, \"How has the gap in\nacademic achievement impacted the lives of young urban\nadults?\"\nA considerable body of knowledge suggests that the pur-\npose of education is to provide each student with the oppor-\ntunity to excel.

Because educational attainment is posi-\ntively correlated with life achievement, schools play a sig-\nnificant role in the lives of children.\nEmpirically, too, there is substantial scholarly evidence\nthat the challenges of providing equal access to all students\nare of sizable measure in public education. According to\nHunter and Bartee (2003), \"Public schools face critical chal-\nlenges when defining equitable access and equality of oppor-\ntunity for racial minorities in today's standardized system of\neducation\" (p. 151). These standardized assessments link\naccess and opportunity to contrived outcomes aligned with\nthose in power. Placing blame in a wagon and leaving it at\nthe urban schoolhouse door is a single-sided view of educa-\ntional reform. Using standardized tests as battering rams will\nnot bridge the gap in academic achievement because the root\nsystem goes far deeper than these simplistic, topical solu-\ntions. According to Hunter and Bartee, \"Closing the perfor-\nmance gap between the racial minorities and the racial\nmajority in schools requires more systemic and institutional\napproaches that cannot be achieved through standardized\nBoykin and Noguera (2011) asserted, \"What has become\nincreasingly clear is that doing more of what hasn't worked\nover the last eight years is unlikely to produce a different set\nof results.\" They continued, \"Requiring public reports of test\nscore results by race has exposed the lack of focus on educa-\ntional equity, even though the law does nothing to help\nschool districts address the problem\" (p. 140). The need to\nprovide effective educators is underscored by Ladson-\nMoreover, Lipman (2004) stated, \"To me it just seems\nobvious that guiding kids in the process of becoming lifelong\ncritical thinkers, learners, readers, leaders, and participants\nfor change is not related and cannot be `measured' on a stan-\ndardized test bereft of context\" (p. 1). Burbridge (1991) has\nidentified in her study that socioeconomic status, more than\nany other variable, determines educational outcomes. V. E.\nLee and Burkam (2002) further corroborated the importance\nof socioeconomic status, as did Payne (2005). Bainbridge\nand Lasley (2002) indicated, \"Far more relevant than race or\ngender as academic predictors are the education levels of stu-\ndents' parents (as well as other adults) and family socioeco-\nUhlenberg and Brown (2002) further explored the causes\nof the gap in academic achievement. Extending a multifac-\neted theory that takes into consideration the child, parenting\nand the home environment, the teacher, and the schools helps\nus to see that addressing this issue will require a multifaceted\napproach. This research aligns with the theory offered by\nlooked at several variables that contribute to the gap in aca-\ndemic achievement. Through in-depth observations and\ninterviews conducted with a purposeful sample that com-\nprised members of upper-middle-class, working-class, and\npoor families, Lareau determined that social class is the most\npowerful influence in the lives of children. This theme influ-\nences the organization of daily life, the use of language, and\nthe interaction between families and institutions. These\nthemes governed activities such as participation in outside\nactivities, requesting a specific teacher, and selecting a cer-\ntain school, and knowledge of professionals in a capacity to\nprovide assistance and services. Utilizing the social domi-\nnance theory, Van Laar and Sidanius (2001) reiterated the\nresearch of the powerlessness inherent in low social status.\nThis powerlessness, in turn, leads to the low academic per-\nformance of the disenfranchised.\nFurthermore, in a study conducted by Ladson-Billings\n(2001), the important role of the teacher in closing the gap in\nstudent performance is reiterated. High expectations on the\npart of the teacher, aligned with a positive relationship, will\nprovide the academic foundation necessary for educational\nsuccess. Talbert-Johnson (2004) identified the structural\ninequalities in urban schools. The redeeming factor will be\nproviding professional development that will increase the\npedagogical skills of the teachers on staff. Ferguson (2003)\nhas studied the achievement gap extensively. The Tripod\nProject is his effort to eliminate this gap through a rigorous\ncurriculum, rich in academic content and high standards for\nmastery, provided by teachers who have developed positive\nrelationships with their students, utilizing an effective,\nresearch-based instructional pedagogy. Unfortunately,\nUhlenberg and Brown (2002) have identified low expecta-\ntions on the part of classroom teachers as a continuing prob-\nlem in their research. Furthermore, their study determined\nthat Black students seem to be more sensitive to their teach-\ners' perceptions than their White counterparts.\nNotwithstanding, Carter (2005) provided research that\noffers a different perspective on the manner in which culture\nis used to explain the engagement of urban minority students.\nAccording to Carter, culture is a critical feature in the lives of\nurban children. The full spectrum of cultural interactions\nspans the range of social and political responses to school-\ning. Rather than marginalizing and minimizing the import of\nculture in the psyche of urban minority students, we should\nchoose instead to understand it in relationship to socializa-\ntion processes in our educational institutions. We must\nrespect our children for who they are and give credence to\nthe journey they have traveled to secure their identity.\nHowever, to move them to the next level, we must set high\nstandards for academic achievement and high levels of\nexpectation for content mastery. Fryer and Torelli (2005)\nfocused on the important impact of culture in closing the gap\nin academic achievement. Thernstrom and Thernstrom\n(2003) have written a book titled No Excuses: Closing the\nRacial Gap in Learning, in which they state,\nExcellent schools deliver a clear message to their students: No\nExcuses. No excuses for failing to do your homework, failing to\nwork hard in general; no excuses for fighting with other students,\nrunning in the hallways, dressing inappropriately, and so forth.\nAmericans need to say to their schools as well: No Excuses.\nGiven the challenges urban students face, more money well\nspent could improve education. But it does not cost more to set\nhigh academic and behavioral standards, and inadequate funding\nand overcrowded classes do not explain the racial gap. Neither\ndoes racial isolation. Family poverty is no excuse for failing to\nAccordingly, the research on the gap in academic achieve-\nment is replete with causes and possible solutions. There is,\nhowever, a paucity of research on the student casualties of\nthis educational and sociological disconnection. The discon-\nnection begins with the inability to gain meaningful employ-\nment and ends with economic and social disenfranchisement.\nThis qualitative study depicted, in detail, the educational\nexperiences of five students who fell through the gap in\nachievement. These are the students described by Thernstrom\nand Thernstrom (2003) as being \"left behind.\" The research\nadded human qualities to the data and sought to personalize\nthe dramatic impact of this experience.\nGiven this abundance of information about the gap in\nachievement, most of us would expect what V. E. Lee and\nBurkam (2002) elucidated, \"A key goal of education is to\nmake sure that every student has a chance to excel, both in\nschool and in life\" (p. 1). Schooling is the dominant factor in\nthe future success of adults. The impact of education rever-\nberates into the areas of college admissions, professions pur-\nsued, and salaries paid. Closing the gap in academic\nachievement, as stated by the authors, more than any other\nsingle strategy under consideration, would serve to promote\nracial equality in the United States.\nMethod\nThis was a phenomenological study, which utilized a critical\nqualitative approach. My goal was to research the effects of\nthe gap in achievement on the lives of young urban students\nutilizing the social and political aspects of the educational\nsystem, which served to shape their reality of American\nschooling. My application was first submitted to the Human\nSubjects Review Board at Ashland University for approval.\nUpon the approval of my application, the study was con-\nducted with the use of two gatekeepers who served to\nidentify students who had dropped out of traditional urban\npublic schools. The program administrators at each campus\napproached five students who agreed to participate in this\nstudy. The project was thoroughly detailed in a meeting with\neach student. Each participant was then subjected to an inten-\nsive review of the goals of this study and the requirements\nfor the collection of data. The participant consent form was\nintroduced, read orally, and discussed. Each student signed\nand dated the form once all questions were answered. The\nyoungest member of this study was required to obtain signed\nparental permission in order to participate.\nData were collected in the form of one 90-min interview\nof three of the five study participants; two 90-min focus\ngroup sessions; two unobtrusive observations, one at each\ncampus; and a review of artifacts in the form of report cards,\nattendance data, and documents pertinent to the students'\nmatriculation through and eventual graduation from the\nalternative high schools. The time line for data collection and\ncorroboration of results was 8 weeks.\nParticipants\nFive African American students between the ages of 16 and\n22, who had previously dropped out of school, served as my\npurposeful sample. Two students were male and three were\nfemale. Please refer to Table 1 for a delineation of the study\nparticipants. This population was selected because they all\nwere pursuing their high school diplomas at an alternative\neducational facility. Each student in this study was raised in\nan urban area in a large metropolitan city. Each had attended\npublic schools and had failed at least one grade level.\nAccording to the Ohio Department of Education (2003)\nextremely large numbers of children from low-income com-\nmunities are leaving school unprepared for the demands of\nthe workplace or postsecondary education. These students\nare representative of populations from our African American\nand Hispanic communities, along with our children with\ndisabilities.\nData Collection Methods\nThe data collected for this phenomenological study were\nguided by the following research questions:\nResearch Question 1: In what ways are the aftereffects of\nthe gap in academic achievement magnified in the\nlives of young urban adults?\nTable 1. Study Participants.\nStudent pseudonym Sex Interview participant Focus group participant Center demographics\nJane Female Yes Yes Large urban, Center 1\nKarl Male Yes Yes Large urban, Center 1\nMark Male Yes Yes Large urban, Center 1\nAnnette Female No Yes Large urban, Center 2\nBarbara Female No Yes Large urban, Center 2\n4 SAGE Open\nResearch Question 2: What experiences have these stu-\ndents undergone as a result of this phenomenon?\nResearch Question 3: What meanings have these individ-\nuals ascribed to these experiences?\nResearch Question 4: What are the structural themes that\nfacilitate a description of these experiences?\nTo utilize qualitative research to respond to the aforemen-\ntioned questions, data were collected in the form of 90-min\ntape-recorded interviews and focus group sessions, two\nunobtrusive observations, along with report cards and atten-\ndance records for each of the five participants. Triangulation\nof the data was conducted through detailed journaling of the\nentire data collection process, member checks, and clarifica-\ntion of researcher bias, along with rich, thick descriptions.\nThis was a phenomenological study that utilized intensive\nopen-ended interviews and follow-up interviews for data\ncollection. Initial interview sessions were structured to get to\nknow the participants and to establish trust. Each member of\nthe study signed a participant consent form detailing the\ngoals and data collection requirements of the study. One par-\nticipant, below the age of 18, also required parental consent.\nQuestions for the subsequent interviews and focus group\nmeetings expanded the perceptions and experiences of for-\nmal schooling of the initial study participants of Jane, Mark,\nand Karl. The study participants were selected through the\nuse of two gatekeepers, the two administrators at the alterna-\ntive education facilities at which the interviewing occurred.\nIn addition, two focus group sessions were conducted. Two\nobservations, one at each campus, were completed.\nInterviews.The interviews were of 90 min in duration and\nwere conducted in an office on the site of each educational\nfacility. The open-ended questions were as follows:\nTell me about yourself. What are your interests and hobbies?\nPlease share your childhood memories. Tell me about your\nexperiences in elementary school. What do you remember about\nyour middle school years? How about your experiences in high\nschool? What did those experiences mean for you? Who was a\npart of your support system? Which teachers do you remember?\nIf you were to put all of your school memories in order, which\ndo you feel made the greatest difference in your life? Do you\nthink others feel as you do?\nFocus Groups. The focus group interviews were coordinated\nfollowing an analysis of the data from the initial interview\nsessions. A new consent form was generated, as the need to\nexpand the source of data became apparent. This new per-\nmission form thoroughly described the study for the benefit\nof the participants. This was necessary because the study was\ndescribed in detail to the first focus group participants. This\namount of detail was not provided for the second focus group\nparticipants. In the first focus group session with the initial\nstudy participants, extensive information was provided about\nthe goals and purposes of the study. The consent form was\nreviewed thoroughly before they were asked to sign it. They\nwere queried for concerns; however, when formulated in a\nfocus group, they indicated that they were in different labs.\nWe spent time at the beginning of the session with introduc-\ntions and a brief overview of the expectations for this ses-\nsion. Their questions were generated from previous interview\nresponses and were as follows:\nDescribe the connection you felt to school. Did you find school\nboring? Why? Did your peers feel the same way? Did you feel\nyour academic challenges were related to real-world events?\nDid you feel your teachers had high expectations for your\nlearning? Were you prepared by your earlier schooling when\nyou entered high school? Did you get help when you needed it?\nDid repeating a grade keep you from continuing in school? Did\nyou cut classes and refuse to go to school before actually\ndropping out? Was there an adult who tried to get you to go to\nclass? Do you feel you had too much freedom and not enough\nrules? Did your parents know that you were about to drop out of\nschool? Do you feel that not having a diploma makes it hard to\nfind a good job? What is different for you now?\nThe second focus group session was held with the same\norientation to structure, introduction to the process, and\nrefined questions. The two students in the second session\nknew each other well and were in the same lab.\nObservations.Unobtrusive observations were conducted at\neach alternative educational facility. The first was conducted\nin early spring. This center is located in Urban Area 1. I\narrived in the classroom of Karl at 1:20 p.m. Upon entry, I\nintroduced myself to the teacher and instructional aide. They\nknew about my anticipated arrival. I asked for a place in the\nclassroom where I would not disturb the structure of the ses-\nsion. I was offered a seat at the teacher's desk. As I looked\naround the room, prior to the beginning of class, I detected\nthe Center's mission statement posted above the doorway for\neach student to read upon entry and departure. According to\nthe guidelines provided, the Center seeks to impart to all stu-\ndents the knowledge, desire, and confidence needed to suc-\nceed with academic and workplace goals. The Center strives\nto teach, guide, and support all students through their educa-\ntional growth and development.\nAs each student arrived, he or she signed in on a clipboard\nthat was located on the instructor's desk. Seventeen students\npoured into the classroom in a single file line. They retrieved\nwork packets from a file cabinet and embarked on their per-\nsonalized assignments at their designated computer worksta-\ntions. Karl, the youngest study participant, looked over and\nsmiled at me in recognition as he passed by my observation\nlocation at his teacher's desk. I smiled in return. All comput-\ners in the lab were in service, with the exception of one. This\nincapacitated machine was turned so that the screen faced the\nback wall. All students in attendance wore muted colors,\nwith an emblem bearing the Center's logo printed in a vivid\ncontrast over their hearts. The students ranged in age from 16\nto 22. Students settled down to their assigned coursework\nand began completing the tasks that would help them to earn\nthe credit necessary for graduation. The teacher and the\nassistant, a male and a female, circulated among the students\nto assess progress. The instructors would sit very close to\neach student in each interaction. This continued throughout\nmy visit. As students completed mandatory assignments,\nthey turned them in to the instructional assistant and began\nanother. Karl kept his jacket on as he worked through his\nsequence of activities. All assignments were located in two\nstuffed file cabinets in the front of the classroom. The stu-\ndents were focused on their individual goals and remained on\ntask. On the faces of some, I could read contentment. Others\nhad unreadable countenances. Karl was one whose emotions\nwere not readily visible.\nThe posters in the classroom reflected the following\nthemes: \"What would you try if you heard that you would not\nfail?\" \"If you don't have time to do it right, you must have\ntime to do it over.\" \"Those who stand for nothing will fall for\nanything.\" I drew a diagram of the classroom, and quietly\nthanked the teachers for allowing me to observe their class. I\nThe second site was a center located in an urban area sev-\neral miles away from the first center. I arrived at this center\non a crisp, sunny morning in April. The center's mission was\nto provide an education tailored to the needs of each student.\nThe receptionist greeted me as I approached her enclosed\narea and notified the administrator of my presence. I waited\nin the reception area with two women who were interviewing\nfor jobs at this center. I watched as they waited in nervous\nanticipation. One had selected to review her notes; the other\nwas nibbling away at her fingernails. A parent arrived to\nwithdraw her son who refused to attend school. She shifted\nfrom foot to foot in apparent agitation at her son's educa-\ntional apathy. This parent struggled with a baby carrier upon\nher arrival. I wondered if the child was her grandson or\ngranddaughter. So many guardians of adult children and\ngrandparents are finding their child-rearing responsibilities\nto be perpetual. I watched as students arrived to class.\nAttendees dressed in jeans, sweatshirts, short skirts, tennis\nshoes, and flip-flops arrived and departed as I observed and\nscripted notes. The students enrolled in this program attend\nclass 4 hr each day, 5 days a week. Instruction is highly dis-\nciplined, utilizing the support of a teacher facilitator and an\ninstructional assistant in each laboratory setting. Once the\nstudents graduate, they receive a state-recognized high\nschool diploma, not a General Equivalency Diploma. This\n1-hr observation session was structured by the following\nquestions:\nWhat are the places where social activity occurs? Who are the\npeople involved in the social action? What are the individual\nactivities in which people are engaged? What are the group\nactivities in which people are engaged? What are the objects\npeople use? What is the sequence of activity? What things are\npeople trying to accomplish? What emotions are expressed?\nThe computer labs were operated on a staggered daily\nschedule that would accommodate 500 students. As students\narrived and departed with no interruption of the educational\nprocess, and an even flow of the academic procedures, it\nappeared as if this center had established a very organized\nprogram structure. This occurred throughout my unobtrusive\nobservation period. The students came and left in a predeter-\nmined manner. The social activity occurred in the front park-\ning lot, as students either drove to their places of employment\nor to other destinations of their determination. All students\nwere enrolled in a computer curriculum, which will allow\nthem to earn the Carnegie Units required for graduation. That\ngoal is kept alive with the oversized diploma prominently\ndisplayed in the office of the school's administrator. The stu-\ndents are assigned to time slots based on their employment\nschedules. Jobs are secured, coordinated, and assigned by\ncareer guidance counselors. For the vast majority of the stu-\ndents, this is the first meaningful employment in which they\nhave participated. The students were actively engaged in\nexuberant conversation as they arrived and departed. I con-\nDocument Review\nAreview of documents and products brings to light the following\nthemes: Attendance patterns became sporadic as students\nbecame detached from formal schooling. Students attended\nseveral different schools in their academic careers. Students\nbegan to fail prior to actually dropping out of school. The\nparticipants had repeated at least one grade level in their school\ncareers.\nJane began her sixth grade year at an urban campus, which\naccommodated students in Grades 6 through 8. She received\na letter grade of D in language arts, a C in social studies, a D\nin math, a B in physical education, a C in science, and a C in\na course titled Star 6. By the third quarter of this academic\nyear, there were no grades posted. Jane's radical decline\nbegan in the fourth quarter in which she failed most of her\nmajor subjects. She began her seventh grade year with fail-\ning grades in every major subject, with the exception of\nmathematics. Karl's academic records indicate that he never\nattended a traditional high school. Instead, his father selected\nto enroll him in an alternative learning facility at the conclu-\nsion of his eighth grade year, at the age of 16. Mark earned\ncredits in mathematics, social studies, and two electives.\nAnnette's transcript shows that she has been in attendance\nfor 1 year at the alternative educational facility and earned\none credit. She has neither taken any portions of the Ninth\nGrade Proficiency Test nor the Tenth Grade Graduation Test.\nBarbara began attending the center 2 years ago, and dropped\nout the following year. She has returned this school year to\n6 SAGE Open\ncomplete the process. She, too, will need to complete the\nstate-mandated testing.\nData Analysis Procedures\nThe typological data analysis strategy (Hatch, 2002) was uti-\nlized to organize the data in this study and to make judg-\nments about the meaning of the data. The data were analyzed\nby identifying the topologies present. The initial interviews\nled to a set of focus group studies. This expanded process\nallowed important themes and categories to emerge. The fol-\nlowing topologies from the initial set of interviews and archi-\nval research were present in the data sets of each study\nparticipant:\n1. The participants were a part of a nomadic home cul-\nture that required them to move among several\nschools in the same district, and in some cases, among\ndifferent school districts. This created a disconnected\nand discombobulated educational foundation permit-\nting students to be lost in the system and experience\nearly academic failure.\n2. The study participants were required to grow through\ntheir formative years with only one parent or legal\nguardian, causing feelings of abandonment and loss.\nThis would point to the need for establishing this\nemotional connection in the formal setting of school.\n3. All participants verbalized the need to have instruc-\ntors who took a personal interest in them. The sub-\nthemes apparent in the focus group sessions were that\nthe study participants did not feel a connection in\nschool. In addition, the teachers did not have high\nexpectations for their students' learning; therefore,\ntheir instruction was not challenging and related to\ntheir real-world experiences. The final subtheme was\nthe regret verbally expressed by each participant for\nnot having earned his or her diploma in the traditional\nschool format.\nResearch has shown that a relationship exists between\nschool system effectiveness, the socioeconomic status of\nfamilies in the community, and the education level of parents\n(Bainbridge & Lasley, 2002). In the research of Ferguson\n(2003), the importance of an enriched curriculum taught by\nteachers exceptionally trained in the pedagogy of their field\nand committed to providing an outstanding education to their\nyoung urban students is reiterated. Ladson-Billings (2001)\nasserted that successful teachers focus on students'academic\nachievement, develop students' cultural competence, and\nfoster a sense of sociopolitical consciousness. Payne (2005)\ndescribed the physical, emotional, and physical resources\nnecessary for these students to succeed. Critical in this pro-\ncess is an educational system that is accepting of all students\nand an instructional environment that maintains high expec-\ntations for achievement throughout the academic process.\nThe patterns, relationships, and themes within the typologies\nare aligned with the research on the achievement gap.\nBainbridge and Lasley (2002) asserted that closing the gap in\nachievement requires that educators recognize the inherent\nsocial complexity associated with the educational process. It\nis critical that we understand the road traveled by each stu-\ndent present in the classroom, appreciate the process, and\nbuild on prior knowledge. Competent, caring educators hold\nthe key, as corroborated in the research and in this study.\nResults\nThe data were consistent throughout the collection process.\nThe participants uniformly agreed on specific aspects of their\nschooling. Their academic records provided documentation\nof the following themes and subthemes:\nMark verbalized the first theme of a disconnected educa-\ntional structure in the following transcript:\nI moved around a lot. I went to M., E.C., G., L., and also another\nschool I can't remember. I been to like five elementary schools.\nWe moved to different schools each year. We lived in E., E.C.\nCan't remember none of the rest. . . I failed sixth grade the first\ntime because I didn't know nothing. I was always skippin' and\nstuff, but then after I failed, I started going to school every day\nand stuff and started doing my work. And then, toward the end\nof my eighth grade year, that's when I started getting in trouble\nin the streets and stuff like that. All the teachers in the school\nknew me as being bad, and like I was with the wrong crowd and\nstuff.\nKarl described his experiences as follows:\nI went to E. B. D., C., S., W., a lot of schools. We used to travel\neverywhere. Can't remember the names of some of the schools.\nWe used to move all of the time.\nJane stated,\nIt is probably where I belonged (gifted classes). But I was so\nused to being in regular classes. Cause I was going to so many\nalternative schools, skipping around from school to school, I\nnever really noticed that work was too easy or the work was not\nhard enough. I do the work, make noise. Make straight A's, one\nF. I make an F, and probably tell `em I don't like the teachers and\ndon't go to class.\nAnnette remembered,\nI bounced around from school to school, to school until I just\nstopped. I went to like three elementary schools, seven middle\nschools, and two high schools until I just stopped.\nIn the words of Barbara,\nI went to several schools. I've been to like five elementary\nschools, every middle school in this city, and about five high\nschools.\nThe documents for each candidate were peppered with the\nnames of various schools in two large urban metropolitan\nareas used in this study. The same school names were repli-\ncated at a later date on their high school transcripts, which\nindicated that the study participants withdrew and reenrolled\nat the same school within a matter of a year or two.\nThe subtheme was a lack of connection to school and the\neducational process, and thereby finding school to be boring\nwith no connection to their futures. In the focus group ses-\nsions, each participant was asked to describe the connections\nhe or she felt in school. The responses were sometimes cho-\nral in agreement as they stated,\nI didn't feel no connections in school. No connections! I went to\nschool because I didn't want to be like my sister. The family be\ndown on me and my sister. Others responded, I hated going to\nschool! I went to school because my mother made me . . . certain\nthings were boring and others were not. I like science and math\nwith hands-on stuff. I like hands-on stuff, too. I did not know\nhow much I needed school until I got older. I didn't think I\nneeded to go. Everybody was telling me that I needed to, but it\nwasn't clicking in.\nThe study participants willingly shared that they felt no\nconnections to school. They went to school because they\nwere forced to do so by a parent or legal guardian. Comments\nsuch as \"I hated school!\" were uttered in the tape-\nrecorded focus group sessions. They all shared regret for not\nhaving completed their schooling; however, their lack of\nconnection--a firm grasp on the educational system--\nallowed them to slip into the abyss of the huge gap in achieve-\nment and become statistics. Uhlenberg and Brown (2002)\nstated that Black students seem to be more sensitive to their\nteachers' perceptions than their White counterparts. One of\nthe persistent topics in the achievement gap literature is high\nexpectation for educational attainment. Teachers must\nbelieve that their children can master complex instruction\ntaught in a pedagogy that is appropriate. Each of the study\nparticipants moved among schools in a rudderless fashion. It\nis very difficult for students to master the expectations of so\nmany different teachers in elementary school. If special\nlearning needs existed, it was difficult to detect them and\nprovide the necessary remediation accordingly. V. E. Lee and\nBurkam (2002) posited that social inequalities increase as\nstudents advance through school because of the differentia-\ntion in educational experiences that begin as early as the first\ngrade. The participants in this study began their race at a\ndecided disadvantage and never gained their educational\nfooting to advance in alignment with their nondisadvantaged\npeers, students who remain in one school district their entire\nacademic career and students whose parents advocate for\neducational placement services for their children as\nnecessary. Van Laar and Sidanius (2001) observed that\nsocially powerful parents possess a great deal of cultural and\nsocial competence, along with capital that will prove benefi-\ncial to the academic achievement of their children. These\nparents can more easily navigate their way through public\nand private bureaucracies and pull the necessary strings\nwithin these institutions. The participants in this study did\nnot have the benefit of this level of advocacy in their process\nof schooling.\nThe second theme of abandonment and loss was expressed in\nthe words of Jane.\nI really didn't have a childhood. My childhood was skipped, my\nfather was in jail till I was 18. Went in when I was 2 and got out\nwhen I was 18. My mother was off doing God knows what, so I\nlived with my grandmother and my little sister. I really didn't\nhave a childhood. I had to grow up faster than I wanted to. My\ntoys went to my sister; I had to clean up after my little sister. I\nhad to do a lot of stuff after her. I didn't have no childhood. I am\njust now getting a childhood at 20.\nJane is soon to become a mother. She is both emotionally\nand physically removed from the father of her child. In Jane's\ninterview, she described the loss of her grandmother, who\nwas her primary caretaker throughout her formative years.\nShe shared her lucid memories of the demise of her third-\ngrade teacher from cancer, the same cause of death as that of\nher grandmother. She lost an uncle to a heart attack at an\nearly age, and another uncle was tragically removed from her\nlife as he was swept away in the violence of the streets. This\nwas in addition to the loss of her mother and father.\nKarl shared his childhood memories in the following\nfashion:\nI don't remember nothing. I don't know why. Playing with my\nuncle and them. We used to be fighting and stuff. He taught me\nfootball and karate. I remember getting my hand cut and going\nto the hospital. My father left his job to take me to the hospital.\nI was trying to open a can of milk when I was 9 or 10. I been\nlivin' with my dad for a year or two. We made the change\nbecause we was getting on my mother's nerves. We was good\nkids, though. I played football in the projects with my brother--\neverybody looked up to us because we was so good. We played\noutside my house and on other peoples'streets. We bet money to\nsee who would win.\nKarl talked about the time he spent in the custody of his\nmother. He turned 17 years of age during the year of the\nstudy, and to date has only earned one Carnegie Unit toward\nhis high school graduation. Karl left middle school and was\nimmediately enrolled into the alternative learning facility. He\nnever attended a traditional high school. The oldest male par-\nticipant in this study, Mark, shared the following:\n8 SAGE Open\nI am the oldest in my house now. My older sister and her baby\nwere hit by a car last year in April. She was 1 year older than me.\nThere's mostly boys and four girls in my family. The youngest is\n2. Everybody stays with my mother. I don't know where my\nfather is. He left when I was little . . . I can only remember him\nin pictures. I look like him. . . .I was in jail most of my teen years\nfrom like 15 to 17. My friends was in jail too. My older brother\ngave up on school . . . he started getting in trouble in the eighth\ngrade.\nMark spoke in a quiet monotone as he shared the atrocity\nof losing his sister and nephew to a drunk driver a year ago.\nHe has been involved in the juvenile justice system, the over-\nworked social system that has been unable to provide for the\nacademic and social needs of children like Mark. He lost 2\nyears of his life to incarceration. At the tender age of 18, he\nhas experienced so much; however, his current sense of\ndirection is refreshing. Completing school to earn his high\nschool diploma is very important to Mark. In conjunction\nwith this, Talbert-Johnson (2004) concluded that,\nAfrican American males, compared to White males, regardless\nof socioeconomic level, are much more likely to be suspended at\na younger age, to receive lengthier suspensions, to be placed in\nspecial education classes, to be programmed into punishment\nfacilities such as juvenile court rather than into treatment, and to\nbe given more pathological labels than warranted . . . Punitive\ntechniques are ineffective, counterproductive and overzealous,\nespecially for situations involving African American males.\nIn the second focus group setting at the alternative educa-\ntional facility in Urban Area 2, Annette shared her thoughts\nin the following manner:\nWhen I was going to school, it wasn't like it is now. Like now if\nyou don't do your work, you don't show up, the teachers call\nhome the same day you weren't in class. But, back then it was\njust basically like if you come to school, or come to class you\njust come. If you don't come, the teachers don't care. They ain't\ngonna send you no homework. You get suspended 10 days. They\ndon't care. I had really just stopped going.\nBarbara, from the same center, added the following:\nI really didn't feel no connection. I was about tired of school. I\nwas going to F [name of a high school] and the teachers up there\ndid not care. And I was tired of it, it was like I would be there\ndoing the work and like I was pregnant and some days I couldn't\ncome. Me and my mother were going through some things,\nwhere she wouldn't excuse my absences. And I had seven\nunexcused absences and you on noncredit status. And I'm like\nwhat's the point of me coming.\nThe subtheme of the need for emotional connections to\nfill the void, resound in the achievement gap literature. This\ncan occur with smaller class sizes, as suggested by Jencks\nand Phillips (1998), who posited that having smaller\nclassrooms and competent teachers with high expectations\nwill serve to close the gap in academic achievement. These\nteachers would be able to connect to their students to create\nthe emotional bridge necessary to provide academic instruc-\ntion to pupils who have experienced this level of loss.\nTalbert-Johnson (2004) described the feelings of alienation\nreported by African American youth within the school com-\nmunity. This research indicates that these students fail to see\nschool as rewarding. Because American schooling is a mid-\ndle-class concept, which identifies the academic process as\nthe means to the end, the members of the middle class will be\nrequired to form the bridge to those who are alienated to per-\npetuate this perspective. A lack of identification, according\nto this author, is shaped by negative teacher expectations.\nEach participant adamantly expressed the need to have quali-\nfied, committed, competent instructors who took a personal\ninterest in him or her. Jane shared,\nTeachers told me that I wouldn't amount to nothin'. They say I\ndon't even know why you come to class. Whether you learn or\nnot, I'm gonna get paid anyway . . . I was like in the sixth grade\n. . . I had to go back to [an urban middle school] and the principal\ntell my grandmother, \"I don't like her, I don't know why you\nsent her here, I don't know why she come here, stay out of my\nway or she's gonna be suspended.\nMark concurs with the following:\nThey told me, you know, they told me I was smart, you know\nhow they be saying that you intelligent. You should be coming\nto school and stuff like that and some of `em told me the same\nthing that they told them, too. They say they gonna get paid\nanyway . . . I started cutting' classes and hangin' out.\nAccording to Karl, the youngest participant,\nTeachers wasn't fun if they didn't have hands-on, or stuff like\nthat. A couple taught that way, but not everyone. If they didn't\nexplain it, it was hard for everybody to get it . . . I wasn't\nachieving. I don't remember the name of the teacher, but I\nremember his face. He used to like use the blocks to explain it\nand keep going over it so we could know.\nTalbert-Johnson (2004) reported that a well-qualified\nteacher can be the single most powerful variable affecting\nstudent performance in schools. Uhlenberg and Brown\n(2002) stated that teachers represent the front line in edu-\ncation. Ladson-Billings (2001) identified the critical com-\nponents of academic achievement for all students as\nfollows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The teacher presumes that all students are capable of\nbeing educated\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The teacher clearly delineates what achievement\nmeans in the context of his or her classroom\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The teacher knows the content, the learner, and how to\nteach content to the learner\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The teacher supports a critical consciousness toward\nthe curriculum\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The teacher encourages academic achievement as a\ncomplex conception not amenable to a single, static\nmeasurement. (p. 74)\nBainbridge and Lasley (2002) offered the argument that\nclosing the achievement gap means that educators must\nrecognize the inherent social complexity associated with\nthe educational process. We must accept our students as\nthey come to us, build on their prior knowledge and levels\nof experience, and expect high levels of performance.\nTeachers are our front line of defense as they spend the\ngreatest amount of time with our children in classroom\nsettings.\nThe limitations of this study begin with the sample size.\nThere are only five participants who were interviewed for\nthis study, and their perceptions cannot be generalized to a\nmuch larger group of adults who have experienced the after-\neffects of the gap in academic achievement. However, their\nviews provide us with direction for future research. In addi-\ntion, the youngest participant, Karl never attended a tradi-\ntional high school. He technically never officially dropped\nout of school. Karl continued to attend traditional schools,\ndespite the fact that he was 16 years of age and never entered\nhigh school. His father enrolled him in this alternative learn-\ning facility. Another source of concern from a research valid-\nity perspective was that the male members of this study were\nless loquacious and far less verbose than their female coun-\nterparts. It was necessary to conduct several member checks\nto make sure the data I had transcribed were their perception,\nand not my opinion of their tape-recorded sessions, which\nwere heavy-laden with pregnant pauses. There were also\nconcerns regarding the duration of the study. The minimum\ntime in the field obtaining, collating, and triangulating data\nfor a study of this magnitude would be 12 months. This\nwould have permitted observations in alternative settings for\neach of the study participants. Finally, the entire sample\ncomprised students who have selected to return to school to\nearn their high school diplomas. This study could not be uti-\nlized for those who have not selected to complete the process\nor those who have instead chosen to obtain their General\nEquivalency Diploma.\nPlease refer to Table 2 for a summary of the themes and\nsubthemes developed in this section.\nDiscussion\nThe goal of this study was to provide a window into the lives\nof the students who have fallen victim to the gap in aca-\ndemic achievement. This study was designed to give a voice\nto and personalize the data. The responses to the research\nquestions that gave direction and focus to this study pro-\nvided an intensely personal perspective of this educational\nconundrum.\nEach participant in this study expressed the importance of\nobtaining a traditional high school diploma, and regret for\nhaving not completed his or her education originally. The\naftereffects have involved incarceration at one extreme and\nan inability to locate gainful, meaningful employment at the\nother. Each of the female participants either is or will become\na mother. Perhaps the early involvement of social services in\na proactive capacity in conjunction with our urban educa-\ntional institutions would help these young mothers to be able\nto provide for their children economically, educationally, and\nemotionally. Each young mother expressed a desire for\nsomething better for her child or children. In each case, the\nroad to the alternative learning facility was long and punctu-\nated with challenges. Each expressed a desire to attend\ncollege.\nTable 2. Themes and Subthemes: Bridging the Gap in Academic Achievement.\n I. Lack of academic stability\n Students moved among several different schools during their formative years of education\n Students lacked the adult support system necessary to guide them through the pitfalls of the educational process\n Students failed one or more grades in school\n Students dropped out of school\nII. Feelings of abandonment and loss\n Students grew up without one or more of their biological parents\n Students experienced loss of significant others in their lives and/or a part of their lives in the juvenile justice system\n Students did not feel a connection to formal schooling\n Students expressed grief over dropping out of school\nIII. The need to form bonds with their teachers\n Students felt no connection to the academic process\n Students felt no connection to most of their teachers\n Students felt that their teachers did not have high expectations for their learning\n Students felt that their instruction was not challenging and related to the experiences of their lives\nThe most dramatic experience these students have shared\nis a lack of preparation for their desired avocation. They feel\nthey have been left behind by and disconnected from the tra-\nditional educational process. The first comment made regard-\ning their current schooling is the size of the classes and the\ncaring of their instructors. The research aligns with this per-\nception. In the unobtrusive observations conducted at each\nfacility, the close proximity of the teachers to the students\nwas demonstrative of the connection each participant sought.\nThe educators appeared to be committed to making sure that\nthe students in their charge mastered the personalized, indi-\nvidualized instruction developed for them.\nThe meanings the students have unanimously ascribed to\ntheir educational experiences were that their teachers did not\ncare about them or about their learning process. The instruc-\ntors and role models they remembered were those who con-\nnected their instruction with creative activities and had high\nexpectations for them. The teachers were culturally compe-\ntent. Carter (2005) has determined that the requisite knowl-\nedge base in American society needs to be expanded and\nculturally inclusive. All teacher education programs must be\nimbued with this culturally relevant knowledge base in the-\nory and in practice. As Ladson-Billings (2001) so elegantly\nstated, we can and must educate all children. This can occur\nwhen teachers have high expectations for learning, and\nunderstand that all children are capable of learning. These\nteachers must know the content, the learner, and how to teach\nthat content to the learner, as well as support the develop-\nment of critical consciousness and cultural competence.\nWhen high academic standards are maintained, achievement\nis the by-product of all instruction.\nAnd, finally, the themes expressed were those of a lack of\nacademic stability, feelings of disconnection, and the need to\nestablish positive relationships with their teachers. This per-\nfectly aligns with the research of Ferguson (2003), in which\nthe quality of the instructor, in conjunction with the high\nlevel of expectation, and the provision of an enriched cur-\nriculum utilizing effective pedagogy are required for closing\nthe gap in academic achievement. This must occur in the\nclassroom of a caring, conscientious professional who not\nonly understands his or her children but is also willing to\nestablish a positive rapport with each one. The attitude must\nbe that expressed by Thernstrom and Thernstrom (2003).\nThey reiterate the importance of accepting no excuses for\nfailing to instruct all children. In the words of Gates (2006),\nOnce we realize that we are keeping low-income and minority\nkids out of rigorous courses, there can be only two arguments for\nkeeping it that way--either we think they can't learn, or we\nthink they're not worth teaching. The first argument is factually\nwrong; the second is morally wrong. (B. Gates, personal\nThe current research indicates that teachers and adminis-\ntrators must move beyond blaming children and their parents\nfor low achievement. This was evident in a survey adminis-\ntered by Boykin and Noguera (2011). According to the sur-\nveys and interviews that were conducted with educators, it\nwas reported that the quality of their work was fine and that\nit was up to parents to do something to improve student\nachievement outcomes. The authors continue by reviewing\nschools successful in making a difference for all children.\nThey conclude that ultimately, the only way to close the\nachievement gap is by paying careful attention to creating\nlearning conditions in which academic success is more likely.\nProviding enriched learning opportunities after school will\nextend learning time in ways that are most likely to make a\ndifference.According to Rod Paige, the former U.S. Secretary\nof Education, we must first understand the ramifications of\nthe Black\u00adWhite achievement gap, then we must accept\nresponsibility for closing this gap, and we must develop a\nsense of urgency about accomplishing this critical academic\nchallenge.\nGiving a voice to the students who have personally expe-\nrienced the results of the gap in academic achievement helps\nus to understand the importance of bridging this crevasse.\nBecause a key goal of education is to assure the success of all\nstudents, we can no longer continue to ignore a large portion\nof our students. We owe our commitment to Jane, Karl,\nMark, Annette, and Barbara. We owe our determination to\ntheir offspring.\nWe owe our perseverance to all children. According to V.\nE. Lee and Burkam (2002), closing the gap in achievement,\nmore than any other single strategy under consideration,\nwould serve to promote racial equality in the United States.\nThe results of this phenomenological study provided a per-\nsonalized perspective of the research that will lead to the\nattainment of this most noble goal.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBainbridge, W.
