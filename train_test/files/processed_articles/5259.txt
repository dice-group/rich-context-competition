A study carried out in the USA\nfound that the risk of obese children having\nasthma was two times higher than for chil-\ndren with normal body weight.3 An Asian\nstudy by the Prediction of Allergies in\nTaiwanese Children (PATCH) group, invol-\nving 5 476 children showed that an elevated\nbody mass index (BMI), was associated with\na greater prevalence of wheezing and\neczema.4 In many studies, especially those\nbased in the USA, the term `overweight/\nobese' has usually been defined as the 95th\ncentile of the US Center for Disease Control\nreference curves for BMI, with children at or\nabove the 85th (but below the 95th) centile\nclassified as being at risk.5 The prevalence of\nasthma in the USA has been reported to be\nhigher than in many other countries.6\nFurthermore, in a US study in children\nfrom racial minority subgroups with differ-\nent genetic backgrounds, obesity prevalence\nranged from 4.4% in Asian Indian children\nup to 13.0% in American Indian/Alaska\nNative children.7 Therefore, it is important\nfor such surveys to take ethnicity into\naccount. A number of studies investigating\nthe relationship between the incidence of\nasthma or asthma-like symptoms and\nincreasing BMI have included information\non individuals' sex.3,4,6\u00ad8 Nevertheless, there\nis still a need for further studies that include\nthese key factors and involve large numbers\nof individuals.\nThe present large population study aimed\nto investigate whether BMI and sex are\nassociated with the prevalence of asthma-\nlike disease and current wheeze, in children\nfrom the Han ethnic group in Nanjing,\nChina.\nSubjects and methods\nEvery child belonging to the Han ethnic\ngroup from 16 kindergartens and 12 elem-\nentary schools, covering the age range 3\u00ad14\nyears old, in the northern part of Nanjing\nCity, China, was selected to participate in\nthe study. Data collection took place\nChildren with major systemic diseases or\nsyndromes were excluded.\nThe children's parents completed a set of\nquestions derived from the International\nStudy of Asthma and Allergies in\nChildhood (ISAAC) core questionnaire.9\nThe ISAAC is a well-validated standard\ntool for epidemiological investigation of\nthe prevalence and severity of atopic dis-\norders, such as wheezing and rhinitis, for use\nin children living in different countries.10,11\nIn the present study, the presence of asthma-\nlike disease was based on a positive response\nto the question, `Has your child ever been\ndiagnosed with asthma, asthmatic bron-\nchitis, chronic bronchitis or asthmatic pneu-\nmonia?'. The presence of current wheeze was\nbased on a positive response to the question\non asthma-like disease, plus a positive\nresponse to the question, `In the last\n12 months, has your child had wheezing in\nthe chest?'. The questionnaire also gathered\ninformation on birth date, sex, height,\nweight, home address, and a history of\nasthma or other allergic disorders in the\nparents and grandparents. The date on\nwhich the questionnaire was completed\nwas recorded for each individual.\nAll the parents provided verbal informed\nconsent and anonymity was preserved in the\ndata analysis. The study was approved by\nthe Committee on Human Experimentation,\nNanjing Children's Hospital, Nanjing\nMedical University, Nanjing, China, and\nwas conducted in accordance with the\nHelsinki Declaration of 1964, as revised in\nThe weight and height of each participant\nwere measured according to a standard\nprotocol. All children were weighed while\nwearing light clothes and without shoes.\nMeasurements were conducted using a cali-\nbrated weighing scale and stadiometer.\nWeight (in kg) was measured to the nearest\n1 kg and height (in cm) was measured to the\nnearest 1 cm. The BMI for each study par-\nticipant (defined as weight in kg divided by\nheight in m2), was calculated from these\nmeasurements.\nThe study population was divided\naccording to age (<7 years versus !7\nyears) and sex. Participants were also\ndivided into three groups according to\nBMI, based on age- and sex-specific criteria\nfor normal weight, obesity13 and thinness,14\nusing well-validated standards developed on\nStatistical analyses\nThe prevalence of asthma-like disease and\ncurrent wheeze in the different BMI and sex\ngroups were compared using the 2-test.\nOdds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence inter-\nvals (CI) were derived in the different BMI,\nsex and age groups. Multivariate logistic\nregression analysis was performed to esti-\nmate the effects of BMI, sex and age inde-\npendently; the confounding factor of BMI\nwas treated as ranked data, whereas sex and\nage were treated as dichotomous data. A\nP-value <0.05 was considered to be statis-\ntically significant.

In add-\nition, the risk of current wheeze was\nsignificantly higher in the obesity group\nand significantly lower in the thinness\ngroup compared with the normal-weight\ngroup in male subjects only (P < 0.05 for\nboth) (Table 2).

For current\nwheeze, an increase in BMI was associated\nwith an increase in risk (P \u00bc 0.005 for both\nobesity and thinness compared with normal\nweight). In addition, the risk of current\nwheeze in children !7 years was lower\nthan that in younger children (P < 0.05)\nand was lower in female, than in male,\nDiscussion\nThe present study revealed a significant\nrelationship between asthma-like disease\nand obesity among children from the Han\nethnic group in Nanjing, China.\nBoth 2-test and multivariate logistic\nregression analyses showed that an increas-\ning BMI was significantly and independently\nassociated with a higher prevalence of\nasthma-like disease in children. While a\nnumber of studies have shown that asthma\nor asthma-like symptoms were significantly\nthe associated OR have varied. Interaction\nanalysis of BMI and sex suggested that the\neffect of BMI on asthma-like disease does\nnot differ between the sexes. This is in line\nwith some reports,20 but some studies have\nrevealed a stronger association between\nBMI and asthma-like disease in boys than\nin girls3,8 or conversely a stronger associ-\nReported differences between the sexes in\nthe effect of body size on asthma suggest it is\nimportant to specify the age at which an\neffect is observed, as some associations may\nonly be seen during certain periods of\ndevelopment.23 The present study also\ndemonstrated a significant association\nbetween BMI and current wheeze, but only\nin boys.\nWhile the epidemiological evidence link-\ning asthma or asthma-like symptoms and\nobesity is impressive, the mechanism of the\nlink between these diseases is far from clear.\nSince variations in this association are seen\nin results from different areas and ethnic\nasthma and obesity may be linked via spe-\ncific regions of the human genome, such as\nTable 3.

In addition,\nsex may also play a role in the presence of\ncurrent wheeze. Knowledge of this associ-\nation may help inform public health deci-\nsions concerning asthma diagnosis,\nmanagement and prevention. However,\nbecause of the cross-sectional design of the\nstudy, and since only sex and age were used\nas confounding factors, a causal association\ncannot be assumed on the basis of the\npresent study.
