Elizabeth Peters3\nFelicia Yang DeLeone4\n Introduction\nEarly childbearing has long been of concern to scholars, policy makers, and the general\npublic because of its potential negative consequences for teen parents and their\nchildren. Children born to teenage mothers are more likely than those with mothers\nwho were older at the time of birth to grow up in poverty, drop out of high school, and\nbecome teen parents themselves (Haveman, Wolfe, and Pence 2001). Teen parents are\nalso less likely to be married than older parents (Ventura and Bachrach 2000). In\ncomparison to youth living with two parents, those living apart from their biological\nfathers are more likely to live in poverty, receive welfare, drop out of high school, be\n\"idle,\" have children as teenagers, marry early, and dissolve their marriages (Hernandez\n1994). More recent research has cast doubt on the causality of these associations (Hotz,\nMcElroy, and Sanders 2005), but concerns about teen fertility, particularly in the\npolicymaking community, still abound.\nCompared to the body of literature on early female fertility, research focusing\nspecifically on the transition to fatherhood is limited (Goldscheider and Kaufman\n1996). However, scholars and policymakers are increasingly recognizing the\nimportance of men's contributions to fertility and marriage outcomes, as evidenced by a\nnumber of policies that have been directed at men. For example, beginning in the mid-\n1980s, Congress passed a series of acts aimed at increasing the payment of child\nsupport and the establishment of legal paternity for children born outside of marriage\n(Committee on Ways & Means 2004). More recently, efforts to promote healthy\nmarriages have focused on both men and women (Administration for Children and\nDue in part to this policy interest, research on men's family formation behaviors\nhas increased rapidly. While some consistent patterns, such as the positive association\nbetween disadvantaged family backgrounds and early fertility, have emerged in the\nliterature (Rindfuss, Morgan, and Swicegood 1988), there have been some\ninconsistencies in this early research as well. Additionally, while data on female\nfertility appears to be quite consistent across surveys (Swicegood, Morgan, and\nRindfuss 1984), questions have been raised in the past about the quality of men's\nThis paper seeks to provide systematic baseline information on early male fertility\nby running parallel analyses in three large nationally representative data sets: the 1979\nFamily Growth. While the NLSY79 has been used extensively in the study of early\nfertility, the NLSY97 and the 2002 NSFG are relatively new data sources that are likely\nto be heavily used in the future. These data sets also differ in their sample composition,\nDemographic Research: Volume 18, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 339\ndesign, and data collection strategies. The comparisons presented in this paper provide\nresearchers with a clear understanding of differences and similarities in descriptive and\nmultivariate results across the three data sources.\nWe describe patterns of early fertility for men using a broad definition of early\nfertility that includes births through age 24. We compare patterns of male and female\nfertility and examine differences in the prevalence of early parenthood by age, race, and\ncohort. In addition, we examine the family background characteristics associated with\nearly fatherhood. With the large sample sizes available, we are able to empirically test\nwhether the influence of these background characteristics differs based on the\nrespondent's age, sex, or race.\nWith a few exceptions, estimates of the prevalence of early male fertility are\nrelatively similar across data sets because each data set includes respondents born in\ncohorts with varying rates of early fertility. Multiple regression results indicate that\nwhile disadvantage is associated with first births to teenagers and with fertility in the\nearly 20s, the association weakens after the teenage years. These regression results are\nmore robust for white men than for men from racial minorities. We find only sporadic\nevidence that the background characteristics associated with early fertility differ for\nwomen and men, and little evidence of cohort differences. Finally, while prevalence\nestimates are relatively consistent across data sets, associations in regression models\nbetween background characteristics and early male fertility are not entirely consistent.\nWe discuss the implications of these findings for scholars doing research on the causes\nand consequences of men's family formation behaviors.\n2. Background\n2.1 Early fertility rates and trends\nDespite the fact that adolescent sexual activity has increased in recent decades, rates of\nteen childbearing for women have declined considerably, with the exception of a brief\nperiod in the late 1980s (Ventura and Bachrach, 2000). The drop in teen childbearing\nhas been attributed to several factors, including the decline in marriage and greater use\nof more effective contraception (Bachrach 1998). While trends in female fertility are\nwell documented, trends in early male fertility have typically not been examined. In\npart this is due to data limitations: Vital Statistics data does not consistently include\ninformation on the age of the father at the time of the birth. Importantly, the data is\nmissing in a systematic manner. Married women and older women are much more\nlikely to report the age of the child's father than are young and unmarried women\nHynes et al.: The transition to early fatherhood\n340 http://www.demographic-research.org\nOne might expect trends in early parenthood among men to mirror those\npreviously found among women. However, levels of early parenthood may differ for\nmen and women due to age differences between teen mothers and the fathers of their\nchildren. Research based on the 1995 NSFG finds that more than half of the women\nwho were sexually active in their teens had their first sexual intercourse with partners\nwho were two or more years older than they were (Elo, King, and Furstenberg 1999).\nData based on the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (NMIHS) indicates\nthat 52\u00ad60% of infants born to teen mothers had fathers who were two or more years\nolder than the mother (Landry and Forrest 1995). Not surprisingly, studies show that\nmen are substantially less likely to have teen births than are women (Glick, Ruf, White,\nand Goldscheider 1996; Michael and Tuma 1985). It is also plausible that changes\nacross cohorts in rates of early parenthood differ for men and women. To the extent\nthat age differences between teen mothers and their partners are increasing or\ndecreasing over time, we would expect sex differences in levels of teen parenthood to\nbecome more or less pronounced.\n2.2 Defining \"early\" male fertility\nEarly fertility is a relative term, implying that there is also on-time fertility and late\nfertility (Hogan and Astone 1986; Rindfuss, Morgan, and Swicegood 1988). But how\nshould we define early fertility and might the definition of early fertility differ for\nwomen and men (Hogan and Astone 1986)? A developmental approach would identify\nearly fertility as occurring early enough in the life course to systematically lead to\nnegative outcomes for parents and children. With only limited research on the impacts\nof early fertility for men (Nock 1998), however, we do not have enough guidance to\nknow the age at which men are likely to be prepared for parenthood. In addition, men\nare likely not prepared for parenthood at a standard age, but after they have reached a\ncertain level of maturity and have completed transitions into stable employment and\nrelationships (Rindfuss, Morgan, and Swicegood 1988). However, these precursors are\ndifficult to measure and are often not one-way transitions.\nGiven the difficulty in identifying an adequate definition of \"early\" fatherhood, we\nhave chosen to take a life course approach (George 1993) by examining fatherhood\nfrom ages 15 \u00ad 24 in order to understand the dynamics of early fertility.5 This age\nrange spans the early teenage years, the years when some men are working and others\nare in college, and beyond. Examining fatherhood through the mid-20s should provide\ninformation on fertility patterns for different subgroups of the population. It also allows\n5 A similar life course approach to examining early fertility for women and men across a range of years has\nbeen taken by Rindfuss, Morgan, and Swicegood (1988) and by Jaffee, Caspi, and Moffitt (2001).\nDemographic Research: Volume 18, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 341\nus to examine whether the family background characteristics associated with early\nfatherhood change in salience across the early adult years.\n2.3 Theory and prior research on factors associated with early fertility transitions\nA large body of work examines the correlates of early female fertility (see Hofferth and\nHayes 1987 for a review), and a small but rapidly growing literature explicitly looks at\nearly male fertility (Jaffee, Caspi, and Moffitt 2001; Michael and Tuma 1985; Rindfuss,\nMorgan, and Swicegood 1988). Much of the work on early fertility has used an\neconomic or rational choice model that highlights the role of opportunity costs in\ndecisions about childbearing (Duncan and Hoffman 1990; Leibowitz, Eisen, and Chow\n1986; Lundberg and Plotnick 1995). According to this theoretical model, childbearing\nand childrearing interfere with educational and labor market experiences that are\nimportant for career attainment and financial well-being because of both the time and\nfinancial costs involved. Individuals who perceive fewer long-term opportunities for\nhigher education or professional careers are more likely to have early births because the\nopportunity costs of these births are lower, whereas those who expect greater\nopportunities are likely to delay fertility.\nOf course the assumption of rational decision-making may be more applicable to\nthe behavior of adults than adolescents. Appropriately, studies of early parenthood\nfocus not only on the role of opportunity costs, but on socialization, social control,\nstress, and risk preferences as well (McLanahan and Bumpass 1988; Plotnick 1992;\ndemographic studies, these various theoretical constructs are often proxied by the same\nvariables due to the limited information available in large data sets. For example,\ngrowing up in a single parent family and having parents with low education levels could\ncapture low educational aspirations and low wage prospects, or could be associated\nwith low levels of monitoring, stressful life events, and living in a neighborhood with\npeers who are also engaging in risky behavior.\nIt is also plausible that the association between family background characteristics\nand early fertility is not uniform. Certain background characteristics may be more\nsalient in the teenage years, while others may be more closely linked to fertility in the\nearly 20s. Similarly, factors that are associated with early fertility for women may be\nless strongly associated with early fertility for men. There may also be differences in\nthe association between background characteristics and early fertility for women and\nmen from different racial/ethnic groups or for women and men of different birth cohorts\n(Rindfuss, Morgan, and Swicegood 1988). With the availability of large data sets, it is\nHynes et al.: The transition to early fatherhood\n342 http://www.demographic-research.org\npossible to examine whether there are variations in the association between background\ncharacteristics and early fertility by sex, age, race, and cohort.\nTheoretically, opportunity costs may differ for men and women because of the\ntraditionally different roles mothers and fathers play in childrearing. Most studies have\nfocused on women's fertility and assume that mothers do most of the caregiving,\nmaking child-rearing time intensive for women. Studies generally find that the\ncompeting time demands of school/work and family roles reduce the fertility of women\nin young adulthood. In particular, high educational aspirations and variables that are\nproxies for anticipated higher education and wages are negatively associated with early\nThe more limited research on early male fertility indicates that men with fewer\nopportunities are similarly more likely to experience early fertility than their\ncounterparts from more advantaged backgrounds (Glick, Ruf, White, and Goldscheider\nSwicegood 1988). As men's family roles are changing, however, defining opportunity\ncosts for men is arguably less straightforward than it is for women and will likely\ndepend on whether the birth occurs within marriage. The typical role for men is that of\nan economic provider, not a caregiver. Early fatherhood may result in men leaving\nschool to enter the workforce in order to support their children (Nock 1998). This may\nbe a salient consequence, especially for teens with high educational aspirations.\nHowever, for men after their early 20s or for those who do not intend to attend college,\nbecoming a father may not alter the timing of labor market participation. Therefore, we\nmight expect the deterrent effect of family background variables that proxy higher\neducational attainment to be weaker for men than for women after the teenage years and\nparticularly after age 22, when many men have completed college. On the other hand,\nmen tend to be partnered with women from similar socio-economic and educational\nbackgrounds who are several years younger than they are, thus women's opportunity\ncosts of early fertility may reduce men's fertility later in the life course.\nThe association between family background and early fertility may also differ for\nwomen and men based on differences in their ability to influence fertility decisions. On\nthe one hand, there may be weaker links between men's characteristics and their\nfertility decisions if women have more ability to control fertility by using birth control\nor having an abortion. On the other hand, men (particularly those having relationships\nwith younger teenage women) may exert more decision-making power in relationships,\nDemographic Research: Volume 18, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 343\ncoercing women into engaging in behaviors that perhaps they otherwise would not\nThere is some empirical evidence suggesting differences in the background factors\nassociated with early fertility for women and men, but the evidence is not consistent.\nSome studies indicate that the effects of socioeconomic status or maternal education on\nearly fertility may be weaker for men than for women (Michael and Tuma 1985; Xie,\nCairns, and Cairns 2001), though others find roughly equivalent effects of\nsocioeconomic status on fertility for women and men (Barber 2001; Rindfuss, Morgan,\nand Swicegood 1988; Glick, Ruf, White, and Goldscheider 2006). Studies also have\ninconsistent conclusions about whether family structure during youth is associated with\nearly fertility for men, with some studies corroborating the link between single parent\nhouseholds and early fertility found for women (Jaffee et al. 2001; Ku, Sonenstein, and\nPleck 1993), but others finding no association between family structure and early male\nfertility (Glick, Ruf, White, and Goldscheider 2006; Hanson, Morris, and Ginsburg\nLack of consistency in the literature on early male fertility is not surprising.\nSeveral of the studies are from small samples (Jaffee, Caspi, and Moffitt 2001; Pears et\nal. 2005; Xie, Cairns, and Cairns 2001) or samples drawn from birth cohorts spanning a\nperiod of rapid demographic and social change, and the measures of family structure\nand socioeconomic status are not consistent across studies. It is unclear whether these\ndifferences in results are due to variation in sample size and composition, data quality,\nvariable construction, or historical circumstances.\nA basic premise of the opportunity cost model is that early fertility interferes with\neducation and career development, which also occur early in the life course. Those\nwith greater opportunities for advancement will delay fertility in order to avoid\nincurring these costs. At some point in the life course the association between\ndisadvantaged family background and the likelihood of a first birth will weaken and\npotentially reverse. This may occur in the late 20s or early 30s, indicating that those\nfrom more advantaged backgrounds are more likely to have a first birth at these older\nages. Studies using a life course approach offer conflicting evidence about when this\nturning point occurs, with some finding differences in the association between\nbackground characteristics and fertility for teens versus adults in their early 20s and\nothers not (Jaffee, Caspi and Moffitt 2001; Rindfuss, Morgan and Swicegood 1988).\nHynes et al.: The transition to early fatherhood\n344 http://www.demographic-research.org\nThere may be differences in the effect of background variables by race, to the extent\nthat race/ethnicity is associated with multiple unmeasured constructs. For example,\nmother's education or family structure may be proxies for neighborhood and peer group\neffects, but the relationship between these observable and unobservable characteristics\nis likely to vary across race/ethnicity in part because of differences in neighborhood\nsegregation and the concentration of poverty across different race/ethnic groups. In\naddition, if social mobility differs across race/ethnic groups, then mother's education\nmay be differentially associated with the youth's expected economic and educational\nopportunities across race/ethnic groups. Studies that are large enough to examine\nwhether there are race differences in the association between family background\ncharacteristics and early fertility note that background characteristics are more strongly\nassociated with early fertility for white men than for African-American men (Rindfuss,\nIt is unclear whether there will be differences in the influence of family background\ncharacteristics on very early male fertility by cohort. The costs of early births were\nhigh for men from early cohorts where marriage was more common, but are likely to\nhave diminished for men from more recent cohorts where non-marital births are more\nprevalent. Offsetting this trend, however, is an increase in child support enforcement\nthat should reduce the likelihood of early fertility by increasing men's costs. Both non-\nmarital births and the enforcement of child support have increased over the past decades\n(Karant and Sorensen 1999), making it difficult to predict whether the net change in\nopportunity costs is positive or negative. In addition, it is possible that child support is\nmore of a deterrent for advantaged than for disadvantaged men. Mothers with low\neducation levels are less likely to have a child support award in place than mothers with\nhigher education levels (Committee on Ways and Means 2004). If child support\nprimarily deters early fertility for more advantaged men who already have incentives to\navoid fatherhood, then cohort differences may not be as apparent.\n3. The current study\nThis study seeks to provide basic information on the transition to early fatherhood by\ndescribing patterns of early fertility and comparing those patterns for women and men\nDemographic Research: Volume 18, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 345\nby race, cohort, and data set. Additionally, this research systematically examines\nwhether characteristics of the respondent's family of origin such as family structure,\nmaternal education, maternal employment, nativity, and race are associated with early\ntransitions to fatherhood. We organize our analyses around the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1: Disadvantaged family background will be associated with early\nfertility. This pattern is suggested by both the economic and sociological frameworks\ndiscussed previously.\nHypothesis 2: The association between family background and early fertility will\nbe weaker for men than for women (when such differences exist).\nHypothesis 3: The association between family background characteristics and\nfertility will weaken at older ages for both women and men. This weakening may be\nmore apparent for men than for women.\nHypothesis 4: The association between family background characteristics and\nearly fertility will differ based on race/ethnicity given the limited set of background\ncharacteristics included in the models. In particular, the associations are likely to be\nstronger for whites than for minorities.\nHypothesis 5: Cohort differences in the association between family background\nand early male fertility are uncertain, given the offsetting trends in non-marital births\nand child support enforcement.\nHypothesis 6: Despite coding the data in similar ways, we expect to observe some\ndifferences between data sets in the factors that are significantly associated with early\nmale fertility due to differences in sample composition, methods of data collection, and\ncohort.\nWhile we expect that results for Hypotheses 1 \u00ad 4 will confirm the general patterns\nfound in prior research, this study makes several unique contributions. First, we present\nprevalence estimates and multivariate results from two relatively new data sets, the\nNLSY97 and the 2002 NSFG. These data sources include respondents from more recent\nbirth cohorts and will likely be used by other studies in the future. Second, we run\nparallel models with similarly coded variables in these data sets and in the NLSY79 to\nexamine whether there are differences across data sets in results. These differences\nmay be due to sample composition, data collection differences, or changes over time in\nthe prevalence of background characteristics and their associations with early fertility.\nHynes et al.: The transition to early fatherhood\n346 http://www.demographic-research.org\nMost researchers run analyses in a single data set given the considerable time costs\ninvolved in preparing data sources for analyses. The aim of this paper is not to tease\nout the cause of these differences or to provide tests for whether observed differences\nbetween data sets are statistically significant. Instead, our goal is to provide researchers\nwith information about where results are robust across data sets and where analyses\nconducted in different data sets net different results.\nThis study relies on data from three sources: The 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of\nYouth (NLSY79), the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), and the\n2002 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). These data sets were selected\nbecause they provide information on men's fertility behavior from large, nationally\nrepresentative samples. In addition, the data sets provide overlapping information on\nmale fertility across birth cohorts ranging from 1957\u00ad1984, allowing for an examination\nof fertility behavior over time and an assessment of the consistency of fertility reports\nacross data sets.\nproviding large, nationally representative samples of women and men born between\nRespondents were interviewed annually or biennially over time in order to collect\ndetailed economic and demographic histories. Both surveys provide extensive\ninformation on respondents' family background as well as their employment, income,\nand had largely completed their reproductive years. Respondents in the NLSY97 were\n19\u00ad23 in 2003, and therefore only contribute information about very early births to this\nThe 2002 National Survey of Family Growth, in contrast, is a nationally\nrepresentative cross-sectional sample of women and men aged 15\u00ad44 who reside in\nhouseholds. The NSFG is designed to provide estimates of factors affecting the U.S.\nbirth rate, family formation, and reproductive health among males and females (Abma\n2002). Due to the age range of respondents in the NSFG, we can break the NSFG\noverlap significantly with the two NLSY cohorts. This strategy allows us to compare\n6 While attrition is an issue in all longitudinal studies, its impact on this analysis is minimized because we are\nusing data primarily from the early years of the surveys, when attrition is low.\nDemographic Research: Volume 18, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 347\npatterns of early fertility over time and across data sets. All three data sets include\nminority over-samples, allowing us to conduct analyses separately by race.7\n5. Measures\n5.1 Age at first birth\nThe dependent variable in this study is based on the respondent's age at first birth.\nFertility data is collected differently across the surveys. In the NLSY79 and the\nNLSY97, respondents are asked at each interview about their fertility behavior.\nFertility data is collected separately from information about changes in the respondent's\nrelationship status.8 In contrast, the NSFG collects male fertility data in the context of\nrelationship data in hopes of eliciting higher reports of non-marital fertility (Lindberg et\nal. 1998).9 It is unclear which data set will contain better male fertility information,\ngiven that the NLSY surveys have the advantage of a shorter recall period while the\nNSFG has the advantage of collecting fertility data in the context of relationship\nhistories.\n5.2 Quality of male fertility data\nPrevious research has found substantial under-reporting of fathering and under-\nrepresentation of fathers in a number of national data sets (Rendall et al. 1999; Cherlin\nand Griffith 1998). There are several reasons why data quality issues may be less of a\nproblem in these data sets. First, two of our data sets (NLSY79 and NLSY97) are panel\ndata sets, allowing for the collection of fertility data shortly after births occur. Rendall\net al. (1999) suggest that panel data are likely to capture a higher proportion of male\nfertility than retrospective data. Second, in response to a general lack of available data\n7 The original NLSY79 included a military over-sample, a minority over-sample, and a poor white over-\nsample. Only the minority over-sample was retained for analyses. Descriptive results are weighted using the\nsample of respondents still in the survey in 2002.\n8 Considerable attention has been paid to the quality of fertility data in the NLSY79 and to cleaning up the\nmale fertility data (Mott and Gryn 2001). This study uses variables available in the public-use NLYS79 data\nto create best estimates of women's age at first birth and data compiled by Mott for male fertility that includes\nthe best estimate of the date of each birth, as well as codes indicating the degree of confidence in indicators\nthat the child is a biological child of the male respondent. We have deleted births from men's fertility records\nif the paternity confidence code indicates it is \"reasonably\" and \"virtually\" certain that the child is not a\nbiological child of the respondent, as we are interested in the transition to biological fatherhood.\n9 There is less concern about women underreporting their fertility, so fertility questions are not asked in the\ncontext of relationship data. Instead, information about births is collected as part of complete pregnancy\nhistories.\nHynes et al.: The transition to early fatherhood\n348 http://www.demographic-research.org\non male fertility and concerns about male fertility data quality, improved practices for\ncollecting male fertility were incorporated into data collection efforts such as the\nWe are currently assessing the quality of male fertility reports in these three data\nsets. Comparisons of age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) in each data set to estimates\nof men's fertility from Vital Statistics data show slightly lower ASFRs for men in the\nsurveys compared to Vital Statistics data. However, the ASFRs calculated from Vital\nStatistics data generally fall within the confidence intervals surrounding the ASFRs\nfrom the three data sets used in this analysis, with only the youngest cohort in the\nNSFG falling outside of the confidence interval at ages 18\u00ad19 (Peters et al. 2006). This\nconclusion is tempered because Vital Statistics data on father's age is missing from a\nsubstantial proportion of records, and the strategy employed for imputing the father's\nage may bias the Vital Statistics calculations (see Rendall et al. 2006, for a description\nof the methods and its limitations).\nThird, Rendall et al. (2006) used the NSFG to compare men's ASFRs calculated\nusing the mother's reports of the father's age, with those rates calculated using reports\nfrom men in the sample for the period of 1991-2000. Similar to our findings comparing\nmen's reports in the NSFG to imputed Vital Statistics data, men were found to be\nunder-reporting births when they were young (ages 18\u00ad21), leading us again to worry\nabout under-reporting of early births in the NSFG. Some of the discrepancies between\nfemale and male reports in the NSFG may be due to the under-representation of men\nwho may be in prison or other institutions. The problem of under-representation may\nbe less of an issue for panel data sets (such as the NLSY surveys) that observe\nrespondents closer to the time of the child's birth.\n5.3 Family background characteristics\nBecause of our interest in comparing results across data sets, the multivariate models in\nthis analysis rely on family background characteristics that are likely to be associated\nwith early fertility and are available in all three data sets. Due to well-documented\ndifferences in family formation behavior by race, results are presented for three\nrace/ethnic groups when possible: Hispanics, non-Hispanic African-Americans, and\nnon-Hispanic whites (respondents who specify other races are included in the non-\nHispanic white category).10 The education level of the respondent's mother (or mother-\nfigure in the NSFG) is included as a categorical variable: less than a high school\n10 Respondents of \"other\" races are only a small percent of the sample, for example they are 3.6% of the\nNLSY97 and 6.2% of the men in the NSFG. This group is not large enough to examine separately; thus, we\ndecided to include other-race respondents with whites instead of omitting them from analyses.\nDemographic Research: Volume 18, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 349\neducation, high school degree or GED, and more than a high school education. The\nrespondent's family structure during adolescence is measured with a series of dummy\nvariables:11 respondent lived with both biological parents, respondent lived with one\nbiological parent and a step-parent,12 respondent lived with a single parent, and\nrespondent lived with neither biological parent. Analyses include a dummy variable\nindicating whether the respondent is foreign born (1=yes, 0=no) and another indicating\nwhether the respondent's mother (or adult female figure in the household) was\nemployed when the respondent was 14 (1=employed, 0=not employed).13 Descriptive\nstatistics for all independent variables are presented for men in Table 1a and for women\nDescriptive statistics are weighted and the sample used in descriptive analyses\nvaries slightly across tables due to censoring. In both the NLSY97 and the NSFG, there\nare individuals who have not completed the risk period (for instance, who were 18 at\nthe last wave of data collection). Logistic regression models can handle censoring;\nthese individuals can contribute spells up to the point they are censored. Tables 1a and\n1b include weighted descriptive statistics for all individuals included in the logistic\nregression analyses. Later tables on the prevalence of early fertility require that we\nremove these censored individuals from our analyses so we can calculate the percent of\nthe sample experiencing a birth, given completion of the risk period. Therefore, later\ndescriptive tables have smaller sample sizes for the NSFG and the NLSY97.\n11 In the NLSY97, family structure and maternal employment were measured at the first interview, when\nrespondents were between the ages of 12 \u00ad 17; in the NSFG and NLSY79 the variable reports family structure\n12 These questions did not specifically ask if the step-parent was married to or cohabiting with the\nrespondent's biological parent, thus it was up to the respondent to decide whether their parent's partner\nconstituted a \"step-parent\".\n13 In the NSFG the question is about mother's usual employment \"when you were growing up, that is when\nyou were between the ages of 5 and 15.\"\n14 Missing data was handled uniformly across data sets. If a variable was missing for more than 5% of the\nsample, a missing data category was added to that variable. Other variables had only small amounts of\nmissing data, making a dedicated imputation flag unnecessary. Variables with fewer than 5% of the cases\nmissing were imputed with the modal category, and respondents were coded \"1\" on an imputation flag if any\nof the remaining variables contained missing data. Notes under each multivariate table indicate the models\nthat include different imputation flags.\nHynes et al.: The transition to early fatherhood\n350 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 1a: Descriptive statistics for men's analysis variables,\nby race and data set\nWhite African-American Hispanic\nMaternal education\nFamily structure at age 14\nNotes: Descriptive statistics are weighted.

Differences between race/ethnic\ngroups on these characteristics are well-documented elsewhere (Blau, Ferber, and\nWinkler, 2006; U.S. Census Bureau, 2004). Differences between data sets are also not\nsurprising for two reasons. First, there have been significant changes in maternal\neducation, family structure, and maternal employment across the cohorts covered by\nthese datasets (Bianchi and Casper 2000; Blau, Ferber, and Winkler 2006; U.S. Census\nBureau, 2004). Data from the oldest cohort, the NLSY79 shows lower maternal\neducation, more two-parent families, and less maternal employment than the NLSY97.\nThe NSFG includes data from respondents born from many cohorts spanning these two\nlongitudinal surveys, thus estimates are generally between those of the NLSY79 and the\nSecond, the Hispanic sample in the NSFG is substantially different from the\nHispanic sample in the NLSY surveys: Hispanics in the NLSY surveys would have\nbeen born in the U.S. or immigrated as children, whereas Hispanics in the NSFG could\nhave been born in the U.S. or immigrated at various points in adulthood. Note the\ndifference in the percent foreign born between the Hispanics in the NLSYs and in the\nNSFG. This sample composition difference is reflected perhaps most strongly in the\nlow levels of maternal education found among Hispanics in the NSFG.\n6. Methods\nWe first provide a detailed description of early fertility behavior by age, sex, race, data\nset, and cohort. Results from the NLSY97 are only presented through age 19, as the\nsample size of respondents who were older than 19 in 2003 declines for each\nsubsequent age. Only respondents who reached age 20 in the NLSY97 and age 25 in\nthe NLSY79 and NSFG are included in descriptive results of the prevalence of early\nfertility. All descriptive statistics are weighted.\nNext we examine the demographic factors associated with early births for men and\nwomen, using discrete-time event history logistic regression models based on person-\nyear data sets. The age of the respondent and the dependent variable indicating whether\nthe respondent experienced a birth (0 = no, 1 = yes) at a given age are time varying.\nThe risk period begins at age 15 (given the small number of births prior to this age) and\nends at age 24. Few men experience first births prior to age 17, so we separate our risk\nAppendix A indicates the number of births in each age range from which models are\nestimated.\nHynes et al.: The transition to early fatherhood\n352 http://www.demographic-research.org\nWe run all models separately for women and men (Hypothesis 2) and present\nresults for models from each data set side-by-side to facilitate comparisons of results\n(Hypothesis 6). We estimate separate logistic regression models on spells within each\nage range in order to observe the association between the background characteristics\nand the likelihood of a first birth during those ages. We then estimate a model that\nincludes spells from ages 15\u00ad24 and interacts age with each of the independent\nvariables to test for significant differences in the effects of the independent variables by\nage (Hypothesis 3). Significant interactions by age are indicated by bold coefficients in\nthe tables.15 Models in the NLSY surveys are clustered by household to account for\nsiblings in the data; all models use robust standard errors.\nWe then estimate very similar models but test for race differences in the\nassociation between family background and fertility behavior. Within each age group\nand sex, we estimate models separately for whites, African-Americans, and Hispanics,\nthen pool the data to test for significant differences in the effects of the covariates by\nrace (Hypothesis 4). We also pool the data for women and men in each race/ethnic\ngroup and present a summary table highlighting effects that are significantly different\nby sex (Hypothesis 2).\nThe last set of multivariate results relies on the NSFG to test for cohort differences\nin the effects of family background characteristics, as the NSFG is the only data set that\nincludes respondents from multiple birth cohorts (Hypothesis 5). Due to the small\nsample sizes that result when the NSFG is broken down by cohort, multivariate models\ncannot be further subdivided by race.16\n7. Results\n7.1 Describing early male fertility\nIn order to understand early fertility, it is useful to see the full distribution of ages at\nfirst birth. Figures 1a and 1b present the weighted age distribution of first births for\nwomen and men by race. These figures are based on the NLSY79, as this is the only\ndata set in which the majority of respondents are nearing the end of their prime\nreproductive years. As previous research has shown, African-American and Hispanic\nwomen and men experience earlier first births than white women and men. Not only\nare the births earlier, but the distribution is much more sharply skewed toward early\n15 Results from all interaction models are available from the authors on request.\n16 In all multivariate models, respondents from all data sets are included regardless of whether they completed\nthe full risk period or not, as discrete-time logistic regression models can handle censoring. Multivariate\nmodels are not weighted.\nDemographic Research: Volume 18, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 353\nbirths. For both African-American and Hispanic women and men, there are clear\n\"peak\" fertility years, when a large percent of the population experiences a first birth.\nAfter these early peaks, the rate of first births slows considerably and, especially for\nwomen, drops well below the white rate of first births at older ages. For white women\nand men, the peak fertility years are more evenly distributed across a larger number of\nyears and older ages.\nFigure 1a: Distribution of men's age at first birth in the NLSY79, by race\nAge at First Birth\nPercent\nWhite Men\nAf.

Results and weight based on sample still in panel in 2002 in order to avoid\nmiscoding attrition as no birth, thus percent with birth a particular age differs slightly from numbers reported in Table 2 which\nuses respondents in the panel through age 25.\nWhile the shape of the age distribution of first births is similar for women and\nmen, the timing of these births differs. As prior research has shown, women experience\nearlier first births than men. For white women from the NLSY79, peak fertility is from\nthe late teenage years through the mid-20s, while for white men high rates of first births\nare apparent from the early 20s until about age 30. The risk period that we have\nidentified for multivariate models in this study goes through age 24. Thus for men of\nall races, fertility before these peak first birth years has been captured and the risk\nperiod covers several years into, and in some cases beyond, the peak ages of first births.\nTable 2a shows race differences in the cumulative percent of men experiencing a\nfirst birth by a given age across the three data sets. Table 2b provides identical results\nfor women. The sample for each data set includes only individuals for whom we have\nIndividuals who left the longitudinal samples before reaching these ages or who had not\ncompleted this risk period at the time of data collection are excluded from these tables.\nFor this reason, the sample sizes here differ from those in Tables 1a and 1b. Compared\nto women, very few men experience teen births. While 15\u00ad17% of white women\nexperience a birth before age 20, only 5\u00ad7% of white men experience such early births.\nBy age 24, 40\u00ad42% of white women have experienced a first birth, compared to\nDemographic Research: Volume 18, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 355\n25\u00ad27% of white men. While teenage births for white men are rare, teenage births for\nminority men are more common, but still occur at a substantially lower rate than for\nminority women. Only 11\u00ad12% of Hispanic men experience a first birth before age 20,\ncompared to 29\u00ad32% of Hispanic women. Births to African-American male teens are\nslightly more common (15\u00ad17%) but are still rare compared to African-American\nResearch by Landry and Forrest (1995) indicates that the average age difference\nbetween women who give birth before age 20 and the fathers of their children is 3.2\u00ad3.6\nyears. Looking within race/ethnicity groups, these tables largely confirm that early\nmale fertility is about 3 years later than early female fertility. For instance, 25 \u00ad 31% of\nAfrican-American women have had a first birth by age 18, while 27\u00ad33% of African-\nAmerican males have had a first birth by age 21. Similarly, 22\u00ad23% of Hispanic\nwomen have had a first birth by age 18, while 24\u00ad25% of Hispanic men have had a first\nTable 2a: Cumulative percent of men experiencing an early first birth,\nby race and data set\nWhite African-American Hispanic\nNotes: Cumulative percent estimates include all individuals including those who have not experienced a birth.

Thus individuals who left the longitudinal samples before these ages or who had not\nyet reached these ages at the time of data collection are excluded.\nHynes et al.: The transition to early fatherhood\n356 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 2b: Cumulative percent of women experiencing an early first\nbirth, by race and data set\nWhite African-American Hispanic\nNotes: Cumulative percent estimates include all individuals including those who have not experienced a birth.

Thus individuals who left the longitudinal samples before these ages or who had not\nyet reached these ages at the time of data collection are excluded.\nDifferences across data sets are small but apparent. For instance, the NSFG data\nshows lower rates of early male fertility for African-American men than do the other\ntwo data sets. This may be due to data quality issues or it may be due to sample\ncomposition differences (institutionalized men are not in the NSFG sample). Further,\nprevalence differences may be due to the different cohorts spanned by the data sets. For\nthe cohort analyses, the NSFG has been divided into three birth cohorts (1957\u00ad1964,\ndescriptive statistics on trends in early fertility across cohorts, however, is challenging\nfor two reasons. First, when divided into cohorts these subgroups are small in the\nNSFG. Second, as research on women's early fertility indicates, trends in teen fertility\nfrom the 1970s on were not linear, but rather the rates of teen fertility fluctuated.\nFigure 2 presents our calculations of trends in teen fertility from the Vital Statistics for\n17 A large proportion of birth certificates do not include information about the age of the father. To generate\nthese estimates, we have imputed the missing data for men for women giving birth at each age, based on the\ndistribution of the fathers' ages available in records with complete information (see Rendall et al. (2006) for a\ndescription of the imputation method used to assign father's age to cases where this information was missing\nand for a discussion of the limitations of this method).\nDemographic Research: Volume 18, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 357\nYear\nBirths to Individuals 15 to 19 / Population\nWomen\nMen\nNotes: Estimates based on authors' calculations from Vital Statistics data. Fertility rates are for all births ages 15 \u00ad 19, not just first\nbirths. Cases with missing age of first birth for fathers were imputed. See Rendall et al. 2006 for a description of the method.\nThe Vital Statistics data includes all births to teens, not just first births, but it\nprovides a basis for discussing descriptive information on first births across cohorts.\nUsing Vital Statistics data to calculate age-specific fertility rates for women is\nstraightforward. As noted earlier, the substantial proportion of missing data for father's\nage (especially for the fathers of births to teen mothers) makes our calculation of these\nrates for men more problematic. Figure 2 shows the downward trend in women's teen\nfertility across the 1970s, then the sharp upturn in the early 1990s and the more gradual\ndecline across the late 1990s. As discussed previously, men's rates of early fertility are\nmuch lower and they follow a pattern that is similar in shape but less pronounced.\nWe have inserted lines on Figure 2 showing the years that each of our samples\nwere ages 15\u00ad19. Cohort 2 in the NSFG (C2) includes years with low teen fertility but\nalso includes all of the years of the sharp increase in teen fertility. Cohort 3 in the\nNSFG (C3) includes the peak teen fertility years of the 1990s as well as the lower\nfertility rates around the year 2000. In contrast, respondents in the NLSY97 were only\n15\u00ad19 during the declining early fertility years of the late 1990s. Thus we do not\nexpect that descriptive statistics from these data sets will show a declining pattern in the\npercent of first births to teenagers across these NSFG cohorts. We should find,\nHynes et al.: The transition to early fatherhood\n358 http://www.demographic-research.org\nhowever, that women in Cohort 3 from the NSFG have higher rates of first births as\nteens than women in the NLSY97. For men, it is less likely that we will see these\ndifferences, because the peaks and valleys in the Vital Statistics data are far less\npronounced.\nTable 3a: Percent of men experiencing a first birth, by age and cohort\nNotes: Percent estimates include all individuals including those who have not experienced a birth. Descriptive statistics are\nweighted. Only individuals who have reached age 20 in the NLSY97 and 25 in the NSFG are included.\nTable 3b: Percent of women experiencing a first birth, by age and cohort\nNotes: Percent estimates include all individuals including those who have not experienced a birth. Descriptive statistics are\nweighted. Only individuals who have reached age 20 in the NLSY97 and 25 in the NSFG are included.\nTables 3a and 3b show the percent of men and women experiencing a first birth at\nvarious ages, by cohort. To accommodate the small cell sizes in the NSFG, we have\ncombined the sample into the four categories that we will use for analysis in our\nare some differences in the percentage of men experiencing their first birth at particular\nages. For example, in the NLSY79 there are slightly fewer first births in the 18\u00ad19\nrange than in the first NSFG cohort (5.4% vs. 6.9%), and there are slightly more first\nBecause the NLSY79 and Cohort 1 in the NSFG overlap perfectly, this variation may\nDemographic Research: Volume 18, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 359\nbe due to differences in either fertility reports or the sample composition of the two data\nsets. As mentioned earlier, sample composition differences occur because the NSFG\ncollects retrospective fertility data on a cross-section of the non-institutionalized U.S.\npopulation in 2002, whereas the NLSY79 collects panel data on respondents who were\nliving in the U.S. prior to the beginning of the survey (when respondents were ages 14\u00ad\n21). Thus, the NSFG has a much larger proportion of Hispanics than are in the\nNLSY79, because NSFG respondents could have migrated to the U.S. after the ages of\n14\u00ad21. In addition, the NSFG may include a smaller sample of fathers reporting early\nbirths, because the risk of early fathering is likely to be correlated with the risk of\nincarceration, and institutionalized men are not in the NSFG sampling frame. Cohort 3\nof the NSFG shows the expected pattern of slightly higher average early fertility for\nwomen compared to the NLSY97. For men however, the pattern is not clear, with more\nbirths in C3 of the NSFG (3.6% vs. 2.8%) for men younger than 18 but fewer births\n7.2 The association between family background and early fertility\nWe present several sets of multivariate models. The first seeks to understand whether\nthere are differences in the effects of family background characteristics across the early\nfertility age range (Hypothesis 3). The second set of analyses examine whether there\nare race differences in these results (Hypothesis 4), and whether there are sex\ndifferences within racial groups (Hypothesis 2). The third tests for cohort differences in\nthe NSFG (Hypothesis 5). All analyses are presented for men, replicated for women\n(Hypothesis 2), and run separately by data set (Hypothesis 6). Given the large number\nof multivariate results presented, we focus our discussion of results on these\nhypotheses.\nTable 4a shows results from nine discrete-time logistic regression models. Each\nrow represents a separate logistic regression model, with the coefficients for selected\nindependent variables in each column. The first three rows of results show the\nassociation between family background characteristics and the likelihood of\nexperiencing a birth before age 20 from the NLSY79, the NSFG, and the NLSY97\nrespectively. The next two rows examine whether family background characteristics\nare associated with the likelihood of experiencing a birth between ages 20\u00ad22 in the\nNLSY79 and the NSFG. (We have not estimated models in the NLSY97 for ages\n20\u00ad24 because only a proportion of respondents had reached these ages by 2002). Two\nmore rows examine the likelihood of experiencing a first birth between ages 23\u00ad24.\nWe summarize the results of models that include spells from ages 15\u00ad24, age dummy\nvariables, and interactions between a categorical age variable and each independent\nHynes et al.: The transition to early fatherhood\n360 http://www.demographic-research.org\nvariable. Coefficients that are in bold indicate that the odds of experiencing a first birth\nbetween ages 15\u00ad19 (or 20\u00ad22) differ significantly from the odds of experiencing a\nbirth between ages 23\u00ad24 (the comparison group in the interaction models).\nTable 4a: Logistic regression models: Odds of first birth for men, by age\nMen Af.

These race\ndifferences are not as strong at ages 23\u00ad24; they are no longer significant in the\nNLSY79 and they are significantly weaker for African-American men in the NSFG.\nEducation effects are also in the expected direction: Men whose mothers have less than\na high school degree are more likely to have early births while men whose mothers\nhave education beyond high school are less likely to have early births. These education\neffects do not decline with age.\nDemographic Research: Volume 18, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 361\nTable 4b: Logistic regression models: Odds of first birth for women, by age\nWomen Af.

Like the race/ethnicity effects,\nhowever, the coefficients become smaller with age, and being raised in a single parent\nfamily is not associated with births at ages 20\u00ad22 or 23\u00ad24. Living in a step-family at\nage 14 is consistently associated with early births: This family structure effect is\nconsistent for births through ages 20\u00ad22 and in the NSFG is still significant at ages\nRespondents who were born outside of the U.S. are less likely to experience a teen\nbirth than respondents born in the U.S., controlling for other family background\ncharacteristics. This difference in fertility behavior by nativity is not apparent at older\nages. Maternal employment during the respondent's adolescence is not associated with\nearly fertility in any data set.\nRelevant to Hypothesis 6, the factors in Table 4a that are associated with teen\nbirths are relatively consistent across data sets. At ages 23\u00ad24, however, results are less\nconsistent across data sets, with the race/ethnicity and step-parent effects no longer\napparent in the NLSY79 but still apparent in the NSFG.\nHynes et al.: The transition to early fatherhood\n362 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 4b shows results from the same models for women. The results for women\nare largely consistent across data sets although the difference in magnitude of the\ncoefficients is sometimes large (e.g. the coefficient for low maternal education ranges\nfrom 1.3 to 2.1). As Hypothesis 1 predicts, women from more disadvantaged\nbackgrounds (e.g. women growing up in non-traditional family structures, racial\nminorities, and women with less educated mothers) are more likely to experience early\nfirst births. Similar to our findings for men, being foreign born reduces the likelihood\nof fertility as a teenager, though not in the NLSY97. As Hypothesis 3 predicts, these\nassociations are stronger in the teenage years and weaker (though often still significant)\nHypothesis 3 suggests that the weakening relationship between disadvantage and\nearly fertility with age may be more pronounced for men than for women. Results from\nTables 4a and 4b show that this weakening occurs for both women and men. Although\ndifferences by sex are not pronounced, the models for women contain more significant\nassociations and are more consistent across data sources at 23\u00ad24 than the models for\nmen.\nHypothesis 4 predicts that there may be race differences in the relationships\nbetween family background characteristics and the likelihood of experiencing a first\nbirth at various ages. Consistent with our expectations, we find that disadvantaged\nfamily background is more consistently associated with early male fertility for whites\nthan for racial minorities (see Table 5a). When there are associations between family\nbackground and early fertility for racial minorities, they are in the expected direction.\nLow maternal education is associated with a greater likelihood of early fertility for\nwhite men of all ages, although these effects are much less apparent for minorities,\nparticularly African-American men. Having a mother with more than a high school\neducation is associated with lower early fertility for white men at all ages. Again, the\neffect of high maternal education is not as strong for African-Americans and fades out\nat older ages for Hispanic men.\nDemographic Research: Volume 18, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 363\nTable 5a: Logistic regression models: Odds of first birth for men,\nby age and race\nMEN\nMom\nMom\nStep-Parent\nSingle\nParent\nNo\nParent\nForeign\nBorn\nMatern.\nEmpl.\nN of spells\nNotes: Each row represents a separate logistic regression model.

Coefficients in bold indicate a significant difference\n(white = omitted category) based on models interacting all substantive independent variables with race (p<.10). All interactions\nare tested within age groups.\nThe association between family structure in adolescence and early male fertility is\nmore complex. For white men, living in a step-parent family during adolescence is\nstrongly associated with teen fertility and is still associated with births through ages\n23\u00ad24. In contrast, living in a step-parent family during adolescence is not significantly\nassociated with early fertility for Hispanic men at any age. In two of the three data sets\nthe difference between Hispanics and whites in the association between step-families\nand a first birth at age 15\u00ad19 is statistically significant in the interaction models. For\nAfrican-American men, the results are mixed: There is a strong association between\nHynes et al.: The transition to early fatherhood\n364 http://www.demographic-research.org\nliving in a step-parent family and teen fertility in the NSFG and the NLSY97, but not in\nResults for men raised in single parent families are also mixed. There is some\nevidence that living in a single parent family during adolescence is associated with\nhigher teen fertility for men of all races, although this association is not consistent\nacross data sets. At ages 20\u00ad22 there are few associations between living in a single\nparent family and male fertility. By ages 23\u00ad24 for white and African-American men,\nthere is some indication that being raised in a single parent family is associated with\nfewer births, though this result does not hold for Hispanics and is not consistent across\ndata sets. Maternal employment is not associated with teenage first births for men in\nany model.\nIn sum, results from our analyses support Hypothesis 4, indicating that there are\nsome differences in the associations between family background and early male fertility\nby race/ethnicity, with stronger results for whites than for minorities. When there are\nsignificant associations between family background and early male fertility for\nminorities, they are in the expected direction (a disadvantaged background is associated\nwith a greater likelihood of an early first birth), but the associations are less consistent\nacross data sources. Thus the possibility raised in Hypothesis 6 of inconsistencies\nacross data sets for men is clear when models are run separately by race. Future\nresearch will formally test whether these differences are due to cohort changes or data\nset differences, but scholars performing analyses using these data sources should be\naware of these differences and should exercise caution when interpreting results.\nTable 5b replicates Table 5a by testing for race differences among women. Table\n5b indicates that in some cases family background characteristics are more weakly\nassociated with early fertility for minority women than for white women, similar to the\npattern found for men. For instance, female teens whose mothers have less than a high\nschool education are more likely to have a birth before age 20 if they are white, but the\neffect is weaker for African-American women, and results are mixed for Hispanic\nwomen. While living in a step-parent family is consistently associated with first births\nbefore age 18 for white women, results are inconsistent for African-American women.\nAt ages 20\u00ad22, there are no significant associations between family structure and early\nfertility for African-American women, though there are still associations for white and\nHispanic women.\nDemographic Research: Volume 18, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 365\nTable 5b: Logistic regression models: Odds of first birth for women,\nby age and race\nWOMEN\nMom\nMom\nStep-Parent\nSingle\nParent\nNo\nParent\nForeign\nBorn\nMatern.\nEmpl.\nN of spells\nNotes: Each row represents a separate logistic regression model.

We test this hypothesis formally\nwithin race/ethnic groups. Table 5c summarizes the results of logistic regression\nmodels that formally test for sex differences in the association between family\nbackground characteristics and early fertility. As in the other tables, each row\nrepresents a separate logistic regression model. Cells include a (W) or (M) based on\nDemographic Research: Volume 18, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 367\nwhether the variable is more strongly associated with first births for women or men and\na (+) or (-) depending on whether the variable for the sex with the larger association is\npositively or negatively associated with early fertility. For example, a \"W+\" indicates\nthat women with a particular characteristic are more likely to have an early first birth\nthan men with this same characteristic. Strong evidence of sex differences would be\napparent if effects were similar across data sets and if the evidence followed a\nconsistent pattern. In Table 5c, sex differences appear to be sporadic, not consistent.\nWhile we do not feel there is strong evidence of consistent, theoretically-relevant sex\ndifferences, a few rough patterns deserve mention. Of twenty-three significant sex\ndifferences, fourteen are in the 15\u00ad19 age range and ten of these fourteen indicate\nstronger effects of background characteristics for women than men. In addition, eleven\nof the twenty-three sex differences are in the African-American sample, with five of the\nseven effects that are stronger for women than men occurring during the teenage years.\nThese patterns may indicate that the factors associated with teen fertility are slightly\nstronger for women than men, particularly in the African-American sample, though we\nhave been unable to identify a consistent pattern with theoretical implications. These\nfindings lend the most support to Hypothesis 6, which states that there will be\ndifferences across data sets. For example, results from only the NLSY79 would\nindicate that family structure is more strongly associated with teen fertility for men than\nfor women, but results from the NLSY97 would lead one to the opposite conclusion.\nHypothesis 5 indicates that there may not be significant differences in the effects\nof family background characteristics on early first births for men across cohorts. In\nanalyses conducted with the NSFG, very few significant differences in the effects of\ncovariates were found by cohort, despite large changes over time in patterns of maternal\nemployment, education, and family structure.18\nHowever, we are hesitant to conclude\nthat these differences do not exist, as we cannot analyze the NSFG by race and cohort\nsimultaneously due to small cell sizes. Further research is necessary to test for cohort\ndifferences in the effects of family background characteristics over time.\n8. Discussion\nThis study seeks to provide systematic baseline information on early male fertility by\nconducting parallel analyses in three large nationally representative data sets. Despite\nthe various methods used to collect fertility data across the data sets and the small\nnumber of births on which some of the early estimates are based, descriptive estimates\nof men's ages at first birth by race appear relatively consistent. Our descriptive results\n18 Results are available from the authors on request.\nHynes et al.: The transition to early fatherhood\n368 http://www.demographic-research.org\nindicate that having a first birth as a teenager is far more common for women than for\nmen. There are clear race differences in early male fertility, with minority men\nexperiencing much higher rates of early first births than white men. Even in minority\ngroups, however, only a small proportion of men experience their first birth during the\nhigh school years. The NSFG data shows slightly lower rates of early fertility for men,\nand further research should examine whether this is due to cohort differences, the\ncomposition of the NSFG sample, or retrospective data collection. The gap between\nearly male fertility and early female fertility is approximately three years and is\nconsistent within race/ethnic groups. The findings from all three data sets are consistent\nwith prior research.\nMultivariate results yielded both substantive findings and differences across data\nsets. Substantively, as prior studies have shown and theory predicts, men from\ndisadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to experience early first births than men\nfrom more advantaged backgrounds. Models testing for age differences show that\nmany associations between family background and fertility are weaker at older ages\nthan during the teenage years, but some indicators, particularly maternal education,\nhave not disappeared by ages 23\u00ad24 for women or men. Births at these ages may still\ncarry opportunity costs for both women and men seeking to establish careers or invest\nin graduate education. Given the age difference between partners, it is unclear whether\nthese births have opportunity costs for men or whether these men are likely to partner\nwith younger women for whom having a birth at 20\u00ad22 has significant costs.\nThe association between family background characteristics and early fertility is\nless consistent and weaker for minority men than for white men, similar to findings of\nRindfuss, Morgan, and Swicegood (1988). It is unclear whether this is due to smaller\nsample sizes for minority men or whether these family background characteristics are\nnot as good proxies for the opportunities available to minority men as they are for white\nmen. Future analyses with the NLSY surveys will address this limitation by including a\nricher set of variables, such as local labor market conditions and social policy contexts\nin order to examine this question further.\nWe did not find consistent evidence of significant differences between women and\nmen in the associations between family background characteristics and early first births.\nThere are some sporadic sex differences potentially indicating that family background\ncharacteristics may be more strongly associated with teenage fertility for women than\nmen, particularly African-American women, but this conclusion is tentative. Using\ninteraction terms to test for significant sex differences (particularly within samples\nsubdivided by race and age) is a conservative test of these associations, thus only large\ndifferences are likely to appear consistently across data sets. A less stringent test, larger\nsample sizes, or more detailed background variables might yield more evidence of sex\ndifferences. On the other hand, the combination of assortative mating and the need for\nDemographic Research: Volume 18, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 369\nboth the woman and the man to at least be somewhat complicit in the decision to have a\nbaby may lead to few sex differences in the factors associated with early fertility.\nSimilarly, in analyses within the NSFG, we did not find strong evidence that there\nare cohort differences in the factors associated with early male fertility. While there\nhave been substantial increases in educational attainment, reductions in two parent\nfamilies, and increases in maternal employment over the cohorts covered in this study,\nour Vital Statistics estimates show that teen fertility has had periods of both increases\nand declines. Clearly factors besides these broad social changes are influencing teen\nfertility rates, making our findings plausible. On the other hand, the NSFG has a small\nsample size once it is broken into cohorts. The inability to further subdivide the sample\nby race makes us very cautious about this finding. Further research is necessary to\nexamine cohort differences in the factors associated with early fertility.\nIn terms of cross-data set comparisons, our results indicate that scholars and policy\nmakers should be cautious about drawing strong conclusions about the association of\nparticular factors with men's early childbearing based on results from a single data set,\nespecially when analyses are conducted separately by race/ethnicity. Overall the general\npatterns we find across data sets are reassuring, with many variables exhibiting\nconsistent results in two or even three of the data sets. Especially in analyses that are\nnot broken down by race/ethnicity, our results are largely consistent across data sets. In\naddition, it is rare in our analyses to find variables for which coefficients in one data set\npoint to positive associations and coefficients in another data set point to negative\nassociations.\nHowever, there are many instances where variables are significant in one data set\nbut not in another when analyses are conducted separately by race/ethnicity. These\ndiscrepancies are sometimes due to variation in standard errors, but at other times the\ncoefficients are quite different. For instance, using only the NLSY79 we would\nconclude that family structure in adolescence is not associated with teen births for\nAfrican-American men. However, both the NSFG and the NLSY97 show associations\nbetween family structure and teen births for these men. In contrast, for whites, the\nNLSY79 and the NSFG indicate that growing up in a single parent family is associated\nwith teen pregnancy, but the NLSY97 shows no association. This is similar to some of\nthe inconsistent findings from other studies of male fertility noted in the literature\nreview (e.g. the association between family structure and early fertility in Jaffee et al.\ndata sets also yield very different conclusions about the strength of sex differences in\nthese background characteristics.\nBy coding all variables the same way and running the same models, we have\neliminated the possibility that coding and modeling differences cause the variation in\nresults. However, it is unclear whether observed differences between data sets are due\nHynes et al.: The transition to early fatherhood\n370 http://www.demographic-research.org\nto differences in sample composition, data quality, or cohort differences. In future work\nwe plan to pool these three data sets in order to explicitly examine whether differences\nbetween data sets are due to changes over time in the prevalence of certain family\nbackground characteristics and their associations with early fertility. We are also\nexpanding our data quality work to examine differences in the quality of the male\nfertility data between these data sets for particular race/ethnic groups and for marital\nversus non-marital births. Once we have completed these two additional projects we\nwill have a stronger sense of whether results from one data set are more reliable than\nresults from other data sets. The important conclusion to be drawn from our results is\nthat replication is important in this area, particularly given the importance of analyses\nrelated to family structure and fertility in current policy debates.\nIn sum, this study contributes to our understanding of early male fertility by\nproviding national estimates of men's first birth behavior from three large, nationally\nrepresentative surveys and examining whether there are differences by age, sex, race,\ncohort, and data source in the factors associated with early fertility. This research\nprovides a foundation for further analyses of early male fertility that examine important\nfactors such as the relationship context of early births, the neighborhood and social\npolicy factors influencing men's fertility, and the impacts of early male fertility on labor\nmarket outcomes and child well-being.\n9.
