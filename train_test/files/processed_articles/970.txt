Adair\n Key words: hypertension, nutrition transition, develop-\ning country, overweight trends\nIntroduction\nWorldwide trends of increasing obesity in adults are well\nrecognized (1) and have recently become a focus of the\nWorld Health Organization, as reflected in a recent Expert\nTechnical Consultation (2). Increases in mean BMI and\nprevalence of overweight are of special concern in Asia\nbecause comorbidities tend to occur at lower BMI in Asians\n(3,4). Dramatic trends of increasing obesity are contributing\nto higher prevalence of noncommunicable disease morbid-\nity and mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease\nand type 2 diabetes. It has been estimated that 30 million\npeople in the Asia-Pacific region suffer from type 2 diabetes\n(5). In the Philippines, 1996 data show that diseases of the\ncirculatory system accounted for 30% of all deaths (6). A\nrecent national nutrition survey revealed that 21% of all\nadults and 44.3% of adults over the age of 60 were hyper-\ntensive (7). Given the importance of overweight as a risk\nfactor for these diseases, further research is needed to iden-\ntify the factors responsible for the rapid and dramatic trends\nin obesity prevalence in the Philippines and in other coun-\ntries undergoing rapid development.\nMost data on overweight and obesity trends in developing\ncountries come from cross-sectional national surveys. There\nis little information on weight trends derived from longitu-\ndinal studies within populations, nor are there adequate data\non how trends relate to chronic disease.\nThis study examined a cohort of Filipino women who\nwere participants in an ongoing longitudinal health and\nnutrition study in Metro Cebu.

This study is being con-\nducted in Metro Cebu, which encompasses the large city of\nCebu, proximate smaller cities and surrounding rural moun-\ntainous areas, and several smaller island communities.\nMetro Cebu has a population of nearly 2 million and is the\nfastest growing metropolitan area of the Philippines. In\nurban and rural communities of Metro Cebu were identified\nthrough a census and asked to participate in the study. Those\nwho gave birth during a 1-year time period from 1983 to\nthe general population of women of childbearing age in\nMetro Cebu, sample women had higher fertility.\nWomen were interviewed and measured once during\npregnancy, within 6 days after giving birth, bimonthly for 2\ngravida. The analysis sample for each time interval includes\nwomen who were not pregnant when measured and, thus,\nvaries across the intervals. Loss to follow-up was more\nlikely among urban women and women with lower educa-\ntion and parity at baseline. However, women lost to fol-\nlow-up did not differ from those in the analysis sample in\nbaseline weight, height, or age.\nData were collected by highly trained local field staff\nduring in-home interviews. Height was measured to the\nnearest 0.1 cm using portable stadiometers; weight was\nmeasured to the nearest 0.1 kg using portable scales; triceps\nskinfold thickness was measured to the nearest 1 mm using\nHarpenden calipers; and waist, hip, and midarm circumfer-\nences were measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using standard\nmeasuring tapes. Diet was assessed by 24-hour recall as-\nsurveys and by quantitative food frequency questionnaire in\nthe 1991 survey. Energy and nutrient intakes were estimated\nusing Filipino food composition tables produced by the\nFood and Nutrition Research Institute. Individual, house-\nhold, and community environment, socioeconomic, and demo-\ngraphic data were collected using detailed questionnaires.\nBlood pressure (BP)1 was measured while participants\nwere seated and rested. The mean of three measurements,\ntaken using mercury sphygmomanometers, was used in the\nanalysis. BP was classified according to the most recent\nguidelines, defining prehypertension (systolic BP 120 to\nFor the main analysis, weight status was defined using BMI\noverweight, and obesity, respectively, as recommended by the\nWorld Health Organization and the International Obesity Task\nForce. High waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was defined as a value\nof 0.85 or greater. At the baseline survey, 4% of respondents\nwere 18 years of age, so adult cut-off points have the poten-\ntial to misclassify them. However, none of the younger respon-\ndents was overweight or obese. Unfortunately, there are no\nBMI cut-off points for adolescents that represent the equivalent\nof 18.5 for adults. Thus, we may have misclassified as\nunderweight a small percentage of participants who were still\nteens when they first joined the study. Sensitivity analysis\nshows that removal of the teen sample (those 18 years of\nage) from the sample does not substantively change the results,\nso they are retained to maximize the sample size. Weight\nchange was calculated for each measurement interval (1984 to\ninitial weight was represented by the 4-month postpartum\nmeasure for all women. For subsequent intervals, it was not\npossible to measure all women at the same point postpartum\nbecause reproductive patterns were quite heterogeneous after\nthe index pregnancy. Time allocation, which may serve as a\nproxy for physical activity of the women, was assessed by\nquestionnaires that asked about usual activities over the course\nof a day. Time spent in domestic work, leisure, and work for\npay was cumulated. Directly comparable time allocation data\nanalysis focused on weight change in this period.\nFrom detailed reproductive histories, summary variables\nwere created to represent the number of pregnancies and\nmonths of lactation in each interval. In addition, indicator\nvariables were used to represent lactation status when a\nwoman was weighed. Socioeconomic status (SES) was rep-\nresented by a summary index taking values of 1 to 8,\nreflecting household income, possession of key assets (tele-\nvision, electric fan, refrigerator), and type of house con-\nstruction materials (light, medium, strong). Detailed occu-\npation data were collected, and occupations were assigned a\nthree-digit code developed by the Philippines Department of\nLabor. Occupations were then crudely categorized accord-\ning to physical work demands as primarily sedentary (pre-\ndominantly carried out sitting) or more active.\nAnalysis\nFirst, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the\nsample through time is described, and univariate statistics\nfor groups defined by weight status are presented. To com-\npare age vs. secular trends in weight, the data from all time\n1 Nonstandard abbreviations: BP, blood pressure; WHR, waist-to-hip ratio; SES, socioeco-\nnomic status.\nOverweight in Filipino Women, Adair\nperiods were pooled into a longitudinal model, the effects of\nage were examined while controlling for year of measure-\nment, and the interaction of age with year of measurement\nwas tested. Multiple linear regression was used to identify\nfactors significantly associated with change in weight dur-\ning each measurement interval. Finally, the odds of the three\ndifferent levels of hypertension (prehypertension and stages\n1 and 2 hypertension) associated with weight status and WHR\nwere estimated using multinomial logistic regression, adjusting\nfor age, and predicted probability of hypertension at specified\nlevels of BMI and WHR was calculated. Diet, socioeconomic\nstatus, place of residence, and proxy variables for physical\nactivity were assessed, but because they were not confounders\nof the relationship of weight status and WHR to hypertension,\nthey were not included in final hypertension models. Predicted\nprobability of each hypertension outcome was calculated for\ncombinations of weight status and high WHR.\nResults\nTable 1 shows characteristics of women by weight cate-\ngory in 1999. Prevalence of overweight and obesity were\nhigher among women with more education and higher so-\ncioeconomic status, as evidenced by the overall index and\nby possession of specific assets that indicate more wealth\nand modernization. Underweight women were character-\nized by less work away from home and higher domestic\nwork burdens. Overweight and obese working women were\nmore likely to have sedentary occupations.\nAge and Time Trends\nFigure 1 shows trends in prevalence of underweight,\noverweight, and obesity over the 16-year study period.\nin 1999. In contrast, overweight prevalence increased\n5-fold, and although obesity was nearly absent in 1984 to\nthe mean weight change over the 16-year period was 6.8 \n7.1 kg, there was considerable heterogeneity in weight\nchange patterns. Approximately seventy-two percent of\nwomen gained 2 kg, 18% maintained weight within 2 kg,\nand nearly 10% lost 2 kg. Weight change was accompa-\nnied by changes in triceps skinfold thickness (mean increase\nof 5.6  4.5 mm), with each kilogram of weight gain being\nassociated with a 1-mm increase in triceps skinfold.\nYounger women gained significantly more weight than\nolder women: for example, as shown in Figure 2, women\nTable 1.

In addition to differences associated\nwith aging, there is also evidence of a secular trend.

Because this is a mixed age cohort, time trends in\nweight status of women of the same age cannot be com-\npared across the full age distribution. However, it is possible\nto compare women in the middle of the age distribution.\nThe study period was marked by substantial changes in\nsocioeconomic status of Cebu households.

Results are summarized in Table 2. Across all of\nthe time periods, maternal age was inversely associated with\nweight change. The total number of pregnancies and months\nversely associated with weight change in that time interval.\nA higher proportion of mothers had young infants in this\ninterval compared with subsequent intervals. In subsequent\nintervals, breast-feeding at the time of measurement at the\nend (but not at the beginning) of the interval was inversely\nassociated with weight change. Number of pregnancies and\ntotal time breast-feeding during the interval were not sig-\nnificantly associated with weight change after 1991.\nIncreased dietary energy intake was positively associated\nments in economic status were consistently associated with\ngreater weight increases, as was urban residence. The effects of\nchange in SES were not dependent on the starting level of SES.\nThe main aspect of time allocation related to weight change\nwas work away from home, which was associated with higher\npresented in Table 1, which show higher mean away-from-\nhome work hours in overweight women.\nRisk Factors for Hypertension\nOne health consequence of these weight trends was eval-\nuated by examining the likelihood of hypertension (based\non 1999 data) associated with overweight, obesity, and high\nWHR. Results from logistic regression models with BMI \n25 as the reference category are presented in Table 3.\nLooking across the levels of hypertension, the risks associ-\nated with excess body weight are readily apparent, with\nobesity increasing the risk of stages 1 and 2 hypertension by\n6 fold. The risk associated with a high WHR increased\nacross categories, from a nonsignificant 16% increase in\nrisk of prehypertension to a 2.5-fold increase in risk of stage\n2 hypertension. Figure 5 shows the age-adjusted predicted\nprevalence of hypertension for each weight and WHR cat-\negory. The highest predicted prevalence of stages 1 and 2\nhypertension is found in association with the combination of\nobesity and high WHR. Risk of hypertension was not sig-\nnificantly related to triceps skinfold thickness, after control-\nling for weight status (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nThis study documented a dramatic trend of increasing over-\nweight and obesity in a cohort of adult Filipino women over a\n16-year period. The rise in overweight and obesity paralleled\nrapid economic change evidenced by increasing household\nincomes and ownership of consumer goods and a shift toward\nhigher fat diets, more sedentary jobs, and reduced domestic\nwork burdens. The incidence and prevalence of overweight\nand obesity was highest among women in higher socioeco-\nTable 2.

This is consistent with findings from other\ndeveloping countries that are relatively early in the nutrition\ntransition (9,10). Overweight and obesity are also increasing\namong women in poorer households, although levels have not\nreached those of women in more affluent households. An\nincrease in overweight among the poor is also occurring in\ncountries such as Brazil (11). In comparison with the rest of the\nPhilippines, rates of overweight and obesity are higher in the\nyounger women of the Cebu sample but comparable in older\nwomen. National survey data show that 16.7% of women 20 to\nCebu) of women 40 to 59 years old are overweight, whereas\nrespective age groups are obese (7). The Cebu sample cannot\nbe considered representative of all women because we origi-\nnally selected pregnant women for inclusion in the study.\nComparative data for other developing countries are sparse.\nBell et al. (12) have reported a doubling of overweight (from\nto 1.5%) in an 8-year period in adult Chinese women who were\n20 to 45 years of age at first observation. Another study of\nChinese women, 40 to 70 years old, has based estimates of\nweight gain on recalled weight at age 20 (13). In the group\nroughly comparable in age with our Cebu sample, mean\nin 16 years among Cebu women).\nAn important strength of this study is that it was based on\nprospective data collection and, therefore, could separate\nsecular and age trends and identify potential causal relation-\nships. Age and year were both significant predictors of\nweight, affirming that women are getting heavier with age\nand heavier over time, irrespective of age. However, the\neffects of the secular trend were greater in younger women,\nand in each measurement interval, younger women gained\nmore weight than older women.\nReproductive Stresses\nThis is a high fertility population, with a mean of 5.5\npregnancies in the sample women. Weight gain is related to the\ninterval characterized by the highest total reproductive stress,\ngiven the age of the women), those with more pregnancies and\nlonger periods of lactation had lower weight gains. In later\nperiods, women who were lactating at the end of the interval\nwhen weight was measured had lower weight gains, but once\ncurrent lactation status was taken into account, there were no\nadditional effects of pregnancies or lactation during the inter-\nval. Ideally, we would like to have more precisely quantified\nlactation stress by separating the effects of full vs. partial\nbreast-feeding, but this was not possible with the available\ndata. Prior work on this sample has shown that prolonged\nlactation in the absence of adequate dietary intake contributes\nto depletion of maternal energy reserves, especially in poor\nTable 3.

Thus, at one end of the spectrum, in the\npoorest, oldest, and highest fertility segment of the population,\nhigh reproductive demands continue to result in lower weight\ngain. With modernization, improved economic status, and\nhigher education levels, birth spacing increases, and total fer-\ntility and lactation duration are reduced. For example, among\nsample women who one might assume have completed child-\nbearing (e.g., those 45 years of age or older in 1999), mean\nnumber of pregnancies is lower in the 45- to 50-year-old group\nthan in those who are 50 years or older. Reduced reproductive\nstress is associated with higher weight gains and overweight. In\nBrazil, Coitinho et al. (15) have found only small effects of\nparity and lactation on long-term weight gain of Brazilian\nwomen, with effects being stronger in women who were ini-\ntially obese.\nChanges in Economic Status and Employment\nAt the baseline survey, there were no significant differ-\nences in SES by age category. However, by 1999, women\nwho were 25 to 35 at baseline had larger improvements in\nSES compared with both older and younger age groups.\nThese economic gains are also consistent with this age\ngroup having the highest mean level of education. Improve-\nments in household income and acquisition of assets have\nbroad effects on diet and activity patterns. For example, as\nwomen get older, they acquire skills and material resources\nthat allow them to establish their own small businesses.\nAbout one in seven women in the sample had their own\nsmall \"sari-sari\" stores or eateries. Work in these small\nneighborhood convenience stores is sedentary much of the\ntime, and access to snack foods is high. Furthermore, our\nrevealed that increased away-from-home work hours were\nassociated with higher weight gains. The time trend in the\nPhilippines, as in other developing countries, is toward\nmore sedentary work. Earnings tend to increase with more\nwork hours, and higher income is associated with changes in\ndiet. As expected, increasing energy intake contributes to\nhigher weight gain. Unfortunately, the time period of great-\nwhich detailed time allocation data were collected, so we\ncannot repeat this analysis in another time interval.\nEffects on Health Status\nThe health consequences of increasing weight are well il-\nlustrated by the strong association of obesity and, in particular,\nabdominal obesity, with risk of hypertension. Results for Cebu\nwomen are consistent with the trend observed across develop-\ning as well as developed countries, where increasing adiposity\nis strongly associated with BP (16). These results and national\nevidence of a rapidly worsening chronic disease profile in the\nPhilippines call for a new emphasis on obesity and chronic\ndisease prevention. In particular, public health programs\nshould include risk assessment based on anthropometry and\nmore extensive BP screening. Obesity prevention is particu-\nlarly challenging in a developing country context where prob-\nlems of nutritional inadequacies remain, creating a dual burden\nof over- and undernutrition.\n"
