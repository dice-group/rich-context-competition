    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe study has been conducted to investigate the impact of time pressure and challenge appraisal on job satisfaction experienced\nby Pakistani university teachers in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi. It is the first study which has investigated the\nrelationships between time pressure, challenge appraisal, and job satisfaction in the backdrop of a poly-chronic society\nand compared the findings with those of a study carried out in a mono-chronic society. Data were collected through a\nsurvey by administering questionnaires to the respondents. The findings reveal that Pakistani respondents experience a\nlesser level of time pressure when compared with the German respondents. Also, there has been lesser variability in time\npressure of Pakistani respondents in comparison with the German respondents. The study also finds that, like their German\ncounterparts, Pakistani university teachers consider time pressure as a challenge-related stress. The correlation between\ntime pressure and challenge shows a lower degree of relationship in case of Pakistani respondents compared with a moderate\ndegree for German respondents.\n",

It has been variously defined as a delightful\nsensation experienced by the worker due to the nature of the\njob (Locke, 1976), an emotional feeling derived from work\n(Cranny, Smith, & Stone, 1992), and a person's outlook\naccepting the argument that job satisfaction is a mental\napproach, concluded that this is determined by one's percep-\ntions, experiences, and faith. Researchers have investigated\njob satisfaction through a large number of predictors.\nTime pressure and challenge appraisal have been identi-\nfied as important determinants of job satisfaction. Time pres-\nsure is the demand on the worker to work faster than usual to\ncomplete the given tasks (Baer & Oldham, 2006; Kinicki &\nchallenge appraisal as a momentary judgment of a situation,\nwhich is more like a state of mind. Challenge appraisal\nprompts an individual to initiate efforts to effectively address\na given situation (Skinner & Brewer, 2002).\nTime pressure and challenge appraisal have a strong rela-\ntionship with a society's work ethic and social concept of\ntime. Most of the studies on the relationship between time\npressure, challenge appraisal, and job satisfaction have been\ncarried out in societies which follow the Protestant work\nethic and mono-chronic concept of time. United States,\nGermany, England, France, and Scandinavian countries are\nmono-chronic societies. Third world countries, including\nPakistan, represent poly-chronic cultures.\nThe term \"Protestant work ethic\" has been coined by\nWeber (1930). He explains it in a single phrase: \"Time is\nmoney.\" A mono-chronic society represents the Protestant\nwork ethic by laying stress on punctuality, sanctity of sched-\nules, and focus on a single activity at a time (Griffin, 2000).\nHowever, a poly-chronic society allows for engaging in mul-\ntiple activities simultaneously and maintaining a relaxed atti-\ntude toward work schedules (Hall & Hall, 1990).\nOhly and Fritz (2010), in their study on the behavior of\nemployees in a German automotive plant, reported that work\ncharacteristics such as time pressure and job control can be\nexperienced as a challenge that is positively associated with\nperformance-related behaviors. Their findings represent the\ndynamics of work characteristics in a highly mono-chronic\nsociety.\n1Army Public College of Management & Sciences, Rawalpindi, Pakistan\nCorresponding Author:\nSaleem Akhtar Malik, Army Public College of Management & Sciences\n(APCOMS), Ordnance Road, Rawalpindi Cantonment, Rawalpindi 46000,\nPakistan.\nEmail: saleemakhtar53@yahoo.co.uk\nTime Pressure and Challenge Appraisal as\nPredictors of Job Satisfaction: Empirical\nEvidence From Pakistani Universities\nSaleem Akhtar Malik1\n Keywords\nmono-chronic time, poly-chronic time, time pressure, challenge appraisal, job satisfaction\n2 SAGE Open\nMujtaba, Cavico, McCartney, and DiPaolo (2011) consid-\nered moral development as a continuous process to enhance\nan individual's ability to differentiate between right and\nwrong. The work ethic of poly-chronic societies has been\ndeveloped over a period of centuries. Thus, they consider\nshirking and violating time schedules as perfectly normal.\nThis is the reason Transparency International-Pakistan\n(2010) rated Pakistan very low in the enforcement and prac-\ntices of ethical standards.\nThe current study attempts at analyzing the interaction of\ntime pressure and challenge appraisal with job satisfaction\nunder a poly-chronic overhang by investigating the behavior\nof Pakistani university teachers. The aim is to probe how\nwork characteristics affect employee job satisfaction in a\npoly-chronic society. The key questions of the current study\nare to investigate how teachers in Pakistani universities\nrespond to time pressure, and, does it result in feelings of\nchallenge which lead to job satisfaction? The purpose of this\nstudy was to see if the findings of the earlier studies hold\ngood in the third world societies, which follow a diametri-\ncally opposite work ethic and social concept of time.\nLiterature Review\nTime Pressure and Job Satisfaction\nRobinson and Godbey (1996) had found that whereas in the\n20th Century Americans had more free time, their time man-\nagement and the resultant emotional stability had become\nmore difficult. The researchers concluded that eventually\npeople learn to adjust themselves to the demanding pace of\nlife.\nThe influence of time pressure on worker performance\nhas shown paradoxical results. Many researchers have\nreported that job satisfaction is negatively predicted by time\npressure. However, quite a number of studies have shown\nthat time pressure exerts positive influence on job satisfac-\ntion. Decker and Borgen (1993) considered time pressure as\na stressor which negatively affects job satisfaction.\nLinzer et al. (2000) have focused on finding how time\npressure affects quality of physician care. They have found\nthat time pressure results in job dissatisfaction. Their results\nalso show that in non-operational issues, such as patient\u00ad\nphysician relationship, job satisfaction is not affected by\ntime pressure. However, time pressure affects job satisfac-\ntion in operational issues such as patient care. Slobounov,\nFukada, Simon, Rearick, and Ray (2000), while studying if\nthe demand on the employees to work faster than usual to\ncomplete the assigned tasks influences their behavior, con-\nfirmed that time pressure, besides reducing the time to per-\nform a task, results in increased behavioral errors that lead to\njob dissatisfaction.\nWorkers having less time pressure are more satisfied\n(Dhondt, Kraan, & Sloten, 2002). In their report on technology\nand work organization in the European Union, Dhondt et al.\nhave mentioned that whereas time pressure on workers in\nEuropean Union countries continues to rise, job control has\nstabilized at the level of 1996. This implies that whereas the\ndemand on the employee to work faster than usual to complete\nthe given tasks has been increasing, there is no commensurate\nincrease in the level of freedom allowed him or her to choose\nthe way to carry out these tasks. This is the reason why the\nworking conditions in the European Union have become more\nstressful, resulting in high health risks for the workers.\nAccording to Dhondt et al., managers are designing the jobs in\na manner that requires workers to put in a greater amount of\nwork. They suggest using technology to reduce time pressure\non workers.\nNordqvist, Hovmark, and Zika-Viktorsson (2004) have\nstudied the relationships between perceived time pressure,\nestimated goal achievements, team processes (team support,\ncooperation, and collective ability), and job satisfaction. The\nresearchers have found that time pressure casts a negative\ninfluence on job satisfaction. They have concluded that neg-\nativity of time pressure is neutralized through moderation by\nteam support for the collective goal. Donno and Demaree\n(2008) have also reported that time pressure negatively\naffects job satisfaction.\nWhereas time pressure has been negatively associated\nwith job satisfaction, Podsakoff, Lepine, and Lepine (2007)\nhave reported a positive relationship between the two. Maule,\nHockey, Clough, and Bdzola (2000) have carried out a study\ninvolving an experiment based on risk scenarios offering a\nchoice between safe and risky actions. According to the find-\nings, time-pressured respondents showed more keenness and\nenergy and applied a number of different strategies to meet\nthe deadline. These outcomes and the applied strategies var-\nied systematically with task structure, particularly the effort\nmanipulation. Fay and Sonnentag (2002) maintained that\ntime pressure may be a facilitator to address job demands.\nThis is further elaborated by Ohly, Sonnentag, and Pluntke\n(2006), according to whom time pressure acts as a trigger to\nbreak the workplace inertia and accelerates performance.\nTime Pressure, Challenge, and Job Satisfaction\nWhy does time pressure cast paradoxical influences on job\nsatisfaction? Carnegie (1948) opined that time pressure\nresults in negative stress on people who are bored with their\nwork. This stress manifests itself in fatigue, both mental and\nphysical. However, an interesting activity leads to positive\nstress, which keeps people riveted to the activity for hours\nwithout feeling fatigued. Carnegie further explains that one's\nemotional attitude has a greater impact on producing fatigue\nthan physical stress. When people are immensely interested\nin a job or undertaking, it ceases to be a fatigue and becomes\na pleasure to undertake. In such a situation, the work is not a\nburden but feels like effortless movement. Carnegie's thesis\nhas been empirically confirmed by Lepine, Podsakoff, and\nLepine (2005) who reported that hindrance stressors directly\nand negatively influence employee productivity and job sat-\nisfaction. Lepine et al. suggested that worker performance\ncan be enhanced, and job satisfaction increased, by distin-\nguishing between challenge and hindrance.\nOhly and Fritz (2010) have found that time pressure, in\nconjunction with job control, creates challenge appraisal,\nwhich results in proactive behavior. Hall and Lawler (1970)\nreported that job satisfaction results from the pressure exerted\non the employee due to the challenging nature of a task.\nPositive tension created by the challenging and difficult tasks\nresults in a greater degree of job satisfaction than easier and\nJob satisfaction has also been related to personality traits\npropounded by Judge, Heller, and Mount (2002).\nOhly and Fritz (2010) presented a conceptual framework\nwhich integrates time pressure, job control, and challenge\nappraisal to predict creativity and proactive behavior. These\nresearchers mention two categories of performance-related\nbehaviors: chronic and daily. Chronic behaviors are the one\ntime measurements recorded at random. Daily behaviors are\nthe averaged ratings of two or more measurements recorded\nduring the day. Fritz and Sonnentag (2009) cited three reasons\nfor factoring daily-performance-related behaviors while mea-\nsuring performance levels: (a) to help zero-in on the exact\nsituations which trigger these daily behaviors, (b) to facilitate\nin finding out if the factors influencing such behavior are the\nsame or different in case of chronic behaviors, and (3) to\nallow for measurements that are closer to the actual experi-\nence and behavior. Ohly and Fritz maintain that there is a lack\nof understanding about the processes which transform chronic\nwork characteristics into daily experiences and affect day-to-\nday performance. Butler, Grzywacz, Bass, and Linney (2005)\nreported that work characteristics (time pressure and job con-\ntrol) are not entirely stable. For example, challenge is a\nmomentary appraisal of a given situation and can be better\ncaptured on a daily basis. Hence, Ohly and Fritz measure both\nchronic and daily work characteristics. They theorize that\nchronic time pressure and chronic job control result in daily\ntime pressure and daily job control, respectively. These, in\nturn, lead to challenge appraisal, finally predicting proactive\nbehavior. Ohly and Fritz consider time pressure as a catalyst\nfor creating a perception of challenge, which prompts the\nworker to strive for goal accomplishment.\nHow do work characteristics result in the perception of a\nchallenge? A demanding situation creates a challenge that\ncan be utilized for accomplishment of individual objectives\nresearchers relate challenge appraisal with positive response.\nTheir research findings indicate that there exists a positive\nrelationship between challenge and job satisfaction. While\ninvestigating the dynamics of stress leading toward positive\noutcomes and the variables that act as moderators between\nstress and such positive outcomes, Bosewell, Buchanan, and\nLePine (2004) have found that challenge appraisal moder-\nates the relationship between job control, time pressure, and\njob satisfaction. They also maintain that, whereas hindrance-\nrelated stress predicts negative outcomes and lower job satis-\nfaction, challenge-related stress leads to positive outcomes\nand increased job satisfaction. Bosewell et al. confirm Ohly\nand Fritz's (2010) finding that time pressure acts as a catalyst\nfor creating a perception of challenge, which prompts the\nworker to strive for goal accomplishment. They further build\nup this argument by maintaining that stress may positively\ninfluence individual, group, or organizational behavior.\nLepine et al. (2005) have conducted a meta-analytic test\nof a two-dimensional work stressor framework involving the\nrelationship between stressors with strains, motivation, and\nperformance. They have found that hindrance stressors\ndirectly and negatively influence employee productivity and\njob satisfaction. However, challenge-related stressors have a\npositive effect on job satisfaction, performance, and neutral-\nizing indirect effects on performance. These researchers\nhave suggested that worker performance can be enhanced,\nand job satisfaction increased, by distinguishing between\nchallenge and hindrance.\nPodsakoff et al. (2007) have investigated the inadequacies\nin previous research pertaining to employee behavior under\npressure due to the limitations of time and nature of work.\nTheir results reveal that challenge casts a positive influence\non job satisfaction. A challenging situation acts as a catalyst\nfor worker effort and higher performance leading to job sat-\nisfaction (Tomaka, Blascovich, Kelsey, & Leitten, 1993;\nStudy 2). In their study, Tomaka et al. have discussed the use\nof physiological measures as predictors of stress. Their\nresults indicate that the perceived threat from a given situa-\ntion creates a task stress. This task stress generates the feel-\nings of challenge which leads to job satisfaction.\nThere exists a linkage between personal and professional\nsatisfaction and challenge resulting from multiple roles\na positive relationship between challenge and job satisfac-\ntion across occupational groups.\nTheoretical Framework and Development of\nHypotheses\nThe theoretical framework of this study partially incorpo-\nrates Ohly and Fritz's (2010) conceptual framework (Figure\n1), which establishes linkage between time pressure, chal-\nlenge appraisal, job control, proactive behavior, and job sat-\nisfaction, and findings from studies reporting a direct\nrelationship between challenge and job satisfaction (Hall &\n2002). As the study is oriented toward finding if time pres-\nsure experienced by Pakistani university teachers results in\nchallenge appraisal and job satisfaction, and as the researcher\ndid not intend to investigate the processes which transform\nchronic time pressure into daily time pressure, the theoretical\nframework (Figure 2) has been kept simple and focuses only\non the relationship between chronic time pressure, challenge\n4 SAGE Open\nappraisal, and job satisfaction. A relationship between time\npressure and challenge appraisal is to be inferred to find if\ntime pressure creates a challenge-related stress in the\nPakistani university teachers.\nHypothesis 1 (H1): Chronic time pressure is significantly\nand positively related to challenge appraisal.\nFeeling of a challenge experienced by a time-pressured\nperson may not necessarily lead to job satisfaction. Being a\nmomentary appraisal of a situation, challenge may be a fleet-\ning sensation which may diffuse soon and the individual may\nrevert to his default emotional state. The level of challenge\nappraisal experienced by university teachers should remain\nstable enough to lead to job satisfaction.\nHypothesis 2 (H2): There is a significant and positive\nrelationship between challenge appraisal and job\nsatisfaction.\nTo validate, in the context of a poly-chronic society, the\nearlier findings that there is a direct relationship between\nchronic time pressure and job satisfaction, the third hypoth-\nesis has been formulated.\nHypothesis 3 (H3): There is a significant relationship\nbetween chronic time pressure and job satisfaction.\nMethod\nProcedure\nThe demographic data and information on employee percep-\ntions of time pressure, challenge appraisal, and job satisfac-\ntion were collected through a survey method by administering\nquestionnaires to the respondents.All the questionnaires were\nmanually administered. The researcher personally visited the\nselected universities and briefed the faculty members about\nthe significance of research and the need for developing a\nholistic model explaining the relationships between time\npressure, challenge appraisal, and job satisfaction. It was\nhighlighted that the research will have profound implications\non improving the quality of teaching in the Pakistani universi-\nties. The researcher wanted to use the probability sampling\nmethod because of its greater degree of accuracy. However,\nthere was a considerable reluctance by the respective univer-\nsity registrars to share the data regarding faculty members.\nGenerally, the faculty lists were not up to date. Even when the\nincomplete faculty lists were provided, many faculty mem-\nbers were not available because of various commitments.\nThis made it nearly impossible to follow the probability sam-\npling method. Hence, reference-chain sampling method was\nresorted to where, through networking, a chain of question-\nnaire administrators and respondents was created. Due to the\nabove-cited reasons, data collection took more than 4 months.\nFigure 2. Theoretical framework.\nFigure 1. Ohly and Fritz's (2010) conceptual framework.\nParticipants\nPopulation of the study comprised faculty members of the\nuniversities in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.\nHigher Education Commission of Pakistan (HEC; n.d.)\nrecognizes 22 universities in the Rawalpindi\u00adIslamabad\nregion, 17 in the public sector, and 4 in the private sector.\nThese universities have a population of approximately\n10,000 faculty members. The population keeps fluctuating,\nmainly on account of visiting faculty. The sample con-\nsisted of 282 university professors. Both public sector and\nprivate sector universities were included. In all, 400 ques-\ntionnaires were distributed. One hundred seventy-nine\nquestionnaires were not responded to and 39 were rejected,\nbeing incomplete.\nPakistani university teachers, even as their counterparts\nin mono-chronic societies, are routinely pressured for time.\nHowever, teaching profession requires creativity and offers\nchallenges. A significant proportion of these teachers get\nopportunities to study in foreign universities where they get\nexposure to protestant work ethics. Over time, their person-\nalities acquire different shades of an amalgam of mono-\nchronic and poly-chronic values. On account of these\ncharacteristics, these people constitute a very good speci-\nmen for studying the relationships between work character-\nistics and job satisfaction in the context of a poly-chronic\nsociety which is undergoing a slow, albeit significant social\ntransformation.\nMeasures\nTime pressure has been measured using Instrument for\nstress-related job analysis (ISTA; Semmer, Zapf, & Dunckel,\n1998). The instrument comprises three items related to high\nquantitative workload. A sample item is \"How often must\nyou finish work later because of having too much to do?\"\nISTA instrument taps time pressure on a 5-point Likert-type\nscale. To ensure uniformity of measurement with other\ninstruments, the Likert-type scale has been modified by rais-\ning it to 7 points (1 = very rarely/never to 7 = very often).\nChallenge appraisal has been measured using four items\nbased on Bosewell et al. (2004): The items capture the degree\nto which individuals consider their work is demanding but\nnot overtaxing their abilities, and bringing them closer to\ntheir personal goals. Specimen item is \"my work today\nbrings me closer to the accomplishment of personal goals.\"\nChallenge appraisal has been measured on a 7-point Likert-\ntype scale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree).\nJob satisfaction has been measured using the 15-item\nmeasure in the Job Diagnostic Survey developed by Hackman\nand Oldham (1974). The instrument has been modified by\nreducing the number of items to 12. An example item is\n\"Generally speaking, I am very satisfied with this job.\" Job\nsatisfaction has also been measured on a 7-point Likert-type\nscale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree).\nA pilot test comprising a sample of 60 responses was con-\nducted to test the reliability of the instruments. Cronbach's\nalpha values based on standardized items (Table 2) were .700\nfor time pressure and .769 for challenge appraisal. These\nindicated that the instruments tapping the predictor variables\npossessed reliability. However, the items measuring job sat-\nisfaction showed lower internal validity (Cronbach's  =\n.637). A critical appraisal of the item statistics measuring job\nsatisfaction revealed that three of the items indicated low\nmean: (a) Most of the things I have to do on this job seem\nuseless or trivial (M = 2.82), (b) I frequently think of quitting\nthis job (M = 2.18), and (c) I have often trouble figuring out\nwhether I am doing well or poorly on this job (M = 3.52). It\nwas considered that the respondents were reluctant to answer\nthese questions. This would have impaired the internal valid-\nity of these items. Consequently, these items were excluded,\nand the instrument was modified to include 12 instead of the\noriginal 15 items. Retest based on the modified instrument\n(12 items) indicated Cronbach's alpha coefficient of .772,\nthus showing that the items in the modified instrument pos-\nsessed internal validity.\nResults and Discussion\nDescriptive Statistics\nDemographics are shown in Table 1. Male and female\nthe research sample. Females thus constituted approximately\none third of the sample size. The majority of respondents\nalso revealed that 52.8% of the respondents were single,\nwhereas 47.2% were married. The majority of the respon-\ndents (46.1%) were in MA/MSc/MBA category, closely fol-\nlowed by MPhil/MS (35.5%). PhD respondents constituted\nrespondents had 1 to 5 years teaching experience, followed\nthan 15 years experience. Respondents from management\nsciences and engineering sciences constituted 28.7% and\ngroups. Permanent faculty members formed 73% of the sam-\nple and almost one fourth (26.2%) were visiting faculty.\nSlightly more than half of the respondents (55.3%) belonged\nto public sector universities.\nBesides Cronbach's alpha coefficient, Table 2 also high-\nlights data on arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and\nPearson's correlation coefficient. Arithmetic means were\nand challenge, respectively. Within the predictors, variability\nin time pressure was higher (SD = 0.186) than challenge (SD =\n0.044). Seventeen respondents (6%) reported that they were\nvery often pressed for time, as against 12 respondents (4%)\nwho rarely/never experienced time pressure. Highest\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 3. Comparison Between Pakistani and German\nRespondents.\n P G P G\nNote. P = Pakistani respondents; G = German respondents.\npercentage (30%) reported that they occasionally felt time\npressured. Responding to \"How often must you finish work\nlater because of having too much to do?\" 12 respondents\n(4%) replied, \"very often,\" while 21 (7%) replied, \"very\nrarely/never.\" Only 15 respondents (5%) felt that very often\na fast pace of work was required of them. An equal number\nreplied that they very rarely/never required a fast pace.\nHighest percentage (22%) reported that they often required a\nfast pace. In response to the item \"I feel challenged,\" 4% (11\nrespondents) strongly disagreed, 31% (87 respondents)\nagreed with the statement, whereas 11% (32 respondents)\nstrongly agreed. In response to the question \"Generally\nspeaking, I am very satisfied with this job,\" 7 (2%) respon-\n(12%) strongly agreed.\nTable 3 gives the comparison between Pakistani and\nGerman respondents. Mean level of time pressure experi-\nenced by the German respondents in Ohly and Fritz's study\nwas 3.42. Mean level of time pressure experienced by\nPakistani respondents was 2.74. Pakistani respondents were,\ntherefore, less time-pressured than their German counter-\nparts. Variability for time pressure was also lower (SD =\n0.186) in case of Pakistani respondents compared with the\nGerman respondents (SD = 0.72). Mean level of challenge\nexperienced by Pakistani respondents was 3.473 when com-\npared with 4.02 in Ohly and Fritz's study, indicating a lower\nlevel for Pakistani respondents. Variability in challenge was\nalso lower in Pakistani respondents (SD = 0.044) in compari-\nson with the German respondents (SD = 1.28).\nInferential Statistics\nH1 propounds that there is a significant and positive relation-\nship between chronic time pressure and challenge appraisal.\nCorrelation analysis (Table 2) indicates a positive and highly\nsignificant relationship between these two study variables\ndegree relationship. In comparison, Ohly and Fritz (2010),\ndoing their research in Germany, a mono-chronic society,\nhave reported a moderate degree of highly significant corre-\nlation between chronic time pressure and challenge (r = .330,\np  .001). Regression analysis (Table 4) shows that time\npressure explains 5% of variance in challenge appraisal in\nPakistani teachers (R2 = .055). One SD change in time pres-\nsure results in 23.4 SD change in challenge appraisal ( =\nAccording to H2, there is a positive and significant rela-\ntionship between challenge appraisal and job satisfaction.\nCorrelation analysis (Table 2) indicates a highly significant\npositive relationship between these two study variables (r =\n.318; p = .01). It is a moderate degree of relationship (Davis,\n1971). Multiple regression analysis (Table 5) indicates that\nTable 1.Demographics.\nSerial Demographics Frequency %\n2 Age interval (years)\n3 Marital status\n4 Qualifications\n5 Experience (years)\nTable 2.Mean, SD, Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, and\nCronbach's Alpha Coefficient.\nNote.

One SD change in chal-\nlenge appraisal results in 25.1 SD change in job satisfaction\nteristics have two components, time pressure and job control.\nChallenge is the symbiotic affect of time pressure and job\ncontrol, and has a positive relationship with performance-\nrelated behaviors. The findings of this study are also in har-\nmony with the findings of Decker and Borgen (1993), Carroll\n(2007) who reported a positive relationship between chal-\nlenge appraisal and job satisfaction. The findings reveal that\nthe teachers in Pakistani universities consider their nature of\nwork as challenging. H2 is, therefore, accepted.\nH3 infers that time pressure correlates significantly with\njob satisfaction. The direction of relationship has not been\nmentioned as, according to the literature review, time pres-\nsure exerts paradoxical influences on job satisfaction.\nCorrelation analysis (Table 2) indicates a positive and highly\nsignificant relationship between time pressure and job satis-\nfaction (r = .346, p = .01). The relationship is of a moderate\ndegree (Davis, 1971). Multiple regression analysis (Table 5)\nreveals that 1 SD change in time pressure results in 28.8 SD\nchange in job satisfaction ( = .288). These findings validate\nH3. The findings are in harmony with those of Maule et al.\na positive relationship between the two variables. This posi-\ntive relationship has been further explained by Bosewell\net al. (2004), who maintained that whereas hindrance-related\nstress predicts negative outcomes, challenge-related stress\nleads to positive outcomes. This indirectly implies that time\npressure, through challenge appraisal, leads to job satisfac-\ntion among Pakistani university professors.\nConclusion\nIt is the first study which has investigated the relationships\nbetween time pressure, challenge appraisal, and job satis-\nfaction in the backdrop of a poly-chronic society, and has\ncompared the findings with those of a study carried out in\na mono-chronic society (Ohly & Fritz, 2010). The findings\nreveal that Pakistani respondents experience a lesser level\nof time pressure when compared with the German respon-\ndents. Also, there has been lesser variability in time pres-\nsure of Pakistani respondents in comparison with the\nGerman respondents. This implies that Pakistani respon-\ndents demonstrate conformist behavior, whereas German\nrespondents are individualistic. The findings were expected\nas the former represent a mono-chronic society, whereas\nthe latter a poly-chronic society. The study finds that, like\ntheir German counterparts, Pakistani university teachers\nconsider time pressure as a challenge-related stress. The\ncorrelation between time pressure and challenge shows a\nlower degree of relationship in case of Pakistani respon-\ndents compared with a moderate degree for German\nrespondents. The theoretical framework investigated by\nthe study is evolutionary in nature and may be further\nexpanded by adding job control and proactive behavior\n(Ohly & Fritz, 2010) into the matrix. To improve the rigor\nof the study, a population where probability sampling is\npossible, for example, banking, telecommunications, pub-\nlic sector corporations, and so on, is recommended.\nAppendix\nResearch Instruments\nTime pressure\n1.
