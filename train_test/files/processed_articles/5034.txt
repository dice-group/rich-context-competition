Recently, Boccotti has patented the REWEC1 (REsonant sea Wave Energy\nConverter solution 1), a submerged breakwater that performs an active coast protection, embedding an Oscillating\nWater Column device, which is capable of operating under resonant conditions with that sea state, which gives the\nhighest yearly energy contribution. The REWEC1 dynamic behavior can be approximated by means of a mass-spring-\ndamper system. According to this approximation, a criterion for evaluating the oscillating natural frequency of the\nREWEC1 has been derived. This criterion has been validated against both experimental results and computational fluid\ndynamics simulations, performed on a REWEC1 laboratory-scale model. The numerical simulations have shown a good\nagreement between measurements and predictions.\n",

Until\ntoday, more than 500 devices have been proposed, such as\n\"rocking ducks\" (Salter, 1974), \"articulated rafts\"\n(Falnes and Budal, 1978), and \"oscillating water columns\"\n(Wells, 1993). Despite the inventive fervor, only few of\nthese WECs were actually manufactured and tested. The\nlargest obstacle to the commercial development of WECs\nis the high total cost. For instance, in the case of Oscillating\nWater Column (OWC) devices, the construction of a rein-\nforced concrete structure is required and this can constitute\nup to 66% of total costs. A possible solution to reduce\nthese costs is the insertion of the OWC device inside a\nbreakwater. An example of this type of installation is the\none operating in the port of Sakata (Takahashi et al., 1992)\nsince 1989. In this way, the incidence of the cost due to the\nstructure for the OWC is drastically reduced, and the plant\nfulfills a double purpose: to defend the stretch of water\nbehind it and to produce electrical energy by means of gen-\nerators connected to one or more turbines (for instance,\nhigh solidity Wells turbines). The Wells turbine is actually\na self-rectifying axial flow turbine (Raghunathan, 1995)\nsuitable for the conversion of the kinetic energy of the\noscillating air flow into unidirectional mechanical energy\nof the turbine shaft. Another possibility is the use of\nimpulse turbines (Thakker and Hourigan, 2004). Both\nWells and impulse turbines have been examined in various\nNumerical prediction of the natural\nfrequency of an Oscillating\nWater Column operating under\nresonant conditions\nMarco Torresi1, Filippo Scarpetta1, Giuseppina Martina1,\nPasquale F Filianoti2 and Sergio M Camporeale1\n Keywords\nRenewable energy, wave energy converter, oscillating water column, computational fluid dynamics, damped harmonic\noscillations\nSpecial Issue Article\nDipartimento di Meccanica, Matematica e Management (DMMM),\nPolitecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy\nDipartimento di Ingegneria Civile, dell'Energia, dell'Ambiente e dei\nMateriali (DICEAM), Universit\u00e0 Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria,\nReggio Calabria, Italy\nCorresponding author:\nMarco Torresi, Dipartimento di Meccanica, Matematica e Management\nEmail: marco.torresi@poliba.it\nconfigurations for wave energy conversion (e.g. Setoguchi\nand Takao, 2006). In order to improve the energy conver-\nsion process, both high and low solidity Wells turbines\nneed to be characterized by good efficiencies over a wide\nrange of flow rates (Curran et al., 1997; Raghunathan,\n1995). Furthermore, turbine performance has to be opti-\nmized not only considering the turbine as a standalone\nmachine but also as a whole together with the OWC plant.\nSeveral experimental analyses have been carried out in\norder to investigate the performance of Wells turbines. For\ninstance, wind tunnel tests have been considered under\nboth constant or reciprocating flow conditions (Torresi\net al., 2007), using scaled devices (Filianoti and\nCamporeale, 2009), or in operative plants, such as the\nMore detailed investigations of the fluid dynamics of\nWells turbines have been carried out by means of compu-\ntational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, regarding hydrau-\nlic low solidity Wells turbines (Camporeale et al., 2003),\nor high solidity Wells turbines (Dhanasekaran and\nREWEC1 (REsonant sea Wave Energy Converter solution\n1), which consists of several caissons placed close to\neach other, in order to form a submerged breakwater\n(Figure 1(b)). Each caisson encloses a pressurized air\nvolume, which is connected to a completely submerged\nvertical duct open to the sea, where a hydraulic low solid-\nity Wells turbine can be placed for the direct conversion of\nthe kinetic energy of the OWC into mechanical energy\nActually, the incident waves cause fluctuations of the\nwater free surface inside the pressurized caisson, and the\nalternate exhalation and inhalation of the water in the ver-\ntical duct drive the turbine. The main characteristic of the\nREWEC1 is that it can be designed in order to operate\nunder resonance conditions with the characteristic fre-\nquency of the sea state, which gives the greatest yearly\nenergy contribution. Under such conditions, the amplitude\nof the fluctuations of the water free surface inside the pres-\nsurized caisson increases, increasing the amount of kinetic\nenergy of the OWC. Actually, the REWEC1 dynamic\nbehavior can be approximated by means of a mass-spring-\ndamper system. According to this approximation, a crite-\nrion for calculating the oscillating frequencies of the\nREWEC1 can be derived. This criterion has been validated\nagainst both the experimental results and CFD simula-\ntions, performed on a REWEC1 laboratory-scale model.\nPreviously, CFD simulations were also carried out in order\nto study the dynamic behavior of a scaled model placed in\nExperimental set-up\nThe REWEC1 (Figure 1(b)) is essentially a submerged\ncaisson with a U-tube inside. The first branch of the U-tube\nis a vertical duct connecting the free water surface to the\nsecond branch, a chamber in which an air pocket is gener-\nated by means of compressed air. The value of the\nREWEC1 undamped natural frequency, fn\n, depends on\nthe value of the height of the air pocket inside the chamber,\n\n, under resting conditions (Figure 2(a)). In order to\nreach the resonance conditions with the frequencies of the\nfundamental seas, the value of \ncan be modified varying\nthe value of the pressure inside the chamber. In order to\nreplicate the REWEC1 dynamic behavior in laboratory, an\nexperimental test rig (Filianoti, 2004) was specifically\ndesigned (Figure 2(b)), in order to generate free damped\nharmonic oscillations. A lower caisson replicates the\nREWEC1, whereas an upper caisson is used in order to\nsimulate the REWEC1 submergence. The use of the upper\ncaisson is needed in order to be able to generate the non-\nequilibrium initial condition, as will be explained in the\ntest procedure description. As a result of the free damped\nharmonic oscillations, the value of the damped natural fre-\nquency, fd\n, was obtained. Then, taking into account the\nFigure 1. (a) Conventional breakwater and (b) REWEC1\nschematics.\n102 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 7(3)\ndamping ratio, , the value of the undamped natural fre-\nquency, fn\n, was derived\nf\nf\nn\nd\n=\n-\nAll the geometrical parameters (Figure 2(a)) of the\nexperimental device are summarized in Table 1.\nThe test procedure is as follows:\n1. The valves of both upper and lower caissons are\nopened, connecting each air pocket with the\natmosphere.\n2. A specified amount of water is introduced in the\nupper caisson and part of it overflows in the lower\none. During this operation, the valve in the lower\ncaisson is closed, in order to generate an air pocket\ninside it with a  lower than \n.\n3. Air is pumped inside the lower caisson until the\ndesired resting condition is achieved.\n4. In order to generate the initial non-equilibrium\ncondition ( \nin\n\n), the valve of the\nupper caisson is closed and air is pumped inside it,\nreaching p1\n patm\n.\n5. When the valve of the upper caisson is opened, the\nvalue of the pressure in the upper caisson drops to\nthe atmospheric value and the free damped har-\nmonic oscillations occur.\nIn order to evaluate fd\nand , the values of the pressure\ninside the air pocket of both the upper, p1\n, and the lower,\n, caissons were measured by means of pressure trans-\nducers. Table 2 summarizes the initial and resting condi-\ntions during the test. The results of this test have been\ncompared with those computed by the analytical model\nand the CFD simulations.\nAnalytical model\nAn analytical model, describing the behavior of the water\nflow inside a REWEC1, has been developed under the\nsimplifying hypothesis of one-dimensional and incom-\npressible flow. Actually, the REWEC1 is essentially a\nU-tube (Figure 3) and its fluid-dynamic behavior can be\ncorrectly described along a streamline, which starts from\nthe air\u00adwater interface inside the lower caisson (point A)\nand ends at the air\u00adwater interface inside the upper caisson\n(point B).\nApplying the generalized Bernoulli equation along that\nstreamline, one obtains\n=\ng\nu\nt\nds H H H\nA\nB\n \n\n\nwhere HA\nand HB\nare the total heads in the points A\nand B, respectively, while HW\nis the sum of the head\nlosses along the streamline. The left hand side of Equation\n2 is actually the integral of the Euler equation and, for\nthe sake of simplicity, can be computed considering\nFigure 2.

Geometrical dimension of the experimental device.\nGeometrical items Dimension (m)\nLc\nonly the two vertical paths along the streamline, neglect-\ning the contribution of the local inertia of the water\nbelow the bottom end of the duct. The first path goes\nfrom the air\u00adwater interface inside the lower caisson to\nthe bottom opening of the vertical duct (C); the second\ngoes from the aforesaid aperture to the air\u00adwater inter-\nface inside the upper caisson. Hence, the integral can be\nrewritten as follows\n=\ng\nu\nt\nds\ng\nu\nt\nds\ng\nu\nt\nds\nA\nB\nA\nC\nC\nB\nw\n  \n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\nwhere, in the first integral, u can be expressed as the deri-\nvate of the height,  , of the air pocket inside the lower\ncaisson, while uw\nis the velocity in the vertical duct.\nAccording to the continuity equation, the velocity uw\ncan\nbe written as a function of u as follows\nu\nb\ns\nd\ndt\nw\n=\n\nwhere b and s represent the cross sections of the lower\ncaisson and the vertical duct, respectively (Figure 2(a)). In\nthis model, we assume small values of the oscillations of\n and a, with respect to the height of the air pocket in\nresting condition, \n. According to this assumption, the\nvalues of  and a are always assumed to be equal to \nin the geodetic heads. Therefore, the integration\nalong the first and the second path gives\n=\ng\nu\nt\nds\ng\nc w\nd\ndt g\nb\ns\nL\nd\ndt\nA\nB\nc\n \n\n- -\n( ) +\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe total head, HA\n, is related to the absolute pressure, pA\n,\nof the air pocket inside the lower caisson, as follows\nH a t\np\ng g\nd\ndt\nA\nA\n=\n- + +\n( )+ +\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming a polytropic law for the thermodynamic\nbehavior of the air inside the chamber, pA\ncan be evalu-\nated as a function of the air volume, which is directly pro-\nportional to the height, , of the air pocket\np p g a t\nA\nm\n+ + +\n( )\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nwhere the subscript \"0\" refers to the resting condition and\nm is the polytropic index.

The total head, HB\n, is related to the\nabsolute pressure, pB\n, at the duct mouth, which is evalu-\nated as a function of the pressure in the upper caisson,\n, as follows\nH\np\ng\nb\ns g\nd\ndt\nB\n=\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe head losses,\nHW\n, can be estimated as the sum of\nthe continuous friction losses, Hc\n, and the minor head\nlosses in the vertical duct, Hd\n, whose general form is as\nfollows\nH\ng\nk u u\nW i i\n,\n=\nwhere ki\ncan be assumed as the value of the coefficient of\neither the friction losses, kc\n, or minor head losses, kd\n.\nTherefore, the head losses are written as\nFigure 3.

Equation 12 expresses the equation of\nthe damped harmonic oscillator, associated to the device,\nas a function of . Therefore, the dynamic behavior of the\nplant can be approximated by means of a mass-spring-\ndamper system. According to vibration theory, the\nundamped natural frequency of the system is then\nf\nC\nA\nn\n=\nwhich, actually, depends on the geometry of the device and\nthe value of the pressure inside the air pocket. In order to\nvalidate the analytical model, the value of fn\ncalculated\nfrom Equation 16 will be compared to these resulting from\nboth the experimental and CFD analyses.\nCFD analysis\nThe CFD analysis has been carried out using a computa-\ntional domain, which reproduces the 2D schematic reported\nin Figure 2(a)). This domain has been discretized by means\nof the grid generator Pointwise adopting a multi-block\nstructured mesh. The total mesh size has approximately\n60,000 cells. The numerical domain has been imported in\nthe ANSYS Fluent solver. The physical model under inves-\ntigation is described by means of the Navier\u00adStokes equa-\ntions written for an unsteady two-phase flow. These\nequations are discretized according to a Finite Volume\napproach, adopting a pressure-based algorithm in its\nimplicit formulation. The two-phase interaction is taken\ninto account by means of the Eulerian Volume of Fluid\n(VOF) Model. Air is assumed to be compressible, in order\nto take into account the compressibility of the air pocket\ninside the chamber. The SIMPLE algorithm has been used\nfor the pressure-velocity coupling. Regarding the spatial\ndiscretization of the equations, the Green-Gauss cell-based\nscheme has been used for gradients, the PRESTO! scheme\nfor pressure, whereas first-order upwind schemes for\nmomentum and the energy. In order to evaluate the surface\nof separation of the different phases, the Geo-Reconstruct\nmodel has been used. Regarding the temporal discretiza-\ntion, a time step t\n=\ns has been chosen and the first-\norder implicit scheme has been used for the transient\nformulation. Every two time steps, the values of the pres-\nsure inside both the lower and the upper caissons have been\nregistered, allowing the analysis of the dynamic behavior\nof the water inside the device during post-processing.\nResults\nIn order to make a comparison with the experimental test,\na numerical simulation has been carried out, setting the\nvalues of the initial and the resting conditions reported in\nTable 2. The graph in Figure 4 shows a comparison\nbetween the values of p2\nregistered during the simulation\nand the experimental test (Filianoti, 2004). From the com-\nparison, we can see that the values of the pressure regis-\ntered in both cases are in quite good agreement in terms of\namplitude, while the values registered in the experimental\ntest seems to have a time delay with respect to the CFD\nones. The value of the time period between the second and\nthe third peak has been assumed to be equal to the damped\nnatural period, Td\n, from which the values of the damped\nnatural frequencies, fd\nimental test and 0.896Hz in the CFD simulation.\nFrom both the experimental and the CFD analyses, the\nvalue of the undamped natural frequency, fn\n, has been cal-\nculated from the value of fd\n(Equation 1), in order to make\na comparison with the analytical result (Equation 16).\nThe value of the damping ratio, , has been evaluated com-\nputing the logarithmic decrement,  , between the second\nand the third peak of the oscillations. From the value of ,\nthe following equation has been used for the calculation of\nthe damping ratio, \n \n\n\n-\nTable 3 summarizes the results derived from the ana-\nlytical model, the experimental test, and the CFD simula-\ntion. Other CFD simulations have been carried out\nconsidering the same resting conditions and varying the\ninitial ones (Table 4). From the registered value of p2\n, the\nvalues of  and fd\nhave been calculated for each simula-\ntion according to the same methods described before.\nThe graph reported in Figure 5(a)) shows the values of \nfor the different values of \ni\nn. The trend shown in the graph\nis due to the fact that the value of the damping ratio grows\nwith the absolute value of the difference between \nin\nand\n\ndue to the increase of dissipations in the water flow. The\ngraph reported in Figure 5(b)) shows the values of fd\nfor\nthe different values of \nin\n. Considering that the value of fn\nremains constant, from Equation 1, we expect that also the\nvalue of fd\ngrows with the absolute value of the difference\nFigure 4.

As shown in Figure 5(b), the calcu-\nlated values of fd\nare in agreement with this prediction\nonly if the value of \nin\nis smaller than the value of \n.\nFinally, the graph reported in Figure 6 shows the compari-\nson between the values of fn\ncalculated from the CFD sim-\nulation and the ones calculated by means of the analytical\nmodel (Equation 16).As expected from the previous consid-\nerations, the values are in quite good agreement when the\nvalue of \nin\nis smaller than the value of \n.\nConclusion\nThe results derived from the CFD simulations are in good\nagreement with the experimental test ones, showing that\nthe proposed 2D numerical model can be successfully used\nfor the evaluation of both the damped, fd\n, and undamped,\nfn\n, natural frequencies of a REWEC1. The proposed ana-\nlytical model, based on a simple analogy with a mass-\nspring-damper system, has been also validated, allowing a\nquite good prediction of the undamped natural frequency,\nfn\n, with respect to both numerical and experimental calcu-\nlations. Finally, by means of the CFD analysis, the effect of\nthe initial conditions on both damped, fd\n, and undamped,\nfn\n, natural frequencies has been considered under the\nhypothesis of maintaining constant the resting condition.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nBoccotti P (1998) Caisson for absorbing wave energy.
