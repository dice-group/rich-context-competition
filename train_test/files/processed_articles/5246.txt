Ongoing instability and population displacement undermine scope for\ndevelopment, and damaged infrastructure, low coverage of health services, and limited government capacity and a human\nresource base have resulted in a fragmented health system. Despite considerable attention, effort and support, the issues\nand challenges facing South Sudan remain deep and sustained, and urban\u00adrural disparities are considerable. There is a need\nto maintain investments in MNCH care and to support developing systems, institutions, and programs. This review of the\nliterature offers a commentary and appraisal of the current MNCH situation in South Sudan. It explores the barriers and\nchallenges of promoting MNCH gains, and identifies priorities that will contribute to addressing the Millennium Development\nGoals and the emerging health priorities for the post-2015 development agenda.\n",

Investing in MNCH is rec-\nognised as contributing to poverty reduction, economic\ngrowth and productivity, and more stable societies (Singh,\nDarroch, Ashford, & Vlassof, 2009). Poor MNCH remains a\nsignificant problem in many low- and middle-income coun-\ntries (LMICs) and poses a significant gap to achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). This review and\ncommentary on the literature focuses on South Sudan, a\ncountry that continues to face considerable challenges in\nmeeting MNCH care needs and improving health outcomes.\nDrawing on both gray and published literature, it provides an\noverview of the MNCH situation in late-2014, and seeks to\nbring together available information on the MNCH-related\nchallenges facing South Sudan's people and systems.\nFraming Maternal and Child Health Within the\nMillennium Development Goals\nare specifically focused on health: MDG 4--Reduce Child\nMortality, MDG 5--Improve Maternal Health, and MDG\n6--Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and other Diseases.

Primary health care units are meant to be\nthe first point of contact between communities and the health\nsystem and should provide basic preventive, promotive, and\ncurative care for around 15,000 people. These units aim to\nprovide higher-level services for around 50,000 people and,\nin addition to services offered by primary health care units,\nprovide basic diagnostic laboratory services and maternity\ncare.

Post-independence optimism was shattered by the\ngovernment's decision to halt oil production in January 2012,\nhindering both planned health system development and dam-\naging relationships with external donors (Green, 2012).\nA broad set of issues have an impact on effective develop-\nment and are briefly described below.\nGovernance. Throughout the period of conflict and immedi-\nately following the referendum, governance in Southern\nSudan was absent or constrained by the low capacity of gov-\nernment and lack of personnel. Initiatives aimed at improv-\ning governance following the referendum had mixed results\n(Bennett et al., 2010), although the launch of the Health Sec-\ntor Development Plan in early 2012 provided an opportunity\nto facilitate improvement. Governance and implementation\narrangements are coordinated by development partners, usu-\nally in collaboration with South Sudan's MoH. Despite the\nMoH demanding greater ownership, some concern around\nthe level of \"fiduciary and governance risks\" remains (Aus-\ntralian Agency for International Development [AusAID],\n2012). The lack of personnel skilled in policy, planning, and\noversight presents a serious challenge for governance\nSecurity. Localised conflicts remain in South Sudan, due in\npart to disputes over border areas and oil-revenue sharing\n(the British Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] News, 2014;\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], 2013;\nUNICEF, 2011). Widespread conflict broke out in South\nSudan in December 2013, leading to thousands of deaths and\nthe displacement of more than half a million people before a\nceasefire was signed between the government and rebels on\ntensions remained high, and over 1.9 million people were\nmillion were displaced internally (Office for the Coordina-\nSouth Sudan also continues to experience other ongoing\nconflicts and security challenges, including intertribal con-\nflicts, widespread landmines and unexploded ordnance,\ninflux of returnees, and natural disasters. Years of conflict\ncontributed to the disintegration of social fabric, leading to\ndecreased protection and conditions exposing people to high\nlevels of violence and exploitation (UNICEF, 2011).\nLandmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) pose a con-\ntinued threat to communities in South Sudan, despite grow-\ning awareness and control efforts (GoSS, 2011). The National\nMine Action Authority, which oversees relevant activities in\nSouth Sudan, and other associated organizations have\nincreased the awareness of nearly two million people con-\ncerning mine risks and have removed more than 50,000 land-\nmines and UXOs (UN Mission in South Sudan, 2013).\nSouth Sudan also faces a degree of internal insecurity\nresulting from the return of refugees from camps in other\ncountries of Africa, refugees fleeing to South Sudan from\nconflicts elsewhere in Africa, and growing numbers of inter-\nnally displaced people (IDP) due to ongoing instability. The\nIn addition to experiencing prolonged conflict, South\nSudan is also prone to natural disasters; a National Baseline\nMugo et al. 7\npopulation suffered from drought or floods (GoSS, 2011).\nFunding/international aid environment.In the presence of\nrecurrent violence and instability in South Sudan, several\nkey funding programs were ended simultaneously and\nreplaced by less generous programs (Downie, 2012). The\nMDTF, which had covered several key health initiatives in\nSouth Sudan, was operationally closed on December 31,\npendent Evaluation of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for South\nSudan [MDTF-SS], 2013). The MDTF marshalled the finan-\ncial resources of several external donors, but concerns\nregarding ongoing funding remain. The MDTF contributed\nto establishing and strengthening state institutions and\nexpanded public services and delivery. One identified prob-\nlem was the transition from the Rapid Impact Emergency\nProject (RIEP) to more sustainable services and systems\n(Independent Evaluation of the MDTF-SS, 2013).\nSouth Sudan was due to receive a US$130 million credit\nfrom the World Bank Group's Fund for the poorest countries,\nthe International Development Association (IDA; World\nBank, 2013), as well as funding and support from several\nother sources including United States Agency for\nInternational Development (USAID) and Department for\nInternational Development, UK (DFID; MoH, n.d.).

Fox and Manu (2012)\nsuggest that coordination by the major development partners\nin South Sudan improved following a geographic division of\nresponsibility for health assistance among development\npartners.\nPromoting aid effectiveness is a significant issue given\nprior history of fragmentation and poor coordination. Global\nattention to development effectiveness has led to attention\nbeing focused on issues such as national ownership, mutual\naccountability, transparency, and coordination--all relevant\nto more effective aid. Debates concerning this broader aid\nand development context simultaneously offer guidance and\nplace pressure on both the South Sudanese government and\nits development partners to promote better practice.\nSouth Sudan is a founding member of the g7+, an inter-\ngovernmental organization of \"fragile\" and \"post\"-conflict\nstates. It draws on the New Deal for engagement in fragile\nstates, a declaration concerning how best to progress devel-\nopment in the least developed states with the support of the\ninternational community (Dyori, n.d.). The New Deal (g7+,\n2011) offers guidance on engagement between fragile states\nand their development partners, and specifically sets out\nobjectives concerning the achievement of five peace- and\nstate-building goals as the foundation for progressing the\nMDG targets. These include promoting \"legitimate politics,\"\nsecurity, justice, economic foundations, and revenues and\nservices. South Sudan is piloting the New Deal and com-\npleted its first fragility assessment in late 2012, the first ele-\nment of the \"pathway out of fragility\" (Ministry of Finance\nMaternal and Child Health Service-Related\nChallenges\nAccess. Delays in seeking medical care are a significant fac-\ntor contributing to maternal deaths (Geller, Cox, Callaghan,\ncomplications in LMIC, such as South Sudan, face numerous\nbarriers to access (Barkat, Rahman, Bose, Com, & Akhter,\n1997; Mbaruku, van Roosmalen, Kimondo, Bilango, &\nGeographical\nPregnant women in South Sudan often experience consider-\nable time delays when trying to reach a health facility for\ntreatment (Karoshi & Keith, 2009; Sivaganesh & Senarath,\n2009). Geographic barriers impede women with obstetric\ncomplications from accessing emergency obstetric care\n(Borghi, Ensor, Somanathan, Lissner, & Mills, 2006).Access\nis generally worse in rural than urban areas, and 83% of the\npopulation in South Sudan is rural (South Sudan National\nBureau of Statistics, 2012). Women in South Sudan may\ntravel long distances by foot to reach health centers (Murphy,\n2007), as many villages do not have road access and families\ndo not have access to vehicles or public transportation. It\nmay take literally days for women with life-threatening con-\nditions to reach a health care facility; many women die from\ntreatable complications.\nFinancial\nThe cost of receiving health care is another major constraint\nin South Sudan, due to the need for transportation, physician\n8 SAGE Open\nand facility fees, and the cost of medications and other medi-\ncal supplies (Borghi et al., 2006). Pregnant women may be\nseen by community members as a \"burden\" due to the high\ncosts, often unaffordable by families, associated with child-\nbirth. The government has committed to free services in the\npublic sector (GoSS, 2011); however, under-the-counter\npayments have been reported, which will require ongoing\nmonitoring (Rajkotia et al., 2007), and, as in other settings,\ntime lost seeking money to pay for care may delay access to\ncrucial services and lead to loss of life (Lewis, 2003; Prata\nCultural and Social\nAt a global level, achieving the MDG targets relies heavily\non women's empowerment and equal access to education,\nwork, health care, and decision making, yet MDG 3, con-\ncerning the promotion of gender equality and empowerment\nof women, remains largely unfulfilled (UN, 2012). Women\nin rural areas often do not have the power to seek, receive, or\ncommunicate around health issues, including information\nthat can help prevent maternal mortality such as safe abor-\ntion, family planning, and antenatal care (Lewis, 2003). Girls\ncontinue to be discriminated against with respect to educa-\ntion at all levels, yet education enables women to gain the\nknowledge, confidence, skills, and opportunities to increase\ntheir social and economic status in their household and in\nsociety (Gill, Pande, & Malhotra, 2007). Educated women\nhave better health outcomes; for each additional year of edu-\ncation achieved by 1,000 women, two maternal deaths will\nGender inequalities and discrimination lie at the root of\nchild marriage, common in South Sudan.

Pregnancy and delivery are particularly dangerous\nfor adolescents, who have a five times greater risk of dying\nin childbirth than women in their 20s (WHO &UNFPA,\nThe contraceptive prevalence rate among married women\nor those in other unions is particularly low in South Sudan,\nreflecting the high levels of illiteracy and lack of education\nabout reproductive health and family planning (Rajkotia et\nwomen, and especially adolescents, often lack access to con-\nsistently and appropriately stocked family planning services\nand distribution points (Aquilina et al., 2006). South Sudan\nhas high fertility rates, estimated at 6.7 births per woman\n(MoH, 2011), which exacerbate the high risk of maternal\ndeath (MoH & National Bureau of Statistics, 2013; New\nSudan Center for Statistics and Evaluation & UNICEF,\nGender inequality is also high in South Sudan, and gen-\nder-based violence widespread (Learning on Gender and\nEvaluation of the MDTF-SS (2013) found that gender\ninequality was not a Task Force priority during initial imple-\nmentation phases, and it was not until 2009 that it received\nproper attention. Addressing gender inequalities has now\nbeen identified as a key priority in South Sudan (GoSS,\nThere are many forms of traditional practice in South\nSudan, and much health-seeking behavior relates to tradi-\ntional medicine. Traditional healers are often sought due to\npersonal beliefs, or because no other means of health care is\navailable or accessible (MoH, 2009). According to the\nhold population in South Sudan that does not have access to a\nhealth care facility seeks help from traditional healers (South\nSudan National Bureau of Statistics, 2012). South Sudan is\n2012), held together primarily by their shared struggle and\ncollective opposition to the north (Jok, 2011). Health-seeking\nbehavior in general, and for these varied groups, remains\ninadequately understood (MoH & GoSS, 2011; National\n2015 Health Sector Development Plan is to improve access\nto, and the delivery of, quality primary health services\nthrough, among other things, mobilising the community\naround appropriate health care seeking (MoH & GoSS, 2011).\nApplying multi-faceted concepts of access to primary\nhealth care, as elaborated by Levesque, Harris, and Russell\n(2013), will be helpful in identifying enablers that should be\nsupported and barriers that need to be addressed.\nHealth facilities and human resources for health.Human\nresources for health (HRH) play a pivotal role in the avail-\nability, accessibility, and equity of health services. The avail-\nability of skilled birth attendants able to detect, prevent, and\nmanage obstetric complications as well as to provide drugs,\nequipment, and other supplies is the single most important\nfactor in preventing maternal deaths (Rosenfield & Schwartz,\n2005). South Sudan's health worker density is far lower than\nthe minimum threshold recommended by the WHO (Gupta\nphysicians across 8 states (a doctor/population ratio of\nSouth Sudan has experienced a critical shortage of skilled\nhuman resources in all sectors, including health (MoH &\nGoSS, 2011). Development of institutional and human\nresource capacity is a stated government priority (MoH,\n2010), and although innovative training of frontline health\nworkers has commenced, considerable constraints remain\nMugo et al. 9\nEven when women do have the means of reaching a health\nservice, inadequate numbers of high quality services and facil-\nities (and insufficient numbers of qualified personnel to staff\nthe services) can increase delays and raise the risk of maternal\nmortality. Delays can occur when facilities do not have the\ncapacity to perform basic services, which can put women with\nemergency complications at heightened risk of maternal mor-\ntality (Karoshi & Keith, 2009). Poor maternal health outcomes\nin South Sudan are strongly connected to poor prenatal, deliv-\nery, and postnatal care services in health facilities (Rai et al.,\n2012), and inadequate links between the community and the\nfirst level of the referral system significantly increase the risk\nof maternal death for women. Health facilities in South Sudan\noften also face chronic shortages of medicines and other nec-\nessary supplies. Medicines are supplied through the MoH,\nhowever transportation to facilities, and storage within these\nfacilities, remains a significant challenge (Ministry of Health\nHealth service providers in \"post\"-conflict settings need\nto understand and be sensitive to the differing community\nperspectives around health and health care, and of the impor-\ntance of building trust in health services (Zwi, Bunde-\nBirouste, Grove, Waller, & Ritchie, 2006). They must also be\nsensitive to historical inequalities, socio-cultural and eco-\nnomic developments, and eroded trust that might be present\nDiscussion\nThis review has reflected on the widespread MNCH needs\nand challenges in South Sudan. The civil war fractured social\nstructures, displaced millions of people, destroyed much of\nthe physical infrastructure, and led to the collapse of the pub-\nlic health system, resulting in high morbidity and mortality\n(GoSS, 2011). Despite efforts by the GoSS and the interna-\ntional community, South Sudan remains far from achieving\nthe MDGs, a major challenge in all \"fragile\" and conflict-\naffected states. A broad and comprehensive approach to\naddressing population-based MNCH is required, along with\nongoing support to developing institutions and systems.\nPriority Areas\nThree priority areas emerge from this narrative review: (a)\naddressing the macro-political and \"post\"-conflict security\nand development context, (b) focusing on the key determi-\nnants of health, and (c) building the health system, its capac-\nity, and its capabilities, with the support of the international\ncommunity. These priorities are interrelated and should be\nsimultaneously considered in addressing MNCH needs,\nthough are discussed separately below.\nMacro-political and \"post\"-conflict security and development con-\ntext.South Sudan and other \"fragile\" and \"post\"-conflict\nstates have shown least progress toward meeting MDG tar-\ngets and exhibit the most pressing health and development\nneeds. The conflict-to-peace transition and the challenges of\nnation building are fundamental, requiring deep and sus-\ntained commitment by both government and development\npartners. These are mutually reinforcing--charting a vision\nfor the country's development and establishing a sense of\nsecurity and stability along with effective governance are\ncentral to securing international community support and\nengagement.\nThe debate around the MDG targets and the development\ngoals being formulated for the post-2015 period highlight the\nsearch for solutions to some of the most complex develop-\nment needs. This debate, however, also provides some\nopportunity and space, in part in association with the g7+ and\nother \"fragile\" and \"post\"-conflict states, to highlight the\nspecificity of their needs alongside their commitment to\naddressing the development deficit present within their\ncountries. Nascent local civil society, along with engaged\nglobal civil society, will play an important part in keeping\nthis debate alive and accountability in focus (The World We\nKey determinants that influence health outcomes.This narra-\ntive review highlights the poor health status and MNCH out-\ncomes in South Sudan, and draws attention to the need to\naddress the determinants of health if improved outcomes are\nto be achieved. Despite the many obstacles and challenges in\nSouth Sudan, peace and security, and addressing basic needs\nof nutrition, shelter, employment, and water and sanitation,\namong others, require attention. Gender equality, and the\neducation of girls and women, is vital and requires high lev-\nels of government commitment and leadership, as \"low rates\nof primary school completion and high gender disparities\npose enormous challenges to the development of South\nSudan\" (UNICEF, 2011). The South Sudan Household\nwith more years of schooling have both higher levels of\nknowledge about health and better health outcomes, as do\ntheir families.\nThe UN-led Consultation on Health in the Post-2015\nAgenda emphasised that the most disadvantaged, margin-\nalised, stigmatised, and hard-to-reach populations in all\ncountries must be prioritised, and equity must be made\nThis echoes broader calls for the more central role of rights\nwithin this agenda and the focus on reducing disparities and\ninequalities. That report also recognised that the goal of\nachieving universal health access must improve governance\nand access to decision making, as well as reduce those barri-\ners that relate to gender, income level, and geography (The\nWorld We Want, 2013). Improving upstream interventions\nmust complement those operating through health systems\nand services.\nImproved health system and services.This article brings\ntogether an extensive range of insights into health system\nfunctioning, performance, and challenges in South Sudan.\nOngoing conflict has a detrimental impact on health status\nand health system development, although considerable\nefforts are now underway to try and move beyond the \"post\"-\nconflict challenges and to consolidate nation building. A\nmajor element of this agenda is establishing and maintaining\neffective services operating within a broader health and\ndevelopment policy with long-term objectives. We have\nhighlighted the key challenges present, with an emphasis on\napplying what is already known to be effective in improving\nand securing MNCH outcomes for populations in LMICs.\nInforming policy with evidence (Bowen & Zwi, 2005)\nrequires acute sensitivity to local context. Applying well-\nestablished guidance and policies, building and working with\ntrustworthy and committed development partners, is likely to\nbe an essential component of this long-term effort.\nThe literature highlights the lack of skilled MNCH ser-\nvice providers as the greatest obstacle to achieving improved\nMNCH in South Sudan (Nelson et al., 2011), with the major-\nity of births still attended by family or friends rather than a\ntrained provider, and delays in seeking medical care contrib-\nuting to maternal deaths. Human resources for health are\ncritically low in South Sudan and require ongoing invest-\nment and commitment to building institutions. Fujita et al.\n(2013) examined the role of midwives in addressing high\nmaternal mortality in \"post\"-conflict Cambodia, and high-\nlighted the importance of political commitment, high level\nleadership, capable mid-level managers, and supportive\ndevelopment partners, if systems and institutions are to be\nbuilt on an effective and sustainable basis. These all apply to\nSouth Sudan.\nThe health and humanitarian situation in South Sudan,\nwith particular reference to MNCH, requires substantial\nfinancial and technical assistance from the international\ntechnical support should include establishing good gover-\nnance practices, creating a conducive environment for pooled\nfunding and programs, and establishing an accountability\nframework. Zwi (2011) argues that the seven \"sins\" associ-\nated with \"aid\" funding should be carefully avoided in rela-\ntion to development assistance for health; these include\nbeing patient, being more generous, and committing to lon-\nger-term building of institutions. Health systems and ser-\nvices should also take into account general lessons learned;\naccording to the Independent Evaluation of the MDTF-SS\n(2013), recommendations for successful projects included\nthe following:\na. strong national leadership;\nb. careful preparation, with realistic development objec-\ntives and implementation schedules;\nc. recognition of capacity constraints of national imple-\nmenting institutions;\nd. avoiding top-down approaches;\ne. integrating risk assessment and mitigation measures\ninto the design; and\nf. establishing a robust field implementation presence,\nwith management oversight, and regular engagement\nwith national counterparts.\nThe South Sudan health sector development plan (MoH &\nGoSS, 2011) notes the importance of monitoring, evaluation,\nand operational research. Enhancing our understanding of\ncontext--historical, cultural, political, economic, and devel-\nopmental--and of current capacity and its constraints will be\nimportant to assuring appropriate support and capability\nstrengthening.\nSeveral issues reflected in the Thematic Consultations for the\npost-2015 development agenda are acutely relevant to South\nSudan: the need to focus on health and related inequalities\nand disparities, the importance of recognising specific con-\ntexts such as conflict and fragility, the centrality of universal\nhealth coverage, and the associated right to health.\nInnovations on the ground and the role of civil society and\nresponsiveness to the community also receive attention.\nThe Thematic Consultation highlighted the importance of\ngender equality, accountability, and sustainability as guiding\nprinciples for the new development agenda. It argued that\nMDG health priorities would continue to feature in the post-\n2015 agenda given the importance of women's and children's\nhealth, HIV, and other infectious diseases especially in SSA\n(The World We Want, 2013). A DFID evaluation of the Basic\nServices Fund in South Sudan (Johnson, Ockelford, &\nPower, 2013) found that gender equity had not been suffi-\nciently highlighted; addressing this gap will be core to\nenhancing health and development. The post-2015 develop-\nment framework should be more \"people-centred and rights-\nbased . . . \" with goals and indicators with \"universal\nrelevance . . .\", while highlighting the importance of country\nConclusion\nThis narrative review has sought to contextualise the MNCH\nchallenges in \"post\"-conflict South Sudan. We have high-\nlighted ongoing constraints, barriers, and impediments to\nimproving health outcomes across the MNCH continuum.\nWe draw attention to these within the broad context of inter-\nnational community support to \"post\"-conflict states and\nhave highlighted opportunities arising as a result of South\nSudanese independence, commitment to the MDGs, debates\naround the post-2015 development agenda, and the emer-\ngence of the g7+, which allows South Sudan to engage with\nits peers and develop shared objectives and frameworks for\nnation building.\nWe emphasise a number of core challenges that remain--\nsecuring the peace and building macro-economic and politi-\ncal stability; addressing the determinants of health; and\nbuilding services and systems that are attuned to the realities\non the ground. Much remains to be done, however, and sus-\ntained, multi-layered, and dependable support are required if\nadvances for MNCH are to be achieved in South Sudan.\nAuthors' Note\nThis article was developed from an earlier piece of work by N.M.\nsupervised by A.Z.
