Knight, PhD\n Keywords: Affect--Age differences--Aging--Appraisals--Emotion\nThe relatively high level of well-being observed among\nolder adults has often puzzled researchers. At a time in\nlife when many objective indicators of functioning such\nas cognitive speed, memory performance, physical health,\nand social prestige decline, many older adults nonethe-\nless report higher levels of happiness and lower levels of\ndistress than people in their 20s (e.g., Stone, Schwartz,\nBroderick, & Deaton, 2010). To understand this \"paradox\nof aging,\" researchers often turn to explanations regarding\nhow people appraise their lives. Emotional reports, such\nas assessments of life satisfaction or contentment, include\nan evaluative component (Rojas & Veenhoven, 2013).\nBecause older adults often appraise and remember emo-\ntional stimuli less negatively than younger adults and\nincreasingly value emotion-related goals (see review by\nCharles & Carstensen, 2013), these factors may partially\nexplain the age differences that researchers have found in\nemotional well-being.\nThe model of strength and vulnerability integration\n(SAVI) posits that age differences in emotional experiences\nvary according to when an emotional experience is cap-\ntured, with age differences least pronounced when people\nare immediately exposed to stimuli and in response to events\nthat elicit high physiological arousal, and most pronounced\nwhen they are asked to remember previous emotional expe-\nriences over long time intervals (Charles, 2010). Memory for\nemotional experience is a reconstructive process that is often\nbased on current goals and appraisals (e.g., Levine, Lench,\n& Safer, 2009). Researchers have discussed the different fac-\ntors that contribute to reports of more immediate emotional\nexperiences versus retrospective reports of emotional experi-\nence (Robinson & Clore, 2002); whereas reports of more\nimmediate experience are based on experiential and contex-\ntual information, reports asking people to recall how they\nwere feeling in the past relies more on personal beliefs and\nemotion-related goals.Thus, both the immediate demands of\nan ongoing event and the reconstructive process used when\nthinking about prior emotions are posited to influence when\nage differences are most and least pronounced.\nAccording to socioemotional selectivity theory, older\nadults are motivated to focus on and remember more posi-\ntive aspects of their environment (Carstensen, 2006). As a\nresult, they typically fail to display a \"negativity bias\" often\nobserved among younger adults, instead remembering\nmore positive and less negative stimuli than their younger\ncounterparts (e.g., Charles, Mather, & Carstensen, 2003;\nsee reviews by Reed & Carstensen, 2012; Reed, Chan, &\nMikels, 2014). In contrast, emotions experienced closer to\nthe time they occur may be less susceptible to reconstruc-\ntive processes and instead rely on experiential and con-\ntextual cues (Robinson & Clore, 2002). To test whether\nage differences are more pronounced for reports assessing\nlonger temporal epochs, the current study examines age dif-\nferences in reports of well-being that required recollection\nacross different temporal periods--that is, the same day,\nthe prior week, and the prior month.\nReappraisals, Memory, and Age\nOlder adults often interpret negative situations more posi-\ntively and appraise their daily stressors as being less severe\nthan younger and middle-aged adults, despite there being\nno objective differences in experimenter-rated severity\n(Almeida & Horn, 2004). After watching videotapes that\ncaptured them discussing a conflict with their spouse, for\nexample, older adults rated the contentious behaviors of\ntheir spouse less negatively than objective observers (Story\net al., 2007). Older adults also interpret neutral stimuli\nmore positively than younger adults (van Reekum et al.,\n2011), and are less likely to ruminate about previous events\ncompared to younger adults (Nolen-Hoeksema & Aldao,\nMemory, like appraisal, is also less negative with age.\nFor example, after viewing positive, negative, and neutral\nimages, older adults recalled fewer negative relative to posi-\ntive images than did younger adults (Charles et al., 2003).\nResults from this study and others suggest that this pattern\nfollows a linear progression with age, such that older adults\nshow greater memory for positive versus negative stimuli\nthan middle-aged adults, and middle-aged adults show this\npositivity bias more so than younger adults. In addition to\nlaboratory stimuli, autobiographical incidents are remem-\nbered more positively among older adults than younger\nadults (e.g., Comblain, D'Argembeau, & Van der Linden,\nSocioemotional selectivity theory posits that emo-\ntional goals increase in importance with age, motivating\nolder adults to focus more on positive and less on nega-\ntive aspects of emotional experiences (Carstensen, 2006;\nCharles & Carstensen, 2013). Based on the premise that\nemotional goals are chronically activated to a greater\ndegree with age, socioemotional selectivity theory has been\nused to explain why older adults react more strongly to\npositive than negative stimuli on a neurological level (e.g.,\nMather et al., 2004), attend to more positive and less neg-\native information (Mather & Carstensen, 2005), appraise\ninformation less negatively (Charles & Carstensen, 2008),\nand remember information more positively than younger\nadults (Reed & Carstensen, 2012). Consistent with this\nview, older adults reliably report lower levels of negative\naffect than do younger adults when asked about the emo-\ntions they experience in general (e.g., Gross et al., 1997)\nor across the previous month (e.g., Mroczek & Kolarz,\nEmotions in the Moment\nOlder adults often report and remember experiences less\nnegatively and more positively than younger adults (e.g.,\nStone et al., 2010). These findings, however, contrast\nwith many laboratory studies examining age differences\nin immediate emotional reactions to negative stimuli.\nFor example, film clips of loss elicit greater levels of sad-\nness among older adults compared with younger adults\n(Kunzmann & Gruhn, 2005; Seider, Shiota, Whalen, &\nand film clips depicting scenes of justice elicit stronger\nemotional responses among older adults (Charles, 2005).\nIn addition, older and younger adults report similarly\nintense emotions when asked to relive previous negative\nexperiences (Levenson, Carstensen, Friesen, & Ekman,\n1991) and when asked to watch a short video clip elic-\niting disgust (Scheibe & Blanchard-Fields, 2009). These\nage differences in reactions are consistent with reports of\ncurrent emotional experience in more naturalistic settings:\nFor example, although older adults report less frequent\nnegative experiences, they report similar levels of inten-\nsity when these emotions are experienced in their daily\nlives (Carstensen, Pasupathi, Mayr, & Nesselroade, 2000;\nThe Current Study\nDiscrepant findings in the aging and emotion literature\nmay be due--at least in part--to the temporal nature of\nthe emotion assessed (Charles, 2010). The current study\nexamines age-graded trends in daily and longer-term retro-\nspective reports of affective well-being. Using a large sam-\nple of adults, who ranged from 25 to 74 years-old at the\nfirst wave of data collection (i.e., Burst 1), we were able\nto examine age differences in emotional experience across\na large segment of adulthood. By simultaneously examin-\ning two bursts of data collection (Burst 1 and then another\nburst 10 years apart) in one multi-level model, it is possible\nto examine this effect over time, as well as more clearly\nelucidate patterns of cross-sectional age differences and\nage-related changes. Examining both the cross-sectional\nand longitudinal differences simultaneously in the model\noffers a more parsimonious and innovative design than the\nuse of separate models to test each effect. We predict that\nage-graded benefits in affective well-being are larger for\nself-reports that rely on more distant retrospection (across\na month) compared to retrospection across a shorter\ntime span (across a week), and even more so than for\nself-reports of relatively proximal emotional states (end-\nof-day). We test this hypothesis regarding age differences\nusing the cross-sectional analyses because they capture a\nwide age range to detect these effects. Because we based our\nhypothesis on developmental theory, we test the hypothesis\nlongitudinally as well. Although we only can examine this\nhypothesis across 10 years, any trends in the correct direc-\ntion would strengthen the argument that these differences\nreflect a developmental change and not cohort or period\neffects.\nMethod\nParticipants\nold) completed the Midlife Development in the United\nStates (MIDUS) Survey, consisting of a telephone interview\nand mailed survey assessing multiple dimensions of psy-\nchosocial, physical, and financial well-being (Brim, Ryff, &\nents were contacted to participate in the National Study\n469 men; response rate = 83%) agreed to participate. The\nNSDE included short telephone interviews across eight\nconsecutive evenings and a longer final interview on the last\nday asking about their prior week. Data collection spanned\nan entire year. NSDE participants were more likely to be\nthe majority having at least a high school degree or the\nequivalent (66%). They were predominantly Caucasian\n(90%), with a small subsample of African Americans\n(6%); and the rest from other racial groups or declined to\nstate their ethnicity. MIDUS 1 and NSDE 1 were repeated\napproximately 10 years later (MIDUS 2 and NSDE 2). Of\nboth MIDUS and NSDE (retention rate = 53.4%). Reasons\nfor nonparticipation included refusal (53%), loss of con-\ntact (30%), deceased (13%), and no longer eligible (4%).\nNew respondents (n = 1229) increased the sample size to\nlow minority representation). NSDE 2 respondents aver-\nwere women. This second time point included 14,912 of\nthe current study, all people who participated in at least one\nburst of the study were included. All participants in NSDE\nI (n = 1,483) and the additional new participants at NSDE\n2 (n = 1,229), were included in analyses examining differ-\nences between their reports of daily, weekly, and monthly\nnegative affect. To investigate longitudinal change across\nburst measurements, we included negative affect measures\nfrom the second burst of data collection for those people\nwho participated at both times (n = 793).\nMeasures\nEmotional experience\nData from both MIDUS 1 and 2 and NSDE 1 and 2 were\nincluded in the analyses. Daily diary NSDE data were col-\nlected, on average, 6 months after the MIDUS survey was\nreturned. Given the interest in examining the same ques-\ntions across different temporal epochs, only measures that\nincluded identical items at all three time points at both data\ncollection bursts were included in these analyses. Below we\ndescribe the negative affect measure (each comprised of\none averaged score across six different negative emotions\nor emotion states) for the three varying temporal epochs\n(for the day, the prior week, and the prior month).\nDaily affect\nNegative affect was assessed in NSDE I using the Non-\nSpecific Psychological Distress Scale, which has been vali-\ndated in diverse populations (Kessler et al., 2002). This\nscale includes the average of six emotions or emotion\ndescriptors, including worthless, hopeless, nervous, restless,\nor fidgety, that everything was an effort, and so sad that\nnothing could cheer you up. Participants rated the extent\nto which they experienced each emotion that day using a\n5-point scale ranging from 1 (none of the time) to 5 (all of\nthe time). Additional positive and negative emotions were\nadded during NSDE 2, but for consistency, only the six\nemotions assessed during NSDE 1 were examined in the\ncurrent study.\nWeekly affect\nAt the end of the week after participants had reported their\ndaily experiences (including daily negative affect), they\nwere asked to reflect upon the past week and to endorse\nhow much of the time that week they experienced each of\nthe six emotions described previously, with these emotions\nMonthly affect\nMonthly average negative affect was calculated by asking\nrespondents in the MIDUS questionnaires how much of the\ntime during the past 30 days they experienced the same\nsix emotions or emotional descriptors mentioned above (\nAnalytic Strategy\nMultivariate multilevel models were employed to appropri-\nately represent the nested structure of the current data (i.e.,\nbursts nested within persons) using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS,\nCary, NC). We were specifically interested in comparing\nthe magnitude of age effects on each of the three NA vari-\nables, which required an extension of the traditional multi-\nlevel model to a multivariate framework (Mehta & Neale,\nthis model appears in Figure 1. Person represents the high-\nest level in this model. Bursts are then nested within each\nindividual and the NA variables are nested within each\nburst. More conventional approaches would require fitting\nthree separate MLMs for each negative affect variable (i.e.,\ndaily, weekly, and monthly) for each measurement burst.\nThe multivariate approach allowed us to explicitly model\nthe inter-correlations of the NA variables both within a\nburst as well as across bursts and persons. Additionally,\nby examining all three variables for both bursts simultane-\nously, we provided the strictest test of our hypotheses while\nlimiting Type I error. This model enabled us to simultane-\nously examine age differences in each of the NA measures,\nas well as compute a statistical test comparing age differ-\nences across the temporal windows. Using this method also\nallowed the explicit estimation of the between-person and\nwithin-person covariation among the three different meas-\nures of NA. The NA variables were modeled as a function\nof age at baseline, the amount of change from Burst 1 to\nBurst 2 (operationalized by a dichotomous variable to cap-\nture change in overall levels of affect within an individual\nacross bursts) as well as changes in each of the three nega-\ntive affect variables as a function of burst by means of the\nfollowing interactions: daily \u00d7 burst, weekly \u00d7 burst, and\nmonthly \u00d7 burst), and the age at baseline by burst interac-\ntion. Random effects were included at the person and burst\nlevels which allowed a unique intercept for every person at\neach burst. Individuals identifying as Caucasian and those\nwith at least a high school degree tended to be older (ps<\n.0018) and women tended to have significantly higher rat-\neffects of these variables and their interactions with time\nwere included as well as covariates (gender, education, and\nethnicity) in the model.\nResults\nResults are presented in Table 1. There was significant vari-\nation in the intercepts across bursts as well as individuals.\nWe estimated the within- and between-person correlations\namong the three measures of NA, which appear at the bot-\ntom of Table 1. At the within-person level, daily reports of\nNA and weekly reports of NA were strongly and signifi-\ncantly correlated. Monthly reports were significantly corre-\nlated with daily and weekly reporting windows though not\nas strongly. At the between-person level, all three measures\nof NA (daily, weekly, and monthly negative affect) were\nstrongly and significantly correlated.\nCross-Sectional Findings: Age and Negative\nAffect Across theTemporal Epochs\nOlder age was related to less NA for each of the three meas-\nurement reports,but the size of this effect varied across types\nof measurement. Using focused contrasts, we computed age\ndifferences in each NA variable using 1 SD below the mean\nto represent younger adults (~34 years old) and 1 SD above\nthe mean to represent older adults (~60 years old). We then\ncompared the magnitude of the age difference in each of\nthe NA reporting intervals. The hypothesized age differ-\nences, whereby older adults had lower NA scores than rela-\ntively younger adults, were significantly greater in monthly\np = .0039). Age differences in weekly reports were sig-\nnificantly greater than age differences in daily reports\nLongitudinal Findings: Age and Negative Affect\nAcross theTemporal Epochs\nWe had hypothesized that age differences showing lower\nNA scores with age would be reflected in decreased NA\nover time, but there was no main effect of time over the\nFigure 1. The model used to simultaneously estimate levels of negative affect.\n10-year interval at the average age. However, this was\nqualified by a time by age at baseline interaction for the\ndaily reports of NA. Findings indicated that the relatively\nyounger adults in this sample--those in their mid-30s and\nyounger--showed greater decreases in daily reports of NA\nover time than those who were older at baseline.\nCovariates: Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal\nFindings\nTo ensure that age differences were not confounded by\neducation level and to test that any observed age dif-\nferences were not qualified by gender or ethnicity, we\nincluded these variables as covariates in the models.\nWhen examining education level, gender and ethnicity,\nthere were significant effects of education on daily and\nmonthly reports of NA; individuals with lower educa-\ntion reported higher levels of NA compared to those with\nhigher education. Additionally, individuals with higher\nlevels of education showed significant decreases in daily\nreports of NA over time. Compared with women, men\nreported significantly lower NA on monthly reports and\nCaucasians reported significantly lower monthly NA\ncompared with non-Caucasians. Neither gender nor eth-\nnicity interacted with time, and age differences were simi-\nlar across people varying according to ethnicity, gender,\nand education level.\nDiscussion\nThe current study examined how emotional experiences\nvary by age among a large sample of adults. Similar to\nfindings converging from a growing body of research, older\nage was related to significantly lower levels of negative\naffect in all analyses. The strength of these age differences,\nhowever, varied according to the temporal epoch captured\nby each measure. As hypothesized, age differences in emo-\ntional well-being were more pronounced for emotional\nassessments of increasingly longer temporal epochs, such\nthat age-graded benefits were larger for monthly assess-\nments than weekly assessments, which, in turn, were larger\nthan daily assessments.\nThis pattern helps to reconcile some inconsistent find-\nings from previous literature. Cross-sectional studies of\nglobal negative affect reports, such as how people feel \"in\ngeneral\" or during the past 30 days, consistently show age-\nrelated decreases across middle-age and into adulthood\n(e.g., Kobau, Safran, Zack, Moriarty, & Chapman, 2004;\nsettings, however, findings vary.When exposed to emotional\nstimuli or recalling upsetting experiences, older adults'\nreports of negative affect are sometimes lower (e.g., Charles\n& Carstensen, 2008), sometimes higher (e.g., Charles,\nlar to those of younger adults (e.g., Levenson et al., 1991).\nThe contrast between the discrepant laboratory findings\nTable 1.

Education reference category was high school diploma or greater, gender reference\ncategory women, ethnicity reference category was non-White.\nand the more consistent findings for global assessments\nsuggests that age differences for more immediate, reactive\nexperiences are less robust than responses that rely on more\nretrospective reports of emotional experience.\nExplaining theTemporal Recall Pattern\nSAVI posits that when remembering an event or consider-\ning how they feel \"in general,\" people often reappraise the\nsituation less negatively, a strategy older adults use more\nfrequently and arguably more effectively than younger\nadults (Charles, 2010). Closer to the time of the negative\nexperience, age differences in emotional experience should\nnot be apparent and may even reverse in direction. Yet,\nwe found age-related reductions in reports of negative\naffect across all temporal frames in the current study. At\nfirst glimpse, this result runs counter to SAVI's prediction.\nOne reason may lie in how we assessed the most proxi-\nmal measure. Daily--not momentary--affect was assessed.\nThe emotion-eliciting event could have happened up to\nhr prior to when daily NA was assessed, so it is likely\nthat age-related differences in appraisals may have already\noccurred.\nIn a study examining momentary assessments, par-\nticipants reported their current affective state and experi-\nence of stressors throughout the day (Scott, Sliwinski, &\nBlanchard-Fields, 2013). Immediately following stressor\nexposure, older adults reported less of an increase in NA\nthan did younger adults. After adjusting for levels of global\nperceived stress, the age differences in immediate reports of\nNA disappeared, however, indicating that ongoing, stress-\nful situations may have hindered older adults' ability to\ncope with an acute stressor. Thus, only when older adults\nperceived their life as less stressful were age differences\nobserved. Moreover, the age advantage did not extend\nto stressor severity--all adults were just as affected by\nincreases in stressor severity (Scott et al., 2013).\nAnother study showed that age was related to lower\nlevels of NA when people reported experiencing a num-\nber of stressors across their week (stressor pile-up), but\nnot in their reactivity to more immediate daily stressors\n(Schilling & Diehl, 2014). The authors concluded that emo-\ntion regulation skills may have helped older adults distance\nthemselves from previous stressors, but were unable to be\nemployed for more immediate stressors. Similarly, another\nstudy found that when older adults are preoccupied by a\nhassle--and therefore unable to effectively engage in emo-\ntion regulation strategies--they experience higher levels\nof deactivating (e.g., sadness, disappointment) negative\nemotions than younger adults (Wrzus, Luong, Wagner, &\nImportance ofThis Finding to Current Literature\nand Future Directions\nThese findings have potential implications for the field.\nFirst, the majority of cross-sectional studies examining age\nand emotion find that older age is related to lower levels of\nnegative affect. The majority of studies also examine more\nglobal levels of well-being. Understanding that age differ-\nences vary based on how and when these questions are\nasked may help to provide a more realistic picture of age\ndifferences in emotional experience. Older adults may have\nless negative reappraisals over time, but their experiences\nfor more proximal reports may be more similar to younger\nadults than what may be construed from prior knowledge.\nThese findings may also have implications for study-\ning the interrelationships among aging, emotional expe-\nrience, and health outcomes in the future. A small but\nFigure 2. Age differences in emotional experience across the three different temporal epochs.\ngrowing body of research suggests that these different\nmeasures of affective experience are related to different\noutcomes. For example, several studies find that momen-\ntary assessments of emotional experience predict physical\nhealth outcomes more strongly than global measures of\nemotional experience, and more retrospective reports are\nmore strongly related to decision-making (see review by\nConner & Barrett, 2012). Moreover, research indicates\nthat these associations may vary according to age. One\nstudy, for example, found that although self-reported\nemotion (a measure of anger expression) was not asso-\nciated with health outcomes for younger adults, it was\nassociated with metabolic syndrome among the older\nadults in the sample (Boylan & Ryff, 2015). It is unclear\nat this time whether associations between other aspects\nof emotional experience with cognitive and health-related\nprocesses are invariant with age. Understanding whether\nage differences exist in different types of emotion reports\nis another step towards understanding how the health-\nemotion associations may vary, or not, across different\nage groups. Future studies examining how health-related\noutcomes relate to emotions that are assessed the moment\nthey are experienced, versus how emotions are recalled\nusing more global reports, will inform our knowledge of\nhow these related but different constructs are associated\nwith health-related outcomes, and how these associations\nvary with age.\nLongitudinal Versus Cross-Sectional Findings\nThe longitudinal findings did not reflect the cross-sectional\nfindings. Average levels of weekly and monthly negative\naffect were not significantly different across the 10-year\nperiod. For daily NA, however, the youngest adults in the\ndecreases across time, but the oldest half of the sam-\nple--those in their fifties and older, showed no significant\nchange during the same time period. The current findings\nvary from a prior study that examined a slightly older age\nrange (45\u00ad97) and found a decrease in overall levels of NA\n(asking participants about their experiences over the previ-\nous month) when assessed over a 10-year period for peo-\nple under the age of 70, but an increase for people over\nfindings are consistent, however, with two other longitu-\ndinal studies asking about negative affect in slightly differ-\nent ways. In one longitudinal study, age-related decreases\nacross 20 years were larger for younger and middle-aged\nadults than older adults. For people who started the study\nin their early 60s, decreases in negative affect were very\nsmall--about an estimated half-point across twenty years,\nor about .25 of a point across 10 years (Charles, Reynolds,\n& Gatz, 2001). In another longitudinal study of daily emo-\ntional experience across 10 years, age-related increases in\ndaily positive emotional experience (a combination of posi-\ntive and negative emotion reports) was evident only among\nwho began the study at age 64 or older remained stable in\ntheir emotional experience. In the current study, age dif-\nferences in reported daily negative affect did decrease over\ntime among the younger participants in the current sample\nbut not the older participants.\nPossible reasons for decreases in daily negative affect in\nyounger and middle-adulthood, but not older adulthood,\ncould be that people are gaining experience in emotion\nregulation strategies during this earlier period of life. When\nthey reach older ages, however, they have a higher prob-\nability or experiencing challenges to their emotional well-\nbeing, such as a chronic physical health conditions that\nmay limit functional abilities, financial stressors resulting\nfrom decreased income after retirement, or loss of people\nwho provide them with a sense of belonging. Another pos-\nsibility is that negative affect levels may reach a floor effect,\ngiven that most people report low levels of negative affect.\nA life without the experience of negative affect, whether\nthis negative affect stems from compassion over the sor-\nrows of others, the signal of a health condition that needs\nattention, or information necessary to correct an inequality\nor mistreatment, may not only be unfeasible, but also mala-\ndaptive for a healthy lifestyle. Finally, the terminal decline\nof life is related to decreases in well-being constructs (e.g.,\nInfurna et al., 2014), so we would not expect negative affect\nto continue to decrease during this dying process.\nThe lack of longitudinal findings in the weekly and\nmonthly reports may indicate that this phenomenon is\na cohort effect, such that people develop schemas about\nemotions early in life that are primed when they are asked\nabout emotions across longer periods of time. Using this\nexplanation, people born earlier in the 20th century were\npresumably taught different appraisal processes that shape\ntheir emotional experiences compared to those taught to\nthe people in successively later-born cohorts. When asking\npeople to reconstruct emotional experience for longer tem-\nporal periods (asking about affect across a week or month),\npeople use their beliefs about emotions and other seman-\ntic knowledge when recalling this experience than they do\nfor more immediate or more temporal (daily) emotional\nexperiences (e.g., Robinson & Clore, 2002). Social desir-\nability may also play a role for cohort effects, such that\nolder adults may feel greater pressure to respond in socially\ndesirable ways that may be more primed when people are\nasked about emotions experienced over longer periods of\ntime (e.g., Soubelet & Salthouse, 2011). Another possibility\nis that changes do occur, but these changes are small (e.g.,\nPinquart, 2001) and take more than a decade to become\nsignificantly different. Previous cross-sectional analyses, for\nexample, examined differences observed across people rep-\nresenting a 50-year range, not one of 10 years (see review\nIn addition, historical effects may be at work. At\nthe time of the second data collection, the United States\nshared in the global economic crisis, the wars in Iraq and\nAfghanistan were underway, and terrorism became a pub-\nlic concern. Given that the first burst of data collection\noccurred during a time of economic prosperity, well-funded\nand large retirement portfolios, and little concern about the\nnation's vulnerability to terrorism, the stability in reports of\nnegative affect may partly be due to the major sociopoliti-\ncal changes that have reshaped our nation.\nLimitations and Conclusion\nThe current study included a predominantly Caucasian sam-\nple from the United States. If cohort and historical effects\nplayed a role in these findings, examining adults from other\ncultures and ethnicities may reveal very different profiles.\nIn addition, longitudinal analyses based on two time points\noffer less reliability than studies including more time points,\nand prevents examinations of nonlinear effects. In addition,\nnegative affect was defined with questions that focused on\nsymptoms of depression and anxiety, and more expansive\nmeasures that included additional emotional experiences\n(e.g., anger, positive emotions), would offer a more expan-\nsive understanding of the emotional lives of adults, and\nhow they vary depending on the temporal epoch examined.\nMoreover, the weekly and daily questions were collected\nduring the same time period, but monthly recall was col-\nlected, on average, 6 months earlier. It is unclear how the\noverlap, or lack thereof, may influence the findings. Asking\npeople about their emotional experiences every night may\ninfluence their weekly recall, and this additional memory\naid may serve to minimize age differences in weekly affec-\ntive reports. As a result, findings may be stronger if the daily\nand weekly reports were not assessed in the same week.\nFinally, the most stringent test of SAVI would be to com-\npare emotional experiences across age groups immediately\nfollowing an emotion-eliciting event and during subsequent\nrecollections of the event (e.g., same day, after 1 week, after\n1 month). SAVI emphasizes the importance of physiological\narousal, so a measure of emotional intensity near the time\nof an emotion-eliciting event would a more stringent test\nof our predictions. In the current study, participants were\nasked about the frequency of their emotions, not the inten-\nsity, during the previous 24\nhr (often completed the inter-\nview at night asking about the events of the day), which, as\nstated previously, likely resulted in reconstructive processes\noccurring, thereby decreasing the likelihood that we would\nfind support for SAVI. Yet, even with these limitations, age\ndifferences in daily recall of negative emotions were smaller\nthan recall of weekly emotions which, in turn, were smaller\nthan recall of monthly negative emotions. Still, further, more\nstringent tests of SAVI are warranted, with affect measured\nimmediately following the event and emotions regarding the\nevent assessed at increasingly longer time frames. Despite\nthese limitations, however, the current study is one of the\nfirst to offer insight into how different types of affect assess-\nments yield altered patterns of age differences. By holding\nthe type of emotion consistent across the temporal epoch\nand by studying these questions within the same individual,\nproblems that arise as a function of sampling biases or dif-\nferent emotions asked were eliminated.\nThe current study revealed that age is related to lower lev-\nels of negative affect, but that this effect is more pronounced\nfor increasingly longer temporal epochs. Assessing emotions\nacross different intervals, then, yield different portrayals of\nthe degree to which older adults report less negative affect\nthan younger adults. Given that different temporal assess-\nments are hypothesized to share different associations with\ncognitive and health-related outcomes, these findings high-\nlight the need to think carefully before selecting a measure of\nwell-being, and to be cognizant of the fact that some types\nof emotional experience are more influenced by age-related\nfactors than others. Researchers and clinicians alike may\ntherefore need to be aware of these differences when asking\npeople about their emotional experiences.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health:\nNational Institute of Aging by grants awarded to Susan Charles\nReferences\nAlmeida, D.
