Results are compared with previously published findings on\nMain Outcome Measure Insurance coverage for adolescents.\nResults An estimated 12.2% of adolescents were uninsured in 2002, which is a de-\nexpansion of public coverage and is concentrated among children in poor (100% of\nthe federal poverty level) and near-poor (100%-199% of the federal poverty level)\nfamilies. A substantial decrease in the differences between poor and higher-income\ngroups occurred between 1995 and 2002 due to gains in coverage for adolescents in\npoor and near-poor families and losses in coverage among those in middle- and upper-\nincome families (200% of the federal poverty level). Specifically, the proportion of\nin 2002 (P.001). The proportion of adolescents in near-poor families without cov-\nportion of adolescents in middle- and higher-income families without insurance in-\nthe private market declined (P.001).\nConclusions A modest but significant reduction in the percentage of adolescents\nwithout insurance has occurred since 1995, largely as a result of expansions in public\ncoverage. An even larger reduction in the proportion of adolescents without cover-\nage would have occurred, if not for a reduction in private coverage for adolescents in\nmiddle- and higher-income families.\nstates to phase in Medicaid coverage for\npoor children born after September 30,\n18 years with family incomes up to\never, many states opted to extend cov-\nerage for adolescents sooner than re-\nquired.

We used the ques-\ntions on health insurance contained in\nthe family questionnaire to determine\ninsurance status for adolescents.

Adolescents with no\ncoverage from these sources were clas-\nsified as uninsured. Adolescents with\nunknown insurance status (n=123)\nwere excluded from the insurance com-\nparisons. It should be noted that by de-\nfining insurance status based on cov-\nerage at the time of the interview, a\nsomewhat higher proportion of ado-\nlescents are classified as insured in the\nNHIS compared with surveys in which\na full year of coverage is used as the cri-\nterion for establishing insurance sta-\ntus.

A much smaller propor-\ntion of adolescents (1.3%) had both pri-\nvate and public insurance coverage. The\nremaining 12.2% of adolescents had no\nhealth insurance coverage at all.\nCharacteristics of Insured\nand Uninsured Adolescents\nSubstantial differences in coverage were\nfound according to demographic and\nsocioeconomic characteristics of ado-\nlescents and their families (Table 1).\nmore likely to be uninsured than\nence primarily attributable to the higher\nprevalence of public health insurance\namong younger adolescents.

In addition, there are less obvious\ncorrelations between some of the so-\ncioeconomic and demographic vari-\nables. For example, incomes of 2-par-\nent families are generally higher than\nthose in single-parent families; conse-\nquently, some of the differences shown\nin Table 1 by family structure may be\nexplained by differences in family in-\ncome. To adjust for such confound-\ning, we conducted a multivariate analy-\nsis of predictors of insurance coverage\namong adolescents (TABLE 2).\nA substantial degree of confounding\nappears to be present as indicated by the\nattenuated effect sizes in comparison\nwith the bivariate findings presented in\nTable 1.

Experts have of-\nfered a number of explanations for the\ndecline in availability of private insur-\nance coverage. First, some portion of\nthe decline appears to be attributable\nto crowd out or the substitution of newly\navailable public coverage for existing\nHowever, the extent to which crowd out\nexplains the decline in private cover-\nage remains unclear and controver-\nsial.

Adolescents\nare a particularly challenging popula-\ntion to attract, enroll, and retain.31\nNewly eligible adolescents also may be\ndifficult to enroll because they tradi-\ntionally have fewer contacts with health\ncare clinicians than younger children.\nMoreover, SCHIP is still a relatively new\nprogram. Even in a well-established\nprogram like Medicaid, large numbers\nof eligible children and adolescents fail\nOur findings indicate that sizable\nregional differences exist in adoles-\ncent health insurance coverage, with\nthe Western and Southern regions\nlagging behind the Northeastern and\nMidwestern regions of the country.\nAlthough the regional differences\nthey demonstrate continuing prob-\nlems of insurance access for adoles-\ncents residing in the South and West.\nThe NHIS sample is not large enough\nto examine state-level differences as\naverage, so we are limited in making\nfurther comment.\nThere are 3 aspects of our data that\nlimit the precision of our estimates.\nFirst, as indicated previously, 17- and\n18-year-olds are permitted to respond\nfor themselves in the NHIS. Those self-\nrespondents may be less knowledge-\nable about their health insurance\nstatus than the adult respondents (prin-\ncipally parents) who respond on be-\nhalf of adolescents younger than age 17\nyears. However, any biases attribut-\nable to self-reports are likely to be small\nbecause the proportion of the sample\nused in our study that responded for\nthemselves was less than 1.7%. Sec-\nond, although the NHIS is designed to\nprovide nationally representative esti-\nmates, adolescents living outside of\nhouseholds, including incarcerated,\nhomeless, and institutionalized adoles-\ncents, are excluded from the survey.\nUndocumented persons are treated no\ndifferently than others, although their\nresponse rates are likely to be lower\nthan for documented persons because\nthis is a government-sponsored sur-\nvey. Third, about 28% of NHIS respon-\ndents had missing values for poverty\nstatus in the survey. For this reason, we\nhave not reported estimated numbers\nof poor and nonpoor adolescents with\ninsurance coverage, but focused in-\nstead on reporting proportions within\neach poverty category with coverage.\nIn conclusion, this study has demon-\nstrated an overall reduction in the size\nof the uninsured adolescent popula-\ntion, with the gains being concentrated\nwithinthelow-incomepopulation.These\nimprovementsmaynotpersistifstateand\nfederaldeficitscontinuetoincrease.Cur-\nrently, some states are cutting back their\nMedicaid and SCHIP programs as state\nbudgets tighten due to increasing defi-\ncits.33 President Bush's proposal to give\nstates greater power in setting rules for\nMedicaid and SCHIP eligibility, if imple-\nmented,couldleadtodecrementsincov-\nerage. Given that the SCHIP and Medi-\ncaid expansions have accomplished one\nof their primary goals--increasing cov-\nerage for families in need--careful lon-\ngitudinal monitoring of the effects of\nchanging policies is needed.\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Newacheck, as principal in-\nvestigator, had full access to the data and takes re-\nsponsibility for the integrity of the data and the ac-\ncuracy of the data analysis.\nStudy concept and design: Newacheck, Park, Brindis,\nIrwin.\nAcquisition of data: Newacheck, Biehl.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Newacheck, Biehl.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Newacheck, Park, Biehl.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Park, Brindis, Irwin.\nStatistical expertise: Newacheck, Biehl.\nObtained funding: Newacheck, Park, Brindis, Irwin.\nSupervision: Newacheck.\nFunding/Support: This study was supported by grant\n2077 from the William T.
