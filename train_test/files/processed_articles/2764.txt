An Internet search engine asked to look for \u00abmass\nexecution\u00bb will instantly find several thousand references, from a book about America's\nexecution of seven German prisoners of war with the phrase in its subtitle, to reports about\nmass executions of millions of persons5. Like mass murder or serial murder, it may be easier\nto understand the general idea than to come up with a working definition suitable for statistical\nanalysis. Mass legal execution is here defined as the execution of four or more persons for\nthe same criminal incident by government entities following some form of trial. Over time, of\ncourse, what constituted a trial and due process varied, with fairness varying even within the\nsame time periods and in the same colonies or states.\n4 The questions that remain are how frequent were mass legal executions in the United States\nduring its history from colonial times on, and what a study of those executions reveals that more\ngeneral studies about capital punishment will not. Ordinary executions reveal what crimes\nwere being committed for which the death penalty was the normal, and accepted, sentence,\nand the sorts of persons \u00ad minorities, literal or societal outsiders \u00ad on whom such sentences\nwere most likely to have been imposed. A decline in the number of persons executed singly\nfor burglary or robbery as the eighteenth century progressed suggests that capital punishment\nwas ceasing to be an accepted punishment for property related crimes, with juries declining to\nconvict or governors eager to commute death sentences for those crimes, even before the law\nremoved them from the list of capital offenses6.\n5 The change in types of crimes subject to ordinary capital punishment certainly shows change.\nThrough the eighteenth century, only three-eighths of those executed were convicted of\nmurder; it accounted for an increasing percentage of those executed in the nineteenth century,\nover 90% of those executed during the first two-thirds of the twentieth century, and, for\nseveral decades now, the only crime for which criminals are executed. But murder was\nthe primary offense for only 8% of those executed in groups of four or more through the\n   , Vol. 8, n\u00b02 | 2004\neighteenth century7. There were three general types of behavior that led to mass executions.\nThe first involved actions that were seen as such threats to the social order as to be sanctioned\nby both legal and extra legal execution, the latter with no fear of government punishment\nof the executioners. For these threats, executions following due process were generally\noutnumbered by less formal mass killings. In antebellum America, the three most common\ninstances involved insurrections, uprisings, and treason or other war crimes \u00ad or the fear\nof such potential actions \u00ad by slaves, Indians, and supporters of the enemy. Less common\nwere some perceived threats from religious and ethnic minorities, as well as from ordinary\ncriminals prior to effective organization of courts8. For some of those offenders, mass legal\nexecutions sometimes had benefits for the victim beyond the perfunctory shriving time allowed\ncondemned slaves. The most offensive actions by slaves were punished by hideous tortures\nwithout pretense of trials9. For this type of offense, just as criminologists often prefer to\nstudy homicide because that crime is more consistently reported than other offenses, so legal\nexecutions may provide the best hard data on matters of such concern to society as to be\nthought worthy of the ultimate sanction.\n6 The second type of offenses were actions seen as generally group threats to organized society,\nbut only punished by organized society. The most prominent example was a single American\nepisode of witchcraft, but piracy was a more common example. The final category involved\noffenses of no apparent concern to the public at large, but of overriding concern to its leaders,\nwho often thought anything short of mass execution would be an inadequate deterrent. Military\nleaders periodically found the threat of desertion or mutiny to require exemplary executions\nto restore proper discipline.\n7 Capital punishment itself probably better indicated not just the crimes but the criminals society\nmost feared. For example, when blacks and whites were both convicted in connection with\nslave insurrections, blacks \u00ad slave or free \u00ad were generally subject to capital punishment while\nwhites were subject to corporal punishment and expulsion10. Similarly, blacks were much more\nlikely to be executed for homicide alone, whereas whites were more likely hanged only for\nwhat would now be described as aggravated homicide: murder in the course of another felony\nsuch as robbery or rape11. There were also differences in the way criminals were treated after\nsentencing. For example, from the seventeenth on into the early nineteenth century, persons\ncondemned to die were often given two weeks or more to prepare their souls to meet their\nmaker, but delays were generally relatively short for those executed in mass executions.\n8 Mass executions could, however, serve as a bellwether of the crimes most likely to continue to\nbe acceptable as capital offenses. From the seventeenth on early into the nineteenth centuries,\nthe North may have more severely punished moral offenses and the South property offenses,\nbut the last mass legal executions for such offenses occurred near the end of the seventeenth\ncentury in the North and early in the eighteenth century in the South, a century before they\nceased to be capital offenses. Later in the eighteenth and into the nineteenth centuries, when\ncapital punishment remained acceptable for civilians primarily just for violent crimes, mass\nexecutions occurred only for fatal offenses in the North and for fatal offenses plus slave revolts\nin the South. Finally, although it took until the final third of the twentieth century for capital\npunishment to be limited to aggravated murder, such a limitation had occurred, at least for\nCaucasian mass executions, by the final third of the nineteenth century12. Offenses that failed\nto lead to mass executions suggested crimes that eventually would cease to be acceptable for\nany executions, or else ceased to occur as crimes.\n9 In addition to indicating popular fears or concerns, others factors also affected trends in the\nnumbers of mass executions over time. What constituted a capital offense varied over time,\nfrom place to place within the same period, or was dependent upon status. By the end of\nthe eighteenth century, for example, the South had many more capital property offenses than\nthe North, and felonies punishable with imprisonment of whites were capital offenses when\ncommitted by blacks, especially if they were slaves13. Even within a region, the time and\nplace of executions for slave revolts indicated not simply general, but localized, fears of\n   , Vol. 8, n\u00b02 | 2004\n10 Similarly, the extent of adversarial process varied over time and circumstance, with\nsubstantially less of an adversarial process for all trials before the late eighteenth century, and\nthen still less due process afforded blacks and Indians than whites, and with lower levels of due\nprocess for military trials than in civilian courts. This study focuses on executions following\ndue process of groups convicted for the same offense rather than just a common execution date\nand place, with some thoughts on why mass legal executions changed in nature and number\nin postbellum America.\nMethod\n11 For several reasons, there is no complete record of mass legal executions in the United States.\nFirst, this has been an area that has not been researched by others. Specific instances may\nbe famous and have been the focus of intense scholarship (e.g., the Salem witch trials, the\nLincoln assassination trial), but this is the first attempt to begin to quantify and compare them.\nSecond, many instances of mass execution may have been lost to history. Third, even defining\nmass legal execution is no simple task; it is one of several terms or concepts for which the\ntemptation is to repeat what American Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart substituted for a\nprecise definition of obscenity: \u00abI know it when I see it.\u00bb\n12 To impose a precise definition on a less precise concept, mass legal execution is here defined\nas the execution, by duly constituted authorities following some form of trial, of four or more\npersons for the same criminal incident, in what is now the United States (excluding territories).\nThis definition of \u00abmass\u00bb was fashioned after a fairly common criminological definition for\nmass murder as the criminal killing of four or more persons; this number was recently also\nused for a study of mass lynching15. A complicating factor is defining \u00abincident\u00bb since the\nsame fears that led to mass executions might involve a variety of specific charges, particularly\nwhere different evidence might exist as to the existence of witchcraft or a conspiracy of slaves\nto revolt. A cursory look at incidents in New York and nationally suggests that reducing the\nnumber executed from four to three \u00ad another popular number for criminological studies of\nmass murder \u00ad would increase the number of such executions but not change the sorts of crimes\nthus punished16. Reducing the number to two would, like single executions, tell more about\nthe sorts of crimes and criminals subjected to capital punishment \u00ad that is, the willingness of\nsociety to use capital punishment \u00ad but rarely anything more. Executions by Indians of persons\nof European, African, or Asian descent are excluded regardless of whether tribal due process\nwas observed, as are war related summary executions most commonly found in wars involving\nvarious Indian tribes and explorers and colonists from England, Spain, and France17.\n13 One complicating factor for this definition is determining what constitutes due process of law.\nIt is fairly clear that ordinary lynchings would not fall within this definition, even though\nsome lynchings included at least the pretense of a trial. Yet some vigilance committees,\nacting regarding slave revolts and ordinary crimes, operated with more serious trials before\nexecuting those condemned than some judicial trials for slave revolts. For some executions,\nparticularly military ones, it is not totally clear which executions were summary or followed\ncourts martial, whether any court martial seriously considered evidence or simply ordered\nsummary executions, or, for that matter, how many of those executed for the same incident had\nhearings and how many did not. A good example of such confusion, at least in reports, would\nbe the termination of Bacon's Rebellion in 1676 Virginia, where the total number executed was\nprobably 23, with some clearly summary executions, some possibly following courts martial,\nhowever seriously held, and some civil trials18.\n14 In most studies dealing historically with capital punishment in America, any discussion of\nmass executions has been anecdotal or not really mentioned at all. Such executions are rarely\nfeatured in general studies of capital punishment in America, or in those works dealing only\nwith limited aspects of capital punishment, such as the executions of assassins or military\nexecutions19. The few published studies of capital punishment in different states or territories\nhave reports of mass executions in Pennsylvania and in New York, included in lists of everyone\nknown to have been legally executed in those two states, and even there, mass executions were\nrare and constituted a small minority20.\n   , Vol. 8, n\u00b02 | 2004\n15 The major exception is in Herbert Aptheker's study of slave uprisings, where he noted the\npunishments meted out when the uprisings were put down, with some effort to distinguish\nbetween those executed by the authorities and those simply killed by either private parties\nor military or militia bodies. It is not certain that he was always able to make the distinction\naccurately, with flaws generally (but not invariably) exaggerating rather than minimizing the\nnumber lawfully executed. It is also not clear that the punishments were for actual conspiracies\nor revolts, or because of unfounded fears of possible revolt. As an indication of social fear,\nhowever, the reality of the conspiracy is not relevant21.\n16 After reviewing the literature, the next step was to examine the list, compiled by M. Watt\nEspy, Jr., of legal executions from colonial times to the present. That list currently includes\nalmost 19 000 executions, but there is access to only three fourths of it, generally referred\nto as the Espy File; that portion is available on-line from the Inter-university Consortium\nfor Political and Social Research, and it is not always reliable because of coding errors. For\nexample, the black slaves executed for a revolt in New York City in 1712 are all recorded as\nCaucasians22. Also, the data are incomplete23. This might be partly because, until the 1820s\nand 1830s, newspapers rarely reported executions, which might be covered by broadsides\ninstead, which are less likely to have survived to the present. Official local records have\noften disappeared in numerous courthouse fires, accidental and deliberate. For example, Philip\nSchwarz can document the death sentence for four slaves among a larger group charged with\n\u00abstealing themselves\u00bb and a boat in an escape attempt, but the records of what followed are\nmissing.24 Newspaper coverage improved when executions changed from public areas to the\nprivacy of prison yards25. In addition, colonial records were often better at recording sentences\nof death than whether those sentences were carried out; commutations were fairly common\nin antebellum America26. Overall, sources differ in the numbers of persons executed for the\nsame incident, their ethnicity, the date of execution, and the offense for which persons were\nexecuted. For slave executions, variation in date is sometimes explainable by Espy's use of the\ndate compensation was paid to the slaves' owners rather than the actual execution date, since\ncompensation established greater certainty that a recorded death sentence was implemented.\n17 In addition to ordinary problems, ideology affects some of the data. With slave owners fearing\nslave revolt, they may have seen activity as revolt where it had not actually occurred, but slave\nowners also thought it best to minimize incidents of possible revolt both to avoid inspiring\nadditional revolts and to preserve the image of satisfied slaves. One result was to both perceive\nand punish possible revolt as simply murder. Herbert Aptheker, on the other hand, had his own\nideological bias leading him to see uprising of the oppressed even where it may just have been\nmurder. At the time of his initial research, the Communist Party, in which he was an active\nmember, was tying itself to civil rights issues, and finding slave revolts helped both to show\nthat blacks were not so docile as southerners pretended, and to encourage the idea of nascent\nrevolutionary activity against an oppressive capitalist system. Similarly, the prominent Samuel\nSewall's diary described killings by Indians in the Massachusetts Bay colony, followed by\nan execution of several of them27. The Indians were involved in King Philip's war, but the\ncolonists viewed many Indian conflicts as crimes, with trial and execution28.\n18 Espy's data are by no means definitive, and some other data sources have different numbers\nof persons executed at the same time and place for the same offense. In addition to\nincompleteness, inconsistencies, and coding errors, there are two minor problems with the\nEspy data, making them suggestive but insufficient. First, listings alone cannot tell whether\nan offense qualifies as a mass execution for two reasons: a listing by dates might suggest\nthat executions on the same date are related when they may not be, and the Espy File would\nfail to call attention to executions of persons for the same criminal incident that are spread\nout over time. The first was a problem primarily in the earlier years of the republic and prior\ncolonial times, particularly in northern urban areas, where executions were done in groups\neven if the individuals had nothing in common beyond the day they died. A listing that four\npersons were executed for murder on a particular day in Philadelphia, for example, does not\nmean that they were involved in the same murder29. This tendency is a potential problem\n   , Vol. 8, n\u00b02 | 2004\nprimarily for mass executions for murder. It did not exist to the same extent in southern\ndealings with blacks, where there was less tendency to have regular hanging days or to be\nconcerned about leaving sufficient shriving time. If four or more slaves were executed at the\nsame time for the same offense in a rural county, particularly if they were owned by the same\nperson, it is likely that it was a mass execution30. Nor did the problem occur with other offenses\nmore common in antebellum mass executions than ordinary executions. Pirates, witches, and\nIndians, for example, were not executed with criminals associated with different criminal\nincidents. Even for murder, the problem was minimized in most jurisdictions by the goal of\nstaging the execution to maximize its deterrent value, often hanging the offender near the scene\n19 The second problem, rare before 1866, is that persons might be executed for the same offense\nbut on different dates, with the common tie lacking in broad listings of executions. Two\nantebellum examples would be that using a single date alone would separate the three groups\nand two individuals executed for witchcraft in Salem and would separate John Brown from\nthe execution of most of his co-conspirators in the Harpers Ferry raid, who were executed two\nweeks later, and from an additional pair executed three months later32.\n20 Various military sources and books about America's wars on American soil were used to find\nmilitary executions; such instances are not systematically included in the Espy File, which\nis devoted to executions \u00abunder civil authority\u00bb (although he certainly lists some executions\nfor desertion). A variety of sources, especially Aptheker's study of slave uprisings, but also\ngeneral books on capital punishment, the Internet, and other sources, also have been used to\nattempt to find pre Civil War era legal executions. It would appear that of the nearly 20 000\nlegal executions in what is now the United States from the seventeenth century to the present,\napproximately 8% of those executed were involved in mass executions as here defined; mass\nexecutions accounted for over a quarter of those executed before the end of the Civil War\nand just 3% of those executed during the following century. As with all such percentages\nmentioned, this is approximate, since the complete list compiled by Espy has not been made\npublic. A list of known pre 1866 mass legal executions is appended. One thing the data clearly\nindicate is that there was a dramatic change in the nature of mass legal executions following\nthe conclusion of the Civil War, partly because of the nature of the crimes subject to capital\npunishment and partly because blacks were kept in their place not by slave patrols and the\nsuppression of slave revolts but by Jim Crow laws and the use of lynching and other forms\nof intimidation.\n21 The vast majority of America's mass legal executions occurred during a span of just over\ntwo centuries, as the population grew from about a quarter million to nearer forty million\npersons. Only about one eighth of the subjects of mass executions had been convicted of\nmurder, currently the only crime for which persons are sentenced to death and that even then\naccounted for 60% of all executions. About one fifth of the mass executions involved crimes\nrelated to war (treason, desertion, mutiny, espionage), with about 9% involving piracy. If the\nsmall number of legal executions related to Indian uprisings are added to those related to slave\nrevolts, mass executions for those two offenses by oppressed minorities against the ruling\nauthority account for over half of the mass legal executions in those two centuries. Meanwhile,\nthe most famous mass legal executions, resulting from the Salem witch trials, accounted for\njust 2% of the mass executions of the period prior to the end of 1865.\n22 There were a number of reasons for more mass legal executions in the first centuries of\nEuropean residency in America. Some crimes \u00ad slave revolt and piracy, for example \u00ad are\ngroup activities, inviting punishments of groups. In addition, the legal system made mass\nexecution easier. Death was the mandatory sentence for some felonies. In the South, trials\nmight be before a justice of the peace rather than a jury; when with a jury, slaveholders were\noverrepresented, further minimizing due process for accused slaves. The rules of evidence\nimpaired the ability of slaves to defend themselves, while protecting whites since blacks could\nnot testify against them. As a result, convictions were easier to obtain and appeals were almost\n   , Vol. 8, n\u00b02 | 2004\nnonexistent; even petitions for gubernatorial commutation might only be initiated by free\nmen. Trials remained relatively rapid, with appeals relatively rare, throughout the nineteenth\n23 On the other hand, as perceptions of what offenses warranted execution changed in the second\nhalf of the eighteenth century, there was a greater tendency for jury nullification, especially\nwith property crimes, where the only sentence for the guilty was death. In addition, convicts\nmight seek commutation of the sentence, generally from the governor, and arguments for\ncommutation might include legal as well as other arguments; executive clemency prevented\nmany executions from occurring. In the northern colonies, and later states, there might be\nweeks or months between conviction for most crimes and execution to allow the condemned\nto prepare his soul for God and to seek clemency on earth, although delays were sometimes\nminimal in the case of witches, pirates, and soldiers.\n24 Indeed, one difference between normal executions and mass executions may have been the\nway culprits were perceived and thus the speed with which mass executions were carried out.\nThe general seventeenth and eighteenth century view was that all men were sinners; those\ncommitting capital crimes subject to execution were seen as similar to other folks who, but\nfor the grace of God, might have committed the same act. However, this perception did not\napply to the crimes and criminals subject to mass executions; they were viewed more as the\ncondemned generally in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. There was less concern with\nallowing time for, and encouraging, penitence in the nineteenth century, as the view changed\nfrom one of all men being sinners to one that the law abiding were virtuous and the condemned\nmore alien. In the southern colonies and later states, particularly when dealing with black\ndefendants, there was less concern with the condemned slaves' souls, and executions were\nconducted more promptly34.\nPiracy\n25 Hanging pirates accounts for roughly 9% of the mass executions through 1865; there were\nten incidents beginning with the first mass execution in 1661, with the last mass execution\nfor piracy occurring in 1835. Piracy was a crime for which mass execution seems particularly\nfeasible, and about two thirds of all persons executed for piracy were hanged in groups. Their\noffense was the most serious of property crimes, threatening as it did trade in which the\ngovernment had a compelling interest and thus a crime more against the government than other\nproperty offenses. In the seventeenth century, Sir Edward Coke, probably the most important\nlegal figure for colonial America, described a pirate as \u00aban enemy of the human race\u00bb35. In\naddition to being societal outsiders, with no ties to or defenders in the community, their arrest\nmay well have involved the risk to, or actual loss of life of, the arresting body36.\n26 Pirate life was fairly democratic, with the captain first among equals, making it difficult for\nassociates to claim either impressment or innocence, although some suspects did successfully\nclaim compulsion or, essentially, apprenticeship status. The democratic nature of life as a\npirate was in many ways more appealing than life in the navy or on ordinary merchant ships.\nIn addition, relatively few pirates were actually captured. At any rate, on those occasions\nwhen pirates were captured and tried in a group, they also were hanged as a group, and fairly\npromptly, often less than ten days after conviction37. In recounting a mere two day delay\nbetween sentence and execution of some pirates in the British West Indies, for example, Daniel\nDefoe recounted that, when the \u00abPrisoners pray'd for longer Time to repent and prepare for\nDeath,\u00bb their request was rejected. They were told that they should have been using the four\nweeks since their apprehension for that since from that date on \u00abthey ought to have accounted\nthemselves as condemned by the Laws of all Nations\u00bb38. Although not all pirates were male,\nall those hanged in mass executions in America were, and, where ethnicity was noted, the only\nminority reported was a group of five Hispanics, the final group of pirates hanged, in 183539.\nWitchcraft\n27 The Salem witch trials led to perhaps the best known of mass executions in colonial America.\nThe Salem witch trial suspects included prominent persons as well as those in ill repute, and\n   , Vol. 8, n\u00b02 | 2004\nmen and children in addition to women. With one of the leaders of the prosecutorial conspiracy\na physician, the victims included midwives and a competing physician. Political, religious,\neconomic, and even family feuding may have been distinguishing characteristics of the Salem\ntrials, which could also be seen as an effort to explain and expiate whatever sins had led God\nto abandon the English colonists so that they were humiliated in a military attack on French\n(Canadian) colonists40. The witch hunt eventually included about two hundred suspects in as\nan area with perhaps a thousand households.\nthe last male, refusing to plea, was pressed to death on September 19 \u00ad constituted 57%\nof alleged witches executed in America. Four others died while imprisoned in Salem that\nyear, including the infant daughter of one of those hanged, whose older sister, aged four, the\nyoungest accused and imprisoned for witchcraft, was released on bail after her mother's death.\nThe times between condemnation and execution varied. Although only a week passed between\nthe first condemnation and execution, a group of five women executed in July had three\nweeks to prepare, those in August two weeks, and those in September included some given\ntwo weeks and some only five days41. Once the governor prohibited spectral evidence, most\nwitchcraft trials ended in acquittal with the few convictions commuted. During the seventeenth\ncentury, an additional 13 persons (mostly women) were hanged as witches in Connecticut and\nMassachusetts, and one slave woman in Maryland in 177942. Those selective hangings fail to\nindicate the same pervasive social fear as the Salem witch hunt.\nMurder and other felonies\n29 Only about one sixth of the persons included in mass executions during this period dealt with\nordinary murders or the other felonies (especially robbery and burglary) for which capital\npunishment was commonly the sanction, at least through most of the eighteenth century.\nWhereas about 28% of all persons executed before 1866 were involved with mass executions,\nonly about 7% of convicted murderers were thus dealt with. Several reasons help to explain\nthis. One is that most such crimes probably included only one or two culprits. Another is\nthat gang activities might still escape such punishment since, particularly in the North, two\nlegal responses limited such executions. First, since the mandatory sentence for conviction\nof serious felonies was execution, juries occasionally simply acquitted those clearly guilty if\nthey deemed death too severe a sentence for less culpable gang members. Second, executive\nclemency \u00ad commutation of sentences by the governor (or, in a few colonies or states, other\nbodies with pardoning power) \u00ad was fairly common, granted in one quarter to one half of death\nsentences as compared to one or two percent in twentieth century America.\n30 By the nineteenth century, only the South retained capital punishment for large numbers of\nfelonies less serious than murder, particularly for such crimes as sexual assaults, committed by\nslaves43. Even with murder and serious offenses, mass execution was most likely when there\nwas some aggravating factor, such as homicides committed in the course of robbery and/or by\ngangs \u00ad robbery related murder being considered into the nineteenth century, as it had been\nfor centuries, as an especially heinous murder \u00ad or by slaves, Indians, Hispanics, and others\nconsidered to be outsiders44.\nWar related executions\n31 Approximately 20% percent of the massexecutions during the period were related to military\nactivities, probably enhanced by the fact that two major wars of the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies were civil wars, where both sides were represented by American civilians. The\nnumber understates the actual figure. There were some summary military executions without\nuse of courts martial. Also, executions following courts martial by British forces during the\nRevolutionary War would not have been viewed as following due process by the existing\nrevolutionary authorities. The impact of war on executions can be shown by the fact that\nwhereas a quarter of those executed antebellum were subjects of mass execution, well over\nhalf of Civil War era executions occurred en masse.\n   , Vol. 8, n\u00b02 | 2004\n32 A number of the war related mass executions appear to be related to popular concerns about\ndisloyalty among fellow citizens and to concerns by military leaders about the relatively\ncommon problem of desertion and/or mutiny. The first such mass executions occurred when\nSir William Berkeley, Virginia's governor, put down Bacon's rebellion in 1676-77, with 23\nexecuted for treason, 14 of whom were after quick courts martial often presided over by the\ngovernor against whom they were rebelling but 9 were after civilian convictions45. A few of\nthe other mass executions were also related to more localized events such as two groups of\ndeserters executed in New York in May 1756 during the French and Indian [Seven Years]\nWar, and one group for treason in Louisiana in 1769, where the hope was for French rather\nthan Spanish rule46.\n33 Desertion was a common problem in America's eighteenth and nineteenth century wars\n(French and Indian War, Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Civil War), as were executions\nfor desertion, with the number executed increasing partly to frighten potential deserters from\ncommitting that offense; other means included rewards for capturing deserters and offers of\npardons to deserters who returned fairly promptly to duty47. Most executions for desertion \u00ad\nperhaps 60% of those so slain \u00ad were mass executions. In 1756, convicted New York deserters\nwere split into two groups for execution to enlarge the sphere of deterrence, one group\nin Albany, where the court martial occurred, with another group sent to Schenectady for\nexecution. During the War of 1812, General Winfield Scott ordered a court martial that had\noriginally sentenced only one deserter to die, to reconsider and order all four convicts to be\nshot48. The execution of deserters during these wars was actually imposed on only a fraction\nof the persons who were guilty of the offense, with the number chosen based on perceptions\nof what was needed to impose discipline.\n34 Such mass executions were not based on social or popular concerns but on efforts by the\nmilitary and political leaders to ensure compliance with orders. It may be indicative of a greater\nproblem with desertion by Confederate forces, particularly in the later stages of the war, that\nled to more victims of mass execution for desertion in the Confederacy \u00ad 55 in three incidents,\nwith 22 possibly not really deserters, versus 18 in four incidents of Union soldiers49.\n35 A complicating factor in some wars was determining which soldiers were deserting and which\nwere merely fighting for the side other than the one for which they were expected to fight.\nThe Confederacy executed for desertion 22 white males who had been fighting with Union\nforces, insisting the men were not Union soldiers, and thus prisoners of war, but Confederate\ndeserters. The perceived execution of POWs led to formal protest and the threat of similar\nexecutions by Union forces of Confederate POWs should there be any repetition of the event50.\nThere were three instances of mass execution of black Union soldiers, not for desertion but\nfor rape, murder, and mutiny, with all of the executions coming after General Robert E.\nLee's surrender at Appomattox. There were no mass executions recorded of white Union or\nConfederate soldiers for violent offenses, except for Confederate soldiers executed primarily\nfor desertion, but who also had murdered while resisting arrest for desertion51.\n36 Some of the military related mass executions during America's wars for independence and\npreservation of the union involved perceptions of treason. Unlike desertion, the executions of\nperceived enemies clearly indicated social fears along with strong popular views. Some Tory\nsympathizers were executed for treason, murder, and/or robbery, for acts they presumably saw\nas supportive of the legitimate government52. Again, similar actions against those supporting\nindependence might not have been recorded as legal executions.\n37 There were similar executions by both sides of the Civil War. For example, in north Texas\nwhere there was concern that relatively recent arrivals who were non slaveholders might be\nsympathetic to the Union side, there were not only mass executions of a total of 36 men\nimmediately following a trial, but the lynching of another 14 and informal shooting of three\nothers, with no trial or prior to a verdict from the \u00abcitizen's court\u00bb53.\n38 In war, some executions were related to battle. For example, at King's Mountain in the\nRevolutionary War (1780), the winning rebels reacted to perceived previous refusal of the\nloyalists to give quarter to defeated rebels by refusing to accept surrender and instead\n   , Vol. 8, n\u00b02 | 2004\nmassacring many of the British troops and supporters. They followed the massacre with\nsummary trials of some of the survivors, quickly followed by mass legal executions54.\n39 Espionage was another war related offense punished in mass executions. The most prominent\nincident served as the basis for two major films \u00ad The General (1926), with Buster Keaton, and\nThe Great Locomotive Chase (1956). Two civilians and about 20 ununiformed Union soldiers\nstole a locomotive in Georgia with the intent of destroying railroad bridges on their escape\nthrough Tennessee. As the movies portray, the men were captured, but the fact that eight men\nwere hanged was not featured in the films. Most of those soldiers were among the first men\nawarded the new Congressional Medal of Honor55.\nIndian uprisings\n40 There were relatively few mass legal executions for Indian uprisings; most hostilities between\nEuropean settlers and the native population did not involve even the pretense of judicial\nproceedings56. The mass executions occurred primarily after settlements had been established,\nand trouble ensued as Indians reacted to what they perceived as mistreatment. The actual\nmass executions occurred only near the beginning and the end of the period in question.\nMassachusetts executed 8 Indians in 1676. After that, the next two recorded mass executions\nof Indians occurred during the Civil War, although it is possible that mass executions of\nIndians for murder in (Spanish) California in 1778, in Arkansas and Alabama in the 1830s,\nfollowing a military tribunal and presidential review of the initial 300 death sentences,\nexecuted 38 Dakota Sioux in response to a series of massacres in Minnesota resulting in the\ndeaths of about 800 civilians58. Five Indians from the Nome Cult Reservation were executed\nin Mendocino County, California, the following year, in response to civilian complaints about\n\u00abIndian outrages\u00bb59.\nSlave revolts\n41 Almost half of the subjects of mass legal executions during the two centuries ending with the\nCivil War were involved in slave revolts, and almost all of those executed were blacks \u00ad mostly\nslaves but a few free men. Most of those executions occurred in the nineteenth century prior to\nthe start of the Civil War; there were relatively few during the eighteenth century, and during\nthe Civil War there was decreased recourse to due process and greater use of troops to suppress\ninsurrections. In the case of slaves and slave revolts, there were an undetermined number\nof killings without due process in addition to legal executions. Under some circumstances,\nslaveholders had the authority to kill their slaves, and, even where illegal, such actions were not\napt to be punished by the state; but such punishment was generally of single slaves, not groups.\nSlaveholders, in general, preferred to let the courts deal with slaves' crimes, especially group\noffenses, since they could be reimbursed for executed slaves; the compensation was deemed\nnecessary in part to prevent slaveholders from protecting their property from the criminal\njustice system. In the case of slave insurrections, many slaves were killed in putting down some\nof the larger revolts, particularly those led or inspired by Gabriel in 1800, Denmark Vesey in\n42 Most slave revolts, as recorded by Aptheker, resulted in the apparently lawful execution\nof selected slaves rather than mere killing, although the total number executed was likely\nsurpassed by the number slain without a trial. Both numbers would have been dramatically\nhigher but for the economic pressures against destroying \u00abproperty\u00bb and/or compensating\nowners for such \u00abproperty\u00bb. The extent of due process varied and could be minimal. The\nsurviving record of a slave revolt in St. Peter's Parrish, Louisiana, seems limited to a teenager's\nrecollection: \u00abThere was a rumor afloat of a threatened insurrection among the slaves. But like\nalmost every other plot of the kind, the scheme failed. Information was given by one of the\nnegroes, wiser, or more timid than the rest. The ringleaders were seized a few hours before the\ntime appointed for the outbreak. They were tried without delay and ten, or a dozen, condemned\nto be hanged. Their heads were cut off, stuck on poles and set up along the highway leading\nfrom Purrysburg, the place of trial, to Coosawhatchie, the judicial capital of the District\u00bb61.\n   , Vol. 8, n\u00b02 | 2004\n43 Most of the revolts resulted in relatively small numbers of slaves being executed, generally\njust a few ringleaders rather than the more numerous followers, although there were several\nwith a dozen or more executions. Punitive focus on ringleaders may also help to explain the\nvast predominance of males among those executed for slave revolts. Only about 3% of the\nslaves executed were female. That focus also explains why most slave revolts did not result\nin mass executions. While Aptheker records over one hundred slave revolts \u00ad defined by him\nas involving more than merely killing as an owner or overseer, or attempting to escape, but\na planned or attempted uprising, by 10 or more persons, against the system \u00ad only about\none third of them resulted in mass legal executions. On the other hand, although the data\nare not too reliable, that third accounted for up to 80% of executions for perceived slave\nrevolts. The relatively small number of slaves executed was not due to slaveholder or the\nstate concern about black lives, but for two other reasons. To slaveholders, slaves constituted\nvaluable property, not lightly to be destroyed, if selective executions were sufficient to\nassure compliant behavior in the future, then other participants might suffer severe corporal\npunishment (whippings, nailing an ear to a post and then removing it, etc.) and/or sale of some\nslaves out of state. In addition, the executions of slaves were costly to the states, since most\nstate laws called for reimbursing slaveholders for property essentially taken by the state. There\nwas thus a desire to balance the competing goals of deterrence and frugality or economy62.\nIn addition \u00ad somewhat ironically in view of the lack of legal counsel for free blacks facing\ncapital charges after the Civil War \u00ad slaves were often entitled to counsel for capital trials63.\n44 Executions of blacks for all offenses, including slave revolts, were much more common than\nfor whites in the South. Death was the standard sentence for slaves for a number of non\nlethal offenses for which the penalty for whites was only a few years' imprisonment64. Unlike\nwhites, who could at least appeal for commutation, any such appeal was sometimes precluded\nfor blacks who were dependent upon whites to make such appeals on their behalf65. Mass\nexecutions of blacks, however, were generally for life threatening offenses such as murder,\nattempted murder, and slave revolts. Although southern whites were occasionally executed\nor lynched for anti slavery or pro slave activity, whites were among those hanged in mass\nexecutions clearly related to anti slavery activity on only four occasions: the New York City\nslave revolt of 1741, aiding runaway slaves in Florida in 1846, John Brown's raid, and one\nwhite man hanged along with three blacks in a Georgia slave revolt during the Civil War66.\n45 In an effort to make the selective mass executions more effective as a future deterrent as well\nas, perhaps, to indicate their disapproval of the revolts, some of the methods of execution were\nmore traumatic than hanging, the standard method of execution until the late nineteenth century\n(except for the firing squad used for some military executions). These included beheading\nslaves after execution, with the heads displayed as a permanent reminder to slaves as to what\nmight happen to them if they revolted; using the gibbet, thus exposing the entire body rather\nthan burying it; and burning, considered a sort of \u00absuper-capital punishment\u00bb67.\n46 Burning had two advantages for the state and slaveholder. First, it was a more painful death\nthan hanging. Second, along with vengeance for the victims and the authorities, burning was\nthought to reduce the likelihood of salvation of the soul. Particularly during the seventeenth and\neighteenth century, the execution of whites was an effort to punish without imposing eternal\ndamnation on the soul of the person executed. Although trials might be relatively speedy,\ndepending upon when the court regularly met relative to when a person was arrested for a\ncrime, executions were often delayed to allow the convicts plenty of time to make their peace\nwith God and to ready the soul68. But there was less concern when slaves were executed. The\ndelays were shorter \u00ad at most days instead of weeks or months \u00ad and, particularly with death by\nfire, there was a desire to humiliate the corpse and assure \u00abthe living that the culprit's remains\nwould not rise whole on the Last Day of Judgment\u00bb69.\n47 Even for leaders of slave revolts such executions were rare, with the desecration of the body\nonly imposed after death; there were still occasional recommendations that the offender spend\nhis remaining days \u00abmaking peace with the God who you have offended \u00ad Your crime must\nhave been great but it has not placed you beyond the pale of forgiveness \u00ad God is merciful \u00ad\n   , Vol. 8, n\u00b02 | 2004\nRepent and save your immortal soul!\u00bb70 The judge, after enthusiastically sentencing Nat\nTurner, leader of the largest slave revolt, to \u00abbe hung by the neck until you are dead! dead!\ndead!\u00bb, immediately added \u00aband may the Lord have mercy upon your soul\u00bb71. Whatever may\nhave happened to Turner's soul, his postmortem body was reportedly skinned, with some of\nthe skin turned into a money purse, the skeleton going to a doctor, and the rest of the body\n48 The mass execution of slaves clearly demonstrated a social fear of a slave insurrection,\nalthough widespread reporting of most perceived revolts and executions was limited.\nSoutherners may have feared insurrection, but they also feared that reports of insurrection\nmight encourage more revolts, and reports would undermine southern claims that slaves were\nsatisfied with their lot. Differences between Aptheker's counts, based on newspaper and\npersonal accounts, and those of Espy and others, based on legal documents where preserved,\nindicate that, when revolts were reported, the numbers executed may have been exaggerated,\neither for deterrent purposes or just expressive of a normal human tendency.\n49 The most vicious punishments for convicted slaves, however, occurred outside the South and\nin Louisiana during the first half of the eighteenth century. Breaking on the wheel was used\nas the punishment for one or two slave revolts in Louisiana73. When four slaves killed their\nowner's family in New York in 1708, execution was reportedly by torture, with the black\nfemale slowly burned74.\n50 The most painful executions were efforts to suppress revolts in New York City, first in 1712,\nand then in the better known revolt of 1741. The 1712 revolt resulted in far fewer executions.\nAfter arson, stabbing, and shooting killed 9 whites and injured another 7, about 20 black males\nwere executed over a period of about three months after convictions on charges of murder or\naccessory to murder. The law did not specify the means of execution, so the governor opted\nfor selective viciousness due to the fear the revolt had created among the populace. Several\nwere just hanged, but one was hung in chains until he died of starvation, another broken on\nthe wheel, and three burned. Tom, the slave of Nicholas Roosevelt \u00ad the last common ancestor\nof both Presidents Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt \u00ad was roasted slowly, the process\nreportedly taking more than 8 hours75.\n51 By the time about 32 persons were executed for the New York City revolt of 1741, the methods\nof execution were more limited, but the panic greater. Unlike most southern revolts, where the\npunishments for white conspirators were generally relatively light (whipping, banishment)76,\nthe New York City revolt was suppressed with the execution of 2 white females and 1 or 2\nwhite males, all hanged. Of the 29 black males executed, 15 were burned. The white panic \u00ad\nleading to the banishing of 70 blacks and 7 whites in addition to over 30 executions in the\ncity and 2 executions in New Jersey for arson77 \u00ad is exemplified by the treatment of Johannes\nRoosevelt's slave, Quack. Part of the panic was caused by the burning of the governor's\nmansion (which the lieutenant governor believed to have been an accident) and various other\nbuildings. Quack was convicted even though Roosevelt, a prominent New Yorker who had\nserved on the grand jury indicting various slaves, provided the alibi that Quack was occupied at\nthe time of the arson of which he was accused, and thus could not have been guilty. As Quack\nand another slave were prepared for execution by burning, Roosevelt suggested to Quack that\nhis only hope was to say he was guilty and seek a reprieve, but the mob watching the execution\nrefused to allow a delay for a reprieve to be considered, and the two slaves were burned78.\nConclusion\n52 From early colonial days to the end of the Civil War, the mass executions of slaves indicated\nthe great concern of the white community over the possibility of insurrection by persons\nwho constituted either a substantial minority (as in New York City in the first half of the\neighteenth century and most southern states) or even a majority of the population of as an area79.\nMass execution for piracy was related mostly to the nature of the crime and its occasional\npunishment, and for desertion was related to the need to establish military discipline. The other\nmajor contributors to mass executions \u00ad Indian and slave uprisings and witchcraft \u00ad seem more\nindicative of great localized fears rather than just the frequency with which particular crimes\n   , Vol. 8, n\u00b02 | 2004\nwere being committed. While Indian uprisings and the witch hunts were sharply limited in\ntime and place, the fear of slave revolts was an overriding concern wherever slavery existed\nprior to the North's victory over the South.\n53 Before the end of the Civil War, the study of capital punishment would show a greater use for\nmoral offenses in the North and property offenses in the South, discrimination against outsiders\neverywhere, gradual declines in the use of the extreme sanction for non lethal offenses \u00ad more\nthan made up for by its use against murderers \u00ad a greater perception of offenders as different\nfrom non offenders rather than just other sinners gone bad, and largely unsuccessful political\nefforts to reduce the use of the sanction, with its imposition instead just less likely to be at a\npublic ceremony80. Mass legal execution, on the other hand, showed limitation only for less\nfrequently committed offenses (witchcraft, Indian uprisings, piracy), but greater use where\nsocial and/or political fears were greatest, related to slavery and war. For example, incidents\nof mass execution occurred roughly once every three years in the eighteenth century, twice\nevery three years in the antebellum nineteenth century (a period of increasing numbers of real\nand feared slave revolts), and five times a year during the Civil War.\n54 Following the Civil War, there was a dramatic decline in the use of mass legal execution.\nThere are a number of reasons for that, related to the types of crimes that tended to be punished\nwith mass execution and, for that matter, with capital punishment at all. The last execution\nfor witchcraft took place in 1779, and the last execution for piracy in 1862. Slavery ended\nfollowing the Civil War, although there remained fear of blacks and black equality in the South,\nand of immigrants and labor unrest throughout the country. But for southern blacks, this meant\nlynching and disproportionate use of ordinary, not mass, legal execution; nationally, blacks\naccounted for one third of those executed in mass executions, but about half of all executions,\nand almost three fourths of all lynchings (seven eighths of those in the South)81. During the\nhalf century heyday of lynching (1880-1930), approximately as many blacks were lynched as\nwere legally executed. About 7% of those lynched were murdered in groups of four or more,\nless than the antebellum percentage but higher than the percentage of postbellum mass legal\nexecutions82. For the most part, in the final decades of the frontier, the final suppression of\nthe Indians was conducted by the army rather than with the use of the judicial system, and\nother warfare on American soil all but ceased, and with it the need to suppress mutinies and\ndesertions.\n55 Various changes had occurred over the decades and centuries as well. It has been suggested\nthat crimes became less group and more individual activities83. After a century, attacks on\ncapital punishment itself, while failing, had certainly limited the number of offenses for which\npersons were commonly executed. By the final third of the nineteenth century and throughout\nthe twentieth, murder was almost the only crime for which whites were executed, and whites\nwere rarely executed for murder alone, but for murder with aggravating circumstances, such\nas in the course of another crime, as part of a gang activity, and the like. Blacks were more\nsusceptible to legal executions for rape and murder, even without aggravating circumstances,\nbut rarely for other offenses84. Mass executions have generally been limited to the crimes for\nwhich ordinary capital punishment is most supported, and which would remain constitutional\neven following late twentieth century U.S. Supreme Court decisions requiring findings of\naggravating circumstances even for murder to warrant execution. Following the Civil War,\nthere were only two mass executions resulting from crimes that did not involve the loss of life:\n56 In addition to the limited number of crimes subject to capital punishment, and especially mass\nexecution, criminal suspects had greater rights both at trials and after, limiting the likelihood\nof a death sentence being imposed. There was also a change in the way cooperative criminals\nwere treated. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, cooperation did not necessarily mean\nexemption from execution, although the hope for clemency was a motive for cooperation. In\nthe nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was more common for those turning state's evidence\nto be assured at least lesser sanctions. Felony murder convictions gradually led to fewer\nexecutions of those who, while involved in murderous activity, did not personally take another\nperson's life.\n   , Vol. 8, n\u00b02 | 2004\n57 Finally, diminished political support of capital punishment itself renders mass executions even\nless appealing, even to supporters of death penalties, who would rather not have the sorts of\nexecutions that would likely increase opposition to all capital punishment. Until the last mass\nexecution in 1960, and particularly for those prior to the end of the Civil War, however, mass\nlegal executions helped to show not just which offenses were of great concern to the public or\nits leaders, but the types of crimes likely to survive as bases for ordinary executions as well,\ndespite the growing opposition to capital punishment during the past two centuries.\nList of mass legal executions in america up to 1865\nManner of\nNumber, race,\nsex of executed\nSources,*\nMiscellaneous\n3 white males,\n1 black male\nE, M.

On a smaller\nscale, killing a master might be tried as petit treason, but is here murder, as is robbery-murder.

Torture involved such things as breaking\non the wheel, roasting alive, and gibbeting alive.\n88 A fifth slave was acquitted of the crime, but was ordered to hang the four convicted.\n89 Officially, for murder by Cayuse Indians of Presbyterian missionary/physician for witchcraft (Indian\nmedicine men, too, were subject to execution for bad magic), and of his wife and others, following a brief\nwar between settlers and natives. With competing missionaries, the hanged Indians rejected Presbyterian\nrites opting instead for those of the Catholics.\n90 There were also about 50 executions of white males by firing squad \u00ad the less insulting punishment\nfor desertion \u00ad but it is not clear that all were for desertion or any other single criminal incident.\n   , Vol. 8, n\u00b02 | 2004\n91 Mary Surratt was probably innocent, and was executed in part due to presidential defiance of a last-\nminute writ of habeas corpus, in addition to earlier recommendations for leniency.

In the United States, most post trial mass executions, defined as executing four\nor more persons for the same incident, occurred prior to 1866. This unstudied aspect of capital\npunishment is interesting for what it tells us about the social climate of the era (colonial days\nthrough the end of the American Civil War) in which those executions occurred and the leading\nfears of the society and/or its leaders. Following the American Civil War, mass executions\nnot only declined in number and rate, but also matched more the trends in capital punishment\noverall. A detailed list of mass legal executions in America up to 1865 is appended to this\narticle.\n   , Vol. 8, n\u00b02 | 2004\nLes archives montrent que tout au long de l'histoire, les gouvernements ont pratiqu\u00e9 la peine\nde mort, et ce parfois collectivement. Aux \u00c9tats-Unis, la plupart des ex\u00e9cutions judiciaires de\nmasse \u00ad entendues comme la mise \u00e0 mort de quatre personnes au moins pour un m\u00eame crime \u00ad\nsont survenues avant 1866. Cet aspect inexplor\u00e9 de la peine capitale est int\u00e9ressant pour ce\nqu'il nous r\u00e9v\u00e8le du climat social de l'\u00e9poque (de la p\u00e9riode coloniale \u00e0 la fin de la guerre de\nS\u00e9cession) des principales peurs r\u00e9gnant dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou des craintes des dirigeants. Apr\u00e8s\nla guerre de S\u00e9cession, le nombre d'ex\u00e9cutions de masse a d\u00e9clin\u00e9 en nombre et en taux, se\nrapprochant des tendances de la peine de mort ordinaire. Une liste d\u00e9taill\u00e9e des ex\u00e9cutions\njudiciaires de masse jusqu'en 1865 est annex\u00e9e \u00e0 l'article."
