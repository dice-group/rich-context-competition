    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nWe have previously shown that CdSe/ZnS core/shell lumin-\nescent semiconductor nanocrystals or QDs (quantum dots)\ncoated with PEG [poly(ethylene glycol)]-appended DHLA (di-\nhydrolipoic acid) can bind AcWG(Pal)VKIKKP9\nthrough the histidine residues. The coating on the QD provides\ncolloidal stability and this peptide complex uniquely allows\nthe QDs to be taken up by cultured cells and readily exit the\nendosome into the soma. We now show that use of a\npolyampholyte coating [in which the neutral PEG is replaced\nby the negatively heterocharged CL4 (compact ligand)], results\nin the specific targeting of the palmitoylated peptide to\nneurons in mature rat hippocampal slice cultures. There was\nno noticeable uptake by astrocytes, oligodendrocytes or\nmicroglia (identified by immunocytochemistry), demonstrat-\ning neuronal specificity to the overall negatively charged CL4\ncoating. In addition, EM (electron microscopy) images confirm\nthe endosomal egress ability of the Palm1 peptide by showing\na much more disperse cytosolic distribution of the CL4 QDs\nconjugated to Palm1 compared with CL4 QDs alone. This\nsuggests a novel and robust way of delivering neurother-\napeutics to neurons.\n",

We decided to use luminescent\nnanoparticles in order to track peptide delivery, and observed\nthat the nanoparticles themselves could be modified in order\nto target the peptides specifically to neurons.\nThe small (10 nm) size and unique spectral properties of\nCdSe/ZnS core/shell luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals\nmake them attractive delivery vehicles for drugs and the\nvisualization of cellular structures and processes (Mihrimah\nthat the coating on the nanoparticle can affect the fate of\nthe particle in that carboxy groups increase leukocyte\nadherence and migration whereas amino groups and PEG\n[poly(ethylene glycol)] do not (Rehberg et al., 2010) and an\nRGD sequence can target QDs (quantum dots) to tumours\n(Smith et al., 2008). Based on the idea that the surface\nchemistry of QDs can affect their in vivo fate (Smith et al.,\n2008) we therefore tested different coatings for drug delivery\nto the CNS (central nervous system) in a model of brain tissue\nin vitro, the hippocampal slice culture, where individual cells\ncan be easily identified and microenvironmental conditions\nare well controlled (Kunkler and Kraig 1997; Mitchell et al.,\nThere are three general ways of targeting QDs to cells\non intrinsic properties between the QD and cell to mediate\nuptake, such as surface functionalization and charge, and\ntherefore lacks the specificity necessary for a more targeted\napproach required by most medical applications (Delehanty\n1 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email dawg@uchicago.edu).\nAbbreviations: CL4, compact ligand; CNS, central nervous system; CPP, cell-penetrating peptide; DAPI, 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DHLA, dihydrolipoic acid; EM,\nelectron microscopy; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; HEK-293, human embryonic kidney 293 cell; NeuN, neuron-specific nuclear protein; PEG,\npolyethylene glycol; PPT1, palmitoyl:protein thioesterase 1; QD, quantum dot.\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\net al., 2009). Active delivery, such as electroporation, while\ninvaluable to basic research, is much too invasive for\ntranslation to treatment (Delehanty et al., 2009). The third,\nfacilitated delivery, wherein a delivery agent is conjugated to\nthe QD in order to assist in uptake, offers the best possibility\nfor true medical applications to emerge (Delehanty et al.,\n2010). Two areas are of primary importance in regards to\nfacilitated delivery, namely escaping the endolysosomal\nsystem and selective delivery to intracellular compartments\nWe have previously shown that PEGylated (Figure 1A) QDs\nfunctionalized with a polyarginine `Tat-like' CPP (cell-pen-\netrating peptide) can be specifically delivered to cells via\nendocytic uptake with no adverse effects on cellular\nproliferation (Delehanty et al., 2006), but remain sequestered\nwithin acidic endolysosomal vesicles for at least 3 days after\ninitial uptake (Delehanty et al., 2010). During this time the CPP\nmostly remains stably associated with the QD rather than being\ndelivered directly to the cytosol through endosomal escape\n(Delehanty et al., 2010). To overcome this problem Sugahara\net al. (2010) co-administered a tumour-penetrating peptide in\norder to allow drugs to penetrate into extravascular tumour\ntissue without the drug being chemically conjugated to the\npeptide. However, although co-injection with the peptide im-\nproved the therapeutic index of drugs, there was no evidence\nof endosomal cargo escape. We overcame this delivery and\nsubsequent release problem by using an amphiphilic peptide\n(Palm1, AcWG(Pal)VKIKKP9\n, Figures 1B and 1C) designed\nto both mediate cell penetration and vesicle membrane\ninteraction (Delehanty et al., 2010). This peptide exhibited\nrapid QD uptake by endocytosis followed by a slower, efficient\nendosomal release peaking at 48 h in a number of different cell\nlines. Importantly, this QD-peptide bioconjugate elicited\nminimal cytotoxicity in the cell lines tested.\nIn order to extend the usefulness of such QDs we varied the\ncoating and peptide/QD ratio and tested them for cell-type\nspecificity and subcellular distribution in a differentiating rat\nhippocampal slice culture system. Previous studies using QDs\nhave largely failed to show selective cell targeting, although\ntwo recent studies have shown selective targeting of\nstreptavidin-coated QDs to microglia (Minami et al., 2012)\nand atheronol-B analogue-coated QDs to macrophages\nFigure 1 Stuctural characteristics of Palm1-coated QDs\n(A) Structure of CL4 (above) shown in relation to PEG (below).

More promising has been a report\nthat nanoparticles coated with polysorbate 80 could\ntransport an analgesic peptide across the blood\u00adbrain barrier\nafter intranasal administration (Ruan et al., 2012). Our goal\nwas to target the QD\u00adpeptide to neurons while minimizing\ndistribution elsewhere, using a hippocampal slice culture mo-\ndel system. We find that a negatively heterocharged polyam-\npholyte coating, designated CL4 (compact ligand) (Susumu\net al., 2011), exhibits robust targeting to neurons in these\nslices with little to no uptake by astrocytes, microglia or oli-\ngodendrocytes. Additionally, we confirm evidence of endo-\nsomal escape due to the Palm1 peptide, shown previously\nonly in HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells), in\na much more complex hippocampal slice culture system.\nEXPERIMENTAL\nQuantum dots\nCdSe/ZnS core\u00adshell QDs with emission maxima centred at\n625 nm were synthesized (Invitrogen) and made hydrophilic\nby exchanging the native hydrophobic capping shell with\nDHLA (dihydrolipoic acid)-based ligands. For peptide-\nmediated delivery, we attached neutral PEG-appended\nDHLA ligands as described previously (Susumu et al., 2007;\nMei et al., 2008). For the cell-specific delivery, we used a more\ncompact, negatively charged polyampholyte CL4 ligand.\nPeptides\nThe palmitoylated peptide (Palm1) sequence used was\nwhere `Pal' corresponds to a\npalmitate group that is covalently attached to a non-\nhydrolysable thiol-resembling diaminopropionic acid residue\nfunctionality synthesized into the peptide backbone\n(Sapsford et al., 2007). All peptides were synthesized using\nBoc (t-butoxycarbonyl)-solid phase peptide synthesis, puri-\nfied by HPLC, and purity verified by ESI-MS (electrospray\nionization MS) (Dawson et al., 2010). All peptide sequences\nare written in the conventional N-to-C terminal orientation.\nPeptide-mediated delivery\nQD\u00adPalm1 bioconjugates were formed by diluting a stock\nsolution of preformed peptide\u00adQD complexes (1 mM QD\n0.1 M borate buffer, pH 8.9) into a complete growth medium\nto a final QD concentration of 50\u00ad100 nM. These peptide/QD\nratios were determined experimentally for the peptide to be\nthe ratio that yielded the optimal degree of uptake. The self-\nassembled bioconjugates were then incubated with cells as\ndescribed below.\nUptake by rat hippocampal slice cultures\nHippocampal cultures were prepared as described previously\ninvolving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal\nCare and Use Committee at the University of Chicago and\nconducted in accordance with the guidelines of the National\nInstitutes of Health. Briefly, Wistar rat pups (P9\u00adP10, where P\nis postnatal day) were anaesthetized with a progressive\nand decapitated, the brains removed\nand placed into HBSS (Hanks balanced salt solution, 3\u00b0C)\nsupplemented with D-glucose (6.5 mg/ml). Hippocampi were\nthen isolated and sectioned (350 mm thick) perpendicular to\ntheir septotemporal axis. Slices displaying an intact pyramidal\nneuron cell layer and dentate gyrus were transferred to\nuncoated 30 mm Millicell-CMTM tissue culture inserts\n(Millipore) in six-well culture dishes. Cultures were initially\nmaintained in medium containing 23% horse serum (no.\ntransferred to serum-free media for an additional 3 days in\nvitro before experimentation (Mitchell et al., 2010). Slice\ncultures were used between 21 and 35 days in vitro. The\nconstituents of horse-serum-based and serum-free media are\ndefined elsewhere (Mitchell et al., 2010).\nHippocampal brain slice cultures mature in vitro and closely\nresemble the anatomical and physiological characteristics of\ntheir in vivo counterparts (e.g., see Kunkler and Kraig 1997,\nAntibodies and staining\nHippocampal slices were fixed to gel-coated slides using\nProlong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen, no. P36931) containing\nDAPI (49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), a nuclear stain which\nbinds strongly to A\u00adT-rich regions in DNA. Neuronal staining\nwas carried out through Nissl staining with NeuroTrace 500/\ncharged nucleic acids in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) of\nneurons (Quinn et al., 1995). We used a monoclonal RIP\n(receptor-interacting protein) antibody (Millipore, no.\nMAB1580), which has been shown to specifically recognize\n29,39-cyclic nucleotide 39-PDE (phosphodiesterase) in oligo-\ndendrocytes (Watanabe et al., 2006). To stain for astrocytes,\nwe used a monoclonal antibody to GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic\nprotein, Sigma, no. G3893), largely expressed in astrocytes,\nand shown to be a robust method of detection (Courel et al.,\n1986). Microglia were stained using isolectin b4 (Invitrogen,\nno. I21411), isolated from the African legume Griffonia\nsimplicifolia, shown to be a robust stain for microglia (Streit\n1990). For toxicity studies, cultures were imaged after\nincubating for 20 m in serum-free medium containing\nmarker, at 24 h intervals. No evidence of neural cell death\nabove control was observed.

After 24 h in culture, CL4-coated QD\u00ad\npeptide conjugates showed patterns of distribution primarily\nwithin neurons along the CA3 cell layer (Figure 2). In\ncontrast, we observed little to no delivery to GFAP-positive\nastrocytes, isolectin-positive microglia or CNPase (2',3'-\ncyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase)-positive oligoden-\ndrocytes (Figure 3). Additionally, we observed no QD-induced\ncytotoxicity in the cultures after 72 h of CL4\u00adPalm1 exposure\nand staining with Sytox (Figure 4). Neurons were identified\nby morphology and NeuN staining. This is in agreement with\nMinami et al. (2012), who observed no cytotoxic effects after\nthe direct injection into the mouse hippocampus for up to 28\ndays.\nWe then showed that CL4-coated QDs lacking the Palm1\npeptide showed the same neuronal specificity as those\ndescribed above (Figure 5A). This was in marked contrast to\nQDs coated with PEG, also without the Palm1 peptide, which\nfailed to show either the specific cell-type targeting or cell\nuptake (Figures 5B\u00ad5D). Surprisingly, the CL4 coat alone\nconfers unique neuronal targeting properties to these QDs\nwith no need for a targeting peptide in the in vitro slice model,\nthus providing researchers with additional variables for tuning\nthe QD\u00adpeptide delivery system to target cells of interest,\npossibly in a variety of disease models and applications.\nHowever, the lack of the Palm-1 means that the QDs do not\nreadily egress into other subcellular compartments.\nQD delivery was not impeded by slice culture\nthickness or application method\nIn our brain slice culture system, hippocampal slices sit upon\na membrane suspended above the culture media. The QDs are\napplied directly to the media and allowed to naturally diffuse\ninto the tissue from the bottom up. To eliminate concerns\nthat the QDs might not distribute past the surface of the tis-\nsue, we compiled a series of z-stacks that showed that the\nCL4 QDs did penetrate the surface and were distributed\nthroughout the tissue (Figure 6A). Additionally, z-stack\nimages also show that the QDs penetrated through the cell\nmembrane to the intracellular milieu, as opposed to merely\nsticking to the surface of the soma (Figures 6B and 6C).\nEndosomal release\nIn addition to observing a punctate, perinuclear distribution\nof QDs in the CA3 cell layer of the hippocampus following\nFigure 3 Confocal images show that the CL4 QD\u00adPalm1 complex is neuron specific\nWe utilized cell-specific staining (green, described in the Experimental section) to determine if the QDs (red) were distributing to\nother common organelles found in our slice culture system and found no trafficking to astrocytes (A,D), microglia (B,E) or\noligodendrocytes (C,F). This confirms that our QD\u00adPalm1 complex is targeting neurons specifically in a complex in vitro system.

This diffuse fluorescence was only observed\nwith the CL4-coated QDs conjugated to the Palm1 peptide,\nand not the CL4-coated QDs alone, leading us to follow these\ndata up with EM. Previously, we had shown endolysosomal\nescape with this peptide using only isolated HEK-293T/17 cell\ncultures (Delehanty et al., 2010). Here, we show this peptide\nexhibits a similar effect in neurons in a hippocampal slice\nculture system that contains many non-neuronal cell types\nthat were not affected, thus demonstrating a remarkable\nspecificity for this coat and efficacy for this peptide in a\nmuch more complex model system. EM confirmed that the\nCL4 QDs were being transported to the cytosol, were not\ncytotoxic and were not forming large aggregates when\nconjugated to Palm1 (Figures 8A\u00ad8C). However, CL4 QDs\nwithout peptide, while still targeting neurons, remained\nsequestered within intracellular compartments (Figures 8D\nand 8E), validating our fluorescence data above.\nDISCUSSION\nFor the first time, we show evidence that QDs can be\nselectively targeted to neurons in a structured tissue\npreparation, thus providing an example of a versatile delivery\nFigure 4 Lack of QD-induced cytotoxicity in rat hippocampal slices after QD\u00adPalm1 treatment for up to 72 h\nCL4 QD\u00adPalm1 (red) after 48 h (A) and 72 h (B) in culture (Nissl is green, DAPI is blue).

Cytosolic\ndelivery, dependent on the Palm1 peptide, was further\nvisualized through EM. No intracellular delivery to associated\ncells was observed across multiple experiments leading to the\nconclusion that the negatively heterocharged (polyampho-\nlyte) nature of the CL4 coating appears to be critical in\nmediating uptake in a neuronal specific manner, since the\nneutral charged PEG coating did not have this property.\nNon-hydrolysable peptides such as GDap(Pal)VKIKK\n(DAP1) (Dawson et al., 2002) are competitive inhibitors of\nPPT1 (palmitoyl:protein thioesterase 1) in the low micro-\nmolar range (Dawson et al., 2010). They are taken up readily\nby cells by virtue of their basic amino acid sequences and\nfunction to some extent as chaperones in lymphoblasts from\nBattens disease patients with missense mutations which lead\nto misfolded PPT1 protein and subsequent destruction by\nthe ER stress response and ubiquitination (Dawson et al.,\n2010). Our initial goal was to utilize semiconductor QDs as a\nfluorescent tag for visualization of Palm1 delivery into the\nCNS. Unexpectedly, the presence of the palmitate-peptide\nstructure was shown to confer the function of endosomal\nescape on the peptide when conjugated to (Pro)9\n(Palm1) and bound to PEG-coated QD in HEK-293 cell cul-\nture (Delehanty et al., 2010). Our study extends dramatically\nthis previous finding by not only showing that endosomal\nescape is possible in a much more complex culture system,\nby utilizing structured tissue in the form of a hippocampal\nslice culture, but also showing that, when the peptide is\npaired with the CL4 coat, the QD\u00adPalm1 complex specifically\ntargets neurons and then escapes into the cytosol. We\nattribute this neuronal specificity to the zwitterionic nature\nof the CL4 coat, since it is not observable with neutrally\ncharged PEG. Further, the peptide appears to remain atta-\nched to the QD (by virtue of the binding of the polyhistidine\nsequence to the Zn in the QD) based on previous FRET\n(fluorescence resonance energy transfer) studies in cultured\nFigure 7 Representative pyramidal neurons showing uptake and diffusion of the CL4 QD-peptide complex into the soma and continuing\nthrough the neuronal processes\n(A) Pyramidal neuron off of the CA3 cell layer showing diffuse distribution of QD-peptide after 24 h.
