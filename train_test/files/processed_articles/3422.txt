    "abstract": "Abstract\nWithin the culture of an all-male private school, sport often holds a special status as compared with music. As an area of\nlearning and participation, sport is typically associated with masculinity and receives broad social acceptance, whereas music\nis often seen at the margins of the curriculum and considered as an activity for a select few who are innately talented. Because\nof these perceptions, participation rates for males are often higher for sport than they are for music. With this as our\ncontext, this study examined differences between the two elective subjects of music and sport, by seeking to investigate boys'\nmotivation to choose whether or not to elect music and sport in the final years of high school. The study utilized an online\nsurvey that was completed by 293 subjects (13 to 16 years old, school years 8 to 10). Results indicate that the boys were\nmore motivated to select elective sport rather than music (42.7% vs. 4.8%, respectively), with 49.8% choosing neither music\nnor sport. A comparison of facilitators of elective music and sport revealed similarities across the two domains, with interest\nin the subject (music or sport) receiving the highest mean rating for elective facilitation. Seven of the nine impediment scales\nwere significantly higher for music (only importance of the subject and parental influence were statistically identical across\nsport and music). The study is the first of which we are aware that directly compares music and sport as school subjects, and\nas such, offers insight into the different motivational forces that act to either facilitate or impede students' choice of these\nsubjects within an all-male private school.\n",

Some of the most interesting surround mas-\nculine attitudes to subjects such as sport, and these can be\ncontrasted with a subject such as music, where perceptions\nof the importance and usefulness of the subject can be dis-\ntinctly different. The pressure to conform to gender-role ste-\nreotypes intensifies during adolescence, often influencing\nthe individual's choice of involvement in activities perceived\nas appropriate to their own gender (Wigfield & Eccles,\nthat stereotyping \"may be an inhibitory factor for boys, who\nmay come under great pressure from peers if they engage in\nany activity that is seen as `feminine'\" (p. 15). Females are\noften reported as enjoying their musical participation,\nwhereas boys cite bad experiences with a teacher as being a\nsignificant reason for why they do not enjoy the subject\nCollins (2012) described the adolescent male ecosystem\nas a complex and delicate balance of messages and experi-\nences that can profoundly affect boys' attitude of being\ninvolved in musical activities. Within this explanation, three\nessential needs must be satisfied to maintain boys' interest\nand motivation for music: interest and positive attitude, suc-\ncess and accomplishment, and acceptance and praise. If any\none of these areas is influenced by negative messages or\nexperiences, then motivation for involvement in musical\nactivities may be impeded. In contrast to music, research\nindicates that sport competence is highly valued by boys,\nwhere the status and popularity of a sport can affect the way\na boy feels he is perceived within his particular peer group\nIn Western societies, adolescents report spending an aver-\nage of 75 min each day listening to music, with most pos-\nsessing a portable listening system to regulate their personal\nand social lives (Rideout & Roberts, 2010). Despite the huge\nrates of consumption of music, studies across different coun-\ntries and regions of the world show a consistent trend, indi-\ncating that the general population of school students value\nmusic less as compared with sport and other so-called\n1UNSW, Australia\n2University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nSimone Waters, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, 2052, Australia.\nEmail: dsdewaters@gmail.com\nFacilitators and Impediments for Elective\nMusic and Sport in Adolescent Males\nSimone Waters1, Gary E.

Given the personal and social\nsignificance of music and sport in adolescent males' daily\nlives, it is noteworthy that music is regarded as being less\nuseful and important for one's future career and as a subject\nthat is seen to add value to one's education when compared\nwith academic subjects (McPherson & O'Neill, 2010;\nRenwick & Reeve, 2012; Sulz, Humbert, Gyurcsik, Chad, &\nWhile choice of elective subjects can signify motivation,\nthere is limited research into the factors that influence choice\nof elective subjects at high school (Ferrer-Caja & Weiss,\n2010). This is surprising because subject selection has a pro-\nfound effect on the lives of adolescents beyond their school\nyears, and is a major determinant of future career\naspirations.\nDrawing on motivational theories considered to be help-\nful for understanding subject choice, the purpose of this arti-\ncle, therefore, was to examine high school student attributions\nfor the selection or non-selection of music and sport. The\nstudy adopted a survey that explicitly examined reasons for\nsubject selection, compared sport with music, and sought to\nclarify reasons that facilitate selection versus reasons that\nimpede selection of each subject by adolescent males.\nSubject Choice\nThree main conceptual frameworks have been devised that\nexamine influences on adolescent elective decisions. From\nan Ecological conception, emphasis is given to the impor-\ntance of individual factors such as the individual's level of\nconfidence and social factors such as significant family\nmembers, peers, and friends (Sulz et al., 2010). Similarly,\nSelf-Determination theory highlights the individual's need\nfor autonomy and competence, and social relatedness and\nsupport (Ryan & Deci, 2000), whereas Expectancy-Value\nmodel emphasizes the individual's expectations and goals, as\nwell as the social factors which shape the individual's values\nEcological Theory\nUsing the ecological perspective, research has examined\nsport participation (Allison et al., 2005) and factors that\ninfluence elective enrollment (Gyurcsik, Spink, Bray, Chad,\nfocusing on individual and social environmental causes of\nbehavior. Typically, researchers study influences on adoles-\ncent elective sport enrollment by examining individual (past\nexperiences, self-efficacy, class schedule, knowledge of the\ncourse) and social environmental (attitude of significant oth-\ners such as parents and teachers, course curriculum, commu-\nnity activities) influences for electing the subject in schools\n(Sulz et al., 2010). Overall, facilitators for both male and\nfemale enrollment are influenced by both individual and\nsocial factors. The important difference is that impediments\nto male elective enrollment are influenced by social environ-\nmental factors whereas impediments for females are influ-\nenced by individual and social environmental factors (Allison\nLuke and Sinclair's (1991) investigation into facilitators\nand barriers for elective sport found predominantly social\nenvironmental (including curriculum content and teacher\nbehavior) influences to be the most important, and these\nof the barrier statements (Luke & Sinclair, 1991). Unlike\nand barriers to be similar. They ranked from greatest to least\ninfluence, curriculum content, teacher behavior, class atmo-\nsphere and students' self-perception, and facilities (Luke &\nSinclair, 1991). Despite investigating male and female par-\nticipants, this study does not report gender distinctions, and\nlimits the investigation to students in senior high school\n(Grade 11 only). However, students are faced with elective\ndecisions prior to Year 11; hence, the current study furthers\nthe Luke and Sinclair paper by focusing on the years in\nwhich elective decisions are most pertinent (i.e., Years 8, 9,\nand 10), and by comparing factors across more than one\ndomain (music and sport).\nAlthough research into factors that facilitate or impede\nelective enrollment in sport is limited (Ferrer-Caja & Weiss,\nand social environmental factors play an important role in\nadolescent elective decisions. To date, these types of ecologi-\ncal sport studies have not been conducted in the music\ndomain, nor are there any studies which compare possible\ndifferences between the two subjects.\nSelf-Determination Theory\nSelf-determination theory is a meta-theory that includes\nissues that are related to Planned Behavior and Basic Needs.\nPlanned Behavior perspectives posit that behavioral inten-\ntion is influenced by the individuals' attitudes toward the\nsubject, social support, and perceived autonomy support,\neach of which is useful for examining influences for adoles-\ncents' selection of elective subjects such as music and sport\n(Shen, 2010). Similarly, Basic Needs research within this\nparadigm suggests that the psychological needs of compe-\ntence, relatedness, and autonomy are the fuel for internaliza-\ntion and optimal motivation (Deci & Ryan, 2002). Evans,\nMcPherson, and Davidson (2013) found the Basic Needs to\nbe a robust framework for investigating adolescent music\nengagement and claims the fulfillment of basic psychologi-\ncal needs (competence, relatedness, and autonomy) is vital\nfor ongoing involvement in musical activities. This line of\nresearch shows that students are more likely to cease involve-\nment in music making when these needs are not met. Like\nthe ecological framework, both Planned Behavior and Basic\nWaters et al. 3\nNeeds perspectives not only emphasize the individual and\nsocial components influencing choice but also highlight the\nautonomous learning environment (facilitating choice, con-\ntrol, and responsibility to the learner) for promoting motiva-\ntion and future enrollment.The literature of Planned Behavior\nand Basic Needs remains primarily focused on individual\nand social issues related to elective subject selection.\nResearch using this theoretical framework indicates that\nmost senior high school students make subject choices with-\nout adequate advice or planning, which in turn fails to maxi-\nmize their future opportunities for elective subject choices\nresearch (Eccles, 2005) shows that adolescents limit their\nrange of subject choice with inaccurate information and fail\nto consider long-term goals (Eccles, 2005; Siann, Lightbody,\nNicholson, Louise, & Dave, 1988). For example, Siann\net al.'s (1988) investigation of subject choices for Chinese\nsecondary students identified two main influences on these\ndecisions: whether they liked the subject or not and because\nthey were required to make a choice between subjects\n(imposed either by school framework or by eliminating less\ndesirable options). While these studies provide valuable\ninsight into factors influencing subject selection, they focus\non the overall process of subject selection rather than influ-\nences within specific domains.\nExpectancy-Value Theory\nThe Wigfield and Eccles (2000) Expectancy-Value theory\ncombines the motivational components of competency\nbeliefs, importance of subject, and utilitarian beliefs, and\nfocuses on both the role of students' beliefs about their own\ncompetence and the value they place on the activity.Applying\nthis framework, McCormick and McPherson (2007) have\nshown how the achievement in an upcoming examination of\ninstrumental music learners can be predicted by the value\nthey place on their musical participation, and the perceptions\nthey have of their own abilities. Furthermore, this line of\nresearch suggests that the students' subjective task values\n(including importance, interest, and usefulness) are most\ninfluential in subject choice decisions (Austin, Renwick, &\nImportance and Value\nWhen students perceive a particular subject area to be impor-\ntant and valuable, they are more motivated to pursue further\nstudy in that domain (McPherson & O'Neill, 2010; O'Neill,\nvaluing of music participation is one of the most important\nreasons why young people choose to continue with music\nthat parents who valued sport influenced their children's\nvalue of sport and that the transmission of the sporting cul-\nture influenced children's long-term motivation and partici-\npation. However, during adolescence, there is an overall\ndecline in value beliefs (Hidi & Ainley, 2002; McPherson &\nactivities are not valued or seen as important, students are\nde-motivated for learning.\nLiterature on music suggests that the marked decline in\nmotivation during adolescence is due to a belief that ability\nis essentially innate (Austin et al., 2006; Hargreaves,\nMcPherson et al., 2012); and therefore that no amount of\neffort will change one's innate capabilities. This misconcep-\ntion has been refuted by many academics including\nMcPherson and Williamon (2006), Sloboda and Davidson\ngreater emphasis on environmental aspects of skill develop-\nment, and especially the development of a healthy motiva-\ntional profile in the pursuit of personal goals associated with\nskill development. It is self-evident that struggling learners\nwho consider music ability to be an inherited or fixed trait\nthat is beyond their control will be less likely to value music\nactivities and invest sufficient effort and time into develop-\ning skills. Consequently, it is children's beliefs about their\nmusical competence that determine their commitment level\nto musical learning such that music learners who sustain an\n\"incremental and multifaceted view of music ability\" are\nmost likely to both value and maintain motivation for learn-\nInterest\nA learner's interest in a subject also predicts activity choices\nacross a variety of domains including maths, music, and\nResearch by Hidi andAinley (2002), and Hidi and Renninger\n(2006) indicates that there are differences in interest across\ndomains. In particular, Wigfield (1994) found that during\nelementary school interest in school music declines, in con-\ntrast to school sport which does not. However, as students\nprogress into high school, overall adolescents are much more\ninterested in non-academic activities than school-based aca-\ndemic activities.\nUtility Value\nAdolescent elective choice is also influenced by the utility\nvalue individuals place on each subject. Utilitarian value is\ndetermined by future goals, career aspirations, capacity to\nearn a good income, and acceptance into tertiary education\n(Renwick & Reeve, 2012). As students begin to focus on\nlong-term goals, parental pressure relating to vocational\nopportunities and potential earning capacity can unduly\ninfluence adolescent subject choice (McPherson et al., 2012).\n4 SAGE Open\nThe \"arts\" subjects (music, dance, drama, and art) are often\nconsidered less important for daily life and employment than\nthe more \"academic\" subjects (English, maths, science;\nMcPherson & O'Neill, 2010) with the result that the more\n\"academic\" subjects are elected in preference to subjects\nsuch as music and art.\nSelf-Efficacy\nSelf-efficacy studies seek to understand how individual's\nbeliefs about their ability to plan and perform particular\ntasks affect how they complete those tasks as they strive to\nreach their own personal goals (Renwick & Reeve, 2012).\nPositive self-efficacy leads to higher levels of concentration,\ncontrol, involvement, satisfaction, and motivation for learn-\ning (Bassi, Steca, & Caprara, 2007), while also promoting\ntask choice, motivation, achievement, sustained effort, and\nrange of school subjects, including music and sport, studies\nhave found that elective enrollment decisions are strongly\ninfluenced by self-efficacy (Cetinkapl & Turksoy, 2011;\nMcCormick & McPherson, 2003; McPherson & McCormick,\nstudy found that adolescent subject choices are influenced by\ntheir expectations of success and the personal value of each\nsubject. Overall, research indicates that self-efficacy signifi-\ncantly influences adolescent subject selection, with students\nmore likely to engage in activities they feel competent in and\nAim of the Study\nThe review of the literature supports the assertions presented\nby McPherson and Hallam (2009) that there are complex\nrelationships between motivational influences and subject\nselection However, most of the factors that influence adoles-\ncent choice of elective subjects can be categorized according\nto an individual component (autonomy, utility, competency\nbeliefs, intrinsic interest and enjoyment, importance, and\nself-efficacy) or a social environmental component (peers,\nteacher, family, and access and utilization of career informa-\ntion). Studies that compare both reasons that facilitate and\nreasons that impede elective choice across more than one\nsubject directly such as sport and music are lacking. Such an\napproach would have the benefit of identifying whether any\nof the motivational factors for one subject are dominant rela-\ntive to another. For example, if sport is chosen as an elective\nsubject because it is rated as having high competence value,\nis that value higher than for music? Furthermore, are the rea-\nsons for choosing a subject symmetrical with the reasons for\nnot choosing? For example, are students who have friends\ndoing music as likely to choose music as an elective as stu-\ndents lacking friends in music would choose not to?\nThe central interest of this study was to compare items\ndrawn from the research that act either to facilitate or to\nimpede the selection of music and sport during the final years\nof high school. For this reason, we chose to restrict our anal-\nysis to specific motivational constructs within the three theo-\nretical perspectives mentioned previously that we considered\nwould best enable us to focus on this issue. The survey\ninstrument therefore did not seek to confirm or explore\nunderlying dimensions of any single theory.\nThe items we selected, and the nominal theories and\ndimensions to which they belong are listed in Table 1. As a\nresult of our literature review, the study was confined to\nthose items reflected in the research surveyed earlier.\nFurthermore, the study used a small selection of items (to\navoid subject fatigue), while representing the broad range of\nmotivational frameworks described in the literature review.\nThis present study therefore investigated\n1. Reasons for choice (RFC) of music or sport electives\n(facilitators).\n2. Reasons for non-choice of music or sport electives\n(impediments).\nIt was anticipated that an examination of these reasons\nfor subject selection would help clarify understandings of\nadolescent motivation from a perspective not commonly\ncurrently found in the literature. We chose to examine a\nboys school because issues surrounding subject selection\nfor music and sport are particularly intense in this type of\nsetting. Unlike music, sport is firmly established in the\nethos and traditions of this particular school and has been\nregarded as a valued activity for students in every grade\nleading up to the last year of high school. In fact, it is com-\npulsory for all boys to participate in at least one sport until\ntheir final 2 years of high school. Therefore, exploring this\nparticular setting in which perceptions are firmly encultur-\nated can offer valuable insight into motivation for sport\nand music. Hence, the present study focused on reasons for\nelective choice by male high school students. We were par-\nticularly keen to determine whether facilitators and imped-\niments were the same for music and sport. Furthermore,\nwe tested whether reasons for doing an activity (when the\nquestion is posed as a facilitator of the chosen activity)\ncorresponds to the reasons for not doing that activity (when\nthe question is posed as a barrier for the activity not\nchosen).\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants from a private boys school in Sydney, Australia,\nwere invited to participate in a survey. Students (N = 293)\nof subject selection is most pertinent for students in Years 8,\n9, and 10 when students form judgments about whether they\nwill elect these subjects in subsequent years; hence, this\nanalysis has been limited to students in those years.\nWaters et al. 5\nThe school provides a large range of academic subjects to\ncater for a breadth of student abilities and interests. Students\nmust select two elective subjects in total: one from each of\nthe following two strands for 200 hr of study:\nElective 1: commerce, drama, French, German, graphics\ntechnology, industrial technology (wood), Japanese,\nmusic, visual arts, literacy.\nElective 2: commerce, design and technology, drama,\nFrench, industrial technology (metal), industrial technol-\nogy (wood), Latin, literacy, music, visual arts.\nEach of these courses offers a curriculum that integrates\npractical and theoretical components of each subject. In the\ncase of music, the learning experiences included performing,\ncomposing, and listening to music in a range of styles, peri-\nods, and genres (including a mandatory topic on Australian\nmusic).\nCurrently, all students in Stage 5 (Years 9 and 10) are\nrequired to participate in sport training on 2 weekday after-\nnoons, as well as a match each Saturday. Summer sport\nactivities that students in Stage 5 can choose include cricket,\nrowing, rugby, tennis, basketball, surf life saving, rock-\nclimbing, swimming, and athletics. Winter sport activities\ninclude rugby, soccer, cross-country, tennis, and athletics.\nUnderpinning the schools philosophy is the notion that\nstudents can learn a great deal about life from mandated\ninvolvement in sport. In contrast, both music and drama\nactivities are encouraged, in and outside the classroom with\nthe school having a long tradition of vocal and instrumental\ngroups and annual productions of various kinds. Both sport\nand music can be chosen as an elective subject in the final\nyears of schooling (i.e., Years 11 and 12).\nthe school must select five elective subjects in total. English\nand Christian studies are mandatory subjects. Students may\nchoose electives from the following subjects: ancient history,\nbiology, business studies, chemistry, drama, economics,\nEnglish extension, extension maths, geography, German,\ninformation technology, modern history, physical develop-\nment health physical education (PDHPE). In addition, it is\ncompulsory for students in Stage 6 to participate in sport.\nThis includes training twice mid-week and a match against\nother Great Public Schools (GPS) on Saturday.\nAll students enrolled in elective music must participate in\nat least one extra-curricular ensemble. There is a wide range\nof ensembles for students to be involved, which include\nJunior Band, Intermediate Concert Band, Senior Concert\nBand, Jazz Band, Intermediate String Ensemble, Senior\nString Ensemble, Symphony Orchestra, Chapel choir, a\ncapella choir, percussion ensemble, and guitar ensemble. In\naddition to these ensembles, students can be involved in the\nannual school musical and end of semester concerts.\nThe study was conducted near the end of the academic\nyear when participants had already chosen their subjects for\nTable 1.

The total number of online survey partici-\npants for the purpose of this study is N = 293. A multivariate\ntest found no significant difference between the year groups\nsurveyed; hence, results are collapsed across the year of\nstudy.\nProcedure and Materials\nParticipants started by indicating whether they had elected to\nstudy music and sport for the following year. Following on\nfrom this response, they were asked to provide reasons for\n(facilitators) and against (impediments) choosing music and\nsport as elective subjects by rating nine items from 1 (strongly\ndisagree) to 11 (strongly agree; see Table 1 for details of the\nnine items): interest, important subject, parent influence,\ncontinue after school, good at subject, like the teacher,\nfriends involvement, enjoy theory, and interest in history.\nFollowing institutional ethical approval and parent con-\nsent, the survey was initially piloted with a small number of\nother participants, and this resulted in some minor adjust-\nments to the wording of questions that made the survey eas-\nier to read and understand. The online Activities I Like to Do\nat School (ALDAS) survey data, which took approximately\n15 min to complete, were collected at school with surveys\nbeing self-administered online in computer laboratories that\nwere supervised by several staff members.\nThe survey was presented in two orders to achieve coun-\nterbalancing, with half of the participants answering the\nmusic questions first and the other half answering the sport\nquestions first. Participants identified reasons for involve-\nment in music and sport activities, and reasons for and\nagainst choice of elective study of music and sport. The sur-\nvey contained a conditional branch that depended on whether\nthe subject (music or sport) was chosen (or was going to be\nchosen) as an elective. Those who answered \"yes\" branched\nto the facilitator questions and those who answered \"no\"\nbranched to the impediment questions. Impediment ques-\ntions were worded identically to the facilitator questions,\nwith the inclusion of the \"not/do not\" at the grammatically\nappropriate location (see Table 2). For example, the facilita-\ntor item \"My friends are doing it\" had a matching impedi-\nment item \"My friends are not doing it.\" A sample of the\nitems used in the survey is shown in Figure 1.\nResults\n(49.8%) chose neither music nor sport.

A \"does not apply option\" was not\noffered in the checklist. The items that the students were asked to rank focused primarily on individual items, and are shown in Figure 1.\nWaters et al. 7\nA MANOVA was conducted with the nine music- and\nnine sport-related items as the dependent variables with an\nindependent variable order of presentation (music questions\nfirst or sport questions first).

Impediment items were phrased in negative where appropriate, meaning that a high mean score indicates strong agreement with the opposite\nvalence compared with strong agreement with the corresponding item in the facilitator condition. For example, on average, students did not choose\nmusic because they were not interested in the subject, and this non-interest was higher than the average non-interest students reported for not choosing\nsport.\nWaters et al. 9\nthese items reflecting a stronger impediment for music than\nfor sport. Importantly, participants reported that the influ-\nence of parents was not significant as a facilitator or impedi-\nment across both music and sport domains.Asummary of the\nfindings is presented in Table 5 with items rating above\nthe scale midpoint marked as significant (*) and those below\nthe midpoint marked as not significant (NS).\nDiscussion\nFacilitators and Impediments\nAs shown in Table 4, all items with the exception of parents,\nand for music only the enjoyment of theory, were reported as\nsignificant facilitators for students' choice to elect music and\nsport. In contrast, differences between music and sport were\nmuch more stark for the reported impediments. For music,\nall impediments were significantly higher than for sport,\nexcept for the parents item. For sport, the only reported\nimpediment that was higher than for music was the item per-\nceived importance of the subject, although the differences\nwere not statistically significant.\nThe moderate effect size of the two impediments, Not\nContinuing After School and Don't Like Teacher, supports\nearlier research by Sulz et al. (2010) that employed an eco-\nlogical framework and identified both the usefulness of the\nsubject to students' future (an individual component) and the\ninfluence of teachers (a social environment) as influential\nbarriers to elective enrollment. Furthermore, supporting the\nExpectancy-Value model, which emphasizes the individual's\nutilitarian beliefs and value they place on a particular activ-\nity, and the Basic Needs Theory's emphasis on the psycho-\nlogical need for relatedness, these impediment results reflect\naspects of each of the three main theoretical perspectives\npresented in the literature review (Ecological, Self-\nDetermination, and Expectancy-Value theories). The fact\nthat these impediments were stronger for music than for\nsport may be indicative of an overall lack of motivation for\nmusic as compared with sport.\nInterestingly, the least important facilitator and impedi-\nment reported for both music and sport was parental influ-\nence. Despite the large amount of evidence indicating the\nimportant role parents play in motivation and learning\nWheeler, 2011), research also indicates that adolescents use\nmusic and sport as tools for establishing independence and\ntheir own identity (Blomfield & Barber, 2011; Hargreaves et\nNorth & Hargreaves, 1999; North, Hargreaves, & O'Neill,\nTable 5.

Thus, when choosing elective subjects at\nschool, students at the age surveyed may perceive that they\nare influenced more by their own interests, competency\nbeliefs, peers, and teachers, than by their parents. Overall,\nour findings suggest that the highest facilitators and impedi-\nments for elective choice are more individual-oriented than\nsocial-environment-oriented. This finding supports the Self-\nDetermination theory view that adolescent motivation is\nmost powerful when it is self-determined and intrinsic rather\nthan teacher or parent-directed.\nIt is interesting to note that responses for facilitators are\nnot symmetric for like items across conditions (facilitator vs.\nimpediment), suggesting that the significance of an item\ndepends on whether the subject is or is not selected. For\nexample, high interest is an important facilitator for elective\nchoice, yet high lack of interest is not as much of an\nimpediment.\nMusic and Sport Elective Choice\nResults indicate that the male adolescent participants sam-\npled are more interested in enrolling in elective sport than in\nmusic, with 42.7% choosing elective sport and only 4.8%\nchoosing music. Yet, almost half of the participants (49.8%)\ndid not choose music or sport as one of their school subjects.\nOf the RFC items tested, reasons for choosing sport items\nwere rated significantly higher overall than for music. This\nfinding is in accord with McPherson and O'Neill's study,\nwhich reported that students perceive they were less capable\nin music and valued music less than other subjects\n(McPherson & O'Neill, 2010). Results from the current\nstudy are also consistent with the Simpkins et al.'s (2010)\nstudy, which reported that males were more motivated to par-\nticipate in sport than in music. In agreement with Schunk\net al.'s (2010) finding, students report valuing tasks they\nexpect to succeed in, and think that the most important tasks\nare those they expect to do well in. The significance of the\nresults for importance of subject, interest in subject, and\nwanting to continue after leaving school is indicative of\ndeeply rooted beliefs surrounding the value of music educa-\ntion at school. Values shape the way we approach learning\nand influence decisions about continuing to study subjects\nwhen given the choice. Through an enhanced understanding\nof the value and importance of an activity, students are more\nlikely to be more motivated and engaged in learning beyond\nthe school realm. We therefore propose that if music educa-\ntors are seeking to address low student enrollment in elective\nmusic, there is a need to encourage students (and parents) to\nbecome more reflective about the usefulness and importance\nof studying music: \"Skills can only continue to beget skills\nwhen they are valued for their deeply personal significance\nThe current study furthers the Simpkins et al. (2010)\nstudy by demonstrating that elective sport at school is\npreferred to elective music in school by adolescent males.\nThis mirrors the Simpkins et al. finding that out-of-school\nsport is preferred to out-of-school music for adolescent\nmales. However, the present study does not just elucidate\nwhy males choose sport and do not choose music but also\nsuggests that there are specific differences that influence\nelective enrollment between sport and music subject\nselection.\nNearly all RFC items for facilitating elective music and\nsport were statistically identical across the two domains. The\nmost important (as measured by mean score) elective facili-\ntator for both music and sport was interest in the subject (see\nTable 4). Other important facilitator items for music and\nsport included important subject, continue after school, good\nat subject, and like teacher. These significant facilitator items\nrepresent a cross-section of each of Expectancy-Value,\nEcological, and Self-Determination theories. The items\ninterest and important subject are related to the Ecological\nand Expectancy-Value theories, while the item such as\nteacher is related to the Ecological and Self-Determination\ntheories. In addition, the item good at subject is represented\nin all three theories, and finally, the item continue after\nschool is related to only the Expectancy-Value theory.\nOur results suggest that elective facilitators for music and\nsport are predominantly individual-oriented, with interest in\nthe subject being the most influential. Follow-up ANOVA\nwas used to investigate which RFC items rated sport higher\nthan music. However, one notable exception from these sim-\nilarities across the domains was that students reported enjoy-\ning the theory of sport significantly more than enjoying the\ntheory of music. Although it was not a high scoring item, it\nwas significantly higher than for the music case, and there-\nfore it distinguishes sport choice from music. We have not\nyet cited a previous study that reports one reason that com-\npels students to select one subject over the other. The enjoy-\nment of theory of sport appears to be driven by cultural\nfactors, rather than because there is anything especially more\ninteresting about sport theory than music theory.\nIn contrast, factors impeding enrollment (barriers) were\nsignificantly higher in music than in sport. The greatest\n(highest mean) impediment reported to elective sport was\nAll other RFC items were rated at or below the scale mid-\npoint (6). Music impediments, however, were above the\nscale midpoint (6) for every item (including not interested,\nunimportant subject, not continuing after school, not good at\nsubject, don't enjoy theory, not interested in history, friends\nnot involved), apart from parent influence and not liking the\nteacher.\nThe only impediment items that do not distinguish music\nfrom sport were the high scoring lacking importance of the\nsubject and the low scoring parent influence. Perhaps any-\nthing that is considered an unimportant subject is an impedi-\nment regardless of subject, whereas the other items that are\nsignificantly stronger for music such as not interested, not\ncontinuing after school, not good at subject, don't like\nteacher, friends not doing, don't enjoy theory, and not inter-\nested in history do appear to be subject-specific barriers.\nSome reasons are obviously subject specific, such as dislik-\ning the teacher (Turton & Durrant, 2002), because the teacher\nwill be different for different subjects of study. A version to\nmusic is most likely to have cultural origins--where boys at\nthe particular school, the parental socioeconomic status, and\nbroader exposure to sport rather than music, produce a halo\neffect (Nisbett & Wilson, 1977), making many justifications\nfor non-subject selection accentuated. However, participants\nreported that parent influence was not significant as a facili-\ntator nor impediment across both music and sport domains.\nAlthough the present study focused on RFC, the more\nunusual finding of the study (e.g., that parental influence\nmay not be as important for this age group as previously sug-\ngested) is notable in terms of the design of the study and the\necological model proposed by Sulz et al. (2010).\nConclusion\nThis study explored reasons influencing adolescent choice of\nelective subjects and extends previous research. Our\napproach was to identify a selection of motivational \"reasons\nfor choice\" that sampled a range of theoretical factors in\nmotivation research. Furthermore, our comparison of two\nsubject domains, as well as the analysis of facilitators in tan-\ndem with impediments, paves the way for more comprehen-\nsive follow-up research. In the present study, we were able to\nnot only report that male students are more motivated to par-\nticipate in sport than in music in the socioeconomic and cul-\ntural climate represented by the area in which the study was\nconducted but also pinpoint the reasons for differences in\nfacilitators and impediments that promote elective choice\nand reasons against choice of music or sport. Our results\nindicate that individual-oriented items rather than social\nenvironmental items may be more important in determining\na boy's choice of these elective subjects. Elective facilitators\nwere similar across music and sport domains, whereas\nimpediments were different across domains. Furthermore,\nreasons for impediments to elective music were rated signifi-\ncantly higher than reasons for impediments to elective sport.\nWhile social environmental influences are important,\nresearchers and educators need to be particularly cognizant\nof the dominant role individual-oriented factors play in ado-\nlescent motivation and choice. In addition, impediments to\nelective choices vary across music and sport domains for\nadolescent males with significantly more impediments for\nmusic.\nThese findings not only have implications for motivation\ntheory but also raise practical issues for teachers. It is vital\nthat educators become more cognizant of the different views\nstudents have toward studying the theory of sport, which\noverall students enjoyed, versus the theory of music, which,\non the whole, they did not. This reflects deeply embedded\nvalues held toward music study, especially when compared\nwith sport study, and affirms McPherson and O'Neill's\n(2010) finding that music study is least valued by students. If\nmusic educators are to more fully engage and motivate stu-\ndents, then the deeply embedded beliefs about the utility and\nvalue of learning music must be addressed. Both students\nand parents need to recognize that the highly valued out-\ncomes of self-discipline, co-operation, problem solving, and\ncreativity can all be developed through music study.\nHowever, while McPherson et al. (2012) may correctly\nbelieve that students who succeed are those who can imagine\nthemselves as musicians in the future, the onus rests on edu-\ncators to engage the majority of students for whom music\nwill not result in a music career. Therefore, music educators\nneed to encourage students and parents to become more\nreflective about the usefulness and importance of studying\nmusic if they are to more fully engage their students. In addi-\ntion, students must be presented with a future perspective\nbeyond school life to give purpose and meaning to their\nmusic education. In other words, it is quite likely that at the\ncore of impediments and facilitators of music or sport choice\nare cultural reasons. A more comprehensive understanding\nof these motivational forces would enable researchers and\neducators to implement effective strategies for promoting\nelective enrollments and ultimately address some of the\nimpediments to more active participation in music as a\nschool subject.\nAuthors' Note\nS.
