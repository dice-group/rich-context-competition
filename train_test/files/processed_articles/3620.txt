    "abstract": "Abstract\nOur article shows that there is a real challenge in balancing work and family for employees working in support services\nin domestic work for elderly persons; their workplace rights on this issue are quite limited, and they depend largely on\nmanagers' understanding and support. Given their difficult working conditions, these workers actually find quite a challenge\nin trying to reconcile work and family. Our article is based on a qualitative research mobilizing 33 semi-structured interviews\nwith employees of the home care sector in the field of the social economy mainly but also in the private sector. We first\npresent the concept of work\u00adfamily and personal life, then the area of home care and domestic work for the elderly. Then,\nwe present the particular challenges observed in reconciling work and family life, where possible by comparing men and\nwomen. The results highlight two major sources of differentiation: age and single parenthood. Those who are older highlight\nthe fact that children have grown up, and they have (finally) some time for themselves, even if their working conditions are\ndifficult (broken schedules, etc.). In contrast, single women live a much more difficult situation concerning work\u00adfamily, partly\nbecause of the lack of workplace rights on this issue and because of the poor working conditions for many (broken hours of\nwork, low wages, difficult working conditions). We conclude with some recommendations, including the Right to request,\nwhich appears to be the best option, although it would need some further analysis.\n",

Tremblay & Genin, 2010; Tremblay &\nMascova, 2013), and little has been done on lower level\nworkers or workers with difficult working conditions. This is\nwhat brought us to look into a group of workers that has less\nfavorable working conditions to see to what extent they suf-\nfer from work\u00adfamily conflict.\nThe work\u00adfamily or work\u00adlife conflict is generally ana-\nlyzed in reference to the lack of time faced by parents, which is\nthe result of a conflict between the time allowed to working and\nthe time that they manage to have for their family (work\u00adfam-\nily conflict) and for other activities--political, social, cultural,\nleisure (work\u00adlife conflict more generally). These various\nactivities (social, cultural, leisure, political, etc.) are often put\naside; parents sometimes procrastinate and end up completely\naddition, some research indicates that a large proportion of par-\nents who are in employment feel stressed because they are not\nalways able to balance their work and family responsibilities\nNelson & Quick, 1985). Also, many forms of employment\n(temporary, independent, on-call, casual) and schedules (part-\ntime, split, or broken schedules, etc.) increase the difficulties\npeople have in trying to articulate work and family, as well as a\nIn Canada, as in all industrialized societies, the transforma-\ntion of the labor market and the family, as well as demographic\nchanges, in particular, an aging society, causes difficulties in\n1Teluq, University of Qu\u00e9bec, Canada\n2Universit\u00e9 de Franche-Comt\u00e9, Besan\u00e7on, France\nCorresponding Author:\nDiane-Gabrielle Tremblay, Teluq, University of Qu\u00e9bec, 5800 St-Denis\nStreet, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada.\nEmail: diane-gabrielle.tremblay@teluq.ca\nWork\u00adLife Integration and Workplace\nRights for Domestic Workers in Support\nto Elderly Persons: A Real Challenge in a\nComplex Working Environment!\nDiane-Gabrielle Tremblay1 and Ilda Ilse Ilama2\n Keywords\nwork-life integration, domestic workers, elderly, workplace rights, working conditions\n2 SAGE Open\nbalancing work and family, and a good number of employees\nsometimes consider leaving their job or leaving the labor\nmarket earlier because of important difficulties in this area\nWilliams, 2013). This is particularly important for carers (of\nelderly or ill parents or partners) who are in employment\n(Lero, Spinks, Fast, Hilbrecht, & Tremblay, 2012) but can\nalso touch other groups of the population. Concerning the\nchallenges and difficulties of work\u00adfamily balance in gen-\neral, studies show that job characteristics are essential to\nexplain the importance of the work\u00adfamily conflict (Gu\u00e9rin,\nSt-Onge, Chenevier, Denault, & Deschamps, 1994; Gu\u00e9rin,\nSt-Onge, Trottier, Haines, & Simard, 1997).\nOver the years and with the development of the service\neconomy, many precarious and atypical types of jobs have\nbeen created. This increase in jobs and demand for services\nis due not only to the increased presence of women in the\nlabor but also to an aging population, which needs services\nduring long hours, sometimes outside of the regular 9 to 5\nworking hours (nursery, day care, health services 24 hr a day,\nAs mentioned above, the majority of research on work\u00ad\nfamily issues has focused on relatively advantaged profes-\nthis time to turn to the less advantaged workers, with difficult\nworking conditions. We therefore decided to study the home\nhelp services, which are all the more important in the context\nof an increasing demand for these services due to the aging\npopulation.\nFaced with an aging population, one of the aims of the\nQuebec (a Canadian province) government is to help people\nwishing to age in their home to achieve this. With the project\ncalled \"Aging and live together at home, in the community,\"\n(our translation from French), one of the objectives is to\n\"allow seniors who wish to stay at home as long as possible\nto do so and to ensure that their safety is not compromised\"\n(Minist\u00e8re de la Famille et desA\u00een\u00e9s [MFA], 2012).Although\nfor many years, women took charge of the private sphere and\nmen the public sphere, the current situation is certainly dif-\nferent with women's access to employment (Cloutier,\nIn the area of home care in general, but especially in ser-\nvices for seniors, jobs are sometimes criticized as being of\npoor quality (Devetter, Janice-Catrice, & Ribault, 2009), and\nwe did observe this also in our research. Indeed, these jobs\nare characterized by elements such as low pay, low qualifica-\ntion, and little recognition of these qualifications (CERC,\n2008). The concept of \"quality of employment\" usually\nincludes various dimensions such as training, compensation,\nand working conditions, which can be seen as partly depen-\ndent on human resource management practices, as they\ndetermine workplace rights and working conditions.\nOur article shows how the employees in this sector recon-\ncile their work and family and personal life, given the low\nlevel of workplace rights--they are usually non-unionized\nand subject only to the minimum labor standards--as well as\nthe low quality of their employment and difficulty of their\nworking conditions. This led us to the following questions:\nGiven their working conditions and low workplace rights,\nhow do male and female employees manage to reconcile\nwork and family life and in the area of home care, and par-\nticularly in domestic work for the elderly?\nTo answer this question, a study was conducted with 33\nemployees and 23 employers in this sector. First, we present\na short literature review on the issue of home care, then on\nthe issue of work\u00adfamily/life balance, focusing on the area of\nhome care. Then, we present the respondents, the data collec-\ntion technique, and finally our results.\nHome Care, Work\u00adFamily, and Work\u00ad\nLife\nHome Care Workers\nWe reviewed literature on home care aides or home care\nworkers as they are often called, but we call them domestic\nworkers, as in our case, these workers do not do anything\nrelated to health or physical care but only domestic work to\nhelp the elderly stay at home. There has not been much\nresearch on this theme; most research is on the health home\ncare, and this is precisely what brought us to look into work-\ning conditions of home domestic workers.\nThe existing literature mainly highlights the increasing\nneed for personal assistance services in industrialized econo-\nmies, and some research shows that it is mainly women,\nsome indicating mainly older women who do these jobs,\nwhich are usually low-status and low-wage work (Butler,\nA certain number of articles are centered on factors that\nlead workers to leave or to stay in these jobs (Butler et al.,\nthat can improve these jobs (Kemper et al., 2008). One arti-\ncle (Butler et al., 2012) has studied home care aides and has\nshown that low and variable compensation often forced\nworkers to leave these jobs, particularly the younger work-\ners; however, they indicate that these workers surprisingly\nfind more rewarding than challenging aspects to the job.\nIn the context where many economies are looking for new\ncost-effective models for elderly home care, another article\nindicates that the new market model of home care can lead to\nless job satisfaction and a higher propensity to leave the job\n(Denton, Zeytinoglu, Kusch, & Davies, 2007). This research\ndeals with health home care, and we have not found similar\nwork on the group of workers who do domestic work.\nHowever, some elements found in this research were inte-\ngrated for analysis in our own work (job characteristics,\nworkload, work intensification, number of visits per day and\ntime spent for this, organizational and peer support, job inse-\ncurity, relations with clients, etc.). Geiger-Brown, Muntaner,\nTremblay and Ilama 3\nMcPhaul, Lipscomb, and Trinkoff (2007) have looked into\nthe issues of abuse and violence in home care, and found this\ncould lead to depression. In our own work, we also looked\ninto this question but actually found few elements to confirm\nany form of abuse or violence; on the contrary, most workers\nindicate that the elderly for whom they work are eager and\nhappy to have them at home.\nAnother research indicates that home care workers have\n\"a conflicted, often contradictory, relationship to their\nworkers can find in this work some constraints that can\nreduce their capacity to do a good job or to see the work as\nmeaningful and rewarding. However, this research highlights\nthe fact that workers can however find meaning in such a job.\nOur results are close to what Stacey (2005) reports; it appears\nthat workers actually find dignity in the cleaning work (or\ndirty work, as Stacey puts it).\nDomestic home work for the elderly is clearly a particular\nsector of activity as it is situated paradoxically at the fron-\ntiers of public and private spheres (Martin-Matthews, 2007);\nin Qu\u00e9bec, the public sector contributes to the financing of\ndomestic workers for the elderly, and these workers partly\nfinanced by the public sector enter the private sphere of\nelderly people.\nOur literature review shows that research has mainly cen-\ntered on health care workers and less on domestic work, and\nthis led us to look into the work\u00adfamily balance issue for this\ngroup. We wanted to complete the picture presented by exist-\ning research and try to determine whether these workers do\nmanage to deal with the constraints of the work. We also\nobserved that if working conditions were treated in some\nresearch, no work had been done on the impact of these con-\nditions on work\u00adfamily and work\u00adlife challenges.\nDefinition of Work\u00adFamily and Work\u00adLife\nChallenges\nHaving decided to address the issue of work\u00adfamily and\nwork\u00adlife for this group, we pursued our literature review on\nthis theme. The expression of \"work\u00adfamily balance\" is\nfairly recent, and it is with the feminization of employment\nthat the term appeared in the literature during the 1990s\n(Tremblay, 2005). However, the term work\u00adlife or work\u00ad\nfamily balance does not always lead to consensus among\nresearchers. Some choose to speak of \"articulating work\u00ad\nfamily,\" others of \"harmonization between work and personal\nlife\" or of \"balancing work and family\" (Tremblay, 2012b).\nThe first expression refers to both employment and family,\nbut the inclusion of \"personal life\" is also used to extend\nbeyond responsibilities of working parents, to include those\nwho have older handicapped children or elderly/ill parents.\nIndeed, over time, researchers have gone beyond parental\nresponsibilities to include the responsibilities of anyone who\nhas gainful employment and who wishes to have time for his\nor her personal life, thus adopting a perspective centered\nmore on a life course view. It must be recognized that family\nresponsibilities are increasing the difficulties related to\nworking time for many workers, and although the work\u00ad\nfamily issue has not translated into workplace rights in most\ncountries (see the debate on \"Right to request\" working time\narrangements, cf. Tremblay & Nogues, 2014), we consider\nthat this should warrant special attention from the employers\nThe expression of work\u00adfamily reconciliation or integra-\ntion refers to the objective of reducing a real or potential con-\nflict between work and family. The work or employment\ndimension refers to the workplace, workplace rights, and the\nspecifics of the job, especially the degree of autonomy in\nwork, workload, workplace rights, or other job specifica-\ntions, which can influence the level of work\u00adlife conflict\njob specifications and workplace rights are essential to deter-\nmine the importance of the work\u00adfamily conflict by socio-\nprofessional class, as the difficulties clearly vary depending\non the professional category, various groups having different\nlevels of autonomy, a different type of workload, and work-\n2013). Constraints at work may be more important while\nworkplace rights may be lower, as in the group studied here,\nand these may then constitute an important obstacle to work\u00ad\nWork\u00adFamily Conflict in Qu\u00e9bec\nNot only are work\u00adfamily challenges different from one sec-\ntor to the other, but the link between work and family changes\nthat the number of mothers in the labor market has increased\nconsiderably, a change that has occurred particularly since\nthe 1960s (St-Amour, Laverdure, Devault, & Manseau,\nthe labor market has an impact not only on child care but also\nIn the 1980s, not only has Quebec seen an increase in wom-\nen's participation in the labor market, but also, the participa-\nThe new labor market includes more dual-income fami-\nlies, more and more single women workers who must pro-\nvide care for children, and many men and women who need\nto provide care for elderly parents or disabled persons (Lero\nis the aging of the population, which clearly represents an\nincreased challenge in balancing work and family, as women\nare often also caring for elderly relatives (St-Amour et al.,\nuted in an important increase in the number of home care and\ndomestic care jobs, so that domestic workers are at the fore-\nfront of today's challenges in an aging society with more and\n4 SAGE Open\nmore women active in the labor market and thus less avail-\nable to offer care and support to elderly members of the\nfamily.\nFinally, several changes have occurred in the labor market\nand in employment relationships (Tremblay, 2004). We are\nwitnessing a gradual and steady decline in the normal work-\ning hours (the traditional \"9 to 5\") and an increase in atypical\nschedules or \"non-standard,\" split schedules; evening, night,\nirregular schedules; and so on. Women working in the ser-\nvice sector are quite concerned by these changes as they are\nthe majority in the areas of retail, health, restaurants, and\nhotels, where these working schedules and working times are\nmost frequently observed (Tremblay, 2012a).\nDomestic Care in Quebec\nWe now present the situation of domestic work for elderly\ncare in Qu\u00e9bec. Although there are some private companies\nactive in this field, home care often falls within the scope of\nthe social economy in Qu\u00e9bec. Indeed, since 2006, the\nQu\u00e9bec government has favored the development of various\nsocial economy sectors and companies, and these social\neconomy firms are characterized by social objectives. As\nindicated on their website, the social economy firms were\ncreated to promote the satisfaction of individuals and local\ncommunities, and the social economy is very much centered\nthat are part of the social economy, personal services attracted\nour attention when we decided to look at work\u00adlife issues in\nthe less advantaged sectors of the economy (from the point\nof view of wages, working conditions, and rights). This cat-\negory of personal services brings together all services con-\ntributing to the well-being of people wherever they live,\nwhether it be their home, place of work or leisure. The per-\nsonal services sector is however very diversified (P\u00e9tillon,\n2009). We chose to look into home care services to seniors,\nand particularly domestic services (not health or nursing ser-\nvices), which help maintain the elderly in their homes by\ndoing the cleaning for them. This sector occupies a special\nplace in personal services because of the nature of jobs and\nthe type of clients or beneficiaries involved (the elderly and\nfrail benefit from special support programs).\nIn Quebec, in the context of the provision of public ser-\nvices, home help services are integrated into the broader cat-\negory of \"home support\" services to the elderly or frail\npeople, people with disabilities, and sick or convalescing,\nwhich also include professional home care (doctors, nurses,\noccupational therapists, etc.). Home help services refers to\nthe following: personal assistance services: health care, food\naid, assistance to the mobilization and transfer, domestic\nhelp services (housekeeping home, meal preparation, laun-\ndry, shopping, etc.), and community activities related to civic\nsupport (help in administering a budget, completing admin-\nistrative forms, etc.; Minist\u00e8re de la sant\u00e9 et des services\nFaced with an aging population, the need for domestic\nhelp has increased over recent years (Ratel, 2012). Depending\non requirements, these home care services can be offered by\nthe local authority, community organizations, volunteer\ngroups, staff hired directly by the local health services, per-\nsonnel hired directly by individuals, or social economy firms,\nand the latter have become important providers over the\nThe history of the development of these services helps us\nunderstand the increase in the share of the social economy\ncommunity services supported by the government (CLSC-\nLocal Center for Community Services) started to use private\ncompanies rather than their own personnel to give services,\nwhich contributed to a privatization movement over time.\nThe public sector became less important in the delivery of\nservices, while the private sector increased its presence.\nIndeed, with the support of the Ministry of Health and Social\nServices (MSSS) as well as regional health centers and social\nservices (CRSSS), a large share of public funds was used to\noutsource to private sector companies the home care ser-\nvices, rather than use public sector staff (Vaillancourt &\nto use mainly the social economy enterprises in domestic\nhelp (ESSAD- Entreprises d`\u00e9conomie sociale en services\nd`aide domestique ) for the delivery of home help services.\nOver time, the state officially recognized these social econ-\nomy firms (ESSAD) by giving them direct funding for these\nservices. The ESSAD now provide most of the housekeeping\nfor the elderly, and these services are practically no longer\noffered by public structures (Boivin, 2013).\nThe quality of employment, as well as working conditions\nand rights, is a major issue in the field of home care. Indeed,\nthe quality of employment for carers, including domestic\nhelpers, is often considered to be of lesser quality. (Boivin,\n2013) The difficulty of this work refers in particular to diffi-\ncult schedules, split schedules, travel between places of\nwork, and generally the difficulty of the work itself. Working\nconditions combine industrial discomforts and some chal-\nlenges of the service sector in dealing with individuals\nports the idea of difficult working conditions and low-level\nemployment in this sector (Devetter et al., 2009), as well as a\ngeneral absence of workplace rights (Boivin, 2013). In\nQu\u00e9bec, as mentioned above, workers mainly rely on the\nminimal workplace rights offered by the minimal standards\nlaw (2 weeks vacation, overtime pay over 40 hr, and the like,\nbut no right to working time arrangements whatsoever).\nAlso, among the various work-related discomforts, Juhel\n(1998) mentions the physical and mental exhaustion, con-\ntacts with beneficiaries who may be difficult, monotony of\ntasks, and often the lack of time to perform all tasks. These\nare all elements that we found in the work done by the\ndomestic help workers; although the working conditions\nmay be a little easier in the social economy sector, the work\nTremblay and Ilama 5\nitself remains difficult, and the schedules are also often split\nschedules as is the case in the private sector.\nIn our research, we thus wanted to address the issue of\nhow these employees reconcile their work and family respon-\nsibilities as well personal life in the context of working con-\nditions and workplace rights that are rather minimal.\nOur Research on Work\u00adFamily\nChallenges in the Home Help Sector\nPortrait of Respondents and Research Method\nPortrait of respondents. We conducted a qualitative research\nbased on semi-structured interviews lasting on average 1.5 hr\nwith 33 domestic workers in Quebec, namely, 10 employees\nin the private sector and 23 in the social economy firms\n(ESSAD). We also interviewed 23 employers with 3 private\ncompanies and 20 ESSAD managers. In this article, we con-\ncentrate on the views of employees, although the employers'\nviews gave us a better understanding of the specifics of the\ncontext and confirmed some elements from the employee\ninterviews. We need to mention that to access the employees,\nwe had to go through the managers, and interviews were car-\nried out under a voluntary basis, after managers put out a call\nfor volunteers to contact us directly. The domestic help\nworkers that we met were all working with elderly people\nwho wanted to stay at home but needed regular support to\ndo so.\nMethod of analysis. We used content analysis as it is proposed\nby a group of colleagues (Bardin, 1993; Savall & Zardet,\n2000) who designed a method of thematic treatment based on\nexcerpts from the interviews, which they call \"witness sen-\ntences.\" This method brings us to encode the text, and analyze\nit to gain an understanding of the representations and inter-\npretations of the respondents' discourse. It is based on the\ndivision of the text into sections, reading section by section to\ndetermine the important elements of content, and then encod-\ning the various categories or themes (Fallery & Rodhain,\n2007). The transcripts were cut into sections and analyzed\nwith the ideas or words contained in these sections. In other\nwords, we identified key sentences expressed by the respon-\ndents, which some colleagues call \"witnesses sentences\"\n(Savall & Zardet, 2000). This method allowed us to find \"pat-\nterns\" and to collect and understand the research results.\nResearch Results\nImportantdifficultieswithworkplaceconditionsandrights.Accord-\ning to our interviews, the home help staff faces difficult situa-\ntions regarding working conditions and workplace rights. In\nterms of schedules and hours of work, employees indicate\nthat the number of hours of work varies quite often, and\nschedules are often split. People who work on-call do not\nalways visit the same customers, and therefore, the hours can\nvary considerably in some cases. Many mention the complex\nissue of working hours, and their fragmentation, which\ncauses instability in private life. Moreover, hours and sched-\nules are strongly related to the working environment; as\nmany mention, this type of work is done essentially in the\nhomes of the beneficiaries of domestic help, and it mainly\nhas to do with cleaning the house or apartment.\nWorkers are often confronted with unpredictable events,\nand this can have an impact on their working hours. For\nexample, an elderly person can cancel a service at the last\nminute, for various reasons (hospitalization, not feeling well,\nor whatever). The worker is then not paid, without any right\nto some form of compensation for the lost hours and wage. It\napparently happens relatively frequently that the client/ben-\neficiary falls ill or he or she returns to the hospital, so this can\nhave an important impact on the worker's and the family's\nbudget.\nTravel times are sometimes long as distances between two\nclients can be important. Again, there is no right to any form\nof compensation here, although some social economy firms\npay for the public transportation ticket. However, as some\nworkers mentioned, it is sometimes preferable to go by car,\nto lose less time in transportation and thus reduce the total\nlength of the workday. This is particularly important for lone\nmothers, who cannot pay for someone to take care of their\nkids until they come home. Although there is public day care\nin Qu\u00e9bec, if a parent takes more time to return home, there\nis no pay for the extra time at the end of the day. The vari-\nability of distances is important due to the fact that the\nemployee does not work in the same place every day, nor\neven every half day; not having the same client means work-\ners are required to travel all the time. Interviewees who work\noutside of the main cities mentioned that they cover a very\nlarge territory, and therefore, transportation time can be quite\nlong, and all the more so when they are on call, and the places\nvisited can vary on short notice. A few excerpts from the\ninterviews confirm this:\nInterview 3: \nI have no contract, I am always on call. The\nCLSC contacts me and if there are calls I take\nthem as I prefer to work full time than part-\ntime, so as long as there are calls, I take them,\neven if at a distance.\nInterview 1: \nWork schedules, it's complicated, sometimes\nI start at midnight at Mrs. K's, sometimes it's\nearly morning. It may be just the afternoon,\none hour, two hours. That's more difficult . . .\nthis is the most difficult part of the job, I'll\nsay, it's worse in the private sector here, there\nis nothing stable here. There are stable con-\ntracts yes, but there are not many.\nThe number of hours, it depends, sometimes\nwe have cancelations, there is no other client\nto replace, and we lose our hours. I normally\ndo 32 hours. I would like to work more hours\n6 SAGE Open\nyet . . . I'd like to do a little more over my 30\nhours, yes.\nThe hours are very variable, because in my\narea, I am in a rural area, so the houses are far\napart, the area I cover is large, the country is\nbig so I can have important distances to cover.\nAlso I live in St-Gabriel, I have to go one\nplace two or three times a week and that is a\n40-45 minutes drive, and I often have to drive\n20 minutes to the clients' places.\nThese quotes from the interviews highlight some of the\ndifficulties facing these employees. Schedules and hours of\nwork are not stable, there are problems due to the large ter-\nritories covered by the workers, and the work schedules are\nsometimes changed because of cancelations. These workers\nhave no rights to compensation for these last-minute changes,\nnor for the long driving distances, even if their wages are\nquite low, usually minimum wage and sometimes a little\nhigher, but not much. Faced with these difficulties, we\nwanted to see how these employees manage to reconcile\ntheir work and family and personal life.\nAn important work\u00adfamily challenge. Most employees do not\nexpect to have any form of workplace rights regarding work\u00ad\nfamily reconciliation. They do not seem to expect support\nfrom their employer, and this is probably one of the most\nsurprising results, especially as work\u00adfamily issues have\nbeen high on the agenda in public discussions in Qu\u00e9bec for\nsome years now, and other professional groups will put for-\n2012c). However, these low expectations are probably due\nprecisely to the low quality of employment and workplace\nrights.\nMost workers, men as well as women, say they just \"man-\nage personally\" to get things done and to balance work, fam-\nily, and personal activities. They do not seem to expect much\nfrom their employer in terms of support, although they do put\nforward their preferences in terms of schedules and hours,\nbut just hope that the employer can take them into account,\nwhich appears to be somewhat more frequent in the social\neconomy firms than in other firms, but cannot be guaranteed,\nbecause of frequent changes in the clients'demands and situ-\nation (illness, hospitalization, etc.).\nThe workers manage to balance work and family in differ-\nent ways, and they put forward five explanations. The first\nexplanation refers simply to the fact that a majority of women\nsay that they just organize themselves personally to reconcile\nwork and family life to cope with the demands of work and\nfamily simultaneously. They have no choice to work, and\nthey expect no special support although the social economy\ncontext can present some advantages over the private sector.\nIndeed, marginal social benefits are sometimes better. Also,\nin a few cases, there is a retirement and medical plan, which\nis offered by the social economy group collectively and to\nwhich individual firms can adhere, but it is not all that do.\nFinally, sometimes the employer takes their needs into\naccount in terms of working hours or schedules, or at least\ntry to as much as possible.\nAccording to one employee, \"In life, you have to work\nand you need to have some personal organization to manage\nto balance work and family\"; this woman is therefore not\nexpecting any help or support from her employer but consid-\ners that she has to organize things by herself. A worker indi-\ncates that she organizes the family chores to reconcile\neverything, and she manages to do her work and spend time\nwith her husband. She tries to keep the whole weekend for\nher husband and his family. Another employee arranges to\nhave some \"good time,\" organizing her schedule accordingly\nand communicating the hours she is available to her\nemployer, who seems to respect her requests (in a social\neconomy firm). If there are things to be done, they are done\nwhen she is on leave or has some time off. According to\nanother employee, this strategy of personal organization also\nrequires sacrifices, for being on call, the employee may be\ncontacted by the company at any time. However, some con-\nsider that schedule flexibility is an advantage for work\u00adfam-\nily reconciliation.\nThe second type of explanation has to do with persons\nwho say they do not have so much difficulty in reconciling\nwork and family inasmuch as their children are now adults.\nIn one case, the children are grown up, they are independent,\nand they also know that their mother needs to work, so they\ndo not ask too much of her.\nIn the third group, the interviewees indicated that they did\nnot have children and only have their house or spouse to take\ncare of and seem to manage correctly in this context. In the\nfourth group, the employees say they have no problem in\nterms of work\u00adfamily integration; for them, the most impor-\ntant aspect is to not bring work problems back home. They\nsay they need to think of other things. They manage to get\nwork schedules that make it possible for them to spend more\ntime with their children. Although some admit it is difficult\nto find time to do their own cleaning and housework, employ-\nees in social economy firms say they can put forward their\nrequests in terms of working hours, and schedules, and the\nemployer usually tries to respect their requests. They have no\nrights per se to a given schedule or given hours, but there\nseems to be a mutual agreement in some organizations, and\nthings can work out well for some of the workers.\nHowever, the fifth group has to do with single mothers,\nfor whom it is often difficult to reconcile everything. A single\nmother has three children from different fathers, and she\nadmits she struggles to balance work, family, and personal\nlife. She says it is difficult to hold a full-time job, which could\nhelp her support her children. She tends to work part-time,\nwhich is not always the best solution from a financial point of\nview. Another woman mentions that she has no time for her\nchildren, except on Saturdays. It is difficult to cook a decent\nmeal for the kids after work, she says, and it is impossible to\nTremblay and Ilama 7\nwork full-time: \"I work a full 3 days, the other 2 days I work\na half-day. When you are a single parent, you have no\nchoice.\" Another employee indicates that it is difficult to rec-\noncile work and family because she lives with her husband\nand two children, and she has no one to help. This woman is\nan immigrant woman, and she lives only with her husband\nand children, the rest of the family having remained in their\ncountry of origin. A quote from the interviews supports this\nview where these workers tend to organize by themselves,\nnot having specific rights to working time arrangements or\nsupport, and things just get easier when children grow up:\nWell, that's okay, that's fine, I have children\nthey are not all teen but they know that I\nneed to work. And that's okay, I don't have\ntoo much problems with this.\nIt's perfect, my son is 20, my daughter is 24\nyears old, my daughter does not live at home,\nshe has her family, my son's doing well, I\nprepare the meal, then if he is working he\njust has to warm it up, they are grown chil-\ndren so I'm ok now.\nAs for the men in our respondent group, there are only\nfive of them, and two of the five men say that they organize\nthemselves to balance work and family (but they do not seem\nparticularly involved in family chores or responsibilities).\nAccording to one of them, people need to organize them-\nselves so that they can socialize and have a life.Another indi-\ncates that he prefers to work at night, because otherwise,\nwork would intrude with his social life. Another is separated\nfrom his wife and has one child, but he considers himself\n\"lucky\" as he does not have custody of the child and consid-\ners it would be difficult for him to balance work and family\nif he did have custody! Not having the child, it is possible for\nhim to work from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., and also follow some\nevening classes at the university.\nA fourth man says that work\u00adfamily balance is a state of\nmind; he feels quite relaxed, and he does not have a large\nfamily, which also helps to reconcile work and family. The\nfourth says that he prioritizes family, and work comes sec-\nond. Many moments are spent with his family, and many\nactivities are done together. The fifth man indicates he priori-\ntizes work and expects his employer to respect his requests\nfor the given working hours and schedules.\nInterview 2: \nI take the time to do what I have to do. We're\ntogether all the time: it's activities, family\ndinner, I see the family all the time and my\nwork comes second.\nInterview 3: \nOnce I decided to work, I gave my availabil-\nity for work, so I focus more on my work\nthan being at home. If you have decided to\ngo to someone's house for the cleaning, you\nhave to put it first.\nHere, we see a significant difference with women who\nhave young children because it is very rare that they do not\nhave custody, and some are also single mothers.\nInterview 7: \nIt is difficult. Especially here I have no time to\nmyself and no one to help. I'm just with my hus-\nband and my two children, and I do everything.\nA woman employee mentions that she takes care of her\ngrandson and now devotes time to him, but she says she has\nasked to have less clients as she must also get to the school\nand day care.\nAlso, although schedules are flexible in several organiza-\ntions that use these people, mainly in the social economy\nfirms, many mention that they are always \"running for time.\"\nStill, most do not expect support from the employer.\nInterview 6: \nIn life you have to work, work is important in\nlife. It's like everyone here, we manage work\nand family; if we have 1 hour, we try to we\nplan everything, our schedules and all that.\nInterview 8: \nI manage to have time for myself, that's for\nsure, it's important, I arrange my schedule\naccordingly. Then if I have things to do, I\nmanage to do them when I know I will be on\nleave. I manage.\nIn short, employees in this type of work experience many\ndifficulties in terms of schedules and working hours, and also\nin terms of traveling to each of the homes. To balance their\nwork, family, and personal life, employees organize things\nby themselves, giving their preferred hours and schedules\nand hoping the employer can give them these hours, which\nhappens more in the social economy sector than in the pri-\nvate sector. However, single parenthood is a real problem\nbecause it is not always very easy to reconcile work and fam-\nily in this type of situation, as many women have told us.\nConclusion\nThe objective of this article was to understand how domestic\nworkers in elderly care manage to balance their work, their\nfamily, and personal life, given their specific, and often dif-\nficult, working conditions. To do this, we first did a literature\nreview on home care workers and on challenges of work\u00ad\nfamily conflict and reconciliation.\nConsidering the time conflict caused by the different roles\nand tasks that many women and men have to assume with\nregard to their family, and the difficulty of combining the\ncompeting demands of family and work, it is surprising to\nsee that most employees interviewed expect very little sup-\nport from their employer, although some request and do\nobtain specific schedules and working hours. In this type of\nlow-wage and low-education job, workers only have mini-\nmal labor rights, and our results show that they do not expect\n8 SAGE Open\nworkplace support for their work\u00adfamily challenge as is\nmore often the case in professions such as law (Tremblay &\nMascova, 2013) and other higher level jobs (Tremblay,\nOur results allow us to say that despite a work environ-\nment that is complex and difficult, domestic workers helping\nwith the cleaning at elderly persons' homes appear to orga-\nnize by themselves. They manage to more or less balance\ntheir work, family, and personal life, inasmuch as they can\ngiven the constraints.\nAlthough the social economy firms seem to offer a little\nmore support, at least in arranging schedules according to\npreferences, people working in these firms as well as those\nworking in the private firms consider that work\u00adfamily bal-\nance is essentially a question of personal organization.\nIndeed, they do not seem to expect much support from the\nemployer, and they do not expect workplace rights to be\ndeveloped in relation to work\u00adfamily issues in this sector, as\nis more often the case in unionized environments and higher\nexplained by the fact that most employees have a low level of\neducation and cannot have accessto many other types of\njobs, so they accept these rather low workplace rights and\nworking conditions for lack of better options. Women with-\nout children and those whose children are grown up have\nfewer difficulties. Single mothers clearly indicate they have\ndifficulty, all the while still not expecting anything in terms\nof workplace rights.\nIn our view, there is clearly an issue here, and it would be\ninteresting to consider some recommendations to make these\nworkers'situation somewhat easier. First, we would consider\ndeveloping the \"right to request\" working time arrange-\nments, as this has been developed in a few countries, such as\nAustralia, Great Britain, and New Zealand (Tremblay &\nNogues, 2014). This would be an interesting extension of\nthis research, as it may offer an alternative for low-wage and\nlow-rights workers, who generally do not have much auton-\nomy or support in their work environment.\nWe might also consider developing options to exchange\nschedules between workers, when some schedules enter in\nconflict with a worker's family or personal obligations.\nFirms could develop a system to permit workers to exchange\nworking hours with another worker, although this might be\nmore difficult to have accepted by the clients, that is, elderly\npersons who like to see the same person each week, even if it\nis not for health care but for cleaning the home. Finally,\nanother option could be to develop teamwork, having the\nworkers take on tasks in teams of two, which would make it\neasier if one needed to be absent at a given time.\nHowever, in our view, the best option would clearly be to\ndevelop a more universal and legally enforceable \"right to\nrequest\" for all workers with family obligations, as this group\nis not particularly confident in its capacity to put forward and\nobtain any form of benefit or advantage. For this and other\nlow-level jobs, a universal right would be easier for them to\nrequest and enforce in their own work environment.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received financial support from the Social Sciences\nResearch Council of Canada, under the Community-University\nResearch Alliance Program.\nReferences\nBardin, L.
