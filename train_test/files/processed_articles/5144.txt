We focus\non what we call discourse design explications, that is, stretches of talk in which participants\nrefer to conflicting constraints in the discourse context, at the same time proposing particular\ndiscourse designs for dealing with these conflicts. We start by discussing three forms of design\nexplication. Then we will examine the various resolutions they propose for constraint conflicts\nand show how advisors seek customer consent or cooperation for the proposed designs. Thus\nour analysis reveals how institutional agents, while providing services, work on demonstrating\nhow the design of these services is optimized and tailored to customers.\n",

In institutional contexts, managing constraints is even more essential because\nmost of these contexts imply a vast number of discourse constraints. Discourse constraint\nmanagement is sometimes done explicitly. Excerpt 1 is taken from a Dutch mortgage\nconsultation:\n01 AD: listen. when we talk about a mortgage,\n02 we talk about financing a home.\n03 I will probably mention things you already know, C2: POLITENESS\n04 but that is just to make my story sensible. C1: EFFICIENCY\nThe ultimate purpose of this consultation is to make the customer understand basic\nmortgage information. However, there arises a dilemma in how to achieve this purpose.\nIn line 4, the advisor (AD) explains that he wants to deliver a `sensible story', which we\ntake to mean that he delivers his usual comprehensive mortgage introduction in order to\nprevent questions later on and thus to save time; this is an efficiency constraint. Heeding\nthis constraint may, however, lead to the violation of a politeness constraint, as telling\nthings the customers may already know (line 3) may come across as underestimating\ntheir knowledge, and hence as being impolite.\nIn order to resolve the conflict the advisor produces a design explication, that is, an\nutterance referring to a constraint conflict. At the same time, he proposes his solution:\nprioritizing the coherence of his story over adjusting it to hearer knowledge. Implicitly,\nhe solicits hearer consent for this course of action. So, this discourse design explication\nshowcases how the advisor maneuvers through a discourse context presenting conflict-\ning constraints.\nSuch discourse design explications occur regularly in mortgage consultations since\nmortgage advisors are bound by factors such as internal and external institutional poli-\ncies, the different interests of various departments (i.e. legal vs marketing) and the differ-\nent interests of agents (i.e. mortgage advisors and customers).\nMore generally, design explications display a distinctive feature of discourse design:\nany design is responsive to contextual pressures, but discourse is special in that talk may\nrepresent context and be explicit about the way it responds to contextual pressures.\nHence we are dealing with public displays of discourse design-in-the-making.\nIn this article, we will focus on these explications in the particular context of Dutch\nmortgage consultations, which we will analyze from three angles. First, they provide us\nwith a window on some of the constraints that are relevant in our particular genre of\ninteraction, and more generally on how the organizational context may affect discourse.\nSecond, they demonstrate how experienced professionals, using design strategies that\nhave been honed over time, deal with discourse options and dilemmas and try to satisfy\nas many constraints as possible. And third, the explications are interactional moves,\nshowing the advisor's expertise as well as inviting customers to participate in or at least\nconsent to discourse designs. Let us first discuss our core concepts of constraints and\ndiscourse design before moving on to our dataset and the actual analysis.\nDiscourse constraints\nWe define a constraint as a limitation to the options available to an interaction partici-\npant. Consider the Venn diagram in Figure 1, in which utterance options are represented\nby asterisks. The largest ellipse shows the set of possible utterances (SPU) theoretically\navailable to a mortgage advisor to achieve a basic consultation purpose, for example,\nexplaining basic mortgage concepts in Excerpt 1. This basic purpose constitutes the first\nconstraint impacting the interaction. This SPU is derived solely from purpose-related\nconstraints. However, various further constraints need to be heeded in the interaction; in\nExcerpt 1, these were politeness (constraint A in Figure 1) and efficiency (constraint B).\nThese further constraints carve out subsets from the primary SPU: the advisor should\nmanage customers' preexisting knowledge, otherwise they may get the feeling that the\nadvisor thinks they are stupid. Furthermore, the advisor needs to make sure his story is\ndelivered as efficiently as possible (constraint B), given that time is money.\nWe will call these further constraints non-purpose constraints. They derive from\ndifferent `aspect systems' (Veeke et al., 2008), a notion to be explained later. Supposing\nthat Figure 1 represents the situation of Excerpt 1, there is no utterance that would\nsatisfy all constraints, as the intersection of ellipses A and B contains no asterisk. Hence\nthe advisor can only prioritize one constraint over the other, which is the option actually\nchosen Excerpt 1.\nGiven that their optimal next move is often not self-evident, advisors regularly need to\nengage in discourse design. In other words, constraints by themselves do not produce\nFigure 1. Constraints narrowing down the purpose set of possible utterances.\ninteractions. They merely provide `structure', in the sense of the structurational analysis\nof social systems pioneered by Giddens (1984; see Carter and Sealey, 2000, for further\ndiscussion): they provide rules and resources that are drawn upon and acted upon by indi-\nviduals. Social action and social reality only emerge in the interaction between agency\nand structure, two entities that can never be reduced to one another. More specifically, our\nanalysis of design explications demonstrates how the discourse context not only con-\nstrains the advisors' set of interactional options, but requires them to use professional\nskills and creativity in navigating their design space. This involves what Giddens (1984)\nhas called reflexive monitoring: `In circumstances of interaction \u00ad encounters and epi-\nsodes \u00ad the reflexive monitoring of action typically, and routinely, incorporates the moni-\ntoring of the setting of such interaction'(Giddens, 1984: 3). While much of this monitoring\ngoes on implicitly, this article analyzes interactional displays of reflexive monitoring, in\nwhich the practical consciousness of institutional actors takes on discursive forms.\nWe have already distinguished purpose and non-purpose constraints. The non-purpose\nconstraints in Excerpt 1 concern politeness and efficiency, and they derive from different\naspect systems impacting the consultation. This notion of aspect systems stems from the\nDelft systems approach to organizational analysis (Veeke et al., 2008), which postulates\nthat all systems consist of elements (subsystems) linked to each other by different rela-\ntions (aspect systems). For instance, our mortgage provider, bank B, has a department (i.e.\na subsystem) called `Mortgage Communication' that develops several communication\nproducts, including the mortgage consultation. These products are further subsystems\nwithin the communication department (see the vertical pillars in Figure 2) and may even\nbe visible as such in the organizational structure in the sense that specific working units\ncorrespond with the different products.\nEvery working unit needs to consider various aspect systems, for example technologi-\ncal, efficiency and politeness aspect systems. These aspects refer to different kinds of\nconditional relations between activities, providing possibilities and impossibilities.\nAspect system issues may concern the technology required to build a website, the time\navailable to talk with customers or the preferred way of approaching customers. Such\naspect system issues generally apply to various subsystems simultaneously, so they can\nbe represented as bars `crossing' the subsystem columns (Figure 2).\nOur distinction between purpose-based and aspect system-based constraints is a well-\nknown one in design thinking. For instance, software engineers (Chung and Do Prado\nLeite, 2009; Glinz, 2007) talk about `functional' and `non-functional' requirements of\napplications. Examples of `non-functional' requirements in software design are speed,\nphysical requirements, security and interface usability. The label is slightly misleading,\nhowever, as these constraints are every bit as important as the functional constraints. The\nsame goes for the aspect system constraints in our study, which stem from the entire\norganizational context. They represent essential conditions for the interaction to take\nplace at all.\nTalk as a design practice\nThe perspective of talk as a design practice has been adopted in various traditions: dis-\ncourse analysts have used it in work on features such as coding the information status of\nreferents, perspective taking in lexical choice, syntactic organization and prosody (see\nFox, 2008); conversation analysts have discussed turn design, action formation and pref-\nfor overviews); within linguistics, Optimality Theory focuses on how utterances satisfy\nconstraints (Prince and Smolensky, 2004) and how hearers make inferences based on the\nassumption of constraint satisfaction (Hendriks and De Hoop, 2001). According to these\ntraditions, much of the talking design work takes place unconsciously and is primarily\nfocused on adjusting utterances to their recipients and the immediate context. However,\nO'Keefe (1988) proposed an elaborated analysis of communicators' assumptions under-\nlying talking design work in order to explain design variations. Her message design log-\nics theory explains differences between language users, which primarily appear when the\nmessage context presents complexities, for instance because of bad news.\nAakhus and Jackson (2005) share this interest in researching communicators'assump-\ntions, but include contextual factors such as technology. For them,\ntaking a design stance toward such technology includes, at a minimum, seeing what hypothesis\nabout communication is expressed in the design and being able to make reasonable assessments\nof whether people's use of the technology is adapted to its design features or struggles against\nThey state that message designs are constrained by contextual factors that bring their\nown designs with them; these factors may be technological in nature, but organizational\nas well.\nFace-to-face interaction design is peculiar in that constraints may be articulated and\nimplemented at the same time. This kind of designing-on-the-fly is a less studied phe-\nnomenon. One study by Aakhus and Rumsey (2010) reports an interactional discourse\nFigure 2. Potential subsystems and aspect systems relevant to mortgage communication.\ndesign analysis of a disagreement about interactional norms in an online cancer support\ngroup forum. The taken-for-granted interactional norms posed an interactional design\ndilemma because they were challenged by some participants but at the same time used\nby others to get a derailed complaint situation back on track.\nAakhus and Rumsey (2010) deal with design dilemmas that are largely implicit and\nneed to be reconstructed from the interactional moves of the various participants, while\nour design dilemmas are referred to more explicitly in the interaction, as our mortgage\nadvisors regularly talk about the various constraints applying to mortgage orientation\nconsultations. Another difference between this study and theirs is that we deal with a\nmore rigidly constrained type of institutional discourse.\nIn what follows, we will first describe our data, that is, the collection of mortgage consul-\ntations and organizational background documents clarifying the consultation context.\nSubsequently, we will analyze the consultation context in terms of purpose constraints and\naspect system constraints. This context analysis helps us to collect discourse design explica-\ntions in our data. The analysis of the explications starts with discussing three explication\nforms. Next, we will analyze the constraint conflict solutions proposed in explications. And\nfinally, we will shed light on the interactional role of the explications in this particular type of\ninstitutional discourse, especially on how they solicit customer consent and cooperation and\nhow they serve to profile expertise and individual agency given institutional constraints.\nData\nBank B, one of the main mortgage providers in the Netherlands, allowed us to record 39\nmortgage orientation consultations, with a length varying from 45\nminutes to up to\n2hours. All recordings were orthographically transcribed, thus enabling word searches.\nOrientation consultations are just one type of consultations in the Dutch mortgage\npurchase process; other types are advice consultations and mortgage quote signing con-\nsultations. They appear in this order in the mortgage purchase process. Due to Dutch\nlegislation launched in January 2013 (Besluit Gedragstoezicht financi\u00eble ondernemingen\n(BGfo) Wet op het financieel toezicht (WFT), 2013: Article 86C), the orientation consul-\ntation is free of charge, but the other ones are not.\nIn the orientation consultation, advisors explain bank B's basic mortgage options\n(mortgage forms, interest rates and interest rate periods), run a (maximum) mortgage\nloan amount calculation and discuss the outcomes of the calculation. So, the main advi-\nsor activities in the orientation consultation are data gathering, data entering and explain-\ning. When customers request advice, advisors cannot fully comply with their request as\na result of the Dutch legislation mentioned above.\nMortgage consultations are part of a multichannel communication package (MCP)\nthat supports home buyers (Herijgers and Pander Maat, 2015). We asked the MCP stake-\nholders to provide us with relevant organizational documents on bank B's organization\nstructure, on bank B's communicative and organizational purposes and on other con-\nstraints impacting the consultations. These stakeholders provided us with documents,\nsome confidential, and research reports on communication topics such as target groups\nand mortgage customer journeys. Along with the consultation data, these documents\nenabled us to reconstruct the consultation context.\nConsultation context analysis\nWe used the consultation corpus and the afore here mentioned organizational documents\nto identify the purpose constraints and the aspect system constraints. We opted to com-\nbine data sources because it is entirely possible that a constraint is operative but does not\nsurface in the explicit form of a discourse design explication. In fact, it is an empirical\nquestion as to which constraints tend to be invoked in the interaction and which con-\nstraints tend to remain tacit knowledge.\nWe started by listing potential purpose constraints. In the consultation transcripts,\ncustomers present four different reasons to visit bank B's mortgage advisor (see Table 1,\nleft column). From these, we derived the consultation's communicative purposes,\ndescribed in terms of the intended cognitive effect on customers (see Lentz and Pander\nMaat, 2004). These candidate purposes were validated by checking them with one of\nbank B's advisors.\nFirst, customers seek generic information on mortgage options and a mortgage pur-\nchase in general (Herijgers and Pander Maat, 2015). Second, they want to buy a house and\nwant to know how much money they can borrow. Third, they may have set their sights on\na house and want to know whether this particular house is affordable. Fourth, they may\nhave made an actual bid on a house under financing conditions and want to check bank\nB's purchase support. This applies to returning customers who left to find a house then\ncome back to check whether their initial maximum mortgage loan amount is still applica-\nble. Interest rates vary over time, and sometimes bank B's financing policies change.\nFor advisors, the orientation consultation is very important as it is the only customer-\ninitiated opportunity to create customer commitment. Normally, when customers choose\nto take up advice, they also stick with bank B to purchase their mortgage there. So, the\nmain purpose for advisors is to persuade customers to take up advice. In order to do so,\nthey seek to demonstrate a high level of personal service quality. If advisors succeed in\npresenting themselves as helpful and friendly, as well as competent, polite, reliable and\nknowledgeable and patiently willing to help customers (Lymperopoulos et al., 2006),\nTable 1. Customer purposes and advisor purposes in the orientation consultation.\nCustomer purposes Advisor purposes\nCustomer understands the issues that need to\nbe decided upon when purchasing a mortgage.\nAdvisor convinces customer to come\nback for an advice consultation.\n\u00b7\nCustomer understands basic mort-\ngage options and mortgage concepts.\n\u00b7\nCustomer thinks bank B's advisor is\na friendly, competent, polite, reliable\nmortgage expert, who is willing to\nhelp them with patience.\nCustomer knows his/her maximum mortgage\nloan amount (including monthly repayment\nobligation), so s/he knows in what price\ncategory to look for a house.\nCustomer knows whether a certain house is\naffordable, so s/he knows how much s/he can\nbid.\nAdvisor enters customer's personal data\ninto bank B's computer program.\nCustomer knows whether bank B is willing\nto finance the bid s/he has made on a specific\nhouse.\nthe odds are high that customers will choose a mortgage from bank B. Moreover, bank\nB's advice costs do not differ much from other financial service providers, so advisors\nhave the freedom to focus only on their personal presentation in order to convince cus-\ntomers to take up advice. Advisor purposes such as these are not explicitly mentioned\nin the consultations; we derived them from bank B's documents and checked them with\none of bank B's advisors.\nInterestingly, Table 1 immediately reveals a conflict between advisor purposes and\ncustomer purposes. The advisor will generally restrict his information to basic mortgage\noptions available to customers: bank B's policy states that advisors cannot discuss mort-\ngage safeguards other than the national mortgage guarantee (i.e. life insurance, unem-\nployment risk coverage and disability risk coverage). This information is saved for the\nadvice consultation so that customers have a reason to come back. However, customers\nwant to learn about all the decisions they are going to face in the mortgage purchase\nprocess, including the safeguards they need to choose.\nBy investigating the document collection and by analyzing the consultations, we iden-\ntified the aspect systems and thereupon the aspect system constraints that affect the inter-\naction on the advisors' side. Many of these non-purpose-related constraints are made\nexplicit in a document called `Advice quality and methods'(only available to bank insid-\ners). The introduction of this document tells us that bank B's advice quality is based on\nbank B's strategy, mission and core values and on the legal requirements as dictated by\nthe Act on Financial Supervision (WFT, 2013). This implies that advisors need to man-\nage and balance various aspect system constraints. Our contextual data led us to distin-\nguish the following six aspect systems that are relevant in the consultations:\n1. the technology aspect system, mainly constituted by the computer program that\nadvisors use in the consultations;\n2. the efficiency aspect system, which provides rules regarding the amount of time\navailable to fulfill the purposes of the consultation;\n3. the legal aspect system, which regulates the design and the amount of information\nto be provided in consultations as there is a legal requirement to provide customers\nwith correct, clear and non-misleading information (WFT, 2013: Article 4:19);\n4. the bank's customer service aspect system, which provides various regulations\nvarying from the need to provide a `warm welcome' to customers, to the need to\nmanage the customer's expectations during the talk, to the rule that no advice\nmay be given in orientation consultations;\n5. the bank's mortgage acceptance procedure, which sets the criteria to be met for\nmortgage applicants and determines the customer data that need to be elicited for\nvalid applications;\n6. the interactional pragmatic aspect system of communication, which includes\npoliteness considerations, quality maxims (i.e. providing correct information)\nand relevance maxims (providing only contributions whose relevance can be\nreconstructed by the hearer).\nOur contextual data suggested two other potentially relevant aspect systems that are\nnot referred to in the consultations:\n7. the internal communication aspect system, which, among other things, is respon-\nsible for updating the advisor on changes in mortgage acceptance criteria;\n8. the mortgage application process aspect system; for instance, the final mortgage\nquotes are not produced by the advisor, but in another business unit.\nTo the extent that these latter two aspect systems constrain the advisor's actions, these\ndo not enter in reflexive monitoring because such constraints are typically unknown. For\ninstance, when an advisor has missed a rule update, he is unaware of this.\nCollecting design explications\nWe assembled a collection of 50 design explications, in two ways. First, 10 transcripts\nwere manually screened for references to the constraints suggested by our contextual\nanalysis. Subsequently, a keyword search was done using a list of potentially relevant\nterms. The keywords included nouns such as time and costs (efficiency aspect system),\norientation consultation or advice (the bank's customer service aspect system); adjec-\ntives such as slow or fast (technological aspect system); and verbs such as obliged, may\nand allowed (legal aspect system). We do not claim that our collection exhausts our data;\ngiven the explorative nature of our study, we will not present quantitative findings.\nNot every constraint reference constitutes a design explication: sometimes constraint\nreferences are `stand-alone' ones, such as in Excerpt 2, line 4:\n01 AD: ehm and eh ehm if I eh have pictured your situation,\n02 then we will pursue a maximum\n03 mortgage loan amount calculation,\n05 AD: with aid of the computer. C1: TECHNOLOGY\nExcerpts like these are not included in the collection as the technology constraint\nreferred to here (`with aid of the computer', line 5) does not conflict with others. So, it\ndoes not pose discourse design dilemmas. In contrast, Excerpt 3 demonstrates a con-\nstraint conflict:\n01 AD: I'm going to write down your data C1: CORRECTNESS\n02 correct later, then I can adjust that too.\n03 I'm just gonna leave it like this, RESOLUTION\n04 otherwise I first have to enter C2: TECHNOLOGY+\n05 everything all over again. C3: EFFICIENCY\nThe current personal data in the computer turn out to be incorrect and require an\nupdate (line 1). This need is labeled constraint 1 (a correctness constraint deriving from\nthe bank's mortgage acceptance procedure, that is, aspect system 5). The advisor\nexplains that the computer program only allows a new address when all the data are\nreentered (lines 4\u00ad5; technology aspect system). We can also infer that satisfying both\nconstraints would considerably delay the consultation; doing things `all over again'\n(line 5) is clearly undesirable, given the economy aspect system. Her resolution here is\nto `leave it like this' for now (line 3) and suspend the required correction until after the\nconsultation (lines 1\u00ad2). This decision is made explicit so that the customer understands\nwhy she does not correct the data, which would be a natural thing to do after checking\nthem. Finally, note that Excerpt 3 shows that more than two constraints may be involved\nin a constraint conflict.\nConsidering their sequential environments, it shows that the vast majority of design\nexplications are advisor-initiated. However, there are a few cases; see for instance\nExcerpt 10 further on, in which the explication is prompted by a customer's utterance.\nSome design explications do not completely list the constraints involved. In those\ncases, we use our context analysis and the other consultations to reconstruct the conflict;\nfor example, when the advisor mentions a constraint that regularly conflicts with another\nelsewhere in the data, we assume that the second constraint is also present.\nIn principle, we may conceive of entirely implicit conflicts, in which no constraint is\nmade explicit at all. For instance, politeness phenomena may be analyzed as attempts to\nsatisfy partially incompatible constraints. But as this article is about explicit discourse\ndesign, we will leave those cases aside.\nDesign explication forms\nIn our data, design explications take three forms: references to the omission of actions or\nnon-preferred actions (A), accounts (B) and explanations (C). The first two forms may\nbe combined.\nOmission and non-preferredness references\nMany conflicts are accompanied by references to omissions of actions or non-preferred\nactions. The difference between these two is a difference of framing. In omission refer-\nences, the advisor tells the customer s/he will NOT do X as a next action even though X\nwould be desirable; in a non-preferredness reference, the advisor states s/he WILL do Y\nas a next action even though it violates a constraint. Excerpts 4 and 5 show what these\nreferences look like:\n01 AD: I always like to make acquaintance but eh, C1: PURPOSE\n02 because we have a limited amount of time C2: TIME (ACCOUNT)\n03 I think it is better to ehm yes, skip RESOLUTION\n that part. (OMMISSION)\n04 or do you say we actually prefer to know\n05 the ins and outs or\n08 CU: just eh get started right away I would say\n09 AD: yes, ok. ehm well,\n10 then I'm going to skip\n11 my own personal introduction,\n12 but I do want to know who you are\n13 what you do and what I can do for you.\nIn Excerpt 4, line 1, the advisor refers to the need for `making acquaintance', a con-\nstraint related to the bank's customer service aspect system requiring advisors to make\ncustomers feel welcome in the orientation consultation's introduction stage. In the bank's\ndocuments, this is presented as a way to create a bond with customers, which ultimately\nserves the consultation's purpose of making customers come back for advice. In line 2,\nthe advisor refers to a second constraint: `time'. This leads her to suggest skipping the\nintroduction: line 3 presents an omission reference which is explicitly accounted for; her\ncustomer agrees to this in line 9. In lines 10\u00ad11, constraint 1 and the chosen resolution\nare repeated. In order to maintain the focus on customer bonding, she continues by con-\ntrastively emphasizing that she does want to hear the customer introduce herself (lines\n12\u00ad13). Excerpt 5 shows the reference to a non-preferred next action:\n01 AD: let's see. Well, we have to eh we have C1: CORRECTNESS +\n02 to enter an eh an imaginary address. C2: TECHNOLOGY + RESOLUTION\n03 naturally, there is not an address yet NON-PREFERREDNESS\n04 but the system needs to know REPETITION C2 (ACCOUNT)\n05 what you are going to purchase.\nIn lines 1\u00ad2, the advisor refers to the computer requirement to enter a fake address in\norder to continue. This resolution is clearly non-preferred, given that lines 2\u00ad3 refer to a\ncommon-sense correctness constraint (quality maxim). Lines 4\u00ad5 explain why violating\nthis constraint is necessary, by invoking the technology constraint (`the system needs to\nknow', line 4).\nIn both Excerpts 4 and 5, the advisor adds an account for her choice of resolution. In\nboth constraint conflicts, the advisor presents certain constraints as if she has no choice\nother than to follow them: not following the time constraint in Excerpt 4 and the technol-\nogy constraint in Excerpt 5 will obstruct the consultation's progression. Hence other\nconstraints cannot be entirely satisfied.\nReferences to non-preferredness or omission do not necessarily occur with accounts,\nas we see in Excerpt 6:\n01 AD: well, do you meet with a real estate agent or not?\n03 AD: not yet. all right well then I will C1: COMPLETENESS + RESOLUTION\n04 leave it set to zero. NON-PREFERREDNESS\n05 those are obviously costs that will add up\n06 when you start seeing a real estate agent.\nThe advisor refers to a non-preferred action in lines 3\u00ad4: leaving open a field in the\ncomputer program that asks for the costs for hiring a real estate agent since the required\ninformation is not yet available. The completeness constraint conflicts with the con-\nstraint that the advisor can only use information already available.\nAccounts\nA second indication of constraint conflicts is accounting for the chosen discourse option;\nwe already saw accounts in Excerpts 4 and 5 that are similar in that they use the second\nconstraint to motivate the chosen action. The same goes for Excerpt 3, in which the effi-\nciency constraint is invoked to account for the choice of resolution. Such accounts cou-\npled with omission or non-preferredness references are always provided before or during\nthe advisor action in question.\nAccounts may also appear without references to omission or non-preferredness. In\nour data, stand-alone accounts only occur when advisors reflect on a completed verbal or\nnon-verbal action that helps achieve the consultation's purpose (implicit constraint 1) but\nmay seem to violate customer expectations. Excerpt 7 shows what this looks like:\n01 AD: yes, no, why do I pull this out? C2: RELEVANCE\n02 because ehm you can actually ACCOUNT\n03 adjust this yourself, very nicely,\n04 and then I will fix it just so that if\n05 you want to change something later,\n06 for instance the amount of the mortgage\n07 or hey then then the program will adjust\n08 the complete calculation.\nJust before the start of this excerpt, the advisor opens an Excel sheet without announc-\ning why. This sheet can be used by customers if they want to make a maximum mortgage\nloan amount calculation at home and adjust the interest rate periods to see how much\nthey can borrow under what interest rate circumstances. So, it is an extra service to cus-\ntomers (implicit constraint 1, purpose based). However, once the advisor has presented\nthe sheet he realizes that his customers may not understand the relevance of his behavior;\nthis constraint of `clarity of relevance' is referred to in line 1 which prefaces the account.\nExplanations\nA third form for explications is the use of explanations. Explanations are about legal\nrequirements or the bank's mortgage acceptance procedure. This focus on legislation and\nrules designed elsewhere distinguishes them from accounts, which are always concerned\nwith verbal and non-verbal advisor behaviors. Explanations signal that advisors assume\nthat such rule constraints may conflict with customer expectations (hence the second\nconstraint in the conflict is that the advisor's actions need to follow customer expecta-\ntions). In such cases, the advisor explicitly refers to the policy or legal constraint to be\nexplained, while the `expectation compatibility' constraint is to be inferred. This is\nshown in Excerpt 8:\n01 AD: ehm yes what naturally will be what naturally will be\n02 a ehm ehm because this is actually an orientation consultation\n04 AD: so since January 1st there have been quite a few changes\n06 AD: eh and one of the things that has been changed is in the past\n07 yes you went shopping at different eh money providers\n09 AD: eh you were just given a free advice and then you decided\n10 where you wanted to purchase your mortgage\n12 AD: well, that has indeed changed a bit since January 1st\n13 so now it's the case if you really want to get advice then\n14 you are going to pay for that.\nThe customer in Excerpt 8 just told the advisor that he intends to go shopping at dif-\nferent mortgage providers for the best offer. The advisor responds by contrasting the\nnature of the consultation (actually) with the expectation that the customer seems to\nharbor. Given the new rules as of January 2013, the current consultation is meant for\norientation only (lines 2 and 4). In the old days, when these customers purchased their\nfirst mortgage (lines 6\u00ad10), mortgage offers could be made directly in the first consulta-\ntion; nowadays, they are made in a second consultation that will need to be paid for (lines\n12\u00ad14). The upshot is that it will cost the customer a lot of money to shop around for\ntailored mortgage offers.\nIn Excerpt 8 the advisor starts explaining the legal changes as of 1 January in response\nto the customer's presentation of his reason for coming. In contrast, other explanations\n(see Excerpt 9) anticipate customer expectations; this kind of anticipation is desirable\ngiven the bank's customer service aspect system.\nReviewing the various explication forms, we may note a difference between explana-\ntions and free-standing accounts on the one hand and omission and non-preferredness\nreferences on the other. In free-standing accounts and explanations, the customers need\nto be brought `on board' with the consultation's design. Once they are, the constraint\nconflict is eliminated here and now. In contrast, the conflicts underlying omissions and\nnon-preferredness references remain in place once the consultation is over. This leads us\nto consider the different kinds of conflict resolutions.\nConstraint conflict resolution strategies\nWe have seen that discourse design explications present both the design problem and the\nsolution, that is, some way to resolve the constraint conflict in order to be able to con-\ntinue their consultation. Three kinds of resolutions can be distinguished:\nA. dropping the losing constraint;\nB. suspending the losing constraint;\nC. integrating both constraints.\nWhen advisors drop a constraint, they fully comply with the other constraint in the con-\nflict. If we look back at our examples, Excerpt 4 presents a case of dropping, in that the\npurpose constraint of bonding with the customer (in order to make them return) is not\nfully satisfied. This compromises the effectiveness of the consultation somewhat.\nSuspending a constraint is postponing its satisfaction. It will be complied with, however,\nfurther on in the consultation or once the consultation is finished. Cases in point are\nfound in Excerpts 3, 5 and 6. In Excerpt 3, the advisor suspends correcting the faulty\naddress. In Excerpt 5, she enters a fake address until the actual address will be known. In\norder not to compromise the advisor's credibility, these `shortcuts' are presented as tech-\nnical fixes only, dissociated from the substance of the orientation. Excerpt 6 is also a case\nof suspending, in that the advisor postpones the satisfaction of the complete information\nconstraint.\nThe final option is to find a way of satisfying both constraints: constraint integration.\nThis means that neither of the constraints is dropped or suspended.\nConstraint integration is a possible outcome in Excerpts 7 and 8. In both cases, we see\nattempts to bring the customer's expectations in line with the advisor's course of action\nor the bank's policies. To the extent that these attempts succeed, this satisfies both con-\nstraints at issue. However, to the extent that the customer remains puzzled or uncon-\nvinced, the expectation compatibility constraint will need to be given up.\nA more complex case involving a combination of suspension and integration is the\ndesign explication in Excerpt 9. Here, the customers are expecting a baby and want to\nbuy a house before the woman has given birth. They list a lot of questions and (presum-\nably) expect the advisor to answer them (customer expectations). However, the advisor\nalso needs to fill out bank B's computer program (consultation purpose constraint). Now,\nimmediately starting up the computer program seems to violate the constraint of being\nhelpful and friendly. Hence the advisor assures the customers that running the program\nwill allow answering their questions along the way:\n01 AD: let's see. what I will do, I will ehm\n02 simply start up the mortgage computer program and then\n03 we will go- go through it and then we will automatically\n04 encounter lots of things ehm that are important\n05 for a number of decisions that you will have to make\n06 ehm and then along the way I will simply\n07 tell you eh a few things about for instance,\n08 how you can repay your debt\n09 eh what is important when buying the house,\n10 eh what options there are regarding interest rate periods\n11 well, we'll cover it all,\n12 so we'll just go through things\nSo, in Excerpt 9 the advisor suspends answering the customer's questions in order to\nserve the consultation's purpose of entering the customer data. In presenting this resolu-\ntion, she emphasizes that actually there is no conflict between running the program and\nanswering questions, as the program will lead the user through all the important deci-\nsions (lines 4\u00ad7). She minimizes the effort of running through it all and at the same time\ndiscussing important information by using mitigations, such as `simply'(line 2/6), `auto-\nmatically' (line 3), `a few' (line 7) and `just' (line 12).\nTotheextentthatheraccountisconvincing,shesucceedsinactuallyintegratingconstraints.\nOverall, Excerpt 9 confirms the impression from Excerpts 7 and 8 that constraint integration in\nour data mainly occurs in the context of managing customer expectations. This suggests that\nexpectation compatibility constraints can be satisfied on the spot, that is, by being persuasive,\nwithout hurting other constraints; in contrast, other conflicts require a compromise.\nSeeking customer acceptance for conflict resolutions\nWe have shown in various shapes of discourse design explications and have explained\nhow they propose to resolve constraint conflicts. Finally, we will review some presenta-\ntion strategies that invite customers to accept these resolution proposals. Seeking cus-\ntomer acceptance is a regular feature, as three out of every four discourse design\nexplications is accompanied by one of the strategies outlined below.\nPositive framing\nAdvisors try to `balance' announcements of not doing something by emphasizing what\nstill will be done. In Excerpt 10, the advisor needs to manage customer expectations\npotentially conflicting with bank policies regarding advice-giving:\n01 AD: eh in this first consultation,\n02 which is this conversation\n04 AD: it is an orientation consultation\n06 AD: ehm I will not provide advice regarding\n07 yes what you have to do in case of dying eh\n09 AD: of unemployment, of eh risks.\n10 but I do point out what possibilities you have\n11 and I will tell you about the eh interest rates\n12 we employ at this moment.\nThe advisor tells the customer that their current talks is an orientation (lines 1\u00ad4) and\nthat she will not provide advice about any mortgage risks (lines 6\u00ad9). In this excerpt she\ndoes not provide an account for that policy, but we know that she has mentioned the legal\nchanges as of 1 January earlier in the consultation. However, after she announces she will\nnot provide advice, which may seem to the customer as if she is unwilling to provide\nservice, she tries to reframe this into something positive by emphasizing all the things\nshe actually is willing to do in the remainder of her consultation (lines 10\u00ad12).\nWe have seen a similar transition in Excerpt 4. The advisor tells the customer that she\nwill skip her own personal introduction (line 10\u00ad11), but then she sums up everything\nshe is interested in regarding her customer. So, refusals to comply with customer expec-\ntations are regularly followed by some good news that makes the refusal a less categori-\ncal one. The positive component is emphasized by its final position in the discourse unit.\nMinimizing the problem\nThe next strategy we identified is downplaying the disadvantages of the conflict resolu-\ntion, shown in Excerpt 11:\n01 AD: ehm well, then we'll simply do it in another way\n02 I will eh just take out our old eh mortgage program\n03 then I can at least make a few calculations.\n04 ehm and then I will just do eh this eh\nJust before the start of the excerpt, the advisor has experienced troubles with the new\nmortgage loan calculation program. He uses an older application to resolve this issue.\nThis is clearly a non-preferred option, but it seems the only way to save the consulta-\ntion's purpose. Just as we have seen in Excerpt 9, the resolution is presented using a\nrange of adverbials and adjectives that minimize the consequences of the make-do\nsolution.\nRequesting customer consent\nThe last strategy is requesting customer consent, which was already shown in Excerpt 4.\nHere, the advisor explains that she usually likes to make acquaintances but that time does\nnot allow for this right now. She then asks her customer whether he agrees with skipping\nit or whether he would like to know `the ins and outs'. Consent requests such as these\nvary in their openness to customer input. Occasionally advisors actually ask customers\nwhich constraint they feel should be prioritized, but mostly they clearly project their\npreferred reaction by using Yes/No interrogatives. Excerpt 12 illustrates how this is\ndone:\n01 CU: and then what is the difference with annuity?\n02 that is also repaying?\n04 CU: but then without investments?\n05 AD: correct, that's correct. that's what I'll show you later if\n07 AD: if i may just put aside that question for a moment?\n08 CU: yes no that's allright\nIn line 7 the advisor suggests suspending his customer's question as he will automati-\ncally get round to answering it later on. In our data, customers never fail to comply with\nthe advisor's suggested conflict resolutions.\nConclusion and discussion\nIn this article we have explored discourse design explications: stretches of talk that refer\nto contextual constraint conflicts and propose resolutions for these. The explications were\nidentified by a combination of top-down and bottom-up strategies. A contextual analysis\nwas used to identify explications, which were then analyzed in terms of form, proposed\nresolutions and interactional shape. We showed that discourse design explications take the\nform of references to omitted or non-preferred actions, accounts or explanations. Three\nstrategies are used to resolve constraint conflicts: the advisor drops one of the constraints,\nsuspends one of them or attempts to eliminate the conflict altogether. Finally, we showed\nhow advisors seek customer acceptance of their design proposals by positive framing of\ntheir resolution, minimizing the problem or requesting customer consent.\nTo our knowledge, explicit design explications have not been analyzed in earlier\ndiscourse-analytical work. Nevertheless, their regular occurrence is interesting from\nvarious points of view. First, they are an important exception to the tendency for contex-\ntual constraints to remain invisible in interactions; hence they offer a window on how\ninstitutional agents navigate the discourse design space. Far from reducing opportunities\nfor `agency', complex constraint sets invite displays of discourse design skills, of which\ndesign explications are the most visible specimen. Hence they create new perspectives\nfor the analysis of institutional discourse. Moreover, our method of conceptualizing con-\ntextual constraints with reference to purposes and aspect systems constitutes a principled\nway of linking organizational contexts and interaction analysis, which may be of interest\nfor research into organizational communication.\nOf more specific relevance to this particular discourse context is the fact that these\ndisplays of advisor skills are at the same time displays of customer centeredness: while\nproviding their consultation services, the advisors are also keen on demonstrating how\nthey optimize these services to suit the customers'needs. While the agent\u00adcustomer rela-\ntion is clearly asymmetrical with regard to knowledge and power, projecting a client-\ncentered image is an important interactional concern of the agents; of course, this furthers\nthe consultation purpose of making the customer return to purchase his mortgage at this\nparticular bank.\nOur research has practical implications as well. Investigating discourse design expli-\ncations highlights the moments when the interaction is under `functional strain', that is,\nit identifies ways in which the context challenges the participants. While these chal-\nlenges are primarily addressed in the interactions themselves, the organization may also\nconsider interventions to modify the context: some complexities may need to be\naddressed by the management instead of by institutional agents and clients. For instance,\nour explications show that the computer program regularly leads to problems, which\nclearly invites software improvements. Similarly, the new policies of the Dutch govern-\nment regarding advice-giving on mortgages require considerable interactional work.\nPossibly, some of this explanatory work could be moved to other communication media\nso that the face-to-face contact is not burdened by it.\nHaving pointed out potential uses of our analysis, we hasten to add that we have cer-\ntainly not been exhaustive in identifying constraint conflicts in our consultations, as\nsome conflicts will probably not surface in the interaction. First, most customers lack the\nexpertise to fully pursue the purpose of `understanding the issues that need to be decided\nupon when purchasing a mortgage', as the average citizen is not aware of the various\nkinds of risk that a mortgage consumer needs to reckon with. As long as the advisor does\nnot bring up these risks, customers will generally not ask for them. Second, customers\nare not very active in voicing information requests or agenda setting. Hence, our explica-\ntions mainly concern design problems that immediately threaten the flow of interaction\nand therefore need to be shared with their customers. In other words, our set of expli-\ncated problems is a relatively restricted one. Conceivably, other contexts will provide us\nwith more ambitious forms of explicit discourse design.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship,\nand/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this\narticle.\nReferences\nAakhus M and Jackson S (2005) Technology, interaction, and design.
