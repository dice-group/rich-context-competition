In-home interviews, observed medications, and A1C were used to stratify by diagnosed\ndiabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, or no diabetes. Logistic regression was used to model associa-\ntions between diabetes conditions and sexual characteristics, separately by gender.\nRESULTS -- The survey response rate was 75.5%. More than 60% of partnered individuals\nwith diagnosed diabetes were sexually active. Women with diagnosed diabetes were less likely\nwomen (0.63 [0.45\u00ad0.87]) to besexually active. Partnered sexual behaviors did not differ by gender\nor diabetes status. The prevalence of orgasm problems was similarly elevated among men with\ndiagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes compared with that for other men, but erectile difficulties\nundiagnosed diabetes were less likely to have discussed sex with a physician (11%) than women\nwith diagnosed diabetes (19%) and men with undiagnosed (28%) or diagnosed (47%) diabetes.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Many middle-age and older adults with diabetes are sexually active and\nengage in sexual behaviors similarly to individuals without diabetes. Women with diabetes were\nmore likely than men to cease all sexual activity. Older women with diabetes are as likely to have\nsexual problems but are significantly less likely than men to discuss them.\nAdvances in treatment for diabetes\nhave prolonged and improved\nquality of life for many of the 12\nmillion affected individuals aged 60\nyears in the U.S. Clinical guidelines for\ndiabetes care include assessment and\ntreatment of erectile problems in men (1).\nSexual problems may be a warning sign of\ndiabetes or a consequence that can lead to\ndepression, lack of adherence to treat-\nment, and strained intimate relationships.\nIn contrast, older women's sexual issues\nhave been largely overlooked in screening\nfor and treating diabetes (1,2). Failure to\nrecognize and address sexual issues\namong middle-aged and older adults with\ndiabetes may impair quality of life and\nadaptation to the disease.\nSome adults with diabetes maintain\nsexual relationships throughout their\nlives (3). Prior studies have focused on the\npathophysiological effects of diabetes on\nmale sexual function, primarily erection\nand sexual desire. The effects of diabetes\non women's sexual functioning are poorly\nunderstood and probably multifactorial\n(2). Sexual problems in adults with dia-\nbetes have been associated with age, dis-\nease duration, and comorbidity (1). The\neffects of chronic hyperglycemia, degree\nof diabetes control, or use of glucose-\nlowering drugs are less clear (4), in part\nbecause individuals with undiagnosed or\npreclinical diabetes are typically aggre-\ngated with control subjects in other stud-\nies (1). Psychosocial correlates of sexual\nproblems in individuals with diagnosed\ndiabetes have been found in younger\nadults. Studies including older adults find\nassociations with depression (1), vulner-\nability, lifestyle restrictions due to disease\nmanagement (5), and marital conflict (6).\nPrior data on sexuality in individuals\nwith diabetes were derived primarily\nfrom studies that are small, have not in-\ncluded very old individuals or aggregated\nindividuals 65 years, lacked a compar-\nison group, and relied on convenience or\nother nongeneralizable samples (1,2).\nComprehensive, population-based data\nare needed to further physicians' under-\nstanding of the sexual norms and prob-\nlems of older adults with diagnosed and\nundiagnosed diabetes. Virtually nothing\nis known about sexual function among\nindividuals with undiagnosed diabetes;\nthis information could be relevant for di-\nagnosis, motivation to engage in treat-\nment, and prevention of sexual and\nnonsexual diabetes-related complica-\ntions.

Sex was defined as \"any mutually vol-\nuntary activity with another person that\ninvolves sexual contact, whether or not\nintercourse or orgasm occurs.\" Sexually\nactive respondents were asked about the\npresence of sexual problems selected on\nthe basis of diagnostic and clinical criteria\nfor sexual dysfunction (3). All respon-\ndents who had not had sex in the previous\n3 months were asked to indicate why\nfrom a list of reasons (3). A self-\nadministered questionnaire completed\nduring the in-home interview asked\nabout the frequency of masturbation, de-\nfined as \"stimulating your genitals (sex or-\ngans) for sexual pleasure, not with a sex\npartner,\" and ascertained whether orgasm\noccurred with masturbation. Questions\nabout sexual activity and problems were\ndeclined to answer the questions regard-\ning masturbation.\n  status classification\nIndividuals were classified as having \"di-\nagnosed diabetes,\" regardless of their A1C\nvalue, if they responded that they had\nbeen told by a physician that they had\ndiabetes or if they were using one or more\ndiabetes medications. To identify individ-\nuals with \"undiagnosed diabetes,\" we\nused an A1C cut point of 6.0% based on\nthe correlation of A1C with the traditional\nfasting glucose criterion in older individ-\nuals. This A1C cut point for identifying\nundiagnosed diabetes was selected based\non a sensitivity/specificity analysis of data\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\nparing different A1C cut points with di-\nagnosis of diabetes based on fasting\nglucose levels, an A1C cut point of 6.0%\nmaximized specificity of the assay for de-\ntecting undiagnosed diabetes without\ncompromising sensitivity for all cut\nfor women) (supplementary Fig. 1, avail-\nable in an online appendix at http://care.\ndiabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc10-\ndiagnosed diabetes were classified as hav-\ning \"no diabetes\" if their A1C value was\n6.0% and were classified as having \"un-\ndiagnosed diabetes\" if their A1C value\nwas 6.0% (supplementary Fig. 1A).

Respondents were\nasked whether a medical doctor had ever\ntold them they had any of several com-\nmon diabetes-related complications (Ta-\nble 1). Communication with a physician\nabout sexual matters since age 50 was as-\nsessed as described previously (3). De-\npressive symptoms were assessed using\nthe 11-item short form of the Center for\nEpidemiological Studies-Depression\n(CES-D) index (16), with response op-\ntions 0\u00ad3; a score 9 was considered in-\ndicative of a clinically significant level of\ndepressive symptoms, consistent with a\nData analysis\nThe analytic sample consisted of the\n1,993 participants for whom diabetes sta-\ntus could be determined based on A1C,\nmedication data, and/or self-report (sup-\nplementary Fig. 2A).\nDemographic and clinical character-\nistics were estimated separately within\neach of the three diabetes status groups by\ngender. Bivariate associations with diabe-\ntes status were tested using the Rao and\nScott (18) correction to the 2 test to ac-\ncount for the survey design. Logistic re-\ngression was used to model associations\nbetween diabetes conditions and sexual\nactivity, behavior, and problems sepa-\nrately by gender.\nAll models were adjusted for age-\ndepressive symptoms (CES-D scores 9\nvs. 9), and the modified Charlson co-\nfor outcomes with too few individuals in\neither outcome category to support a fully\nadjusted model (19).

Approximately one-third of\nsexually active men and women with sex-\nual problems reported avoiding sex be-\ncause of problems (Table 3); this number\ndid not vary by diabetes status.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Our findings,\nbased on nationally representative U.S.\ndata, indicate that two-thirds of men and\napproximately one-third of women aged\nactive. Although diabetes was associated\nwith a higher rate of sexual inactivity,\nthose who were active participated in\npartnered sexual behaviors and activity at\na rate similar to that of those without di-\nabetes. As a group, the majority of indi-\nviduals with diabetes were married or\nliving with a partner, although women\nwith diabetes were more likely to be\nalone. Sexually active adults with diabetes\nhad a similar prevalence of sexual prob-\nlems, and women were more likely than\nmen to avoid sex because of these prob-\nlems. However, fewer than one in five\nwomen with diagnosed diabetes com-\npared with nearly half of men had dis-\ncussed sex with a physician. Individuals\nwith undiagnosed diabetes, particularly\nwomen, were even less likely than others\nto have discussed sex with a physician.\nIn this study, we combined self-\nreport measures, medication, and biolog-\nical measures from a population-based\nprobability sample to stratify individuals\nas having diagnosed, undiagnosed, or no\ndiabetes. There is not yet full agreement\nabout using A1C to diagnose diabetes in\ngenerated estimated prevalences of diag-\nnosed and undiagnosed diabetes compa-\nestimates using fasting plasma glucose\nand/or oral glucose tolerance testing for\ncommunity-residing individuals aged\n60 years (among those with A1C re-\nhad diagnosed diabetes, whereas 19%\nof men had undiagnosed diabetes) (21).\nRepetition of the analyses shown here us-\ning a 6.5% glycosylated hemoglobin\nthreshold for diabetes classification in this\npopulation yielded few qualitative differ-\nences in the outcomes of interest but did\nresult in a far smaller undiagnosed dia-\nmen) than found by classification based\non traditional diagnostic criteria. Using\neither threshold, as a group, individuals\nwith undiagnosed diabetes are different\nfrom those with diagnosed diabetes in\ntwo important ways. First, those with un-\ndiagnosed diabetes seemed to be earlier in\nthe course of the disease. Second, undiag-\nnosed diabetes is a pathophysiological\nstate that lacks the psychological burden\nand/or social stigma associated with hav-\ning diagnosed diabetes (5).\nThe etiology of sexual problems as-\nsociated with undiagnosed diabetes\n(controlling for other physical and psy-\nchological factors known to be associated\nwith sexual problems) might reflect a pre-\ndominant physiological mechanism\nwhereas the etiology of sexual problems\nassociated with diagnosed diabetes might\nbe more likely to have an additional, dia-\nbetes-specific psychosocial component.\nAlthough cross-sectional data cannot de-\ntermine the causal direction of such rela-\ntionships, understanding the sexuality of\nindividuals with undiagnosed compared\nwith that of those with diagnosed and no\ndiabetes can shed light on the pathological\nmechanisms and the natural history of both\ndiabetes and sexual dysfunction in later life.\nIn this study, aside from the expected\nhigher prevalence of erectile dysfunction\nin men with diagnosed diabetes (55%)\n(1), the prevalence of many sexual prob-\nlems did not differ significantly according\nto diabetes status. Dropping out from sex-\nual activity may partly explain the lack of\na diabetes association with sexual prob-\nlems, especially in women. This finding is\nsuggested by the significantly higher\nprevalence of sexual inactivity among\nwomen with diagnosed diabetes com-\npared with that for men and a greater lack\nof interest in sex among sexually inactive\nwomen with diabetes compared with\nthose without. Furthermore, women with\ndiabetes (diagnosed and undiagnosed)\nwere nearly half as likely as other women\nto report masturbating, suggesting a re-\nduction in sexual drive that was indepen-\ndent of partner status and of knowledge of\nthe disease. The prevalence of masturbation\nwas also lower in men with diagnosed or\nundiagnosed diabetes compared with that\nin men without but was three times higher\nthan in women with diabetes (45%).\nInterestingly, the rate of erectile dys-\nfunction was not markedly elevated in\nmen with undiagnosed diabetes (36 vs.\n32% in men without diabetes), but the\ninability to experience orgasm was high\nand comparable to that of men with diag-\nout diabetes). This finding suggests that\nloss of orgasmic function may not only\noccur as a consequence of erectile dys-\nfunction as described by others (22) but\nalso may actually precede erectile dys-\nfunction, at least as perceived by some\nmen with diabetes. In women, inability to\nexperience orgasm with masturbation\nwas also significantly higher among those\nLindau and Associates\nTable 3--Sexual problems associated with diabetes conditions in sexually active men and women\nCharacteristic\nNo.\nrespondents\nTotal (overall)\nDiagnosed\ndiabetes\nUndiagnosed\ndiabetes No diabetes\nUndiagnosed vs.\ndiagnosed diabetes\nNo diabetes vs.\ndiagnosed diabetes\nLack of interest in sex\nInability to climax\nClimaxing too quickly\nPain during intercourse\nSex not pleasurable\nAnxiety about performance\nDifficulty achieving or\nmaintaining an erection\nDifficulty with lubrication\nAvoidance of sex because of\nsexual problems\u00b6\nInability to experience orgasm\nwith masturbation\n(never/rarely/sometimes)**\n*All odds ratios are adjusted for age-group, comorbidities, and depression unless otherwise noted.

Answer options included never,\nrarely, and sometimes. It was asked of everyone who reported masturbation, not exclusively of those who were sexually active. Odds ratio was significant at P  0.05.\nSexuality and diabetes\nwith diagnosed diabetes. Physicians who\ndo ask about sexual function tend to en-\ngage patients with partners (23) and focus\non male erectile issues for which treat-\nment is readily available. Asking about or-\ngasm function in relation to partnered sex\nand masturbation and expanding these\ndiscussions to include women may assist\nin prevention of downstream sexual\nproblems and personal and interpersonal\ndistress and in earlier diagnosis of diabe-\ntes in some individuals. Although no\npharmacological treatment is approved as\na remedy for anorgasmia, interventions\nsuch as education to inform the patient\nthat anorgasmia is known to occur for a\nsubstantial proportion of sexually active\nindividuals with diabetes, directed mas-\nturbation, use of a clitoral pump in\nwomen, and discussion of ways to en-\nhance sexual arousal and intimacy can be\ntherapeutic.\nMedications are another important\niatrogenic etiology of later-life sexual\nproblems (24). Glucose-lowering medi-\ncations are largely thought to improve\nsexual function by mitigating glycemic-\nrelated microvascular damage, as seen in\nclinical studies of erectile function in men\nwith diabetes (4). The stratification strat-\negy used in our study classifies all individ-\nuals taking glucose-lowering medications\nas having diagnosed diabetes. This strat-\negy would tend to underestimate the as-\nsociation between diagnosed diabetes and\nsexual function, particularly for the sub-\ngroup with uncontrolled diabetes. How-\never, other medications used to treat\ndiabetes, including antihypertensive and\ncholesterol-lowering drugs, may have\ndeleterious effects on sexual function\n(24). Because of sample size, this study is\nlimited by an inability to account for the\neffects of other medications in estimating\nthe association between diabetes status\nand aspects of sexuality. Prospective clin-\nical trials are needed to fully elucidate the\neffects and interactions of medications on\nsexual activity and function among mid-\ndle-age and older adults with diabetes;\nvirtually nothing is documented about\nthe effects of diabetes medications on sex-\nuality in older women.\nThe prevalence of specific sexual\nproblems was only assessed for those who\nwere sexually active in the prior 12\nmonths, therefore underestimating the\nprevalence of sexual problems in this\npopulation. Next, in addition to the ex-\npected differences in population preva-\nlence estimates for undiagnosed diabetes,\nreanalysis using a glycosylated hemoglo-\nbin cut point criterion of 6.5% results in\ndifferences between the groups for some\noutcomes, in part because of loss of pre-\ncision in estimates. For example, the rate\nof erectile dysfunction was still higher in\nmen with undiagnosed diabetes (40.5%)\ncompared with that of men without dia-\nbetes (32.1%), but the AOR comparing\nthese two groups was no longer signifi-\nstantive differences were found in\ndiabetes status comparisons among socio-\ndemographic, health, or communication\nvariables. As with virtually all clinical and\npopulation-based research on human\nsexuality, these data were self-reported,\nalthough the interview methods are\nwidely accepted as being valid (25). Use\nof a population-based probability sample\nadds to prior knowledge (1,2) about later-\nlife diabetes and sexuality by disaggregat-\ning individuals with undiagnosed or\npreclinical diabetes from those with no\ndiabetes. This study builds on prior work\nby filling a void of information about\nolder women's sexuality and gender dif-\nferences in sexuality among middle-age\nand older adults with diabetes. Further\nresearch should be powered to also look\nat age-group comparisons.\nIn conclusion, many middle-aged\nand older adults with diabetes are sexu-\nally active. Sexual problems are common\nbut are infrequently discussed with phy-\nsicians, especially among women. Physi-\ncian knowledge about sexuality in\nrelation to diabetes should improve pa-\ntient education and counseling, as well as\nthe identification of symptoms that could\nsignal undiagnosed disease or a high risk\nfor disease. Attention to potentially treat-\nable sexual problems in middle-aged and\nolder adults with diabetes should im-\nprove quality of life and enhance overall\ndiabetes management.\n"
