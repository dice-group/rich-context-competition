Serum 25-\nhydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is the preferred indicator of\nvitamin D status, because it reflects both dietary intake and\nphotoconversion of vitamin D precursors in the skin on\nexposure to UV radiation.(1) Most data relating vitamin D\nto fracture risk to date have come either from randomized\nclinical trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplements or from\nretrospective case-control studies, in which vitamin D status\nis compared between fracture cases and noncases at the\ntime of fracture or shortly after the fracture has occurred.\nResults from the case-control studies support a role for\nserum 25(OH)D in fracture risk,(2\u00ad7) but their study design\nis not optimal because vitamin D status could be affected by\nthe fracture. Results from RCTs, which use a rigorous study\ndesign, have conflicted,(8\u00ad11) possibly because the initial vi-\ntamin D status of the study population was not clearly de-\nfined. In specific, most RCTs published to date collected\nserum 25(OH)D data for a subset of study participants\nonly. The possibility that initial vitamin D status of the\nstudy sample in these RCTS differed has been cited as an\nexplanation for their disparate results, because individuals\nwith greater degrees of deficiency are likely to benefit from\nsupplemental vitamin D more than individuals with milder\nOther problems have been noted with RCTs, such as\nnoncompliance, loss of subjects because of dropout, and,\nThe authors state that they have no conflicts of interest.\nNational Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, Maryland, USA.\n\u00a9 2008 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research\nfor studies of nutrients like vitamin D, inability to ethically\ncreate a control group with no or very low intake of the\nnutrient.(14) As a result, cohort studies may be able to pro-\nvide data to complement information obtained in RCTs.\nHowever, to date, only a small number of prospective ob-\nservational studies have related serum 25(OH)D to fracture\nrisk. Several have focused on ill patients and are limited to\na small number of fracture cases.(15\u00ad17) Two exceptions\ncome from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF)(18)\nand the Malmo Osteoporosis Prospective Risk Assessment\n(OPRA) study.(19) Results from SOF indicated a protective\nrelationship between the active circulating form of vitamin\nD (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), but not with serum 25(OH)D\nnM were associated with a significantly increased risk of\nfracture, but values <75 nM were not.(19)\nTo help fill the gap in information about serum 25(OH)D\nand fracture risk, this study uses prospective data to exam-\nine the relationship between serum 25(OH)D and hip frac-\nture risk in older U.S. white adults. We examined this re-\nlationship using serum 25(OH)D data collected in the third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nsessed using linked mortality and Medicare records for\nNHANES III participants.\nSample\nThe baseline data for this study came from NHANES III,\nwhich was conducted by the National Center for Health\nStatistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion, to assess the health and nutritional status of a large\nrepresentative sample of the noninstitutionalized, civilian\npopulation of the United States. Data were collected in\nNHANES III through household interviews and standard-\nized physical examinations conducted in specially equipped\nmobile examination centers.(20) NHANES III participants\nself-reported their race and ethnicity using categories based\non the 1977 Office of Management and Budget direc-\ntive.(21) The NCHS Institutional Review Board approved\nall procedures in the survey, and all subjects provided writ-\nten informed consent.\nThe study was given a longitudinal component by using\nlinked data from Medicare enrollment and claims records\nand from the NHANES III Linked Mortality File. Medi-\ncare enrollment and use data were available for NHANES\nIII respondents who agreed to provide personal identifica-\nvalidated and matched with Medicare administrative re-\ncords. Medicare claims data were provided from 1991\nthrough 2000 for respondents who participated in fee-for-\nservice care (claims data were not available for those who\nenrolled in Medicare managed care plans). In this study,\nclaims data from the following files were used: Medicare\nProvider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) Inpatient Hos-\npital Stay File, MEDPAR Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF)\nFile, Carrier Standard Analytic File, and Outpatient Stan-\ndard Analytic File. The Medicare Denominator files were\nused to restrict the analytic sample to those who were suc-\ncessfully matched to the Medicare claims data, as well as to\nobtain information about enrollment in managed care\nplans.\nVital status of study participants was determined from\nthe NHANES III Linked Mortality File.(23) This file con-\ntains mortality follow-up data based on a probabilistic\nmatch between the eligible NHANES III sample and the\nNational Death Index (NDI). Vital status data are available\nfor individuals from the date of their participation in the\ntion to data on vital status, information on underlying and\nmultiple causes of death are available in this file.\nThe analytic sample in this study was restricted to indi-\nviduals 65 yr of age at the time of their NHANES III\ninterview at baseline, because Medicare provides compre-\nhensive health care for roughly 98% of the U.S. population\nin this age range.(24) The sample was also restricted to non-\nHispanic whites, because there was an insufficient number\nof hip fracture cases in other race/ethnic groups to permit\nseparate analyses by this variable, and differences in cal-\ncium and vitamin D metabolism between races could sig-\nnificantly complicate interpretation of results for all races\nage who were interviewed and examined in NHANES III at\nbaseline, the following were excluded: (1) 90 persons who\ndid not match the Medicare files; (2) 1 person who lacked\ncause of death information on their death certificate; (3) 5\npersons who were lost to follow-up; (4) 121 prevalent hip\nfracture cases at baseline; (5) 84 individuals who were en-\nrolled in Medicare managed care plans at the time of their\nbaseline examination; and (6) 322 persons with missing data\nfor serum 25(OH)D or for any of the other confounding\nvariables used in the multivariate models. After excluding a\neligible individuals were included in the final analytic\nsample.\nWe compared descriptive characteristics and risk factors\nbetween the analytic sample and persons who were ex-\ncluded from the analytic sample to assess the potential for\nnonresponse bias in our results. The respondents who were\nexcluded from our sample differed significantly from the\nanalytic sample as follows: they were older (75 versus 73\nwere also more likely to report poor/fair health (33% versus\n26%), more likely to have had a fracture before baseline\n(30% versus 12%), and more likely to report being less\nphysically active than others of their same age and sex (22%\nHip fracture case identification\nHip fracture cases were identified using diagnosis and\nprocedure codes from the linked Medicare records or cause\nof death information from the NHANES III Linked Mor-\ntality File.\nHip fracture cases were defined from Medicare records\nusing an approach that was developed by Ray et al.(25)\nbased on a study in which they compared data collected\nfrom medical records with Medicare claims data. Following\nthis approach, we used medical records from both hospital\n(MEDPAR Inpatient Hospital Stay File) and nonhospital\n(MEDPAR Skilled Nursing Facility File, Carrier Standard\nAnalytic File, and Outpatient Standard Analytic File) files\nto identify hip fracture cases. Criteria for defining hip frac-\nture depended on the source of the medical record (gener-\nally more stringent for nonhospital files than hospital files)\nand type of code (generally more stringent for procedure\ncodes than for diagnosis codes). For example, persons with\nan inpatient hospital medical record containing a diagnosis\nprovided was defined as a hip fracture case unless there was\na concurrent code indicating care for a previous fracture or\nother bone disease. However, persons with a hospital inpa-\ntient medical record containing ICD codes for procedures\nrelated to hip fracture but without a diagnosis code had to\nhave a concurrent carrier, outpatient, or SNF medical re-\ncord with a diagnosis code of 820. An exception to the\nrequirement for a concurrent procedure and diagnosis code\nwas made for persons with a carrier, outpatient, or SNF\nmedical record containing Current Procedural Terminology\n(CPT) codes for selected surgical procedures related to the\nhip; presence of these CPT codes was considered sufficient\nto define a case without a concurrent diagnosis code. De-\ntails regarding the definition of cases from Medicare re-\ncords, including specific codes, are provided in Appendix 1.\nS72.2 listed as an underlying or multiple cause of death on\ntheir death certificate were also considered to be hip frac-\nture cases.\nA total of 156 hip fracture cases were identified in the\nanalytic sample used in this study: 14 cases were identified\nfrom both Medicare and death records, 140 cases were\nidentified from Medicare records only, and 2 cases were\nidentified from death records only.\nThe vast majority of cases (n  143; 92%) in our analytic\nsample had diagnoses consistent with hip fracture on re-\ncords from more than one source (e.g., inpatient hospital,\nSNF, carrier, outpatient and/or death records). Likewise,\n88% of those with a hospital record containing a discharge\ndiagnosis of 820 also had relevant surgical codes for hip\nfracture.\nWe did not exclude cases on the basis of trauma, because\nrecent data suggest that osteoporosis may contribute to\nfractures associated with high trauma.(26) There were 20 hip\nfracture cases with ICD codes consistent with trauma (ICD-\nVariables\nSerum 25(OH)D was assayed with a radioimmunoassay\n(RIA) kit (DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN, USA) at the primary\nenvironmental and nutrition health laboratory for\nNHANES at the National Center for Environmental\nHealth, CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA. The assay CV was 10\u00ad\nratory in the international Vitamin D External Quality As-\nsessment Scheme (DEQAS) proficiency testing program\nwas excellent. Details of the assay method have been pub-\nlished elsewhere.(28)\nSerum 25(OH)D was examined both as a continuous and\ncategorical variable. Categories were created using several\ncategories were chosen in part because they provided a\nsufficient number of fracture cases above and below the\ncut-off value. In addition, they reflect the range of different\nvalues that have proposed as reflecting optimal vitamin D\ntiles based on the serum 25(OH)D distribution observed in\nfracture cases.\nSeveral potential confounding variables were evaluated\nfor use in multivariate models. Confounders that were mea-\nsured during the physical examination included femur neck\nBMD, which was measured by DXA (QDR 1000; Hologic,\nWaltham, MA, USA), and body weight and height, which\nwere used to calculate body mass index (BMI, equal to\nbody weight [kg] divided by height [m2]).(20)\nPotential confounding variables obtained by interview at\nbaseline included age, kilocalories, and calcium from food\n(mg/d) from a 24-h recall, self-reported wrist or spine frac-\nture, smoking status (current, former, never), alcohol con-\nsumption (drinks per month), physical activity level com-\npared with others of the same age and sex (same, higher,\nlower), self-rated health status (excellent/very good/good\nversus fair/poor), number of falls in the past year, weight\nloss from maximum adult weight excluding pregnancy\nporosis or hip fracture, ever use of postmenopausal hor-\nmones, and self-reported doctor's diagnosis of chronic con-\nditions (congestive heart disease, chronic bronchitis,\ndiabetes, goiter or other thyroid disease, heart attack, or\nstroke). Because NHANES examinations are performed in\nsouthern latitudes during the winter and northern latitudes\nduring the summer, latitude and month of blood collection\nwere also evaluated as potential confounders.\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were performed using SUDAAN soft-\nware(32) for analysis of data from complex sample surveys.\nWeighted incidence rates for hip fracture were calculated\nper 10,000 person-years of follow-up. Descriptive charac-\nteristics and risk factors at baseline were compared between\nfracture cases and noncases using linear regression models\nand 2 analyses. The following variables were included as\nconfounding variables in multivariate models because they\ndiffered significantly between cases and noncases at base-\nline: age, sex, femur neck BMD, BMI, previous fracture,\ndietary calcium, kilocalories, and weight loss from maxi-\nmum.\nTo control for all risk factors simultaneously and to ac-\ncount for unequal length of follow-up, Cox proportional\nhazards models were used to model time to event and to\ncalculate estimates of the relative risk of hip fracture. For\ncases, length of follow-up was calculated as the time from\ndate of examination to date of diagnosis or procedure for\nthose identified by Medicare records or date of death for\nthose identified by death certificates. For noncases, follow-\nup time was calculated as time from baseline exam to date\nof death for decedents, date of entry into managed care for\nthose who enrolled in a Medicare managed care program,\ndid not fall into the first two categories. A test of the pro-\nportional hazards assumption did not indicate a signifi-\ncantly increasing or decreasing trend in the relative risk\n(RR) with time (p  0.54), which suggests that the assump-\ntion is not violated.\nDifferences in the relationship between hip fracture and\nserum 25(OH)D by sex were examined by including an\ninteraction term in a separate Cox proportional hazards\nmodel that included age and sex only. Because the interac-\ntion term was not significant, results were combined for\nboth sexes, and all models were adjusted for sex in addition\nto age.\nThe population attributable risk (PAR) of hip fracture\nfor serum 25(OH)D was calculated using a formula that\naccounts for confounding(33): PAR  pd[(RR \u00ad 1)/RR],\nMen Women\nHip fracture No hip fracture Hip fracture No hip fracture\nMeans\nPercent\nNo. falls in past year\nMonth of blood collection\nWeight loss from maximum\nPrevious wrist or spine fracture\nSmoking\nActivity compared with others of same age and sex\nMaternal history of osteoporosis\nSelf-rated health status\nExcellent/very\nHave chronic condition\nEver use postmenopausal hormones\n* Differs significantly between cases and noncases within sex, p < 0.05.\nwhere pd  proportion of cases exposed to the risk factor\nand RR is the multivariate-adjusted estimate. The PAR\ndepends on the prevalence of the risk factor in addition to\nthe RR estimate, so it can vary for different cut-off values.\nThus, we calculated the PAR for two serum 25(OH)D cut-\noffs (<40 and <62.5 nM) to reflect the PAR for cut-offs in\nthe range of values that have been used to define low vita-\nmin D status.\nSecondary analyses were performed to assess the impact\nof lack of Medicare data for the analytic sample before\n1991, as well as to assess the effect of including hip fracture\ncases that may have been caused by trauma. Specifically,\nRR were calculated after restricting the sample to individu-\nals whose baseline examination occurred in 1991 or later, or\nafter deleting cases with trauma-associated codes. We also\nestimated the number of hip fracture cases that might have\noccurred among whites 65 yr of age in the NHANES III\nsample before 1991, based on age-adjusted mortality rates\nfor the NHANES III sample and age-adjusted incidence of\nHospital Discharge Survey.(34)\nRESULTS\nMean serum 25(OH)D in the total sample at baseline was\nBaseline characteristics of hip fracture cases versus non-\ncases are compared by sex in Table 1. Fracture cases of both\nsexes were older, had lower femur neck BMD, ate fewer\nkilocalories, and consumed less calcium than noncases. Se-\nrum 25(OH)D levels and BMI were significantly lower\namong cases than noncases in women but not in men. Fe-\nmale cases were also significantly more likely to report a\nprevious spine or wrist fracture and a weight loss of >10%\nfrom maximum than noncases. None of the other variables\ntested differed significantly between hip fracture cases and\nnoncases at baseline.\nIncidence rates for hip fracture by age and sex for the\nnon-Hispanic whites in the analytic sample are shown in\nTable 2. Rates were substantially higher in those 80 yr of\nage compared with the younger age group. Women had a\nhigher hip fracture incidence than men. Mean age at frac-\nlength of follow-up time was 6.7 yr for the total analytic\nsample.\nThe relative risk of hip fracture associated with increas-\ning serum 25(OH)D levels is shown in Table 3. When ad-\njusted for age and sex, serum 25(OH)D was significantly\nrelated to hip fracture risk, whether examined as a continu-\nous variable or in categories. Hip fracture risk was reduced\nby 21% for each SD increase (SD  25.3 nM) in serum\n25(OH)D levels when examined as a continuous variable\nafter adjusting for age and sex. However, adjusting for all\nsignificant confounders weakened the relationship between\nserum vitamin D when analyzed as a continuous variable;\nrisk was 18% lower per SD increase, and the relationship\nwas no longer statistically significant.\nWhen examined using cut-points in the range of 40\u00ad62.5\nnM, serum 25(OH)D was significantly related to hip frac-\nture risk even after adjusting for significant confounders. In\nspecific, the reduction in hip fracture risk ranged from 36%\nto 60% for these three cut-off values after adjusting for all\nconfounders. However, when a cut-off of 75 nM was used,\nthe reduction in hip fracture risk (14%) was no longer\nstatistically significant.\nThere was a significant trend in risk reduction when se-\nrum 25(OH)D was examined by quartile, but the trend did\nnot seem to be linear across all values (Table 3). Specifi-\ncally, compared with the lowest serum 25(OH)D quartile,\nthe RR in the third quartile was lower than that in the\nsecond quartile, but the RR estimate in the fourth quartile\nwas similar or higher than that in the third quartile. Fur-\nthermore, the 95% CIs for the RR in all three upper quar-\ntiles overlapped, and results of t-tests comparing differences\nin the  coefficients corresponding to these RR estimates\nwere not significant (data not shown).\nEstimates of the PAR of hip fracture for serum 25(OH)D\nResults of secondary analyses suggested that lack of data\non hip fracture occurrence before 1991 and inclusion of\ncases that may have been caused by trauma were unlikely\nto have affected results in an important way. In specific,\nage- and sex-adjusted RR estimates from these secondary\nanalyses differed from those in the main analysis by 0.04 or\nless. Finally, only 13 hip fracture cases were projected to\nhave occurred in the analytic sample before 1991.\nDISCUSSION\nSerum 25(OH)D values exceeding roughly 60 nM were\nassociated with a significantly lower risk of hip fracture in\nthis cohort of older white men and women, even after ad-\njusting for several relevant confounders. Results were not\nlinear across all values, however, as shown by the similarity\nof the RR estimates in the upper three quartiles of serum\nOur results contrast with those reported from the SOF, in\nwhich no relationship was found between serum 25(OH)D\nand hip fracture risk.(18) Possible reasons for the discrep-\nancy include differences in study sample, study design, hip\nfracture ascertainment, and serum 25(OH)D assays.\nWomen in this study were older, less likely to be current\nsmokers, and consumed somewhat less calcium than the\nwomen in the SOF sample. The SOF sample also did not\nAge at baseline\ninterview (yr)\nHip fracture\ncases\nperson-years\nMen\nWomen\ninclude men. Differences in study design also exist: SOF\nused a case-cohort design to examine the question, whereas\nour study prospectively followed all respondents who met\ncriteria for inclusion into the analytic sample. Ascertain-\nment of hip fractures differed between studies as well, with\nSOF confirming fractures by review of radiographs ob-\ntained at the time of hospitalization for fracture, whereas\nthis study relied on hip fracture diagnoses obtained from\nMedicare records and death certificates. Finally, assay dif-\nferences could also potentially have played a role, because\nserum 25(OH)D assays are not standardized, and different\nassays have been shown to produce different results for the\nsame specimens.(35) Although both this study and SOF used\na radioimmunoassay to measure serum 25(OH)D levels,\nthe specific assay used in SOF was not stated, so the degree\nof comparability between the assays in the two studies can-\nnot be firmly determined.\nThe definition of optimal serum 25(OH)D values is\ncurrently under debate, especially because recent data\nsuggest that optimal vitamin D status may be associated\nwith a higher range of values than has been used in the\n25(OH)D as a categorical variable found health benefits for\nthose with values that fall within the recently proposed\nrange: those with values 62.5 nM had a 36% lower risk\nthan those with values below this level, and risk was signifi-\ncantly reduced in the two upper quartiles of serum\ncompared with those with values in the lowest quartile\n(in which values fell below 43 nM). However, our results do\nnot provide strong support for continued risk reduction\nas serum 25(OH) values increase above these levels. For\nexample, hip fracture risk was not significantly lower in\nalso found no significant relationship between fracture risk\nand serum 25(OH)D values when a cut-off of 75 nM was\nused. Furthermore, in this study, the RR point estimate was\nlower in the third quartile (median and range of 70 and\n61.1\u00ad82.5 nM, respectively) than in the fourth quartile (me-\nsuggests that risk did not decline further as values exceeded\n83 nM. However, the confidence limits for the RR in the\nthird and fourth quartiles overlapped, and t-tests to assess\ndifferences between quartiles were not significant, so firm\nconclusions regarding the category with the lowest risk can-\nnot be drawn. The number of hip fracture cases in each\nserum 25(OH)D quartile in our study was somewhat lim-\nited, so that power to detect significant differences in rela-\ntive risks between quartiles was not ideal.\nOur estimate of the PAR using a serum 25(OH)D cut-off\nof 62.5 nM suggests that 18% of hip fracture cases in the\npopulation could be prevented if serum values under this\ncut-off were eliminated.(33) This compares favorably with\nPARs of coronary heart disease estimated for common car-\ndiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high systolic blood\npressure, or high serum cholesterol,(39) and with PARs of\nany non-spine nontraumatic fracture estimated for osteo-\nporotic BMD values at the total spine or total hip.(40) It is\nimportant to note that PARs depend on the prevalence of\nthe risk factor in the population in addition to the strength\nof its relationship with the disease, and thus may vary if\ndifferent cut-off values are used. Other important issues\nregarding PARs include the assumption of a causal rela-\ntionship between the risk factor and disease, avoidance of\nincorrectly interpreting the PAR as the proportion of cases\nhaving the risk factor, and the need to properly account for\nconfounding in their calculation.(33)\nLimitations of this study include a relatively small num-\nber of hip fracture cases that were identified using Medicare\nand death records without confirmation by X-ray. The fact\nthat almost all cases had codes consistent with hip fracture\non multiple medical records should reduce the probability\nHip fracture Adjusted for age and sex Risk-adjusted*\nVitamin D categories\nQuartiles\n* Adjusted for age, sex, femoral neck BMD, BMI, previous fracture, dietary calcium, kilocalories, and weight loss from maximum.\nthat identified cases did not suffer a hip fracture. However,\nsome cases may have been mistakenly classified as non-\ncases, especially because Medicare records before 1991\nwere not available. This number is likely to be small: we\nestimated that 13 undetected hip fracture cases may have\nmisclassification of cases as noncases would likely tend to\nattenuate the RR estimates observed between hip fracture\nrisk and serum 25(OH)D.\nOur results also apply only to the segment of the white\npopulation 65 yr of age that was not institutionalized at\nbaseline and participated in Medicare fee-for-service pro-\ngrams (e.g., medical records for respondents who received\ncare from managed care programs or in Veterans Admin-\nistration facilities were not available). Thus, although based\non a cohort that was derived from a nationally representa-\ntive sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population\nat baseline, our results cannot be used to generalize to the\nentire white adult population >65 yr of age. Furthermore,\nexclusions for missing data or loss to follow-up were also\nmade. The respondents who were excluded from our\nsample were more likely to have several characteristics that\nare associated with greater hip fracture risk [older, lower\nserum 25(OH)D and femur neck BMD, poorer health,\nmore fractures at baseline, and less activity] than respon-\ndents who were included. Thus, our results may potentially\nunderestimate the relationship between serum 25(OH)D\nand hip fracture risk among older white adults to some\nextent.\nIn conclusion, serum 25(OH)D was significantly related\nto hip fracture risk in this cohort of older white adults even\nafter adjusting for several other relevant confounding vari-\nables. Our results suggest that this relationship may not be\nlinear across all values. Future matches of the NHANES III\nsample with Medicare records and the National Death In-\ndex may identify additional hip fracture cases in this cohort,\nand thus provide the opportunity to examine the relation-\nship between vitamin D status and hip fracture risk with\ngreater power and in greater depth.\n"
