Santiago, PhD2 and Clara G. Muschkin, PhD\nDuring the 1980s, the working-age population with\nsevere disabilities increased by 158% in the United\nproximately 43 million persons in the United States\nreported some type of disability that limited their\nability to work. In addition to being older, the dis-\nabled population was disproportionately female. Fif-\nteen percent of the disabled were black, and slightly\ncreased survival rates for persons with chronic dis-\neases, increased awareness of health problems, in-\ncreases in work-related accidents and illnesses, and\nthe changing demographic structure of the working-\nage population have been identified as factors asso-\nciated with this growth (Wolfe & Haveman, 1990).\nHowever, one of the most important factors cited for\nthis growth is the increase in the size and proportion\nof the population at older ages, when disability rates\nare highest. Midlife and older workers have become\na larger part of the labor force, with growth rates as\nwell as participation rates of the 55+ population\nincreasing significantly during the 1990s (U.S. Senate\nSpecial Committee on Aging, 1991).

Currently, the aged segment of eth-\nnic groups has been growing at a faster rate than the\nolder Anglo population, with Latinos the fastest\ngrowing ethnic group (Wykle & Kaskel, 1991). This\ntrend is projected to continue into the next century\nThe growth of the population of female and minor-\nity older workers has important implications for the\ncomposition of the work-disabled population, as\nboth groups report higher rates of disability than\nAnglo men. Research on women with disabilities has\nrevealed that women have higher rates of chronic\nillness and severe disability and higher rates of multi-\nple disabling conditions. At the older working ages\n(45-64 years), women are more likely than men to\nreport a limitation that makes them unable to work\n(Verbrugge, 1989). With regard to differences by\nrace, there is consistent evidence that blacks have\npoorer health than Anglos, based on mortality rates,\nfunctional health, and self-reported health indica-\ntors. Older blacks are almost twice as likely as older\nAnglos to suffer from the major chronic illnesses,\nand mortality rates for the major illnesses also are\nhighest for older and middle-aged blacks (Barresi &\nStull, 1993; Bound, Schoenbaum, & Waidmann,\nare more likely than Anglos to experience disability\ngenerally and to experience restriction in a major\nactivity, including work (Bound etal., 1994; Chatters,\nFindings on the health and functional status of\nolder Latinos have been less consistent, in part be-\ncause of the paucity of information available for\nnational comparisons across racial and ethnic\ngroups. Although Latinos have some important\nhealth disadvantages relative to the majority popula-\ntion when compared across all ages, it appears that\nolder Latinos have better outcomes than Anglos in\nterms of death rates and prevalence of severe\nchronic diseases (Espino, 1993). In contrast to the\ndeath and disease patterns, disability indicators are\nworse for older Latinos than for non-Hispanic\nwhites, but better than for blacks. Older Puerto Ri-\ncans are the exception, reporting the highest disabil-\nity rates of all groups (O'Donnell, 1989). As com-\npared with Anglos, older persons of Mexican origin\nreport fewer disabilities under age 45 years, but more\ndisability and restricted activity days at age 45 and\nolder, with the ethnicity gap widening with age\n(Markides, Coreil, & Rogers, 1989; Wallace, Camp-\nbell, & Lew-Ting, 1994). Gender differences in health\nand the prevalence of disability persist within race\nand national origin groups. Latina women are more\nlikely than Latino men to suffer multiple illnesses,\nand they have higher incidence rates of some\nchronic conditions (Espino, 1993; Wykle & Kaskel,\n1994). Among blacks, women of middle and older\nages are more likely than men to report a disabling\nHow do the consequences of disability status vary\nby gender, race, and ethnicity? The economic conse-\nquences of disability have been studied extensively\nfor Anglo men. Men with disabilities are less likely to\nbe employed and have lower earnings than nondis-\nabled men (Baldwin & Johnson, 1994; Berkowitz &\nbeen given to examining these costs for women and\nminorities. The limited empirical literature to date\nsuggests that women and minorities with disabilities\nare uniquely disadvantaged in the labor market by\nvirtue of their multiple minority status (Deegan,\ntrick (1994) noted, although it is assumed that the\ncombined impact of race or ethnic status, gender,\nand disability has a deleterious effect on the eco-\nnomic well-being of women and minorities, these\nissues have received scant attention in the disability\nliterature. The prevalence patterns of poor health\nand disability noted earlier further underscore the\nneed to evaluate their economic impact, particularly\ngiven the fact that disabilities are the primary health\ndisadvantage of older Latinos, and involve an appar-\nent double jeopardy situation for minority women.\nAcross all ages, female earnings are strongly af-\nfected by poor health (Lonsdale, 1990; Loprest, Rup-\namong the older working-age population (ages 45 to\n64 years) indicates that women with health-related\njob limitations are more likely to leave the labor force\nthan men with similar conditions (Verbrugge, 1989).\nBecause few women are eligible for wage-related\nbenefit programs when they become disabled, they\nare highly dependent on income from means-tested\ntransfer programs (Loprest et al., 1993; U.S. Bureau\nof the Census, 1989). Single parenthood, marital dis-\nsolution, and the presence of a disabled spouse or\ndependent have been identified as factors associated\nwith the worsening health of women (see Deegan &\nResearch suggests similar patterns of disadvantage\nfor blacks with disabilities. Luft (1978) found that\nblacks were more likely to leave the labor force, work\nfewer hours, or move into different jobs because of\nwork limitations, as compared with Anglos. Recent\nstudies (Burkhauser, Haveman, & Wolfe, 1993; Yelin,\n1992) suggest that the deterioration of earnings dur-\nblack men with disabilities. Among the older\nworking-age population, a substantial fraction of the\nracial gap in labor force participation may be attrib-\nuted to health limitations on the capacity to work\n(Bound et al., 1994). Increasing disability among\nmiddle-aged and older blacks has been associated\nwith shifting retirement statuses, whereby the disabil-\nity role is adopted by persons who are not working in\nfull-time jobs but do not consider themselves retired.\nSporadic work patterns over the life course, low lev-\nels of retirement benefits, the need to continue work-\ning at older ages, and increases in physical disability\ncontribute to growth of an \"unretired retired\" seg-\nment of the black population. This group is the most\noverall deprived of the black elderly population, and\noften is ignored in the retirement research that\nshapes policy and planning (Gibson, 1988).\nResearch on the consequences of work disabilities\nfor Latinos is more limited, despite the growth of the\ndisabled Latino population. Existing studies suggest\nthat only one out of ten Latinos with work impair-\nments was employed full time in the labor force (U.S.\nBureau of the Census, 1989). For those who were\nworking full time, Latinos earned approximately 73%\nof the earnings of Anglos with disabilities. In an early\nnos with disabilities had earnings below $4,000. Fur-\nther, the chances of being unemployed were quite\nhigh for Latinos (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1989).\nNearly two out of ten Latina women and three out of\nten Latino men were unemployed in 1988. Angel\n(1984) found that Latino men with disabilities suf-\nfered greater loss of work and income than their\nnon-Latino counterparts. He also noted significant\ndifferences in the impact of disability status within\nthe Latino population, comparing Mexican, Puerto\nRican, and Cuban men. Puerto Ricans were found to\nbe particularly disadvantaged relative to all other\ngroups, sustaining higher losses in earnings and\nwork hours.\nIn a recent study using data from the 1990 Panel\nStudy of Income Dynamics, Santiago (1994) analyzed\nrace, ethnic, and gender differences in the costs of\ndisability status among working-aged adults (ages\n18-64 years). The results of her analyses are consist-\nent with patterns documented in the literature, re-\nvealing that disability greatly reduced labor force\nparticipation across all groups. Further, when per-\nsons were employed, disability also reduced returns\nto work. When employed, black and Latino men with\ndisabilities worked fewer hours and had lower earn-\nings than either Anglo men with disabilities or non-\ndisabled minorities. For women, the patterns of dis-\nadvantage were similar to those of men but more\npronounced. Disabled women were less likely to\nwork than nondisabled women or disabled men.\nWhen compared to Anglos, blacks, and other Latino\nsubgroups, Puerto Rican men and women were\nfound to be uniquely disadvantaged. This study sug-\ngests that the economic well-being of blacks and\nLatinos is constrained by the costs associated with\ncarrying \"multiple minority\" statuses, lending partial\nsupport to the multiple minority status hypothesis\nsuggested by Kirkpatrick (1994) and others.\nThe present analysis extends the work on varia-\ntions in the consequences of disability status by\nfocusing on the labor supply of Anglo, black, and\nLatino older workers, and by disaggregating Latinos\ninto major national origin groups. Our first task was\nto examine the patterns of work disability by gender\nand ethnicity, using alternative measures uniquely\navailable for all of these groups in the nationally\nrepresentative sample of older adults contained in\nthe 1992 Health and Retirement Study (see Appen-\ndix B, Note 3). A second phase of our analysis in-\nvolved a detailed examination of the variations in\nlabor force participation across the comparison\ngroups and evaluation of race, gender, and ethnic/\nnational origin variations in the impact of disability\non labor supply. In multivariate analyses, we exam-\nined the various effects of work limitations and over-\nall health status, minority status, and socioeconomic\nresources on the labor supply of older Anglo, black,\nand Latino men and women. A final dimension of the\nanalysis involved testing the effect of multiple minor-\nity statuses, to evaluate the additional costs of dis-\nability for persons who face double or triple jeopardy\nbecause of their ascribed membership within other\nminority groups (i.e., being female, black or Latino).\nMethods\nData and Sample\nThis study uses data from the first wave of the\nHealth and Retirement Study (HRS; see Appendix\nB, Note 4), a national longitudinal study that focuses\non the preretirement-age population, namely, per-\nolder workers, the HRS provides unique opportuni-\nties to examine the relationship of disability to labor\nsupply. Although there is considerable consensus in\nthe literature regarding the relevance of health, func-\ntional limitations, family characteristics, resources,\nand demographic attributes in shaping the labor\nforce participation of persons with disabilities\nrestricted by data sets that captured only subsets of\nthe information necessary to disentangle the effects\nof these factors on labor supply. Also, previous stud-\nies generally have lacked sufficiently large subsam-\nples of minority respondents to reliably compare\ndifferences across groups. The HRS overcomes these\ndifficulties by providing detailed information on fac-\ntors that influence labor force participation decisions\nby persons with disabilities, including numerous\nhealth-related measures and measures of program\nparticipation. In addition, the HRS provides in-depth\ninformation on respondent demographic and em-\nployment characteristics before and after the onset\nof a disability. Moreover, the HRS oversamples\nMexican-Americans, blacks, and households in the\nstate of Florida, thus providing the basis for detailed\nanalyses of the interrelationships between race, La-\ntino origin, disability, gender, and labor supply.\nThe first wave of the HRS successfully interviewed\nAmericans, 99 Puerto Ricans, and 369 other Latinos\n(including Cubans). The oversampling of minority\ngroups means that analyses must incorporate com-\npensatory weighting for selection probabilities and\nmust adjust for geographic and group differences in\nresponse rates. Total sample weights and race/\ngender-specific weighting factors were used in the\ndescriptive and multivariate analyses in this study.\nOur working sample was restricted to respondents\nand their spouses/partners who were between the\nages of 50 and 64 years, the segment of the target\npreretirement population that would be expected to\nparticipate in the labor force. To facilitate race/ethnic\ngroup comparisons, we excluded persons who were\nnot Anglo (non-Latino white), black, or Latino. The\nsample was also restricted to those respondents who\nhad information about disability status. Thus, we\nwere left with a total sample of 10,350 persons, in-\nOur multivariate analyses of employment status\nwere estimated on a sample that was restricted by\nlabor force status. We included in these models\nindividuals who were in the labor force -- working,\nunemployed, looking for work, on leave, or dis-\nabled. People permanently out of the labor force\nwere excluded. This group included homemakers,\nindividuals who had never worked, and respondents\nwho defined themselves as retired. This yielded a\nFor the earnings equations, the sample was even\nfurther restricted to those persons who had reported\nworking for pay at least one hour and who had\npositive earnings in 1990. The resulting sample sizes\nModel Specification\nIn this study, we hypothesized that the labor sup-\nply and earnings of older workers are influenced by\nfour sets of factors: the health and disability status of\nthe individual, the existence of additional minority\nstatuses, the socioeconomic resources of the indi-\nvidual, and the demographic characteristics of the\nindividual. The overall health status of the individual\nis expected to shape perceptions about the ability to\nwork. Disability status is expected to restrict the type\nor amount of work that can be performed. The pres-\nence of additional minority statuses is expected to\nadd to the costs of a disabling condition. Differences\nin human capital that affect labor force participation\nand earnings are also examined. Finally, we control\nfor differences in population attributes. To account\nfor the differences in the probability of selection into\nthe sample, all variables were weighted using the\nindividual sample weights.\nTwo outcome measures were used: employment\nstatus at the time of the survey and annual wages.\nEmployment status is a dichotomy, indicating\nwhether the respondent worked for pay at the time\nof the survey. The models for this outcome were\nestimated with weighted logistic regression. The\nearnings measure was conditioned on labor force\nparticipation. For persons reporting positive earn-\nings and work hours, annual wages refer to the\nnatural logarithm of the respondent's wage earnings\nduring 1991. The earnings equations were estimated\nusing a weighted least squares (WLS) regression\ntechnique.\nPredictor Measures\nIndividual Health and Disability Status. -- Health\nstatus is represented by three separate measures in\nour models in order to address previously reported\nconcerns regarding race/ethnic variation in self-\nreported health status (Barresi & Stull, 1993;\ninclude a self-reported physical health rating, as well\nas a self-rating of emotional health and an indicator\nof whether the respondent's health status worsened\nin 1991. Each of these measures was derived from a\nLikert-scaled item in the HRS questionnaire. The\nthree variables in the models are defined as dichoto-\nmies, referencing the presence of poor or fair health\nstatus. Studies of the impact of health on work out-\ncomes suggest that low health status not only is\nassociated with early withdrawal from the labor\nforce, but also contributes to reduced work hours\nand earnings by lowering worker productivity\nHaveman, 1990). Thus, we expect that persons re-\nporting fair or poor health are less likely to be em-\nployed and more likely to have lower earnings than\npersons in good or excellent health.\nDisability status is measured in these models as a\ndichotomous state, referencing whether the respon-\ndent is currently experiencing an impairment or\nhealth problem that limits the kind or amount of paid\nwork that he or she can do. In the analyses presented\nhere, we define work disability using the self-\nreported item indicating the presence of a work\nlimitation. This measure of disability status is present\nfor all persons in our analysis sample -- persons who\nare in the labor force. For all persons in our sample,\nwe expect that the presence of a work disability will\nhave negative consequences on the likelihood of\nemployment. Furthermore, among persons who are\ncurrently working, a work disability implies lower\nreturns for their labor in terms of annual wages.\nAdditional Minority Statuses. -- Minority status\nmeasures are used both to stratify the sample for\ngroup-specific analyses, and as predictor variables in\nthe models for the entire sample and in the gender-\nspecific models. The more inclusive models contain\ndichotomous indicators of black, Mexican, Puerto\nRican, and other Latino status, in order to evaluate\nvariations in the impact of minority status on labor\nsupply and wage outcomes. In addition, the multipli-\ncative effects of minority status are represented with\na series of interaction terms in the final models, thus\nmeasuring the conditional effects of being female,\nblack, or Latino for persons who are disabled. We\nhypothesize that there is an additional negative cost\nin terms of participation and earnings if the presence\nof a work disability is coupled with being female,\nblack, Mexican, Puerto Rican or other Latino.\nEconomic Resources. -- The equations include\nseveral additional predictors of work outcomes (eco-\nnomic resources) that are relevant primarily for Lati-\nnos, including immigration status, the number of\nyears that the person has resided in the United\nStates, and having limited English language profi-\nciency. Immigration status is defined by whether the\nrespondent was born outside or inside the United\nStates. For immigrants, years in the United States are\ncomputed from information on the year of arrival.\nThe measure of limited English proficiency is a di-\nchotomous indicator of Spanish language domi-\nnance. Based on the considerable literature on work\noutcomes among Latinos in the United States, we\nexpect that immigrant status is associated with some\ndisadvantages in terms of employment and income.\nLatino immigrants who have lived in the United\nStates longer, and thus have had the opportunity to\nacquire U.S.-specific work experience, are expected\nto work more and have higher earnings than more\nrecent immigrants. Limited English proficiency is an\nindicator of a lack of attachment to the local labor\nmarket, and thus is associated with lower probabili-\nties of employment and lower returns to work. An-\nother measure of resources that influence work out-\ncomes is educational attainment, available for\nrespondents of all racial and ethnic groups. This\nvariable is a continuous measure of years of com-\npleted education. It is hypothesized that more years\nof education are positively associated with being\nemployed and receiving higher wages.\nDemographic Characteristics. -- Age and marital\nstatus are included in the models as demographic\nfactors that must be controlled in order to account\nfor distributional differences among groups. How-\never, both factors also may be considered resources\nthat influence labor market outcomes. Age often is\nconsidered a proxy measure of work experience,\nwhich is positively associated with labor force partici-\npation and higher wage levels. However, at older\nworking ages, aging brings persons closer to the time\nof full or partial retirement from the labor force, and\noften it is associated with the onset of health prob-\nlems that influence both labor force participation\nand wage levels. Being married generally is associ-\nated with higher labor supply elasticities among\nwomen and lower elasticities for men (Loprest et al.,\n1993). Thus, at older ages married men are expected\nto be more likely to stay in the labor force than their\nunmarried counterparts, whereas the opposite rela-\ntionship is hypothesized for women.\nFour models are estimated for each of the outcome\nvariables. Model 1 focuses on the effects of disability\nstatus on the probability of employment, work\nhours, hourly earnings, and wages, in the presence\nof controls for health status, age, sex, and marital\nstatus. Model 2 introduces the minority status vari-\nables. In Model 3, the resource variables are in-\ncluded to control for differences in education, immi-\ngration status, work experience in the United States,\nand English language proficiency. Interaction terms\nare included in Model 4 to examine the combined\neffects of disability and minority status on labor sup-\nply and wage outcomes. The models are estimated\nhierarchically, which permits an evaluation of\nchanges in coefficients, particularly the impact of\ndisability, when additional sets of influencing factors\nare controlled. The full set of models is estimated for\nthe entire sample, with gender included in the model\nas a minority status predictor, and for separate analy-\nses of men and women. We also estimated reduced-\nform equations for ethnic and gender subgroups.\nHowever, in this article, we present the findings for\nthe full sample only (see Appendix B, Note 5).\nResults\nMeasuring Disability Status Among Older Workers\nPrior studies have noted important methodologi-\ncal implications using only subjective or self-\nreported measures. The propensity to report a dis-\nability has been found to vary by gender (Loprest et\narise when the disability measure is conditional on\nwork activities, as the differences in the extent and\nimpact of disability may reflect existing gender, race,\nand ethnic differences in conditions of employment\n(Haveman & Wolfe, 1985). Furthermore, there is evi-\ndence that disability status, in terms of self-reported\nwork limitations, may in turn be influenced by labor\nforce status, such as retirement (see Appendix B,\nIn response to these concerns, the HRS contains\nmultiple objective and self-reported measures of\nhealth status and disability. Appendix A describes 19\nmeasures derived from HRS data depicting func-\ntional status, overall physical and mental health, and\nparticipation in government programs for the dis-\nabled. Eleven of the measures are primary respon-\ndent self-reports of the health status of eligible adults\nin the household. There are eight objective indica-\ntors of disability, including four that measure partici-\npation in programs for the disabled. Table 1 presents\nsummary information regarding the prevalence of\ndisability across racial, ethnic, and gender lines.\nResults are weighted in order to provide national\nestimates for each of the different subpopulations.\nAs shown in Table 1, the prevalence of disability\nvaried significantly by race and Latino origin. The\nresults underscore the precarious health status of\nminority men and women. Among men, approxi-\nmately 19% of blacks and 17% of Latinos reported\nbeing disabled in 1991. Among women, the propor-\ntion disabled was 17% for blacks and 11% for Latinas.\nWhen self-reported work disability measures were\nused, we found that approximately 25% of blacks and\nLatinos, regardless of gender, reported a work limita-\ntion, and the majority indicated that the condition\nwas permanent.\nWhen disability status was measured using general\nreports of physical and emotional health, a substan-\ntially higher proportion of blacks and Latinos consid-\nered themselves to be in fair or poor health relative\nto Anglos. Although 17% of Anglo men reported fair\nor poor physical health, approximately 34% of black\nmen and 32% of Latino men indicated low health\nstatus. Among women, 37% of blacks and 44% of\nLatinas reported that they were in fair to poor health\n-- a rate two to three times higher than that for Anglo\nwomen. Minority men and women, particularly Lati-\nnos, were also more likely to report a worsening of\ntheir health status. One out of five Latinas and one\nout of six Latinos reported that their health had\ndeclined in the year prior to the survey.\nWhen more objective measures of health status\nare used, we see that, in general, women have higher\nrates of mobility impairments, chronic illness, and\nADL difficulties. In contrast, men tend to report\nslightly higher rates of sensory impairments. How-\never, when we look across different groups of\nwomen, we see that black women had the highest\nprevalence rates for chronic illness and ADL impair-\nments. Latinas had the highest rates of mobility\nimpairments.\nIf disability is described in terms of program partic-\nipation, several patterns emerge. First, reported\nrates of disability are significantly lower: prevalence\nrates are generally less than half of the self-reported\nrates. Because participation in these programs is\nbased on meeting a series of eligibility requirements,\nonly one of which is the presence of a disabling\ncondition, the lower prevalence of disability may\nsimply mean that persons with disabilities have a\nmore difficult time in meeting program require-\nments. Second, men are more likely to receive dis-\nability benefits from Social Security, the Veteran's\nAdministration, and Workers' Compensation, which\nis probably an artifact of the lower participation of\nwomen in the military and the more unstable work\nhistories of women (see Appendix B, Note 7). Third,\nminorities generally have higher rates of program\nparticipation, particularly in public welfare disability\nprograms. Again, this may reflect difficulties in meet-\ning eligibility requirements.\nPercent Reporting\nSelf-reported measures\nFair to poor physical health*\nFair to poor emotional health*\nDeteriorating health*\nNot in LF because of disability*\nA work limitation*\nA permanent work disability*\nLost work because of illness*\nDays lost from work in 1991 due to illness\nExposure to work hazards (men only)*\nAny limitation or impairment*\nEarly retirement due to health reasons*\nObjective measures\nSensory impairment*\nMobility impairment (men only)*\nChronic illness (men only)*\nADL difficulties\nReceiving Social Security disability benefits\nReceiving VA disability benefits\nReceiving Workers Compensation\nReceiving public welfare disability benefits\nUnweighted N\nAnglos\nMales\nBlacks\nLatinos\nAnglos\nFemales\nBlacks\nLatinos\n\u00b7Differences across race and gender groups significant at the p < .05 level.\nAs we have shown, there is considerable range of\nresponse to the HRS questions on disability status.\nFor our analyses of the economic consequences of\ndisability status, we had to decide which of the mea-\nsures to use. Although we heeded the aforemen-\ntioned concerns related to self-reports of health sta-\ntus expressed by Haveman and Wolfe (1985), we\ndecided to use self-reports of overall health status\nand work limitations as predictors in our multivariate\nmodels predicting labor force participation and earn-\nings (see Appendix B, Note 8). There were three\nprimary concerns that shaped our decision. The first\nwas the concern that program participation mea-\nsures would underestimate the extent of disability\namong women and minority men. A second concern\nreflected our interest in comparing the results of this\nstudy with previous research. The HRS question re-\ngarding the self-report of a work limitation closely\nparallels questions found in the Census, the Panel\nStudy of Income Dynamics (PSID), and other na-\ntional surveys. Finally, we were concerned about\ntapping into the effects of the cognitive dimension of\ndisability. If individuals perceive themselves to be in\npoor health or unable to work, these perceptions\nmay be the primary factors underlying labor market\nbehaviors.\nCharacteristics of the Older Working Age Population\nby Disability Status, Ethnicity, and Gender\nTable 2 documents the effects of disability status of\nolder men and women. For comparative purposes,\nresults are presented for Anglos, blacks, and Latinos.\nAgain, weighted results are presented so we can\ngeneralize to the national population. For all groups,\npersons with disabilities tended to be older than\ntheir nondisabled counterparts. They also had sig-\nnificantly lower levels of schooling, on average, one\nto two years lower than persons without disabilities.\nLatino men and women with disabilities had the\nlowest levels of schooling -- approximately eight\nyears. Although Anglos and blacks tend to be over-\nwhelmingly native-born, approximately one-half of\nolder Latinos were immigrants. Latinos with disabili-\nties were more likely to be Spanish dominant and to\nhave resided in the United States longer than their\nnondisabled counterparts.\nFor all groups, disability greatly reduced labor\nforce participation and the return to work. Labor\nforce participation rates were approximately 50 to\n75% lower for persons with disabilities than their\nnondisabled counterparts. Among disabled men,\nAnglos reported the highest labor force participation\n(42%) while blacks were the least likely to be em-\nployed (21%). Only about 26% of Latino men with\ndisabilities were employed. This is in sharp contrast\nto the high rates (>80%) of labor force participation\nof nondisabled minority men.\nWhen employed, black and Latino men with dis-\nabilities had lower earnings than Anglo men with\ndisabilities as well as their nondisabled counterparts.\nAnglo men with disabilities had mean annual earnings\nof $25,865. In contrast, black men with disabilities\nearned approximately $1,000 less than disabled Anglo\nmen, suggesting a higher degree of employment se-\nlectivity among blacks.

The annual earnings of\ndisabled Anglos were higher than those for nondis-\nabled Latinos, and although lower than nondisabled\nblacks, they were not significantly different.\nFor disabled men out of the labor force, govern-\nment sponsored income support and social insur-\nance programs were significant sources of income.\nMore than half of the disabled Anglo, black, and\nLatino men were receiving benefits from the Social\nSecurity Disability Insurance or SSI program. Latino\nmen with disabilities had the highest rates of partici-\npation in Social Securty/SSI disability programs\n(58%). In addition, Latinos had the highest participa-\ntion in the Workers' Compensation program (14%)\nand public welfare disability programs (11%). Anglo\nmen had the highest participation rate for the Vet-\nerans Administration disability program (11%).\nThe patterns of disadvantage noted here are even\nmore pronounced for women with disabilities. Not\nonly are women less likely to work than their nondis-\nabled counterparts, they are also less likely to work\nthan disabled men. Further, they are also likely to\nreceive lower returns for their labor. Anglo women\nwith disabilities earn, on average, $13,914, approxi-\nmately 69% of the wages of nondisabled Anglos.\nBlack and Latina women with disabilities earn, on\naverage, approximately 55% of the earnings of non-\nspectively). Further, black women with disabilities\nearn only 75% of what Anglo women with disabilities\nearn; Latinas with disabilities earn only 55%. In addi-\ntion, although only 30% of Anglo women with dis-\nabilities are in the labor force, and they worked, on\nare approximately twice as high as those for minority\nwomen with disabilities. Employed Latinas were\nmore likely to be working in the low-wage sector of\nthe labor market.\nThe economic well-being of women with disabili-\nties was directly linked to the receipt of income\ntransfers from Social Security/SSI, Workers' Com-\npensation, or public welfare disability programs and\nreflected their economic vulnerability. Approxi-\nmately 50% of Anglo and Latina women and 56% of\nblack women received Social Security disability ben-\nefits, more likely than not from the SSI program. In\naddition, nearly 9% of Anglo women, 3% of black\nwomen, and 7% of Latinas received Workers' Com-\npensation. Finally, 11% of Latinas, 7% of blacks, and\nnearly 5% of Anglos received disability benefits from\npublic welfare programs. The higher rates of partici-\npation in these programs suggest an additional layer\nof economic insecurity because these programs tend\nto have lower benefit levels and require re-\nestablishing program eligibility (Mudrick, 1983).\nPredicting the Employment Status of Older Workers\nThe logistic regression results for the models pre-\ndicting the probability of being employed in 1991 are\npresented in Table 3. In all of the following discus-\nsion, the results are described using the antilogs of\nthe logistic regression coefficients (see Appendix B,\nNote 9). Once we control for differences in back-\nground characteristics (Model 4), we find that low\nphysical and emotional health status, deteriorating\nhealth, and the presence of a work disability all\nsignificantly affect the employment status of older\nworkers. As shown in Table 3, workers who had low\nphysical health status had 61% lower odds of being\nemployed than persons in good health. For those\nworkers with poor emotional health, the odds of\nbeing employed decreased by 38%. Further, persons\nexperiencing deteriorating health status had 27%\nlower odds of being employed than those in better\nhealth. However, it is the presence of a work disabil-\nity that is the strongest predictor of employment\nstatus, even after controlling for differences in hu-\nman capital. For persons with a work limitation, the\nodds of being employed are 95% lower than for their\nnondisabled counterparts.\nAlthough the additive effects of minority status did\nnot remain significant across all specifications, being\nblack and disabled reduced the odds of being em-\nployed by 46%. In contrast, being male and disabled\nincreased the odds of employment, most likely be-\ncause of the need for men to continue working at\nolder ages. Only one of the economic resource vari-\nables, educational attainment, was tied to labor force\nparticipation. For each additional year of schooling,\nthere was a 10% increase in the odds of being em-\nployed. As we also found in the gender-specific\nmodels, this effect was consistent in both the male\nand female equations. Finally, both men and women\nwho were married were 1.9 times more likely to be\nemployed than those who were not married.\nThe Impact of Disability on the Economic Well-Being\nof Older Workers\nEarlier descriptive statistics suggest that the costs\nof disability status are particularly acute for women\nand minorities with disabilities. In the following set\nof analyses, we examine these effects, controlling for\ndifferences in demographic characteristics and eco-\nnomic resources. The results of the analyses on an-\nnual earnings are presented in Table 4. Our full\nspecification provided the best fit for predicting the\nearnings of older workers (R2 = .296). The results\nshow that health and disability indicators continue to\nbe significant predictors of the earnings of older\nworkers, regardless of gender and ethnicity. After\ncontrolling for differences in background character-\nistics, persons with work disabilities earned 25% less\nthan their nondisabled counterparts. Although all of\nthe additional health status measures were signifi-\nTable 3.

Persons who re-\nported low health status earned nearly 10% less than\npersons who were in good physical health.\nTwo minority status variables -- those focusing on\ngender -- remained significant in the full specifica-\ntion models. Older men earned approximately 59%\nmore than older women. However, if a man was also\ndisabled, his annual earnings were reduced by 17%.\nIn addition, two economic resource variables, edu-\ncational attainment and limited English language pro-\nficiency, also impacted earnings. Each additional\nyear of schooling completed increased earnings by\n9%. However, for persons who had limited English\nproficiency, an indicator of weaker attachments to\nthe labor force, annual earnings were 20% lower than\nfor their English-speaking counterparts.\nDiscussion\nThe presence of a work disability has a deleterious\neffect on the labor supply and economic well-being\nof older workers, regardless of race, ethnicity, or\ngender. Across all groups, persons with disabilities\nare less likely to work, and when employed, they\nwork for lower pay than their nondisabled counter-\nparts. However, our descriptive analyses suggest that\nthese conditions are more acute for older minority\nmen and women. Further, disabled minority women,\nparticularly Latinas, are uniquely disadvantaged.\nWhen compared to other persons with disabilities,\nLatinas with disabilities have the lowest levels of\nlabor force participation and earnings.\nAlthough the research on blacks and Latinos with\ndisabilities is limited, we would suggest that their\nhigher rates of disability reflect their overall position\nof economic disadvantage in the United States. The\nolder minority population is more likely to have lived\nin poverty at various times in adulthood. This would\nincrease the likelihood of poor health status as well as\nlimit utilization of preventive health services. More-\nover, if these adults have extended periods of poor\nhealth during adulthood, they have more likely than\nnot experienced greater barriers to employment op-\nportunities. Restricted access to employment would\nonly exacerbate the economic deprivation of these\nolder workers. Thus, the linkages between health\nstatus and economic status, particularly for minority\npopulations, require further investigation.\nOur multivariate analyses revealed that the pres-\nence of a work limitation decreased the chances of\nbeing employed and reduced the earnings of older\nworkers. Yet, the impact of other statuses was mixed.\nLow health status and deteriorating health were gen-\nerally significant predictors of reductions in labor\nforce participation and earnings. However, despite\nthe broad acceptance of the hypothesis that persons\nwith multiple minority statuses are uniquely disad-\nvantaged, our analysis only provides partial support\nfor this thesis. The additional premiums associated\nwith these statuses seem to be most acute for black\nmen with disabilities. Does that suggest that double\nor triple jeopardy is more rhetoric than substance?\nPerhaps the results reflect the greater selectivity\namong older minority individuals, particularly those\nwith disabilities, who continue to work. Nonethe-\nless, although the effects of gender and Latino origin\nseem to disappear in the reduced form models, our\nongoing analyses focusing on separate gender and\nethnic subgroups suggest that the underlying pro-\ncesses generating patterns of labor force participa-\ntion and earnings vary considerably across gender,\nrace and ethnic lines, and therefore, our empirical\nmodels may need to be further refined to capture\nthese nuances.\nWe suspect that there may be a number of addi-\ntional factors that may shape patterns of employment\nand earnings, particularly for minority older workers,\nthat warrant further investigation. Of particular inter-\nest is the extent to which employers provide accom-\nmodations to workers after the onset of work limita-\ntions. Are employers more likely to provide these\naccommodations for men, regardless of race, or for\nAnglos, regardless of gender? Further, to what extent\nare there differences across groups in familial sup-\nport of the work efforts of persons with disabilities?\nHow does familial support work to enhance or hin-\nder the employment of persons with disabilities?\nThese are some of the questions that can be ad-\ndressed with the HRS data, and future work will focus\non addressing these issues. Moreover, our results\nonly capture these effects in a cross-sectional view of\nthe world. Do these patterns remain constant over\ntime? Are the effects of the predictors constant over\ntime? Are there changes in policy, such as the imple-\nmentation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, that\nwill shape these patterns? As subsequent waves of\nthe Health and Retirement Survey become available,\nthe long-term effects of disability status on older\nworkers need to be addressed more fully.\nReferences\nAngel, R. J.

Throughout the article we use the term Anglo to refer to\npersons who identified themselves as white and of non-\nHispanic origin in the Health and Retirement Study.\n2. Although this concept has been widely used and ac-\ncepted in the literature, there has been relatively little\ntheoretical or empirical work that attempts to test as-\nsumptions of cumulative disadvantage attributed to\npossessing multiple minority statuses.\n3. Although we have disaggregated our analyses for spe-\ncific Latino origin groups, the small samples of Puerto\nRicans and Cubans in the Health and Retirement Survey\nled us to focus on aggregate Latino findings.\n4. The Gamma release of the HRS data tape was used in\nthis analysis.\n5. Results for the separate gender and ethnic subgroups\nare available upon request from the authors. We would\nbriefly mention that there were considerable differ-\nences across gender and ethnic lines in the effects of\nthe predictors. For example, the only significant predic-\ntor of employment status across all models was the\npresence of a work disability, with stronger effects\nnoted for Latinas and black men and women. The\nreduced-form earnings equations revealed that al-\nthough disability status reduced the earnings of Anglos\nand blacks, it was an insignificant predictor of Latino\nearnings.\n6. Cognizant of these concerns, we also ran analyses ex-\namining gender, racial, and ethnic differences in the\nreporting of disabilities. According to the results of\nthese analyses, the odds of reporting a work disability\nwere 22% higher for older blacks and 46% higher for\npeople who were poor (defined as people earning less\nthan $12,000). However, in contrast to previous studies,\nwhen we examined the interaction between minority\nstatus and poverty, we found that poor women as well\nas poor Mexican-Americans and blacks were signifi-\ncantly less likely to report a work disability. In part, this\nmay reflect the need for poor individuals to continue to\nwork despite the existence of disabling conditions. A\ncopy of these analyses are available upon request.\n7. In order to be eligible for disability benefits from Social\nSecurity, applicants need to have been insured for at\nthe onset of disability, as well as have a disabling condi-\ntion that Social Security physicians deem \"perma-\nnently\" disabling (> 12 months) and that prevents the\napplicant from obtaining gainful employment.\n8. In this article, our discussion focuses on the effects on\nlabor supply and earnings of four health conditions: the\npresence of a work limitation (v4001), general physical\nhealth status (v301), general emotional health status\ndid some preliminary tests using alternative health sta-\ntus indicators and found similar patterns of results.\n9. The antilog represents the exponentiated value of the\nregression coefficient B\\ It is interpreted as the unit\nchange in the odds of Yoccurring given a unit change in\nX. When the value of the antilog is greater than 1, it is\ninterpreted as the percent increase in the odds (or\nnumber of times higher odds). When the antilog is less\nthan 1, the interpretation reflects a percent reduction in\nthe odds (1.00-antilog). If we use an example from Table\n3, we see that the odds of being employed are reduced\nby approximately 95% for persons with disabilities.\n\u00b7 Registration and Call for Papers will be distributed in March 1996.\n\u00b7 Notification of receipt of abstracts will be by 31 October 1996.\n\u00b7 Submitters will be informed of the final decision bv 30 March 1997.\nADELAIDE\nS\nI\nN\nG\nA\nP\nO\nR\nE -1 ( \" \\ Q ' \" T H\u00b0NOIUIU\nAdditional information available from: The Gerontological Society ofAmerica, Suite 350,"
