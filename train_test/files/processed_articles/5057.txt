    "abstract": "Abstract\nRecurrent food crises and climate change, along with habitat loss and micronutrient deficiencies, are global issues of critical\nimportance that have pushed food security and environmental sustainability to the top of the political agenda. Analyses of\nthe dynamic linkages between food consumption patterns and environmental concerns have recently received considerable\nattention from the international and scientific community. Using the lens of a broad sustainability approach, this conceptual\narticle aims at developing a multidimensional framework to evaluate the sustainability of food systems and diets, applicable\nto countries of the Mediterranean region. Derived from natural disaster and sustainability sciences, a vulnerability approach,\nenhanced by inputs from the resilience literature, has been adapted to analyze the main issues related to food and nutrition\nsecurity. Through causal factor analysis, the resulting conceptual framework improves the design of information systems or\nmetrics assessing the interrelated environmental, economic, social, and health dynamics of food systems.\n",

Worldwide\nconcerns about sustainable development are also reflected in\nthe global food security debate, which states that \"food secu-\nrity exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social\nand economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food\nwhich meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an\nactive and healthy life\" (Food and Agriculture Organization\nfies four main determinants of food security: food availabil-\nity, accessibility to food, food utilization, and the stability\nover time of the three previous dimensions; depletion in any\none of these leads to food insecurity.\nThe first crucial change from the supply-based food secu-\nusing Sen's entitlements approach (Sen, 1981).

The main conceptual out-\ncome of the 2010 International Scientific Symposium on\nBiodiversity and Sustainable Diets is the definition of sus-\ntainable diets as\nthose diets with low environmental impacts which contribute to\nfood and nutrition security and to a healthy life for present and\nfuture generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful\nof biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible,\neconomically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe\nand healthy while optimizing natural human resources. (FAO &\nIt is clear from this definition that the issue of sustainabil-\nity of diets closely refers to food and nutrition security. The\nsustainable diets definition establishes four main goals for\nthe governance of a future sustainable food system: human\nhealth and nutrition, cultural acceptability, economic viabil-\nity, and environmental protection (Fanzo, Cogill, & Mattei,\n2012). It highlights some crucial elements such as the impor-\ntance of biodiversity stocks not just for the agriculture and\nthe environment but also for adequacy to nutritional recom-\nmendations and cultural acceptability. The multiple condi-\ntions of sustainability clearly encompass several dimensions.\nThese conditions refer to different sets of capital that allow\nflows of services to be maintained over time. Stiglitz, Sen,\nand Fitoussi (2009) suggest that these welfare-producing ser-\nvices can be sustained over time when stocks of capital (nat-\nural, physical, human, and social) are transferred to future\ngenerations.\nThe analysis of the sustainability of food security requires\na shift toward a multidimensional vision (Pinstrup-Andersen,\n2009), but also a transversal approach across the multiple\nactivities leading to diets. Achieving both sustainability and\nfood security requires more than focusing on agriculture or\non markets or on household food baskets, but to look at the\noverall food system (Ingram, 2011). Sustainable food sys-\ntems are key for assuring sustainable food security (FAO &\nBioversity International, 2012), and they cannot be pursued\nin the absence of food and nutrition security (Buttriss &\nRiley, 2013). Food security and food system sustainability\nare then indispensable prerequisites to each other, and they\nneed to be jointly analyzed.\nPolicymakers and stakeholders play a key role in the gov-\nernance of future sustainable food systems, at a different spa-\ntial scale. They need evidence-based scientific information\nto define policy and implement actions (Barrett, 2010). The\naim of this article is to develop a conceptual framework,\napplied to the Mediterranean region, which links concepts,\nmethods, and metrics, for a multidimensional joint analysis\nof food and nutrition security and food system sustainability.\nBuilding on the resilience literature, the vulnerability\napproach (Turner et al., 2003) provides a systemic causal\npathway to analyze the impacts of the main drivers of change\non specific food security and nutrition outcomes. It allows\nunderstanding and assessing the conditions of sustainability\nof the food system. This article provides the conceptual\nbackground to develop metrics, relying on evidence-based\nscientific knowledge, to inform all stakeholders, particularly\npolicymakers, on response interventions to major changes at\nnational and regional scale, to maintain the ability of the sys-\ntem to provide food security and good nutrition over time,\nwhile taking into account environmental, social, and eco-\nnomic constraints and assets.\nWe first introduce the Mediterranean context and briefly\nreview the main issues related to food and nutrition security\nand food system sustainability in the region. Developed from\nnatural disaster and sustainability sciences, the vulnerability\nconceptual framework is presented as a valid approach to\ncapture and model food system sustainability. We then\nexpose the associated metrics--or information system--to\nquantify vulnerability that integrates three essential compo-\nnents: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (Turner et\nal., 2003). We finally discuss the utility of this approach with\nexamples of its possible application to Mediterranean\ncountries.\nFood Insecurity and Environmental\nUnsustainability: A Joint Regional\nAnalysis\nChanges in Dietary Patterns and Food Insecurity\nGlobally, more than 2 billion people are food insecure, either\nundernourished, malnourished, or overnourished (FAO,\nWorld Food Programme [WFP], & International Fund for\nWorld Health Organization [WHO], 2013). Concurrently,\nthere is a consensus among the international and scientific\ncommunity on the non-sustainability of the western agrofood\nsystem, in terms of its impacts on natural resources and eco-\nsystems, and on human health with increasing prevalence of\nnon-communicable diet-related diseases. The Mediterranean\nregion has been identified as one of the main critical hotspots\nof environmental unsustainability due to intense human\nactivity and agricultural exploitation (Capone, Lamaddalena,\nProsperi et al. 3\nlarge part of its population can also be considered food inse-\ncure. Using UN anthropometric and population composition\ndata,1 out of a total population of about 500 million, it is pos-\nsible to estimate that at least 215 million adults and children\n(44% of total population) are \"qualitative and quantitative\nfood-insecure\" in the Mediterranean region.2,3 The geo-\ngraphical zone represents an interesting testing area of study\nin which to carry out a multidimensional analysis of the\ninterconnected factors that characterize food insecurity and\nenvironmental unsustainability. In this section, we present a\njoint analysis of the current situation and show how both\nissues intersect.\nOn the supply side, all the dietary energy supplies (DES)\nof the Mediterranean countries4 largely exceed the average\ndietary energy requirements. At the same time, the majority\nof these countries are strongly dependent on imports, espe-\ncially for cereals (except France and Turkey). Furthermore,\nthe share of DES derived from cereals is still considerably\nLibya 49%, Turkey 48%; Food and Agriculture Organization\nCorporate Statistical Database [FAOSTAT] 2009, data avail-\nable in November 2013).5 This cereal-centered dependency\ncan lead to a regional and national vulnerability. In particu-\nlar, it occurs at the expense of middle- and low-income\ngroups, and of the national government expenditure. For\nexample, bread subsidies, amounting to US$2.5 billion per\nyear, were introduced in Egypt in 2008 (FAO, WFP, & IFAD,\n2012). It is also necessary to consider food price volatility, in\nparticular for cereals, as it affects consumers' capabilities to\naccess food. Other related socioeconomic factors also deter-\nmine access to food, such as adult literacy, which is still low\nMorocco 56%; United Nations Educational, Scientific and\nCultural Organization [UNESCO], data available in\nNovember 2013). As for the utilization dimension of food\nsecurity, nutritional value and food safety remain critical\nissues. Infant mortality (Morocco 28, Algeria 26, Egypt\nLibya 21%, Algeria 16%, Tunisia 9%), wasting (Morocco\n4%, Tunisia 3%), and underweight (Morocco 10%, Syria\n3%) are still considerably high (WHO, data available in\nNovember 2013). In addition to this, obesity and overweight\nare growing problems common to all the Mediterranean\ncountries, both for adults and for children. This double bur-\nden of malnutrition is manifest in Egypt with prevalence\nrates of 33% in adult obesity and 20% for child overweight,\nagainst 31% for child stunting. Overweight and obesity are\nalso risk factors in cardiovascular diseases, which contribute\nto 42% of all deaths in the Mediterranean (Rastoin & Cheriet,\nObesity is closely linked to dietary behavior and socio-\neconomic determinants but also to agricultural policies, pro-\nduction systems, and food chain characteristics (Delpeuch,\nMaire, Monnier, & Holdsworth, 2009). In the Northern\nMediterranean countries, these diet-related pathologies are\nthe symptoms of an overconsumption of meat (especially red\nmeat), dairy products, and eggs (Padilla, 2008), with a ten-\ndency toward overconsumption of energy-rich and nutrient-\npoor foods (Darmon & Soler, 2013). In Southern\nMediterranean, the double burden phenomenon represents\nthe chronic phase of a nutrition transition. Statistics show a\nchange of diet toward a regime that is richer in animal pro-\nteins and fats, at the expense of dietary diversity and food\nproviding important micronutrients (Popkin, 2003). At the\nsame time, supply shortage and struggle for access to food\nremain persistent for large cohorts of individuals. Another\nfeature of the nutrition transition in the Southern\nMediterranean countries is the change in the share of energy\nsources derived from added sugars, with increased intake of\nsimple carbohydrates and refined sugars (Drewnowski &\nPopkin, 1997) and, in particular, a sharp increase in levels of\nsimple sugar consumption through processed industrial\nproducts (drinks, biscuits, desserts, etc.; Padilla, 2008).\nHence, nutrition transition and malconsumption6 are the\ntwo major food phenomena leading to diet-related diseases\nin the Mediterranean. Nutrient-poor \"pseudo foods\" (Winson,\n2004) with high levels of vegetable oils, animal fats, sugar,\nand salt permeate the global food system (Popkin, 2005).\nLong-established dietary patterns and traditions using local\nstaples are being replaced with western-style highly pro-\ncessed products (Pingali, 2007). This is the case in emerging\neconomies that are experiencing several phenomena simulta-\nneously, such as increased urbanization, household income\ngrowth, greater market penetration by foreign brands, global\nsupermarket and food service chains, expansion of advertis-\ning and mass media, and highly competitive prices (Sage,\n2013). These dynamics lead to qualitative changes in diets\nand thus new food security issues, together with changes in\nlifestyle and work environment, with a growing tendency\ntoward sedentary jobs and physical activity increasingly\nbeing limited to leisure time (Gil, Gracia, & P\u00e9rez, 1995).\nThese changes in diets contribute, as causal factors, to the\nrising incidence of nutrition-related non-communicable dis-\neases, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and obesity.\nThe Associated Issue of Environmental\nUnsustainability\nThese dietary changes and the increasing incidence of related\ndiseases coincide with major transformations in the agricul-\ntural and food systems, which have become more global and\ncomplex. These evolutions in food behavior patterns and in\nindustrial production and processing have joint social, eco-\nnomic, and environmental impacts. It is a fact that\n4 SAGE Open\nthe nutritional characteristics of diets are directly related to\nenvironmental conditions, which are consequences of the\nproduction system associated with current food consumption\npatterns. The question is to understand to which extent. The\nenvironmental impact of the current agrofood system is a\nwidely debated question. Darmon and Soler (2013), for\ninstance, observe a positive correlation between calorie\nintake and greenhouse gas emissions. In any case, it should\nbe noted that the Mediterranean agrofood sector represents\n25% of the global Ecological Footprint of the region (Global\nThe current shift from diverse farming systems to eco-\nlogically simplified ones, mainly based on cereals, contrib-\nutes to micronutrient deficiency, poorly diversified diets, and\nthus malnutrition in developed, as well as in developing\ncountries (Frison, Smith, Johns, Cherfas, & Eyzaguirre,\nimportant negative outcome of intensive production, in addi-\ntion to environmental damage such as soil depletion and ero-\nsion, and pollution of surface and groundwater, is the\nnarrowing of biodiversity base through the use of only the\nmost profitable varieties. Many of the processes and much of\nthe equipment used in the food industry have been developed\nto transform staple foods with specific characteristics (e.g.,\nsize, color group, quality category, etc.). As a consequence,\ndespite an apparent diversity of the final products available\non the market for consumers, genetic resources diversity\ntends to shrink. Current industrial production systems favor\nlimited varieties and monocultures to the disadvantage of\nbiological diversity (Esnouf, Russel, & Bricas, 2013). The\nissue of biodiversity loss is related both to environmental\nconcerns and to health and nutrition issues, because of its\nlink with insufficient diet diversity, micronutrient deficiency,\nand unhealthy food habits (Burlingame, Charrondiere, &\nMouille, 2009). The importance of food variety and compo-\nsition, especially in terms of genetic resources, is increas-\ningly acknowledged. Differences in nutrients between\nvarieties have a major impact on nutrient intakes; higher con-\nsumption of one variety over another can lead to adequacy or\ndeficiency in certain micronutrients. For this reason, nutri-\ntion research looks at both the food composition and con-\nsumption dimensions (Burlingame et al., 2009). The alarming\nrate of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, and the\nconsequent negative impact on food and nutrition security,\nalso provide strong reasons to reconsider the food systems\nand diet approaches. It is necessary to develop and promote\nstrategies for sustainable food regimes, emphasizing the pos-\nitive role of biodiversity to reverse or mitigate the phenom-\nena that cogenerate negative effects on human nutrition and\nhealth (Burlingame, Charrondiere, Dernini, Stadlmayr, &\nMondov\u00ec, 2012). However, measuring food and nutritional\nbiodiversity is a difficult task; the International Network of\nFood Data Systems (INFOODS) network developed metrics\nthat need a large amount of data, which are difficult to\ncollect.\nThe environment throughout the entire geographic area of\nthe Mediterranean is at risk, threatened by the intensive\nexploitation of its natural resources, particularly water\nNations Environment Programme\u00adPlan Bleu, 2006).\nConsidering the increasing issue of drought in the region, the\nintensification of water requirements for food is a major con-\ncern (Capone et al., 2012). The high water demand of the\nMediterranean food system reveals a deficit in terms of vir-\ntual water exchange for agrofood products (Mekonnen &\nHoekstra, 2011).7 Water consumption trends are directly\nrelated to food consumption patterns as food products bring\nwith them an internal quantity of water that differs by food-\nstuff origin, quality, and quantity. Water requirements for\nplant and animal products vary widely. Red meat and dairy\nproducts, for example, are considered highly water-consum-\ning compared with crop production. Thus, the quantity and\ntypes of food demanded strongly implicate the extent of\nwater allocated and used for agriculture and related produc-\ntion activities (Lundqvist, de Fraiture, & Molden, 2008).\nWater consumption is therefore also connected to nutritional\ncomposition of food consumed and strictly related to life\nhabits and to drivers of change affecting the food system.\nThe relationship between unhealthy foods and highly\nenvironment-impacting foodstuff is tentatively captured by\nthe Barilla Center's Double Pyramid (Barilla Center for\nFood and Nutrition, 2010). Some argue that the more fre-\nquently recommended healthy food corresponds also to low-\nest environment-impacting products and vice versa.\nConsumption of red meat is, for example, often considered\nthe heaviest variable affecting the sustainability of food sys-\ntems and consumed in excessive amounts in developed\nHowever, evidence is mixed with regard to the general align-\nment of environmental and nutritional recommendations.\nFor instance, Vieux, Darmon, Touazi, and Soler (2012) show\nthat high nutritional quality is not always associated with low\ngreenhouse gas emissions. Certainly no single food can\nencompass the wide range of both nutritional and environ-\nmental recommendations, without even mentioning eco-\nnomic viability and social acceptability constraints.Amyriad\nof factors affecting both actors and activities within the food\nsystem explain the nutritional and environmental outcomes\nof dietary behaviors. Providing a clearer picture of the circu-\nlar dynamics between environmental, health, economic, and\nsocial drivers can help not only to measure impacts or prog-\nress but also to understand interactions, and thus aid decision\nmaking. We suggest tackling this complex challenge by\napplying the vulnerability framework to the changes affect-\ning the agrofood system.\nBuilding on Ingram (2011), we defend an approach to met-\nrics, which switches not only from the \"what we get\" (food\nsecurity outcome approach) to the \"what we do\" approach\n(food systems-activities approach; p. 419), but which also\nconsiders the \"what happens\" side (food system\u00addrivers\ninteractions). The Mediterranean region presents several\nProsperi et al. 5\nfactors of change affecting food security and environmental\nsustainability. The multiple issues related to food insecurity\nand unsustainability that have been exposed above for the\nMediterranean region can be analyzed from a multidimen-\nsional perspective, as a series of issues or hotspots of vulner-\nability of the different national agrofood systems, and\nintegrated within a conceptual framework linking concepts,\nmethods, and metrics.\nVulnerability for a Multidimensional\nand Dynamic System Approach\nMechanics of Change and Sustainability\nAccording to the definition of agro-ecosystem sustainability\ncoined by Conway (1985), \"Sustainability is the ability of a\nsystem to maintain productivity in spite of a major distur-\nbance, such as caused by intensive stress or a large perturba-\ntion\" (p. 35). Consistently with the literal English usage of\nthe verb \"to sustain,\" Hansen (1996) further interprets sus-\ntainability as a system's ability to continue through time. If\nsustainability is the dynamic ability of a given system to\nmaintain or enhance its essential outcomes over time and\nspace, then the concept of vulnerability can provide the ele-\nments to understand the mechanisms affecting the activities\nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP\u00ad\nDisaster Management Training Program, 1994) defines vul-\nnerability as the \"degree of loss to each element should a\nhazard of a given severity occur\" (p. 49), that is, the extent to\nwhich an individual or system or geographic area is damaged\nin relation to a given change. Downing (1990) states that\n\"vulnerability is the composite of two prospects: risk of\nexposure and risk (or magnitude) of consequence\" (p. 11).\nThe exposure to hazardous events is different from the mag-\nnitude of the consequences that result from that exposure.\nThe vulnerability approach further evolves with Turner et al.\n(2003), who established three main components to vulnera-\nbility: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.\nAdaptive--or copying--capacity corresponds to the\nresponses that it is possible to implement. The theoretical\nbasis for this evolution is to be found essentially in the theory\nof abilities and capabilities (Sen, 1981).\nThe vulnerability assessment is today widely acknowl-\nPanel on Climate Change [IPCC], 2001; Kelly & Adger,\nsingle or multiple stressors, and the adaptive capacity to cope\nwith these. Hughes et al. (2012) adopted such a conceptual\nframework to quantify the anthropic effects on coral reefs\nand national food security, developing a national-level vul-\nnerability index. In the case of the fresh fruit and vegetable\nvalue chains, the vulnerability approach was adopted to\nassess the strengths and weaknesses of Mediterranean pro-\nduction zones facing an increasing competition from South\nEast Mediterranean countries (Rastoin, Ayadi, & Montigaud,\n2007). The aim was to build an interregional diagnostic com-\nparison by means of a Regional Vulnerability Index (RVI).\nVulnerability is a relative measure, and the exposure of\nindividuals/systems/regions is related to their specific condi-\ntions. Similarly, the magnitude of the consequences from this\nexposure is linked to these particular characteristics and their\nassociated sensitivity. Most adaptive capacity analyses tend\nto be specific to a place and context while linked across\nscales (Turner et al., 2003), and vulnerability is most fre-\nquently assessed at national levels (Allison et al., 2009;\nbenefits of assessing vulnerability at the national level are\nthat results can influence national-level policy responses and\nadaptive management strategies (Hughes et al., 2012).\nA Causal-Factor Approach\nOne key conceptual element is a clear distinction between\ncausal events and outcomes (Dilley & Boudreau, 2001).\nFollowing the introduction by Sen (1981) of the notion of\naccessibility beyond availability as a main determinant of\nfamine, the analysis of food security shifted from a study of\nthe sole natural causes to the inclusion of societal causes\n(Blaikie, Cannon, Davis, & Wisner, 1994). The vulnerability\nframework was indicated to describe and assess the multifac-\neted socioeconomic determinants of famine (Borton &\n& Boudreau, 2001). The vulnerability approach, based on\nnatural disaster assessment, was then transposed to societal\ncauses for the analysis of food insecurity. In particular,\nefforts in converting Sen's analysis into assessment methods.\nThe main result was the expression \"vulnerability to famine\"\n(p. 233), which became widely popular. It was understood in\ndirect relation to the final outcome. However, Downing\n(1990) clearly stated that vulnerability is \"a relative measure,\nfor a given population or region, of the underlying factors\nthat influence exposure to famine and predisposition to the\nconsequences of famine\" (p. 18), aiming at identifying ele-\nments for a causal factor analysis.\nIn the food security context, the FAO specified that vul-\nnerability is the relationship between risks, resulting shocks,\nand resilience to these (FAO, 2004). The coupled risk\u00adshock\ncomponent affects population wellbeing and food security,\nwhereas resilience concerns the strategies implemented to\nmitigate the impact of the shocks. Vulnerability is under-\nstood as directly correlated to the impact of shocks and is\ninversely correlated to resilience (FAO, 2004). While the\nnatural disaster management approach to vulnerability\ninvolved the identification of a degree of damage on popula-\ntions or economic assets, food security specialists applied\n6 SAGE Open\nvulnerability to measure the intensity of the state of food\ninsecurity or famine (Dilley & Boudreau, 2001). Hence, it is\npossible to define the FAO vulnerability approach to food\nsecurity analysis as a direct \"outcome approach,\" while the\nnatural disaster method is rather a \"causal factor approach,\"\ndescribing the interactions leading to the final outcomes.\nGiven the wide and complex sequence of phenomena\ninvolved in food insecurity and environmental unsustainabil-\nity, the causal factor specification can also help to distinguish\nseveral vulnerabilities of specific issues or outcomes. It\nallows a dynamic analysis of the particular issues of vulner-\nability, instead of a static identification of vulnerability to a\nbroad and general final outcome. Furthermore, a broad\nunderstanding of vulnerability on a wide range of sectors or\nissues would not be sufficiently focused to implement actions\n(Eakin & Luers, 2006;Ionescu, Klein, Hinkel, Kumar, &\nity of the concepts of food security and sustainability, assess-\nments based on one element or one dimension are no longer\nconsidered sufficient (Aubin, Donnars, Supkova, & Dorin,\n2013). There is a rising call for new types of systems analysis\nand modeling tools (Nicholson et al., 2009). The fragmenta-\ntion of the broad concept of vulnerability in an integrated\ngeneral framework is a first response to this need.\nVulnerability has evolved as a term of art and a concep-\ntual framework to implement assessment methods in differ-\nent research areas, such as climate impact analysis\n(Timmerman, 1981), disaster management (United Nations\nDisaster Relief Organization [UNDRO], 1979), food secu-\ntainability science (Turner et al., 2003). The analysis of\nvulnerability can provide a conceptual and methodological\napproach to the understanding of sustainability. It offers a\nlogical conceptual basis and method upon which to build a\nmodeling causal framework that raises awareness on vulner-\nable people or entities to shocks, how and where the shocks\nmodified the living conditions, which are the response strate-\ngies, the identification of the multiple metrics that assess the\nphenomena. In addition, Turner et al. (2003) referred to vul-\nnerability assessment as a coupled human-environment sys-\ntem approach and reaffirmed the role of sustainability and\nglobal change science in improving the bonds between the\nscience problem and decision-making needs.\nMethodological Steps for the\nAssessment of Vulnerability\nA Composite Indicator\nA joint assessment of food insecurity and environmental\nunsustainability is strictly linked to the identification of a\nmethodological framework functioning as an architectural\nal. (2012), as in the vulnerability composite index of food\ninsecurity in Manarolla (1989), vulnerability is calculated\nthrough multidimensional score systems. The vulnerability\ncausal framework is modeled through three dimensions:\nexposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.\nExposure. Building on sustainability and natural disaster sci-\nences, exposure is considered as the degree to which a sys-\ntem experiences environmental or sociopolitical stress\n(Adger, 2006), including frequency, magnitude, duration,\nand the areal extent of the hazard (Burton, Kates, & White,\n1993). It can thus be interpreted as the likelihood of experi-\nencing stress or perturbations (Downing, 1990). For the pur-\npose of this work, we define exposure as the degree to which\na system or a country is subjected to changes directly causing\nor indirectly prompting food insecurity and environmental\nunsustainability. For instance, in a context of dependency on\ncereal imports, the share of cereals in total consumption can\nindicate the degree of exposure to cereal price volatility.\nExposure is directly correlated with vulnerability.\nSensitivity. Sensitivity can be defined as the consequence of\nthe exposure to a stress. It is the degree to which a system is\nmodified or affected by the perturbations or the outcome of\nan unwanted event to which the system is exposed (Adger,\n2006). It can be understood as the likelihood of experiencing\ndifferent magnitudes of consequences of exposure to a stress\nor perturbation (Downing, 1990). For instance, price elastici-\nties for cereals may represent the sensitivity to fluctuating\ninternational cereal prices, as they represent the effective\nimpact of the exposure. Indicators of sensitivity are generally\nmeasuring impacts. As for exposure, sensitivity is directly\ncorrelated with vulnerability.\nAdaptive capacity and resilience. The third component of vul-\nnerability, related to adaptive capacity, was defined as the\npotential of the system to respond to changes (Adger, Brooks,\nBentham, Agnew, & Eriksen, 2004; Burton, Huq, Lim, Pili-\nand Hughes et al. (2012) propose to disaggregate adaptive\ncapacity into several categories such as assets, flexibility,\nlearning, and social organization. In physics, resilience is the\nresistance of an object to a given shock. According to Ras-\ntoin et al. (2007), the concept of resilience is applicable to\nbiology and human sciences as the resistance of an individ-\nual or a community to an external stress. For instance, when\ncoupled, exposure and sensitivity negatively affect people's\nwelfare and food security status. In the case of food price\nvolatility, resilience contains all the coping strategies that\ncan be implemented or are already implemented to avoid\nexposure to risks and minimize impact sensitivity to the\nshock, to overcome detrimental effects. National and global\ninstitutions, for instance, by means of food price protection\npolicies, safety nets, and subsidies, can encourage these\nstrategies.\nIn an institutional context, resilience can represent stake-\nholders'reactive capacity to cope with changes. Stakeholders\nProsperi et al. 7\ncan respond with coping and adapting strategies to rule eco-\nnomic, finance, social institutional changes (North, 1991).\nSen (1985) similarly identifies for individuals the capacity to\nmanage opportunities deriving from risk effects, by means of\nthe concept of capabilities. The stakeholders, searching in\ntheir natural, human, physical, and social assets, take the\nopportunity of the environmental changes, transforming\nthese resources in capabilities, which allows overcoming the\nshocks' impacts and to be prepared for the next risks. For\nthese characteristics that identify resilience (or adaptive\ncapacity), the concept is often associated with sustainability\nassociated with risks and shocks impacts, resilience is\ninversely correlated with vulnerability (FAO, 2004). People\nwho overcome negative impacts of changes (and end up in\nan even better situation) would be resilient; those suffering\nfrom the effects of the modifications would be considered as\nCalculating a Vulnerability Score\nIn Rastoin et al. (2007), the estimation method is based on\nthe capabilities approach; vulnerability is then assessed\nsolely on the one component of adaptive capacity/resilience.\nIn a more general framework, this approach could be also\nassociated with the exposure and sensitivity dimensions.\nnerability as Exposure + Sensitivity - Adaptive Capacity\n(Figure 1). Lower levels of the final score indicate lower\nlevel of vulnerability. Following the original structure\ndesigned by Hughes et al. (2012), keeping the same logical\nsequence of signs, Figure 1 outlines several n vulnerabilities.\nThis specification of n different vulnerabilities of different\nissues to different drivers of change aims to capture the mul-\ntidimensional feature of sustainability.\nThe order and the signs used for the methods of calcula-\ntion of vulnerability define the relationships between the\nthree components. However, in a metric-identifying\napproach, the indicators come from different sources and\ndisciplines, and are expressed in different units of measure-\nment. Index values then need to be standardized or normal-\nized. In many cases (Cinner et al., 2012; The Economist\nization is based on minimum and maximum values in the\ndata set, and places on a scale from 0 to 1 (from 0 to 100 for\nthe Global Food Safety Initiative [GFSI], 2012) using the\ntypical normalization method \"min-max\" (Adger & Vincent,\n2005; Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and\ni X X X X X\nmin max min\n( ) = -\n( ) -\n( )\n/ .\nIn this formula, X\nmin\nand X\nmax\nare, respectively, the lowest\nand highest values for any given indicator. The normalized\nvalue is transformed from a 0 to 1 value to make it directly\ncomparable with other indicators. This means that the indica-\ntor with the highest raw data value will score 1, whereas the\nlowest will score 0.\nIn the examples referred to, the indicator scores are nor-\nmalized and then aggregated across categories to enable a\ncomparison of broader concepts across countries.\nNormalization rebases the raw indicator data to a common\nunit, so that it can be aggregated.\nFinally, in our specific case the n particular vulnerabilities\nwill be calculated following this formula:\nV\n=\n( )\n+( )\nmin max\n- -\n- -\n- - -\nmin max min\nmin max min\n/\n/\n/\nm\nmin\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\nwhere V = vulnerability, E = exposure, S = sensitivity, and\nAC = adaptive capacity.\nAnother issue that has to be considered is the quantitative\nrelevance, or weight, that is associated with the different\ncomponents. Different metric systems often rely on equal\nweights, leaving to policymakers, practitioners, and stake-\nholders the opportunity to apply a goal- or priority-oriented\nweighting system (The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2013;\nHammond, Keeney, & Raiffa, 1999; McClanahan et al.,\nBased on this approach, it would be possible to rank the\nMediterranean countries in relation to their exposure, sensi-\ntivity, and adaptive capacity vis-\u00e0-vis changes affecting\nagrofood systems in their food and nutrition security\noutcomes.\nDiscussion of the Approach\nMetrics, Analysis, and Prospective\nThe vulnerability approach stresses the need for methods and\nmetrics that do not just express final results or outcomes, but\nFigure 1. Calculation of vulnerability.\nSource: Adapted from Hughes et al. (2012).\n8 SAGE Open\nprovides a system of information that can be interpreted in a\ndynamic framework modeling interactions between different\ndrivers. In particular, the vulnerability framework can be dis-\naggregated in several dimensions according to the different\ndrivers of change considered: vulnerability to climate\nchange, vulnerability to price volatility, vulnerability to\ndemographic transformations, etc. The integrated fragmenta-\ntion of the broad vulnerability into specific vulnerabilities\nrepresents a response to the lack of causal factor analysis.\nAs mentioned above, each specific vulnerability can be\nfurther broken down into exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive\ncapacity. However, both the sensitivity and adaptive capacity\ndimensions of the system have to be assessed according to\nspecific outcomes or services provided by the food system\nthat need to be maintained over time. For instance, access to\nfood may be jeopardized in the short term by high food price\nvolatility; however, food supply might not be affected in the\nsame way or to the same extent. Thus, problematic issues or\nhotspots, related to the agrofood system and local context,\nneed to be specified. Three stages of causal factor analysis\ncan be established through the vulnerability framework. In a\nnutshell, the framework allows organizing evidence-based\ninformation and aiding decision-making by clarifying\nsequential dynamics, while allowing for prospective or for-\nward-looking analysis.\nTherefore, it is important to define issues and challenges\nof food security and sustainability before choosing assess-\nment methods (Aubin et al., 2013). The qualitative identifi-\ncation of the problematic issues, and then of the variables to\nassess vulnerability, can be obtained through a hierarchical\nanalysis (Rastoin et al., 2007), previous field observations\nand expert consultation, and using statistical methods such as\nprincipal components analysis (Jolliffe, 1986).\nThe vulnerability framework can lead, for example,\nthrough participatory methods, to the identification of a sys-\ntem of indicators and appropriate metrics, offering a method\nto capture complexity and interconnectedness between phe-\nFurthermore, as indicators inform action (Barrett, 2010),\nthey are essential to establish the communicative link\nbetween science and policymakers. One essential aim of the\nvulnerability analysis remains in the identification of the\nresponse opportunities for decision-making (Dilley &\nTo summarize, several functions can be attributed to the\nvulnerability approach, such as a holistic and novel assess-\nment framework and a dynamic tool for sustainability sci-\nences; a geographical-based approach involving the\nparticipation of local stakeholders; a multiple factor analysis\nallowing interdisciplinary research on complex and sys-\ntemic phenomena; a scheme to conceptualize and develop\nmetrics, in a system of information and response opportuni-\nties for decision making; a methodology to draw evidence-\nbased knowledge; a predictive framework to anticipate\nconsequences of hazards and changes (Adger, 2006; Dilley\nRastoin et al., 2007; Sonwa, Somorin, Jum, Bele, & Nkem,\nadvantages of a vulnerability approach to the analysis of\nsustainability of food system activities are summarized in\nTable 1.

The main risk is the lack\nof a genuine causal factors analysis that can be avoided by\ndisentangling the multiple vulnerabilities and their compo-\nnents. Thus, one crucial element in the application of the vul-\nnerability approach resides in the level of accuracy in\ndefining the problematic issues that are, in our specific case,\ndriven by nutrition and food security concerns of the agro-\nfood system.\nFurthermore, scholars and practitioners highly focused on\none specific scientific discipline may be skeptical with regard\nto the large amount of variables. However, the development\nof a multidimensional metrics framework can open a stimu-\nlating scientific debate involving experiences from several\ndisciplines and feed the scientific knowledge base. Indeed, as\nobserved in sustainability science and resilience thinking,\ninter- and trans-disciplinary communication is strictly linked\nto problem solving--instead of puzzle-solving--and related\nto participative creativity instead of dogmatism (Strunz,\n2012). So, the development of the framework aims to create\na flexible tool that can be adapted and modeled (as for a\nweighting system) to different users' and to different policy\npurposes related to nutrition and food security concerns. The\ninvolvement of the stakeholders is key to building up the\nframework and to assigning hierarchy to the indicators\nIn conclusion, this scheme provides a multidimensional\nvulnerability framework to jointly assess nutrition and food\ninsecurity and unsustainability. Starting from a specific geo-\ngraphical region, it represents a tool for policymakers. The\nMediterranean geographical area, as a physical space where\nseveral environmental, social and economic and nutrition\nhotspots of vulnerability persist over time, offers a first case\nof application. The last subsection presents an analysis of\nsome representative interactions between drivers of change,\nand food and nutrition security issues, together with the\ndescription of the resulting exposure, sensitivity, and adap-\ntive capacity.\nExamples of Application\nApplication of the vulnerability assessment framework\nrequires specifying the context and the issues of concern.\nThese can be identified by literature review or participative\nexpert consultation. The analysis of each specific issue or\nhotspot of vulnerability (of a given geographical area) allows\nus to establish from which point of the causal sequence of\nphenomena, the components of exposure, sensitivity, and\nadaptive capacity can be applied.\nFor the sake of illustration, we provide three examples of\nhow to apply the vulnerability model to the specific geo-\ngraphical Mediterranean region. Given the nutrition and food\nsecurity-driven perspective of this work, three main issues\ncritical to the food system, namely supply, accessibility, and\nnutritional value, are assessed, considering the three compo-\nnents of vulnerability. Each issue is analyzed against three\ndifferent landscape drivers of change, respectively, climate\nchange, price volatility and nutritional transition and chang-\ning consumption patterns. This selection of driver/issue com-\nbinations, restricted to three for the sake of illustration, does\nnot presume that the drivers cannot have impacts on several\nissues.\nFood supply\u00adrelated vulnerability to climate change.National\nfood supply rests on food production, stocks, and imports\n(minus exports). It relies also on quantities used from feed,\nseeds, and transformation. Depending on the agrofood policy\nstrategies and on their financial system conditions, a national\nfood system can be vulnerable because of several factors or\ndrivers affecting food supply. The conceptual model pro-\nvides an approach that develops a series of questions. A per-\ntinent question can be the following: To which extent are the\nMediterranean countries vulnerable to climate change to\nsupply sufficient food commodities?\nGiven the crucial issue around water supply in the\nMediterranean region, geographic indicators of the availabil-\nity and quality of water can be considered a relevant measure\nof the exposure of a national (or a subnational) food system\nto climate change in terms of provisioning of food.\nConsequently, sensitivity to this exposure can be expressed\naccording to the specific level of consumption of water-\ndemanding commodities by the households or the agroindus-\ntry. In response, agrobiodiversity could be an indicator of\nadaptive capacity to climate change, based on the assump-\ntion that biodiversity increases the stocks of crop material to\ndraw upon to select or develop more drought-resistant crops.\nAbility to import from less exposed agricultural systems to\nclimate change might be another indication of adaptive\ncapacity.\nFood accessibility\u00adrelated vulnerability to international price vola-\ntility.Food accessibility involves both physical access and\naffordability for individuals to adequate resource of food. A\nresearch question that emerges can be the following: To\nwhich extent are the Mediterranean countries vulnerable,\nconsidering their economic constraints, biophysical condi-\ntions, and social habits, in their access to adequate food in the\nface of high price volatility? Given the high cereal import\ndependency of some Mediterranean countries (for human\nconsumption, industry demand, and animal feeding), expo-\nsure could be assessed by considering the caloric share of\ncereals in a representative household's food basket: The\nmore cereals consumed, the higher the exposure for import-\ndependent countries. Price elasticities for cereals might offer\na proxy for countries' sensitivity to fluctuating international\ncereal prices. Conversely, analyzing food consumption pat-\nterns, and households' capacity to shift toward cheaper or\nlocally available food, while meeting the same caloric and\nnutritional requirements, may indicate strong adaptive\ncapacities. Cross-price elasticities illustrate substitution pos-\nsibilities. Countries can enhance this adaptive capacity by\nimplementing food policies that diversify supply sources, by\nacting directly on food prices (e.g., subsidies), by providing\nsocial nets for the population (e.g., food stamps) or promot-\ning diversity in consumption patterns.\nNutritional quality\u00adrelated vulnerability to nutritional transition\nand changing consumption patterns. Utilization encompasses\nall the factors related to how food is consumed and involves\nquality elements. In a nutrition-driven approach, we consider\nalso nutritional values of foods and adequacy of diets to\nnutrient recommendations. Therefore, the research question\nin our specific context can be the following: In which way\nand to which extent are the Mediterranean countries vulner-\nable, considering nutritional value and nutrient adequacy, to\nnutritional transition and changing consumption patterns?\nOver the past 50 years, the Mediterranean region has\nundergone important structural demographic and spatial\ntransformations with an increasing share of its population\nnow located in urban centers. Urbanization trends can be\nsuggested as a proxy for exposure to changing food con-\nsumption habits, on the assumption that urban and rural con-\nsumption patterns are significantly different. Correlated with\nurbanization, industry and labor structures can be selected to\nindicate to which extent Mediterranean countries are exposed\nto nutritional transition. Subsequently, countries and popula-\ntions manifest sensitivity to these exposures with critical\ndata on the prevalence of health problems directly related to\ndiet,suchasobesityorcardiovasculardiseases.Governments,\npolicymakers, and individuals can implement a set of tools to\nenhance adaptive capacity, such as ensuring an efficient\nhealth system, improving education and promoting food and\nhealthy eating and lifestyle habits, guiding consumption pat-\nterns, and raising awareness on these issues within institu-\ntions and the private sector.\nConclusion\nWhile securing food security is considered a global priority,\nthere is a contemporary widespread consensus about the\nimportance of sustainability as a goal for food systems. This\narticle provides a conceptual hierarchical framework for\nmodeling the complex relationships between food and nutri-\ntion security and sustainability. It initially analyzed the inter-\nnationally acknowledged concepts of sustainable\ndevelopment and food security, describing the interconnect-\nedness between them that recent notions such as sustainable\nfood security or sustainable diets try to capture.\nRelying on an approach of the concept of sustainability as\na system property allowing a desirable state to be \"sustained\"\nover generations, assessment methodologies should reflect\nthe conditions of a system from a holistic and dynamic\nperspective. Calling on elements from the vulnerability and\nresilience literature, the proposed framework sequentially\ndisentangles the exposure, sensitivity, and copying/adaptive\ncapacities of a specific food system to identified stressors or\ndrivers of change jeopardizing critical food and nutrition\nsecurity outcomes.\nThis approach entails also the assessment of sustainability\nwith regard to a suitable temporal and spatial scale. Drivers\naffecting the sustainability of the food systems have multiple\norigins. The proposed framework hierarchically clarifies the\ndifferent scale at which drivers and issues interact in a circu-\nlar way with feedback loops. While suitable for expressing\nthe global food-related concerns of a geographical region, it\npoints out the need for assessment tools adapted to context-\nspecific questions. Main data and general insights of the situ-\nation of the Mediterranean region help underline the main\ncritical issues related to food and nutrition security facing the\nagrofood system in the region.\nA quantitative method is proposed for assessing sustain-\nability of food and nutrition outcomes by means of a precise\ncorrelation between the three components of exposure, sen-\nsitivity, and adaptive capacities, which can ultimately be\naggregated in a composite index. The joint assessment of\nfood insecurity and unsustainability can be expressed through\nthe language of vulnerability and resilience, as the degree to\nwhich a system is exposed and sensitive to dynamic phenom-\nena, while considering its capability to respond and adapt.\nThis approach provides the concepts fundamental to the\ndevelopment of potential indicators or metrics of sustainable\ndiets and food systems, whose primary goal is to ensure food\nsecurity and good nutrition for a healthy and active life.\nAuthors' Note\nP.Prosperi and T.
