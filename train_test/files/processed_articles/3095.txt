Dietz, MD, PhD\nsyndrome are at increased risk\nfor developing diabetes melli-\ntus1 and cardiovascular dis-\nease2 as well as increased mortality from\ncardiovascular disease and all causes.3\nThe recently released Third Report of\ntheNationalCholesterolEducationPro-\ngram Expert Panel on Detection, Evalu-\nation, and Treatment of High Blood\nCholesterol in Adults (Adult Treat-\nment Panel III) (ATP III) draws atten-\ntion to the importance of the meta-\nbolic syndrome and provides a working\ndefinition of this syndrome for the first\ntime.4 The prevalence of the meta-\nbolic syndrome as defined by ATP III\nin the United States is unknown. Be-\ncause the implications of the meta-\nbolic syndrome for health care are sub-\nstantial, we sought to establish the\nprevalence of this condition.\nMETHODS\ntive sample of the civilian noninstitu-\ntionalized US population was re-\ncruited into the Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) using a multistage, strati-\nfied sampling design.5,6 After an inter-\nview in the home, participants were in-\nvited to attend 1 of 3 examination\nsessions: morning, afternoon, or\nevening.\nAs detailed in the ATP III report, par-\nticipants having 3 or more of the fol-\nlowing criteria were defined as having\nthe metabolic syndrome:\n1.

Limited information is available about the prevalence of\nthe metabolic syndrome in the United States, however.\nObjective To estimate the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in the United States\nas defined by the ATP III report.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Analysis of data on 8814 men and women aged\n20 years or older from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(1988-1994), a cross-sectional health survey of a nationally representative sample of\nthe noninstitutionalized civilian US population.\nMain Outcome Measures Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome as defined by\nATP III (3 of the following abnormalities): waist circumference greater than 102 cm\nin men and 88 cm in women; serum triglycerides level of at least 150 mg/dL (1.69\nmmol/L); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of less than 40 mg/dL (1.04 mmol/L)\nmm Hg; or serum glucose level of at least 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L).\nResults The unadjusted and age-adjusted prevalences of the metabolic syndrome\nthrough 69 years and aged at least 70 years, respectively. Mexican Americans had the\nhighest age-adjusted prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (31.9%). The age-\nadjusted prevalence was similar for men (24.0%) and women (23.4%). However, among\nAfrican Americans, women had about a 57% higher prevalence than men did and\namong Mexican Americans, women had about a 26% higher prevalence than men\ndid. Using 2000 census data, about 47 million US residents have the metabolic syn-\ndrome.\nConclusions These results from a representative sample of US adults show that the\nmetabolic syndrome is highly prevalent. The large numbers of US residents with the\nmetabolic syndrome may have important implications for the health care sector.\n3. Low high-density lipoprotein\nmmol/L) in women;\nmm Hg;\nWe counted participants who re-\nported currently using antihyperten-\nsive or antidiabetic medication (insu-\nlin or oral agents) as participants with\nhigh blood pressure or diabetes, re-\nspectively. Serum triglycerides were\nmeasured enzymatically after hydroly-\nzation to glycerol (Hitachi 704 Ana-\nlyzer; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). High-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol was\nmeasured following the precipitation of\nother lipoproteins with a heparin-\nmanganese chloride mixture (Hitachi\n704 Analyzer). Serum glucose concen-\ntration was measured using an enzy-\nmatic reaction (Cobas Mira assay;\nRoche, Basel, Switzerland). Details\nabout the laboratory procedures of all\nthese tests are published elsewhere.6\nThree blood pressure readings were ob-\ntained in the mobile examination cen-\nter. The average of the second and third\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure\nreadings were used in the analyses.\nFor men and nonpregnant women\naged at least 20 years who attended the\nmedical examination and who had\nfasted at least 8 hours, we calculated the\nprevalence of the metabolic syndrome\nby age, sex, and race or ethnicity (white,\nAfrican American, Mexican Ameri-\ncan, other). We calculated estimates us-\ning the sampling weights so that the es-\ntimates are representative of the civilian\nnoninstitutionalized US population. All\nanalyses were done by using SUDAAN\nto obtain proper variance estimates be-\ncause of the complex sampling de-\nRESULTS\nAmong men, whites and Mexican\nAmericans had the highest age-\nadjusted prevalences of abdominal obe-\nsity, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL\ncholesterol concentration (TABLE 1).\nAfrican American men had the high-\nest age-adjusted prevalence of hyper-\ntension, and Mexican American men\nhad the highest age-adjusted preva-\nlenceofhyperglycemia.Amongwomen,\nMexican Americans and African Ameri-\ncans had the highest age-adjusted\nprevalence of abdominal obesity. Afri-\ncan American women had the highest\nage-adjusted prevalence of high blood\npressure, and Mexican American\nwomen had the highest age-adjusted\nprevalences of hypertriglyceridemia,\nlow HDL cholesterol concentration, and\nhyperglycemia.\nOverall, the unadjusted and age-\nadjusted prevalences of the metabolic\nspectively (TABLE 2).

Among whites and\nparticipants of the other race or ethnic\ngroup, men and women had a similar\nprevalence of the metabolic syndrome\n(FIGURE 2).

Previous es-\ntimates of the prevalence of the meta-\nbolic syndrome in the United States and\nEurope have differed because of differ-\nences in definitions and populations\nin the prevalence of obesity in the\nUnited States17 suggests that the cur-\nrent prevalence of the metabolic syn-\ndrome is now very likely higher than\nNHANES III data. Even if prevalence\nrates remained unchanged, the total\nnumber of people with the metabolic\nsyndrome would have increased be-\ncause of population growth during the\nInsulin resistance is thought to be an\nunderlying feature of the metabolic syn-\ndrome.18 Genetic abnormalities, fetal\nmalnutrition, and visceral adiposity may\nplay roles in the pathophysiology of in-\nsulin resistance and the metabolic syn-\ndrome.19 Although insulin resistance\namongpatientswiththeindividualcom-\nponents of the metabolic syndrome is\ncommon, significant proportions of\nthese patients do not have insulin resis-\ntance. Some studies have suggested that\nhypertensionisnotstronglylinkedtothe\nmetabolic syndrome.20\nThe cornerstones of treatment are the\nmanagement of weight and ensuring ap-\npropriate levels of physical activity.

Lack of reim-\nbursement for weight management and\nphysical activity interventions consti-\ntutes a major barrier. Significant ef-\nforts are needed to close the gap be-\ntween current and desirable practice\npatterns.\nThe high prevalence of this condi-\ntion may also have serious implica-\ntions for US health care costs. Thus,\nstudies of the direct medical costs as-\nsociated with the metabolic syndrome\nare urgently needed. Because the root\ncauses of the metabolic syndrome for\nthe overwhelming majority of pa-\ntients are improper nutrition and in-\nadequate physical activity, the high\nprevalence of this syndrome under-\nscores the urgent need to develop com-\nprehensive efforts directed at control-\nlingtheobesityepidemicandimproving\nphysical activity levels in the United\nStates.\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design: Ford,\nGiles.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Ford, Dietz.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Ford, Dietz.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important\nintellectual content: Ford, Giles.\nStatistical expertise: Ford, Giles.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Dietz.\nStudy supervision: Ford.\nREFERENCES\n1.
