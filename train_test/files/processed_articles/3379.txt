Using an informational experiment in Bangladesh, we find that information about US financing of a specific\ndevelopment intervention sends a positive signal about project quality; this effect is concentrated among individuals who\nare the least likely to have been exposed to the information ex ante. The information does not change the already high\ndemand for foreign aid but does help citizens target their demands toward the existing donor. That foreign funding can\nbe a signal of project quality helps explain an existing finding in the literature that individuals prefer foreign aid projects\nto government projects.\n",

Governments use money obtained\nfrom bilateral or multilateral donors to build roads, schools,\nor irrigation systems. International non-governmental\norganizations (INGOs) use donor funds or privately-raised\nfunds to train health workers or provide microloans. Local\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs) receive external\nfunding from foreign governments or INGOs to undertake\nlivelihood training or manage local water sources.\nIncreasingly, foreign aid donors undertake aggressive\nbranding strategies to spread information about their role in\nlocal development projects (see the discussion in Dietrich\net al., Forthcoming). It is not obvious, however, that citi-\nzens absorb this information (Baldwin and Winters, 2016;\nCruz and Schneider, 2017; Dietrich et al., Forthcoming;\nGuiteras and Mobarak, 2014); nor is it clear how this infor-\nmation influences how citizens perceive and choose to\ninteract with development projects. A recent set of studies\nis helping to build up our knowledge base (Baldwin and\nWinters, 2016; Dietrich et al., Forthcoming; Dietrich and\net al., Forthcoming; Milner et al., 2016).\nfrom a nationally-representative survey in Uganda to show\nthat Ugandan citizens prefer foreign-funded development\nprojects over projects that the authors assume citizens iden-\ntify as government-funded.1 They find that this preference\nis particularly pronounced among individuals who do not\nsupport the national ruling party and who perceive corrup-\ntion to be significant within the government. Based on\nthese findings, the authors claim that citizens support for-\neign-funded projects because they view them as likely to\nperform better as they are more impartially implemented\nWe conduct an information experiment in which we\ndescribe an existing development intervention to a nation-\nally-representative sample of Bangladeshi citizens. For a\nrandom subset of our respondents, we provided informa-\ntion \u00ad through visual cues, direct information, and ques-\ntions related to the information \u00ad that the intervention was\nsupported with US funding. The treatment did not contain\nany reference to better performance. When comparing how\nrespondents assessed performance across the treatment and\ncontrol groups, we can be confident that any differences in\nperceived project quality result from respondents evaluat-\ning information about foreign funding.\nIf information about foreign funding has a positive effect\non perceptions of project performance, this might tell us\nPerceptions of foreign aid project\nquality in Bangladesh\nMatthew S.

It might also suggest that donor branding has\npositive externalities insofar as branding encourages indi-\nviduals to engage with development interventions.\nIn line with the existing literature, we find that respond-\nents who have received information about foreign funding\nbelieved the project was performing better. These treatment\neffects are concentrated among individuals who do not\nhave previous experience with the project. The treatment\ndid not encourage respondents to say that Bangladesh\nshould seek foreign aid for expansion of the intervention.\nIndeed, the vast majority of respondents in both treatment\nand control conditions supported the government's pursuit\nof foreign aid. The information, however, did help respond-\nents focus on the existing donor when identifying a foreign\nsource from which Bangladesh should seek financing.\nResearch design\nIn September 2014, we conducted a nationally-representative,\nface-to-face household survey of 2294 Bangladeshis recruited\nfrom 55 sub-districts (upazila) across the seven divisions of\nBangladesh.2 After two initial questions about important pol-\nicy issues and the current state of affairs in Bangladesh, all\nrespondents watched a one-minute video about the Smiling\nSun Clinics, a nationwide network of health clinics that have\nbeen partially funded by the US Agency for International\nDevelopment (USAID) since the late 1990s. Before begin-\nning the video, we asked respondents if they were familiar\nwith the clinics and if they, a family member, or a close friend\nhad ever been to one of the clinics.\nIn the control version of the survey, the video featured a\nstrip at the bottom with the Smiling Sun logo and name. In\nthe treatment version of the survey, this strip was replaced\nwith one featuring the USAID/Bangladesh logo and the\nconventional USAID tagline (written in Bangla), \"On\nbehalf of the American people.\" Immediately following the\nvideos, we asked respondents an open-ended question\nabout where \"most of the financial assistance for the\nSmiling Sun Clinics\" had come from. Among the treatment\ngroup that had seen the USAID-branded video, one quarter\nof respondents said that the United States had provided the\nfunding, while another 3% stated generically that it was\nforeign aid. The modal response \u00ad provided by 69% of\nrespondents \u00ad was that they did not know where the\nfunding came from. In the control group, 1 out of 10\nrespondents said that the United States provided the fund-\ning. Among previous users in the control group, this pro-\nportion was as high as one in four. Like the treatment group,\n4% of control-group respondents named generic \"foreign\naid\" as the source of funding, and the modal response \u00ad\n81% of the control group \u00ad was that they did not know. In\nboth groups, only 3% of respondents attributed the program\nto the government.\nAssuming that not everyone in the treatment group\nwould observe or correctly interpret the USAID banner on\nthe video, we structured the intervention such that, after\nshowing the video to the respondents, our enumerators\ndirectly told respondents that the Smiling Sun Clinics are\npartially funded by the United States:\nSince 2007, the United States has been giving assistance to\nbuild Smiling Sun Clinics in Bangladesh. The funds have been\nprovided through USAID. The United States has provided\nmore than 4,500 million taka [US$57 million] in support of the\nSmiling Sun Clinics.\nThe respondents who received this information were then\nasked if they knew why the United States was providing the\nfunding and whether they thought it was a good idea for\nBangladesh to accept money from the United States. We did\nnot ask an additional question to see if those respondents\nwho had not observed the USAID banner in the video had\nupdated their beliefs about the origins of Smiling Sun Clinic\nfunding after the direct information. Table 1 depicts the\nthree stages of the treatment in the context of the survey.\nFor our main outcome variable, we asked respondents in\nboth the control and treatment conditions, \"Do you think\nthat the Smiling Sun Clinics have been successful in pro-\nviding health care to the poorest people in Bangladesh?\"\nAnswers were recorded as simple yes or no responses.\nSubsequently, we asked all respondents, \"If the govern-\nment wants to expand the Smiling Sun Clinics, in your\nopinion, what is the best way for the government to finance\nthis expansion?\" Respondents could choose from the fol-\nlowing responses: that the government should (1) impose\nnew taxes and fees, (2) get money from foreign countries,\n(3) inspire NGOs to open clinics, or (4) not increase the\nnumber of Smiling Sun Clinics.\nRegardless of a respondent's answer to the question\nabove, we then asked, \"If the government invites a foreign\nTable 1.

As we\ndescribed above, about 10% of the control group correctly\nsaid that the United States had provided funding for the\nclinics. Within the control group, therefore, we know that\nthere is \"non-compliance\" that might bias against observ-\ning effects. We report intention-to-treat results.\nIn Table 2, we present the results for the perceptions of\nproject success variable. The first column reveals that\nrespondents in the treatment group (i.e., those who\nwatched the US-branded video and who were told about\nand asked to consider US funding for the Smiling Sun\nClinics) were 10 percentage points more likely to say that\nthe project was successful in fulfilling its anti-poverty\nmission. This is a remarkable result. By virtue of random\nassignment, respondents in the control and treatment con-\nditions were equally likely to have previously used the\nclinics (16% of our respondents) or to say that they were\npreviously aware of the clinics (48% of our respondents,\nincluding those who said that they were previous users).\nThey both watched a one-minute video with the same con-\ntent about the clinics. The difference between the two\ngroups was that the treatment group saw the USAID\nbranding during the video and was given information\nabout US funding flows to the clinics. Yet respondents in\nthis group expressed significantly more confidence that\nthe Smiling Sun Clinics were performing well.\nIn the next two columns of Table 2, we compare the\nresults for those who had previously used the clinics and\nthose who have not (but who may have been aware of\nthem). Among previous users, there were very strong\nbeliefs that the Smiling Sun Clinics were performing well:\n96% of these respondents said that was the case. Insofar as\nwe see a difference between the treatment and control con-\nditions, it is in the same direction as in the overall sample,\nwith those in the treatment condition being additionally\nlikely to have said that the clinics are successful. Given the\nsmall treatment effect, this difference is not statistically sig-\nnificant at conventional levels. Among respondents who\nhave not previously used the clinics, we see a statistically\nsignificant 12 percentage-point difference in perceptions of\nproject success. In the final two columns, we show the\ntreatment effects for respondents who were previously\naware of the clinics but did not report using them as well as\nfor respondents who were not at all previously aware. We\nfind the largest treatment effect \u00ad 14 percentage points \u00ad\namong respondents who said that they were not previously\nfamiliar with the clinics. But even among those who had\nsome awareness of \u00ad but no personal interactions with \u00ad the\nclinics, the treatment had a relatively large 9 percentage-\npoint effect on perceptions of performance.\nThat the results vary by the respondents' prior levels of\nawareness of the clinics is not surprising. Those who had\npersonal experience with the clinics appear to have had\nvery positive perceptions of the clinics: as compared to\nnon-previous users, this group was 22 percentage points\nmore likely in the control condition to say that the clinics\nwere successful (p < 0.01). It would have been hard for the\ninformation about US funding to have improved their per-\nceptions further (although the point estimate is positive).\nThose who were aware of the clinics but had not previ-\nously used them also expressed generally positive attitudes\nabout the clinics in the control group but significantly\nmore positive attitudes in the treatment condition. And\nthose who had neither previous experience with nor aware-\nness of the clinics expressed the lowest levels of confi-\ndence in the clinics in the control condition (63%), such\nthat we find the largest treatment effect among this group.\nTable 2.

As Table 3\nshows, in the overall sample, slightly more than three-\nquarters of respondents in both the treatment and control con-\nditions believed that the government should pursue foreign\naid to finance an expansion of the clinic program. This gener-\nally positive attitude toward foreign aid is in line with the\nfindings in the work of Milner et al. (2016) in Uganda.\nWe note one exception to this result: previous users in\nthe control group were 9 percentage points less likely than\nnon-previous users in the control group to believe that for-\neign aid should be used to finance the expansion of the\nSmiling Sun Clinics (p < 0.02). These respondents were\nmore likely than other respondents to say that the clinics\nshould be expanded using tax and fee revenue (14% versus\n7%, p < 0.01). This may be because they thought of the\nSmiling Sun Clinics as a government program. When\ninformed about US funding, the preferences of previous\nusers in the treatment group fell in line with the rest of the\nsample: more than three-quarters said that the government\nshould pursue foreign aid to finance expansion. The treat-\nment effect is statistically significant.\nAlthough the information about US financing did not\nmake Bangladeshis more likely on average to say that the\ngovernment should pursue foreign funding for the Smiling\nSun Clinics, it did help them coordinate their expectations\non asking the existing donor. As can be seen in Table 4, in\nboth the overall data and across the various subgroups at\nwhich we have looked, the treatment made respondents\nmore likely to say that the Bangladeshi government should\nappeal to the United States if it was going to appeal to a\nforeign donor. In both the treatment and control conditions,\nafter the United States, the most popular sources of foreign\naid were the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank,\nJapan, India, China, and the United Kingdom.\nDiscussion\nWe showed a one-minute video about the Smiling Sun\nClinics, a nationwide system of health clinics that provide\nservices to women and children from impoverished house-\nholds, to a representative sample of Bangladeshi citizens.\nFor a random subset of respondents, the video was branded\nwith the USAID/Bangladesh logo. We additionally informed\nthese respondents about US funding for the network of\nhealth clinics and asked them to consider why the United\nStates was giving money to Bangladesh and whether it was\na good or a bad thing. We did not, however, give these indi-\nviduals direct information about the performance of the\nclinics. Nonetheless, relative to a control group that we did\nnot inform about US funding, we find that those respondents\nTable 3.

These\neffects are particularly concentrated among individuals who\neither were not previously aware of the clinics or who were\naware of them but had not previously used them.\nThat information about foreign funding serves as such a\npowerful cue of project quality is remarkable. While our\nsurvey lacks the diagnostic questions to understand exactly\nwhat the presence of foreign funding signaled to these\nrespondents (e.g., freedom from corruption, higher quality\nsupplies, better-trained staff), the evidence shows that peo-\nple are updating their overall opinions of the project in\nresponse to our informational intervention.\nAs Milner et al. (2016) suggest about their results in\nUganda, we can read our findings as evidence that individ-\nuals in Bangladesh generally perceive US foreign aid to be\neffective. If the opposite were true (i.e., that Bangladeshis\nperceived US foreign aid to be ineffective), we would\nexpect people to reduce their expectations of Smiling Sun\nClinic performance when hearing about the US role in\nfinancing the intervention. Whether these perceptions are\nbased on empirical experience with and comparisons\nbetween accurately-identified US-funded and government-\nfunded projects or rather a vaguer perception of foreign\nthings being good is a question worthy of further\nexploration.\nLikewise, whether or not we would see similar results\nfor projects funded by other donors or occurring in other\nsectors also remains an open question. For instance, it is\npossible to imagine that some foreign donors in some con-\ntexts might develop a reputation for low-quality projects, in\nwhich case we would not expect to identify the same\neffects. Or it might be the case that citizens are less likely to\ndraw inferences about quality from information about for-\neign funding in some sectors (e.g., if the United States were\nto fund police training, it might not be the case that citizens\nautomatically viewed the police as higher quality).\nWe can perhaps gain some insight into this by looking at\nthe 80% of our respondents who described health care as a\n\"very important\" issue. Among this subset of respondents,\nwe observe a 12 percentage-point difference between the\ntreatment and control conditions in the probability of say-\ning the Smiling Sun Clinics were successful. For other\nrespondents \u00ad those who said that health care was \"unim-\nportant\" or \"somewhat important\" \u00ad the treatment effect is\nhalf as large and not statistically significant. This might\nsuggest that our results are driven by public concerns about\nthe government-run healthcare system.3\nIf our finding is representative of what we might expect\nof foreign aid from different donors in a variety of sectors,\nour results can be taken as indicating a possible benefit of\nforeign aid branding.Although Dietrich et al. (Forthcoming)\nargue that relatively few individuals receive the message\nbeing sent by the USAID brand, our results suggest that\nwhen people do receive this information, they might be\nmore likely to actively engage with development interven-\ntions that will theoretically benefit them.4 If this is the case,\nthen donor branding \u00ad even if its goal is to realize diplo-\nmatic outcomes (as argued in Dietrich et al., Forthcoming)\n\u00ad might actually help development projects meet their\ndevelopment goals. On those grounds, the practice perhaps\nshould perhaps be encouraged, although we worry about\nthe implications for long-term sustainability (i.e., ideally,\nlocal services will be provided by domestic governments in\nthe long-term and people will embrace using them even\nthough they are coming from domestic governments).\nAs most of the respondents in our sample already are\nquite positive about foreign aid \u00ad three-quarters of them\nsupport the government seeking out foreign aid if it wants\nto expand the Smiling Sun Clinics program \u00ad we do not\nfind overall effects of the informational treatment on\ndemand for foreign aid, although we do find effects among\nprevious users of the clinics. We find that the information\nabout US funding helps respondents to coordinate their\nexpectations about which donor the government should\nask, being more likely to name the United States in the\ntreatment condition, even though they also name a number\nof other major donors, such as the World Bank, the Asian\nDevelopment Bank, and Japan.\nThere remains much to be learned about how individu-\nals in aid-receiving countries perceive foreign aid. As the\ndiscussion in Brass (2016) makes clear, certain common\nassumptions about how foreign aid and non-governmental\nservice delivery will be perceived do not play out on the\nground. Our study suggests that foreign funding signals\nsomething to citizens about the quality of a development\nproject. What exactly it signals and why are questions for\nfuture investigation.\n"
