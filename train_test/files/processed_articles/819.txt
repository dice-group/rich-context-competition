Although most prior research suggests the CES-D has four factors, prior\nresearch also suggests that the factor structure of the CES-D may vary with culture. In addition, previous theory\nand research on other depression inventories suggest only two factors: a general depression factor and a psycho-\nlogical well-being factor. The current study determines the number of factors for the CES-D in the Hispanic Estab-\nlished Populations for Epidemiologic Studies (H-EPESE) survey fN = 2,536) and in a previous study of elderly\nMexican Americans living in San Antonio, Texas (\nT\nV = 330). The factor analytic results argue strongly for the\ntwo-factor model, and this model is the only structure that yielded consistent results across subgroups (e.g., male vs\nfemale or Spanish vs English language of interview). We conclude that the CES-D has only two factors among\nelderly Mexican Americans.\nTHE Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression\nScale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) has been widely used as\nan indicator of depressive affect (Roberts and Vernon, 1983;\nWeissman et al., 1977) including research on elderly persons\net al., 1986). Factor analyses of the CES-D usually have\nfound four dimensions of somatic symptoms, depressive\naffect, positive affect, and interpersonal behavior (Gatz et al.,\n1995). However, some cultures may express depression\nmore somatically than in terms of affect leading to a blurring\nof the somatic and affect factors (Angel and Thoits, 1987;\nresearch suggests that culture may influence the CES-D\nstructure in other ways. For example, Liang et al. (1989) in a\nMexican American sample found support for a three-factor\nmodel of somatic symptoms, depressed affect, and positive\naffect. In this sample, the interpersonal factor was not pres-\nent, and the somaticism and affect factors did not blur\ntogether. The current study attempts to determine the factor\nstructure of the CES-D for elderly Mexican Americans.\nThere are several reasons why the standard four-factor\nsolution for the CES-D may not apply for elderly Mexican\nAmericans. First, this solution is somewhat inconsistent\nwith the structure of other widely used depression invento-\nries with similar items that have found only two factors:\none general depression factor and a second positive affect\nfactor (Aneshensel, Clark, and Fredrichs, 1983; Catanzaro,\n1993). These two dimensional structures are consistent\nwith theory (Watson and Clark, 1984) and research (Costa\native affect and well-being are the two major dimensions of\nemotion. In support of the two-dimensional theory, research\nsuggests that the CES-D may have two higher order factors\nargument against the four-factor structure is the finding that\nfour-factor solutions have varied so that the same items\nhave not always been assigned to the same factors produc-\ning a somewhat inconsistent pattern of results (for a review,\nThe problem of inconsistent four-factor solutions can be\nproduced by using a factor solution that specified too many\nfactors (Kim and Mueller, 1978). The use of scales based\non these mispecified solutions can produce unreliable\nscales that share common variance with other scales (Hert-\ntent patterns of results (Kim and Mueller, 1978) that can\nlead to a lack of consensus regarding which items appear\non each subscale (Liang et al., 1989). Furthermore, this\ntype of faulty subscale construction can contribute to con-\nfusion regarding how to conceptualize the symptomatology\nIn addition to these methodological issues, factor structure\nmay vary with culture (Angel and Thoits, 1987; Dick et al.,\n(Gatz and Hurwicz, 1990). For all of these reasons, there is a\nneed to determine the optimal number of subscales that can\nbe used for elderly Mexican American populations.\nPrevious Research\nKrause and Markides (1985) found four factors for the\nCES-D in a Mexican American sample, although a reanaly-\nsis of the same data identified a more parsimonious three-\nfactor structure that was valid for subjects aged 65 to 80\n(Liang et al., 1989). In another Mexican American sample of\ntor analysis where the number of factors was determined by\nscree plots and conceptual content. The factor solution they\nfound is identical to Radloff's (1977) original four factors,\nalthough three items did not load highly on any factor.\nThe Hispanic HANES study of 3,117 Mexican American\nadults reported a three-factor solution (Guarnaccia, Angel,\nand Worobey, 1989). However, these researchers used prin-\ncipal components analysis with an orthogonal (varimax)\nrotation. Prior studies have found high correlations between\nCES-D factors, so results will vary when the more appro-\npriate oblique rotation method is used (Hertzog, 1989).\nAnother analysis of the same data examined the 329 sub-\njects who were 60 years old or older using oblique (pro-\nmax) rotation. This analysis found a four-factor solution\n(Garcia and Marks, 1989), although the results suggest that\ntoo many factors may have been selected. Seven items did\nnot load on any factor using the usual correlation greater\nthan .40 criterion, and many items loaded on more than one\nfactor. These results suggest that too many factors were\nextracted prior to rotation (Kim and Mueller, 1978).\nMethodological Issues\nIn recent years, several methodological improvements\nhave been developed for confirmatory factor analysis\n(CFA). These new methods may produce different results\nthan prior research based on exploratory factor analyses\n(EFA) or earlier versions of CFA. First, newly developed\nmultiple indicators, multiple causes (MIMIC) CFA models\nallow for the testing of factor structure and the effects of\nbackground variables simultaneously (Muthen, 1989). For\nexample, researchers can test whether the model is general-\nizable across important background variables for research\non Mexican Americans such as age, gender, and language\nof interview.\nIn addition, MIMIC models allow for the testing of item\nbias. MIMIC model testing for item bias is superior to pre-\nviously used methods because MIMIC models give sepa-\nrate estimates of the degree to which an item is biased and\nthe degree to which the latent depression variable is gen-\nuinely correlated with the potential biasing factor (e.g.,\ngender). For MIMIC models, item bias on the CES-D is\ndefined as an item that is more highly correlated with a\npotential biasing factor beyond what would be expected\nbased on the relationship between the latent variable of\ndepression and the potential biasing factor. For example,\ngender could be more highly correlated with the CES-D\nitem regarding \"crying spells\" than the latent depression\nvariable representing the CES-D. If this item bias is pres-\nent, then females would receive higher scores on the\nCES-D because they report crying more than men even\nwhen they are not depressed. The MIMIC model approach\nis equivalent to the Item Response Theory (IRT) approach\nto testing for item bias.\nPrior research suggests that depression rates among Mexi-\ncan Americans are higher than the general population (Mor-\nton et al., 1989), particularly for elders and women. It is\nimportant for research to determine how much of these\nincreased rates are due to biasing factors and how much\nreflect genuine differences in levels of depression for sub-\ngroups of Mexican Americans. For example, age may cause\nbias on depression inventories so that age-related differ-\nences in depression are exaggerated (Gallo, Anthony, and\nhave been reported for gender (Stommel et al., 1993).\nAnother recent issue has been the development of\nimproved factor analytic methods for handling ordinal and\nnon-normally distributed variables (Joreskog and Sorbom,\n1993). CES-D items tend to be highly skewed toward\nnon-depressed responses so the use of these new methods\nmay produce new findings. In addition, new guidelines\nhave been established for reporting and testing CFA find-\nings (Joreskog, 1993). These new methods have not been\napplied to research on the structure of the CES-D. There-\nfore, these techniques have the potential to reinterpret prior\nresearch and lead to a greater understanding of the nature\nand causes of inconsistent findings in research on the struc-\nture of the CES-D.\nThe Current Study\nWe investigate the dimensionality of the CES-D in the\nHispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies\n(H-EPESE) survey of elderly Mexican Americans living in\nthe Southwestern United States and in the oldest group of\nsubjects from a three-generations study of Mexican Ameri-\ncans (Markides et al., 1983). The H-EPESE was modeled\nafter the EPESE studies conducted in New Haven, East\nBoston, North Carolina, and rural Iowa (Cornoni-Huntley et\nMETHODS\nSampling Design\nThe H-EPESE sample was designed to represent the non-\ninstitutionalized southwestern Mexican American elderly\n(65 years old or over) population. Noninstitutionalized per-\nsons were defined as living in a dwelling with fewer than\nfive adults. A complete list of counties in Texas, California,\nArizona, Colorado, and New Mexico were ranked by per-\ncentage of elderly Mexican Americans according to 1990\nCensus Bureau estimates. Counties and census tracts within\ncounties were subsequently selected to yield a representa-\ntive sample of over 90 percent of Mexican American\nelderly persons in the Southwestern states. All small coun-\nties where the elderly Mexican Americans represented\n30 percent of the total population were included. Subjects\nwere selected using area probability sampling procedures\nthat involved selection of counties, census tracts, and\nhouseholds within selected census tracts. Interviewers\nscreened a total of 175 households within each sampling\nunit. One hundred households were screened during the\nfirst phase with the number of eligible respondents from\nthose initial 30,000 screened households determining the\nsize of phase two.\nPhase one interviewers began making contacts at the first\n100 housing units they had listed and only went beyond this\npoint as needed. The phase two interviewers began screen-\ning at the point where the first phase had been completed\nfor an additional 75 contacts. Up to four attempts were\nmade to screen each household with visits on different days\nof the week and at different times. Eligible subjects were\ninterviewed in their homes in their preferred language of\neither English or Spanish.\nThe response rate for the survey was 86 percent.

We report on the 2,536\nsubjects who completed all items on the CES-D scale. Ap-\nbeing born in Mexico. The average age was 73. Table 1\npresents the zero-order item correlation matrix of the\nCES-D. For all analyses including Table 1, the sample was\nweighted to take account of the unequal probabilities of\nselection.\nIn order to replicate our findings, we also used data from\nthe Three Generation Study of Mexican Americans (Krause\nand Markides, 1985). The dimensionality of the CES-D in\nthis sample was previously examined by Liang et al. (1989)\nand Krause and Markides (1985). Data for this study were\npling procedures. There were 375 subjects in each genera-\ntion. The older generation used for our analysis ranged in\nsubjects, 330 had complete CES-D data.\nMeasures\nDepressive symptomatology. -- Depression was assessed\nby the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depres-\nsion scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). Although not an indica-\ntor of clinical depression, the total score has been used as\nan indicator of degree of negative affect (Boyd et al., 1982).\nBackground variables. -- Depressive symptomatology is\nknown to be related to gender and age, so these variables\nwere included in the analysis. For the H-EPESE study, lan-\nguage of interview was used as another control variable\nthat may relate to the presentation of depression. Number\nof years of schooling was also included. The same variables\nwere used for the Three Generation Study with the excep-\ntion that language of interview was not a variable. For this\nstudy, bilingual interviewers were used, and each question-\nnaire was written in both languages. As a proxy for lan-\nguage of interview, a four-item language preference scale\nwas used. This scale is similar to scales used in previous\nresearch on Mexican Americans (Cuellar, Harris, and Jasso,\n1980). Higher scores indicate a greater preference for using\nSpanish.\nExploratory FactorAnalyses (EFAs)\nWe used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to suggest\nviable factor structures for the CES-D. Previous research\nhas identified several different factor structures, and the\nresults of at least one study of older Mexican Americans\nsuggests that a four-factor solution may have included too\nmany factors. One potential reason for reporting a solution\nwith too many factors is the reliance on the eigenvalue\ngreater than 1.0 rule that is the default option for many\ncomputer packages (Kim and Mueller, 1978). Therefore,\nwe compare results using other indicators of structure with\nthe results when just the eigenvalue greater than 1.0 rule is\nused. For these analyses, we used subgroups based on gen-\nder and language of interview. We did not subgroup by age\nor level of education because this would lead to sample size\nproblems for the subgroups and our initial analyses deter-\nmined that age and education were not associated with fac-\ntor structure or highly correlated with items on the CES-D.\nDue to these low correlations, education was dropped as a\nbackground variable.\nFor the EFAs, we used maximum likelihood estimation\nwith oblique (promax) rotation where the prior communality\n(i.e., the variance of the observed variable that is accounted\nfor by the latent variable) was set to be proportional to the\nsquared multiple correlations (SMCs) between the observed\nvariables and the latent variable with adjustment so that\ntheir sum is equal to the maximum absolute correlations.\nThis is the most conservative and accepted method for ob-\ntaining communality estimates (Lawley and Maxwell,\nsidered to load on a factor. We also examined correlations\nbetween items on all factors, which is a method that can be\nused to determine the appropriate number of factors (Kim\nConfirmatory Factor Analyses (CFAs)\nAdjusting for group differences. -- Two methods have\nbeen used within the CFA framework for modeling hetero-\ngeneity produced from different groups of individuals (e.g.,\nage, gender, and language of interview): (a) multiple groups\nanalyses and (b) multiple indicators, multiple causes\n(MIMIC) models (Muthen, 1989). Because multiple groups\nanalysis requires large numbers of people in all possible\ncross-classifications of the grouping variables, we decided to\nuse MIMIC models for testing the validity of our data across\nvarious subgroups such as age, gender, and language of inter-\nview. According to Muthen (1989), the advantages of the\nMIMIC model approach are that it provides testing of (a) the\nstrength of prediction of the background variables, (b)\ndimensionality, which was the purpose of the current study,\n(c) simultaneous effects of several background variables\n(e.g., gender, language of interview), and across-group het-\nerogeneity in measurement intercepts by allowing direct\neffects from observed exogenous variables to observed\nendogenous variables. The extent to which such direct effects\nare required can be tested by examining modification indices\nassociated with a baseline no-direct-effects model (Gallo,\nindices are chi-squared tests with one degree of freedom that\nestimate the improvement in fit in the overall model that\nwould occur if a single parameter (e.g., a direct effect) was\nfreed. A limitation of MIMIC models is the assumption of\na group-invariant covariance matrix, conditional upon the\nexogenous variables. This assumption is reasonable if the\nbackground variables do not interact to change the structure\nacross subgroups (e.g., younger males who were interviewed\nin Spanish have a different factor structure than older women\ninterviewed in English). We used LISREL VIII software\n(Joreskog and Sorbom, 1988) to produce weighted least\nsquares (WLS) estimates for all CFA models.\nTreatment of ordinal, nominal, and ratio scaled variables.\n-- For our CFAs of the ordinally scaled five-point CES-D\nitems, we initially hoped to use the generally recommended\nprocedure of polychoric correlations (Babakus, Ferguson,\nand Joreskog, 1987). Polychoric correlations are estimates\nof what the Pearson correlation would be for two ordinal\nvariables assuming an underlying bivariate normal distribu-\ntion. The assumption of bivariate normality can be tested\nfor a pair of items using Stieger's (1990) root mean square\nerror of approximation (RMSEA). Browne and Cudeck\n(1993) suggest that the assumption of bivariate normality is\ntenable when the RMSEA is not greater than .08, although\na close fit is only offered for RMSEAs that are less than\n.05. For the 190 correlations between items on the CES-D\nin our sample, less than 25 percent of the RMSEAs were\nfore, polychoric correlations were not used and instead, as\nrecommended by Joreskog and Sorbom (1993), observa-\ntions on ordinal variables were replaced by normal scores\ndetermined from the marginal distributions. The categorical\nvariables of gender and language of interview were treated\nas fixed effects. Age was considered to be a ratio level vari-\nable measured without error, so this variable was also\ntreated as a fixed effect as recommended by Joreskog and\nSorbom (1993). For the H-EPESE data, asymptotic covari-\nance matrices were used to adjust for multivariate non-nor-\nmality. An asymptotic covariance matrix could not be used\nfor the Three Generation Study data because many negative\nerror variances emerged. According to Bentler and Chou\n(1988), this negative variance problem is usually due to\ninsufficient sample size. They argue that the ratio of param-\neters to sample size should be at least 10 to 1 when using\nan asymptotic covariance matrix. The two-factor model for\nthe Three Generation Study requires the estimation of 52\nparameters so the minimum sample size should be 520. The\n520. Therefore, an asymptotic covariance matrix could not\nbe used for the Three Generation Study.\nModel comparisons and evaluation. -- We test several\nalternate CFA models including a four-factor model\nreported by Krause and Markides (1985), a four-factor\nmodel reported in several studies (Golding and Aneshensel,\nbased upon the results of our EFAs. The CFA models we\ntested were rejected by a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test\nat the p < .0001 level of significance. This finding is not\nsurprising because the chi-squared test is dependent on\nsample size and therefore, in large samples, models may\nbe rejected when they only depart trivially from the data\n(Joreskog and Sorbom, 1988). To assess the relative good-\nness-of-fit of our models, we employed several widely used\ngoodness-of-fit indexes including the Goodness-of-Fit\nIndex (GFI), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Adjusted\nGoodness-of-Fit Index (AGFI), and the Tucker Lewis Coef-\nficient (TLC). The GFI and CFI indices assess the relative\namount of the variances and covariances that are predicted\nby the model. The CFI also adjusts for bias due to asymp-\ntotic sample size. All of these indices usually have values\nbetween 1 and 0. Values greater than .90 indicate that the\nmodel fits the data reasonably well.\nAs suggested by Joreskog (1993), all items with squared\nmultiple correlations (SMCs) less than .40 were considered\nunreliable if modification indices did not suggest that the\nitem may be more highly correlated with another latent\nvariable. SMCs indicate the percentage of variance in the\nobserved variable that is explained by all the latent vari-\nables in the model and is a lower bound estimate of the reli-\nability of the observed variable (Joreskog and Sorbom,\nFor initial models, all off-diagonal theta deltas were as-\nsumed to be equal to 0. Theta deltas (6s) represent the corre-\nlation between error terms of observed variables. Modifica-\ntion indices may suggest that goodness-of-fit can be\nimproved by allowing theta deltas to be estimated. However,\nMacCallum (1986) has argued that simply freeing parame-\nters to improve goodness-of-fit can capitalize on idiosyn-\ncrasies in the data and may lead to results that cannot be\nreplicated. Therefore, we decided, somewhat conservatively,\nthat a theta delta would be estimated in new models if the\nmodification indices suggested the correlation was greater\nthan .15. Our conservative approach was based on our find-\ning that smaller values for theta deltas did not tend to repli-\ncate across random subsamples of our H-EPESE data. Simi-\nlarly, theta delta epsilon (8s*) correlations between the\nexogenous variables and the items on the CES-D were fixed\nto zero and were not freed unless modification indices sug-\ngested that the correlation would be greater than .15. As\nmentioned previously, correlations between exogenous vari-\nables and observed items are indicators of item bias.\nRESULTS\nExploratory Factor Analyses (EFAs)\nFor the H-EPESE study, EFAs were conducted on each\nof the subgroups identified by gender and language of inter-\nview. Using the eigenvalue greater than 1.0 method, two of\nthe four EFA models identified four factors, one EFA had a\nthree-factor solution, and a fourth model for females inter-\nviewed in English was an ultra heywood case -- the com-\nmunality estimate was greater than 1.0, making it impossi-\nble to determine a factor solution.\nTextbooks on factor analysis argue that in addition to\nusing the eigenvalue greater than 1.0 rule, other indicators\nof factor structure should be examined (e.g., examining\nitem loadings, scree plots, and percentage of variance\nexplained by each factor; Kim and Mueller, 1978). When\nmany items tend to load on more than one factor, this sug-\ngests that the solution has too many factors, and models\nwith fewer factors should be tried. For the two four-factor\nmodels and the three-factor model determined by the eigen-\nvalue greater than 1.0 rule, the items associated with\nsented one clearly distinguishable factor. No well-being\nitems loaded greater than .40 on any other factor. For other\nitems, the distinction between factors was less clear, sug-\ngesting that a solution incorporating fewer factors should\nbe tried. For Spanish-speaking males (N = 826), a four-fac-\ntor model emerged in which items 1, 2, and 11 clearly\nloaded on the first factor; items 3, 9, 10, and 13 loaded on\nloaded on the first, second, and fourth factors. Items 2 and 4\nonly loaded on the second factor, and items 5, 6, and 14\nloaded on the first and fourth factors. Given the large num-\nber of multiple loadings, these results suggest that a model\nwith fewer factors is appropriate.\nSimilar results occurred for the other subgroups. For\nEnglish-speaking males (N = 236), items 1 and 2 loaded\nloaded on factors 1 and 2. Items 6, 7, and 18 loaded on fac-\nand 4. For Spanish-speaking females (N = 1,162), a\nthree-factor solution emerged in which items 1 and 2 clearly\nand 2. In sum, these results suggest that most items tend to\nload on more than one factor, suggesting that the four-factor\nand three-factor models include too many factors.\nFor English-speaking females (N = 312), the four-factor\nmodel was an ultra-heywood case. Ultra-heywood cases\nemerge because too many factors have been specified (Kim\nand Mueller, 1978). Therefore, we tried a three-factor\nmodel and the solution converged. Factor 2 included items\nand 17) also loaded highly on factor 1. Factor 3 included\nfactor 1. Other items only loaded on factor 1. Therefore,\nthis three-factor model also has multiple loadings suggest-\ning that a reduced model should be tried. Other evidence\nthat reduced factor models should be tried came from scree\nplots in all four subsamples that suggested only two factors\nwere present.\nWhen two-factor models were estimated using EFA,\nitems only loaded on the second factor. There were no\ncases, for any of the subgroups, where one item loaded on\nmultiple factors. Therefore, our EFA results suggest that for\nall subgroups a two-factor model fits the data best. These\nresults also support the use of MIMIC models that require\nno interactions between grouping factors. That is, there are\nno interactions between the grouping factors because all\nsubgroups suggest the same two-factor model.\nAn EFA of the Three Generation Study also suggested a\ntwo-factor solution for similar reasons as were found in the\nH-EPESE data; for solutions with more factors, items\ntended to load on more than one factor, and the scree plot\nindicated a two-factor solution. Subgroup analyses were not\nperformed due to limitations imposed by sample size.\nCFA for four-factor models. -- Despite the finding that a\ntwo-factor model fit the data best, we decided to examine\nboth two- and four-factor models using CFA. Because a\nfour-factor CFA model for the Three Generation Study has\nalready been reported, we do not report these results. We\nreport the results of four-factor models for the H-EPESE\nstudy that are representative of four-factor models found in\nprevious research. Table 2 presents the results for the\nfour-factor model proposed by Krause and Markides (1985)\nbased on the Three Generation data and the four-factor\nmodel proposed by Radloff (1977), which has been repli-\ncated in some studies (e.g., Hertzog et al., 1990).

For the H-EPESE study, only item 11\nhad a low SMC (.32). For the Three Generation Study,\nvious CFA analysis of the Three Generation Study also\nfound that these same items had weak loadings (Liang et\nal., 1989). In general, SMCs for the Three Generation\nStudy are similar to the H-EPESE study except that items\npotential explanation for the low reliability is the lower\nlevel of education of the participants in the Three Genera-\ntion Study as compared with the EPESE study. However,\nwhen number of years of schooling was added as a back-\nground variable it was riot significantly correlated with\ndepression or well-being. Furthermore, a multiple groups\nanalysis with a median split of high versus low education as\nthe grouping factor found that subjects with less education\ndid not have lower SMCs.\nLiang et al. (1989) did riot report the latent variable corre-\nlation between their well-being and depression factors. For\nthe Three Generation Study sample, the latent variable corre-\nlation (r = -.35) was lower than the correlation found in the\nH-EPESE study (r = -.64); perhaps because some items\nappear to be more unreliable in the Three Generation Study.\nOther correlations between well-being and gender, and\nwell-being and language were also smaller in the Three Gen-\neration Study. However, the language Scaie was more highly\ncorrelated with gender and age for the Three Generation\nStudy than language of interview was for the H-EPESE\nstudy. All correlations between exogenous variables and the\ndepression and well-being latent variables were generally low\n(see Table 3). We fixed to 0.0 standardized regressions\nbetween exogenous and endogenous variables that were esti-\nmated to be less than .05. In many cases, age was not corre-\nlated with well-being or depression, so this element was fixed\nto 0.0. These fixed elements appear as blanks in Table 3.\nIt is possible that the smaller correlation between well-\nbeing and depression in the Three Generation Study may\nhave been produced by the use of MIMIC models. How-\never, when we conducted a CFA without any exogenous\nvariables, the magnitude of the correlation between depres-\nsion and well-being only dropped from -.36 to -.35. For\nthe H-EPESE study, this correlation increased from -.64 to\n-.65. For the Three Generation Study analysis, without\nexogenous variables, the SMCs varied but generally stayed\nthe same: 11 items had the same value, 5 improved, and 4\ndecreased in value. For the H-EPESE, SMCs slightly\nimproved -- 14 improved, 4 had the same value, and 3\ndecreased in value. For the Three Generation Study, good-\nness-of-fit slightly improved for all indices (GFI = .81; CFI\nness-of-fit was slightly improved for the two indices and\ndecreased for two indices (GFI = .82; CFI = .97; AGFI =\nFor the H-EPESE study, four modifications indices were\nsubstantial enough to warrant inclusion in the final model.\nThree theta delta error terms between items on the CES-D\nwere statistically significant. Theta deltas between items 1\ntions of .18, .15, and .15, respectively. A theta delta epsilon\nbetween gender and item 17 (\"I had crying spells.\") had a\nstandardized regression coefficient of .15, suggesting that\n\u00b7women were more likely to report this item as being posi-\ntive regardless of whether or not they were depressed.\nFor the Three Generation Study, the theta delta epsilon\nbetween item 7 (I felt everything I did was an effort) and\nthe language scale was significant (r = .28) as was the cor-\nrelation between gender and item 4 (I felt I was just as good\nas other people; r = .20). Theta deltas were significant for\n.28). The only parameters that were significant across both\nstudies were the theta deltas for items 15 (\"People were\nunfriendly.\") and 19 (\"I felt people disliked me.\"), and\nitems 17 (\"I had crying spells.\") and 18 (\"I felt sad.\").\nFor the H-EPESE data, all goodness-of-fit indices were\nslightly improved over the results for the Krause and\nMarkides (1985) four-factor model and were all fairly high.\nModel fit should not improve if unnecessary factors are\nadded, so these results suggest that the more parsimonious\ntwo-factor model is the best fit. Liang et al. (1989) also\nreported their results for a subset of items from the CES-D\nthat loaded highly on at least one factor. When we\nattempted a two-factor model on this subset of items, we\nfound that the goodness-of-fit indices were similar to their\nreported three-factor solution (two-factor model: GFI = .93;\nTable 3.

Examining the SMCs for the Three Generation Study,\nit appears that these lower indices are the result of several\nunreliable items. Another possibility is that the lack of use\nof an asymptotic covariance matrix reduced the goodness-\nof-fit. When goodness-of-fit was examined without the use\nof an asymptotic covariance matrix with the H-EPESE\ndata, goodness-of-fit decreased substantially (GFI = .86;\nmates are still higher than those found in the Three Genera-\ntion Study, so the lack of use of an asymptotic covariance\nmatrix does not appear to account for the lower goodness-\nof-fit in the Three Generation Study.\nThe SMCs for the H-EPESE were not greatly influenced\nby the use of the asymptotic covariance matrix. Therefore,\nthe greater unreliability associated with not using an asymp-\ntotic covariance matrix does not account for the many un-\nreliable (low SMC) items found in the Three Generation\ndata. Another possible explanation for the lower reliability\nis the use of normalized scores. However, the SMCs and\ngoodness-of-fit were not substantially different when the\nnormalized scores for the CES-D items were not used for\nboth data sets. Therefore, it appears that some items on the\nCES-D were reported more unreliably in the Three Genera-\ntion Study.\nDISCUSSION\nThe current study conducted a series of EFAs and CFAs\nin an attempt to define the dimensionality of the CES-D in\na representative sample of elderly Mexican Americans liv-\ning in the Southwestern United States (H-EPESE) and\namong the Mexican American elderly from an earlier Three\nGeneration Study (Markides et al., 1983). In both studies,\nour EFAs found support for a two-factor structure of\ndepression and well-being. Our EFAs also found that item\nloadings from the four-factor models did not replicate\nacross gender and language of interview. Many statistical\nindicators suggested that less than four factors represent the\nbest structure for the CES-D among elderly Mexican Amer-\nicans. The two-factor models replicated across both gender\nand language of interview. Another argument in support of\nthe two-factor model is that statisticians recommend that if\ngoodness-of-fit is equal, the more parsimonious model is\nmost appropriate (Kim and Mueller, 1978). Our CFAs\nshowed that goodness-of-fit did not improve by allowing\nmore than two factors.\nThere are several possible interpretations of our results.\nOur results may be viewed as supporting the argument that\nin more traditional societies, such as elderly Mexican\nAmericans, depression may be viewed as a single construct\n1977) and there is not the typical separation of cognitive,\naffective, and behavioral components identified in Cauca-\nsion populations. Instead of these components, research\nsuggests that Hispanic beliefs about family, personal rela-\ntionships, the effects of forces of good and evil on health\nand well-being, and a present-oriented approach to problem\nsolving may have more relevance to Hispanic populations\nA two-dimensional structure is also consistent with previ-\nous theory (Watson and Clark, 1984) and other depression\ninventories (Aneshensel, Clark, and Fredrichs, 1983; Catan-\nPace, and Parchman, 1993). In support of the two-dimen-\nsional hypothesis, prior research on the CES-D has also\nfound a second-order structure with two factors (McCallum\nthat uses the same methodology employed in the current\nstudy in order to determine whether the differences in our\nstudy are due to our CFA methodology or to differences in\nthe culture of our subjects.\nFor the H-EPESE study, the language in which the inter-\nview was conducted was correlated with both depression\nand well-being; those who preferred the interview in Span-\nish were more likely to be depressed and to report lower\nwell-being; r = .18). It has been suggested that the greater\nlevels of depression reported among elderly Mexican\nAmericans and Mexican American women may possibly be\ndue to their lower levels of acculturation into the larger\nsociety (Golding and Aneshensel, 1989; Guarnacci, Angel,\nand Worobey, 1989). Language of interview may be con-\nsidered a proxy for acculturation, and the Three Generation\nStudy analysis included a language acculturation scale that\ncorrelated similarly with depression (r = .22).\nCorrelations between the background variables varied\nsomewhat across studies. Gender was more highly corre-\nlated with depression in the Three Generation Study (r =\n.31) than the H-EPESE study (r = .10). Well-being was\nnegatively correlated with language of interview (r = -.22)\nand nonsignificantly correlated with acculturation in the\nThree Generation Study. The Three Generation Study\nacculturation scale was more highly associated with gender\n(r = .15) than the EPESE language of interview scale (r =\n.01). Age was not highly correlated with either depression\nor well-being. However, our sample only included subjects\nover the age of 65. Associations between age and depres-\nsion occur in samples that employ wider age ranges (Gatz\nMethodological Issues\nOne potential explanation for why researchers may have\nreported four-factor solutions is that they used the eigen-\nvalue greater than 1.0 rule. In our study, this rule yielded\nsolutions with too many factors. This finding also may\nexplain why four-factor solutions for the CES-D reported in\nprior research have reported that some items load on more\nIn contrast to the H-EPESE study, some items for the\nThree Generation Study sample were unreliable and were\nfound to not load on any factor. The unreliability problem\nhas occurred in many other studies [see Liang et al. (1989)\nfor a review]. The reason for the unreliability problem is\nunknown. We found that differences in educational levels\nacross the two studies did not account for the unreliability.\nTherefore, we cannot explain why some items had higher\nreliabilities in the H-EPESE study.\nOur results suggest that due to the skewed ordinal nature\nof the CES-D items, the use of an asymptotic covariance\nmatrix will improve goodness-of-fit somewhat. We could\nnot use this procedure on the Three Generation Study sam-\nple because the suggested sample size for the use of an\nasymptotic covariance matrix for the CES-D items is at\nleast 520 subjects. Therefore, future researchers interested\nin conducting CFAs of the CES-D should include at least\n520 subjects in their samples.\nFor the H-EPESE, we found item bias on only one item\n(\"Do you have crying spells?\"). Given the tendency for men\nnot to cry, it is not surprising that some gender bias occurs\non this item. We found no bias for age or language of inter-\nview. For the Three Generation Study, several different\nitems had bias. Since we were unable to replicate these item\nbias findings across studies and MacCallum (1986) has\nargued that such specification searches can yield unreplica-\nble results, our findings of bias should be treated with cau-\ntion until a consistent picture emerges from future research.\nThe theta delta parameters that are indicative of corre-\nlated error terms were only significant across both studies\nfor two sets of items: one pair of items concerned with rela-\ntionships with other people -- \"People were unfriendly,\"\nand \"I felt people disliked me\" and a second pair -- \"I had\ncrying spells,\" and \"I felt sad.\" A correlation between theta\ndeltas suggests that some of the correlation between these\nitems is not related to level of depression. Therefore, our\nresults suggest that scores on these items have some bias\nbecause they do not entirely reflect depression but are also\ninfluenced by other similarities between these pairs of items\n(e.g., relationship stress).\nThe two-factor structure we report should not be assumed\nto fit other nonelderly Mexican American populations. For\nexample, Hertzog (1989), using the same EFA methods as\nused in this study, reported the results of two studies: one\nsample of subjects aged 20 to 80 from a family practice\nclinic (N = 437) and a second sample of volunteers aged 55\nto 77 (N = 237). For the four-factor solution, four items had\nloadings greater than .40 on the affect factor, four items\nloaded on a well-being factor, seven items loaded on the\nsomatic factor, and two items loaded on the interpersonal\nfactor. For the second sample, the same four items loaded on\naffect and the same three loaded on well-being, eight loaded\non the somatic factor including the same six that loaded on\nthe first data set, and the same two items loaded on the inter-\npersonal factor. Unlike our study, there were no variables that\nloaded more than .40 on two or more factors. In addition,\nHertzog reported lower intercorrelations between the four\nfactors. Therefore, his results suggest that a four-factor\nmodel fits his data. Nevertheless, Hertzog concludes:\nA decision to use the four scales must face two issues: 1) the\nscales will be highly intercorrelated and 2) two of the four\nscales are based upon an unacceptably low number of items,\nminimizing scale reliability (p. 290).\nIt may be argued that four-factor scales may still be use-\nful if they show divergent validity with other constructs.\nMost prior research on Mexican Americans has found that\nthe strongest case for divergent validity occurs with the\nwell-being scale (Krause and Markides, 1985). However,\ndifferent patterns may emerge in other populations.\nThe new methods used in the present study were not avail-\nable for most previous studies. Future researchers will have\nto investigate whether the use of these new methods might\nyield two-factor solutions in other samples. Nevertheless, our\ncomparative results suggest that differences in methods of\nanalysis had little to do with our findings. Although both of\nour studies interviewed elderly Mexican Americans, there\nwere differences in the unreliability of some items. Further-\nmore, there were differences in the strength of correlation\nbetween the factors and background variables that suggest\nthat the two samples are not equivalent. Future research will\nhave to determine what produces these differences that have\nalso been reported in other studies (see Liang et al., 1989).\nOur study suggests the need to fully explore alternate\nstructures for the CES-D in different populations and to\nevaluate the adequacy of different structures using multiple\ncriteria (e.g., scree plots and examining item loadings). The\nresults of the current study suggest that a two-factor model\nof well-being and general depression is the best structure\nfor the CES-D among elderly Mexican Americans.\n"
