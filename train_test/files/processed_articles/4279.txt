Most societies have com-\nplex educational systems that have often changed over time.\nTherefore, the seemingly prosaic activity of measuring an\nindividual's education within a social survey is far from\nstraightforward, and analysts of social survey data should be\nmindful of the challenges and potential pitfalls associated with\nusing education variables in statistical analyses.\nThere are a number of high-quality social surveys which\nare specifically designed to collect detailed and comprehen-\nsive educational information.1 Most of the more general and\nmultipurpose social surveys (e.g. large-scale cross-sectional\nsurveys and household panel surveys) also collect informa-\ntion on a respondent's educational background but usually in\nless detail. Because there is no simple measure of education\nthat is universally agreed upon, the information collected in\nsocial surveys can take numerous forms. For example, details\non the respondent's experiences in compulsory education,\ntheir school grades, how much formal education they have\ncompleted, the title or nature of their qualifications and the\ntypes of institution that they attended post-school, are all\noften collected in multipurpose social surveys, but there are\nvariations from survey to survey in the range of measures\ncollected. Social survey data collectors also usually construct\none or more `derived' education variables.

An aim of this article is to\nincrease awareness of the issues associated with measuring\neducation in context and to provide guidance for researchers\nwho are not experts in this field.\nWe commence with an outline of important context which\nimpinges upon the measurement of education. The United\nKingdom is the focus of this article, but similar issues apply\nto many other nation states. We outline the main approaches\nto handling educational information in social survey data.\nThis article is not orientated towards a theoretical evaluation\nof education measures nor does the article document the his-\ntory or development of education measures. It is our inten-\ntion that this article will serve as a useful reference for\nresearchers seeking guidance on summarising educational\nattainment information effectively when analysing social\nsurveys. We conclude by making a series of practical recom-\nmendations for researchers engaged in secondary social sur-\nvey data analysis.\nEducation in context\nGeneral social surveys usually collect data on a large sample\nof respondents which reflect the wider structure of a popula-\ntion (e.g. the nation). Therefore, samples will routinely\ninclude respondents of different ages and at different stages of\nthe life course. There have been radical changes in the educa-\ntion systems in most nations within living memories, and\nolder cohorts of respondents in surveys will tend to have been\neducated in different circumstances to younger cohorts. For\nease, we will refer to different groups as `educational cohorts'.\nBelow, we elaborate upon a number of changes to educational\nsystems and opportunities that have influenced `educational\ncohorts'in the United Kingdom and stress that there are com-\nparable stories of substantial educational change, albeit with\ndifferent specific details, in other countries.\nThe difference between `educational cohorts' is easily\nillustrated using a British example. The British Household\nPanel Survey (BHPS) is a multipurpose household panel sur-\nals (Berthoud and Gershuny, 2000; Institute for Social and\nEconomic Research, 2010). In the first wave of the survey\nold BHPS respondents attended school before the First World\nWar, about a quarter attended school in the inter-war years,\nand the bulk of respondents attended school after the Second\nWorld War. The respondents also had varying access to edu-\ncational opportunities beyond compulsory schooling. Those\nborn before 1945 had very limited opportunities to gain post-\nschool qualifications. Those born from 1945 benefitted from\nhigher education expansion, and those born after 1965 ben-\nefitted from greater expansion in both further and higher\neducation. Each of these educational cohorts were educated\nunder different conditions, the structure and organisation of\neducational institutions differed, and the educational oppor-\ntunities available to pupils were markedly different.\nMinimum school leaving age2\nThe `raising of the school leaving age' (ROSLA) is a term\nused in the United Kingdom to describe an act brought into\nforce when the legal age that a young person is allowed to\nleave compulsory education increases (Ainley, 1988;\nTrowler, 2003). In the United Kingdom, the compulsory\nschool leaving age was increased from 14 to 15\nyears in\nschool leaving age has been further extended.3 Many\nresearchers include a measure of years of full-time education\ncompleted within their analyses (Eikemo et al., 2008;\nKunovich and Slomczynski, 2007). In some research appli-\ncations using a duration measure is a straightforward and\nfunctional strategy. The organisational changes to the length\nof compulsory education in Britain might be consequential\nbut would be hidden in an analysis that included adults of\nvery different ages (and therefore from different educational\ncohorts). A na\u00efve analysis of all adults in the BHPS might\noverlook this important contextual detail. In such circum-\nstances, it might prove beneficial to include an explicit indi-\ncator for educational cohort within the analysis.\nChanging school structures\nOver the course of the 20th century different educational\ncohorts in the United Kingdom have passed through very dif-\nferent school and post-school systems. The 1944 Education\nAct sought to provide compulsory secondary education for all,\nfree of charge through a school system that was highly selec-\ntive (Blackburn and Jarman, 1992). On the basis of an ability\ntest taken at the age of 11years (the 11-plus exam), most chil-\ndren were allocated to one constituent of a tripartite system of\nexamination were generally allocated places at grammar\nschools, whereas pupils who failed the 11-plus were generally\nallocated places at secondary modern schools. In some regions,\neducation was also provided at technical schools. Grammar\nschools provided traditional academic education leading to\nformal qualifications and the possibility of entering higher\nConnelly et al. 3\neducation, while a more vocationally orientated curriculum\nwas delivered in secondary modern and technical schools.\nThe United Kingdom has since moved away from the tri-\npartite school system. The `11-plus' was abolished in most\nregions by the early 1970s, and comprehensive schools (i.e.\nschools which do not select their intake on the basis of aca-\ndemic achievement or perceived ability) became the most\ncommon types of school, although a small number of areas\nof England still maintain selective grammar schools (Bolton,\nschool structures over time, an analysis that uses an educa-\ntional measure such as the type of secondary school attended\nhas the potential to be misleading when respondents from\ndifferent educational cohorts are included within the same\nanalytical sample.\nChanging school-age qualifications\nNations like the United Kingdom have education systems\nwith a wide range of qualifications. In addition to the school\nleaving age increasing and school systems being reorgan-\nised, there have also been dramatic changes in school-level\nhighlight that in the period since the end of the Second World\nWar new qualifications have emerged and later disappeared.\nIn England, Wales and Northern Ireland the General\nCertificate of Education Ordinary Level (O' Level) was\nintroduced in the 1950s and was the normal examination, at\nthe end of compulsory education, for pupils attending gram-\nmar Schools. The Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE)\nwas introduced in the 1960s and was designed for pupils per-\nforming at a lower level, but its highest grade was considered\nto be equivalent to a low grade O' Level. These qualifica-\ntions were replaced by the General Certificate of Secondary\nEducation (GCSE) in the late 1980s (Department of\nThe Scottish education system has always had a different\nset of school-age qualifications. The Ordinary Grade of the\nScottish Certificate of Education (commonly known as\nO-Grades) was usually taken at the ages of 15 or 16\nyears\nuntil the late 1980s when they were replaced by Standard\nGrades. A new system of National grades was introduced in\nThe UK school education system has generally been organ-\nised into a two tier qualification structure which comprises a\nlower tier of examinations that are undertaken at the end of\ncompulsory school and a higher tier of more advanced qualifi-\ncations which are undertaken usually in the years that immedi-\nately follow post-compulsory school. The more advanced\nschool-level qualifications (which are usually targeted towards\nentry into higher education) have remained relatively more sta-\nble. The General Certificate of Education Advanced Level (A'\nLevel), usually requiring 2\nyears of study, has been under-\ntaken by pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since\nthe early 1950s. Pupils usually undertake three subject-specific\nA'Levels. These qualifications are the standard requirement for\nuniversity entry and a prerequisite for some jobs. Other qualifi-\ncations such as the more advanced Scholarship Level and\nSpecial Papers existed for pupils in the post-compulsory school\nstage during various periods but were abolished sometime ago.\nAt other times a range of intermediate qualifications such as the\nAdvanced Supplementary Level (AS) and the more recent\nAdvanced Subsidiary (AS) Level have been available to pupils\n(the similarity of the titles and abbreviations of these qualifica-\ntions often causes confusion). Recently advanced qualifications\nsuch as the International Baccalaureate and Pre U are beginning\nto be offered by some schools as alternatives to A' Levels.\nScotland has also experienced substantial variations in advanced\nschool-level qualifications in recent decades (see Paterson,\n2003). These changes are summarised succinctly in a timeline\nproduced by the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework.4\nThe chequered history of both lower and higher tier school\nqualifications, means that care is required when undertaking\nsecondary analyses of school-level qualification measures. If\nthe survey dataset contains respondents who gained school-\nlevel qualifications in different time periods, this issue is\nespecially acute. Even within the same educational cohort\npupils could have gained a mixture of qualifications. For\nexample, during the early 1980s comprehensive school\npupils in England and Wales frequently undertook a mixture\nof O' Levels and CSEs at the age of 16years and might have\nundertook a mixture of O' Levels and A' Levels in the fol-\nlowing school years. Similarly, in Scotland during the last\ndecade it was not uncommon for pupils to study a mixture of\nAdvanced Highers, Highers and Intermediates in the last\nstages of school.\nIn the United Kingdom pupils undertake a portfolio of\nschool qualifications across a range a subjects. In England,\nWales and Northern Ireland pupils study for many GCSEs\nand the award is for the individual subject (e.g. Maths,\nEnglish, History, etc.).5 Pupils choose their subjects based on\nthe prescriptions of their teachers and schools and also to\nsome extent based on personal and parental choice. This\nmeans that pupils will have studied a reasonably individual-\nised personal portfolio of GCSEs. Therefore, school GCSE\nattainment cannot be easily summarised by an obvious single\nmeasure.\nIn some specialist surveys (e.g. the Youth Cohort Study of\nEngland and Wales) data on individual qualifications and\ngrades awarded in individual subjects are collected. Each\nindividual GCSE is awarded a separate grade from A* (the\nhighest) to G (the lowest grade of pass). The grade is alpha-\nbetical rather than numerical, therefore there is no single\nclear indicator of an individuals' overall level of school\nattainment. Gaining five or more GCSEs at grades A*\u00adC is a\nstandard benchmark and it is used in official reporting (see\nLeckie and Goldstein, 2009). This benchmark is routinely\nemployed in a wide variety of social science applications\n2011). A limitation of this measure is that it treats an A* in\n4 Methodological Innovations\nhistory, a C in maths and a B in geography equally in deter-\nmining whether or not a pupil has five GCSEs at grades\nA*\u00adC (Gorard and Taylor, 2002). In more recent years, the\nUK Government has produced league tables which have also\nincluded a measure of the proportion of pupils in a school\ngaining five or more GCSEs at grades A*\u00adC including maths\nand English (Taylor, 2011). The addition of achieving grades\nA*\u00adC in maths and English does not, however, overcome the\nmore general obstacle of how best to suitably combine alpha-\nbetical grades from a portfolio of different GCSE results.\nA plausible alternative strategy for measuring GCSE attain-\nment is to construct measures based on scores. There are many\npossible scores that could be assigned to the alphabetical grades\nascribed to the levels of GCSE attainment. In line with a\nQualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) scoring\nGCSE attainment by allocating 7 points for an A*/A, 6 points\nfor a B, 5 points for a C, 4 points for a D, 3 points for an E, 2\npoints for an F and 1 point for a G, and therefore producing an\noverall score for each pupil's attainment. More recently, a new\nset of scores has been proposed,6 although we note that the\nscores for each alphabetical GCSE grade are similarly spaced\nin both schemes and are therefore unlikely to dramatically alter\nobserved patterns of attainment. Haque and Bell (2001) con-\nverted GCSE attainment into numerical scores and then used\nthese scores to calculate a mean score for each pupil. Their\nmethod has the potential advantage of taking into account vari-\nations in the number of GCSEs which pupils have undertaken,\nwhich is often a result of school policies. An innovative\napproach has recently been developed by Playford and Gayle\n(2016) who have studied subject-specific GCSE attainment\nusing latent class analysis and have identified distinct groups of\npupils based on their attainment across a number of subjects.\nWe hope that the information presented in the passages\nabove indicates that there are alternative approaches to using\ndetailed survey data on school-level qualifications. Some\napproaches will be better suited to specific analyses. Our\nempirical research leads us to conclude that representing\nschool-level attainment information in as much resolution as\npossible and avoiding the simple categorisation of results is\na favourable analytical approach when the data have suffi-\nadvise that it is good practice to avoid constructing arbitrary\nor ad hoc measures of school-level attainment from existing\nsocial survey data. We suggest that it is preferable, wherever\npossible, for data analysts to stick with established measures\n(e.g. the QCA scoring methods) as these are transparent,\ndocumented, used by other researchers and are replicable.\nPost-school educational institutions and\neducational expansion\nIn Britain the number of pupils staying on in education past\nthe compulsory school leaving age increased dramatically\nthrough the second half of the 20th century, from around\nexpansion was associated with growth in both further educa-\ntion and higher education (involving University courses).\nThe expansion in participation in higher education was une-\nven, with general patterns of increase punctuated by two\nperiods of accelerated expansion. The first period was\nthe scale of expansion, official statistics report that there\nin British higher education, for example by the mid-1990s\nwere participating in higher education, but this increased to\nCouncil for England (HEFCE), 2010). The expansion of par-\nticipation in British higher education can be illustrated using\nsocial survey data. Using data from the General Household\nSurvey,7 Figure 1 depicts the variation by age in the probabil-\nity of a respondent having a degree which is the result of the\nexpansion in higher education.\nPost-school educational expansion has led to dramatic\nincreases in the average levels of educational attainment of\ndifferent educational cohorts (Glennerster, 2001; Greenaway\nand Haynes, 2003). It is argued that educational expansion\nhas also led to changes in the relative social value which can\nbe attributed to educational qualifications, a process some-\ntimes known as `credential inflation' (see Blackburn and\ntial inflation thesis predicts that as the supply of highly edu-\ncated labour increases, the value of specific educational\nqualifications decrease within the labour market (Van de\nWerfhorst and Andersen, 2005). Similarly, the social mean-\ning of an educational qualification such as a university\nFigure 1. Higher education expansion \u00ad attainment of a\nUniversity Degree by age.\nConnelly et al. 5\ndegree will change over time; this is particularly evident in\nthe United Kingdom, which has moved from an elite to a\nmass system of higher education. These dramatic transfor-\nmations in post-school education have substantial implica-\ntions for survey data collected from respondents from\ndifferent educational cohorts, and secondary data analysts\nshould, therefore, exercise suitable caution.\nApproaches to measuring education in\nsocial surveys\nDespite the key importance of education in sociological\nresearch, the practical process of constructing measures from\nsocial survey data is often handled rather cursorily. At least\nthree broad categories of approach are commonly used to\nmeasure education in survey research. First, measures of the\ntime spent in education (i.e. years of education). Second, tax-\nonomies of the highest educational qualifications held\n(Schneider, 2010). Third, scaling techniques which attribute\nscores to the highest educational qualifications held (Buis,\n2010). We critically evaluate each of these three approaches\nin this section.\nYears of education\nMany social surveys include a measure of years of full-\ntime education completed (Schneider, 2011). This meas-\nure is routinely included in analyses (see Eikemo et al.,\nmeasures of education these are particularly attractive\nwithin statistical modelling approaches as they can be\nadded to regression models as continuous covariates (see\nparticularly popular in economics where an attempt to\nrepresent educational assets gradationally often fits\nneatly with theories or analyses of incremental returns to\nhuman capital (see Harmon et al., 2003). It is common-\nplace for economists to convert categorical data on a\nrespondent's highest qualification into a measure of time\nspent in education, on the basis of external information\nabout the average time in education for each qualification\nA potential limitation of using measures of years in full-\ntime education is that it may not necessarily work well as a\nproxy for educational attainment. In Britain, for example,\nqualifications with very different levels often require a simi-\nlar amount of time in education due to the structure and\norganisation of the educational year. This can be a significant\nshortcoming for using years of education as a measure, as it\nrisks conflating different qualifications that may provide dif-\nferent competencies and have a different value in the labour\nmarket (see Dearden et al., 2002). Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik and\nWarner (2013) warn that in practice, measures of years of\neducation are only weakly associated with measures of edu-\ncational qualifications (p. 106).\nQualification-based categorizations\nQualification-based measures provide more detailed infor-\nmation about formal educational experiences, the courses\nand subjects studied, and the vocational or academic nature\nof the education undertaken. It is often assumed that as a\nresult qualification based measures provide additional infor-\nmation on the education which an individual has attained.\nFor example, the signals which the qualifications held might\nsend to potential employers. Frequently, social surveys ask\nindividuals to describe the highest qualification that they\nhold (either by providing a textual description of the qualifi-\ncation or by choosing one option from a selection of catego-\nries). In addition, some surveys include extensive questioning\nin order to enumerate all of the respondent's formal qualifi-\ncations and the grades attained for their qualification(s)\nnumber of qualifications available in countries like the\nUnited Kingdom, it is generally necessary for researchers to\nreduce this information into an education measure with a\nmuch smaller number of categories (see Schneider, 2011).\nSurvey data analysts generally focus upon the highest quali-\nfication which a respondent holds when analysing adult\nsamples.\nA common approach to educational measurement is to\nmake use of the `derived' measures deposited with social\nsurvey datasets. These summary measures of qualification\ncategories are prepared by the data depositors (Schneider,\n2011). Unfortunately, there are substantial variations from\nsurvey to survey in the content, format and quality of the\nderived educational measures. For example, the BHPS gen-\nerated a 12 category typology of highest educational qualifi-\ncation.8 This measure is not the same as the highest\neducational qualification measure deposited with either the\nLabour Force Survey9 or the General Household Survey.10\nTherefore, consideration is still required when using a\nderived educational measure that has been deposited with a\nlarge-scale dataset because the measure might not be readily\ncomparable across surveys.\nIn order to promote a standardised measurement instru-\nment for education, the ONS has suggested a taxonomy of\nqualifications with three categories (degree level and above,\nobvious point that such a simple classification does not rep-\nresent the full variety of educational qualifications and levels\nof attainment in education within the United Kingdom. We\nare convinced that the diverse range of qualifications placed\nwithin the same category of this crude measure will lead to a\nlarge degree of unhelpful within-category variation.\nTherefore, the ONS educational measure is likely to be sub-\noptimal for almost all empirical social science analyses.\nThe National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) levels pro-\nvide another approach to categorising UK qualifications.\nDue to concerns over the complexity of vocational qualifica-\ntions in the late 1980s, the National Council for Vocational\n6 Methodological Innovations\nQualifications developed a new framework of vocational\nqualifications called NVQs (Jenkins and Sabates, 2007).\nAlthough the original NVQ qualifications have been\nreplaced, researchers such as Dearden et al. (2002) have\nfound the NVQ levels useful for classifying both vocational\nand academic qualifications into a convenient scheme for\nempirical research. Examples of qualifications and their\nNVQ levels are shown in Table 1.\nThere are other well-known recommendations for catego-\nrising educational qualifications, which are available. Two\nprominent examples are the `Comparative Analysis of Social\nMobility in Industrial Nations' (CASMIN) classification of\neducation (Brauns et al., 2003) and the `International\nStandard Classification of Education' (ISCED; UNESCO,\ncal levels and differentiates between academic and voca-\ntional qualifications. By contrast, ISCED contains seven\nlevels, with further sub-categories within each level, but also\nincorporates academic and vocational skills (see Table 3).\nCASMIN and ISCED are specifically designed to permit\ncross-national comparisons and have been successfully used\nin large-scale comparative projects (e.g. Blossfeld and\nUnited Kingdom the BHPS has deposited CASMIN and\nISCED along with other educational measures, an example\nof good practice that other large-scale social surveys could\nalso usefully adopt.\nCASMIN and ISCED measures could also be deployed in\nnational level analyses, although at the current time this\napproach is not widely used. Using these measures might\nhelp to overcome the general problem of different measures\nbeing deposited with different large-scale surveys. For\nwithin-country analyses there may also be benefits to devel-\noping similar theoretically informed but nationally specific,\nstandardised educational categorizations. Although the\nmethodologies behind such new measures must be\ntheoretically informed and well thought through, they must\nbe appropriately documented and must not be developed on\nan ad hoc basis.\nDespite their ubiquity in large-scale surveys there are\nlimitations to undertaking analyses using categorical educa-\ntional qualification measures. Many qualification measures\nhave large numbers of categories which can be cumbersome\nto work with. Educational measures with many levels rou-\ntinely have some sparse categories, even when sample sizes\nare relatively large. In practice, researchers will often want to\nmake comparisons between respondents with different edu-\ncation levels, which are more difficult with measures with a\nlarge number of categories. In our experience interpreting\nthe influence of an interaction between a categorical educa-\ntional measure and another explanatory variable can be tax-\ning especially when both measures have a large number of\ncategories. The use of scales is an obvious strategy for\naddressing this problem,11 this is the focus of the next\nsection.\nScaling education measures\nAnother approach to the analysis of educational qualifica-\ntions involves developing scales based upon some relevant\ncriteria. For example a qualification might be ranked by the\naverage income of workers with that certain level of educa-\nwhich is sometimes called `effect proportional scaling'. Buis\n(2010) has demonstrated a variety of methods for producing\nscales of education, based upon the association between edu-\ncational qualifications and other outcomes, for example\nincome and occupational positions. Buis (2010) and Lambert\n(2012) advocate scoring educational qualifications because a\nlarge number can be attributed to a single scale. In a statisti-\ncal modelling framework scoring offers a parsimonious way\nof summarising detailed educational data. In our experience\nTable 1.

Despite these attrac-\ntive properties a cursory review of existing studies leads us\nto conclude that approaches which scale education are not\npopular in secondary social survey data analyses within con-\ndemonstrates in some empirical inquiries scales may be\nbeneficial.\nScaling approaches are not without limitations, Chauvel\n(2002) for instance argues that the nature of educational\nattainment is too complex, heterogeneous and multi-dimen-\nsional to be represented on a unidimensional scale. He con-\ncludes that scaling educational attainment may therefore\nhide complex qualitative differences between individuals.\nWe recognise that this is a justifiable methodological point.\nexploratory analyses that persuade us that in practice, for\nmany research purposes, this is not a serious limitation to\nusing a scaling approach.\nTable 2.

Scaling approaches have the attraction of allowing\nthe adjustment of scores to reflect changes between educa-\ntional cohorts. For example, the score attributed to a degree\nlevel qualification could be set lower for more recent educa-\ntional cohorts, in order to recognise the relative growth in\ngraduate level education. We note that a useful alternative\nmethod to combating credential inflation has been demon-\nstrated by Tam (2007). This approach is called a Positional\nStatus Index (PSI), and scores represent the percentage of\nother survey respondents that an individual has to overtake in\norder to reach their educational level. The PSI approach pro-\nvides a within educational cohort measure and therefore\nlends itself towards providing increased control for creden-\ntial inflation. Bukodi and Goldthorpe (2013) have success-\nfully employed this approach when analysing data from three\nBritish birth cohorts covering different educational\nConclusion\nMeasures of education are essential components of many\nsociological analyses and are powerful predictors of a diverse\nrange of social outcomes. We began this article with the\nclaim that education is more difficult to measure than is often\nassumed. We have tried to draw attention to some hidden\nchallenges associated with undertaking analyses, which\ninclude educational measures. We conclude by making the\nrecommendation that researchers place careful thought into\nwhich educational measure (or measures) they select when\nanalysing survey data.\nIn nations such as the United Kingdom, the education sys-\ntem and qualifications appear to almost be in a constant state\nof flux. We have highlighted that these changes have genuine\ninfluences on education data. It is important for survey data\nanalysts to consider the educational context in which survey\nrespondents undertook their education. We advise against\nresearchers developing ad hoc educational measures which\ndo not facilitate comparability across studies and which do\nnot support reliable and valid replications. When social sur-\nveys contain a number of competing measures, or when\nresearchers can produce different measures, we argue that\nthey should undertake sensitivity analyses which evaluate\nthe merits of different educational measures. As a routine\npart of their analytical programme researchers should make\ntheir sensitivity analyses public, for example in data supple-\nments, on web pages or in institutional repositories.\nIn circumstances where survey data analysts construct\nnew educational measures, it is desirable that they place\neffort into clearly documenting the theoretical basis of the\nmeasures and how they were practically constructed. It is\nalso important that these details are preserved and made\navailable to the wider research community. These practices\nchime squarely with efforts to introduce more replicability\nand with an atmosphere of `open data' in the social sciences\n(see Freese, 2007). There have already been a few efforts in\nthe social sciences to bring together documentation and\nmetadata about the construction of educational measures\nsuggest that these good practices should be encouraged.\nThese activities should support researchers in being better\npositioned to operationalise and compare the properties of\nmultiple relevant measures. These are good habits which\nhave the potential to bring long-term improvements in the\nway in which data on education is used in social science\nresearch.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1. Influential examples include the Youth Cohort Study of\nEngland and Wales, the Longitudinal Study of Young People in\nEngland and the Scottish School Leavers Survey (see Murray\nand Gayle, 2012). There are also specialist cross-national\neducation studies (e.g. Program for International Student\nAssessment (PISA), The Trends in International Mathematics\nand Science Study (TIMSS) and Progress in International\nReading Literacy Study (PIRLS; Brown et al., 2007).\n2. In the United Kingdom school refers to the education com-\npleted within primary and secondary school institutions. These\nschools are attended by pupils between the ages of 5years and\nyears (pupils move from primary to secondary schools at\naround the age of 11\nyears). Secondary schools can include\npupils who have completed their compulsory education, who\nremain in secondary school to complete higher school-level\nschool qualifications (which are required to gain entry into\nhigher education). The term further education refers to edu-\ncation completed in addition to compulsory school educa-\ntion. Further education qualifications often have a vocational\norientation. Higher education refers to education completed\nin addition to compulsory school education, which is more\ndemanding than secondary school education and further edu-\ncation. Higher education is most usually completed within a\nuniversity setting (and will lead to a degree).\n3. For contemporary educational cohorts, the Education and\nSkills Act 2008 increased the minimum age at which young\npeople in England can leave school or formal training. From\n2013 young people had to remain in education until they\nremain in education or training until the age of 18years. The\nschool leaving age currently remains at 16years in the rest of\nthe United Kingdom.\n5. In Scotland pupils also study for a range of subjects, and\ngrades are awarded for each individual subject however, the\nConnelly et al. 9\nexaminations undertaken are different. The same problems\ndescribed in this section emerge from the analysis of school\nexaminations in Scotland.\n6. See http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/performance/2011/\n7.
