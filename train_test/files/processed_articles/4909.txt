The aim was to find the importance of these\nmeasures in the promotion of public accountability in Nigeria. A total of 240 respondents, comprising 140 males (65.6%) and\n100 females (34.4%), answered the questionnaire. The mean age of the respondents was 24.89 years. The result disclosed\nthat these measures were partially implemented in the discharge of duties and this led to the achievement of very limited\nsuccesses. The chi-square was also used to test the relationship between implementation of these measures and effectiveness\nof public accountability. The result revealed a significant relationship. Suggestions were therefore made on how to improve\nthe use of these measures which included recognition of the importance of these measures, adequate monitoring, removal\nof the immunity clause, strict adherence to sanctions irrespective of whoever is involved, and compulsory accountability by\nleaders.\n",

She is called the\n\"giant\" of Africa. Her crude oil production stood at 2,059\nNigeria has been involved in many economic, political, and\nsocial restructurings, yet, ranked very low in the Corruption\nThis performance is certainly not limited to Nigeria. Some\nother African countries have similar low ranking. According\nto the CPI ranking in 2010, many African countries scored\nposition; Burkina Faso 3.1, 98th position; Egypt 3.1; Zambia\nand so on. These low levels of the perception of corruption\nconsequently affect public accountability and tend to impact\nnegatively on academic, social, and cultural rights including\nthe foundation of governance. Obasanjo (2003) and Osagiede\n(2007) noted that in all levels of governance in African coun-\ntries, corruption was seemingly institutionalized as the foun-\ndation of governance. In the execution of duties, political and\nadministrative officials have not adhered to the existing rules\nand regulations, and this has led to the loss of available\nresources by the bureaucrats in their various work places. As\na result, this has greatly undermined accountability and per-\nformance in government. Olu (2002) noted that the legiti-\nmacy and stability of governance became compromised as\ncitizens began to devise extra legal and informal ways to sur-\nvive. The corruption quagmire in most African countries was\nrooted in the failure and virtual collapse of governance, dis-\nregard for procedures and accountability, and the continued\npresence of bad leadership (Obasanjo, 2003).\nHowever, the African Union (AU) concerned about the\nnegative effects of corruption and impunity on the political,\neconomic, social, and cultural stability of African states con-\nsidered ways and means of removing such obstacles to the\nenjoyment of economic, social, and cultural rights (African\nUnion Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption,\nthat African states should establish the necessary conditions\n1University of Nigeria Nsukka, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nAgu Sylvia U, Department of Public Administration and Local\nGovernment, University of Nigeria Nsukka, No 1 Agu-close, off Amobi\nEmail: uchesagu@yahoo.com\nInstrumentalities for the Effectiveness\nof Measures of Public Accountability in\nAfrica: The Nigeria Perspective\nAgu Sylvia U1\n Keywords\neffectiveness, measures, Nigeria, administrative accountability, public accountability, Africa\n2 SAGE Open\nto foster transparency and accountability in the management\nof public affairs. Member states were encouraged to fashion\nmodalities or measures, among other initiatives, for the pro-\nmotion of public accountability and effective eradication of\ncorruption. This stimulated various African Heads of State to\ncome up with an improved and more transparent process of\ngovernment spending which is based on accountability and\ntransparency (Obiajulu, 2005). Obasanjo, past president of\nNigeria, instituted the Budget Monitoring and Price\nIntelligence Unit (BMPIU) which commenced a process of\ncontract award review oversight and certification, theAfrican\nPeer Review Mechanism (APRM), and the anti-corruption\nagencies--Economic and Financial Crime Commission\n(EFCC) and Independent Commission and other Related\nPractices (ICPC)--to fight corruption and restore account-\nability because of the belief that lack of accountability pro-\nmotes corruption.\nPublic accountability refers to answerability to one's\nFormally, public accountability involves the development of\nobjective; standards of evaluation to assist the owners of an\norganization to evaluate the performance of individual\nduties within the organization (Adamolekun, 2002). Public\naccountability also involves subordinate\u00adsuperior relation-\nships, strict compliance with legal requirements, and organi-\nzational policies (Obi, 1996). Public accountability has\nthree crucial components: a clear definition of responsibil-\nity, reporting mechanisms, and a system of review, reward,\nand sanctions. A growing literatures (for example, Amoke &\nindispensable for good governance; the greater the quality\nof public accountability, the greater the quality of good gov-\nernance. The purpose of this article is, therefore, to examine\nthe effectiveness of measures of public accountability in\nNigeria and to find out if these measures were observed in\nthe discharge of duties and the subsequent effect on public\naccountability.\nThere are different manifestations of accountability--\npublic and private--but this work is interested in public\naccountability, which again manifests itself in many forms\nsuch as political, administrative, and fiscal accountability\nfocus of this article is on administrative accountability, the\nextent to which administrators internalize and implement\nthe measures of public accountability in the day-to-day\noperations. Administrative accountability revolves on vir-\ntually every worker in an organization especially those at\nthe upper echelon. Political accountability assumes that\noccupants of political offices would meet the expectations\nof the electorate by fulfilling the promises made in the\nmanifestoes of their parties. Fiscal accountability, on the\nother hand, is directed toward ensuring that funds are uti-\nlized by governments in accordance with established regu-\nlations and guidelines for purposes for which they are\nintended.\nThe aim of these basic groups of accountability is to\nensure that organizations achieve their established objec-\ntives. Below is a sketch of types of public accountability.\nIt is the duty of government officials/functionaries who\nare entrusted with the rules and regulations that guide the\noperations of accountability measures to implement these\nrules and regulations in their day-to-day operations and also\naccount to the people they serve, who conversely depend on\nthem. The efficient operation of these rules and regulations\nwill, to a great extent, improve the performance of public\nenterprises and thus enhance accountability. This article\ntherefore is significant because before the introduction of\nthese measures, the use of primordial consideration and\n\"God Fatherism\" (a form of corruption) abounded in almost\nall public organizations in Nigeria. Unfortunately, there were\ninadequate investigations of the effectiveness of the imple-\nmented measures on public accountability. On the other\nhand, the findings of this article can assist public servants to\nrevamp/improve their attitude to the discharge of their duties\nto implement these measures of public accountability.\nFurthermore, other African countries will benefit from the\nstudy as it will help them unravel the implications of previ-\nous failure to comply with public accountability guidelines,\nand reveal the effectiveness of these measures of public\naccountability.\nThe Issue of Corruption Seen From the African\nPerspective\nCorruption is defined as the abuse of public power for private\nor personal gains and is of growing international and regional\ndictionary definition of corruption is the impairment of integ-\nrity, virtue, or moral principle; depravity, decay, and an induce-\nment to wrong by improper or unlawful means. Corruption is\na universal and historic issue, which occurs in both developed\nand developing countries, and public and private sectors.\nCorruption from petty bribery, nepotism, to large-scale lar-\nceny can have a devastating impact--undermining develop-\nment, destroying public trust, and burdening many sectors of\nsociety, in particular the poor (Onor, 2002). The effect of cor-\nruption is destructive and its reach is insidious, yet many\nAfrican countries have deemed it unwise to discontinue their\ncorrupt tendencies. While many anti-corruption measures\nSource. Adapted from Amoke and Asogwa (2000).\nhave been instituted over the years in many African countries,\nthey have achieved little or no fruitful results (Soma, 2004).\nTransparency International (TI) releases annually their CPI\nwhich measures the perceived level of public sector corruption\nin a country. Below is the CPI of African Countries from 2002\nThe ranking in Table 1 shows how countries compare to\nothers. The CPI score indicates the perceived level of public\nsector corruption in a country. The CPI has been widely criti-\ncized ever since it was introduced. The third-party survey data\nthat the index uses has also been criticized but, considering the\nlevel of perceived corruption in many countries, the index still\nserves as a reliable document (Transparency International\nin the ranking of countries as it pertains to corruption in the\nWorldwide Corruption Perception Index (2010). Countries\nlike Denmark, New Zealand, Singapore, Finland, Netherlands,\nSweden, Canada, Switzerland, Australia, Norway, Iceland,\nLuxembourg, Austria, Germany, Japan, Qatar, United\nKingdom, China, Belgium, and United States scored between\nthe list. Analysis of the figures reveals that these assessments\nTable 1. Corruption Perception Index by Transparency International for Some African Countries From 2002-2010.\nSource. Extracted from Worldwide Corruption Perception Index (2010).\n4 SAGE Open\nwere realistic. African countries scored well below 5 points\ndespite various official resolutions made over the years, such\nas for example in the 34th Ordinary Session of the Heads of\nStates and Governments of Africa in 1998 in Ouagadougou,\nBurkina Faso, to fight against corruption.\nIf the authorities and institutions were accountable, effec-\ntive, efficient, transparent, responsive, and equitable in the\ndischarge of their duties, then the issue of good governance\nand capacity-building, which we believe are desired by all\nAfricans, would be achieved. African governments have\naffirmed their commitment to advancing good governance in\nthe Victoria Falls Declaration of 1999 and reaffirmed the\nImproving governance implies the strengthening of the\nmeasures of public accountability, implementing develop-\nment initiatives, and delivering basic services among a vari-\nety of local participating institutions including local\ngovernments and others. Corruption notably results in\nabsence of transparency and accountability. From the avail-\nable records of TI in Table 1, African countries have not\nfared well.\nEqually significant is the fact that some countries across\neast, south, central, and north Africa had a CPI score lower\nparative data also show improvement in the ranking of some\ncountries in Table 1; the main changes were as follows:\nOther countries had CPI scores lower than 3.0 in the 2010 CPI.\nThese countries included Mozambique, Uganda, Nigeria,\nTogo, Zimbabwe, Mauritania, Cameroon, Libya, Cote d'ivoire,\nNamibia, Kenya, CentralAfrican Republic, Republic of Congo,\nGuinea Bissau, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea,\nAngola, Equatorial Guinea, Burundi, Chad, and Liberia.\nAssembly of Heads of States and Governments of the AU held\nin Lusaka, Zambia, in July 2001 and the first session of the\nAssembly of theAU held in Durban, SouthAfrica, in July 2002\nhelped to establish the necessary conditions to foster transpar-\nency and accountability in the management of public affairs.\nHowever, with this agreement, one would have expected\nthe variousAfrican countries to institute measures that would\npromote accountability and transparency and ensure strict\nimplementation of these measures. However, a close analysis\nof the literature does not reveal any significant change\ndespite the measures instituted to promote accountability and\ncurb corruption (see Table 1).\nMeasures Adopted By Some African\nCountries to Promote Accountability\nAlmost all African countries have introduced measures to\npromote accountability in their various public sector man-\nagement domains. South Africa enacted the Public Finance\n1999. The Act is to regulate financial management in the\nnational and provincial governments, to ensure that all reve-\nnues, expenditures, assets, and liabilities of these govern-\nments are managed efficiently and effectively; to provide for\nthe responsibilities of persons entrusted with financial man-\nagement in these governments; and to provide for matters\nconnected therewith.\nThe object of this Act is to secure transparency, account-\nability, and sound management of the revenues, expenditure,\nassets, and liabilities of the institutions to which this Act\napplies. Section 6(9) stipulates that the act promotes and\nenforces transparency in the management of revenue, expen-\nditures, assets, and liabilities of departments, public entities,\nand constitutional institutions, and performs other functions\nassigned to the national treasury.\nSimilarly, Act 663 of the parliament of the Federal\nRepublic of Ghana, the Public Procurement Act 2003, estab-\nlishes public procurement board, makes administrative and\ninstitutional arrangements for procurement, stipulates ten-\ndering procedures, and provides for purposes connected with\nthese. Part 1(2) of the act stipulates that the objective of the\nboard is to include harmonization of the process of public\nprocurement in the public service, to secure a judicious and\nefficient use of state resources in public procurement, and to\nensure that public procurement is carried out in a fair, trans-\nparent, and non-discriminatory manner. Part 3 stipulates the\nfunctions of the board. One of the important functions of the\nboard is embedded in part 3(g) which is to publish a monthly\nPublic Procurement Bulletin which shall contain information\ngermane to public procurement, including proposed procure-\nment notices, notices of information to tender, and contract\naward information. Other important sections that pertain to\nenhancing accountability in the system are the \"whistle\nblower\" Act 2006. Ghana was the first country to be peer\nreviewed by AU in January 2006, and was praised by observ-\ners as a model for the APRM process across Africa and for\nthe steady progress it has made in becoming a strong democ-\nracy over the previous decade. Ghana's success in the pro-\ncess is attributed to the structure, composition, and autonomy\ngiven to the Governing Council, the body steering the\nreviewed exercise.\nFurthermore, conflict resolution helped this process. The\nLome Peace Accord of 1998 and its subsequent corollaries of\nAbuja I and II in 2000 finally ended the war in Sierra Leone\nand ushered in peace in that country, made provisions for key\nreforms in governance; the responsible use of minerals and\nresources; proceeds and fiscal accountability. The reform\nintroduced in the public sector was aimed at strengthening\nstates institutions, public financial management, and mod-\nernization of the economy (Ibrahim, 2010; Staffen &\nIn addition, some African countries, notably Algeria,\nLiberia, Mauritania, Rwanda, and Ghana, have adopted the\nuse of the International Public Sector Accounting Standard\n(IPSAS) if only on cash basis. IPSAS is a set of Accounting\nStandards issued by the IPSAS Board of the International\nFederation of Accountants (IFAC) for use by public sector\nentities around the world in the preparation of financial state-\nments. IPSAS is a major step in enthronement of accountabil-\nity standards. Conversely, in some African countries such as\nUganda, South Africa, Nigeria, and The Gambia, arrange-\nments are underway to commence a transition from a modified\ncash basis of accounting to adoption of full accrual IPSAS. A\nphased implementation approach is planned (see http://www.\nicasrilanka.com). South Africa and Algeria have also com-\npleted the process of APRM and have been reviewed at the\nJuly AU Summit. Kenya, Rwanda, Mozambique, and Uganda\nhave been judged APRM compliants, all in a bid to promote\naccountability. However, despite all these measures, the\nNigeria Head of Service at the Africa forum on fighting cor-\nruption lamented the limited functioning of the established\nmechanisms withinAfrican countries as well as the weakening\nof governance by globalization. He asserted that African tradi-\ntional values were critical to sustainable good governance\nincluding anti-corruption and integrity promotion crusade.\nNigeria's Experience in the Promotion of Public\nAccountability\nIt is apposite for us to throw some light on the standing of\nNigeria with regard to the implementation of these measures.\nBefore the birth of the Nigeria Fourth Republic, corruption\nhad been practically institutionalized as an instrument of\ngovernance in Nigeria with attendant destructive conse-\nFollowing the resolution adopted by the Assembly of\nAfrican Heads of States in June 1998, the government of\nOlusegun Obasanjo instituted a number of anti-corruption and\nintegrity promotion initiatives. Some of the measures included\nthe Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences\nCommission in 2000 (ICPC) and the EFCC in December\n2002. The government also came up with an improved and\nmore transparent process of government spending based on\naccountability and transparency (Obiajulu, 2005). Historically,\nit is in the award of contracts by various ministries in Nigeria\nthat the poor transparency image of the country is mostly\nascribed. The government of Obasanjo therefore set up the\nBMPIU in 2002, which commenced a process of contract\naward review oversight and Certification commonly called the\n\"Due Process.\" This unit was a clearing house for government\nprocurement of goods and services and was established to\nminimize waste in government expenditure as a result of\ncorruption, lack of accountability, and transparency in Public\nSectors (National Economic Empowerment and Development\nStrategy [NEEDS], 2005). This was instituted after analyzing\nthe different concerns and problems identified as they affect\nthe Federal Service, the public sectors, and governance in gen-\neral. These and several other measures, including the APRM\nthat seeks, inter alia, to promote anti-corruption and integrity\ndid not yield results because of their limited application\nTheoretical Framework\nThe agency theory was first formulated in the academic eco-\nnomic literature in the early 1970s (Jensen & Meckling,\nness schools. In the agency relationship, one party acts on\nbehalf of another. Government is the principal that creates\nthe different anti-corruption agencies to ensure the effective\nimplementation of measures of public accountability. Those\nselected to work in the agencies may have been employed\nbased on certain criteria. In the selection process, govern-\nment may have faced a classical agency problem of asym-\nmetricinformation.Thoseselected/employedmayexaggerate\ntheir talents. Government may have found better persons but\ndid not know enough or may not have provided adequate\nincentives to attract them. The theory assumes that the agents\nmay take advantage of the appointment for their own benefit\nor that of the government. Government may want the highest\nquality job to be done, whereas the agents may want to\nexploit all the information asymmetries to ensure that they\nmaximize their own interests at the expense of the principal.\nAgency theory dictates that the principal tries to bridge the\ninformation asymmetries by installing information systems\nand monitoring the agent.All the activities carried out will be\nmonitored. The government may also offer some incentives\nin an effort to align organizational interest with that of the\nagent. And as part of this incentive, the government compen-\nsates the workers for an outcome-oriented contract. The\nemployees of these organizations can work better if there are\nincentive and proper supervision.\nMaterials and Methods\nGovernment functionaries (those employed by government\nto work in these agencies) are entrusted with the responsibili-\nties to ensure the success of EFCC, ICPC, and BMPIU. The\nestablishment of these agencies was to placate growing,\ndomestic, and international measures. Section 6(9-8) of the\nICPC Act stipulates that ICPC will receive and investigate\ncomplaints from members of the public on allegation of cor-\nrupt practices, and in appropriate cases, prosecute the offend-\ners, and examine the practices, systems, and procedure of\npublic bodies. The EFCC Act however contained far more\ndraconian powers than those of the ICPC. It was enjoined to\ntake all necessary measures to prevent and eradicate eco-\nnomic and financial crimes in Nigeria. Section 6 of the Act\n6 SAGE Open\nstipulates the identifying, monitoring, and freezing or confis-\ncating of proceeds from criminal activities such as terrorism,\nfinancial and economic crimes, and so on. The EFCC has\nabout 1,246 officials on the pay roll but the commission also\nthese numbers, I used the quota sampling technique which is\na type of non-probability sample in which the researcher\nselects people according to some fixed quota. The specific\ncharacteristics on which I based my quota were by gender. I\nchose 240 of the entire relevant population using the quota\nsampling technique. This is because I insisted on including a\ncertain number of males and females. I therefore chose those\nthat are most accessible considering the gender bias (Obasi,\n27% obtained the West African school certificate, 33%\nobtained the Ordinary National Diploma, and 40% were first\ndegree and master's degree students. A total of 79.16% were\nChristians whereas 20.84% were Moslems. The mean age\nwas 24.89. I also considered those who had been in the ser-\nvice for more than 5 years. The researcher distributed 240\nquestionnaires.\nSome of the questionnaires were open ended whereas oth-\ners were closed-ended. A total of 186 relevant responses\nwere received.\nIndependent Measure\nTo capture respondents'views on measures of public account-\nability in Africa using Nigeria as a case study, respondents\nwere asked to agree, strongly agree, strongly disagree, or dis-\nidea (Questions 1, 5, and 6) and fully implemented, partially\nimplemented, and implemented to Questions 3 and 4.\nQuestions asked by the researcher were as follows:\n1. Are you aware of the several measures put in place\nby the government of Obasanjo to enthrone account-\nability and combat corruption?\n2. What are these measures?\n3. Do you think that these measures are implemented in\nthe discharge of duties in the Nigerian public\nservices?\n4. If yes, to what extent has the Nigeria public service\nimplemented these measures in the discharge of\nduties?\n5. Are some of these measures better implemented than\nothers?\n6. Are hindrances encountered in the implementation of\nthese measures?\n7. If yes, what are these hindrances?\n8. Are these measures applicable to all the parastatals in\nthe Nigeria public service?.\n9. Lack of implementation of these measures attracts\nsanctions irrespective of whoever is involved.\n10. Implementation of these measures has contributed to\nthe effectiveness of public accountability in the\nNigeria public service.\n11. The emplacements of these measures have actually\ncurbed corruption\n12. What is the position of Nigeria in the Transparency\nInternational Index before and after the emplace-\nments of these measures?\nTable 2 shows that 122 males and 64 females filled the ques-\ntionnaires and returned them while the age distribution of\nrespondents reveals that 140 were between the ages of 20\nabove (see Table 3). The questions were answered by these\nage groups.\nFindings pertaining to the first research question (see\nTable 4, Item 1) revealed that all the workers knew about the\nseveral measures put in place in the Nigeria public service to\npromote accountability (100%). When asked what these\nmeasures were, respondents ticked ICPC, EFCC, BMPIU,\nExtractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), moneti-\nzation of public officers, fringe benefits, Servicom Charters\nand creating Servicom, Modal Units in Ministries/\nDepartments/Agencies (MDAs). The EITI, according to\nTable 2. Results and Findings.\nSex Respondents %\nTable 3. Age Distribution of Respondents.\nAge Respondents %\nTable 4. Respondents' View on The Measures for Effective\nPublic Accountability.\nItems Yes % No % No idea % Total\nNote. Yes = positive; No = negative; No idea = ignorant.\nrespondents, was aimed at encouraging the Nigerian National\nPetroleum Corporation (NNPC) and other oil and gas com-\npanies to fully disclose revenues and cost of operations.\nMDAs were designed to break the twin evils of corruption\nand inefficiency in public service delivery, improve budget\ndiscipline through efforts to establish annual budget frame-\nwork, and provide guidelines to be followed by all the three\ntiers of government.\nResults showed that about 30.4% believed that these mea-\nsures were fully implemented, 51.06% believed they were\npartially implemented, and 18% believed that these measures\nwere not implemented at all (see Table 5, Item 3). Although\n51.06% was not an overwhelming majority, it was more than\nhalf the number who answered the questionnaire. It then fol-\nlows that these measures were not fully implemented in the\ndischarge of duties in the Nigeria public service. This also\nshows that the activities of the agencies were not properly\nsupervised according to agency theory to achieve results.\nThe question on the extent to which these measures were\nimplemented recorded very poor results (see Table 5, Item\n4). The agency theory states that agents may take advantage\nof appointment for their own benefit or that of the govern-\nment, and this may account for the poor results obtained. If\ngovernment had played its role of bridging the information\nasymmetries and monitored workers, a better result would\nhave been achieved. We should note that partial fulfillment\nof any measure does not attract full reward.\nThis could explain the reason for the insignificant change in\nthe CPI ranking. For Research Questions 4, 5, and 6, respon-\ndents indicated that these measures were not fully imple-\nmented. The extent to which these measures were implemented\nrecorded very poor results. The majority of the respondents\nopined that corruption was structurally engraved in the system\nof public administration and this could be one of the main rea-\nsons for non-implementation of these measures. Many\nadvanced phrases like \"If you are in the good book of govern-\nment, you can turn the rules upside down and go scot free,\"\n\"Does anything good work in Nigeria,\" and so on. However, a\ngood number, about 80.11%, responded that some of these\nmeasures were better implemented than others (see Table 4,\nItem 5). Some mentioned that the BMPIU is working better\nthan some anti-corruption commissions and has saved the\ncountry millions of naira. The BMPIU recorded significant\nresults because of the intense monitoring by government and\ndue to the fact that the agency was headed by an honest person.\nWe also discovered that government negative intervention was\nminimal in the award of contracts which led to effective imple-\nmentation of due process mechanism. According to the theory,\ngovernment created these agencies to ensure effective imple-\nmentation of these measures. Other respondents were of the\nopinion that the Budget Discipline was not working properly as\nit was usually violated by those in authority especially at local\ngovernment levels. Monetization of employee fringe benefits\nworked only in the federal parastatals and that does not mean\nthat workers had not devised means of defrauding parastatals.\nThe majority of the respondents mentioned that EFCC and\nICPC were effective only with regard to victims who were not\nin the good books of government. Respondents criticized the\nactivities of the new chairperson of EFCC and said that he\nbrought to book some culprits, but not all. The article went fur-\nther to find out if hindrances were encountered in the imple-\nmentation of these measures. An impressive result was\nobtained; those who answered strongly agreed and agreed\ncomprised 82.5%, and they believed that hindrances were\nencountered in the implementation of these measures (see\nTable 4). When asked about some of these hindrances encoun-\ntered, members stated categorically that rules were violated to\nprotect the interest of government, the workers, and those in\nauthority. \"You don't crucify your employers\" do you? was one\nresponse.\nIt does appear that the rules set by government were also\nviolated by the same body. Most of the respondents opined\nthat God Fatherism clogged to the implementation of mea-\nsures. Respondents advanced typical comments of officials\nsuch as \"If you don't obey what I say, you'll be fired\"; \"This\nis my relative; if you value your job; just do what I said.\"\nagreed\" that these measures were applicable to all public\nenterprises in public service, except the monetization of\nfringe benefits which they purported as applicable only to\nfederal government workers (see Table 6, Item 8).\n\"disagreed\" respectively that lack of implementation of these\nmeasures attracts sanctions irrespective of whoever is\ninvolved. Respondents believed that the law in that case is a\n\"respecter of persons.\" They said that the position one holds\nmatters a lot. They cited the case of one-time speaker of the\nHouse of Representatives and some state governors who\nwere protected by the immunity clause. According to them,\nthese persons deserved to be fired but were not. When asked\nabout the former Minister of Education, they said that the\nsledge hammer fell on him because he was not in the good\nTable 5.

However, a good number of the\nrespondents believed that implementation of these mecha-\nnisms in some areas had contributed to the effectiveness of\npublic accountability (see Table 6, Item 10). Finally, a chi-\nsquare was performed to find out the relationship between\nthe implementation of these measures emplaced and public\naccountability. The result revealed that there is a significant\nrelationship between the implementation of these measures\nand public accountability. The level of significance is .05.\nThe degree of freedom of = (R - 1) (C - 1) = (5 - 1) (2 - 1)\n= 4 From the X2, significant level of .05, the critical value is\nDecision Rule: Reject critical value if greater than statisti-\ncal value at level of significance .05 and accountability in the\nNigeria public service. A typical example was the case of\none-time speaker of the House of Representatives, Federal\nRepublic of Nigeria. She assigned N628 million for the reno-\nvation of her official residence and official car. When con-\nfronted by the House, she claimed that she had followed due\nprocess rules and regulations. She went further to make use\nof ghost companies to execute the projects. A Newswatch\n(Daminabo, 2007) investigation revealed that the procedure\nfor the award of the contract was substantially at variance\nwith the prescribed process. The summary of the case was\nthat she did not follow the due process mechanism installed\nin the system and the budget discipline was not followed.\nHer crime was detected, but she was merely demoted instead\nof being recalled by her constituency. Another example was\nthe Abuja National Stadium contract awarded in 2000 before\nthe enactment of the Due Process Guideline which requires\nthat any project with federal government funding must be\nbacked by a Due Process Certificate. Therefore, in this case,\nthe BMPIU had to do a retroactive compliance review on the\nprocurement process. This was to ascertain the true cost of\nthe project. The process for awarding the contract would not\nhave passed the due process test had the policy been in place\nwhen the contract was awarded. However, the best outcome\nthat government could secure was to compare the contract\ncost to international, regional, or national pricing. It is worth\nnoting that contrary to the wrong costing quoted before the\nstadium, the BMPIU achieved a post procurement cost sav-\nAgain, in December 2005, the BMPIU had saved Nigeria\nabout N960 billion from a single contract within 4 years of\nits implementation (Ezekwesili, 2006). These efforts by the\nagencies are reflected in the scores of TI. However, despite\nthe establishment of these institutions to enhance the effec-\ntiveness of public accountability, the level of corruption is\nstill serious and remains one of the greatest challenges in\nNigeria. The former chairman of Due Process, Dr. Oby\nEzekwesili, stated that the Due Process saved Nigeria\nN672.4 million from a single project of supplying equip-\nment to tertiary institutions by the Ministry of Health.\nAccording to Wahab (2005), the success of this aspect of the\nreform, no doubt, contributed to the realization of debt relief\ngranted to Nigeria in 2005. It is also important to note that\nDue Process is the best development mechanism that coun-\ntries like South Korea, Malaysia, South Africa, Singapore,\nGhana, Botswana, Uganda, United Kingdom, and United\nStates of Africa have utilized effectively in instituting and\nachieving high relief in public expenditure, efficiency, and\nvalue for money in the delivery of social goods, works,\nand services to communities.\nThe researcher also performed a chi-square test to see if\npartial implementation of these measures will promote\naccountability. The level of significance is .05, df = (R - 1)\nthe critical value is 9.48. As critical value 9.48 is less than\nstatistical value which is 10.98, I therefore concluded that\npartial implementation of these measures will not promote\naccountability and transparency. The report of the ICPC and\nEFCC on several cases investigated as well as those success-\nfully prosecuted indicated that poor accountability had led to\nloss of revenues. One of Nigeria's former heads of state and\ncommander in chief was discovered to have stolen more than\n$3.0 billion, which was found in foreign accounts. A one-\ntime inspector general of police was found guilty of siphon-\ning off N17.0 billion by the EFCC. However, some state\ngovernors accused of looting state treasuries were still under\namount, according to Ogunlaya, represented 4% of federal\nthat three top officials of Oyo State Government as well as a\nconsultant were detained by the EFCC over alleged involve-\nment in N8.3 billion road contract scam. A concerned indi-\nvidual in that state wrote a petition and this was what actually\nTable 6. Respondents' View on Measures of Public Accountability.\nItems SA % A % SDA % DA %\nNote. SA = strongly agree; A = agree; SDA = strongly disagree; DA = disagree.\nled to the arrest of the culprits. If these measures installed in\nthe system were fully implemented, these crimes would have\nbeen averted. Though they were later discovered, prevention\nis better than cure. Conversely, it is estimated that up to 40%\nof government budgets at various levels were lost to corrupt\ngovernment officials. Those who made the law were the ones\nwho violated it. Similarly, Nigeria would have performed\nbetter if the activities of those in the corridors of power had\nbeen transparent. If government officials had been fully\naccountable and open, the remaining 60% would have pro-\nduced quality projects or services. Unfortunately, this is\nhighly compromised as a result of corrupt practices of gov-\nernment (Agu, 2008). According to TI, Nigeria improved on\nthe world's most corrupt countries profile from third position\nuted to the zeal with which the anti-corruption agencies per-\nformed in prosecuting corrupt officials which served as a\ndeterrent. Timely intervention of these anti-corruption bod-\nies is of immense value. For instance, South Africa has the\nPublic Finance Management Act which contains measures to\npromote accountability and transparency. From all indica-\ntions, the country has to some extent adopt the provisions of\nthis act as it was among the African countries that scored\nAfrican government cancelled 152.7 million contract follow-\ning serious allegations of tender irregularities.\nThe ICPC, which focuses on curbing bribery and corrup-\ntion in the Nigeria public service, stipulates in the ICPC Act\npunishments to be meted out to offenders, but these provi-\nsions were not implemented when those in the good books of\ngovernment were involved.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nThis article assessed the various anti-corruption measures\ninstalled in some African countries for the effectiveness of\npublic accountability. We discovered that the key functionar-\nies in the Nigerian public sector do not adhere strictly to\nthese measures in the discharge of their duties. Their lack of\ncommitment manifested as nepotism, favoritism, and gender\nbias. Furthermore, those in the corridors of power also con-\ntributed significantly to poor implementation of these mea-\nsures as rules were violated for their sake. The Nigeria State\nshould consider very seriously the implementation of the\nmeasures instituted and ensure that all offenders receive pun-\nishment as stipulated. This would in no small measure pro-\nmote accountability. It would also save wastage of resources:\nThe efforts, however small, made by the various chairper-\nsons of these bodies (BMPIU, ICPC, and EFCC) saved so\nmuch money for the country. Agency theory advocates strict\nsupervision to ensure compliance, but this was relegated to\nthe background. This lack of effective supervision led to\nundermining of public accountability and promotion of cor-\nruption. The relationship between an increasing rate of poor\naccountability, transparency, and corruption seems to enjoy\nstrong support. Conversely, there appears to be lack of cohe-\nsion demonstrated by the absence of full implementation of\nthese measures in the Nigeria public sectors. According to\nOronsaye (2007), corruption thrives in the face of the break-\ndown of moral and ethical values in the society. All the sec-\ntors of the economy and society are bedeviled by the cancer\nof corruption in almost equal measure as none is an island of\nitself. Evidence also showed that these cluster of anti-corrup-\ntion measures recorded very limited success because of the\npoor wage and incentive structures that should normally sup-\nport productivity in the public sectors.\nAgency theory advocates for increased salaries to moti-\nvate workers to give their best, and on this basis government\nshould increase salaries and incentives of workers to achieve\na better result. In addition, the \"immunity syndrome\"\nbestowed on those in government also contributed to merely\na partial implementation of these measures. Arising from the\nforegoing, I advance the following recommendations. The\nNigeria public sector should devise a better method of how\nto implement measures for the effectiveness of public\naccountability and transparency. These measures recorded\nvery limited success because they were not properly imple-\nmented. The empirical evidence reflected the lack of com-\nmitment on the part of government officials who failed fully\nto apply laws and regulations of these rules through their\nrefinement, using best-practice-tested approaches (Oronsaye,\nWith regard to recognition of the importance of these\nmeasures for the good of the country, there is a need to rec-\nognize the importance and role these measures would play if\nimplemented. For instance, Due Process or the Public\nProcurement Tender is the best development-boosting mech-\nanism utilized by countries such as South Korea, Malaysia,\nSouth Africa, Singapore, Ghana, Uganda, and even the\nUnited Kingdom and the United States to effectively institute\nand achieve a high rate of public expenditure, efficiency, and\nvalue for money in the delivery of social goods, works, and\nservices.\nThis has practical implication; it suggests that if these\nmechanisms were adhered to, it would lead to promotion of\naccountability and transparency, and curb corruption drasti-\ncally. It would also encourage investors. We therefore appeal\nfor strong recognition and implementation of the importance\nof these measures.\nThere is need for a change of mindset about the imple-\nmentation of these measures by those in authority and the\nfunctionaries in the different ministries. Strict adherence to\nthese measures would improve service delivery, efficiency,\ncompetition, and effectiveness, and curtail corruption. This\nwould also facilitate Nigeria to be enlisted among the devel-\noped nations of the world. Those in the corridors of power\nshould be the first to implement these measures. Obama was\nthe first to publicly declare his tax return in 2010 in America\nto show the citizens the importance of paying tax. In Nigeria,\n\"big men\" do not pay taxes but public servants do.According\nto Oguonu (2004), there is need for institutionalizing, inter-\nnalizing, and building ownership for the multitude of reforms\nwithin the public sectors so as to ensure its sustenance in the\nanti-corruption campaign. It is vital for our leaders to\nenthrone the principle of openness, transparency, mobility,\nand accountability in their day-to-day operations.\nMoreover, a system of internal checks has to be built into\nthe system to ensure that measures are fully enforced. This\nis a very important step toward achieving the set goals.\nQualified, honest, and sincere personnel with good records\nare perhaps the best internal check. However, on February\nNigerian citizens wrote to the President concerning the\nappointment of Justice Pius Aderemi, a retired justice, as the\nnext chairman of the ICPC. The Coalition referred\nSection 5(6) of the constitution. This section according to\nthem nullifies the appointment of the retired Judge. They\nstated categorically that the appointment of the leadership of\nanti-corruption agency in Nigeria should be driven by a\ndesire to effect fundamental and radical change in Nigeria,\nnot by parochial and self- service interest. His antecedents\ndoes not qualify him for the position given to him . Again,\nthey lamented on the ineffectiveness of these commissions\nparticularly under the previous leadership of retired justice\nof Supreme Court and police officers. With regard to ade-\nquate monitoring of corruption, ad hoc task force commit-\ntees need to be set up in all public enterprises to monitor the\nimplementation of the various instruments put in place to\nfight corruption which undermined accountability. Proper\nmonitoring would lead to full implementation of these mea-\nsures installed to promote accountability. Government\nshould show commitment and make these agencies autono-\nmous to enable them to execute their duties effectively and\nefficiently. There should be increase in salary of workers\nand incentives to motivate them: According to Oronsaye\n(2007), anti-corruption measures recorded very limited suc-\ncess because of poor wages and incentive structures in the\nNigeria Civil Service. There is, therefore, a clear need to\narticulate and harmonize new salary packages for workers\nwith a view to motivating them when the need arises. Poor\nwelfare and working conditions, which do not provide for\ndecent living, often encourage non-implementation of such\nconstituency allowance, whereas a full-time state civil ser-\nNigeria went on strike because of non-implementation of a\ndant social insecurity affects the perception of public ser-\nvants. More so, the attitude of both federal and state\ngovernments toward the payment of retirement benefits and\npensions also influences workers' attitudes to the applica-\ntion of these measures put in place to guide against fraudu-\nlent activities.\nThe introduction of the new pension scheme in the Nigeria\nFederal Service is a step in the right direction, but of equal\nimportance is the fact that state civil servants should be\nincluded in this arrangement. Young school leavers consti-\ntute 40% of the Nigerian population, and they are dependent\non their parents who are in the public service. How can their\nneeds be met with their parents' meager salaries? Again, the\nimmunity clause should be expunged. The withdrawal of this\nclause would give the administration an opportunity to truly\nexpress, in practical terms, a commitment to promote\naccountability and transparency, and curb corruption.\n"
