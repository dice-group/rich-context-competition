Pfaff, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, and approved July 27, 2011 (received for review January 24, 2011)\nRates of obesity have been steadily increasing, along with dis-\norders commonly associated with obesity, such as cardiovascular\ndisease and type II diabetes. Simultaneously, average sleep times\nhave progressively decreased. Recently, evidence from both\nlaboratory and epidemiologic studies has suggested that insuffi-\ncient sleep may stimulate overeating and thus play a role in the\ncurrent epidemic of obesity and diabetes. In the human sleep\nlaboratory it is now possible to carefully control sleep behavior\nand study the link between sleep duration and alterations in\ncirculating hormones involved in feeding behavior, glucose me-\ntabolism, hunger, and appetite. This article focuses on the method-\nologies used in experimental protocols that have examined\nmodifications produced by sleep restriction (or extension) com-\npared with normal sleep. The findings provide evidence that sleep\nrestriction does indeed impair glucose metabolism and alters the\ncross-talk between the periphery and the brain, favoring excessive\nfood intake. A better understanding of the adverse effects of sleep\nrestriction on the CNS control of hunger and appetite may have\nimportant implications for public health.\nappetite regulation | sleep manipulation | insulin sensitivity | leptin |\nghrelin\nThe colloquia, \"Medical Phenomena Susceptible to Quanti-\ntative Approaches\" encompassed various areas of research\nthat showed that it is indeed possible to rigorously manipulate\nhuman behavior and measure valuable stringent outcomes.\nWithin the context of this volume on the \"Quantification of\nBehavior,\" the present article focuses on methods that have been\nused to manipulate human sleep duration and quality in the\nlaboratory while examining the consequences on hormones,\nmetabolism, and the control of food intake. We first briefly in-\ntroduce the epidemiologic evidence in support of a link between\nsleep disturbances and an increased risk of obesity and diabetes.\nAfter this introduction, we provide some basic background in-\nformation regarding the CNS control of eating behavior for\nreaders of this volume who do not focus on this area of inquiry.\nLast, we describe the combination of quantitative methods that\nhave been used in well-controlled laboratory studies of the im-\npact of sleep restriction on the risks of obesity and diabetes.\nEpidemiologic Evidence for a Link Between Sleep Disturbances\nand the Risk of Obesity and Diabetes\nIt is well established that the prevalence of overweight and\nobesity has steadily increased worldwide in recent years, with\nparticularly alarming acceleration in the last 2 decades in the\nUnited States (1). In America, all race, sex, age, and socioeco-\nnomic groups have been affected by this epidemic. According to\ndata collected by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\nof the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in\n1985 no participating states had obesity rates greater than 15%.\npopulation, and not a single state had obesity rates under 10%.\nMost concerning is that these rates have continued to increase;\nin 2009 only one state had obesity rates lower than 20%, whereas\nnine states reported a prevalence of obesity $30% of the state's\npopulation. Along with the rise in the prevalence of obesity,\ndisorders commonly associated with obesity, such as cardiovas-\ncular disease and type II diabetes, have concurrently increased.\nConsidering that obesity is associated with adverse health out-\ncomes, elucidating potential contributing factors to the epidemic\nof obesity may have important implications for public health.\nTraditional explanations for the increase in the prevalence of\noverweight and obesity have focused on portion size, wide avail-\nability of inexpensive high-calorie/high-fat foods, and decreased\nphysical activity. Experts recognize that these traditional explan-\nations do not fully explain the epidemic. In recent years, other\nputative causal mechanisms have begun to emerge, including\nchronic partial sleep loss and poor sleep quality.\nAs the incidence of obesity has increased, average sleep times\nhave indeed decreased. Polls conducted by the CDC and the\nNational Sleep Foundation (NSF), as well as large-scale epide-\nmiological studies, have indicated that Americans may be\nchronically sleep deprived because of voluntary bedtime cur-\ncan Cancer Society found that the majority of respondents\nstudies were beginning to reveal reductions in average self-\nreported sleep times to 7\u00ad8 h per night (6\u00ad8). Self-reported sleep\ntimes have continued to decline, as evidenced by the 2008 NSF\npoll in which adults reported sleeping 6 h 40 min on weeknights\n(4, 9). The most recent NSF poll detailed average self-reported\nsleep times across racial groups; all groups reported sleep times\nless than 7 h per weeknight, with whites reporting on average 6 h\nHispanics 6 h 34 min (9). Fig. 1 illustrates the intriguing finding\nthat already in 1965 a larger proportion of short sleepers was\nfound among African Americans, a population at increased risk\nfor cardio-metabolic disease. Further, the proportion of short\nsleepers in this high-risk population and in Hispanics, an ethnic\ngroup with a higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes, has been\nInterestingly, when measured objectively, sleep times may be\nlower than estimated with self-reports.

Declines in sleep time can be attributed, in\npart, to extended work schedules including shift work, long com-\nmuting times, stressful lifestyles, modern conveniences such\nas 24-h television and computer/Internet use, and social and\nleisure activities.\nThere is a growing body of evidence suggesting a link between\ninsufficient sleep duration and increased risk of obesity and type\nII diabetes. The epidemiological evidence for an association\nbetween short sleep and elevated body mass index (BMI) has\npreviously been reviewed (14, 15) and established that the ma-\njority of both cross-sectional and prospective studies, whether in\nchildren or adults, had positive findings relating short sleep to\nincreased obesity risk after controlling for multiple confounders.\nImportantly, the increased risk of obesity that may be attribut-\nable to insufficient sleep seems to be larger in children than in\nadults (15). Nonetheless, the relationship between short sleep\nand elevated BMI persists in both older men and women, as\ndemonstrated in a large study that used actigraphy to assess sleep\nalso strong epidemiologic evidence for a link between short sleep\nand an increased risk of type II diabetes. Among prospective\nstudies (which provide some indication regarding direction of\ncausality), seven of nine studies examining the incidence of di-\nabetes in short sleepers found a significantly elevated risk. A\nrecent meta-analysis combining data from 90,623 individuals\nconcluded that for short sleep duration (#5\u00ad6 h per night), the\nrelative risk of developing diabetes was 1.28 after controlling for\nmultiple factors (17). Not included in this meta-analysis is the\nobserved that individuals who report sleeping <5 h per night,\nrelative to those reporting 7\u00ad8 h per night, had a 46% higher risk\nof developing type II diabetes, after controlling for multiple\nconfounders, including adiposity.\nDespite this increasing body of epidemiologic evidence, the\nmechanistic pathways linking sleep restriction with appetite\ndysregulation, increased food intake, and impaired glucose me-\ntabolism remain poorly understood.\nMechanistic Pathways Linking Central and Peripheral\nControl of Metabolism and Energy Balance\nThere are a plethora of mechanisms and redundancies within the\nCNS and periphery that work in concert to regulate feeding be-\nhavior and energy expenditure. Interestingly, despite the re-\ndundancy of these systems, alterations in a single neuroregulatory\npathway can lead to modifications in food intake and energy ex-\npenditure (19). For the purpose of this article, we focus on a few\ncirculating molecular signals that influence these outcomes.\nA potential mechanism of action between chronic partial sleep\nloss and alterations in appetite regulation and metabolism may\nlie within the hypothalamus and/or within hypothalamic com-\nmunication with peripheral systems. Hypothalamic nuclei have\na well-established role in modulating energy homeostasis and\nfeeding regulation; lesions of ventromedial, paraventricular, and\ndorsomedial nuclei or stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus\n(LH) produce hyperphagia, whereas lesions of the LH inhibit\nfeeding (20). More specifically, the arcuate nucleus (Arc) lies\nclose to the third ventricle; thus, circulating satiety and/or hunger\nsignals, including those secreted from fat tissue, pancreas, and\nthe gut, easily interact with this nucleus. Arc neurons produce\nand respond to neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related protein\n(AgRP), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), and cocaine- and am-\nphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) to influence feeding\nbehavior and energy homeostasis (21, 22). In fact, discrete acti-\nvation of these Arc neurons can facilitate alterations in behavior\nand energy expenditure; excitation of NPY/AgRP neurons\nincreases food intake and decreases energy expenditure, and\nstimulation of POMC/CART receptors inhibits food intake and\nincreases energy expenditure (20, 23). Thus, some peripherally\nsecreted substrates modulate feeding and energy expenditure via\ndirect action on these cells within the Arc. Moreover, cells within\nthe Arc directly project to the LH, which in turn projects to\nthalamo-cortical systems, central autonomic effectors, and motor\npattern generators that influence regulation of feeding (24).\nThus, the Arc, LH, and the substrates that modulate these nuclei\nare primary candidates of study when examining the effect of\nsleep restriction on metabolic systems but are normally not ac-\ncessible to experimental assessment in humans.\nThere are multiple peptides and hormones that are important\nin the regulation of metabolism and energy balance and act on\nthese hypothalamic nuclei, including those originating from fat\ntissue (such as leptin and adiponectin) and the gut (such as\nghrelin, peptide YY, pancreatic polypeptide, and cholecystoki-\nnin). Although the main source of these molecules resides in the\nperiphery, they are also present in the CNS. Studies that exam-\nined the impact of sleep disturbances on energy balance have\nmostly focused on leptin and ghrelin, and we will therefore limit\nour brief review to these two pivotal players. Leptin, discovered\nin 1994, is one such peptide hormone encoded by the obesity\ngene (ob) that is secreted by white adipose tissue into the cir-\nculatory system (25). Leptin is thought to be an index of energy\nsufficiency (23). It is hypothesized that a decrease in leptin levels\nmay be a critical signal to the CNS, indicating a state of depleted\nenergy stores in which appetite should increase and energy ex-\npenditure decrease, favoring survival. Simply put, it influences\nfeeding behavior and energy expenditure via leptin receptors\nthat are most abundantly found in the arcuate, ventromedial, and\ndorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus (26) as well as other\nextrahypothalamic CNS sites, and peripheral tissues (although\nless is known about the mechanism of action in these areas) (22,\n26). Within the Arc, leptin directly activates, via depolarization,\nhypothalamic POMC/CART neurons and in contrast, inhibits\n(hyperpolarizes) NPY/AgRP hypothalamic neurons (21, 27).\nInterestingly, within the Arc, 40% of POMC neurons express the\nlong form of the leptin receptor (28). Thus, one mechanism by\nwhich leptin mediates energy homeostasis is via its action on\nWhite African-\nAmerican\nHispanic Other\nShort Sleep %\nFig. 1.

Regarding appetite regulation, indi-\nviduals lacking leptin or the leptin receptor become obese (29),\nand leptin replacement therapy has been shown to alleviate\nobesity in some subjects (30). However, in obesity that is not\nrelated to a genetic defect in the leptin system, peripheral leptin\nlevels are increased rather than decreased, indicating central\nresistance to leptin signaling in obesity (31). In normal-weight\nindividuals, plasma leptin levels increase immediately after food\nintake and decrease in response to food deprivation (32\u00ad34).\nInterestingly, recent data have suggested that leptin may also\nplay a role in modulating glucose metabolism, independent of\nits effects on energy balance (19). For instance, leptin adminis-\ntration to leptin-deficient mice and humans improves hyper-\ninsulinemia and hyperglycemia, even during controlled food\nContrasting with the role of leptin as a peripheral signal for\nsatiety, ghrelin, a hormone produced by endocrine cells within\nthe stomach, plays a role in stimulating appetite, as well as pro-\nmoting effective storage of consumed food; ghrelin has been\ndescribed as a signal of energy insufficiency (29). One mecha-\nnism by which ghrelin exerts these effects is via pathways that\npartly overlap leptin-sensitive pathways (23). For instance, NPY/\nAgRP cells within the Arc express ghrelin receptors, and ghrelin\nactivates these neurons; ghrelin depolarizes NPY/AgRP neurons\nwhile simultaneously increasing inhibitory input to POMC/\nCART neurons (23, 38). With respect to appetite regulation, in\nhumans there is a premeal rise in plasma ghrelin, suggesting a\nrole for ghrelin in meal initiation (39). It is apparent that ghrelin\nis involved in mediating energy homeostasis via feeding regula-\ntion; however, the exact mechanism of ghrelin action is still\nunclear. The acylation of ghrelin is necessary for some, but not\nall, of its endocrine actions. Nonacylated ghrelin circulates in\nmuch larger amounts than acylated ghrelin and may have distinct,\nand perhaps antagonistic, metabolic effects.\nAppetite regulation and energy homeostasis are also under the\ncontrol of insulin. Insulin receptors are expressed in many areas\nof the body, including of course liver, muscle, and fat, but,\naccording to most but not all studies, are also present in the CNS\n(40). Similar to leptin, insulin receptors are located within the\n4 hr bedtime\nSLEEP\nRECOVERY\nBASELINE\n8 hr bedtime\n24 hr Blood Sampling\nSW Suppression\nNormal\nSW Suppression\nSW Suppression\nNormal\nNormal\nNormal\nRandomized Cross-Over Design:\nNormal Sleep vs. Reduced Sleep Quality\nConstant glucose infusion 5g/kg/24hr\nBlood Sampling every 20min\nHunger/Appetite Questionnaire every 60 min\nExtension\nRestriction\n4 hr bedtime\nRandomized Cross-Over Design:\n2 Days of Sleep Extension or Restriction\nC\nFig. 2. (A) Experimental protocol included three baseline nights of 8 h in bed (white bars), followed by six night of sleep restriction (4 h in bed; black bars),\nending with a seven night period of sleep extension (12 h in bed; light gray bars). The last 2 d of the sleep-debt and sleep-extension periods included identical\nmeals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (small arrows), an ivGTT to assess glucose metabolism (large arrow), and 24-h blood sampling to examine circulating\nhormonal profiles (dashed lines). (B) In a randomized cross-over design, two nights of either bedtime extension (10 h in bed; dark gray bars) or sleep re-\nstriction (4 h in bed; black bars) were followed by 12 h of blood sampling, coupled with a constant glucose infusion and hourly questionnaires regarding\nhunger/appetite, mood, and sleepiness.

Intracerebroventricular in-\nfusion of insulin decreases NPY mRNA in the Arc, and insulin-\ndeficient rats show increased hypothalamic mRNA expression\n(41\u00ad43). Further, recent studies have shown that leptin and in-\nsulin both act on POMC neurons, although within distinct sub-\npopulations within the Arc (44). Regarding food intake spe-\ncifically, intraventricular infusions of insulin reduce food intake\nand body weight (29). As body weight increases, basal levels of\ninsulin and insulin levels in response to a meal increase in an\nattempt to maintain normal glucose homeostasis.\nSleep deprivation affects glucose metabolism through multiple\npathways. The brain uses as much as 50% of total glucose uti-\nlization in the fasting state (20% in the fed state), which is 10\ntimes more than predicted on a mass basis. Imaging studies have\nshown that the sleep-deprived brain uses 7\u00ad8% less glucose than\nthe well-rested brain. A limitation of these imaging studies is that\nthey have been conducted under conditions of total sleep dep-\nrivation. Thus, the impact of recurrent partial sleep restriction,\na much more common condition, on brain glucose metabolism\nremains to be elucidated. Another major pathway linking sleep\nloss and peripheral function is the autonomous nervous system.\nAlterations of cardiac sympatho-vagal balance, with higher sym-\npathetic nervous activity and lower vagal tone, have been docu-\nmented in a number of studies of human sleep loss, including\nstudies of partial sleep restriction (45). Whether similar alter-\nations of autonomic nervous system control in conditions of sleep\nloss occur at multiple organ levels is not known. A few studies\nhave shown that norepinephrine levels are elevated during sleep\ndeprivation (46) and in individuals suffering from obstructive sleep\napnea (47). Peripheral organs that play a major role in glucose\nregulation and are strongly affected by sympathetic activity in-\nclude the liver, pancreas, adipose tissue, and the gastrointestinal\ntract. Sleep loss also dysregulates counter-regulatory hormones in\na manner consistent with the promotion of hyperglycemia and/or\ninsulin resistance. Indeed, elevations of evening cortisol levels\n(48\u00ad51), increased release of growth hormone and ghrelin during\ndaytime hours (52\u00ad54), and elevated daytime levels of epinephrine\n(55) have all been observed under sleep debt conditions.\nOrexins A and B, two peptides that are synthesized by neurons\nconcentrated in the LH, constitute a molecular link between\nsleep\u00adwake regulation and the neuroendocrine control of ap-\npetite. Orexin-containing neurons play a central role in the main-\ntenance of arousal. There is evidence that orexins may stimulate\nfood intake, particularly the early part of the usual sleep period,\nwhich is when voluntary sleep deprivation most often occurs in\nhumans (56, 57). Feeding requires the maintenance of wakeful-\nness, and the orexin system seems to play a central role in this\ninteraction between feeding and arousal (58). Orexin-containing\nneurons are active during waking and quiescent during sleep.\nDeficiencies in the orexin system are associated with sleep dis-\norders that involve chronic excessive daytime sleepiness, in-\ncluding narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea. In contrast,\nwhen sleep deprivation is enforced behaviorally, the orexin sys-\ntem is overactive, most likely to maintain wakefulness against the\nincreased sleep pressure (59\u00ad61). The orexin system activates the\nappetite-promoting NPY neurons in the Arc (62). Orexinergic\nactivity is in turn influenced by both central and peripheral sig-\nnals, with glucose and leptin exerting inhibitory effects, whereas\nghrelin promotes further activation. Furthermore, orexin neurons\nhave dense projections to the dopaminergic ventrotegmental area\nand nucleus accumbens, which are involved in the hedonic control\nof food intake, and thus orexin may serve as an interface between\nmetabolic and motivational systems with motor outputs to\nmodulate food intake (58). A profound impact of sleep loss on\nappetite regulation should therefore be expected when consid-\nering the associations of these systems. Although peripheral\nlevels of circulating orexin may not be representative of central\norexinergic activity, they would nonetheless be an interesting\nexploratory outcome measure in studies involving manipulations\nof sleep behavior. Of note, in a 2005 study from Japan, plasma\norexin levels were found to decrease with the severity of ob-\nstructive sleep apnea and to increase after treatment with con-\ntinuous positive airway pressure (63), suggesting that peripheral\norexin levels may track daytime alertness.\nSome of the alterations that have been observed in conditions\nof sleep loss, such as elevated sympatho-adrenal activity should\nbe associated with increased, rather than decreased, energy ex-\npenditure. Although extreme sleep deprivation in rodent models\nresults in weight loss despite increased caloric intake, this does\nnot seem to be the case in humans, in whom the stimulation of\nfood intake seems to be excessive in relation to the energy\ndemands of extended wakefulness under comfortable sedentary\nconditions. A recent study quantified the caloric requirement of\nPercent change from well rested condition\n*\n** **\n**\n* *\n*\n*\n5 night of 4 hr bedtimes\nwith partly preserved SWS\n3 nights of SWS\nsuppression without\nchange in sleep duration\nGlucose\nTolerance\nAcute Insulin\nResponse to\nGlucose\nGlucose\nEffectiveness\nInsulin\nSensitivity\nDisposition\nIndex\nFig. 3.

The large body of epidemiologic\nevidence linking short sleep duration and obesity suggests that in\nhumans, the increase in energy intake resulting from sleep re-\nstriction exceeds the modest increase in energy needed to sustain\nextended wakefulness.\nQuantitative Methods to Assess the Impact of Bedtime\nRestriction on the Cross-Talk Between Brain and Peripheral\nMetabolism\nLaboratory studies in human volunteers are generally limited by\na relatively small sample size (10\u00ad20 subjects) but have the ad-\nvantage of rigorously imposing different sleep conditions (nor-\nmal bedtimes, restricted bedtimes, and extended bedtimes) and\nallowing for a multi-level assessment of components of energy\nbalance and glucose metabolism. A few studies involving ex-\nperimental manipulation of sleep quality without change in sleep\nduration have also been conducted (65, 66). Typically, the par-\nticipants are young healthy lean volunteers, caloric intake is\nrigorously controlled, and sedentary conditions are enforced to\ncontrol for activity levels. Each sleep condition involves 2\u00ad15 d,\nwith stringently controlled bedtimes and light\u00addark cycles. In our\nlaboratory the center of the bedtime period is kept constant, and\nlight exposure is reduced in the evening and morning to avoid a\nshift of circadian phase. Within-subject comparisons can be made\nbetween conditions; therefore, any alterations observed are most\nlikely due to the experimental intervention instead of other con-\nfounding factor(s). Moreover, the amount of sleep (hours per\nnight and length of restriction) can be carefully managed in the\nlaboratory setting; sleep is recorded nightly by polysomnography.\nDuring each sleep condition, participants complete questionnaires\nabout mood, subjective sleepiness, alertness, hunger, and appetite\nmultiple times per day. Each sleep condition involves at least one\n24-h period when blood is frequently sampled, which allows for\nprofiles of circulating peptides including leptin, ghrelin, glucose,\ninsulin, and C-peptide (a marker of insulin secretion), cortisol, and\ngrowth hormone. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests (ivGTT) are\nconducted to examine glucose tolerance (kg, rate of decrease of\nglucose levels after glucose injection), glucose effectiveness (Sg,\na marker of non\u00adinsulin-dependent glucose utilization and there-\nfore an indirect measure of brain glucose metabolism), insulin\nsensitivity (SI, which quantifies the amount of insulin needed to\nmetabolize a given amount of glucose), acute insulin response to\nglucose (AIRg, the acute insulin response to glucose in the first 20\nmin after glucose injection), and the disposition index (a validated\nmarker of diabetes risk; DI = SI \u00d7 AIRg). The response to oral\nglucose, which involves the gastrointestinal tract and the so-called\nincretin effect, may be assessed on a separate day.\nAlthough these studies allow for thorough evaluation of alter-\nations produced by sleep restriction, translating these results to\nreal-life conditions is not straightforward.

Caloric intake was exclusively administered via a constant glucose infusion. Comparisons between the two sleep con-\nditions were performed using the Wilcoxon test for matched pairs; leptin decrease 18% (P = 0.04) and ghrelin increase 28% (P < 0.04). Correlation of the\nchange in hunger ratings and the ghrelin/leptin ratio were calculated using the Spearman rank test. Values were calculated using data from 4 h in bed minus\nthe value obtained after 10 h in bed. The calculated value was negative when the variable measured after 10 h in bed was higher than that measured after 4 h\nin bed.

Time spent asleep in each condition was as follows; 3 h 48 min in 4-h bedtime condition, 6 h 52 min in 8-h bed condition, and 8 h 52 min in\nthe 12-h condition. Note that the characteristics of the 24-h leptin profile (amplitude, nocturnal maximum, and overall mean) increased from the 4-h to the\n12-h bedtime condition. Dark bars denote sleep periods.\nstudies of sleep restriction are generally limited in duration and\nthus may not fully mimic changes in appetite and metabolism\nproduced by more chronic partial sleep loss. The stress of sleep\nloss under the demands of normal life conditions, including pro-\nfessional and social demands, is also not replicated by laboratory\nconditions. Furthermore, although cross-sectional and pro-\nspective studies have reported associations between shortened\nsleep duration and increased weight irrespective of sex differ-\nences, the vast majority of laboratory studies in both humans\nand animals have only been conducted on males. Thus, further\nexamination of potential sex differences with regard to this re-\nlationship is necessary.\nIn the remainder of this article, we summarize the methodology\nand findings of three laboratory studies examining the metabolic\nimpact of reduced sleep duration or quality. The protocol design\nof each study is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2 A\u00adC.\nMethodology and Findings of Previous Laboratory Studies\nThe first controlled study to examine the effect of sleep re-\nstriction on metabolic and endocrine function involved 11\nhealthy young men who were allowed 8 h in bed for three nights\n(baseline), restricted to 4 h in bed for six nights (sleep debt),\nfollowed by 12 h in bed for seven nights (sleep recovery) (49).\nThe protocol is shown in Fig. 2A. During the last 2 d of each\nexperimental condition, the participants were given identical\ncarbohydrate-rich meals and were subjected to bed rest while an\nivGTT was conducted, followed by a 24-h period of frequent\nblood sampling. Sleep restriction was successful in that the mean\ntotal sleep time during the period of sleep debt was 3 h and 49\nmin in comparison with the 9 h and 3 min attained during the\nperiod of sleep recovery. The proportion of slow-wave sleep\n[stages III and IV of non-REM (rapid eye movement) sleep] was\nhigher during the sleep-debt conditions in comparison with\nbaseline and sleep recovery, revealing an increased pressure for\nslow-wave sleep. However, the state of sleep debt was primarily\ncharacterized by a loss of REM sleep, which was reduced from\nz90 min at baseline to 40 min during the last two short nights.\nAfter the period of sleep restriction, glucose and insulin responses\nto the ivGTT and breakfast were consistent with an impairment\nof carbohydrate tolerance consistent with a prediabetic state. As\nillustrated in Fig. 3 (Upper), the ivGTT revealed 40% lower glu-\ncose clearance, a 25\u00ad30% reduction in glucose effectiveness and\nin insulin sensitivity, and a disposition index 40% lower in the\nsleep-restricted than in the sleep-extension condition (49, 67).\nFindings of decreased insulin sensitivity without adequate com-\npensation by increased insulin release have been replicated in\nother studies of sleep restriction (55, 68). In the initial \"sleep debt\nstudy,\" postbreakfast homeostatic model assessment values (a\nmarker of insulin resistance) increased 56% in the sleep-debt\ncondition compared with sleep extension, owing to elevated glu-\ncose levels in response to breakfast despite the fact that insulin\nlevels also tended to be higher. Evening cortisol and sympathetic\nnervous system activation were increased; both are risk factors for\nthe development of insulin resistance and obesity. The 24-h\nprofile of blood constituents revealed that leptin levels are par-\nticularly sensitive to sleep duration (45), confirming an early re-\nport (69). Mean leptin levels were 19% lower in the sleep-debt vs.\nsleep-extension condition and intermediate with 8-h bedtimes\n(Fig. 4, Lower). Further, both the nocturnal acrophase and am-\nplitude of the diurnal variation of leptin were decreased (26%\nand 20%, respectively). Interestingly, these changes occurred\ndespite similar caloric intake, activity, and without changes in\nBMI (45). These observed leptin concentrations are somewhat\nlarger than those observed in young adults after 3 d of dietary\nrestriction by z900 kcal/d (70). Thus, not only does sleep debt\nalter metabolic systems promoting diabetes risk, but leptin seems\nto be signaling a state of caloric deficit during the period of sleep\ndebt, potentially leading to hyperphagia.\nIn a subsequent randomized cross-over study (Fig. 2B), de-\nveloped in part to control for putative order effects in the \"sleep\ndebt\" study, metabolic parameters were examined after two\nnights of either 4 or 10 h in bed (54). Hormonal findings perti-\nnent to appetite regulation are illustrated in Fig. 4 (Upper).\nConsistent with the seminal study, sleep restriction was associ-\nated with decreased leptin concentration, even though meals\nwere replaced by constant glucose infusion. Furthermore, this\nstudy revealed a concomitant increase in the orexigenic factor\nghrelin (24%), along with increased hunger and appetite ratings\n(24% and 23%, respectively) in the short-sleep condition com-\npared with the well-rested condition (54). Interestingly, appetite\nratings tended to be greatest for carbohydrate-rich, calorie-dense\nfoods. The change in the ghrelin/leptin ratio between the two\nexperimental conditions was significantly and positively corre-\nlated with changes in hunger ratings, suggesting that sleep re-\nstriction-induced alterations in these hormones may, in part, be\ndriving observed increases in hunger ratings. These results are\nconsistent with findings from two population-based studies that\nhave also reported associations between short sleep duration,\nleptin, and ghrelin levels consistent with an up-regulation of ap-\npetite (71, 72). Moreover, these associations were independent\nof BMI and other possible confounding factors. Thus, sleep re-\nstriction or partial chronic sleep loss produces modifications in the\nprofile of appetite-regulating hormones, favoring hyperphagia.\nIn a more recent study of the metabolic impact of experi-\nmental reductions of sleep quality (65), suppression of slow-wave\nactivity (non-REM stages III and IV) was accomplished without\naltering total sleep time for three consecutive nights (Fig. 2C). A\ncontrol condition of normal undisturbed sleep with 8.5 h in bed\nwas presented in a randomized cross-over design. As summa-\nrized in Fig. 3 (Lower), metabolic alterations qualitatively similar\nto those observed after reductions in sleep duration emerged\n(65). In this study, slow-wave suppression was achieved with\nacoustic stimulation; as soon as slow-waves were identified on\nthe EEG recording, a sound was sent to amplifiers on both sides\nof the subject's bed to elicit a microarousal and subsequent\nsuppression of slow-wave activity. This resulted in an increase in\nthe lighter sleep stages, stages I and II, without changing total\nsleep time or the amount of REM sleep. After three nights of\nslow-wave sleep suppression, insulin sensitivity, glucose toler-\nance, and the disposition index decreased compared with base-\ntypical of individuals who have impaired glucose tolerance and\nare at risk for developing frank diabetes. Notably, the magnitude\nof the changes for both insulin sensitivity and acute insulin re-\nsponse to glucose were correlated with the decreases in slow-\nwave sleep (65). Similar to the previous studies, elevated cardiac\nsympathetic nervous activity was apparent after 3 d of slow-wave\nsuppression. Selective suppression of slow-wave activity thus\nproduces clear reductions in glucose tolerance and increases in\nmarkers of diabetes risk. Therefore, it seems that not only the\nduration of sleep but also the quality of sleep is important for\nmetabolic function. Consistent with this notion, an independent\nstudy of sleep fragmentation across all stages (which, however,\nled to a greater decrease of slow-wave sleep than of other sleep\nstages) obtained similar findings as in the study of selective sleep\nsuppression (66). Considering that there are marked age-related\nchanges in sleep quality, particularly reductions in slow-wave\nactivity, it is possible that the sleep disturbances of normal aging\nmay also play a role in the increased diabetes risk in older\npopulations. In contrast, a current ongoing clinical trial may\noffer interesting insight into the association between sleep du-\nration and BMI. The authors are examining whether extending\nsleep duration and/or quality may positively affect body weight\n(i.e., decrease in overweight individuals), although findings have\nyet to be reported (73).\nConclusions\nAs rates of overweight and obesity continue to increase, chronic\npartial sleep loss and poor sleep quality have also become en-\ndemic conditions. A growing body of epidemiologic and labora-\ntory evidence suggests that the behavior of bedtime curtailment\nmay be contributing to the epidemics of obesity and type II di-\nabetes. Whereas epidemiologic studies have revealed an associ-\nation between short sleep times and increased BMI and increased\ndiabetes risk, controlled laboratory studies are able to demon-\nstrate a causal relationship between bedtime restriction and met-\nabolic alterations. Sleep restriction leads to increases in hunger and\nappetite ratings, along with modifications in hormonal profiles--\nlower leptin and higher ghrelin levels--that favor hyperphagia.\nMoreover, a state of sleep debt causes disturbances in glucose\nregulation, potentially leading to increased risk for developing\ntype II diabetes. Similarly, experimental reduction of sleep quality\nwithout change of sleep duration has also been shown to be as-\nsociated with impairment of glucose tolerance. These findings\nhave important implications for public health and well being.\nIncreased awareness of the deleterious effects of chronic partial\nsleep loss and poor sleep quality may be important in regulating\nthe prevalence of overweight, obesity, and associated adverse\nhealth outcomes.\n"
