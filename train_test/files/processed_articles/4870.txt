The title, year of publication, number of citations, journal, anatomic\nfocus, subspecialty, evidence level, city, institution and author were recorded.\nResults: The top 50 articles had 29\u00ad122 citations and were published in 11 English-language\njournals; most (32) were published in the 2000s. The journal Spine had the largest number of\narticles and The Lancet had the highest impact factor. The lumber spine was the most discussed\nanatomic area (18). Degenerative spine disease was the most common subspecialty topic (22).\nMost articles were clinical studies (29); the others were basic research (21). Level IV was the most\ncommon evidence level (17).\nConclusions: This list indicates the most influential articles from mainland China in the global\nspine research community. Identification of these articles provides insights into the trends in spine\ncare in mainland China and the historical contributions of researchers from mainland China to the\ninternational spine research field.\n",

These factors have led to substan-\ntial biomedical developments1\u00ad5 and recent\nimprovements in spine care in mainland\nChina.6,7 In addition, the country has the\nlargest number of orthopedic surgeons in the\nworld.8 Therefore, mainland China is an\nimportant leader in the field of spine\nresearch from this region has yet to be\nstudied.\nMultiple methods are used to assess the\nsignificance of medical studies. The citation\nof a previous paper indicates the importance\nof the previous study to the current article.\nThe importance of a study is often assessed\nusing citation analysis.12\u00ad14 The number of\ncitations is a marker of the influence of an\narticle and offers a reliable method to rank\narticles. The larger an article's citation his-\ntory, the more valuable the article is to its\nWeb of Science is an important database\nthat provides citation metrics and other\nacademic impact information. This platform\nhas been widely used to analyze the most-\ncited articles in various medical fields.17\u00ad33\nexamine the most-cited articles in the spine\nresearch field,34 permitting a deeper under-\nstanding of the characteristics of influential\npapers. However, this previous study did not\ninclude any Chinese spine articles.34\nMoreover, to the best of our knowledge,\nthere are no analyses of the top-cited spine\npapers from mainland China, indicating\nthat the contribution of Chinese spine sur-\ngeons and researchers to the global spine\nresearch community has not been ade-\nquately investigated. Therefore, this study\naimed to identify the 50 top-cited spine\npapers originating from mainland China,\nto analyze their main characteristics and to\nprovide a unique insight into mainland\nChina's most important contributions to\nthe spine research field.\nMaterials and methods\nThe citation search was performed on\ndatabase (Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania), which has been used in pre-\n27 spine-related journals were included in\nthe literature search (Table 1).

These 27 journals regu-\nlarly publish articles about spine research.\nThe inclusion criteria of this study were\n(1) spine-related articles; (2) from mainland\nChina; and (3) ranked in the top 50 papers\naccording to the number of citations. Based\narticles from these 27 journals were ordered\nby number of citations. To exclude papers\nnot from mainland China, ``Peoples R\nChina'' was selected in the record field\n``Countries/territories.'' Articles that lacked\na primary or reprint address in mainland\nChina were excluded. This ensured that\narticles with one or more Chinese co-authors\nbut that were not from mainland China were\nnot included.\nThe 50 top-cited spine papers from main-\nland China were included in this study. The\ntitle, year of publication, number of cit-\nations, journal, anatomic focus, subspeci-\nalty, level of evidence, city, institution and\nauthor were recorded and analyzed.\nResults\nThe top 50 articles and their citations are\nTable 2.

One of the main reasons for this is\nthat English is the most common language\nof influential articles in the field of spine\nresearch and other orthopedic subspecial-\nthat Chinese authors experience a language\nbarrier that results in fewer spine research\npublications from China than from Western\ncountries.\nThe 50 top-cited papers were reported in\n11 journals. Among them, Spine published\nthe greatest number of papers. The first four\njournals published nearly three-quarters of\nthe total number of articles: Spine, European\nSpine Journal, Clinical Orthopaedics and\nRelated Research, and Journal of\nNeurosurgery: Spine. Three of these are\nsubspecialty spine journals. This may indi-\ncate that the influential articles are mainly\npublished in subspecialty spine journals.\nMoreover, previous studies have suggested\nthat impact factor should be the most\nimportant indicator of article citations, and\nmany of the most-cited papers have been\npublished in high-impact factor publica-\ndo not support this. The Lancet, which has\nonly one paper. Spine, which has a lower\nimpact factor (2.297), published the largest\nnumber of papers (n \u00bc 23). This may\nindicate that citations are not always\naffected by impact factor. This has been\nsuggested by previous researchers20,34 and\nindicates the importance of considering sev-\neral factors when investigating citations in\nAuthors from 12 cities were responsible\nfor the 50 top-cited articles. Beijing ranked\n1st, and Shanghai ranked 2nd, suggesting\nthat Beijing and Shanghai play an important\nrole in Chinese spine research. This can be\nattributed to the large number of spine\nsurgeons and researchers and adequate\nfinancial research funds in these cities.16,29\nOf the top 50 studies, clinical studies were\nmore popular than basic research. This\nfinding is consistent with previous study\nfindings on global spine research.34\nHowever, the proportion of clinical stu-\ndies/basic research in mainland China is\nversus 81/19, respectively). This suggests the\nneed to improve Chinese spine-related clin-\nical research. One previous study found a\nrelatively greater number of basic research\nstudies in current Chinese clinical research.2\nThere are several possible reasons for this\nphenomenon. Clinical studies are very com-\nplicated and require long-term intervention\nand follow-ups. Mainland China has a large\nnumber of patients with spine-related prob-\nlems and this could facilitate recruitment of\ngreater numbers of patients in clinical\nstudies. However, mainland China lacks a\nhigh-quality healthcare system equal to that\nin developed countries.9 Therefore, the\nlower quality of health care in mainland\nChina may hinder patient participation in\nclinical studies. In addition, insufficient\nresearch funds and a lack of available time\nhave resulted in fewer clinical studies in\nmainland China.2,96 However, these disad-\nvantages may be reduced in the Chinese\nspine research field. Medical system reforms,\nincreased experience in conducting clinical\nstudies and greater investment in research is\nlikely to improve research in mainland\nSome limitations of this study should be\nnoted. First, we selected spine-related jour-\nnals based on previous research.34 These\njournals do not include all spine articles,\nbecause some basic research journals and\ngeneral journals also publish spine-related\narticles. However, no search strategy can\nidentify all spine articles. Generally, the\narticles published in journals not indexed\nin this study are likely to have fewer cit-\nations than those that we indexed.34 Second,\nthis was a cross-sectional study design with a\nsingle time point. The rankings identified\nmay change if the study is replicated in the\nfuture.\nConclusion\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nbibliometric analysis of the most-cited spine\narticles from mainland China. The study\nfindings indicate an increase in the number\nof influential papers published by the\nChinese spine research community in\nrecent years. The present study identifies\nthe most influential Chinese articles in\nglobal spine research, provides a general\npicture of Chinese historical contributions\nto the global spine research community and\nillustrates trends in spine care in mainland\nChina. We believe that this study will help\nsurgeons, researchers and managers to rec-\nognize the main characteristics of Chinese\nspine research and will form the basis of\nfuture high-impact studies.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by the National\nNatural Science Foundation of China\nReferences\n1.
