Double immunofluorescence stainings were performed\nto investigate co-localisation of different cell types in the hepatic progenitor cell (HPC) niche.\nResults HPCs, Kupffer cells, myofibroblasts and laminin deposition were observed in the liver samples of FHL,\nalthough with variability in the expression and positivity of the different immunostainings between different samples.\nWhen compared with the unaffected cats where K19 positivity and minimal -SMA and laminin positivity were seen\nmainly in the portal area, in the majority of FHL samples K19 and -SMA-positive cells and laminin positivity were seen\nalso in the periportal and parenchymatous area. MAC387-positive cells were present throughout the parenchyma.\nConclusions and relevance This is a preliminary morphological study to describe the activation and co-localisation\nof components of the HPC niche in FHL. Although the HPC niche in FHL resembles that described in hepatopathies\nin dogs and in feline lymphocytic cholangitis, the expression of K19, -SMA, MAC387 and lamin is more variable\nin FHL, and a common pattern of activation could not be established. Nevertheless, when HPCs were activated, a\nspatial association between HPCs and their niche could be demonstrated.\nDepartment of Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals,\nFaculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The\nNetherlands\nDepartment of Pathobiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine\nand Veterinary Pathology Diagnostic Centre, Utrecht University,\nUtrecht, The Netherlands\nEvidensia Dierenziekenhuis Nunspeet, Nunspeet, The\nNetherlands\nIntercept Pharmaceuticals, Gouda, The Netherlands\nCorresponding author:\nChiara Valtolina DVM, Dipl ACVECC, Dipl ECVECC, Department\nof Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals, Faculty of Veterinary\nNetherlands\nEmail: c.valtolina@uu.nl\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery\nMature liver cells, ie, hepatocytes and cholangiocytes,\nhave a remarkable capacity to proliferate and restore\nliver function in homeostasis and in response to injury.6\u00ad8\nThree decades ago `the streaming liver hypothesis' was\nproposed based on pulse-chase experiments: peripor-\ntally derived hepatocytes migrate along the central vein\nto the hepatic vein axis.9 Recent cell-tracing experiments\ndemonstrated a population of proliferating and self-\nrenewing cells adjacent to the central vein in the liver\nlobule. These cells seem to be able to replace all hepato-\ncytes in the liver lobule during homeostatic renewal.10\nThese experiments helped the understanding of liver\nregeneration and the importance of specific hepatic\nstem- or progenitor cells (HPCs), as recently reviewed.11,12\nIrrespective of the origin of HPCs, once the ability of\nhepatocytes to restore liver mass and function is\nexhausted or impaired, HPCs become activated, as has\nbeen described for several species.8,13\u00ad18 These quiescent\nHPCs reside in the smallest branches of the biliary tract,\nalso known as the canal of Hering, and are recognised by\ntheir morphological appearance, portal location, and\nexpression of specific markers, such as cytokeratin 7 (K7)\nerate and their expansion results in the formation of his-\ntological structures known as ductular reactions, also\nknown as bile duct proliferation.14\nfirst study that reported on progenitor cells in healthy\ntor cells were described as small, periportally located\ncells positive for K7, with a morphology and location\nidentical to resident HPCs located in the canal of Hering,\nidentified the presence of ductular structures (ductular\nreaction) in different types of feline liver disease (acute\nhepatitis, neutrophilic and lymphocityc cholangitis and\nlipidosis), and characterised their histological and phe-\nnotypical features similarly to what has been described\ndescription of the ductular reaction does not further\nimplicate the activation and co-localisation of the HPCs\nThe balance between HPC self-renewal, proliferation\nand differentiation is determined by the interaction\nbetween the cells and stroma present in the microenvi-\nronment, ie, the `HPC niche'.30\u00ad32 In rodent models,\nhumans and dogs, important cellular components in this\nniche include HPCs, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), their\ndifferentiated counterparts, alpha-smooth muscle actin\n(-SMA)-positive myofibroblasts and macrophages/\nKupffer cells with laminin as the main stromal compo-\nand maintenance of the progenitor phenotype. Once the\nHPCs have left the laminin-enveloped niche, they can\ndifferentiate into a hepatocyte phenotype.34\nIn humans and dogs the ductular reaction and the\ndegree of HPC and its niche activation is directly related\nof hepatocyte loss, the amount of inflammation and the\nextent of fibrosis, and it is seen in diseases like acute\nhepatitis, chronic hepatitis, biliary disease and hepatic\nIn a recent publication, the remodelling and activa-\ntion of the HPCs and their niche was described in feline\nlymphocytic cholangitis.43 The characteristics of the\nHPCs and their niche in feline lymphocytic cholangitis\nshare similarities to the HPCs and their niche in scleros-\ning cholangitis in human medicine.\nIn human and rodent models of non-alcoholic fatty\nliver disease (NAFLD) steatosis is sufficient to inhibit\nreplication of mature hepatocytes and to trigger the acti-\nvation of HPCs.17,18 There is growing evidence that stea-\ntosis per se is associated with the development of\nsteatohepatitis and fibrosis, and should not be consid-\nered just an innocent bystander in liver disease.44\u00ad46\nTo our knowledge, there is no literature available for\ncats on the changes of the HPCs and their niche in FHL.\nTherefore, the aim of this study was to describe the cel-\nlular and stromal pattern of the HPC niche in FHL, with\nemphasis on MAC387-positive Kupffer cells, -SMA-\npositive myofibroblasts and the important extracellular\nmatrix component laminin. To substantiate the immuno-\nhistochemical data we further used double immunofluo-\nrescence to investigate possible co-localisations of the\nvarious cell types within the HPC niche.\nMaterials and methods\nSamples of diseased livers were obtained from cats sub-\nmitted for routine post-mortem examination. Normal\nlivers from healthy cats were obtained from fresh cadav-\ners of non-liver-related studies as required under the\nUniversity 3R policy. Projects were approved by the\nAnimal Welfare Committee on Experimental Animal\nUse, as required by Dutch legislation.\nSeven liver specimens (formalin-fixed and paraffin-\nembedded) with a histological diagnosis of FHL were\nselected from the archives of the Department of\nPathobiology of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,\nUtrecht University, The Netherlands. The seven FHL sam-\nples demonstrated a severe degree of lipidosis (>70% of\nhepatocytes involved), based on histological evaluation\nperformed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist\n(GCMG). In one sample extensive lipidosis coincided with\na histological diagnosis of peracute hepatitis. No other\nliver comorbidities were present in the six other FHL sam-\nples. Diagnoses were based on criteria as reported previ-\nously by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association.47\nTissue samples from three healthy cats were taken\npost-mortem and processed similar to the FHL samples.\nSections (3 m) of all samples were cut for haematoxylin\nValtolina et al 3\nand eosin and immunohistochemical and immunofluo-\nrescence staining. The samples were confirmed histolog-\nically normal by the same board-certified veterinary\npathologist (GCMG).\nImmunohistochemistry\nAll FHL and control samples were examined immuno-\nhistochemically for the expression of K19 (marker of bile\nduct and progenitor cells),27 MAC387 (myelomonocytic\nantigen; marker of infiltrated and resident mac-\nrophages),22,48 -SMA (marker of activated hepatic stel-\nlate cells/myofibroblasts),27,34 laminin (extracellular\nmatrix component and part of the HPC niche)34 and Ki67\n(proliferation marker),23 to characterise the HPC niche in\ncats (Table 1).\nThe immunohistochemical procedure was per-\nformed as described previously.23,49 Briefly, sections\nwere deparaffinised and rehydrated in xylene and a\ngraded alcohol series, respectively. After antigen\nretrieval, endogenous peroxidase was inhibited with a\nready-to-use peroxidase block (Dako). Sections were\nblocked with 10% normal goat serum and the primary\nantibody was diluted in antibody diluent (Dako) and\nincubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at\n4\u00b0C, depending on the marker (Table 1). EnVision\nhorseradish peroxidase-labelled secondary antibodies\n(anti-rabbit or anti-mouse; Dako) were used and\n3,3'-diaminobenzidine was used as the substrate for\nvisualisation. Sections were counterstained with\nhaematoxylin. As a negative control, the primary anti-\nbody was omitted and the IgG1 isotypes served as\ninternal non-specific controls for each other. For wash-\ning steps PBS/Tween 0.1% was used.\nThe stainings for K19, Ki67, -SMA and laminin were\nscored by one operator at high (40\u00d7) magnification. Five\nrandom fields were observed for positively stained\nhepatocytes and myofibroblasts, and the number of pos-\nitive cells/fields were reported. Only the cells that\ndisplayed nuclei on the section were considered. A dis-\ntinction was made within initial scoring for portal,\nperiportal and parenchymal cell positivity for K19,\n-SMAand laminin. To perform a cell count for MAC387,\nImageJ was used, a Java-based image processing pro-\ngram from the National Institutes of Health. Images of a\nrepresentative slide were made using an Olympus\nColorviewIIIu digital camera and an Olympus BX41\nmicroscope. Cells that stained positive for MAC387 were\nreported as total cells per total area analysed (mm2) for\neach sample.\nDouble immunofluorescence staining\nTo evaluate the spatial relationship between mac-\nrophages, activated HSCs, laminin, and HPCs double\nimmunofluorescence staining was performed on three\nsamples of cats with FHL showing varying K19 positiv-\nity. The decision not to include double immunofluores-\ncence on healthy samples was related to the fact that the\npositivity to -SMA and laminin in healthy samples was\nalmost negligible and mainly seen around the portal\narea (bile ducts/blood vessel), as also described in previ-\nStaining was performed using the aforementioned\nmarkers for macrophages (MAC387), activated stellate\ncells (-SMA) and laminin. To detect HPCs, panCK, a\nbroad-spectrum cytokeratin and well-validated HPC\nmarker, was used (Table 1).50 Immunofluorescence\nstaining was performed as described for the immuno-\nhistochemical procedure. Sections were incubated with\nthe primary antibodies in a parallel approach overnight\nat 4\u00b0C. The secondary antibodies (goat\u00adanti-mouse\nInvitrogen) were applied 1:100, diluted in antibody dil-\nuent (Dako). Sections were counterstained using\nroom temperature, and mounted using Fluorsave. In the\nnegative controls the first antibody was omitted and\nreplaced with an aspecific isotype control.\nSlides were analysed with a Leica DMRE fluorescent\nmicroscope with Photometrics Coolsnap CCD digital\nphoto camera and CellB software (AnalySIS; Olympus).\nTable 1 Antibodies and processing characteristics as applied in the immunohistochemistry and double\nimmunofluorescence of liver samples of cats with hepatic lipidosis\nMarker Source IgG type Clone Antigen retrieval Incubation Company Product code Dilution\nMouse-derived antibodies were monoclonal, whereas the rabbit-derived ones were polyclonal\nK19 = keratin 19; Prot K = proteinase-K; O/N = over night; MAC387 = anti-macrophage antibody 387; -SMA = alpha-smooth muscle actin;\nRT = room temperature; LAM = laminin; Ki67 = proliferation marker; panCK = pancytokeratin, widespectrum cytokeratin marker\n4 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery\nResults\nImmunohistochemistry\nThe results of the immunohistochemical staining for\nnormal liver and FHL samples are summarised in Tables\n2 and 3, and Figure 1 depicts examples of each staining.\nNegative controls remained unstained, indicating a spe-\ncific signal for each antibody (data not shown).

No ductular reactions were\nobserved. Of the seven cats with lipidosis, four showed\nan increase in the number of K19-positive cells in the\n(peri)portal area and clusters of cells in the parenchymal\narea (Table 2; Figure 1).

In healthy\nlivers very few cells stained positive and mainly in the\nportal area, around bile ducts and in the smooth muscle\nof blood vessels (Table 2; Figure 1). In 4/7 FHL samples,\n-SMA expression was strongly increased in both the\nperiportal area and throughout the parenchyma. In 3/7\nFHL samples, -SMA-positive cells were increased both\nin the portal and periportal area when compared with\nthe unaffected samples.\nIn healthy livers variable amounts of MAC387-positive\ncells were found spread throughout the parenchyma as\nsingle cells with no clear spatial relationship with the\nportal areas (Table 3; Figure 1). All FHL samples also\ndemonstrated variable amounts of MAC387-positive\ncells. In these samples, the MAC387-positive cells\nformed clusters varying in number from 2\u00ad3 to 4\u00ad6 cells\nper cluster, mostly located in close proximity to the por-\ntal area.\nLaminin\nWeak laminin staining was observed in and around the\nportal areas in healthy livers (Table 3; Figure 1). Four of\nfive FHL samples showed an increase in laminin positiv-\nity in the periportal area, ceasing towards the central\nvein. The central areas in all samples were negative for\nlaminin. One FHL sample remained negative for the\nlaminin staining.\nKi67 positivity was minimal in healthy liver. Three FHL\nsamples showed a distinctive increase in Ki67-positve\ncells, whereas four remained negative (Table 3; Figure 1).\nTable 2 Keratin 19 (K19) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (-SMA)-positive cells and their distribution per portal area in\nfeline hepatic lipidosis and in unaffected liver samples\nSample Portal Periportal Parenchyma Relative size (mm2)\nCells were evaluated at high magnification (\u00d7 40) and their numbers are reported as cells/fields\nValtolina et al 5\nDouble immunofluorescence staining\nDouble immunofluorescence showed that -SMA and\nlaminin expression were increased and in close proxim-\nity to the panCK/K19-positive cells. Laminin strictly\n\nco-localised with HPCs, whereas -SMAwas also located\nat other histological sites. MAC387-positive clusters of\ncells were found adjacent to K19-positive cells (Figure 2).\nDiscussion\nThis study characterised the feline HPC niche by immu-\nnohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining in a\ncommon feline hepatic disease, FHL. The results of the\nstudy demonstrate that ductular reactions observed in\nthe feline HPC niche in FHL contain Kupffer cells, acti-\nvated HSCs (myofibroblasts) and the extracellular matrix\ncomponent laminin. This is comparable with other\nhepatopathies in humans and dogs, such as acute and\nchronic hepatitis, hepatobilary diseases and hepatic car-\nvation in feline lymphocytic cholangitis, a chronic feline\nhepatobiliary disease.43\nIn human, rat and murine models of impaired hepato-\ncyte replication in NAFLD, simple steatosis is enough to\ninhibit replication of mature hepatocytes and to trigger\nthe activation of HPCs.17,18 Owing to elevated levels of\nserum-free fatty acids and insulin resistance, lipotoxicity\nFigure 1 The activated feline hepatic progenitor cell (HPC) niche immunohistochemically stained for keratin 19 (K19), MAC387\n(macrophages), alpha-smooth muscle actin (-SMA; stellate cells), laminin (LAM) and Ki67 (hepatocyte regeneration).

Liver steatosis seems to affect the\ngravity and progression of more chronic liver disease.44\u00ad46\nAlthough a liver with steatosis is less protected against\ninflammation and fibrosis, only a small population of\npeople affected by liver steatosis will further develop\nHowever, we were unable to demonstrate a definite\npattern between the histopathological presence of lipido-\nsis and the activation of the HPCs or the upregulation of\nthe niche components in all cats with hepatic lipidosis.\nDifferent degrees of HPC activation in FHL were sug-\ngested by the variability in the expression and positivity\nof the different immunostainings in the different sam-\nples. Despite the presence of severe steatosis (>70% of\nhepatocytes affected), this might be explained by the fact\nthat hepatic lipidosis in cats often has an acute onset and\nprogression due to a negative energy balance resulting\nfrom a heterogeneous group of underlying diseases,\nwhich may have different secondary effects on the liver.\nIn the cases with only a minimal number of cells staining\npositive, the damage to the hepatocytes could have been\nminimal or not severe enough to induce hepatocyte\napoptosis/death and secondary activation of HPCs.\nNevertheless, when HPCs were activated, a spatial\nassociation between HPCs and their niche could be\ndemonstrated. The result of the double immunofluo-\nrescence in FHL cases with an enhanced number of pro-\ngenitor cells suggested that a relationship was present\nbetween the HPCs, Kupffer cells/macrophages and\nHSCs/myofibroblasts\nStellate cells/myofibroblasts are the main producers\nof extracellular matrix components in the liver and could\nbe responsible for the enhanced laminin deposition.34\nRecently, it has been suggested that the activated HPCs\nTable 3 Ki67, MAC387-positive cells and laminin-positive staining in feline hepatic lipidosis and in unaffected liver\nsamples\nF3 3 4022 Strong positivity in the portal area and mild periportal positivity\nF6 32 42,856 Strong positivity in the portal area and moderate parenchymal positivity\nFor Ki67, cells were evaluated at high magnification (\u00d7 40) and their numbers are reported as cells/fields; MAC387 was evaluated with ImageJ\nand reported as number of total cells per total area (mm2)\nFigure 2 Hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) co-localised with macrophages, stellate cells and laminin (LAM) in examples of feline\nhepatic lipidosis.

In situ hybridisation for laminin mRNA can resolve\nthis issue.\nThis is the first study to characterise the feline HPC\nniche, HPC activation and the relation of HPCs with\nFHL. The low number of FHL cases and the lack of lon-\ngitudinal samples limits the power of the study. Staining\ndifferences may have been affected by variations in fixa-\ntion and/or storage time. However, the quality control\nwith omission of the first antibody resulted in negative\nstaining for all antibodies that were used. Furthermore,\nthe staining patterns were not identical, despite the use\nof similar IgG isotypes and the same secondary antibody\nargues against aspecific staining patterns.\nWe did not use liver samples collected during life,\nbecause histological biopsies are not routinely taken in\ncats suspected to have hepatic lipidosis.1\u00ad3 High-quality\nbiopsies of sufficient size are therefore difficult to\nobtain.53 Furthermore, liver diseases in cats are often\nassociated with coagulation disturbances and haemor-\nserial histological liver biopsies for the evaluation of dis-\nease progression are difficult to obtain owing to the res-\nervations of veterinarians and the understandable\nreluctance of pet owners.52 In addition to this, histologi-\ncal liver biopsies are also not necessary for a diagnosis of\nFHL.3 Because of the absence of sequential sampling and\nthe descriptive nature of the immunohistochemistry, this\nstudy does not provide dynamic information and limits\nconclusions on cause\u00adeffect relationships. Despite these\nrestrictions, we were able to highlight some interesting\naspects of the HPCs and their niche in FHL.\nConclusions\nBased on this study the composition of the feline HPC\nniche in FHL and its observed cellular and stromal inter-\nactions resemble that of normal and diseased livers in\nother companion animals like dogs and in cats with lym-\nphocytic cholangitis. However, the feline HPC niche in\nFHL shows variability between cats regarding the\nexpression of K19, -SMA, MAC387 and laminin, and a\ncommon pattern of activation could not be established.\nNevertheless, when HPCs were activated, a co-localisa-\ntion between HPCs and their niche could be demon-\nstrated. It remains speculative whether this variation is\ncaused by the duration of lipidosis, variations in the\nunderlying disease or the effect of the therapeutic meas-\nures initiated by the referring clinician.\nConflict of interest The authors declared no potential con-\nflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/\nor publication of this article.\nFunding LCP receives grants form the Netherlands Organisa-\ntion for Health Research and Development (NWO ZON/MW\nReferences\n1 Armstrong PJ and Blanchard G.
