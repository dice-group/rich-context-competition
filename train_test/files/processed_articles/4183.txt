Tacit knowledge is practical knowledge embodied in experience, skills and\nknow-how which cannot be expressed in propositional form. It is, therefore, said to be\nexcluded from deliberative institutions which are based on verbal dialogue.\nThis problem of tacit knowledge has been argued to undermine deliberation as a\nprocess of social learning. As we will see, however, it actually creates more general\nand significant problems to both procedural and epistemic conceptions of deliberative\ndemocracy. The exclusion of tacit knowledge undermines equal participation and fair\nproceduralism by showing that deliberation necessarily excludes certain people's per-\nspectives, while it also undermines the ability of deliberation to make good and effective\ndecisions, by showing an important body of knowledge which deliberation will fail to\nutilize. This critique of deliberative democracy draws on Fredrick Hayek's (1948a,\n1948b, 2013) epistemic rejection of collective social coordination and defence of a\nmarket society. Unlike deliberation, the price mechanism is said to have the potential\nfor extralinguistic communication which can allow tacit knowledge to be utilized for\nsocial coordination. The problem of tacit knowledge is, therefore, taken to be an impor-\ntant reason for favouring a market society over one which gives a prominent role to\ndemocratic and particularly deliberative institutions.1\nThe purpose of this article is to defend deliberative democracy against the problems\nof tacit knowledge and to argue that it does not necessarily give clear reasons to favour\nmarket institutions. It also argues that this defence has significant implications for\ndeliberative democratic theory, and particularly for the forms of reason which delibera-\ntive democrats see as legitimate. The next section will discuss the problem of tacit\nknowledge and its challenge to deliberative democracy. It has previously been aimed\nonly at certain aspects of Habermasian deliberation; however, this article brings out its\nwider significance for both proceduralist and epistemic conceptions of deliberative\ndemocracy.2 The article will then argue that market approaches to tacit knowledge face\nsignificant limitations, before moving on to develop a defence of deliberative democracy\nitself. It will be argued that verbal deliberation can incorporate tacit forms of knowledge\nthrough the use of `trust in testimony'. By trusting the speech acts of others, deliberators\nare able to act on a speaker's knowledge even when it is not explicitly expressed. The\nlatter half of the article will then discuss the wider implications of this defence for\ndeliberative theory. The inclusion of tacit knowledge through trust in testimony will\nbe shown to create important problems for influential conceptions of deliberative democ-\nracy, such as Habermas, which are based on impersonal reason. Deliberation must\ninvolve not only impersonal forms of reasoning but also reasoning about credibility and\ntrust. The article will then end with a discussion of the different ways trust in testimony\noperates in deliberation, markets and everyday talk.\nDeliberation and the problem of tacit knowledge\nDeliberative democracy is an approach to democratic decision-making based on a rea-\nsoned dialogue. Unlike aggregative models of democracy, which focus on the summing\nup of given preferences through voting, deliberative democrats emphasize the role of\n2 Politics, Philosophy & Economics XX(X)\nRawls, 1996; Sunstein, 1991). Preferences are not taken as given to the democratic\nprocess but rather as evolving in relation to the decision-making procedures themselves.\nThrough discussion, preferences are not simply aggregated but informed and trans-\nformed in relation to each other. Although deliberation may end in a vote, theories of\ndeliberative democracy focus on the importance of a prior discussion and debate. In\nChambers (2003) words they are `talk-centric' as opposed to `vote-centric'. It involves a\nprocess of critical reflection in which preferences and opinions can be considered and\nchallenged, and alternative values and policies can be held up to scrutiny. Decisions are\nthen taken in relation to the outcome of this free and equal deliberation.\nInstitutions of deliberative democracy can take many different forms. On the one\nhand, they may involve the formal deliberations of legislative parliaments, or the struc-\ntured deliberation of citizens in mini-publics, citizen assemblies and consensus confer-\nences (Smith, 2009). Alternatively, deliberation can form the basis of a radical\nparticipatory economy where firms and economic planning are controlled on a demo-\ncratic basis (Devine, 2002). Recent work in deliberative democracy has also moved on to\nconceptualize deliberative systems, which involve the interconnected deliberation of\nmany different institutions within both government and civil society (Benson, forth-\nIt has been objected, however, that such models of democracy cannot account for tacit\nforms of knowledge. Mark Pennington (2003, 2011), in developing a Hayekian critique\nof deliberation, argues that theories of deliberative democracy give a privileged position\nto linguistic forms of communication which present them with significant epistemic\ntical and tacit forms of knowledge.4 Theoretical knowledge is an explicit, abstract or\nstatistical knowledge which can be expressed in propositional form, whereas tacit knowl-\nedge is non-explicit and includes practical skills and know-how.5 Tacit knowledge,\nunlike theoretical knowledge, cannot be communicated linguistically or statistically. It\ncannot be expressed propositionally but can only be learnt through participation in a\nsocial action or practice. Polanyi (1997) gives the example of our ability to recognize a\nface among thousands of others despite our inability to explain exactly how or why we\nare able to do so. Perhaps a better example, however, would be our inability to articulate\nand explain all the rules of grammar and language which we abide by in our everyday\nconversations.\nThe implication of tacit knowledge is that we `know more than we can tell' (Polanyi,\n1997: 136). Much of the knowledge we act on day to day we could not express even if\ncalled upon to do so. Take, for example, the knowledge needed for conducting many\noccupations. Such knowledge cannot be fully learnt simply by reading a manual, no\nmatter how detailed, but requires participation in that occupation itself. It requires\nlearning while doing. Although we cannot fully express it, the tacit knowledge we gain\nthrough experience is often vitally important to our understanding and ability to make\ndecisions in the complex social systems we occupy. It is also often very important to\npolitical decision-making and to public policy.\nTake, for instance, environmental policy. It is often recognized that environmental\npolicy can be greatly informed by the tacit knowledge of on-the-spot managers and local\ncommunities, who have a deep understanding of their environment (Fazey et al., 2005,\nstanding of an ecosystem through extended experience, living and interacting with it.\nThis understanding can allow them to recognize changes and emergent properties within\nthese systems and even form reliable predictions. Despite the depth of their knowledge,\nhowever, these individuals are often unable to articulate or explain how and why they\nknowledge include indigenous communities whose experiences and learning over gen-\nerations can greatly inform and benefit environmental management (Raymond et al.,\n2010). This knowledge is particularly important when dealing with complex ecosystems\nwhere theoretical scientific research is often absent or incomplete. Theoretical knowl-\nedge also makes generalized claims which may not hold for a particular context-specific\ndecision. Drawing on tacit knowledge alongside explicit knowledge can, therefore,\nbenefit the production of environmental policy. It can fill gaps in theoretical research\nand provide a specific understanding of particular ecosystems.6\nTacit knowledge is, in fact, inherent to social and intellectual practices. As Polanyi\nargues, and Hayek (1978) accepts, part of the information that a scientific expert has is\nbased on practical knowledge and skills which they have acquired through years of\nparticipating in their discipline. This know-how includes, for instance, the ability to\norganize, interpret and derive understanding from bodies of information. This knowl-\nedge cannot be taught to a student of science in a lecture or book but can only be acquired\nthrough their engagement in the practice of science itself. Scientific knowledge is,\nhowever, vital to policy areas such as energy, public health and the environment. Med-\nicine, chemistry, climatology, nuclear physics, biogenetics and many other bodies of\nscientific information are all highly relevant to policymaking, and all involve a tacit\ndimension.\nMany people, such as scientists, indigenous people, farmers, care workers, fishers and\ncivil servants, may all have specific practical knowledge because of their social roles\nwhich may be relevant to certain policy areas. However, Pennington (2003) argues that\nthe inarticulate nature of this knowledge means that deliberative institutions will fail to\nutilize it. Deliberative democracy bases decision-making on a verbal discussion, mean-\ning that its central form of communication is linguistic. Citizens, or their representatives,\nare to form a conception of the best policy purely on the bases of listening to, and\nparticipating in, verbal argument. Such communication, however, restricts the forms\nof knowledge which can be expressed. It is necessarily unable to articulate tacit knowl-\nedge because such knowledge is non-linguistic and cannot be communicated in proposi-\ntional form. The privileging of linguistic communication, therefore, ignores important\nkinds of non-explicit knowledge. The inarticulate nature of tacit knowledge means that it\nis necessarily excluded from deliberative decision-making based on verbal dialogue.\nPennington aims this critique at Habermasian theories of democracy and in particular\nthe role they give to deliberation as the process of social learning. By bringing people\ntogether in a forum, values can be exchanged and tested so that participants can learn\nfrom each other and have their own values informed and transformed as a result. For\n4 Politics, Philosophy & Economics XX(X)\nPennington, however, social learning must also account for tacit bodies of knowledge.\nLearning via conversation, although able to communicate explicit knowledge, will fail to\ninclude information which is by its nature inarticulate and can only be acquired through\nparticipation, observation and emulation. There are then epistemic limits to linguistic\nforms of learning which require that all information be articulated. Forms of social\nlearning, such as the market (discussed further below), which have a capacity for extra-\nlinguistic communication should, therefore, be favoured in order not to restrict the kind\nof knowledge which can be included.\nThe problem of tacit knowledge actually has much more general and significant\nproblems for both Habermas and deliberative democracy than those highlighted by\nPennington. First, issues of procedural fairness are also threatened by the exclusion of\npractical knowledge in deliberation. As proceduralists, Habermasians see deliberation as\nhaving to meet criteria such as full participation rights and equal voice. This appeal to\negalitarian decision-making is, however, undermined as the decision process itself dis-\nadvantages and excludes certain kinds of knowledge and therefore certain people's\nperspectives. People with relevant tacit knowledge are unable to share their knowledge\nin verbal decision-making. They are unable to articulate their perspective or their reason\nfor it and are therefore limited in their capacity to participate equally in collective\ndeliberation. Importantly, this challenges not just Habermasians but all deliberative\ndemocrats who require equality of voice and participation on grounds of procedural\nfairness (Cohen, 1989). The process of verbal decision-making itself disadvantages\ncertain people's knowledge and perspective and therefore limits their participation com-\npared to others. This problem becomes particularly pressing when the holders of tacit\nknowledge are from social groups which already face marginalization or oppression.\nIndigenous communities, for instance, not only have important tacit knowledge but are\noften the most adversely affected by environmental problems. Similarly, women or\nethnic minorities can have a unique understanding of social oppression which may also\ninvolve a tacit component. Such groups may be unable to fully express this knowledge\nand are, therefore, disadvantaged by verbal discussion. The problem of tacit knowledge,\ntherefore, undermines the egalitarian defence of deliberation as a process which gives all\nan equal opportunity to influence the outcome.\nSecond, the problem of tacit knowledge has epistemic implications for deliberative\ndemocracy. In Habermas' (1984) theory, for instance, deliberation is a process for testing\ncertain validity claims. Speech acts presuppose claims, such as to empirical truth or\nmoral rightness, which aim to gain acceptance. If they fail to gain acceptance in ordinary\nspeech, then they are shifted to a new level of discourse. Discourse is a special kind of\nspeech, conducted in an ideal speech situation, where all claims and assumptions within\nspeech acts are made explicit and are open to criticism.7 In his consensus theory, the truth\nor rightness of a proposition consists in the agreement of everyone within a discursive\nargument, where the reasons given must also able to convince all participants. However,\nthe linguistic nature of discourse limits the kinds of reasons which can be expressed.\nTacit knowledge cannot be expressed linguistically so cannot be given in support of any\nclaim. Reasons based on tacit knowledge cannot be given, no matter how idealized the\nspeech situation. This actually undermines the ideal speech-situation itself, as it requires\nthe realization of particular normative conditions; including the requirements of equal\nvoice and equal opportunity to effectively participate.8 The realization, or approximate\nrealization, of the conditions for an ideal speech-situation, is frustrated by inarticulate\nbodies of knowledge.\nAn alternative approach to deliberation which also has an important epistemic com-\nponent is epistemic democracy (Benson, forthcoming; Estlund, 2008; Landemore, 2013).\nEpistemic democrats differ from Habermas in that they take there to be procedure\nindependent standards by which democratic decisions can be judged. Broadly speaking,\nthey advocate deliberation based on its ability to communicate and utilize knowledge in\norder to arrive at rational, good or correct decisions, where rational, good and correct are\ndefined by some non-procedural standard. Collective deliberation is argued to be the best\nprocess to gather, transfer and generate relevant information for effective decision-\nmaking.9 The problem of tacit knowledge, however, underlines deliberation epistemic\npotential by pointing to a significant knowledge base which will be necessarily absent\nfrom its decision process. There will often be relevant tacit knowledge which can inform\npolicy but which is excluded from verbal deliberation, therefore, reducing the quality of\nits decisions. Deliberation will not, for example, be able to draw on the tacit knowledge\nof specialist scientists which could aid public policy. Epistemic democracy can only base\ndecisions on explicit forms of knowledge which reduces its epistemic potential.\nThe problem of tacit knowledge presents an important challenge to deliberative\ndemocracy from both proceduralist and epistemic perspectives. By prioritizing linguistic\nforms of communication, deliberative democracy privileges explicit knowledge at the\ncost of excluding tacit forms of knowledge. One may reply to this by arguing that\ndeliberation need not include tacit knowledge as deliberation is a process which can\nmake such knowledge explicit. Through deliberation, the assumptions and foundations\nof different claims can be examined in order that they can be made explicit. To an extent\nthis is true, and it is certainly one advantage that deliberation has over the market\napproaches considered in the next section. For example, it is observed that when envi-\nronmental managers talk with each other, they are able to recognize and articulate some\nthere are a couple of reasons why this will be limited. First, some of the knowledge that\npeople have, such as knowing how to ride a bike, may have an irreducible tacit compo-\nnent which cannot be made explicit even through extended conversation (Ryle, 1945\u00ad\n1946). Second, some tacit knowledge will be too complex for people to fully proposi-\ntionize it, especially under the time constraints of real-world deliberation, although it\nmay be theoretically possible. For instance, it may be theoretically possible to express all\nthe rules of language and grammar propositionally. However, this does not mean that I,\nthrough conversation with others, will be able to work out all the rules I tacitly follow\nwhen I speak. In fact, given the complexity of these rules, it is very unlikely that I will\never be able to do so. Similarly, an environmental manager may not be able to fully\npropositionize their knowledge of a complex ecosystem under the time constraints of\nactual deliberation, despite the fact that it may be conceptually possible to do so. So\nalthough deliberation may be able to make some practical knowledge explicit, it still\nneeds to show how it can include that knowledge which cannot be articulated if it is to\novercome the problem of tacit knowledge.\n6 Politics, Philosophy & Economics XX(X)\nThe market over the forum?\nknowledge to be not just a critique of deliberation but also a positive argument for market\ninstitutions. Markets are argued to have the capacity for extralinguistic communication\nin the form of market prices. Market participants act on their own knowledge and\nthrough acts of (or not) buying and selling products influence the formation of prices.\nThe knowledge upon which they act, whether it is explicit or tacit, is then communicated\nthroughout the economy as others adjust to changes in price signals. Individuals who act\non price changes will not be fully aware of the knowledge upon which they act. How-\never, this exact knowledge is not required. Prices give signals about the relative supply\nand demand of goods which allows people to adjust their actions without ever needing to\nknow the reasons behind any particular price change (Hayek, 1948b). As well as price\nsignals, free markets also allow greater opportunity for knowledge transfer through\nemulation, as people learn from the success or failure of others. This mechanism of\nemulation is also open to deliberative democracy. Deliberative institutions are able to\nlearn and copy one another, and the opportunity for this will increase with the level of\ndecentralization. However, this opportunity is argued to be greater in markets as a system\nof individual property rights expands the number of decision points and therefore the\nnumber of decisions from which to learn.11 Market institutions, unlike deliberative\ninstitutions, are therefore said to have the potential for extralinguistic communication\nwhich can utilize tacit knowledge.
