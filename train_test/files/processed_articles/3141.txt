    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: Factors in the practice environment, such as health information technology (IT) infrastructure, availability of other\nclinical resources, and financial incentives, may influence whether practices are able to successfully implement the patient-\ncentered medical home (PCMH) model and realize its benefits. This study investigates the impacts of those PCMH-related\nelements on primary care physicians' perception of quality of care.\nMethods: A multiple logistic regression model was estimated using the 2004 to 2005 CTS Physician Survey, a national sample of\nsalaried primary care physicians (n \u00bc 1733).\nResults: The patient-centered practice environment and availability of clinical resources increased physicians' perceived quality of\ncare. Although IT use for clinical information access did enhance physicians' ability to provide high quality of care, a similar positive\nimpact of IT use was not found for e-prescribing or the exchange of clinical patient information. Lack of resources was negatively\nassociated with physician perception of quality of care.\nConclusion: Since health IT is an important foundation of PCMH, patient-centered practices are more likely to have health IT in\nplace to support care delivery. However, despite its potential to enhance delivery of primary care, simply making health IT\navailable does not necessarily translate into physicians' perceptions that it enhances the quality of care they provide. It is critical\nfor health-care managers and policy makers to ensure that primary care physicians fully recognize and embrace the use of new\ntechnology to improve both the quality of care provided and the patient outcomes.\n",

Seidman1\n Keywords\nhealth information technology, patient-centered practice environment, primary care physicians\nCare that is responsive to individual patient values and needs1 is\ncentral to primary care in the United States and is a core com-\nponent of the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model\nthat has become the centerpiece of health care delivery reform.2,3\nStudies have found that provision of patient-centered care is\nassociated with higher patient engagement, satisfaction, and\nreduced health care costs.4,5 Despite these benefits, implement-\ning patient-centered care can be challenging for primary care\nteams, particularly within the context of the PCMH model.\nAdopting a team-based, patient-centered approach often requires\nsignificant changes to traditional patterns of interaction and can\nbe costly and time consuming for primary care practices.6,7\nFactors in the practice environment, such as health informa-\ntion technology (IT) infrastructure, availability of other clinical\nresources, and financial incentives, may influence whether\npractices are able to successfully implement the PCMH model\nand realize its benefits. Health IT has the potential to facilitate\npatient-centered care by improving care coordination and\nenhancing patient\u00adprovider communication.8,9 However,\ndespite significant growth in health IT infrastructure over the\nlast decade, primary care physicians do not sufficiently utilize\nhealth IT to ensure high-quality primary care.10,11 Although\n1 Graduate School of Public Health, San Diego State University, San Diego,\nCorresponding Author:\nJongDeuk Baek, Graduate School of Public Health, San Diego State University,\nEmail: jbaek@mail.sdsu.edu\nHealth Services Research and\nManagerial Epidemiology\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nhme.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page (http://www.uk.sagepub.com/aboutus/openaccess.htm).\nsome have shown that greater use of health IT can increase\nphysicians' ability to provide high-quality primary care in a\npatient-centered environment,12 full realization of its potential\nmay require a stronger perception that IT improves both the\nquality of care provided and the patient outcomes. This study\ninvestigates the impacts of the patient-centered practice envi-\nronment and health IT use on primary care physicians' per-\nceived confidence in providing high-quality primary care.\nThe comprehensive research framework shown in Figure 1\nillustrates how many PCMH-related elements are associated\nwith physicians' perception of quality of care.\nMethods\nTracking Study Physician Survey because it is the only large\nnational survey that includes measures such as practice policy,\nmedical care management, patient relationships, and physician\ncompensation.13 The sample consisted of salaried primary care\nphysicians, who have become more prevalent in primary care\ndelivery.14 A total of 1733 salaried primary care physicians,\nwho are board certified in family medicine, internal medicine,\nor pediatrics, were selected.\nStudy Variables\nTable 1 lists all variables included in this study. Appendix\nA provides the original survey questions from which these\nvariables were defined.\nConfidence in providing high-quality care. The outcome variable\nwas primary care physicians' self-assessed confidence in pro-\nviding high-quality care. Instead of a highly specific outcome\nmeasure that may be an unreliable or invalid proxy for actual\nquality, this study used perceived quality of care by primary\ncare physicians, who are the appropriate persons to make clin-\nical decisions for patients. The dependent variable for this\nanalysis is based on recoding a self-assessed measure (1:\nstrongly disagree to 5: strongly agree) into a dichotomous vari-\nable (strongly agree vs all other responses) to investigate\nwhether health IT contributes to the strongest perception of\nquality care. The distribution of data for the original variable\ndid not allow for robust estimation of additional intervals.\nPatient-centered practice environment. The patient-centered prac-\ntice environment was defined using 4 items specific to the\ninterpersonal dimension between doctors and patients15: (1)\nability to maintain a long-term relationship with patients, (2)\nspending enough time with patients during office visits, (3)\nfreedom to make clinical decisions in the best interest of\npatients, and (4) clinical freedom to make decisions that meet\npatients' needs. These 4 items are consistent with the widely\nendorsed PCMH definition as ``a model of care that strengthens\nthe clinician-patient relationship by replacing episodic care\nwith coordinated care and a long-term healing relationship,\np.2.''16 They were averaged into a single score for the empirical\nanalysis.\nHealth IT use. Three types of IT functionalities were selected\nthat represent the core of meaningful use in clinical prac-\ntice: clinical information access, e-prescribing, and\nFinancial incenves policy\na.

The IT use for clinical information\naccess was based on 4 survey items measuring whether\nphysicians (1) obtain treatment alternatives or guideline,\n(2) generate preventive service reminders, (3) access patient\nnotes and medication/problem lists, or (4) identify potential\ndrug interaction with other drugs, allergies, and other\npatient conditions. E-prescribing was defined as the use of\nIT systems to write a prescription regardless of the type of\nsystem or the organization's IT capacity and included the\nuse of IT to (1) obtain information on formularies or (2)\nwrite prescriptions. An additional dimension of IT use was\nwhether physicians exchanged patient information with (1)\nother physicians or (2) hospitals or laboratories. Separate\nvariables were created for each of these 3 health IT dimen-\nsions based on the number of IT functions used.\nResource/structural constraints and financial incentives. Other vari-\nables were created to control separately for constraints that may\ninfluence physician's perceived quality of care. These variables\ncaptured (1) the availability of supportive or referral resources,\n(2) the degree to which physicians consider their patients' out-\nof-pocket financial burden, and (3) constraints in prescribing\nmedications. Two additional variables measured the impact on\nquality of care of financial incentives aligned with quality or\nprofitability of the practice.17\nPhysician age, gender, race, practice type, practice area,\nforeign medical degree status, and the percentage of patients\nwhose primary language is not English were included in the\nmultiple logistic regression model to capture the independent\nimpact of these physician and practice characteristics on per-\nceived quality of care.\nTable 1.

Family/general practitioners were the most frequently\nreported specialty (39.7%), and the majority (83.5%) of physi-\ncians practiced in a large metropolitan area (Table 2).\nApproximately 38% of salaried primary care physicians\nwere strongly confident that they provide high-quality care.\nThe majority of physicians in the sample used some health\nIT, with 87.1% using it to access clinical information, 59.7%\nfor e-prescribing, and 76.3% for information exchange. Physi-\ncians generally believed their practice environment was\naligned with patient centeredness (mean \u00bc 3.89), yet also per-\nceived several significant constraints to their practice, includ-\ning the inability to refer patients for specialty services (87.5%\nreported many barriers). Over 60% of physicians also reported\nbasing practice decisions on the patient's financial burden and\nfacing constraints on ordering prescriptions (Table 3).\nLogistic regression results suggest that physicians practicing\nin a more patient-centered practice environment are more\nlikely to report providing high-quality care (odds ratio [OR]\ncompared to physicians who did not use any IT to access clin-\nical information, physicians who use 3 or 4 functions were\nmore likely to perceive that they provide high-quality care\nimpact of IT use on physicians' ability to provide high-quality\nof care was not found in e-prescribing or the exchange of\nclinical patient information. In fact, physicians who used both\ne-prescription functions were 39% less likely to be confident in\nproviding high-quality care compared to those who engaged in\nno e-prescribing IT functions.\nThe physician financial incentive variables were not statis-\ntically significant, suggesting that salaried primary care physi-\ncians may not be sensitive to reimbursement incentives in\nproviding high-quality care. Physicians who faced major con-\nstraints in support of their clinical decisions were less than half\nas likely to report providing high-quality care (OR \u00bc 0.49; 95%\nCI \u00bc 0.30-0.78). Among physician and practice characteristics,\nmale physicians were 30% more likely than female physicians,\nand internists were 35% less likely than pediatricians, to\nbelieve that they provided high-quality care.\nDiscussion\nDespite its documented benefits, a relatively small proportion\nof salaried primary care in the United States is delivered using a\npatient-centered approach.18-22 Greater adoption of a PCMH\napproach in primary care could lead to more emphasis on pro-\nvider partnerships, patient preferences, and communication,\nresulting in increased quality of care.23 Physician decisions are\nguided legally and ethically by the best interests of their\npatients, so their perceptions of how certain factors influence\ntheir ability to provide high-quality care are likely to be strong\npredictors of whether they are interested in changing practice\nbehaviors.\nThe impact of health IT on physicians' confidence in pro-\nviding quality of care was mixed in this study. The positive\nimpact of IT use to access clinical information on quality pri-\nmary care is consistent with previous literature.24,25 However,\nIT use for e-prescribing was negatively associated with high-\nquality primary care. Although e-prescribing could enhance\nmedication safety,26 physicians have been critical of its useful-\nness in providing safety alerts27 and are also concerned about\nTable 2.

Realizing the\nfull practice benefits of e-prescribing in primary care may\nrequire careful attention in the transition to an e-prescribing\nsystem to ensure that it is perceived as complementing a pri-\nmary care physicians' workflow instead of generating more\nTable 3.

Although we might expect physician age and\npractice setting to be associated with IT use, neither factor was\nestimated to have an independent impact even when each was\nincluded in the model separately to avoid possible correlation\nproblems. Although IT adoption in primary care has increased\nduring the last decade, recent data still indicate a lower use of\nhealth IT among primary care physicians.10,11 Our results have\nmanagerial implications for primary care practices planning to\nadopt or increase use of health IT systems. For example, access\nto clinical referral services was negatively associated with the\nperceived ability to provide high-quality care. Effective use of\nthese resources is critical to implementing a PCMH model of\nprimary care. This highlights the importance of aggressive and\nproactive attention by administrators to maximize access to\nthese resources and ensure that physicians are trained in their\nuse and understand how they contribute to both improving\npatient care and achieving the organization's mission.36\nSeveral data and design issues may limit generalization of\nthis study's results. First, Health maintenance organization\n(HMO) penetration in the health-care market was not controlled\nexplicitly.37 Although areas with greater HMO enrollment may\nbe more conducive to health IT use, the data did not permit\ninclusion of this factor. However, factors that may be indirectly\nrelated to HMO presence in markets, such as e-prescribing con-\nstraints and limitations in obtaining referral or clinical support\nservices, were included in the empirical analysis. Although this\nstudy focused on IT usage behaviors regardless of the exact prac-\ntice setting, there may have been a relationship between the type\nof practice setting and the availability of IT use. Similarly, pri-\nmary care physicians who did not use health IT may have faced\ndifferent practice policies or financial incentives compared to\nthose who made greater use of IT. An indirect attempt was made\nto control for these possible impacts by including practice-\nspecific structural and contextual factors. The duration of\nphysician IT experience might also promote a more positive per-\nception of the value of IT in delivery of quality care. Unfortu-\nnately, data on this factor were not available for this study. Given\nevidence of limited e-prescribing adoption by primary care phy-\nsicians prior to 2008 and38 the years of these data, only a minimal\nimpact on IT use would be expected. Finally, this study focused\non salaried primary care physicians, so the results do not neces-\nsarily hold for nonsalaried physicians or those in other specialties.\nConclusion\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes a number of provi-\nsions to promote PCMH and adoption of health IT in order to\nreduce costs and improve care quality and patient outcomes.39\nSince health IT is an important foundation of PCMH,40 patient-\ncentered practices are more likely to have health IT in place to\nsupport care delivery. However, despite the potential to\nenhance the patent-centered delivery of primary care, simply\nmaking health IT available does not necessarily translate into\nphysicians' perceptions that it enhances the quality of care they\nprovide. If physicians perceive that any dimension of health IT\ndoes not serve their (or their patient's) interests or fails to\ncontribute to providing high-quality care, they may tend not\nto use it optimally or simply refuse to use it at all.\nThe PCMH implementation significantly alters the care envi-\nronment and practice of medicine by primary care physicians. It\nis crucial for health-care executives and managers to address\nchallenges in PCMH transformation to ensure that physicians\nunderstand how to utilize health IT and recognize how it may\nimprove health-care quality and outcomes instead of believing\nthat it reduces their connection with patients and detracts from\ntheir ability to provide high-quality care. Providing more edu-\ncation for physicians on the benefits of PCMH practice and the\neffective use of health IT, including such strategies as identify-\ning physician champions, involving physicians in decision on\nPCMH transition, and effective change management that\nenhances organizational learning, may facilitate effective imple-\nmentation of patient-centered practice in primary care.\nSalaried practice environments tend to be those that are\nlarger where physicians may place a greater value on the avail-\nability of health IT. Even in these settings, the results of this\nstudy indicate that several dimensions of health IT did not\npositively impact the belief that using health IT strengthens\ntheir ability to provide high-quality care. Physicians in differ-\nent settings may have even greater skepticism about the value\nof health IT insofar as it affects their potential for better patient\nrelationships and the ability to provide quality care and may\nalso dramatically increase their costs and time commitment to\nlearn and use the technology. Given both the challenge for\ntechnology adoption in small primary care practices and the\nfinancial incentives to integrate more technology through\nMeaningful Use and policies or incentives included in the\nACA, it is critical for health-care managers and policy makers\nto ensure that primary care physicians fully recognize and\nembrace the use of new technology to improve both the quality\nof care provided and the patient outcomes.\n6 Health Services Research and Managerial Epidemiology\nAppendix A\nOriginal Survey Questions\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship,\nand/or publication of this article.\nReferences\n1.
