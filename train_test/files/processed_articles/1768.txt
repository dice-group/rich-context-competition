The revised National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III definition\nwas used to calculate MetSyn.\nto NHANES 1999\u00ad2006, respectively. Although MetSyn prevalence was highest in Mexican\nAmericans, significant increases in prevalence occurred among non-Hispanic whites and non-\nHispanic blacks, especially among younger women.\nCONCLUSIONS -- The persistent increase of MetSyn among U.S. adults is a serious public\nhealth concern because it raises the likelihood of increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes.\nThe metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) is\na constellation of metabolic abnor-\nmalities and is associated with in-\ncreased risk of developing diabetes (1),\ncardiovascular disease (2), and higher\nmortality from all causes (3). Among the\nfew studies using nationally representa-\ntive samples on MetSyn (4\u00ad9), Ford et al.\n(9) estimated an increasing trend of\nMetSyn prevalence by comparing the\nThird National Health and Nutrition Ex-\namination Survey (NHANES III) and\ncause of the smaller sample size of\nMetSyn prevalence for various subpopu-\nlations, which is necessary to track age\nand ethnicity specific trends, was not es-\ntimated. Therefore, the objective of this\nstudy is to compare the prevalence of\nMetSyn between NHANES III and\nof different races or ethnicities.\nMETHODS -- We identified the cases\nof MetSyn using the revised American\nHeart Association/National Cholesterol\nEducation Program Adult Treatment\nPanel III definition (10), including medi-\ncation uses for appropriate MetSyn crite-\nria. Data for this study were obtained from\npublic-use datasets of the NHANES III,\n11#1A), and four continuous NHANES\nsurvey and laboratory procedure of\nNHANES are published elsewhere (11\u00ad\nwere combined for this study to produce\nestimates of MetSyn for demographic\nsubpopulations (e.g., sex-age-race/\nethnicity) with greater statistical reliabil-\nity. Because the data on fasting\ntriglycerides and fasting glucose were re-\nquired to identify MetSyn and those mea-\nsurements were done on a subsample\npopulation, the sample weights for the\nsubsample were used in this study.\nThe appropriate sample weights for\nconstructed using National Center for\nHealth Statistics guidelines (14). To\nmaintain the consistency of blood pres-\nsure data between the two surveys, the\nprocedure described by Ford et al. (9) was\nfollowed.\nThe continuous NHANES measured\nfasting glucose and serum triglycerides\nfrom blood samples drawn in the morn-\ning; therefore, only participants who at-\ntended a morning examination session for\nNHANES III were included in this analy-\nsis. Otherwise, the sample includes men\nand nonpregnant women aged 20 years\nwho fasted for at least 8 h. The number of\nparticipants in the final analysis was\nto calculate prevalence were performed\nusing the survey procedures in SAS soft-\nware version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary,\nNC). The statistical significance of the\nchange in MetSyn prevalence between the\ntwo surveys was examined by Student t\ntest, in which the square root of the sum\nof the squared standard errors was uti-\nlized to calculate the pooled standard er-\nror of the difference in the mean.\nRESULTS -- The age-adjusted preva-\nlence of four of the five metabolic abnor-\nmalities of MetSyn increased significantly\nbetween the surveys for women: abdom-\nprevalence significantly increased in ab-\n                                                \nFrom the Department of Health, Nutrition and Exercise Sciences, North Dakota State University, Fargo,\nNorth Dakota.\nCorresponding author: Gary Liguori, gary.liguori@ndsu.edu.\nA.M. and G.L. contributed equally to this study.\n\u00a9 2011 by the American Diabetes Association.
