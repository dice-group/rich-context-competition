Phillips, MD; for the HELP Investigators\nContext.--Health values (utilities or preferences for health states) are often in-\ncorporated into clinical decisions and health care policy when issues of quality vs\nlength of life arise, but little is known about health values of the very old.\nObjective.--To assess health values of older hospitalized patients, compare\ntheir values with those of their surrogate decision makers, investigate possible de-\nterminantsofhealthvalues,anddeterminewhetherhealthvalueschangeovertime.\nDesign.--A prospective, longitudinal, multicenter cohort study.\nSetting.--Four academic medical centers.\nParticipants.--Four hundred fourteen hospitalized patients aged 80 years or\nolder and their surrogate decision makers who were interviewed and understood\nthe task.\nMain Outcome Measures.--Time\u00adtrade-off utilities, reflecting preferences for\ncurrent health relative to a shorter but healthy life.\nResults.--On average, patients equated living 1 year in their current state of\nhealth with living 9.7 months in excellent health (mean [SD] utility, 0.81 [0.28]). Al-\nthough only 126 patients (30.7%) rated their current quality of life as excellent or\nfor excellent health (utility 0.92). At the other extreme, 25 (6.0%) were willing to\nlive 2 weeks or less in excellent health rather than 1 year in their current state of\nhealth (utility 0.04). Patients were willing to trade significantly less time for a\nhealthy life than their surrogates assumed they would (mean difference, 0.05;\nP=.007); 61 surrogates (20.3%) underestimated the patient's time\u00adtrade-off score\nby 0.25 (3 months of 12) or more. Patients willing to trade less time for better health\nwere more likely to want resuscitation and other measures to extend life.\nTime\u00adtrade-offscorecorrelatedonlymodestlywithquality-of-liferating(r=0.28)and\ninversely with depression score (r=-0.27), but there were few other clinical or de-\nmographic predictors of health values. When patients who survived were asked the\ntime\u00adtrade-off question again at 1 year, they were willing to trade less time for bet-\nter health than at baseline (mean difference, 0.04; P=.04).\nConclusion.--Very old hospitalized patients who could be interviewed were\nable, in most cases, to have their health values assessed using the time\u00adtrade-off\ntechnique. Most patients were unwilling to trade much time for excellent health, but\npreferences varied greatly. Because proxies and multivariable analyses cannot\ngauge health values of elderly hospitalized patients accurately, health values of the\nvery old should be elicited directly from the patient.\nFrom the Section of Outcomes Research, Divi-\nsion of General Internal Medicine, Department of\nInternal Medicine, and the Center for Clinical Effec-\ntiveness, Institute for Health Policy and Health Ser-\nvices Research, University of Cincinnati Medical\nCenter, Cincinnati, Ohio (Dr Tsevat); Division of\nGeneral Internal Medicine, MetroHealth Medical\nCenter, Case Western Reserve University School of\nMedicine, Cleveland, Ohio (Dr Dawson); Health\nServices Research and Development Center,\nSchool of Hygiene and Public Health, Johns Hop-\nkins University, Baltimore, Md (Dr Wu); Center to\nImprove Care of the Dying, George Washington\nUniversity Medical Center, Washington, DC (Dr\nLynn); Division of General Medicine and Primary\nCare, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deacon-\ness Medical Center, Harvard Medical School (Dr\nPhillips and Ms Soukup), and Section for Clinical\nEpidemiology, Division of General Medicine and\nPrimary Care, Department of Medicine, Brigham\nand Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School (Dr\nCook), Boston, Mass; and Department of Cardiol-\nogy, Marshfield Clinic, Marshfield, Wis (Dr Vidaillet).\nAlistofprincipalHospitalizedElderlyLongitudinalProject\n(HELP) investigators appears at the end of this article.\nPortionsofthisarticlewerepresentedinabstractform\nat the 17th annual meeting of the Society of General In-\nReprints: Joel Tsevat, MD, MPH, Section of Outcomes\nResearch, Division of General Internal Medicine, Univer-\nsity of Cincinnati Medical Center, 231 Bethesda Ave,\nLIFE EXPECTANCY has increased\ndramatically even among elderly adults\nover the past few generations. Cur-\nrently, an 80-year-old man can expect to\nlive 7 years and an 80-year-old woman,\n9.1 years.1 But because the elderly dis-\nproportionately have both acute and\nchronic illnesses, quality of life has as-\nsumed increasing importance.\nThere are 2 approaches to assessing\nhealth-related quality of life. The health\nstatus approach describes functioning\nand well-being in 1 or more domains,\nsuch as physical functioning, mental\nhealth, social function, role function,\npain, vitality, and health perception.2-5\nHealth status has been assessed in the\nelderlyforover30years,mostoftenwith\nmeasures of ability to perform activities\nofdailyliving(suchasbathing,dressing,\neating,toileting,andtransferring)6,7 and,\nincreasingly, with brief, multidimen-\nsional surveys.3\nTheotherapproachtoassessinghealth-\nrelated quality of life, known as utility,\npreference, or value assessment, ascer-\ntainsthedesirabilityofastateofhealth.2,8\nOnesuchhealthvaluemeasureisthetime\ntrade-off, which quantifies a person's\npreference for quality vs quantity of life.\nHealthvaluesareusedinindividualclini-\ncal decision making as well as in health\npolicy formulation.2,5,8,9 In clinical deci-\nsion making, they can provide a general\nsense of how patients feel about quality\nvs quantity of life, and they can be used\nin clinical decision analyses to optimize\ntreatment for an individual.2,10 Ex-\namples of using health values in clinical\npractice include helping couples decide\nwhether to have amniocentesis11 and de-\nciding when a patient with human im-\nmunodeficiency virus infection should\nstart zidovudine therapy.12 In addition,\nutilityassessmenthasdemonstratedthat\nclinical guidelines for management of is-\nchemic heart disease may not conform to\npreferences of affected patients.13\nUtilities are most commonly used as\nquality-of-life adjustments to life expec-\ntancy in the calculation of quality-ad-\njusted life years (QALYs), which, in\nturn, are used in clinical decision analy-\n\u00a91998 American Medical Association.

While many analysts8,14 advo-\ncateusingQALYsforsuchpurposes,not\nraised ethical concerns over the use of\nQALYsinhealthpolicyformulation,one\nbeing that the \"old-old\" cannot or will\nnot provide health values and are thus\ndisenfranchised.\nAlthough much work has been done in\ngeriatric health status assessment, little\nis known about the health values of the\nvery old. Health value assessment in the\nelderly is particularly important because\nelderly patients receive fewer invasive\nprocedures and less resource-intensive\nhospitalcarethanyoungerpatients,even\nwhendifferencesinseverityofillnessand\npreferences for life-extending care are\ntaken into account.18 Whether this differ-\nent approach is with the assent of the pa-\ntient or caregivers is not clear. Given the\nimportance of health values, if in fact\nhealth values cannot be ascertained from\nfrail elderly patients, it would be impor-\ntant to know whether their health care\nproxiescouldprovideaccurateestimates\norwhetherhealthvaluescanbepredicted\nonthebasisofhealthstatusorothervari-\nables. Another important issue is\nwhether health values change over time.\nMETHODS\nStudy Participants\nThe Hospitalized Elderly Longitudi-\nnal Project (HELP) was a prospective\nstudyoftheprognoses,preferences,and\ndecision making of hospitalized patients\naged 80 years or older, their surrogate\ndecision makers, and their physicians.\nThe HELP study took place from Janu-\nmedical centers (HELP was related\nclosely to a concurrent study, the Study\nto Understand Prognoses and Prefer-\nences for Outcomes and Risks of Treat-\nmentsproject19).Toqualify,patientshad\nto be at least 80 years old and hospital-\nized. Patients were excluded if they did\nnot speak English; were foreign nation-\nals admitted specifically for a medical\nprocedure; had the acquired immunode-\nficiency syndrome (AIDS); had sus-\ntained multiple trauma; were admitted\nfor hospice care, to the psychiatry ser-\nvice, or for an elective operation; were\nadmitted to a hospital ward after trans-\nfer from another hospital; died or were\ndischarged within 72 hours of hospital-\nization; or were scheduled for discharge\nwithin 72 hours of admission. For most\npatients, a surrogate was identified.20\nInterviews and Instruments\nFor each patient, severity of acute ill-\nness was ascertained using the acute\nphysiologyscore(APS)componentofthe\nAcute Physiology and Chronic Health\nEvaluation III prognostic scoring sys-\ntem.21 Patients who were not intubated,\nwereabletocommunicate,andwereable\nto pass a cognitive screening test22 were\neligible to be interviewed. Trained inter-\nviewers interviewed patients and surro-\ngates approximately 4 days and 12\nmonths after study entry.\nThehealthvaluemeasureusedwasthe\ntheir surrogates were independently\naskedinasystematicfashionwhetherthe\npatient would prefer living only 1 year in\nthe patient's current state of health or\nless time in excellent health, until an in-\ndifference point was ascertained. The\ntime\u00adtrade-off score was then calculated\nasthefractionofayearinexcellenthealth\nthat was equivalent to a year of current\nhealth. For example, if the patient were\nindifferent about choosing between liv-\ning 12 months in their current state of\nhealthorlivingonly9monthsinexcellent\nhealth, their time\u00adtrade-off utility would\nscoresrangedfrom0.04(equivalenttoin-\ndifference between 2 weeks in excellent\nhealthand1yearincurrenthealth)to1.0.\nAfter the respondent completed the\ntime\u00adtrade-off question, the interviewer\njudged whether the respondent under-\nstood the task; respondents who did not\nunderstand were excluded.\nHealthstatusinstrumentsincluded(1)\na global quality-of-life question, in which\nthe respondent was asked to rate the pa-\ntient's quality of life as excellent, very\ngood, good, fair, or poor22; (2) a revised\nmeasure of dependence in activities of\ndaily living over the previous 2\nassesses ability to perform strenuous ac-\ntivities;(4)ashortenedversionofthePro-\nfile of Mood States,28,29 which assesses\nanxiety and depression; and (5) a mea-\nsure of frequency and severity of pain.19\nIn addition, we asked questions concern-\ning preferences regarding cardiopulmo-\nnary resuscitation (CPR); willingness to\ntolerate each of 6 potentially lifelong ad-\nverseoutcomes--pain,mechanicalventi-\nlation, tube feeding, coma, confusion, and\nliving in a nursing home; preferences for\ncare focused on extending life as much as\npossible, even if it means having more\npain and discomfort, vs care focused on\nrelieving pain and discomfort as much as\npossible, even if it means not living as\nlong; and perceived prognosis for surviv-\ning for 2 and 12 months and for function-\nWe assessed the effect of the patient's\nillness on family members in terms of as-\nFor the Duke Activity Status Index,\nmissing items were imputed from surro-\ngate responses for 5 patients.32\nStatistical Analysis\nMeans are expressed as mean (SD),\nand medians are given with 25th and\n75th percentiles. Continuous variables\nwere compared using the Wilcoxon rank\nsum test. Within-patient changes over\ntime were assessed with the Wilcoxon\nsigned rank test. Concordance between\npatients' and their surrogates' time\u00ad\ntrade-off scores was assessed using the\nWilcoxon signed rank test. Univariate\nassociationsbetweenthetime\u00adtrade-off\nand the health status measures, mea-\nsures of perceived prognosis, willing-\nness to tolerate adverse outcomes, and\ndemographic variables were assessed\nusingSpearmancorrelationcoefficients.\nBecause time\u00adtrade-off scores were\nnot normally distributed, we used multi-\nvariable ordinal logistic regression to\nidentify significant predictors of time\u00ad\ntrade-off scores at day 4 and month 12.\nVariables significantly associated with\ntime\u00adtrade-offscoresinunivariateanaly-\nses (when P.10) and variables found to\nhave been related to time\u00adtrade-off\nscores in the Study to Understand Prog-\nnoses and Preferences for Outcomes and\nRisks of Treatments study33 were en-\ntered into the model and retained\nthrough backward elimination, if P was\nless than .05.
