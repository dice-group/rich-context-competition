Lawlor\nDepartment of Social Medicine, Medical Research Council Centre for Causal Analyses in Translational Epidemiology, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom\n Introduction\nIncreasing evidence suggests a role for mineral metabolism in\ncardiovascular disease risk. Lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D\n(25(OH)D,[1\u00ad3] and higher levels of parathyroid hormone\n(PTH)[4] and calcium[5] have been associated with increased\nrisk of cardiovascular disease events in prospective cohort studies,\nbut the mechanisms underlying these associations are unclear.\nThere is evidence that lower levels of 25(OH)D and higher levels\nof PTH are associated with cardiovascular risk factors, including\nhyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia\nand high blood pressure,[5\u00ad12] but to our knowledge no previous\nstudy has examined associations of all three of 25(OH)D, PTH and\ncalcium with cardiovascular risk factors to.\nLevels of 25(OH)D, PTH and calcium are interdependent.\n25(OH)D is a key regulator of circulating calcium levels and of bone\nabsorption of calcium,[13] and via its action on circulating calcium\nlevels, indirectly affects PTH levels. PTH is produced by the\nparathyroid gland, primarily in response to low calcium levels, and\nacts via several mechanisms to increase circulating blood calcium\nlevels.[14] In addition, the hydroxylation of 25(OH)D in the kidneys\nto 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (the active form of vitamin D) is\ntightly regulated by plasma PTH and serum calcium levels.[13]\nThus, levels of 25(OH)D, PTH, and calcium may be directly\nassociated with cardiovascular risk factors or mediated by each other.\nThe objectives of the current study were (i) to examine the\nassociation of 25(OH)D, PTH and calcium with a range of\ncardiovascular risk factors; (ii) to examine whether associations of\n25(OH)D, PTH and calcium with risk factors are independent of\neach other or not.\nMethods\nNHANES is a complex, multistage probability sample of the\nhealthy, ambulatory population of the U.S. Full details on survey\nmethods can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm.\nEthics Statement\nEthical approval for the study was obtained from the NCHS\nResearch Ethics Review Board (ERB) and further ethical approval\nfor use of NHANES data that is freely available on the web is not\nrequired as it is anonymized. Written consent was obtained from\nparticipants.\nInformation on age, ethnicity, physical activity, smoking,\nalcohol intake in the past month, family income, diabetes and\nCHD status (using the Rose angina questionnaire[15]) were self-\nreported. A poverty-income ratio (PIR) was calculated for each\nfamily based on self-reported family income in relation to poverty\nthreshold, family size and calendar year. Values below 1 are below\nthe official poverty threshold while PIR values of 1 or greater\nindicate income above the poverty level (range 0\u00ad5). Smoking was\ncoded as never, ex, currently on some days and currently every\nday. Detailed information on leisure time physical activities in the\npast month was recorded and assigned a metabolic equivalent\n(MET) score. Information on supplementation during the past 30\ndays was collected and participants were asked to present the\ncontainer. Vitamin D intake from supplementation was calculated\nper participant according to the brand of supplementation taken.\nParticipants underwent a medical examination in which weight,\nstanding height and waist circumference were measured in a\nstandardized fashion. Seated resting blood pressure was measured\nby a physician and calculated as the average of available\nmeasurements (min 1 max 4), excluding the first measurement if\nmore than one was available.\nBlood samples were immediately centrifuged, aliquoted and\nfrozen at 270uC. Samples were shipped on dry ice to central\nlaboratories and stored at 270uC. In all three cycles, 25(OH)D\nwas measured using a Diasorin RIA method. PTH was measured\nwith an automated analyzer using a sandwich principle in both\nLX20 system that uses an indirect (or diluted) ISE methodology.\nThe method used to measure the albumin concentration on the\nLX20 is a bichromatic digital endpoint method. We calculated\nalbumin adjusted calcium using the formula: adjusted calcium\nalbumin [g/l]).\nHigh density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) was measured by\ndirect immunoassay. As the assay method was changed in 2003,\nTriglycerides were measured using a timed-endpoint method. Low\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels were derived on\nexaminees that were examined in the morning session only,\naccording to the Friedewald calculation, which uses information\non total-, HDL-c and triglycerides.\nFasting insulin, glucose and triglycerides were available for a\nrandom subgroup of participants who attended the morning clinics.\nmended by the National Center for Health Statistics[16]. HOMA-\nR was calculated as the product of fasting glucose (mmol/l) and\ninsulin (mU/ml) divided by the constant 22.5.[17] Plasma glucose\nwas measured using an enzyme hexokinase method in all included\ncreatinine was measured with the Jaffe rate method and measures\nmended. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a measure of kidney\nfiltration function was estimated with the abbreviated Modification\nof Diet in Renal Disease study equation.[18] An oral glucose test\n2 hour postload values from this glucose tolerance test are used in\nanalyses presented here.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses were adjusted for sampling probability (via weights)\nand cluster effects using the svy procedures in Stata version 10.\nMeasurements for fasting insulin, HOMA-R, triglycerides and\nPTH were naturally log transformed to normalize distributions.\nFasting insulin and HOMA-R are nearly perfectly correlated\n(Pearson's r = 0.97). We report result for fasting insulin, however\nall results are the same if fasting insulin is replaced with HOMA-R.\nLinear regression was used to describe the distribution of\nparticipant characteristics across fifths of the 25(OH)D distribu-\ntion, the adjusted calcium and the (logged) PTH distribution. In\nmultivariable analyses, 25(OH)D, logged PTH, calcium and risk\nfactors were all z-scored, so that coefficients between each are\ndirectly comparable. In these analyses we adjusted for the\nfollowing potential confounders: age, sex, ethnicity, PIR, waist\ncircumference (or BMI), smoking and physical activity. In the final\nmodel the associations of each exposure with risk factors were\nmutually adjusted for the remaining two. Since 25(OHD, PTH\nand calcium may act via mediating effects and/or be part of the\nsame causal mechanism we considered the confounder adjusted\nmodels (before mutual adjustment for each other) to be our best\nestimate of the unconfounded association of each with cardiovas-\ncular risk factors.\nAll analyses presented here include data for a random subgroup\nof participants who attended the morning clinic and provided\nfasting blood samples (N = 6,695). Plasma 25(OH)D was available\npregnant women (N = 402), participants with a history of diabetes\nOf these, complete data on sex, age, ethnicity, PIR, smoking, BMI,\nwaist circumference, blood pressure, LDL-c, HbA1c, fasting\nglucose, insulin and triglycerides was available for 3,958 participants\n(74% of eligible). These participants formed our main analysis\nsample for analyses with 25(OH)D. PTH was only measured in two\nis 2,554 (75% of those eligible in these two surveys). Physical activity\nand alcohol data was additionally available for 66\u00ad67% of the\nanalysis samples for 25(OH)D and PTH. We did not limit analyses\nto participants with physical activity and alcohol data, but\ncompared results for the subgroups with and without these data.\n2005\u00ad6 surveys only and 2-hour postload glucose was available for\nanalyses are limited to these numbers. We also performed sensitivity\nanalyses excluding participants with osteoporosis (N = 202) and\nthose reporting taking vitamin D supplementation (N = 1,457),\nexcluding participants with fasting glucose values greater than\n7 mmol/l (N = 121) and excluding participants with an estimated\nResults\nAmongst the 3, 958 participants who formed our main analysis\n25(OH)D and CVD Risk Factors\ngeometric mean PTH among the 2,554 from the two surveys\nwhere this was assayed was 38.0 ng/l (SE logged PTH = 0.01).\n25(OH)D was modestly inversely associated with log PTH\nPTH and adjusted calcium were weakly inversely associated\nParticipant characteristics across fifths of the 25(OH)D dis-\ntribution, the PTH distribution and the adjusted calcium distri-\nbution are given in Table S1.\nTable 1 presents the multivariable analysis of associations of\n25(OH)D with cardiovascular risk factors. In age and sex adjusted\nmodels (model 1) there was strong statistical evidence of association\nof 25(OH)D with all risk factors except for diastolic blood pressure\n(DBP) and LDL-c. For all associations lower 25(OH)D levels were\nassociated with more adverse cardiovascular risk factor levels. All\nassociations persisted after controlling for ethnicity, PIR and\nsmoking (model 2). Inverse associations with systolic blood pressure\n(SBP), HbA1c, fasting glucose and fasting insulin, and the positive\nassociation with HDL-c also remained when adding waist\ncircumference to the models (model 3), but inverse associations\nwith triglycerides and 2-h postload glucose were attenuated to the\nnull.\nAssociations of PTH with cardiovascular risk factors are\npresented in Table 2. In age and sex adjusted models PTH was\npositively associated with DBP and SBP, HbA1c, fasting and\npostload glucose, and fasting insulin. Age and sex adjusted\nassociations with HbA1c and postload glucose were attenuated\nto the null after adjustment for ethnicity, PIR and smoking (model\n2). Further adjustment for waist circumference attenuated\nassociations with SBP, HDL-c and fasting glucose to the null, so\nthat the only association remaining was that of the positive\nassociation of PTH with DBP (model 3).\nAssociations of adjusted calcium with cardiovascular risk factors\nare presented in Table 3. In age and sex adjusted models calcium\nwas positively associated with all risk factors except with HDL-c\nand DBP (model 1) and these associations remained when\ncontrolling for other potential confounders (models 2 and 3).\nAssociations observed in the confounder adjusted model (model\n3 in tables 1, 2 & 3) were largely unchanged by mutual adjustment\nfor 25(OH)D, PTH and adjusted calcium (model 4 in tables 1, 2, &\n3).

When BMI was included instead of waist circumfer-\nence, there was no difference to the results presented in model 3 (in\nTables 1\u00ad3). Moreover, adding a term for physical activity and\nalcohol consumption did not affect results which is expected as\nneither was associated with 25(OH)D, PTH or adjusted calcium\n(Table S1). Finally, excluding participants diagnosed with\nosteoporosis, taking vitamin D supplementation, participants with\nelevated fasting glucose or with low eGFR also did not\nsubstantially alter results compared to those presented.\nDiscussion\nWe found that 25(OH)D is inversely associated with SBP,\nfasting insulin, glucose and HbA1c, and positively associated with\nHDL-c, after adjustment for multiple potential confounders in a\nTable 1.

Similarly to our\nfindings, Zhao et al. found inverse associations of 25(OH)D but\nnot of PTH with measures of insulin resistance in adult\nTable 2.

This is in\nline with results of a prospective study demonstrating an inverse\nassociation of 25(OH)D with future hyperglycaemia and insulin\nresistance, after adjustment for PTH.[9] A recent study examined\nassociations of PTH and adjusted calcium with cardiovascular risk\nfactors in a general population of 1,016 Swedish men and women,\n70 years old[5]. In that study, PTH was associated with more\ncardiovascular risk factors than adjusted calcium, in contrast to\nour findings. However, a meta-analysis of randomised controlled\ntrials of calcium supplementation found that calcium supplemen-\ntation was associated with an increased risk of myocardial\ninfarction, stroke, or sudden death.[21]\nWe found strong evidence that PTH is positively associated with\nDBP and weaker evidence of a positive association with SBP. One\nprevious cross sectional study found positive associations of PTH\nwith diastolic and systolic blood pressure and with hypertension,\nindependent of potential confounding factors and 25(OH)D.[10] In\nthat study 25(OH)D was not associated with blood pressure variation\nor hypertension. Consistent with our findings, a prospective study\nusing data on sub-samples from the Health Professional's and\nNurses' Health studies found independent inverse associations of\n25(OH)D with incident hypertension,[22] and positive associations\nof PTH with incident hypertension (the latter using data only from\nthe male Health Professional study).[23]\nGiven that chronic kidney disease adversely affects vitamin D status\nand is associated with cardiovascular risk,[24] we repeated analyses\nexcluding participants with moderate or severe chronic kidney disease.\nResults were unchanged to those presented suggesting that observed\nassociations are not driven by participants with chronic kidney disease.\nThe main limitation of this analysis is that we cannot discern\ntemporality due to the cross sectional nature of the data and\ntherefore we cannot infer causality between levels of 25(OH)D,\nPTH and adjusted calcium and cardiovascular disease risk factors,\nthough findings from prospective studies support a direction of effect\nfrom 25(OH)D to hypertension and impaired glucose metabo-\nlism.[8,9,22] We were unable to adjust for seasonality of blood\ntaking but seasonality is unlikely to confound associations, since we\nwould not expect it to be associated with the outcomes we examined\nhere, other than through its effect on circulating 25(OH)D.\nHowever, without adjustment for seasonality the associations we\nhave examined may be an underestimate of the true associa-\ntions.[25] Finally, drifts in the 25(OH)D assay performance over\ntime, likely due to reagent and calibration lot changes in the\nreformulated DiaSorin assay, have been noted[26]. However, as\nrecommended by the National Center for Health Statistics, we\ncombined data from three cycles in order to obtain stable estimates.\nTaken together our findings suggest that the associations of\nvitamin D, calcium and PTH with incident cardiovascular\ndisease[1\u00ad4,27] represent different underlying associations with\ncardiovascular risk factors, with vitamin D and calcium likely\nacting through pathways involving glucose and lipid metabolism\nand PTH having a more important effect via blood pressure. It has\nbeen suggested that vitamin D status affects both beta cell function\nand insulin release and sensitivity, both being calcium dependent\npathways, as well as inflammatory processes.[9,28] It has also been\nsuggested that PTH affects blood pressure through a proliferative\neffect on vascular smooth muscle cells.[5,29]\nTo summarize, in a large general population sample of adults\nwithout diabetes or coronary heart disease, we found lower levels\nof 25(OH)D to be associated with higher levels of fasting glucose,\ninsulin and SBP and lower levels of HDL-c. PTH was positively\nassociated with DBP, but not other cardiovascular risk factors and\nadjusted calcium was associated with all outcomes except DBP and\nHDL-c. These findings suggest that the recently reported\nprospective associations of 25(OH)D and PTH with cardiovascular\ndisease occur through different underlying associations, with\nproximal risk factors. Additional research should examine whether\n25(OH)D, calcium and PTH are independently associated with\ncardiovascular disease and its risk factors in prospective studies.\nFinally, genetic variants that are robustly (and independently)\nassociated with variation in 25(OH)D, PTH and calcium levels\ncould be used as instrumental variables[30] to examine their\ncausal effects on cardiovascular risk factors and events.\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1 Change in z-score of fasting glucose, insulin and\nHDL-c per 1 z-score difference in 25(OH)D, PTH and calcium,\nadjusted for confounders and mutual adjustment (equivalent to\nTable S1 Characteristics (% or mean and 95%CI) across fifths\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: AF DL.
