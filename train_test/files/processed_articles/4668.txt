In three cross-sectional studies (N \u00bc 1,403), we examined how the Dark Triad traits were\ncorrelated with measures of resource availability, harshness, and unpredictability in one's childhood and adulthood. The Dark\nTriad traits were correlated with self-reports of an unpredictable childhood when using both the Short Dark Triad and the Dirty\nDozen measures. These effects were somewhat stronger in men than in women and were replicable across samples. We also\nreplicated sex differences in the Dark Triad traits but found none for our measures of socioecological conditions. Results are\ndiscussed in terms of the recurrent unpredictability in evolutionary history necessitating the sensitivity and responsiveness to such\nfeatures to enable survival and reproduction. We contend that the Dark Triad traits might be condition-sensitive adaptations to\nsocioecological unpredictability that all people could have if properly motivated.\n",

Jonason1, Adiba Icho1, and Katie Ireland1\n Keywords\nDark Triad, psychopathy, narcissism, Machiavellianism, resources, life history theory\nIntroduction\nFor years, the personality psychology landscape has been dom-\ninated by the Big Five traits (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness,\nneuroticism, conscientiousness, and openness/intellect; Costa\n& McCrae, 1995). While still important in understanding\nsweeping aspects of personality, the taxonomy may fall short\nin its ability to tap some of the ``darker'' and less socially\ndesirable aspects of individual differences. One stream of\nresearch that has been quickly gaining momentum and addres-\nsing this theoretical and empirical gap is the work on the Dark\nTriad traits (e.g., Furnham, Richards, & Paulhus, 2013; Jona-\nson, Webster, Schmitt, Li, & Crysel, 2012). The Dark Triad\ntraits are characterized by vanity and self-centeredness (i.e.,\nnarcissism), manipulation and cynicism (i.e., Machiavellian-\nism), and callous social attitudes and amorality (i.e., psycho-\npathy). The traits have implications for organizational\npsychology (Spain, Harms, & Leberton, 2014), social psychol-\nogy (Hodson, Hogg, & MacInnis, 2009), clinical psychology\n(Jonason, Baughman, Carter, & Parker, 2015; Jonason, Koenig,\nOne reason for the momentum these traits have garnered\nstems from their integration into an evolutionary or adaptionist\nparadigm (Carter, Campbell, & Muncer, 2014; Jonason, Jones,\n& Lyons, 2013). The integration into this paradigm has pro-\nvided a new way of interpreting the many factors associated\nwith the Dark Triad traits, one that does not assume dysfunc-\ntionality and encourages domain specificity in its predictions.\nFor instance, the Dark Triad traits facilitate a short-term\n(Jonason, Li, Webster, & Schmitt, 2009) and exploitive (Jona-\nson, Girgis, & Milne-Home, 2015) mating strategy in men and\na social strategy characterized by a protean approach to manip-\nulation (Jonason & Webster, 2012) and limited empathy which\ncould be instrumental in taking advantage of others (Jonason,\n1 School of Social Sciences and Psychology, Western Sydney University,\nPenrith, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nPeter K.

However, what is\nless clear is why these traits persist in the population and how\nthey can best be understood. Their persistence suggests an\nevolutionary model might be useful in understanding these\ntraits.\nEvidence is overwhelming. The Dark Triad traits are heri-\ntable with meaningful unshared environmental variance (Fig-\nueredo, Va\n\u00b4squez, Brumbach, & Schneider, 2004; Petrides,\nVernon, Schermer, & Veselka, 2011; Vernon, Villani, Vickers,\n& Harris, 2008). However, few attempts have been made to\nunderstand what the environmental variance is. If we consider a\nGene \u00c2 Environment interaction, it may be that the disposi-\ntions found in the Dark Triad traits might be condition-\nsensitive adaptations to socioecological stress. That is, while\nthere is substantial genetic variance associated with individual\ndifferences in the Dark Triad traits, genes are not sufficient to\nexplain the complete picture. It may be that all people could be\nhigh or low on the Dark Triad traits if properly motivated.1\nWhile prior authors have examined how childhood conditions\nare related to personality traits like Machiavellianism (i.e.,\nSlaughter, 2011) and narcissism (i.e., Lyons, Morgan, Thomas,\n& Al Hashmi, 2013), few have examined all three traits simul-\ntaneously (an important task because they overlap and are\nargued to be part of a coordinated system; Figueredo, Gladden,\nSisco, Patch, & Jones, 2015), have not taken an evolutionary\nperspective, and did not assess general (albeit recalled) child-\nhood conditions and socioeconomic status.\nIn understanding the role of the childhood conditions on the\ndevelopment of personality, both the harshness (e.g., agree-\nment with the statement ``I grew up in a relatively wealthy\nneighborhood''; Brumbach, Figueredo, & Ellis, 2009; Ellis,\nFigueredo, Brumbach, & Schlomer, 2009) and the predicability\n(e.g., agreement with the statement ``Things were often chaotic\nmatter. For instance, the unpredictability of one's environment\nappears to increase mortality salience, future discounting,\nshort-term mating strategies, and risk taking (Griskevicius,\nDelton, Robertson, & Tybur, 2011; Griskevicius, Tybur, Del-\nharshness predicts withdrawal as a self-protective measure\n(Bowlby, 1979). Consistent information about predictability\nand harshness (or lack thereof) may be encoded through adap-\ntive heuristics that are especially sensitive to feedback from the\nworld in one's childhood. Generally speaking, we expect the\nDark Triad traits to be more strongly and consistently corre-\nlated with unpredictability as opposed to harshness.\nUnpredictability is associated with various apparent mani-\nfestations of a fast life history strategy (e.g., short-term mating;\nBelsky, 2012), and the Dark Triad traits have been identified as\ncapturing similar variance (Jonason et al., 2010; Jonason, Li, &\nset a young person's brain to see the world as being capricious\nand irregular, thus making investment in long-term, mutualistic\nstrategies seem limited in utility and payoff. This information\nmay allow people to develop preconceived notions (whether\naccurate or not) about the kind of life to expect and to set their\napproach to life to match.2 The Dark Triad traits may represent\nsolutions to life's challenges that are sensitive to this informa-\ntion. In addition, men may be more likely than women are to\ndevelop a ``Dark Triad response'' to unpredictability, as the\nrelative payoff is greater for men than for women.\nThat said, the Dark Triad traits do not fully overlap. The\nportions of the traits that do not overlap may permit correla-\ntions with measures of harshness as well. For instance, narcis-\nsism and, to a lesser extent, Machiavellianism might be\nactivated in light of favorable economic conditions; in other\nwords, such conditions may create a sense of entitlement and\nself-love that can accompany the presence and access to finan-\ncial stability/abundance (i.e., spoiled brats). Finally, there may\nbe aspects of the psychopathy construct like criminality (i.e.,\nfactor 2) that may be sensitive to economic hardship (Harpur,\nHare, & Hakstian, 1989). Such information would make the\napparent payoff ratio sufficiently high that criminality might be\na reasonable response to the world.\nThe Dark Triad traits are associated with various kinds of\napparently socially undesirable behaviors and attitudes. Given\nthat generations of individual, societal, institutional, and gov-\nernmental efforts have attempted to reduce such behavior, it is\nsurprising (to some) that these traits persist. One reason may be\nthat they are present in all people, in their genetic background,\nbut are not necessarily activated to ``problematic'' levels in all\npeople. For those people who experience the right (or wrong,\ndepending on perspective) socioecological conditions, these\ntraits may be important in allowing some people to get what\nthey want out of what they perceive to be a capricious world.\nIn this study, we examine whether the Dark Triad traits are\nsensitive to individual differences in the quality of one's access\nto financial and familial resources. We examine how the Dark\nTriad traits are related to various indicators of socioeconomic\nstatus and whether those associations are moderated by parti-\ncipant's sex. Finally, we replicate sex differences in the Dark\nTriad traits and test for equivalence in the sexes in relation to\nsocioecological indicators.\nMethod\nParticipant and Procedure\nTwo hundred and eighty four (46% female) Americans (83%\nparticipated in a larger online study concerning the Dark Triad\ntraits in exchange for US$1 on Amazon's Mechanical Turk\n(i.e., mTurk; Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011). Only\nthose participants who completed the measures from unique\nIP addresses were included. Participants were informed of the\nnature of the study and were asked to give consent if they\nwished to participate, and only those who gave consent were\nincluded. They progressed through a series of self-report\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nmeasures that assessed the variables of interest. At the end of\nthe study, participants were debriefed and thanked.\nMeasures\nTo measure the Dark Triad traits, we used the Short Dark Triad\npersonality inventory. Participants were asked to report their\nagreement (1 \u00bc Strongly disagree; 5 \u00bc Strongly agree) with\nstatements measuring Machiavellianism (e.g., ``Most people\nare suckers''), narcissism (e.g., ``I am an average person''), and\npsychopathy (e.g., ``I like to pick on losers'').

Participants completed the\nmeasures of childhood socioeconomic status (e.g., ``I grew\nup in a relatively wealthy neighborhood''; a \u00bc .85), family\nresources (e.g., ``familial support for food''; a \u00bc .91), child-\nhood unpredictability (e.g., ``Things were often chaotic in my\nhouse''; a \u00bc .80), and current socioeconomic status (e.g., ``I\nfeel relatively wealthy these days''; a \u00bc .90). Participants also\nestimated, on single-item measures, their household income\nwhen they were a child and currently (1 \u00bc Less than\nthese items can be found in Appendix A.\nWe also measured the Big Five traits as controls, using the\n20-item short International Personality Item Pool (Donnellan,\nOswald, Baird, & Lucas, 2006). Participants were asked the\ndegree to which they agreed (1 \u00bc Very inaccurate; 5 \u00bc Very\naccurate) with statements such as the following: ``Have a vivid\nimagination'' (i.e., openness), ``Get chores done right away''\n(i.e., conscientiousness), ``I am the life of the party'' (i.e.,\nextraversion), ``Sympathize with others' feelings'' (i.e., agree-\nableness), and ``Have frequent mood swings'' (i.e., neuroti-\ncism). Items were averaged to create composites of openness\n(a \u00bc .81), conscientiousness (a \u00bc .58), extraversion (a \u00bc .82),\nagreeableness (a \u00bc .84), and neuroticism (a \u00bc .80).\nResults\nWe replicated (Jonason, Li, & Czarna, 2013) sex differences in\nthe Dark Triad traits with men scoring higher than women in all\nthree cases (Table 1). There were no sex differences in the\nvarious socioecological indicators including current income.\nThe Dark Triad traits were all correlated with an unpredictable\nenvironment as a child (Table 2). Machiavellianism and nar-\ncissism were associated with good current socioeconomic sta-\ntus, whereas narcissism was correlated with good\nsocioeconomic conditions as a child. These correlations did not\ndiffer much in men and women with one exception. That is, the\ncorrelation between narcissism and income when growing up\nthan in women (r \u00bc \u00c0.03).\nIn hopes of saying something larger about the relationship\nbetween socioecological conditions and the Dark Triad traits,\nwe adopted a Dark Triad composite (Jonason et al., 2009)\napproach by averaging scores on each of the Dark Triad traits\nTable 1.

The Big Five did show various associations\nwith the measures of resources in childhood and adulthood (see\nTable 3). The associations generally remained. For instance, nar-\ncissism was correlated with current income (pr \u00bc .12, p < .05),\nand Machiavellianism was correlated with current socioeco-\npsychopathy (pr \u00bc .20, p < .01), and the Dark Triad composite\n(pr \u00bc .17, p < .01) were correlated with an unpredictable child-\nhood environment but Machiavellianism dropped out (pr \u00bc .09).\nDetails concerning these analyses are available upon request.\nStudy 1 suggests the Dark Triad traits are all correlated with\nunpredictable childhoods, consistent with predictions derived\nfrom Life History Theory. However, it is limited in three ways.\nFirst, it relied solely on an mTurk sample. Second, it relied on\nonly one measure of the Dark Triad traits. Third, it failed to take\ninto consideration the possibility that people--narcissists in par-\nticular--might inflate self-reports of their income and other such\nfactors. Therefore, in Study 2, we extend Study 1 by collecting\ndata from both mTurk and a snowball sample, using two brief\nmeasures of the Dark Triad traits to ensure the relationships\nreported were not measurement or sampling artifacts, and ensure\nthat our results were robust to the partialing of variance associ-\nated with individual differences in social desirability.\nMethod\nParticipants and Procedure\nFour hundred and five (46% female) Americans (81% White/\nparticipated in a larger online study concerning the Dark Triad\ntraits.

In addition,\nnarcissism (measured with the Dark Triad Dirty Dozen and the\nSD3) was associated with greater socioeconomic status and\nhousehold incomes in childhood and currently.

The correlation between\nMachiavellianism (SD3 measure only) and family resources\nwas more strongly (Fisher's z \u00bc \u00c02.72, p < .01) correlated in\nmen (r \u00bc \u00c0.22, p < 05) than in women (r \u00bc .05).

DTDD \u00bc Dark Triad Dirty Dozen; SD3 \u00bc Short Dark Triad.\nJonason et al. 5\ncorrelations were examined in men and women, an interesting\npattern emerged (Table 6). Favorable socioecologies focused\naround money and were associated with higher Dark Triad\ncomposite scores in women, than in men. In contrast, unpre-\ndictable environments were associated with higher Dark Triad\ncomposite scores in men, than in women.\nStudies 1 and 2 provided reasonably consistent evidence for our\nprimary hypothesis that the Dark Triad traits should be linked\nto (self-reports) an unpredictable childhood that was robust to\nremoving variance associated with the Big Five traits and\nsocial desirability and measurement variance in the Dark Triad\ntraits. However, the results are reliant on a single measure of\nchildhood conditions, a measure that has not been fully vetted\nfor validity and psychometric properties. Therefore, in Study 3,\nwe attempt to replicate these effects with a series of author-\ngenerated, single-item measures in hopes of further testing our\nhypotheses.\nMethod\nParticipants and Procedure\nThe sample was composed of 705 American participants (48%\npaid US$2 for their completion of a series of measures on\nmTurk. Ethnically speaking, 7% were African American,\n77% were European Americans, 7% were Asian American, and\n8% were Middle Eastern American. Upon completion partici-\npants were thanked for their participation and debriefed.\nMeasures\nTo measure the Dark Triad traits, the Dark Triad Dirty Dozen\n(Jonason & Webster, 2010) was used as before. Items were\naveraged together to create an index of Machiavellianism\nWe also averaged all 12 items to create a measure of the latent\nDark Triad (a \u00bc .87).\nIn order to measure childhood conditions, we generated\nour own measure. It was composed of items assessing\nsocioeconomic status, predictability, and harshness. Instead\nof treating the items as indicators of latent construct, we\nopted to treat each independently to bolster the nuance we\ncan provide. The particular items can be seen in Table 7.\nWhen asking about socioeconomic status, participants were\npresented with a scale that ranged from lower class to upper\nclass. When assessing childhood conditions, participants\nreported their agreement (1 \u00bc Not at all; 5 \u00bc Very much)\nwith each item. Appendix C has correlations among these\nindicators.\nResults\nIn Table 7, we replicated sex differences in the Dark Triad traits\n(Jonason et al., 2013). Men scored higher than women did on\nall of the traits. Consistent with that mentioned earlier, there\nwere few sex differences in self-reports of resource conditions.\nThere were, however, two sex differences, albeit small in mag-\nnitude. Men reported better socioeconomic status today and a\nbetter childhood than women did.\nIn Table 8, we report correlations between the Dark Triad\ntraits and indicators of (perceived) childhood conditions.\nMachiavellianism was associated with (perceptions of) an\nunstable, unpredictable, harsh, and privileged yet stressful\nchildhood. Narcissism was associated with (perceptions of)\ngood socioeconomic status today and a privileged, good, and\neasy childhood. Psychopathy was associated with (perceptions\nof) an unstable, harsh, and stressful childhood. These results\nconceptually--albeit imperfectly--replicate results from Stud-\nies 1 and 2 using an alternative measure of childhood\nconditions.\nWe tested whether the correlations between the Dark Triad\ntraits and indicators of childhood conditions differed in each\nsex. Given the large number of tests, we only report those\ndifferences (i.e., Fisher's z) that were significant (p < .01); a\nfull report of all the correlations is available upon request. The\ncorrelation between psychopathy and socioeconomic status\ntoday was absent in men (r \u00bc \u00c0.05, ns) but present in women\n(r \u00bc \u00c0.12, p < .05) which were significantly different associa-\ntions (z \u00bc 2.92).

In accounting for the sex dif-\nference in ratings of having a good socioeconomic status today,\nwe entered participants sex (b \u00bc .11, p < .01) into Step 1 and\nnarcissism (b \u00bc .11, p < .01) in Step 2. We found partial\nsex difference shrunk to .09 (p < .05). When we tried to account\nfor sex differences in self-reports of a good childhood, the\npartial mediation effect was the same but marginally signifi-\nof item-level analyses, such effects should be interpreted with\ncaution.\nDiscussion\n``Why does evil exist?'' is a classic question about the nature of\nthe universe and humankind. Despite considerable efforts to\nremove antisocial personality traits from the population\nthrough religions (e.g., threat of damnation), laws (e.g., threat\nof imprisonment), social movements (e.g., encouraging self-\nesteem), and institutional sanctions (e.g., threat of being fired),\nthese traits persist and, by all accounts, may have always been\npresent. They may be impossible to remove as they are, to some\nextent, present in everyone. All people may have the potential\nto be high or low on the Dark Triad traits. This potential comes\nfrom the encoded potential in the human genotype.

This means that exposure to specific conditions is\nthe precipitating factor, which determines people's trait activa-\ntion and position on the Dark Triad continuum. Experiences (or\nat the very least, recollection of) of childhood unpredictability\nmay be some of the prerequisite conditions to activate the\ndormant selfishness, competiveness, and antisociality found\nin the Dark Triad traits. While by no means definitive, the\npresent results are consistent with a condition-dependent model\nof the Dark Triad traits.\nOur contention, albeit tentative, is that the Dark Triad traits\nare part of the encoded genotype of at least humans (if not most\nspecies that could benefit from opportunism, selfishness, and\nexploitiveness at times), but given contextual factors, they are\nonly the effective phenotype in a few. The Dark Triad traits\nmay be condition-dependent adaptations to solve life's adap-\ntive problems in the face of an unpredictable and harsh world.\nFrom this perspective, the Dark Triad traits could be phenoty-\npic responses to predetermined and evolutionary relevant infor-\nmation, responses that might be stronger and more important in\nmen given asymmetries and costs and benefits for living a fast\ntion is likely to have shaped adaptive heuristics to take in\ninformation about the quality of one's world, process that infor-\nmation, and formulate a solution. This solution acts as the\nvector one takes to solving the problems of finding mates,\nkeeping mates, protecting kin, and finding food and resources.\nIn the case of the Dark Triad traits, that solution appears to be\nmate with various partners and lower one's standards (Jonason\net al., 2011); abandon mates and do not try to keep them (Jona-\nson, Li, & Buss, 2010); be competitive, selfish, and manipula-\nimmediate payoffs over delayed ones (Jonason et al., 2010).\nThe clinical implications for this are important. It suggests\nthose high in the Dark Triad traits may be unfairly vilified and\nthat the model for treating such disorders (i.e., a categorical\nmodel) may start with a faulty premise. Many researchers, lay-\npeople, and clinicians may implicitly treat those with disorders\nas qualitatively different than others. Instead, a condition-\nsensitive model allows for genetic tendencies to interact with\nenvironmental contingencies, thereby making far more people\nsusceptible to going down the path to the ``dark side.''\nPrior research suggests there may be a higher order latent\nDark Triad factor that accounts for the shared variance in the\ntraits (Figueredo et al., 2015; Jonason, Kaufman, Webster, &\n2010). When we examined the Dark Triad composite (Jonason\net al., 2009), as a means to understand the shared variance in\nthe traits, we revealed that it was slightly more strongly corre-\nlated with an unpredictable childhood than socioeconomic\nhardship in Studies 1 and 2 but not Study 3, but the way we\ncalculated the composite differed. Both of these approaches\nmay be problematic, as they conflate the various aspects of\neach part of the Dark Triad traits into one. However, as we did\nnot solely rely on this, we were able to show that unpredict-\nability in one's childhood is really where the Dark Triad traits\nlink to socioecological conditions, while the traits may have\ntheir own, less replicable, and strong links to economic harsh-\nness in childhood and adulthood.\nLimitations and Conclusions\nDespite the novelty and rigor of our study, it has some limita-\ntions. First, one might criticize our reliance on Western, Edu-\ncated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD; see\nHenrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010). The possibility exists that\nthe associations we found between child/adulthood socioecolo-\ngical conditions and the Dark Triad traits might be localized to\nWestern, online samples. As long as we confine ourselves to\nWestern samples, we are confident in our conclusions. However,\nif we begin to examine various cultural factors, our results might\nbe attenuated or even exacerbated, given local conditions and\neven display rules related to collectivistic cultures.\nSecond, we relied on brief self-report measures throughout.\nWhile we mostly used validated scales, this creates a number of\npotential problems. Most important, we used the Dirty Dozen\nmeasure twice which has a number of detractors (Carter et al.,\nspective reports of people's childhood conditions. As is well\nknown in psychology, memory is frail. However, we see no\nreason to think that such biases will be particularly localized to\nthose high on the Dark Triad traits but call for longitudinal\nwork to be done on the Dark Triad traits. In addition, we failed\nto experimentally manipulate the conditions we feel act as\nprecursors to the Dark Triad traits. While that is reasonable,\nwe feel that the amount of exposure needed to create such\ndispositions might be longer than we can achieve in a labora-\ntory setting. Instead, what might be more fruitful is to see how\nconditions vary or moderate the associations between the Dark\nTriad traits and outcomes like selfishness or aggressiveness\nthat are seen as pivotal downstream correlates of the Dark Triad\ntraits. Finally, as we used brief measures of the Dark Triad\ntraits, we were not able to examine subfactors of the traits to\nprovide further nuance to test whether different aspects of these\nmultidimensional traits are sensitive to different inputs from\none's life. That said, it might be argued that once we start\nexamining parts of each trait, we will no longer be examining\nthe trait itself but something else that is related to the global\nconstruct in question. Nevertheless, future research might pro-\nvide such further nuance.\nThird, our results did not fully converge in Study 3 relative\nto the first two studies, and the results are not identical through-\nout. This should not be of serious surprise in that we adopted\nitem-level analysis and used a different measure as we used in\nStudies 1 and 2, and sample size can affect the power to detect\neffects. The results from Study 3, therefore, only partially sup-\nport our hypotheses. Studies 1 and 2 were more inconsistent\nwhich is of no surprise, given measurement invariance. It\nappears that psychopathy and Machiavellianism are the most\nsensitive to childhood stress in the form of harshness and\nunpredictability. Narcissism was associated with childhood\nunpredictability, but such a link was allusive in Study 3 and\ndependent on the measure of the Dark Triad traits in Study 2.\n8 Evolutionary Psychology\nNarcissism and, to a less degree, Machiavellianism were sen-\nsitive to current and childhood economic conditions. Psycho-\npathy was only associated with harsh childhood conditions in\nStudies 2 and 3. Nevertheless, these effects, in general, were\nsomewhat moderated by participant's sex, and sex differences\nin self-reports of having a good childhood might be mediated\nby individual differences in narcissism.\nWe do not contend that the Dark Triad traits are ubiqui-\ntously adaptive. Indeed, only a naive evolutionary psychologist\nwould make such a domain-general prediction. Instead, the\nfunctional utility of the Dark Triad traits and their related dis-\npositions and biases are directly tied to a particular environ-\nment or niche. As a society, we may perceive the traits as\n``bad'' because for many of us, the socioecological conditions\nof our childhood have changed to the point that we wish to\npunish people characterized by these traits (i.e., we have a\nvested interest in long-term, mutualistic strategies). However,\nlet us not forget that during most of evolutionary history,\nhuman lives were characterized by considerable unpredictabil-\nity (e.g., food shortages, injuries, deaths, and diseases). We\nwould contend that recurrent unpredictability in our evolution-\nary history would have created sensitivities to such information\nabout the world and adaptive responses. Just because the world\nis harsh, does not mean an organism gives up. As Jeff Gold-\nblum said in the first Jurassic Park movie, ``Life finds a way'';\none of those ways might be found in the Dark Triad traits.\nAppendix A\nAppendix B\nAppendix C\nTable B1.
