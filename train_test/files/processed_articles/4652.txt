None of the participants were familiar\nwith any of the individuals in the photographs. Results showed that participants matched\nchildren of all ages with their parents at levels significantly greater than chance. Accuracy\nlevels increased with the childs age, and there were no reliable differences between\nmatching to mothers versus fathers. Research in which unrelated observers have rated the\nsimilarity of parents and offspring have found that newborns are more like their mothers\n(McLain, Setters, Moulton and Pratt, 2000), although a bias for related observers to report\ngreater similarity to the father is well documented, especially among the mothers family\n(Alvergne, Faurie and Raymond, 2010). Overall, there is substantial evidence that humans\nare able to detect kinship among parents and children, although the magnitude of the effect\nis relatively weak, with the probability of correct detection ranging from 1.04 to 1.40 times\nbetter than chance across studies (Kaminski, Meary, Mermillod and Gentaz, 2010a).\nHow are humans able to detect whether or not strangers are related? Kaminski,\nDridi, Graff and Gentaz (2009) suggested two possibilities. First, an ability to recognize\nkinship among strangers might have developed because of the potential advantage it would\nconfer in social interactions \u00ad humans are likely to interact differently if they are related, so\na neutral observer who could identify when others were related would be better able to\nanticipate their behavior. A second possibility is that a capacity for detecting kinship\namong strangers could have developed based on systems which evolved to recognize ones\nown kin, an ability which is shared with nonhuman animals and other species (Lieberman,\nThe goal of the present study was to investigate the cognitive processes that\nunderlie the ability of neutral observers to identify kinship among strangers. There is some\nevidence that kinship detection by neutral observers depends on the implicit cognitive\nsystem, meaning that it is fast, automatic, effortless and does not depend on conscious\nresponses to a self-appraisal questionnaire administered after they completed the newborn-\nparents matching task were unrelated to overall performance on the task: Participants found\nmatching newborns with parents to be difficult but responded significantly above chance\neven when they believed they were guessing.\nWe wanted to investigate whether humans ability for kin detection among\nstrangers also depends on explicit cognition. Whereas the implicit cognitive system is\nbelieved to depend on associative, trial-and-error learning, overlap to a considerable extent\nwith cognition in nonhumans, and develop at an early evolutionary stage (Ashby and\nand reasoning and appeared later in evolutionary terms (Dienes and Perner, 1999; Evans,\n2003). Although humans have elaborate cultural behaviors and displays which support\nkinship recognition (Park et al., 2008), we asked whether neutral observers would also use\nrule-based, explicit processing to identify kinship relations when such supports were not\navailable.\nThe hallmark of implicit cognition in humans is the presence of knowledge in the\nabsence of conscious awareness (Dienes and Berry, 1997). Although verbal self-reports of\nawareness have been criticized as susceptible to response bias (Eriksen, 1960; Shanks and\nSt. John, 1994), researchers have developed methods for testing whether participants lack\nKinship detection and implicit-explicit cognition\nmetaknowledge about their own performance according to subjective criteria (see Dienes,\n2008, for a review). The basic idea of these methods is to have participants make\nconfidence ratings about their responses during the task. If responding is based entirely on\nimplicit knowledge, there should be no correlation between accuracy and confidence\nratings (zero-correlation criterion; Chan, 1992), and participants should perform at above-\nchance levels when they believe they are guessing (guessing criterion; Dienes, Altmann,\nKwan and Goode, 1995). By contrast, a positive correlation between confidence and\naccuracy indicates metaknowledge and explicit cognition, as the participant is aware\nwhether or not their responses are likely to be correct.\nWe examined the ability of unrelated male observers to correctly identify pairs of\nmothers and adult daughters. Male observers and adult mother-daughter pairs were used\nbecause to our knowledge, this combination has not been previously studied. On each trial,\nparticipants viewed three photographs (one woman in her early 20s (daughter) and two\nolder women) and were asked to choose the correct mother from the two older women\n(Figure 1). No feedback was provided, and participants gave confidence judgments on each\ntrial on a 1-7 scale (\"no confidence at all\" to \"high confidence\"). We used a measure of\ndiscriminability (d') based on signal detection theory (Macmillan and Creelman, 1991;\nTunney and Shanks, 2003) to assess participants metaknowledge. The advantage of d' is\nthat it provides a measure of participants ability to discriminate whether or not their\nresponses are likely to be correct, based on their subjective state of confidence, that is\nindependent of any response bias they might have (e.g., toward making either relatively\nhigh or low confidence ratings). Assuming that participants would be able to respond more\naccurately than chance, our primary question was whether this performance could be\nattributed to implicit cognition, explicit cognition, or both.\nMaterials and Methods\nColor passport photographs (3.5 cm x 5.0 cm) for 20 women were obtained. All\nwere students enrolled at the University of Minho of European Portuguese ethnicity, and\nprovided similar photographs of their biological mothers, with whom they had all been\nraised. The average age of the daughters was 23.0 years (range = 21-29 years). The average\nage of the mothers was 48.5 years (range = 44-55 years). Photographs were digitized and\nbackgrounds rendered similar via image processing software.\nFifty participants were recruited from the University of Minho community by\nadvertisements on campus. All were male and of European Portuguese ethnicity with an\nstudy would involve viewing a series of photographic triads, consisting of one young and\ntwo older women, and that their task would be to select which of the older women was the\nbiological mother. All received a small gift in return for their participation. When\ndebriefed, none of the participants indicated that they recognized any of the individuals in\nthe photographs.\nStimuli were assembled into triads for display on the computer. In each triad, the\ndaughters photograph was centered at the top of the screen, and photographs of two\nwomen were shown to the left and right at the bottom of the screen. One was the correct\nKinship detection and implicit-explicit cognition\nmother and the other was a distracter. The distracters were obtained by randomly selecting\none photograph from the remaining mothers, such that each mother appeared in two triads,\nonce as the correct choice and once as distracter. The left/right position of the mother and\ndistracter was counterbalanced across triads.\nThe participants viewed a sequence of photographic triads on the computer screen\n(see Figure 1). The experiment was self-paced with no time limit and participants were\nallowed to examine each triad for as long as they wished. For each triad, participants\nindicated their choice of the correct mother (left/right), as well as their confidence that their\nchoice was correct on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = \"not confident at all\"; 7 = \"extremely\nconfident\") on a sheet of paper. No feedback was provided after each response. Participants\nadvanced to the next triad by clicking the mouse.\nFigure 1. Sample photograph triad of a daughter and two possible mothers. Participants\nhad to indicate which woman in the two bottom photos was the biological mother of the\nwoman in the top photo. The correct answer is A.\nTwo sequences of triads were used. Sequence A was defined by randomly ordering\nthe triads, and Sequence B was the reverse of Sequence A. Half of the participants were\nrandomly assigned to each sequence. After the experiment, participants completed a\ndebriefing questionnaire in which they were asked to list the features on which their\nresponses were based.\nKinship detection and implicit-explicit cognition\nResults\nParticipants responded correctly 65.2% of the time overall, which was significantly\ngreater than chance (t(49) = 9.23, p < .001). Accuracy was similar for Sequence A and B,\nwith participants age (r = .12, p = .40).\nTable 1 provides a detailed breakdown of descriptive analyses by participant and\ntriad. Overall, 65% of triads and 38% of participants were associated with above-chance\naccuracy. Significant below-chance performance was not obtained for any triad or\nparticipant. This confirms that overall accuracy levels were significantly above chance, but\nalso heterogeneous across participants and triads, suggesting that some participants were\nmore adept at the task and that some triads were more difficult than others.\nTable 1. Descriptive analyses by triad (n = 20) and participant (n = 50). For each\nparticipant, we calculated the percentage of correct responses across triads, and for each\ntriad, we calculated the percentage of correct responses made by participants. The resulting\nvalues were assessed by exact binomial tests to classify participants and triads according to\nwhether significant correct or incorrect detection was observed (i.e., accuracy deviated\nsignificantly from .50), or random-level detection was observed (i.e., accuracy not\nsignificantly different from .50). SE = standard error.\nTriads n M (SE) Range\nParticipants n M (SE) Range\nFigure 2 (left upper panel) shows the average percentage of correct responses and\nconfidence ratings over the two blocks of 10 triads per session. Accuracy was similar\nHowever, average confidence ratings (Figure 2, right upper panel) were significantly\nvariability of confidence ratings also decreased; averaged across participants, standard\nKinship detection and implicit-explicit cognition\nconfidence decreased and became less variable across the session whereas accuracy did not\nvary across the session.\nFigure 2. The upper left and right panels show the percentage of correct responses and\nconfidence ratings, respectively, averaged across participants, for blocks 1 and 2. Bars\nindicate +1 standard error. The lower panel shows a scatterplot of the percentage of correct\nresponses (vertical axis) and d' (horizontal axis). Each point represents data from a single\nparticipant.\n%Correct\nAccuracy\nConfidenceRating\nConfidence\n%Correct\nd'\nTo assess the relationship between accuracy and confidence ratings we conducted\nan analysis based on signal detection theory (Macmillan and Creelman, 1991). For each\nparticipant, trials were sorted into a 2 x 2 table according to whether or not the confidence\nrating was greater or less than the median for that participant, and whether or not the\nresponse was correct. Trials with confidence ratings equal to the median were omitted. The\ncells in the 2 x 2 table correspond to the frequencies of hits (i.e., high confidence, correct\nKinship detection and implicit-explicit cognition\nresponse), misses (low confidence, correct response), false alarms (high confidence,\nincorrect response), and correct rejections (low confidence, incorrect response). We then\ncalculated d' as a bias-free measure of discriminability using the loglinear method (Hautus,\nAveraged across participants, d' was significantly greater than zero, M = 0.28 (t(49)\nparticipant is able to discriminate whether or not their responses are likely to be correct\n(Kumimoto, Miller and Pashler, 2000; Tunney and Shanks, 2003), this confirms that\noverall, participants had metaknowledge about their performance.\nThe d' scores showed considerable variability across participants, suggesting that\nthere were individual differences in the extent of participants metaknowledge. Figure 2\n(lower panel) shows overall accuracy plotted against d' for individual participants. There\nwas a significant positive correlation between d' and accuracy (r = 37, p < .01), indicating\nthat participants who were better able to discriminate whether their responses were likely to\nbe correct had greater levels of overall accuracy. Across participants, average confidence\nwas correlated with accuracy (r = .29, p < .05), but confidence was not significantly\nAn important question was whether participants who lacked metaknowledge about\ntheir responding showed performance levels that were above chance. Participants were\ndivided into two groups depending on whether their d' values were less than or equal to\nzero. For participants with d'  0 (N = 14), the average accuracy was 61.79%, which was\nsignificantly greater than chance (t(13) = 4.00, p < .01). This result is consistent with\nimplicit processing, because participants who were unable to discriminate whether their\nresponses were likely to be correct still showed above-chance accuracy levels. For\nparticipants with d' > 0 (N = 36), average accuracy was 66.53% which was also greater\nthan chance (t(35) = 8.43, p < .001) but was not significantly different from participants\nwith d'  0 (t(48) = 1.30, p = .20). Taken together, these results provide evidence of\nimplicit processing but also suggest that participants showed greater individual differences\nin terms of their ability to report accurately about their performance than their performance\nper se (see Figure 2, lower panel).\nFor a more rigorous comparison of the variability in d' and accuracy values, we\ntransformed accuracy scores by taking the log odds of a correct response, log(p / (1 \u00ad p)), to\nproduce a measure which is unbounded like d', and then calculated coefficients of variation\n(i.e., standard deviation divided by the mean) as an index of relative variability for both\nmeasures. The coefficients of variation were 2.24 and 0.84 for d' and log-odds correct,\nrespectively, confirming that participants showed greater individual differences in their\nmetaknowledge than their overall accuracy in matching mother-daughter pairs.\nBecause participants confidence ratings decreased across blocks of 10 trials (see\nFigure 2, right upper panel), we checked whether their metaknowledge also decreased by\ncomputing d' values separately for each block. Our analysis showed that d' was\none-tailed). Thus participants ability to report accurately about their own performance\ndeclined over trials. The decrease in d' is linked with the reduction in variability of\nconfidence ratings, noted above. In the second half of the session, participants self-reports\nKinship detection and implicit-explicit cognition\nof their subjective states became more homogeneous across trials and thus were less able to\ndiscriminate between correct and incorrect responses.\nNext we examined the relationship between confidence and accuracy using data\npooled across participants and sorted according to the confidence rating. A positive\ncorrelation between confidence and accuracy would suggest evidence of explicit\nprocessing. Because confidence and d' decreased across blocks, we conducted the analysis\nseparately for blocks 1 and 2. Figure 3 (upper panel) shows the percentage of correct\nresponses for each confidence rating. For block 1, accuracy increased from 50.0%\n(confidence = 1) to 86.5% (confidence = 7), and the correlation was significantly positive\n(r = .90, p < .01). Thus in block 1, participants were guessing when they said so and had\nthe highest accuracy when they were most confident. In contrast, for Block 2 the highest\naccuracy (76.5%) was obtained for confidence rating = 1, and the overall correlation\nbetween confidence and accuracy was not significant (r = .27, p = .56). This analysis\nsuggests that block 1 responses were determined by explicit cognition (positive correlation\nbetween confidence and accuracy), but implicit processes were more influential in block 2\n(accurate performance when guessing and no significant correlation between confidence\nand accuracy).\nFigure 3 (lower panel) shows the relative frequencies of confidence ratings for\nblocks 1 and 2, pooled across participants. In both blocks, ,,5 was the modal response. The\ndistributions were similar overall. The probabilities of ,,2 and ,,3 responses were\nsomewhat greater in block 2, whereas participants were marginally more likely to make a\n,,6 or ,,7 response in block 1.\nKinship detection and implicit-explicit cognition\nFigure 3. The upper panel shows the percentage of correct responses for each confidence\nrating, separately for block 1 and block 2 trials. Data points shown in large type (10pt) were\nsignificantly greater than chance (p < .05). The lower panel shows the relative frequency of\nconfidence ratings for block 1 and block 2 trials.\n%Correct\nConfidence Rating\nRelative Frequency\nConfidence Rating\nFinally we examined the specific cues that participants indicated they used during\nthe debriefing. Overall, participants listed an average of 2.88 features or strategies used to\nsolve the task (SD = 1.62; range = 1-7). The most common feature used was the eyes,\nwhich was noted by 50% of participants. Also commonly reported were nose (30%),\noverall facial features (30%), and facial expression (26%). Correlations of overall facial\nfeatures (r = .29, p = .04) and nose (r = .27, p = .06) with accuracy were significantly\npositive or nearly so whereas those for eyes and facial expression were not significant (all\nr< = .17, all p > = .23). To determine how well use of specific cues could predict accuracy,\nwe conducted a regression analysis. This showed that the best model for predicting\nKinship detection and implicit-explicit cognition\nDiscussion\nOverall, participants responded at levels significantly above chance (62.5%), and\nresults suggest that detection by unrelated male observers of mother-daughter kinship\ndepends on both explicit and implicit cognition. That participants showed metaknowledge\nof their performance suggests evidence for explicit processing. Signal detection analyses\nconfirmed that participants were able to discriminate subjective states relating to more or\nless confidence, and their confidence ratings predicted whether or not the response on a\ngiven trial was likely to be correct. This is the same metaknowledge criterion (d' > 0) that\nhas been used in studies of implicit learning to show that participants are aware, at least to\nsome extent, of the basis of grammaticality decisions in artificial grammar learning\nspecific cues which were significantly associated with higher accuracy also supports the\nview that kin recognition by unrelated observers depends on explicit processing. Those\nwho were relatively successful were able to list the specific features that they used,\nsuggesting that they were consciously aware of what they were doing.\nHowever, other aspects of our results indicate that participants performance\ndepended on the interplay between implicit and explicit cognitive processes. When results\nfrom the subgroup of participants (n = 14) who showed no metaknowledge of their\nperformance (d'  0) were analyzed separately, accuracy was still significantly greater than\nchance (61.2%). This shows that participants were able to respond accurately even when\nthey failed to discriminate and/or report subjective states related to confidence, consistent\nwith implicit processing. Additional evidence of implicit cognition is that whereas accuracy\ndid not change systematically from the first to second trial block, there was a significant\ndecrease in confidence ratings (see Figure 2, right upper panel), as well as a decrease in d'.\nParticipants confidence ratings and metaknowledge of their performance decreased as the\nsession progressed, even though their accuracy did not. When responses were pooled over\nparticipants, there was a strong linear relationship between confidence and accuracy in the\nfirst block, but no systematic relationship in the second block. When subjects said that they\nwere guessing in the first block (confidence = 1), they were (accuracy = 50%; 9 of 18\ntrials). But remarkably, in the second block participants were most likely to be correct on\nnumber of such trials in the second block was small, they were made by 11 participants so\nresults cannot be attributed to one or two responding idiosyncratically.\nThese results show that matching of mother-daughter pairs by unrelated observers\ndepends on both explicit and implicit cognition, and that these processes are independent,\nat least to some degree. Application of criteria used in research on implicit learning (zero-\ncorrelation and guessing; Dienes, 2008) suggests that control shifted from explicit\nprocesses in the first block to implicit processes in the second block. One possible\nexplanation for the decrease in explicit control may be a buildup of proactive interference.\nExplicit cognition is known to depend heavily on working memory (Barrett, Tugade and\nEngle, 2004) which is susceptible to proactive interference (Jonides and Lee, 2006). As\nKinship detection and implicit-explicit cognition\nparticipants viewed more triads, it may have become increasingly difficult for them to\ndistinguish their subjective state from that on previous trials, leading to a decrease in d' and\nconfidence ratings.\nThe self-reported strategy which most strongly predicted accuracy \u00ad overall facial\nfeatures \u00ad did not correspond to a discrete cue but rather a molar pattern of similarity.\nObservers who reported using this strategy were likely aware that they were making an\noverall judgment of similarity without reference to a comparison of specific features. This\ndemonstrates conscious, effortful control over input from an implicit system that indicated\nwhich mother showed greater similarity to the daughter (MacDonald, 2008).\nOur results resemble those from studies of artificial grammar learning (AGL;\nPothos, 2007) which have been widely used as an assay of implicit learning since Rebers\n(1967) seminal work. In a typical AGL paradigm, participants study a list of letter strings\n(e.g., MXRVXT, MXTRRR) which initially may appear random but actually are defined\naccording to a set of complex rules (i.e., artificial grammar). Later, they are given a test in\nwhich they have to classify new strings as grammatical or not. The usual result is that\nparticipants are able to classify new strings accurately but are unable to describe the rules\nof the grammar. However, studies that have obtained confidence ratings concurrently with\nthe AGL task have shown that d' values are significantly greater than zero, indicating that\nparticipants do have metaknowledge of their performance, even though they typically\nrespond at levels greater than chance when they believe they are guessing (Tunney, 2005;\nTunney and Shanks, 2003). Thus, performance in the AGL paradigm appears to depend on\nboth implicit and explicit cognition, similar to results reported here for kin detection.\nThe magnitude of the effect was relatively large \u00ad on average participants classified\n65.2% of mother-daughter pairs correctly, which corresponds to an odds ratio relative to\nchance of 1.87. This is greater than previous studies using newborn-parent pairs, which\nexplanation is that it might be easier to classify adult children rather than newborns with\ntheir parents due to phenotypic convergence \u00ad that is, adult children would likely have\nspent considerable time in the same environment with their parents, which could increase\ntheir physical similarity (Zajonc, Adelmann, Murphy and Niedenthal, 1987).\nAn important question is whether performance on the task depended on a specific\nability to recognize kin relationships in strangers or perceptual processes related to\nsimilarity. That is, perhaps unrelated observers are able to match photographs of children\nwith their parents not because humans have an evolved capacity for detecting kinship via\nvisual cues that are also effective with unrelated conspecifics, but because humans have a\nperceptual mechanism for detecting similarity between complex stimuli in general.\nAlthough it is not possible to give a definitive answer to this question, there are several\nreasons to expect that parent-child matching tasks such as that used here and in other\nresearch with unrelated observers (e.g., Kaminski et al., 2010a; McLain et al., 2000) are a\nvalid method for testing humans ability to detect relatedness. First, there is evidence that\nneutral observers judge similarity in terms of relatedness. Maloney and Dal Martello (2006)\nfound that similarity ratings of pairs of related and unrelated children almost perfectly\npredicted the probability that the pairs would be judged as related by an independent group\nof participants. Because similarity did not vary with age or gender differences, Maloney\nKinship detection and implicit-explicit cognition\nand Dal Martello concluded that when participants were asked to rate similarity they had\nspontaneously elected to judge relatedness, and thus that perceived similarity was\neffectively a graded kin recognition signal. This finding is qualified to some extent by\nDeBruine, Smith, Jones, Roberts, Petrie and Spector (2009), who replicated Maloney and\nDal Martellos (2006) results with photographs of adult siblings, and found that similarity\npredicted kin recognition when age and sex were controlled for, suggesting that similarity\nratings for adult targets convey additional information (related to age and sex). Second,\nKaminski et al. (2010a) found that perceptual similarity, as measured by an image\nprocessing model that has been shown to detect angry faces as accurately as human\nobservers (Gabor Wavelet Filter; Mermillod et al., 2009), was able to correctly predict less\nthan half of newborn-parent pairs. This suggests that kinship detection, while correlated to\nsome extent with perceptual similarity processes, cannot be explained entirely in terms of\nsuch processes. It is also interesting to note that Kaminski, Ravary, Graff and Gentaz\n(2010b) found that later-borns performed better than first-borns in a task in which they had\nto match photos of newborns with their parents. They suggested that because first-borns\ncould have relied on the perinatal association of their mother with younger siblings, they\nwould have been less likely than later-borns to develop alternative methods of kin\nrecognition, for example those based on similarity of facial cues. Overall, these results\nprovide some support for the view that the parent-child matching task with unrelated\nobservers does tap into humans evolved capacity for kinship detection (Lieberman et al.,\nOur results suggest that humans spontaneously apply both implicit and explicit\ncognitive processes when asked to detect relatedness among strangers. Use of explicit\nfunction makes sense because adult humans have a history in which they have likely been\nexposed to situations where they had commented on specific features that were similar\nbetween genetically-related individuals, or observed others making such comments, and so\nit is reasonable to expect that they would approach a task like that in the present study by\nlooking for common features that would identify parent-child pairs. In this regard, it is\ninteresting that the strongest predictor of accuracy in the regression analysis was ,,overall\nfacial features, which implies that omnibus judgments of similarity were more effective\nthan basing choices on any specific feature or set of features. That participants were able to\nreport their use of overall similarity shows that responses were under conscious control,\nand thus the present data suggest that participants were able spontaneously to adopt a\nresponse strategy in which the implicit system worked under control of the explicit system.\nThis is notable because detection of relatedness arguably represents an evolutionarily older\nability compared to other domains in which the interplay between implicit and explicit\ncognition has been studied, such as the AGL paradigm reviewed above, but also skill\nacquisition (Sun, Slusarz and Terry, 2005), serial reaction time (Keele, Ivry, Mayr,\nHazeltine and Heuer, 2003), and sequence learning (Jimenez, Vaquero and Lupianez,\n2006). From an evolutionary perspective, these laboratory paradigms may seem somewhat\ncontrived and far removed from the ancestral conditions which shaped the implicit system.\nEvolutionary psychologists have theorized about how explicit processes may control\nimplicit modules related to functions such as aggression, sexuality, and ethnocentrism,\nwhich are difficult to study experimentally with humans (MacDonald, 2008). By contrast,\nKinship detection and implicit-explicit cognition\nrecognition of kinship by neutral observers may represent an experimental task which\naffords a unique opportunity to observe the interplay between explicit and implicit\ncognition in the laboratory for a system relevant to ancestral social environments.\n"
