As China's gross domestic product (GDP) qua-\n8%, increased air pollution became a detriment to the health\nof its citizens. Seven of the 10 most polluted cities in the world\nare now found in China (1). The history of world indus-\ntrialization has shown that urban economic development has\nbeen accompanied by extensive environmental burdens that\nhave profound consequences on residents' well-being (2\u00ad4).\nBoth short- and long-term adverse effects of air pollution on\nindividual health are well documented in the literature and\ninclude upper respiratory infections, lung cancer, heart dis-\nease, and damage to nerves and the brain (5\u00ad9).\nMost of these studies, however, follow an ecologic design,\nwhich is based on correlations between air pollution in a given\narea and health outcomes at the population level, such as\nmortality rates, rates of specific diseases (e.g., respiratory\nand cardiovascular diseases), and hospital admissions. Indi-\nvidual characteristics are not controlled for even though re-\nsearch has shown that the effect of air pollution depends on\nindividual characteristics, including age, sex, and lifestyle\n(10). As a result, it is critical to adjust for potentially con-\nfounding factors at the individual level (9, 11).\nFurthermore, most studies that have explored the interac-\ntion effect between community economic status and air pol-\nlution on individual health have been limited to Western\nsocieties. Most findings suggest that air pollution has a greater\nimpact on people living in economically disadvantaged com-\nmunities, which may be attributed to higher exposure to air\npollutants, lack of access to health care, and greater suscepti-\nbility to the detrimental effect of pollution (12, 13). It is not\nclear, however, whether such findings can be generalized to\nCorrespondence to Dr. Rongjun Sun, Department of Sociology, Cleveland State University, 2121 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44115\n(e-mail: r.sun32@csuohio.edu).\ncountries that are at a different stage of economic develop-\nment. In addition, few studies have focused on the elderly\npopulation, which is a fast-growing segment in both devel-\noped and developing countries. The elderly are more suscep-\ntible to harm from toxic substances because of their depressed\nimmune systems, existing diseases, and the accumulation of\ntoxic agents in their bodies (14, 15). In this study, based on\na large-scale survey of the elderly in China, we address the\nfollowing questions: 1) Is there an independent effect of air\npollution on the health status of the elderly after individual\ncharacteristics and community economic development are\ncontrolled? 2) How does economic development modify the\neffect of air pollution on health status?\nStudy population\nThis study uses data from the third wave of the Chinese\nLongitudinal Health Longevity Survey (CLHLS) in 2002.\nThe first wave of the CLHLS in 1998, which included only\nseniors aged 80 or more years, covered 22 provinces in\nChina, where more than 85% of the national population\nreside. The respondents were followed up in the second\nyounger elders aged 65\u00ad79 years to the original respondents,\nresulting in a sample size of 15,940. All the respondents in\nthe 2002 wave were interviewed between April and October.\nSpecific timeframes varied by province. Information was\nobtained through in-home interviews. To include the elderly\nof all ages, we use only the third wave of the CLHLS in this\nanalysis. Because pollution data are available for urban\nareas only, where the concentration of pollution is usually\nhigher compared with rural areas, individuals living in rural\nareas are excluded from this analysis. The final sample in-\nfrom 171 cities (refer to Web Appendix 1 for distribution\nof city districts). (This information is described in the first of\n4 supplementary appendixes; each is referred to as ``Web\nAppendix'' in the text and is posted on the Journal's website\n(http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/).) Systematic assessments of\nthe CLHLS indicate that the data quality is high (16\u00ad18).\nHealth outcome variables\nHealth outcomes are measured by 4 variables that reflect\noverall health condition: activities of daily living, instru-\nmental activities of daily living, cognitive impairment, and\nself-rated health.\nThe term ``activities of daily living'' refers to the ability\nto perform any of the following basic personal-care activi-\nties: 1) bathing, 2) dressing, 3) eating, 4) indoor transferring,\n5) toileting, and 6) continence. Because its distribution is\nhighly skewed in this sample, with 66% reporting no dif-\nficulty performing any of these activities, we dichotomize\nit into ``disabled'' (having at least 1 activities of daily living\nlimitation) and ``no limitation,'' with the latter as the reference\ncategory.\nThe term ``instrumental activities of daily living'' refers\nto the ability to perform any of the following items:\n1) visiting neighbors, 2) shopping, 3) cooking, 4) washing\nclothes, 5) walking 1 km, 6) lifting 5 kg, 7) crouching and\nstanding up 3 times, and 8) taking public transportation.\nChoices for each item are ``able to do without help,'' ``need\nsome help,'' and ``need full help,'' with scores from 1 to 3,\nrespectively. The final score of instrumental activities of\ndaily living is the sum of all 8 items and ranges from 8 to\n24, with higher scores indicating more difficulty.\nCognitive impairment is measured by the Mini-Mental\nState Examination (MMSE) (19), which covers the follow-\ning aspects of cognitive functioning: orientation, registra-\ntion, duplication and design, calculation, recall, naming, and\nlanguage. It was adapted to the cultural and socioeconomic\nconditions in China (20). For example, the respondents were\nasked to name as many foods as possible instead of to write\na sentence, which is an impossible task for many members\nof this age group, many of whom are illiterate. For the\ncurrent sample, the reliability of the MMSE scale is high\n(Cronbach's a \u00bc 0.96). The MMSE score in this sample\nranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores suggesting more\nimpairment.\nSelf-rated health has been shown to be an effective mea-\nsure of individual health status (21, 22). It is assessed by\na general question: ``In general, would you say your health\nis 1) very good, 2) good, 3) so so, 4) bad, or 5) very bad?''\nBecause the distribution is skewed (choices of 4 and 5\naccount for less than 15% of the whole sample), we combine\nthe responses into the following 2 categories: ``poor'' (com-\nbiningchoices 3\u00ad5)and ``good'' (combiningchoices 1 and2),\nwith the latter as the reference category.\nCommunity socioeconomic status and air pollution\nmeasures\nCommunity socioeconomic status is measured by the GDP\nper capita of each city district in 2000 (23). To capture a pos-\nsible nonlinear relation between the GDP per capita and in-\ndividual health outcomes, we used the cutoffs adopted by the\nWorld Bank in 2002, which classified countries and regions\ninto 5 categories based on annual income per capita: poverty\nhigh income (>$9,205) (http://siteresources.worldbank.org/\nDATASTATISTICS/Resources/OGHIST.xls). Because the\nhighest city district GDP per capita in our sample was about\ngories: low, medium, and high, corresponding to the 3 lowest\ncategories characterized by the World Bank.\nAir pollution is measured by the air pollution index at the\ncity level, shared by districts within the same city. The air\npollution index is widely used in environmental research as\na measure of general air pollution (24, 25). It assesses the\nconcentration of 3 pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide,\nand inhalable particulates (consisting of particulate matter of\n<10 lm in diameter, carbon monoxide, and ozone) (refer to\nWeb Appendix 2 for details). They are among the most com-\nmon air pollutants found in China as well as other developing\ncountries (26\u00ad28). City air pollution indexes in this analysis\nwere obtained from the Chinese Natural Resources Database\n(http://www.naturalresources.csdb.cn/zy/english/database.asp),\nwhich is managed by the Institute of Geographical Sciences\nand Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sci-\nences. Since the health outcome variables adopted in this\nstudy reflect health status rather than immediate, specific\nhealth responses, we used air pollution indexes for the year\nof 1995 to take into account the chronic or lagged response\nto air pollution. Research has shown that air pollution could\nyield significant mid- or long-term effects on health or mor-\ntality, but it has been overlooked in the literature (29). The\nair pollution index is graded from 1 to 7, with lower scores\nindicating better quality.\nControl variables\nWeather can be an important potential confounder to the\nrelation between air pollution level and health status. In this\nstudy, we added the average temperature of each city in\nJanuary as a control variable.\nWe also control the following variables at the individual\nlevel (30, 31): Demographic variables include age (centered\nat age 65 years), sex, and ethnicity (Han vs. non-Han). In-\ndividual socioeconomic status consists of education (1\u00ad6\nyears of schooling, 7 years or more, vs. none), occupation\n(white-collar occupation vs. others), and perceived family\neconomic conditions (good vs. poor). Family network re-\nsources include marital status (currently married vs. not\nmarried) and the number of living children. Health behaviors\ninclude whether the respondent ever smoked (yes vs. no),\ndrank any alcohol (yes vs. no), and regularly exercised (yes\nvs. no) in the past 5 years. Finally, an index was constructed\nto measure engagement in leisure activities. It is the total\nnumber of 7 activities in which the respondent was regularly\ninvolved: gardening, raising poultry or pets, other outdoor\nactivities, reading, playing cards/mah-jong, listening to\nradio/watching television, and involvement in organized\nactivities. The index ranges from 0 to 7.\nStatistical analysis\nWe applied 2-level hierarchical models to analyze the\ndata (32) to take into account the variability at both individ-\nual and city district levels. Specifically, 2-level linear regres-\nsions were used to model the 2 continuous outcome\nvariables (instrumental activities of daily living and\nMMSE), while 2-level logistic regressions were used to\nexamine the 2 binary outcome variables (activities of daily\nliving and self-rated health) (refer to Web Appendix 3 for\nmore details). Two sequential models were fit for the 4 out-\ncome variables. Model 1 examines the main effects of the air\npollution index and community socioeconomic status on\nhealth outcomes after adjusting for all individual-level fac-\ntors. Model 2 investigates the interaction effects of the air\npollution index with community socioeconomic status. All\nanalyses were conducted by using STATA, version 10.0,\nsoftware (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).\nRESULTS\nTable 1 describes the characteristics of all variables in-\ncluded in this analysis. Tables 2 and 3 show the results of the\nmultilevel analysis of the 2 continuous outcome variables\n(instrumental activities of daily living and MMSE scores) in\nterms of linear coefficients and the 2 categorical outcome\nvariables (activities of daily living and self-rated poor\nhealth) in terms of odds ratios, respectively.\nIn Model 1, for all outcome variables, both community-\nand individual-level factors are included except for the in-\nteractions of air pollution index with GDP per capita. The\nassociations between the air pollution index and all health\nstatus outcome variables are highly significant even after\nGDP per capita and individual characteristics are controlled.\nBecause all the outcome variables measure the likelihood or\nlevel of any health problems, such positive associations in-\ndicate that a higher air pollution index is associated with\na poorer health status. Specifically, a 1-point increase in the\nair pollution index is associated with a 0.32 (95% confi-\ndence interval (CI): 0.19, 0.45) increase in the score of in-\nincrease in the odds of having activities of daily living dif-\nthe odds of reporting poor health. The effect of GDP per\ncapita alone is complex. Although a higher GDP per capita\nseems to be associated with better outcomes for cognitive\nfunction and self-rated health, it is also associated with\nhigher likelihood of having activities of daily living diffi-\nculties and has no significant effect on instrumental activi-\nties of daily living.\nThe interaction effects of the air pollution index with\nGDP per capita are added in Model 2. Most of the interac-\ntions between the air pollution index and GDP per capita are\nsignificant and consistent. Compared with urban areas with\na low GDP per capita, urban areas with a medium GDP per\ncapita often demonstrate a greater effect of air pollution on\ninstrumental activities of daily living, MMSE, activities of\ndaily living, and self-rated health, and urban areas with\na high GDP per capita have an even greater effect. Specif-\nically, compared with low GDP urban areas, a 1-point in-\ncrease in the air pollution index is associated with an extra\nincrease in instrumental activities of daily living in medium\nand high GDP areas, respectively. The corresponding values\nDISCUSSION\nUnprecedented economic development coupled with\nChina's massive population has imposed great strain on its\nenvironment. This study confirms for China what others\nhave found about the harmful effect of air pollution on in-\ndividual health. The health effect of air pollution remains\nsignificant on all the health outcome variables, including\nactivities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily liv-\ning, cognitive impairment, and self-rated health, even after\nindividual characteristics and the level of community eco-\nnomic development are controlled.\nAir Pollution, Development, and Health 1313\nThis study found a consistent interaction effect of air\npollution and GDP per capita at the city level on various\nhealth outcomes. The effect of air pollution, however, is\npositively, rather than negatively, related to the economic\ndevelopmental level of the community. In other words,\nelderly residents living in richer cities are affected more\nby air pollution than are their counterparts in poorer cities.\nThis is contrary to what has been documented in contem-\nporary Western societies, where residents living in poorer\ncommunities or neighborhoods are found to be more af-\nfected by air pollution because of more exposure and higher\nsusceptibility to air pollution (13). For example, in 98 US\ncommunities with higher unemployment rates, the effect of\nexposure to ozone on mortality was also higher (33). As\nanother example, individuals living in lower income areas\nin Ontario, Canada, were more likely to be hospitalized as\nthe result of gaseous air pollutants (sulfur dioxide and ni-\ntrogen dioxide) (34). Similarly in South Korea, the effect of\nair pollution on asthma hospital visits was elevated for both\nadults and children in districts with lower average health\ninsurance premiums (35, 36). The contradiction seems to\nbe related to the meaning of regional socioeconomic devel-\nopment in social settings that are at different developmental\nstages (12). In developed countries, higher socioeconomic\nstatus communities are usually linked with cleaner environ-\nments and greater distance from hazardous materials. Indi-\nviduals who live in these communities tend to benefit from\nan array of socioeconomic advantages. In developing coun-\ntries, however, economically advantaged cities or commu-\nnities usually have elevated pollution and degradation of the\necosystem.\nThe link among community socioeconomic status, pollu-\ntion, and health in developing countries, nevertheless, is\nmore complex than a linear mediating model, where higher\neconomic development is simply assumed to bring more\npollution, which, in turn, leads to poorer individual health.\nThere is an absence of a linear correlation between GDP per\ncapita and the air pollution index among the 735 city dis-\ntricts in this study: Pearson's correlation is negligible,\ndetails). This may be explained by the environmental\nKuznets curve hypothesis, which assumes an inverted\nU-shaped relation between pollutants and income per capita\n(37): In the early stage of industrialization, the rapid growth\nTable 1.

In the later stage, as income has risen\nand the structure of the economy has evolved from a pollut-\ning industrial economy to a cleaner service economy, there\nis a higher preference by people for environmental quality,\nand the resources and technology are available to make\nregulatory measures possible. Thus, pollution gradually reaches\na point from which it starts to decline. Although skepticism\nexists about the robustness of this model (38), there is evi-\ndence that city/regional-level environmental burdens, which\ninclude air pollution such as sulfur dioxide, suspended par-\nticulate matters, and nitrous oxides, exhibit a similarly in-\nThe regional variation in China with respect to socioeco-\nnomic development and environmental management, to\nsome degree, reflects such a pattern.

Pioneer\ncities in environmental protection in China are those with\nhigher GDP per capita, such as Shanghai, Dalian, and\nGuangzhou (28, 41). In contrast, cities in poorer areas, al-\nthough they are catching up in industrial development, still\nfind themselves with limited resources to cope with environ-\nmental problems. Therefore, while less developed areas in\nChina are industrializing and experiencing unmanaged pol-\nlution, the more developed areas are trying to contain or\nreduce damage caused by the unchecked pollution of earlier\nyears. These 2 countervailing processes may have closed the\ngap in air pollution between the more and the less developed\nareas, which is reflected in the lack of a correlation between\nregional GDP per capita and the air pollution index.\nThe discussion above sheds light on why higher commu-\nnity socioeconomic status is not necessarily associated with\nhigher pollution in China. The following provides possible\nexplanations for why community socioeconomic status\nelevates the effects of pollution, or why residents in more\ndeveloped urban areas are more vulnerable to air pollution\nthan are their counterparts in less developed areas.\nFirst, in a historical perspective, this finding is consistent\nwith the environmental risk transition framework: Eco-\nnomic development at its early stage results in increased\ncommunity health risks. Societies at this stage shift environ-\nmental health risks from the household to the community in\nthe form of such things as urban air quality (3). As a result,\nthe severity of health problems continues to rise as income\nincreases, before it levels off at high income levels as in the\nrich countries. There is historical and contemporary evi-\ndence that supports this perspective: rapid economic growth\nimmediately causes health problems, such as disease and\nSecond, what matters may not be just the current level of\nair pollution but also the cumulative or total exposure. The\nhigher effect of air pollution in more developed areas found\nin this study may be attributed to respondents' higher expo-\nsure at an earlier stage of economic development. The\nchronic effect of air pollution has been documented in the\nliterature. Chronic exposure to particulate air pollution, for\nexample, was observed to be related to a range of cardio-\npulmonary health outcomes, including respiratory disease\nand declines in lung functions (8). For some diseases, the\nlatency, or the length of time between exposure and effect,\ncan be as long as 20\u00ad30 years (6). The outcome variables\nexamined in this study are general health conditions, which\nmay be more susceptible to long-term exposure to air\npollution.\nFinally, the magnitude of the effect of air pollution also\ndepends on residents' sensitivity (10). Residents of wealth-\nier areas in Sa\n~o Paulo, Brazil, for example, had a higher\nrelative risk of dying from the effect of particulate matter\nof less than 10 lm in diameter than did those living in more\ndeprived areas (42). This could be because the former are\nprotected from other preventable causes of death and thus\nare more vulnerable or sensitive to air pollution, while the\nlatter, facing multiple competitive causes of death, are less\naffected by air pollution alone. This could also explain the\ngenerally larger effect of air pollution in the more developed\nurban areas in China.\nWe found in the research literature that health outcomes\nfocused primarily on 3 categories: mortality, direct mea-\nsures of morbidity (e.g., respiratory infection, pulmonary\nfunctions, and bronchial responsiveness), and indirect mea-\nsures of morbidity from health care utilization (e.g., hospital\nand emergency room admissions). Although there are stud-\nies that link air pollution with self-rated health (33), we\nfound no study that directly looked at the effect of air pol-\nlution on activities of daily living, instrumental activities of\ndaily living, or MMSE at the individual level.\nError in the measurement of exposure is a serious limitation\nin many air pollution studies (10, 43). This study is no excep-\ntion. Errors may come from both spatial and temporal aspects.\nBecause this study is based on an overall measure of air\npollution at the city level, we could not distinguish the effect\nof each component of the air pollution index. When the anal-\nysis is based on large geographic units, it is unlikely to capture\npollution exposure at a more local level that has a more direct\neffect on individuals (43). Further, the effect may change as\nthe size of study areas varies (44). In addition, we cannot\naccurately assess the exposure duration. It is quite possible\nthat some residents had moved from one community to an-\nother, obscuring the connection between pollution exposure\nand health outcomes. Although the adoption of the 1995 air\npollution index was an attempt to capture the possible lagged\neffect of air pollution on health status in 2002, whether it is an\naccurate measure of exposure is still questionable. Finally, the\ncross-sectional design of this study makes it difficult to estab-\nlish explicitly the time order of causality (9, 45).\nOverall, our study reveals the complexity of the interac-\ntion between air pollution and community socioeconomic\nstatus on health status. The findings suggest that caution is\nwarranted when generalizing from one set of social settings\nto another because community socioeconomic status may\nhave different meanings and implications.\n"
