Much of the excessive sympa-\nthetic drive in these conditions is directed to the kidney,\nwhere it leads to inappropriate sodium retention, renin\nstimulation, and diminished renal function.7 Accumulating\nevidence showed that the sympathetic nervous system\n(SNS) and RAS were overexcited and interacted in car-\ndiovascular pathophysiological conditions mentioned\nabove.8 Therefore, treatment of the elevated SNS and RAS\nactivity would be anticipated to provide significant clinical\nbenefit.\nEffects of renal sympathetic\ndenervation using saline-irrigated\nradiofrequency ablation catheter\non the activity of the renin-angiotensin\nsystem and endothelin-1\nJiayi Lu1*, Zhiyu Ling1*, Weijie Chen1, Huaan Du1, Yanping Xu1,\nJinqi Fan1, Yi Long1, Shaojie Chen1, Peilin Xiao1, Zengzhang Liu1,\nBernhard Zrenner2 and Yuehui Yin1\n Keywords\nRenal sympathetic denervation, renin-angiotensin system, endothelin-1, renal artery ablation, saline-irrigated\nradiofrequency ablation catheter\n1Department of Cardiology,The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing\nMedical University, China\n2Medizinische Klinik I, Krankenhaus Landshut/Achdorf, Germany\n*Jiayi Lu and Zhiyu Ling contributed equally to this article.\nCorresponding author:\nYuehui Yin, Department of Cardiology, Chongqing Cardiac Arrhythmias\nTherapeutic Service Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of\nChongqing Medical University, 76 Linjiang Road, Yuzhong District,\nOriginal Article\nRecently, renal denervation (RDN) using a catheter-\nbased approach, which targets at disrupting renal afferent\nand efferent nerves thereby attenuating sympathetic nerv-\nous activity, is well-known as an innovative method for\ndrug-resistant hypertension.9 The results of the Symplicity\nHTN-1 study (a nonrandomized proof-of-concept study)\nshowed that RDN was a feasible, effective, and safe method\nfor drug-resistant hypertension.10 Subsequently, the\nSymplicity HTN-2 study (a randomized clinical trial)\nshowed BP in the RDN group reduced substantially more\nthan that in medication-only group.11 More recently, longer-\nterm follow-up of the Symplicity HTN-1 and HTN-2 stud-\nies showed RDN offered safe and sustained reduction of BP\nto at least one or two years.12,13 Other than its effect of\nmarked and sustained BP reduction, many studies also\nfound muscle sympathetic nervous activity, renal norepi-\nnephrine spillover, and plasma renin levels decreased in\npatients who underwent RDN.14,15 With this in mind, one of\nthe major underlying mechanisms of RDN on BP reduction\nmay be its decreased effect on the SNS and RAS. However,\ndata related to the details of the effects of RDN on RAS\nactivity are not reported. Furthermore, many studies have\nindicated that angiotensin II is a potent stimulator of\nendothelin-1 (ET-1) production and exerts its hypertensive\neffects via interaction with the ET system.16\u00ad19 Based on\nthese considerations, we carried out a pilot study investi-\ngating the effect of RDN on RAS activity and ET-1, and\nexplored the mechanism of BP reduction by RSD.\nMethods\nAnimal preparation\nAll of experiments were approved by the animal experi-\nmentation ethics committee of Chongqing Medical\nUniversity, following the guidelines of the National\nInstitutes of Health for the care and use of laboratory ani-\nmals. Standard food and water were given throughout the\nexperimental period.\nThis study was performed on 10 healthy adult Chinese\nKunming dogs of either sex, weight between 30\u00ad35 kg. The\nChinese Kunming dogs are larger, more aggressive and\nfierce than beagles, spaniels and mongrels, with naturally\nhigh BP and sympathetic activity, and were the optimal\nexperimental animals used for this study. Eligible Kunming\ndogs were older than three years and had a systolic BP of\nOn the day of experiment, the Kunming dogs were\ngenerally anesthetized with 3% sodium pentobarbital of\n30 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection, followed by a\nmaintenance dose of 5 mg/kg per hour. Penicillin was\ngiven intramuscularly before and after the ablation for the\nprevention of infection. The right femoral artery and vein\nwere punctured under sterile conditions, then 8F and 6F\nsheaths were placed, respectively. An amount of 2000 IU\nunfractionated heparin was administered intravenously\nfor anticoagulation. Blood sampling was obtained from\nright femoral vein and BP was monitored via the right\nfemoral artery by connecting to the pressure transducer\ndevice before and 30 min after the ablation.\nRenal angiogram and renal artery ablation\nBilateral renal angiography was performed using 6F JR4\nJudkins catheter (Cordis Corporation Miami, Florida, USA).\nIf renal artery abnormalities were found or diameters were\nbelow the minimum tolerable size (<4 mm, using the inner\ndiameter of 6F JR4 Judkins catheter as reference), the\nKunming dog was eliminated from the study. After confir-\nmation of eligibility, bilateral RDN was performed with a\nsaline-irrigated catheter (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar,\nCalifornia, USA). The catheter was positioned into each\nrenal artery via femoral access, and then 8\u00ad12 watts radiofre-\nquency energy was applied both longitudinally and rotation-\nally within the main stem of the renal arteries. Up to eight\nablations were performed in each renal artery and ablative\ntime for each point lasted up to 60\u00ad90 s. The temperature of\ntissue-electrode interface was maintained to 40\u00b0C by saline\nirrigated manually during the ablation procedure. After the\nablation procedure, the angiography was redone to evaluate\nthe morphology of renal artery, and also for the documenta-\ntion of vessel patency and intact kidney perfusion.\nBlood sampling assays\nBefore, 30 min, one month, and three months after ablation,\nrespectively, 3 ml of blood sampling to measure plasma\nlevels of renin, angiotensin II, and ET-1 was obtained in\nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) from the right\nfemoral vein. After high speed centrifugation, the blood\nsamples were stored at \u00ad80\u00b0C until assay. The plasma lev-\nels of renin, angiotensin II, and ET-1 were assayed by\nradioimmunoassay.\nFollow-up assessment\nDuring the follow-up period, the condition of all Kunming\ndogs was observed daily.After the ablation procedure of one\nmonth and three months, follow-up assessments were con-\nducted, which consisted of BP measurements via femoral\nartery, bilateral renal arterial angiography, and plasma levels\nof renin, angiotensin II, and ET-1 assay, as described above.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were expressed as mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD).\nRepeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was\nused to compare BP, plasma levels of renin, angiotensin II,\nand ET-1 from baseline to 30 min, one month, and three\nmonths. A least significant difference (LSD)-t test was used\nfor intergroup comparison. The relationship between\nplasma level of renin and angiotensin II, as well as plasma\n534 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\nlevel of angiotensin II and ET-1 were assessed by Pearson\ncorrelation analysis. A two-sided p<0.05 was regarded as\nstatistically significant. All of the statistical analyses were\nperformed with SPSS statistical software (version17.0,\nChicago, Illinois, USA).\nResults\nTen Kunming dogs in preparation for RDN underwent\nrenal angiography, but two Kunming dogs were excluded\nfor anatomical reason (due to dual renal artery system). The\nremaining eight Kunming dogs underwent RDN and com-\npleted three months of follow-up.\nPlasma renin, angiotensin II, and ET-1\nThe changes of plasma level of renin, angiotensin II, and\nET-1 are presented in Figure 1. Repeated measuresANOVA\ntesting showed that plasma levels of renin, angiotensin II,\nand ET-1 were significantly lower after the procedure than\ntensin II, and p<0.001 for ET-1). Compared to those at\nFigure 1.The plasma levels of renin, angiotensin II, and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in eight dogs before and after renal denervation (RDN),\nas shown in (a), (b), and (c), respectively.\nConsistent with the changes of renin, plasma angiotensin II\nand 0.003, respectively).

Mean reductions in plasma renin were\n\u00ad14.6\u00b16.1 pg/ml, respectively. The progressive and sus-\ntained reduction of plasma level of renin was consistent\nwith angiotensin II and ET-1 from baseline to three-month\nfollow-up. Following Pearson correlation analysis, we\nfound that plasma level of renin correlated closely with\nIn addition, There was a significant linear relationship\nbetween plasma level of angiotensin II and ET-1 (r=0.712,\nBP\nmin, one month, and three months after the procedure,\nrespectively. The repeated measures ANOVA test showed\nthat both systolic and diastolic BPs were significantly\nlower after procedure than before procedure (p<0.001 for\nsystolic and p=0.02 for diastolic BP). Following the LSD-t\ntest, at all time points after procedure, both systolic and\ndiastolic BPs were significantly lower than baseline BP,\np=\n0.014 for diastolic BP, respectively; Figure 4). RDN\nreduced BP at 30 min, one month and three months by\nHg, respectively.\nRenal angiogram\nThere was no evidence of renal artery dissection, stenosis\nor other abnormalities occurring in the Kunming dogs\nwhich underwent RDN, either during the procedure and\nfollow-up period. Renal angiographic studies identified\nfocal artery irregularities immediately after radiofrequency\nenergy delivery, none of which were judged as flow limit-\ning at procedure termination (Figure 5(b)). One-month fol-\nlow-up angiograms showed that almost all ablated lesions\nhad disappeared and the renal artery wall had recovered\nsmoothly (Figure 5(c)).\nDiscussion\nThe main findings of the current study were as follows: (a)\nRDN caused a substantial and uniform reduction in plasma\nlevels of renin, angiotensin II, and ET-1; (b) there was a\nsignificant linear relationship between plasma level of\nrenin and angiotensin II, as well as plasma level of angio-\ntensin II and ET-1; (c) RDN utilizing saline-irrigated\nFigure 2.

They showed that renal sympa-\nthetic nerves terminate on various elements in the kidney,\nincluding the vessels, renal tubules, and juxtaglomerular\ngranular cells.20 Based on this consideration, many cardio-\nrenal diseases changing renal sympathetic nerve activity\n(RSNA) could directly influence the functions of inner-\nvated renal effector units. Increases in RSNA raise plasma\nRAS levels by stimulating renin release from 1-\nadrenoreceptors on juxtaglomerular granular cells, decrease\nurinary sodium and water excretion by increasing renal\ntubular water and sodium reabsorption through the nephron,\nand decrease glomerular filtration rate by constricting the\nrenal vasculature: in turn this contributes to the develop-\nFigure 3. Correlation of plasma level of renin and angiotensin II is shown in (a), and correlation of plasma level of angiotensin II and\nET-1 is shown in (b) (r indicates the Pearson correlation coefficient).\nFigure 4. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at baseline, 30 min, one and three months of ablative\nprocedure (*p<0.05 after versus before renal denervation (RDN)).\nMany -adrenoreceptors blockers can reduce plasma\nrenin activity in patients and experimental animals,23,24 and\nare found to be more effective in patients with higher renin\nprofiles.25 Blocking the effect of renal sympathetic nerves\nhas been proved to be an effective way to affect RAS,\naccordingly, blocking the renal sympathetic nerve pathway\nshould present the same effect. Kassab et al. described how\nRDN prevented the transient increase of plasma renin activ-\nity in the obesity-induced hypertension dog model.26\nMoreover, variables of the circulating RAS are undetecta-\nble after bilateral nephrectomy.27 A recent human postmor-\ntemhistologicstudydemonstratedthattherenalsympathetic\nnerves are distributed around the renal artery and a great\nproportion of renal sympathetic nerves had close proximity\nto the lumen-intima interface which should thus be acces-\nsible via renal artery interventional approaches such as\ncatheter ablation.28 Therefore, if endovascular RDN ablates\nthe renal sympathetic nerves in the adventitia successfully,\ntheoretically, the plasma levels of RAS will be decreased\nafter the procedure.As described in the results, RDN indeed\ncaused a uniform decrease in plasma renin and angiotensin\nII. Furthermore, changes of plasma renin and BP in the pre-\nsent study were similar to those in the study of Schlaich\net al.14 which showed that BP reduction was accompanied\nby halving of renin activity after RDN in patients with\nrefractory hypertension.\nRenin is recognized as an activator of RAS and angio-\ntensin II is the most powerful biologically active product of\nthe RAS. Angiotensin II directly constricts vascular smooth\nmuscle cells, enhances myocardial contractility, stimulates\naldosterone production, stimulates release of catechola-\nmines from the adrenal medulla and sympathetic nerve\nendings, increases sympathetic nervous system activity,\nand stimulates thirst and salt appetite.29 Also, many studies\nmentioned in the introduction have indicated that angioten-\nsin II is a potent stimulator of ET-1 production and exerts\nits hypertensive effects via interaction with the ET system.\nIn our study, RDN caused a substantial and uniform\nreduction in plasma levels of renin, angiotensin II, and\nET-1, accompanying a BP decrease. Additionally, there\nwere significant linear relationship between plasma level of\nrenin and angiotensin II, as well as plasma level of angio-\ntensin II and ET-1. These findings suggested that RDN\nattenuating the renal sympathetic activity could decrease\nthe plasma level of renin, which may affect the production\nof angiotensin II and this later could then change the plasma\nlevels of ET-1. Decreased activity of the SNS is one of the\nmajor underlying mechanisms of RDN on the marked and\nsustained BP reduction, but the precise mechanisms that\ncause the fall in BP in the short-term and, in particular,\nlong-term remain elusive. Therefore, our study offered a\nnew angle to explore the therapeutic mechanism of RDN.\nFurthermore, excessive sympathetic drive and inappropri-\nate renin stimulation are hallmarks not only for refractory\nhypertension, but also for chronic heart failure, progressive\nkidney disease, sympathetically mediated insulin resist-\nance: all diseases where sympathetic nervous activity is\nconsidered to play a key role in their development and pro-\ngression. If the observations in this study continue to hold\ntrue in future clinical studies, RDN might be extended in\nthe future to the treatment of various cardiovascular\ndiseases.\nRenal angiogram\nAs we know, a saline-irrigated catheter which has been\nused to ablate cardiac arrhythmia has the advantage of\nbeing less likely to cause thrombus or char formation at the\nablation site. And recently RDN utilizing the saline-\nirrigated radiofrequency ablation catheter has been demon-\nstrated to safely reduce BP in patients with refractory\nhypertension by Ahmed et al.30 Compatible with this clini-\ncal report, in the present study, RDN by saline-irrigated\nradiofrequency ablation catheter decreased BP without\nablation-related complications occurring.Although angiog-\nraphy results showed there were slight vessel irregularities\nFigure 5.The results of angiography before, immediately, and one month after renal denervation (RDN), as shown in (a), (b), (c),\nrespectively.\n538 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\ncaused by radiofrequency energy delivery, the lesions dis-\nappeared at first month of follow-up. Our angiography\nresults were similar to those of the study by Steigerwald\net al.31 which conducted RDN using the Symplicity Catheter\nSystem. In Simplicity trials, renal artery aneurysm or steno-\nsis was seldom seen as judged by computed tomography\n(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiography.\nOf note, the basis of catheter-based RDN is an intended tis-\nsue injury to renal sympathetic nerve fibers caused by heat\ngenerated by radiofrequency energy. Nevertheless, unin-\ntended tissue injury to surrounding vascular structure caus-\ning edema, inflammation and fibrosis is conceivable, as are\nfocal artery irregularities shown in our repeat angiograms\nimmediately after radiofrequency energy delivery.Although\nthe incidence of ablation-related complications seems to be\nlow, unintended tissue injury to surrounding vascular struc-\ntures may increase potential risks. Further, device technol-\nogy minimizing either mechanical or heat related vascular\ntissue injury needs to be explored.\nStudy imitations\nSome limitations should be considered in interpreting the\npresent results. Firstly, norepinephrine spillover measure-\nment may help estimating the activity of the efferent renal\nsympathetic nerve, but our experimental facility did not\nallow using radioisotopes. Secondly, due to sample size of\nthis study being relatively small, follow-up duration was\nrelatively short, and differences between the Kunming dogs\nand hypertensive human subjects exist. Whether RDN could\nstill significantly decrease the plasma levels of RAS and\nET-1 in patients deserves further clinical studies, which will\nbe clarified in the on-going SouthWestern China renal\nArtery sympathetic Nerve ablation study of Hypertension\nhypertensive patients. Furthermore, a previous study32 indi-\ncated that local RAS contents were inhomogeneous and tis-\nsue RAS exerted particularly more important roles than\ncirculating RAS in cardiovascular pathophysiological con-\nditions. However, we investigated the effects of RDN on the\nRAS via determining the changes in circulating levels of\nrenin, angiotensin II and ET-1, therefore, further studies\nabout effects of RDN on tissue RAS are necessary. Finally,\nalthough angiograms showed focal artery irregularities\nimmediately after radiofrequency energy delivery all disap-\npeared after one month, some local tissue damages were not\napparently identified by angiograph. Therefore, it would be\na bit premature to conclude that RDN using saline-irrigated\ncatheter would not cause any ablation-related complications\nand further histological examinations are significant.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, RDN caused a substantial reduction of BP,\nand significantly decreased the plasma levels of the RAS\nand ET-1, which may be implicated in the mechanisms of\nmarked and sustained BP reductions by RDN.\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported in part by research grants from\nthe Science and Technology Committee of Yuzhong dis-\nFoundation for Key Research of Chongqing Municipal\nReferences\n1.
