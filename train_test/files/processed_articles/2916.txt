But the\nrelation between real estate markets and bank distress is hardly analyzed for the\nmajority of economies that do not show clear signs of overheating, such as Germany.\nThe scarcity of empirical evidence on the relation between house prices and bank\ndistress relates to two measurement problems. First, comparable series on house\nprices are often unavailable or mask important regional dierences that inuence\nbanking risks. Also, in addition to price levels, the ratio of rents generated from\nreal estate assets relative to their price may be a more adequate determinant of\nbank risk. But corresponding data on both property prices and rents is usually\neven more dicult to obtain. Second, bank distress is usually not announced to the\npublic. Failures are resolved within banking groups to reduce the risk of negative\nexternalities, which complicates the measurement of bank's risk in most studies.\nWe address both issues by combining information on bank distress collected\nby the Deutsche Bundesbank with regional house price information collected by a\nprivate data provider, Bulwien AG. We suggest a novel multilevel hazard rate model\nas to account more explicitly for the regional dierences of housing markets and the\nrespective location of banks in dierent states of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nWithin this framework, we provide empirical evidence on the relation between real\nestate price developments and bank distress for a large bank-based economy.\nEspecially the regional aspect of house price developments has important impli-\ncations for bank distress. Random region-specic eects contribute signicantly to\nthe PD of banks. Approximately one third of predicted PDs of banks located in the\nnew federal states of Germany is due to this location eect. In contrast, the location\ncontribution to PDs is relatively low and negative for banks headquartered in the\nold federal states.\nThe level of real estate prices is of minor importance for bank distress, both sta-\ntistically and economically. Price-to-rent ratios that indicate the extent to which\ncash ows are expected to be generated from property are in turn consistently\npositively related to bank PDs. Akin to the price-earnings ratio from the nance\nliterature, higher prices per Euro of expected rent generated from real estate as-\nsets may therefore indicate deviations from fundamentals, thereby contributing to a\nlarger probability of banks to face distress. Note, however, that in contrast to price-\nearnings ratios of liquid nancial assets, property rents do not adjust very often.\nThis might limit the ability of our proxy to measure changes in the expectation of\nthe value of real estate assets in the future perfectly.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nDie gegenw\u00e4rtigen Turbulenzen in internationalen Finanzsystemen unterstrei-\nchen die negativen Auswirkungen \u00fcberhitzter Immobilienm\u00e4rkte f\u00fcr die Finanzsta-\nbilit\u00e4t entwickelter Volkswirtschaften.

Real estate market problems are likely to precede\nnancial crises as shown from a theoretical angle in Allen and Gale (2000) and as\nconrmed by historical crises.2 Therefore, it is not surprising that policy makers also\nconsider property prices among other indicators in their nancial sector assessment\nMost studies on the relation between house prices and nancial system sound-\nness share two characteristics. First, they often focus on economies with overheated\nhousing markets. But the vast majority of economies does not exhibit clear signs of\nreal estate prices deviating excessively far from fundamentals. Allen and Gale (2000)\nshow that nancial stability can generally be impaired if (mortgage) credit expansion\ninates (real estate) asset prices, leaving leveraged investors crippled when prices de-\ncline after having departed too far from fundamental levels. Real estate markets are\nparticularly prone to such deviations since supply is xed in the short run and the\nability of banks to verify the riskiness of borrowers' investments is imperfect. Often\nit is only possible with hindsight to determine, which deviations from fundamen-\ntals constitute a bubble. Therefore, it is surprising that only few studies investigate\nthe relation between bank distress and real estate markets when the latter are not\nobviously overheated.\nSecond, most studies take a macro perspective and focus on mortgage loan supply\n(dynamics) following monetary shocks (Bernanke et al., 1994; Kiyotaki and Moore,\nopments might apply in particular to more granular micro and regional levels of\nthe banking system. For example, Case et al. (2000) acknowledge the importance\nof macroeconomic conditions for delinquencies and defaults in general. But they\nemphasize the crucial importance of banks' abilities to score mortgage customers\nto explain most of the variability of distress when there is no turbulence in hous-\ning markets. Related, Calomiris and Mason (2003) study the Great Depression in\nthe U.S. at the individual bank level and nd that distress is triggered partially\nby fundamentals and partially by panics. In line with Case and Shiller (1996), they\nemphasize the importance of avoiding the aggregation of fundamentals, which might\ncamouage critical regional or sectoral shocks.\n1M.Koetter@rug.nl (M.

We measure\nbank distress at the individual rm level and account explicitly for local hetero-\ngeneity across real estate markets to which banks are exposed. Both issues appear\nto constitute hurdles in the existing literature due to two diculties. The rst re-\nlates to the valuation of real estate assets taking into account regional dierences.\nThese assets are heterogenous and therefore it remains unclear to what extent price\nhouse price-to-rent ratios. Similar to price-earnings ratios in the nance literature,\nthey reect expectations on cash ows to be generated from holding real estate\nassets. This ratio is better suited to indicate deviations from fundamentals if ex-\npectations are excessive, however, corresponding price and rent data for comparable\nassets is usually absent. We use annual information on real estate prices and rents\nin 125 German cities consistently collected by the data provider Bulwien AG. Price\ndevelopments are dierent across Germany's regions due to structural disparity in\neconomic activity and most likely may inuence bank distress dierently. We con-\nstruct both price levels and price-to-rent ratios at the German state level, thereby\ntaking into account regional dierences.\nThe second challenge most studies face concerns the measurement of bank dis-\ntress. Usually, information on bank distress is not publicly available. We have access\nto the bank distress database assembled by the Deutsche Bundesbank. Therefore, we\ncan directly estimate probabilities of distress (PD) conditional on bank's exposure\nto the real estate market and other bank traits. Banks with larger exposures may be\nmore experienced in real estate lending and possess therefore superior screening and\nmonitoring skills in this business segment that reduce their PD. In turn, an explicit\nfocus on this line of business might imply low risk diversication and could thus\nresult in systematically higher PDs. We are able to test these competing hypotheses\nexplicitly in this paper.\nMethodologically, we aim to advance beyond previous bank hazard studies of\napplying a multilevel mixed-eect discrete choice model to identify the impact of\nregional housing price developments on the riskiness of German banks. Instead of\nmerely including macroeconomic conditions as controls in the hazard estimation\n(Nuxoll et al., 2003), we specify random region-specic eects. This allows us to\ndissect the contributing factors to predicted bank-specic PDs into a random re-\ngional component exogenous to bankers and a part attributable to bank-specic\ncharacteristics.\nOur results conrm that real estate markets aect bank distress. In particular\nprice-to-rent ratios signicantly increase bank PDs. House price measures are signif-\nicantly independent of other regional macroeconomic characteristics. The random\ncontribution to bank distress due to location in the new federal states is positive,\nwhile it is negative for banks located in the old states. Larger exposures to mort-\ngage lending amplify both positive price-to-rent ratio and negative price level eects.\nNegative price level coecients indicate a 'collateral' eect. But substantially larger\nmagnitudes of positive price-to-rent ratio coecients highlight the relative impor-\ntance of this indicator to assess bank stability.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. We review existing theo-\nretical and empirical literature on the relationship between real estate prices and\nthe soundness of the nancial sector in section 2. Section 3 outlines our empirical\nmethodology, a multilevel mixed-eect binary choice model, and describes the data.\nWe discuss estimation and robustness checks in section 4. Section 5 concludes.\n2 Real estate prices and bank distress\n2.1 Real estate prices\nIn a frictionless world, real estate can be priced just as any other asset by discount-\ning expected cash ows generated from rental payments. Cash ows are inuenced\nby demand and supply of real estate assets, which in turn depend on macroeconomic\nfundamentals, such as population growth, real income and wealth, and interest rates.\nReal estate prices would then reect economic cycles (Higgins and Osler, 1999). But\nthis relationship is unlikely to hold perfectly for three reasons. First, real estate con-\ncerns non-standardized assets that dier considerably regarding quality and that\nare by denition regionally segmented. Second, the absence of central trading places\nimplies that real estate prices are not generated with perfect information. Conse-\nquently, trading usually involves price negotiations that are characterized by a lack\nof transparency and high transaction costs. As a result, real estate markets are less\nliquid compared to nancial markets. Third, relatively long construction lags of real\nestate hinder the match of demand and supply for real estate (McCarthy and Peach,\n2004). Due to these particularities, real estate prices are prone to deviate from their\nfundamental values, which implies the potential to cause turmoil in nancial sys-\ntems. Hilbers et al. (2001) survey a number of studies that theorize on the mechanics\nof such bubbles, which are primarily driven by a combination of constrained real es-\ntate supply in the short run, lenders' limited ability to assess project risks, and\nherding behavior of investors (Allen and Gale, 2000).\nEmpirical work on the relation between real estate prices and banking stability is\nplagued by a number of factors that relate to measurement problems of the former.\nHilbers et al. (2001) use a probit model to estimate the likelihood of a nancial crises\nas dened in Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) conditional on country characteristics\nand the real residential property price index. They report a positive relation between\nhousing prices and crises for only two countries. Partly, this may reect measurement\nproblems of property prices that hamper international comparisons due to dierences\nacross countries in terms of real estate nancing schemes, tax laws, or regulation\nregarding the use of real estate as a collateral. Alternatively, some studies argue that\nproperty price levels contain only limited information regarding deviations from the\nfundamental value. Ayuso and Restoy (2006) present a model of (dis-)equilibria in\nreal estate markets emphasizing the role of real estate price-to-rent ratios. High\nratios indicate high, potentially too high, expectations of investors regarding the\npossible cash ows to generate from the asset, i.e. rents and terminal value. In a\ncompetitive market, homeowners will then sell property and rent instead. Higher\nsupply of property will reduce prices while increasing demand for leased space will\nincrease rents, thereby reducing price-to-rent ratios. However, if expectations on\neither cash ows or terminal values are exuberant, this will entail higher price-to-rent\nratios, which therefore serve as better indicators of overheating compared to levels\nestate markets in Spain and the UK on the order of 20 and 30 percent, respectively. In\ncontrast to McCarthy and Peach (2004), who conclude on the basis of a price-to-rent\nmodel for the U.S. that real estate markets were not overheated, Ayuso and Restoy\n(2006) report that U.S. property was also overvalued by 10 percent. Note, that we\ndo not investigate in this paper if German real estate markets are in equilibrium or\nnot. Instead, we want to test if house prices inuence bank distress even if there are\nno obvious signs of a real estate bubble. To this end, the previous literature shows\nthat price-to-rent ratios, whether in equilibrium or not, most likely contain more\nrelevant information to predict bank distress than prices per se.\nThe deviating ndings of Ayuso and Restoy (2006) and McCarthy and Peach\n(2004) with respect to the valuation of real estate markets may be due to the ne-\nglect of accounting explicitly for regional dierences of property prices. As shown in\nCalomiris and Mason (2003), this is crucial to explain the nancial crisis in the U.S.\nin the 1930s. More recently, Holly et al. (2007) developed a spatio-temporal model\nof housing prices for the U.S. and report ndings that corroborate the importance to\naccount for regional dierences. They demonstrate that after accounting for spatial\neects, four U.S. states suered from overvalued property markets.\nRegional dierences are relevant for the German economy, too. Figure 3 in the\nappendix depicts both the level of house prices and the corresponding price-to-rent\nthat, on average, real estate price levels have declined in Germany. Especially in the\nnew states both price levels and price-to-rent ratios have deteriorated substantially,\nfor example by approximately one third in Saxony. To some extent this price dete-\nrioration may reect a substantial increase in supply of real estate in the new states\ndue to favorable depreciation rules and tax breaks provided to investors renovating\nexisting or constructing new property. Another reason is related to weak demand.\nWhile population growth in old federal states was 1.7 percent between 1995 and\n2005, the population in the new states shrank by 5.5 percent. Note again that we\ndo neither intend to estimate equilibrium real estate prices, nor do we argue that\ndeclining real estate prices indicate a return to fundamentals. Instead, the present\nsample allows us to analyze the relation between bank distress in an environment of\nconstantly deteriorating real estate values. Evidence on the ability of banks to cope\nwith declining prices therefore complements studies investigating bank stability in\ntimes of soaring real estate prices. Our sample permits analysis of the relevance of re-\ngional real estate markets for bank distress while avoiding well-known measurement\nproblems related to both measures.\n4Clearly, the determination of equilibria in real estate markets is a subject in it's own right,\nwhich is beyond the scope of our paper. In fact, the described characteristics of real estate imply\ncomplex feedback dynamics between the supply of mortgage credit and houses as well as respective\ndemand schedules. Here, we focus on the prediction of bank PDs rather than the determination\nof house prices and consider house prices as given based on the rejection of bivariate causality\nbetween house prices and bank credit in Hofmann (2004).\n2.2 Exposure and distress\nThe at times sharp downturn in real estate prices in Germany's states may aect\nbanks both directly through the decline of collateral value and indirectly through\ndeteriorating nancial positions of bank clients, for example households. Intuitively,\na larger exposure of a bank to the real estate sector renders it more likely to be\naected by real estate market uctuations. The exposure of banks to the real es-\ntate sector can take many dierent forms (Hilbers et al., 2001), such as lending to\ncustomers for real estate purchases (often collateralized), or lending to non-bank\nintermediaries that engage in real estate lending.\nSuch links are obvious for specialized mortgage banks. Empirical studies therefore\noften focus on the performance and soundness of specialized intermediaries such as\nthrifts (Guo, 1999; Gan, 2004), savings and loan associations (Harrison and Ragas,\never, Davis and Zhu (2005) point out that non-specialized banks are also exposed\nto uctuations in the real estate market. Many credit lines extended to the various\nsectors of the economy (e.g. manufacturing) are based on a real estate collateral, for\nexample commercial property owned by the borrower.5 Therefore, not only nancial\ninstitutions specialized in mortgage lending are potentially inuenced by negative\ntrends in the real estate market but also universal banks.\nPrevious studies on German bank distress do not consider specialized mortgage\nbanks (Kick and Koetter, 2007) and failure studies on specialized banks elsewhere do\nnot explicitly investigate the relation with regional real estate prices.6 But account-\ning for both specialized and universal banks is particularly relevant in Germany's\nbanking system (Hackethal, 2004). Universal banks are not restricted in their scope\nof business activities and thus also engage in real estate lending. On average, the\nshare of mortgage loans of all credit extended for ve or more years by universal\nTable 1: Number of banks, distress events and exposure to housing loan market\nNumber of banks Distress events Housing loan\nNew states Old states Total (number) share (%)\nNote: New states are former states of the German Democratic Republic that joined the Federal\nAt the same time, Figure 1 underpins the importance of specialized banks in\nGermany's nancial system. While only 75 out of a total of 3,571 banks in our\n5Real estate markets can also inuence the stability of banks via asset backed securities (ABS) in\nthe trading book. This creates a link between property values and distress of nancial institutions\nthat are not directly exposed to mortgage lending. While we control in the hazard estimation for\nsecurities hold by banks, data to identify separate investments in ABS is not available.\n6Nuxoll et al. (2003) species only regional macroeconomic variables as a catch-all control.\nsample are classied by the Bundesbank as specialized mortgage banks, their share\nof total assets vividly illustrates the importance of these intermediaries. Given the\nhistorical deterioration of property prices, we hypothesize that increasing real estate\nprice levels reduce bank PDs since they increase the value of collateral and enhance\nhousehold wealth. However, Hilbers et al. (2001) emphasizes that the appropriate\nassessment of the present value of real estate projects is notoriously dicult. Given\nthat previous studies argue that rising price-to-rent ratios are indicative of increasing\nrisks due to departures from fundamental values, we hypothesize in turn that price-\nto-rent ratios are positively related to bank PDs.\nFigure 1: Decomposition of total assets across dierent banking groups in Germany\nTotal assets in millions of Euro\nSource: Deutsche Bundesbank\nCommercials Savings\nCooperatives Mortgage\nOur second hypothesis relates to the inherent regional nature of both real estate\nand banking markets. Most banks engage in local lending relations and therefore\nwe assign banks to regions based on the location of their headquarters.7 We thus\nevaluate the impact of housing price developments at the local level on the PDs of\nindividual banks. We separate the impact of developments in the housing market\nfrom the aggregate, random impact of other state-specic factors and test for it's\nsignicance to predict PDs.\nThird, we hypothesize that intermediaries concentrating in mortgage lending\ndevelop expertise and possess superior skills to assess the real estate values and\nrisks. We test below if the eect of house prices on bank distress diers signicantly\nbetween banks with and without large exposures to real estate lending.\n7While realistic for the vast majority of commercial, cooperative, and savings banks, which\noperate locally, this assumption may not hold for large commercial banks. We test below if results\nremain qualitatively unchanged when excluding the latter.\n3 Methodology\nTo estimate the probability of bank distress (PD), most studies employ a logistic\nregression model.8 The log odd's ratio form of a standard logistic model is:\nlog\nPDijt\n=  + Xijt\nwhere PDijt\n= Prob(Yijt\n, D) is the probability that the bank i located in\nstate j will encounter a distress event at time t conditional on the set of explanatory\nvariables, Xijt\nis a vector of bank-specic explanatory variables,9 D represents a\nvector of time and banking group dummy variables, and ,  and  are parameters\nto estimate. The intercept parameter  in equation (1) controls for the logarithm\nof the probability ratio if all explanatory variables Xijt\nare simultaneously equal to\nzero.10 An important assumption in this model is that the intercept parameter is\nconstant for all banks. This reects the so-called independence of irrelevant alter-\nnatives (IIA) property of the simple logit model. It entails that odd ratios remain\nconstant regardless of the number of possible events analyzed.\nHere, we estimate the relationship between housing prices at the German state\nlevel and the riskiness of individual banks. This implies a multilevel hierarchy clus-\ntering: banks are nested within states, for which we have aggregate information on\nhousing prices. Consequently, the standard IIA across subjects is likely to be violated\nwithin the clusters. Ignoring this inter-cluster dependence diminishes the variance of\nestimated parameters and overstates their signicance (Hox, 2002). In addition, the\ninterdependence gives raise to the so-called spatial autocorrelation problem. This\nproblem is more severe than time series autocorrelation since not only the standard\nerrors of the parameters are biased in the presence of spatial autocorrelation, but\nparameter estimates are also inconsistent.\nTo account appropriately for state-specic eects, we employ a multilevel mixed-\neect binary choice model.11 The existence of spatial clusters provides additional\ninformation on economic processes operating at dierent hierarchical levels. The\nmultilevel method extends the conventional econometric techniques to handle such\na dependence and exploits the information about economic relationships at dierent\nlevels. In our setup, we measure how large the state-level variation across bank\ndistress events is in comparison to the bank-level variation. Thereby, we can assess\nwhich part of the state-level variation can be explained by the variation of housing\nprices across German states and how it relates to the exposure of banks to the\n8Kick and Koetter (2007) test various limited dependent variable models to estimate PDs.\n9We use nancial accounts data to construct CAMEL measures (C-capital adequacy, A-asset\nquality, M-managerial quality, E-earnings, and L-liquidity), which we discuss below.\n10Since CAMEL indicators are dierent from zero, we take the dierence of Xijt\nfrom sample\nmeans before estimating the model(s). Slope coecients  remain unaected, but the intercept \nrepresents the baseline hazard indicating the PD for a bank with an average CAMEL prole.\n11These models are frequently used when the micro data is clustered, for example students nested\nin schools, employees in rms, or cities in states (see Hox, 2002 for a textbook exposition and Guo\nand Zhao, 2000 for a survey of applications in the various elds of social science).\nmortgage business. To relax the restrictive assumptions present in equation (1), we\nextend the model by assuming the intercept to be state-specic:\nlog\nPDijt\n= j\n+ Xijt\nj\n=  + uj\nThis is a random eect logistic model in which the intercept parameter for the in-\ndividual bank is  + uj\n, where uj\nu\n). The random intercept uj\nrepresents\nthe combined eect of all omitted state-specic time-constant covariates that cause\nthe banks located in that particular state to be more or less prone to distress than\npredicted by the mean probability of distress for the whole sample (). The random\neect model is an example of a broader class of generalized linear mixed eect mod-\nels.12 The variation of the intercept at the state-level can be modeled as a function\nof a vector of state-specic covariates Zj\n, in which case the model is extended to:\nlog\nPDijt\n= j\n+ Xijt\nj\n=  + Zj\n+ uj\nIn this specication, the impact of state-specic factors Zj\nis measured by the pa-\nrameter  and can be interpreted as systematic eects inuencing the baseline bank\nhazard at the state-level. In our setup, the state-specic factor is the housing price\nmeasure for individual German states.\nIt is important to notice the dierence between the specication where housing\nprice variables are specied as additional explanatory variables on the right hand\nside of the simple logit specication and the random eect formulation (3a-3b). The\nlater introduces more exibility by assuming state-specic random heterogeneity,\ni.e. state-specic factors apart from housing price changes that might be impor-\ntant in predicting distress probabilities. The reduced form of the structural general\nmultilevel mixed-eect logistic model (3a-3b) is given by:\nlog\nPDijt\n=  + Xijt-1\n+ uj\nwhere SH is the percentage share of real estate loans in the bank's total long-\nterm loans, HP and HPR are the logarithms of housing prices and price-to-rent\nratios (the state-specic factors), respectively.13 Specication (4) allows us to test the\ncompeting hypotheses outlined in section 2. First, the coecients 1\nmeasure\nthe relative impact of housing price levels and price-to-rent ratios, respectively, on\nbank PDs. Second, the random state eect uj\nand its variance 2\nu\nallow us to compare\nthis model to the traditional, simple logit specications and, hence, to evaluate the\nimportance of accounting for state-specic inuences on bank risk. Third, interaction\nterms with bank's exposure to the housing market SH allow us to test whether\nthe impact of the two housing price indicators changes with the degree of bank\ninvolvement into the real estate market. The coecients 3\nshow the impact\nof housing prices and price-to-rent ratios on the likelihood of bank distress due to a\npercentage point increase of its exposure to the real estate loans market.\n12These are called mixed eects models since they contain both xed () and random (j\n) eects.\n13We describe all data in the next subsection.\nWe combine three dierent databases to evaluate the impact of housing price uc-\ntuations on the riskiness of German banks: nancial accounts, a distress database,\nand a commercially provided set on real estate prices for 125 German cities.\nFinancial accounts We use Bundesbank data on banks balance sheets, income\nstatements, the credit register ('Kreditnehmerstatistik'), and audit reports for the\nto predict bank distress we\nfollow the convention in the bank hazard literature and select proxies for banks'\ncapitalization, asset quality, management skills, earnings, and liquidity (CAMEL)\nto predict bank PDs. Since the potential number of proxies is very large and lacks\nspecic theoretical priors, we use a selection technique suggested by Hosmer and\nLemshow (2000). We generate a list of around 150 potential CAMEL covariate\ncandidates. Based on individual explanatory power, we select around 50 covariates\nthat are tested with stepwise logistic regressions within each CAMEL category.\nStepwise regression and economic signicance result in the nal vector of CAMEL\ncovariates. Table 2 provides descriptive statistics.\nTable 2: Mean values for CAMEL covariates\nDistress\nCAMEL covariate No Yes Total Dierence\nReserves c1\nEquity ratio c2\nRisky loans a1\nOBS activities a2\nCustomer loans a3\nCost eciency m1\nReturn on assets e1\nLiquidity l1\nNote: All variables are in percentage terms.

The next three\nvariables capture bank asset quality, including o-balance sheet activities. The larger\nthe value of these indicators, the lower is the asset quality of a bank. We expect a\npositive coecient for these covariates. The management quality variable is approx-\nimated by the level of bank-specic cost eciency obtained using stochastic frontier\nanalysis (SFA) (see also Wheelock and Wilson, 2000; Koetter et al., 2007). Given the\nheterogeneous sample of banks (commercial, savings, cooperative and specialized)\nwith dierent types of technological frontiers, we measure the cost eciency using\nthe latent class frontier approach.15 This approach remains agnostic as to which\n14Due to missing observations regarding CAMEL covariates and using one year lags in the hazard\nestimation, the number of observations decreased to 22,419 observations.\n15See Bos et al. (2008) for the importance to account for heterogeneity and Koetter and\nPoghosyan (2008) for further details on the latent class frontier model.\nbanks are allocated to which technology regime. Rather than choosing a priori an\nultimately arbitrary allocation, we condition group membership probabilities on the\nbank's mortgage loan share and an indicator variable capturing classication ac-\ncording to the Bundesbank. The appendix provides technical details of the latent\nclass stochastic eciency frontier model used to obtain the bank-specic eciency\nscores. We expect a negative coecient in front of this variable, since banks with\nbetter managerial skills and expertise are expected to be less prone to distress. The\nlast two variables measure earnings and liquidity of banks. Stronger earnings should\ndecrease distress probabilities. The impact of liquidity is ambiguous. More liquidity\nmight mean that banks have more free resources at their disposal to alleviate dis-\ntress. Alternatively, it may imply an inecient allocation of resources to low-yield\nassets that contributes to the distress.\nDistressed events CAMEL covariates are specied in the hazard rate model to\nestimate bank-specic PDs. In contrast to most failure studies, we use data assem-\nbled by the Bundesbank recording distressed events among German universal and\npursuant to the credit act and guidelines issued by the Federal Financial Supervi-\nsory Authority (BaFin). The data comprise obligatory notications from banks in\nline with the credit act, compulsory notications about losses amounting to 25 per-\ncent of the liable capital, a decline of operational prots by more than 25 percent,\nor more direct measures forwarded by the BaFin, for example ocial warnings to\nthe bank CEO, orders to restructure operations, restrictions to lending and deposit\ntaking, dismissal of the bank CEO as well as bank takeovers and enforced closures.\nThe regional dispersion of bank distress is high and represents an important aspect\nthat must not be discarded neither regarding real estate price developments nor\nregarding distressed events.16 We suspect that a considerable part of bank PDs is\nattributable to region-specic eects, which the bank can hardly inuence in the\nshort run. Specically, the development of housing prices discussed next and the\nwell-known persistence of structural deciencies lead us to expect that individual\nbank PDs are positively inuenced by a bank's location in one of the new states.\nReal estate Real estate prices and rents are obtained from the data provider\nBulwien AG. The dataset contains annual information on housing prices and rents\nexisting house prices and rents to generate aggregate state-level indices.18 ANOVA\nestimations shown in the appendix corroborate the idea of aggregation since we\nnd that state-level housing price variation is relatively large in comparison to the\ncity-level variation within the states.19 The evolution of the state-level price and rent\nindices is shown in Figure 3 in the appendix. House price levels decline continuously,\nbut both levels and dynamics dier across states. A similar picture emerges from the\ndescriptive statistics for price-to-rent ratios. Note, however, that some states, such\n16Distress frequencies per state and year in addition to Table 1 are available upon request.\n17Note that rents do not change frequently, mostly when tenants change. Therefore, rental prices\nmay not fully reect faster and more frequent expectation changes of future real estate prices. To\nsome extent this concern is mitigated by the fact that rental prices per city are averages, thus\ncovering a sample also including vacated, and hence rent-adjusted, premises in a given year.\n18We also use data on new house prices and rents for robustness checks. The latter usually\nexclude energy cost, which dier at times across regions, too.\n19City-specic eects in equation (4) are infeasible since banks also operate outside the cities\nwhere they are headquartered. Furthermore, this would neglect most banks in the industry.\nas Bremen, Baden-Wurttemberg, or Hesse, exhibit price-to-rent ratios that increased\nprior to 2000. Hence, this measure seems to contain additional information.\nOur empirical estimation strategy is to start from the simplest multilevel mixed-\neect logistic specication, which we label Model 0, and to augment it incrementally\nto more general models and test their validity using likelihood ratio (LR) tests and\nthe Akaike information criterion (AIC).\nTable 3: Multilevel mixed-eect logit model specications\nState eect (uj\n) \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\nHP \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\nHPR \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\nLR test (p-value)\nNote: 22,419 observations. Time- and group-specic eects included. \u00d7 indicates the variables in-\ncluded in each of the specications. LR test is not applicable for Models 1 and 2. Lower Akaike\nInformation Criterion (AIC) indicate preference for Model 2.\nTable 3 displays model specications and according test results for the set of\nmodels under consideration. First of all, the comparison of the simplest multilevel\nmixed-eect logistic specication Model 0 to an ordinary logistic model employed\nin previous studies provides unambiguous support for the multilevel specication.\nThis nding corroborates our prior that, even after controlling for the impact of\nbank-specic CAMEL covariates, there still remains a substantial state-level random\nvariation of bank distress. This variation might be related to various state-specic\ncharacteristics, which would be neglected if we were to follow the conventional stream\nof the literature by modeling bank distress using a simple logistic specication. Our\nobjective now is to explore the extent to which the state-specic heterogeneity can\nbe described by regional developments in the real estate market.\nSecond, including house price levels alone in Model 1 does not improve the model\nt as indicated by the LR test. In contrast, the specication of price-to-rent ratios in\nModel 2 is supported on grounds of both the LR test and the information criterion\n(AIC). While Models 1 and 2 are not nested, thus prohibiting the former test, the\nlower AIC for Model 2 supports the importance of price-to-rent ratios. This suggests\nthat especially this proxy for deviations from the fundamentals is of importance for\nbank distress. This is corroborated by a comparison of the specication with both\nratios and levels (Model 3) to a specication including only the former (Model 2).\nThe relative power of the former model does not improve signicantly relative to\nModel 2 and the LR test conrms the lack of the signicant improvement. This\nnding implies that the level of real estate price indices alone contributes only little\nto explain the state-specic random variation in PDs, as opposed to the price-to-rent\nratios.\nThe most general specication of equation (4) interacts both housing price indi-\ncators with the banks' share of mortgage loans in long term lending (Model 4). This\nspecication outperforms all previous models in terms of t as indicated by both\nthe LR test statistics and the AIC. Hence, housing prices in levels appear to add to\nthe information on bank distress of those intermediaries, which are involved more\nactively in real estate lending. Therefore, we use Model 4 as a reference specication\nin our further discussion.\nThe multilevel mixed-eect logit estimation results for the reference specication\nModel 4 are displayed in the rst column of Table 4. The CAMEL covariates are\nsignicant and exhibit the expected signs. In line with the previous evidence, greater\ncapitalization, higher managerial quality and earnings decrease individual bank PDs.\nInferior asset quality and accumulation of low-yield liquidity, in turn, increase the\nhazard of bank distress.\nConsider rst the relation between distress and price-to-rent ratios. The coe-\nis signicant and positive, suggesting that larger acquisition costs of real\nestate per square meter relative to the rent extractable from these assets increase\nthe riskiness of banks. To some extent, this result is in line with the 'disaster my-\nopia' hypothesis advanced in Herring and Wachter (1999). Disaster myopia entails\nin general that risks might be systematically underestimated if sudden corrections\noccur only infrequently. Intuitively, the likelihood of sudden correction is increasing\nwith higher deviation from fundamentals. The latter is the result of the willingness\nof investors to pay more per square meter of real estate, since these investors expect\nhigher returns from either rents or asset values in the future. While price levels in\ngeneral are low in Germany, these expectations might still indicate at any given\npoint in time overly optimistic expectations that banks are willing to nance.\nRelated to our third hypothesis on exposure, this impact is signicantly more\npronounced for banks largely involved into real estate lending. The positive addi-\ntional eect on PDs of banks with relatively larger exposures (4\n) then suggests that\nespecially the risk of these intermediaries increases if expectations of returns from\nreal estate investments are too high. Put dierently, large existing mortgage loan\nexposures interacted with rising, perhaps unfounded, expectations increase bank\nPDs, potentially reecting a systematic underestimation of real estate market risks.\nSince price-to-rent ratios have consistently declined since 1997 in (almost) all states,\nthe estimated positive coecients for 2\nindicate that declining expectations\nregarding the future value of real estate assets reduced the riskiness of German\nbanks.\nTable 4: Multilevel mixed-eect logit estimation results\nVariable Coe.

We nd no signicant\nimpact of housing prices per se on the PD of banks that are not involved in real\nestate lending (insignicant 1\n). However, the impact is signicantly negative for\nbanks extending some part of their loans to this market (negative and signicant\n). The negative impact of housing prices increases for this set of banks and can\nbe explained by an increase in the values of the real estate collateral these banks\nhold. Therefore, even if the customers are unable to repay their debt, the bank will\nbe able to compensate the losses by liquidating the collateral at a higher price. This\nis in line with a 'collateral channel' of housing price transmission to balance sheet\npositions of banks and their clients, which is also documented to propagate credit\ncycles through the nancial accelerator mechanism (Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997).\nFinally, note that our hypothesis of the relevance of accounting more explicitly\nfor the regional nature of real estate markets is supported throughout. Estimates of\nthe intercept , which can be interpreted as a baseline hazard rate, are signicant\nat the one percent level.20 The signicant variation of the state-specic random part\nin the overall intercept, denoted by 2\nu\n, supports the hypothesis that bank distress\nis aected by its location even after netting out the impact of regional real estate\nprice developments.\nWe investigate the implications of some important assumptions we made with re-\nspect to the validity of our previous conclusions. First, in evaluating the impact\nof state-specic housing price variables on the distress of banks operating in those\nstates, we implicitly assume that banks are active in the states where their headquar-\nter is located. While realistic for the majority of German banks, this assumption is\ntoo restrictive for large banks, which conduct their operations all over the Republic\nand also abroad. Therefore, we re-estimate our model after excluding large com-\nmercial, savings, and cooperative banks from the sample. As shown in Table 4, the\nqualitative results of the preferred specication regarding the impact of real estate\nprice proxies remain unchanged.\nNext, by pooling universal and specialized German banks in our estimations, we\nassume that banks belonging to dierent banking groups respond in a similar way\nto housing market uctuations. Accounting for possible group dierences only by\nmeans of dummy variables might be too restrictive, especially when considering spe-\ncialized mortgage banks. Their primary business is real estate lending and they might\ntherefore be more experienced in hedging against housing market risks. Therefore,\nwe exclude specialized banks from the sample as another robustness check.21 The\nqualitative results regarding the impact of housing prices remain unchanged, which\nimplies that it is not only specialized banks that are aected by the developments\nin the housing market, but also the rest of the banking system.\n20The signicance of the baseline hazard implies that a bank with an average CAMEL prole is\nsignicantly exposed to distress with a certain probability.\n21Ideally, we would estimate PDs only for specialized banks, which was infeasible due to the small\ngroup size. Also, we showed in Table 1 that 71 out of 75 specialized banks are located in the old\nfederal states, which implies that geographical coverage of specialized banks is not encompassing.\nClearly, housing prices do not exhaust the list of potentially relevant state-specic\nfactors inuencing bank stability. One important variable that might be relevant for\npredicting bank PD at the state-level is the degree of economic activity as measured\nby regional real GDP growth (Nuxoll et al., 2003). Economic growth can aect bank\nstability either directly (aggregate income, demand for new loans), or indirectly\n(impact on housing prices). Similar to Nuxoll et al. (2003), real per capita GDP\ngrowth does not have signicant explanatory power. However, its inclusion eliminates\nthe signicance of the interaction eects with bank exposure proxies. Nevertheless,\nthe impact of price-to-rent ratios is still positive and signicant, supporting the\nimportance of this variable as an indicator of real estate market risks for banks.\nSo far, we have used data on prices and rents of existing property, which consti-\ntute the majority of the housing market in Germany. To cross-check the robustness\nof our results regarding the type of the housing market considered, we re-estimate\nthe model with data on housing prices and rents of newly constructed property. The\nestimation results yield an unchanged outcome, implying that the results do not\ndepend on the housing market under consideration.\nWhile the estimation results show that (random) state-specic eects are important,\npolicy makers may be more interested in the implications of banks' location on\ntheir PDs. Therefore, we evaluate next the relative importance of both bank-specic\nCAMEL covariates and state-specic real estate indices to predict bank PDs.\nWe compare probabilities of distress predicted with the multilevel mixed-eect\nspecication without housing price eects (Model 0) to predicted PDs from our\nreference specication with housing price eects (Model 4). The PDs are decomposed\ninto two parts: the bank-specic eect and the state-specic random eect (uj\n). The\nrst part measures the impact of standard bank-level covariates used in the literature\nand is expected to constitute the largest part of the total PD. The second part is due\nto the random variation across the German states as a result of the state-specic\nheterogeneity, which, in the case of Model 4, is not captured by the variation in\nhousing prices. In Figure 2 we present the dynamics of xed and random parts of\npredicted PDs over time for Models 0 and 4. The total PDs are grouped according\nto the geographical location of the banks (old versus new states).\nSeveral ndings emerge from this picture. First, as expected, the xed eect part\nof the total PD constitutes the largest part of the total PD in both specications.\nNext, the impact of random eects in both model specications is comparable, which\nconrms our previous claim that there are other important state-specic variables\nnot present in the model which explain a sizable potion of the state-specic het-\nerogeneity in terms of bank PDs. More importantly, the impact of state-specic\nheterogeneity is uniformly positive in the new federal states and negative in old\nones. Moreover, its impact is more than two times larger in the former regions. This\nnding is valid also for other specications (not presented to conserve space) and\nimplies that banks located in the new states are more prone to distress due to the\nstate-specic factors not captured by housing price(-to-rent) uctuations. Thus, the\nlocation of a bank is an important factor aecting bank PDs even after controlling\nfor other conventional covariates.\nFigure 2: Predicted distress from Models 0 (without housing prices) and 4 (with\nhousing prices)\nOne caveat with interpreting this nding is related to the fact that some of the\ncredit extended by banks to the new states originates from banks located in old\nstates. As shown previously in Table 1, only four out of 71 specialized mortgage\nbanks are located in new states, which means that it is likely that a signicant\npart of housing credit extended to these regions is recorded in the books of the\nbanks located outside the state. However, another important source for real estate\nnancing in the new states may be regional saving and cooperative banks, which\nare also very active in real estate lending. Separate regressions for these banking\ngroups yield qualitatively identical results between housing prices and banking risk.\nTo some extent, this supports the robustness of our previous conclusion.22\n5 Conclusion\nThis paper builds on the theoretical work relating individual bank stability to the\ndevelopments in regional real estate markets. We provide empirical evidence on this\nrelationship using German data on real estate prices per federal state and bank\ndata concerning nancial accounts and distress events of both universal and spe-\ncharacterized by constantly declining prices during this period, we provide evidence\nthat complements other studies focusing on nancial systems where housing prices\n22However, we caution that we are ultimately unable to trace the particular region to which\nbank loans are extended with certainty.\nexhibit exuberant hikes. Methodologically, we seek to contribute to the literature\nby combining information at dierent aggregation levels, state (real estate) versus\nbank level (nancial and distress), and use multilevel mixed-eect logistic regression\nmethods to predict bank distress. Our main results are as follows.\nIn line with the prediction by Calomiris and Mason (2003), our empirical results\nsupport the view that developments of real estate prices at the disaggregated (state)\nlevel add signicant discriminatory power to predict individual bank distress.\nReal estate price levels per se have only a limited impact on bank distress.\nInstead, price-to-rent ratios are both statistically and economically signicant. Since\nhousing prices have declined constantly in Germany without any signs of a bubble,\nthis result suggests the general existence of a relation between bank distress and real\nestate markets. To the extent that price-to-rent ratios reect potentially exaggerated\nexpectations of investors regarding the present value of future cash ows, we nd\nthat especially such indicators of deviations from fundamental values are related\nto higher bank PDs. Potentially, the relation between price-to-rent ratios and bank\ndistress might be even stronger in countries that have experienced booms and busts\nin housing prices.\nThe exposure of a bank to the real estate market has implications for its sensitiv-\nity to housing price developments. After controlling for banking group membership\n(universal versus specialized), increasing property prices decrease bank PDs, which\nindicates risk reductions through the increase of collateral value. However, this eect\nis only signicant for banks with relatively large exposure to mortgage lending. In\ncontrast, increasing price-to-rent ratios render all banks more vulnerable to distress,\nalbeit more specialized banks are aected signicantly stronger.\nHousing prices do not exhaust the list of economic factors at the state level that\ninuence bank distress. The random state-specic variation of bank distress remains\nsignicant and explains a relatively large part of the predicted bank PD. The impact\nof state-specic factors on PDs is uniformly positive for banks headquartered in the\nnew federal states. Hence, an economically signicant part of bank PDs appears to\ndepend on factors outside the direct realm of managerial inuence, namely location.\nIn sum, price-to-rent ratios rather than housing price levels alone seem to contain\nimportant information, especially if obvious signs of overheating are absent from\nreal estate markets. Even after controlling for other state-specic eects, this proxy\nappears to provide useful information on potential hazards to bank stability. Note,\nhowever, that the relatively low frequency of rent changes may constitute a potential\nlimitation of this proxy to fully capture changing expectations of future cash ows.\nAppendix\nA latent class cost frontier\nWe use stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to estimate cost functions and associated\nineciency (CE). Banks k demand inputs x at prices w, and we also account for\nequity z. In contrast to most studies, we assume that the transformation function\nof the banking rm can dier across J latent classes, T(y, x, z|j). Banks choose a\nproduction plan that minimizes total operating cost (TOC). Optimal costs depend\non the technology employed by the bank and deviations from optimal cost are either\ndue to random noise or ineciency. Instead, of estimating (arbitrary) group-specic\nfrontiers separately, we estimate latent production technologies of banks simultane-\nously. We follow Greene (2005) and specify a latent class frontier model as:\n=  + j\nxkt\n+ kt|j\nwhere xkt\nis a short-hand for the cost function arguments consisting of outputs\ny, input prices w, control variables z, and the respective interaction terms of the\ntranslog functional form. Coecients  can vary across an a priori specied number\nof groups j = 1, .., J and is an error term composed of random noise vkt\nand\nineciency ukt\nconditional on group j. Note that it is unknown into which group\nindividual banks k belong. Instead, we add an equation that represents the likelihood\nof a bank to be classied into a certain group j conditional on it's production\ntechnology xkt\nas well as group specic elasticities j\nand eciency parameters to\nestimate, i.e. j\nand j\n:\nPkt|j\n= f(TOCkt\n|j\n, xkt\n, j\n, j\nAs in Greene (2005), we estimate bank-specic probabilities of group membership\nusing a multinomial logit model:\n(k, j) =\nexp(j\nzk\n)\nJ\nexp(m\nzk\n)\n, for J\nwhere j = J is the reference group and zk\nare bank-specic determinants of group\nmembership. The conditional likelihood averaged over classes is:\nPk\n=\nJ\n(k, j)\nT\nPkt|j\n=\nJ\n(k, j)Pk|j\n.\nParameters for equations (5) and (6) are obtained by estimating the joint likelihood\nincorporating production and probability parameters (Greene, 2005). This allows us\nto avoid the usual assumption of one identical frontier across banks and permits a\ncomparison of relative eciency scores. We condition group membership on both a\nspecialization dummy based on the taxonomy of the Bundesbank and the share of\n23Descriptive statistics and parameter estimates are available upon request. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of approaches to control for heterogeneity see Bos et al. (2008). More details on the\nlatent class frontier model are discussed in Koetter and Poghosyan (2008).\nANOVA analysis of housing prices\nWe decompose housing price changes in Germany into two dierent levels, city\nand state, to evaluate the importance of housing price variation across dierent\nhierarchical levels by means of the explained variation.24 If the variation across cities\nwithin states is smaller than the variation across states, it is reasonable to aggregate\nthe city level information to the state level and base estimations on state-specic\nhousing price indices. We employ data on housing prices collected for 125 German\ncities by the Bulwien AG provided by the Bundesbank.25 The structural form of the\nmultilevel model is given by:\n log HPijt\n+ ijt\nwhere HPijt\nis the price index for city i, in state j at time t, 0ij\n) and\n) are city- and state-level random error terms, and ijt\n) is\nthe i.i.d. residual. Equations (9a)-(9c) assume that average changes in price indices\nvary across cities and states, as indicated by the subscripts of intercepts . The\n log HPijt\n+ ijt\nAn intuitive measure that summarizes the importance of shocks aecting housing\nprice changes at dierent hierarchical levels is the intraclass correlation given by:\nCorr( log HPijt\n,  log HPi jt\n) =\nCov( log HPijt\n,  log HPi jt\n)\nV ar( log HPijt\n) V ar( log HPi jt\n)\n=\n\n\n\n+ \n+ \n\n\n+ \n+ \n=\n\n\n+ \n+ \n= city\nThe parameter i\ndenotes the intraclass correlation at the city level. This coecient\nshows the expected level of correlation of log price dierences between two randomly\nselected cities belonging to the same state. The larger i\n, the more clustered the\nobservations are within states and therefore more care needs to be taken to model\nthis intraclass dependence explicitly. Similarly, intraclass correlation on the state\nlevel can be expressed as: state\n= \n++\n. Estimation results for specication (10)\nusing mixed eect linear regression methods are summarized in Table 5.\nThe signicant negative intercept coecient means that on average German\nhousing prices declined. The variation of deviations across the total average varies at\ndierent levels. Most of the variability originates from the state level (\n), while the\ncity-level variation within states is negligible and insignicant (\n). This is also con-\nrmed by the intraclass correlation coecient, which is about 2% at the state level.\nThis can be interpreted as the expected correlation between two randomly chosen\nprice indices within the same state. The city-level intraclass correlation is zero. This\n24See Jones and Bullen, 1994 for a similar application using urban house prices in the UK.\n25We exclude Berlin, Hamburg and Saarland, since there is only a single price index.\nand ijt\nnested at dierent levels are assumed to be uncorrelated.\nTable 5: ANOVA regression results for dierent housing price indices\nIntraclass correlation\nstate city\nNote: Estimations are performed using information on prices of houses per square meter for 122\nare excluded from estimations, since the dataset does not contain house price information on more\nthan one city in each of these states. Total number of observations is 1,230.\nimplies that the city-level variation averaged over states does not contribute to the\ntotal variation. Thus, aggregation of housing price indices to the state-level would\nnot result in a substantial loss of information.\nFigure 3: Housing prices and price-to-rent ratios (Euros per sqm)\nReferences\nAoki, K., J.
