We present a technique for distinguishing two primary\nsources of homophily: biases in the preferences of individuals over\nthe types of their friends and biases in the chances that people meet\nindividuals of other types. We use this technique to analyze racial\npatterns in friendship networks in a set of American high schools\nfrom the Add Health dataset. Biases in preferences and biases in\nmeeting rates are both highly significant in these data, and both\ntypes of biases differ significantly across races. Asians and Blacks are\nbiased toward interacting with their own race at rates >7 times\nhigher than Whites, whereas Hispanics exhibit an intermediate bias\nin meeting opportunities. Asians exhibit the least preference bias,\nvaluing friendships with other types 90% as much as friendships\nwith Asians, whereas Blacks and Hispanics value friendships with\nother types 55% and 65% as much as same-type friendships, respec-\ntively, and Whites fall in between, valuing other-type friendships\n75% as much as friendships with Whites. Meetings are significantly\nmore biased in large schools (>1,000 students) than in small schools\n(<1,000 students), and biases in preferences exhibit some signifi-\ncant variation with the median household income levels in the coun-\nties surrounding the schools.\nfriendships | high schools | homophily | segregation | social networks\nFriendship networks from a sample of American high schools in\nthe Add Health national survey exhibit a strong pattern: stu-\ndents tend to form friendships with other students of their same\nethnic group at rates that are substantially higher than their pop-\nulation shares (Fig. 1) (1\u00ad4). This feature, referred to as \"homo-\nphily\" in the sociological literature (5), is prevalent across many\napplications andcan have important implications for behaviors (6\u00ad\n9). The widespread presence of homophily indicates that friend-\nship formation differs substantially from a process of uniformly\nrandom assortment. Two key sources of homophily are (i) biases in\nindividual preferences for which relationships they form and (ii)\nbiases in the rates at which individuals meet each other. It is\nimportant to identify whether homophily is primarily due to just\none of these biases or to both because, for instance, this can shape\npolicies aimed at producing more integrated high schools. In this\narticle, we present a technique for identifying these two biases, we\napply this technique to the Add Health dataset, and we estimate\nhow preference and meeting biases differ across races.\nAlthough there is substantial evidence that race is a salient fea-\nture in how people view each other (10), such evidence does not sort\nout the sources of homophily, other than indicating that student\npreferences could be a factor. Without detailed and reliable data on\nthe mechanics of which students meet which others, these questions\nare not answered by a direct analysis of friendship data. Moreover,\nsurveys of students asking them about their racial attitudes may not\nreliably reflect the choices that they make. To this end, we use a\ntechnique that is well established in economics for estimating con-\nsumers' preferences: revealed preference theory (11). One infers\npreferences of the individual by careful observation of the choices\nthat they make based on the opportunities that they have. We adapt\nthese techniques for the analysis of social behavior and friendship\nformation.Hereweinferstudents'preferencesbyobservinghowthe\nnumberoffriendshipstheyhavechangeswiththeracialcomposition\noftheir school. Weemploythe friendship formation model (3),here\nextendedtoallowfordifferentbiasesacrossraceinbothpreferences\nand opportunities. Using a parameterized version of this model, we\nare able to distinguish between the two primary sources of homo-\nphily (that is, preference bias and meeting bias), and to measure\ntheir relative magnitudes and how these differ across races. The\nresults illustrate these techniques and the factors leading to homo-\nphily and racial segregation patterns in friendships.\nResults and Discussion\nThere are two patterns of homophily in the Add Health data that\nare important to understand (Fig. 1). First, not only is there sub-\nstantial homophily, but it follows a nonlinear and nonmonotone\ntrend with respect to group size, with low levels of homophily for\ngroups that form very large or small fractions of a school and\nhigher levels of homophily for groups that form an intermediate\nsized fraction of a school. Second, homophily patterns differ sig-\nnificantly across races and by school size (see SI Text, Fig. S1, and\nTables S1\u00adS3 for a statistical analysis).\nThe model of friendship formation developed in ref. 3 showed\nhow preference biases and meeting biases lead to different pat-\nterns in the numbers of friendships that people form and the\nresulting homophily. Thus, by taking advantage of those differ-\nences in patterns, one can identify preference and meeting biases.\nHere we enrich and extend the model in such a way to be able to\nidentify race-by-race differences in these biases. Students enter the\nsystem and randomly meet friends, leaving the process when\nexpected gains from new meetings are outweighed by the cost of\nsearching. One key element is that students have preferences over\nthe racial mix of their friends. Students can value a friendship with\nsomeone of their own race differently from a friendship with\nsomeone of another race. The second element is that students may\nend up meeting other students of their own race at a rate that is\nhigher than what would occur if they were meeting other searching\nstudents uniformly at random. This bias may stem from the various\nways in which the meeting process can depart from a uniform\nrandom process, including self-segregation through racially\nhomogeneous activities, as well as meeting friends of friends, etc.\nAuthor contributions: S.C., M.O.J., and P.P. designed research, performed research, contrib-\nuted new analytic tools, analyzed data, and wrote the paper, with all authors contributing\nequally.\n*This Direct Submission article had a prearranged editor.\n1To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Data files are available from Add Health,\nCarolina Population Center (addhealth@unc.edu).\nThis article contains supporting information online at www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/\nECONOMIC\nSCIENCES\nDetails about the model and the way in which we estimate it from\nthe data are found in Material and Methods and SI Text.\nWe find that all racial groups exhibit significant biases in both\ntheir preferences over friendships and in the rate at which they\nmeet students of their own race. Moreover, there are significant\ndifferences across races in the relative biases.\nEstimated biases in preferences range from one extreme where\nBlacks value friendships with students of other races 55% as much\nas those with other Blacks, to the other extreme where Asians\nvalue friendships with students of other races 90% as much as\nthose with other Asians; Hispanics and Whites fall in between at\nEstimated biases in meetings range from Whites meeting students\nwithoutanybias,toAsiansandBlacksexhibitingmeetingbiasesof7\u00ad\n7.5, and Hispanics at an intermediate rate of 2.5. To interpret the\nmeeting biases: a meeting bias of 7 is such that >90% of the people\nthat Asians meet are other Asians in a case where Asians comprise\n50% of the population. The meeting bias of 2.5 is such that >70% of\nthe people that Hispanics meet are other Hispanics, in a case where\nHispanics comprise 50% of the population.\nThese results suggest that the differences across ethnic groups in\nboth the homophily patterns and in the total number of friends\n(see SI Text for the statistical analysis of these differences) are\nexplained by differences in both types of biases. For instance, the\nestimates suggest that Blacks' homophily stems from both sig-\nnificant meeting and preference biases, whereas Whites' homo-\nphily is more driven by preference bias.\nAn additional relevant issue is the potential influence of\nschool size on observed behavior. Hypothetically, it could be that\ndifferences across races are driven by general differences in\nbehavior in large versus small schools, which could correlate with\nthe racial makeup of a school and therefore potentially drive our\nresults. We therefore control for school size, splitting the sample\nin \"large\" and \"small\" schools (as described in more detail\nbelow). Although controlling for school size does not affect the\nconclusions discussed above, it is interesting to note that larger\nschools exhibit significantly higher biases in the rates at which\nstudents meet students of their own race. This is consistent with\nmore opportunities to self-segregate in large schools, where\nacademic tracking and the availability of specialized clubs, ath-\nletics, and extracurricular activities, and other mechanisms,\ncould bias meetings (13\u00ad19). To the extent that more integrated\nfriendship patterns are a goal for policy, the higher bias in\nmeetings that is observed with larger schools provides some\nsupport for the opinion expressed in some of the recent sociology\nliterature that smaller schools offer some advantages.\nWe also perform an analogous control for the income level\nsurrounding a school. We split the sample into \"high\" and \"low\"\nincome schools, where high corresponds to schools that are in\ncounties with median household incomes above $30,000 in the\n1990 census, and low corresponds to schools in counties below\nthis level. Again, controlling for income levels does not change\nthe basic patterns observed in the preference and meeting biases,\nbut we do see significant differences in preference biases\nbetween high and low income schools, although the differences\nin meeting biases do not differ significantly. We see less pref-\nerence bias for some races (Hispanics and Whites) in higher\nincome schools and the reverse for Blacks.\nFig. 1. Homophily as a function of the fraction of a school's population that a group comprises, differentiating by race (A) and school size (B). The homophily\nindex, due to Coleman (12), is a normalized measure of the difference between the observed racial mix of friendships and the expected mix if friendships were\nformed uniformly at random. An index of 0 indicates that students in a given group (each datum is a racial group within 1 of 84 schools) have friendships dis-\ntributed according to the racial mix of the society, whereas an index of 1 indicates that the students only form friendships with other students of their own race.\nLetting wi\nbe the fraction of race i in a given school, and qi\nbe the fraction of their friendships on average that are of own-type, the index is (qi\n\u00ad wi\n).\nThe meeting process\nUnbiased choices and opportunities\nAll do the same Biased choices\nMeeting Rates\nProportional to\nPopultion\nLarger groupsface\nmore attractive mix,\nare more willing to\nform friendships\nPopulation Meeting\nRates\nMeeting\nRates\nMeeting Rates reflect\nchoices: larger groups\nare more prevalent in\nPopulation\nBiased Meetings\nEven if pool matches\npopulation,meeting rates\nChoices determine pool\nPopulation\nPool\ndiffer from the pool\nMeeting Rates\nDiffer from Pool\nFig. 2. The meeting process.\nLarger schools also offer some advantages, as there may be economies of scale and it\nmay also be easier to draw more racially balanced populations in larger districts. The\nsignificant increases in meeting biases in large schools, however, suggest that either one\nmight want to create schools within schools, or understand the factors leading to in-\ncreased meeting biases and homophily in larger schools.\nMaterials and Methods\nHere we describe the model and empirical analysis, referring to SI Text for\ntechnical details.\nIn our model a population of agents is partitioned into K different groups,\nwhere group definitions delineate the relevant characteristics that agents care\nabout in forming friendships. Let wi\ndenote the fraction of the population that\nis of type i. Agents have preferences over the number of friends that they have\nfrom their owngroup,henceforthreferred to as \"same-type\" friends, and from\nother groups, henceforth referred to as \"different-type\" friends. Let si\nand di\ndenote the number of same-type and different-type friends that a repre-\nsentative agent in group i has, and let ti\n= si\n+ di\nbe the agent's total number of\nfriends. The agent's preferences are represented by a utility function,\nUi\n\u00f0si\n; di\n\u00de \u00bc \u00f0si\n\u00fe \ni\ndi\nwhere both i\nand  lie between 0 and 1, so that Ui\nis increasing in both si\nand di\n.\nThe function Ui\nmeasures the utility or satisfaction drawn from one's friend-\nships. The parameter i\ncaptures the bias in preferences, with i\n< 1 indicating\nthat different-type friends are valued less than same-type friends. The\nparameter  captures diminishing returns to friendships overall: doubling the\nnumber of each type of friends that an agent has results in less than double the\nutility. Finally, agents only distinguish between same-type and different-type\nfriends, as is roughly consistent with empirical evidence (20\u00ad23).\nFriendship formation takes place via a meeting process in which agents\nrandomly meet potential friends, perhaps in a biased manner. The meeting\nprocess can be thought of as a sort of \"party\" where agents come to the party\nand randomly meet other agents and then eventually leave the party once the\nbenefit from meeting more friends nolongerexceeds theopportunity cost (c >\n0) of time and resources of staying at the party. The relevant meeting\nparameter from an agent's decision perspective is the expected rate at which\nhe/she will meet same-type versus different-type friends at the party. For type\ni, these are denoted by qi\nand 1 \u00ad qi\n, respectively. If preferences are biased\nso that i\n< 1 and same-type friendships yield higher marginal values than\ndifferent-type friendships, then a higher matching rate qi\nprovides higher\nincentives to form additional friendships. In this case, groups that meet their\nown types at higher rates (face higher qi\n) at the party will choose to stay at the\nparty longer and thus form more friendships per capita than groups that meet\ntheir own types at lower rates. The meeting rates for different races and total\nnumbers of friendships are both observable in the data, allowing us to identify\nthe preference parameters. Note also that choice and chance feed back upon\neach other: given biased preferences groups accounting for a larger share of\nthe population will choose to stay at the party longer (i.e., socialize more) and\nso end up forming an even greater portion of people at the party, thus making\nit even more attractive for their types and less attractive for other types. This\nfeedback does not prevent us from identifying preference and meeting biases,\nas described below.\nSolving the model requires determining the meeting probabilities. If\nmeetings follow a uniform random process (in which case we talk of an\n\"unbiased\" meeting process), agents meet each other in proportion to their\nrelative stocks (i.e., proportions at the party), so that qi\n\u00bc Mi\n\nk\nMk\n, where Mi\n=\nwi\nti\nis the stock of agents of type i. Biases in meetings, such that agents meet\nsame friends at higher rates than their relative stocks, are captured by\nqi\n\u00bc\nMi\n\nk\nMk\nwhere i\n> 1 is the bias that each type has toward itself in the meeting process,\nand i\n= 1 is the case of unbiased process. For instance, if a group comprises half\nof the meeting pool and has a bias of i\n= 2, then it would meet itself at a rate of\n= 3 this rises to 0.8, and at i\nthe stocks of different types in the meeting process must sum to one,\n\ni\nMi\n\nk\nMk\n\u00bc 1, it follows that\n\ni\nqi\ni\nWe also impose conditions that relate meeting rates across races, since if a\nperson of type i is meeting a person of type j then the converse is also true,\nas described in SI Text. The meeting process is illustrated in Fig. 2.\nUsing this model, we estimate the preference bias and meeting bias\nparameters from the data. If an agent forms ti\nfriendships when a fraction of qi\nare of same-type, then the resulting utility (including costs of time in the\nmeeting process) is (ti\nqi\n+ i\n)ti\n) \u00ad cti\n. Thus, utility optimization (see SI Text\nfor details) implies that for every type i the following first order necessary\ncondition holds:\nti\n\u00bc\n\nc\n\u00f0\ni\ni\n\u00deqi\n\u00de \nFrom Eq. 4, we see that i\ndictates how sensitive thetotal number offriends of a\ngiven agent is to changes in the odds of meeting a same-type agent. If there is\nnot much preference bias (i.e., a i\nnear 1), then the number of friendships\nformed is relatively insensitive to the rate at which same-type friends are met.\nIn contrast, if preferences are heavily biased toward own-type (i.e., i\nis lower),\nthen the number of friendships formed will be very sensitive to the rate at\nwhich same-type friends are met. This is a key to the identification: the sen-\nsitivity of the number of friendships formed by a given type of agent to the\nsame-type meeting rate identifies the bias in preferences. The identification of\nthe meeting biases can then be found from Eq. 3. To see why it identifies the\nmeeting biases, note that it implicitly keeps track of the extent to which the\nrelative fraction of types met (the qi\ns) differ from the relative stocks at\nthe `party' (the wi\ns weighted by the ti\ns).\nAs described in SI Text, we allow for individual idiosyncrasies in preferences\nand other perturbations, by allowing Eq. 4 to only hold up to an individual\nerror term, and we also allow costs to vary by school. Applying condition 4 to\nany pair of types i and j, we can eliminate the cost term (which is unobserved in\nthe data) and obtain the following equation:\nti\n\u00f0\nj\nj\n\u00deqj\n\u00de \n\u00f0\ni\ni\n\u00deqi\n\u00de \nNotethatti\n,tj\n,andqi\n,qj\nareavailabledata,sinceti\nisthenumberoffriendshipson\naverage by typei students,and qi\n= si\n/(si\n+ di\n)isthe average percent of friendships\nformed by type i students that are of the same-race. We thus estimate  and the\ni\n's by minimizing the errors in Eq. 5. Then, each choice of values for , Asians\n,\nBlacks\n, Hispanics\n, Whites\n, and Others\nleads to a difference between the right hand\nsideand thelefthandsideofEq.5.Weightingschoolsto correctfortheirsizeand\nhence the variance in errors which are coming from individual choices (as\ndescribed in detail in SI Text) yields a sum of squared errors for each choice of \nand's.Thestatisticalanalysisreportedbelowisbasedonapresumptionthatthe\nerrors follow a Normal distribution, and in SI Text, Fig. S2, we verify that the\nrealized distribution of errors does not differ significantly from a Normal dis-\ntribution. We search over a grid to find parameters that minimize this weighted\nsum of squared errors. To estimate the  parameters, we follow the same tech-\nnique based on Eq. 3. Results are reported in Table 1.\nThe patterns across race differ significantly. Asian students are the least\nbiased in their preferences over racial mixes, having the highest  at 0.9, but\nTable 1.

Blacks\nexhibit the greatest bias in both preferences and meetings, with a  of 0.55\nand a  of 7.5. Hispanics are intermediate in terms of both biases, while\nWhites have an intermediate preference bias and no meeting bias.\nTo check that these differences reflect a systematic heterogeneity and not\nthe mere effect of randomness, we run a series of F-tests on the above\ncalibrations, as described in SI Text and Tables S4\u00adS7. A summary of the\nresults appears in Table 2. The hypothesis that all of the races have unbiased\npreferences is rejected well above the 99% confidence level. Moreover,\nAsian and White preference biases do not differ significantly from each\nother, and the same holds for Blacks and Hispanics, but Blacks and Hispanics\nboth differ significantly from both Asians and Whites. Similar patterns are\nfound in the meeting biases, but this time with Asians and Blacks having\nindistinguishable meeting biases but both differing significantly from His-\npanics and Whites.\u00a7\nBeyond the analysis above, we also control for the effect of school size on\nthe estimated parameters, as well as income. We analyze the effect of school\nsize by re-estimating the model, when the schools are divided into a category\ndents). We can then compare the estimated preference and meeting biases\nby school size. As reported in Table 3, larger schools exhibit significantly\nhigher meeting biases (at the 99% level) than small schools, but differences\nin preference biases between small and large schools are insignificant (even\nat the 90% confidence level). In particular, meeting biases are greater for\nBlacks and Hispanics in large compared to small schools, but lesser for Asians\nin large compared to small schools. We also checked whether the patterns in\nbiases are sensitive to the median household income level in the school's\ncounty, since it turns out that income shows very little correlation with\nschool size in these data. Again, we divided schools into two categories,\nthose in which the county level median household income level was above\nreported in Table 4, in this case preference biases differ significantly (at the\n99% level) across the high and low income-level schools, but the meeting\nbiases do not differ significantly (even at the 90% confidence level) across\nthe high and low income-level schools. Here we see Hispanic and White\nexhibiting more bias in preferences (i.e., having lower 's) in low income\nschools and there is more bias overall in low income schools (when esti-\nmating a single bias parameter), although Blacks exhibit slightly more\npreference bias in high income schools.\nFurther study is needed to understand the sources of preference and\nmeeting biases, why they differ across races, and why they are correlated with\nschool size and median income. Moreover, the racial categorization here is\nquite coarse,\u00b6 and many other attributes can also affect friendship formation.\nIn addition, we note that our analysis might even underestimate preference\nbiases, since meeting biases could incorporate some aspects of choice, and\nsince meetings are partly endogenous given that students have some choice as\nto which clubs to join, which sports to participate in, which parties to go to, and\nso forth. Indeed, there is a positive correlation between inbreeding homophily\nand the number of clubs and athletic activities that a school has (a correlation\nof 0.26 which is significant at the 99% confidence level).k\nBeyond this, it would be interesting to extend the revealed preference sort\nof techniques used here to incorporate the sort of network induced\nhomophily effects found by Kossinets and Watts (24, 25), who show the\nimportance of proximity in an existing social network for the formation of\nnew friendships.**\nFinally, it is worth emphasizing that the \"revealed preference\" techniques\napplied here can be employed in many other settings; by specifying an\nTable 4.

Preference and meeting biases when allowed to vary by school size\n a\nb\nh\nw\no\na\nb\nh\nw\no\n\u00a7In SI Text we also report estimation of these biases when restricting attention to groups\nwith minimal weights in the population, as well as estimations of the meeting biases by\nestimating Eq. 2 on a race-by-race basis, rather than as a joint estimation procedure as\nwe use under Eq. 3. These provide biases that are similarly significantly above 1, but with\nsome compression and variation in the differences across races.\n\u00b6The coarseness could lead the preference biases of some racial groups to be underesti-\nmated. For example, the \"Asian\" group includes Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese,\nIndian, and many other populations under one umbrella. To the extent that their racial\npreferences differ by the finer ethnic categorizations, it could be that this leads their\nfriendship patterns with other categories to look similar to the same group, and so leads\nto a higher  parameter than would be estimated if data were available on finer cate-\ngorizations. This might account for the significant differences between Asian preference\nbias and some of the other groups' biases.\nkWe consider activities that have at least two student members and discard the few\nstudents who claimed to be involved in 20 or more clubs or sports with some having\nclaimed to be involved in all possible activities.\n**It is worth emphasizing that the terms \"choice homophily\" and \"preferences,\" as used\nin the empirical literature on homophily, generally refer to some conditional likeli-\nhood, or log odds ratios, of forming ties based on some characteristics, rather than\nexplicit modeling of a maximization of a utility function as we have done here. Thus, a\nhybrid of the sort of model analyzed here together with the network evolution and\nconstraints that network structures place on the meeting process as analyzed in refs. 24\nand 25 could be quite valuable.\nappropriate preference structure and a process through which agents might\nmeet each other, and then identifying various parameters through the co-\nmovements of the fraction of agents of various types and their patterns\nof relationships.\n"
