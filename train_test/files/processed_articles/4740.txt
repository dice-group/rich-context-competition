However, the effect of double application\nof edaravone on neurogenesis in the hippocampus following ischemia remains unknown. In the present study, we explored\nwhether pre- and posttreatment of edaravone had any effect on neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in the subgranular\nzone of hippocampus in a rat model of transient global cerebral ischemia and elucidated the potential mechanism of its\neffects. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: sham-operated (n \u00bc 15), control (n \u00bc 15), and edaravone-\ntreated (n \u00bc 15) groups. Newly generated cells were labeled by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine. Immunohistochemistry was used\nto detect neurogenesis. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling was used to detect\ncell apoptosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by 2,7-dichlorofluorescien diacetate assay in NSPCs in vitro.\nHypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) and cleaved caspase-3 proteins were quantified by western blot analysis. Treatment\nwith edaravone significantly increased the number of NSPCs and newly generated neurons in the subgranular zone (p <.05).\nTreatment with edaravone also decreased apoptosis of NSPCs (p <.01). Furthermore, treatment with edaravone significantly\ndecreased ROS generation and inhibited HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3 protein expressions. These findings indicate that pre-\nand posttreatment with edaravone enhances neurogenesis by protecting NSPCs from apoptosis in the hippocampus, which is\nprobably mediated by decreasing ROS generation and inhibiting protein expressions of HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3 after\ncerebral ischemia.\n",

It causes severe\ndamage to pyramidal neurons of the CA1 region and\nusually results in residual neurological deficits following\nrecovery from ischemia (Pulsinelli and Brierley, 1979;\nNitatori et al., 1995).

Neural stem/\nprogenitor cells (NSPCs) derived from the SGZ migrate\ninto the DG of the hippocampus, where some of them\nmature into granule neurons. This neurogenesis process is\nimportant for learning and synaptic plasticity under\nphysiological conditions (Iscru et al., 2013). Increased\nneurogenesis originating from NSPCs in the SGZ of the\nadult brain has been observed in a variety of mammals\nand humans following cerebral ischemia (Eriksson et al.,\ninduce spontaneous neurogenesis is closely associated\nwith recovery after ischemia (Liu et al., 1998; Nakatomi\nneuroprotective and neurorestorative medication for\ntreatment after cerebral ischemia should be developed.\nApoptosis is an essential process that occurs during\nnormal development to maintain homeostasis and\noccurs under pathological conditions (Guan et al.,\n2009). After global cerebral ischemia, the larger part of\nthe newly generated NSPCs in the hippocampus dies\nthrough apoptosis within weeks (Bingham et al., 2005;\nSun et al., 2012). Caspases are a family of cysteine pro-\nteinases that play a central role in the control of apoptosis\npase-3 results in the degradation of a number of intracel-\nlular and cytoskeletal protein substrates as part of an\nordered process of cellular disassembly, leading to\napoptotic cell death (Mancini et al., 1998; Sun et al.,\n1999). In addition, caspase-3 mediates the loss of neurons\nin the CA1 region and neurogenic cells in the SGZ\n(Bingham et al., 2005), and there is a causal relationship\nbetween hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) and cas-\npase-3 induction via HIF-1a functional binding to the\ncaspase-3 gene promoter (Van Hoecke et al., 2007).\nMoreover, accumulating evidence shows the involvement\nof reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the activation of sig-\nnaling components upstream of HIF-1a, such as hydro-\nxylases and kinases (Hwang et al., 2008; Koshikawa\nEdaravone (3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one) is a\nfree radical scavenger that can cross the blood\u00adbrain bar-\nrier and interact with a variety of free radicals to reduce\nROS generation (Aoyama et al., 2008). Edaravone has a\nneuroprotective role in focal cerebral ischemia in animals\nand in patients suffering from acute cerebral infarction\net al., 2008). However, the effect of pre- and posttreat-\nment with edaravone on neurogenesis in the hippocam-\npus after transient global cerebral ischemia is unknown.\nIn the present study, we investigated whether edaravone\nadministration had any effect on NSPCs in the SGZ after\ntransient global cerebral ischemia and explored whether\nintracellular ROS and the HIF-1 signaling pathway were\ninvolved in the mechanism of action of edaravone.\nMaterials and Methods\nGlobal Cerebral Ischemia Model\nThe Experimental Animal Center of Xi'an Jiaotong\nUniversity School of Medicine (Certificate No. 22-\nducted in accordance with the National Institutes of\nHealth Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory\nAnimals (NIH Publications No. 80-23). The Animal\nCare and Use Committee of Xi'an Jiaotong University\nSchool of Medicine approved the experimental protocols.\nwere maintained on a 12-hr light/dark cycle with free\naccess to food and water (Zheng et al., 2012). Transient\nbrain ischemia (10 min) was induced by the four-\nvessel occlusion method, as described previously by\nBriefly, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital\nsodium (40 mg kg\u00c01, intraperitoneally). The vertebral\narteries were irreversibly electrocauterized. The common\ncarotid arteries were exposed, and a small-diameter silk\nthread looped around each artery to facilitate subsequent\nocclusion. Rats were allowed to recover for 24 hr.\nTransient global cerebral ischemia was induced by simul-\ntaneously clamping the bilateral common carotid arteries\nfor 10 min with two microvascular clamps. Rats whose\npupils were dilated and unresponsive to light and that\nshowed increased respiration were selected for the experi-\nment. Sham-operated rats received the surgical proced-\nures except that the vertebral arteries were not\nelectrocauterized and the common carotid arteries were\nnot clamped. Rats in the edaravone group (n \u00bc 15)\nreceived an intraperitoneal injection of edaravone\n(3.0 mg kg\u00c01; Boda, Jilin, China) 30 min before clamping\nthe common carotid arteries and 30 min after reperfusion.\nThis treatment schedule and dosage were based on the\npharmacokinetic profile of edaravone supplied by the\nmanufacturer and previous studies (Shichinohe et al.,\nLu et al., 2012). Rats in the control group (operated on,\nno edaravone treatment; n \u00bc 15) or sham-operated group\n(n \u00bc 15) received intraperitoneal injection of normal\nsaline using the same volume as the edaravone group.\nDuring ischemia and reperfusion, the rectal temperature\n(BrdU, 50 mg kg\u00c01; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was injected\nintraperitoneally at the onset of global cerebral ischemia\nand then once daily for 7 or 14 consecutive days (Zhang\nafter ischemia by excessive anesthesia, 2 hr after the final\nBrdU injection. Neurological score, which is a composite\nof motor (muscle status and abnormal movement), sen-\nsory (visual, tactile, and proprioceptive), reflex, and bal-\nance tests, was assessed by a blinded investigator\n2 ASN Neuro\nconsidered neurologically normal, whereas a score of 0 is\nconsidered as brain dead.\nTissue Preparations and Histological Assessment\nSeven, fourteen, and twenty-one days after clamping the\nbilateral common carotid arteries, rats of each group\n(n \u00bc 5 per time point) were killed by excessive anesthesia\nwith pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneally)\nand perfused transcardially with normal saline followed\nby 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS). The brains were postfixed with 4% paraformalde-\nhyde for 24 hr and embedded in paraffin. Finally, each\nsample from bregma \u00c02.0 mm to bregma \u00c04.0 mm was\ncut into 7 -mm-thick consecutive coronal sections using a\nmicrotome (HM340, Microm, Germany). For histo-\nlogical assessment, cresyl violet was used to stain the sec-\ntions, which were observed under an optical microscope\nat 7, 14, and 21 days after ischemia. The length of the\ndamaged CA1 pyramidal cell layer was measured under\n\u00c2 400 magnification and expressed as the percentage of\nthe entire CA1 subregion. The severity of neuronal\ndamage was graded as grade 0, no damage to any hippo-\ncampal subregion; grade 1, scattered ischemic neurons in\nthe CA1 subregion; grade 2, moderate ischemic damage;\ngrade 3, whole pyramidal cell damage in the CA1 sub-\nregion; and grade 4, extensive cell damage in all hippocam-\nImmunohistochemistry and Terminal dUTP\nNick-End Labeling Staining\nThe tissue sections were subjected to microwave heat-\ninduced epitope retrieval. After blocking with 4% goat\nsections were incubated with primary antibodies at 4C\novernight. The primary antibodies included rat poly-\nrabbit anti-doublecortin (DCX) polyclonal antibody\n(1:1,000; Abcam, UK), mouse monoclonal anti-neuron-\nspecific nuclear protein (NeuN) antibody (1:1,000;\nChemicon, USA), and mouse monoclonal anti-glial fibril-\nlary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (1:800; Sigma, St.\nLouis, MO, USA). The sections were then washed with\nPBS and incubated with secondary antibodies [fluorescein\nisothiocyanate (FITC) or tetramethylrhodamine isothio-\ncyanate (TRITC)-conjugated IgG, or biotinylated IgG]\nfor 2 hr at room temperature. To detect apoptosis of\nnewly generated cells in the SGZ, the BrdU-stained sec-\ntions were labeled using the terminal dUTP nick-end\nlabeling (TUNEL) assay, according to the instruction of\nin situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche, Germany), and\nnegative/positive controls were also used according to the\ninstructions. A laser confocal microscope (TSC SP2,\nLeica, Manheim, Germany) detected the fluorescence\nsignals.\nNSPC Culture and Hypoxic Exposure\nNSPCs were isolated from the cortex of Kunming mice\non gestation Day 14 and cultured in T25 flasks, as\nthe primary neurospheres were mechanically dissociated\nand triturated. Single cells were resuspended at a density\nneurospheres). Passage 1 cells at a density of 5,000 cells/\nmL in serum-free medium were cultured in 96-well plates\nfor 3 days, and then incubated with edaravone (0 mM or\n/\n) or without edaravone under nor-\n(CY-100B, Hangzhou Lihua Sci-technology Company,\nHangzhou, China) monitored the percentage of oxygen\nin the chamber continuously. The cells were dissociated\n37C, followed by 75% ice-cold ethanol fixation\novernight at \u00c020C. Immunocytochemical analysis was\nused to characterize the cultured cells. The primary anti-\nbodies included mouse monoclonal anti-nestin antibody\n(1:500; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA), rabbit poly-\nCambridge, UK), mouse monoclonal anti-b-tubulin III\nmouse monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody (1:800; Sigma,\nSt. Louis, MO, USA). The nuclei were counterstained\nwith propidium iodide (PI, 50 mg/mL; Sigma, St Louis,\nMO, USA) or DAPI (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). At\nleast three independent experiments were performed for\neach assay.\nMeasurement of ROS in NSPCs\nThe dye 2,7-dichlorofluorescien diacetate (DCF-DA;\nSigma-Aldrich, USA), which is intracellularly oxidized\nto the fluorescent 2,7-dichlorofluorescien (DCF) in the\npresence of oxidants, was used to measure the relative\nlevels of cellular peroxides (Lautraite et al., 2003).\nNSPCs (1 \u00c2 105 cells/mL) were treated with edaravone\n(0 mM or 100 mM) under hypoxia or without edaravone\nunder normoxia for 24 hr, and then incubated with\ntimes with PBS. After centrifugation, the supernatants\nwere removed, and the cells were resuspended with\nPBS. Flow cytometry (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,\nUSA) was used to measure fluorescence at an excita-\ntion wavelength of 502 nm and an emission wavelength\nLei et al. 3\nWestern Blot Analysis\nTo observe HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels,\npassage 1 neurospheres were incubated with edaravone\n(0 or 100 mM) under hypoxia or without edaravone\nunder normoxia for 12 hr and 24 hr, respectively. The\nneurospheres were collected and used for western blot\nanalysis, as described previously (Zheng et al., 2012).\nThe antibodies used included mouse monoclonal anti-b-\nCambridge, UK), and rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-3\nantibody (cleaved, 1:200; Millipore, USA). The enhanced\nchemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific Pierce,\nUSA) visualized the immunoreactive bands using horse-\nradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (1:5,000;\nSanta Cruz, CA, USA). The housekeeping protein b-actin\nwas used as a control. Luminescent signals detected by\nthe charge-coupled-device camera were transmitted to the\ncontroller unit, and the data were sent to the computer\nfor analysis and documentation.\nQuantification and Statistical Analysis\nBrdU-positive cells, DCX-positive cells, BrdU/NeuN,\nBrdU/GFAP, BrdU/TUNEL-positive cells in the SGZ,\nand histological assessment of both brain hemispheres\nwere counted blindly in five 7 -mm sections per animal,\nspaced 49 mm apart. Fluorescence images were digitized\nusing laser confocal microscopy (FV1000, Olympus,\nJapan). The density of positive cells was presented as\nthe total number of positive cells within the SGZ. The\npurpose of quantification was not to estimate the total\nnumber, but to obtain a count within the studied regions\nto compare between different groups. The measurement\ndata were presented as means \u00c6 SD and analyzed by two-\ntailed Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA, followed by\nBonferroni correction. The Mann\u00adWhitney U test\nanalyzed the histological grading scores of severity of\nneuronal damage. The Kruskal\u00adWallis test was used for\ndata analysis from cell culture. A p value less than .05\nindicated a statistically significant difference.\nResults\nTreatment With Edaravone Attenuated CA1 Injury\nand Improved Neurological Function\nTo determine the neuroprotective effect of edaravone\nagainst hippocampal neuronal injury, the brains were\nevaluated histologically 7, 14, and 21 days after ischemia.\nIn the sham-operated group, there was no neuronal\nloss in the hippocampal CA1 region (Figure 1(a)).\nHowever, pronounced neuronal loss was observed in\nthe hippocampal CA1 region of the control group 7\ndays after ischemia (Figure 1(b)). Treatment with edara-\nvone significantly attenuated CA1 neuronal damage com-\npared with the control group (Figure 1(c) and (d),\np < .01). There was no significant difference between the\ncontrol and the edaravone group 14 and 21 days after\nischemia (p > .05, data not shown). Neurological assess-\nment revealed that all animals displayed the maximum\nscore of 21 points preoperatively. Sham-operated animals\nwere not affected by anesthesia or surgical procedure and\nretained the maximum score until Day 21 (Figure 1(e)).\nThere was a significant decrease in the neurological\nscore in the ischemic animals from Days 1 to 21, com-\npared with the sham-operated group (Figure 1(e),\np < .01). The neurological score was significantly higher\nin the edaravone-treated group at Days 1\u00ad21 after ische-\nmia, compared with the control group (Figure 1(e),\nTreatment With Edaravone Increased Neurogenesis\nin the SGZ\nTo detect whether edaravone enhanced neurogenesis\nin the SGZ, immunohistochemistry was performed at\ndifferent time points after ischemia. In the sham-\noperated animals, very few BrdU-labeled cells were\nfound in the SGZ after injection of BrdU for 7 consecu-\ntive days (Figure 2(a)). Following ischemia insult,\nincreased BrdU-positive cells were found in the SGZ\nin both the control and edaravone-treated groups com-\npared with the sham-operated group (Figure 2(b) and\n(c)). Additionally, edaravone significantly increased the\nnumber of BrdU-positive cells in the SGZ compared\nwith the control group during the entire postischemic\nperiod (Figure 2(g)). Furthermore, BrdU-positive\ncells coexpressed DCX (Figure 3(a) to (f)) or NeuN\n(Figure 4(a) to (f)) in the SGZ, in both the control and\nedaravone-treated groups 7 days after ischemia.\nHowever, very few BrdU-positive cells coexpressing\nDCX (Figure 3(g) to (i)) or NeuN (Figure 4(g) to (i))\nwere observed in the SGZ of the sham-operated rats.\nThe number of DCX-positive cells in the SGZ was not\nsignificantly different between the control and edaravone-\ntreated groups at 7 days postischemia (Figure 2(h),\np > .05). Interestingly, the number of BrdU-positive\ncells expressing NeuN was significantly higher in the\ntreated group compared with the control group at 7\ndays postischemia (28.4 \u00c6 1.0 cells/SGZ). The number\nof BrdU-positive cells expressing GFAP was not signifi-\ncantly different in the SGZ between the edaravone group\n(5.8 \u00c6 0.1 cells/SGZ, Figure 5(d) to (f)) and the control\n14 days after ischemia. There were no BrdU-positive cells\ncoexpressing GFAP in the SGZ of the sham-operated\nrats (Figure 5(g) to (i)).\n4 ASN Neuro\nTreatment With Edaravone Reduced Apoptosis of\nNewly Generated Cells in the Hippocampus\nTo determine whether edaravone decreased the apoptosis\nof newly generated cells, TUNEL and BrdU double\nstaining was performed at defined time points. There\nwere two distinct patterns of TUNEL staining; some\nTUNEL-stained cells were densely labeled and showed\nclear apoptotic characteristics. Other TUNEL-stained\ncells were weakly labeled and were considered necrotic\ncells. Only densely labeled cells were counted as apop-\ntotic cells (Charriaut-Marlangue and Ben-Ari, 1995).\nIn the sham-operated group, almost no BrdU\u00fe/\nTUNEL\u00fe cells were found in the SGZ (Figure 6(c)).\nAfter ischemia, some of BrdU\u00fe/TUNEL\u00fe cells were\nobserved in the SGZ of the control (Figure 6(a)) and\nedaravone-treated groups (Figure 6(b)). The number of\nBrdU-positive cells expressing TUNEL was significantly\nlower in the SGZ of the edaravone-treated group than\nin the control group at all time points examined\nCharacterization of Cultured NSPCs\nDissociated cells formed neurospheres after 3 days in cul-\nture. The vast majority (96 \u00c6 2%) of the passage 1 cells\nwere nestin-positive (Figure 7(a)). After the differenti-\nation assay, a subpopulation of passage 1 cells exhibited\nimmunoreactivity to GFAP (44 \u00c6 5%, Figure 7(b)) and\nb-tubulin III (21 \u00c6 3%, Figure 7(c)). After placing pas-\nsage 1 cells in the microaerophilic incubation system for\nnestin-positive (Figure 7(d) to (g)). Only a few cells exhib-\nited immunoreactivity to GFAP (3 \u00c6 1%, Figure 7(h) to\n(j)) or b-tubulin III (2 \u00c6 1%, Figure 7(k) to (m)).\nFurthermore, these nestin-positive cells were HIF-1a\nimmunoreactive (Figure 7(d) to (g)). These findings sug-\ngest that passage 1 cells retain the character of NSPCs\nFigure 1. Edaravone attenuated CA1 injury and improved neurological function after global cerebral ischemia.

Spectrophotometric measurement\nof BrdU incorporation in vitro showed that BrdU incorp-\noration was increased in hypoxia conditions compared\nwith normoxic condition (Figure 2(i), p < .01), indicating\nthat hypoxia stimulated the proliferation of NSPCs.\nEdaravone Decreased NSPC Apoptosis and\nDeclined ROS Generation In Vitro\nAs shown in Figure 8(a) to (d), hypoxia increased the\nproportion of apoptotic cells (p < .01), and edaravone\ndecreased NSPC apoptosis, as assessed by TUNEL\nassay (Figure 8(b) to (d), p < .01). To estimate the effect\nof edaravone on ROS generation in NSPCs, passage 1\ncells were treated with edaravone (0 mM or 100 mM)\nunder hypoxia or without edaravone under normoxia\nfor 24 hr, and endogenous ROS generation was measured\nby DCF fluorescence. Hypoxia increased ROS generation\ncompared with normoxia (Figure 8(e), (f), and (h),\np < .01), and treatment with edaravone led to a significant\nreduction in DCF fluorescence compared with the control\ngroup (Figure 8(f) to (h), p < .01). Thus, edaravone sig-\nnificantly reduced intracellular ROS generation after hyp-\noxic insult.\nEdaravone Decreased the Protein Levels of HIF-1\nand Cleaved Caspase-3 in NSPCs\nROS regulates the HIF-1 signaling pathway, depending\non the cell type (Koshikawa et al., 2009).

Both\nHIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels significantly\nincreased in NSPCs at 12 hr and 24 hr following hyp-\noxia compared with normoxic conditions, respectively\n(Figure 9(a) and (b), p < .01). NSPCs treated with\nedaravone showed a significant decrease in HIF-1a\nand cleaved caspase-3 protein levels compared with\nuntreated cells after hypoxic insult (Figure 9(a) and (b),\np < .01). These results indicated that edaravone inhibited\nHIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3 signaling in NSPCs after\nhypoxia.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we found that pre- and posttreatment\nwith edaravone attenuated CA1 injury and improved the\nneurological deficit. Edaravone also increased neurogen-\nesis and reduced apoptosis of newly generated cells in the\nhippocampus. Furthermore, treatment with edaravone\nsignificantly decreased ROS generation, inhibited the pro-\ntein expression of HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3, and\nreduced apoptosis in NSPCs after hypoxic insult.\nThese findings indicated that pre- and posttreatment\nwith edaravone enhances neurogenesis by protecting\nNSPCs from apoptosis, probably mediated by decreasing\nROS generation and inhibiting the protein expression of\nHIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3 after cerebral ischemia.\nFigure 3.

Accumulating\nevidence shows that edaravone ameliorates cortical\nedema, reduces the infarct volume, and improves neuro-\nlogical deficits in rat focal cerebral ischemia, intrace-\nrebral hemorrhage or traumatic brain injury models\n2010). However, the neuroprotective effect of edaravone\non global cerebral ischemia has not been assessed. In ger-\nbils subjected to 5 min transient forebrain ischemia,\nadministration of edaravone 30 min before ischemia atte-\nnuated neuronal damage and improved behavioral def-\nicits (Lu et al., 2012). By contrast, edaravone\nadministered either immediately or 60 min after ischemia\ndid not change the neurological deficits score in a rat\nmodel of global cerebral ischemia induced by 5 min of\ncardiac arrest and resuscitation (Kubo et al., 2009). Our\nobservation that treatment with edaravone reduced the\nneuronal damage of CA1 region and improved neuro-\nlogical deficits in rats subjected to 10 min global cerebral\nischemia is in agreement with a previous study where\nedaravone effectively alleviated brain injury and\nimproved the neurological function after focal cerebral\nischemia-reperfusion injury (Kikuchi et al., 2009). The\ndiscrepancies between outcomes may be related to differ-\nent global cerebral ischemia models and time of admin-\nistration used in these studies. Our regimen might be\nvaluable for using edaravone in patients with high risk\nFigure 4. Representative images of of BrdU and NeuN double immunofluorescence staining 7 days after ischemia.

Interestingly, there was no difference in\nthe number of DCX-positive cells in the SGZ at 7 days\npostischemia between the control and edaravone-treated\ngroups, indicating that edaravone promoted maturation\nof new neurons. It was reported that BrdU-positive cells\nexpressing DCX reached their maximum number\nbetween the 4th and 7th day after ischemia; thereafter,\nDCX expression rapidly declined, and then expression of\nNeuN slowly increased (Brown et al., 2003). Our findings\nare similar to those of a study showing that edaravone\npromotes proliferation of neural progenitor cells gener-\nated following neuronal loss in the mouse DG (Kikuta\net al., 2013) and restores the differentiation of human\nneural precursor cells following X-irradiation (Ishii\net al., 2007). Furthermore, improvement in behavioral\ndeficits was observed in the edaravone-treated rats.\nHowever, edaravone administration did not alter gliogen-\nesis at Day 14 postischemia. In contrast to our previous\nreport that treatment with edaravone decreased\nFigure 5. Representative images of BrdU and GFAP double immunofluorescence staining 14 days after ischemia.

It has been reported that transient\nglobal cerebral ischemia significantly increases neurogen-\nesis in the dentate SGZ, but not in the SVZ (Liu et al.,\n1998). Cell proliferation in the SVZ returned to normal\nlevels; however, that in the SGZ showed a twofold increase\n4 weeks following intermittent hypoxia (Zhu et al., 2005).\nTaken together, the results suggest that neuroprotection of\nNSPCs by edaravone in the DG and SVZ is different.\nGlobal cerebral ischemia resulted in a decrease of\noxygen tension in the hippocampus (Freund et al.,\n1989). Following reperfusion, oxygen tension recovered\nwithin 1 hr in the hippocampus and fell again, often\nbelow the lowest level seen during the ischemic period,\nwhich initiated histological damage observed after 24 hr\noxia and free radicals induce apoptosis in cultured\nobserved that treatment with edaravone markedly\ndecreased NSPC apoptosis in the hippocampus after\nischemia, which agreed with a report that edaravone\nprotected neural progenitor cells in the SGZ of the hippo-\ncampus from cell death after X-irradiation (Motomura\net al., 2010). Additionally, we simulated the oxygen\nlevels in the hippocampus following global cerebral ische-\nmia/reperfusion to investigate the effect of edaravone on\nNSPC apoptosis and its potential mechanism in vitro\nHypoxia stimulated proliferation of NSPCs, and treat-\nment with edaravone increased hypoxia-induced NSPC\nproliferation (data not shown) and decreased cell apop-\ntosis and ROS generation, indicating that enhanced SGZ\nneurogenesis by edaravone treatment was partly attribu-\nted to reduced cell apoptosis. It was reported that ROS\ninduced HIF-1a expression through PI3K-PKB/Ak\nsignaling (Charriaut-Marlangue and Ben-Ari, 1995).\nHIF-1a is involved in ischemia/hypoxia-induced cell\ndeath events by activating the expression of various\npro-death genes during sustained or severe ischemia/hyp-\noxia (Wang et al., 2004). A previous study suggested that\nthere was a causal relationship between HIF-1a and\nFigure 6. Edaravone reduces apoptosis of newly generated cells in the SGZ.

In\nour study, treatment with edaravone led to a decrease\nin intracellular ROS generation, decreased protein levels\nof HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3 and reduced NSPC\napoptosis under hypoxia, indicating that administration\nof edaravone protect NSPCs from apoptosis, probably by\ninhibiting HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3 pathway.\nIn conclusion, using a model of transient cerebral\nischemia and hypoxic culture of NSPCs, we found that\npre- and postadministration of edaravone mitigated hip-\npocampal CA1 injury and enhanced neurogenesis by pro-\ntecting NSPCs from apoptosis, which was probably\nmediated by decreasing ROS generation and inhibiting\nprotein expressions of HIF-1a and cleaved caspase-3\nafter cerebral ischemia. Our results suggest a novel\nROS-dependent HIF-1a-mediated caspase-3 activation\npathway that leads to NSPC apoptosis and provides an\nexperimental basis for the use of edaravone as a prevent-\nive and protective drug against global cerebral ischemia.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nwork was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation\nFigure 8.
