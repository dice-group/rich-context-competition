To date, only a few tumour\nbiomarkers have been established for high\ngrade ovarian cancer.5 Serum cancer antigen\nto be an important marker.5,6 However, it is\nmore useful for guiding treatment rather\nthan predicting the prognosis in patients\nwith ovarian cancer.7 The G protein-\ncoupled oestrogen receptor (GPR30) which\nin numerous organs8\u00ad11 and in primary\ncarcinomas of these organs.12 Although the\nreceptor's promotion by oestrogen has been\nextensively studied10,11, the potential signal-\nling pathway of GPR30 is still unclear.\nThe purpose of this study was to deter-\nmine the intracellular localization of GPR30\nin tissue samples from women with ovarian\ncancer and elucidate its impact in the disease.\nTo this end, nuclear and cytoplasmic GPR30\nexpressions were correlated with clinico-\npathological characteristics and survival out-\ncomes in patients with ovarian cancer.\nMethods\nTissue microarrays (TMAs) were created\nfrom patients with epithelial ovarian cancer\nwho underwent surgery in the First Affiliated\nHospital, Sun Yat-sen University, China\nEach sample was identified by the admission\nnumber of patient. The samples were fixed\nwith formalin and embedded in paraffin.\nClinicopathological data were collected\nbefore and after surgery and recorded in the\npatients' medical records as were five year\nfollow-up data. Data were extracted and\nrecorded by two physicians (C.Z. and G.N.)\nAll TMAs were subjected to immunohis-\ntochemistry. Nuclear GPR30 was evaluated\nusing rabbit polyclonal antibody SP4674P\n(Acris Antibodies GmbH, Germany) while\ncytoplasmic GPR30 was evaluated using\nantibody LS-A4290 (LifeSpan BioSciences,\nGermany). Positive controls were made\nusing multiorganic arrays including breast\ntissue known to express GPR30 and nega-\ntive controls consisted of GPR30-expressing\novarian cancer tissue incubated with a\nmatched isotype antibody.\nIn brief, all specimens were de-paraffi-\nnized in ethanol and subsequently rehy-\ndrated in a descending graded series of\nalcohol concentrations.13 Epitope retrieval\nwas accomplished by pressure cooking the\nsamples in a 0.01 M citric acid buffer (pH,\n6.0). Endogenous immunoglobulins in the\ntissue were blocked by incubating in fresh\nfor 20 minutes at room tempera-\nture. Following multiple washes, all TMAs\nwere incubated with the GPR30-specific\n(4g/mL) for 60 mins at room temperature.\nAfter scanning with the Nano Zoomer\nHamamatsum, Japan), the immunohisto-\nchemical staining analysis was interpreted\nby two independent pathologists (H.S. and\nH.C.) who were blinded to the clinical data.\nPositive GPR30 expression was defined as a\nstaining intensity of grade 2\u00fe or more from\na scale that ranged from 0 (negative), 1\u00fe\n(weak), 2\u00fe (moderate) and 3\u00fe (strong).\nImmunofluorescence was used to deter-\nmine the intracellular localization of GPR30\nin the ovarian cancer cell line, SKOV-3\n(American Type Culture Collection,\nRockville, MD). To block non-specific\nbinding, viable SKOV-3 cells were pre-\ntreated with phosphate buffered saline, 1%\nbovine serum albumin or 0.1% saponin.\napplied and incubated with the cells for\n30 min, while isotype control was incubated\nand diluted to the same final antibody\nprotein concentration.14\nAfter blocking and washing, secondary\n6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1mg/ml),\nwere applied.

Part 1 (top left) shows the blue fluorescence resulting from 4',6-diamidino-2-\nphenylindole (DAPI) labelling suggesting nuclear binding; Part 2 (top right) shows the green fluorescence\nresulting from Alexa-488 labelling identifying GPR30 receptors; Part 3 (bottom left) show the SKOV-3\ncells without fluorescence; Part 4 (bottom right) shows the integrated picture with DAPI and Alxea-488\nfluorescence.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to\nreport that nuclear GPR30 expression is a\nsignificant, independent negative prognostic\nfactor for overall survival in patients with\novarian cancer, although it does not predict\n5-year progression free survival. The study\nalso found that cytoplasmic GPR30 was not\npredictive of patient outcome in ovarian\ncancer. Similar results were found in the\nsubgroup of patients with high grade ovar-\nian cancer. Therefore, we hypothesise that\nGPR30 located in the nucleus, rather than in\nthe cytoplasm, is involved in carcinogenesis.\nInterestingly, nuclear GPR30 expression\nwas common in patients with recurrence\neven though it did not predict lower 5-year\nprogression free survival which previously\nhas been shown to be associated with\nsignificantly correlated with any other\nclinicopathological characteristics which\nincluded FIGO stage, nuclear grade status,\nhistology and the presence of ascites.\nPrevious studies have failed to define the\nrole of GPR30 expression in ovarian cancer,\nalthough its expression was widely found in\nvarious cancer cell lines.16\u00ad19 One study\nreported that GPR30 expression predicted\npoor outcome in advanced ovarian cancer, a\nfinding which supports our observations.20\nFigure 2.

(c) Overall survival by cytoplasmic GPR30\nstatus. (d) 5-year Progression-free survival by cytoplasmicGPR30 status.\nAnother study found that there was no\ncorrelation between GPR30 mRNA and\nprotein with patients' clinical parameters.21\nIn that study, only one-third of the patients\nhad malignant ovarian cancer and the cor-\nrelation between GPR30 and outcome was\nconfirmed by univariate analysis which\nexcluded several clinical characteristics. By\ncontrast, in this present study, multivariate\nanalysis was used to determine the impact of\nGPR30 on overall survival and 5-year pro-\ngression free survival. Our data suggest that\nnuclear GPR30 is an independent prognos-\ntic factor, even after adjustment for other\nprognostic factors such as FIGO stage,\nhistological grade, and patient age.\nWe found that GPR30 expression was\nnot associated with 5-year progression\nfree survival. By contrast, another study\nreported that GPR30 expression played a\nTable 3.

Unlike the previous study\nwhich spanned two years, we followed our\npatients over five years, which may have\naccounted for the difference in results.\nThe intracellular localization of GPR30 is\ndescribed as having a 7-membrane spanning\nexpression was observed in both the cyto-\nplasm and nuclei of cells from ovarian\ncancer tissues. In vitro, GPR30 expression\nwas not detected on the membrane of\nSKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells without pre-\ntreatment but intracellular GPR30 was\ndetected after cell pre-treatment with 0.1%\nsaponin. Saponin form complexes with chol-\nesterol to create pores in the cell membrane\nbilayers. In addition, the amphipathic\nnature of saponin provides it with surfactant\nactivity which enhances the penetration of\nmacromolecules through cell membranes.24\nOur findings are supported by another study\nthat also found both cytoplasmic and\nnuclear GPR30 staining in ovarian cancer\nThe study had limitations. For instance,\nonly immunohistochemical staining was\nused and the population was confined to\npatients with epithelial ovarian cancer.\nTherefore, other studies are required to\nelucidate the function and role of GPR30\nmore fully in ovarian cancer. Two major\nquestions remain unanswered: the mechan-\nism by which GPR30 aggregates in the\nnucleus and the function of nuclear GPR30.\nIn conclusion, the study showed that\nGPR30 expression varied in different histo-\nlogical subtypes of ovarian cancer. In add-\nition, nuclear GPR30 predicted poor overall\nsurvival and 5-year progression free survival\nin patients with ovarian cancer, whereas\ncytoplasmic GPR30 expression was not\nassociated with outcome. The study also\nshowed that nuclear GPR30 expression was\nan independent prognostic factor for overall\nsurvival but not 5-year progression free\nsurvival. Furthermore, nuclear GPR30\nsignificantly predicted lower overall survival\nand 5-year progression free survival in\npatients with high grade ovarian cancer.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
