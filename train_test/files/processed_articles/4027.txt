In its infancy, Darwin's work was a hotbed of controversy with liberal and\nprogressive intellectuals climbing on board almost instantly and many conservative\nevangelicals launching their strongest counter campaigns. A century and a half later, and\nwith a mountain of supporting data, evolution is still contested within the scientific\ncommunity.\nIn the closing pages of his monumental text, On the Origin of Species by Means of\nNatural Selection (1859), Darwin offered a glimpse of his dream for the future: \"In the\nAcceptance of and resistance to evolutionary psychology\ndistant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based\non a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity\nThe distant future to which Darwin envisioned is finally upon us. The relatively\nnew field of evolutionary psychology is beginning to change the way psychologists study\nthe human mind and is allowing psychologists to look at human behavior in exciting new\nways. However, with progress comes opposition and this field is no exception. Unlike the\nbiological sciences, evolutionary theory has not enjoyed the warm reception for which\nDarwin might have hoped. Psychology as a whole is yet to accept Darwin's theory as the\nfoundation of scientific inquiry, but at the very least evolutionary psychologists finally\nhave a seat at the table.\nevolutionary psychology. Although his tone was one of hopeful optimism, Buss's words\nwere describing a newborn paradigm in the midst of the field of psychology--a field that\nhas been characterized by disarray. However, this budding model known as evolutionary\npsychology was also in the dawn of psychological breakthroughs and new empirical\nmethods. It has now been over 150 years after Darwin's historic discovery, so let us once\nagain briefly examine the future of a psychology based on evolutionary principles.\nEvolutionary Psychology Today\nDespite a measure of evolutionary acceptance and multiple calls for unity, the field\nof psychology remains highly segregated. A number of commentators have highlighted the\nmany problems associated with this fragmentation and have offered theories to aid in a\n2008; Wilson, 1998). These problems, all of which have arisen from philosophical conflict\nbetween the divided sub-disciplines of psychology (Goertzen, 2008), include differences in\nmethodological approaches, theoretical approaches, conceptual assumptions and\ninterpretations, as well as a general lack of unity in subject matter (Henriques, 2003, 2008).\nUntil psychology is united upon a common theoretical framework, it will continue to suffer\nfrom these problems.\ndevelopmental, and social), along with other areas, including biological psychology,\nclinical psychology, and behaviorism, are still independent of each other. However,\nevolutionary psychology is beginning to show promise as the unifying paradigm upon\nwhich all of these different sub-disciplines of psychology can eventually merge, creating an\namalgamation that results in a single organized theory that is focused on the research of\nhuman and animal behavior. While the chances of a field-wide adoption of evolutionary\nprinciples in the very near future is rather slim, a closer look reveals evidence that the\nprocess of integrating evolutionary principles has begun in every major sub-discipline of\npsychology.\nCognitive Psychology\nThe cognitive revolution of the 1960's acted as a counterbalance to the radical\nbehaviorism that dominated psychology for the first half of the twentieth century.\nPsychologists and philosophers began to realize that they could not talk about human\nAcceptance of and resistance to evolutionary psychology\nbehavior without discussing human beliefs and desires--products of the human mind, a\nconcept that had been off limits throughout the behaviorist movement. As a result, the mind\nwas once again fair game for scientific study. The development of the computer and ground\nbreaking work in artificial intelligence offered a new testing ground to support the notion of\nmental processes and would ultimately refute some of the long held tenets of behaviorism\n(Evans and Zarate, 1999). In response to the waning reputation of the field of psychology\nand its nomenclature, researchers such as Noam Chomsky (1957) and George Miller (1951)\nbegan to call their new line of research \"cognitive science\" (see Miller (2003) for a\nhistorical review).\nThe new approach to cognition brought with it a renewed interest in the biological\nunderpinnings of thought and psychological behavior. Researchers such as David Marr\n(1982) began to theorize that cognition must require a great deal of processing within the\nbrain and ethologists such as E.O Wilson (1975) hypothesized that this processing is\ndetermined by our mental architecture and, as such, is and has always been subject to the\npressures of evolution. Ultimately, some cognitive scientists adopted biological\nmethodology to mapping the functionality of the brain and thus cognitive neuroscience was\nborn.\nFinally, a full integration of biological approaches and cognitive science has\nemerged in the form of an evolutionary cognitive neuroscience. In its simplest form,\nevolutionary cognitive neuroscience is the merging of the fields of evolutionary psychology\nand cognitive neuroscience using methodology from both disciplines and guidance from\nevolutionary meta-theory (Krill, Platek, Goetz, and Shackelford, 2007). With these new\napproaches to the study of human thought and behavior as well as an ever increasing\ninterest in evolutionary biology, a new synthesis has been created (Wilson, 1975) and has\nultimately led to the development of evolutionary psychology.\nAlthough determining the development of cognitive abilities over evolutionary\nhistory has been a daunting task, scientific theories and supporting evidence have been\nrising. For instance, evolutionary theories on the acquisition of memory (Klein, Cosmides,\nand Tooby, 2002) have developed as well as primate studies supporting an evolution of\nsocial cognition (Byrne and Whiten, 1992). In fact, Steven Platek and colleagues' recent\nwork in evolutionary cognitive neuroscience has shed light onto many evolutionary\nprinciples, including perceptions of facial resemblance, paternity uncertainty, and physical\nattraction. Using fMRI technology, these researchers have found that men and women\nperceive facial similarity between themselves and children relatively equally; however,\nmen react and invest more favorably in children that resemble them than women do \u00ad\nsupporting the evolutionary theory that men do not want to waste resources on children that\nmay not be theirs (as indicated by physical similarity) (Platek et al, 2004). Using fMRI\ntechnology has also shown that viewing attractive women activates the reward centers in\nthe brain \u00ad and the women perceived as attractive always had the standard .70 waist-to-hip\nratio \u00ad which is highly correlated with female reproductive success (Platek and Singh,\nSince cognitive psychology's main focus is on internal mechanisms rather than\nenvironmental factors, evolutionary psychology has had a little easier transition into this\narea than others, but that is not to say that evolutionary psychology has been completely\naccepted within the realm of cognitive psychology (For more information on this\nintegration, see Todd, Hertwig, and Hoffrage, 2005).\nAcceptance of and resistance to evolutionary psychology\nDevelopmental Psychology\nIn the early to middle of the 20th century, researchers such as Gesell (1928) and\nPiaget (1955) brought forth the expansion of developmental psychology. These\npsychologists were some of the first to find support for theories reflecting the biologically\npredetermined cognitive development of humans (Parke and Clarke-Stewart, 2003). Since\nnature and nurture both play a role in human development, empirical methods in\ndevelopmental psychology, such as monozygotic twin studies, have allowed behavioral\ngenetics to explain human development as well (see Segal and Hill (2005) for a full\nreview).\nEvolutionary psychology has been able to mingle with behavioral genetics in the\narea of human development--creating theoretical explanations for the empirical data that\nbehavioral geneticists have found (Mealey, 2001). With evolutionary theories and research\ncombining with genetics data, developmental psychologists have begun to recognize many\nevolutionary theories as relevant to developmental psychology (Bjorklund and Ellis, 2005).\nEvolutionary theories have been incorporated into most, if not all, aspects of human\ndevelopment, including pregnancy (Flaxman and Sherman, 2000), child development\n(Bjorklund and Ellis, 2005), and puberty and adolescence (Ellis, 2005; Weisfeld and\nJanisse, 2005). Evolutionary theories on seemingly harmful phenomena that occur during\nhuman development, such as pregnancy sickness (Flaxman and Sherman, 2000) and the\nslow maturation rate of humans when compared to other primates (Dunbar, 1992), have\nbecome accepted as beneficial evolved mechanisms. This is the beginning of an\nincorporation of evolutionary principles into developmental psychology.\nSocial Psychology\nSocial psychology has been prominent since the late 19th century with the\npublications of William James' The Principles of Psychology in 1890 and James Baldwin's\nSocial and Ethical Interpretations in Mental Development: A Study in Social Psychology in\n1897. These texts spawned theories with a focus on relating psychological events to social\ninteraction (Morawski and Bayer, 2003). With a century of developing theories and\nempirical progress, social psychologists have argued that one's environment (i.e.,\ninteraction with others) influences internal psychological phenomena and is therefore the\nfoundation for social behavior.\nEvolutionary psychologists have been working diligently to show that natural and\nsexual selection are the underpinnings of social behavior. Current evolutionary theories on\nhuman interaction, including altruism (Hamilton, 1964; Trivers, 1971), sexual attraction\nand Wilson, 1988) have gained scientific support and respect, slowly inching their way into\nsocial psychology. In fact, social behavior in non-human primate studies have been\nshowing striking similarities to social behavior in humans. For instance, chimpanzees are\nthe only other species besides humans that are known to partake in warfare \u00ad defined as\ncoalitional aggression consisting of groups of larger than four members (although evidence\nsuggests the possibility that dolphins may also belong in this group) (Tooby and Cosmides,\nThe current relationship between evolutionary and social psychology shows hints of\npromise toward cooperation between the two fields. Although evolutionary psychology has\nAcceptance of and resistance to evolutionary psychology\nbeen met with severe opposition from social psychologists, Kenrick, Maner, and Li (2005)\nfound an increasing number of social psychology textbooks have been incorporating\nevolutionary psychology, albeit with greater scrutiny and criticism toward evolutionary\npsychology's theories and methods than toward social psychology's theories and methods.\nEvolutionary psychologists' empirical findings pertaining to many social phenomena, such\nas kin relations (Anderson, Kaplan, and Lancaster, 1999; Burnstein, Crandall, and\nKitayama, 1994), group identification (Henrich and Boyd, 1998), and culture (Boyd and\nRicherson, 2005) indicate a possibility of future acceptance between evolutionary\npsychology and social psychology.\nEvolutionary principles are also being incorporated into many social behaviors \u00ad\nand not strictly in an academic setting. David Buss's (1994) book The Evolution of Desire\ndiscussed the evolutionary basis for mating behavior in humans \u00ad from dating to sex to\nmarriage and infidelity. But over the past few years, many popular books related to pickup\nartists have been incorporating the principles that Buss (1994) described into successful\ndating strategies. Books such as Neil Strauss's (2005) The Game: Penetrating the Secret\nSociety of Pickup Artists, as well as several others, have opened many people's eyes to the\nuse of gaining women's attention through the activation of many evolutionary principles of\nattraction. These principles include demonstrating high social status, displaying a large\namount of resources, and maintaining a healthy physical image (as an unhealthy one is\nassociated with disease and sickness). As evolutionary research shows, these behaviors are\noften characteristic of the dominant alpha male of hunter-gatherer tribes and even\nchimpanzees (Buss, 1989; De Waal, 1982). These pickup artists also delve into the\nbehavior necessary for successfully approaching and dating women by using social\nbehaviors that we developed in our hunter-gatherer ancestry. Thus, we can see that not only\nis evolutionary psychology being incorporated into social psychological theories, it is also\nbeing used in the actual social world. However, social psychologists still seem to view\nevolutionary psychology with reluctance and criticism (Kenrick et al., 2005).\nBiological Psychology\nPsychologists have been linking the brain to behavior for generations (see\nThompson and Zola (2003) for a full history). However, the technological advancements of\nthe 20th century (e.g., the electron microscope, fMRI machines, etc.) have helped biological\npsychology develop rapidly. Studying patients with brain damage and/or neurological\ndisorders has brought about mounds of undeniable evidence linking specific behaviors to\nneurotransmitter release in specific brain structures.\nSince the inception of the Human Genome Project in 1990, biological psychology\nhas begun adopting evolutionary principles quite rapidly. Because behavior is often linked\nto the release of specific neurotransmitters, revealing that certain genes are responsible for\nthese neurotransmitters (e.g., which neurotransmitters are released, how much is released,\nhow often they are released, etc.) has allowed for the integration of evolutionary theory into\nbiological research.\nIn recent years, genetic research has linked multiple genes to specific behaviors and\nsome disorders (e.g., Huntington's disease (MacDonald et al., 1993), further fueling\nevolutionary psychology's incorporation into biological psychology. In fact, recent\nresearch has found a gene that is responsible for modulating the amount of vasopressin\nreleased in the brain, which is linked to monogamous behavior (Walum et al., 2008).\nAcceptance of and resistance to evolutionary psychology\nUltimately, the relationship between evolutionary psychology and biological psychology is\nrapidly growing in acceptance.\nClinical Psychology\nClinical psychology has maintained a central focus on the etiology and treatment of\nmental illness (see Routh and Reisman (2003) for a full history). Connecting mental illness\nto physiological abnormalities within the brain has facilitated the invention of treatments\nfor many psychological disorders, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for\ndepression, methylphenidate for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and\natypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia. However, the definitive causes to most\npsychological disorders remain undetermined. Since mental illness has a physiological\nbasis, is heritable, and is prevalent across cultures, evolutionary psychological theories may\nbe necessary to discover these unknown causes.\nEvolutionary approaches to clinical psychology have brought about several theories\npertaining to the onset of mental disorders (see Nesse (2005a) for a full review). Many of\nthese disorders may have been positively selected, including ADHD (Baird, Stevenson, and\nlike schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, which only have a 1% rate of\nincidence, are met with many theories (Byrne, Agerbo, Ewald, and Eaton, 2003; Malaspina\net al., 2002; Swedo, Leonard, Garvey, and Mittleman, 2004), only a few of which argue\nBecause evolutionary psychologists have not discovered a new treatment for any\nmental disorder, clinicians have been reluctant to accept evolutionary psychology as an\nunderlying paradigm (Nesse, 2005a). Research into the evolutionary etiology of mental\ndisorders has been promising but conflicting as well. Perhaps more collaborative ventures\nbetween clinical and evolutionary psychologists could yield some interesting and beneficial\noutcomes, such as the discovery of direct causes, or new cures, of mental disorders.\nHowever, until that point is reached clinical psychologists will continue to disregard\nevolutionary psychology as a legitimate framework for clinical psychology (Nesse, 2005a).\nBehaviorism\nAs every introductory psychology text shows, the behaviorism movement began\naround the turn of the 20th century with Pavlov's classical conditioning. Throughout the\n1900s behaviorism progressed from the strict classical conditioning of John Watson to B.F.\nSkinner's radical behaviorism, which accepted the ideas of private events within the\norganism but still focused on the manipulation of one's environment. Radical behaviorism\nhas arguably brought about the birth of modern behavior analysis, which is still a thriving\narea of study today.\nEven though behaviorism is centered on how one's environment can influence\nbehavior, the fact that behaviorists are studying behavior in animals (e.g., rats and pigeons)\nand generalizing their findings to other species, especially humans, is ripe with\nevolutionary theory. Since all creatures share common ancestry, albeit in some instances it\nis extremely distant, we all tend to have certain features that are similar, such as the more\nprimitive parts of the central nervous system. Because humans share a common ancestry\nwith other species, many behavioral findings are generalizable across species, which\nAcceptance of and resistance to evolutionary psychology\nexplains why medicinal drug testing begins with animals before being approved for human\nclinical trials. Even the great behaviorist B.F. Skinner (1986) admitted to evolution playing\na role in behavior, so it would seem as though behaviorists are on the track toward\nincorporating evolutionary psychology into their theories and experimental methods.\nCurrently, behavior analysis is performed on rats and generalized to human\nbehavior quite extensively. These areas include the relationships between brain structures\nand taste and odor aversion (Lasiter, Deems, and Garcia, 1985), fear and anxiety responses\n(Chen, Rainnie, Greene, and Tonegawa, 1994; Kudo et al., 2007), as well as symptoms of\npsychological disorders such as addiction (Nestler, 2000, 2001) and ADHD (Sagvolden,\nRussell, Aase, Johansen, and Farshbaf, 2005; Hand, Fox, and Reilly, 2006; Fox, Hand, and\nReilly, 2008) to name a few. The between-species generalization occurring in these works,\nas well as many others, implies a blossoming relationship between evolutionary\npsychology and behaviorism.\nA Call for Continued Action\nAs the research shows, these sub-disciplines are beginning to show signs of\nadopting evolutionary psychology as their theoretical foundation. Along with landmark\npublications such as The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology (Buss, 2005) and The\nAdapted Mind (Barkow, Tooby and Cosmides, 1992), evolutionary psychology has begun\nto develop into a paradigm that can be applied to any sub-discipline of psychology. In other\nwords, the sub-disciplines of psychology are becoming evolutionized (Bjorklund and Blasi,\nevolutionary social psychology, evolutionary developmental psychology, and now an\nFor as long as psychology has been in existence, attempts have been made to unify\nthe knowledge within it. Most recently, evolutionary psychologists have made a concerted\neffort to unify the field into an \"increasingly seamless system of interconnected\nknowledge\" (Tooby and Cosmides, 1992, p. 19). However, despite a great deal of support\nfor the unification of psychology, dissenters have voiced their opinions rather stridently\nattempted to argue that evolutionary psychology functions on the basis of \"just-so\" stories.\nMore specifically, he argues that evolutionary psychologists base conclusions simply on\nviewing anecdotal evidence from humans and other animals. The arguments against the use\nof evolutionary principles, however, seem to miss the point. As Holcomb (1996) pointed\nout, \"just-so\" stories are merely accusations rooted in confusion over evolution and\nexperimentation.\nAlthough other dissenters may not attack the foundation of evolutionary psychology\nitself, they take aim at the argument for consilience of psychology on evolutionary\nprinciples. As Derksen (2005) has argued, the disunity in psychology reflects the diversity\nof human development and interactions across the world. Having multiple sub-disciplines\nallows psychologists to specialize in a specific area of that diversity. Psychologists are then\nable to interact with other psychologists to reflect on this diversity in human behavior. To\ncreate a completely unified psychology may result in the loss of this diversity and has thus\nTo unify the field of psychology with seamless boundaries is not the reason\nevolutionary psychology should be the overarching scheme as Derksen (2005) and others\nAcceptance of and resistance to evolutionary psychology\nwould have psychologists believe. Evolutionary psychology should be a unifying factor\nmerely as a by-product of its actual function--to simplify and explain the functional origins\nof a large number of human psychological processes. In short, it should be accepted as a\ndominant theory or perhaps the meta-theory because human cognition, culture, and\nbehavior cannot be disconnected from human biology. Thus, an evolutionary approach is\nparamount to a complete understanding of psychological processes. However, it would be\nirresponsible and incorrect to suggest that evolutionary psychology would or should create\na completely homogenous integration of disciplines. To do so would imply that a future\npsychology would only be an evolutionary psychology with all other sub-disciplines\nabsorbed within it. The reality of an evolutionary psychology meta-theory, in our view, is a\nset of more completely informed sub-disciplines with evolutionary theory serving as a\npowerful paradigm. However, in the absence of a model in which to follow, there is\npotential for further segregation as disagreements over the role of the paradigm in each sub-\ndiscipline are likely.\nThis may sound bleak; but as the literature shows, evolutionary psychology is\nslowly inching its way into each of psychology's sub-disciplines. However, evolutionary\npsychologists must remain aware of this integration process because it is still being met\nwith severe resistance from many researchers in most, if not all, sub-disciplines. There are\ncountless benefits that could be gained through the consilience of psychology (Goertzen,\ntheoretical framework equipped to unite all of the sub-disciplines together (Saad, 2007,\n2008). Therefore, evolutionary psychologists must all remain vigilant researchers and\ntheorists, continuing on the current road of progress that this review has shown. As more\nevolutionary psychological research and theories are produced, the closer all psychologists\ncome to a unified science of psychology.\nEvolutionary Psychology Outside the Academic Realm\nThe progress made toward the integration of evolutionary principles into all areas of\nthe natural and social sciences over the past 150 years has been immense. Subsequently,\nevolutionary psychology is slowly being met with greater acceptance within the other sub-\ndisciplines of psychology. However, it has also been met with disbelief and opposition.\nMany people still resist evolutionary psychology because of false assumptions, such as\nthose pertaining to the erroneous theory of genetic determinism and the horrific policy of\neugenics.\nReligion has also offered an area of persistent resistance. During the 2008\npresidential primary, Barack Obama was criticized for making a statement regarding how\nAmerican citizens cling to their guns and religion during economic hardship. He was not\nfar from the truth. People are driven into frenzies when their religion is challenged. This\nhas been revealed throughout history by the amount of wars and terrorist acts started in the\nname of religion (the Crusades, the World Trade Center attacks, etc.).\nOn a more optimistic note, the Catholic Church's recent acceptance of evolution\nand genetics indicates that religious figures are increasingly accepting scientific findings.\nSimilarly, continuous research and theory have been showing the differences between\nevolutionary psychology and genetic determinism (Dawkins, 2006). In addition, eugenics\nhas not been a widely accepted policy for over 60 years. Thus, evolutionary psychology\nstill has a road of resistance ahead; but if evolutionary researchers continue to work at the\nAcceptance of and resistance to evolutionary psychology\ncurrent pace, evolutionary psychology will eventually overcome these oppositions and\nbecome the foundation of psychology as a united field.\nReferences\nAnderson, K.
