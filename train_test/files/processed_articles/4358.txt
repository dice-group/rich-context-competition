Legitimacy, for example,\nis no longer modeled as the number of organizations in a population. It is now thought to be dependent on how audience\nmembers perceive these organizations. It is believed that audiences penalize organizations that span categories because they\ncannot make much sense of them. This article will argue that category spanning dynamics follow the pattern proposed by\nthe resource partitioning theory, thereby questioning the legitimacy of the claim that category spanning is detrimental to\norganization survival. Instead, the article develops a two-level model which distinguishes between category spanning and\ncluster spanning. The article will argue that cluster spanning, and not category spanning, increases the mortality hazard of\norganizations during all time periods. The theory is then tested within the context of the Lebanese newspaper industry\n(1851-1974). The result of both cluster analysis and survival analysis supports the two-level model.\n",

This line of research points to the nega-\ntive impact that spanning categories have on the life chances\nof the organizations (Hsu, 2006; Hsu, Hannan, & Ko\u00e7ak,\nabide by social codes is confronted with the need of organi-\nzations to differentiate themselves from the competitors\nLiterature Review\nOne of the earliest, and most important, theoretical develop-\nments of organizational ecologists was the notion of niche\nwidth.1 According to Freeman and Hannan (1983), \"niche\nwidth refers to a population's tolerance for changing levels\nof resources, its ability to resist competitors, and its response\nto other factors that inhibit growth\" (p. 1118). The concept of\nniche width is at the heart of the study of generalist and spe-\ncialist organizations. In essence, the study of the distribution\nand the dynamics of these two types of organizations is the\nstudy of niche width (Hannan & Freeman, 1977). Subsequent\nstudies have compared the founding, disbanding, and sur-\nvival rates of organizations that were classified into one of\nthese two types. In his seminal paper, Carroll (1985) studied\nhow the dynamics of generalists in fact led to the prolifera-\ntion of specialists. The fundamental point made by that paper\nwas that the two types of organizations were in fact con-\nnected in the resource space and that the activities of one\ngroup had a significant effect on the dynamics of the other.\nThe resource partitioning theory provides a very attractive\ntheoretical framework for explaining real-world phenome-\nnon that ran counter to dominant theories that predicted\n1Rafik Hariri University, Beirut, Lebanon\nCorresponding Author:\nNajib A.

In a\nsimilar manner, institutionalists posit that organizational\nfields are subjected to a strong force which pushes them in\nthe direction of homogenization (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983;\nMarch, 1981). If organizations are forced to become homo-\ngeneous due to environmental pressures, then how can we\nexplain the coexistence of both generalists and specialists in\na diverse set of mature industries (Carroll & Hannan, 2004)?\nThe resource partitioning theory provided a very plausible\nexplanation.\nAn important question that researchers were faced with\nwas how to determine the niche width of organizations. In\nother words, how do we decide which organization was a\nspecialist and which was a generalist? This question is of\nfundamental importance because the researcher must be able\nto systematically classify the organizations into the proper\ngroup. Previously, this question was answered using a dis-\ncrete mechanism. In their study of restaurants, Freeman and\neralists, fast-food establishment, and specialists. Carroll\n(1985) defined as generalists those organizations which pub-\nlished one or more general interest newspapers, while clas-\nsifying the rest as specialists. Carroll and Swaminathan\nnizations in one of three forms: mass producers, microbrew-\neries, and brewpubs. Boone, Carroll, and van Witteloostuijn\n(2002) considered the national newspapers which operated\nin every province to be the generalists, while local newspa-\npers were taken as the specialists. Lomi (1995) divided the\nbanks into core national banks and rural cooperative banks.\nSome studies attempted to develop more flexible mea-\nsures to determine the niche width of organizations. Baum\nand Singh (1994) used a measure of niche width which was\nbased on the age groups which centers catered to; McPherson\n(1983) utilized a measure which was based on the demo-\ngraphic information of the members of voluntary organiza-\ntions; Dobrev, Kim, and Carroll (2002) utilized the size of\nthe organization to create a continuum along which the larger\nthe organization the more \"generalist\" it was; Dobrev, Kim,\nand Hannan (2001) measured the niche width of an automo-\nbile producer as the spread of engine capacity over all mod-\nels that are produced by a firm, but they only use the\nmaximum and minimum engine capacities; and Hsu (2006)\ncalculated the niche width as the number genres that each\nfilm was classified under. With the exception of the use of\nsize as an indicator for the level of generalism, which is in\nall these measures share a basic assumption, and that is that\nthe organization is a full-fledged member of each area in the\nresource space which it targets.\nIn recent years, P\u00f3los, Hannan, and Carroll have devel-\noped a new theoretical framework which was based on the\nuse of nonmonotonic logic (Hannan, P\u00f3los, & Carroll, 2007;\nvious theoretical models is that \"instead of treating catego-\nries as analytic, as products of researchers distinctions, we\nassume that the members of audience segments create cate-\ngories and forms\" (Hannan et al., 2007, p. 33). In their view,\naudience members, be they regular customers or industry\ncritics, tend to group similar organizations into categories to\nwhich they assign labels.2 Organizations are no longer\nthought of as being full-fledged members of the category or\nnot being members at all. Instead, each producer is assigned\na grade of membership3 which can take any value between,\nand including, zero and one.\nUsing this new formulation, Hsu et al. (2009) revisited the\ntopic of niche width. They proposed a measure which\nallowed for examining \"the degrees of generalism, rather\nthan a binary comparison of specialists versus non-special-\nSimpson's index of diversity (Simpson, 1949):\n- ( )\n ( )\n( )\n\nl l m\ni l\nx\n\u00b5 ,\nwhere \u00b5\ni l\nx\n( )\n( ) represents the grade of membership of the\nproducer in the category l. The grade of membership was\ndetermined by the following formula:\n\u00b5i l\ni\nx\nl x\nl\n( ) =\n( )\n,\nwhere l\nx\nis the total number of labels applied to the pro-\nducer x. The numerator was set to one when a certain label\nwas applied to the producer and to zero otherwise. The\nSimpson's index can take on any value in the interval [0, 1],\nwith zero indicating that the producer spans only a single\ncategory in which his grade of membership is one. The\nhigher the index the higher the degree of generalism. This\nnew conceptualization of the niche width was used in several\nstudies, thus replacing the old binary classification scheme.\nKovacs and Hannan (2009) took the next logical step by\nproposing that the niche width of organizations needs to\naccount for, at least to some degree, the structure of the cat-\negory space.4 According to them, the measure of niche width\nneeds to include the \"distance\" between the categories that\nan organization spans. They argued that spanning categories\nthat were close to one another should increase the niche\nwidth of the organization far less than spanning categories\nthat had a large distance between them. The grade of mem-\nbership of a certain producer was now modified so that the\nmagnitude of the decline in the grade of membership\ndepended on the distance between the labels. Next, the\nauthors tackle the question of how to determine the distance\nbetween categories. This leads them to adopt the formula\nbased on the work of Shepard (1987) where similarity is\ninversely related to distance. So the question of finding the\ndistance now becomes one of finding the similarity. To find\nthe similarity between two categories, the authors modified\nthe measure proposed by Jaccard (1901) so that it allowed\nfor asymmetry. With these new definitions of grade of mem-\nbership, distance, and similarity, the authors also proposed a\nnew formula for the niche width. The reason for this was that\nif we used Simpson's index together with the new grade of\nmembership formula, then the result can be negative, and\nthis does not make sense (Kovacs & Hannan, 2009).\nDevelopment of Research Problem\nThe topic of niche width is linked to the concept of catego-\nries. Organizations that have a large niche width span catego-\nries while those that have a small niche width tend to\nconcentrate their efforts on specific locations in the resource\nspace (Hsu et al., 2009). The work of Kovacs and Hannan\n(2007) all point in the same direction: Spanning categories is\nhave shown that critics and analysts penalize products that\ndo not fit in certain categories due to confusion over the\nproduct's identity, while Zuckerman and Kim (2003) have\nalso shown that market boundaries severely restrict the range\nof identities that economic actors can presume. Such results\nhave been corroborated by a large number of researchers\nbeen proposed for such a downgrade: being a member of\nseveral categories means abiding by different social codes at\nthe same time (Hsu & Hannan, 2005) which may lead to\nclashes of category codes (Kovacs & Hannan, 2009); there is\nan inherent trade-off between niche width and the capacity\nfor performance (Hsu, 2006); organizations that do not abide\nby social codes lose legitimacy and hence appeal (King &\nWhetten, 2008); audience members find difficulty in evalu-\nating the offerings of such organizations (Leung & Sharkey,\n2009), or they simply do not view them favorably (Leung,\nnumber of the above factors might be involved.\nWhile the general findings of most of these articles are\naligned, several findings seem to suggest that the conse-\nquences of category spanning are context-dependent (Hsu\nbers of \"lenient\"5 categories were able to span boundaries\nmuch more easily than members of categories which were\nnot lenient. A similar result was obtained by Kovacs and\neffect of category spanning was contingent on the \"fuzzi-\nness\" of the category to which the organization belonged.\nKovacs and Hannan (2009) found that once the structure of\nthe space of categories is accounted for, quantitative results\nwould differ not only by magnitude but also by sign. Time\nhas also appeared to play an important role. Zuckerman,\nKim, Ukanwa, and von Rittmann (2003) found that film stars\nthat have many years of experience are able to straddle cat-\negories by acting in different genres, while less experienced\nactors were heavily penalized for the same action. On the\ncontrary, Ruef and Patterson (2009) found that in the original\nstages of classification systems, there were low risks of\ndevaluation because category heuristics were not well devel-\noped. With time, however, these heuristics developed into\nstrict codes that members had to abide by. Rao, Monin, and\nDurand (2005) highlighted the dynamic nature of categories\nwhen they noted that the strength of category boundary was\neroded as more and more producers crossed them. Recently,\nan interesting finding has suggested that in some cases, it\nmight not be the properties of the categories themselves that\ndetermine the effect of category spanning, but factors exog-\nenous to the categories. Pontikes (2010) found that different\ntypes of audiences react differently to category spanners\nwhile Phillips and Zuckerman (2001) found that it was the\nposition of the producer inside the category that decided\nwhether conforming was good or bad. Smith (2011), on the\ncontrary, has found that the identity of organizations deter-\nmines whether border-crossing activities are viewed posi-\ntively or negatively.\nWhile I believe that the category space needs to be\naccounted for, I believe that the formulation posited by\nKovacs and Hannan (2009) could be further improved. This\ncan be done in two ways. First, I believe that the entire struc-\nture of the category space needs to be taken into consider-\nation, not just the distance between two specific categories.\nSecond, I believe that the concept of distance needs to be\naccounted for not on the level of categories, but on the level\nof clusters that are formed from the dynamics of categories.\nProblems With the Distance-Based Measures\nOne issue with the distance-based measure is that the sum of\nthe grade of memberships of a certain producer does not\nnecessarily add up to one. Theoretically, this is not really a\nproblem because the grade of membership is not a probabi-\nlistic function, and therefore there is no requirement that the\nsum be equal to one (Hannan, 2010). However, by con-\nstraining the grades-of-membership to be equal to one, or at\nleast equal to each other, we would be in alignment what is\nreferred to as the principle of allocation. Hannan (2010, p.\n168) stated that \"the level of total category engagement is\nnormally the same for all producers in a market,\" while\nsum\" approach.\nAnother problem with the distance-based measure is that\nthe grade of membership function is affected neither by fea-\ntures of the product or producer nor by the producer's\nengagement in the category. Hannan et al. (2007) stated that\n\"a natural step in seeking to comprehend the bases of mem-\nbership in a label involves relating the feature values of the\nproducers/products to their grades of membership in a label\"\n(p. 60) and \" . . . the grade of membership in a position is the\n4 SAGE Open\nshare of (producer) x's engagement devoted to the audience\nat that position\" (p. 180). If the grade of membership func-\ntion reflects the appeal of an offering (Hannan et al., 2007),\nand engagement increases the appeal of the producer (Ko\u00e7ak,\nHannan, & Hsu, 2009), then surely engagement affects the\ngrade of membership of that producer (Hsu et al., 2009).\nMost research so far has used a binary function such that if a\nproducer spans a category then the function is set to one and\nif not then it is set to zero (Carroll, Feng, Le Mens, &\ngrade of membership should distinguish between the levels\nof commitment that the producer applies in each category.\nThe next issue with the distance-based niche width is\nmore important than all of the above. Previous studies have\nshown that in many industries there comes a time when gen-\neralists take over the market. This is usually manifested as an\nincrease in the market concentration ratio (Dobrev et al.,\nincrease in the number of generalists means that the propor-\ntion of times that categories are mentioned together will also\nincrease. This, in turn, will lead to a decrease in the distance\nbetween the categories as the distance measure is based on\nthe similarity measure, which is based on a frequentist\napproach. The decrease in the distance between the catego-\nries will lead to a decrease in the niche width of the generalist\norganization. So by increasing the number of generalists,\nthese generalists are no longer generalists because their niche\nwidth decreases.\nOne of the proposed reasons that spanning categories is\nhazardous to organizations is that audience members penal-\nize nonconformity. Imagine now that there exists a category\nspace in which two certain categories always co-occur\ntogether at a certain point in time. Now imagine that a new\norganization comes along and decides that it wants to span\njust one of these categories. This would cause a decrease in\nthe grade of membership of all exiting organizations, while\nthe new organization will have a zero niche width because it\nonly spans one category. Because a smaller niche width is\nmore favorable than a larger niche width, the original organi-\nzations end up being punished while the new organization is\nnot penalized for ignoring the second category, even though\nit is the new organization that has not conformed to the mar-\nket dynamics.\nThe final problem with the proposed distance-based mea-\nsure is that it only takes into account the actions of organiza-\ntions that span the two focal categories when it calculates the\ndistance between these categories. This might seem to be the\nlogical thing at first, but it is important here to take note of\nthe nature of categories. It is generally accepted that catego-\nries are socially constructed entities (Kennedy, 2005; Rosa,\nTherefore, the distance between categories is not an absolute\nmeasure that is independent of the surroundings. The dis-\ntance between two categories is relative due to their socially\nconstructed nature, so the context in which they exist must be\ntaken into account. Previously, researchers have posited that\nthe actions and resources of one population affect other pop-\nulations (Freeman & Hannan, 1983), that competition is\nsocially constructed (Porac, Thomas, Wilson, Paton, &\nKanfer, 1995) and that it is largely a function of relative posi-\ntions in the resource space (Baum & Haveman, 1997), and\nthat the creation of reality in organizations is an ongoing pro-\ncess (Weick, 1995). Therefore, if in a socially constructed\nworld (Berger & Luckmann, 1967), actions that take place in\none organizational population can affect organizations in\nanother population, it seems natural to argue that actions that\ntake place, within the same population, in one category have\nan effect on other categories. In addition, if organizational\nreality and competition are themselves socially constructed,\nthen significant shifts in the competition landscape (i.e.,\nnumber of competitors and their average niche width) should\naffect how audience members evaluate all competitors.\nDobrev et al. (2001) argued that \"an organization can experi-\nence a change in its relative position without making any\nchanges in its own product offerings\" (p. 1306).\nClusters: A Multilevel Approach\nHow do we incorporate the category structure in the study of\ncategories while overcoming the above issues? I believe that\nthe solution lies in dividing the analysis into two parts. The\ndistance-based measures proposed by Kovacs and Hannan\n(2009) incorporate the concept of distance at the category\nlevel, thus affecting the definition of grade of membership\nand niche width. My solution leaves the definition of niche\nwidth as proposed by Hsu et al. (2009) and incorporates the\ncategory space on a second level which I refer to as clusters.\nIt should be noted that clusters, as formulated in this arti-\ncle, are different from what Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson,\nand Boyes-Braem (1976) referred to as superordinate cate-\ngories. The delineation between subordinate, basic, and\nsuperordinate categories is a question of finding the \"natu-\nral\" level of categorization. Clusters, which are formed from\ncategory spanning activity, are on the contrary not natural.\nTheir formation is dependent on the category spanning\ndynamics of organizations, and therefore they are nonnatural\nobjects that are dynamically formed. This difference between\nsuperordinate categories and clusters is reflected in the fact\nthat the question of the level of categorization is related to\nthe taxonomy:\nA taxonomy is a system by which categories are related to\nanother by means of class inclusion . . . Each category within a\ntaxonomy is entirely included within one other category (unless\nit is the highest level category) but is not exhaustive of that more\nThe same cannot be said about clusters. A cluster does not\nnecessarily include all of a category and a certain category\ncan be included within more than one cluster. A cluster is not\njust another level in the taxonomy. It allows us to understand\nthe relationship between different categories in the category\nspace which arises due to the activities of organizations,\nhence the relationship between clusters and niche width as\ndiscussed above.\nI determine the grade of membership  of an issue in\neach category as the proportion of that issue that is dedi-\ncated to the category. The main advantage of this method is\nthat this measure takes into account the engagement of the\nproducer in each category. The greater the resources dedi-\ncated to a certain category, the higher the grade of member-\nship. We can also see that this method allows for the sum of\nthe grades-of-memberships to be equal to one for all news-\npapers. Now that we have a grade of membership in each\ncategory, we follow the lead of Hannan et al. (2007) and\nHsu et al. (2009) and define the niche width using Simpson's\nindex of dissimilarity as\n-\n=\n\ni\nI\n\u00b5 .\nThis measure takes values between zero and one, with a zero\nindicating that the organization spans a single category.\nNow that we have the grade of membership and the niche\nwidth of the issue, we need to determine to which cluster the\nissue belongs. To do this, I use the statistical method of clus-\nter analysis (Everitt, Landau, Leese, & Stahl, 2011). In the\ncluster analysis presented in this article, I used as a measure\nof proximity the Pearson correlation measure and used the\nweighted-average linkage as the linkage method. The reason\nfor these two choices is as follows: First, with regard to the\nproximity measure, Everitt et al. (2011) noted that the nature\nof the data should determine the choice of this measure. If\nthe variables measure the proportion of engagement that a\nproducer dedicates to a certain category, then they can take\nany value between 0 and 1. In such a case, it makes more\nsense to talk about the correlation between the data than to\ntalk about the distance. The variables provide an indication\nof the \"relative profile\" of the observation. The correlation\nbetween observations i and j is found using the following\nformula:\n =\n-\n( ) -\n( )\n-\n( ) -\n( )\n{ }\n=\n= =\n\n \nij\na\np\nia i ja j\na\np\nia i\nb\np\nja j\nx x x x\nx x x x\n/\n,\n,\nwhere x x p\ni ia\na\np\n=\n=\n\n/ and p is the number of variables\ntakes on values in the interval [-1,1], it is converted into a\ndistance measure which takes on values in the interval [0,1]\nusing the formula \nij ij\n= -\n( )\n/ . Unlike the Jaccard index\nmentioned previously, this measure takes into account the\nengagement of each producer in each category. With regard\nto the choice of the linkage method, the weighted-average\nmethod \"gives equal weights to each cluster regardless of\nhow many observations it contains. Such methods conse-\nquently tend to work better for detecting clusters of unequal\nThe above formulation has several desirable properties\nthat overcome the limitations of including a distance-based\nmeasure on the category level. First, the grade of member-\nship is dependent on the producers'engagement, and the area\nunder the fitness curve is constant and equal for all produc-\ners. Second, the proximity measure utilized also depends on\nthe proportion of resources dedicated to categories. It is not\nenough to state that a certain organization spans a certain\ncategory in order to calculate its distance from other catego-\nries. Third, the determination of the best-fit number of clus-\nters depends on all the information present, not just on\ninformation pertaining to certain categories. Changes in cat-\negories and organizations that take place outside the focal\ncategories affect the best-fit number of clusters, and hence\naffect the assignments of all producer to the clusters. The\ndetermination of the best-fit number of clusters takes into\naccount the differences between the category dynamics as\nwell as the similarities (Everitt et al., 2011); thus, all the\ninformation is utilized to determine the number of clusters.\nFourth, we no longer have the problem that a rise in general-\nists would lead to a decrease in the niche width of the gener-\nalists because we have uncoupled the concept of niche width\nfrom the concept of distance.\nRevisiting Category Spanning: Formulation of\nHypotheses\nIf spanning more categories leads to a decrease in the engage-\nment that the producer dedicates to each category, why do\nproducers seek to span more and more categories? Past\nresearch has shown that after a population has become legiti-\nmated, more and more pressure is placed on producers in\norder to distinguish their offerings from those of their com-\npetitors (Navis & Glynn, 2010). The result is that producers\nexpand to new categories. In the case where the market is\nsusceptible to economies of scale, this pattern is further\nenhanced because in addition to distinguishing their offers,\ncategory spanning will also drive down costs because the\nmore categories a producer spans, the larger the number of\naudience members it attracts. This pattern will eventually\nlead to the rise of generalists, and the market will become\ndominated by organizations that span as many categories as\npossible. In the words of Carroll (1985), \"in newspaper pub-\nlishing, the dominance of generalists in the market represents\nthe equilibrium state of a long, competitive process dictated\nby economies of scale\" (p. 1268). Therefore, we would\nexpect to see that organizations expand their offerings by\nentering new categories during the period of the \"rise of the\n6 SAGE Open\ngeneralists.\" This rise of the generalists will take place after\nthe industry has successfully formed, because it is after the\nprocess of legitimation that organizations find themselves\nunder more and more pressure to distinguish their offerings\nAccording to the resource partitioning theory, this increase\nin the number of generalist organizations will lead to a highly\ncompetitive landscape in which only a few generalists can\nexist. By expanding their offerings in order to benefit from\neconomies of scale and in order to attract as many audience\nmembers as possible, these organizations will find them-\nselves competing with other large organizations in the same\nresource space. The abandoned edges of the resource space\nwill attract new organizations that tailor their offerings in\nsuch a way that fills a small portion of the resource space. By\ndoing so, these new specialist organizations will avoid com-\npetition with the large and established generalists, while they\nwould manage to service audience members who are cur-\nrently being neglected by the generalists. According to\nCarroll (1984), \"Hawley's model predicts that the losing\ncompetitors are transformed; the resource partitioning model\npredicts that those units die and that the differentiated units\nspecialists organizations are mostly made up of new organi-\nzations that seek to occupy a narrow niche that they have\nnoticed is not being properly served.\nBased on the above discussion, I do not believe that we\ncan say \"category spanning is hazardous.\" Category span-\nning helps organizations distinguish themselves and helps\nthem benefit from economies of scale. The effect of environ-\nments on organizations has long been a topic of interest and\nhas received much attention from organizational theorists\nenous environmental factors can cause a shift in the effect of\nthe niche width of organizations (Swaminathan, 1998).\nResource partitioning theory describes how endogenous\nchanges can cause a significant shift in the effect of the niche\nwidth. Hannan and Freeman (1984) have argued that certain\nenvironments clearly favor generalist organizations. Many\nfactors can help favor one form over the other, such as econ-\nomies of scale (Dobrev et al., 2002) and network embedded-\nness (Echols & Tsai, 2005). More importantly, the timing in\nthe industry evolution has proved to be critical in determin-\ning the effect of niche width (Dobrev et al., 2001). Research\nhas shown that with time, the effect of niche width on orga-\nnizational mortality and on the founding rates of different\norganizational forms is reversed. Swaminathan (1998) has\nshown how founding rates of specialist organizations\nincrease as the concentration of the industry increases, while\nmarket concentration increases the effects of niche width on\nthe hazard rate changes from negative to positive. Therefore,\nI believe that the effect of category spanning, which deter-\nmines the niche width, is not uniform throughout the lifetime\nof the industry. I believe that, as the resource partitioning\ntheory predicts, at certain stages in the industry lifetime, the\nenvironment would favor generalists who are trying to dis-\ntinguish themselves, or who are benefiting from economies\nof scale. During these periods, I do not believe that spanning\ncategories will be hazardous to organizations.\nHypothesis 1: The effect of category spanning is time\ndependent.\nHowever, once the industry has matured, the severe com-\npetition between generalists in the middle of the resource\nspace will make it increasingly harder for generalists to sur-\nvive. It is during this period that specialist organizations start\nforming. By not spanning many categories, these specialists\nwill avoid direct competition with the generalists. If, how-\never, an organization enters as a generalist, then it will be\nfaced with severe competition from incumbent generalists,\nand therefore suffer from a high mortality rate. In addition,\nthe intense competition for the center of the resource space\nwill result in the death of some generalists because only a\nlimited number of generalists can survive in the market\nHypothesis 2: Category spanning increases the hazard of\nmortality or organizations once the industry matures and\nspecialists start to emerge.\nAs explained above, cluster formation depends on the cat-\negory dynamics in all the resource space, and not just\nbetween two focal categories or producers. It is important to\nnote here that cluster spanning and category spanning are\ntwo separate things that can, in some instances, involve the\nsame act. It is possible for an organization to expand its con-\ntents by spanning a new category. The result may be that this\norganization ends up in a new cluster. However, this is not\nalways the case. It is also possible for an organization to span\na new cluster by decreasing the number of categories\nspanned. Finally, it is possible for an organization to span a\nnew cluster even if the number of categories that it spans\nremains the same. Specialist organizations have considerable\nfreedom in their choice of \"location\" (Dobrev et al., 2002;\nI propose that audience members are confused when pro-\nducers span clusters. I believe that the act of moving from\ncluster to cluster is hazardous to the organization's health\nbecause audience members will have difficulty in determin-\ning to which group the organization belongs. When a pro-\nducer moves to a new cluster, then it will occupy a new\nposition in this category space. This movement is determined\nby many factors, not just by whether the producer spanned\nmore categories or not. Because the number of clusters is\ndetermined by using data from all producers, it might be the\ncase that a producer ends up in a different cluster simply\nbecause the majority of organizations changed their category\nspanning dynamics. In such a case, the entire category space\nshifts and, even though the focal producer did not change its\ncategory spanning dynamics, it ends up in a new position.\nBecause audience members view the position of the producer\nin relation to the position of all other producers, the end\nresult will be that the producer's position has changed.\nAnother reason that is given to explain the hazardous effect\nof category spanning is that the organization that attempts to\nspan a new category is not conforming to the \"rules of the\ngame.\" An organization that crosses boundaries must be\npenalized, especially in a market in which boundaries are\nclearly delineated. However, it might be the case that the\nnorm in the industry is to span many categories. Many stud-\nies have talked about a certain industry being crowded by\ngeneralist organizations. In such cases, it is the specialist\norganization that does not conform to the norms. Therefore,\nit is the organization that does not span categories that must\nbe penalized for being the nonconformist. Here again, clus-\nters help capture these dynamics. Finally, the work of Kovacs\nand Hannan (2009) explained that spanning distant catego-\nries is hazardous. While I follow their lead in taking into\naccount the resource space, I do not mix the concepts of\nniche width and category distance together. Because distance\nis determined by the correlation between observations in this\narticle, and the best-fit number of clusters is determined by\nthe correlation that all observations have with all other obser-\nvations, two different clusters represent two different sets of\ncorrelations, and therefore the distance between a producer\nin one set and another producer in another set is greater than\nthe distance between two producers in the same set. This\nmeans that spanning clusters also captures the concept of dis-\ntance. Instead of saying, \"spanning distant categories is haz-\nardous,\" my model says, \"changing your category dynamics\nrelative to the dynamics of other producers in such a way that\nwarrants a shift from cluster to cluster is hazardous.\" This is\nsimilar to the argument made by Ruef and Patterson (2009),\nwho stated that rare combinations of components would\nincrease the hazard faced by organizations. Here, the word\n\"rare\" indicates a relative concept. In my model, spanning a\ncombination of categories that is \"rare\" might lead the focal\norganization to end up in a completely new cluster.\nHypothesis 3: Organizations that span clusters will have\na greater hazard of failure than those that do not span clus-\nters. This negative effect is not time dependent.\nThis article has described how category spanning is dif-\nferent than cluster spanning. I have argued that the effect of\ncategory spanning is time dependent, while the effect of clus-\nter spanning is uniform because it is confusing to audience\nmembers and because it might signal nonconformity. To test\nthe above hypothesis, the models will control for both\ndynamics at the same time. As previously stated, not all clus-\nter spanning is a result of category spanning, and not all cat-\negory spanning results in cluster spanning. This explains\nwhy previous research has found that category spanning is\nnot always hazardous.\nEmpirical Setting and Data Collection\nThe theories developed in this article will be tested within\nthe context of the Lebanese newspaper industry. The news-\npaper industry has generally been a popular empirical setting\nin the past. It has been used in studies of organizational\nfounding (Delacroix & Carroll, 1983), organizational mor-\ntality (Carroll & Delacroix, 1982), resource distributions\nmanagement change (Carroll, 1984), interorganizational\nlinkages (Miner, Amburgey, & Stearns, 1990), and organiza-\ntional change (Amburgey, Kelly, & Barnett, 1993). The\nchoice of industry was motivated by two reasons. First, there\nhas been no study concerned with the organizational ecology\nmodel that has been tested within any Arab industry. Second,\nnewspapers are well suited to the study of categories due to\nthe nature of the product. Throughout the years, the number\nof newspapers published in Lebanon has been disproportion-\nally large when compared with those published in other\nArabic countries.\nIn the first stage of data collection, I collected the life his-\nTaleb (2011) to fill in some missing information. Finally, I\nconducted several interviews with industry historian Joseph\nIlliyas in order to fill in some missing information. By the\nend of this stage, I was able to collect information about the\nstarting date, ending date, format (newspaper/magazine),\nand frequency of publication. A publication was considered a\nmagazine if there was a table of contents at the beginning of\nthe issue or if the page numbering was continuous, that is, if\nthe first page in a magazine started off where the last page of\nthe previous issue stopped. I was also able to record dates of\nwhen the ownership changed hands or when the journal\nchanged its format.\nBy the end of this stage, I had collected the following\ninformation: There are a total of 1,759 newspapers, with\nAround 81% of the publications in Lebanon were published\nin Beirut, while around 35% of publications outside Lebanon\nwere published in Egypt. With regard to the publications in\nLebanon, there are 59 cases of missing founding dates and\ncases, there are 164 cases of censoring before the end of the\nstudy. This means that while I did not find the ending dates\nof these publications, I managed to secure dates at which I\nknew that they were still in circulation. Finally, there are 119\ncases of censoring due to the study ending at the end of 1974.\nThe next step was to identify the categories. The justifica-\ntion for the choice of categories is a question which must be\n8 SAGE Open\naddressed. In the case of this article, the justification is of a\nmore practical nature than it is theoretical. While going\nthrough the newspapers, I noted the nature of the news sto-\nries and started classifying them. Items which were of a\npolitical nature or an economic nature were well expected in\nadvance, but some other items came as a surprise. For exam-\nple, I was surprised to see that many newspapers dedicated a\nsignificant portion of their space to literary issues that related\nto the Arabic language. This led me to decide to create a sep-\narate category for such items because their frequency meant\nthat it would not be wise to disregard them by adding them to\nanother more general category. During the process of going\nthrough the newspapers, I was able to identify nine different\ncategories. The categories are Politics, Economics, Social\nIssues (education, immigration, etc.), Knowledge (math,\nphysics, etc.), Literature (Arabic grammar, poetry, novels,\netc.), Sport, Art, Advertisements, and Other (any item that\ncould not be classified into any of the above groups was\nadded to this group). The final data set consisted of 2,478\nentries that belonged to 293 different newspapers.\nData Analysis\nThe first step in the analysis is to study how the newspaper\nissues spanned the different categories over the duration of\nthe study period. To do that, I use Simpson's index. I calcu-\nlated this index for every single newspaper issue in the data\nset. I then grouped the issues according to their year of pub-\nlication and calculated the average of the index and its stan-\ndard deviation for every year. The results are presented in\nFigure 2. The vertical lines in the graph have been inserted at\nthe points in which the graph shows that there was some\nchange in the dynamics. Prior to 1875 (the first vertical line),\nthe graph clearly shows that both the average and the stan-\ndard deviation of Simpson's index were shifting with no\nclear pattern. This is partly due to the fact that before 1865\nthere was a maximum of two issues per year. After 1875, we\nsee a completely different dynamic in that the average of\nSimpson's index kept increasing while the standard devia-\ntion was decreasing. The only explanation to this dynamic is\nthat most of the newspapers were broadening their coverage.\nIn other words, this period witnessed the rise of generalists.\nThe fact that the standard deviation kept decreasing tells us\nthat most of the newspapers followed this strategy. However,\nthis dynamic was reversed after 1894 (the second line) where\nwe can see that the average of Simpson's index started\ndecreasing while the standard deviation increased. A plausi-\nble explanation to this is that some newspapers were becom-\ning more specialized, concentrating on one, or at least on a\nfew, categories. However, this was not a universal strategy as\nillustrated by the standard deviation. Therefore, we would\nexpect that this period saw the rise of some specialists with\nsome newspapers remaining generalists. The third and fourth\nlines in the graph show the start and end of the First World\nWar. We can see that the category spanning becomes more\nerratic during this period and represents a discontinuity in the\ngeneral dynamics of Simpson's index. The same can be seen\nduring the Second World War (between the fifth and sixth\nlines). In between the two world wars, we see that neither the\naverage of Simpson's index nor the standard deviation\nexhibit any changes. The seventh (and last) line represents\nthe point when the average of Simpson's index starts decreas-\ning while the standard deviation starts increasing. The\ndynamic during this period is similar to the one described\nabove between 1894 and the start of the First World War in\n1914. However, we can see that the slopes of the lines\nbecome more consistent and have less variation in the very\nlast period. Again, the only explanation with regard to the\nlast period is that some newspapers were more specialized\nwhile generalists continued to exist. This explanation is con-\nsistent with resource partitioning theory of Carroll (1985).\nSurvival Analysis\nI next performed survival analysis on the entire period from\nmary function of interest is the hazard function, which is the\ninstantaneous rate of failure. It represents the probability that\nthe event of interest occurs conditional on the subject having\nsurvived up to the present time:\nh t\nt t T T t\nt\nt\n( ) =\n+ > >\n\n \nlim\n( )\n.\nPr\nT denotes the nonnegative time to event while t denotes\ntime.\nI used the proportional hazards Cox model. The results of\nthe models are presented in Table 1. The models were suc-\ncessfully tested for the proportional hazards assumption. It\nshould be noted here that all standard errors reported are\nrobust because I used the cluster option because my data\nallow for multiple deaths for each newspaper. The first model\nin the table is the base model, and it includes several control\nvariables. The first four variables are period control vari-\nables. The first variable indicates the start of the reign of\nSultan `abd al-Hamid up to the constitution of 1908. The\nnext two variables were period indicators for the two world\nwars. The fourth variable indicates the period after the imple-\nmentation of the 1953 law which restricted the number of\nnew licenses. The only statistically significant period indica-\ntor was the World War I variable. Figure 1 shows how the\nnewspaper industry was almost wiped out during that period.\nNext, I added to the model some industry-specific variables.\nThe first two are the total number of active newspapers and\nits square. Past research in organizational ecology has uncov-\nered a U-shaped relationship between mortality and organi-\nzational density (Carroll & Hannan, 2004). However, our\nresults indicate that there is a very narrow inverted-U shape,\ncontrary to almost universal findings in previous research,\nbut only the main term is significant. I also controlled for the\nTable 1.

Numbers for the total popula-\ntion are severely lacking because the last census performed\nby the government was in 1932 and, due to religious and\npolitical grievances, the results of that consensus are highly\nquestionable (Hudson, 1985). I collected the available data\nused linear interpolation to fill in the missing values.\nAlthough the coefficient is statistically significant, its value\nis extremely small. The last two variables I controlled for are\nthe 1-year lagged number of founding and disbanding events.\nSome periods saw an increase in the founding events, for\nexample, after the 1908 constitution, and I wanted to see\nwhether an increase in founding events led to an increase in\nmortality due to increased competition. With regard to dis-\nbanding events, I wanted to see whether newspaper disband-\ning events tended to happen at the same time, that is, that an\nincrease in disbanding events in 1 year was following with\nmore disbanding events in the next. The results show that\nboth coefficients are significant. It seems that a high number\nof disbanding events in 1 year predicted higher mortality\nrates for those that survive in the next, while a high number\nof founding events predicted a lower mortality rate in the fol-\nlowing year.\nNext, in Model 1, I included some organization-level\ncontrol variables. I added a variable which indicated whether\na publication dealt with politics or not, the number of pages,\nand the type of publication. Here it should be noted that\nother than newspapers and magazines, some journals where\nreferred to as \"matboo'a\" (publication) in the sources. There\nwere only 27 cases such as this. The model results show that\nthese \"publications\" had a statistically significant higher\nhazard rate when compared with magazines but that\nthe difference between magazines and newspapers was not\nsignificant. We see that after we added these organization-\nlevel variables, the number of active newspapers, and the\nlagged founding events are no longer significant. We can\nclearly see that Model 1 is a much better fit than the base\nmodel. I next added indicator variables that indicated in\nwhich period the newspaper was founded (results are not\nshown in the table) but none of them was significant and the\nresulting Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian\ninformation criterion (BIC) statistics were higher.\nIn Model 2, I added indicator variables to indicate the\nperiod in which the issue was published. There are six period\nindicators here, with Period 0 referring to the years 1851 to\n1874 and Period 1 to Period 5 referring to each of the other\nperiods as identified in Figure 2. I used the fifth period\nbeing published in any other period was more hazardous than\nbeing published in the fifth period. All coefficients, except\nthe Period 4 coefficient, are statistically significant. It is also\ninteresting to see that the magnitude of the coefficients\ndecreases with each consecutive period.\nNext, in Model 3, I added the variable span. It records\nwhen a newspaper enters a new category. The reason for\nincluding this variable is that I wanted to see whether enter-\ning new categories was statistically significant or not. It is\nimportant to note that this variable does not capture the num-\nber of categories spanned. It only captures whether the news-\npaper enters a category that it had previously not included.\nThe result indicates that spanning new categories increases\nthe mortality rate, but the result is not statistically significant.\nNext, I wanted to see whether the variable span was period\ndependent.6 It was mentioned above that Period 1 seems to\nFigure 2. Dynamics of the category Simpson's index over time.\nhave witnessed a rise in generalists, while the rise in special-\nists occurred in Period 5. Perhaps spanning a new category is\nhazardous in the fifth period but not so in the first period. The\nresult shows that spanning is hazardous in both periods. In\nfact, it is more hazardous in the first period than in the fifth\nperiod, but the result is not significant. These results indicate\nthat entering a new category, without taking into account\nwhether the number of categories spanned by the newspaper\ndecreases, stays the same, or increases, is not significant.\nNext, I decided to see whether increasing the number of cat-\negories spanned increases mortality. To do so, I created a\nvariable that I named catnum. This variable is set to one\nwhen the number of categories spanned by a certain issue is\nmore than the number of categories spanned by the previous\nissue. Otherwise it is set to zero. The result of adding this\nvariable is shown under Model 5 in Table 1. We see that the\ncoefficient is positive but that, once again, it is not statisti-\ncally significant. Next, I decided to see whether the variable\ncatnum interacted with any certain periods. More specifi-\ncally, I once again included the interaction of this variable\nwith the period indicators for Period 1 and Period 5. Perhaps\nspanning a greater number of categories was not hazardous\nin Period 1 but was hazardous in Period 5. Model 6 shows\nthat the coefficient of the variable has now become negative\nwhile both interactions are positive. However, only the inter-\naction with Period 5 is significant. These results indicate that\nspanning more categories is not always hazardous to the\nhealth of the organization, thus supporting Hypothesis 1.\nStatistically speaking, the model shows that spanning more\ncategories is only hazardous in the fifth period, which is the\nperiod of specialization. With regard to which model is a bet-\nter fit, Model 5 or Model 6, the AIC and BIC statistic give\ncontradicting results with the AIC favoring Model 6 while\nthe BIC favoring Model 5.\nI have argued in this article that cluster spanning, more\nthan category spanning, is what is most hazardous to organi-\nzational health. So far the results indicate that spanning more\ncategories increases mortality only in the fifth period. But\nwhat about cluster spanning? To see the effect of cluster span-\nning on mortality rate, I created a new variable that records\nwhether an issue spans a different cluster than the previous\nissue. To do that, I first had to determine the best-fit number\nof clusters in each period. Milligan and Cooper (1985) exam-\nined 30 rules with the conclusion that while there was no\nsingle best rule for all situations, two seemed to work most of\nthe time. These are the Caliski and Harabasz (1974) pseudo-\nF index and the Duda-Hart index (Duda & Hart, 1973). I used\nboth rules to determine the optimal number of clusters for my\ndata set. The results are presented in Table 2.\nNext, I assigned each issue in each period to one of the\ngroups. An issue spanned a new cluster when it was not in the\nsame cluster as the previous issue. So for example, if an issue\nof a newspaper was in the second cluster while the next issue\nwas in the first cluster, I set the cluster spanning variable to 1.\nIf they were in the same cluster then the variable was set to 0.\nModel 7 shows the result of including this variable in addition\nto the variables of Model 6. The results indicate that catnum\nis negative and not significant, but that its interactions with\nboth the Period 1 and Period 5 indicators are positive. This\nmeans that spanning more categories increased mortality\nrates in both Periods 1 and 5. The fact that spanning catego-\nries increases the hazard of mortality in Period 5 lends\nsupport to Hypothesis 2. What is even more important for us\nis that the coefficient of the binary variable which records\ncluster spanning is both positive and statistically significant\nindicating that spanning clusters increases mortality rates,\nthus supporting Hypothesis 3. The AIC and BIC statistics\nclearly favor Model 7 above all other models. It is important\nto note here that a newspaper can span a different cluster\nwithout increasing the number of categories that it spans.\nWhat Model 7 tells us is that in such a case when catnum is\nzero, cluster spanning is hazardous to the organization's mor-\ntality. In addition, if an issue increases the number of catego-\nries that it spans in Period 1 or Period 5 and, by spanning\nmore categories, is placed in a cluster different from the pre-\nvious issue, then there are two positive coefficients that will\ncause an increase in the mortality rate. In other words, cate-\ngory spanning captures only one hazardous dynamic while\ncluster spanning captures another. Finally, to see whether the\neffect of spanning clusters was period dependent, as was the\ncase with category spanning, I interacted the spanning vari-\nable with the different time periods (results not shown in the\ntable). All of the interactions proved to be statistically insig-\nnificant, and the resulting model was a worse fit than Model\n7. This is in line with the statement in Hypothesis 3, and that\nis that cluster spanning appears to be period independent.\nCategories or Features?\nHannan et al. (2007) defined \"a type as a coupling of a label\nand a schemata that articulates a view about what pattern of\nfeature values determine the applicability of the label\" (p. 60).\nLater they stated, \"We can now define a category as a type for\nwhich an audience segment achieves a high level of exten-\nsional and intensional consensus\" (Hannan et al., 2007, p. 69).\nWhat if the \"categories\" that were identified by this article\nwere nothing more than features? This would imply that the\n\"clusters\" which were formed were actually categories, and\nthus the findings of this article would be exactly in line with\npresent research on the effects of categories.\nTable 2. Best-Fit Number of Clusters.\nPeriod Caliski and Harabasz Duda-Hart\nI wrote a program that displayed the amount of space ded-\nthis study. This is the period that saw the rise of specialists.\nSpecialists tend to span few categories, but they do not nec-\nessarily have few features. Therefore, if my identification of\ncategories were correct, I would expect to see many of the\nclusters formed during this last period to be populated by\nnewspapers that concentrate their content on a certain cate-\ngory. According to the Caliski and Harabasz measures,\neight clusters is a very good fit, but not better than six, while\naccording to the Duda-Hart index six clusters is not a good\nfit. Therefore, I chose to divide the data into eight clusters\nbecause both measures agree that it fits the data well. I then\ncalculated the average proportion dedicated to each category\nin each cluster. The results are presented in Table 3. In this\narticle, I have used the value 0.11 as the cutoff value to deter-\nmine whether a newspaper issue spanned a category or not.\nWe can see that, except for the category \"sports,\" every sin-\ngle category was spanned by at least one cluster. We can also\nsee that there was always a single cluster which dedicated\nmore than half of its content to that category. These results\nshow that most of the clusters tended to dedicate the vast\nmajority of their contents to a single category. They also\nshow that each category was the center of attention of exactly\none cluster. Next, I display the correlation matrix during that\nperiod for all categories. If these categories were in fact fea-\ntures, then we would expect to see a high correlation between\nsome of them, if in fact organizations do form categories by\ncombining features. In the words of Rosch et al. (1976),\n\"Subordinate categories have lower total cue validity than do\nbasic because they also share most attributes with contrast-\ning subordinate categories\" (p. 385). The correlation matrix\nis displayed in Table 4. The highest positive correlation is\n0.2517, which is very weak. Again, this result shows that the\ncategories that I identified are not features. Another impor-\ntant thing to notice in the correlation matrix is that out of the\n36 correlations, 27 are negative while only 9 are positive.\nAgain this vindicates my choice of categories because it\nCluster Politics Economic Social issues Literature Advertisements Knowledge Art Sports Other\nNote. The numbers in bold are the largest numbers in the column with the condition that they be greater than .11.\nFigure 3. The graph of the hazard linear predictor.\nshows that if one category is spanned then other categories\ntend not to be spanned.\nImplications for Future Research\nThe cluster spanning theory that is developed in this article\ncan be tested within the context of populations other than\nthat of the Lebanese newspaper industry. By studying clus-\nters, we would not only be studying the effects of category\nspanning, but we will also be studying how organizations\ngroup together during different periods throughout the life-\ntime of the industry. I believe that cluster analysis is a very\npromising direction which organizational ecologists should\ndirect their attention to. Researchers in the field have\nalways had their differences with regard to how to identify\nforms. This has led to huge efforts that were mostly directed\nat the study of a single organizational population. In a world\nin which boundaries between organizational populations\nare quickly eroding due to the rise of huge corporations, it\nwould be useful if organizational ecologists were able to\ntake into account more than one population at a time.\nBecause cluster analysis is a multilevel approach, I believe\nthat it allows researchers to do exactly that. While this arti-\ncle studied how clusters formed from category dynamics,\nthere is no reason why the same approach cannot be used to\nstudy other levels. For example, the researcher can replace\ncategories with industries. This would allow him or her to\nstudy how clusters form from the activity of organizations\nin different industries. Organizational ecologists need no\nlonger concentrate their efforts on single industries. On the\ncontrary, the researcher might choose to move downward\ninstead of upward, in that instead of moving from catego-\nries to industries, he or she can move from categories to\nfeatures. Categories are formed from the combination of\nfeatures. A valid research agenda is to study whether the\ncombination of features changes over time and how do cat-\negories emerge from these combination. Again, this can be\ndone using the cluster analysis approach utilized in this\narticle due to the fact that this approach allows for two sep-\narate but related levels. The researcher need not collect data\nthat are continuous because various binary measures exist\nin the cluster analysis literature. Therefore, the nature of the\ndata collected might differ from that used in this article.\nThe methods used in this article can be applied to other set-\ntings with different sets of data, thus enabling researchers\nto test the theories in a large, and diverse, number of\nsettings.\nConclusion\nThe resource partitioning theory argued that the hazards faced\nby generalists and specialists are not uniform and that they\nwere time dependent. I tested this same idea but instead of\nrelying on count models that studied the number of general-\nists and specialists, and instead of classifying organizations as\ngeneralists or specialists, I relied on the Simpson's index to\ndo the work for me. Next, I argued that if it were the case that\ncategory spanning is an aspect of the resource partitioning\ntheory, then we would expect that the effect of category span-\nning was in fact not uniform throughout the life period of the\nindustry. The survival models show that category spanning is\nperiod dependent. From there, I argued that instead of think-\ning of category spanning we should be studying what I\nreferred to as \"cluster spanning.\" Clusters are formed from\nthe dynamics of category spanning. I argued that the act of\nspanning clusters is hazardous to organizations no matter in\nwhich time period they were active. Some category spanning\nactivities lead to cluster spanning activities, but there exists\nsome category spanning activities that do not necessarily\nresult in spanning a new cluster. Even more interesting is the\nfact that it is possible to span a cluster even when there is no\ncategory spanning activity. It should be noted, however, that\neven when we take into account cluster spanning in the above\nmodels, the effects of category spanning are still hazardous in\ncertain periods. Ultimately, in some time periods, the highest\nhazard is faced by organizations that span both categories and\ncluster at the same time.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nPolitics Economic Social issues Literature Advertisements Knowledge Art Sports Other\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1. In the management literature, companies that have a narrow\nniche width offer a narrow range of products, while companies\nthat have a wide niche width offer a wider variety of products.\n2. \"In the simplest case, audience members recognize similarities\namong a cluster of producers and come to regard these similar\nentities as members, to varying degrees, of a common (fuzzy) set\nand agree on a label for the set\" (Hsu, Hannan, & Pol\u00f3s, 2010).\n3.

In the category space, similar categories are arrayed close\nto one another and dissimilar ones stand at large distances\n5. Lenient categories have lenient labels attached to them. The\nexpectations associated with lenient labels are not clear.\n6. An important issue here is the following: When do we consider\nthat a newspaper has spanned a category? In the data set, there\nare instances in which one newspaper issue does not dedicate\nany space to literature, but in the next issue the same news-\npaper dedicates just 5% to it. Should this be considered as a\ncase of spanning? Probably not. So what is the lower limit that\nshould be accepted? Because there are nine categories in total,\nI took 0.11 (1/9) as the accepted limit. Randomly speaking,\nan issue would dedicate 0.11 of its space to every single cat-\negory. Therefore, when a newspaper dedicates more than that\namount to a category (which would cause the space dedicated\nto another category decrease to below this limit), I considered\nthat it spanned that category.\nReferences\nAldrich, H.
