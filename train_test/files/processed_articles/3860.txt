One means to measure\nthis inequality is in the form of segregation. Research indicates that in many Hispanic communities, their levels of segregation\nfrom the White non-Hispanic population are similar to that of African Americans. Although a multitude of previous studies\nhave looked at the impact of segregation among African Americans, the literature remains under-represented in terms of\nmulti-city macro-level analyses among Hispanics. This current study extends the analysis of segregation's effects on lethal\nviolence to this population. To this end, two measures of segregation were used, the index of dissimilarity and exposure.\nUsing data from the census and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) mortality files, negative binominal regression models\nwere created using a sample of 236 U.S. cities. The results indicated that both measures of segregation show a strong positive\ninfluence on rates of Hispanic homicides.\n",

During this period of time homicides have\nthis trend is promising, the decline has not been consistent\namong all racial/ethnic groups. Even though Hispanic crime\nhas declined in a similar fashion to other minority groups\n(e.g., African Americans), the rate of homicide for Hispanics\nAmericans, is still 3 times higher than the White population\n(Logan, Smith, & Stevens, 2011; Martinez & Valenzuela,\n2006). Much like the African American community, this\ntrend of victimization seems to be partially linked to the dis-\norganized communities of large urban areas.\nResearchers such as Hawkins (1999) assert that there has\nbeen insufficient progress made when attempting to under-\nstand the impact of race, ethnicity, and social class in homi-\ncide offenses and victimization. Although growing, the\nextent of research on the subject of macro-structural factors\non Hispanic homicide is still dwarfed by the research on\nother racial/ethnic groups, such as African Americans\nan examination of the unique social/structural characteristics\nthat influence violent acts among Hispanics practically\nuntouched (Martinez & Lee, 1999a). There are two reasons\ncommonly cited for this underrepresentation in the literature.\nFirst, the study of Hispanics is hampered by the limited\namount of official data. Sources such as the Uniform Crime\nReport (UCR) fail to accurately report data for the Hispanic\npopulation (Martinez & Lee, 1999a). Second, apart from\nthose of Mexican ethnicity, prior to the 1970s the Hispanic\npopulation was not recognized as an ethnic group in the\nUnited States. Until this point, much of the official data on\nvictimization, employment, and so on failed to capture them\n(Bean & Tienda, 1987). Currently the recording of Hispanic\nethnicity in the UCR is voluntary on the part of the policing\nagent, resulting in an uneven measure of Hispanic crime and\nvictimization, particularly in cities where the Hispanic popu-\nlation is minimal. Another data limitation comes from vic-\ntims studies, which to accurately identify the ethnicity of the\n1Southeastern Louisiana University, Hammond, LA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMichael G.

Bisciglia1\n Keywords\nHispanic, Latino, homicide, segregation, lethal violence\n2 SAGE Open\noffender requires the presence of the victim as well as an\naccurate recollection of the offender.\nGiven the limitations that exist with the study of Hispanics,\nresearchers have postulated a variety of explanations to\naccount for the overrepresentation of minority victimization,\none being residential segregation. Massey and Denton (1993)\nhave asserted that segregation has become a common feature\nof the modern urban community, with its result being that\nminority group members, through reduced contact with\nWhites, are alienated from social, political, and economic\nopportunities. In effect by segregating minorities from main-\nstream life, minorities have fallen victim to a number of\nnegative outcomes, specifically violent crime (Feldmeyer,\nIt is generally agreed on that the impact of segregation is not\nuniformly felt across all racial/ethnic groups. For example,\nwhile the decreased contact of Hispanics to Whites may\nincrease several negative outcomes, among them victimiza-\ntion, it is likely that few if any negative results are felt among\nmembers of the majority group (Shihadeh & Bisciglia, 2008;\nWith these factors in mind, there is an opportunity present\nto expand on the literature in reference to these macro-social\nrelationships. Given that segregation between minority and\nmajority groups can take a number of different forms, this\nanalysis seeks to make two contributions. First this study\nseeks to bolster the number of multi-city macro-level analy-\nses of Hispanics. Second, this analysis will make use of two\nseparate measures of segregation (the Index of Dissimilarity\nand the Exposure Index) in an effort to determine which of\nthese measures serves as a stronger predictor of Hispanic\nhomicide.\nBackground\nAlthough the American racial majority has generally sup-\nported the concept of racial integration in principle, as Farley\nand Frey (1994) reported, in practice little movement has been\nmade in terms of this majority population accepting minorities\ninto their neighborhoods. The result of this has been that\nminority groups such as Hispanics still face high levels of resi-\ndential segregation, in many cities similar to that of African\nAmericans (Massey & Denton, 1993). This feature of the\nmodern urban environment has become institutionalized\nthrough real estate and banking practices. Initiatives on the\npart of the government have limited mobility for many indi-\nviduals within the Hispanic community (Massey & Denton,\n1993). This is further complicated by the fact that among the\nvarious Hispanic ethnic groups there is also variation in terms\nof race as well. As Massey and Denton (1993) pointed out,\neven among Hispanics, those of African American descent\nexperience levels of segregation much higher than those of\nmixed race or of a White racial background.\nExamination of the literature concerning the negative\neffects of segregation has consistently shown a positive cor-\nrelation between this and violent crime in non-racially disag-\ngregated crime (Hannon & DeFina, 2005; Messner & South,\nstudies have examined racially disaggregated crime that has\nshown that the violent crime-segregation link is more precari-\nous for the minority rather than the majority group (Shihadeh\nconcentration of minorities in the interior of larger cities has\nalso been shown to be an important element when predicting\nAlthough greater than in the past there are still fewer\nmacro-social analyses focusing on Hispanics. Nonetheless a\ncomparison between Hispanics and African Americans does\npoint to some similarities between these two minority groups.\nFor example, African Americans and Hispanics experience\nhigh levels of poverty concentration (DeNavas-Walt,\nHispanics have traditionally migrated to similar urban areas,\nas African Americans, often taking up residency in formally\nAfrican American neighborhoods, thereby placing Hispanics\nin a similar structural environment (Cancino, Martinez, &\nAlthough structural similarities do exist between these\ngroups, among the Hispanic population there are often addi-\ntional challenges, such as the taking in of new immigrants\nthat theAfricanAmerican community does not face (Sandefur\ntion of Hispanics and violent crime victimization has been\nlimited when examining the impact of residential segrega-\ntion. Although past studies have shown structural similarities\nbetween these two groups, there are additional issues that\nmay impact the Hispanic population differently than African\nAmericans. For example many Hispanics, primarily those\nwho are a part of the recent immigrant group, face barriers to\nemployment, political, and social institutions. Additional\nmany must overcome language barriers, which is not a prob-\nlem for most members of other urban poor groups.As a result\nHispanics often face higher levels of segregation (Charles,\ntion, they will often experience limited opportunities to attain\nSampson & Bean, 2006) and limited housing opportunities\nas a result of discriminatory practices (Charles, 2003). Even\nwithin the Hispanic population, there are sub-cultural varia-\ntions in terms of levels of segregation (Massey & Denton,\nEven though Hispanics do experience more structural dis-\nadvantage than Whites, they generally experience less than\nAfrican Americans. In addition, there is emerging data that\nseem to indicate that, unlike the African American popula-\ntion, the segregation of Hispanics from Whites, especially\nBisciglia 3\nwhen self-imposed, may serve to mitigate violent victimiza-\ntion rather than promote it. This phenomenon has been\ndubbed the Latino Paradox (Sampson, 2008; Sampson &\nBean, 2006). The argument becomes that when Hispanics\nisolate themselves within an ethnic enclave, the informal\nsocial controls of the community will work to lessen rather\nthan promote violent victimization. Further segregation may\nalso work to insulate community members from the negative\neffects of poverty and isolation. At the same time, these com-\nmunities can also fill the role of assimilating new immigrants\ncultural bond (Feldmeyer, 2009; M. T. Lee, Martinez &\neconomic aid, employment opportunities/information, and\nsocial support all of which may work to lower the rate of\nviolent crime victimization (Desmond & Kubrin, 2009;\nBecause the concept of the Latino Paradox hinges on a\nshared cultural background, one would expect that the segre-\ngation of Hispanics may only prove beneficial in situations\nwhere segregation occurs among a single ethnic group rather\nthan a more diverse representation of Hispanic ethnicities.\nThe end result becomes that although isolated from Whites,\nHispanics may still thrive in these communities where these\nprotective factors are more entrenched via the Latino\nTo summarize, previous research examining the relation-\nship between minorities and the majority population has gen-\nerally shown that the effects of segregation have promoted\nhigher rates of violent victimization. Such a finding has been\ndemonstrated in non-racially disaggregated analysis (Hannon\nVelez et al., 2003) as well as within racially disaggregated\nFurthermore, although more macro-structural analyses of\nnon-African American minority groups have appeared, fur-\nther research is still necessary as Hispanics experience simi-\nlar as well as unique structural differences compared with\n& Nelson, 2008). Last, growing research has alluded to the\npossibility that unlike African American segregation has\nconsistently been shown to be associated with rising levels of\nviolent victimization (Shihadeh & Bisciglia, 2008; Shihadeh\n& Flynn, 1996), segregation among the Hispanic population\nmay actually work to insulate some from lethal violence\nGiven the body of literature on this topic, two research\nexpectations are predicted from the forthcoming analysis. It\nis predicted that in major U.S. cities, residential segregation\nas measured by the index of dissimilarity between Hispanics\nand Whites will have a positive effect on rates of Hispanic\nhomicide victimization. The second hypothesis asserts that\nHispanic segregation as measured by exposure to the White\npopulation will also have a positive association on rates of\nHispanic homicide victimization.\nMethod\nData Sources\nThis study examines the expectations presented above\nthrough the use of a city-level analysis within the United\nStates. Data used for this analysis was taken from three\nsources. First, data for the independent variables were drawn\nfrom the U.S. Census Bureau's Summary Tape File 3 (STF3).\nFurther data regarding segregation (Index of Dissimilarity\nand Exposure) were acquired from Census data compiled\nand released by the Lewis Mumford Center for Comparative\nUrban and Regional Research. This included both the afore-\nmentioned segregation indices. The dependent variable\n(Hispanic homicide) was drawn from the Centers for Disease\nControl's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) mor-\ntality files. These files are used primarily due to the inconsis-\ntency of reporting for Hispanics in the UCR (see Martinez,\n1996). To avoid the possibility of year-to-year fluctuations in\nhomicide rates, a 3-year average will be used bridging the\nUnit of Analysis\nThe unit of analysis for this study is cities in the United\nStates, as this is the most probable location of poverty, crime,\nand social disorganization. Using cities with large popula-\ntions also allows access to ethnic enclaves that may not be\npresent in smaller communities. For the purpose of this\nstudy, cities to be included should satisfy two criteria:\nand (b) they must have a Hispanic population of greater than\nin this analysis.\nDependent Variable (Hispanic Homicide)\nThe dependent variable is the Hispanic homicide rate. To\nexamine homicides there are two primary sources that one\nmay turn to. The first is the UCR, and the second is taken\nfrom the vital statistics data collected by the NCHS. While\nthe methods of collection differ, research has shown a similar\nrate of homicide between the two sources. Data collected by\nthe NCHS gain its information through the collection and\ncoding of death certificates from throughout the United\nStates. Like the UCR, these reports are reliant on the deci-\nsions of the individual imputing the original data, in this case\na medical examiner or coroner. While this may be problem-\natic, there is consistency between the two measures (Riedel,\n1999). A singular benefit for the use of the UCR over the\nmortality files rests on the fact that the UCR may provide\n4 SAGE Open\ninformation on the offender as well as the victim; however,\nas the majority of homicides are intra-racial, for the purpose\nof this study, such a distinction is unnecessary (Martinez,\n1996). Because the UCR has not required the collection of\nanalysis will rely on the data taken from the Centers for\nDisease Control (CDC) Mortality files. In addition, as we are\nconcerned with Hispanic homicide, data from victimization\nsources such as the National Crime Victimization Survey\nwould not provide this information. Through the use of the\nCDC data, information on race/ethnicity of victim, city of\ndeath, and residence can be obtained. To be assured of the\npotential structural effects of Hispanic homicides, only\nhomicides where the residency and occurrence of the homi-\ncide were the same are included in this analysis. Due to the\nrarity of a homicide event, a 3-year average will be used to\naccount for possible year to year fluctuations.\nIndependent Variable (Segregation)\nFor this analysis segregation will be measured through the\nuse of the index of dissimilarity, which measures unevenness\n(see Massey & Denton, 1988). The index of dissimilarity is\ncalculated by the following formula:\nD\ni i\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00d7\nwhere X\ni\nrefers to the proportion of all Hispanics in a\ngiven census tract and A\ni\nrefers to the proportion of Whites in\na given census tract.\nThe index of dissimilarity is used to assess the segrega-\ntion between two groups (in this analysis Hispanics and\nWhites). Ranging from 0 to 100, the higher the values, the\ngreater the segregation between these two groups and the\nmore residents who would need to relocate from one census\ntract to another to produce racial parity across a given city,\nthe geographic unit of analysis for this study (Shihadeh &\nSwanson, 2004). In the case of this analysis, as the index of\ndissimilarity gets larger, Hispanics and Whites become more\nsegregated from one another. As a result, it would mean that\nmembers of one group would need to relocate to lower the\noverall level of segregation in the city.\nIn addition to the measure of dissimilarity, this analysis\nwill measure segregation based on the exposure/isolation\nindex. This index examines the possible contact that may\nexist between group members (Massey & Denton, 1988;\nwhere lower values indicate a greater degree of isolation\nfrom other groups and higher values indicate that the group\nin question resides in areas with different races or ethnicities\n(Siegel & Swanson, 2004). The use of this measure offers\ninsight into the settlement patterns among a specific group.\nFor example, if the exposure to other groups is relatively\nhigh, this indicates that the minority group under investiga-\ntion tends to reside among the reference group. Conversely if\nthis value is low, then members of the minority group tend to\nreside among their own enclaves.\nExposure by means of the interaction index is calculated\nby the following formula:\nP\nX\nX\nY\nt\ni i\ni\n* =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere X\ni\nrefers to number of Hispanics in area i (e.g.,\ncensus tract), Y\ni\nrefers to the number of members in the refer-\nence group in a given area (e.g., Whites in a given census\ntract), X refers to the total number of Hispanics in the popu-\nlation (e.g., city) and t\ni\nrefers to the total population in a\ngiven area (e.g., census tract).\nThese data were calculated and compiled by the Lewis\nMumford Center using the above-described method. Data\nwere provided for exposure and dissimilarity scores for 2000\nfor Hispanics to Whites.\nControl Variables\nA recurring problem in the research of Hispanics has been\nthe inconsistency of how this group is measured. This analy-\nsis proposes the traditional measure of Hispanics. This mea-\nsure follows past studies that identify as individuals whose\nnational origin is of Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican, or one of\nany other 20 Spanish-speaking nationalities (Bean & Tienda,\nA secondary measure of the Hispanic population that will\nbe used in this analysis is the Hispanic index of qualitative\nvariation (IQV). This measure indicates the degree of disper-\nsion among the various Hispanic ethnicities under investiga-\ntion. This analysis breaks Hispanic ethnicities into four\ngroups, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Mexicans, and Other\nHispanics. When calculated, the Hispanic IQV produces a\nscore of 0 to 1, where higher values indicate a greater level of\ndispersion of the various Hispanic ethnic groups. For exam-\nple, if the value of a given city's IQV were 0, it would indi-\ncate that all members of the Hispanic minority were of a\ncommon ethnicity (e.g., Puerto Rican). Conversely if a city's\nHispanic IQV were 1, then there would be an equal number\nof Hispanics in each ethnic classification. Although these\nmeasures seem similar, preliminarily analyses have not\nshown a high degree of correlation between the population\ncounts of Hispanics and the Hispanic IQV. The use of this\nmeasure is unique to previous studies as most have relied\nonly on a measure of total Hispanic population. I argue that\nthe use of such a measure is misleading as it fails to capture\nthe possible lack of social interaction between different\nHispanic nationalities. Furthermore, the use of this measure\nwill allow us to determine if heterogeneity in the Hispanic\ncommunity acts to reinforce traditional roles and social\nstructures compared with areas where these ethnic enclaves\nBisciglia 5\nmay not be as pronounced. As stated earlier research has\nalluded to the idea that unlike minority groups, such as\nAfrican Americans, segregation may work to insulate\nHispanics from the negative effects associated with segrega-\ning may however be effected by not only the segregation of\nHispanics to the majority population but may also be effected\nby the ethnic make-up of the Hispanic population. A measure\nsuch as this allows for an accounting not only of segregation\nbetween racial/ethnic groups but within the Hispanic com-\nmunity as well.\nThis analysis utilizes a number of additional control mea-\nsures that previous research examining rates of homicide have\nused. To control for possible variations in welfare assistance,\nwhich may have an effect on family formation (Shihadeh &\nSteffensmeier, 1994), the average level of assistance will be\nused. Also, included in this analysis is the average age of the\nmale population (ethnic specific), as areas with high concen-\ntrations of youths tend to have higher rates of criminal involve-\nment (Greenberg, 1985; Steffensmeier, Allan, Harer, &\nStreifel, 1989). Population size for a given city will also be\ncalculated as the total number of residences. In addition, race/\nethnic-specific population measures will be used.\nEducation was also taken into consideration for this anal-\nysis and was reported as the average level of education\nattained by the race/ethnic-specific group under investiga-\ntion. In addition to education, this analysis also examines\nHispanic unemployment. This analysis uses the percentage\nfor the Hispanic male population who are unemployed. Tied\nto this concept of unemployment are Hispanic male youth\nwho are considered disengaged from common social institu-\ntions. This measure calculates the percentage of Hispanic\nmales between the ages of 16 and 19 years who are in neither\nschool nor the military nor the labor force. This analysis will\nutilize a gini concentration ratio to determine the inequality\nof income for a given city\nThis study will also control for region with a southwest\ndummy variable. The southwest dummy was calculated by\ntaking all cities considered to be in the southwest of the\nUnited States (Arizona, California, New Mexico, Colorado,\nand Texas). The primary reason for this is due to the large\nconcentration of Hispanics who reside in this area.\nTo measure housing structure, two measures were consid-\nered. The first measure examined the percentage of homes\nwithin a city that were multi-family dwellings. This was cal-\nculated by taking the total number of structures with more\nthan five units (e.g., apartments) and dividing them by\nthe total number of housing structures within a community.\nThe second measure used a calculation of population density.\nThis was projected as the total number of individuals resid-\ning within a city's geographically defined limits divided by\nthe total available landmass of the city. An examination of\nthese measures reported a high level of colinearity between\nthe two and the latter was included in the forthcoming analy-\nsis (see Appendix for a complete correlation matrix for all\nvariables use in this analysis). The decision to use population\ndensity was due to the increasing number of multi-family\nstructures that are changing the urban landscape of many\nmajor cities (e.g., town homes and condominiums). Such a\nshift represents a change in the traditional concept of low-\nincome apartment structures that the former measure had\noriginally been used to for.\nResults: Descriptive Statistics\nTable 1 presents the means and standard deviations for the\nmeasures that were used in this analysis. Based on a sample\nnumber of homicides among Hispanics was 7.42 per year\nwith a standard deviation of 26.38. As a point of comparison,\nAfrican American homicides were also calculated in 208 cit-\nof these cities indicated that the average number of African\nAmerican homicides was 19.76 with a standard deviation of\nBy looking at these two racial/ethnic groups, we can see\nthat not only do African Americans experience a higher num-\nber of homicides on average, but there is a greater amount of\ndispersion in their scores as well. As another point of refer-\nence, when looking at the number of homicide victims\namong the White population, the average number of homi-\nconfirms previous studies that have shown that Hispanics\nhomicides fall more closely to that of Whites than to African\n2002).To illustrate the difference in segregation, this analysis\npresents two measures of segregation and will discuss them\nin relationship to African Americans to give perspective to\nthe measures for Hispanics. Previous research documents the\ninfluence of African American segregation on a number of\nsocial problems (Sampson, 1987; Shihadeh & Steffensmeier,\n1994). This study examined the impact of segregation to\ndetermine if a similar effect exists. To measure segregation,\nthis study utilized two measures of segregation. The first is\nthe index of dissimilarity. Among Hispanics on average\n34.82% of this population would have to relocate to achieve\nan even distribution between Whites and Hispanics. These\nstandard deviation of 11.91%. In comparison, African\nAmericans experienced a higher level of segregation than\nHispanics. On average, African Americans exhibit a dissimi-\nHispanics. Furthermore, there is a larger range of dissimilar-\ndeviation of 18.05%). Overall these data demonstrate that\nHispanics experience a lesser degree of segregation than\nAfrican Americans.\nTo further explore the issue of segregation, a measure\nbased on isolation was also utilized. Isolation or exposure to\n6 SAGE Open\nother groups is based on the potential that a randomly chosen\nindividual in the group under investigation (e.g., Hispanics)\nwill come into contact with a random individual of the refer-\nence group (e.g., Whites; Siegel & Swanson, 2004). Like dis-\nsimilarity, exposure will vary from 0% to 100% where lower\nvalues indicate that the group under investigation is isolated\nor lacks exposure to the reference group. Among Hispanics\nin large cities, the average exposure was 47.30% with a stan-\ndard deviation of 20.11%. This was slightly higher than the\naverage exposure of African Americans that was 42.30%\nwith a standard deviation of 21.68%. These findings indicate\nthat the level of exposure between Hispanics and Whites is\nslightly higher than between African Americans and Whites.\nWhen examining segregation on the basis of exposure, the\nrange for African Americans and Hispanics was almost iden-\nAmericans).\nWhether segregation is based on dissimilarity or expo-\nsure, these results point to a similar conclusion, namely that\nAfrican Americans experience a greater level of segregation\ncompared with Hispanics. The findings for both of these\nmeasures highlight the importance that segregation may\nhave on both populations. Although Hispanics do experience\na lesser amount of segregation, it may in part explain why\ntheir rates of homicide, although not as high as African\nAmericans, remain higher than that of Whites.\nResults: Multivariate Statistics\nOne question that has surrounded the literature concerning\nhomicides has been the influence of negative disadvantages\n(e.g., segregation, poverty, lack of education, etc.) on minor-\nity groups as it relates to homicide. This section will examine\nthe disadvantage of segregation on two separate dimensions.\nThe first looks at segregation based on the index of dissimi-\nlarity (unevenness) while the second measures segregation\non the basis of exposure (potential contact).\nThe first model of Table 2 examines the influence of seg-\nregation through the use of the index of dissimilarity. These\nfindings show a strong positive association between segrega-\ntion among Hispanics and Whites and the number of Hispanic\nhomicides. Based on the these results, we find that for every\none standard deviation increase in Hispanic/White segrega-\ntion, there is a 144.31% increase in the number of homi-\ncides.2 This finding highlights the negative impact of\nsegregation on Hispanics. This analysis also looks at the\neffect of ethnic isolation to see if it affects the number of\nhomicides. Based on the findings of this analysis, the IQV,\nused to measure the dispersion of Hispanic ethnicities, indi-\ncates that no significant association exists. Based on these\nfindings, a concentration of a single Hispanic ethnicity did\nnot increase or decrease the number of Hispanic homicides.\nTable 2 also presents the results of the analysis for\nHispanics for a variety of control measures. These findings\ndemonstrate that a variety of control measures significantly\nimpact the number of homicides that occur among Hispanics.\nWithin this community housing costs show a negative asso-\nciation with homicides. As the median rent for Hispanics\ndecreases by a single standard deviation, there is a 35.47%\nincrease in the number of homicides. Interestingly, among\nHispanics income inequality does not significantly impact\nthe number of homicides. Among Hispanics regionalism is\nalso associated with homicides, where individuals residing in\nthe southwest experienced a higher number of homicides\ncompared with those in non-Southwestern regions of the\nUnited States. Finally, factors such as education and age are\nsignificant in this model. Educational attainment was found\nto lower homicides among Hispanics (3.76% for each stan-\ndard deviation increase in education). Also, as the average\nage of the male population decreases homicides increase.\nThe second model presented in Table 2 analyses the\nimpact of segregation on homicide using the measure of\nexposure. Exposure, like dissimilarity, is significantly asso-\nciated with Hispanic homicide. In this case the association\nwas negative, meaning that as Hispanics become more iso-\nlated within their own enclaves the number of homicides\nincreased. For each standard deviation decrease in the expo-\nsure of Hispanics to Whites, the number of homicides\nincreased by 27.51%. Regardless of which measure is used,\nthe impact of segregation is clear, namely that segregation\nfrom the majority group has a negative outcome on the\nminority group.\nThe findings of the second model were generally consis-\ntent with the first model, with a few exceptions. First, in this\nmodel income inequality does show a statistically significant\nassociation to the number of homicides that occur. Second,\nunlike in the previous model Hispanic female-headed house-\nholds were significantly associated with Hispanic homicide.\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics.\nDependent variable\nIndependent variables\nControl variables (demographics)\nControl variables (economics)\nNote. IQV = index of qualitative variation.\nBisciglia 7\nFinally, in the exposure model, Hispanic males who are unat-\ntached to social institutions (disengaged) are also positively\nassociated with homicide.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nBased on a review of the literature on the subject of segrega-\ntion and lethal violence, two hypotheses were predicted. The\nresults of an analysis using negative binomial regression\nmodels on a 236-city sample was implemented to test these\nexpectations. The first hypothesis asserted that increased\nsegregation, measured by the index of dissimilarity, between\nHispanics and Whites would result in higher instances of\nhomicide. The results of this analysis were confirmed in the\nregression model, indicating that for each standard deviation\nincrease in the index of dissimilarity resulted in a corre-\nsponding 144.31% increase in Hispanic homicide. Such a\nfinding seems in line with previous research concerning seg-\nregation and homicide.\nThe second expectation of this study asserted that poten-\ntial exposure (or isolation) would impact rates of Hispanic\nhomicide. In this case, it was predicted that as Hispanics\nbecame more isolated from the majority population (Whites),\nthe rates of homicide would increase, or that as they became\nmore exposed to the majority group rates of homicide would\ngo down. Results indicated that as exposure decreased\n(Hispanics became more isolated from Whites) homicides\nTheoretically, this research demonstrates that many of the\nstructural factors that serve to disorganize metropolitan com-\nmunities (e.g., income inequality, segregation, poverty, etc.)\nare shown to have an affect on members of the Hispanic\ncommunity in a similar fashion as they affect African\nAmericans. The findings of this analysis follow the consen-\nsus of previous research specifically in showing that segrega-\ntion (measured in both manners) between the majority group\nand Hispanics is associated with rising homicide rates\nShihadeh & Bisciglia, 2008). Even though Hispanics experi-\nence a lower number of homicide victimizations thanAfrican\nAmericans (Logan et al., 2011; Martinez & Valenzuela,\n2006), many of the same structural components that are asso-\nciated with African American homicides had similar effects\namong this group. Such findings lend support to the concept\nthat structural elements within urban communities as corre-\nlated with segregation are likely to affect any potential num-\nber of minority groups.\nNotwithstanding, in recent years, a growing body of lit-\nerature has asserted that among Hispanics, segregation may\nactually work to buffer violent crime rather than promote it\nanalysis finds support for the link between segregation and\nHispanic homicide, there are specific limitations. It has been\nsuggested that the effect of self-segregation may be benefi-\ncial in specific Hispanic communities, namely those that\nTable 2.

Future analysis\nmay seek to tease out this possible variation by distinguish-\ning those urban spaces that have established patterns of\nmigration from those that are representative of new migra-\ntory destinations and therefore are less likely to be represen-\ntative of strong community cohesion and social control.\nSubsequent analyses may also want to take into account\nthe dispersion of Hispanic ethnicities within a community.\nThe logic being, the more homogeneous Hispanics are within\na community (concentrated into a single ethnicity), the\nhigher the probability that members will interact with one\nanother. Simply put, classification as Hispanic may not be\nenough to warrant meaningful contact with other Hispanics,\ninstead a reliance on a more nuanced Hispanic identification\nmay be necessary. As a direction for future analysis, such a\ndistinction may show support for the Latino Paradox as pre-\nsented by Sampson & Bean (2006) that the measures in this\nanalysis failed to demonstrate.\nAlthough the levels of segregation among the Hispanic\npopulation are less than those among African Americans, the\nresults of this study point to a similar outcome as the litera-\nture on African Americans, simply that when segregated\nfrom the majority group of the population potential lethal\nvictimization increases among the minority group. The find-\nings of this study support some previous work regarding seg-\nregation and violent crime, while also demonstrating that the\ncausal macro-social factors that lead to Hispanic homicide\nmay differ from other racial/ethnic groups (Feldmeyer, 2010;\nMartinez, 1996). For this reason, explanations of violent\ncrime that are applied to African Americans may not be ser-\nviceable for to Hispanics. With a rapidly growing Hispanic\npopulation, understanding these causes is paramount to\ndevelop effect crime control policies and community-based\nprograms to address violent crime.\nOverall, the major limitation of this analysis is one that\nis all too often present among the research concerning\nHispanics and that is the lack of distinction between the\nvarious Hispanic ethnicities. Although the U.S. Census col-\nlects data on more than 20 different Hispanic groups,\nresearchers are often likely to place them into a monolithic\ncategory, treating these groups as though they have a com-\nmon ethnic history to draw from, which would equally\ninfluence their structural characteristics and chances of\ncriminal victimization (Bean & Tienda, 1987). Research\nhas clearly shown that among the largest Hispanic ethnici-\nties (Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans), there are vast\ndifferences in terms of their structural location in society,\npatterns of settlement, and socioeconomic status. Although\nthis study did examine Hispanics as an entire population,\none improvement over previous studies was the incorpora-\ntion of the Hispanic IQV measure that allowed for an analy-\nsis of the impact of the dispersion of the various Hispanic\ngroups across a given city. Notwithstanding future macro-\nlevel studies should incorporate an ethnic-specific exami-\nnation of larger Hispanic ethnic groups.\nIn summation, these findings demonstrate that segrega-\ntion, measured as either the index of dissimilarity or expo-\nsure, as well as other macro-social indicators of community\ndisorganization impact Hispanics in a manner that is consis-\ntent not only with previous research on Hispanics but with a\nsimilar body of research on African Americans as well. This\nas well as other findings of this analysis support the presence\nof a macro-link between segregation and homicide among\nHispanics. Beyond conforming findings of previous research\nthis study also deepens the macro-social understanding of\nHispanic homicide victimization through the addition of its\nHispanic IQV measure that has in effect provided an internal\nmeasure of segregation among Hispanics within these com-\nmunities. Although this analysis failed to demonstrate a sig-\nnificant association of this measure, future analysis that is\nmore focused on specific Hispanic communities or patterns\nof immigration may show that such a measure is more pre-\ndictive of homicide victimization.\nBisciglia 9\nAppendix\nCorrelation Matrix.\nNote.
