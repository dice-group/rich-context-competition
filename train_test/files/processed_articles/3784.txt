On\nthe Richter Scale, occurred with an epicentre\nlocated at the township of Wenchuan,\nSichuan Province, China. The death toll\nThe epidemiology of mortality and injury\nmeans that earthquakes can be differen-\ntiated from other natural hazards,2 such as\nhurricanes and Food emergencies. Floods\nand hurricanes typically cause many deaths\ndue to drowning but few serious medical or\nsurgical injuries. By comparison, earth-\nquakes not only cause many deaths initially,\nbut also many severe injuries including\nfracture cases, head injuries, thoracic inju-\nries and abdominal injuries,3\u00ad5 requiring\ncomplex surgical and resuscitative medical\ncare. Many injuries will be severe enough to\nlead to long-term functional impairment\nand disability. Examples include spinal\ncord injuries, fractures that develop compli-\ncations such as infection or alignment prob-\nlems, and crush injuries of the extremities\nrequiring amputation.6 Physical disability is\nan enormous psychological and financial\nburden on the population in terms of\nresources.\nVarious clinical factors may be related to\ninjury-related disability. For example, an\ninjured person with an open wound may\nhave serious internal and external bleeding.\nIn addition, since the protection of the skin\nhas been penetrated, the wound is easily\ncontaminated and may become infected.\nIf the contaminated wound is not cleaned\nin a timely and effective manner, this in turn\nmay lead to long-term disability.7 Therefore,\nappropriate medical and surgical treatment\nfor these injuries is vital to minimize future\nfunctional impairment and disability.8\nIt remains unclear what the important\nfactors are that may affect the risk of injury-\nrelated disability following an earthquake.\nTo understand the significance of the poten-\ntial factors and to determine their relation-\nships with injury-related disability, this\ncurrent study used a chi-squared automatic\ninteraction detection (CHAID) classifica-\ntion tree analysis to evaluate the factors\nidentified following the Wenchuan earth-\nquake. In this way, injured patients who are\nat a high risk of injury-related disability can\nbe readily identified in order to aid in the\nprovision of adequate surgical resources and\nto develop guidelines for the effective treat-\nment of injured patients during future\nearthquakes.\nPatients and methods\nPatient population\nThe West China Hospital of Sichuan\nUniversity, Chengdu, China, the largest\nsouth-east of the epicentre of the Wenchuan\nearthquake. Therefore, it naturally assumed\nthe role of a first-line major rescue centre\nand received the most seriously wounded\npatients.\nThis study was a retrospective review\nof patients injured in the Wenchuan\nearthquake, triaged to the Department of\nEmergency Medicine, West China Hospital,\nwho underwent surgical treatment during\nthe first 5 days after the earthquake between\ndischarged. The exclusion criteria were: (i)\npatients without complete medical records;\n(ii) patients treated in the emergency room\nand released; (iii) patients who underwent\nsurgery during the study period for reasons\nnot related to the earthquake. This study was\napproved by the Institutional Review Board\nof West China Hospital. Written informed\nconsent was obtained from all participants.\nRoutine blood tests, coagulation profiles\nand necessary imaging procedures were\nundertaken before surgery. Packed red\nblood cells were transfused perioperatively\nwhen the patient's haemoglobin levels were\n<80.0 g/l. Fresh frozen plasma and platelets\nwere also transfused according to clinical\nneed.\nAll of the following data were retrieved\nfrom each patient's medical records: sex,\nage, admission time, injured site, wound\ntype, preoperative haemoglobin level, post-\noperative haemoglobin level, blood transfu-\nsion data, surgery performed, operation\ntime, discharge time and surgical outcome\n(recovery and disability). Any of the follow-\ning conditions were considered to be a\ndisability: (i) paraplegia; (ii) limb loss; (iii)\njoint injury with subsequent postoperative\nsignificant movement disturbance; (iv) any\npostoperative visually apparent movement\ndisturbance.\nStatistical analyses\nDescriptive statistical analysis was used to\nsummarize demographic characteristics and\ndata on the injured site, wound type and\nsurgical outcome. All statistical analyses\nwere performed using the SPSS\u00d5 statistical\npackage, version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,\nIL, USA) for Windows\u00d5. A CHAID model\nwas used to analyse the relationships\nbetween disability and potential influencing\nfactors. CHAID is a type of classification\ntree technique that is currently used in data\nmining and machine learning.9,10 The ana-\nlysis proceeds in a stepwise fashion in which\nthe most significant predictor (the largest 2)\nis used to partition the entire sample into\ntwo or more mutually exclusive subgroups.\nAs in the first step, the cases in a given\nsubgroup are further partitioned by the next\nmost significant predictor of the original\noutcome. The analysis continues in this\nmanner until there are no more significant\nsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nDuring the first 5 days after the earthquake,\n334 patients were admitted to hospital and\nunderwent surgical treatment for earth-\nquake-related injuries. Of the 334 patients,\npatients had closed wounds. Of the 334\ncharged without disability, and 113 patients\n(33.8%) were discharged with varying\ndegrees of permanent disability.\nFigure 1 presents the proportion of\npatients according to the major site of\ninjury. The most common major site\nof injury was the lower limbs, followed by\nthe upper limbs, spine, head, abdomen, face\nand neck, pelvis and chest.\nThe CHAID classification tree analysis\nshowed that all participants were initially\nsplit based on the wound type; hence, wound\ntype was the most important influencing\nfactor with regard to the subsequent devel-\nopment of disability (Figure 2). Patients\nwith an open wound were at a higher risk\nof disability than those patients with closed\nwounds. Preoperative haemoglobin level\nwas another important influencing factor,\nparticularly when the haemoglobin level was\nvery low. When preoperative haemoglobin\ndeveloped disability. The time interval\nbetween injury and treatment was also an\nimportant variable for the development of\ndisability. When the time interval was\nbecame disabled, but if the time interval\npatients (48.6%) became disabled. The\nCHAID classification tree also showed that\nchildren (17 years) were more likely to\nsuffer from disability than adults. As nodes 8\nand 9 showed, when the preoperative\nhaemoglobin level was between 86.0 g/l and\n107.0 g/l, the rate of the disability in children\nwas nearly twice as high as in adults (59.1%\nDiscussion\nThe CHAID classification tree analysis\nundertaken in this current study demon-\nstrated that patients with open wounds were\nat a relatively high risk of disability: (i) when\ntheir preoperative haemoglobin level was\nvery low (<86.0 g/l); (ii) when the haemo-\nin children (17 years); and (iii) when their\nhaemoglobin level was not low (>107.0 g/l),\nbut when the time interval between injury\nand treatment was long (>54.7 h).\nThe warning period for onset of an\nearthquake is limited, so it is hard to com-\npletely avoid injuries and loss of life.12\nAlthough some injuries can be successfully\nFigure 1. Proportion of patients (n \u00bc 334) who were admitted and underwent surgical treatment for\nearthquake-related injuries following the Wenchuan earthquake categorized according to the major site\nof injury.\ntreated by surgical procedures, poor results,\nespecially disabilities, are often reported\nafter earthquakes.13\u00ad16 However, it remains\nunclear what the important factors are that\nmay affect the risk of developing injury-\nrelated disability. Identification of these\ninfluencing factors is needed to improve\nthe management of earthquake-related inju-\nries and reduce disabilities. This is of par-\nticular concern in developing countries,\nespecially in Asia where most earthquakes\nstrike densely populated areas.17\nA devastating earthquake may cause\nmassive destruction of roads and basic\nfacilities, so victims often fail to have\naccess to timely and effective medical atten-\ntion, which may further exacerbate their\ninjuries. In this present study, the interval\nbetween injury time and treatment time were\nclosely related to clinical outcome. When the\ntime interval was >2 days, the rate of\ndisability was much higher than when the\ntime interval was <1 day. This indicates that\ntreatment delay is associated with a higher\nrisk of disability. Therefore, timely emer-\ngency treatment of the critically injured\npatient is essential to reduce disabilities.18\nWound type was identified as the\nmost important influencing factor for pre-\ndicting disability in this present study.\nInjured patients with open wounds were\nmore likely to become disabled than those\nwith closed wounds. The reason may be that\nthe injured patient with an open wound has\nthe potential for the development of serious\nbacterial wound infections and tissue necro-\nsis, which would contribute to the disabil-\nity.19 In the Department of Laboratory\nMedicine of West China Hospital, Gram-\nnegative bacilli were cultured from 71.3%\nand Gram-positive bacilli were cultured\nWound type\nCategory % n\nSurgical outcome\nPreoperative haemoglobin\nCategory % n\nOpen wound\nCategory % n\nCategory % n\nCategory % n\nCategory % n\nCategory % n\nCategory % n\nCategory % n\nCategory % n\nCategory % n\nAge\nTime interval between injury and treatment\nCategory % n\nCategory % n\nClosed wound\nTime interval between injury and treatment\nFigure 2. A chi-squared automatic interaction detection classification tree analysis to identify the factors\nrelated to the development of long-term disability in patients (n \u00bc 334) who were admitted and underwent\nsurgical treatment for earthquake-related injuries following the Wenchuan earthquake.\nindicates that injured patients should first be\ntreated with preliminary wound debride-\nment in the earthquake field, and then sent\nto hospital for further treatment. This strat-\negy may help to prevent future disability.\nIn this present study, patients with a\nlower preoperative haemoglobin level were\nat a higher risk of disability, especially for\npatients with an open wound and a haemo-\nglobin level <86.0 g/l. This indicates that\ninjuries related to internal and external\nbleeding have an important influence on\npatient recovery. Excessive bleeding has in\nsome cases been reported to result in death\nor permanent disability.21 The reason might\nalso be that excessive bleeding might weaken\nthe immune system, which may exacerbate\nwound infection.22 Another reason is that\nlower haemoglobin levels decrease the\noxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, redu-\ncing tissue oxygenation. In this hypoxic\nstate, patients might suffer from tissue\nnecrosis leading to permanent disability.23\nTherefore, control of bleeding is necessary\nfor proper wound management.\nThese current results also suggest that\nchildren were more likely to develop disabil-\nity after an earthquake, which was consist-\nent with a previous study.24 Because of their\nlimited ability to react to emergencies and\ntheir weaker physical resistance, children\nwere easily buried underneath collapsible\ndebris, which exacerbated their injuries,\nmaking them too severe and complex to\nfully recover from. It has been reported that\nvery young children have a relatively lower\nresilience to injury and a lower ability to\ntake proactive actions to cope with post-\ndisaster conditions.25 For this vulnerable\npopulation, timely treatment and special\nmedical care should be provided. In terms\nof injury prevention measures, this may\nreflect the fact that at the time of an\nearthquake, children usually do not have\nenough knowledge to seek safe places to\nshelter. Future education for school-age\nchildren regarding basic safety behaviour\nduring an earthquake may reduce the like-\nlihood of disability within this group.\nIn conclusion, the present study used a\nCHAID classification tree analysis to com-\nprehensively explore the influencing factors\nfor the development of disability among\npatients injured in an earthquake, and it\nidentified those patient groups that are at a\nhigh risk of developing permanent disability.\nIn terms of available medical resources and\nthe likelihood of providing timely treatment\nfor large numbers of injured patients, this\nstudy can help to stratify patients according\nto their medical needs, and to help allocate\nresources in a manner ensuring the greatest\nhealth benefit for the greatest number of\ninjured patients.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
