    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: Kidney development is key to the onset of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases in adults, and in the\nfetal stage will be impaired by a lack of nutrients in utero in animal models. However, few human studies have been\nperformed.\nMethods: Kidney samples from fetuses in a fetal growth restriction (FGR) environment were collected and the\nmorphological characteristics were observed. Potentially molecular mechanisms were explored by analyzing apoptosis\nand kidney-development related gene expression.\nResults: The results indicated that no malformations were observed in the kidney samples of the FGR group, but the\nmean kidney weight and volume were significantly decreased. Moreover, the ratio of apoptotic cells and Bax-positive\ncells was increased and the ratio of Bcl-2-positive cells was decreased in the FGR group, indicating potential apoptosis\ninduction under an in utero FGR environment. Finally, aberrant expression of renin and angiotensinogen indicated\npotential kidney functional abnormalities in the FGR group.\nConclusions: Our study suggested increased apoptosis and decreased renin and angiotensinogen expression during\nhuman kidney development in an FGR environment. The current results will be helpful to further explore the molecular\nmechanism of FGR and facilitate future studies of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases and the establishment of\npreventive methods.\n",

Originally the so-called Baker Hypothesis\ndescribed permanent responses to the impairment and\nstress in the developmental stages of a fetus, but since\nthen, this hypothesis has been renamed the Fetal Origins of\nAdult Disease.1 In this process, the fetus may survive, but\nexhibit permanent physiological, morphological and meta-\nbolic responses that increase susceptibilities to particular\ndiseases. Recently, this concept has also been widely\nreferred to as the Developmental Origins of Health and\nFetal growth restriction (FGR) can result from maternal\ndystrophia, preeclampsia and hyperuricemia. To protect\nkey organs (heart and brain), the blood is redistributed to\nthe key organs rather than the kidneys, liver and muscle\ntissues, which results in the non-optimal development of\nother organs under conditions of diminished oxygen and\nnutrition, which can enhance the prevalence of various dis-\neases in adults.3 Currently, about 30 million newborns\nworldwide are diagnosed with FGR, which is one of the\nmost important potential risk factors of future health-\nrelated problems in humans.\nEffects of a restricted fetal growth\nenvironment on human kidney\nmorphology, cell apoptosis and\ngene expression\nYan-Ping Wang, Xu Chen, Zhi-Kun Zhang, Hong-Yan Cui, Peng\nWang and Yue Wang\n Keywords\nRenin\u00adangiotensinogen system, uterine environment, fetal kidney development, apoptosis, gestation\nDepartment of Obstetrics, Tianjin Central Hospital of Gynecology\nObstetrics, China\nCorresponding author:\nXu Chen, Department of Obstetrics, Tianjin Central Hospital of\nGynecology Obstetrics, No. 156 Nankai 3rd Road, Nankai District,\nOriginal Article\nMoreover, some studies reported that hypertension in\nadults aged 46\u00ad64 years was closely related to the inci-\ndence of lower birth weight.4,5 Other than higher blood\npressure, low birth body weight may also induce the\nincreasing incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular dis-\neases (CVDs) in adults. In Sweden, an epidemiological\nstudy indicated that low birth weight (< 2.5 kg) and dimin-\nished weight gain by one year of age (< 8 kg) was strongly\ncorrelated to the incidence of diabetes and myocardial\ninfarction later in life.6 Therefore, FGR in the perinatal\nperiod may increase the risk of endocrinological abnor-\nmalities and CVD.\nAlthough the mechanisms of FGR remain largely\nunknown, the importance of FGR has been accepted\nworldwide. Animal models have been used to mimic the\ncompromised uterine environment of FGR to identify\npotential mechanisms. Typical methods to establish animal\nmodels of FGR include total thermal limitation, total pro-\ntein limitation, maternal chronic oxygen deficit, dysfunc-\ntional placenta, and perinatal glucocorticoid treatment.\nMore recently, models of FGR have been successfully\nestablished in mammals. In these models, significant cor-\nrelations were identified between FGR and the onset of\ndiseases in the mature animals. Offspring that matured in a\ncompromised uterine environment exhibited changes in\nphysiology and organ development. Moreover, kidney\nimpairment was prevalent in all of the animal models,\ncharacterized by a decreased number of nephrons.\nIn humans, Keller et al. observed that the number of\nnephrons decreased by up to 50% and the glomerular vol-\nume doubled in hypertensive patients when compared with\nnormotensive patients. These findings indicated that a\ndecrease in nephron number resulted in hyperpiesis and\nthe increased glomerular volume was attributable to com-\npensatory hypertrophy and ultrafiltration.7 Both research\nteams studied kidney development in a FGR model and\nsuggested that the number of nephrons decreased by 35%\ncompared with normal fetuses.8,9 Regarding the roles of\nthe kidneys in the regulation of isohydria and blood pres-\nsure,1,10 a decrease in the nephron number likely contrib-\nutes to onset of adult diseases; however, specific\nmechanisms remain largely unknown.\nIn the present study, we identified correlations between\nbirth body weight and the number of nephrons by calculat-\ning the number of apoptotic renal cells in fetuses under\nFGR conditions compared with those of normal fetuses.\nFinally, important genes and proteins that promoted or\ninhibited apoptosis were identified and potential mecha-\nnisms explored.\nMaterials and methods\nEthics statement\nAll experimental protocols were approved by the insti-\ntutional review board of Tianjin Central Hospital of\nGynecology Obstetrics (Tianjin, China). All partici-\npants were informed of all procedural details, including\nthe study duration, methods, publication of results and\nthe disposal of the research samples, and submitted\nsigned informed consent forms. No financial incentives\nwere offered for sample collection. We guaranteed that\nall of the research samples were to be used for basic\nscientific research and not medical purposes.\nKidney collection\nA total of 11 FGR fetal kidney samples were collected\nfrom pregnant women with or without preeclampsia from\nHospital, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Of\nthese samples, eight were obtained from pregnant women\nwith moderate to severe preeclampsia and three from\nwomen with normal pregnancies. During the same period,\na total of 12 non-FGR samples were also collected from\nwomen with normal pregnancies. All kidney samples had\nnormal morphologies with no obvious malformations.\nThe left kidneys were collected from late-term aborted\nfetuses, weighed and immediately fixed with 10% forma-\nlin before the nephron number was determined. The kid-\nney volume was calculated using the water displacement\nmethod. Briefly, the kidney was submerged in a bottle full\nof water and the overflow was collected to determine the\ndisplaced volume.\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining\nThe kidney tissues were dehydrated with ethanol, embed-\nded in paraffin, cut into 4\u00ad6-m thick slices, dewaxed with\nxylene, subjected to gradient alcohol hydration and stained\nwith H&E stain. The samples were cleared in xylene and\nmounted under a light microscope (80i; Nikon, Tokyo,\nJapan). Two experienced pathologists who were blinded to\nthe experimental protocol scored the kidney tissues for the\ndegree of apoptosis, and at least 20 H&E sections in each\ngroup were scored.\nApoptotic cell identification via the terminal\ndeoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP\nnick end-labeling (TUNEL) method\nApoptosis was indicated by DNA strand breaks in cell\nnuclei and detected using the TUNEL assay according to\nthe manufacturer's instructions. The H&E-stained sec-\ntions were deparaffinized, digested with proteinase K (20\ng/ml; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and then\nincubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase\n(TdT) buffer (0.3 U/l) and biotinylated dUTP (0.2 mM;\nRoche) in 1\u00d7 TdT buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,\nUSA) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Next, the sections were incubated\nin 10% normal horse serum to block nonspecific binding\nand then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an\navidin\u00adbiotin complex (dilution, 1:100) included in the\nVectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.,\nBurlingame, CA, USA). The sections were then counter-\nstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydro-\nchloride (DAPI; Life Technologies) to identify cell nuclei\nand examined by fluorescence microscopy (80i).\nTUNEL-positive cells were counted in five randomly\nchosen fields for each section and presented as a percent-\nage of the total number of cells.\nReverse transcription polymerase chain reaction\n(RT-PCR) and quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)\nanalysis\nTotal RNA was extracted from the kidney samples. cDNA\nwas synthesized from 1 g of DNase-treated RNA with\nrandom hexamers and an 80-ng equivalent was used in\neach PCR reaction. All cDNA synthesis and PCR reaction\ncomponents were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad,\nCA, USA). Expression levels of the selected target genes\nwere further analyzed by real-time PCR. cDNA was pre-\npared from 500 ng of total RNAfollowing DNase treatment\nand 10 ng of RNAand gene-specific primers (Table 1) were\nused for PCR amplification. Melting curve analysis was\nperformed at the end of each reaction. Data are presented as\nthe mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean from three independ-\nent experiments. Expression levels were normalized to\n-actin (internal control).\nWestern blot analysis\nThe kidney samples were lysed in 200 \u00b5l of radioimmuno-\nprecipitation assay buffer containing fresh protease inhibi-\ntor cocktail tablets. Equivalent amounts of protein, as\ndetermined by the colorimetric Bradford protein assay,\nwere resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide\ngel electrophoresis with 12% agarose gels and then trans-\nferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, which were\nthen blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk before immuno-\nassay using human monoclonal antibodies. Expression\nlevels were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate\ndehydrogenase (internal control).\nStatistical analysis\nSignificant differences between the FGR and control\ngroups were identified using the t-test. A probability (p)\nvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nClinical data\nGeneral clinical data for the patients and fetuses are sum-\nmarized in Table 2. In the FGR group, the mean patient age\nsignificantly different from that of the pregnant women in\nthe control group. In the FGR group, the mean pregnancy\nduration was 33.4 weeks, which was comparable to that of\nthe pregnant women in the control group (Table 2).\nIn the FGR group, a total of 11 fetuses (six males and\nfive females) were collected, including three that died\nintrauterine because of placental abruption induced by\nsevere preeclampsia, two from late-term abortions because\nof malformations (one cheilopalatognathus and one dia-\nphragmatocele) merged with severe preeclampsia, and six\nbecause of FGR. In the control group, a total of 12 fetuses\n(five males and seven females) were collected, including\nfour due to cheilopalatognathus, one with abnormal brain\ndevelopment, two with diaphragmatocele, one with achon-\ndroplasia, two with esophageal atresia and two that were\naborted by parental consent. Of the 23 fetuses, all kidneys\nTable 1.

In the\ng, which was significantly lower than that in the control\nvolume collected from the FGR fetuses were also signifi-\ncantly decreased compared with those in the control group.\nThe nephrons were counted, which showed a lower num-\nber in the FGR group (Table 4).\nNext, fetal weight and the number of nephrons were\nanalyzed, which identified a significant positive correla-\n0.001) (Figure 1), indicating that the decreased number of\nnephrons contributed to decreased body weight. There\nwere no correlations between fetal gender and the number\nof nephrons.\nApoptotic cell analysis\nThe TUNEL assay was performed to analyze the mecha-\nnisms of impaired kidney weight and volume in the FGR\ngroup. The positively stained cells, in which the nuclei\nwere stained yellow, were regarded as apoptotic (Figure\n2(a) and (b)). A total of 1000 cells were analyzed in five\nrandom views and the number of apoptotic cells was\nrecorded. The results showed that about 10% of cells in the\nsamples from the FGR group were apoptotic, whereas only\n5.7% were apoptotic in the control group, which was sig-\nnificantly lower (Figure 2(c)). Moreover, two apoptosis-\nrelated genes were expressed in the FGR and control\ngroups. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a much\nhigher ratio of Bax-positive cells and much lower ratio of\nBcl-2-positive cells in the FGR group compared with the\ncontrol group (Figure 3).\nIdentification of renin and angiotensinogen in\nkidney samples\nTo further identify differences between the FGR and con-\ntrol groups, two important genes closely related to kidney\ndevelopment, renin and angiotensinogen, were analyzed\nby RT-PCR and western blot analyses. The results showed\nthat the gene expression profiles of renin and angiotensino-\ngen were significantly down-regulated in the FGR group\ncompared with those of the control group, and the protein\nexpression profiles showed similar tendencies (Figure 4).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we systematically investigated the\neffects of FGR on kidney development and identified\nimportant gene expression profiles. The results indicated\nno malformations in the kidney samples from the FGR\ngroup, but the mean kidney weight and volume were sig-\nnificantly decreased compared with the controls. Moreover,\nthe ratio of apoptotic and Bax-positive cells was increased\nand the ratio of Bcl-2-positive cells was decreased, which\nindicated potential apoptosis induction under the in utero\nTable 3.

Finally, the aberrant expression of two\nimportant kidney development genes indicated potential\nfunctional abnormalities in the FGR group.\nHypertension threatens the health of 25% of the popula-\ntion worldwide and contributes to the onset of CVD and\nchronic renal diseases;11 however, the pathology remains\nunclear, resulting in the scarcity of preventive methods.2\nBaker et al. suggested that CVD was actually the result of\nthe fetus adapting to the lack of nutrients in the uterine envi-\nronment, resulting in morphological and functional changes\nof important fetal organs and an increased risk of hyperten-\nsion and CVD later in life. These results were in accordance\nwith previous epidemiological investigations.12\nResults from a previous animal model study suggested\nthat limited protein intake during pregnancy may result in\nFGR with offspring with a decreased number of\nnephrons,13-15 in accordance with results from a human\nstudy.16 However, the molecular mechanisms remain\nunknown. In the present study, we observed decreased\nfetal body weight, kidney volume and weight, and number\nof nephrons in the FGR group.\nDuring development of organs and tissues, programmed\ncell death is an important process; however, aberrant apop-\ntosis will result in altered organ morphology and func-\ntion.17 During kidney development, nephron formation\nwill be impaired in response to excessive cell death, result-\ning in the presence of atrophic nephrons. In the present\nstudy, the number of apoptotic cells was increased in kid-\nney samples from the FGR group, which may have resulted\nin the decreased kidney volume and weight, as well as the\nlower number of nephrons. Welham et al. fed pregnant rats\nwith a low protein diet and observed that the offspring\nbecame hypertensive because of the decreased number of\nnephrons, the increased number of apoptotic cells, and the\nchanges in renin and angiotensinogen expression.\nTherefore, they concluded that a lack of nutrients in the\nuterine environment will result in hypertension when the\noffspring mature into adults.18\nFigure 1. Correlations of fetal body weight and the number of nephrons.\nIn the present study, Bax and Bcl-2 expression were\nanalyzed. Bcl-2 is a key regulator of apoptosis inhibition,\nwhich can prolong cell proliferation and increase cell num-\nber. Bax belongs to the Bcl-2 family, but functions in\nopposition to Bcl-2. Bax can induce cell apoptosis and\ninactive Bcl-2 by forming heterogenous dimers that coa-\nexpression was significantly down-regulated and Bax\nexpression was significantly up-regulated in FGR mod-\nels,22,23 which was similar to our results in humans.\nFigure 2.

Thus,\naberrant expression of genes in the RAS will result in\nabnormal kidney development. Goyal et al. observed a\ndecreased number of nephrons and onset of hypertension in\na mouse model treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker\nand suggested that RAS plays a key role in kidney growth\nand maturation.25 Grigore et al. feed neonatal mice with a\nhigh dose of the angiotensin receptor inhibitor losartan and\nfound that all mice became hypertensive by the age of 22\nweeks and the number of nephrons was decreased by at\nleast 42%, which indicated that insufficient angiotensin\nactivity will disrupt normal kidney development and result\nin a decreased number of nephrons.26\nIn humans, Moritz et al. observed that cells containing\nrenin were located in the deep cortex and suggested that\nboth the lack of nutrients in the uterine environment and\ninhibition of RAS activity resulted from kidney impair-\nment, and the limited supply of nutrients and oxygen\ninhibited RAS expression.27 In the present study, we\nshowed that renin and angiotensinogen were two key\ngenes that were down-regulated in the RAS, which pro-\nvided further proof of Moritz's hypothesis. Zhang et al.\nsuggested the mRNA expression of these two genes was\ndysregulated in FGR offspring of sheep.28 However, in a\nprevious mouse study, Vehaskari et al. suggested the oppo-\nsite: an up-regulation of mRNA expression of the renal\nrenin protein,29 which may reflect a potential compensa-\ntory mechanism when the fetus is subjected to a lack of\nnutrients in the uterine environment.\nIn conclusion, the results of the present study sug-\ngested the roles of apoptosis in kidney development of\nhuman FGR fetuses and also indicated changes in RAS\ngene expression profiles in these samples. The current\nresults will be helpful for further explorations of FGR\nmolecular mechanisms and also facilitate future studies of\nFigure 4.
