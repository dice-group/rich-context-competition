This is a retrospective cohort\nstudy of the impact of a primary care intervention including an in-hospital, free, adult clinic for poor uninsured patients on\nED visit rates and emergency severity at a nonprofit hospital. We studied adult ED visits during August 16, 2009-August\nmean annual visit rates and discharge emergency severity index (ESI; triage and resource use\u00adbased, calculated Agency for\nHealthcare Research and Quality categories) among high-users (3 ED visits in 12 months) and occasional users. Annual\nannual visit rates were 5.43 (top quartile) and 0.94 (bottom quartile) preintervention, versus 3.21 and 1.11, respectively, for\nreturning high-users, postintervention (all P < .001). Postintervention, the visit rates of new high-users were lower (lowest\nand top quartile rates, 0.6 and 3.23) than preintervention high-users' rates in the preintervention period. Visit rates of the\ntop quartile of occasional users also declined. Subgroup analysis of medically uninsured high-users showed similar results.\nUpon classifying preintervention high-users by emergency severity, postintervention mean ESI increased 24.5% among\nthe lowest ESI quartile, and decreased 12.2% among the top quartile. Pre- and post-intervention sample demographics\nand comorbidities were similar. The observed reductions in overall ED visit rates, particularly low-severity visits; highest\nreductions observed among high-users and the top quartile of occasional users; and the pattern of changes in emergency\nseverity support a positive impact of the primary care intervention.\n",

The hospi-\ntal is located in the inner-city neighborhood of Columbia,\nSouth Carolina, with pockets of minority- and poor-popula-\ntion concentration. In the hospital vicinity, there are 2 other\nfunctioning EDs--one about 3 miles away at a county non-\nprofit hospital that serves as a teaching hospital for the\nUniversity of South Carolina School of Medicine, and\nanother at a nonprofit secular hospital in an adjacent county\nabout 8 miles away in a different direction. The teaching hos-\npital ED is typically overcrowded, known for its long ED\nwaiting time. We studied adult ED patients' visit patterns at\nthe study hospital before and after implementation of a pri-\nmary care intervention at a nonprofit urban hospital in South\nCarolina. Preintervention period patients, classified into ED\nhigh-users and occasional users, were studied for their mean\nannual visit rates and emergency severity, before and after\nthe clinic start date. We also compared preintervention high-\nusers with new high-users of the postintervention period.\ncare intervention that included an adult walk-in primary care\nclinic on-campus, which remains operational to date. The\nintervention consisted of 2 components, an adult primary\ncare clinic on-campus, free of cost for uninsured patients\nunder 200% of poverty. Another component of the interven-\ntion was to actively urge insured ED patients who were ED\nhigh-users or having a chronic disease/primary care\u00adpre-\nventable condition, to either acquire a primary care physician\n(PCP) if they did not have one, or regularly visit their exist-\ning PCP. The hospital management sent the ED staff a direc-\ntive to educate qualifying patients at discharge about the\nimportance of primary care for their condition, and to (1)\nvisit their own PCP regularly, (2) visit one of the hospital's\nprimary care practices (if insured but did not have a PCP), or\n(3) visit the clinic if uninsured. Uninsured patients below\n200% of poverty income qualified for free clinic services.\nPatient education at discharge consisted of a one-time, short\nconversation by the ED staff nurse, reinforced, in some cases\nwith a detailed work-up by the clinic social worker if she was\navailable. ED staff compliance with the directive was not\nmonitored, and the predischarge advice was subject to the\nprevailing urgencies in the ED environment.\nThe clinic is free for uninsured patients up to 200% of\npoverty income (self-reported by the patient with minimal\nsupporting documentation), and it charges a modest, sliding-\nscale fee above this income. It is staffed by an internal medi-\ncine, osteopathy-trained physician; a nurse-practitioner;\nnurse; social worker (to assist chronically ill patients with\nsociomedical needs, and liaise with charity care sources for\npharmacy, laboratory, and imaging); and medical assistants.\nClinic hours are Monday to Wednesday 8 am to 4:30 pm,\nmented by phone access to on-call physicians (for registered\nclinic patients) during off-clinic hours and weekends. The\nclinic PCP and staff provide a primary care medical home\nenvironment, including education about primary care and\nself-management of chronic conditions. After-hours call ser-\nvice is shared by PCPs of the hospital's 7 office-based prac-\ntices including the clinic. The physician on call logs in\nremotely to access the electronic medical record (EMR) sys-\ntem, evaluates the patient's medical history and resolves the\ncall as appropriate (eg, verbal advice or reassurance, calling\nin repeat prescriptions, advice to attend the clinic the next\nday or the ED immediately).\nFree clinical care is complemented by orchestrating\npatient access to a network of charity care options available\nin the region. The social worker provides navigation assis-\ntance for the paperwork needed to access prescriptions\nthrough Welvista, a statewide, charitable donation-supported,\nmail-order pharmacy that dispenses free medications donated\nby leading pharmaceutical manufacturers for uninsured\npatients. This source is reinforced by GoodRx, an Internet-\nbased, discounted prescription drug program, and partner-\nships with low-cost generic drug offerings by large retailers\n(eg, Walmart). Together, these initiatives have resulted in\nalmost full access for indigent patients to either free or neg-\nligible cost medications including most state-of-the-art pre-\nscription drugs. For essential laboratory services, the clinic\nhas negotiated very low patient co-pays ($5 for basic lab\nwork) with the leading corporate provider of lab services in\nthe South Carolina Midlands. Specialized lab tests are pro-\nvided as a charitable donation by the same firm on a case-by-\ncase basis. Similar arrangements are in place for radiology\nservices, supplemented by gratuitous service by the hospital-\nemployed own radiologists/hematologists/other physicians\nand gratuitous use of the hospital's diagnostic equipment\nwhen the out of pocket costs of external providers are beyond\na patient's financial reach. Limited specialist services are\nprovided through a low-cost referral network maintained by\na nearby rural county hospital, which includes this clinic in\nits network. These arrangements are supplemented by gratu-\nitous consultations by the hospital's specialists when needed.\nMost patients, however, are managed by the clinic internist\nand nurse. Specifically, ED high-users with high medical\nneed are eligible for free hospital outpatient procedures\nTsai et al 3\nincluding imaging, free of charge. In addition to active refer-\nral of qualifying ED patients to the clinic, potential future ED\npatients from the community are solicited from patients who\nregister with the clinic. These patients are encouraged by the\nclinic staff to ask their medically needy, indigent friends and\nneighbors to use the clinic services. Word-of-mouth dissemi-\nnation among social networks of clinic users was thought to\nbe a cost-effective way to preempt avoidable ED use from\nthe surrounding community. However, upon arrival at the\nclinic, the same income criteria were applied to walk-in\npatients to identify those who qualified for free services and\nsliding-scale fees.\nOur primary measures of interest were overall hospital\nED visit volumes contributed by high-users, patient-level\nannual visit rates, and mean emergency severity. These mea-\nsures were compared pre- versus postintervention. High-\nusers and occasional users of the preintervention period\nwere tracked through the postintervention period. The sec-\nondary outcome of interest was postintervention conver-\ngence of mean annual visit rates and emergency severity\nbetween returning preintervention high-users and new (pos-\ntintervention) high-users. We considered this an important\noutcome because the primary care intervention continues to\ndate, and should preempt nonemergent ED visits by emerg-\ning new high-users from the community. The study was\napproved by the hospital Ethics Committee and the univer-\nsity's Institutional Review Board.\nStudy Protocol\nWe extracted billing data on all ED visits of adults aged 18\nyears or older during 2 periods. The preintervention period\norganized to group visits by patient (based on name, social\nsecurity number [SSN], date of birth [DOB]). To minimize\nexclusions due to missing/erroneous identifiers, we linked\nED data to the ED patient registration and inpatient admis-\nsion databases using the above as link variables, followed by\nmanual review to rectify errors/missing data. This step\nreduced sample exclusions from 7.6% to 2.7% of visits.\nDe-identified data were extracted into University of South\nCarolina computers for analysis. We excluded patients with a\nsingle ED visit during the 5-year study period if that visit\nended in inpatient admission, implying a clearly appropriate\nuse of the ED for a true, occasional emergency. The study\nintervention did not target such visits, nor was there a subse-\nquent visit by these patients to study longitudinal ED use\nbehavior. These visits constituted similar proportions of the\ntotal ED visit volume, pre- and postintervention, 19.7% ver-\nsus 18.3%, respectively (Table 1), suggesting that the study\nresults may be robust to their exclusion. We studied ED\npatients with all payer sources because significant propor-\ntions of insured patients in the preintervention period did not\nhave a primary care provider (22% of Medicare patients,\n60% of Medicaid, and 47% of privately insured patients),\nand because the intervention targeted the uninsured as well\nas insured patients without a PCP. All ED visits of study\npatients during the study period were included in the study.\nDue to distinct and independent patient registration sys-\ntems at the clinic and hospital, there was no way to link clinic\nvisits with specific ED patients except through matching\nname, SSN, and DOB. However, emergency service users are\nknown to provide inaccurate SSN/DOB. One study reported a\n66.6% discrepancy between SSNs documented by emergency\nmedical service providers versus hospital-recorded SSNs\namong acute chest pain patients, compared with a discrep-\nsame patients.10 Reluctance to provide accurate SSN is widely\nthought to be due to patient concerns about billing department\nfollow-up for dues collection, especially among poor or unin-\nsured patients. (Anecdotally, inaccurate SSN or refusal to\nprovide an SSN was also a frequent experience at this clinic.)\nTriangulation of the clinic patient data with the hospital inpa-\ntient and ED billing databases to correct SSN/DOB errors (as\ndone with ED billing data) could not be accomplished.\nWe defined high-users as patients with 3 or more ED vis-\nits in a continuous 12-month period. The state of South\nCarolina's Department of Health and Human Services\ndefines high-users as those making 3 or more visits in a year,\nasking hospitals to use this definition to monitor ED utiliza-\ntion in an effort to minimize the overall health system cost,\npart of which is reimbursed by the State through\nDisproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments. We\nfound this definition to satisfy the recommendation of the\nresearch literature that high-users being targeted for inter-\nventions should account for at least 25% of total visits to\nproduce a meaningful impact on ED volumes.11 In the prein-\ntervention period, our high-user definition attributed 47.5%\nof total ED visits to high-users. Other studies have also used\nthis definition.12 We identified preintervention high-users as\nfollows. For patients with an ED visit during the preinter-\nvention period, their visits during the year before the calen-\ndar start date of the preintervention period (August 16,\nlytic dataset to flag high-users who would qualify as high-\nusers based on their visits in the months adjacent to the\ncalendar duration of the preintervention period. This pre-\nempts misclassification bias due to the calendar limits of the\nstudy period. Similarly, to flag new high-users of the pos-\ntintervention period, we used visits during August 16,\nervention period). However, after identifying high-users of\nthe 2 periods, visits were used for analysis only if they\noccurred in the calendar period of study. Visits that occurred\nbefore the study period were excluded from analysis. Study\nperiod visits were assigned to the pre- or post-period as\napplicable. Patients other than high-users were defined as\n\"occasional users.\"\nWe chose to study 2 preintervention years to avoid biased\nresults from a single, potentially outlier year (eg, preinterven-\ntion year). We limited it to 2 years to minimize cohort matura-\ntion bias due to disease evolution among comorbid patients.\nWe selected 3 years for the postintervention period to allow\nadequate time for the 2-year cohort of preintervention patients\nto visit the ED postintervention, potentially receive a primary\ncare referral, and then manifest changes in their ED use\nbehavior. Despite imbalanced pre- and postintervention peri-\nods, we ensure comparable measures by using the average\nannual patient visit rate in each period, and averaging the\nemergency severity across a patient's visits in each period.\nMeasures\nAt the hospital level, we compared preintervention versus\npostintervention ED patient volumes, total, high-users, and\noccasional users.We define emergency severity as the patient's\ndischarge emergency severity index (ESI), a calculated mea-\nsure that adjusts the nurse-triaged AHRQ ESI score with the\nTable 1.

ESI is a calculated discharge ESI in the billing database. The original AHRQ ESI score is the initial triaged status 1-5, higher score indicating lower\nseverity. In this hospital, the ESI is revised to reflect true emergency and clinical severity by calculating it at discharge, based on final diagnosis, resources\nused to treat, and discharge disposition. The documented ESI is also reverse coded (relative to the AHRQ scale) to align with the billing convention,\nhigher ESI = higher severity. ED = emergency department; ESI = emergency severity index; AHRQ = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\naThese visits by 1-time users admitted as inpatients are excluded from the study, given that the intervention was designed to reduce avoidable ED visits\nthat are remediable by primary care. These patients had no other ED visit in the study period, were not targeted by the intervention, and not amenable\nfor study of subsequent behavior.\n*P < .01 for pre-post difference. Race and insurance were statistically significant, but not highlighted due to negligible magnitude of difference.\nTsai et al 5\nresources used to treat (total charges), and their discharge\ndisposition. The calculation is based on an internal hospital\nalgorithm and uses the AHRQ categories of severity but\nreverse coded, so that increasing score represents higher\nseverity to align with the hospital billing convention (5 =\nlife-threatening, 4 = emergent, 3 = urgent, 2 = nonurgent, 1 =\nfast track).13 A calculated ESI approach (in contrast to initial\nnurse-triaged score) is consistent with the prevailing consen-\nsus that the initial triaged ESI has poor replicability and pre-\ndictive validity for outcomes, largely because subsequent\ndiagnostic assessments and treatments are highly variable\nrelative to the initial, symptom-based triage.14\nPatient-level mean annual visit rates and mean ESI scores\nwere aggregated across the total ED population in each\nperiod, grouping patients as high-users and occasional users.\nWe hypothesized that longitudinally tracked high-users'\nannual visit rates would decline following the intervention,\nand mean ESI would increase due to fewer low-severity vis-\nits. For preintervention high-users, we compared these mea-\nsures pre- versus postintervention, both overall, and classified\ninto quartiles based on mean annual visit frequency.\nPreintervention high-users were also compared with preinter-\nvention occasional users. Returning high-users were com-\npared with new high-users of the postintervention period.\nFinally, we classified preintervention high-users into severity\nquartiles based on their preintervention average severity, and\ncompared each quartile's pre- versus post-mean severity.\nWe assigned serious comorbidity to the patients if, at any\npreintervention visit, their primary or secondary diagnoses\n(up to 3) showed one of 10 serious conditions (HIV and the 9\nDartmouth conditions--serious malignant or metastatic can-\ncer, chronic pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease,\nsevere congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease,\nsevere chronic liver disease, diabetes with end-organ damage,\nrenal failure, dementia). The Dartmouth comorbidities are\nvalidated predictors of in-hospital mortality and inpatient care\nintensity.15 We also identified the presence of ambulatory care\nsensitive conditions (ACSCs; 24 conditions, see supplemen-\ntary appendix). Because these are chronic conditions, a given\npatient was assigned the comorbidity/ACSC to all their visits.\nAnalyses were performed using SAS version 9.4.\nResults\ndue to missing patient identifying information.

Of preintervention patients, 77.4%\n1 or more ED visits, and 25.4% were high-users who\naccounted for 47.5% of all preintervention visits. Prevalence\nof serious comorbidity was 19% and ACSC, 27.2%, total\nzip code or adjacent zip codes. Preintervention, the mean\nannual visit rate per patient was 1.91 (\u00b12.37), and mean ESI\npatients were high-users (22.4%), the mean annual visit rate\nwas lower, and ESI score was higher (all P < .001). Serious\ncomorbidity and ACSC rates were similar in the pre- and\npostintervention periods.\nTable 2 presents the pre- versus postintervention, mean\nvisit rates and mean ESI scores of preintervention high-users\n(Section A) and occasional users (Section B). Each group\nwas classified into quartiles based on their preintervention\nmean annual visit rate. A large number of high-users had a\nvisit rate equal to the quartile cutoff frequencies; we assigned\nall these patients to the quartile below the cutoff point (con-\nsistent with the definition of percentile values). The lowest\nand top quartile values, preintervention, were 0.94 and 5.43,\nrespectively (highest value for an individual patient was\n27.5). About 41.7% did not visit the ED in the postinterven-\ntion period and are excluded from the denominators for pos-\ntintervention visit rates and severity calculations. Across\nreturning high-users, their mean annual visit rate was 7.3%\nlower than the mean visit rate of all high-users before the\nreductions postintervention were noted in every quartile\n(mean visit rates were 1.11-1.72; and the highest individual\nannual visit rate fell to 14.0).

The lower 3 quartiles of occasional users had to be\npooled (all these patients had only 1 visit in the preinterven-\ntion period). A smaller change in mean severity is observed\nwith a slight increase in mean visit rate (0.5 vs 0.6). Overall,\nthe top quartile and the lower quartiles of occasional users\nconverged to one common profile in the postintervention\nTable 3 presents the postintervention period comparison\nof new high-users with returning high-users. For new high-\nusers, the lowest quartile and top quartile values were 0.6\nand 3.23 visits, respectively. These values are higher than\nthe corresponding values for returning high-users (1.11 and\n3.21, respectively), but lower than those of preintervention\nrespectively). In the postintervention period, visit rates of\nnew high-users and returning high-users show similarity\namong the lower quartiles (0.60 for quartiles 1 and 2 com-\nbined vs 1.11 and 1.45 for the first and second quartiles of\nreturning high-users). The latter's corresponding rates in the\npreintervention period were 0.94 and 2.0, respectively.

Upon reviewing the\npreintervention period ESI of high-users (Table 2) against\nthe postintervention mean ESI of returning high-users and\nnew high-users (Table 3), all quartiles show higher ESI lev-\nels in the postintervention period.\nA subgroup analysis was performed of preintervention\nhigh-users of working age 18 to 64 years. They were classi-\nfied by insurance status (insured, including private and gov-\nernment sources) and uninsured, and the results are shown in\nSupplemental Table 2 in the supplementary materials.\nSimilar to the main analysis, uninsured high-users tracked\ninto the postintervention period also showed substantial and\nstatistically significant reductions in annual visit rates, con-\ncurrent with an increase in emergency severity. Insured\nworking-age high-users showed an increase in emergency\nseverity but no change in the visit rate. Postintervention, a\nconvergence of mean visit rates of uninsured and insured\nhigh-user groups is also observed.\nWe also studied preintervention high-users classified into\nquartiles by their mean ESI score in the preintervention\nperiod (table presented in supplemental materials). The low-\nest severity quartile showed the highest postintervention\nThe mean ESI decreased among the upper quartiles of sever-\nity. Mean ESI of the top quartile (4.66, which is close to the\n\"life-threatening\" score, 5.0) declined to 4.09. The mean ESI\nof the next quartile (3.93, almost at the \"emergent\" level of\n4.0) also declined to 3.76. It is notable that the above changes\noccurred despite similar rates of serious comorbidity and\nACSCs among the preintervention and postintervention ED\npatients (Table 1).\nDiscussion\nFollowing the primary care access intervention, we observed\na large reduction in ED visit rates of both high-users and\nhigher end occasional users. The reductions were sustained\neven when the analysis was restricted to uninsured working-\nage patients, showing substantial changes in visit rates and\nseverity among uninsured high-users tracked through the pos-\ntintervention period, compared with the modest or no change\nobserved among tracked insured high-users. The visit volume\nreductions of the uninsured occurred concurrent with increas-\ning emergency severity of visits. The study intervention con-\nsisted of 2 components.

Lowest quartile has a mean annual visit frequency of 0.94 due to visits outside the calendar\nyears of the study period that were used to flag high-user status, 3 visits during any 12 consecutive months. Visits outside calendar period of study were excluded, causing the minimum annual visit rate\nof 0.5 per year for high-user patients. Cutoff point between Quartile 4 and the lower is 0.5 for occasional users, respectively. Quartiles 1 to 3 are pooled due to 12 933 patients having only 1 visit in the\npreintervention period, that is, annual visit rate = 0.5.\nbESI range for occasional users is 1.0 to 5.0 for both groups.\n*P < .01 for pre-post difference.\ncare access, on-campus, to poor uninsured ED patients, pri-\noritizing ED high-users and chronic disease patients, supple-\nmented by 24/7 phone access to primary care doctors, was\nprovided. For insured patients who were high-users or chronic\ndisease patients, an educational conversation on the impor-\ntance of regularly using a primary care doctor was provided at\na \"teachable moment,\" when the patient has just survived a\nscary, possibly life-threatening episode. Given the broad\nscope of the intervention, this evaluation study included ED\npatients with all types of payers: Medicare, Medicaid, private\ninsurance, and the uninsured. Medicare beneficiaries are doc-\numented to have a usual source of care (>95%).16 However,\n26% to 35% of beneficiaries use a specialist as their usual\nsource of care, and they are more likely to be the highest-cost\nbeneficiaries, compared with PCP users.16 In this study, 22%\nof Medicare ED patients, 60% of Medicaid, and 47% of pri-\nvately insured patients did not have a primary care provider as\nreported at their first ED visit.\nWhile 41.7% of high-users did not return to the ED pos-\ntintervention, among returning high-users, there were dra-\nmatic reductions in the annual visit frequency within every\nquartile (by 28%-68%). The 3-year duration of the postinter-\nvention period provided adequate time for the primary care\nintervention to be availed as and when a patient returned to\nthe ED, and for patients to manifest a change in their ED use\npatterns. This may mitigate the likelihood of spurious find-\nings due to chance. A definitive, intervention impact is sup-\nported by the concurrent increase in the discharge ESI,\naveraged over this large high-user cohort. Furthermore, the\ndifferentiation of severity changes between patient quartiles\nclassified on severity is notable--a dramatic increase in ESI\namong the lowest severity patients, and clinically salient\nseverity reductions among the emergent and life-threatening\nseverity quartiles to lower severity levels (see supplemental\nmaterials). (The opposite directions of effect among the low-\nand high-severity quartiles explain the modest (0.10) increase\nin average severity across all high-users, shown in Table 2.) A\nnote of caution, however, is appropriate. The ESI scale as\ncomputed by this hospital is not empirically validated for pre-\ndictive accuracy. The original AHRQ ESI scale was designed\nto capture initial, nurse-triaged severity of a patient before\ndiagnostic investigations are done to finalize the diagnoses\nand treatment needs, and is therefore, more a measure of\nsymptomatic emergent severity rather than true disease state\nemergent severity. At this hospital, the concern regarding the\nseverity validity of the original AHRQ ESI is mitigated\nbecause the ESI is calculated with an algorithm that uses\n\ninitial triage, resources used to treat patient outcome.\nIntuitively, this method is superior to the AHRQ ESI scale,\nbecause it captures the true emergent status of the patient by\ndifferentiating symptom-driven emergencies versus\n\nlife-threatening conditions. However, the hospital's algorithm\nis proprietary (used across hospitals owned by the parent\n\nmissionary group), not validated by empirical research.\nA true primary care impact would be best verified by\nidentifying ED patients who visited the free clinic and those\nwho acquired an office-based PCP to study their ED use\nchanges. The former proved logistically impossible due to\nunlinkable clinic IT and hospital EMR systems. No data are\navailable to quantify the latter. The free clinic registered\nsured patients.\nThe decline in preintervention high-users'visit rates could\nbe argued as a secular, natural regression from sporadic high\nED use caused by transient medical exacerbations. With sta-\nbilization of their medical condition, these patients should\nregress to the mean pattern of the local population. Two find-\nings mitigate this explanation. First, if the historic high-\nusers'visit reductions were due to this effect, new high-users\nshould repeat the historic visit rates and severity levels of the\npreintervention period, which is not the case. On the con-\ntrary, their visit rates are much lower than the historic rates of\nTable 3.

Q1 and Q2 are pooled because 50% of the sample had a mean annual\n*P < .05 for new high-users versus preintervention high-users.\nTsai et al 9\npreintervention high-users in the preintervention period.\nNotably in the postintervention period, new high-users and\nreturning high-users show convergence of both visit rates\nand ESI levels among the lower quartiles of visit frequency.\nSerious comorbidity and ACSC prevalence rates were simi-\nlar among the pre- and postintervention groups of ED patients\n(Table 1). Collectively, the findings suggest that more\npatients may have used primary care, resulting in less need\nfor ED visits, and when they used the ED, it was more appro-\npriate, for emergent needs. Also supporting an intervention\neffect is the similar direction of change, although of lower\nmagnitude among higher-end occasional users. The top quar-\ntile of occasional users (containing a large number of patients\nwho fell short of the 3-visits-in-12-months criterion) showed\nlarge postintervention changes (a 75% decrease in visit fre-\nquency), and an increase in mean ESI score to similar levels\nas those of the lower quartiles of returning high-users.\nThe pattern of visit rate declines among high-users is rein-\nforced by the observed longitudinal changes in visit ESI\namong patients of different severity levels. When preinter-\nvention high-users were classified on emergency severity,\nthe lowest severity quartile, accounting for the largest frac-\ntion of preintervention high-users (39.1%), showed a 25%\nESI increase in their postintervention visits. Concurrently,\nthe higher severity patients (with emergent and life-threaten-\ning range of ESI) showed ESI reductions toward less life-\nthreatening levels. The combination of visit rates and ESI\nchanges in these longitudinally tracked patients supports a\nprimary care impact. Potentially, the observed increase in\nESI could be argued as a manifestation of disease evolution\nof chronically comorbid patients. If such was the case, one\nwould expect a concurrent increase in the visit rate.\nAdvancing chronic disease should cause more ED visits (for\nvarious complications) and more severe visits. On the con-\ntrary, we find a much-reduced visit rate by the same high-\nusers, postintervention, concurrent with increased severity\namong the lower ESI quartiles, and reduced severity among\nthe highest ESI quartiles.\nThe postintervention increase of emergency severity\namong low-severity patients and a decrease among high-\nseverity patients validate the normative expectations from\nthis primary care intervention. Primary care is the first level\nof contact with the health care system. The study hospital's\nintervention was carefully crafted and executed to ensure a\nprimary care medical home environment, continuity of pro-\nviders (who were full-time and salaried), collaborative\nchronic disease management activities, care coordination,\nalmost free access to accessory care needs such as specialist\ncare, diagnostic and imaging services, and prescription\ndrugs. This approach would be expected to help patients to\nmitigate or eliminate acute exacerbations through proactive\nchronic disease management, and may have helped patients\nto substitute ED use with primary care office visits for some\nlow-severity episodes. Among patients with emergent and\nlife-threatening severity preintervention, primary care may\nhave reduced the likelihood and severity of complications of\ntheir chronic disease, or provided a medical home for early\ntreatment of exacerbations before the condition became\nemergent. The collective internal consistency of findings\nacross multiple subgroups of this ED population mitigates\nsome of the methodological limitations, which, however,\ncannot be ruled out as potential explanatory factors. One\nmethodological limitation of the study is the group-level\nanalysis. However, individual, subject-based analysis\nrequires accounting for medical diagnoses, which in turn\nrequires a consolidation schema to group disparate diagnoses\ninto a usable medical status variable for statistical analysis.\nSuch an effort is beyond the scope of this study. Second, we\nare unable to identify ED patients who used the clinic. Up to\n67% of SSNs in emergency service system databases may be\ninaccurate.10 Anecdotal experiences at the study clinic con-\nfirm this issue.\nAnother major limitation is the absence of data on patient\nvisits to other EDs in the area. The presence of 2 hospitals in\nthe region (3 and 8 miles away, respectively) may give pause\nabout offsetting visits to those hospital EDs that may partly\naccount for the volume reduction at this ED. Both hospitals\npose significant logistic deterrents to neighborhood patients.\nThe teaching hospital ED had a community-wide reputation\nfor very long waiting times for all but life-threatening and\nemergent patients. The second ED, located in an adjacent\ncounty, is quite distant from the study hospital's patient\nsource neighborhoods, a key factor in a city with limited\npublic transportation, with no buses operating in the direc-\ntion of the second hospital. Furthermore, the study hospital\nand its ED are focused on specialized services such as mater-\nnity and pediatrics, services that are not targeted by the study\nhospital. Countering the expected natural response of high-\nusers to disperse their ED visits across hospitals, is the reli-\ngious mission of the study hospital, which translated into\nmanagement's expectation that hospital staff adhere to the\nkey creed, including an accepting attitude toward the indi-\ngent. The hospital's hinterland is a low-income, minority-\ndominated neighborhood with poor transportation options.\nTherefore, it is likely that this study limitation is mitigated by\nthe above factors.\nThe study overcomes several limitations of previous\nstudies that showed disparate findings. Some cross-sec-\ntional studies and patient surveys showed that primary care\naccess was associated with fewer ED visits, while others\nshow the opposite. Supportive evidence largely consisted\nof cross-sectional, population-based survey data, compar-\ning self-reported ED use by respondents with and without\nprimary care access, or comparing the self-reported pri-\nmary care access of persons reporting ED use versus non-\nuse.17-22 Other cross-sectional studies report higher ED use\nby persons having a primary care provider.23-26 Notably,\nthese studies do not account for medically substantiated\nemergency severity. In the current study, our measure of\ndischarge ESI (based on staff-triaged severity, resources\nused to treat, and final discharge disposition) represents\nmedically robust severity and urgency representation, com-\npared with patient-perceived need for ED care that is cap-\ntured in cross-sectional surveys.\nOne cross-sectional study examined the likelihood of\nlow-emergency visits to the ED by patients enrolled at one\nof 4 free-standing free clinics versus unenrolled ED\npatients at 4 hospitals in Virginia. The study reported\nreduced likelihood of a low-emergency visit by free clinic\nusers, but no difference in the likelihood of an avoidable,\nprimary care\u00adamenable visit.20 Acknowledged study limi-\ntations were the cross-sectional nature of the study, lack of\ninformation on the composition of each free clinic's ser-\nvices, nature and continuity of medical providers, pro-\ncesses (if any) for care continuity, care coordination and\nchronic disease self-management (the essential elements\nof primary care), and the presence of a primary care medi-\ncal home environment. As acknowledged in the paper,\nmost free clinics depend on an uncertain roster of volun-\nteer physicians based on availability of spare time. As\nsuch, it is difficult to expect that avoidable ED visits (that\nare primary care\u00adamenable and preventable) would be\nreduced by the typical free clinic. Possibly due to this\nissue, the study showed no association of free clinic enroll-\nment with avoidable visits. Their study also did not exam-\nine associations with ED visit volumes of the study\npatients. ED visit volumes are a critical issue for hospitals.\nAs such, the significance of findings for policy-making\nremains limited.\nOur study addresses several limitations of the above\nstudy, notably, (1) offering a longitudinal study of the ED\npopulation; (2) tracking individual patients' ED use pat-\nterns before and after implementation of the intervention to\nexamine utilization changes by user type; (3) studying a\nhospital-funded, on-campus primary care clinic which\nensured prompt patient acceptance into primary care; (4) a\nclinic with a systematic approach to care continuity and\ncare coordination implemented by salaried medical and\nancillary providers offering dependable provider availabil-\nity; and (5) a systematized approach to facilitate real access\nto ancillary medical services (pharmaceuticals, laboratory,\nand imaging services) that are critical to make a primary\ncare intervention meaningful for the goal of reducing avoid-\nable medical care.\nLongitudinal cohort studies are critical to study ED use\nchanges within nested subgroups. Crude, before-after vol-\nume comparisons are deceptive, due to the complex and\ndynamic composition of the ED population. High-users of\na given year may remain high-users, or become low-users/\nnonusers due to complex reasons: health status changes (eg,\nchronic disease deterioration, resolution of acute exacerba-\ntions, new complications, death), insurance changes,\nacquiring a PCP, and patient preferences (eg, convenience\nof a snap visit to the ED vs scheduling an office visit).\nThese dynamics of returning high-users are constantly\nbeing churned by new high-users from the community who\nwill cycle through these processes. Secondary data sources\n(eg, the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP)\nnation-wide hospital discharge database) cannot accommo-\ndate patient tracking beyond a calendar year. Moreover,\nmissing or misreported SSN and DOB (reportedly more\nlikely by high-users) result in significant patient exclusions\nin HCUP data\u00addriven studies. Triangulation of claims data\nwith internal hospital databases is critical; our sample\nexclusions were reduced from 7.6% to 2.7% by such\ntriangulation.\nFew longitudinal interventional studies are docu-\nmented. A 42-hospital collaborative used process reengi-\nneering to reduce ED waiting times, but it did not target\nthe medical care content.27 In another study, ED staff\nreferred 965 consenting, nonemergent ED patients with-\nout a personal physician to the in-hospital primary care\nclinic. Of them, 50% visited the clinic versus 39% of con-\ntrol patients, with no subsequent difference in ED use.28\nIndigent ED patients who were generically referred to\nlocal safety-net clinics showed no change in their ED visit\nrates.29 Reduced ED use was reported when uninsured\npatients were provided an insurance plan requiring adher-\nence to one PCP.30 Patients of primary care practices\ntransformed into primary care medical homes used the ED\nless than comparison practice patients.31 Overall, the evi-\ndence supports that a definitive assumption of primary\ncare responsibility by an entity offering dependable clinic\nhours, and implementing key primary care principles may\nbe the key to success.\nIn addition to the limitations noted earlier, other limita-\ntions include retrospective, single-hospital study, lack of data\non after-hours teleconsultations, and not accounting for 2\nration. Bias due to the economic recession is partly mitigated\nby similar time trends of the study hospital's ED volumes to\nthose of South Carolina and the neighboring states.32,33 One\nunmeasured source of bias remains: policy changes at the\nnational, state, or local level.\nDisease maturation and new comorbidities that arose pos-\ntintervention may underestimate the primary care impact,\nbecause they would necessitate more, not less ED visits. We\nobserve a significant decline in visit rates. Our study, there-\nfore, potentially underestimates the visit rate reduction\nattributable to the primary care intervention. Generalizability\nto other hospitals may be a concern, although mitigated by\nthe study hospital's similarity to the typical, urban hospital\non many indicators: ED patient-to-visit ratio of 1:1.6 (1:1.9\namong nonteaching hospitals, and 1:1.6 at a teaching\nadmission (14.7% nationally for adult and pediatric visits\nOverall, the study findings support proactive, well-organized\nprimary care interventions as a strategy to reduce avoidable\nED visits.\n"
