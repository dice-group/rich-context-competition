Data for the current report were\ngathered through online questionnaires completed by 78 ado-\nlescent offspring (39 girls and 39 boys). The adolescents were\naskediftheyhadeverbeenabusedand,ifso,tospecifybywhom\nand the type of abuse (verbal, emotional, physical, or sexual).\nThey were also asked to specify their sexual identity on the\nKinseyscale,betweenexclusivelyheterosexualandexclusively\nhomosexual. Lifetime sexual behavior was assessed through\nquestions about heterosexual and same-sex contact, age of first\nsexual experience, contraception use,and pregnancy.The results\nrevealed that there were no reports of physical or sexual vic-\ntimizationbyaparentorothercaregiver.Regardingsexualorien-\ntation, 18.9% of the adolescent girls and 2.7% of the adolescent\nboys self-rated in the bisexual spectrum, and 0% of girls and\n5.4% of boys self-rated as predominantly-to-exclusively homo-\nsexual. When compared with age- and gender-matched adoles-\ncents of the National Survey of Family Growth, the study off-\nspringweresignificantlyolderatthetimeoftheirfirstheterosex-\nual contact, and the daughters of lesbian mothers were signifi-\ncantly more likely to have had same-sex contact. These findings\nsuggest that adolescents reared in lesbian families are less likely\nthan their peers to be victimized by a parent or other caregiver,\nandthatdaughtersoflesbianmothersaremorelikelytoengagein\nsame-sex behavior and to identify as bisexual.\n",

Extrapolating from these\nfindings, researchers have theorized that lesbian and gay par-\nents may have a higher proportion of biologic lesbian or gay\noffspring as a result of shared genetic material (Goldberg,\n2010). In terms of hormonal factors, high maternal levels of\nandrogens during pregnancy have been associated with more\nsame-sex attraction in offspring (Hines, Brook, & Conway,\n2004). Among possible environmental influences, growing up\nin a same-sex parent household may broaden offspring's\nconsiderationofpossiblesexualidentitiesbecause lesbian and\ngay parents are less likely to stigmatize same-sex attraction\nand relationships, and they are more likely to discuss issues\nrelatedtosexualitywiththeiroffspring(Bos&Sandfort,2010;\n2010) theorize, the adolescent offspring of same-sex parents\nmay be more comfortable exploring homoerotic attractions\nthanyouthwhogrowupinheterosexualhouseholdsbecauseof\nthe social environment created by their parents.\nAnother claim about the origins of sexual orientation that\nhas been put forth in litigation and public discourse by oppo-\nnents of equality in marriage, adoption, and foster care for\nsame-sex couples is that lesbian and gay parents are more\nlikely to abuse their children sexually (Arkansas Department\nin turn, result in their offspring identifying as lesbian or gay\nthemselves (Biblarz & Stacey, 2010; Committee on Lesbian,\nGay, and Bisexual Concerns, Committee on Children, Youth,\nand Families, Committee on Women in Psychology, 2005;\ninvestigatedintrafamilialsexualabuseofadolescentsrearedin\nplanned same-sex parent households, a growing body of\nresearch has found that lesbian and gay adults, most of whom\ngrew up in heterosexual households, report higher rates of\nchildhood sexual victimization than their heterosexual peers\n(Balsam,Lehavot,Beadnell,&Circo,2010;Balsam,Rothblum,\nthese studiesreportinga correlationbetween childhood sexual\nabuse and adult same-sex attraction and/or behavior urge\ncaution in the interpretations of their findings, suggesting that\na child's same-sex attraction could have preceded the abuse\nor that young children who demonstrate same-sex attraction\nmay be specifically targeted for abuse (Balsam et al., 2005;\nAlthough the sexual orientation and behavior of adoles-\ncents and adults reared by same-sex couples has garnered\nconsiderableattentioninresearchandpublicpolicy(Arkansas\nDepartment of Human Services, 2010; Supreme Court of\nIowa, 2009; United States District Court Northern District of\nCalifornia San Francisco Division, 2010), the only data on the\nsexual preferences and experiences of the offspring of lesbian\nmothers come from two empirical studies of young adults\nGolombok,Tasker,&Murray,1997;MacCallum&Golombok,\nThe first report on the sexual orientation of adults who had\nbeen reared by lesbian mothers was based on data collected in\noffspring (17 women and eight men) of lesbian mothers and\n21 adult offspring (nine women and 12 men) of heterosexual\nmothers were interviewed. This study was a follow-up to a sur-\nfamilies, the offspring had been conceived in heterosexual\nrelationships before their mothers divorced and identified as\nlesbian. The average age of the adult offspring in the follow-up\nstudy was 23.5years. Golombok and Tasker found no signifi-\ncant differences between the groups of lesbian- and heterosex-\nual-parented offspring in the percentage who self-identified\nas lesbian or gay or in reports of sexual attraction. Golombok\nand Tasker did, however, find that six of the young adults (five\nfemales and one male) raised by lesbian parents reported a\nsexualexperiencewithsomeoneofthesamegender,whilenone\nof the young adults raised by heterosexual mothers did. Addi-\ntionally, only the adult daughters (and no adult sons) of lesbians\nexpressed a significantly greater openness to the idea of same-\nsex attraction in the future.\nInasecondBritishstudy,plannedlesbianfamilieswerecom-\npared with solo heterosexual mother families and two-parent\nheterosexual families (Golombok & Badger, 2010; Golombok\nmothers identified as lesbian before the birth of the child\nenrolledinthisstudy.Thefirstinterviewstookplacewhenthese\noffspring were, on average, 6years of age.

In a recent study of planned lesbian\nfamilies in the Netherlands, Bos and Sandfort (2010) com-\npared the offspring, ranging in age from 8 to 12years, from 63\nplanned lesbian families to the offspring from 68 heterosexual\nfamilies.Thechildrenoflesbianmotherswerelesscertainabout\nthe prospect of future heterosexual involvement. This finding\ndoes not necessarily equate with future sexual orientation or\nbehavior, but it fits with the theory proposed by Biblarz and\npresentedinGolomboket al. (1997) that childrengrowingupin\nlesbian-parent households may be more open to the possibility\nof same-sex relationships in the future.\nThe U.S. National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study\n(NLLFS) provides an opportunity to fill gaps in the literature\nabout the offspring of planned lesbian families. The NLLFS\nwasinitiatedin1986toprovideprospective data ona cohortof\nlesbian families from the time the children were conceived\nuntil they reach adulthood. The first NLLFS interview (T1)\n(Gartrell et al., 1996), conducted with inseminating or preg-\nnant prospective mothers, found that the children were highly\ndesired. The study participants, who were completely open\nabout being lesbian, hoped that their families of origin would\nwelcome the child even though some family members had\nconcerns about children being raised by lesbians. The second\ninterview (T2) (Gartrell et al., 1999) took place when the\nNLLFS children were 2-years-old. Child-rearing responsi-\nbilities were typically shared in two-mother households. Most\nchildrenhadacceptinggrandparentswhohadbecomecloserto\nthe family since the child's birth. At T3 (Gartrell et al., 2000),\nthe 5-year-old index children were reported to be healthy,\nwell-adjusted, and relating well to peers. The NLLFS families\nwere integrated into their neighborhoods and participating in\nthe lesbian community. When the NLLFS offspring were 10\nstandardized tests completed by their mothers revealed that\ntheir offspring had no higher incidence of psychological or\ndevelopmental problems than age-matched peers in the com-\nparison samples. Also at T4, the NLLFS mothers reported that\nnone of their offspring had been physically or sexually abused\nby a parent or other caregiver (Gartrell, Rodas, Deck, Peyser,\nThe first goal of the current investigation was to survey the\n17-year-old NLLFS offspring about their sexual orientation,\nsexual behavior, and sexual risk exposure. The second goal\nwas to compare the sexual behaviorof the NLLFSadolescents\nwiththe sexualbehavior reportedbyage-matched adolescents\nin national probability samples.\nMethod\nParticipants\nas part of the NLLFS, an ongoing longitudinal study of 84\nretention rate to date.

Lifetime sexual\nbehavior was assessed through items focusing on heterosexual\nand same-sex contact, age of first sexual experience, contracep-\ntion use, and pregnancy (for specific questions, see Table2).\nData Analysis\nFor the victimization self-reports and the Kinsey self-ratings,\nsimple frequencies were calculated. In comparing the sexual\nbehavior of NLLFS adolescent girls and boys, chi-square\nanalyses were conducted for discrete variables and t-tests for\ncontinuous measures.\nTo compare sexual behavior in the NLLFS adolescent\nsample with a national probability sample, the 6th Cycle of the\nNSFG was used (see Table 2) (U.S. Department of Health and\ntoensure thatthesample wassimilar totheUnitedStatespopu-\nlation in terms of gender, age, and race/ethnicity.

Cross-\ntabulations and chi-square analyses were used to compare the\n17-year-old NLLFS participants with the age-matched NSFG\ngroup (weighted data) on: (1) heterosexual contact, same-sex\ncontact, and the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections\n(separately for adolescent girls and boys); (2) contraception\nandpregnancy(onlyforadolescentgirls);and(3)impregnation\n(only for adolescent boys).

The\nNLLFS adolescent girls were also more likely than the age-\nmatched NSFG girls to have engaged in same-sex activity.\nAmong17-year-oldNLLFSadolescentboys,2.7%self-identi-\nfied in the bisexual spectrum, and 5.4% as predominantly or\nexclusivelyhomosexual.However,theNLLFSadolescentboys\nwere no more likely to have engaged in same-sex behavior than\nwere the boys in the NSFG sample.\nThe NLLFS adolescent girls' Kinsey self-identifications\nand lifetime sexual experiences were consistent with Stacey\nthat the offspring of lesbian and gay parents might be more\nopen to homoerotic exploration and same-sex orientation.\nAlthough the Golombok and Tasker (1996) study found no\nsignificant differences in the percentages of adults reared in\nlesbian and heterosexual households who reported same-sex\nattraction or orientation, the offspring of lesbian mothers were\nmore likely to have engaged in same-sex behavior and to have\ngrownupinhouseholdscharacterizedbyacceptanceoflesbian\nand gay relationships (Golombok & Tasker, 1996; Tasker &\nGolombok, 1995).

The next NLLFS follow-\nup--at T6, when the offspring are 25years old--will assess the\nstability of their sexual behavior and orientation over time.\nThe finding that the NLLFS sample was older than the\nNSFG sample at the time of first heterosexual experience may\nbeassociatedwiththe absenceofpregnanciesandSTIsamong\nsexually-active NLLFS adolescents. Research suggests that\nthe timing of heterosexual intercourse and the pace at which\nadolescents progress to more intimate behaviors are related to\nhealth outcomes (Cavazos-Rehg et al., 2008; de Graaf, Van-\nwesenbeeck, Meijer, Woertman, & Meeus, 2009). It is note-\nworthy that among the sexually active adolescent girls, even\nthoughmoreoftheNSFGsamplethantheNLLFSsampleused\ncontraception, 18.2% (weighted data) of the sexually active\nNSFG girls had been pregnant. None of the NLLFS girls\nreported pregnancy, possibly due to their greater reliance on\nemergency contraception. The difference in the methods of\ncontraception chosen by the two samples could be explained\nbynumerousfactors,includingeconomicresourcesandparen-\ntal, peer, and school support.\nThe rate of parental relationship dissolution was signifi-\ncantly higher in the NLLFS than in the NSFG. Although the\noffspring of divorced heterosexual parents have been shown to\nscore lower on measures of emotional, academic, social, and\nferences in psychological adjustment were found when the\n17-year-old NLLFS adolescents whose mothers had separated\nwere compared with those whose mothers were still together\n(Gartrell & Bos, 2010). In addition, on the standardized Child\nBehavior Checklist, the daughters and sons of lesbian mothers\nwere rated significantly higher in social, school/academic, and\ntotal competence, and significantly lower in social problems,\nrule-breaking, aggressive, and externalizing problem behavior\nthan their peers in the normative sample of American youth\nheterosexual mothers retain sole physical and legal custody of\ntheirchildren(Emery,Otto,&O'Donohue,2005),custodywas\nshared in nearly three-quarters of the NLLFS separated-parent\nfamilies. Studies show that shared childrearing after parental\nrelationship dissolution is associated with more favorable out-\ncomes (Emery, 1994, in press). Consistent with the favorable\npsychological profiles of the NLLFS 17-year-olds, there were\nno reports of pregnancy or STIs among these offspring.\nA strength of the NLLFS is that it is a prospective study, so\nthe findings are not skewed by overrepresentation of families\nwho volunteer when it is already clear that their offspring are\nfunctioningwell.Inaddition,thedropoutratewasverysmall.In\nmostcases,thefamiliesthatwithdrewdidsowhentheindexchil-\ndren were less than 5 years old (Gartrell & Bos, 2010; Gartrell\nconfidential adolescent self-reports, thereby increasing the like-\nlihood of candid responses on sensitive topics, such as sexuality\nand victimization. Because the NLLFS is an ongoing longitu-\ndinal study, it is possible to assess consistency in behavior at\ndifferent time intervals. In the current investigation, adolescents\nwere only asked to provide information about their sexual iden-\ntity on the Kinsey scale. At T6, the offspring will be asked to\nprovide more detail about sexual identity, fantasy, and behavior\ninrelationtoorientation(Drummond,Bradley,Badali-Peterson,\nDespite these strengths, the NLLFS has several limitations.\nFirst, it is a nonrandom sample. At the time that the NLLFS\nbeganinthemid-1980s,duetothelonghistoryofdiscrimination\nagainst lesbian and gay people, the prospect of recruiting a\nrepresentative sample of planned lesbian families was even\nmore remote than it is today (Bos et al., 2007). A second limi-\ntation is that the NLLFS and NSFG were neither matched nor\ncontrolled for socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, or region of\nresidence. An analysis of a more economically diverse sample\nwouldbeanimportantcontributiongiventhatsame-sexcouples\nraisingchildrenaremorelikelytoliveinpovertyandhavelower\nhousehold incomes than married, heterosexual couples raising\nchildren(Albelda,Badgett,Schneebaum,&Gates,2009;Julien,\nJouvin, Jodoin, l'Archeveque, & Chartrand, 2008). In addition,\nnow that it is possible to obtain more information about sperm\ndonors, future studies might benefit from exploring the associ-\nation between the offspring's sexual orientation and that of both\nparents. Finally, although the NLLFS is the largest, longest-\nrunning prospective study of planned lesbian families, the find-\nings would be strengthened by replication in a larger sample.\nThe present study contributes a unique dimension to the lit-\nerature on same-sex-parented families in reporting on the life-\ntime sexual experiences among 17-year-old adolescents who\nwere conceived by donor insemination and born into planned\nlesbianfamilies.Tothebestofourknowledge,thecurrentinves-\ntigation is the first to document parent/caregiver victimization\nexperiences among adolescents reared by lesbian mothers.\nThere was a noteworthy absence of parental/caregiver physical\nand sexual abuse in the self-reports of adolescents with lesbian\nmothers. Because victimization of children and adolescents is\npervasiveandcancauselastingphysical,mental,andemotional\nharm (Finkelhor et al., 2009a, b, c; U.S. Department of Health\nand Human Services, 2009), a more in-depth exploration of the\nways that lesbian mothers protect their offspring from abuse is\nwarranted. To the extent that these findings are replicated by\nother researchers, these data have implications for healthcare\nprofessionals, policymakers, social service agencies, child pro-\ntection workers, and domestic violence advocates who seek\nfamily models in which violence does not occur.\n"
