The paper examines the\nspeed and timing of these changes; unique components, such as the issue of finding\nboth under- and overnutrition in the same household; potential exacerbating\nbiological relationships that contribute to differences in the rates of change; and\npolitical issues.\nSetting: The focus is on lower- and middle-income countries of Asia, Africa, the\nMiddle East and Latin America.\nResults: These changes are occurring at great speed and at earlier stages of these\ncountries' economic and social development. There are some unique issues that\nrelate to body composition and potential genetic factors. The significance of the high\nnumber of persons exposed to heavy insults during pregnancy and infancy (foetal\norigins hypothesis) and the subsequent rapid shifts in energy imbalance remains to be\nunderstood. Countries that are still addressing major concerns of undernutrition are\nnot ready to address these NR-NCDs.\nConclusions: The developing world needs to give far greater emphasis to addressing\nthe prevention of the adverse health consequences of this shift to the nutrition\ntransition stage of degenerative diseases.\n",

But is the\nexperience related to the rapid onset of obesity and NR-\nNCDs in the lower- and middle-income countries of Asia,\nAfrica, the Middle East, Latin America and Oceana\ndifferent from what occurred in Western European\ncountries, the United States and Japan at a similar stage\nin their economic development? An exploration of the\n`differences' in the speed of the nutrition transition across\nthe globe is beyond the scope of this paper but certainly is\nworthy of future exploration. This paper summarises some\narguments and evidence that lead us to assert that the\nexperience (rapid onset of obesity and NR-NCDs) may be\nunique. Understanding this topic is important for planning\na strategy to prevent obesity and its complications in the\ndeveloping world. In this paper we focus on several ways\nthe conditions in higher-income Western European\ncountries, the USA and Japan differ from those in lower-\nand middle-income countries. Essentially the key asser-\ntions are as follows.\n. The speed of change appears unique due to the timing\nof the economic, technological and social transform-\nations faced by lower- and moderate-income transi-\ntional societies now, and that faced by higher-income\nindustrialised societies decades ago.\n. The unique issue of finding both under- and over-\nnutrition in the same household is indicative of the\ndifferent sets of stresses and societal changes currently\nfacing lower- and moderate-income countries shifting\nto a pattern of NR-NCDs.\n. The differences in the rates of change may be\nexacerbated by some biological relationships.\n.

We use nutrition rather than diet so that the term\nNR-NCD incorporates the effects of diet, physical activity\nand body composition rather than solely focusing on\ndietary patterns and their effects. This is based partially on\nincomplete information that seems to indicate that the\nprevalences of obesity and a number of NR-NCDs are\nincreasing far more quickly in the lower- and middle-\nincome world than they have in the West. Another element\nis that the rapid change in urban populations is much\ngreater than that experienced a century or less ago in the\nWest; yet another is the shift in occupation structure and\nthe rapid introduction of the modern mass media.\nUnderlying such changes is a general concern for rapid\nglobalisation as the root cause.\nClearly, there are quantitative and qualitative dimen-\nsions to these changes. On the one hand, changes towards\na high-density diet, reduced complex carbohydrates and\nother important elements and inactivity may be proceed-\ning faster than in the past. The shift from labour-intensive\noccupations and leisure activities towards more capital-\nintensive, less strenuous work and leisure is also occurring\nfaster. On the other hand, qualitative dimensions related to\nmultidimensional aspects of the diet, activity, body\ncomposition and disease shifts may exist. The social and\neconomic stresses people face and feel as these changes\noccur might also be included.\nAt the start of the new millennium, scholars often feel as\nif the pace and complexity of life, reflected in all aspects of\nwork and play, are increasing exponentially; there are also\nunanticipated developments, new technologies and the\nimpact of a very modern, high-powered communications\nsystem. It is this sense of rapid change that makes it so\nimportant to understand what is happening and anticipate\nthe way changes in patterns of diet, activity and body\ncomposition are occurring. While the penetration and\ninfluence of modern communications, technology and\neconomic systems \u00ad related to what is termed globalisa-\ntion \u00ad have been a dominant theme of the last few\ndecades, there seem to be some unique issues that have\nled to a rapid increase of `globalisation and its impact'.\nPlacing the blame on globalisation is, on the one hand,\nfocusing on a broad and vaguely measured set of forces;\nthis ignores the need to be focused and specific, which\nwould allow us to develop potentially viable policy\noptions. It is difficult to measure each element of this\nglobalisation equation and its impact. These processes\ncertainly have been expanded, as indicated by enhanced\nfree trade, a push towards the reduction of trade barriers in\nthe developing world, and the increasing penetration of\ninternational corporations into the commerce in each\ncountry (measured by share of gross national product\n(GNP) or manufacturing). Similarly, other economic issues\nrelated to enhanced value given to market forces and\ninternational capital markets are important. Equally, the\nincreasing access to Western media and the removal of\ncommunication barriers enhanced by the World Wide\nWeb, cable TV, mobile telephone systems, etc. are\nimportant. The accelerated introduction of Western\ntechnology into manufacturing, the basic sectors of\nagriculture, mining and services is also a key element.\nAnother way to consider the types of change the\ndeveloping world is facing is to consider an urban\nsquatter's life and a rural villager's life in China, 20 years\nago and today. During the 1970s, food supply concerns\nstill existed, there was no television, limited bus and mass\ntransportation, little food trade, minimal processed food\nexisted, and most rural and urban occupations were very\nlabour-intensive. Today, work and life activities have\nchanged: small gas-powered tractors are available,\nmodern industrial techniques are multiplying, offices are\nquite automated, soft drinks and many processed foods\nare found everywhere, TVs are found in about 89% of\nhouseholds (at least a fifth of which are linked to Hong\nKong Star and Western advertising and programming),\nyounger children do not ride bicycles, and mass transit has\nbecome heavily used. Multiply such changes by similar\nones occurring in much of Asia, North Africa, the Middle\nEast, Latin America and many areas (particularly cities) in\nsub-Saharan Africa and it is evident that the shift from a\nsubsistence economy to a modern, industrialised one\noccurred in a span of 10\u00ad20 years. In Europe and other\nindustrialised, high-income societies, this occurred over\nmany decades or centuries.\nTo truly measure and examine these issues, we would\ncountries that are low- and middle-income, with changes\nthat occurred half a century earlier for the developed\nworld. However, data on diet and activity patterns are not\navailable and there are only minimal data on NR-NCDs\nand obesity.\nThe elements of the nutrition transition that we know to\nbe negatively linked with NR-NCDs are obesity, adverse\ndietary changes (e.g. shifts in structure of the diet towards\na greater role for higher fat and added sugar foods,\nreduced fruit and vegetable intakes, reduced fibre intake,\ngreater energy density and greater saturated fat intake),\nand reduced physical activity in work and leisure. We\nfocus on these first and then a few select underlying\nfactors. The causes of these elements of the nutrition\ntransition are not as well understood as the trends in each\nof them. In fact, there are few studies attempting to study\nthe causes of such changes and there are only a few\ndatasets that are equipped to allow such crucial policy\nanalyses to be undertaken.\nBM Popkin\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

In fact, the proportion of\noverweight or obese men more than doubled from 6.4.0%\nto 14.5% and the proportion of overweight or obese\nChina might be unique; we cannot show such a\ndramatic shift for other countries owing to a lack of\nbaseline data (except for Brazil where surveys in the\nnot exist for in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and\nAsia that show very high levels of current obesity (e.g.\nEgypt) which would allow us to understand if these\ncurrent high levels are the result of recent changes.\nOne of the regions representing a combination of\nmiddle- and lower-income countries that is experiencing\nvery high obesity rates is North Africa and sub-Saharan\nAfrica. Figure 27 \u00ad15 summarises results from representative\nsurveys in a number of countries in North Africa and the\nMiddle East. Although these are very high levels, they are\nno less astonishing than the results of a recent, nationally\nrepresentative survey of women of child-bearing age, 15\u00ad\n45 years, from South Africa. The South African Demo-\ngraphic and Health Survey collected weight and height\ndata from women16 and found that among black (African)\nthe adult men in these households were obese.\nWe have looked at the trends in underweight and\noverweight older children, aged 6\u00ad10 years, and\nadolescents, aged 11\u00ad18 years, in China, Russia, Brazil\nand the USA17. In this case, we found the average rate of\nincrease in the prevalence of overweight status over the\nlast two decades to be comparable among US and\nBrazilian children and adolescents, but lower among the\nChinese. Use of more recent data shows a more rapid and\nvery high increase in Brazil in the last decade whereas\nobesity declined in Russia, where an economic crisis and\nthe removal of food subsidies for meat and dairy products\nled to a remarkable decline in the energy density of\nDietary changes: shift in the overall structure over\ntime\nThe diets of the developing world are shifting equally\nrapidly.

The change in edible vegetable fat prices,\nsupply and consumption is unique because it equally\naffected rich and poor countries, but the net impact is\nrelatively much greater on low-income countries.\nWe have shown elsewhere that there was also an\nequally large and important shift in the proportion of\nenergy from added sugar in the diets of lower-income\nWhen we specifically examine the combined effect of\nthese various shifts in the structure of rural and urban\nChinese diets21, we find an upward shift in the energy\ndensity of the foods consumed. In this study, the kcal of\nenergy intake from foods and alcohol per 100 g of food in\nboth urban and rural Chinese adult diets increased by over\nshifts in energy density. It is important to note that this\nvalue of 2.42 is not comparable with the normal measure\nof energy density of the diet. The normal method includes\nfull measures of all beverages, while the Chinese Food\nComposition Table, from which these data were extracted,\nmeasures only a few beverages (milk, coconut juice,\nsugarcane juice, spirits, beer, wine, champagne and\nbrandy) and excludes many beverages, in particular tea\nand coffee. There are a number of clinical studies that\nvaried the energy density of the diet in ad libitum studies.\nEach finds that higher density increases, often only an\nincrease total energy intake22,23. For these reasons, energy\ndensity changes in China, and most likely in other\ndeveloping countries, are critical components of dietary\nchange to be monitored.\nPhysical activity shifts are equally rapid\nThere are much fewer data and less analysis on the shifts,\nover time, in energy expenditures and physical activity\npatterns in general. Some published studies have\ndemonstrated the remarkable shift in the structure of\noccupations, as well as in the activities performed in each\noccupation24,25. However, we have few publications or\ndata that have documented either physical activity patterns\nor precisely measured data on the physical activity\ncomponent of total energy expenditures for adults and\nchildren in the developing world. There is no basis to state\nthat there have been shifts in the other components of\nenergy expenditures (e.g. basal metabolic rates), so we\nfocus on physical activity except for selected disease shifts\n(e.g. reductions in parasitic infection and other infectious\ndisease that might have some independent effect on\nenergy expenditures).\nWe rely on the China Health and Nutrition Survey\n(CHNS) results with adult physical activity patterns\ntopic.

Although we do not address these\nissues here, there are several points to note about these\nkey elements:\n. rapid reductions in fertility have enhanced the shift in\nthe age distribution;\n. urbanisation continues unabated in Asia and Africa.\nMore poor will reside in urban than rural areas in future\ndecades;\n. economic changes, in particular increased income and\nincome inequality, appear to define changes in many\nregions of the developing world; and\n. globalisation of mass media is occurring at an earlier\nstage of economic development than faced higher-\nincome countries in the past.\nThe two major themes in this section \u00ad (1) rapid change\nfor some and (2) how greater social inequality between\nrich and poor defines the current nutrition transition facing\nlower- and middle-income countries \u00ad will be addressed.\nUrbanisation\nIn other published work we have shown how the structure\nof the diet has shifted markedly as populations have\nurbanised20. This relationship will, by itself, shift the\nstructure of the diet significantly at the national level as\nurbanisation continues and as the proportion of the\npopulation in urban areas grows.\nStructural shifts in income\u00addiet relationships are\noccurring\nEconomists speak of two types of behavioural change.\nOne relates to shifts in the composition of society\nregarding the plurality of the educated, rich or urban\nresidents. The other type relates to the way persons with\ndifferent characteristics behave and, in our case, economic\nbehaviour. This latter type, termed changes in behaviour,\nmeans that for the same level of education or income, a\nperson would buy different amounts or types of\ncommodities at different points in time. Research\nconducted in China shows there have been profound\nbehavioural shifts during the last decade (i.e. for each\nextra dollar of income, additional high-fat foods are\npurchased vs. what would have been purchased in\nprevious years for the equivalent extra dollar)19. Econom-\nists speak of this effect as one that shows how the\ndecision-making demand pattern for food has changed, so\nfor the same income level the patterns of demand have\nchanged significantly from earlier periods. Figure 5 shows\nhow extra income in China affects the poor differentially\nthan the rich, enhancing the fat intake of the poor more\nstatistically significant for both groups. The explosion in\naccess and exposure to mass media may very well have\ncreated this situation.\nMass media\nThere is no doubt that access to modern mass media has\ngrown very rapidly, particularly in the last decade.\nElsewhere, we have shown world-wide trends. It is very\nuseful to look at the proportion of households in a country\nthat own a television set to gain insight into this topic.\nAgain we use CHNS data to reflect the types of change in\none setting. Figure 6 shows the proportion of low-,\nmiddle- and upper-income tertile households that owned\nhouseholds in the CHNS sample owned a TV in 1997. It is\nimportant to note that, in China, not only was the\nFig. 5 Changes in the income elasticity for edible oil food consumption in China (increases in income elasticity between 1989 and 1993).\nSource: Guo et al.19\nBM Popkin\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

In the 1980s, cable systems in China did\nnot provide outside programming, but by 1997 many\nprovinces provided access to China Star, a Hong Kong\ntelevision system that relies heavily on US and British\nprogramming and provides modern TV advertising.\nAgain, while there are no extensive data on the\nproportion of Chinese households with access to mass\nmedia 30\u00ad70 years ago, we certainly know that the\npenetration into Chinese households in 1997 is far greater\nthan it was into US households 50 years ago; TV was in its\ninfancy then.\nAssertion 2 \u00ad The joint presence of undernutrition\nand overweight seems to be important\nThere are two related issues: (1) at the societal level,\nendemic levels of undernutrition and overnutrition exist in\nmany countries and (2) often at the same time in the same\nhousehold. India is a prime example of the first point. One\nwell-designed representative survey (the National Family\n15\u00ad45 years found that one main problem continues to be\nundernutrition, with 36% of the women having a low BMI\nclassified as overweight (BMI . 25 kg m22) and 2% are\nobese (BMI . 30 kg m22). There were significant differ-\nences between urban and rural residents, with 41% of the\nrural women having a low BMI contrasted with 23% of the\nurban women; and only 6% of the rural women were\noverweight or obese, compared with 24% for urban\nwomen. Many other examples abound; South Africa has a\nvery high rate of adult female overweight and obesity\n(44%) and also large proportions of malnourished\nThe work of Doak and others to highlight the large\nproportion of households in which persons with both low\nand high BMI coexist, reflective of undernutrition and\novernutrition, is important. She and her colleagues have\nshown that this is the case in both rich and poor families\nfrom many developing countries. A representative sample\nin Indonesian households revealing the prevalence of\nalmost 10% of all households having members with both\nlow and high BMI is most interesting30,31.\nThe fact that low-income households in many regions of\nthe world have high levels of overweight members is\nindicative of a rather new phenomenon in the developing\nworld, one of household food insecurity coupled with an\nenergy imbalance. The exact implications of this\nphenomenon need to be much more fully understood.\nAssertion 3 \u00ad Is the biology different? Or rather, do\nwe have different social structures and body\ncomposition patterns that affect BMI\u00addisease\nrelationships? Or are there genetic variants that are\nimportant?\nThere are a number of different ways these questions\ncould be answered in the affirmative. One is if the body\ncomposition and other unmeasured race\u00adethnic factors\naffect susceptibility to NR-NCDs. Another might be if\nprevious disease patterns (e.g. the presence of malaria or\nother tropical diseases) led to disease patterns that\npredisposed the population to certain problems.

For instance, a BMI of\n25 kg m22 in an Asian adult appears to have a far greater\nadverse metabolic effect than in a Caucasian adult34. In\nfact, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the\nInternational Obesity Task Force (IOTF) formed a group\nof scientists and agencies in Asia to review this topic. This\ngroup held international meetings and has proposed a\nlower BMI cut-off for Asians of 23 kg m22 for overweight\nChina, the Philippines and US Hispanics, blacks and\nwhites, the odds of being hypertensive were higher for\nChinese men and women than for the other sub-\npopulation groups at lower BMI values in the 23\u00ad\n25 kg m22 range36. Ethnic differences in the strength of the\nassociation between BMI and disease outcomes warrant\nfurther consideration.\nZimmet and others, who have focused on this issue as it\nrelates to lower-income countries, felt that the highest\ngenetic susceptibility for adult-onset diabetes was for\nPacific Islanders, American Indians, Mexican Americans\nand other Hispanics, and Asian Indians. Those with\nmodest genetic susceptibility include Africans, Japanese\nand Chinese37,38. The age of onset (usually after the age of\n50 years) of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\n(NIDDM) is much lower for these susceptible populations\nand it appears that the prevalence is higher for a given\nlevel of obesity and waist/hip ratio. Zimmet and co-\nworkers37,38 summarise a large selection of literature that\nhas explored these issues relating to diabetes among\nsusceptible populations.\nWhat is not clear is how much of this difference\nbetween sub-populations' BMI\u00addiabetes or other BMI\u00ad\nmorbidity relationships is a function of differences of body\ncomposition, metabolic or genetic factors, or social causes.\nElsewhere we have shown that part of the apparent race\u00ad\nhypertension relationship may also be explained partially\nby socio-economic status39.\nThere is another pathway related to the role of previous\nhealth problems for which we have less understanding\nand no real documentation of its impact. Examples would\nbe malnutrition that caused a virus to mutate, parasitic\ninfections that affected long-term absorption patterns, or a\nparasite that is linked with an unknown genotype \u00ad\ncomparable to sickle cell anaemia and its evolutionary\nlinkage with malaria. We have no basis for speculation\nabout this potential pathway.\nHowever, the final pathway \u00ad the effect of foetal and\ninfant insults on subsequent metabolic function \u00ad is one\nthat appears to be a critical area. If the rapid shifts towards\npositive energy imbalance are occurring concurrently with\nhigher levels of low birth weight in a population, then this\nbecomes a much more salient aspect of this argument. In\nthe developing world, where intrauterine malnutrition\nrates are high and a high prevalence of nutrition insults\nduring infancy exists, the work of Barker and many others\nportends important potential effects on the prevalence of\nNR-NCDs in the coming decades33,40. Not only is there an\nemerging consensus that foetal insults \u00ad in particular with\nregard to thin, low-birth-weight infants who subsequently\nface a shift in the stage of the transition and become\noverweight \u00ad are linked with increased risk of NR-NCDs,\nbut infancy may equally be a period of high vulnerability.\nThree new studies by Hoffman et al.41 \u00ad43 suggest that the\nfat metabolism of stunted infants is impaired to the extent\nthat this could lead to increased obesity and other\nmetabolic shifts. Other work on the role of stunting on\nobesity had suggested such an effect, but Hoffman et al.'s\nwork suggests the mechanism and fits with the correla-\nAssertion 4 \u00ad The politics are different in the\ndeveloping world and lead to a programme and\npolicy dilemma! The capacity to address the rapid\nincrease in NR-NCDs does not exist as it did at this\nstage in higher-income countries!\nIn the countries of the developing world, where the\npoliticians have focused for decades on issues of hunger\nand infectious diseases, we face a major challenge in\ngetting focus on the prevention of obesity and NR-NCDs.\nThe rapidity of the increases in obesity and many NR-\nNCDs is an indication of the need for preventive action.\nThe ultimate challenge is to get countries that are poor\nto develop a preventive public health agenda rather than\nrelying on subsequent treatment. The examples from Latin\nAmerica, where hunger-oriented programmes that\nignored the issues of obesity actually led to increased\nobesity45, strengthen the arguments for this approach.\nAnother concern is the large proportion of lower-\nincome households with separate individuals who have\nunder- and overweight at the same time. The key point is\nDoak et al.'s findings of large proportions of households\nwith underweight and overweight members simul-\nFinally, the NR-NCDs increased in prevalence slowly in\nthe higher-income countries; medical systems had time to\nadjust to the needs; public health systems were able to\nbegin addressing the situations; and individual treatments\ncould be undertaken because incomes were higher.\nEffective public health interventions have rarely been\nadopted.\nThe collective wisdom of the Bellagio meeting will\nfocus on this topic as one of the more important issues that\nultimately needs to be addressed.\nBM Popkin\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.
