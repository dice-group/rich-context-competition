Further, PBC constitutes a significant economic\nburden resulting in yearly costs of 69-115 million US\ndollars for hospital charges alone, as estimated by the\nHealthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). Both\nprevalence3 and mortality4 rates for PBC have been in-\ncreasing over the past decade.\nGenetic factors likely play an important role in confer-\nring susceptibility to PBC, as indicated by the high con-\ncordance rate among monozygotic twins5 and the\nincreased incidence among first-degree relatives of af-\nfected individuals6.

However, the\nconcordance of PBC among discordant twin pairs5, the\ngeographical pattern in prevalence rates7, and the occur-\nrence of clusters of the disease8 indicate that environmen-\ntal factors might contribute to break immunological\ntolerance and lead to the onset of PBC. Both chemicals9\nand bacteria10 have been suggested as environmental fac-\ntors responsible for the induction of PBC in genetically\nsusceptible individuals.\nPBC epidemiological data from the United States on\nrisk factors for PBC and comorbidity rates were assessed\nonly in one report using a questionnaire administered to\npatients with PBC, their siblings and friends.11 We report\nherein the results of the largest case-control study to date\nof environmental, familial, and medical factors associated\nwith PBC. The study is based on a structured, standard-\nized telephone interview, administered by trained person-\nnel to 1032 patients with PBC from the United States and\n1041 unrelated controls selected by random-digit-dialing\n(RDD) and matched for sex, age, race, and geographical\nlocation.\nPatients and Methods\nPBC Cases. Between November 1999 and June\nfrom 23 collaborating tertiary referral medical centers for\nliver diseases located in various areas of the United States\n(listed in the appendix to the manuscript). Cases were\nbeing followed at such centers or by local hepatologists\nwho had active relationships with the tertiary centers. Pa-\ntients were eligible for inclusion if the diagnosis of PBC\npre-determined criteria, including a detectable AMA and\nat least one of the following: a cholestatic pattern of serum\nbiochemical tests (serum alkaline phosphatase 2 times\nnormal upper values) for at least 6 months and/or com-\npatible liver histology.12 In suspected cases of PBC with-\nout detectable AMA (up to 10% of patients in the routine\nclinical laboratory 13), criteria were modified and included\nall the following: ANA or anti-smooth muscle autoanti-\nbodies, a cholestatic pattern of biochemical tests (elevated\nserum alkaline phosphatase) for at least 6 months, and a\ncompatible liver histology. To assess accuracy, referring\nphysicians re-evaluated anonymized clinical information\nin 100 randomly selected enrolled patients. The diagnosis\nof PBC was confirmed in all cases. Referred patients re-\nceived a letter from the Principal Investigator (M.E.G.) to\nexplain the nature and goals of the study and were asked\nto contact the Division of Clinical Immunology at UC\nDavis if interested in participating. Patients who decided\nto participate were then called to schedule the telephone\nadministered the questionnaire by telephone interview\nand were compensated for their partecipation to the\nstudy. After being informed about the procedures of the\nstudy, 58 (5%) declined to participate.\nControls. Controls were selected by RDD and\nmatched to cases for sex, 5-year age group, race, and geo-\ngraphical area. RDD utilized a technique that excludes\nthe majority of phone numbers that are not assigned to\nhouseholds.14 Briefly, a complete list of all valid area codes\nand prefixes was obtained for the area where each case\nresided. Numbers were then added at random to consti-\ntute a phone number, and 15 attempts in dialing each\nnumber (on different days and at different times) were\nmade by the California Department of Health Services\n(CDHS) Computer Assisted Telephone Interview\n(CATI) unit. Once one or more willing, case-matched,\neligible controls was identified among the primary sam-\npling units (PSUs), the telephone interview was sched-\nuled. A letter was also immediately sent to enrolled\ncontrol subjects to explain further the nature and goals of\ncalled resulting in 47,395 contacts that confirmed the\nresidential nature of the number. Among eligible con-\nformed about the nature of the study, completed the\ntelephone interview, and were compensated for their\npartecipation to the study with the same amount as PBC\ncases. Six hundred and eighteen controls (59%) were in-\nterviewed within a 12 month period from matched cases,\n(including Native American and Asian patients), more-\nover, race-matched controls could not be identified. In\nthese case, Caucasian controls were used after matching\nfor sex, age, and geographical area. Lastly, in 9 PBC cases,\ntwo eligible controls were identified among PSUs and\nboth were administered the interview and included for\nanalysis to avoid selection bias.\nData Collection. The study design was approved by\nlocal ethical committees at all partecipating institutions\nand respected the most recent Declaration of Helsinki\n(Edinburgh, 2000). Further, all patients and controls gave\nwritten consent to the use of data for research purposes\nafter being informed about the nature of the study prior to\nthe telephone interview. The telephone interview instru-\nments consisted of standardized questions derived from\nthe US National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nvey (NHANES III). The instrument included over 180\nquestions and 300 subquestions regarding demographics,\nlifestyle, personal and familial medical history, and repro-\nductive (for female cases and controls only) and occupa-\ntional history. Trained personnel belonging to the CDHS\nCATI unit interviewed both patients and controls with\ninterviewers unaware of the available literature on PBC\netiology. Each interview lasted approximately 90-180\nminutes. To estimate the reproducibility of the obtained\ninformation, a subgroup of 40 cases was randomly se-\nlected and the questionnaire was re-administered to these\nsubjects at least 12 months after the first interview. The\nresponses from this group of 40 were then used to esti-\nmate the consistency of data over time and analyzed as\npreviously described.15 Results of this reliability analysis\nshowed a 93% average consistency rate between inter-\nData Analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to com-\nparecharacteristicsofPBCcasesandmatchedcontrols.First,\nsocioeconomic, demographic, and clinical characteristics\nwere compared for both study participants and their first-\ndegree family members. Specifically, we compared age\ngroups, race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status, as\nwell as familial occurrence of PBC. In addition, reported\ncomorbidities with other autoimmune diseases in partici-\npants and family members were examined. Second, we com-\npared lifestyle factors, such as smoking, diet, and the use of\nvarious chemical compounds, such as hair dye and nail pol-\nish.Third,weexaminedreproductivefactorsandhistoryand\nhormonal medications among females only. Specifically, the\nnumber of pregnancies, use of oral contraceptives or hor-\nmone replacement therapy (HRT), and history of gyneco-\nlogical conditions were recorded. The unadjusted analyses of\ndifferences between cases and controls for potential risk fac-\ntors were performed using the Wilcoxon test for continous\nvariables and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables.\nWe next developed multivariable models using condi-\ntional multiple logistic regression analyses. The back-\nwards elimination model selection strategy was used to\nensure that the models were relatively parsimonious using\na criterion of P  .05 for inclusion of variables. Race\n(white or other), geographical location, and age were in-\ncluded in all models as candidate explanatory variables\nbecause they were used as matching criteria in the surveys.\nIn addition, annual household income was included as a\ncandidate variable in all models.\nThe model for sociodemographic and clinical candi-\ndate variables included sex, education level, body mass\nindex (BMI) at age 25 (grouped as \"high\" [30], \"me-\nthe person had at least one vaccination (for chickenpox,\nhepatitis A, hepatitis B, diphteria-pertussis-tetanus, ru-\nbella, mumps, polio, small pox, or tuberculosis) and\nwhether the person had had at least one urogenital con-\ndition (including pelvic or vaginal infection in women or\nany urinary tract infection in both sexes). Additionally,\nthe following were considered to be possible explanatory\nvariables: at least one first-degree family member (parent,\nsibling, or offspring) having PBC, systemic lupus ery-\nthematosus (SLE), arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Raynaud\nsyndrome, Sjo\n\u00a8gren syndrome, scleroderma, polymyositis,\nautoimmune thyroid disease, or diabetes mellitus.\nWe then examined lifestyle candidate variables including\nsex, whether the participant had smoked tobacco at some\ntime in their life, the amount of smoking, and passive expo-\nsuretosmoke.Passivesmokeexposurewasassessedusingthe\nvalidated instrument of Coghlin et al.16 that includes living\nwith a smoker in the household, the number of smokers in\nthe household, the number of hours per day of smoke expo-\nsure in the household, exposure to smokers at work, the\nnumber of immediate coworkers who smoked (limited to a\nmaximum of 10 individuals), the number of hours exposed\nto smoke in the workplace per day, other sources of exposure\nto smoke, and the number of hours per week of such smoke\nexposure. These data were combined into the total number\nof hours per week of smoke exposure, and the total number\nof10-personhoursperweekofsmokeexposure.Allvariables\non passive smoke exposure were reported at the time of the\ninterview. Other lifestyle variables included consumption of\nat least 120 g of alcohol over the lifetime and the number of\nuses per year of hair dye, hair spray, and nail polish.\nFinally, multivariable models were developed for re-\nproductive factors and hormonal medications among\nonly female cases and controls. Candidate variables re-\ngarding menstrual history were age at menarche, meno-\npausal status, cause of menopause (natural, surgical,\nradiological), usual length of current menstrual cycles,\nwhether current cycles were long (more than 35 days) or\nshort (less than 24 days), menstrual cycle and period du-\nration at the age of 20, whether the duration of cycles at\nthat age varied by more than 4 days. Candidate variables\nregarding exogenous estrogen included use of birth con-\ntrol pills for at least 6 months, and any use of HRT.\nCandidate variables concerning fertility were whether the\nwoman was ever pregnant, the number of pregnancies,\nthe age at first pregnancy, and failure to become pregnant\nafter a period of being sexually active in the absence of\nbirth control measures (a measure of subfertility).\nStatistical comparisons were made using SAS software\n(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). All analyses were two-\nsided, and P values of less than .05 were considered sta-\ntistically significant. Continous variables are expressed as\nmean  standard deviation.\nResults\nSociodemographic Characteristics. A total of 1032\nparticipate and completed the telephone interview. After\nselection by RDD and fulfillment of matching criteria,\n1041 controls also agreed to participate in the study. Fig-\nure 1 illustrates the geographical distribution of the PBC\ncases enrolled in all states except Delaware and Hawaii.\nCases and controls were similar with respect to sex, age,\nand ethnicity (Table 1).

The most common co-\nmorbid autoimmune diseases in patients with PBC were\nrheumatoid arthritis (10%), Raynaud syndrome (12%),\nand Sjo\n\u00a8gren syndrome (10%). Table 2 shows that the\nprevalence rates for the latter two conditions were 6-20\ntimes higher among cases compared to controls (P \n.0001 for both comparisons). Similarly, significantly\nhigher prevalence rates of SLE, scleroderma, and autoim-\nmune thyroid disease were observed for patients with\nPBC compared with controls (P  .0001 for all three\ncomparisons).

First, the enrollment of pa-\ntients through an Internet-based support group might\nhave led to an over-representation of patients with higher\neducation and social status. Second, the use of siblings\nand friends as controls may have biased the estimates of\ncomorbid conditions in patients and their families. De-\nspite these limitations, our prior study facilitated the de-\nvelopment of hypotheses, the design of a more\ncomprehensive investigative strategy, and the refinement\nof the questionnaire.\nPBC frequently coexists with other autoimmune dis-\neases that are also more frequently found in family mem-\nbers without PBC, although data are often not consistent\nacross studies.1 Thus, an initial report of an association of\nPBC with breast cancer18 was not confirmed by others.19\nWe are aware of the potential weaknesses of our study\ndesign. The lower participation rate among controls com-\npared to cases might have been associated to the different\ndistribution of socioeconomic status. As a consequence,\nthe controls may have been receiving medical attention of\nlower frequency and quality. The large number of factors\ninvestigated by statistical testing might also account for\nfalsely significant associations. Nonetheless, many of the\nassociations in the multivariable analysis were significant\nat P levels considerably lower than .05. Finally, all the\ninformation, except the diagnosis of PBC in enrolled\ncases, was obtained from self-reporting and not validated\nby record review, which could result in misclassifications,\nparticularly for comorbidities. Despite these limitations,\nwe believe that our findings represent the soundest evi-\ndence ofassociations yet reported for PBC.\nThe design of our study included the investigation of\nthree important types of variables, including demograph-\nics and personal and family history, lifestyle, and repro-\nductive factors in female participants. Each type included,\namong others, variables that had been previously sug-\ngested as risk factors for PBC, such as familial clustering,6\nassociation with UTI,20 tobacco smoking,11 and estrogen\nWe observed that PBC coexists with other autoim-\nmune diseases in 32% of cases compared to 13% of con-\ntrols. Among autoimmune conditions found in PBC\ncases, Raynaud syndrome (12%) and Sjo\n\u00a8gren syndrome\n(10%) were the most frequent, in accordance with previ-\nous reports.22,23 We note that other studies reported\nhigher prevalence rates but were based on a smaller num-\nber of probably select cases. We found that 27 cases (3%)\nwith PBC reported a diagnosis of SLE. This is surprising\nsince only six cases of such an association had been previ-\nously described in the literature.24 Among non-autoim-\nmune conditions, we found a high prevalence of\nhypercholesterolemia among PBC cases, consistent with\nchronic cholestasis and induction of lipoprotein X synthe-\nsis and similar to previous reports.25 We also report for the\nfirst time a higher prevalence of hay fever among controls\ndata did not reveal an association between PBC and breast\ncancer, the prevalence of which was not significantly dif-\nferent between cases and controls. Importantly, 59% of\npatients with PBC reported a history of UTI compared to\n52% of controls, and UTI was independently associated\nwith PBC in multivariable modeling. This finding sup-\nports the hypothesis that infectious agents may break im-\nmunological tolerance in PBC.26 Similarly, the increased\nprevalence and frequency of vaginal infections among fe-\nmale cases and the higher rate of tonsillectomy in all pa-\ntients with PBC also support this hypothesis. Notably, the\nhistory for UTIs or vaginal infections reported by partic-\nipants was not confirmed with laboratory data, perhaps\nbecause UTIs are often asymptomatic or minimally\nsymptomatic, especially in women.\nThe observed rates of autoimmune diseases in relatives\nof cases and controls strongly support the hypothesis that\ngenetic background is crucial in establishing predisposi-\ntion to PBC and, possibly, autoimmunity in general. All\nof the autoimmune conditions we investigated were re-\nported significantly more often in first-degree relatives of\npatients with PBC compared to controls. Notably, 6% of\npatients with PBC also reported having a family member\nwith the disease, most often the mother or a sister, in\naccordance with our previous data11 and and more fre-\nquently than reported in older studies.7\nThe analysis of lifestyle factors demonstrated that a\nhistory of smoking and the frequent use of cosmetic prod-\nucts such as nail polish were associated with PBC. How-\never, the odds ratio for increased frequency of nail polish\nuse was not impressive and thus this association must be\ninterpreted with caution. Nonetheless, these data are in-\ntriguing in view of the xenobiotics hypothesis proposed\nfor the development PBC with specific halogenated com-\npounds that could increase the immunogenicity of mito-\nchondrial proteins9 and able to induce AMA in animal\nmodels.27 An association between PBC and smoking\ncould also be explained by a possible effect of tobacco\nsmoke on the T-helper-1 cytokine response28 that is pre-\nA role for estrogens in establishing the female predom-\ninance of PBC has been proposed, but supporting evi-\ndence is limited.21 Our results indicate that a history of\nuse of HRT was significantly more frequent among\nwomen with PBC and was also significantly associated\nwith PBC in the multivariable model. This association is\nrelevant to the clinical management of PBC, since vari-\nable degrees of bone loss, in our study suggested by re-\nportedly shorter height of patients with PBC, are\ncommon features of prolonged cholestasis30 that induce\nphysicians to prescribe HRT.31 We therefore cannot de-\ntermine whether the more frequent use of hormone re-\nplacement therapy is a cause or a consequence of having\nPBC. However, an altered distribution of estrogen recep-\ntors has recently been demonstrated in liver samples of\npatients with different stages of PBC.32 Our results also\nshowed that never having been pregnant was negatively\nassociated with PBC while we could not confirm the pre-\nviously reported high prevalence of menstrual abnormal-\nities in women with PBC.33 The former factor is\nconsistent with the proposed role for fetal microchimer-\nism in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity,34 despite the\nconflicting data reported on this issue.35-37\nIn conclusion, we report the results of the largest\nstudy to date of risk factors and comorbidities associ-\nated with PBC. Our data support some of the previ-\nously proposed risk factors for PBC, including familial\noccurrence, clustering of autoimmunity, smoking, and\nhistory of UTI. However, this large study did not con-\nfirm other previous reports, such as the increased prev-\nalence of breast cancer in women with PBC. We\nfurther identified new putative risk factors (the use of\ncosmetic products) and autoimmune conditions (SLE)\nassociated with PBC. Future efforts should concentrate\non interactions of genetic and environmental factors in\nrelation to PBC. The former issue should be ap-\nproached through the creation of a worldwide database\nand collection of samples from patients and family\nmembers and through a genome-wide linkage study,\nsimilar to that recently reported for juvenile rheuma-\ntoid arthritis.38 The role of identified environmental\nrisk factors should be investigated in animal studies to\nachieve a satisfactory model for the etiology of PBC.\nInvestigations of putative environmental agents in dif-\nferent genetically inbred mouse strains could uncover\nthe genetic\u00adenvironmental interactions leading to the\ndevelopment of PBC. Only these combined efforts will\nprovide the solution to the enigma of PBC etiology.\n"
