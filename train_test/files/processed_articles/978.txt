Obesity is a major\nrisk factor for coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension\nand certain types of cancer.9 \u00ad 13 Obesity in childhood is also\nassociated with high prevalence of elevated blood pressure,\ndiabetes, respiratory disease and orthopedic and psychoso-\ncial disorders.14 \u00ad 18 The most significant long-term conse-\nquence of childhood obesity is its persistence into\nadulthood, along with all the associated health risks.19\nWith rapid growing economy and changing lifestyles in\nChina, the prevalence of overweight and obesity is increas-\ning rapidly in adults.20 However, to date, there is little\ninformation on the extent of obesity among children in\nChina. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine time\ntrends of childhood obesity in China.\nSubjects and methods\nChina Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) design\nThe CHNS is a collaborative project of the Institute of\nNutrition and Food Hygiene, Chinese Academy of Preventive\nMedicine, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel\nHill. The first wave of the CHNS data were collected in 1989,\nedu=china=home).\nThe CHNS covered eight provinces (Guangxi, Guizhou,\nHenan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Liaoning and Shangdong\nby Heilongjiang in 1997) that vary substantially in geogra-\nphy, economic development, public resources and health\n*Correspondence: FB Hu, Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of\nE-mail: Frank.hu@channing.harvard.edu\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nindicators. A multistage, random cluster process was used to\ndraw the sample surveyed in each of the provinces. Detailed\ninformation on the survey design and operation was\nStudy population and measurements\nBecause Liangning province was replaced by Heilongjiang\nprovince in 1997, in order to keep the data comparable, we\nonly analyzed data from the other seven provinces (exclud-\ning Liangning and Heilongjiang provinces) in this study.\nmeasurements were used in the longitudinal analysis. These\nsured at least twice. The 692 children who had measure-\npredicting analyses.\nOf the detailed household and individual data collected,\nthe most relevant for this study are the demographic data,\nphysical examination data (including height and weight),\nand socioeconomic factors (including household income,\nparents' education and other related data). The anthropome-\ntrical measurements were carried out by trained health work-\ners following standard protocol. Body weight was measured\nin light indoor clothing to the nearest 0.1 kg with a beam\nbalance scale. Height was measured without shoes to the\nnearest 0.1 cm, using a portable stadiometer.\nDefinition of childhood overweight and obesity\nTo define childhood overweight and obesity, we used age-\nand sex-specific BMI (body mass index) cut-off points pro-\nposed by international obesity task force (IOTF), which\nold.24 The IOTF references are provided only for 6 month\nintervals. To provide a more precise fit, we used a polynomial\napproach to fit the BMI cut-off points for overweight and\nobesity against the ages of the boys and girls. Each curve had\nresiduals was < 0.03). An advantage of using the predicted\nvalues was that we could use ages rounded to 0.1 y.25\nData analyses\nFirst, we conducted cross-sectional analyses among children\naged 2 \u00ad 6 y in each survey year to examine the time trends in\nbody composition (including height, weight, BMI) and rates\nof overweight and obesity by sex and region. To correct for\nchanges in the age distribution over time, the results were\nage-adjusted by the direct method based on the total sample\nof the four surveys.\nSecond, we conducted longitudinal analyses to examine\ntime trends in BMI, overweight and obesity among 944\nized estimation equation (GEE) implemented in Proc\nGenmod procedure in SAS.26 In the models, we included\nthe following covariables: age, height, gender, region (urban,\nrural), parental overweight (at least one parent with BMI\n! 23 kg=m2), mother's education, household income\n(divided into tertiles: low, median, high) and child's baseline\nweight (normal, overweight). We tested interactions between\ntime and region, gender, parental overweight and child's\nbaseline weight to examine the different trends among\ndifferent sub-populations.\nFinally, we used logistic regression to predict overweight\nables included age, gender, region, parental overweight,\nchild's overweight at baseline and household income.\nResults\nCross-sectional analyses of childhood obesity among\nchildren aged 2 \u00ad 6 y\nThe distributions of age, gender and place of residence across\ntime for children aged 2 \u00ad 6 y are shown in Table 1. There\nwere no systematic changes in the proportion of boys or\ngirls. However, the proportion of children in rural areas\nThe distribution of age shifted toward older age group from\nFigure 1 shows the trends of weight and height over time\nby gender and region. Average weight and height all\nincreased significantly over time, and the increase was simi-\nlar for boys and girls. The mean weight and height in urban\narea were higher than in the rural area. The increase in\nweight was more evident in urban areas, whereas the\nincrease in height was more evident in rural areas.\nTrends in BMI and prevalence of overweight and obesity\nover time by region are shown in Figure 2. In urban areas,\nTable 1 Characteristics of sampled Chinese children aged 2 \u00ad 6 y over\ntime\nn % n % n % n %\nAge group (y)\nGender\nRegion\nTime trends of childhood obesity\nJ Luo and FB Hu\nInternational Journal of Obesity\n28.9%, and the prevalence of obesity increased from 1.5 to\n12.6%. In rural areas, mean BMI values did not change\nsubstantially over time. The prevalence of obesity increased\nLongitudinal analyses for the follow-up data\nWe modeled the trends in BMI over time, adjusting for age,\nheight, gender, parental overweight status and region (Table\n2). Overall, BMI increased significantly over time after\nadjusting for age and height. Boys were heavier than girls.\nChildren whose parents were overweight were heavier than\nthose whose parents were not overweight. In addition, from\nmodels 2 \u00ad 4 in Table 2, significant interactions were found\nbetween time trend and region, parental overweight status,\nand child's overweight status at baseline. The mean BMI in\nurban areas increased more quickly than in rural areas (0.20\nvs 0.11 kg=m2=y); the BMI of children with an overweight\nparent increased more quickly than those without an over-\nchildren who were not overweight at baseline increased\nmore quickly than children who were overweight at baseline\nTable 3 shows the results from a multivariate model using\noverweight or obesity as the dependent variables. The pre-\nvalence of obesity decreased with increasing age, and a\nstrong positive association was seen between parental over-\nweight and their children's obesity. A significant interaction\nwas observed between time and region. A increasing time\ntrend of obesity was observed in China urban areas (it\nincreased about 27% per year), but no increase was observed\nin rural areas. Results were similar for overweight; it\nincreased about 12% per year in urban areas.\nIn a multivariate logistic model, children's overweight status\nin early childhood (2 \u00ad 6 y), parental overweight, high\nincome and urban area independently predicted overweight\nwas 2.2 times higher among children who were overweight\nFigure 1 Trends of weight and height over time by gender and region.\nTime trends of childhood obesity\nJ Luo and FB Hu\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nat baseline than those children who were not overweight at\nthe same age. The risk of overweight was about four times\ngreater among children with an overweight parent than\nthose whose parents were not overweight. The risk of over-\nweight in median or high household income level was about\ntwice as high compared with low income level, although this\nestimate was not statistically significant.\nDiscussion\nRapid increase in childhood obesity has been observed in\ndeveloped countries during the past decade. In the US, the\nprevalence of overweight (defined by 85th percentile of\nweight-for-height) among 5 to 24-y-olds from a biracial\ncommunity of Louisiana (total n \u00bc 11 564) increased\nincreasing trends have been observed in many developing\ncountries.28 \u00ad 33 The prevalence of obesity among school\nchildren aged 6 \u00ad 12 y in Thailand (diagnosed by weight-for-\nprevalence of obesity among children of 0 \u00ad 7 y in China\nestimates were much lower than our findings, partly because\ndifferent obesity standards and populations were used.\nOur study found a dramatic increase in the prevalence of\noverweight and obesity among preschool children in urban\nobesity increased from 1.5 to 12.6%. In rural areas, both\nheight and weight have increased over time. Because the\nincrease in height was more rapid, the prevalence of over-\nweight and obesity has not increased appreciably in rural\nareas. After controlling for potential confounders, there was\na significant increasing trend in BMI in urban areas\n(0.2 kg=m2=y) and the prevalence of obesity increased 27%\nper year in urban areas.\nDefining obesity or overweight for children and adoles-\ncents is difficult due to different rates of maturation and\ngrowth, and there is no generally accepted definition of\nobesity or overweight for children and adolescents.34 A\nvariety of criteria for overweight and obesity have been\nused to evaluate prevalence and trends among children\nand adolescents,35 \u00ad 38 which has made comparisons between\nstudies difficult. Thus it is crucial to have an international\nstandard to define childhood obesity. The IOTF standard23\nwas proposed recently, which used percentile curves which\nwere drawn at age 18 y passed through the widely used cut-\noff points of 25 and 30 kg=m2 for adult overweight and\nobesity. We used this standard because it can be used for\nboth children and adolescents, and it can facilitate interna-\ntional comparisons.34 However, some have argued39 that the\nstandard may not be appropriate for Asian and Pacific chil-\ndren who grow and mature very differently from some of the\nreference populations (Brazil, Great Britain, Hong Kong, The\nNetherlands, Singapore, and the United States). Thus, the\nrates of overweight and obesity shown here should be viewed\nas conservative estimates. The actual prevalence could have\nbeen considerably higher if a leaner reference population has\nbeen used. However, this limitation should not have affected\nthe assessment of time trends.\nFigure 2 Trends of BMI, overweight and obesity over time by region.\nTime trends of childhood obesity\nJ Luo and FB Hu\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nNumerous studies have shown that increased energy\nintake and sedentary lifestyle are the two characteristics\nmost strongly associated with the increased prevalence of\nobesity worldwide.40 In developed countries, especially in\nthe US, television viewing and snacking are considered\nimportant factors of childhood obesity, because snacking\nwhile viewing TV tends to result in a higher energy intake\nand lower energy expenditure.41 A similar relationship\nbetween the prevalence of obesity and television watching\nwas observed in Chinese children.42\nAnother possible explanation for the increased childhood\nobesity is the rapid change in dietary pattern in China.43\nWestern fast foods have become very popular in large cities\nof China. Fast foods are high in fat and energy and low in\nfiber; frequent consumption of fast foods will probably\nincrease the intake of total energy.\nThe study has several limitations. First, substantial pro-\nportions of the children were lost to follow-up. However, we\nfound no significant differences in prevalence of overweight\nand obesity and other characteristics at baseline between\ndropouts and those who remained in the study. Thus, the\ndropout should not affect the cross-sectional analysis of\nobesity prevalence at each survey for children aged 2 \u00ad 6 y\nold. Second, the CHNS did not collect information on\nphysical activity. It is unclear whether activity levels have\nincreased or decreased over time. Despite these limitations,\nthe CHNS is a unique dataset and provides an unprecedented\nopportunity to conduct both cross-sectional and longi-\ntudinal analyses of childhood obesity in China.\nIn conclusion, we found a substantial increase in child-\nhood obesity in China, especially in the urban areas. Our\nstudy revealed the risk of overweight among children aged\n10 \u00ad 14 y increased substantially if the children were over-\nweight at 2 \u00ad 6 y. Thus, preventive efforts should start at an\nearly age.\n"
