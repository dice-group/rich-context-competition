The vitamin acts as a cofactor for\n.100 enzymes involved in such diverse processes as macromo-\nlecular metabolism, immune competence, hormone function,\nheme biosynthesis, and the synthesis and catabolism of sphin-\ngolipids and neurotransmitters (7). Consequently, causal con-\nnections between low vitamin B-6 status and age-related diseases\nsuch as CVD, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and cancer are\nplausible.\nThus far, most interest in vitamin B-6 as a disease-preventive\nfactor has focused on its role in homocysteine (Hcy) transsul-\nfuration. However, vitamin B-6 status is now known to be a\ncomparatively weak determinant of the Hcy concentration\n(4,8,9) and studies have shown that the connection between low\nForty-five years ago, McKusick et al. (12) discovered that\npatients with rheumatoid arthritis had decreased excretion of\npyridoxine, a form of vitamin B-6. Along with people affected by\nother chronic inflammatory conditions (13,14), such patients are\nat high risk of morbidity and mortality from CVD (15,16). In\nfact, CVD (17,18) and other age-related chronic diseases (19\u00ad\n21) are increasingly viewed as inflammatory and inflammation is\nconsidered to be central to the aging process (20,22). Low\nplasma concentrations of pyridoxal 59-phosphate (PLP), the\nbiologically active form of vitamin B-6, in patients hospitalized\nfor myocardial infarction could reflect an acute phase reaction.\nSpecifically, vitamin B-6 is required for production of the\ncytokines (23) that are among the primary mediators of chronic\ninflammation (24) as well as for the proliferation/activation of\nlymphocytes that characterizes the inflammatory response\n(25,26). In fact, some studies demonstrated a transient lowering\nof plasma PLP after myocardial infarction (5,27). Furthermore,\nprevious studies from our laboratory and elsewhere favored the\nhypothesis that plasma PLP concentrations were lowered by\ninflammation over the idea that low vitamin B-6 status increases\nthe risk of inflammation or inflammatory diseases (28\u00ad30).\nexpressed in this publication are those of the authors and do not necessarily\nreflect the view of the USDA.\n2 Author disclosures: M.

However, the above-described reverse causation\nscenario could not explain associations that have been reported\nbetween low vitamin B-6 intake and inflammatory markers\nThe NHANES collects data on nutrient intakes from diet and\nsupplements. Furthermore, the inflammatory marker C-reactive\nprotein (CRP) is routinely measured in serum samples. Plasma\nPLP measurements were also obtained for .7000 NHANES\nciations between both vitamin B-6 intakes and plasma PLP\nconcentrations and serum CRP concentrations. We also inves-\ntigated the question of whether the vitamin B-6 requirement is\naffected by inflammation by determining the vitamin B-6 intake\nassociated with minimal prevalence of vitamin B-6 inadequacy\nin different serum CRP strata.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants. The NHANES monitors the nation's health and nutri-\ntional status via a continuous annual survey (33). Selection of a\nrepresentative sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian popula-\ntion is accomplished using a complex multistage probability design. To\nincrease the precision of estimates derived from the survey, adolescents,\nthe elderly, Mexican-Americans, and Blacks are oversampled. The\nprotocols for conduct of the NHANES were approved by the institu-\ntional review board of the National Center for Health Statistics, CDC,\nand informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nTrained interviewers used a computer-assisted personal interview\nsystem to interview participants in their homes. During the home visit,\nparticipants were asked to produce all dietary supplements, prescription\ndrugs, and nonprescription pain relievers they were taking. In the\nto report to a mobile examination center (MEC) to provide further\ninterview data and undergo a physical examination that included\nphlebotomy, body composition assessment, and blood pressure measure-\nments. A detailed description of blood collection and processing can be\nfound in the NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual (34). Female\nparticipants were interviewed regarding reproductive history at the MEC.\nQuestions concerned age at menarche, menopausal status, and history of\noral contraceptive use, pregnancy, and hormone replacement therapy.\nwith reliable dietary data for both diet recalls, we excluded 470 who had\nbeen diagnosed with diabetes or whose diabetes status was unclear. After\nadditional exclusions for pregnancy (n = 172), breast-feeding (n = 23),\nhormone replacement therapy (n = 102), and use of oral contraceptives\n(n = 94) or steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (n = 43), complete data for\ndepending on the model covariates.\nEstimation of usual intake of vitamin B-6 and other nutrients.\nwere collected (35). The first day's data were collected in a 24-h recall\ninterview conducted at the MEC. A second 24-h recall interview was\nconducted by telephone 3\u00ad10 d after the MEC examination. The 2\ndietary interviews were administered by trained staff and the USDA's\nFood Surveys Research Group was responsible for the dietary data\ncollection methodology, maintenance of the databases used to code and\nprocess the data, and data review and processing.\nThe availability of results from the 2 24-h recalls allowed us to\nestimate each participant's usual intake of vitamin B-6, protein, and\nenergy using methods and computer programs developed by the\nNational Cancer Institute (36). The National Cancer Institute method\nuses the repeat diet assessments to estimate the day-to-day variability in\nintakes as well as the correlation between intakes reported over\nconsecutive days and changes in diet between weekdays and weekend\ndays.\nIf the participant had used vitamins, minerals, or other dietary\nsupplements within 30 d of the interview, the interviewer recorded\ninformation on the amount taken per use and the frequency and duration\nof use (37). The amount of each ingredient in each product used was\ndetermined by matching the name and manufacturer of the supplement\nto those in a database developed by the National Center for Health\nStatistics in collaboration with the NIH's Office of Dietary Supplements.\nThe information in the database came from sources such as the\nmanufacturer or retailer, the Internet, and company catalogs. We used\nthe various dietary supplement files to identify all participants who\nreported using any supplemental source of vitamin B-6 and to determine\neach such participant's usual daily intake of vitamin B-6 from supple-\nments. This amount was added to the estimated usual intake of vitamin\nB-6 from food to yield the total daily vitamin B-6 intake for participants\nwho used supplemental vitamin B-6.\nLaboratory analyses. Plasma PLP was measured by A/C Diagnostic-\nsusing a homogeneous, nonradioactive, enzymatic assay (38). The\nfollowing statistics were reported: mean intra-assay CV, 8%; mean inter-\nvitamin B-6 adequacy used to set the current Estimated Average\nRequirements and Recommended Dietary Allowances of vitamin B-6\n(39). Results below the detection limit of the assay were replaced with\nthe value 7.1 nmol/L (i.e. the detection limit divided by the square root of\nSerum CRP was assayed at the University of Washington Medical\nCenter Department of Laboratory Medicine using a Dade Behring\nNephelometer II Analyzer system (Dade Behring Diagnostics). The\ndetection limit of the assay was 0.2 mg/L (CV ,7.5%). Results below the\ndetection limit were coded 0.1 mg/L. CRP has been called the classic\nacute-phase reactant and has been advocated for following disease\nactivity in inflammatory conditions (41). The reference range is 0\u00ad10\nmg/L (41) and we divided participants into 3 groups as follows: #3\nCreatinine and albumin concentrations were measured in serum\nsamples by Collaborative Laboratory Services, using the Beckman\nSynchron LX20 modular chemistry side.\nSerum vitamin C (HPLC with an internal standard and electrochem-\nical detection), folate, and vitamin B-12 (Quantaphase II Folate/Vitamin\nB-12 Radioassay kit, Bio-Rad Laboratories) and plasma Hcy (Abbott\nDiagnostics, fully automated Hcy fluorescence polarization immunoas-\nsay) were assayed at the NHANES central laboratory, the Inorganic\nToxicology and Nutrition Branch of the National Center for Environ-\nmental Health's Division of Laboratory Sciences in Atlanta, GA. HPLC\nwith multi-wavelength photodiode-array absorbance detection was used\nby Craft Technologies to assay vitamins E and A and the carotenoids.\nStatistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using\nSUDAAN release 10.0 (Research Triangle Institute) with appropriate\nmasked variance units (i.e. pseudoprimary and pseudostratum) and 2-y\nsampling weights to account for the survey's complex sampling design\n(42). P , 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.\nWe first used multivariate-adjusted means (95% CI) and proportions\nCROSSTAB to describe and compare participants stratified by CRP\nconcentration and vitamin B-6 adequacy according to various partici-\npant characteristics, including demographic factors, BMI (weight/\nheight2), blood pressure, dietary and lifestyle factors, plasma Hcy, serum\nconcentrations of creatinine and vitamins, and use of nonsteroidal\nantiinflammatory drugs (NSAID). An NSAID user was any participant\nwho reported regular use of a prescription drug classified as an NSAID in\nthe prescription drug data file (43) or any of the following nonprescrip-\ntion products: aspirin, Ibuprofen, Excedrin, Vanquish, Feldene, Voltarin,\nClinoril, Indocin, Naprosyn, Alleve, and Tolectin. The multivariate\nmodel (model 1) used for these analyses included terms for basic\ndemographic factors (i.e. age, sex, and race-ethnicity), correlates of\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nvitamin B-6 intake and status (i.e. usual intakes of energy and protein)\n(44), and factors that have been linked to inflammation in studies (i.e.\nindicators of an unhealthy lifestyle) (45) (e.g. smoking and alcohol use),\nBMI, and serum creatinine (46). The distributions of serum concentra-\ntions of creatinine and vitamins were highly skewed and these values\nwere logarithmically transformed before use as outcome variables in the\nregression models. Differences among groups in subject characteristics\nwere evaluated using the Wald F test reported from the regression\nmodeling programs.\nNext, we considered whether use of supplements containing vitamin\nB-6, total vitamin B-6 intakes, and plasma PLP concentrations were\nrelated to protection against elevated serum CRP concentrations.\nAlthough our hypothesis regarding plasma PLP and inflammation was\nbi-directional, in the interest of consistency with the analyses relating\nsupplement use and vitamin B-6 intakes to serum CRP concentrations,\nwe performed these analyses using multinomial multiple logistic regres-\nsion as performed by SUDAAN PROC MULTILOG, with the 3-level\nterm for serum CRP as the categorical outcome variable. We estimated\nthe odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) using model 1 described above, and, to\nsimultaneously adjust for additional potentially confounding factors,\nafter adding terms for serum concentrations of folate, albumin, and\nantioxidant vitamins (model 2). We also performed these analyses after\nadjusting for plasma PLP. This step was aimed at evaluating the\nspecificity of the association for vitamin B-6 status, because supplements\ncontain vitamins other than vitamin B-6 and because high vitamin B-6\nintakes may be associated with high intakes of other vitamins. We also\nperformed the analysis relating plasma PLP category to serum CRP\ncategory after adjusting for total vitamin B-6 intake. The rationale\nbehind this step was to determine whether the association between\nplasma PLP category and serum CRP category was entirely explained\nby vitamin B-6 intake or whether some of the association might\nbe a reflection of the influence of inflammation on the plasma PLP\nconcentration.\nTo shed light on the hypothesis that inflammation increases the need\nfor vitamin B-6 via increased utilization of the vitamin in the inflam-\nmatory process, we attempted to determine whether the vitamin B-6\nintake that was associated with maximal prevention of vitamin B-6\ninadequacy varied with inflammation status. To accomplish this, we used\nSUDAAN PROC REGRESS and model 2 described above to estimate,\nfor participants in highest and lowest serum CRP categories, the\nmultivariate-adjusted prevalence (95% CI) of vitamin B-6 inadequacy\nP-trend for associations between vitamin B-6 intake and study\noutcomes was estimated using the medians of the vitamin B-6 intake\ncategories modeled as a continuous exposure variable.\nResults\nParticipant characteristics in relation to serum CRP and\nplasma PLP concentrations. Female gender, current smoking,\nand low serum concentrations of albumin and a variety of\nvitamins were positively associated with both inflammation and\nvitamin B-6 inadequacy (Table 1). Age was not related to either\nstudy outcome in men. However, after multivariate adjustment,\nwomen with elevated CRP concentrations were somewhat older\nthan women with CRP concentrations in the reference range and\nwomen with inadequate vitamin B-6 status were somewhat\nyounger than women with adequate status.\nNon-Hispanic Black race-ethnicity and higher Hcy concen-\ntrations were associated with inadequate vitamin B-6 status and\nBMI was positively related to inflammation.\nMarkers of vitamin B-6 status in relation to serum CRP\nconcentration. After multivariate control for demographic\ncharacteristics, lifestyle factors, BMI, serum creatinine, and\nintakes of energy and protein, use of supplements containing\nvitamin B-6 was associated with protection against markedly\nelevated CRP concentrations compared with CRP concentra-\ntions in the reference range (Table 2). This association was\ngreatly attenuated by adjustment for either plasma PLP or serum\nconcentrations of albumin and other vitamins found to be\nassociated with protection against inflammation in preliminary\nanalyses. These results suggest that the association between\nvitamin supplement use and protection against inflammation is\npartially mediated by vitamin B-6 status and partially by other\nvitamins contained in the supplements.\nThe odds of a markedly elevated CRP concentration,\ncompared with a concentration within the reference range,\ndecreased significantly with increasing vitamin B-6 intakes from\ndietary sources and supplements combined. The magnitude of\nthe inverse association between vitamin B-6 intake and this\noutcome decreased after terms for serum concentrations of\nfolate, albumin, and antioxidant vitamins were added to the\nmodel. However, consuming at least 5 mg/d of vitamin B-6, as\nopposed to consuming ,2 mg/d, remained significantly related\nto protection against a markedly elevated CRP concentration in\nall models except the one that controlled for plasma PLP\nconcentration. In other words, the association between higher\nvitamin B-6 intake and protection against a markedly elevated\nserum CRP concentration did not appear to be effected by\nconfounding by other aspects of a healthy lifestyle. Furthermore,\nthe OR obtained using model 2 additionally adjusted for plasma\nPLP was identical to that obtained using model 1 additionally\nFinally, even after controlling for all of the potentially con-\nfounding factors and vitamin B-6 intake from foods and\nsupplements combined, the OR relating a plasma PLP concen-\ntration $20 nmol/L compared with ,20 nmol/L to both\nmoderately elevated and markedly elevated serum CRP concen-\ntrations were significantly ,1.0. That is, vitamin B-6 intake did\nnot entirely explain the association between the plasma PLP\nconcentration and inflammation status, which leaves open\nthe possibility that inflammation also lowers the plasma PLP\nconcentration.\nRelationship between vitamin B-6 intake and vitamin B-6\ninadequacy by inflammation status. The prevalence of\nvitamin B-6 inadequacy decreased with increasing vitamin B-6\nintake regardless of serum CRP concentration (Fig. 1). Specif-\nically, among participants with CRP concentrations in the\nreference range, the prevalence of vitamin B-6 inadequacy was\n~20% in the subgroup with vitamin B-6 intakes ,2 mg/d (i.e.\nthe lowest intake category) compared with ,10% among those\nin higher vitamin B-6 intake categories (P , 0.01). However, the\nprevalence of vitamin B-6 inadequacy was much more common\n.10 mg/L and vitamin B-6 intakes ,5 mg/d (i.e. all intake\ncategories except the highest). In other words, whereas the\nprevalence of vitamin B-6 inadequacy was minimized at vitamin\nB-6 intakes $2 mg/d in participants with serum CRP #3 mg/L, a\ncomparably low prevalence of inadequacy was observed only at\nmuch higher vitamin B-6 intakes among participants whose\nserum CRP concentrations were markedly elevated.\nDiscussion\nOur study was primarily aimed at confirming in a large\npopulation-based survey a link between the plasma PLP\nconcentration and inflammation status. We also aimed to shed\nlight on the direction of the relationship by evaluating the\nassociation between vitamin B-6 intake and inflammation and\nVitamin B-6 and inflammation in American adults 105\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\ninvestigating how vitamin B-6 intake related to vitamin B-6\ninadequacy as inflammation status varied. The cross-sectional\ndesign of our study did not permit causal inference. However, we\nfound results that would be expected if higher vitamin B-6\nintakes protected against inflammation. We also found results\nthat would be expected if inflammation resulted in an increased\nneed for vitamin B-6.\nPrevious studies showed that low plasma PLP concentrations\nwere characteristic of people with inflammatory conditions\n(29,47,48). Furthermore, inverse relationships have been found\nbetween vitamin B-6 status and markers of inflammation in\npopulation samples (28,31,51). A cross-sectional association\nbetween low plasma PLP concentrations and inflammation\ncould mean that vitamin B-6 protects against inflammation or\nthat inflammation adversely affects vitamin B-6 status. How-\never, 1 population-based study found no association at all (11).\nMoreover, some of the positive studies, including the popula-\ntion-based Framingham Study (28), did not link vitamin B-6\nintakes to inflammation status (28,31). Such results argued\nagainst an antiinflammatory role for higher vitamin B-6 status.\nIn contrast to those studies, our study did link higher vitamin B-6\nintakes to decreased odds of inflammation and results suggested\nthat the association was not confounded by other aspects of a\nhealthy lifestyle. That the association did not remain after the\nplasma PLP concentration was adjusted for further illustrates\nthe specificity of the association for vitamin B-6 status. The\ndifference between our results and those reported in the\nFramingham study may relate to a difference in exposure,\nbecause the data used in the Framingham investigation were\nTABLE 1 Characteristics of adult NHANES 2003\u00ad2004 participants by serum CRP and plasma PLP category1\nCharacteristic\nSerum CRP categories, mg/L\nPlasma PLP categories, nmol/L\nP-value\nRace-ethnicity\nSmoking status\nNSAID user\n2 P-value from the Wald F-test.\n3 All values were estimated from multivariate models including sampling weights for applicability to the U.S. population and terms for gender, age, race-ethnicity, BMI, alcohol use,\nsmoking status, serum creatinine, and intakes of energy and protein.\n4 Participants were nonpregnant, nonlactating adults who had not been diagnosed with diabetes and were not taking oral contraceptives, estrogen-replacement therapy, or\nsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.\n5 Relative SE . 30% (i.e. the estimate of percent may be unreliable).\n6 BMI is calculated as weight in kg/height in m2.\n7 SBP, systolic blood pressure.\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\ncollected in the late 1980s, when the use of supplements was\nmuch less common than it is today (52). The mechanism by\nwhich low vitamin B-6 status might foster inflammation, or\ncertain inflammatory diseases such as CVD, is unclear. Hcy has\nbeen proposed as a likely mediator (53). However, cross-\nsectional studies, including our own, have found the inverse\nassociation between vitamin B-6 status and CRP to be indepen-\ndent of Hcy (28,31,51). Studies have also failed to support the\nidea that Hcy mediates the association between low vitamin B-6\nstatus and vascular disease (10,54). Consistent with those\nresults, low vitamin B-6 status remains a risk factor for CVD\nin the age of food folate fortification (32), but Hcy does not (55).\nIf the cross-sectional association between vitamin B-6 intake\nand inflammation status reflects a causal relationship, the\npossibility that inflammation adversely affects vitamin B-6\nstatus is not necessarily ruled out. Indeed, the association\nbetween the plasma PLP concentration and the serum CRP\nconcentration remained strong in our study even after vitamin\nB-6 intake was adjusted for. Although the finding could still\nreflect protection against inflammation by higher vitamin B-6\nintakes if plasma PLP were a better indicator of intake than the\n24-h diet recall data, an adverse effect of inflammation on\nvitamin B-6 availability is plausible. Specifically, vitamin B-6 is\nneeded for the cytokine production (23) and lymphocyte prolif-\neration (25,26) that characterize the inflammatory response. On\nthe other hand, some evidence suggests that the low plasma PLP\nconcentrations observed in the presence of inflammation do not\nreflect low vitamin B-6 status. Specifically, McMillan et al. (56\u00ad\n59) have repeatedly shown that critically ill people experiencing\ninflammation have low plasma PLP concentrations but normal\nerythrocyte PLP concentrations. Studies in our laboratory have\ncorroborated this finding (47,50) and demonstrated no correla-\ntion between the plasma PLP concentration and indicators of\nvitamin B-6 status in erythrocytes (50). We did, however, find\nthat the plasma PLP concentration reflected the availability of\nvitamin B-6 during metabolic challenges (e.g. methionine and\ntryptophan loads) better than erythrocyte PLP did (50). The low\nplasma PLP concentrations observed during inflammation could\nresult from increased vitamin B-6 utilization in the liver at the\nsame time that vitamin B-6 is used normally in erythrocytes.\nHyperhomocysteinemia is a marker of poor vitamin B-6\nfunction, because vitamin B-6 serves as a cofactor in the\nconversion of Hcy to cysteine. In the current study, ,6% of the\nparticipants with serum CRP concentrations in the reference\nrange had plasma PLP concentrations below the detection\nlimit of the assay compared with 30% of those with serum\nTABLE 2 Association between vitamin B-6 status and serum CRP concentration in U.S. adults (NHANES, 2003\u00ad2004)\nParticipants, n (% 6 SE)1\nCategories of serum CRP, mg/L\nTotal vitamin B-6 intake, mg/d\n1 Percentages are sample-weighted for applicability to the U.S. population given the complex sampling scheme.\n2 Participants were nonpregnant, nonlactating adults who had not been diagnosed with diabetes and were not taking oral contraceptives, estrogen-replacement therapy, or\nsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.\n3 All OR (95% CI) are adjusted for intake of vitamin B-6 from food.\n4 Adjusted for gender, age, race-ethnicity, BMI, smoking status, alcohol use, serum creatinine, and intakes of energy and protein.\n5 Adjusted for covariates in model 1 plus serum concentrations of albumin, folate, b-carotene, lycopene, lutein-zeaxanthin, and vitamins A and C.\nVitamin B-6 and inflammation in American adults 107\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nCRP . 10 mg/L.

That finding illustrates the clinical relevance of the\nlow plasma PLP concentrations that occur in connection with\ninflammation.\nThe vitamin B-6 intake associated with maximal prevention\nof vitamin B-6 inadequacy among participants with normal\nserum CRP was $2 mg/d compared with the current Recom-\nThese findings may be consistent with depletion/repletion\nstudies suggesting that the vitamin B-6 requirement is ~2 mg/d\n(60,61). In the subgroup with markedly elevated serum CRP\nconcentrations, the vitamin B-6 intake associated with maximal\nprevention of vitamin B-6 inadequacy was even higher. If the low\nplasma PLP concentrations associated with inflammation are\nclinically relevant, our findings are thus also consistent with the\nhypothesis that the vitamin B-6 requirement is increased in the\npresence of inflammation.\nPreventing inflammation is important because several chro-\nnic diseases of considerable public health importance are char-\nacterized by chronic inflammation (62). Preventing inflammation\nmight also help prevent America's number 1 killer, CVD (63),\nthe risk of which is increased in association with systemic\ninflammation and immune-inflammatory disease. The public\nhealth importance of inflammation may actually extend well\nbeyond its contribution to these conditions, however, because\nchronic inflammation is suspected of playing a role in other age-\nrelated diseases, including heart failure, type II diabetes, cancer,\nfrailty, cognitive decline/dementia, and osteoporosis (64).\nAn inflammation-induced reduction in the plasma PLP\nconcentration would be important because of the critical role\nthat PLP plays in immune function (25,65\u00ad68), Hcy catabolism\n(69), hemoglobin synthesis (70), neurotransmitter synthesis\n(71), and macromolecular metabolism (72,73). It accomplishes\nthese roles by acting as a cofactor for hundreds of enzymes (39).\nThe strengths of our study included the large sample, the\ncollection of dietary data in 2 24-h recalls, and the extensive\ninformation on use of drugs and supplements. The comprehen-\nsiveness of the survey also allowed us to consider many possible\nalternative explanations for our findings. Of course, residual\nconfounding by imperfect measurement of covariates or failure to\ncontrol for important but unknown confounders is always\npossible. Our study's main limitations were its cross-sectional\ndesign, the availability of a single, nonspecific (74) inflammation\nmarker, and the lack of high-quality data on chronic inflamma-\ntory diseases. Furthermore, despite the improvements in dietary\nopment of statistical methods to estimate day-to-day variation in\nintake around the time of the survey, we may not have captured\nthe relevant data if diet prior to the survey was important. Finally,\nour method of combining the usual intake of vitamin B-6 from\nfoods with data from the supplement survey instrument assumes\nthat day-to-day variation in vitamin B-6 intake from supplement\nsources is zero, which may not be the case.\nIn conclusion, our large, general-population study confirmed\nthe association between inflammation and low plasma PLP\nconcentration but challenged the notion that vitamin B-6 intake\nis unrelated to inflammation. If the associations we found reflect\ncause-and-effect relationships, higher vitamin B-6 intakes might\nbe of value in preventing inflammation and maintaining vitamin\nB-6 adequacy when inflammation is present.\n"
