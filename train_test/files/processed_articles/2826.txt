We use a German firm-level data set\nto investigate the extent to which firm-level uncertainty varies over the cycle. This allows us\nto put empirical discipline on our numerical simulations. We find that, while firm-level\nuncertainty is indeed countercyclical, it does not fluctuate enough to significantly alter the\ndynamics of an RBC model with only first moment shocks. The mild changes we do find are\nmainly caused by a bad news effect: higher uncertainty today predicts lower aggregate\nSolowresiduals tomorrow.

[...] But there is more at work. If you think that another Depres-\nsion might be around the corner, better to be careful and save more.\"\nIMF Chief Economist, Olivier Blanchard, in: The Economist, 29 January, 2009\nIs time-varying firm-level uncertainty a major cause or amplifier of the business cycle? This\npaper investigates this question in the context of a heterogeneous-firm RBC model with per-\nsistent firm-level productivity shocks and lumpy capital adjustment. We make three contribu-\ntions to the existing literature: first, we discipline the calibration of time-varying uncertainty\nas a driving force through a detailed analysis of the behavior of the cross-section of firms over\nthe cycle, rather than through stock market data; secondly, we analyze the implications of time-\nvarying uncertainty in the context of a general equilibrium framework and using the detailed\nunconditional and conditional second moment analysis of model-simulated aggregate time se-\nries that has become a standard tool in the business cycle literature; and, thirdly, we show a new\nmechanism through which uncertainty shocks have (mild) aggregate effects: a bad news effect,\nrather than the time-varying option value effect (wait-and-see) that has been highlighted thus\nthe wait-and-see-effect to be dominated by the bad news effect.\nIn the aforementioned model context, cyclical changes in uncertainty correspond naturally\nto cyclical changes in the cross-section of firms \u00ad more specifically the dispersions of change\nrates of firm-level Solow residuals, real value added and real sales. Thus, using the balance\nsheet data set of Deutsche Bundesbank (USTAN) \u00ad a private sector, annual, firm-level data set\npanel have over 30,000 firms per year on average, and which has a broad ownership, size and\nsectoral coverage \u00ad, we first show that the cross-sectional standard deviations of the firm-level\ninnovations in the Solow residual, real value added and sales are indeed robustly and signif-\nicantly countercyclical. This confirms U.S.-related findings by Bloom (2009) and Bloom et al.\n(2009) for the implied volatility of the stock market, for Compustat data on publicly traded firms\nand for sectoral data. We interpret these changes as countercyclical fluctuations in firm-specific\nproductivity uncertainty. Second, we show that for our broad German cross-section of firms the\nvolatility in uncertainty over the cycle is substantially lower than has been considered in the lit-\nerature. These two results are essentially robust to different choices for the cyclical indicator, to\nalternative calculations of the Solow residual, to various changes in the sample selection crite-\nria and to explicitly considering cyclical sample selection and measurement error in the micro\ndata. We also use IFO survey data on business expectations to confirm our findings. Figure 1 il-\nlustrates the countercyclicality of firm-level risk. It displays for Germany the annual time series\nof the dispersion of firm-level Solow residual innovations, linearly detrended, and the cyclical\ncomponent of GDP, as measured by log-HP(100) filtered aggregate output.1\nFigure 1: Time Series of the Dispersion of Firm-Level Solow Residual Innovations and the Cycli-\ncal Component of GDP\nstd( log SR\ni,t\n)\nNotes: std: cross-sectional standard deviation, linearly detrended and normalized by the average dispersion.\nHP()-Y : Cyclical component of log-GDP after HP-filtering using smoothing parameter .\nWe then explore the quantitative importance of these shocks to uncertainty in a\nheterogeneous-firm RBC model similar to the one in Khan and Thomas (2008) and Bachmann\net al. (2008). We have developed the computational techniques to study time-varying uncer-\ntainty in general equilibrium in parallel with Bloom et al. (2009). We find that uncertainty\nshocks alone - if of a size in line with our empirical evidence - do not introduce quantitatively\nsignificant business cycle fluctuations. Moreover, purely uncertainty driven business cycles\nlead to counterfactual acyclicality of aggregate consumption.\nShocks to uncertainty nonetheless modestly alter the aggregate behavior of the model if\nthey are introduced alongside standard first moment fluctuations in aggregate Solow residuals\nand compared to a model with only these first moment shocks (essentially the standard RBC\n1See Appendix B.1 for analogous figures for the time series of the dispersions of firm-level innovations to value\nadded and sales, as well as scatter plots between dispersion measures and the cyclical component of GDP\n.\nmodel). Yet, this change does not come through the real options effect often associated with\ntime-varying uncertainty. Instead, we identify a new economic channel, by which fluctuations\nin uncertainty influence the business cycle that results only from their correlation with aggre-\ngate productivity. Since changes in uncertainty empirically correlate with future developments\nin the aggregate Solow residual, the former constitute news about the latter.\nSpecifically, we find that an increase in productivity risk essentially acts as a bad news shock.\nIn general equilibrium, this means that households decrease their consumption and increase\ntheir labor supply, which we find to be consistent with the data. We also find a decrease in the\nreal wage as a result of a shock to uncertainty not only in our model but again also in the impulse\nresponse function of the data. As a result of this decrease in wages, we find \u00ad again both in the\ndata as well as in our model \u00ad an increase in economic activity at the moment of the uncertainty\nshock, followed by a recession, when the predicted downturn in productivity occurs. The effects\nof uncertainty shocks that we find in our model almost entirely operate through this channel.\nComparing a partial equilibrium version to our general equilibrium model in terms of the\nimpulse response functions of investment with respect to shocks to uncertainty illustrates this\nmechanism further. While in partial equilibrium the bad news on impact causes aggregate in-\nvestment activity to collapse, in general equilibrium, this effect is reversed by the decrease in\nthe real interest rate, such that investment rates even expand on impact and only turn negative\nas lower productivity actually realizes. Indeed, the point estimate of the empirical impulse re-\nsponse function of uncertainty on national saving is positive on impact. This shows that general\nequilibrium analysis is paramount in understanding the aggregate effects of firm-level uncer-\ntainty shocks.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our data set, the\nUSTAN data, discusses briefly the selection of the final sample and details our empirical results.\nSection 3 explains the model. Section 4 describes its calibration and Section 5 discusses the\nnumerical results. Appendices provide more details on the data set, give further robustness\nchecks for the empirical findings as well as for the simulation results.\nRelated Literature\nOver the last two decades, the economic literature has used models with fixed costs of capi-\ntal adjustment or irreversibility as a natural starting point to study the effects of uncertainty on\neconomic activity (see e.g. Dixit and Pindyck, 1994). More recently, Bloom (2009) and Bloom\net al. (2009) document that increases in stock market volatility are correlated with a reduction\nin aggregate economic activity. The former in partial equilibrium, the latter in general equilib-\nrium then provide a formal model qualitatively similar to the one used here, where an increase\nin uncertainty leads to a higher real option value of investment, letting more firms `wait and see'\nafter such an increase, which in turn leads to a fall in aggregate investment and employment. In\na similar vein and also in general equilibrium, but in a different model context, Sim (2008) puts\nforth a model that explains the cyclical patterns in firms' entry and exit with cyclical variations\nin uncertainty. Gilchrist et al. (2009) explore the implications of time-varying uncertainty for\nbond risk premia and via this channel for aggregate investment in a general equilibrium model.\nAlexopoulos and Cohen (2009) propose the `number of New York Times articles on uncertainty\nand economic activity' as an alternative measure for uncertainty shocks and find in an em-\npirical exercise that this measure of uncertainty is negatively correlated with aggregate activity.\nFinally, in a somewhat different context, Fernandez-Villaverde et. al (2009) find that increases in\ninterest rate volatility suppress real activity in small open emerging market economies in Latin\nAmerica.\nNone of the above draws its empirical evidence on broad-based cross-sectional firm data.\nThe data that is typically used is stock market data or analyst data available only for a subset\nof large publicly traded companies or even sectoral data. Using stock market data to identify\nfluctuations in productivity, however, implies strong market efficiency assumptions (see for in-\nstance Shiller, 1981). We use firm-level balance sheet data instead.2 This links the empirical\npart of this paper most closely to a series of papers by Higson and Holly et al. (2002, 2004),\n(2008). Higson and Holly et al. (2002), using Compustat data, study empirically the cyclicality\nof the standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of the sales growth rate distribution and find\nthem to be countercyclical, countercyclical and procyclical, respectively. Higson and Holly et al.\n(2004) repeat this analysis for UK data on quoted firms, and Doepke and Holly et al. (2005) for\nGermany, using the USTAN database, with similar findings. Doepke and Weber (2006) study,\nagain using USTAN data, the cyclicality of transitions between sales growth regimes in firm-\nlevel data. In contrast to these papers, we focus on the cyclicality of cross-sectional second\nmoments only, but include real value added and Solow residuals into the analysis. These are\narguably the right firm-level counterpart for GDP and aggregate Solow residuals, respectively.\nThe quantitative part of this paper draws heavily on the recent literature on heterogenous-\nfirm RBC models, developed in Khan and Thomas (2008) as well as Bachmann et al. (2008).\nFinally, this paper is related to the work by Beaudry and Portier (2006), Jaimovich and Rebelo\non business cycle dynamics. In a companion paper (Bachmann and Bayer, 2009), we focus on\nthe implications of countercyclical dispersion in the firm-level Solow residual innovations for\ncross-sectional dynamics as opposed to aggregate dynamics.\n2On the household side, using PSID data, Storesletten et al. (2004) have extensively demonstrated the counter-\ncyclicality of labor income risk. This paper fills the gap on the production side of the economy.\n2 The Facts\nIn Section 2.1 we briefly describe the USTAN data set and the main sample selection criteria\nwe use. Details are relegated to Appendix A.1. In Section 2.2 we present the baseline facts: the\ncontemporaneous correlations of cyclical aggregate output and the cross-sectional standard\ndeviations of log changes in firm-level Solow residuals, real value added and sales are negative,\nbut the cyclical variations are small, at most 1.5 times the volatility of aggregate output. In\nSection 2.3 we perform extensive robustness checks and also show, how these facts depend on\nobservable firm characteristics.\n2.1 A Brief Data Description\nUSTAN is a large annual firm-level balance sheet data base (Unternehmensbilanzstatistik) col-\nlected by Deutsche Bundesbank. It is unique in its combination of size and coverage as well as\ndetail of available variables. It provides annual firm level data from 1971 to 1998 from the bal-\nance sheets and the profit and loss accounts of over 60,000 firms per year (see Stoess (2001),\nvon Kalckreuth (2003) and Doepke et al. (2005) for further details). In the days when the dis-\ncounting of commercial bills were one of the principal instruments of German monetary policy,\nBundesbank law required the Bundesbank to assess the creditworthiness of all parties backing\na commercial bill put up for discounting. The Bundesbank implemented this regulation by re-\nquiring balance sheet data of all parties involved. These balance sheet data were then archived\nand collected into a database.\nAlthough the sampling design \u00ad one's commercial bill being put up for discounting \u00ad does\nnot lead to a representative selection of firms in a statistical sense, the coverage of the sample\nis very broad. USTAN covers incorporated firms as well as privately-owned companies, which\ndistinguishes it positively from Compustat data.3 Its sectoral coverage \u00ad while still somewhat\nbiased to manufacturing firms \u00ad includes the construction, the service as well as the primary\nsectors. This makes it different from, for instance, the Annual Survey of Manufacturing (ASM)\nin the U.S.4 The following table 1 displays the sectoral coverage of our final baseline sample.\nMoreover, while there remains a bias to somewhat larger and financially healthier firms, the\nsize coverage is still fairly broad: 31% of all firms in our final baseline sample have less than\n3Davis et al. (2006) show that studying only publicly traded firms can lead to wrong conclusions, in particular\nwhen higher cross-sectional moments are concerned. See Appendix A.1 Table 27 for ownership coverage in our\nfinal sample.\n4An additional advantage of these data is easy access: while access is on-site, it is practically free for researchers,\nso that results derived from this data base can be easily tested and checked.\n1-digit Sector Firm-year observations Percentage\n20 employees and 57% have less than 50 employees (see Table 25 in Appendix A.1 for details).\nFinally, the Bundesbank itself frequently used the USTAN data for its macroeconomic analyses\nand for cross-checking national accounting data. We take this as an indication that the bank\nconsiders the data as sufficiently representative and of sufficiently high quality. This makes the\nUSTAN data an exceptionally suitable data source for the study of cross-sectional business cycle\ndynamics.\n2.1.2 Selection of the Baseline Sample\nFrom the original USTAN data, we select only firms that report complete information on payroll,\ngross value added and capital stocks. Moreover, we drop observations from East German firms\nto avoid a break of the series in 1990. In addition, we remove observations that stem from\nirregular accounting statements, e.g. when filing for bankruptcy or when closing operations.\nWe deflate all but the capital and investment data by the implicit deflator for gross value added\nfrom the German national accounts.\nCapital is deflated with one-digit sector- and capital-good specific investment good price\ndeflators within a perpetual inventory method. Even though USTAN data can be considered as\nparticularly high quality data, we cannot directly use capital stocks as reported. Tax motivated\ndepreciation and price developments of capital goods lead to a general understatement of the\nstock of capital a firm holds. Thus, capital stocks have to be recalculated using a perpetual\ninventory method (see Appendix A.2, for details). Similarly, we recover the amount of labor\ninputs from wage bills, as information on the number of employees (as opposed to payroll data)\nis only updated infrequently for some companies (see Appendix A.3, for details). Finally, the\nfirm-level Solow residual is calculated from data on gross value added and factor inputs.\nWe remove outliers according to the following procedure: we calculate log changes in real\ngross value added, the Solow residual, real capital and employment, as well as the firm-level in-\nvestment rate and drop all observations where a change falls outside a three standard deviations\ninterval around the year-specific mean.5 We also drop those firms for which we do not have at\nleast five observations in first differences. This leaves us with a sample of 854,105 firm-year\nobservations, which corresponds to observations on 72,853 firms, i.e. the average observation\nlength of a firm in the sample is 11.7 years. The average number of firms in the cross-section per\nyear is 32,850. We perform numerous robustness checks with respect to each of the selection\ncriteria and measurement choices: we use sectoral deflators for value added, an aggregate in-\nvestment good price deflator, change the cut-off rule to 2.5 and 5 standard deviations and leave\nall firms in the sample with two and twenty observations in first differences, respectively. None\nof these choices change our baseline results (see Table 38 in Appendix B.1 for details).\n2.1.3 Solow Residual and Productivity Innovations\nWe compute the firm-level Solow residual based on the following Cobb-Douglas production\nfunction in accordance with our model:\nyi,t = zt i,t k\ni,t\nn\ni,t\n,\nwhere i,t is firm-specific productivity, and zt is aggregate productivity. We assume that\nlabor input ni,t is immediately productive, whereas capital ki,t is pre-determined and inherited\nfrom last period. In our main specification, we estimate the output elasticities of the production\nfactors,  and , as median shares of factor expenditures over gross value added within each\nindustry.6 We use log-differences in the Solow residual to capture Solow residual innovations,\nas the persistence of firm-level Solow residuals exhibits behavior close to a unit root. In order\nto check, whether our results are driven by measurement error in a difficult-to-measure driving\nforce, we also study log-differences in outcome variables: firm-level real value added and sales.\nWe remove firm fixed and sectoral-year7 effects from these first-difference variables to focus\non idiosyncratic fluctuations that do not capture differences in sectoral responses to aggregate\nshocks or permanent ex-ante heterogeneity between firms.8 We focus on the cross-sectional\n5This outlier removal is done after removing firm and sectoral fixed effects. Centering the outlier removal\naround the year mean is important to avoid artificial and countercyclical skewness of the respective distributions.\n6To check the robustness of our results, we try alternative specifications with predefined elasticities common\nacross sectors. We also change the timing assumption to include a predetermined employment stock, as well as\nimmediate adjustment in both factors. All results are very robust to the alternative ways to generate the firm-\nspecific Solow residual (see Table 31 Appendix B.1 for details).\n7The sectoral fixed effects are essentially computed at the 2-digit level, see Table 24 in Appendix A.1 for details.\n8 Specifically, we decompose a variable observed of firm i in sector j at time t into firm a fixed effect i , a\nsectoral time effects j t and an idiosyncratic unpredictable error term i j t , which are orthogonal to each other\nxi j t = x\ni\n+x\nj t\n+x\ni j t\n.\nWe then focus on the error term i jt .\ndispersion of these three variables and measure the dispersion in terms of standard deviations.9\nIn a standard model with ex-ante homogenous firms, these standard deviations characterize\nthe uncertainty or risk of a firm with regard to its idiosyncratic productivity growth. In line with\nBloom (2009) and Gilchrist et al. (2009) \u00ad has modeled fluctuations in idiosyncratic uncertainty\nas fluctuations in the standard deviation of firm-specific innovations in the Solow residual. We\nfollow this view and study the quantitative aggregate importance of fluctuations in the cross-\nsectional dispersion of productivity innovations.\nWhen combining this micro data with aggregate data, we have to take a stance on the sectoral\naggregate that is the empirical counterpart to our model. We chose to include firms from the\nfollowing six sectors in our analysis: agriculture, mining and energy, manufacturing, construc-\ntion, trade (both retail and wholesale) as well as the transportation and communication sector.\nThis aggregate can be roughly characterized as the non-financial private business sector (NF-\nPBS) in Germany. Whenever we use the term aggregate in the following, we mean this sector.\nGerman national accounting data per one-digit sector (see Appendix A.1, Footnote 49, for\na detailed description of the data sources used) allow us to compute real value added, invest-\nment, capital and employment data for this sectoral aggregate, and therefore also an aggregate\nSolow residual. Our USTAN sample captures on average 70% of sectoral value added and 78%\nof sectoral real gross output (sales). The NFPBS, in turn, comprises 59% and 69%, respectively,\nof aggregate real value added and real gross output.\nIn addition to representing a large part of the non-financial private business sector in Ger-\nmany, USTAN also represents its cyclical behavior very well, as the following Table 2 shows:10\nCross-sectional Moment (\u00b7,HP(100)-Y ) (\u00b7,Log -di f f -Y )\nNotes: mean: cross-sectional average, linearly detrended. : time series correlation coefficient.\nHP()-Y : Cyclical component of aggregate log-GDP after HP-filtering using smoothing parameter . Y refers to\nthe output of the aggregate of the non-financial private business sector.\n9The baseline within-transformed cross-sectional data for these dispersions can be found in Table 30 in Ap-\npendix A.5.\n10We further illustrate the good representation properties of USTAN in Appendix A.1.\n2.2 Main Facts: Idiosyncratic Productivity Risk \u00ad Large and Countercyclical\nUsing the micro data from USTAN, we can compute the cross-sectional dispersions for inno-\nvations in firm-level Solow residuals, real value added and real sales. We analyze both their\ntime-averaged long-run as well as their cyclical properties. Table 3 presents our main results:\nCross-sectional Moment cv(\u00b7) (\u00b7,HP(100)-Y ) \u00b5(\u00b7)\nNotes: std: cross-sectional standard deviation, linearly detrended. cv: time series coefficient of variation. \u00b5: time\nseries average. See further notes to Table 2.\n\u00b7 The time-averaged cross-sectional standard deviation of the log-changes in firm-level\nSolow residuals is large: 12%. In contrast, the volatility of the linearly detrended aggre-\ngate Solow residual is 2.06%, i.e. an order of magnitude smaller; the one for the linearly\ndetrended cross-sectional average Solow residual 2.37%.11 This also means that firm-\nspecific productivity risk is an order of magnitude larger than in Kahn and Thomas (2008)\nas well as Bloom et al. (2009) who, without the discipline of firm-level data, are using for\nthe standard deviation of the innovations to firm-level Solow residuals in their models:\n\u00b7 The cross-sectional standard deviation of the innovations to firm-level Solow residuals\nis countercyclical with a correlation coefficient with HP-filtered aggregate GDP of -0.481.\nTable 4 shows that this countercyclicality is significant, as the 5% and 95% confidence\nbands from 10,000 parametric bootstrap simulations are both negative.12 The last column\nof Table 4 displays the fraction of positive correlations in these bootstrap simulations.\n\u00b7 The size of annual fluctuations in risk is relatively small, with a time-series coefficient of\n11This order-of-magnitude difference also suggests that the fluctuations-in-uncertainty-story has to be likely one\nabout idiosyncratic productivity, rather than aggregate productivity. Firms' policy functions are mainly determined\nby the idiosyncratic state given this difference, and fluctuations in anyway small aggregate risk do not seem to be\na plausible candidate for business cycle fluctuations. In addition, we find for the cyclical components of aggregate\nquarterly output and employment in Germany that moving-window volatility estimates as well as the squared\nresiduals from AR(1) regressions are essentially uncorrelated with the cycle.\n12We use a pairwise unrestricted VAR with one lag as the parametric model. The results from a nonparametric\noverlapping block bootstrap with a block size of four are similar to the parametric bootstrap.\nFor comparison, Bloom et al. (2009) find a correlation of their stock market-based uncer-\ntainty index with GDP of -0.606. Gourio (2008), using Compustat data, finds the correlation\nbetween GDP and the standard deviation of the innovation to a permanent productivity shock\nto be - 0.56.13 Thus our finding aligns well in this point with previous work. For the size of\nthe fluctuations, there is little previous evidence. In his numerical simulations, Bloom (2009)\nconsiders a productivity process for monthly data, which exhibits a time-series coefficient of\nvariation of the dispersion in annual productivity growth of roughly 17%.\nOne could be concerned that the Solow residual does not measure productivity well. For\nthis reason, we provide evidence also from log-differences in endogenous outcome variables,\nnamely real value added and real sales. As balance sheet items these are arguably less subject to\nmeasurement error.14 Using these indirect measures makes no difference: their cross-sectional\ndispersions are large on average, they are significantly countercyclical, but their business cycle\nfluctuations are small.\nCross-sectional Moment (\u00b7,HP(100)-Y ) 5% 95% Frac. w. opposite sign\nNotes: The columns 5% and 95% refer to the top and bottom 5-percentiles in a parametric bootstrap of the correla-\ntion coefficient. The last column displays the fraction of simulations with the opposite sign of the point estimate.\nSee further notes to Tables 2 and 3.\nTwo questions arise: first, are these results sensitive to the choice of the cyclical indicator and\nthe dispersion measure used? Secondly, are they driven by sample composition or cyclical sam-\nple selection? We show they are not.\nCyclical Indicator and Dispersion Measure\nThe following Table 5 shows that countercyclical idiosyncratic uncertainty as measured by\nthe cross-sectional dispersion of firm-level Solow residual innovations is robust to the choice of\nthe cyclical indicator (for std(log yi,t ) and std(logsalesi,t ) see Table 32 in Appendix B.1).\n13Interestingly, Comin and Mulani (2006), using also Compustat data, find procyclicality of a moving-standard\ndeviation estimator of firm-level risk in real sales innovations.\n14Bachmann and Bayer (2009) show that when looking at inputs, log-changes in firm-level employment are sim-\nilarly countercyclical, firm-level investment rates are strongly and significantly procyclical.\nINDICATOR\nCyclical Indicator (std(log i,t ),\u00b7)\nNotes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3. N refers to aggregate employment.\nThe result stands irrespective of whether we choose as cyclical indicators output filtered\nusing a smaller smoothing parameter for the HP filter, following Ravn and Uhlig (2002), apply a\nlog-difference filter to output, or use the linearly detrended average cross-sectional investment\nrate, or the HP(100)-filtered aggregate employment, or aggregate Solow residuals.\nVice versa, as Table 6 shows, our three findings are also robust to the numerous choices we\nhave made for the other part of the correlation, std(log i,t ), for instance (for std(log yi,t )\nand std(logsalesi,t ) see Table 33 in Appendix B.1). For instance, one can use the interquartile\nrange (iqr) as the dispersion measure. Moreover, it is not the removal of firm-level and sectoral\nfixed effects that induces the countercyclicality, as row three of this table shows. Finally, the last\ntwo rows demonstrate that the results are neither driven by the German reunification, nor by\nCross-sectional Moment cv(\u00b7) (\u00b7,HP(100)-Y ) \u00b5(\u00b7)\nNotes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3. iqr stands for interquartile range, which is linearly detrended.\nSample Composition\nUSTAN is no random sample. Consequently, we need to check whether our findings are\nspecific to certain sectors or types of firms overrepresented in this sample. Our findings for\nstd(log i,t ) in Tables 7 to 915 are twofold: on the one hand, we find that qualitatively our em-\npirical results hold across various observable characteristics; on the other hand, we also show\nthat, quantitatively, using data sets that overrepresent large or publicly traded firms or are lim-\nited to manufacturing, as is the case with most U.S. data sets, one may overstate the cyclical\nfluctuations in firm-level uncertainty.\nCross-sectional Moment cv(\u00b7) (\u00b7,HP(100)-Y ) (\u00b7,HP(100)-Y Sect.) \u00b5(\u00b7)\nNotes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3.

Y refers to the\noutput of the aggregate of the non-financial private business sector. Y Sect. refers to the output of the corresponding\nsector.\nTable 7 displays the behavior of productivity risk for the six single-digit sectors in the USTAN\nsample. The relatively large idiosyncratic risk is obviously not specific to any sector, in fact the\nnumbers are surprisingly uniform across sectors. When one disregards the small agricultural\nsector, average productivity uncertainty ranges from 11.2% in the construction sector to 13.6%\nin the transportation and communication sector. For the two sectors that comprise almost 90%\nof all firm-year observations in the data \u00ad manufacturing and trade \u00ad also the countercyclicality-\nof-uncertainty result is robust.16 Finally, also the result that risk fluctuations are not large is\nrobust across sectors (again with the exception of the small mining and energy sector). Manu-\nfacturing and construction exhibit somewhat larger risk fluctuations, but the difference to both\nthe trade sector and the aggregate is small.\nThe non-random design of USTAN manifests itself not only in the sectoral but also the size\ncomposition of the sample. To understand the effect of this, we split the sample according to\nfirm size, as measured by employment. Again this yields no different results. Table 8 shows\nthat large firms exhibit a somewhat smaller average uncertainty that fluctuates more than the\nuncertainty of small firms, but overall the results are surprisingly uniform across size classes.17\n16Had we used Log-diff-Y as the cyclical measure for the trade sector, the countercyclicality indicator would be\n-0.474, and -0.455 in the case of Log-diff-Solow Residual. Moreover, the acyclicality of uncertainty in the construc-\ntion sector, when the own sectoral output is used, goes away, when instead we use the average sectoral Solow\nCross-sectional Moment cv(\u00b7) (\u00b7,HP(100)-Y ) \u00b5(\u00b7)\nNotes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3. First Quartile refers to the smallest 25% firms in a given year, Second Quartile to\nthe firms with size in the 25%-50% range, etc., if size is measured in employment.\nNevertheless, it shows that using data sets, which suffer from an even stronger overrepre-\nsentation of large firms, such as Compustat, may lead to an overstatement of the cyclical fluc-\ntuations in firm-level uncertainty. A similar point is made in Table 9, where we split the sample\naccording to a broad definition of legal form. Again, the publicly traded firms, which are also\ntypically large, are slightly different from the aggregate.\nCross-sectional Moment cv(\u00b7) (\u00b7,HP(100)-Y ) \u00b5(\u00b7)\nNotes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3.

As we have shown, this can be dealt with by splitting the sample along\nobservable characteristics. The possibility of systematic cyclical variation in sample selection,\nfor instance through firm entry and exit, poses a more severe problem to our analysis.\ntively, for the six sectors.\n17We tried alternative splits according to the stock of capital and real value added. The results are very similar,\ndetails can be found in Table 35 in Appendix B.1. Numbers for the dispersions of innovations to firm-level value\nadded and sales across size classes are available on request. We also studied a stratification according to firm-level\nproductivity and found the same results. Again, details are available on request.\nWe address the issue of cyclical sample selection in two different ways: in a first pass, we\nconstrain our sample to those firms which we observe at least 20 times in the sample; secondly,\nwe estimate a simple selection model, where lagged firm-level Solow residuals determine selec-\ntion and firm-level Solow residual innovations are modeled as a mean regression.\nCross-sectional Moment cv(\u00b7) (\u00b7,HP(100)-Y ) \u00b5(\u00b7)\nWhen we constrain our sample to those firms which we observe at least 20 times (see Ta-\nble 10), we find the same countercyclical pattern in productivity risk as in the baseline sam-\npling with a higher volatility of uncertainty. The advantage of this sample is that its selection\nis by construction less subject to cyclical fluctuations. Its disadvantage is that the non-cyclical\nselection bias becomes stronger and the sample covers more large, publicly traded firms. This\npartly drives our finding, as the second procedure below shows.\nAlternatively, we control for sample selection in the following way: we estimate a simple\nselection model, where lagged firm-level Solow residuals determine selection. Productivity lev-\nels are a natural determinant of market entry and exit. Firm-level Solow residual innovations\nare modeled as a mean regression. Lagged firm specific Solow residuals are excluded from\nthis mean regression as productivity is highly persistent and thus lagged levels do not predict\nchanges. We use the maximum likelihood estimator by Heckman (1976) to infer the selection-\ncorrected standard deviation of the residual in the reduced-form regression for firm-level Solow\nresidual innovations. The correlation between the latter and the sample standard deviation of\nfirm-level Solow residual innovations is 0.972, indicating that our results are not influenced by\nsystematic sample selection. Table 11 shows that this indeed is the case.\nCross-sectional Moment cv(\u00b7) (\u00b7,HP(100)-Y ) \u00b5(\u00b7)\nNotes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3.\nOn the basis of these two pieces of evidence \u00ad robustness of our results to a sample with\nsurviving firms and a high correlation between selection-corrected and sample standard devia-\ntions of firm-level Solow residual innovations \u00ad we conclude that cyclical sample attrition is not\ncentral to our findings.18\nMeasurement Error\nIn any Solow residual calculation that is based on a simple Cobb-Douglas production func-\ntion with only labor and capital, there is the potential problem of attributing optimal changes in\nutilization, hours per worker or effort to random productivity changes and therefore of overstat-\ning (average) firm-level risk. Therefore we focus in Table 12 on those firms who did not change\nthe intensity of their material usage between two periods, assuming that observed changes in\nmaterial usage are a good proxy for unobserved changes in utilization (see Basu, 1996, for this\nidea). These firms indeed exhibit a somewhat smaller productivity risk that fluctuates slightly\nmore in relative terms than the productivity risk of the average firm in the sample. The mea-\nsured countercyclicality of idiosyncratic uncertainty is smaller,19 but overall our results carry\nover to this group of firms.\nCross-sectional Moment cv(\u00b7) (\u00b7,HP(100)-Y ) \u00b5(\u00b7)\nNotes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3. Material Intensity const. refers to firms whose material expenditures over\nsales mi,t\nsalesi,t\nhave changed by less then one percentage point in absolute terms. Results for std(log yi,t ) and\nstd(logsalesi,t ) can be found in tables 37 in Appendix B.1.\nMore generally, we take measurement error at the micro level into account in the follow-\ning way: Assuming additive classical measurement error in firm-level log-Solow residuals and\nlog-value added and a time-invariant measurement error variance in both, we can use the time-\naverage of the difference between the one-period innovation to observed firm-level log-Solow\nresiduals/log-value added and half the variance of the two-period innovations to estimate the\nvariances of measurement error for both quantities. Subtracting this number (twice) from the\nobserved variance of one-period innovations yields an estimate of the true variance of the inno-\n18We also investigated whether the time-average and the cyclical behavior of firm-level fixed effects is large\nenough to indicate systematic cyclical sample selection as a problem. We did not find that it is. Details are available\non request.\n19The decline happens, irrespective of the cyclical measure used, but its magnitude is somewhat sensitive to the\nchoice of the cyclical measure. For instance, had we used Log-diff-Y, the decline would have been from -0.583 to\nvations. In other words, we obtain the variance of the measurement error from a permanent-\ntransitory decomposition of changes in productivity. This means, we attribute all temporary\nchanges in firm-level log-Solow residuals/log-value added to measurement error. For this rea-\nson one should view the obtained numbers as upper bounds. Table 13 shows that the cycli-\ncality measure for firm-level uncertainty is basically unaffected, but that its fluctuations might\nbe somewhat underestimated when measurement error is not taking into account. Conversely,\nthe last column of Table 13 shows that part of the observed cross-sectional dispersion in inno-\nvations to both firm-level Solow residuals and value added might be measurement error. Nev-\nertheless, even when measurement error is taking into account, idiosyncratic uncertainty is\nsignificantly larger than aggregate volatility.\nCross-sectional Moment cv(\u00b7) (\u00b7,HP(100)-Y ) \u00b5(\u00b7)\nNotes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3. Corrected refers to the standard deviation corrected for measurement error,\nas explained in the main text.\n2.4 External Validation\nIn this section we use an additional data set to confirm the countercyclicality of firm-level un-\ncertainty. Specifically, we make use of survey evidence on firms's general six-month-ahead busi-\nness outlook from the IFO institute in Germany to validate our findings from the USTAN data\nset. One of the items in this monthly business survey is: \"Expectations for the next six months:\nour business situation with respect to XY20 will, in a cyclical view, improve, remain about the\nsame, develop unfavorably.\". There is a widespread literature which argues that (qualitative)\nsurvey disagreement is a good proxy for true firm-level uncertainty, see, for instance and for\nan overview, Fuss and Vermeulen (2004). We make use of this idea and compute a firm-level\nuncertainty index as follows, where p+\nt\ndenotes the fraction of firms that see their business out-\nlook improve in a given month, and p-\nt\nthe fraction of firms that see their business outlook\ndeteriorate:\nUncer taint yIFO\nt\n= p+\nt\n+ p-\nt\n-(p+\nt\n- p-\nt\n20The IFO survey is at the product category level, multiproduct firms can fill out more than one questionnaire.\nIf all responders think their business situation will improve, this index will be minimized at\nzero, if they split in half about their business outlook, this index will be maximized at unity.\nTwo issues arise, when comparing the IFO evidence to the USTAN data. First, the IFO insti-\ntute conducts this survey in four major sectors: manufacturing, construction, retail and whole-\nsale. Due to limited data availability in the German system of national accounting we combined\nthe latter two into one trade sector for the analysis of the USTAN data. However, as Table 24\nin Appendix A.1 shows, roughly 60% of the USTAN observations in the trade sector are from\nwholesale, which is why we use the IFO wholesale data in our comparison with the USTAN trade\nsector. Secondly, the IFO data are available on a monthly basis \u00ad looking six months ahead \u00ad,\nwhereas the USTAN are annual. Thus, some time aggregation of the uncertainty index is nec-\nessary. We use the simple year average of Uncer taint yIFO\nt\ndisplays our findings:22\nSector (std(log i,t ),Uncer taint yIFO) (Uncer taint yIFO,HP(100)-Y )\nNotes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3.\nIt shows in the first column the correlation between the dispersion of USTAN firm-level\nSolow Residual innovations and the IFO uncertainty index, and the correlation between the\nlatter and the cyclical component of aggregate output in the second column. The correlation\nbetween the two measures of firm-level uncertainty is remarkably high, in particular for the\nmanufacturing sector, which the majority of the firms in the IFO survey belong to.23 Given the\nsmaller numbers of firms in the construction and the trade sector, which is further complicated\nby the imperfect match to the USTAN trade sector, a small decline in correlation there is not\nsurprising. And the second column shows again the very consistent countercyclicality of this\nalternative firm-level uncertainty measure. These findings give us further confidence in the\nrobustness of our findings in the USTAN data set.\n21We experiment with semi-annual and differently timed averages as well as the June uncertainty index of a given\nyear. The results are robust\n22Figure 14 in Appendix B.1 displays the appropriately normalized time series of the dispersion of firm-level\nSolow residual innovations from USTAN and the IFO uncertainty index for the manufacturing, construction and\nwholesale sectors. The comove remarkably well.\n23According to IFO personnel there are, on average, roughly 3400 firms from manufacturing, 1900 from retail and\nwholesale and 1100 from construction participation in the survey every month.\nIn Table 38 in Appendix B.1 we provide further robustness checks for our results. In all these\nrobustness checks we find a strongly countercyclical productivity risk with relatively small cycli-\ncal fluctuations in this risk. Next, we explore the quantitative implications of our three findings:\nlarge idiosyncratic uncertainty, countercyclical fluctuations in and relatively low volatility of\nthis uncertainty, in a heterogeneous firm dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with\nfixed cost of capital adjustment.\n3 The Model\nIn this section we describe our model economy. We start with the firm's problem, followed by\na brief description of the households and the definition of equilibrium. We conclude with a\nsketch of the equilibrium computation. Our model follows closely Khan and Thomas (2008)\nand Bachmann et al. (2008). Since there the model set up is discussed in detail, we will be\nrather brief here.\nThe main departure from either papers is the introduction of a second exogenous aggregate\nstate. Following Bloom (2009) we assume that firms today observe the standard deviation of the\ndistribution of idiosyncratic productivity shocks tomorrow, ( ). Following Khan and Thomas\n(2008), we approximate this now bivariate aggregate state process with a discrete Markov chain.\nThe economy consists of a unit mass of small firms. We do not model entry and exit decisions.\nThere is one commodity in the economy that can be consumed or invested. Each firm produces\nthis commodity, employing its pre-determined capital stock (k) and labor (n), according to the\nfollowing Cobb-Douglas decreasing-returns-to-scale production function ( > 0,  > 0,  + <\ny = z kn, (1)\nwhere z and denote aggregate and firm-specific (idiosyncratic) technology, respectively.\nThe idiosyncratic technology process has autocorrelation I . It follows a Markov chain,\nwhose transition matrix depends on the aggregate state of its time-varying standard deviation,\n( ). In contrast, its support is independent of the aggregate state. To also capture observed\nexcess kurtosis in the idiosyncratic productivity shocks, we use a mixture of two Gaussian dis-\ntributions in the Tauchen-approximation algorithm instead of the usual normal distribution.24\nWe denote the trend growth rate of aggregate productivity by (1-)(-1), so that aggregate y\nand k grow at rate -1 along the balanced growth path. From now on we work with k and y (and\nlater C) in efficiency units. The linearly detrended logarithm of aggregate productivity levels as\nwell as linearly detrended ( ) evolve according to a VAR(1) process, with normal innovations v\nthat have zero mean and covariance :\nlogz\n( )- \u00af\n( )\n= A\nlogz\n( )- \u00af\n( )\nwhere \u00af\n( ) denotes the steady state standard deviation of idiosyncratic productivity inno-\nProductivity innovations at different aggregation levels are independent. Also, idiosyncratic\nproductivity shocks are independent across productive units. In contrast, we do not impose\nany restrictions on  or A  R2\u00d72.\nEach period a firms draws from a time-invariant distribution, G, its current cost of capital\nadjustment,   0, which is denominated in units of labor. G is a uniform distribution on [0, \u00af\n],\ncommon to all firms. Draws are independent across firms and over time, and employment is\nfreely adjustable.\nAt the beginning of a period, a firm is characterized by its pre-determined capital stock, its\nidiosyncratic productivity, and its capital adjustment cost. Given the aggregate state, it decides\nits employment level, n, production and depreciation occurs, workers are paid, and investment\ndecisions are made. Then the period ends.\nUpon investment, i, the firm incurs a fixed cost of , where  is the current real wage rate.\nCapital depreciates at a rate . We can then summarize the evolution of the firm's capital stock\n(in efficiency units) between two consecutive periods, from k to k , as follows:\nFixed cost paid k\nGiven the i.i.d. nature of the adjustment costs, it is sufficient to describe differences across\nfirms and their evolution by the distribution of firms over ( ,k). We denote this distribution by\n\u00b5. Thus, z,( ),\u00b5 constitutes the current aggregate state and \u00b5 evolves according to the law\nof motion \u00b5 = (z,( ),\u00b5), which firms take as given.\n25Specifying this process in terms of log ( ) , in order to avoid negativity of the standard deviation of idiosyn-\ncratic productivity shocks is \u00ad given its high steady state value and relatively low variability \u00ad an unnecessary pre-\ncaution that does not change the results. Simulation results are available upon request.\nNext we describe the dynamic programming problem of each firm. We will take two short-\ncuts (details can be found in Khan and Thomas, 2008). First, we state the problem in terms of\nutils of the representative household (rather than physical units), and denote by p = p(z,( ),\u00b5)\nthe marginal utility of consumption. Second, given the i.i.d. nature of the adjustment costs,\ncontinuation values can be expressed without explicitly taking into account future adjustment\ncosts.\nLet V 1( ,k,;z,( ),\u00b5) denote the expected discounted value--in utils--of a firm that is in\nidiosyncratic state ( ,k,), given the aggregate state (z,( ),\u00b5). Then the expected value prior\nto the realization of the adjustment cost draw is given by:\nV 0( ,k;z,( ),\u00b5) =\n\u00af\n\nV 1( ,k,;z,( ),\u00b5)G(d). (3)\nWith this notation the dynamic programming problem is given by:\nV 1( ,k,;z,( ),\u00b5) = max\nn\n{CF+max(Vno adj,max\nk\n[-AC+Vadj])}, (4)\nwhere CF denotes the firm's flow value, Vno adj the firm's continuation value if it chooses inaction\nand does not adjust, and Vadj the continuation value, net of adjustment costs AC, if the firm\nadjusts its capital stock. That is:\nCF = [z kn -(z,( ),\u00b5)n]p(z,( ),\u00b5), (5a)\nVno adj = E[V 0( ,(1-)k/;z ,( ),\u00b5 )], (5b)\nAC = (z,( ),\u00b5)p(z,( ),\u00b5), (5c)\nVadj = -ip(z,( ),\u00b5)+E[V 0( ,k ;z ,( ),\u00b5 )], (5d)\nwhere both expectation operators average over next period's realizations of the aggregate and\nidiosyncratic shocks, conditional on this period's values, and we recall that i = k - (1 - )k.\nAlso,  denotes the discount factor of the representative household.\nTaking as given (z,( ),\u00b5) and p(z,( ),\u00b5), and the law of motion \u00b5 = (z,( ),\u00b5), the\nfirm chooses optimally labor demand, whether to adjust its capital stock at the end of the pe-\nriod, and the optimal capital stock, conditional on adjustment. This leads to policy functions:\nN = N( ,k;z,( ),\u00b5) and K = K ( ,k,;z,( ),\u00b5). Since capital is pre-determined, the optimal\nemployment decision is independent of the current adjustment cost draw.\nWe assume a continuum of identical households that have access to a complete set of state-\ncontingent claims. Hence, there is no heterogeneity across households. Moreover, they own\nshares in the firms and are paid dividends. We do not need to model the household side in\ndetail (see Khan and Thomas (2008) for the details), and concentrate instead on the first-order\nconditions to determine the equilibrium wage and the marginal utility of consumption.\nHouseholds have a standard felicity function in consumption and (indivisible) labor:\nU(C,Nh) = logC - ANh, (6)\nwhere C denotes consumption and Nh the household's labor supply. Households maximize the\nexpected present discounted value of the above felicity function. By definition we have:\np(z,( ),\u00b5) UC (C,Nh) =\nC(z,( ),\u00b5)\nand from the intratemporal first-order condition:\n(z,( ),\u00b5) = -\nUN (C,Nh)\np(z,( ),\u00b5)\n=\nA\np(z,( ),\u00b5)\n3.3 Recursive Equilibrium\nA recursive competitive equilibrium for this economy is a set of functions\n,p,V 1,N,K ,C,Nh, ,\nthat satisfy\n1. Firm optimality: Taking , p and  as given, V 1( ,k;z,( ),\u00b5) solves (4) and the corre-\nsponding policy functions are N( ,k;z,( ),\u00b5) and K ( ,k,;z,( ),\u00b5).\n2. Household optimality: Taking  and p as given, the household's consumption and labor\nsupply satisfy (7) and (8).\n3. Commodity market clearing:\nC(z,( ),\u00b5) = z kN( ,k;z,( ),\u00b5)d\u00b5 -\n\u00af\n\n[K ( ,k,;z,( ),\u00b5)-(1-)k]dGd\u00b5.\n4. Labor market clearing:\nNh(z,( ),\u00b5) = N( ,k;z,( ),\u00b5)d\u00b5 +\n\u00af\n\nJ K ( ,k,;z,( ),\u00b5)-(1-)k dGd\u00b5,\nwhere J (x) = 0, if x = 0 and 1, otherwise.\n5. Model consistent dynamics: The evolution of the cross-section that characterizes the econ-\nomy, \u00b5 = (z,( ),\u00b5), is induced by K ( ,k,;z,( ),\u00b5) and the exogenous processes for\nz, ( ) as well as .\nConditions 1, 2, 3 and 4 define an equilibrium given , while step 5 specifies the equilibrium\ncondition for .\nAs is well-known, (4) is not computable, since \u00b5 is infinite dimensional. Hence, we follow\nKrusell and Smith (1997, 1998) and approximate the distribution \u00b5 by its first moment over\ncapital, and its evolution, , by a simple log-linear rule. In the same vein, we approximate the\nequilibrium pricing function by a log-linear rule discrete \u00ad aggregate state by discrete aggregate\nstate:\nlog \u00af\nk =ak z,( ) +bk z,( ) log \u00af\nlogp =ap z,( ) +bp z,( ) log \u00af\nwhere \u00af\nk denotes aggregate capital holdings. Given (8), we do not have to specify an equilibrium\nrule for the real wage. As usual with this procedure, we posit this form and check that in equilib-\nrium it yields a good fit to the actual law of motion. We use this simple forecasting rule because\nit is much less computationally involved than a rule that includes higher moments of the capi-\ntal distribution. In models without second moment shocks, it has been extensively shown that\nthe first moment suffices. Unfortunately, we show here that the pure R2 goodness-of-fit metric\ndoes not favor the simple rule (9a): R2 below 0.9 are possible, as we shall see in Section 5.2.\nHowever, we show for our baseline calibration that the aggregate dynamics of the economy are\nhardly affected, when higher moments of the capital distribution are included and the R2 are\npushed closer to unity (see Bachmann et al. (2008) for a similar observation). Therefore, we\nprefer the increase in computational speed and report our results, unless otherwise noted, with\nthe first moment only as a state variable.\nCombining these assumptions and substituting \u00af\nk for \u00b5 into (4) and using (9a)\u00ad(9b), we\nhave that (4) becomes a computable dynamic programming problem with policy functions\nN = N( ,k;z,( ), \u00af\nk) and K = K ( ,k,;z,( ), \u00af\nk). We solve this problem via value function\niteration on V 0.\nWith these policy functions, we can then simulate a model economy without imposing the\nequilibrium pricing rule (9b), but rather solve for it along the way. We simulate the model\neconomy for 1,600 time periods and discard the first 100 observations, when computing any\nstatistics. This procedure generates a time series of {pt } and {\u00af\nkt } endogenously, with which as-\nsumed rules (9a)\u00ad(9b) can be updated via a simple OLS regression. The procedure stops when\nthe updated coefficients ak z,( ) and bk z,( ) , as well as ap z,( ) and bp z,( ) are\nsufficiently close to the previous ones. We skip the details of this procedure, as this has been\n4 Calibration\nThe model period is a year \u00ad in congruence with the data frequency in USTAN. The following\nparameters have standard values:  = 0.98 and  = 0.094, which we compute from German\nnational accounting data for the sectoral aggregate that the USTAN sample corresponds to: the\nnon-financial private business sector. Given this depreciation rate, we pick  = 1.014, in order to\nmatch the time-average aggregate investment rate of 0.108. This number is also consistent with\nGerman long-run growth rates. The log-felicity function features an elasticity of intertemporal\nsubstitution (EIS) of one. The disutility of work parameter, A, is chosen to generate an average\ntime spent at work of 0.33: A = 2 for the baseline calibration.\nwhich correspond to the measured median labor and capital shares in manufacturing in the\nUSTAN data base (see Appendix A.4). While our data also include a considerable amount of\nfirms from other sectors, any weighted average or median of these shares would still be close to\nthe manufacturing values, which is why we decided to use them in our baseline calibration.26\nNext, we have to choose the parameters of the two-state aggregate shock process. Here we\nsimply estimate a bivariate, unrestricted VAR with the linearly detrended natural logarithm of\n26If one views the DRTS assumption as a mere stand-in for a CRTS production function with monopolistic com-\npetition, than these choices would correspond to an employment elasticity of the underlying production function\n+\n= 1.31.

We have experimented with both elasticities\nquite a bit, but have not found any of our main results depending on them. Details are available on request.\nthe aggregate Solow residual27 and the linearly detrended ( )-process from the USTAN data.28\nThe parameters of this VAR are as follows:29\nA =\n =\nWhen measurement error in firm-level Solow residuals is taken into account, as specified in\nSection 2.3, the driving force looks as follows:\nA =\n =\nThis process is discretized on a [5 \u00d7 5]-grid, using a bivariate analog of Tauchen's proce-\ndure. We measure the steady state standard deviation of idiosyncratic technology innovations\nas \u00af\nover our time horizon \u00ad,30 and since the adjustment cost parameter \u00af\n will be identified by the\nkurtosis of the firm-level investment rate (next to its skewness), we want to avoid attributing\nexcess kurtosis in the firm-level investment rate to nonlinearities in the adjustment technology,\nwhen the driving force itself has kurtosis. Hence, we incorporate the measured excess kurtosis\ninto the discretization process for the idiosyncratic technology state.31 Finally, we set I = 0.95,\nin accordance with the high persistence of Solow residual innovations in the data. This process\nis discretized on a 19-state-grid, using Tauchen's procedure with mixed Gaussian normals.\nGiven the aforementioned set of parameters ,,, A,,, A,, \u00af\n( ),I , we then calibrate\nthe adjustment costs parameter \u00af\n to minimize a quadratic form in the normalized differences\nbetween the time-average firm-level investment rate skewness produced by the model and the\ndata, as well as the time-average firm-level investment rate kurtosis:32\n28After firm-level and sectoral fixed effects have been removed.\n29With a slight abuse of notation, but for the sake of readability,  displays standard deviations on the main diag-\nonal and correlations on the off diagonal. We also estimate a seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) specification\nof this bivariate VAR and use it for simulation. This specification mitigates somewhat the obvious problems with\nestimating a bivariate VAR with 7 independent parameters from 2\u00d726 data points. We show that both the actual\nestimates of the remaining VAR parameters as well as the implications for our simulation results are remarkably\nrobust. Results can be seen in Table 40 in Appendix B.2.\n30We find no skewness.\n32The normalization constants in (12) are, respectively, the time series standard deviation of the investment rate\nskewness and the time series standard deviation of the investment rate kurtosis.\nmin\n\u00af\n\n(\u00af\nT t\nskewness(\nii,t\n)(\u00af\n+\nT t\nkur tosis(\nii,t\n)(\u00af\nAs can be seen from (12), the distribution of firm-level investment rates exhibits both sub-\nument a similar fact for U.S. manufacturing plants.

(2009), but also\nas a news shock in the spirit of Beaudry and Portier (2006), Jaimovich and Rebelo (2008), Sims\n(2008) as well as Schmidt-Grohe and Uribe (2008). Upon observing an increase in idiosyncratic\nuncertainty today, households and firms rationally expect a future decrease in productivity ce-\nteris paribus.\nTo disentangle the effects from the news about productivity contained in movements in\nidiosyncratic uncertainty, we solve a variant of our model where the actual risk that firms face\nremains constant over time at \u00af\n( ) = 0.1201, but firms still observe a time-varying state, s, as a\nvariable without further economic content that nonetheless contains information about future\nproductivity as in (2). The parameters that describe the law of motion of s are the same as\nin (2) and (10), i.e. as in the model with time-varying uncertainty. More generally, we can re-\nparameterize the model for the standard deviation of idiosyncratic productivity shocks, ( ), as\nfollows:\n( ) = \u00af\n( )+ s - \u00af\n( ) .\nFor  = 0, idiosyncratic uncertainty remains constant and in the following we use the term\n`News Model' to describe this parametrization. The second state no longer influences actual\nrisk, but only the conditional expectation of future aggregate Solow residuals, z . The baseline\nspecification in which idiosyncratic uncertainty fluctuates as well is termed `Full Model',  = 1.\nUsing an  > 1 we can scale up the fluctuations in idiosyncratic uncertainty without changing\nthe underlying dynamics of the exogenous state variables, i.e. keeping the news content of s\nconstant. Moreover, for comparison we consider a model with a standard univariate AR(1) pro-\ncess for the aggregate Solow residual, `RBC Model', and a specification, where the only driving\nforce of business cycles are shocks to idiosyncratic uncertainty, `Risk Model'.34\n5.1 Baseline Results\nOur main set of quantitative results can be summarized as follows: 1) Fluctuations in idiosyn-\ncratic uncertainty alone do not produce business cycle dynamics as observed in the data. 2)\nAdding orthogonal shocks to idiosyncratic uncertainty into a model with first-moment shocks\nto aggregate Solow residuals hardly changes the business cycle dynamics of the model. 3)\nAdding shocks to idiosyncratic uncertainty that comove with aggregate Solow residuals in a\n34 The estimated autocorrelation of the aggregate Solow residual is 0.5259 and the standard deviation of its inno-\nway observed in the data produces mild changes in the business cycle dynamics of the model,\nwhich we attribute to the bad news effect that uncertainty shocks have for aggregate produc-\ntivity in the future. This bad news effect is embodied in the negative VAR coefficient (see 10) of\ntomorrow's (but known today) firm-level uncertainty on tomorrow's aggregate Solow residual.\nRisk Model\nMoment/Aggregate Quantity Y C I N\nBaseline\nMeasurement error in i,t\nNotes:\nBusiness cycle statistics of aggregate output, Y , consumption C, investment I and employment N.

The first numbers in a column refer to a simulation of the model over T =\n1500 periods. Numbers in brackets refer to German aggregate NFPBS data (see Appendix A.1, Footnote 49, for a\ndetailed description of sources). Volatility is percentage standard deviation. Persistence refers to the first order\nautocorrelation.\nTable 16 shows that the pure `Risk Model', in which the only driving force of business cycles\nis fluctuations in uncertainty, yields little fluctuations. Output fluctuations are almost eight\ntimes smaller than in the data, investment fluctuations just below 50% of the volatility in the\ndata. The uncertainty fluctuations in the data are simply too small \u00ad with a time series coef-\nficient of variation of 2.67% \u00ad to generate realistic business fluctuations. This finding is only\nmildly changed, when measurement error in firm-level Solow residuals is taken into account\nas described in Section 2.3. Even though the coefficient of variation of uncertainty fluctuations\nnow increases by roughly three quarters to 4.72%, aggregate fluctuations become only some-\nwhat stronger. We also note that general equilibrium price movements are partly responsible\nfor this low volatility, as the volatility of output, investment and employment increases, respec-\ntively, to 0.63%, 4.28% and 0.63%, i.e. more than doubles in a simulation, where we fix real\nwages and real interest rates to their average value from the general equilibrium simulation.35\nThis shows that general equilibrium is important for understanding the aggregate implications\nof idiosyncratic uncertainty innovations and that previous work in partial equilibrium might\nhave neglected an important channel. Finally, in terms of contemporaneous correlations with\noutput, pure uncertainty shocks lead to a counterfactual de-coupling of consumption and out-\nput, which is accompanied by negative correlations between consumption on the one hand and\ninvestment and employment on the other. We conclude that uncertainty shocks alone cannot\nproduce business cycles in an flexible price and market clearing model, augmented with per-\nsistent idiosyncratic productivity shocks and fixed capital adjustment costs.\nWe also experimented with mechanically and counterfactually doubling and quadrupling\nthe uncertainty fluctuations, ( = 2 and  = 4), and found that this leads to an almost linear in-\ncrease in all volatilities of the pure `Risk Model', whereas persistence and correlations with out-\nput and consumption are practically unchanged.36 This is a perhaps surprising finding: just as\nwith first moment shocks, increasing the volatility of idiosyncratic shocks essentially amounts\nto re-scaling the model generated fluctuations. Consequently, we would need to observe un-\ncertainty fluctuations that are roughly eight times as large as the fluctuations we observe in\nthe data, in order for fluctuations in idiosyncratic uncertainty alone to produce realistic output\nvolatility. This number would then be close to the volatility of uncertainty that based on stock\nmarket data has been suggested by Bloom (2009) for the U.S.: roughly 17%. However, it is un-\nlikely that we underestimate the risk fluctuations by such an order of magnitude. In fact, as we\nhave shown, the volatility of firm-level uncertainty only increases by a factor of 1.75 when mea-\nsurement error is accounted for. Moreover, none of our different sample splits or robustness\nchecks find an increase in the volatility of uncertainty by more than a factor of two relative to the\nbaseline specification. To the contrary, as Table 7 in Section 2.3 shows, the service sector \u00ad still\nunderrepresented in the USTAN data \u00ad exhibits less volatile uncertainty fluctuations than the\ngoods-producing industries. Thus we should expect to have over- rather than underestimated\nthe volatility of uncertainty fluctuations for the overall economy, especially if we extrapolate to\nother countries like the U.S., where it is well-known that the tertiary sectors comprise a much\nlarger share of aggregate output and employment in the U.S., compared to Germany.\nRisk Model and RBC Model\nAlthough we do not find realistic business cycles caused by uncertainty fluctuations alone,\nthey might well alter more standard first-moment-driven cycles. Therefore, as a next step, we\nbriefly compare the `Risk Model' with the simple `RBC Model',37 and include a specification,\n35These numbers are not reported in a table. Details for the partial equilibrium case are available on request.\n36This holds for both specifications, i.e. with and without measurement error. Details are available on request.\n37We keep the calibrated adjustment costs fixed across the variants for the driving process. This is justified, since\nRBC-Risk RBC Risk\nCombination Model Model Data\nVolatility\nVolatility of aggregate variables relative to output volatility\nPersistence\nContemporaneous Correlation with Aggregate Output\nContemporaneous Correlation with Aggregate Comsumption\nNotes: See notes to Table 16. `RBC-Risk Combination' refers to a simulation, where we simply combine the two\nunivariate processes for aggregate Solow residuals and idiosyncratic uncertainty, as specified in Footnote 34.\nwhere we mechanically combine the two univariate processes for aggregate Solow residuals\nand idiosyncratic uncertainty, as specified in Footnote 34. This variant is referred to as `RBC-\nRisk Combination'. It gives a first indication, whether second-moment shocks as found in firm-\nlevel data can alter the aggregate dynamics of a standard `RBC Model'. Table 17 shows that this\nis \u00ad with one small exception \u00ad not the case: the `RBC Model' displays second-moment statistics\nvery similar to the combined one: `RBC-Risk Combination'. Not even the notoriously too high\ncontemporaneous output correlations are significantly mitigated by this second, independent\nshock. Put differently, the characteristic features of the `Risk Model' vanish as soon as uncer-\nthey were calibrated to the steady state investment rate distribution, which is at least numerically invariant to the\nspecification of the driving process. That means, by the `RBC Model' we really mean a model with fixed capital\nadjustment costs and shocks to aggregate Solow residuals only. De facto, however, the calibrated adjustment cost\nlevel is so low that our baseline model is in the neutrality range explored by Khan and Thomas (2008).\ntainty shocks are combined with standard aggregate Solow residual innovations. Only the con-\ntemporaneous correlations between aggregate consumption on the one hand and aggregate\ninvestment and employment on the other are pushed downward, closer to the data.\nPerhaps surprisingly, the overall volatility of the `RBC Model' is too high, relative to the data.\nIn Table 20 in Section 5.2 we show that fixing the excess volatility of the model by re-scaling the\nvolatility of the first-moment shock \u00ad to give the second moment shock maximum chance \u00ad so\nas to match the observed volatility of aggregate output does not change our main results.\nOtherwise, the `RBC Model' displays the well-known and typical failures: low persistence,\ntoo high contemporaneous correlations with output and the wrong mix between relative con-\nsumption and investment volatility, the former being too low, the latter too high. What matters\nhere that neither the `Risk Model' alone nor, as we shall see, in combination with first-moment\nshocks fixes these failures in a satisfying manner. Of course, there are well-known additions to\nthe `RBC Model', such as quadratic adjustment costs for capital on top of the fixed ones, or sim-\nply higher fixed adjustment costs, that would help to ameliorate its performance, but we aim\nhere for cleanliness of exposition and view these issues as mainly orthogonal to the question,\nwhether shocks to idiosyncratic uncertainty matter for aggregate dynamics.\nFull Model and News Model\nIntegrating our empirical findings a bit further into the model simulations, we extend the\ndriving process (2) such that it incorporates the correlation structure between firm-level uncer-\ntainty and aggregate Solow residuals found in the data. We proceed in three steps. First, we\nintroduce in the `RBC Model' the aggregate driving process estimated in the data, (10), but set\n = 0, i.e. s has no actual implications for firm-level uncertainty. Also, we allow firms' policy\nfunctions to depend only on aggregate productivity z. We call this specification `Naive Model',\nbecause firms could actually use s to get better forecasts about aggregate productivity. Second,\nwe lift the latter assumption and allow firms to condition their optimal policy on s as well as z.\nThe state s still has no implications for firm-level uncertainty, it merely helps to forecast aggre-\ngate productivity tomorrow. This variant \u00ad the aforementioned `News Model' \u00ad adds the news\ncharacter of uncertainty fluctuations to the model. Third, we explore the effect of uncertainty\nfluctuations, setting  = 1. This specification is called `Full Model'.\nComparing `Full Model' and `RBC Model', we find that the standard business cycle statistics,\nvolatilities, autocorrelations and correlations, change only modestly, see Table 18. As for au-\ntocorrelations, most of the change is mechanically due to the different driving process, as the\npersistence improvements happen, even when agents do not use the news content of uncer-\ntainty shocks (`Naive Model'). The same holds partially true for the increase in the volatility of\naggregate output.38 In other words, the excess volatility in output, featured in the `RBC Model',\n38Of course, in general equilibrium this change is not purely mechanical, because the change in aggregate dy-\nnamics alters the Krusell-Smith rules, and therefore there is an indirect effect of news on agents' decisions.\nFull News Naive RBC ME-Full ME-News\nModel Model Model Model Data Model Model\nVolatility\nVolatility of aggregate variables relative to output volatility\nPersistence\nContemporaneous Correlation with Aggregate Output\nContemporaneous Correlation with Aggregate Consumption\nNotes: See notes to Table 16.

ME designates the measurement error specification from equation (11).\nis actually exacerbated when introducing the further state s. However, not all differences are\nmechanic to the driving process. We can see that agents using the information content of the\nsecond underlying state leads to altered relative volatilities, which is marked by the change from\nthe `Naive Model' to the `News Model'. Yet only in the case of the relative volatility of employ-\nment, the `Full Model' actually brings improvement over the `RBC Model'. However, the overall\nchange from the `RBC Model' to the `Full Model' is not due to the specific nature of the sec-\nond state being time-varying uncertainty and thus generating time-varying option values, but\nrather due to its news character for aggregate productivity: changes in uncertainty alter the con-\nditional expectations of aggregate productivity. Hence, an increase in risk acts as a (bad) news\nshock. This bad news is embodied in the negative VAR coefficient of tomorrow's (but known to-\nday) firm-level uncertainty on tomorrow's aggregate Solow residual, see (10).39 Finally, the last\npanel of Table 18 shows almost no changes in the contemporaneous correlations with output\nand consumption. In particular, there is no decrease in the notoriously too high `RBC Model'\ncorrelation coefficients, something that one might have hoped for with the introduction of a\nsecond aggregate shock. In summary, there is little difference between the `Full Model' and\nthe `News Model'. This finding is robust to measurement error on the micro side, as the last two\ncolumns of Table 18 show. Figure 2 illustrates this further by simply plotting a time series trajec-\ntory of aggregate output simulations from both models for an identical bivariate shock series.\nBoth time series look very similar.\nFigure 2: Comparison of the `Full Model' and the`News Model'\nTime Path of Aggregate Output\nFull Model\nNews Model\nTime Path of Aggregate Output - Measurement Error\nNotes: Raw aggregate output from simulations of the `Full Model' and the`News Model'.\nUncertainty Shocks as News Shocks\nTo further understand the mechanisms behind the effect of shocks to idiosyncratic uncer-\ntainty, we run a series of trivariate SVARs with one lag, where we augment the aggregate Solow\nresidual (ordered first) and the idiosyncratic uncertainty (ordered second) by a third variable:\naggregate output, the aggregate investment rate, aggregate consumption, aggregate saving, ag-\n39We also estimate a SUR specification of this bivariate VAR and use it for simulation. We show that most of\nthe changes between the `RBC Model' and the `Full/News Model' are mainly due to the interaction effect between\naggregate Solow residuals and firm-level uncertainty. Results can be seen in Table 40 in Appendix B.2\ngregate employment and hours as well as the real wage.40 We estimate these SVARs both from\nboth `Full Model' and `News Model'. With a series of impulse response functions, we show\nfirst that `Full Model' and `News Model' are practically indistinguishable in their conditional\nresponses to shocks to idiosyncratic uncertainty.41 Secondly, we also show that \u00ad for the most\npart \u00ad model and data impulse responses look very much alike, i.e. our model replicates the\nempirical aggregate dynamics resulting from a shock to uncertainty. Finally, these impulse re-\nsponses are exactly like the impulse responses to a bad news shock in a standard RBC model\nwith King-Rebelo-Plosser preferences (see Beaudry and Portier, 2006, Jaimovich and Rebelo,\n2008 and Sims, 2008): output and investment increase, consumption decreases. The intertem-\nporal wealth effect increases labor supply and this depresses the real wage. As the figures below\nshow, all these findings are robust to measurement error in the firm-level Solow residual.\nFigure 3: Impulse Response of Aggregate Output to a Shock in Idiosyncratic Uncertainty\nBaseline\nData\nFull\nNews\nMeasurement Error\nData\nFull\nNews\nNotes: Impulse response functions from SVAR estimations of the linearly detrended aggregate Solow residual (or-\ndered first), the linearly detrended idiosyncratic uncertainty (ordered second) and HP(100)-filtered aggregate out-\nput (ordered third). The dotted lines reflect 95% confidence bounds for the estimates from the data from 10,000\nbootstrap replications. Estimates from data are in red, estimates from simulated data in blue (`Full Model') and\ngreen (`News Model'), respectively. Estimates from simulated data are the average of 60 impulse response func-\ntions estimated on 60 independent time series of T = 26, the length of our sample.\n40We use a simple Cholesky decomposition, assuming the aggregate Solow residual has an instantaneous effect\non idiosyncratic uncertainty but not vice versa. This is to identify a pure innovation in contemporaneous uncer-\ntainty. Notice that studying SVARs in this context is really studying and comparing an interesting summary statistic\nbetween data and models. There is nor claim on causal empirical identification.\n41The impulse responses with respect to an innovation to the aggregate Solow residual are available on request.\nExcept for the general excess volatility of our baseline calibration, data and model impulse responses are very\nsimilar and theoretically reasonable. We take this as a good sign that our impulse responses with respect to a\nsecond-moment shock are estimated reasonably well despite the short sample problems.\nFigure 3 displays the impulse response of aggregate output to a shock to idiosyncratic un-\ncertainty. On impact, output goes up after an increase in uncertainty (larger dispersion of firm-\nlevel productivity innovations in the following period), both in the model and in the data. So,\nrather than causing an immediate recession, as has been argued in the literature on uncertainty\nshocks thus far, a shock in idiosyncratic uncertainty causes a boom in output on impact. Then\nthe bad news is realized and the economy goes into a recession.\nFigure 4: Impulse Response of the Aggregate Investment Rate and Aggregate Consumption to a\nShock in Idiosyncratic Uncertainty\nAggregate Investment Rate\nData\nFull\nNews\nAggregate Consumption\nData\nFull\nNews\nAggregate Investment Rate - ME\nData\nFull\nNews\nAggregate Consumption - ME\nData\nFull\nNews\nNotes: See notes to Figure 3.

The aggregate investment rate is the sum of NFPBS investment di-\nvided by the average of the beginning-of-period and end-of-period aggregate capital stocks in NFPBS.\nThe left-hand panel of Figure 4 shows a similar expansion in the model aggregate invest-\nment rate as a response to an uncertainty shock, which is at least qualitatively consistent with\nthe data, given the wide confidence bands around the downward sloping point estimate.42 Of\ncourse, the impulse response of aggregate investment features the excess volatility we have dis-\ncussed above. In contrast, the right-hand panel of Figure 4 illustrates that the opposite is true for\nthe undershooting impulse response of aggregate consumption, which declines after a shock\n42An SVAR with aggregate investment instead of the aggregate investment rate shows a positive point estimate\nwith similarly wide confidence bands.\nto idiosyncratic uncertainty, because agents anticipate through it lower aggregate productivity\nand therefore wealth in the future. One can (re-)interpret the quote by Blanchard from the in-\ntroduction in this context: higher uncertainty leads to a fall in consumption through a wealth\neffect, which in turn shifts the supply of funds curve outward, lowering the real interest rate and\nthus causing an investment increase on impact (of course in the current situation the economy\nhas arguably been hit also by contemporaneous negative first moment shocks, which is why we\nwould not necessarily observe this investment increase). Notice, however, that this is a very dif-\nferent mechanism from the wait-and-see interpretation of uncertainty increases that has been\nproposed in the literature and that operates through time-varying real option values.\nFigure 5: Impulse Response of National Saving to a Shock in Idiosyncratic Uncertainty\nBaseline\nData\nFull\nNews\nMeasurement Error\nData\nFull\nNews\nNotes: See notes to Figure 3. In this figure, HP(100)-filtered saving is ordered third.\nFigure 5 shows this increase of saving in the model as well as the data response. Of course,\nGermany is an open economy, and, thus, the impulse response of saving is really the correct\ndata counterpart of the impulse response of saving/investment in the model. An open econ-\nomy means that aggregate investment can be financed from abroad and that the transmission\nof the wealth effect onto investment is mitigated. The open economy response of aggregate in-\nvestment is therefore closer to the negative partial equilibrium response that we show below in\nFigure 6: Impulse Response of the Aggregate Employment and Aggregate Hours to a Shock in\nIdiosyncratic Uncertainty\nAggregate Employment\nData\nFull\nNews\nAggregate Hours\nData\nFull\nNews\nAggregate Employment - ME\nData\nFull\nNews\nAggregate Hours - ME\nData\nFull\nNews\nNotes: See notes to Figure 3.

Employment in the model includes the amount of labor used to adjust\nthe firms' capital stocks.\nFigure 7: Impulse Response of the Real Wage to a Shock in Idiosyncratic Uncertainty\nBaseline\nData\nFull\nNews\nMeasurement Error\nData\nFull\nNews\nNotes: See notes to Figure 3. In this figure, the HP(100)-filtered real wage is ordered third. The real wage is aggregate\nreal payroll divided by the number of workers.\nConsistent with the wealth effect both the data and the model impulse responses display an\nincrease in aggregate employment, whether it is measured in the data by number of workers or\naggregate hours (since the model features indivisible labor, this distinction is meaningless for\nthe model). This increase in aggregate labor inputs \u00ad and the output boom that is entailed \u00ad is\nmade possible by a decline in the real wage. The labor market response, which is typical for a\nbad news shocks under standard preferences, is shown in Figures 6 and 7, respectively.\nThe final piece of the chain of arguments is displayed in Figure 8, which demonstrates that\nthe expansion in the aggregate investment rate as a response to a shock to idiosyncratic un-\ncertainty is a general equilibrium effect. The increase in investment is absent in partial equi-\nlibrium, where we hold constant both wages and interest rates at their average level from the\ngeneral equilibrium simulation. With no increase in aggregate saving and thus a decrease in the\nreal interest rate, the expectation of lower future productivity drives down the expected return\non capital and hence investment.\nFigure 8: Impulse Response of the Aggregate Investment Rate to a Shock in Idiosyncratic Un-\ncertainty - GE vs. PE\nBaseline\nFull-GE\nNews-GE\nFull-PE\nNews-PE\nMeasurement Error\nFull-GE\nNews-GE\nFull-PE\nNews-PE\nNotes: See notes to Figures 3 and 4. `GE' stands for general equilibrium and means a model simulation with market\nclearing wages and interest rates. `PE' stands for partial equilibrium and means a model simulation, where wages\nand interest rates are held constant at the average level in the `GE'-simulation.\nTo summarize: quantitatively realistic uncertainty shocks have bad news effects in general\nequilibrium, and it is this news effect that dominates the time-varying real option value effect.\nThis shows again that general equilibrium is paramount to understanding the aggregate impli-\ncations of shocks to idiosyncratic uncertainty.\n5.2 Robustness Checks\nFull ME-Full News ME-News\nModel Model Model Model Data\nVolatility\nVolatility of aggregate variables relative to output volatility\nPersistence\nContemporaneous Correlation with Aggregate Output\nContemporaneous Correlation with Aggregate Consumption\nNotes: See notes to Table 16.\nIn this subsection we provide robustness checks for our simulation results along two di-\nmensions. First, we double the volatility of firm-level uncertainty, while keeping its steady state\nmore volatile firm-level uncertainty measure than we. While our empirical results are not con-\nsistent with  = 7, they are consistent with a doubling of the volatility of uncertainty. We explore\nthis here. Second, we re-scale the volatility of the aggregate Solow residual so that the cyclical\ncomponent of aggregate output in the model matches roughly the volatility of aggregate output\nin the data, in order to make sure that our results are not driven by the general excess volatil-\nity generated by the baseline specification. In particular, it could be that we falsely place too\nmuch weight on first-moment shocks by overestimating their volatility. None of these changes\noverturn our results, whether we control for measurement error or not. We display a further\nrobustness check in Table 39 in Appendix B.2, where we more than triple the adjustment costs\nparameter, \u00af\n, and set it to unity. This is to check whether higher nonconvex adjustment costs\ncould give the wait-and-see effect are larger role. We find that this is not the case.43\nIf we increase the fluctuations in uncertainty, setting  = 2, the difference between `Full\nModel' and the `News Model' becomes somewhat larger, see Table 19. Interestingly, the overall\nvolatility of the model decreases, the one of output from 4.04% to 3.84%, while the relative stan-\ndard deviations are fairly robust to . This is a result of the mechanism highlighted in Bloom\net al. (2007): when uncertainty increases firms react less to first moment shocks. We show here\nthat this effect survives general equilibrium price movements. The performance of the `Full\nModel' in terms of persistence is actually slightly worsened, while the contemporaneous corre-\nlation of consumption and output, investment as well as employment drops to levels closer to\nThe next robustness check concerns re-scaling the volatility of the aggregate Solow residual\nby a factor of 0.6 in the `Full Model', in order to approximately match the observed volatility\nof cyclical aggregate output in the data. We keep this re-scaling factor the same for the `News\nModel' and the `RBC Model'. Despite the reduced importance of the first-moment shock both\nthe absolute and the relative volatilities of the `Full Model' and the `News Model' remain very\nsimilar. As before in the case of an increased volatility of the firm-level uncertainty \u00ad which is\nessentially a weakening of the first-moment shock from the other side \u00ad, we see a deterioration\n(with the exception of consumption) in the persistence numbers, but an improvement in the\ncontemporaneous correlation of consumption and output in the `Full Model' compared to the\ndata.\n43We performed other robustness checks with respect to choices for the risk aversion parameter, I ,  and .\nDetails are available on request.\n44We also experimented with  = 4. The changes we find for  = 2 are enforced. However, persistence of aggre-\ngate investment and employment as well as the contemporaneous correlations between consumption on the one\nhand and investment and employment on the other drop to counterfactually low levels. Moreover, Bachmann and\nBayer (2009) show that  = 4 is clearly incompatible with the procyclicality of investment dispersion found in the\nmicro data.\nFull ME-Full News ME-News RBC\nModel Model Model Model Model Data\nVolatility\nVolatility of aggregate variables relative to output volatility\nPersistence\nContemporaneous Correlation with Aggregate Output\nContemporaneous Correlation with Aggregate Consumption\nNotes: See notes to Table 16.

All findings are robust to including measurement error in the firm-level Solow residual.\nNumbers are available on request.\n6 Discussion and Conclusion\nThis paper studies the cyclical behavior of the second moments of the cross-sections of firm-\nlevel innovations to Solow residuals, real value added and real sales. We show that firm-specific\nSolow residual innovations (likewise innovations in value added and sales) are more disperse\nin recessions than in booms. Thus, firm-level uncertainty is significantly and robustly counter-\ncyclical in the way Bloom (2009) finds this for U.S. stock market and Compustat data. We also\nshow that the volatility of uncertainty is lower than has been previously found in this U.S. data.\nWe then explore the quantitative importance of these uncertainty fluctuations in an other-\nwise standard heterogeneous-firm dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in the spirit\nof Khan and Thomas (2008) and Bachmann et al. (2008). We find that empirically realistic fluc-\ntuations in uncertainty about productivity growth on their own are not sufficient to generate\nrealistic business cycles. Adding the second moment shocks to a model that has standard first\nmoment shocks, we find that some aspects of the cyclical behavior of the model are altered. For\nthe size of uncertainty fluctuations that we find in German firm-level data, we attribute these\nchanges largely to the (bad) news uncertainty shocks carry about future aggregate productivity,\nrather than to the wait-and-see-effect of such fluctuations. In this context, we also find that\ngeneral equilibrium price dynamics are paramount in understanding the aggregate effects of\nfirm-level uncertainty shocks.\nTo sum up our findings: uncertainty shocks do not appear to be major drivers of year-to-year\nbusiness cycle fluctuations. This, however, leaves open the possibility that uncertainty shocks\nare responsible for some particular episodes of the business cycle, recessions specifically. For\ninstance, one may wonder whether the recession in 2007 was driven by an uncertainty shock\nand a wait-and-see amplification? The following Table 22 suggests that at least for the U.S. this\ndoes not seem to be the case. It displays for various investment and consumption categories\nthe percentage peak-trough decline of the 2007 recession relative to the average percentage\npeak-trough decline of the nine other post-war U.S. recessions. It is obvious that the 2007 re-\ncession is amongst the most severe in U.S. post-war history; all macroeconomic aggregates fell\nby an above-average amount. However, investment and durable consumption decreased by\nrelatively less than nondurable consumption categories. Whereas the former declined between\ntwice and thrice as much as in the average recession, the latter declined fivefold or twelvefold,\ndepending on the specific measure used. Also, whereas all durable categories saw some de-\ncline in previous recessions (in seven out of ten durable consumption at the NBER trough was\nlower than durable consumption at the NBER peak), the nondurable categories exhibited only\nin roughly half of the recessions any decline at all. This obviously includes the 2007 recession.\nAll these statistics together show that the 2007 recession was especially severe for nondurable\nconsumption categories, whereas an uncertainty shock combined with a wait-and-see amplifi-\ncation would at least suggest a particular severity for the durable expenditure elements. In fact,\nthe massive decline in nondurable consumption expenditures is rather consistent with a bad\nnews shock. Of course, this leaves open the possibility that other recessions in the past were\ndriven by the mechanism advocated in Bloom et al. (2009).\nRelative Decline # Declines # Declines\nin this Crisis Peak-to-Trough\nNotes: Total Fixed Investment is GPDIC96 from the St. Louis FRED database; Nonresidential Fixed Investment PN-\nFIC96; Durable Consumption PCDGCC96; Nondurable Consumption PCNDGC96; Services PCESVC96. All vari-\nables are real and in quarterly frequency. The first column reports the percentage peak-trough decline of the 2007\nrecession relative to the average percentage peak-trough decline of the nine other post-war U.S. recessions. Peak\nand trough are defined by the official NBER recession dates. For the 2007 recession, we assume the trough to be in\nthe second quarter of 2009 owing to the lack of further data. The second column reports the number of recessions,\nwhere the particular macroeconomic aggregate at the NBER trough was below its value from the NBER peak. The\nthird column reports the number of declines in the particular macroeconomic aggregate in a recession. There are\n10 post-war recessions in the U.S.\nIn a companion paper (Bachmann and Bayer, 2009), using cross-sectional firm dynamics,\nwe provide further indirect evidence that the magnitude of uncertainty shocks over the busi-\nness cycle cannot be too large. We document there that the firm-level investment rates display\nsignificantly and robustly procyclical dispersion. We explain this fact through a procyclical ex-\ntensive margin effect caused by lumpy capital adjustment. However, we also demonstrate there\nthat increasing the volatility of firm-level uncertainty beyond the levels we find in the data miti-\ngates this procyclical extensive margin effect. This allows us to bound the volatility of firm-level\nuncertainty at at most double the value we measure in our baseline empirical specification.\nSince we base our results on German data, we leave open the possibility that shocks to un-\ncertainty are a major driving force for the business cycle in the U.S. Bayer and Juessen (2009)\nfind for the cyclicality of wage risk striking differences between the U.S. and Germany, with the\nformer displaying countercyclicality (see also Storesletten et al., 2004) and the latter procyclical-\nity. Thus, there is the possibility of a fundamental difference between the German and the U.S.\nbusiness cycle, and we encourage future research in this cross-country dimension. However,\nTable 22 and the finding that the service sector displays less strong countercyclicality of firm-\nlevel uncertainty together with the fact that this sector is larger in the U.S. than in Germany sug-\ngest otherwise. This is confirmed by Bachmann and Sims (2009), which uses monthly sectoral\nsurvey data, i.e. higher frequency data than balance sheet information, on business expecta-\ntions in Germany and the U.S. to show that disagreement in survey responses \u00ad a well-known\nproxy for uncertainty \u00ad acts like a bad news shock in both countries without any evidence for\nwait-and-see. We finally leave open the possibility that the dispersion shocks we measure in\nthe data can be a source of aggregate fluctuations in a significantly altered model environment;\nfor instance one, where the asset markets and their volatility are more explicitly modeled (see\nteresting mechanism \u00ad the leverage cycle \u00ad where uncertainty shocks have to accompany first-\nmoment shocks to transform `bad news' into `scary news'. We thus view future research into the\nprecise interaction between uncertainty and aggregate dynamics as desirable.\nReferences\n[1] Alexopoulos, M. and J.

When a commer-\ncial bank wished to pledge a commercial bill of exchange to the Bundesbank, the commercial\nbank had to prove the creditworthiness of the bill. For that purpose the bank had to provide\nthe Bundesbank with balance sheet information of all parties who backed the bill of exchange.\nBy law, the Bundesbank could only accept bills backed by at least three parties known to be\ncreditworthy. This procedure allowed the Bundesbank to collect a data set with information\nstemming from the balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts of firms (see Stoess (2001),\nQuality standards of the data are particularly high. All mandatory data collected for USTAN\nhave been double-checked by Bundesbank staff. Hence, the data should contain unusually few\nerrors for a micro-data set. One drawback of USTAN is that with the introduction of the EURO,\nthe Bundesbank stopped buying commercial bills and collected firm balance sheet data only\nirregularly and from publicly available sources. For this reason, the data set stops being useful\nThe coverage of the sample is broad, although it is technically not a representative sam-\nple due to the non-random sample design. It was also more common to use bills of exchange\nin manufacturing and for incorporated companies, which biases our data somewhat towards\nthese kinds of firms. And, of course, the Bundesbank would only rediscount bills with a good\nrating, so that the set of firms in USTAN is also somewhat biased to financially healthy and\nlarger firms.\nNevertheless, USTAN covers a wide range of firms, since short-term financing through com-\nmercial bills of exchange was common practice for many German companies across all busi-\nness sectors (see Table 24 below for the detailed sectoral composition of our final sample). US-\nTAN also has a broad ownership coverage ranging from incorporated firms as well as privately\nowned companies, which distinguishes it from the Compustat data. Within the former group\nUSTAN covers both untraded corporations (e.g. limited liability firms, GmbH) as well as pub-\nlicly held companies (AG) \u00ad see Table 27 below. Finally, USTAN features also a relatively broad\nsize coverage, as we will show in Table 25 below for our final sample, the creation of which we\ndescribe in some detail now.\nWe start out with the universe of observations in the USTAN data, merging the files for\ne.g. bankruptcy or closing balance sheets, or stem from a holding (Konzernbilanz). This leaves\nus with only regular balance sheets (Handelsbilanz or Steuerbilanz). We also drop all firms\nwith missing payroll data and missing or negative sales data, which are basically non-operating\nfirms. A small amount of duplicate balance sheets is removed as well. And finally, we drop the\nfollowing sectors: hospitality (hotels and restaurants), which has only a small amount of firms\nin the database, financial and insurance institutions, the mostly public health and education\nsectors, as well as other public companies like museums, etc. and some other small service in-\ndustries, such as hair cutters, dry cleaners and funeral homes;47 or when sectoral information\nwas missing. The sectoral aggregate we are studying can be roughly characterized as the non-\nfinancial private business sector in Germany. This leaves us with an initial data set of 1,764,846\nFrom this initial data set we remove step-by-step more observations, in order to get an eco-\nnomically reasonable data set. We first drop observations from likely East German firms to\navoid a break of the series in 1990. We identify a West German firm as a firm that has a West\nGerman address or has no address information but enters the sample before 1990. Then we\nrecompute capital stocks with a modified perpetual inventory method (PIM) and employment\nlevels. In the modified PIM we drop a small amount of observations from the top and bottom\nof the distribution of correction factors for the initial capital stock, see Appendix A.2. Extreme\ncorrection factors indicate that constant depreciation is not a good approximation for this par-\nticular firm. Such a firm will have had an episode of extraordinary depreciation (e.g. fire, a\nnatural disaster, etc.) and the capital stocks by PIM will be a bad measure of the actual capital\nafter the disaster. We remove observations that do not have a log value added and a log capital\nstock after PIM. Another large part is removed due to not featuring changes in log firm-level\nemployment, capital and real value added, which obviously requires us to observe firms for two\nconsecutive years. Then we remove outliers in factor changes and real value added changes.\nSpecifically, we identify as outliers in our sample a firm-year in which the firm level investment\nrate or log changes in firm-level real value added, employment and capital stock fall outside\na three standard deviations band around the firm and sectoral-year mean. Then we compute\nfirm-level Solow residuals (see Appendix A.4 for details) and similarly remove observations with\nmissing log changes in Solow residuals as well as outliers therein. We finally remove \u00ad before and\nafter each step of the outlier removal \u00ad firms that have less than five observations in firm-level\nSolow residual changes. We conduct extensive robustness checks of our results to the choices\nfor the outlier and observation thresholds (see Appendix B.1). Table 23 summarizes, how much\nobservations are dropped in each step.\n47The number of firms from the public sector and these small industries is tiny to begin with, as they did not use\ncommercial bills as a financing instrument. We left out financial and insurance institutions, as they arguably have\na very different production function and investment behavior.\nCriterion Drops of Firm-Year Observations\nThe final sample then consists of 854,105 firm-year observations, which amounts to obser-\nvations on 72,853 firms and the average observation length of a firm in the sample is 11.7 years.\nand 27 show the average sectoral 48 and the size distributions in our sample, as well as the dis-\ntributions over the number of observations and legal forms, respectively.\nFraction of\nID Sector Observations Observations WZ 2003\n(Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnung, VGR) uses.\nNumber of\nCapital Stock\nReal Value Added\nObs. per Firm Firms Percent Cum.

USTAN represents on average 70% of the value added of the NFPBS and\n78% of its gross output.49 The NFPBS, in turn, comprises 59% and 69%, respectively, of aggre-\ngate real value added and real gross output.\nFigure 9 shows that except for a certain overrepresentation of manufacturing (at least, when\nmeasured in value added) and a certain underrepresentation of the transportation and commu-\nnication sector, USTAN represents the sectoral composition in NFPBS rather well.\nFigure 9: Sectoral Composition in USTAN and NFPBS\nSectoral Composition: VA\nUSTAN\nNFPBS\nSectoral Composition: GO\nUSTAN\nNFPBS\nNotes: Graphs display the fraction of the sum of real value added and gross output respectively, over all firms by\n1-digit sector within the USTAN sample over the NFPBS aggregate.\nFigure 10 demonstrates that also the cyclical behavior of USTAN and NFPBS is close. The\n49 To compute these statistics we only average over the data from 1973 to 1990, because from then on German\nnational accounting does no longer report West and East Germany separately. For the business cycle statistics we\nuse the post-reunification data, but filter separately before and after this structural break. NFPBS value added is\ntaken from Bruttowertschoepfung in jeweiligen Preisen, table 3.2.1 of VGR, deflated year-by-year by the implicit\ndeflator for aggregate value added, table 3.1.1 of VGR (we apply the same deflator to USTAN data). The base year is\nalways 1991. We experiment also with implicit sector-specific deflators for value added from table 3.2.1 and 3.2.2\nof VGR, and results are robust to this. NFPBS gross output is taken from Produktionswerte in jeweiligen Preisen, ta-\nble 3.2.3 of VGR, deflated year-by-year by the implicit deflator for aggregate gross output, gathered from table 3.2.6\nof VGR. NFPBS investment is Bruttoanlageinvestitionen in jeweiligen Preisen from table 3.2.8.1, deflated with the\nimplicit sector-specific investment price deflators given by Bruttoanlageinvestitionen - preisbereinigt, a chain in-\nre-chained to 1991 prices. In both the computation of investment and capital data for USTAN in the PIM we use\nthe implicit sector and capital good specific (equipment and non-residential structures) deflators for investment:\ninvestment price deflator, the Preisindex der Investitionsgueterproduzenten, source: GP-X002, Statistisches Bunde-\nsamt. NFPBS employment is number of employed, Arbeitnehmer, from table 3.2.13, VGR. Payroll is taken from\nArbeitnehmerentgelt, table 3.2.10., VGR, deflated by the same general implicit deflator for aggregate value added\nthat we use to deflate value added numbers. Aggregate total hours comes from Geleistete Arbeitsstunden der Ar-\nbeitnehmer, table 2.9, VGR. Finally, real private consumption data are private Konsumausgaben, a chain index with\nFigure 10: Cyclical Behavior in USTAN and NFPBS\nReal Value Added\nUSTAN\nNFPBS\nReal Gross Output\nUSTAN\nNFPBS\nNotes: Upper panel: time series for the sum of real value added over all firms in the USTAN sample and NFBS after\ndetrending with logarithmic first differences and a deterministic linear trend. Lower panel: time series for the sum\nof real gross output over all firms in the USTAN sample and NFBS after detrending with logarithmic first differences\nand a deterministic linear trend.\nA.2 Capital Stocks\nIn order to obtain economically meaningful stocks of capital series for each firm, we have to\nre-calculate capital stocks in a Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM). The first step is to compute\nfirm-level investment series, ii,t , from the corporate balance sheets, which contain data only\non accounting capital stocks, ka\ni,t\n, and accounting total depreciation, da\ni,t\n. The following accu-\nmulation identity allows to back out nominal firm-level investment:51\nka\n= ka\ni,t\n-da\ni,t\n+ pI\nt\nThe next step is to recognize that capital stocks from corporate balance sheets are not di-\nrectly usable for economic analysis for two reasons: 1) accounting depreciation, da\ni,t\n, in cor-\nporate balance sheets is often motivated by tax reasons and typically higher than economic\n50We take first differences of log value added as well as gross output and then take out for both a deterministic lin-\near trend to remove the growth of the USTAN sample over time. The correlation between only the first differences\ni,t\nis the sum of balance sheet items ap65, Technische Anlagen und Maschinen, and ap66, Andere\nAnlagen, Betriebs-und Geschaeftsausstattung, for equipment; and balance sheet item ap64, Grundstuecke, Bauten,\nfor structures. Since balance sheet data are typically end-of-year stock data, notice that ka\ni,t\nis the end-of-period\ncapital stock in year t -1. da\ni,t\nis profit and loss account item ap156, Abschreibungen auf Sachanlagen und imma-\nterielle Vermoegensgegenstaende des Anlagevermoegens. In contrast to ka\ni,t\n, da\ni,t\nis not given for each capital good\nseparately. For the solution of this complication, see below.\ndepreciation, e\ni,t\n, expressed as a rate; 2) accounting capital stocks are reported at historical\nprices. Both effects would lead to an underestimation of the real firm-level capital stock, if one\nwere to simply deflate the current accounting capital stock, ka\ni,t\n, with a current investment price\ndeflator, pI\nt\n(assuming that pI\nt\nincreases over time). We therefore apply a Perpetual Inventory\nMethod (PIM) to compute economic real capital stocks:\n= ka\nt\ni,t\n+\npI\nt\npI\nka\nis the accounting capital stock in prices of 1991 at the beginning of an uninterrupted\nsequence of firm observations \u00ad if for a firm-year we have a missing investment observation,\nthe PIM is started anew, when the firm appears again in the data set. We estimate e\nt\nfor each\nyear from national accounting data, VGR, separately for equipment and non-residential struc-\ntures (table 3.1.3, VGR, Nettoanlagevermoegen nach Vermoegensarten in jeweiligen Preisen, Aus-\nruestungen und Nichtwohnbauten; table 3.1.4, VGR, Abschreibungen nach Vermoegensarten in\njeweiligen Preisen, Ausruestungen und Nichtwohnbauten). VGR contains sectoral and capital\ngood specific depreciation data only after 1991, which is why we decided to use only capital\ngood specific depreciation rates for the entire time horizon. For the data sources for invest-\nment price deflators see footnote 49. The drawback of this procedure is that we do not observe\ndirectly capital-good specific da\ni,t\nin the balance sheets (differently from ka\ni,t\n), so that (13) is not\ndirectly applicable for the two types of capital goods separately. We therefore split up da\ni,t\nac-\ncording to the fraction that each capital good accounts for in the book value of total capital,\nweighting each capital good by its VGR depreciation rate. Creating a capital series for both cap-\nital goods this way is mainly meant to provide a better estimate for total capital for each firm,\nbecause we finally aggregate up both types of capital into a single capital good at the firm-level.\nThere is a final complication, which comes through relying on ka\nas the starting value of\nthe PIM. It is typically not a good estimate of the productive real capital stock of the firm at that\ntime. Therefore, we calculate the time-average factor  (for each sector), by which k(1)\ni,t\nis larger\nthan ka\ni,t\n, and replace ka\nby ka\nin the perpetual inventory method. We do this iteratively,\nuntil  converges, i.e. we calculate:\nk(n)\nt\nk(n)\ni,t\n+\npI\nt\npI\nk(n)\n(n) = (NT )-1\ni,t\nk(n)\ni,t\ni,t\nwhere k(0)\ni,t\n= ka\ni,t\n, (0) = 1. We stop when for each sector and each capital good category  < 1.1.\nSince for our purposes we want to compute economic, i.e. productive, capital stocks, we\nthen \u00ad as a final step \u00ad add to the capital stock series from this iterative PIM the net present\nvalue of the real expenditures for renting and leasing equipment and structures.52\nA.3 Labor Inputs\nA more particular difficulty with USTAN data is that information on the number of employees is\nonly updated infrequently for some companies, as it is not taken directly from balance sheets,\nbut sampled from supplementary company information. Being no balance sheet item, the em-\nployment data is not constrained by legal accounting rules and did not undergo consistency\nchecks by Bundesbank staff. However, in order to compute firm-level Solow residuals, we need\nsome measure of employment.\nWe base this measure on the payroll data (wagebilli,t ) from the profit and loss statements\n(item ap154, Personalaufwand). Payroll data is regulated by accounting standards and is checked\nfor consistency by the Bundesbank using accounting identities. In contrast to the direct em-\nployment data, the payroll data is generally considered of high quality. Therefore, we exploit\nthis data to construct a proxy measure for (log) employment ni,t as follows (with a slight abuse\nof notation, we use ni,t here for log employment).\nThe idea behind our proxy measure is that we can determine sectoral average wages even\nthough firm level employment is measured with error. Since wage bargaining in Germany is\nhighly centralized, the sectoral average wage is all we need then, since it is a good proxy for firm\nlevel wages. Therefore, dividing firm level payroll by the sectoral average wage recovers true\nfirm level employment.\n52 Specifically, we take item ap161, Miet- und Pachtaufwendungen, from the profit and loss accounts, deflate it by\nthe implicit investment good price deflator, which we compute, in turn, from tables 3.2.8.1 and 3.2.9.1 from VGR,\nand then divide it by a measure of the user cost of capital. The latter is simply the sum of real interest rates for a\ngiven year, which - courtesy of the Bundesbank - we compute from nominal interest rates on corporate bonds and\nex-post CPI inflation data (the series is available from the authors upon request), and the time-average, accounting\ncapital-good weighted depreciation rate per firm.\nSpecifically, we assume that the measurement error in reported log employment, n\ni,t\nclassical and additive:\nn\ni,t\nThen we decompose the wage per employee, i,t , of firm i at time t into two effects. One is\ndetermined by a firm-time-specific wage component wi,t , and the other one being region-,\nr (i,t), sector-, j (i,t), and size-class-specific, s (i,t), where j (i,t), r (i,t) and s (i,t) denote that\nfirm i belongs to sector j, region r and size-class s at time t, respectively.54 Thus, we write\ni,t = \u00af\nwj(i,t),r(i,t),s(i,t),t + wi,t . (20)\nWe denote all firms that belong to sector j, region r and size-class s at time t by I j,r,s,t . Then\nwe can estimate a sector-region-size wage component, \u00af\n\u00af\nwj,r,s,t =\n#I j,r,s,t\niI(j,r,s,t)\nlog wagebilli,t -n\ni,t\nWe then use this estimate of the average wage rate to estimate employment on the basis of the\nfirm's wage bill:\n^\nnit = logwagebillit - \u00af\n= nit +it -\n#I j,r,s,t\nhI(j,r,s,t)\nnh,t\n+h,t\n- nh,t\n+h,t\n= nit + wit -\n#I j,r,s,t\nhI(j,r,s,t)\nwh,t\n-h,t\n= nit + wit +\n#I j,r,s,t\nhI(j,r,s,t)\nh,t\nThe second equality stems from using (19). The next to last equality holds, because one can\nreplace it by (20), realizing that the \u00af\nw, which do not depend on a specific firm, cancel. The\nlast equality holds, because, by construction, the average firm-level deviation from a sector-\n53We use item ap34, Beschaeftigtenzahl im Durchschnitt des Geschaeftsjahres, to measure n\ni,t\n, where available.\n54Specifically, for sectors we use the 2-digit classification in Table 24 in Appendix A.1. For size classes we use\nterciles of the capital distribution in each year. For the region-specific wage component we proceed as follows: we\ndivide West Germany into three regions, according to zip codes: South with zip codes starting with 7,8,9, except for\nwell as 48 and 59. However, not all balance sheets feature zip code information, which is why we compute \u00af\nwj,r,s,t\nwith and without a region component. For those firms that do not have zip code information or for those firms\nthat are in sector-region-size bins with fewer than 50 observations in a given year, we take the estimate without the\nregion component.\nwj,r,s,t we of course use only those observations, where n\ni,t\n, i.e. item ap34, Beschaeftigtenzahl im\nDurchschnitt des Geschaeftsjahres, is available.\nregion-size bin is zero in every year. For #I j,r,s,t large, the average measurement error term\n#I(j,r,s,t) hI(j,r,s,t) h,t\nis negligible. In addition, since wage bargaining is highly centralized\nin Germany, also the firm specific wage component, wit , can be expected to be of lesser impor-\ntance, i.e. the variance 2\nw\nis small. In particular it can be expected to be smaller than the initial\nmeasurement error in employment stocks. Therefore our measure of employment, ^\nni,t , should\nfollow real employment, ni,t , more closely than n\ni,t\n.\nTo corroborate this claim, we checked our procedure using data from the German social\nsecurity records at the Institut fuer Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (IAB), which provide in-\nformation on the wage bill and employment at the establishment level. There we observe true\nemployment and wage bills for all plants and the time 1975-2006. Constraining ourselves to the\nthe one of the USTAN data, we find the correlation between ^\nni,t and ni,t as well as between  ^\nni,t\nand ni,t to be fairly high (98% and 94%, respectively). This means that the cross-sectional vari-\nance of the firm specific wage innovations 2\nw\nvariance of employment changes (2\nn\n ^\nn\nbetween mean(ni,t ) in the USTAN data and the log-change in aggregate NFPBS employment\nof 0.653 shows also the quality of our employment measure.\nA.4 Solow Residual Calculation\nWith the estimated firm-level capital stocks and employment levels we can now compute firm-\nlevel Solow residuals from the logged production function (1). In our baseline specification we\nestimate the factor elasticities,  and , as 1-digit sector-specific median, pooled over all firm-\nyear observations in a sector, expenditure shares.56 Table 28 displays the estimated elasticities.\nNotice that for the aggregate Solow residual calculation for the baseline simulations, for which\nwe use the data sources specified in Footnote 49 in Appendix A.1, we simply use the expenditure\nshares from manufacturing, as manufacturing is still the largest sector within NFPBS (had we\nused any weighted median of expenditure shares the result would have been the same).\nTo check the robustness of our results, we also try alternative specifications with predefined\nelasticities common across sectors. We first try a combination of  and , SR(2), such that a one\n56We use profit and loss account item ap153, Rohergebnis, for firm-level value added and deflate it in the baseline\nscenario with the aggregate value added deflator, but experiment also with sector-specific value added deflators,\nsee Footnote 49 in Appendix A.1 for details. To compute firm-level expenditure shares, we proceed as follows:\nthe labor share is simply total payroll divided by value added (ap154/ap153); capital expenditures, which are then\nagain divided by value added, are the sum of the PIM capital stock and the net present value of renting and leasing\nexpenditures multiplied by the user cost of capital as specified in Footnote 52 in Appendix A.2. For firm-level sales\nwe use profit and loss account item ap144, Umsatzerloese, and deflate it with the aggregate value added deflator.\nFor firm-level sales we use profit and loss account item ap151, Aufwendungen fuer Roh-, Hilfs-, und Betriebsstoffe\nund fuer bezogene Waren, and deflate it again with the aggregate value added deflator.\nID Sector labor share  capital share \nthird share of capital in a CRTS production function and a reduced form revenue elasticity of\ncapital of 0.5 are compatible. This implies an implicit markup of 1.33, if one were to rationalize\nDRTS with a CRTS production function and monopolistic competition. We then either fix the\nrevenue elasticity of capital (SR5, SR3) or fix the one third share of capital in a CRTS production\nfunction (SR6, SR4) and lower the markup. Table 29 summarizes the scenarios.\nlabor share capital share CRTS capital share markup revenue elasticity\nSpecification   \n+\n+\n\nA.5 Cross-sectional Dispersion Data\nYear std(log i,t ) std(log yi,t ) std(logsalesi,t )\nNotes: std: cross-sectional standard deviation of the within-transformed data.

Material Intensity const. refers to firms whose material expenditures over sales mi,t\nsalesi,t\nhave changed by less then one percentage point in absolute terms.\nWe next provide further evidence for the robustness of the three empirical findings of this\npaper to sample selection and variable construction. First, we use sector-specific price deflators\nfor value added instead of the aggregate one (for sources see Footnote 49 in Appendix A.1). Sec-\nond, we use an aggregate price deflator for investment goods (see Footnote 49 in Appendix A.1\nfor details) in the perpetual inventory method instead of sectoral deflators separately for equip-\nment and structures. Third, we employ a stricter outlier removal criterion of 2.5 standard devi-\nations around the firm- and year-specific mean in Solow residual and value added innovations,\nas well as investment rates and employment changes. Fourth, we use a more liberal outlier cri-\nterion using 5 and 10 standard deviations instead of 3.57 Fifth, we employ a specification, where\nwe assume that an outlier above 3 standard deviations means a merger and, subsequently, treat\nthese firms as new firms in addition to removing them in the year, where the outlier occurs.\nSixth, we use all the firms that we observe at least twice with first differences.58 Finally, we carry\nout a more standard perpetual inventory method that simply uses the reported capital stocks\nin the first year of observation for a firm, instead of solving a fixed point problem in correction\nfactors (see Appendix A.2 for details). As one can see from Table 38, the results are robust to all\nthese alternative sampling procedures.\n57The latter variant lowers the number of dropped firm-year observations due to outliers in factor and value\nThis leaves the total number of firm-year observations at 934,315 and the total number of firms in the sample at\n58This lowers the number of dropped firm-year observations due to not satisfying the minimum observation\nCross-sectional Moment cv(\u00b7) (\u00b7,HP(100)-Y ) \u00b5(\u00b7)\nNotes: See notes to Table 31.\nFigure 11: Time Series of the Dispersions of Firm-Level Value Added and Sales Innovations (Nor-\nmalized by the Average Dispersion) and the Cyclical Component of GDP\nstd( log y\ni,t\n)\nstd( log sales\ni,t\n)\nNotes: See notes to Table 31.\nFigure 12: Scatter Plot between the Cross-sectional Dispersion of Firm-Level Solow Residual\nInnovations and the Cyclical Component of GDP\nCyclical Component of GDP\nSolow Residual Change Dispersion\nFigure 13: Scatter Plots between the Cross-sectional Dispersion of Firm-Level Value\nAdded/Sales Innovations and the Cyclical Component of GDP\nCyclical Component of GDP\nValue Added Change Dispersion\nCyclical Component of GDP\nSales Change Dispersion\nFigure 14: Time Series of the Dispersion of Firm-Level Solow Residual Innovations and the IFO\nUncertainty Index\nManufacturing\nBundesbank-Dispersion\nIFO Dispersion\nConstruction\nWholesale\nNotes: Both time series are linearly detrended and normalized by their time-series standard deviation.\nB.2 Further Robustness on the Simulation Results\nIn this subsection, we provide one further robustness on our three quantitative results: the\ninability of the pure `Risk Model' to produce realistic business cycles; the small changes in the\nsecond moment analysis that adding uncertainty shocks to a standard first moment shock `RBC\nModel' brings; and the interpretation of these changes as largely due to a bad news effect that\nuncertainty shocks entail. Specifically, (Table 39), we more than triple the adjustment costs\nparameter, \u00af\n, and set it to unity. This is to check whether higher nonconvex adjustment costs\ncould give the wait-and-see effect are larger role. We find that this is not the case.\nFinally, (Table 40), we compare the baseline results with the ones from a seemingly unre-\nlated regressions (SUR) specification for the aggregate driving force, (2), i.e. a specification,\nwhere the off-diagonal elements of A are restricted to zero. This is interesting for two reasons:\nfirst, this specification mitigates somewhat the obvious problems with estimating a bivariate\nVAR with 7 independent parameters from 2\u00d726 data points. We show that both the actual es-\ntimates of the remaining VAR parameters as well as the implications for our simulation results\nare remarkably robust. Secondly, Table 40 shows that most of the changes between the `RBC\nModel' and the `Full/News Model' are mainly due to the interaction effect between aggregate\nSolow residuals and firm-level uncertainty, that in the unrestricted baseline specification is em-\nbodied in the negative VAR coefficient of tomorrow's (but known today) firm-level uncertainty\non tomorrow's aggregate Solow residual, an effect that we identified as a bad news effect.\nFull News RBC Risk\nModel Model Model Model Data\nVolatility\nVolatility of aggregate variables relative to output volatility\nPersistence\nContemporaneous Correlation with Aggregate Output\nContemporaneous Correlation with Aggregate Consumption\nNotes:\nBusiness cycle statistics of aggregate output, Y , consumption C, investment I and employment N.
