There were 4215 Mexican American (MA)\nMEASUREMENTS: Weight, height and skinfold thicknesses.\nRESULTS: The body mass index (BMI, kgam2) values of MA boys were almost consistently and signi\u00aecantly (P ` 0.05) larger than\nNHW boys and showed a tendency to be larger than AA boys, beginning as early as age 6 and continuing through age 17.\nAlthough rarely signi\u00aecant, a similar trend in ethnic difference was also noted for girls, with the smallest BMI seen in NHW girls.\nThe subscapular skinfold thickness (SST) for MA boys and girls was signi\u00aecantly (P ` 0.05) larger than that for NHW counterparts\nand showed a tendency to be larger than AA counterparts. No signi\u00aecant ethnic differences were present in the triceps skinfold\nthickness (TST) for girls, but MA boys' TST were occasionally larger (P ` 0.05) than other ethnic-gender groups. Girls' TST were\nfrequently larger (P ` 0.05) than boys for each ethnic groups. Using the population data from the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) I as reference, the prevalence of overweight (BMI ! 95th percentile) was greater in MA (15 \u00b1\n28%) and AA (11 \u00b1 29%) boys and girls than in NHW (7 \u00b1 17%) counterparts.

Compared to the data\nfrom national surveys, the prevalence of overweight found in this study is higher than reported nationally. We found a marked\nincrease in the skinfold thickness, especially SST for boys, but the increase is less for girls.\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of overweight is higher in MA boys and girls and AA girls than other ethnic-gender groups in\nthe San Antonio, Texas, area. The prevalence of childhood overweight in the San Antonio area is higher than national \u00aegures.\nThe \u00aendings of increasing prevalence and early onset of childhood overweight are concerning, because these are known risk\nfactors for diabetes and diseases of many other organ systems.

The purposes of this\nportion of the report were (1) to examine the prevalence of\noverweight for each ethnic and gender group in a triethnic\npediatric population, (2) to examine whether ethnic differ-\nences seen in adults are present in children, and (3) to\ncompare the prevalence of obesity in this region with that\nof national surveys.\nMethods\n(A) Subject population and recruitment\nThis study was carried out in school children enrolled in\nkindergarten through 12th grade, in three selected school\ndistricts in the San Antonio, Texas, area. The initial phase of\nthe San Antonio Children's Blood Pressure Study began in\nfrom a biethnic population of MA and NHW children and\nadolescents. This phase of the study involved the South San\nAntonio Independent School District (ISD) and the Schertz-\nCibolo-Universal City ISD. For a triethnic comparison, the\nAntonio ISD to collect data primarily from African American\n(AA) children. The Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City ISD is a\nsuburb of San Antonio with the majority of its students being\nnon-Hispanic white (66.0%). The student body of the South\nSan Antonio ISD is mostly Mexican American (94.0%). All\nschools in these two ISD were studied. There were four\nelementary schools, two middle schools, and one high\nschool in the Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City ISD and 10\nelementary schools, three middle schools, and two high\nschools in the South San Antonio ISD. Only three elemen-\ntary schools, two middle schools and one high school were\nselected from the San Antonio ISD to recruit primarily\nAfrican American children. Although the socioeconomic\nstatus was not clearly evaluated, participation in the school\nlunch program is an indicator of the socioeconomic status.\nFree school lunch program participation in each school\ndistrict was as follows: (1) South San Antonio ISD \u00d0 95%;\n(2) Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City ISD \u00d0 25.9%; and (3) San\nThe School Boards of the three ISDs agreed to allow data\ncollection in their schools. Parental consent was obtained\nand the child was also asked for hisaher assent before data\nwere collected. The letter and the consent forms were in\nEnglish and Spanish. The Institutional Review Board of the\nUniversity of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio\napproved the research protocol.\nEthnic classi\u00aecation for African American (AA) children\nwas made by the staff observer. The classi\u00aecation of Mexican\nAmerican (MA), non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Mexican\nHispanics, and others was based on a previously published\nalgorithm because MAs have different genetic makeup from\nother Hispanics.22 Scoring of the algorithm was done by\ncomputer so that the actual classi\u00aecation of children as\nMA, NHW or other was independent of observers' judgment.\nWeight and height were measured to calculate BMI.\nWeight was measured with a scale calibrated daily with\nstandard weights. Weight without shoes or heavy garments\nwas measured to the nearest 0.25 pound and converted to kg\nlater. Height without shoes was measured with the child\nstanding straight against a 3 m rule taped to the wall and\nsquared at the base with the \u00afoor. With the child looking\nstraight ahead at an indicated point on the opposite wall,\nand heels, buttocks and occiput touching the wall, the edge\nof a plastic right triangle was positioned perpendicular to the\nmeter rule to be touching the top of the head, with hair\npushed down. The height was measured to the nearest\nTriceps skinfold thickness was measured over the back of\nthe right upper arm at the midpoint with the arm pendant. A\nfull thickness pinch of skin was grasped horizontally 1 cm\nabove the midpoint, and the skinfold thickness was read\nimmediately after applying Lange calipers (square tipped).\nThe calipers were released and the measurement recorded to\nthe nearest 1 mm. Subscapular skinfold thickness was mea-\nsured by pinching a full thickness of skin below the caudal\nend of the right scapula in the back, using the Lange calipers\nin the same manner as above. The Lange calipers were\nchecked monthly for tension and measurement accuracy.\nData so collected were entered into a database. Statistical\nanalyses were performed using the SAS Software (SAS Insti-\ntute Inc., Cary, NC) by the Computing Resources Department\nof the University of Texas Health Science Center at San\nAntonio, Texas. Children whose ethnic group was other\nthen AA, MA and NHW were excluded from the statistical\nanalyses, although they were included in data collection as\nrequired by the school districts. The remaining children were\ndivided into six subgroups by ethnicity and gender. The mean\nand standard deviation (s.d.) of BMI and skinfold thicknesses\nwere computed for each ethnic-gender group. Statistical tests\nfor signi\u00aecant ethnic and gender differences in these vari-\nables were performed by Analysis of Variance followed by the\nBonferroni test for each age group (age at last birthday in\nyears). Statistical signi\u00aecance was accepted at the 5% level in\nthis study. The prevalence of overweight in this population\nwas computed using the reference data of BMI from the\nNHANES I.23,24 BMI and skinfold thickness data from this\nstudy were compared with the results of national surveys.\nPrevalence of childhood obesity\nMK Park et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nResults\nData from 1006 subjects were excluded from analyses\nbecause of ethnicity or race other than AA, MA and NHW\nfrom 5 to 17 y are included in the statistical analysis (Table\n1). The number of MA children was much larger (58.5%)\nover-sampling of MA children could not be avoided because\nthe school district policy required that every child who\nwanted to participate be screened. Despite our best efforts,\na disproportionately small number of AA children partici-\npated in the study. The participation rate was 74% for the\nSchertz-Cibolo-Universal City ISD, 66% for the South San\nAntonio ISD, and 49% for the selected schools in the San\nAntonio ISD.\nBody mass index\nThe BMI values of MA girls were almost always signi\u00aecantly\n(P ` 0.05) larger than those of NHW girls (Table 2). The BMI\nvalues of MA and AA girls were not signi\u00aecantly different.\nMA boys had consistently and signi\u00aecantly (P ` 0.05) larger\nBMI values than did NHW boys throughout the ages studied\n(Table 2). MA boys showed a strong tendency to have larger\nBMI values than AA boys, with statistical signi\u00aecance\nattained frequently. No signi\u00aecant gender difference was\nfound for BMI (Table 2). Overall, the BMI values of NHW\ngirls were the smallest and those of MA boys the largest.\nSkinfold thicknesses\nThe subscapular skinfold thickness (SST) values of MA girls\nand boys were almost consistently and signi\u00aecantly\n(P ` 0.05) larger than those of NHW counterparts and\nshowed a tendency to be larger than those of AA boys and\ngirls (Table 3). One exception to this was the SST value of AA\nthan that of MA and NHW girls. With regards to the triceps\nskinfold thickness (TST), no signi\u00aecant ethnic differences\nwere present for girls, although MA girls tended to have\nTable 1 Number of study subjects according to age groups, ethnicity\nand gender\nAge Girls Boys\ngroup\nAA  African American; MA  Mexican American; NHW  non-hispanic white.\nTable 2 BMI (kgam2) (mean\u00c6 s.d.) according to ages, ethnicity and gender, with results of statistical tests\nGirls Boys Signi\u00aecance*\nAge\n(y) AA MA NHW AA MA NHW Ethnic Gender\n*Signi\u00aecantly different (P ` 0.05); NS  not signi\u00aecant..\na  AA girls vs MA girls; b  AA girls vs NHW girls; c  MA girls vs NHW girls;\nd  AA boys vs MA boys; e  AA boys vs NHW boys; f  MA boys vs NHW boys;\ng  AA girls vs AA boys; h  MA girls vs MA boys; i  NHW girls vs NHW boys.

The TST of girls were often signi\u00aecantly (P ` 0.05)\nlarger than those of boys in all three ethnic groups (Table 4).\nPrevalence of overweight by BMI\nFigures 1 and 2 show the prevalence of overweight in the\ntriethnic pediatric population of the San Antonio, Texas,\narea compared with the age- and gender-speci\u00aec 85th and\n95th percentile cut-off points of the NHANES I population\ndata.23,24 Overweight in children and adolescents is de\u00aened\nas those with BMI values at or greater than the 95th percen-\ntile of the reference value.25 Those children whose BMI is\nbetween the 85th percentile and the 94th percentile are\nde\u00aened as `at risk of overweight'.25 By this de\u00aenition, the\nexpected prevalence of overweight in a reference population\nshould be 5% and that of `at risk' should be 10%.\nFor girls, the combined prevalence of overweight and `at\nrisk' is much higher in AA and MA girls than NHW girls\n(Figure 1). The combined prevalence ranges between 33%\nand between 22% and 38% for NHW girls. The prevalence of\noverweight (BMI b 95th percentile) is much lower in NHW\ngirls and 15 \u00b1 27% for MA girls). The prevalence of `at risk of\noverweight' in NHW adolescent girls (13 \u00b1 22%) tends to be\nlower than that in the other ethnic groups (Figure 1). An\nearly onset of marked overweight occurring in AA and MA\ngirls at ages 5 and 6 is noteworthy.\nTable 4 Triceps skinfold thickness (mm) (mean\u00c6 s.d.) according to ages, ethnicity and gender, with results of statistical\ntests\nGirls Boys Signi\u00aecance*\nAge\n(y) AA MA NHW AA MA NHW Ethnic Gender\n*Signi\u00aecantly different (P ` 0.05): the symbols used are the same as in Table 2.

MA boys have the highest prevalence of\noverweight (BMI b 95th percentile) with the ranges between\n21 and 28%. Among boys, the lowest prevalence of over-\nweight is seen in NHW subjects (range of 7 \u00b1 16%). For AA\nboys, the prevalence of overweight ranges between 11 and\n27%. The overall prevalence of `at risk' ranges between 7%\nand 26% (Figure 2). AA boys had a lower prevalence of `at\nrisk' than the other ethnic groups.\nComparisons with national \u00aegures\nIn Table 5, the prevalence reported by Troiano et al5 and that\nfound in this study are compared. For both studies, the\nreference values used (National Health Examination Survey\n(HES) cycles II and III) and the age breakdown are the same.\nThe prevalence of overweight and `at risk of overweight' in\nthis study is much higher than that reported by Troiano et al5\nfrom NHANES III. In all, 35 \u00b1 47% of MA boys and girls and\nAA girls have BMI greater than the 85th percentile in this\nstudy, in comparison to the \u00aegures reported by Troiano et al\nfrom the NHANES III (between 20 and 33%).5 The difference\nin the prevalence between these two studies is striking. The\npercentage difference in the prevalence of BMI b 85th per-\ncentile (the combined prevalence of overweight and `at risk')\ndifference for the prevalence of overweight (BMI b 95th\npercentile) is on average 148%, with a high of more than\nChanges in skinfold thicknesses\nThe mean values of the SST in this study were compared with\nthe race-speci\u00aec 50th percentile values from NHANES I data\nfor AA and NHW boys26 and AA and NHW girls.27 The\nreference values for MA children were from the Hispanic\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES),28 since\nthe ethnicity-speci\u00aec MA data are not available from\nNHANES I. The increase in the SST was modest in girls of\n6 \u00b1 11 y and less in older girls (Table 6). There was almost no\nincrease in the SST in NHW girls aged 12 \u00b1 17 y. AA and MA\ngirls showed much larger percentage increases than NHW\ngirls. The SST was markedly increased in boys of all ages, with\na larger increase seen in AA and MA boys than in NHW boys\n(Table 6). The largest increase (70 \u00b1 128%) is seen in AA boys.\nIn comparison with 50th percentile values for TST from\nsmall percentage increase in the TST in girls 6 \u00b1 11 y for all\nethnic groups. However, for MA and NHW girls aged 12 \u00b1 17,\nthere was an actual percentage decrease (13 \u00b1 20%) in this\nmeasurement. In AA adolescent girls the value increased (not\nshown). For boys, there was a modest increase (9 \u00b1 48%) in\nthe percentage change in all ages studied. The increase was\nmost marked in AA boys and least so in NHW boys.\nDiscussion\nOur data show (a) that an increase in the prevalence of\noverweight is seen in all ethnic and gender groups, as has\nbeen reported nationally,6,12 (b) that there are several impor-\ntant ethnic differences in BMI and skinfold thickness mea-\nsurements in children and adolescents, and (c) that the\nmagnitude of the increase in the prevalence is greater in\nthis study than has been reported nationally.\nMA boys and girls often have larger BMI values than NHW\ncounterparts while AA children, especially girls, have BMI\nvalues equally as large as MA girls. Data from NHANES II,29\nNHANES III,6 and HHANES28 show the same ethnic differ-\nences in BMI as noted above among the three ethnic groups\nof children. These three national surveys28 \u00b1 30 also show the\nsame pattern of ethnic differences in BMI among the three\nethnic groups of adults. With regard to the SST, MA children\ntended to have larger values than other ethnic groups and\nTable 6 Changing trends in the mean values of the subscapular skinfold\nthickness (%)\nGirls Boys\nAge group\n(y) AAa MAb NHW a AAa MAb NHW a\nReference values used for the computation are the mean values: afrom\nFigure 2 Prevalence of overweight and `at risk of overweight' for boys.\nThe current data were compared with the population reference data of\nPrevalence of childhood obesity\nMK Park et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nNHW girls had the smallest SST measurements. NHANES II29\nand HHANES28 surveys also showed the same pattern of\nethnic differences in the SST in adults as found in this\nstudy, with white women having the lowest SST. Thus, the\nresults of our study show that the ethnic differences in BMI\nand the fat distribution pattern reported in the adult are\nalready established as early as 5 \u00b1 6 y of age.\nThere has been a dramatic (8%) increase in the prevalence\nof overweight in the last two decades, more precisely\nprevalence of obesity (de\u00aened as body mass index (BMI,\nMexican American (MA) men (25.4%) than white (20%) and\nAfrican American (AA) (21.3%) men and it was higher in MA\n(22%). Parallel with the increase in prevalence of obesity in\nadults,1 an alarming increase in the prevalence of childhood\nobesity has occurred during the same period in the USA.3,4,6\nTroiano et al,5 reported the prevalence of obesity (called\noverweight in pediatrics, BMI ! 95th percentile) from the\nAA and MA girls and 9% for white girls,6 showing the same\nethnic trend as reported in the adults.30 Thus, the trends in\nethnic difference are the same for adults and children in the\nNHANES III5,30 and in our triethnic pediatric population in\nthe San Antonio area.\nThis rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity is con-\ncerning because many obese children become obese\nadults31,32 and, once established, obesity is dif\u00aecult to\ntreat. It becomes a chronic condition with complications of\nmany organ systems,2 including cardiovascular diseases, type\n2 diabetes mellitus, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, sleep\napnea, and certain types of cancer.2,33,34 None of the treat-\nment modalities available will cure the condition.33 At best,\nthe condition is palliated on continued treatment at an\nenormous cost. In 1995, the total cost attributable to obesity\nthese dollars (5.7% of the national health expenditure) were\ndirect medical costs.35\nUnlike adults, obesity-related diseases are rarely mani-\nfested in children and adolescents. However, some of these\nchildren have already shown signs of chronic complications\nof obesity, such as type 2 diabetes, usually not seen until\nmiddle age.36 Many of these children may actually have high\nblood pressure, high cholesterol, and other diseases in their\nearly stages,17,37 \u00b1 39 and are at risk for psychosocial dysfunc-\ntion.40 Many diseases, including coronary artery disease, are\nsilent during childhood and adolescence, but there is strong\nevidence that coronary artery `clogging' is going on during\nchildhood.41 The early onset of overweight seen in this study\nis also concerning. The onset of overweight may be even\nearlier in the preschool-age group, which we did not study.\nReports from the US42 and the UK43 indicate that some\npreschool children are already obese. Hernandez et al42\nreported 32% of children in a Head Start program to be\noverweight. Reilly et al43 reported that 20% of 4-y-old chil-\ndren in the UK were overweight. Therefore, the prevention\nandaor remediation of obesity is an important measure that\ncould prevent cardiovascular diseases, hypertension32 dia-\nbetes36 and other diseases in youth and thus should be\nstarted in childhood.41,44 Interventions during childhood\nare more likely to have long-term success.44\nThe reasons for the higher prevalence of overweight in\nthis area are not entirely clear. It may be a local phenom-\nenon, as San Antonio is dubiously known as the third\n`fattest' city in the country.45 It may also re\u00afect a continued\nincrease in the prevalence of overweight since the comple-\nleast for MA and NHW children because our data collection\nwas only 1 y later than the national survey. Most of the data\non AA children were, however, obtained 4 \u00b1 5 y later (in 1996\nto 1998) than the NHANES III and may re\u00afect the continued\nincrease in obesity rather than the local phenomenon. Thus,\nthe reasons for the higher prevalence of obesity in this region\nmay be a combination of the two possibilities.\nThe strength of this study is that it was carried out in a\ntriethnic population by a small number of investigators, so\nthat a direct comparison of anthropometric data is possible\namong the three ethnic groups. The weaknesses of the study\nincludes (a) a disproportionately small number of AA chil-\ndren participated and an over-sampling of MA children\n(59%) was unavoidable because of the required policy of\nSchool Districts to collect data from all volunteering stu-\ndents, (b) the participation rate was less than optimal, (c)\ndata collection from predominantly AA students lagged 2 y,\n(d) detailed information on the socioeconomic status or the\nlevel of acculturation are lacking, and (e) no information is\navailable on the difference between participants and non-\nparticipants. Small numbers of AA subjects in the study may\nhave resulted in a less than ideal situation for statistical\nanalyses for this particular ethnic group. The socioeconomic\nand acculturation status would undoubtedly have contribu-\nted to the ethnic difference shown in this study.46 \u00b1 48 The\nprevalence of obesity and its ethnic differences obtained in\nthis study may not be appropriate for other regions.\nIn conclusion, we found in this study an early onset of\nchildhood obesity and an early establishment of the adult\npattern of ethnic differences in BMI and central fat distribu-\ntion. The reports of childhood onset of type 2 diabetes36 and\ncardiovascular risk factors17,49 are particular concerns. The\nprevention andaor remediation of overweight is an impor-\ntant measure that could prevent hypertension,32,50 dia-\nbetes,36 and other diseases in young adults and these\nefforts should be started in childhood.41\n"
