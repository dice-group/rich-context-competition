As doors opened at majority\ninstitutions, HBCUs had to form strategic initiatives to dem-\nonstrate what they offered to attract diverse students, so as to\nincrease their incoming freshmen class. In addition to deal-\ning with recruitment and diversity challenges, they must also\ndeal with a population of students that already exists within\nthe student body: lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender stu-\ndents. In the last decade, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgen-\nder (LGBT) students have become very visible at HBCUs,\nbut this visibility is not reflected in some colleges' student\nprograms and activities. Only a few HBCUs, such as Howard\nUniversity inWashington, D.C., and Spelman and Morehouse\nCollege in Atlanta have made an attempt to recognize these\nstudents. What I mean by visibility at this point and through-\nout this project in reference to LGBT students on campus is\nthe fact that they are simply not recognized or acknowledged\nin the governing and activities of the university. We are a\nlong way from the visibility of having outward LGBT repre-\nsentation among faculty, administrators, and in athletic pro-\ngrams, which would be true visibility.\nAlso, only a few HBCUs are on the LGBT-Friendly\nCampus Climate Index, and of the 106 federally designated\nHBCUs, only 21 or 22% hosted LGBT student organizations.\nAcknowledging that the LGBT community is significant and\nexists, and fostering such support, comes up against a steep\nwall of religious tradition and doctrines, and conservative\nadministrations. HBCUs must foster a sexual discourse of\nresistance to hetero-patriarchy to create and support safe\nspaces for LGBT students to articulate and envision their\nidentity as part of the general campus community without\nalienation or fragmentation. The purpose of this article is to\nassess and critique the need for unified involvement in creat-\ning an accepting and empowering atmosphere for LGBT stu-\ndents at HBCUs.\nAll first time students in general find college stressful, but\nLGBT students usually stand \"outside the dominant cultural\noften disrupt the binaries of normalcy in social institutions and\nstructures that make their environments much more stressful\nTerney & Dilley, 1998).

The lack of safe spaces that provide support for\nLGBT students lead to higher rates of distress, alienation,\nand discrimination (Mays & Cochran, 2001; McCabe etal.,\n2010) compared with their heterosexual counterparts, forc-\ning LGBT students to navigate on their own and often mak-\ning them more susceptible to depression and suicidal\nbehavior (Kisch, Leino, & Silverman, 2005).

Thus, there is a critical need to\nprovide a positive environment for LGBT students, espe-\ncially at HBCUs.\nCurrent Status of HBCUs and LGBT\nPopulation\nHBCUs have been slow to meet and respond to the needs of\nthe LGBT community on their campuses. According to\nHarper and Gasman (2008), some are known for having\nunsupportive environments. Others are known for making\nsome progress by allowing LGBT student organizations on\ncampus but with relatively little to no inclusion in larger cam-\npus politics. And yet, some have attempted to take bold steps\nto normalize their campus environment by integrating the\nLGBT community within the larger community of the univer-\nsity as a whole. According to the University of Pennsylvania\nGraduate School's study (Gasman, 2013), \"The Changing\nFace of Historically Black Colleges and Universities,\"\nHBCUs are beginning to change their attitude toward LGBT\nstudents. Howard University has had an on-campus support\norganization for LGBT students since the 1980s. Spellman\nCollege served as an example for HBCUs when it sponsored\na national conference in 2011 on HBCUs and LGBT issues.\nThey also have student organizations as well. Putting them\nwell ahead of most HBCUs, Bowie State University opened\nits Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and\nAllies Resource Center in 2012. Morehouse offered its first\nLGBT course in 2013 taught through Skype by a Yale faculty\nmember, which focuses on Black gay, lesbian, bisexual, and\ntransgender history. Thus, slowly, HBCUs are beginning to\nrecognize and validate other sexualities and identities.\nConceptual Framework and Method\nThis project answers the following question: Why do LGBT\nstudents find the campus climate difficult to negotiate at\nHBCUs? This article is an evaluative study that analyzes the\nLGBT experience using multiple fields of inquiry that\ninclude archival study of the Black church and homosexual-\nity; HBCUs and social conservatism regarding homosexual-\nity, which includes campus climate for students and faculty,\nand administrators' perception and tolerance; and exclusion\nin class and course curriculums and personal narratives. This\nproject is framed around Jones and McEwen's (2000) Model\nof Multiple Dimensions of Identity (MMDI), which posits\nthat the MMDI \"is a fluid and dynamic one, representing the\nongoing construction of identities and the influence of chang-\ning contexts on the experience of identity development\"\n(p. 408). The model explains a person's identity status within\na particular time frame and shows how individuals experi-\nence various identities at both the core and external levels.\nThe core identity is the internal self-identity that is \"some-\nwhat protected from view\" (p. 408) and includes one's per-\nsonal characteristics, values, and attributes. Race, gender,\nand religion are examples of socially constructed labels that\nmake up external identities (Davis, 2008), which may vary in\nterms of their importance and complexity to the individual.\nSome of the aspects of both identities become intersecting\ncircles; therefore, \"one dimension may be understood singu-\nlarly; or it can be understood only in relation to the other\nThe prioritization and placement of these identities deter-\nmines the level of salience that external identities have in\nrelation to the core identity. The context in which MMDI is\nexperienced affects whether or not the dimensions become\nmore or less salient \"as they interact with contextual influ-\nences such as family background, sociocultural conditions,\ncurrent life experiences, and career decisions and life plan-\nthese identities by HBCUs fosters a problematic environ-\nment for their LGBT population.\nThe Black Church and the Veil of\nResistance\nWhen HBCUs do not account for the way LGBT students\nnegotiate their identity, their environments render LGBT stu-\ndents and faculty invisible and marginalized. The same\noccurs within the Black church as well.As a result, the LGBT\ncommunity at HBCUs and some Black church members seek\nother ways to negotiate their place and space within unrecep-\ntive environments. The environment of HBCUs for LGBT\nstudents can be both hostile and rejecting to neutral and\nWashington, 2005). Neutral means that they are neither\nacknowledged nor denied. The backbone of resistance to the\nquest for inclusivity for the LGBT community at HBCUs\nand the birthplace of social conservatism practiced by admin-\nistrators is the Black church, the most recognized central,\noldest, and influential institution in the Black community\nnumber of HBCUs were founded by churches or church\norganizations (Baptist, Christian Methodist, African\nMethodists Episcopal, United Methodist, and Presbyterian;\nCantey et\nal., 2013). But even more critical, \"the Black\nchurch is the spiritual ark that also preserved and empowered\nBlack people socially, psychologically, and physically dur-\ning slavery\" and other difficult times (R. L. Miller, 2001,\nThe Black church not only greatly influences regular\nchurchgoers but also indirectly influences the lives of Blacks\nwho are not churchgoers through its ideology and imagery\nwith which many were raised. This continues to influence\ntheir later beliefs and practices in other areas of their lives.\nThus, the Black church and HBCUs become two powerful\npillars in the Black community that perpetuate and foster\nhomophobic environments against the backdrop and in sup-\nport of their Christian values (R. L. Miller 2007; Patton,\nproducer Clay Cane's (2015) long overdue online BET\n(Black Entertainment Television) documentary Holler If You\nHear Me: Black and Gay in the Church discusses and ana-\nlyzes the spiritual abuse and violence some Black churches\nheap upon their LGBT members, forcing them to participate\nin their own oppression to be a part of the church family.\nHowever, it is important to note that Black churches are not\nthe only source of homophobia in the Black community.\nAccording to Ward (2005), three different types of expla-\nnations have been posited that make up the roots and charac-\nter of homophobia in Black churches within the United\nStates: religious belief, historical sexual exploitation, and\nrace survival consciousness. \"All of these are intimately\nrelated to the history of slavery, underscoring the complex\nbackground influence of racism in the genesis of homopho-\nThe first of these perspectives, religious belief, relates\nhomophobia to literalist theological view in which theologi-\ncal and biblical scholars move Christian groups toward\ngreater biblical integrity on homophobia by giving contex-\ntual clarity to passages long adhered to as justification for\nhomophobia (Ward, 2005). Many Black religious figures see\nthis view as a White hegemonic approach. Black ministers\nand congregations, who have been distrustful and rather\nimmune to White-dominated approaches, however, have\nrejected such biblical scholarship and revisionism. Therefore,\none can argue that homophobia in the Black church is directly\nrelated to the \"authority given to a perceived literal\n(1999) suggests that it is understandable in the context of\ntheir historical experience why Black people use the Bible to\ncondemn homosexuality when one considers how enslaved\nBlacks sought refuge and found freedom in the literalness of\nscripture.\nWhen considering the second explanation of these per-\nspectives, historical sexual exploitation, one needs to con-\nsider the historical stereotypes that developed during and\nafter slavery, the mammy, jezebel, and the hyper-sexual brute\nto name a few. The media has basically reincarnated these\ncharacters through the domineering matriarch, the welfare\nqueen, and the criminalized, violent, and sexually promiscu-\nous Black man, which indicates how ingrained these images\nare and what they suggest in the psyche today. What is prob-\nlematic about this, according to West (1993), is that institu-\ntions in the Black community have historically and\npurposefully ignored addressing the fundamental issues of\nsexuality, particularly in public, out of fear that it may con-\nfirm stereotypes that some Whites have long held. This out-\nof-sight-out-of-mind mentality leads these institutions to let\nsocial and cultural problems fester beyond repair, especially\nin the name of religion.\nIn terms of the third explanation of homophobia in the\nBlack church, many African Americans feel that addressing\nsuch an issue is not worthy due to what Crichlow (2004) calls\n\"race survival consciousness\" (p. 32). Lemelle and Battle\n(2004) argue that Blacks adopted the immoralism of homo-\nsexuality of Western culture during slavery, colonialism, and\nimperialism, which caused a melding of both Western and\ntraditional African religious beliefs. Thus, the urgency of\nracial consciousness of survival and preservation among\nBlacks who sought to construct Black masculinity as they\nstruggled against White domination has combined with\nhomophobic religious moralisms (Ward, 2005). The deposits\nof this joining and what Ward (2005) calls \"religion-driven\nhomophobia and bio-nationalism\" have been that Whites and\nhomosexuality are both understood to connote weakness and\nfemininity; conversely, Black masculinity has been con-\nstructed in hyper-masculine terms (p. 495). Anything that\nthreatens this construct will be ignored, not only in the Black\nchurch but in other areas of African American life as well.\nThese explanations of homophobia shed light on the diffi-\nculty that many Black churches have when dealing with\nhomosexuality among their congregations and within their\nown ranks, and in turn, as the central social institution of the\nBlack community, addressing issues such as HIV.\nAlthough a number of cases speak of the prevalence of\nhomosexuality in the church in all aspects, the Black church\ndoctrine usually casts a silent veil over these internal issues\nwhile condemning it externally. One case in point is the law-\nsuit filed in 2010 against Bishop Eddie Long who was the\nbishop of the New Missionary Baptist Mega Church in\nLithonia, Georgia. Long was sued by several males who\naccused him of allegedly gaining their affection with gifts\n4 SAGE Open\nand a loving father relationship when they were teenagers,\nthen allegedly leading to a sexual relationship. Despite the\nfact that evidence was mounting, Long vehemently denied\nthe accusations when he addressed his congregation.\nEventually, he settled out of court with each alleged victim\nfor an undisclosed amount of money. What is most interest-\ning is that the majority of his congregation stood behind him\nwithout any type of investigation or probational removal.\nWhat is even more disturbing is that the church did not take\nthis opportunity to deconstruct old damnation rhetoric\nagainst queer identities to establish an inclusive forum of dis-\ncussion. Instead, the silencing effect was implemented, as\nstaff writer Patrick Johnson (2010) makes clear in The\nChristian Science Monitor in his response to the Long\nsituation:\n. . . Black theologians say the mega church leader's decision\nboth to deny the charges and claim fallibility in the eyes of God\nis part of a pervasive \"don't ask, don't tell\" reflex in the Black\nchurch, where outwardly stated condemnations inhibit frank\ndiscussions about sexuality of any sort. It's a situation that leads\nmany Blacks, by force of culture, religion, and tradition, to live\ndouble lives: one in the church, and one at home.\nHere Johnson is commenting on the direct homophobic rhet-\noric that is part of everyday day life in some Black churches.\nLong was considered one of the most anti-gay pastors. I have\npersonally attended churches where derogatory gay and les-\nbian terms were used in highflying sermons to make clear\nthat homosexuality is an abomination.As the authority figure\nof the church, the minister usually goes unchallenged, even\nwhen members are aware that he is gay or has committed\nother \"sins,\" members of the choir are gay, and many in the\ncongregation are gay. No one in the church questions such\nreligious dogma within the church. Strikingly enough, \"some\nBlack gay men remain in traditional Black churches that are\nunabashedly homophobic and endure the oppression\" (Ward,\nidentities leaves many in the LGBT community in psycho-\nlogical turmoil as they try to reconcile with who they are and\nto feel loved by God at the same time without shame. As\n. . . to be cut off from the Black church is really being cut off\nfrom the Black community, the Black family, because \"aint no\nplace else\" you can be just by virtue of being Black and be\nsomebody. You're a child of God; you're someone with dignity;\nyou're someone who holds the promise of a new world, of God's\nkingdom will be done. To be cut off from the Black church is to\nbe cut off from your lifeline. (p. 188)\nAlthough many aspects of the Black church are becoming\ncommercialized, it is still the primary place where African\nAmericans receive religious and personal therapy to cope\nwith the vicissitudes of life. To maintain this lifeline, many\nLGBT people, after years of self-discovery, create double\nlives as to participate in their religious community and\nsecretly maintain their sexual identity. This is the result of\nthe disembodied belief system, hate the sin, love the sinner\nthat many pastors preach (Samuel, 2015) according to Rev.\nKenneth Samuel of Victory for the World Church in Stone\nMountain, Georgia, during his interview in the documentary\nHoller If You Hear Me: Black and Gay in the Church.\nAccording to Samuel, one cannot separate one's existence as\nhomosexual from one's individual personhood and humanity\nthat this disembodied belief system purports, which creates a\ncontradiction in faith for many in the LGBT community. As\na result, the LGBT community has started its own churches\nsuch as The Vision Cathedral Church in Atlanta where they\ncan worship God as a complete individual. When LGBT\npeople are forced to live a covert existence, it leaves little\nroom for compassionate and inclusive discourse on queer\nidentities in the Black church.\nIn response to the silent veil used by the Black church,\nDouglas (1999) calls for a \"sexual discourse of resistance\"\nthat challenges the Black church to become a voice for those\nwho are marginalized, outcast, or oppressed because of who\nthey are (p. 139). She emphatically asserts, \"for the church to\nbe homophobic and heterosexist is for the church to be\nfor as clearly as Brown maps the deadly effects of these twin\nevils in her book, the New Testament charts the life and life-\nsaving \"acts\" of Christ to demonstrate that sinners are those who\nfoster racism, sexism, and homophobia and those who nurture\nracist, sexist, and heterosexist structures and systems--likened\nto the Antichrist. (p. 76)\nThus, Lemons is calling for a more liberating biblical dis-\ncourse. Such a discourse is needed if the Black church is to\nonce again be the political, social, and cultural force it was\nduring the Civil Rights Movement to adequately address\nissues in the Black community (sexuality, HIV, crime, etc.)\nrather than becoming a paragon of commercialized jargon\nand showbiz religion used to put on a show for its parishio-\nners who leave high off rhetoric and low on long-term\nempowerment. This type of abusive discourse may also lead\nheterosexual men \"who might not normally express hyper\nmasculinity to feel pressure to do so as a result of repeated,\nimpassioned church-inspired homophobic messages; `. . .\nindeed, it may even vindicate their beliefs and fears about\nhomosexuality,'\" which makes them less tolerant in other\nThe Battle for Voice and Identity\nAgainst Social Conservatism\nAs always with any suppressed group, a way of expression is\nfound regardless of acceptance from the dominant populace.\nThe participants in E. Patrick Johnson's (2008) study, Sweet\nTea: Black Gay Men of the South, several of whom were\nalumni of HBCUs, describe how Black gay men are \"incor-\nporated into the fabric of student life . . . and how sometimes\nthey are cordoned off into their own discrete organizations\"\n(p. 285). These formal and informal existences are noticeable\nin fraternities and sororities, gospel choirs, fashion shows,\nand within other social networks. The lack of acknowledg-\nment of the LGBT community on the campus by universities\nas a whole and the secret societies that Johnson speaks of\nsuggest that HBCUs are contradictory environments when it\ncomes to recognizing the existence of queer identities.\nWhat prevents these sexualities from becoming a recog-\nnized norm is the social conservatism that exists on the cam-\npuses of many HBCUs, even those that have managed to\nestablish social groups and organizations for Black queer\nstudents. This conservatism is usually accompanied by social\npractices that attempt to regulate and eradicate sexual diver-\nsity. One example that articulates this practice is the incident\nin 2002 at Morehouse College in which a supposedly gay\nmale student was beaten to death for allegedly making a pass\nat another male student in the shower. This incident forced\nthe issue of homosexuality to the surface and forced admin-\nistrators to move beyond a position of tolerance to a position\nof recognizing and understanding the diverse sexualities that\nexisted on the campus. Prior to this, Morehouse was reluc-\ntant to address any notion that challenged their vision of\nmasculinity embodied in the \"Renaissance Man,\" which\nMorehouse established as the type of man all their students\nwould become during and after their tenure at the college.\nHarper and Gasman's 2008 National Black Male\nAchievement Study explores 12 HBCUs and 76 participants\nin an attempt to examine how Black male students character-\nize, respond to, and make sense of environmental politics\n(Harper & Gasman, 2008). The study notes one particular\nwritten policy toward sexual behaviors of one HBCU where\n\"sexual misconduct is defined as including, but not limited to\nsexual intercourse, adultery, rape, sodomy and homosexual\ncally equates consensual sex between adults with rape.\nAccording to the study, homosexuality was cited as sexual\nmisconduct in a number of other documents reviewed. A\nnumber of participants in the study spoke at length about\ninstitutional resistance to same-sex relationships, mostly\nfrom faculty and administrators. James, a FloridaAgricultural\nand Mechanical University student, describes the resistance\nto the ways in which LGBT people are treated in the larger\nBlack community: \"this campus is like the rest of Black soci-\nety; it is not accepting of gay culture. And so, they are defi-\nnitely on the outskirts of this campus. They are not included\"\nOther participants in the study noted how LGBT students\nhad been rendered invisible despite the presence of gay Black\nmales who outwardly express themselves through feminine\naesthetics. It was noted, however, that these students were\nusually not part of, or functioned within, heterosexual Black\nmale peer groups; they regulated themselves to other students\nwith the same expressive style. This type of peer bonding and\nexclusion was especially noticed at Morehouse, the only sin-\ngle-sex HBCU in the study. Participants in the Morehouse\nstudy group noted that a significant number of gay men\nattended the college, but dialogue and meaningful interaction\nbetween these students and heterosexuals were routinely\navoided. For example, \"Ross, a senior, characterized\nMorehouse as \"a very heterosexual place, and he observed\nthat gay male students were not befriended by many hetero-\nAnother Morehouse student had strong concerns about how\nthe institution was handling heterosexism and homophobia:\nSeeing how this is an all-male school, seeing how we're in the\nmiddle of Atlanta, and that Blacks are notoriously homophobic,\nhow are we going to manage it? Are we just going to sweep it\nunder the carpet? That's what's usually done. (Harper &\nAccording to the study, a number of participants reported\nthat structured conversations about LGBT issues were not\nfacilitated by administrators or faculty unless a student was\nharmed or the issued received a lot of media attention.\nA perfect example that supports the participants' observa-\ntions is another situation that disrupted the vision that\nMorehouse prescribed for Morehouse men to develop when\nan organization that represented an aspect of the LGBT com-\nmunity called \"The Plastics\" was formed. Issues surrounding\n\"The Plastics\" received a lot of media attention. It is impor-\ntant to mention that this was not an official university organi-\nzation. \"The Plastics\" can best be described as a group of\nmales who function as interstitial figures and disrupt the bor-\nder of feminine aesthetics through clothing styles and man-\nnerism to develop their own distinct identities. Because of\nthis group of students, as well as those male students who\nwore more urban attire such as do-rags, hoodies, and saggy\npants, Morehouse instituted a broad dress code policy that\nbanned such clothing in 2009, both in classrooms and at for-\nmal events. The most telling statement that resulted from the\nincident is listed in the Morehouse College, Division of\nStudent Services (2013) as Appropriate Attire Statement\nNumber Nine: \"wearing of clothing associated with wom-\nen's garments.\" This statement attempts to protect the foun-\ndation of the university: masculinity, or rather the university's\nprescribed notion of masculinity.\n\"The Plastics\" inferred that the ban of feminine attire vio-\nlated their freedom of expression (King, 2010). Of course,\nMorehouse could and did cleverly argue that the new dress\ncode was dealing with the larger issue of defining what best\nrepresents a Morehouse man. According to Morehouse Vice\nPresident of Student Affairs at the time, Dr. William Bynum,\nThe university respect[ed] the identity and choices of all young\nmen at Morehouse; however, \"the Morehouse leadership\ndevelopment model sets a standard of how [they] expect[ed] the\n6 SAGE Open\nyoung men to dress, and this attire [that `The Plastics' used for\nexpression] does not fit within the model.\" (King, 2010)\nThe model is based on the tenth president of Morehouse,\nDr. Robert M. Franklin Jr.'s, call for the college to produce\n\"Renaissance Men with a social conscience and a global per-\nspective to uplift and serve\" (Morehouse College, Division of\nStudent Services, 2013). His vision centered on what he called\nthe \"Five Wells: well read, well spoken, well-travelled, well\ndressed and well balanced\" (Morehouse College, Division of\nStudent Services, 2013). Although Morehouse's leadership\nmodel does include internal qualities of what a Morehouse\nman is, the foundation of the leadership model is a fundamen-\ntal outward and physical manifestation of masculinity based\non a performance of masculinity. The policy does a good job\nteaching the general student body the importance of dress and\nappearance, but it forces some gay males to conform in a way\nthat may go against who they are and how they should act.\nIn essence, by using clothes as a prescription for masculin-\nity, Bynum is articulating that to be a leader one must possess\nnotions of prescribed masculinity (talking, walking, and dress-\ning a certain way) by following a strict norm of hetero-fashion\nthat has little to do with intellect, respect, confidence, and\nresponsibility. Although these qualities are more empowering\nconstructs of masculinity, they will not always come in the\npackage that Morehouse prefers. Simultaneously, this dress\ncode defines \"The Plastics\" and other transgender persons as\nincapable of being leaders at Morehouse and as an unrecog-\nnizable gender. Certainly no one is questioning Morehouse's\nright to set standards for Black men by requiring a dress code,\nwhich ensures order and continuity, but the statement that\nspeaks against wearing women's garments further marginal-\nizes certain students and creates a culture of homophobia on\ncampus, while instilling such warped homophobia in future\nleaders who will certainly face diverse sexualities in the work-\nplace. Of course, Morehouse is in a peculiar situation as an\nall-male college; anything other than heterosexuality goes\nagainst the very foundation the college is built on. The college\nfaces the difficult challenge of trying to include different sexu-\nalities without emasculating itself in the eyes of heterosexual\nand conservative supporters and fostering a platform that may\nintentionally lead to more gay and transsexual students apply-\ning to the university who may lean toward feminine aesthetics.\nHowever forming an appropriate dress code for those gay stu-\ndents with \"so-called\" feminine aesthetics would have been\nmuch more inclusive rather than issuing a broad statement that\nspeaks against such an aesthetic with very little explanation.\nThe major argument for dress codes is based on the theory\nthat learning socially appropriate manners and wearing\nappropriate attire to specific occasions and situations are\ncritical factors in the total educational process. It is true that\nlimited modalities of dress limit distractions, but there is\nsomething much more deliberate going on: control. The con-\ntrol of one's image that matches and perpetuates what society\nhas deemed as normal ways of dressing and acting for men\nand women. There is no room for in-betweeness or extrem-\nism. These dress code (and sometimes hair-style) restrictions\nnot only fight against the criminalization of urban wear by\npolice profiling and gangsta rap, but also draw from a\nVictorian discourse of rigidity when it comes to male and\nfemale attire. This is especially true on the campus of some\nHBCUs, as indicated by the conservative dress code policies\nof Oakwood University, Edward Waters College, Paul Quinn\nCollege, Norfolk State University, Virginia Union University,\nand Hampton University. All these universities filter their\ndress codes through the lens of gender-specific codes.\nThese gender-specific codes position the male body as\nalways cloaked in fabric whereas the female body is more\nrevealed with tight fitting outfits, regardless whether it is\nbusiness or casual dress, as objects of desire (Penney, 2012).\nIn other words, whereas a tight short mini skirt and low cut-\nting halter-top may violate the dress code for women, tight\nbusiness suits and heels do not. This standard of dress is part\nof a much broader view in the tradition of western dress prac-\ntices. Diana Crane (2000), a feminist scholar, notes that \"for\napproximately the past one hundred years, the expression of\nsexuality in men's clothes has been largely taboo, while\nwomen's clothes throughout the period remained sexually\nscholar, adds to Cranes' notion by positing that this western\ntradition of dress is organized around the principles of \"the\nmale gaze and the female's to-be-looked-at-ness\" (p. 6).\nThus, male patriarchal privilege enforces concealment for\nmen whereas women are revealed as their objects of desire.\nBecause sexuality and female liberation have become more\nvisible in society in general, these tightly structured dress\ncodes have met with resistance. As early as the 1980s, a\nnumber of designers of urban male wear experimented with\nmore fitted and skin-tight clothes for men by presenting the\nmale as a sexual object. Today you have hip-hop moguls\nsuch as Kayne West, P. Diddy, Pharrel Williams, and other\ndesigners moving beyond urban street wear to high fashion\nwhere skinny jeans, which were once considered off limits\nfor urban males, are now very popular. You only need to look\nat the performers of the 2014 BET Hip-Hop awards to see\nhow much. Such clothing presents important symbolic \"chal-\nIt has been difficult for males who choose to do so to flip the\nscript, so to speak, and reveal their bodies with tight clothes; this\nmight signal their own desire and interest in their own or another\nmale's sexual objectification and violate the established gender-\nspecific codes of hip-hop fashion, which greatly influence\nyoung Black men's attire in general. To remedy this, Black\nmales usually sag their skinny jeans or if they are wearing form\nfitting pants, they usually wear a long shirt-like garment that\nsometimes comes to their knees as not to draw attention to their\nform. Tight clothes that draw attention to the male form are per-\nceived as dangerous and threatening not only to the perceived\nnotion of masculinity but also to the entire western patriarchal\norder because of the potential of de-phallicization.\nOne must be aware, however, that arguments presented by\nCrane and Mulvey have not and do not always hold true for\nAfricanAmerican males. For example, the body of Black male\nslaves, according to Roach, was always presented nude during\nthe slave auction to show strength and work potential (Roach,\n1996). It must be noted, however, that Black males did not\nhave ownership of their bodies during slavery. The history of\nBlack male style in the States has also included a number of\ninterpreted examples of flamboyant and body-focused dress\nstyles, even when framed within a definitive heterosexual con-\ntext. For example, the form fitting style of Black dandyism\nwas prevalent in the 19th century (M. L. Miller, 2009). Dandy\nis defined as a man who affects extreme elegance in clothes\nand manners. The clothes may be loose or fitted. Dandyism\nhas experienced a revival of sorts with the appearance of\nmusic artist Jidenna and his hit song \"Classic Man\" (Mobisson,\nKwabena, & Wonder, 2015), which celebrates elegant dress-\ning and well-groomed hair (sometimes finger waves), good\nmanners, and taking care of your business. A similar style was\nechoed during the disco era of the 1970s, which consisted of\nform fitting bell-bottom pants for both men and women. It is\nimportant to note that the standards of dress concerning Black\nmales are sometimes inflected by race, class, and a number of\nother factors. The critiques presented here are just helpful\nways to understand the ways in which these gendered specific\ncodes of hip-hop are situated within the broader cultural con-\ntext of the United States.\nNonetheless, because of the challenges to these dress codes\nand other incidents involving LGBT students, Morehouse\nCollege in particular must be given credit for a number of\nforums on homosexuality and masculinity offered each semes-\nter. For spring 2013, Morehouse's Sociology Department\noffered the first course for the Black LGBT community for the\nuniversity titled \"A Genealogy of Black LGBT Culture and\nPolitics\" (Lee, 2013). Dr. Jafari Allen, a Morehouse alumnus\nand professor at Yale University taught the course by video-\nconference. This is progress, but a more powerful statement of\npurpose could have been made with a newly developed or\nrevamped course/curriculum on campus. And, the videocon-\nference course in some ways still positions the university lead-\ners as distancing themselves from the issues rather than\nactively engaging in them as faculty and administrators.\nNevertheless, the offering of this course is progress for the\nuniversity, but it is only a charge for Morehouse and other\nHBCUs to mend the psychic distance between tolerance and\nacceptance and move beyond an ideology of neutrality to a\nmore thoughtful, intentional engagement of issues relevant to\nthe Black LGBT community on their campuses.\nCreating Empowering Environments\nfor LGBT Students\nSuch intentional and inclusive engagement would allow all\nidentities and sexualities to navigate and be fully recognized\nby the university. LGBT students, staff, faculty, and adminis-\ntrators are instrumental in creating friendlier environments\ninstitutions. This can be accomplished by allowing LGBT\nstudents and organizations to present informational work-\nshops at convocation and throughout the semester. Guest\nspeakers and experts may also be invited to take part in these\nworkshops. Students may be allowed a day each week or\neach month to express themselves as they really see them-\nselves in decent fashion, a decency that needs to be defined\nthrough a collaboration between the university and LGBT\nstudents. Such special days can coincide with events on cam-\npus by these students to share their world, their joys, and\npains with the university community through entertainment\nevents and discussion forums. This allows a conversation\nabout sexualities to begin and a culture of existence, accep-\ntance, and tolerance to take root. Once again, dress codes\nalone only further marginalize LGBT students, making them\nthe targets of homophobia.\nMorehouse is used here as an example of only one institu-\ntion of social conservatism in practice. A number of HBCUs\nare facing the same problem. But what is impeding the\n"
