Massagli3\n'Department of Sociology, State University of New York at Buffalo.\nPopulation Research Institute, The Pennsylvania State University.\n'Center for Survey Research, University of Massachusetts-Boston.\nThe purpose of this study is to examine alternative pathways to laborforce exit among older men. Based on the life\ncourse perspective, we distinguish between crisp exits from the labor force, which are characterized as being\nunidirectional, and blurred transition patterns, which include repeated exits, entrances, and unemployment spells.\nUsing longitudinal datafrom the 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation, we find that one-quarter of the\nsample of men aged 55 to 74 at first interview experienced at least one transition in laborforce status over a 28-month\nobservation period. Fewer than half of these can be characterized as crisp exitsfrom the laborforce. Our multivariate\nanalysis suggests that blurred transition patterns are likely part of an effort to maintain economic status in later life.\nALIFE COURSE approach to late-life work behavior\nprompts us to consider the diversity of pathways out of\nthe labor force (Elder, 1985). Conventionally, a single,\nunreversed, and unambiguous exit from the labor force is\ncited as the normative pathway for relinquishment of the\nworker role. Based on this assumption, much extant research\nfocuses on the timing of retirement as a discrete event.\nRecent research illustrates clearly that these conventional\nunderstandings characterize the experience of only a seg-\nment of the older population. For many individuals, the\nretirement process is more consistent with the idea of a\n\"blurred\" transition, in that the pathway out of the world of\nwork may span months or even years, may include repeated\nmoves in and out of the workforce, and may even include\nperiods during which the roles of worker and retiree are held\nsimultaneously. In shaping a strategy for analysis, such a\nconceptualization directs our attention away from focusing\nstrictly on events and transitions, toward an examination of\nsequences of behavior. Recent research on labor force re-\nentry has documented one aspect of this sequence but ex-\ncludes other key components.\nWe estimate the extent to which \"crisp\" exit patterns are\ntypical of older men, and examine the alternative patterns\nevident in the life histories of individuals approaching the\nend of their work lives. Sources of this divergent patterning\nare then examined. Due to well-documented gender differ-\nences in work behavior throughout the life course (Moen and\nSmith, 1986), only men are examined to avoid the confound-\ning effects associated with the different processes underlying\nlabor force decision-making among men and women. Based\non our analyses, we suggest that blurred transitions may be\nstrategic: the result of status maintenance efforts on the part\nof many older men. These behaviors are most characteristic\nof those who are approaching old age with limited economic\nresources.\nLate-Life Labor Supply and Transition Behavior\nLabor force behavior in later life has substantial implica-\ntions for economic well-being (Pampel and Hardy, 1994) as\nwell as for status maintenance (Calasanti and Bonanno,\n1992), and earnings remain an important source of income\nresponse to the recognized importance of labor supply for\noverall well-being, a considerable volume of sociological\nand economic research has accumulated in an effort to\nunderstand the mechanisms underlying continued labor\nforce attachment. Some of this literature has been based on\ninsights offered by the life course perspective.\ntifies trajectory and transition as \"central themes\" in the\nstudy of the life course. Trajectories, or pathways as they are\nsometimes called, occur over an extended period of time and\nare composed of a sequence of events or transitions in state.\nA work trajectory, for example, is composed of a sequence\nof work transitions which may include employment, unem-\nployment, and nonparticipation over adult life. Events are\ninterdependent throughout the life course both within and\nacross trajectories. Early work experiences shape work be-\nhavior in later life, and components of different \"careers\"\nare linked. For example, work transitions may be linked to\nchanges in marital or parental roles. An essential goal of the\nlife course approach is to examine and understand diversity\nin the character of pathways, as well as of their component\nevents and sequences.\nConsistent with the life course approach, many research-\ners now view retirement as a process rather than a single\nevent or status. The status of \"retiree\" is not inevitable;\nmoreover, when entered it is not necessarily an absorbing\nstate. For example, Parnes and Sommers (1994) show that a\nsizable minority of men work past age 70 and occasionally\npast age 80. Further, late-life work transitions frequently\ninclude repeated work exits and reentry (Beck, 1985; Hay-\nward, Grady, and McLaughlin, 1988; Hayward, Hardy, and\nof partial retirement, or shifts to part-time work. In short,\nlabor force withdrawal patterns in later life are substantially\nmore complex than previously recognized (e.g., Anderson,\nrecognition of retirement as process rather than event, the\nresearch literature continues to focus on work-related\nevents, albeit increasingly examining a complex array of\noutcomes beyond labor force exit.\nTwo elements of life course transitions have received the\nmost extensive attention: (a) the timing of critical events; and\n(b) the extent to which linked transitions, or sequences, can\nbe considered orderly or disorderly in character. Studies of\nthe early stages of the adult life course have explored the\nimplications of early as opposed to late or on-time marriage,\nas well as the degree to which linked transitions such as\nschool-leaving, marriage, and parenthood follow a predicta-\nble, normative order. With reference to late-life work behav-\nior, an interest in the timing of labor force exit or retirement\nhas generated a considerable body of literature documenting\nthe secular decline in age at retirement as well as the growing\ndiversity in this timing. The overall level of order in the\nretirement process has received less attention, in part be-\ncause a clear conceptual understanding of what currently\ncharacterizes an \"orderly\" work-ending is lacking. Orderly\ntransitions imply that certain norms and values regarding the\ntiming and sequencing of linked roles underlie behavior; yet\nin the case of retirement, these norms have been changing\nAs an alternative conceptualization, orderly transitions may\nimply some concurrence between behavior and the individ-\nual's plans or expectations. Following this logic, Ekerdt,\nVinick, and Bosse (1989) find that although a large share of\ntheir study participants retired close to the time planned,\nabout one-third failed to meet their expectations (or, alterna-\ntively, failed to accurately predict timing), indicating a\nsubstantial degree of \"disorder\" in the retirement process.\nCrisp vs blurred patterns of laborforce exit. -- Rindfuss\n(1991) notes that events for which a precise time point can be\ndenned marking the end of all components of the first role\nand the beginning of the second, such as births or deaths,\nmay be considered \"crisp\" transitions. In contrast,\n\"blurred\" transitions are characterized by a gradual role\ntransition, or a period of time when the two roles are\noverlapping. For example, Rindfuss suggests that many\nyoung adults experience a transition from singlehood to\nmarried that has been blurred by cohabitation. In the case of\nlate-life work behavior, a clean break from employment via\na single, final labor force exit would reflect a crisp transition.\nA blurred transition is characterized by repeated labor force\nexits and entrances or the combination of retirement and\nwork. Although a close examination of blurred transitions as\nsuch has not yet occurred in the literature on late-life labor\nforce behavior, Pampel and Hardy (1994) cite the \"blur-\nring\" of work and retirement among those who partially\nretire, and others refer to the growing \"ambiguity\" of late-\nlife labor force experience (Schuller, 1989).\nInasmuch as blurred transitions measured explicitly as\nsequences or patterns of events are seldom examined, we\nhave little evidence regarding their significance (Rindfuss,\nextent to which transitions are crisp or blurred probably has\nimportant effects on subsequent stages of the life course,\"\nextant literature provides little direction for anticipating\nthese effects at any point in the life course. Abbott (1995;\nAbbott and Hrycak, 1990) suggests that the antecedents of\ndivergent patterns also may be important, and cautions\nagainst an exclusive emphasis on discrete and often presum-\nably \"normative\" transition patterns (e.g., a crisp exit to\nretirement). Following this logic, we expect that an exit\nembedded within a more complex pattern of change may be\ndifferent from the unidirectional, crisp exit conventionally\nknown as retirement, and that the antecedents of blurred\ntransitions may differ from those of crisp transitions.\nAntecedents of a blurred transition. -- For direction in\nanticipating the antecedents of blurred work transitions in\nlater life, we turn to the literature on status attainment and\nmaintenance in later life (e.g., Henretta and Campbell,\ndisadvantage is reproduced throughout the life course such\nthat individuals with marginal economic resources at midlife\ntypically enter old age in similar circumstances. Rather than\nbecoming either leveled or exacerbated with increasing age,\nstatus differences appear by and large to to be maintained in\nlater life. Pampel and Hardy (1994) note that, as in earlier\nstages of the life course, labor force behavior may be an\nimportant vehicle whereby status is negotiated in old age.\nThus, work behavior in later life may reflect underlying\ninequalities among members of the older population (Cala-\nFollowing these arguments, patterns of labor force activity\nin later life may be seen as extensions of behavior earlier in\nthe life course, as well as a response to threats to economic\nwell-being.\nThis view is consistent with a preponderance of research\nevidence on late-life labor supply in general, particularly\nresearch on low-wage populations and on reentry following\nretirement. For example, in her evaluation of work behavior\namong older African Americans, Gibson (1987) notes that\nworker and nonworker statuses often are confounded in that\nmany persons report being out of the labor force yet not\nretired -- a labor force category she terms the \"unretired-\nretired.\" Gibson argues that this hybrid status arises due to\nseveral conditions common among low-wage populations,\nincluding a lack of distinction between unstable work pat-\nterns in youth and old age, and a recognition that one must\ncontinue to work from time to time even beyond retirement\nage. One behavioral outcome of being \"unretired-retired\" is\na sequence of work and nonwork consistent with our descrip-\ntion of a \"blurred\" transition. Applied to lower status\npopulations in general, this argument clearly suggests that\n\"hybrid\" statuses as well as \"blurred\" transitions may be a\nresult of prior work patterns and limited economic resources.\nStudies focusing on transitions back into the labor force\nfollowing retirement also support this hypothesis. Calasanti\nand Bonanno (1992) find that many individuals reenter the\nwork force in an apparent struggle to maintain their preretire-\nment status or, at least, an acceptable standard of living.\nRuhm (1990) also suggests that reentry is linked to status\nmaintenance, finding that those ineligible for a pension are\nmore likely to cycle back into the work force.\nFollowing these insights, our primary hypothesis is that\neconomic resources -- specifically, lack of pension and low\nlevel of nonwage income -- are key factors dissuading\nolder men from crisp exits and permanent retirement, to-\nward more blurred transition patterns. That is, limited\nnonwork resources are expected to be associated with a\nhigher probability of experiencing a blurred labor force\nexit. Our emphasis on economic and status maintenance\narguments is consistent with the bulk of the research litera-\nture suggesting that these considerations play a dominant\nrole in labor supply decisions among older men (e.g.,\nFields and Mitchell, 1984). An accurate assessment of this\nhypothesis requires that we take into consideration addi-\ntional processes shaping blurred transitions, however. In-\ncluded among these alternatives are (a) the residual effects\nof unstable work patterns over the life course; (b) the\nobstacles to working posed by poor health; and (c) the\ndesire to maintain some attachment to the worker role.\nAs argued by Gibson (1987), repeated work transitions in\nlater life may be the result of similar patterns occurring\nearlier in the life course. We therefore expect that low levels\nof work experience earlier in life may carry over into old\nage, resulting in a pattern of blurred transitions. Many\nobservers note the growing importance of health and disabil-\nity on work patterns (Hayward and Grady, 1990; Smith,\n1985). Insofar as poor health serves as a barrier to work, it is\nexpected to be associated with nonwork and crisp exits as\nopposed to working. Among men who feel a strong norma-\ntive obligation to work, or those with only moderate disabili-\nties, health problems may result in blurred transition pat-\nterns. Finally, a segment of older men, particularly those\nwith careers that are intrinsically satisfying, may avoid\nnonwork well into the retirement years. Older men with a\nstrong preference for work or attachment to the work role,\nproxied here by occupation (Hayward and Grady, 1990;\nHayward, Hardy, and Grady, 1989) and education (Parnes\nand Sommers, 1994), may also display blurred exits from\nthe labor force. For these men, blurred transitions reflect the\ncontinued lure of the work role even in the absence of signifi-\ncant economic need.\nA life course approach to late-life labor force behavior\nsuggests that several alternative pathways to labor force exit\nlikely occur among the older population. Inasmuch as transi-\ntions in work status are costly in terms of wages, leisure,\ninvestment, and training or other costs, it can be assumed\nthat most decisions will reflect fairly stable commitments to\na given status. However, as documented here, some individ-\nuals display patterns of behavior that represent repeated,\nshort-term forays into and out of the labor force, often\naccompanied by spells of unemployment. Our goal in the\nensuing analysis is to estimate the extent to which such\nblurred transitions occur, and to establish key differences in\nthe behavioral antecedents of this patterning as opposed to\ncrisp transition patterns and nontransitional work statuses.\nMETHOD\nMethodological implications of the life course approach.\n-- The life course approach suggests that analytical attention\nmust be directed to both events and sequences or patterns.\nAlthough some investigations have focused on sequences\nusing the life course approach frequently focus on discrete\nevents, some of which conform to Rindfuss's (1991) defini-\ntion of a \"crisp\" transition and some of which are misclas-\nsified as such (Abbott, 1995). For example, a common\napproach in the literature on late-life work behavior involves\nestimating transitions based on pairs of observations one or\ntwo years apart, with interim statuses ignored, not observed,\nor assumed to be inconsequential. More complex patterns of\nchange, involving multiple transitions occurring over re-\npeated observations, have not been effectively summarized.\nRindfuss, 1991) point out that the development of dynamic\ntechniques such as hazards models or event history models,\nwhile providing a wealth of critical information about transi-\ntions which are in fact crisp, have supported this emphasis\non events, despite the theoretical arguments focusing also on\nsequences.\nThe practical significance of this emphasis for the problem\nat hand is central to our understanding of the diversity of\ntransition patterns. Insofar as work transitions in later life are\nof the \"crisp\" variety, event history-type models provide an\naccurate depiction of behavior. However, for the segment of\nthe population that displays blurred patterns of transitions,\nevent history-type models may be misleading. The argument\nthat a labor force exit (or entry, for that matter) takes its\nmeaning not in isolation as a change in status, but rather\nwithin a particular context of other exits (entries) preceding\nand following that event prompts us to consider blurred\ntransitions as patterns rather than as isolated events. In\nmaking this critical distinction between blurred and crisp\ntransitions, we are unable to make use of dynamic modeling\ntechniques that have been successful in the examination of\ndiscrete events. This is the result both of the fact that\ndynamic techniques for blurred transitions are not yet well\ndeveloped, and of limitations of the data set used here. The\nresultant loss of information on state duration is deemed a\nnecessary trade-off in our effort to learn more about the\npatterns anticipated here.\nThe data. -- We use data from the 1984 panel of the\nSurvey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP; for a\ndetailed description of these data, see Kasprzyk et al.,\n1987). The SIPP provides national coverage, relatively large\nsample size, and a wide range of relevant variables. Respon-\ndent data on labor force behavior as well as demographic\ncharacteristics, economic resources, and household and\nfamily composition are obtained at 4-month intervals. Dur-\ning the third wave of interviews, retrospective information\non work history and contemporaneous indicators of health\nare acquired; during the fourth wave of interviews, informa-\ntion describing pension eligibility is recorded. The focus of\nour analysis is the labor force data recorded at each of the\nfirst eight interviews, describing behavior of the respondent\nover the month prior to interview.\nOur analysis focuses on White and Black men aged 55 to\n74 at first interview, who report having had at least 6 months\nof continuous work history at some time during their lives.\nOur sample excludes men who have had a life-long disability\nand/or who lack any appreciable work attachment. Age 55 is\nwidely regarded as the normative lower limit of the transition\nto retirement period (DeViney and O'Rand, 1988), and few\nmen over age 74 are working or considering work. More-\nover, we exclude men who are neither White nor Black due\nto the small number of respondents reporting other races.\nThe sample is further restricted to individuals who did not\nleave the sample prior to the end of the survey. Attrition rates\nand patterns of premature exit in the SIPP are similar to those\nin other national longitudinal surveys (Citro and Kalton,\nAssessing blurred transition behavior. -- Our measure-\nment strategy is designed to distinguish among those who\ndisplay crisp versus blurred labor force transition patterns.\nContrasts are further developed with those who report no\ntransitions in labor force status over the observation period,\nbeing either continuously working or nonworking. We de-\nvelop a categorical measure that summarizes behavior over a\nperiod of time. As noted by Moen (1985), this focus is\nconsistent with the life course approach in its emphasis on\npatterns of attachment and on continuities and discontinui-\nties in labor supply, as opposed to likelihood of employment\nat a particular point in time. The key indicators of work\nbehavior assessed here include employment status and un-\nemployment experience. Our outcome measure identifies\nmeaningful transitions across these statuses and summarizes\nthem over eight observations in the SIPP, spanning 28\nmonths. We first classify respondents at each observation\naccording to whether they are working, unemployed, or not\nworking during the month preceding interview. In summa-\nrizing these behaviors over the eight observations, the poten-\ntial for a very large and intractable number of unique re-\nsponse patterns exists. In our initial examinations of the\ndata, we discovered that many of the theoretically possible\npatterns do not emerge in the data. In addition, a substantial\nshare of the observed patterns reflects minor differences in\ntiming as opposed to sequence (e.g., exiting work in the\nthird as opposed to the fifth wave). The patterns reflecting\nunique yet meaningful sequences are portrayed in Table 1.\nResponse patterns A and B reflect nontransitional statuses\nand, taken together, capture the activity of about three-\nquarters of the sample. Pattern A represents the group of\nrespondents who report working in all waves of the survey.\nAbout a third of the weighted sample displays this pattern.\nOur decision to assign individuals who report being unem-\nployed during a single wave to the continuously employed\ncategory (Pattern A) is designed to avoid including with the\ntransitional groups those who report single, short-term un-\nstable events (about 5.5% of Pattern A). Men who move\nbetween full-time and part-time work over the course of the\nsurvey, but reported no other changes in work status, are\nalso included in Pattern A. Pattern B includes those in a\ncontinuous nonworking status during the survey: this pattern\ncaptures 41 percent of the sample.\nPattern C is termed \"crisp exit\" because a single exit\nfrom the labor force, representing 10 percent of the sample,\nis observed. This pattern is one that researchers and lay\npersons alike perceive as normative and traditional. The final\npattern (D) includes respondents who report two or more\ntransitions between labor force participation and nonpartici-\npation, two or more spells of unemployment, or a combina-\ntion of spells of unemployment, labor force exit, and/or re-\nentry, and makes up our blurred transition category. Individ-\nuals observed making a single reentry to the workforce are\nalso included in this category. Although in preliminary\nanalyses reentrants were retained as a distinct response\npattern, this category included only 1.4 percent of the\nsample, fewer than 50 cases, making detailed analysis inad-\nvisable. Moreover, logistic regression models indicate mini-\nmal differences in the antecedents of reentry and other\ntransition patterns making up Pattern D.\nFifteen percent of the sample respondents are included in\nthis category; inflating the sample data to population levels,\nthis represents over two million men in this age group. These\nresults show that blurred transition patterns are common\namong older men, at least as common as crisp exits. Addi-\ntional analysis of the blurred category reveals that about two-\nthirds reported two or more transitions in and out of the labor\nforce. More than half of these respondents experienced some\nunemployment, and nearly 60 percent reported some part-\ntime work, although most were predominantly employed\nfull-time during their work episodes. Due to the censored\nnature of these data (ending after 28 months of observation),\nwe cannot know how many of those reentering would subse-\nquently re-exit or, indeed, how many experiencing a crisp\nexit during the observation period may have subsequently re-\nentered. Our \"uncensored\" cases (those exiting during the\nsecond wave and reentering prior to the end of study) re-\nentered about six months following exit, on average, sug-\ngesting that some share of the single exit group would have\nreturned had the study period continued. As noted by Hay-\nward, Hardy, and Liu (1994), reentry following exit occurs\nquickly, if at all. Moreover, about half of the men observed\nTable 1.

Based on a description of these patterns,\nand consistent with Gibson's observations, we argue that\nmany reentries are of short duration and represent blurred\npatterns of exit rather than a recommitment to the work role.\nDue to the relatively short 28-month window of observa-\ntion, our estimate of the rate of blurred transitions for this\ngroup is somewhat conservative. While it is unlikely that the\ncontinuously nonparticipating men would reenter the\nworkforce, it is probable that some of the men continuously\nworking during our observation period will experience\nblurred exits and, as noted, some share of the crisp exit\ngroup may have been initiating or ending a blurred pattern\nnot observed here. These patterns are therefore not as dis-\ntinct as would be afforded by a data set with a longer panel\nlength. However, the repeated, closely spaced observations\noffered by the SIPP are essential to a test of our hypotheses,\nand the conservative nature of these estimates should be kept\nin mind as we discuss the results of the analysis.\nIndependent variables. -- The key antecedents of transi-\ntion patterns examined here are the economic constraints to\nnonwork posed by low levels of nonwage income and lack of\npension. We assess pension eligibility by reports of receipt\nof private pension income or future eligibility for receipt if\nthe individual should stop working. Nonwork income is\nassessed by combining all nonwage income of the respon-\ndent and his spouse, if married, plus the wife's earnings, if\nany are reported, for the 4 months prior to interview. In other\nwords, this indicator includes all income of the individual or\ncouple less the respondent's own earnings (see Parnes and\nSommers [1994] for a similar measurement strategy). Al-\nthough taking partner's income into account is essential for\nproviding an estimate of a person's actual standard of living,\nthis strategy likely overstates the standard of living among\nmarried persons as compared to single persons. Therefore,\nmarried persons' joint income is deflated by 0.8, yielding an\nestimate of family nonwage income that takes into account\neconomies of scale associated with marriage as well as the\nextra costs and resources of additional members. Our mea-\nsure of income underestimates the nonwork income of those\nrespondents who are still working and not receiving transfer\nincome, such as pensions or Social Security, to which they\nmight be entitled if they were to stop working. Pames and\nSommers (1994) suggest that the extent to which this endo-\ngeneity is a problem may be assessed by estimating the\nmultivariate coefficients while excluding income from the\nmodel. We consider this issue further in the Results section.\nAs noted above, likely alternatives to this effect include\n(a) the residual effects of unstable work patterns over the life\ncourse; (b) the obstacles to working posed by poor health;\nand (c) the desire to maintain some attachment to the worker\nrole. To assess unstable work patterns we start with the self-\nreported number of years during which the respondent\nworked at least half of the year, the only measure of work\nexperience available in the SIPP. These self-reported years\nof experience reflect differences in work attachment due to a\nvariety of factors, including educational activities and age-\ngraded and cohort variations in work patterns as well as gaps\nor discontinuities in work attachment. Our final measure\nidentifies those falling into the bottom quintile of experi-\nence, adjusted for education and age. This measure is not\nsignificantly associated with self-reported levels of retire-\nment, suggesting that it is not simply a proxy for early\nwithdrawal from the labor force. Moreover, pension eligibil-\nity is significantly less common among the low-experience\ngroup, suggesting that this group is marginal in terms of\nwork attachments.\nHealth is based on respondent rating, using a 5-point scale\nranging from excellent (1) to poor (5). Self-reported health is\nobtained in the third wave of the SIPP, or about one year into\nthe interview cycle. Some observers suggest that self-reports\nof this kind reflect a desirability bias whereby those who are\nnot working justify this status through real or fictive reports\nof poor health. Alternative measures, such as reports of bed\ndays or visits to health care professionals, suffer from\nresponse biases as well (see Bound, 1991, for discussion).\nWe use this measure with appropriate caution.\nPreference for work is a difficult concept to measure with\nthe best of data, and the SIPP includes no attitudinal infor-\nmation that might directly assess attachment to the work\nrole. We proxy preferences using a combination of educa-\ntional attainment and occupation. In addition to capturing\n\"taste\" for work, education provides an indirect measure of\nexpected wage rate, work skills, and wealth (Parnes and\nSommers, 1994). After exploring many different transfor-\nmations of educational attainment, we determined that the\nbest model fit was provided by a simple continuous measure\nof years of formal education. For occupation, a categorical\nmeasure contrasts those reporting professional or managerial\noccupations with all others. We reason that these occupa-\ntions may be more linked to one's sense of identity as well as\noffering more intrinsic rewards and fewer physical demands.\nWe assign occupation based on our best assessment of career\njob, which takes into consideration current labor force sta-\ntus, pension receipt, and tenure in current or most recent job.\nSeveral other variables have been discussed in the litera-\nture as important in conditioning labor supply decisions,\nincluding respondent's age, self-employment status (Blau,\ninterview. Self-employment status is based on current or\nmost recent job. Marital status is based on presence of a\nspouse and her labor force status. In preliminary analyses,\npresence of dependent children in the household was also\nincluded in the model as a control for possible ongoing\ndemand for wage income (Hardy, 1982; Hausman and Wise,\n1985). It is excluded in the present analysis due to lack of\ncontribution to statistical fit of the model.\nRESULTS\nWe begin our analysis by exploring the association be-\ntween the patterns of work behavior and age. Inasmuch as\nthe age dependence of labor supply is well-established\n(Peracchi and Welch, 1994), the extent to which age deter-\nmines the patterns of change addressed here is an important\nquestion. Cumulative percentage distributions of these labor\nforce patterns by single years of age at initial interview are\nI\nI\nI\no\nBlurred \u00b7 Crisp \u00b7 No Work M Working\nFigure 1. Labor force transition patterns by age.\ndisplayed in Figure 1. Because the labor force patterns\ndepicted here summarize behavior over a 2-year period, and\nage is reported at the beginning of these 2 years, this graph\nindicates patterns of change by initial age. For example,\nroughly 68 percent of those age 55 at initial interview\nreported continuous labor force participation throughout this\n2-year period. In contrast, only about 15 percent of those age\n65 at first interview experienced continuous participation.\nThis figure shows that the majority of all age groups report\nno transitions in work status, either working at all observa-\ntions or reporting no work during this time period, although\nthe balance between participation and nonparticipation shifts\nwith initial age. Among the youngest respondents, nearly 80\npercent are in the same labor force status across each inter-\nview, about 70 percent working and 10 percent reporting no\nwork. Around 85 percent of the oldest members of the study\ndisplay unchanging patterns of behavior, and the vast major-\nity of these are nonworkers throughout the observation\nperiod. The crisp exit pattern is most commonly observed\namong men younger than age 65. Blurred transition patterns\nare not unique to any particular age group, but are somewhat\nmore common for men aged 60 to 67 at first interview.\nBeyond the age of 68, blurred transitions are uncommon,\nindicating that labor force exit and the status of nonworker\nare more permanent among the oldest men.\nTable 2 includes descriptions of the bivariate associations\namong the key independent variables and the four labor force\nactivity patterns developed for this analysis. Although these\nresults are not discussed here, we note that most of the\nvariables have statistically significant bivariate associations\nwith the work behavior patterns.\nMultivariate results. -- To estimate our multivariate\nmodels, we use multinomial logistic regression techniques\n(Maddala, 1983). Our categorical measure of work behavior\nis regressed on the key independent variables as well as the\ncontrol variables (see Table 3). Models including interac-\ntions with age and with other independent variables were\ntested but are not presented here due to consistently weak\ncontributions to model fit; relevant exceptions to this gener-\nalization are discussed below.\nOur primary hypothesis is that limited economic resources\noutside of one's own earned income, assessed here by\npension availability and nonwage income, are associated\nwith blurred transitions as opposed to crisp exits and perma-\nnent nonwork. Substantial support for this hypothesis is\nprovided in Table 3. Holding constant those measures\nreflecting alternative processes that may shape blurred tran-\nsitions, such as low work experience, men who report\nreceiving or being eligible for pension income are signifi-\ncantly more likely to experience a crisp exit as opposed to a\nblurred transition over the course of the observation period.\nInteraction terms of pension with age (not shown) suggest\nthat the effect of pension eligibility declines with age.

Individuals with limited\neconomic resources are significantly less likely than their\nbetter-off counterparts to display smooth and unreversed\nexits from the labor force. Phrased differently, low levels of\nnonwage income appear to prompt some older men to\ndisplay continued attachments to the workforce, albeit in\nsporadic patterns. The finding that nonwage income is nega-\ntively associated with continuous work as opposed to blurred\ntransition patterns may indicate that the most economically\ninsecure individuals are unable to reduce their work commit-\nment, and instead work consistently without sporadic exits.\nNote, however, that level of nonwork income may be parti-\nally endogenous with work status in that continuous workers\nmay not yet be receiving the full amount of Social Security\nand pension income for which they may be eligible. We\ncannot completely resolve this problem using the SIPP data.\nHowever, excluding the income variable from the otherwise\nfull model yields similar results (see Parnes and Sommers\n[1994] for a similar strategy). As an additional check, an\nestimate of nonwork income based on income at final inter-\nview is substituted for the initial estimate reported in Table\n3. Results based on income at the final observation point are\nsimilar to those reported here, with the notable exception\nthat nonwork income becomes positive and significant for\nTable 3.

The crisp exit group of men comprises those for\nwhom nonwork income estimated after labor force exit\noccurs (end of survey) would be a substantially better esti-\nmate of income in the absence of work. Taken together, we\nare confident that economic shortfalls prompt some men to\nexperience multiple, short-term forays into and out of the\nlabor force and that this process is central to the experience\nof blurred transition patterns.\nThe alternative processes posed above receive mixed sup-\nport. Gibson (1987) and others suggest that multiple transi-\ntions in work status may simply be a reflection of work\npatterns established earlier in the life course. Our evaluation\nof this possibility suggests that men reporting very low levels\nof work experience are significantly more likely to display\nblurred transition patterns than to work continuously. Experi-\nence levels do not distinguish between crisp and blurred\ntransition patterns, however, and those with low experience\nare less likely to display blurred transitions than to be out of\nthe labor force for the entire observation period. We conclude\nthat unstable patterns of work earlier in the life course are not\nconsistently associated with blurred transitions in later life.\nNot surprisingly, strong health effects are evident. Poor\nhealth appears to form a powerful barrier to working even\nsporadically. Those in poorer health are significantly more\nlikely to report no work for the entire observation period,\nand to display a crisp exit from the labor force. Although\npoorer health is associated with blurred transition patterns in\ncontrast to continuous work, additional analysis (not re-\nported here) shows that those in the poorest health are more\nlikely to display a crisp exit or no work at all.\nThe final alternative to the economic argument is that some\nmen have a strong preference for work and may avoid\nnonwork. Insofar as preference can be proxied by educational\nlevel and professional or managerial occupation, we find only\nlimited support for this explanation. Although the coefficients\nfor occupation are signed in the predicted direction, none\napproach statistical significance. More highly educated men\nare more likely to work continuously than to display a blurred\ntransition pattern, but none of the other education contrasts\nare significant. (In additional analyses not shown here, higher\neducation is also significantly associated with working con-\ntinuously vs nonwork, but has no effect on the likelihood of a\ncrisp exit vs working continuously.)\nThe remainder of Table 3 includes the coefficients for the\ncontrol variables, which will be discussed only briefly. Self-\nemployed men are significantly less likely to report no work\nand are more likely to report continuous work. In terms of\nmarital status, the coordination of work behavior between\nspouses is observed, and an avoidance of the blurred transi-\ntion pattern by men with nonworking wives. Race has no\nsignificant effect on any contrast. Age shows a predictable\nassociation in that men move away from work participation\nas they age. The inclusion of two spline factors in the model\nillustrates that, as indicated in Figure 1, blurred transitions\nare particularly common among men in their early to mid-\n60s. The last column in Table 3 shows that the likelihood of a\ncrisp versus blurred transition increases with age, flattens\nThis suggests that the blurred patterns discussed here may be\nparticularly common among men who have initiated a retire-\nment process in their mid-to-late 60s.\nDISCUSSION\nCurrent literature on late-life labor force behavior docu-\nments a growing diversity in patterns of work participation\namong older men. Consistent with a life course approach, this\nstudy develops estimates of the extent to which patterns of\nchange in late-life work behavior represent \"crisp\" exits\nfrom the work role as opposed to \"blurred\" pathways to\nlabor force exit. Our research shows that blurred transitions,\ndefined here as repeated transitions between nonwork, work,\nand unemployment, are relatively common among older men:\namong the 25 percent of the sample experiencing at least one\nsignificant work transition event, we find that fewer than half\nof the transitions are crisp exits from the labor force.\nThe multivariate analysis shows that many older men\nexperience blurred transition patterns as part of a strategy to\nmaintain economic status in later life. Nonwage income and\npension availability are most consistently associated with\nthe likelihood of displaying blurred transition patterns.\nAvailability of a pension appears to precipitate a crisp exit\nfrom the work role. In contrast, those with neither a pension\nnor adequate nonwage resources of other kinds retain an\nattachment to the work role, albeit some on a sporadic\nbasis. Alternative hypotheses regarding blurred exit pat-\nterns received equivocal support. Sporadic work experi-\nences in the past, assessed by a cumulative measure of\nexperience, are associated with blurred transition patterns\nas well as nonwork, but do not distinguish between crisp\nand blurred exits. Poor health is a very important part of the\nmodel, but primarily distinguishes between those who are\nnot working or who display a crisp exit, and those who\nretain either a continuous or sporadic attachment to the\nwork role. Preference for continued work, although only\nassessed here using proxies of education and occupation,\nappears to have little impact.\nThe relatively high rates of blurred exit for this sample of\nolder men suggest that for many men, no single event\ncharacterizes the transition to retirement. This finding sup-\nports the call for more attention directed toward patterns of\nbehavior and the process of labor force exit as opposed to\ncross-sectional statuses or single transitions. A core of older\nindividuals cycling in and out of the labor force, while\npossibly meeting many needs for short-term work assign-\nments, also represents substantial turnover costs for some\norganizations. The implications of this behavior for individ-\nual economic well-being, as well as for the labor force as a\nwhole, require continued examination.\nWe conclude that the high rates of blurred transitions\nreported here present a challenge both to the traditional\nimage of the older worker, and to emerging understandings\nof reentry and partial retirement. We acknowledge, how-\never, that patterns observed in the future may represent\ntime period under study here followed a period of unusually\nhigh unemployment, during which many older men may\nhave experienced spells of discouragement, other nonwork,\nand threats to their employment that could have had residual\nimpacts over the subsequent few years. We anticipate that\nblurred transition patterns will be increasingly common.\nHerz (1995) notes that the rate of working among older\npensioners has risen consistently over the last decade, and\nconcludes that increasing opportunities posed by the grow-\ning service economy and increasing part-time job opportuni-\nties likely play a role in this increase. These structural\nchanges in the economy will be important in shaping transi-\ntion patterns. Recently implemented and proposed changes\nin the social security system, including the increasing age at\nwhich full benefits may be received, penalties for early\nretirement, and earnings exemption amounts will also have\nan impact. Additional research examining alternative time\nperiods is necessary to establish the roles of macroeconomic\nfactors, industrial shifts, and policy innovation on the diver-\nsity of pathways to labor force exit.\n"
