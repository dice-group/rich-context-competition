Analyses\nof item-response distributions, internal consistency, criterion validity, and discriminant validity indicated that the scale had\nacceptable reliability and performed well in preliminary tests of validity. Furthermore, dyadic confirmatory factor analysis\nrevealed that the theoretical factor structure was valid and similar across partners, suggesting that men and women define\nand value quality of life in a similar way.\n",

This is due in part to reduced\nsocioeconomic disparities (Marmot and Smith, 1989;\nbetween socioeconomic status (SES) and healthy lifestyles\nranks near the middle of nations in happiness and is the\nunhappiest of industrialized countries (Inglehart, 1990).\nAlso, happiness rates have remained steady since the 1960s\n(Veenhoven, 2004). Because of the disparity between phys-\nical and economic indicators and subjective life evalua-\ntions, studies that measure happiness and well-being in\nmultiple domains have drawn greater attention (Asada and\nQuality of life (QOL) refers to one's satisfaction in impor-\ntant domains of life as judged by one's own standards and\nculture (WHOQOL Group, 1995). The World Health\nOrganization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) working group\nhas developed a comprehensive QOL assessment, the\nfacets of life organized into six domains (WHOQOL Group,\n1998b). Its abbreviated version, the WHOQOL-BREF,\ncontains 26 items and is used for epidemiological surveys\nand clinical trials (WHOQOL Group, 1998a). Psychometric\nstudies support the WHOQOL-BREF's validity for general\nWHOQOL Group, 1998a) and in many countries (Min et al.,\n2002). However, some international studies failed to repli-\ncate the original item structure (Moreno et al., 2006; Yao\net al., 2008). In Japan, the psychometric properties of the\nWHOQOL-BREF have not been replicated since the original\nfield trial (Skevington et al., 2004), and the factor structure\nhas not yet been validated. Further studies on well-being\nrequire a thorough psychometric assessment of the Japanese\nAnother important question regarding the WHOQOL-\nBREF construct is whether men and women define QOL\nThe psychometric properties of the\nWHOQOL-BREF in Japanese couples\nNaomi Yoshitake1, Yi Sun1, Masumi Sugawara1,\nSatoko Matsumoto1, Atsushi Sakai2, Junko Takaoka3\nand Noriko Goto3\n Keywords\ndyadic confirmatory factor analysis, Japanese couples, quality of life, WHOQOL-BREF\n1Ochanomizu University, Japan\n2Tokyo Metropolitan University, Japan\n3Benesse Educational Research & Development Institute, Japan\nCorresponding author:\nNaomi Yoshitake, Ochanomizu University, 2-1-1 Otsuka, Bunkyo-Ku,\nEmail: yoshitake.naomi@ocha.ac.jp\nReport of Empirical Study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nsimilarly. Close relationships work to provide a key context\nfor well-being (Reis et al., 2000). As people get married,\nhave children, and age together in a shared life circum-\nstances (e.g. social interactions, diets, lifestyles), one per-\nson's satisfaction with life can affect their partner's\nwell-being. On the other hand, as QOL is a subjective expe-\nrience (WHOQOL Group, 1995), the perceived satisfaction\nwith the living circumstances may vary across partners.\nAmong sparse literature investigating similarity in QOL\nconceptualization across partners, Wang et al. (2006a)\nshowed that mothers and fathers of children with disabili-\nties did not differ in assessments of family QOL in terms of\nmeasurement construct, weighted importance of factors, or\nlevel of satisfaction. Nevertheless, whether QOL similarity\nis generally true for a normative sample of married couples\nwith children is unknown. Thus, this study aims to provide\nempirical evidence to validate the content equivalence of\nthe WHOQOL-BREF across married partners with chil-\ndren. If the instrument measures the underlying QOL con-\nstruct equally across husbands and wives, further study to\ninvestigate possible differences or similarities between\nhusbands' and wives' assessments of their well-being is\ntheoretically warranted.\nThis study used a large sample of married adults at dif-\nferent stages in their childrearing to thoroughly examine\nthe psychometric properties of the Japanese WHOQOL-\nBREF and determined the construct validity of the instru-\nment by testing whether the factor structure had similar fit\nfor husbands and wives.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants came from two studies. The Survey on\nPregnancy, Childbirth, and Child-Rearing assessed the\nwell-being of first-time parents and their experiences of\nconception, birth, and childrearing, and their impact on\ndaily life. First-time pregnant women in the second half of\ntheir pregnancies and their husbands as well as heterosex-\nual couples raising their first-born child (between 0 and\nyears of age) were randomly selected from Benesse\nEducational Research and Development Institute's data-\nbase (Benesse Child Sciences and Parenting Research\nOffice, 2013). The survey was conducted in two rounds,\nand in each, 8000 survey packets containing two identical\nquestionnaires for a couple were mailed to eligible house-\nholds. Two postage-paid envelopes were included so that\nParticipants were given a baby care gift worth \u00a5500.\ntion duration of 14years and a median adjusted household\nThe second sample was from an ongoing longitudinal\nstudy, QOL and Mental Health across the Life Span Survey\n(Sugawara et al., 2014).

These items are assumed to assess four\nimportant domains of life: physical, psychological, social\nrelationships, and environment QOL. In addition, the\ninstrument contains two general items assessing general\nQOL and general health. The Japanese WHOQOL-BREF\nhas been tested for content equivalence with the original\nEnglish version (Tazaki and Nakane, 1997). Scores for\neach item range from 1 (poor) to 5 (good), with higher\nscores indicating greater QOL.\nStatistical analysis\nNormality, reliability, and validity were assessed using\nstandard psychometric methods (Skevington et al., 2004;\nWHOQOL Group, 1998b). Together with skewness and\nkurtosis coefficients, the normality of the items was exam-\nined. Specifically, items were checked for floor and ceiling\neffects, which were considered present if more than 15per-\ncent of respondents belonged to the lowest/highest response\ncategory (McHorney and Tarlov, 1995). Internal consist-\nency was assessed using Cronbach's , which is convention-\nCriterion-related validity was evaluated by correlating each\nitem with its respective domain score (corrected for over-\nlap). To assess discriminant validity, we examined the dif-\nference in mean scores of each item between the upper and\nlower 30percent of participants with domain scores as crite-\nria (Findley, 1956). All analyses were conducted separately\nYoshitake et al. 3\nby gender. Statistics were calculated using SPSS for\nWe followed guidelines provided by Kenny et al.\n(2006) for dyadic confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). We\ncorrelated the error terms of husbands and wives for each\nitem to account for the potential influence of marital\ninteraction on each partner's responses. The dyadic CFA\nalso includes a correlation between the latent factors of\nthe two persons. Next, we examined the factor invariance\nfor husbands and wives by comparing a model in which\nloadings on each measure were free to vary for both\nhusbands and wives to a model where the paths from the\nfirst-order factors to the second-order factor were set as\nequal for the two members. If the latter model demon-\nstrated equal or better fit than the unconstrained model,\nthen the model was assumed to fit similarly between the\nhusbands and wives.\nSeveral goodness-of-fit indices were examined to assess\nand compare model fit. Comparative fit index (CFI) values\ngreater than .90 were considered to indicate a good fit\n(Kline, 1998), whereas root mean square error of approxi-\nmation (RMSEA) values ranging from .05 to .08 were pre-\nferred (Kenny and McCoach, 2003). Significant chi-square\ncomparisons of model fit indicate that the simpler model\n(with fewer free parameters) should be rejected (Kenny\net al., 2006). Data were organized in a pairwise dyadic\nstructure, and CFA was conducted with AMOS (Arbuckle,\nlihood estimation method.\nEthical considerations\nPermission to use the Japanese WHOQOL-BREF (Tazaki\nand Nakane, 1997) was granted by paying a fee to the\ndistributor. Data collection was conducted by survey\ncompanies in Tokyo, which carry the PrivacyMark certifi-\ncation for personal information protection in compliance\nwith Japanese Industrial Standards. Participation was\nvoluntary and informed consent was obtained by filling\nout questionnaires. Responses were anonymously indexed\nso that personal information was not disclosed to the\nresearchers.\nResults\nCharacteristics of study sample\nCombining surveys, the overall sample size was 10,693\n(including 4376 couples). The sociodemographic charac-\nteristics of the sample are shown in Table 1.\nData quality\nTable 2 presents descriptive statistics for each WHOQOL-\nBREF item for husbands and wives. Seven of the 26 items\nhad ceiling effects for both sexes, six of which were com-\nmon for couples: pain and discomfort (Q3), medication\ndependency (Q4), energy (Q5), spirituality (Q6), negative\nfeelings (Q26), and safety (Q8).\nCoefficients of skewness fell between -1.0 and 1.0\nfor almost all items; two items for husbands (Q3 and Q4)\nand one item for wives (Q4) had skewness coefficients\nslightly beyond this range. Similarly, kurtosis coeffi-\ncients for both sexes were satisfactory, with exception of\na few items exceeding this range (Q3 and Q4 for hus-\nbands, and Q4 for wives). The mean and median item\nscores further confirmed that participants considered\ntheir QOL to be positive (Table 2). Less than 1percent of\nparticipants (n=93, .9%) had missing data on more than\nfive items.\nInternal consistency\nCronbach's  values are shown in Table 3. These were\nacceptable for physical, psychological, and environment\ndomains (.72\u00ad.77), but poor for the social-relationships\ndomain (.61). Although removing one item regarding sex-\nual satisfaction (Q21) somewhat improved internal consist-\nency estimates, given that this domain has only three items\nand that similar  values have been reported in a previous\nstudy (Skevington et al., 2004), this item was retained in\nfurther analyses.\nTwo of seven items in the physical domain had low cor-\nrelation coefficients with the other items in this domain for\npsychological domain, one item assessing negative feelings\n(Q26) showed lower corrected item-total correlations for\nhusbands and wives. The sexual-activity item also showed\nlow correlation with other items in the social domain, sug-\ngesting again that it might not be a good measure of social-\nrelationship quality.\nTable 1.

All\ndomain scores were moderately correlated with Q1 (r=.33\u00ad\n=\n.28\u00ad.54). All individual items were also\nfairly to moderately correlated with Q1 (r=.08\u00ad.44) and\nQ2 (r=.17\u00ad.44). These results indicate that all items and all\nfour derived domain scores exhibited reasonable criterion\nvalidity. The results of t-tests for item discrimination indi-\ncated that item scores significantly differed between the\nupper and lower 30percent of participants (Table 3). Thus,\nall items were able to successfully discriminate between\ntwo groups of participants for husbands and wives.\nDyadic CFA\nThe WHOQOL-BREF assumes a hierarchical structure in\nwhich the four first-order domains are influenced by the\nsecond-order factor, QOL. As recommended for CFA with\npaired data, we constructed two identical QOL models for\nhusbands and wives and correlated the QOL factor and\nerrors across the same observed variables between couples\n(Kenny et al., 2006). The initial model fit poorly: 2\nmodified the model by adding two pairs of error covari-\nance--between Q3 and Q4, and Q8 and Q9, as indicated by\nthis modified model fit was still unsatisfactory, 2\nsquare difference test indicated a significant improvement,\nperformed to explore possible improvements.

All correlation coefficients are significant at p<.01 (two-tailed).\nYoshitake et al. 5\nNext, we tested whether the second-order WHOQOL-\nBREF factor structure fit for both husbands and wives. We\ntested a model in which the paths from the first-order fac-\ntors to the second-order factor were constrained to be equal\nfor both husbands and wives. We then compared this model\nwith a model in which paths were free to vary between hus-\nbands and wives. The constrained model demonstrated a\nbetter fit than the unconstrained model, 2 (df)=28.38\n<\n.01, suggesting a similar factor structure between\nhusbands and wives.\nThe final model is depicted in Figure 1 and standardized\nestimates are shown in Table 4. For both husbands and\nwives, all items had substantial factor loadings on corre-\nsponding factors (.19\u00ad.77) and first-order factors had high\nloadings on the common factor (.60\u00ad.99). In addition,\nfirst-order factor loadings were similar between partners.\nThe correlation between second-order latent factor scores\nwas significant, r=.29, p<.01, indicating that husbands'and\nwives' QOL reports correlated weakly, but significantly.\nDomain scores within a couple\nWe examined the relationships and differences between\nhusbands' and wives' domain scores.

The instrument performed\nwell at assessing QOL of Japanese married adults, although\nsome areas require further attention.\nDistribution analyses showed that 7 of the 26 items\nexhibited ceiling effects and skew toward higher scores.\nThese positive QOL scores may reflect how most partici-\npants were in good health. However, \"pain and discomfort\"\n(Q3) and \"medication dependency\" (Q4) are of concern\nbecause nearly half of responses reached ceiling for both\nhusbands and wives. Furthermore, the contribution of these\nitems to the physical health domain was limited: the vari-\nance explained by Q3 was 7\npercent for husbands and\npercent for wives and by Q4 was 4\npercent for both.\nConsidering the low dependency on medical treatment and\nmorbidity among adults aged 30\u00ad50years, these items may\nnot serve to differentiate individuals in our sample. Adding\nan error covariance term between these items and addi-\ntional four error covariance terms were necessary to gain\nsatisfactory fit. These paired items may have similar\nTable 4.

As\nin other Asian countries (Leung et al., 2005; Min et al.,\nactivity\" did not work reliably with other items in the social\ndomain. The item's contribution to the domain was low:\npercent for husbands and 16\npercent for wives, and the\nhigh kurtosis may indicate that sexual life is a sensitive\nvey confidentiality should be emphasized (Li et al., 2009).\nAlternatively, this item may need rephrasing to better fit the\nsocial domain or reorganizing as an independent domain\n(Wang et al., 2006b). Future studies need to validate the\nsocial domain by investigating correlations with other rela-\ntionship measures.\nDiscriminant and criterion-related validity analyses dem-\nonstrated that the instrument effectively assessed QOL in\nJapanese married couples with children, in line with previ-\net al., 2012). The construct validity was assessed using\ndyadic CFA, which allows testing of the instrument's struc-\nture using couples. The fit of the theoretical structure was\nacceptable, as shown previously (Min et al., 2002;\nSkevington et al., 2004). Additionally, the similar factor\nstructures for husbands and wives suggested that both inter-\npreted items similarly. Thus, gender differences in QOL can\nnow be interpreted as more than merely differences in how\nhusbands and wives define QOL. Finally, QOL reports were\nweakly but significantly correlated within couples. Partners\nagreed strongly in the environment domain, likely because a\nmarried couple shares a home environment. Perceptions\nof health and social relationships, however, were more\nindependent.\nThis study has several limitations. First, the data were a\ncombination of two distinct groups of married Japanese\ncouples--one with a mean age of 32 and the other with a\nmean age of 50, and each with their children at considera-\nbly different ages. Although the diversity of the sample was\nwarranted, the possible differences among the groups may\nlimit the generalizability of our study. Second, our valida-\ntion results should be considered preliminary because their\nverification was based on data distributions and may be\narbitrary. Further studies of the Japanese WHOQOL-BREF\nshould examine participants in various relationship stages,\nincluding couples without children and unmarried adults.\nThe temporal stability should also be tested and the discri-\nminant validity replicated using other outcome measures\nsuch as depression scales, generic health assessments, and\nscreening interviews.\nThis study has practical implications. Although the\nJapanese WHOQOL-BREF has been widely used for the\nelderly and patients, studies among the general population\nare rare. We revealed acceptable psychometric properties\nand usefulness of the WHOQOL-BREF to assess QOL of\nall Japanese adults, especially with families. This is the first\nstudy to support the content validity of the WHOQOL-\nBREF for both husbands and wives, indicating that partner\ndifferences are likely to be true differences in QOL. Our\nresults support using the Japanese WHOQOL-BREF\namong married adults to quantify QOL. This will help\nresearchers study QOL determinants in healthy couples and\nimprove implementation of the instrument.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe QOL and Mental Health across the Life Span Survey, of\nwhich the third author is the principal investigator, was funded by\nthe Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grants-in-Aid,\nReferences\nAnzai Y, Ohkubo T, Nishino Y, et al.
