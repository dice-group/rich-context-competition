Norris*\n*Charles Drew University of Medicine and Science, Los Angeles, California; David Geffen School of Medicine at\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California; and Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute,\nTorrance, California\nSeveral epidemiologic and clinical studies have suggested that there is a strong association between hypovitaminosis D and\ncardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypovitaminosis D was reported as a risk factor for increased cardiovascular events among 1739\nadult participants in the Framingham Offspring Study. Analysis of more than 13,000 adults in the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) showed that even though hypovitaminosis D is associated with an increased\nprevalence of CVD risk factors, its association with all-cause mortality is independent of these risk factors. Importantly,\nepidemiologic studies suggested that patients who had chronic kidney disease and were treated with activated vitamin D had\na survival advantage when compared with those who did not receive treatment with these agents. Mechanistically, emerging\ndata have linked vitamin D administration with improved cardiac function and reduced proteinuria, and hypovitaminosis D\nis associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation. Preliminary studies suggested that activated vitamin\nD inhibits the proliferation of cardiomyoblasts by promoting cell-cycle arrest and enhances the formation of cardiomyotubes\nwithout inducing apoptosis. Activated vitamin D has also been shown to attenuate left ventricular dysfunction in animal\nmodels and humans. In summary, emerging studies suggest that hypovitaminosis D has emerged as an independent risk factor\nfor all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, reinforcing its importance as a public health problem. There is a need to advance\nour understanding of the biologic pathways through which vitamin D affects cardiovascular health and to conduct prospective\nclinical interventions to define precisely the cardioprotective effects of nutritional vitamin D repletion.\nA growing body of evidence suggests that people who\nare deficient in 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] have\nhigher risks for numerous chronic medical conditions\n(1\u00ad3). In this review, we present the emerging data that support\nthis link. Vitamin D is either produced in the skin via the effects\nof ultraviolet light or ingested with food and/or supplements.\nThis vitamin D undergoes hydroxylation in the liver to produce\n25(OH)D. It is widely believed that the renal enzyme 25(OH)D-\n1-hydroxylase is primarily responsible for producing the cir-\nculating levels of the activated form of vitamin D, the hormone\nmitochondrial membrane and is a cytochrome P-450 monoox-\nygenase. Most of the biologic activities of 1,25(OH)D are medi-\nated by its binding to a high-affinity receptor that acts as a\nligand-activated transcription factor. The major steps involved\nin the control of gene transcription by the vitamin D receptor\n(VDR) include ligand binding, heterodimerization with retin-\noid X receptor, binding of the heterodimer to vitamin D re-\nsponse elements, and recruitment of other nuclear proteins into\nthe transcriptional preinitiation complex. 1,25(OH)D may also\nact through non\u00adVDR- or nongenomic VDR-mediated path-\nThere is increasing evidence that the kidney is not unique in\nits ability to convert 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)D, It was recently\ndemonstrated that many tissues not only express the VDR but\nalso possess 25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase activity. The role of this\nparacrine production of 1,25(OH)D in these tissues is not well\nunderstood, but a variety of in vitro studies indicated that this\nprocess may be involved in a wide range of physiologic func-\ntions, including regulation of cytokines, inflammatory and/or\nfibrotic pathways, the renin-angiotensin system, vascular and\ncardiac cell function, immune response modulation, cell growth\nand differentiation, and others (7\u00ad15). Several of the biologic\npathways through which the effects of 1,25(OH)D are mediated\nremain poorly understood but may account for its role in\ncardiovascular health (Figure 1).\nEpidemiology of Hypovitaminosis D and\nCardiovascular Disease in the General\nPopulation\nSeveral epidemiologic and clinical studies have suggested\nthat there is a strong association between hypovitaminosis D\nand cardiovascular disease (CVD). Scragg et al. (16) reported an\ninverse relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and myo-\ncardial infarction in a community setting. This affect may be\nPublished online ahead of print.

Mar-\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) and demonstrated that there is a strong associ-\nation between hypovitaminosis D and key CVD risk factors\n(BP, diabetes, overweight, hypertriglyceridemia, but not hyper-\ncholesterolemia) after adjustment for multiple variables. Fur-\nthermore, several studies have now shown that hypovitamin-\nosis D is a predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality\n(Table 1), independent of the traditional risk factors (19\u00ad21).\nThus, these data have consistently demonstrated that there is a\ngraded, inverse relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels\nand CVD that seems to be most evident as levels fall below 20\nto 25 ng/ml. In addition, Pfeifer et al. (22) reported a fall in BP,\nheart rate, and parathyroid hormone levels after the short-term\nversus 1200 mg/d calcium alone to elderly women (mean age 74\nyr; mean 25(OH)D level 20 ng/ml), suggesting that inade-\nquate intake of 25(OH)D and calcium could play a contributory\nrole in the pathogenesis and progression of hypertension and\nCVD in this cohort.\nEpidemiology of Hypovitaminosis D and\nCVD in Patients with Chronic Kidney\nDisease\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is now recognized as a powerful\ncardiovascular risk factor (23). Agarwal et al. (24) found that the\nadministration of an activated vitamin D analog (paricalcitol) re-\nduced proteinuria in 51% of the 57 patients with CKD in compar-\nison with only 25% of the 61 study participants who received\nplacebo (P  0.004), suggesting a direct vascular effect of vitamin\nD. At least three observational studies of patients with CKD--one\nin non\u00addialysis-dependent and two in dialysis-dependent pa-\ntients--have reported an increased risk for death (both non\u00ad\ndialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent patients) or composite\nFigure 1. Conceptual model of major pathways through which\nvitamin D deficiency may lead to CVD.\nTable 1. Summary of epidemiologic studies that have shown an association between hypovitaminosis D and\nmortality/cardiovascular events in the general population\nReference N Population Follow-up Key Findings\nfor coronary\nangiography\n7.7 yr Lower two quartiles of serum\n25(OH)D with higher all-\ncause and cardiovascular\nmortality\nGiovannucci et al., (56),\nFollow-up Study,\nUp to 10 yr Adjusted hazards for\nmyocardial infarction\ncompared with 25(OH)D\nfor coronary\nangiography\n7.7 yr Low vitamin D levels\nassociated with increased\nfatal/nonfatal strokes\nStudy\nng/ml) associated with\nincreased cardiovascular\nevents\nMelamed et al., (20)\nand Nutrition\nExamination Survey\n8.7 yr Lowest quartile of serum\nwith higher all-cause\nmortality than highest\nquartile\nrisk for death and ESRD (nondialysis patients) in patients with\nlow serum 25(OH)D levels (Table 2).\nEqually as important, observational studies have shown an\nassociation between treatment with activated vitamin D (pre-\nsumably for secondary hyperparathyroidism) and lower all-\ncause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD, both\nin the early stages (25\u00ad27) and in those who receive renal\nreplacement therapy (28\u00ad30). Unfortunately, data on serum\n25(OH)D were not available in any of these studies.\nVitamin D and Cardiac Hypertrophy\nLeft ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is recognized as one of\nthe strongest risk factors for cardiovascular mortality, espe-\ncially in patients with CKD (31). The increased rates of pressure\nand volume overload in patients with CKD can accelerate\ncardiac myocyte apoptosis and fibrosis. At the same time, ac-\ntivation of neurohormonal systems, growth factors, and cyto-\nkines as well as associated downstream intracellular signals can\naffect cardiac hypertrophy, apoptosis, and fibrosis, leading to\nLVH and/or cardiac dysfunction (32\u00ad34); however, the large\nvariability in LV mass in the CKD population suggests that\nother risk factors may also play a role.\nNot only are low levels of 25(OH)D pervasive in patients\nwith CKD (35), but also two small clinical trials of hemodialysis\npatients have shown that treatment with activated vitamin D\n[1,25(OH)D or related analogs] may lead to regression of LVH,\nsuggesting a cardioprotective action (36,37). Indeed, activated\nvitamin D may affect the myocardium directly and play a role\nin the regulation of myocyte hypertrophy, because cardiac hy-\npertrophy has been observed in the hearts of VDR knockout\nmice (38). Activated vitamin D has been shown to downregu-\nlate proliferation and hypertrophy in cultured cardiomyocytes\nvitamin D, paricalcitol, attenuated sodium-induced LV abnor-\nmalities in Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats and when ad-\nministered to dialysis patients improved diastolic function and\nreduced LV thickness when compared with patients who did\nnot receive activated vitamin D. In preliminary studies, we\nfound that in comparison with cardiomyocyte cells cultured in\nthe absence of activated vitamin D, the addition of 1,25(OH)D\n(1) inhibited cell proliferation; (2) enhanced cardiomyocyte for-\nmation; (3) exerted a protective effect against apoptosis; and (4)\npromoted a generalized decreased in the expression of genes\nrelated to the regulation of the cell cycle, such as cyclins A1, C,\nand E and cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk2 and Cdk4 (42). In\nsummary, these findings suggest that it is potentially possible\nthat correcting vitamin D deficiency could contribute to im-\nprove cardiac structure and function, thereby ameliorating car-\ndiovascular risk.\nVitamin D and Vascular Health\nThe ubiquity of the VDR and tissue 25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase\nprovides insights into several pathobiologic pathways through\nwhich hypovitaminosis D may mediate vascular health in ad-\ndition to those outlined already (Figure 2). The VDR knockout\nmouse, an animal model that emulates vitamin D deficiency,\ndisplays increased BP, serum angiotensin, and tissue renin (14).\nIn vitro studies using a juxtaglomerular cell model have shown\nthat 1,25(OH)D as well as other vitamin D analogs directly\nsuppress renin gene expression via a vitamin D response ele-\nment that is present in the renin gene (14). Vitamin D analogs\nhave been shown to inhibit the production of several proin-\nflammatory Th-1 cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-, while\nstimulating the effects of Th-2 lymphocytes, leading to a reduc-\ntion in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and reducing plaque\nproduction and/or instability (43); it also favors the induction\nof T regulatory cells partly through the induction of tolerance-\ninducing dendritic cells. Furthermore, it has been shown to\nhave immunosuppressive effects whereby it reduces the pro-\nliferation of lymphocytes and the production of cytokines,\nwhich have been identified as having an important role in\natherogenesis (43) (Figure 3).\nVDR agonists have also been shown to downregulate plas-\nminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) in human aortic smooth\nmuscle cells but not endothelial cells. This is likely due to the\nlack of VDR expression in the endothelial cells studied (8).\nStudies with mouse embryonic fibroblasts from VDR knockout\nmice showed an increase in profibrotic factors (NF-B tran-\nscriptional activity, IL-6, and TNF-) in comparison with cells\ncultured from wild-type mice (44). Although provocative, the\nTable 2.

To examine more closely the VDR-mediated, parathyroid\nhormone/calcium-independent effects of vitamin D on profi-\nbrotic pathways, we performed a series of experiments on a\nmesenchymal multipotent cell line with potential to differenti-\nate along endothelial lines and to be used for applications such\nas neovascularization and tissue engineering (45). We found\nthat incubating this multipotent cell line with vitamin D led to\nincreased expression and nuclear translocation of the VDR;\ndecreased expression of TGF-1 and plasminogen activator\ninhibitor 1; decreased expression of collagens I and III and\nother collagens isoforms; and increased expression of several\nantifibrotic factors, such as bone morphogenic protein 2 and 7,\n(TGF antagonist), MMP8 (a collagen breakdown inducer), and\nfollistatin (an inhibitor of the profibrotic factor myostatin) (15)\n(Figure 4).\nVitamin D is associated not only with multiple pathways that\nregulate the early stages of atherogenesis, per se, but also with\nvascular calcification. The role of activated vitamin D adminis-\ntration on vascular calcifications has remained a paradox, but\nrecent findings using a mouse model suggested that the admin-\nistration of calcitriol and paricalcitol, at dosages sufficient to\ncorrect secondary hyperparathyroidism, were protective\nagainst aortic calcification, whereas higher dosages stimulated\naortic calcification (46). Protective dosages of 1,25(OH)D sup-\npressed aortic osteoblastic gene expression, which is normally\nincreased in CKD, suggesting a mechanism for this inhibition of\naortic calcification. In addition, evidence suggested that Wnt\nsignaling may modulate vascular calcification via osteoblastic\ndifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells, reinforcing the\nrole of osteoblast regulation in vascular calcification (47,48).\nThe relationship between vitamin D and vascular health is\nreinforced at a clinical level by Melamed et al., who reported an\n80% increase in the adjusted prevalence of peripheral artery\ndisease among NHANES participants with the lowest quartile\nof 25(OH)D (17.8 ng/ml) in comparison with those in the\nhighest quartile (29.2 ng/ml) (49). Similar associations of\nFigure 3. Vitamin D, lymphocyte, and macrophage involvement in atherosclerosis. Recent studies suggest that lymphocytes and\nmacrophages play the initial role in the generation of atheromas. It is hypothesized that Th1 cells start producing excess IFN-,\nwhich is a potent stimulator of macrophage activity. Activated macrophages secrete IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-. These cytokines\nrecruit additional monocytes, increase LDL oxidation, and generate production of MMPs that can destabilize the plaque to cause\nrupture and thrombosis. In contrast, the TH2 lymphocyte subset is called the antiatherogenic phenotype, because these cells\nproduce IL-10, a good cytokine that suppresses macrophage activation and Th1 proliferation.

Nonclassical aspects of differential VDR activation:\nImplications for survival in patients with CKD. Adapted from\nperipheral artery disease and low serum levels of 25(OH)D\nwere reported by Fahrleitner and colleagues (50,51).\nThe aforementioned data suggest that vitamin D has multiple\nimmunomodulatory effects and regulates cytokines, profi-\nbrotic, and proinflammatory pathways and the renin-angioten-\nsin system (9\u00ad14) through the VDR. Some effects, such as\ndownregulation of TGF-1, may occur through vitamin D\u00adme-\ndiated nongenomic pathways (52). The preponderance of data\nlink vitamin D deficiency or lack of activation of the VDR with\nthe modulation of gene transcription and associated signaling\npathways that may contribute to the acceleration of cardiovas-\ncular pathology.\nFuture Directions\nProspective studies are needed to assess the efficacy of\n25(OH)D repletion in patients with CKD/ESRD, in both the\npresence and absence of activated 1,25(OH)D (or analog) reple-\ntion. Studies are needed to evaluate the existence of potential\n\"nongenomic\" or other direct cellular effects of 25(OH)D and\nhow these may be linked to 1,25(OH)D through modulation of\nthe VDR or 25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase expression. Studies are\nneeded to understand better the role of 25(OH)D and local\n25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase on vascular and cardiac function as\nwell as the role of 24,25(OH)D in select organs. Studies are\nneeded to characterize the gene\u00adenvironment interactions that\ninfluence 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)D, as well as to define the\ninterdependence of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)D, and novel vitamin D\nanalogs for vascular health. As we extend our understanding of\n25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)D, and novel vitamin D analogs on the\nrenin-angiotensin system, endothelial function, cardiac and re-\nnal fibrosis, immune regulation, insulin resistance, adipokines,\nand related vascular mediators, we will be better positioned as\na renal community to advance the emerging recognition of\n25(OH)D deficiency as an underestimated public health prob-\nlem and 25(OH)D repletion as an important public health so-\nlution.\nConclusions\nVitamin D seems to play an important role in cardiovascular\nhealth. Emerging studies suggest that vitamin D has important\nindirect effects via traditional and possibly nontraditional CVD\nrisk factors as well as direct effects on cardiac and vascular\ncells. This confluence of emerging reports on the ubiquitous\nrole of vitamin D in cardiovascular health and the graded\nrelationship between vitamin D levels and clinical outcomes\nsupports the need to reassess the current position on which\nlevels of vitamin D constitute vitamin D insufficiency and\nnecessitate vitamin D repletion. The current recommended lev-\nmentation guidelines (see next paragraph) are primarily based\non predicted needs to maintain optimum bone health and to\nprevent rickets but do not address the vitamin D requirements\nthat may be necessary to minimize the initiation and/or pro-\ngression of CVD and CVD risk factors.\nGiven our evolving understanding of vitamin D and cardio-\nvascular health, more effective strategies are needed to address\nFigure 4.
