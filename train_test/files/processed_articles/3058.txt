However, results from sev-\neral small studies in humans have yielded inconclusive evidence of a beneficial effect\nof ascorbic acid on lead toxicity.\nObjective To examine the relationship between serum ascorbic acid levels and preva-\nlence of elevated blood lead levels.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional analysis of a probability sample\nof the US population enrolled in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nwithout a history of lead poisoning.\nMain Outcome Measures Elevated and log blood lead levels by serum ascorbic\nacid level.\nResults A total of 22 youths (0.5%) and 57 adults (0.4%) had elevated blood lead\ntively). After controlling for the effects of age, race, sex, income level, and dietary en-\nergy, fat, calcium, iron, and zinc intake, youths in the highest serum ascorbic acid ter-\ntile had an 89% decreased prevalence of elevated blood lead levels compared with\nyouths in the lowest serum ascorbic acid tertile (odds ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence in-\ntiles had a 65% to 68% decreased prevalence of elevated blood lead levels compared\nwith adults in the lowest serum ascorbic acid tertile (P for trend = .03). As a continu-\nous predictor, serum ascorbic acid level was independently associated with decreased\nlog blood lead levels among adults (P.001), but not among youths (P = .14).\nConclusions Our data suggest that high serum levels of ascorbic acid are indepen-\ndently associated with a decreased prevalence of elevated blood lead levels. If these\nassociations are related causally, ascorbic acid intake may have public health implica-\ntions for control of lead toxicity.\nand Patient Page.\ndid not analyze data from children aged\n1 to 5 years because serum ascorbic acid\nlevels were not measured in these par-\nticipants. We excluded 28 youths (de-\nfined as participants between the ages\nof 6 and 16 years) who reported a his-\ntory of lead poisoning and hence were\nlikelytohavereceivedtreatmenttolower\ntheir blood lead levels; we excluded an\nadditional 36 adult and youth partici-\npants with serum ascorbic acid concen-\ntrations of questionable validity (ie,\nsions, complete data were available from\n6 and 90 years for our analyses.\nMeasurements\nNHANES III questionnaire data in-\ncluded self-reported age, race, sex,\nhousehold income, history of smok-\ning, and intake of dietary energy, fat,\ncalcium, iron, zinc, and ascorbic acid.12\nQuantitative nutrition data were col-\nlected using a 24-hour dietary recall.\nThe questionnaires, dietary methods,\nand examination procedures used in\nNHANES III have been described else-\nwhere.12 Questions addressing history\nof cigarette smoking were not avail-\nable for the youths.\nBloodleadlevelsweremeasuredatthe\nCDC by atomic absorption spectrom-\n\u00b5mol/L (20 \u00b5g/dL) or higher in adults\nwere considered to be elevated based on\nthe NHANES III cut points for the re-\nporting of abnormal laboratory val-\nues.12 Serum ascorbic acid levels were\nmeasured at the CDC by high-perfor-\nmance liquid chromatography15 and\nStatistical Methods\nWe examined the distribution of ascor-\nbic acid levels and other variables of in-\nterest using sample weights.

A logarithmic transforma-\ntion was performed to improve the sym-\nmetry of the distribution of blood lead\nlevels.

In multivariate\nmodels, each 10-mg increment in di-\netary ascorbic acid intake among youths\nwas associated with a nonsignificant 1%\ndecrease in prevalence of elevated blood\nlead level (P = .88). However, in multi-\nvariatemodelsthatsubstitutedserumfer-\nritin level for dietary iron, we detected\na trend toward lower prevalence of el-\nevated blood lead levels among adults;\neach 10-mg increment in dietary ascor-\nbicacidintakewasassociatedwitha3.5%\ndecrease in the prevalence of elevated\nblood lead level (P = .10).\nCOMMENT\nOur principal finding was that serum\nascorbic acid level was inversely re-\nlated to blood lead level among adults\nand youths enrolled in NHANES III. We\nobserved no significant relationship,\nhowever, between dietary ascorbic acid\nintake and blood lead levels, suggest-\ning either that dietary estimates de-\nrived from NHANES III were too im-\nprecise to permit the detection of the\nassociation or that elevated blood lead\nlevels may increase the turnover of\nascorbic acid, thereby lowering serum\nascorbic acid levels. Although we can-\nnot exclude the latter possibility, there\nis prior evidence consistent with the hy-\npothesis that ascorbic acid may lower\nblood lead levels.\nSeveral animal studies have exam-\nined the effect of ascorbic acid on lead\ntoxicity. In rats fed a lead-containing\ndiet, combined dietary supplementa-\ntion with iron and ascorbic acid low-\nered detectable lead levels in liver, kid-\nney, and bone and prevented growth\ndepression and anemia.21 These benefi-\ncial effects, however, were transient.22\nComparing the chelating effects of oral\nascorbic acid and parenterally adminis-\nteredEDTAinlead-poisonedrats,Goyer\nand Cherian4 reported that ascorbic acid\nand EDTA had equivalent chelating\nproperties. Studies in humans have\nyielded inconclusive results. Two case\nseries reported significant clinical im-\nprovement among 337 workers with oc-\ncupational lead exposure after daily ad-\nministration of 100 mg of ascorbic\nacid.5,6 In an uncontrolled trial, the com-\nbined administration of zinc and ascor-\nbic acid was reported to reduce blood\npatients,7 and in a small clinical trial,\nascorbic acid resulted in marked reduc-\nanother study of 85 subjects who vol-\nunteered to consume a lead-containing\ndrink, ascorbic acid supplementation\nproduced small reductions in lead re-\ntention.8 Two other small clinical tri-\nals, however, concluded that ascorbic\nacid supplementation did not lower\nblood lead levels.9,10 In 1 of these stud-\nies, 52 subjects were assigned to re-\nceive either ascorbic acid supplementa-\ntion or placebo.9 Although reported to\nTable 2.

Compared with\nsubjects in the placebo group, subjects\ntreated with ascorbic acid were more\nlikely to have a decrease of at least 0.24\n\u00b5mol/L (5 \u00b5g/dL) in blood lead level\nond study, 45 men received 3 months\nof ascorbic acid treatment, resulting in\nblood lead levels compared with the pla-\ncebo-treated group.10 It is possible that\nthese 2 studies might have yielded sta-\ntistically significant results had larger\nnumbers of participants been enrolled.\nOur study has a number of strengths\nand limitations. Because NHANES III\nsurveyed a large probability sample of\nAmericans, our findings should be gen-\neralizabletotheUSpopulation.Further-\nmore, the measurement of serum ascor-\nbic acid levels in a large sample of the\npopulationallowsamorereliableassess-\nment of ascorbic acid status as a corre-\nlate of blood lead levels than do studies\nthat use dietary intake estimations only.\nPlasma ascorbic acid levels are strongly\ncorrelated with leukocyte ascorbic acid\nlevels(r=0.92),anindicatoroftissuelev-\nels,23,24 and reflect at least the previous\nseveral months of dietary intake, even\nduring periods of seasonal variation.25\nThe correlation between dietary esti-\nmates and measured blood levels of\nascorbic acid, however, is modest\nplausible that ascorbic acid may affect\nlead absorption and excretion, it is pos-\nsible that blood lead may lower serum\nascorbicacidlevels.Itisalsopossiblethat\nhigher ascorbic acid levels may repre-\nsent healthier lifestyles or greater socio-\neconomic status. Hence, we cannot be\ncertain that differences in serum ascor-\nbic acid levels preceded elevated blood\nleadlevels,andinferencesregardingcau-\nsality should be made cautiously.\nIn conclusion, serum ascorbic acid\nlevel is an important independent cor-\nrelate of blood lead level among Ameri-\ncans. To our knowledge, this report is\nthe first population-based study to es-\ntablish such an association. If a causal\nrelationship is confirmed, higher in-\ntakes of ascorbic acid may have public\nhealth implications for the prevention\nof lead toxicity.\nFunding/Support: This study was supported by Hoff-\nmann-La Roche Inc and US Public Health Service grant\n"
