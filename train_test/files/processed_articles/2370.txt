For serious victimizations,\nsuch as sexual abuse by an adult, kidnapping, and gang\nassaults, authorities knew about 70.1% or more of the\nincidents.

However, police were the\nmost likely to know about kidnapping, neglect, and sexual\nabuse by any adult.

It is not clear that such\ndata reflect current experience after a generation of mo-\nbilization and increased awareness about childhood vic-\ntimization in its many forms. The present study at-\ntempts to remedy this problem by looking at the degree\nto which authorities know about victimization in a con-\ntemporary cohort of children and adolescents.\nMETHODS\nThe National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence, de-\nsigned to obtain 1-year and lifetime prevalence estimates of a\nwide range of childhood/adolescent victimizations, was con-\nexperiences of a nationally representative sample of 4549 chil-\ndren and adolescents aged 0 to 17 years living in the contigu-\nous United States. The interviews with parents, children, and\nadolescents were conducted over the telephone by the employ-\nees of an experienced survey research firm.\nSample households were drawn from a nationwide sam-\npling frame of residential telephone numbers through random-\ndigit dialing. This nationally representative cross-section yielded\nincluded an adequate number of racial/ethnic minority and low-\nincome respondents for more accurate subgroup analyses, there\nwas also an oversampling of telephone exchanges that had high\nconcentrations of African American or Hispanic households or\nthose with low socioeconomic status. This second oversample\nyielded 1496 of the completed interviews. Sample weights were\ngenerated to correct for disproportionate sampling proce-\ndures when combining the 2 samples. Additional information\non sampling methods and procedures is available elsewhere.6\nPROCEDURE\nA short interview was conducted with an adult caregiver in\neach household to obtain family demographic information.\nOne child or adolescent was randomly selected from all eli-\ngible living in a household by selecting the boy or girl with the\nmost recent birthday. If the selected individual was aged 10 to\n17 years, the main telephone interview was conducted with\nhim or her. If the selected individual was younger than 10\nyears, the interview was conducted with the caregiver who \"is\nmost familiar with the child's/adolescent's daily routine and\nexperiences.\"\nRespondents were promised complete confidentiality and\nwere paid $20 each for their participation. The interviews, each\naveraging 45 minutes in length, were conducted in English and\nSpanish. Respondents who disclosed a situation involving se-\nrious threat or ongoing victimization were recontacted by a clini-\ncal member of the research team trained in telephone crisis coun-\nseling, whose responsibility was to stay in contact with the\nrespondent until the situation was resolved or brought to the\nattention of appropriate authorities. All procedures were au-\nthorized by the institutional review board of the University of\nNew Hampshire.\nVictimization\nThis survey used an enhanced version of the Juvenile Victim-\nization Questionnaire (JVQ), an inventory of childhood vic-\ntimization.7-9 The JVQ obtains reports on 48 forms of youth vic-\ntimization covering 5 general areas of interest: conventional\ncrime, maltreatment, victimization by peers and siblings, sexual\nvictimization, and witnessing and indirect exposure to vio-\nlence.10 Examples of individual items include robbery, assault\nwith a weapon, peer or sibling assault, neglect by a caregiver,\nbullying, sexual assault (subdivided by perpetrator identity),\nsexual harassment, living in an area with shooting or other vio-\nlence, and witnessing family violence, among others. Specific\nwording for all the JVQ victimization screeners is available\nelsewhere.6\nFollow-up questions for each victimization item gathered\nadditional information about each event, including whether it\noccurred in the past year, perpetrator characteristics, weapon\nuse, injury, and whether the event was known to school or po-\nlice authorities, among other characteristics. If injury re-\nsulted, respondents were asked whether medical help was sought\n(\" . . . go to the hospital, a doctor's office, or some kind of health\nclinic to get treated for this injury?\"). Not all screeners in-\ncluded the same follow-up questions.\nThis analysis examined victimizations that had occurred in\nthepastyear.Specifictypeswereidentifiedandcountedin2ways.\nFirst, each screener was treated as an individual type of victim-\nization based on its described characteristics. Victimizations were\nflagged as known or not known to school, police, and/or medi-\ncal authorities based on relevant follow-up questions.\nSecond, 2 aggregate types of victimization were identified.\nIn particular, assault with a weapon, assault with no weapon,\nattempted assault, threatened assault, kidnapping, bias-\nmotivated attack, physical abuse, gang or group assault, peer\nor sibling assault, nonsexual genital assault, and dating vio-\nlence were each identified as a version of physical assault. Simi-\nlarly, sexual assault by a known adult, sexual assault by a non-\nspecified adult, sexual assault by a peer, completed or attempted\nrape, sexual exposure/being flashed, and sexual harassment are\nexamples of sexual victimizations.\nVictimization Characteristics\nSpecific instances of physical assault and sexual victimization\nwere further distinguished from one another using follow-up\nquestions and screener descriptions. Thus, physical assaults and\nsexual victimizations were characterized as (1) causing no in-\njury, minor injury, or major injury; (2) having an adult or a\njuvenile perpetrator; (3) having a male or female perpetrator;\n(4) having a family, known or acquaintance, stranger, or un-\nidentified perpetrator; or (5) occurring at home, in a school or\nday care setting, or elsewhere. They were also characterized by\nhow afraid and how badly the victim felt as a result of the event\n(not at all, a little, or very).\nFurthermore, physical assault incidents were differenti-\nated by whether the event involved a weapon, bias motiva-\ntion, attempted assault only, or a threat only. Sexual victim-\nizations were distinguished by whether no sexual penetration,\nonly attempted penetration, or completed penetration occurred.\nDemographics\nChild and household information was obtained in the initial\nparent interview. Measurements included in the analysis were\nthe child's sex, age (5 groups), race/ethnicity (4 groups [white\n\u00a92011 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nnon-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, other non-Hispanic, and any\nHispanic]), and socioeconomic status based on income and pa-\nrental educational level. Family structure was categorized into\n4 groups: children living with (1) a pair of biological or adop-\ntive parents, (2) a single biological parent plus partner (spouse\nor nonspouse), (3) a single biological parent, and (4) other care-\npopulation, or (4) rural.\nStudy goals were to estimate the relative number of juvenile\nvictimizations that become known to authorities and to iden-\ntify factors that appear to influence the likelihood of victim-\nizations becoming known (with counts and statistical analy-\nses based on weighted data). First, the number of children within\nthe sample who had been victimized and whose individual vic-\ntimizations were known to school, police, or medical authori-\nties was counted. Follow-up questions that asked, \"Do any of\nthese people know about what happened? A teacher, coun-\nselor, or other adult at school or day care (Y/N); A police offi-\ncer or some other law official (Y/N),\" were used for this count.\nHaving one's victimizations known or unknown to medical au-\nthorities was based on the follow-up question concerning seek-\ning medical attention for an injury, described previously. Only\nscreeners that involved physical violence included this fol-\nlow-up item, somewhat limiting information about the aware-\nness of medical authorities.\nTo look more closely at differences in victimizations and\ncharacteristics that might affect whether they are known or not\nknown to authorities, we examined the physical assault and\nsexual aggregated victimizations. For this analysis, victimiza-\ntions were treated and counted as incidents, that is, as a single\nevent occurring at a single time and place regardless of the num-\nber of screeners that referred to the event. For example, a child\nmight be robbed and at the same time be physically assaulted\nand/or threatened. This single event could be described by sev-\neral screeners (eg, robbery, assault with a weapon or with no\nweapon, and having been threatened). Each screener in the JVQ\nincludes follow-up questions that allow those events that are\npart of the same incident and those that are independent events\nto be identified.\nThese follow-ups were used to identify all incidents that in-\ncluded any physical assault or any sexual victimization, as pre-\nviously identified. The separate physical assaults and sexual vic-\ntimizations were then described in terms of the victimization\ncharacteristics (eg, injury, perpetrators, and place of occur-\nrence) and linked to the demographic and household attributes\nof the child or adolescent who had experienced the incident(s).\nDirect logistic regression was used to identify the victim-\nization characteristics, child/adolescent characteristics, or house-\nhold characteristics that were associated with incidents being\nknown to authorities. Four models were constructed that pre-\ndicted (1) physical assault incidents known to school authori-\nties, (2) physical assault incidents known to police authori-\nties, and (3 and 4) sexual victimization incidents known to\nschool and police authorities, respectively. Incidents known to\nmedical authorities were not analyzed because of the limited\nnumber of screeners reporting that information. Because a child\nor adolescent might have more than 1 victimization incident\nof each type, a dummy variable flagged those victimizations for\nwhich individuals had experienced multiple incidents. In ad-\ndition, the models included a measure of each individual's total\nvictimization experience--for physical assault models, the num-\nber of nonphysical assaults experienced in the past year, and\nfor sexual victimization models, the number of nonsexual\nvictimizations.\nRESULTS\nA considerable portion of children who had experienced\nvictimization had those incidents known by some author-\nity (school, police, or medical). A total of 58.3% of the\nsample reported at least 1 direct victimization in the past\nyear (this included bullying but excluded events such as\nwitnessing domestic assault). Of these victims, 45.7% had\nat least 1 victimization that was known to authorities.\nThe degree to which victimizations were known to au-\nthorities varied according to victimization screener\n(Table 1).Thevictimizationsmostlikelytobeknownwere\ntypically of a more serious nature, such as sexual abuse by\nand theft (46.8%) were often known to authorities. The\ntypes of episodes least likely to be known were peer and\nsibling assault (16.9%), dating violence (15.2%), sexual ex-\nposure/being flashed (16.6%), completed and attempted\nThere was also considerable variation in the degree to\nwhichindirectvictimizationwasknowntoauthorities.Ob-\nviously, murders to which children were exposed and pub-\nlic offenses against schools were widely known. Also, wit-\nnessing of domestic violence by children was known in\napproximately half the episodes (48.9%).\nSchool authorities tended to know about victimiza-\ncal authorities (1.8%). However, police were more likely\nthan school authorities to know about incidents for sev-\neral types of victimization, including kidnapping (71.1%\nvs 28.5%, respectively), and witnessing of domestic vio-\nAs noted, our information regarding events known to\nmedical authorities was limited. Although few episodes\ninvolved medical authorities, the most common were\nsexual abuse by a known or nonspecified adult (7.4% and\n19.1%, respectively), gang assault (8.7%), physical abuse\nThere was some variation by age in the degree to which\nauthorities knew about victimizations. For direct vic-\ntimizations, children and adolescents aged 6 years and\nolder were more likely to have their incidents known by\nschool authorities, but there was little difference be-\nyear-olds for this factor. For police and medical authori-\nties, the victimizations of 14- to 17-year-olds were most\nlikely to be known.\nAs noted, 4 logistic regressions were used to identify\nthe features of children and adolescents and incidents\nthat were associated with being known to authorities.\nWe looked at physical assault and sexual victimization\nincidents separately, as well as incidents known to\nschool or police, expecting the dynamics to differ for\nthe kinds of victimizations and authorities (Table 2\nand Table 3).\nSchool authorities were more likely to know about a\nphysical assault when it occurred in school, involved a\n\u00a92011 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nserious injury, involved a stranger or an adult perpetra-\ntor, had a bias motivation, or made the individual who\nexperienced it report feeling afraid or bad (Table 2).\nAttempts and threats were also more likely to be known\nthan actual assaults. Several child/adolescent character-\nistics were also related to school authorities knowing\nabout physical assault victimizations: female sex,\nyounger than 13 years, having experienced other\nassaults in the past year, and being from a family with\nlow socioeconomic status. By comparison, assaults\nexperienced by Hispanic individuals were less likely to\nbe known.\nSexual offenses were more likely to be known to school\nauthorities when they occurred in school, involved a non-\nidentified perpetrator, occurred to a 2- to 5-year-old or\na 6- to 9-year-old, and involved a child living with a step-\nparent or unmarried partner of a parent (Table 3).\nPolice were more likely to know about physical\nassaults when the offense occurred somewhere other\nthan home or school or involved a serious injury, a\nnonfamily or adult perpetrator, or bias motivation or\nwhen the child reported being very afraid (Table 2).\nAlso associated with greater police likelihood of know-\ning were when affected individuals were girls, from\nfamilies with lower socioeconomic status, and living in\na rural area. The only features associated with sexual\nincidents being known to police were the child feeling\nafraid and an adult perpetrator (marginal) (Table 3).\nTable 1.

However, having 1\nvictimization known gives officials, with proper train-\ning, an opportunity to inquire about other victimiza-\ntions. Moreover, the analysis also suggests that chil-\ndren and adolescents with multiple victimizations were\namong those most likely to have some events known by\nauthorities.\nMany of the most serious victimizations, such as sexual\nabuse by adults, kidnapping, and gang assault, were likely\nto be known to authorities, whereas others, such as at-\ntempted and completed rape and dating assault, were un-\nlikely to be known. The contrasting pattern for different\nkinds of sexual crime may have to do with differences in\nperpetrator characteristics; for example, attempted and\ncompleted rape and dating assault often involve peer per-\npetrators. Incidents with adult perpetrators are more likely\nto be known, perhaps because the adult offenses are seen\nas more criminal or because peer allegiances may in-\nhibit reporting of younger perpetrators.\nThe idea that disclosure to authorities has increased\nover time is suggested by comparison of the current\nstudy findings with another national survey2 of victim-\n1992 telephone survey with caretakers and children and\nizations were known to police or school authorities (vs\n50.6% in the present study for that age group), only\n29% of the kidnapping incidents (vs 73.3% in present\nstudy), and only 6% of the sexual assault or sexual\nabuse incidents (vs 11.2% in the present study). This is\ngood news and may reflect efforts by authorities and\nadvocates to promote disclosure. Because early disclo-\nsure is believed to facilitate prevention, increased dis-\nclosure rates are consistent with the findings that child-\nhood victimization rates have decreased considerably\nConsistent with 2 other studies,2,15 our findings indi-\ncate that school authorities are more likely to find out\nabout victimizations experienced by children and ado-\nlescents than other authorities, which is understand-\nable given how much time children and adolescents spend\nin school and interact with school professionals. Al-\nthough police and medical authorities may conclude from\nthese results that they are seriously underinformed about\nvictimization, it is not clear how much victimization of\nchildren and adolescents merits the specialized involve-\nment of those professionals.\nThe analysis also provides some clues about where to\nreinforce efforts to promote disclosure, one of the main\navenues for authorities knowing about victimizations.\nBoys are less likely to have their victimizations known\nto authorities, probably reflecting the \"boy code\" of self-\nsufficiency that stigmatizes help seeking, a code that some\neducational programs are now trying to counteract.16 His-\npanic children and adolescents are less likely to have their\nvictimizations known, perhaps reflecting Hispanic con-\ncerns about how authorities will treat them. Children from\nfamilies with higher socioeconomic status are also less\nlikely to have their victimizations known, which per-\nhaps reflects suspicion among those families about the\nnegative effect of disclosure on children and adoles-\ncents, combined with having the resources and status to\ndeflect the involvement of authorities. Efforts to empha-\nsize the helpful rather than stigmatizing features of pro-\nfessional intervention might be useful to counteract some\nof the concerns in these groups.\nThe study also shows that authorities are less likely\nto know about victimizations involving family and peer\nperpetrators in contrast to nonfamily and adult perpe-\ntrators. Educators have long recognized the need to\npromote disclosures about such family and peer inci-\ndents. An important task is for authorities to persuade\nchildren and families that they have resources to help in\nthese situations and that they can provide protection\nagainst retaliation for individuals who disclose their\nvictimizations.\nAlthough this study has many virtues, including its\nnationally representative sample and comprehensive spec-\ntrum of questions, it is important to be aware of some\nlimitations. The kinds of victimizations not known to au-\nthorities might also be those that children, adolescents,\nand caregivers would not disclose to the survey. Thus,\nthe survey may overstate the proportion of victimiza-\ntions that become known to authorities. However, this\nlimitation applies to all surveys and was certainly as true\nin earlier surveys as in this one. Therefore, the higher rates\nof disclosure found in this study relative to earlier sur-\nveys likely reflect real increases. Some might argue that\nwhen children and adolescents become adults, they are\nmore willing to disclose, favoring adult retrospective in-\nterviews as the best method for identifying unreported\nabuse. However, adult retrospective interviews suffer from\nthe fact that adults likely do not remember all the vic-\ntimizations experienced during childhood and adoles-\ncence, particularly those that happened at a younger age\nand especially those that might have been less serious.\nIn general, victimology studies17 suggest that contempo-\nraneous research is more complete and accurate.\nThe current study suggests progress and challenge in\nthe effort to identify children and adolescents who have\nexperienced abuse and victimization. The higher rates\nof victimizations known to authorities found in the cur-\nrent study may mean that past efforts to promote dis-\nclosure have been working and should be sustained.\nHowever, the study also shows that a considerable por-\ntion of childhood/adolescent exposure to victimization\nis still unknown to authorities. The study suggests that\noutreach needs to be particularly enhanced toward\nboys, Hispanics, and higher-income groups. It also sug-\n\u00a92011 American Medical Association.

For-\ntunately, more such interventions are being developed,\ntested, and deemed effective, including conflict resolu-\ntion programs,18 parenting education programs,19 and cog-\nnitive behavioral treatments for victimization trauma.12,20-22\nSo, in addition to more education and awareness to en-\ncourage disclosure, communities should also ensure that\nthey have professionals trained in such evidence-based\nprograms to provide care to children, adolescents, and\nfamilies once victimization has been disclosed.\nCorrespondence: David Finkelhor, PhD, Crimes Against\nChildren Research Center, University of New Hamp-\nshire, 126 Horton Social Science Center, 20 Academic\nAuthor Contributions: All authors had full access to all\nthe data in the study and take responsibility for the in-\ntegrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\nStudy concept and design: Finkelhor, Ormrod, Turner, and\nHamby.
