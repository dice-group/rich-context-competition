This study explored whether improvements in cognitive functioning occurred during the 1990s among\nolder Americans and investigated several possible explanations for such changes.\ntirement Survey (N  7,624), this study examined aggregate changes in the proportion of the noninstitutionalized popu-\nlation aged 70 and older with severe cognitive impairment. Impairment was measured for self-respondents using a\nmodified version of the Telephone Interview Cognitive Screen; for proxy respondents, ratings of memory and judgment\nwere used. Logistic regression was used to investigate potential explanations for aggregate changes.\nResults. The percentage of older Americans with severe cognitive impairment declined from 6.1% in 1993 to 3.6%\nin 1998 (p  .001). The decline was statistically significant among self-respondents but not among those with proxy in-\nterviews. Improvements between 1993 and 1998 were not explained by shifts in demographic and socioeconomic fac-\ntors or by changes in the prevalence of stroke, vision, or hearing impairments.\nDiscussion. As a group, older persons, especially those well into their 80s, appear to have better cognitive function-\ning today than they did in the early 1990s.\nLTHOUGH results are not completely uniform, and\nthere is no assurance that the trend will continue, there\nis a growing consensus that during the 1980s and early\n1990s physical functioning among older Americans im-\nproved (Crimmins, Saito, & Reynolds, 1997; Freedman &\nWaidmann & Liu, 2000). Thus far studies have focused on a\nspectrum of physical outcomes, including functional limita-\ntions, activities of daily living (ADLs), and instrumental ac-\ntivities of daily living (IADLs).\nComparisons within and across studies suggest that im-\nprovements in IADLs may have been larger than those for\nnoted that IADLs, such as managing money, taking medica-\ntions, and using the telephone, have a particularly strong\nrelationship with cognition (Barberger-Gateau et al., 1992;\nFitzgerald, Smith, Martin, Freedman, & Wolinsky, 1993;\nKasper, 1990), suggesting that cognitive functioning may\nalso have improved among older Americans in recent de-\ncades. Consistent with this hypothesis is the work by Man-\nclines in the prevalence of dementia and in the debilitating\neffects of this condition among older Americans between\nA handful of studies in the cognitive psychology litera-\nture have shown improvements over historic time in a vari-\nfor example, documented massive IQ gains for adults in 14\nindustrialized nations. Such studies have often focused on\nselect samples (e.g., soldiers, school-aged children, young\nadults) that exclude older adults. A notable exception is\nSchaie (1983), who found improvements among adults aged\nin a longitudinal study of enrollees in a health maintenance\norganization in Seattle. In his age-specific presentation of\nSchaie's results, Salthouse (1991) showed large improve-\nments for 67-year-olds in two of five primary mental abili-\nties, verbal and reasoning skills, over this 32-year period.\nPrimarily because of data limitations, to date no study has\nattempted to analyze national trends in cognitive function-\ning among older Americans. Such trends are of interest for\nseveral reasons. First, because cognitive deficits have a\nstrong relationship with physical disability (Carlson et al.,\nof cognitive trends may provide important insights into the\nexisting literature on national disability trends. Second, se-\nvere cognitive impairment has been linked to differential\npatterns of medical and long-term care service use, with\nolder impaired persons delaying care and substituting more\nexpensive hospital care for physician visits (Binder & Rob-\nreceiving more home health visits with, on average, longer\ning greater numbers of long-term caregivers (Kasper, 1990);\nand entering nursing homes at higher rates (Coughlin & Liu,\n1989). Thus, an investigation of recent shifts in cognitive\nfunctioning can provide important insights for predicting\nthe future demand for medical and long-term care and costs\nassociated with such care. Third, those with severe cogni-\ntive impairment living in the community are some of the\nmost vulnerable members of society, at high risk for eco-\nA\nnomic exploitation as well as physical neglect (Larson et al.,\n1992), so tracking the size of this group and changes in who\nmay be at risk for such abuses is of value in and of itself.\nOur purpose in this study was to investigate national-\nlevel changes in the prevalence of severe cognitive impair-\nment among older Americans. Drawing upon the first wave\nof the Asset and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old study\n(AHEAD93) and the fourth wave of the Health and Retire-\nment Survey (HRS98), we examined aggregate changes\ntionalized population aged 70 and older with severe cognitive\nimpairment. We also explored whether such aggregate\nchanges can be attributed to recent shifts in the demo-\ngraphic and socioeconomic composition of the older popu-\nlation and to changes in selected health-related factors.\nDefining and Measuring Cognitive Impairment\nCognitive impairment has been described as \"a dimin-\nished capacity to know the world\" (Folstein, Anthony,\nnitive functioning across the life span often invoke a two-\nprocess categorization, contrasting fluid-like cognitive me-\nchanics (e.g., processing speed, reasoning, memory) with\ncrystallized pragmatics (e.g., knowledge, fluency; Baltes,\n1993). Such distinctions are often blurred in the practice of\nmeasuring cognition, because many cognitive tasks employ\nboth sets of skills (Baltes & Baltes, 1990). Recalling vocab-\nulary, for example, requires pragmatic knowledge of a word\nas well as mechanical retrieval from memory.\nAn alternative way of conceptualizing cognitive impair-\nment is found in the discussion of dementia in the most re-\ncent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n(DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Al-\nthough sometimes used interchangeably in the social-geron-\ntological literature, cognitive impairment and dementia are\nnot synonymous. Cognitive impairment is most often a\nmanifestation of dementia or delirium, although a substan-\ntial proportion of cases with severe cognitive impairment do\nnot present with a mental disorder (Folstein et al., 1985). In\ncontrast, dementia refers to a class of diagnoses based on\nclinical criteria including, but not limited to, cognitive dete-\nrioration.\nIrrespective of these distinctions, deterioration of cogni-\ntive functioning, particularly of memory systems, is a hallmark\nof dementia and is therefore given considerable attention in\nthe DSM-IV. The manual distinguishes five dimensions of\ncognitive impairment: memory impairment (both short and\nlong term), aphasia (deterioration of language function),\napraxia (impaired ability to execute motor activities), agno-\nsia (inability to recognize objects), and disturbances in ex-\necutive functioning (inability to think abstractly and process\ninformation). Poor spatial orientation and poor judgment are\nalso identified as commonly accompanying declines in these\nareas because of dementia.\nResearchers have developed numerous scales to capture\nthese aspects of cognitive impairment in clinical settings\n(for a review, see Teresi & Evans, 1996). Perhaps the most\nwidely used of these is Folstein's (Folstein, Folstein, &\nMcHugh, 1975) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),\nwhich taps each of the five dimensions of cognitive func-\ntioning in the DSM-IV and spatial orientation. Generally\nsuch measures, and the MMSE in particular, are more valid\nand reliable in identifying the severely cognitively im-\npaired; others have reported considerable measurement er-\nror when such measures are used to identify the moderately\nmates of severe cognitive impairment based on such scales\namong the older community-dwelling population have con-\nAlthough many of these instruments require face-to-face\ncontact with the patient, researchers have developed several\ninstruments with the express purpose of screening for cog-\nnitive impairment on the telephone. The Telephone Inter-\nview Cognitive Screen (TICS), for example, which is based\non Folstein's MMSE, measures short- and long-term mem-\nory, aphasia, apraxia, and disturbances in executive func-\ntioning, with the scale heavily weighted toward memory im-\npairment. The original TICS consisted of 11 items with a\nThe scale has high reliability and excellent predictive valid-\nity in terms of identifying persons with clinically diagnosed\ndementia (Brandt et al., 1988). Most often a cutoff of 30 or\nless is used as an indicator of cognitive impairment. The in-\nstrument has been modified and adapted in several popula-\ntion-based surveys, including the AHEAD93 and the\nHRS98; their version (described in the Methods section)\nemphasizes memory impairment and disturbance in execu-\ntive function.\nTo avoid omitting some of the most cognitively impaired,\ncommunity-based studies of cognitive functioning often al-\nlow informants (or proxies, in survey terminology) to report\nabout the cognitive functioning of sampled persons (Herzog &\na separate set of indicators to elicit the cognitive status of\nolder individuals from such informants. Jorm (Jorm, 1994,\nformant-based scale for measuring cognitive decline in el-\nderly persons, which measures changes in short- and long-\nterm memory, aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, deterioration in\nexecutive functioning, and judgment. The scale correlates\nwell with the MMSE in identifying the severely impaired\npopulation (Jorm, Scott, Cullen, & MacKinnon, 1991).\nOther studies, including the AHEAD93 and HRS98, have\ndeveloped questions asking proxies to rate the cognitive\nperformance (e.g., memory, judgment) of another person.\nThese types of brief, informant-based measures have good\npredictive validity of clinical diagnoses of dementia and the\nInfluences on Cognitive Functioning\nDemographic and socioeconomic factors.--Age is the\nfactor most commonly associated with a decline in cogni-\ntive functioning, although there is considerable variation in\nthe age\u00adcognition relation depending on the aspect of cog-\nnition being considered (Salthouse, 1991) and whether the\nanalysis is of cross-sectional levels or longitudinal change\n(Hultsch, Hertzog, Small, McDonald, & Dixon, 1992). Stud-\nies showing that age effects are shared across a wide range\nof cognitive domains have been interpreted as evidence of\nbroad age-related changes at the neurophysiological level\nStarr, Deary, Inch, Cross, & MacLennan, 1997) have argued\nthat much of decline in old age actually reflects the associa-\ntion of age and disease.\nLow educational attainment is another factor frequently\nassociated with cognitive decline or poor performance on\ncognitive tests in old age, although the basis for the relation-\nIt could be that formal education results in cognitive prac-\ntice that may affect later ability. Other elements of early and\nmidlife experience, such as childhood socioeconomic status\n(which might influence opportunities beyond education),\neducation of parents (which might reflect genetic endow-\nment or childrearing practices), and adult occupation (which\nmight reflect continued cognitive practice as well as envi-\nronmental factors) may be related to both education and late-\nlife cognitive functioning. However, it could be that these\nsocioeconomic factors may simply serve as proxy measures\nof early health experiences and care. Moreover, in the case\nof educational attainment, the causation could run in the op-\nposite direction, with early cognitive deficits relating to less\nschooling, which is then associated with poorer cognition\nAnother relationship frequently noted in the literature on\ncognition is with race and ethnicity. In the United States,\nolder Blacks and Hispanics typically do worse on cognitive\ntests than do non-Hispanic Whites (Albert et al., 1995; Her-\nhypotheses have been put forth to explain such cultural dif-\nferences (Stern & Carstensen, 2000). The association may\nreflect, for example, socioeconomic differences and differ-\nential susceptibility to diseases that affect cognitive func-\ntioning. In younger populations, the power of stereotypes has\nbeen shown to influence test scores (Steele, 1997; Steele &\nAronson, 1995), and this influence may operate in older\npopulations as well. It may be that older persons' perfor-\nmance is also influenced by cultural differences in attitudes\ntoward aging and in culturally related differences in neuro-\nbiological processes developed early in life (Park, Nisbett, &\nHedden, 1999). There is also evidence that racial and ethnic\ndifferences may be explained in part by bias in screening\nSex differences in cognitive functioning in old age have\nalso been identified, but the differential varies by aspect of\ncognition (Hultsch et al., 1992). Little attention has been de-\nvoted to differentials by marital status, although it might be\nhypothesized that the social interaction associated with mar-\nriage might be beneficial to cognitive functioning (Dixon &\nHealth factors.--Self-rated health and specific diseases\nhave been associated with cognitive functioning, although\neven more than in the case of demographic and socioeco-\nnomic factors, it may be difficult to sort out causality. For\nexample, depression is frequently associated with cognitive\nimpairment, but as Parmelee, Kleban, Lawton, and Katz\n(1991) have found, part of the link may be due to depression\nresulting from distress about cognitive decline. However,\nthere are specific diseases such as stroke that have a clear\nphysiological link to functioning. It is also plausible that ab-\nnormal glucose levels associated with diabetes might affect\nfunction, in particular memory (Kumari, Brunner, & Fuhrer,\n2000), but population studies provide only mixed evidence\ndepending in part on the aspect of functioning (Strachan,\nDeary, Ewing, & Frier, 1997), and it could be that some of\nthe association is due to other diabetes-related disorders.\nEvidence regarding the association of hypertension, cardio-\nvascular disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nand cognitive performance is also mixed (Zelinski, Crim-\nmins, Reynolds, & Seeman, 1998). Treatments, especially\nmedications, for these and other diseases and conditions\nmay also affect cognitive function (Luisi, Owens, & Hume,\nFinally, cognitive functioning among older people has been\nshown to be highly correlated with sensory functioning, par-\nticularly vision and hearing (Baltes & Lindenberger, 1997;\nLindenberger & Baltes, 1994; Salthouse, Hancock, Meinz, &\ncausality is not clear. It could be that cognitive decline af-\nfects sensory performance or that sensory impairment af-\nfects cognitive function, or at least performance, on tests.\nAlternatively, sensory and cognitive functions may be simi-\nlarly affected by some unmeasured factors, or they may be\npart of a common neurobiological system (Baltes & Linden-\nTesting factors.--Two other factors that may influence\nperformance on cognitive functioning tests in population-\nbased longitudinal surveys are mode of interview--in per-\nson or by telephone--and number of times the respondent\nhas been tested before. Herzog and Rodgers (1999) found\nno mode effects using experimental data from the second\nand third waves of AHEAD. With respect to training, there\nis evidence that several hours of training can improve the\nperformance of older adults on tests of fluid, mechanical in-\ntelligence (Baltes, 1993). Evidence from the HRS for the\npopulation aged 51\u00ad61, however, indicates that among that\nage group learning effects as a result of multiple interviews\nare relatively small (Herzog & Rodgers, 1999).\nMETHODS\nThe AHEAD and HRS surveys are sponsored by the Na-\ntional Institute on Aging and conducted by the University\nof Michigan. Details on the design of AHEAD can be\nfound in Soldo, Hurd, Rodgers, and Wallace (1997); the\nHRS98 is described in detail at www.umich.edu/hrswww/.\nHere we review the salient common features of the two sur-\nveys and emphasize important differences relevant to our\nanalysis.\nThe first wave of AHEAD (AHEAD93) included a na-\ntionally representative sample of initially noninstitutional-\nre-interviewed at 2-year intervals. In the fourth wave (the\nHRS98), the HRS and AHEAD surveys were merged and\nmissing cohorts added to form a uniform survey of individ-\nAHEAD and the fourth wave of the HRS provide nationally\nrepresentative cross-sections of the noninstitutionalized popu-\nThe AHEAD93 and HRS98 share several essential de-\nsign features that make comparisons across the samples\npossible. Because the overarching purpose of both studies is\nto provide an understanding of the implications of health\ndynamics in late life for transitions in economic well-being\nand for reliance on public and private support systems, large\nsections of the questionnaires are comparable across sur-\nveys. In addition, in both surveys, households were selected\non the basis of a multistage area probability sample plan,\nwith oversampling of Blacks, Hispanics, and Florida resi-\ndents. Weights provided for both years compensate for the\ndifferential probabilities of selection and are poststratified\nto the Current Population Survey (CPS) by age, sex, race,\nethnicity, and marital status groups to account for differen-\ntial nonresponse. Response rates were approximately 80%\nin the first wave of AHEAD. Early calculations suggest that\nresponse rates to the HRS98 are of a similar level.\nFour potentially important differences between the sur-\nveys are worth noting. First, AHEAD93 is a survey of the\nnoninstitutionalized population, but the HRS98 includes\nsampled persons from earlier waves who are in an institu-\ntion at the time of the interview. To make the samples com-\nparable, we excluded the institutionalized respondents in\n1998 and adjusted the weights of remaining respondents so\nthat the weighted noninstitutionalized population matches\npoststratification totals of the July 1998 CPS.\nSecond, important changes in the preferred mode of inter-\nview took place between the two surveys. In AHEAD93,\nthe preferred mode for respondents 80 years and older was a\nface-to-face interview, whereas younger respondents were\ngenerally interviewed by telephone. In HRS98, the pre-\nferred mode for respondents 80 years and older and those\ninterviewed for the first time (including most 70\u00ad74-year-\nolds) was a face-to-face interview, and other respondents\nwere generally interviewed by telephone. Consequently, 61%\nof AHEAD93 respondents had a telephone interview whereas\nonly 51% of HRS98 respondents did so. In both years, ac-\ntual mode assignment was determined by a combination of\nfactors including the health status of the respondent, with\nthose interviewed in person generally in worse health than\nthose interviewed by telephone. However, a randomized de-\nsign to test mode effects (built into the second and third\nwaves of AHEAD) has suggested that mode itself has no\nsignificant effect on cognitive functioning scores (Herzog &\nRodgers, 1999). Given this finding and the possibility that\nmode in part reflects cognitive functioning (rather than vice\nversa), we omitted mode from our models. Sensitivity anal-\nyses (not shown) suggested our results are robust to the ex-\nclusion of this variable.\nThird, the procedures according to which proxy respon-\ndents were recruited differed slightly between the two\nsurveys. In the AHEAD93 interviewers were instructed to\nattempt to obtain interviews with the sampled person when-\never possible. Individuals unable to complete the survey be-\ncause of a physical or cognitive limitation (and less often\nthose unavailable or with language difficulties) were al-\nlowed to have proxy informants report for them. In the\nHRS98 the same general approach was followed but an ad-\nditional criterion was implemented: Those who scored less\nthan a threshold score on a portion of the cognitive test trig-\ngered a signal to the interviewer that either a proxy should\nbe sought or someone should be asked to assist the respon-\ndent for the remainder of the interview. In 27 cases in our\nsample, the proxy interview was completed, and proxy an-\nswers superseded responses provided by the sampled person\n(excluding their cognitive test scores). To avoid introducing\nbias into our comparisons, we used the cognitive test scores\nof these 27 respondents and classified them as self-respon-\ndents.\nFinally, the surveys differ with respect to potential learning\neffects. Nearly three fourths of respondents to the HRS98 an-\nswered the cognitive tests in a prior interview, whereas no\nAHEAD93 respondents had the opportunity to do so (be-\ncause AHEAD93 was the baseline wave of AHEAD). Al-\nthough we were not able to control for both year and prior\ntests in our models, we did explore the effect of prior tests on\nthe risk of severe cognitive impairment among self-respon-\ndents in 1998. We found that, controlling for other demo-\ngraphic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors, having\none or more prior tests had only a small effect on the odds of\nbeing severely impaired (OR  0.83) and this effect was not\nWe used the public release version of the AHEAD93 and\nthe preliminary release of the HRS98. The HRS98 data have\nnot been cleaned and may contain errors that will be cor-\nrected in the final public release version of the data set.\nSample sizes for the population aged 70 and older were\nMeasures\nCognitive functioning.--The AHEAD93 and HRS98\nsurveys included identical tools to measure the cognitive\nfunctioning of sampled persons. In both surveys, research-\ners developed separate modules to gather information on the\ncognitive status of persons who answered for themselves\n(hereafter, self-respondents) and those who had responses\nprovided about them by a proxy (hereafter, proxy respon-\ndents).\nQuestions to elicit the cognitive functioning of self-respon-\ndents in the AHEAD93 and HRS98 were from a modified\nversion of the TICS instrument (Brandt et al., 1988). The cog-\nnitive tests appeared in a slightly different order in the\nAHEAD93 and HRS98 but included the same items. In both\nyears there were six tasks yielding a maximum of 35 points,\nwith higher scores implying better functioning. Four memory\nand two executive functioning tasks were included: (a) an im-\nmediate recall test, which required recalling as many words\nas possible from a list of 10 commonly used words immedi-\nately after the interviewer read the list (10 points); (b) a de-\nlayed recall test of the same list, approximately 5 min after\nthe list was read (10 points); (c) naming the day of the week\nand the date (i.e., month, day, and year; 4 points); (d) naming\nthe object that people usually use to cut paper, the kind of\nprickly plant that grows in the desert, the president of the\nUnited States, and the vice president (4 points); (e) a serial 7s\ntest that required subtracting 7 from 100 five times (5 points);\nand (f) counting backwards from 20 for 10 consecutive num-\nbers (2 points). The major difference between the TICS and\nthe AHEAD/HRS cognitive batteries is that the latter in-\ncluded an additional delayed word recall test and excluded\ntests of aphasia (asking respondents to repeat phrases),\napraxia (asking respondents to tap on the phone), and a test of\nnaming opposites. Thus, the AHEAD93 and HRS98 ques-\ntions provided measures of both short- and long-term mem-\nory and executive functioning (serial 7s and counting back-\nward), with the scale much more heavily weighted toward\nmeasuring memory impairments. In terms of the dichotomy\nbetween fluid and crystallized cognition, the scale probably\ntaps both dimensions but is more heavily weighted toward\nmeasures related to fluid cognitive mechanics.\nMissing information was handled in an identical fashion\nin both years. For those who refused an entire task, we fol-\nlowed Herzog and Wallace's (1997) suggestion of assigning\nthose who refused the immediate recall task a score of 2 out\nof 10, those who refused the delayed recall a score of 0 out\nof 10, and those who refused the serial 7s a score of 1 out of\n5. This imputation was based on Herzog and Wallace's find-\ning that those who refused a task performed worse on other\nsubscales than those who gave responses for all subscales.\nFor those who refused or reported that they did not know a\nspecific item within a subscale, we assigned the item a score\nof 0. We also explored alternative codings for nonresponse\n(e.g., assigning a score of 0 to subscales with missing items,\ndeleting cases with missing items).\nWe used the total score from the six tasks to identify\nthose with severe cognitive impairment. Because there is no\naccepted cutoff score for identifying those with severe cog-\nnitive impairment, we looked to the literature for guidance.\nThe original TICS used 30 (out of 41) as a cutoff, but that\nscale did not include the more difficult delayed recall task.\nFor the cognition scale in the AHEAD93 survey, Herzog\nidentifies a percentage of the population consistent with gen-\nerally observed estimates of severe cognitive impairment.\nWe adopted this latter suggestion in both years but also ex-\nplored the sensitivity of our analysis to this definition.\nWe based our classification of those with proxy respon-\ndents on reports about the sampled person's memory and\njudgment. Proxies were asked \"How would you rate [re-\nspondent's] memory at the present time? Would you say it\nis excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?\" and \"How\nwould you rate [respondent] in making judgments and deci-\nsions? Would you say he/she is excellent, very good, good,\nfair, or poor?\" Among proxy respondents, we defined se-\nvere cognitive impairment as those who were reported to\nhave poor memory and poor judgment. We also explored al-\nternative coding schemes (e.g., weighting poor memory\nmore heavily to be consistent with the self-respondent scale,\nusing only poor memory to identify severe impairment).\nIndependent variables.--Our analyses were intended to\naddress the question of whether aggregate changes between\nsons are statistically significant, and if so, whether they re-\nmain significant after controlling for demographic and so-\ncioeconomic shifts and changes in selected health-related\ncharacteristics. The key variable of interest in our analyses was\nan indicator of survey year (i.e., coded 1 for respondents in\nIn selecting control variables for this analysis, we aimed\nto include only questions that were identical in the AHEAD93\nand HRS98. Nevertheless, we were able to control for many\ndemographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors.\nDemographic variables included age (in 5-year age groups),\nsex, race (distinguishing non-White and White), Hispanic\norigin, and marital status (not married at the time of the sur-\nvey vs currently married). Socioeconomic variables in-\ncluded a measure of whether the sample person or his or her\nspouse had any liquid assets (defined as a checking or sav-\nings account or money market funds) and completed level\nof education (less than high school, high school graduate,\nmore than high school). We also explored the effects of\nfiner gradations of education (e.g., including an indicator of\ncompleting less than 8 years of education as distinct from\n8\u00ad11 years of completed education; distinguishing some\ncollege education from completing college; using a continu-\nous indicator of years of completed education), but found\nour conclusions robust to such alternative parameteriza-\ntions. In an attempt to control for intergenerational trans-\nmission of cognitive abilities, we also included an indicator\nof the sampled person's mother's educational level (8\nyears, 8 years, unknown). In doing so, we made no at-\ntempt to distinguish genetic correlations from environmen-\ntally based intergenerational transmission in early life, but\nwe recognized that either could contribute to functioning.\nWe included three measures of health related to cognitive\nfunctioning: ever having a stroke, having poor eyesight, and\nhaving poor hearing. We also investigated numerous other\nchronic conditions (e.g., having ever had high blood pres-\nsure, diabetes, cancer, chronic lung disease, heart condition,\narthritis) and lifestyle factors (e.g., current smoking status),\nbut they generally did not have statistically significant ef-\nfects on cognitive functioning nor did they change our con-\nclusion about aggregate changes in cognitive functioning.\nWe therefore excluded these variables for the sake of parsi-\nmony. We also explored the linkages among self-rated health,\ndepression, and severe cognitive impairment but chose not\nto include these measures because of the uncertainty of the\ndirection of their effects in cross-sectional samples (for dis-\ncussion of this point with respect to depression, see Parmelee\nStatistical Methods\nBecause the measures of severe cognitive impairment\ndiffered for self- and proxy respondents, we stratified all\nanalyses by proxy status. This approach explicitly controls\nfor the effects of proxy status while allowing for potentially\ndifferent thresholds for identifying the severely impaired\nbetween the two groups.\nWe tested for changes over time in the percentage with\nsevere impairment (among self-respondents and among proxy\nrespondents) using chi-square tests for independence. Among\nself-respondents we also used t tests to assess changes over\ntime in the mean score for each of the subscales and for the\ntotal cognitive score. We tested for changes in sample char-\nacteristics over time and changes in the percentage with\ncognitive impairment among various subgroups of self- and\nproxy respondents using chi-square tests for independence.\nTo explore whether changes in severe impairment were\ndue to shifts in the composition of the population, we used\nlogistic regression. We first estimated odds ratios and 95%\nconfidence intervals from models including only a term for\n95% confidence intervals from models controlling for de-\nmographic and socioeconomic characteristics, health-related\nfactors, and testing factors. Statistical significance of differ-\nences between self- and proxy respondents were obtained\nfrom a single model in which proxy status was interacted\nwith all covariates.\nThe AHEAD93 and HRS98 employed different sampling\nfractions for the youngest sample members (in the HRS98,\nin the AHEAD93). We therefore weighted all analyses.\nBecause the HRS98 is a preliminary release, information\non sampling units has not yet been made publicly available.\nConsequently, it was not possible to adjust standard errors\nfor the complex design of the surveys. All p values and con-\nfidence intervals presented were therefore based on the as-\nsumption that the AHEAD93 and HRS98 are simple ran-\ndom samples. We were able to explore the implications of\nthis assumption for our analysis using design effects esti-\nmated for the AHEAD93 (for which sampling unit informa-\ntion is available). We found for self-respondents the design\neffects for the variables in our models ranged from 0.54 to\n1.82; similarly, for proxy respondents the design effects\ntaking the ratio of the variances produced by SUDAAN to\nthe variances produced by SAS for the full logistic regres-\nsion models.) Even if we assumed the design effects for\nchanges over time were the size of the largest AHEAD93\ndesign effect (i.e., 1.82), the overwhelming majority of tests\nsignificant at the .05 level in our tables remained so. More-\nover, unless otherwise noted, our conclusions about aggre-\ngate changes over time in cognitive functioning remained\nrobust to such design effects.\nFinally, we explored an additional adjustment to compen-\nsate for the fact that many respondents (N  4,812) ap-\npeared in both the AHEAD93 and HRS98 samples.

Al-\nthough the level of severe impairment changed depending\non whether refusals were given low scores, assigned a zero,\nor deleted altogether, the percentage classified as severely\nimpaired consistently declined over time, while the mean\nsubscale and total scores increased.\nPatterns among self- and proxy respondents also appeared to\nbe robust to alternative definitions of severe (see Table 3).\nAmong self-respondents declines in severe cognitive impair-\nment were observed irrespective of whether we used a cutoff of\nproxy respondents, no significant change was evident for a\nscheme that weighted memory more heavily than judgment.\nOver the same period, the composition of the older popu-\nlation also changed substantially on several factors previ-\nously shown to be related to cognitive impairment. As\nshown in Table 4, among self-respondents, the most sub-\nstantial change was in educational attainment, with the pro-\nportion who had not graduated from high school declining\nfrom almost 40% to 32%. Also substantial were improve-\nments in mother's education and ownership of liquid assets\nTable 2.

And, as noted ear-\nlier, more of the interviews in 1998 were conducted in per-\nson. Among those for whom proxies responded, there were\nsubstantial increases in mother's education and ownership\nof liquid assets.\nAs shown in Table 5, among the vast majority of sub-\ngroups of self-respondents, the percentage with severe cogni-\ntive impairment declined. Perhaps most striking were results\nfor the oldest age group: among self-respondents, only 7.6%\nwere unusually consistent across groups: Statistically signifi-\ncant improvements (p  .05) were observed for all subgroups\nexcept those of Hispanic origin, those who were high school\ngraduates only, and those whose ownership of liquid assets\nwas unknown. Small sample sizes and insufficient power\ncould possibly explain the lack of significant improvement\nfor the first and third groups. In the case of Hispanics, under\nthe simple random sample assumptions we used to calculate\nsignificance levels, the change over time was borderline in-\nsignificant (p  .051). It was unclear whether this change\nwould be statistically significant after taking into account all\nsurvey design-related effects (e.g., oversampling of Hispanics\nin both years, clustering of Hispanics in geographic areas,\nand overlapping of Hispanic respondents in both samples),\nbecause the design components operated in both directions.\nFor other subgroups, significant improvements were likely to\npersist after taking into consideration potential design effects,\nexcept for those subgroups in Table 5 with a p value between\n.01 and .05. In contrast, among proxy respondents the vast\nmajority of subgroups did not experience significant declines\nin the proportion with severe impairment.\nThe patterns in cognitive functioning we observed were\nsustained when we tested for change over time in a multivari-\nate model (Table 6). Among self-respondents, in the year-only\nmodel, the odds of being severely impaired in 1998 were\n0.59). Compared to the year-only model, the odds ratio was\nonly slightly attenuated in the full model; that is, after we con-\ntrolled for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics\nand select health-related factors, the odds ratio for 1998 versus\ndents, in both models the odds of being severely impaired\nmodel), but these differences were not statistically significant.\nAmong self-respondents, being 80 and older, being non-\nWhite, having less than a high school diploma, having no\nliquid assets, and ever having had a stroke were especially\nstrong predictors of having severe cognitive impairment,\nraising one's odds of being impaired twofold or more. Be-\ning a high school graduate and having additional education\n(the omitted category) did not differ in their effects. Other\nfactors raising the odds of impairment were being Hispanic,\nhaving a mother who received fewer than 8 years of educa-\ntion, and having hearing problems.\nA smaller set of variables was important in predicting se-\nvere cognitive impairment among proxy respondents. More-\nover, many of those predictors had different effects for\nproxy respondents than for self-respondents, as indicated by\nthe chi-square tests in the final column of Table 6. For ex-\nample, among the proxy respondent sample, those with less\nthan a high school education were less likely than others to\nbe described as having poor memory and judgment, whereas\neffects were just the opposite among self-respondents. Be-\ning non-White and having no liquid assets had effects only\namong self-respondents, but having poor vision had an ef-\nfect only in the proxy sample.\nDISCUSSION\nWe find that the percentage of community-dwelling adults\naged 70 and older with severe cognitive impairment declined\nTable 5.

Statistical tests pertain to differences in\nthe percentage with severe cognitive impairment over time.\nthe cognitive interview for themselves, improvements are\nlarge and statistically significant. For respondents evaluated\nby proxies, we observe declines in the proportion with poor\nmemory but not with poor judgment. The overall decline does\nnot appear to be an artifact of decisions about coding refusals\nor definitions of severe impairment. Further, the patterns we\nobserve are robust to controls for a variety of demographic\nand socioeconomic factors and health-related characteristics.\nOur finding that improvements occurred among self-respon-\ndents but not proxy respondents is noteworthy. In both\nyears, it appears that a core group of respondents could not\nanswer for themselves because of severe cognitive impair-\nment and thus participated in the survey through proxy re-\nspondents. Moreover, in both years, those for whom a proxy\nresponded constitute a select group, less healthy according\nto measures we included, more likely to be from a minority\npopulation, and more likely to be of low socioeconomic\nstatus than those responding for themselves. It may be that\nthe severity of impairment declined among the proxy re-\nspondent group, but our proxy-provided measures of severe\nimpairment for this group may not be sensitive enough to\nidentify subtle changes. Notwithstanding this potential weak-\nness, our results suggest that the improvements we find\namong self-respondents are not due to a change in the pro-\nportion of proxy respondents over time.\nHow do our results compare to other studies of trends in\ncognitive functioning? Such comparisons are difficult to\nmake, even for a single year, given that existing studies dif-\nfer from ours with respect to years studied, age groups, and\nmeasures of cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, our find-\nings agree with the general pattern of historical improve-\nment summarized by Salthouse (1991). For example, on the\nis biased toward upper socioeconomic groups, Salthouse\nfive primary mental abilities of, on average, 0.07 standard\nT-score units (a distribution with M  50 and SD  10) per\nyear. Limiting this exercise to those in the upper age range\nfor dimensions with significant improvement (verbal and\nreasoning skills), we calculate improvements on the order of\n0.20 standard T-score units per year. Among self-respon-\ndents in our sample, who were aged 70 and older, we find\nmuch larger improvements: Mean scores increase from 19.6\nments of 0.55 standard T-score units per year.\nThe improvements we find are also somewhat larger in\npercentage terms than those observed during the 1980s and\nearly 1990s for measures of physical disability, which have\nranged roughly from 1% to 2% per year. Our estimates of de-\ncline are much larger: For the noninstitutionalized population\naged 70 and older, relative annual declines are on the order of\n8% per year over the 5-year period. In making such compari-\nsons it is important to keep in mind that the base for calculat-\ning percentage change is much smaller for cognitive than for\nphysical impairment, so even small percentage point im-\nprovements (2.5 percentage points in this case) appear to be\nquite large gains (more than 40% improvement over 5 years).\nWhat could be causing such large improvements? Under-\nlying the decline in severe cognitive impairment we observe\nare undoubtedly complex shifts in the incidence of and\nlength of time lived in the community with severe cognitive\nimpairment, the latter being a function of recovery rates,\nTable 6. Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) for Predictors of Severe\nCognitive Impairment, by Proxy Status, Noninstitutionalized Population Aged 70 and Older\nPredictor\nSelf-Respondents Proxy Respondents\nYear-Only Model\nFull Model\nNotes: Model estimates are weighted. In the last column, 2 statistics and significance levels pertain to tests of equality of self and proxy model coefficients. Un-\nnursing home admission and discharge rates, and mortality\nrates. Although data are not yet available for us to calculate\nthe relative contribution of these components to aggregate\nchanges in cognitive impairment, our analysis permits us to\nspeculate about several potential explanations for the shifts\nwe observe. The first two possible explanations relate to\nsurvey design and selection issues; the remaining discussion\nfocuses on potential environmental changes related to medi-\ncine, behavioral lifestyle factors, and cultural factors.\nWith respect to survey design matters, one possibility is\nthat older persons with severe cognitive impairment are more\nhence outside the scope of our analysis). However, there is\nevidence that the size of the nursing home population may\nhave declined slightly as a percentage of the older population\nexplanation is unlikely. It may be that within nursing homes,\nseverely cognitively impaired residents represent an increas-\ning share of the residents, a hypothesis consistent with the in-\ncrease in special care units devoted to Alzheimer's disease\nand related dementias during this period (Rhoades & Krauss,\n1999). Our calculations suggest, however, that to fully ex-\nplain the improvements we find the percentage of severely\nimpaired residents in nursing homes would have had to in-\ncrease from 40% to 100% over this 5-year period, an increase\nwe believe is implausible, given estimates from the early\ntia-related symptoms (Rovner & Katz, 1993).\nAnother possible explanation related to survey design is\nthat those with cognitive limitations may have been more\nlikely than others to have been lost to follow-up over time.\nAt this writing, accurate data on nonresponse to the HRS98\nare not yet available, so we explored this issue using the sec-\nond wave of AHEAD. We found that among respondents to\nthe first wave of AHEAD, 4.2% of those followed up in\n1995 in the community were severely cognitively impaired\ndead) in 1995 were severely impaired at baseline. We also\nfound that controlling for variables used to poststratify the\ndata (e.g., age, sex, marital status, race/ethnicity) did not\nfully explain these differentials. We interpreted these results\nCPS in 1998 probably accounts for some but not all of the\ndifferential loss to follow-up by cognitive status. On the ba-\nsis of these findings, we calculated what the rate of severe\ncognitive impairment might have been in 1998 had there\nbeen no loss to follow-up in the AHEAD between 1993 and\n1998. In making these calculations we assumed that the ratio\nof deaths to missing cases was the same in 1998 as it was in\nproximately 11%. We also assumed the rate of severe im-\npairment in 1998 among those who were lost to follow-up\nwas equal to the rate in 1993 for those eventually lost to fol-\nlow-up (8.7%). We found that, under these assumptions, the\nrather than the 3.6% we found for that year. The revised ag-\naverage a decline of 7% per year--would likely still be sta-\ntistically significant for a sample of this size.\nAssuming survey design issues do not fully explain the\nimprovements we are finding, are there environmental fac-\ntors that may be responsible? Certainly changes in the treat-\nment of dementia and related co-morbid conditions such as\ndepression, stroke, and nutritional deficits (e.g., electrolyte\nimbalances) may be contributing to the better maintenance,\nand in some cases recovery, of cognitive functioning. In ad-\nditional analyses limited to respondents appearing in both\nthose classified as having severe impairment in 1993 were\nnot severely impaired in 1998. Moreover, among respon-\ndents completing the cognitive test in both years, approxi-\nmately half scored the same or better in 1998 than they did\nin 1993. Such individual-level improvements are consistent\nwith the growing array of treatment options for older Amer-\nicans with cognitive deficits and related co-morbidities, but\nwith these data it is difficult to sort out specific treatments\nrelated to the improvements we observe. For example, the\napproval in the late 1990s of new drug treatments for Alz-\nheimer's disease (e.g., Donepezil in 1997) might be ex-\npected to improve functioning (McRae, 1999); however, such\ntreatments are generally limited to those in the early stages\nof Alzheimer's rather than those with severe cognitive im-\npairment (the group we focused on in our analysis). Im-\nprovements in stroke treatment may be partly responsible;\nhowever, our findings suggest that changes in ever having a\nstroke explain little of the decline we observe in severe cog-\nnitive impairment. Improvements in cognition may also be\nthe result of the expanded availability of treatments for de-\npression; indeed, in exploratory analyses we found aggre-\ngate-level declines in the presence of depressive symptom-\nology among self-respondents, and others have shown strong\ncorrelations between individual-level cognition and depres-\nsion scores (Parmelee et al., 1991). Analysis of panel data is\nrequired to untangle the complex relationship among treat-\nment protocols, cognition, and co-morbidities, a topic that\nclearly needs further investigation.\nChanges in other important behavioral and lifestyle factors\nmay also be contributing to better maintenance of cognitive\nfunctioning in old age. We looked at some lifestyle factors\n(e.g., current smoking) but did not find any significant effect\non the prevalence of severe cognitive impairment. Over this\nperiod, estrogen use, which may affect cognitive function-\ning--particularly memory--in postmenopausal women (Shay-\nwitz & Shaywitz, 2000), also increased dramatically (DuBois,\nChawla, Neslusan, Smith, & Wade, 2000). Our finding that\nboth men and women experience improvements in cognitive\nfunctioning suggests estrogen use alone cannot fully explain\nobserved improvements. Further research on the link between\nthese and other potentially important behavioral and lifestyle\nfactors (e.g., dietary habits, vitamin supplementation, exer-\ncise) and cognitive functioning in old age could prove to be\nilluminating.\nA final possibility is that there may be broad social\nchanges at work that are not captured by our models. Others\nhave suggested that changes in the quality of education\n(e.g., in terms of curriculum, class size, teacher preparation)\ncould account for some of the time-related improvements in\ncognitive ability, although there is little agreement on direc-\ntion of such changes, and evidence based on school-aged\nchildren does not support such an argument (Salthouse,\n1991). The fact that the improvements we observed were\nmost salient among those with less than a high school edu-\ncation draws attention to the possibility that cultural forces\noutside the classroom may be at work. For example, changes\nin the culture of testing outside the classroom may make\nmore recent cohorts of elderly persons--particularly those\nwith less than a high school education--better equipped to\nanswer cognitive tests. Others have noted the conflicting\nviews on the role of multimedia and information technology\non the minds of both young and old (Baltes's Foreword in\nSchaie, 1996), but our results suggest, on balance, no net\nnegative effect for older Americans of the recent technolog-\nical explosion in our society.\nIrrespective of the underlying causes, this study provides\na first step in understanding how cognitive functioning may\nhave changed recently among older Americans. The prelim-\ninary evidence is quite positive: As a group, older persons,\nespecially those well into their 80s, appear to have better\ncognitive functioning today than they did in the early 1990s.\nAlthough we have only two data points, making it impossi-\nble to draw conclusions about long-term trends, these find-\nings suggest that the improvement in physical functioning\nobserved in recent years among older Americans may have\nbeen accompanied by improvements in cognitive function-\ning. How the two trends interrelate is unclear. It may be that\nimproved cognitive functioning accounts for much of the\ndecline in IADL disability observed during the 1980s and\nearly 1990s; alternatively, improvements in underlying\nhealth may be driving both physical and cognitive function-\ning. Untangling the complex relationship between improve-\nments in the mind and in the body in old age is a fruitful\narea for further research.\nA recent report by the National Research Council (Stern\n& Carstensen, 2000) on future directions for cognitive re-\nsearch on aging highlighted the plasticity of the human\nmind, even well into old age. Indeed, one of the most widely\nknown models of cognitive functioning in old age, Baltes's\nmodel of selective optimization with compensation (Baltes\n& Baltes, 1990), describes a highly adaptive phenomena in\nwhich the cognitive processes of older persons can be en-\nhanced under favorable environmental conditions. Our find-\nings suggest that cognitive ability should also be considered\na dynamic phenomenon at the aggregate level. This conclu-\nsion suggests in turn that policymakers interested in project-\ning medical and social service needs may well consider how\nfuture trends in cognitive functioning might affect demand\nfor acute and long-term care services.\n"
