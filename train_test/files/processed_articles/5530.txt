The article delineates\nprinciples of a community-based participatory approach to research in Africa. After first outlining the essential tenets of a\ncommunity-based research (CBR) that are relevant for research projects in Africa, the article argued that the existing CBR\nlacked a specifically African philosophical basis. It explained the uniqueness of the African philosophy. It then summed up the\nresearch principles based on that philosophy. Last, the challenges of conducting such a research study in Africa were outlined.\nDespite the African emphasis of the overall approach, this proposed methodology may be employed in similar settings where\nissues such as decolonization are important variables in the research strategy.\n",

For example, in the American Indian context,\n\"Many tribes now require that research proposals be\napproved by either tribal councils or cultural committees\"\nConnell (2007) have sought to overturn the false equation\nthat Western knowledge equals universal knowledge, both\nby contextualizing Western knowledge production as being\nlocated in a very specific time, place, and culture, and by\npresenting writing from Southern knowledge traditions.\nCentral to this decolonizing project is the reality of colo-\nnization and other historic encounters of imperialism\nbetween the West and the rest. Research guidelines and pro-\ntocols now need to take cognizance of the fact that the very\nword research currently conjures up or evokes bad memories\namong indigenous and colonized people. Such use collectiv-\nizes the African experience alongside that of millions of\nothers who encountered colonial imperialism. The grand\nscale of the colonization of Africa has already been suffi-\nciently documented (Rodney, 1972). Thus, the need for a\ndecolonized methodology for research among indigenous\npeoples is particularly pertinent to Africa. At issue here\ntherefore is not necessarily \"foreigners\" researching about\nAfricans and other colonized people. The concern includes\nthose, like us, researching among rural African communities\nbut trained within the Western academy. The perception of\nsuch researchers is one of \"the outsider within\" or \"outsiders,\nbecause of their Western education\" (Smith, 2012, p. 5).\nHaving attempted a decolonized methodology, we intend\nto delineate here some helpful principles of a community-\nbased approach to research in Africa. This is done through a\nfourfold structure. First, this brief article outlines the essen-\ntial tenets of a community-based research (CBR). It points\nout the relevance of the CBR principles for research in\nAfrica, highlighting examples of adaptation of CBR within\nfeminist and cultural perspectives. Second, it then argues that\nthe existing CBR does not satisfy the fundamental elements\nof the African culture. It explains what constitutes these\n1University of Nottingham, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nJohn-Okoria Ibhakewanlan, University of Nottingham, Dearing Building,\nWollaton Road, Nottingham NG8 1BB, UK.\nEmail: jo@jesuits.net\nToward an African Community-Based\nResearch (ACBR) Methodology\nJohn-Okoria Ibhakewanlan1 and Simon McGrath1\n Keywords\nAfrica, data collection, education, education theory and practice, educational research, philosophy, research methodology\nand design, research methods\n2 SAGE Open\nbasic elements. Third, the article outlines the principles of a\nmore comprehensive approach to an African Community-\nBased Research or ACBR approach. Last, some challenges\nof ACBR are expressed. As we will explore in more detail\nlater in the article, we write in term of \"Africa(n)\" while\nacknowledging the dangers of any such shorthand term.\nDefining the Existing CBR\nCBR has become prominent in recent years. \"Universities\nand funding agencies are increasingly calling for collabora-\ntive research between community partners and academics\"\nis traceable to the revolutionary approaches of the 1970s by\noppressed communities in South America, parts of Asia, and\nmuch of Africa. These oppressed peoples were attempting to\nestablish self-critical communities in the post-colonial\nperiod. Their approach also found much common ground\nwith concurrent trends in feminism (Maguire, 1987).\nBrazilian educator, Paulo Freire, provided the \"critical\ngrounding\" for the CBR approach (Minkler, 2005, p. 4).\nTherefore, CBR could be seen as an orientation to research\nwith specific assumptions while employing any qualitative\nor quantitative methodology.\nCBR draws upon constructivism and shares in some of\nthe wider criticisms of positivism. It sees research as deeply\ncontextual. Not only does the setting matter hugely, but the\nmethods adopted should be determined by the purpose of the\nstudy. Such methods must respect \"the input of community\nparticipants . . . in understanding of the phenomenon under\nCBR emphasizes the socially created nature of knowl-\nedge and thus seeks the participation and influence of com-\nmunity members (as non-academic researchers) in the study\nor research process. Members of the community are under-\nstood here as possessing common symbols and shared norms.\nBased on respect for the community, CBR attempts to build\non such shared values so as to address communal concerns\n(Israel et al., 1998). It should also encompass the socio-cul-\ntural factors that affect research. As such, each culture or\nsociety would adapt CBR to its own history or specific con-\ntext. Based on the above summary of CBR, four tenets are\ndeducible from this research approach:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Constructivist\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Context based\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Purpose driven\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Community participation\nA fifth element, ethical consideration, is essential to all\nacademic researches (British Educational Research\nAssociation, 2011). However, we believe that legal defini-\ntions of ethics must be framed according to theAfrican world-\nview and understanding of the individual. This worldview\nwill be explained later. Otherwise, these tenets and other\nvariations and additions to CBR approaches are universally\nrelevant.\nRelevance of CBR Principles for\nResearch in Africa\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Constructivist: The constructivist approach of CBR\nfinds resonance in the African view of knowledge and\nreality--as will be explained later.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Purpose driven: African thinkers such as Kwasi\nWiredu agree that one must accept any mode of\ninquiry from \"our erstwhile colonisers\" if it is benefi-\ncial to the African community. What is rejected is that\nwhich is imposed and may not be beneficial to the\ncommunity (Wiredu, 1998). Smith similarly reiterates\nthe purpose-driven aspect of researches among colo-\nnized peoples by saying that, irrespective of who the\nresearcher may be, such studies must be of \"useful-\nness\" to the local community. It must also be \"ethical\"\nand \"respectful\" of local communal values (Smith,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Community participation: This is an important\ndimension of CBR for research activities in Africa.\nAccording to Higgs, CBR in Africa contrasts with\naction research, as it is more \"process oriented\" and\nnot necessarily targeting a specific \"product\" but\naimed at strengthening the knowledge of the commu-\nmethodological research because it is not merely\nabout the community; instead it is done with the com-\nmunity. Higgs uses the term trans-traditional vantage\nto describe the notion that although CBR in Africa\nhighlights the African way of knowing, it also\nacknowledges the validity of other non-African\nknowledge systems.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Context based: The context-based aspect of CBR\nrefers to the adaptation of CBR to local contexts. It is\nnot clear precisely what aspects of the local context. Is\nthis a material or ideological adaptation? This will be\ntaken up later as the basis for our approach. Currently\nvarious participative adaptations of CBR have taken\nthe form either of a cultural or feminist perspective.\nSuch participative approaches place emphasis on\nhegemony. Two examples may suffice here:\nFirst, a participative approach to research has been used to\naddress feminist concerns. By involving the actual experi-\nences of women, this approach to CBR combines knowl-\nedge with action so as to bring about social change toward\neliminating gender disparities or oppression of women. In\n\"An Emergent Africana Feminist Methodology,\" Assatai\nZerai explores an Africana feminist sociological perspec-\ntive and framework. The approach considers ways in\nwhich \"nation, race, class, gender, sexuality, globalisation,\nand other dimensions of oppression\" may intersect and\nIbhakewanlanand McGrath 3\nimpact the experiences and agency of research partici-\npants. Zerai's focus is on those with health care and social\nsupport in Zimbabwe (Zerai, 2014). By adapting the intel-\nlectual work of Africana feminists, the work proposes a\nnew Africana feminist methodology.\nA second example of the context-based approach is from\na cultural perspective. Whatever the research topic, health\nor education, culture is at the center of the study. This is\nparticularly pertinent to CBR in Africa. By involving the\ncommunity in the study, this approach to CBR situates\nculture at the hub of combining knowledge with action\ntoward achieving the aim of the study. The PEN-3 cultural\nmodel is a practical example of a research approach\ndesigned to guide researchers to always begin with the\npositive contexts of human culture and behavior. PEN-3\nis an acronym for three separate factors within three dis-\ntinct domains. In the Cultural Identity domain, PEN\nstands for Person, Extended Family and Neighbourhood.\nIn the domain of Relationships and Expectations, it stands\nfor Perceptions, Enablers and Nurturers. Thirdly, in the\nCultural Empowerment domain, PEN stands for Positive,\nExistential and Negative. This cultural model is men-\ntioned here only as an example of a cultural perspective of\nthe context-based approach. \"Culture in this context refers\nto shared values, norms, and codes that collectively shape\na group's beliefs, attitudes, and behaviour through their\ninteraction in and with their environments\" (Iwelunmor,\nhas been applied in health-related research projects among\nethnic minorities.\nWhether from gender issues or a cultural perspective,\nCBR approaches have ensured collaboration that equitably\ninvolves and recognizes all stakeholders in the research pro-\ncess. However, as some have noted, \"the philosophy and\nmethods of this approach is the cornerstone of improved\ncommunity-based research\" (Ahmed, Beck, Maurana, &\nThe Limitation of CBR in Africa\nAny research methodology must attach itself to a specific\nphilosophy (Duberly, Johnson, & Cassell, 2013). The above\nCBR principles may be helpful for research work in Africa,\nbut they do not indicate the philosophy they represent. This\nis what we consider as the central weakness of the context-\nbased aspect of CBR. Without specifying its philosophical\nfoundation as African, a CBR approach in Africa may not\naddress a crucial issue underpinning research work in the\ncontinent, namely, the issue of decolonization. The term\ndecolonization as used here means establishing the African\nontological and epistemological perspectives as the basis of\nthe research inquiry. The aim of decolonization is to counter-\nact the continued impact of colonization on African research.\nAlthough the full extent of the human and cultural\ndestruction suffered by Africa remains untold, some authors\n(Abdi, Puplampu, & Dei, 2006) point out that the most dev-\nastating aspect of colonization is the damage done to the\nAfrican mind--cut off from its philosophical roots. Thus, for\na research study to be decolonized, ultimately to be African\nor make claims about Africa, it needs to adopt the African\nperspective.\nAfrica's Unique Perspective\nThe four principles identified in CBR do not seem to include\nwhat we consider as the fundamental elements of an African\nculture. These underlying elements constitute a worldview,\nwhich would doubly serve here as the philosophical basis for\nthe research methodology that will be proposed as an ACBR.\nAny claim for a worldview for such a vast continent requires\ndetailed explanation or justification. The many and various\nAfrican perspectives will not be examined; rather, as philos-\nophers like Diop (1962) have argued, beneath the diversity of\nviews lies a \"cultural unity\" in Africa (p. 7). For the purpose\nof framing the philosophical underpinning of ACBR, three\naspects of this cultural unity will be presented:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A relational understanding of the individual,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A social view of knowledge/existence, and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A theocentric perspective of the environment.\nA Relational Understanding of Person\nA point of convergence in the perspectives of experts on the\ncontinent is in the African understanding of the human per-\nSemali & Kincheloe, 1999). According to this perspective of\nperson, the individual exists only as a part of the community.\nFor the Yoruba tribe of West Africa, this relational view of\nthe individual has moral implications:\nThe corporeal individual, essentially, cannot continue in-being\nwithout a community . . . Since the social life of a group of\nindividual beings is sustained by a spirit of sodality, any form of\nself-alienation for the purpose of pursuing a purely selfish aim\nis, morally speaking, an error or sin . . . . (Akiwowo, 1986,\nVarious other descriptions exist in other African commu-\nnities showing the strictly social connection of the individ-\nual. This African view of the person as relational is often\npresented in contrast to the Western understanding of the\nperson as unconnected to any community (e.g., Higgs, 2010).\nTo emphasize the contrast between the African and Western\nunderstandings of the person, one finds statements such as,\nin contrast to \"not some isolated static quality of rationality\"\n4 SAGE Open\nof the person. Descartes' cogito ergo sum, \"I think, therefore\nZulu expression \"Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu,\" \"I belong,\ntherefore I am,\" or, as translated by Mbiti, \"we are, therefore,\nIn summary, this view of the person as necessarily in rela-\ntion to the rest of the community is referred to as communal-\nism. According to Wiredu, \"a communalist outlook seems to\nbe quite widespread in traditional life on the (African) conti-\nJohn Mbiti in terms of \"whatever happens to the individual\nhappens to the whole group\" and vice versa (Mbiti, 1969,\np. 109). This means that there is no lone researcher-genius\ndetached from a community of learners. However, commu-\nnalism does not subjugate the freedom or autonomy of the\nindividual. Rather, as an African research perspective, com-\nmunalism means that the individual researcher finds identity\nand meaning in the community while retaining his or her\nown rational independence. Again, the idea of a lone\nresearcher would therefore be invalid in this perspective.\nUltimately, in line with the constructivist principle, the com-\nmunity's reality is constructed socially (Ibhakewanlan,\n2014). The validity of that reality or knowledge thereof lies\nin the fact that it is a product of the shared discourse of the\ncommunity--this is the next point.\nA Social View of Knowledge/Existence\nThe community's shared discourse or the social view of\nknowledge is related to the above understanding of the indi-\nvidual. In other words, the individual and the communal are\ntwo sides of the same coin. Two aspects will be looked at in\nthis communalist view: the epistemological (view of knowl-\nedge) and the nature of existence (ontological). Thus, com-\nmunalism also guides the epistemological and ontological\npositions of this approach.\nEpistemological view.Although epistemology refers to \"the\nnature of knowledge,\" there are as many epistemological\nperspectives as there are theoretical traditions (Merriam,\n2014, p. 8). TheAfrican epistemological perspective detaches\nitself from the paradigm wars based on the viewpoint ofAfri-\n1980). According to this view, the validity of any African\nacademic discourse lies in the question of relevance or use-\nfulness to the African community at any particular time. This\nmeans knowledge is circumscribed by the community's time\nand place as well as other local factors.\nSuch an epistemological assumption has implications for\nthe overall methodology. For example, a positivist episte-\nmology would mean carrying out research study with a \"sci-\nentific mentality\" that emphasizes a \"pursuit of objectivity\"\nepistemological view, knowledge is non-objectivist but\nrequires \"community-validity.\" By community-validity is\nmeant the shared discourse based on communalism. To\nexplain briefly, the term community-validity is used here to\nrefer to the common point of reference in the shared dis-\ncourse. For example, when Mbiti quotes the Zulu expression\nUmuntu ngumuntu ngabantu, it is presumed that everyone in\nthe Zulu community understands what the term means. It is\nthat degree of common understanding and awareness of a\nparticular social reality that is meant by community-validity.\nCentral to this view is the African understanding of commu-\nnity and the place of the individual in society. The shared\ndiscourse does not presuppose unanimity. Because no com-\nmunity may enjoy perfect unanimity on all issues, the degree\nof unanimity is directly proportional to the extent of the com-\nmunity-validity. This reflects the constructivist dimension to\nthis epistemology, for knowledge is understood as con-\nstructed by the community. The truth of what is known\nthrough research then becomes dependent on the scope and\nscale of the community-validity.\nIs there still objective truth if knowledge is socially con-\nstructed? Yes, but any such truth claim would be directly pro-\nportional to the community-validity. On the question of the\nstatus of eternal truths independent of the community, we\nwould require an eternal community to behold an eternal truth\nthat is independent of any community. In other words, as the\nnext paragraphs will hopefully make clearer, such a question\nis nonsensical from the perspective of communalism.\nAn ontological view.What the ontological question asks is\nwhether \"social reality is external\" or the \"product of indi-\nvidual consciousness\" (Cohen et al., 2011, p. 7). With the\nabove epistemological view that saw knowledge as socially\nconstructed, does objective reality exist? Another way of\nasking the question is whether research findings in Africa are\ntrue outside the community members' experience. The Afri-\ncan reality is not eternal or unchanging but exists as it is\nexperienced here and now by the specific community. This\nagain raises a relativist implication.\nIs the ontological status of the social reality constructed\nby a community true, beyond the consciousness of its indi-\nvidual members? The various individual \"consciousnesses\"\nexperiencing a particular social reality merely constitute the\ncommunal discourse specific to that community. As every\ncommunal discourse is its own validity, so too is the proof of\na given knowledge inherent in the knowledge itself. In a sim-\nilar way, reality is its own proof. There may be a hierarchy of\nknowledge and of existence; some peoples may learn from\nothers, a culture from another, or even one species from\nanother; yet every reality remains capable of retaining its\nown communal-validity. These insights about knowledge\nand reality could be represented by an endless series of con-\ncentric circles as depicted in Figure 1 below.\nTake for instance a Western engineer and a Masai herds-\nman who are mutually unaware of each other's reality. To the\nengineer, the reality constructed at a fire-side chat in Africa\nmay appear to lack objectivity, but so too would be the\nIbhakewanlanand McGrath 5\nreality of iPad programming to a Masai community. Yet each\nsocial reality exists independent of individual perception or\ncognition based on their particular community-validity (the\nshared discourse of that community). What this means is that\nreality and community ought not to be separated but expanded\nto embrace each other. If the Masai herdsman joins the iPad\nmanufacturing community, the programming of that gadget\nbecomes part of the Masai's reality. The more iPad engineers\njoin the fire-side chat in the rural African village, the more\n\"external\" (Cohen et al., 2011, p. 7) is the social reality cre-\nated through the chat.\nYet our view is that the \"external\" and \"internal\" distinc-\ntion is illusory. The distinction is only a handicap of space and\ntime--taking, for example, the when and where of the Masai\nherdsman and the Western engineer. The \"external\" nature of\na reality socially constructed is objective for those who are\npart of the communal discourse. When others outside the\ncommunity join the discourse, its \"external\" status becomes\nvalidated--but only for those joining the circle of discourse.\nIn the above image, each circle is complete in its own right.\nAs with an expanding universe that creates new space, and its\nontological status is not dependent on the to-be-created\n\"external\" space, social reality exists independent of any indi-\nvidual consciousness that is not yet part of the communal dis-\ncourse. Hence, for all practical purposes, it does not make\nsense to speak of a social reality existing outside a commu-\nnity. How can space exist without matter? Every reality\nrequires a community to represent it or experience and\ndescribe it. These are the ontological and epistemological\npositions, which also affirm the African philosophy of com-\nmunalism that should form the basis of a CBR in Africa.\nA Theocentric Perspective of the Environment\nThe third aspect of the cultural unity to be presented is the\nplace of nature and religion in Africa. People in rural African\nvillages have a sense of relationship to nature, which is\nalmost like a reverence. As African villagers are traditionally\nsubsistence farmers, with some hunting alongside, there is a\ndaily dependence on the physical world (of plants, animals,\nthe elements and physical features). \"To people of this kind\nland was something akin to water or air; it had no owner . . .\"\nnon-human world as something to be owned and exploited,\nthey are viewed as respectable \"beings\" that exist in a rela-\ntionship with the community and a divine or transcendent\nreality.\nFor the \"scientific\" minded, this relationship to the physi-\ncal and non-human world would be interpreted as animism,\nnature worship, and earth cult. Such an interpretation would\nreflect a lack of appreciation of the symbolism of the African\nculture--for such cults/nature worship are not true of the vil-\nlages studied by this researcher:\nIt might be expected that cults of the sun and the moon would\nplay a large part in the life of African peoples, since such cults\nwere of great importance in ancient Egyptian religion. But in\nfact such worship is rare even in the pantheons of West Africa.\nIt is true that \"many things are held in great esteem for\nreligious reasons, such as mountains, waterfalls, rocks, some\nforests and trees, birds, animals and insects\" (Mbiti, 1991,\np. 33). However, this esteem is not immediately at the level\nof worship or religion, but only reflects the unity of relation-\nship that these people experience with the cosmic and divine\nrealities. This unity of relationship, between the divine and\nmaterial/human world, is often presented as the striking\ndichotomy between the Western and African approaches to\nknowledge. As Chivaura puts it,\nThe differences between African and European worldviews . . .\nrelate to differences in their attitudes towards the material and\nthe spiritual. Africans regard them as compatible. (Chivaura,\nThe distinction between the African and Western perspec-\ntives may appear overly dichotomous, but it at least reflects\nthe African emphasis on these issues. We believe these\nAfrican elements are also somewhat present in the Western\napproach to knowledge and understanding of the person.\nHowever, to dismiss the claims of African intellectuals to\nwhat is generally seen as a people's worldview only height-\nens the dichotomy:\nWith rural people, and even with many township dwellers in\nSouth Africa, the role of divine beings, ancestors, sacred places\n(like isivivane), sacred people and sacred objects needs to be\naddressed. To touch on these issues is to compel our\nWesternised intellectuals to experience severe conceptual\nviolence, and yet many of them secretly subscribe to these\nA Summary of the African Perspective\nThe above three aspects of the African perspective of knowl-\nedge can be summed up in one word: costheantropic. The\nFigure 1. Knowledge and reality as concentric circles.\n6 SAGE Open\npattern is one of a holistic relationship to three realms: their\nphysical environment, cosmos; their strong religious spirit\nand sense of the Divine, theos; last, anthropos, their relation-\nship to others or communalism. Three Greek words (cosmos,\ntheos, and anthropos) are used here to represent the African\nsense of these physical and non-human worlds, the transcen-\ndent world, and the world of people (Ibhakewanlan, 2003).\nThe researcher's relationship to these realms is represented\nin Figure 2.\nThus, in the African cultural perspective, people are natu-\nrally in relationship with their physical environment, a divine\nrealm, as well as with other people--in a unity:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The ACBR investigator should feel himself or herself\nas part of the environment (cosmos) and engaging\nwith it in the production of knowledge. Can the\nresearcher share in this cosmic feeling?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The research participants (anthropos) are teachers and\nco-learners. They are co-researchers. Hence the self-\nish or individualistic \"I\" seeking knowledge, in \"my\nname\" as sole researcher, must give way for relation-\nship with others. Can the researcher admit the rural\nparticipants as fellow researchers?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Then, there is the question of accepting that there is\na non-physical reality (theos or transcendent)\nbeyond the human and physical world. For exam-\nple, there is currently a pervasive religiosity across\nthe African continent in a way that is not evident in\nthe West. To quote Mbiti's popular statement,\n\"Africans are notoriously religious\" (Mbiti, 1969,\nApplying ACBR becomes a relational, ecological, and\ntranscendent approach to life in general, not just as a research\nparadigm or methodology. The sense of the transcendent, as\nwith the natural environment and other people, is also a rela-\ntionship rather than a metaphysical discourse. The researcher\nshould feel and acknowledge himself or herself in such a\ntriune relationship. Only with such "
