Bullying others and being bullied were con-\nsistently related to each violence-related behavior for both\nboys and girls. Greater odds of involvement occurred with\nbullying others than being bullied, and greater odds of\ninvolvement occurred with bullying that took place away\nfrom school than that occurring in school. For example,\nthe adjusted odds ratio for weapon carrying associated\nwith being bullied in school weekly was 1.5, for bully-\ning others in school 2.6, for being bullied away from school\n4.1, and for bullying others away from school 5.9.\nConclusion: Bullying should not be considered a nor-\nmative aspect of youth development, but rather a marker\nfor more serious violent behaviors, including weapon car-\nrying, frequent fighting, and fighting-related injury.\nis of national concern.\nWhile encouraging de-\nclines in violent crimes\nhave been observed over\nthe last decade, rates of aggravated as-\nsault and self-reports of nonlethal\nviolence remain high.1\nThe US government and national or-\nganizations, such as the American Medi-\ncal Association, have recently sponsored\nresearch and programmatic efforts to-\nward violence prevention.1,2-5 Successful\npolicies and programs to reduce violence\nmay need to target an overall reduction in\naggressive behavior. One form of aggres-\nsion that merits concern is bullying. Al-\nreport being involved in bullying--as\nbully, target, or both.6 By definition, an act\nof bullying involves an intention-to-\nharm and a power differential between the\nbully and target. This power differential\nseparates bullying from reciprocal aggres-\nsive acts.7 The abusive nature of bully-\ning, indicating a lack of regard for others,\nmay be an important risk factor for the per-\npetration of more serious violent behav-\nior. Little research has addressed this is-\nsue. Youth who bullied were found in one\nstudy to be more likely to bring weapons\nto school,8 and in a study of incarcerated\npersons, to be more likely to be current\nor former gang members.9 Being bullied\nby others or being perceived as vulner-\nable has been found to be associated with\nweapon carrying and violent behav-\nior.10-15 For example, in an investigation\nof school-associated violent deaths,16 re-\nsearchers found that homicide perpetra-\ntors were more than twice as likely as ho-\nmicide victims to have been bullied by\npeers.\nYouth Risk Behavior Surveillance sur-\nmale subjects grades 9 through 12 reported\ncarrying a weapon in the past 30 days.

While some fighting among adolescent\nyouth is normative, frequent fighting is associated with\nmore adverse outcomes,18-21 and injury from a fight may\nrepresent fighting to a more violent degree. Weapon car-\nrying is particularly concerning, as it may indicate a will-\ningness or intention-to-harm another or a fear for one's\nown safety.\nThis study determined the extent to which bully-\ning and being bullied are associated with violence-\nrelated behavior. The following 4 violence-related be-\nhaviors were selected for inclusion in this study: weapon\ncarrying, weapon carrying at school, frequent fighting,\nand being injured in a fight. These behaviors are be-\nlieved to be important indicators of violence because of\ntheir potential for physical harm.\nMETHODS\nThe National Institute of Child Health and Human Develop-\nment supported a nationally representative survey of youth in\nThe survey, titled Health Behaviour of School-aged Children\n(HBSC), was part of a collaborative, cross-national research\nproject involving 30 countries in coordination with the World\nHealth Organization.22 This analysis uses the US sample only.\nThe HBSC protocol required that countries ask identical ques-\ntions with the same response options based on measures that\nhad been validated in prior research protocols, pretests, or both\nin multiple countries. The United States added questions such\nas race or ethnicity, as required for federal surveys, or to ex-\npand on required topical questions, such as bullying. Most ques-\ntions provided precoded response options with some limited\nwritten descriptions that were later coded according to HBSC\nprotocols. Survey instruments were anonymous self-admin-\nistered questionnaires completed by students during 1 class pe-\nriod. The US survey was approved by the National Institute of\nChild Health and Human Development institutional review\nboard and was carried out by Macro International Inc, Calver-\nton, Md. Active parental and student consent was solicited.\nThe sampling universe consisted of a comprehensive list\nof US public, catholic, and other private school students in grades\n6 through 10 or their equivalent, excluding schools with en-\nrollment of fewer than 14 students. Primary sampling units were\ndetermined to produce nationally representative estimates for\neach grade, with schools selected according to predetermined\nschool size requirements. Classes were then selected, using\nsimple random sampling, from a suitable frame of classes that\nrepresented the target grade in a selected school. All students\nin a selected class were asked to participate in the study. Be-\ncause of documented hesitance of schools to participate in sur-\nveys taking student class time, expected rejections to requests\nfor participation, and sampling requirements that no replace-\nment schools be used for those rejecting participation, far more\nschools were drawn into the sampling frame than needed to\nobtain the precision required for a nationally representative\nweighted sample to produce 95% confidence estimates of plus\nor minus 3% for students at each grade. Schools with minority\nstudents were oversampled to provide reliable estimates for\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics, with weighting adjusted to\nnational estimates of the US school enrollment.\nSeventeen thousand students responded, resulting in a par-\nticipation rate of 83% of enrolled students. If records were miss-\ning for key variables (eg, age or sex) or had more than 75% of\nquestion responses missing, the records were excluded accord-\ning to HBSC protocol requirements (n=835). The school-\nbased sample design, using 1 class period for completion of\nthe questionnaire, precluded the ability to compare respon-\ndent characteristics with nonparticipants. Responding stu-\ndents in sampled classes were excluded if they were out of the\ntarget range for grade or their age was outside of the 99th per-\ncentile for grade (n=440 students), or if either grade or age\nwere unknown (n=39 students) and national weights ad-\njusted accordingly. The resulting analytic sample was 15686\nstudents in grades 6 through 10.\nMEASURES\nMeasures for this study were obtained from the HBSC self-\nreport questionnaire containing 102 questions about health be-\nhavior, demographics, and other relevant variables. Items were\nbased on both theoretical hypotheses related to the social con-\ntext of adolescents and measurements that had been validated\nin other studies or previous World Health Organization HBSC\nsurveys.22 All measures were pretested.\nBullying\nQuestions about bullying were preceded with the following ex-\nHere are some questions about bullying. We say a student is\nBEING BULLIED when another student, or a group of stu-\ndents, say or do nasty and unpleasant things to him or her. It\nis also bullying when a student is teased repeatedly in a way\nhe or she doesn't like. But it is NOT BULLYING when 2 stu-\ndents of about the same strength quarrel or fight.22(p9)\nParticipation in bullying was assessed by 2 parallel\nquestions that asked respondents to report the fre-\nquency with which they have bullied others in school and\naway from school during the current term. Similarly, being\nbullied was assessed by 2 parallel questions asking re-\nspondents to report the frequency with which they have\nbeen bullied in school and away from school during the\ncurrent term. Response categories were \"I haven't . . . ,\"\n\"once or twice,\" \"sometimes,\" \"about once a week,\" and\n\"several times a week.\" After examining the response dis-\ntribution, subjects reporting once a week and those re-\nporting several times a week were collapsed into 1 cat-\negory representing once a week or more.\nWeapon Carrying\nParticipants were asked on how many days they had carried a\nweapon, such as a gun, knife, or club, for self-defense in the\nlast 30 days. They also reported how many days they had car-\nried a weapon for self-defense on school property in the last\n30 days. Responses for each item were dichotomized to indi-\ncate no weapon carrying vs having carried a weapon in the last\nFrequent Fighting\nParticipants were asked to report the number of physical fights\nthey had been involved in during the past year. A cutoff point\nof 4 or more fights was defined as frequent fighting.\nFighting Injuries\nParticipants were also asked to report the frequency with which\nthey were injured in a physical fight and had to be treated by a\n\u00a92003 American Medical Association.

Responses were dichoto-\nmized to indicate no injury from fighting vs 1 or more injuries\nfrom fighting in the past year.\nStatistical sample weights were developed to adjust for the mi-\nnority oversampling and to obtain student totals by grade com-\nparable to population grade estimates from the US National Cen-\nter for Education Statistics. Weighted data analyses were\nconducted using SUDAAN software to adjust variance esti-\nmates to account for the sample design and clustering.24\nDescriptive analyses were conducted to obtain the per-\ncent distributions by sex for each violence-related behavior (ie,\nweapon carrying, weapon carrying at school, frequent fight-\ning, and being injured in a fight) by involvement in bullying\nbehaviors. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate\nodds ratios for each violence-related behavior. Separate mod-\nels were run for each bullying behavior with sex. However, the\nsame students may be involved in more than 1 of 4 bullying\nbehaviors assessed--for example, bullying others both in and\naway from school, or being both a bully and a target. To assess\nthe independent effect of each type of bullying behavior as well\nas the additive effect of involvement in multiple bullying be-\nhaviors, multivariate logistic regressions were run with the 4\nbullying measures and sex as independent variables.\nRESULTS\nAs given in Table 1, involvement in each of the violence-\nrelated behaviors was more common in boys than in girls,\nThese numbers provide national prevalence estimates of\nmore than 2.7 million students who have carried a weapon\nin the last 30 days; more than 1.8 million students who\nhave carried a weapon to school in the last 30 days; more\nthan 1.7 million students who have been in 4 or more\nphysical fights in the past year; and more than 2.9 mil-\nlion students who have been injured in a physical fight\nin the past year. Being bullied in school was reported by\nsignificantly more students then being bullied away from\nschool. Being bullied in school either sometimes or weekly\nwas reported by 16% of boys and 11% of girls, while being\nbullied away from school to this degree was reported by\n9% of boys and 5% of girls. Bullying others in school was\nreported by significantly more students than bullying oth-\ners away from school. Moderate (sometimes) or fre-\nquent (weekly) bullying of others in school was re-\nported by 23% of boys and 11% of girls, and away from\nschool by 14% of boys and 7% of girls.\nBullying or being bullied, whether in or away from\nschool, was consistently related to each of the 4\nviolence-related behaviors (Table 2). The highest risk\nfor weapon carrying was associated with bullying others\nin or away from school and being bullied away from\ninvolved in bullying away from school weekly reporting\ncarrying a weapon in the past month. About 50% of\nboys and 30% of girls who had bullied others in school\nweekly reported weapon carrying compared with 36%\nof boys and 15% of girls who had been bullied in school\nweekly. Sex differences were observed for the fighting\nindicators. For boys, frequent fighting and being injured\nin a fight were most strongly associated with bullying\nothers (both in and away from school) and being bullied\naway from school; for girls, they were most strongly\nassociated with bullying others (both in school and\naway from school).\nResults from the logistic regression analyses indi-\ncate consistent patterns of results across the violence-\nrelated behaviors (Table 3). Involvement in bullying,\nboth for bullies and targets, was associated with greater\nodds of weapon carrying, fighting, and injury from fight-\ning. These relationships were strongest for weapon car-\nrying but were notable for fighting and fighting injuries\nas well. Weapon carrying and injury from a fight were\nmost strongly associated with involvement in bullying\nthat occurred away from school, whether as bully or tar-\nget. Bullying others, regardless of location, was most as-\nsociated with frequent fighting. In the multivariate\nmodel, the relationships between bullying behaviors and\nviolence-related behaviors remained consistent, al-\nthough the magnitude of the odds ratios decreased ow-\ning to correlation among bullying behaviors. By multi-\nplying the odds ratios for given behaviors, it is possible to\ndetermine the association of each violence-related be-\nhavior with multiple bullying behaviors.25 For example,\nyouth who are bullied both in and away from school\nsometimes would have 2.7 times greater odds of carrying\na weapon while youth who are bullied sometimes in and\naway from school and who also bully others away from\nschool weekly would have 15.9 times greater odds of car-\nrying a weapon.\nTable 1.

This suggests that bullying is likely to occur\nconcurrently with more serious aggressive behavior, and\nwhile prevalent, should not be considered a normative\naspect of youth development.\nSeveral highly publicized incidents in which youth\nwho were bullied later committed violent acts have raised\nthe question as to what extent being bullied is associ-\nated with violent behavior. Findings from this study in-\ndicate that there are consistent relations between bully-\ning and violent behavior. However, the association is\nstrongest not for the targets for bullying, but rather for\nthe bullies themselves. In addition, the magnitude of the\nassociation is related to the context in which the bully-\ning occurs, with stronger associations for bullying that\noccurs away from school. Bullying that occurs away from\nschool, where there is less adult supervision and less pro-\ntection for youth, may be more likely to escalate into more\nsevere violent behavior. This pattern was also observed\nfor weapon carrying that occurred in school. That is, bul-\nlying that occurred away from school was more highly\nassociated with weapon carrying in school than bully-\ning that occurred in school. As such, efforts to reduce\nviolence in the school may need to address aggression\nand violence in the youth's larger community context.\nFindings from this study suggest that programs de-\nsigned to reduce violent behaviors should address less\nsevere forms of aggressive behavior, particularly bully-\ning. Bullying, as a behavior that is by definition inflicted\nwith the desire to harm another, seems to be an impor-\ntant marker for violence-related behaviors. Moreover, vio-\nTable 2.

As such, more in-depth information on bullying\nor violent behaviors is unavailable. Data are cross-sec-\ntional, and so findings can only provide information\nabout associations among variables rather than indicat-\ning causal pathways. Another limitation of this study is\nthe reliance on self-report for measurement of bullying\nand violent behaviors. However, self-report is a com-\nmon and accepted method of measuring these behav-\niors, and estimates of the prevalence of violent behav-\niors, such as weapon carrying, are similar to that\nobtained in other national surveys.17 Other sources for\nnational estimates of bullying behavior are unavailable\nfor comparison. Understanding that individual's per-\nceptions of bullying may vary, students were provided\nwith a detailed definition of bullying along with ex-\namples. Finally, as is typical of school-based self-report\nmeasures (eg, Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance sur-\nvey17 or Monitoring the Future27), only those students\nin attendance at school in mainstream classes were\nmeasured, and because students may choose not to an-\nTable 3.

To date,\nwe are unaware of another study specifically addressing\nthe relationship of bullying to violence-related behav-\niors. Results from this study indicate that both bullying\nand being bullied are associated with higher rates of\nweapon carrying, fighting, and fighting injuries. Based\non estimates from this study, approximately 2.7 million\nstudents have carried a weapon in the last 30 days, with\nmore than 1.8 million carrying a weapon to school. More\nthan 1.7 million students are frequent fighters, and more\nthan 2.9 million have been injured in a fight in the past\nyear. Most youth are concurrently involved in moderate\nor frequent bullying, as bully and/or target, and the rates\nof violence consistently increase with increased fre-\nquency of bullying. These findings provide a basis for fu-\nture research and violence prevention efforts.\nCorresponding author and reprints: Tonja R.
