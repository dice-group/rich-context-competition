In this study, we aimed to determine whether the\nrecently noted sex disparity in midlife stroke prevalence was\na new phenomenon. If indeed new, we intended to explore\npotential reasons for this recent rise in women's stroke\nprevalence by determining: (1) independent predictors of\nstroke; and (2) temporal trends in vascular risk factors, key\nphysical and laboratory measurements, and medication use.\nMethods\nOverall Design and Study Population\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)\nare cross-sectional samples of the US civilian noninstitutionalized\npopulation conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics.\n3 phases, respectively, were combined following National Center for\nHealth Statistics recommendations.2,3 The National Center for\nHealth Statistics Institutional Review Board approved all protocols\nfor conduct and informed consent was obtained from all partici-\npants.4,5 The sampling plan followed a complex, stratified, multi-\nstage, probability cluster design with oversampling of non-Hispanic\nblacks, Mexican Americans, and the elderly to enhance the precision\nof prevalence estimates in those groups.\nInterviews collected demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and\nhealth-related information. Mobile examinations consisted of medi-\ncal and dental examinations, physiological measurements, and lab-\noratory tests. Details of the survey design and examination proce-\ndures have been previously published.4,5\nThe respective participation rates for the questionnaire and exam-\nyears who answered the question regarding prior physician diagnosis\nPrimary Predictor Variable\nStroke history was determined by self-reported history of a physician\ndiagnosis of stroke.\nCovariates\nCovariates included cardiovascular, hematologic, lifestyle, and so-\nciodemographic variables known to be associated with stroke.\nFrom the Department of Neurology (A.T., L.Z.), University of Southern California, Los Angeles, Calif; and the Department of Neurology (B.O.),\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, Calif.\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nCategorical variables included sex, age, race/ethnicity, hypertension,\ndiabetes mellitus, history of smoking, history of myocardial infarc-\ntion, current atrial fibrillation, hypercholesterolemia, elevated low-\ndensity lipoprotein (LDL) level, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-\ndensity lipoprotein (HDL) level, abdominal obesity, obesity, history\nof cocaine use, history of oral contraceptive pill use, history of\nhormone replacement therapy, elevated homocysteine level, and\nmetabolic syndrome. Continuous covariates included waist circum-\nference, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, diastolic\nblood pressure, and levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,\ntriglyceride, HDL cholesterol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-\nstimulating hormone, glycosylated hemoglobin, and homocysteine.\nInformation on age, sex, race/ethnicity (categorized as non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other), medical\nhistory, and medication use was determined by self-report. Smoking\nwas defined by self-reported history of smoking 100 cigarettes.\nHistory of myocardial infarction was defined by self-reported phy-\nsician diagnosis. Current atrial fibrillation was defined by detection\nof an \"irregular pulse\" on examination. Hypercholesterolemia was\ndefined by a self-reported physician diagnosis, self-reported current\nmedical therapy, or total cholesterol level 200 mg/dL. Elevated\nLDL was defined as LDL level 100 mg/dL. BMI was calculated\nfrom height and weight (kg/m2) measured using standardized exam-\nination protocols. Overweight was defined as BMI 25 to 29.9 kg/m2,\nwas defined as BMI 35 kg/m2. Elevated homocysteine was defined\nas homocysteine level 8.5 mol/L. Metabolic syndrome was\ndefined by the presence of 3 factors: (1) abdominal obesity (waist\ncircumference 88 cm); (2) hypertriglyceridemia (150 mg/dL or\nuse of fibrates or niacin); (3) low HDL (50 mg/dL or use of fibrates\nor niacin); (4) hypertension (mean of first 3 blood pressure readings\n130/85 mm Hg, a self-reported physician diagnosis, or self-\nreported current medical therapy); and (5) insulin resistance (self-\nreported physician diagnosis, self-reported current medical therapy\n[insulin or oral agents], or glycosylated hemoglobin level 6.0%).\nThis definition differs from the modified Adult Treatment Panel III\ndefinition with respect to insulin resistance classification.6 Our sample\nhad a large number of missing fasting serum samples precluding use of\nfasting glucose; therefore, we used glycosylated hemoglobin, a better\nindex of overall glycemic exposure and risk for long-term complications\nthan fasting glucose levels.7 Currently, the recommended glycosylated\nhemoglobin cut point for a diabetes mellitus diagnosis is a level\nconsidered at high risk for developing diabetes mellitus and have been\nfound to have evidence of end-organ damage7; therefore, a cutoff of\n6.0% was chosen for insulin resistance.\nMultivariable Models\nTests based on the correlation matrix were conducted to rule out\ncollinearity before running the multivariable logistic regression analysis.\nThe following variables were excluded from the model due to the large\nnumber of missing variables: LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, homocysteine,\nluteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels. Subjects who\nidentified their race as \"other\" were excluded because none had strokes.\nStatistical Analysis\nSample weights and the stratification and clustering of the design\nwere incorporated into our analyses to get proper estimates and SEs\nof estimates.2,3 Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression anal-\nyses were performed to evaluate predictors of whether the person had\nexperienced a stroke. The primary reported statistics are the esti-\nmated ORs. All data analyses were conducted using SAS (Version\n9.1; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Statistical hypotheses were tested\nusing P0.05 as the level of significance.\nResults\nThe demographics of the study populations were similar in\nthe 2 NHANES waves (Table 1). Table 2 shows age- and\nsex-specific stroke prevalence. During NHANES 1988 to\n1994, there were no sex differences in stroke prevalence\nlence across NHANES waves revealed that women aged 35\nto 44 years in the latter NHANES wave were 3 times as\nlikely as women in the previous wave to report a previous\nto 54 were more than twice as likely as those in the previous\nP0.062). Among men, however, there was no significant\ndifference in stroke prevalence for each age group.\nrevealed that among 35 to 54 year olds, there was no midlife sex\ntwice as likely as men to report prevalent stroke (1.8% [SE 0.3]\nThe tripling of stroke prevalence among women aged 35 to 54\nprevalence rates among similarly aged men, thus accounted for the\nobserved sex disparity in midlife stroke prevalence.\nComparison of vascular risk factors across NHANES waves\nrevealed that women aged 35 to 54 years in the more recent\nwave were more likely to have hypertension (37.43% versus\nmore likely to take medications for hypertension (14.8% versus\nTable 1.

Although the prevalence of meta-\nbolic syndrome did not change, women in the more recent\nstudy were more likely to have 3 components of metabolic\nsyndrome (abdominal obesity, hypertension, and hypertri-\nglyceridemia; Table 3).\nNumerous factors increased the odds of previous stroke on\nbivariate analysis (Supplemental Table I; available at http://\nstroke.ahajournals.org).

Women aged 35\nto 54 years are now almost twice as likely to report having had\na stroke compared with men. Whether comparing women across\nepochs or with their similarly aged male counterparts, it certainly\nappears that the previously reported recent surge in nationwide\nstroke prevalence rates among women in this age group is\nindeed a new phenomenon.1\nWomen aged 35 to 54 years are more likely to be obese and\nmorbidly obese than in the previous decade. Not surprisingly,\nkey components of the metabolic syndrome (abdominal\nobesity, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia) have be-\ncome more prevalent among women aged 35 to 54 years.\nBlood pressure levels and lipid profiles were better among\nwomen who participated in the most recent NHANES wave,\nperhaps as a result of increased use of antihypertensive and\nlipid-lowering medications. On the other hand, the lack of any\nchanges in use of medications for diabetes mellitus, in the setting\nof an increase in abdominal and general obesity, was associated\nwith higher glycosylated hemoglobin levels. In addition, women\nin the most recent NHANES wave had higher luteinizing\nhormone levels, perhaps due to the increase in obesity, which is\nassociated with polycystic ovary syndrome.8 The improved\nhomocysteine levels may be a consequence of folic acid fortifica-\ntion of enriched grain products, which became mandatory in 1998.\nAlthough several vascular risk factors were independently\nassociated with prevalent stroke among women aged 35 to 54\nwaist circumference was the only risk factor independently\nassociated with prevalent stroke among midlife women who\nsupport to our hypothesis that the increase in stroke preva-\nlence among women aged 35 to 54 years may be related to\nworsening national obesity rates differentially and adversely\naffecting women at midlife.1 Of course, one cannot make\nAge Group, Years No.\nPrevalence, % (SE%) No.\nPrevalence, % (SE%) P\nWomen\nMen\nAge Group, Years No.\nStroke Prevalence\nAmong Men, % (SE%) No.\nStroke Prevalence\nAmong Women, % (SE%) P\nTowfighi et al Stroke Among Middle-Aged Women in the United States 1373\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\ncausal associations in a cross-sectional study and future\nprospective studies are necessary.\nThis study has several limitations. First, NHANES relies\non self-report of medical history, including history of stroke.\nAlthough NHANES has not validated self-reporting of stroke,\nprevious studies have shown a sensitivity ranging from 80%\nthough enhanced media attention and stroke education may\nhave resulted in more women than men reporting strokes, we\nare unaware of such a recent sex disparity in stroke reporting.\nSecond, because NHANES does not assess incidence, it is not\npossible to determine if the changes in prevalence were due to\nchanges in incidence or survival. However, data from the US\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER\n(Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research)\ndifferences in stroke mortality in individuals younger than age\n45 years, suggesting that the differences observed in prevalence\nwere due to changes in incidence.11 Supporting this theory, the\nGreater Cincinnati\u00adNorthern Kentucky Stroke Study found\nthat at age 35 years, women had higher stroke incidence\nthan men.12 Third, a substantial proportion of stroke survivors\nmay have severe disabilities necessitating nursing home place-\nment, thus precluding their participation in NHANES.13 How-\never, it is unlikely that there were significant differences in the\nnumbers of individuals discharged to long-term care after\nTable 3.

In addition, women are more\nlikely than men to be discharged to nursing homes and long-term\ncare14; therefore, women with stroke are less likely to be\ncaptured by NHANES. Fourth, the prevalence of stroke in this\nage group was low, limiting the precision of estimates. Fifth, this\nstudy was cross-sectional; because both risk factors and preva-\nlent stroke were assessed simultaneously, it is not possible to\nascertain whether the risk factors preceded the stroke. Sixth,\nNHANES does not classify ischemic stroke subtype or differ-\nentiate hemorrhagic from ischemic strokes. Given the higher\nprevalence of atrial fibrillation among women aged 35 to 54\nyears in the most recent NHANES wave, stroke subtype classi-\nfication would have been helpful. Although ischemic stroke,\nintracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage have\ndifferent risk factors, most strokes are presumably ischemic\ngiven the epidemiological breakdown of strokes. Finally, there\nwere a large number of missing data for certain variables (such\nas LDL cholesterol, homocysteine, follicle-stimulating hormone,\nluteinizing hormone, triglyceride level, and hormone replace-\nment therapy). Nevertheless, a strength of the study is the\ninclusion of a multitude of covariates (incorporating medical\nhistory, biomarkers, and medication use) and rigorous standard-\nized biomarker assessment by trained staff within NHANES.\nThis study has several implications. First, it challenges the\ntraditional thinking that men aged 35 to 54 years have a similar\nor higher stroke prevalence compared with their female coun-\nterparts. Although there are limited data on sex- and age-specific\nstroke prevalence rates, the REGARDS (REasons for Geo-\ngraphic And Racial Differences in Stroke) study,15 which is not\nnationally representative, found that fewer women than men\ncorroborates other studies revealing a concerning trend of\nincreasing prevalence of obesity among adults, including midlife\nwomen.16 Finally, it shows that despite improvements in vascu-\nlar risk factor control, stroke prevalence has increased in midlife\nwomen. Perhaps a key to curbing this trend is to focus on\nmitigating the growing obesity epidemic. Nationally representa-\ntive longitudinal studies are warranted to determine if the\napparent increase in stroke prevalence among women aged 35 to\n54 years is due to an increase in incident strokes among young\nand middle-aged women.\nDisclosures\nNone.\nReferences\n1.
