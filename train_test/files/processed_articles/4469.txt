In this paper we describe several challenges to\nimplementing this study, including: (1) the application of a novel diabetes risk score\nderived from genetic epidemiology studies to a clinical population, (2) the use of\nthe principle of Mendelian randomization to efficiently exclude `average' diabetes\ngenetic risk patients from the intervention, and (3) the development of a diabetes\ngenetic risk counseling intervention that maintained the ethical need to motivate\nbehavior change in both `higher' and `lower' diabetes genetic risk result recipients.\nResults Diabetes genetic risk scores were developed by aggregating the results of\n36 diabetes-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. Relative risk for type 2\ndiabetes was calculated using Framingham Offspring Study outcomes, grouped by\nquartiles into `higher', `average' (middle two quartiles) and `lower' genetic risk.\nFrom these relative risks, revised absolute risks were estimated using the overall\nabsolute risk for the study group. For study efficiency, we excluded all patients\nreceiving 'average' diabetes risk results from the subsequent intervention. This post-\nrandomization allocation strategy was justified because genotype represents a\nrandom allocation of parental alleles (`Mendelian randomization'). Finally, because\nit would be unethical to discourage participants to participate in diabetes\nprevention behaviors, we designed our two diabetes genetic risk counseling\ninterventions (for `higher' and `lower' result recipients) so that both groups would\nbe motivated despite receiving opposing results.\naDivision of General Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA, bHarvard Medical School, Boston, MA,\nUSA, cCenter for Human Genetic Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA, dDiabetes Center,\nMassachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA, eThe Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute,\nCambridge, MA, USA, fMongan Institute for Health Policy, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA,\ngDepartments of Neurology, Medicine, and Epidemiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA,\nhPartner's Center for Human Genetics, Boston, MA, USA\nAuthor for correspondence: Richard W.

If effective, longer term\nstudies with larger sample sizes will be needed to assess whether knowledge of\ndiabetes genetic risk can help patients prevent diabetes.\nConclusions We designed a randomized clinical trial designed to explore the\nmotivational impact of disclosing both higher than average and lower than average\ngenetic risk for type 2 diabetes. This design allowed exploration of both increased\nrisk and false reassurance, and has implications for future studies in translational\nIntroduction\nThe contribution of heritable factors to the devel-\nopment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been estimated\nto be as high as 40% [1]. With continuing advances\nin `next-generation' genetic sequencing technolo-\ngies, increased ability to identify rare risk loci, and\nthe identification of alternative heritable factors\n(such as copy number variation, epigenetic marks),\nwe are now poised on the threshold of applying\npersonalized genetic risk information to the clinical\nmanagement of diabetes [2,3]. Given the increased\ncosts, uncertain efficacy, and potential for adverse\nimpact of such testing, randomized clinical trials\nare needed for rigorous evaluation of the impact of\napplied genetic testing on patient behavior and on\nclinical management [4\u00ad6].\nOne potential role for diabetes genetic testing\nmay be to motivate patients to adopt healthy\nbehaviors to prevent T2D [7]. Lifestyle modification\n(such as increased exercise and sustained dietary\nchanges to achieve >7% weight loss) has been\nconclusively demonstrated in several studies to\nsignificantly reduce T2D incidence among patients\nat increased phenotypic risk [8\u00ad10]. However,\ntranslation of these results into clinical practice\nhas been limited by difficulty in motivating\npatients to adopt and sustain the behavioral\nchanges necessary to prevent diabetes [11,12].\nRecent advances in genetic epidemiology have\nnow identified over three dozen loci associated\nwith increased T2D risk [13]. It is not known\nwhether communicating personal diabetes genetic\nrisk information can be used in clinical practice to\nincrease and sustain patient motivation effectively.\nConversely, genetic risk assessment of phenotypi-\ncally at-risk patients raises the paradox that testing\noften identifies individuals at relatively low genetic\nrisk [14]. Such `lower' genetic risk information\ncould inappropriately reassure individuals who\nwould clearly benefit from lifestyle changes based\non phenotype.\nWe designed a randomized clinical trial--The\n \n --to evaluate the\nimpact of T2D genetic counseling on behavior\nchange among patients who are aware that they are\nat increased phenotypic risk for diabetes. Funded by\nthe National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive\nand Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), our study is specifi-\ncally designed to test two separate hypotheses in\ncomparison to individuals randomized to no\ngenetic testing: (1) individuals with `higher' diabe-\ntes genetic risk would be more motivated to sustain\nlifestyle changes; and (2) individuals with 'lower'\ndiabetes genetic risk would be less motivated to\nsustain lifestyle changes.\nIn this report, we describe important study\ndesign decisions related to: (1) implementing an\nindividualized diabetes genetic risk score, (2) creat-\ning an allocation scheme based on the novel\napplication of `Mendelian randomization' to\nexclude the majority of individuals who fall into a\nrelatively narrow `average' diabetes genetic risk\nrange, and (3) designing an ethical genetic coun-\nseling intervention to motivate participants regard-\nless of their genetic risk score.\nMethods\nPatient eligibility and recruitment\nWe enrolled patients at high risk for T2D based on\nphenotypic criteria by identifying individuals in\nour clinical network with the metabolic syndrome\n(MetS; defined as meeting at least three of five\nof the following clinical criteria: fasting glucose\nor > 40 in (men), HDL cholesterol < 50 mg/dL\n(women) or < 40 mg/dL (men), triglycerides\nor prescribed antihypertensive medication) [15].\nPatients in this source population were predomi-\n(\u00c614) years, and evenly divided between men and\nwomen. National data indicate that patients with\nMetS have a 3- to almost 30-fold increased diabetes\nincidence compared to similar patients without\nMetS [16,17]. MetS has similar sensitivity (but lower\nspecificity) than the more burdensome oral glucose\ntolerance test [18] for identifying individuals at risk\nfor T2D and has the distinct advantages of using\nreadily available clinical measures and of identify-\ning a larger at-risk patient population (47 million in\nthe US with MetS [19]), making this approach more\nreadily applicable to the `real world' setting.\nPotentially eligible study participants were iden-\ntified initially through automated medical record\nreview using a previously validated algorithm that\nhad 73% sensitivity and 91% specificity for identi-\nfying patients with MetS [20]. Eligibility of poten-\ntial participants was then verified using a manual\nmedical record review and, with permission from\nthe patient's primary care provider, confirmed via a\nbrief telephone screen.\nStudy schema--Phase 1\nOur protocol was implemented in two phases\n(Figure 1). In Phase 1, we enrolled and consented\neligible participants to the GC/LC Study. At this\nfirst visit, all participants completed baseline sur-\nveys to assess baseline diabetes risk perception and\ncurrent motivation to change diabetes-related\nhealth behaviors. After survey completion, partic-\nipants were randomized in a 4:1 ratio to diabetes\ngenetic risk testing vs no testing. The larger\nproportion of participants allocated to genetic\ntesting was necessary in order to identify sufficient\nnumbers of patients in the top and bottom risk\nquartiles (`higher' and `lower' diabetes genetic\nrisk) for the more resource-intensive Phase 2.\nParticipants found to have `average' diabetes\ngenetic risk results after genotyping were excluded\nfrom Phase 2. These individuals received their\ndiabetes genetic test results directly from the\nprincipal investigator and were advised to follow\nup with their primary care physicians to address\nmodifiable risk factors.\nStudy schema--Phase 2\nParticipants allocated to Phase 2 included the\n`higher' and `lower' diabetes genetic risk result\nrecipients (intervention patients) and the\nuntested controls. These patients returned for a\nsecond research visit once genotyping was com-\npleted (3\u00ad4 weeks after first research visit). At this\nvisit, intervention patients received their diabetes\ngenetic risk results and underwent a 15-min\nindividual diabetes genetic risk counseling ses-\nsion. After the counseling session, intervention\npatients completed the repeat survey and were\nscheduled for the 12-week diabetes prevention\ncourse. Control patients attending the second\nresearch visit completed the repeat survey and\nwere scheduled for the 12-week prevention\ncourse. In the weeks following completion of\nthe curriculum, participants returned for their\nthird and final research visit and completed the\nthird survey. Thus, apart from the diabetes\ngenetic risk counseling session, intervention and\ncontrol patients in Phase 2 received identical\nexposure to diabetes risk education and to study\nstaff over the approximately 4 months of their\nstudy participation.\nCreating a diabetes genetic risk score\nFor the GC/LC Study we used 36 validated single\nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) independently\nassociated with T2D [13]. At each locus, an\nFigure 1 Study schema: Phase 1 (2-stage randomization) and Phase 2 (12-week diabetes prevention curriculum)\nDesign of a randomized trial of diabetes genetic risk testing to motivate behavior change 611\nindividual can have 0, 1, or 2 risk-associated alleles.\nWe created a single diabetes genotype risk score by\nsumming up the total number of risk alleles (range\n0\u00ad72). Prior research has shown that for risk\nranking simple summing provides substantially\nsimilar results as various approaches that weight\nindividual alleles according to effect size [21].\nTo calculate each participant's diabetes genetic\nrisk status, we first determined relative diabetes\ngenetic risks based on the Framingham Offspring\nStudy. This longitudinal cohort with biennial\nresearch visits represents a well-phenotyped popu-\nlation similar to the patients in our clinical network\n[13,22]. After excluding patients with diabetes at\nbaseline, there were 3471 genotyped individuals in\nthe Framingham Offspring Study who were fol-\ncases of diabetes were diagnosed [13]. Among\npatients with genotype risk scores > 38 (`higher'\nincrease compared to `average' risk, scores 34\u00ad38).\nAmong patients with genotype risk scores < 34\n(``lower'' risk), 9.9% developed diabetes (18% rela-\ntive decrease compared to `average' risk patients).\nThe `higher' and `lower' groups each comprised\napproximately 25% of the genotyped population\n(Table 1). These results were unchanged when the\nanalysis was restricted to participants meeting\nFor the GC/LC Study, we provided our study\nparticipants with an overall estimate of their risk\nfor developing diabetes that combined their known\nphenotypic risk (based on MetS) with their mea-\nsured genetic risk (derived from the Framingham\nOffspring Study data). Phenotypic risk for our study\ncohort was determined using data from our own\nhospital primary care practices [20]. Based on an\nanalysis of 3-year diabetes incidence among\npatients with MetS, we estimated an 11% risk of\ndeveloping diabetes over the next 3 years for our\noverall study population. Applying the relative\nrisks determined using the Framingham Offspring\nStudy data (46% relative increase for the `higher'\nand 18% relative decrease for the `lower' risk\ngroups), we estimated that patients with `higher'\ngenetic risk results had a 3-year diabetes risk of 17%\nand patients with `lower' genetic risk results had a\n3-year diabetes risk of 9%.\nMendelian randomization and post-randomization\nallocation\nSince roughly 50% of genotyped individuals fall\nwithin the relatively narrow numeric range of\n`average' genetic risk, we chose a post-randomiza-\ntion allocation strategy that excluded `average'\ngenetic risk patients in order to substantially\nreduce the size and cost of Phase 2 (two further\nresearch visits and the 12-week diabetes prevention\ngroup sessions) without reducing the trial's power\nto test our two study hypotheses. The rationale for\nthis post-randomization allocation was based on\nthe concept of `Mendelian randomization.'\nIn classic clinical trial design, post-randomiza-\ntion allocation to study arm is forbidden because\nthe criteria used for allocation may introduce\nconfounding and thereby undermine the benefit\nof randomization. Mendelian randomization is a\nterm coined to describe the concept that a given\nindividual's genotype represents the random allo-\ncation of paternal and maternal alleles [23]. This\nconcept has been used to support observational\ndata analyses [24\u00ad26]. The GC/LC Study represents\none of the first examples of this concept being used\nto increase the efficiency of a randomized trial.\nSince the genetic factors (in this case, alleles\nassociated with diabetes) are not believed to be\ncausally associated with the primary study out-\ncomes (such as program attendance behavior), the\ndiabetes genotype risk score acts as an instrumental\nvariable that was assigned randomly at gametogen-\nesis. In this context, post-randomization allocation\nto study arm does not undermine the random\nallocation of risk SNPs within study arms.\nDesign of genetic counseling intervention\nThe goals of the 15-min genetic counseling session\nwere to explain the basic concept of genetic testing,\npresent participants with their diabetes genotype\nscore, and explain how their test results modified\ntheir phenotypically estimated risk. Participants\nreceived a one-page printed report that listed their\nresults for each SNP tested and their total score. The\nscore was also interpreted as conveying `higher' or\n`lower' diabetes genetic risk. This report was used as\nTable 1 Relative risk for type 2 diabetes by diabetes genotype risk score derived from the Framingham Offspring Study\nRisk category Risk score Cohort total (N) Distribution by risk category Number with T2D Percentage with T2D\nT2D, Type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nthe basis for `personalized' diabetes genetic risk\ncounseling. To graphically represent risk to the\nintervention patients, we first presented a diagram\nto illustrate the combined influence of genetic\n(non-modifiable) and environmental (modifiable)\nfactors. The added risk information generated from\nthe genetic testing results was communicated to\npatients using the visual concept of a balance scale,\nin which the individual's 3-year absolute diabetes\nrisk was either increased or decreased based on the\nadditional information provided by their diabetes\ngenetic risk assessment (for example, the scale\nabsolute risk among patients with `higher' genetic\nrisk results). The initial development of the coun-\nseling session and visual materials was piloted using\ncognitive interviews with individuals who would\nhave met eligibility criteria for the main study [27].\nA key ethical consideration in our intervention\ndevelopment was that the diabetes genetic risk\ncounseling session should be designed to avoid\ndiscouraging phenotypically and genetically high-\nrisk patients from participating in a diabetes pre-\nvention program. Thus, the genetic counseling\nintervention had to be structured so that both\n`higher' and `lower' diabetes genetic risk result\nrecipients would be motivated to make behavior\nchanges. Accordingly, `higher' diabetes risk result\ndisclosure focused on the need to adopt lifestyle\nchanges to counterbalance the increased diabetes\ngenetic risk, whereas `lower' diabetes risk result\ndisclosure emphasized the greater relative contri-\nbution of modifiable, non-genetic risk factors to\nthe individual's overall risk for diabetes. The goal\nwas to avoid discouraging `higher' diabetes risk\nrecipients who might feel a sense of genetic fatal-\nism while avoiding in `lower' diabetes genetic\nrisk recipients the sense of being protected from\ndeveloping diabetes [28].\nChoice of study outcomes\nFor rigorous assessment of the efficacy of the\ngenetic testing and counseling, all participants in\nPhase 2 were enrolled into a 12-week Group\nLifestyle Balance diabetes prevention curriculum\nmodeled after the Diabetes Prevention Program.\nThis format was developed by Seidel et al. and first\nimplemented in patients with MetS [29]. The cur-\nriculum provided educational content (such as\nidentifying healthy eating habits, planning an exer-\ncise program) and also used motivational tools\n(dietary logs, weekly weigh-ins) to initiate behavior\nchanges associated with diabetes prevention. Each\n12-week program was conducted by clinical staff\nwho were unaware of participants' genetic risk test\nresults. Although we could not blind patients to\ntheir randomization status--genetic testing or no\ntesting--we instructed the group session educators\nto request that participants did not disclose their\nresults to the group. To assess the adequacy of\nmasking, we asked the group leaders to predict\nallocation status for all group participants after\ncompletion of the 12-week curriculum.\nOur primary study outcomes were the number of\n12-week program sessions attended (behavior) and\nchanges in self-reported readiness to adopt the\nbehavioral changes recommended by the diabetes\nprevention program (motivation). Secondary out-\ncomes included objective measures of weight\nchange before and after the 12-week session and\nnumber of weekly exercise and dietary log books\nturned in during the 12-week session.\nSurveys administered at the baseline and\nfollow-up research visits included: Diabetes Risk\nPerception [30], Stage of Change for a Low Fat Diet\n[31], Stage of Change for Exercise [32], and Stage of\nChange for Weight Loss [33]. The three Stage of\nChange instruments are each validated measures\ndesigned to assess motivation by classifying respon-\ndents into one of five stages (precontemplation,\ncontemplation, preparation, action, or mainte-\nnance) for each of the three behavioral domains\n(following a low-fat diet, exercising, and losing\nweight) related to diabetes prevention. For exam-\nple, the Stage of Change for Exercise instrument\nasks: `Please describe your current exercise behav-\nior,' with five choices [Currently, I do not exercise\nand I do not intend to start exercising in the next 6\nmonths; Currently, I do not exercise but I am\nthinking about starting to exercise in the next 6\nmonths; Currently, I exercise some but not regu-\nlarly; Currently, I exercise regularly but I have only\nbegun doing so within the last 6 months; and\nCurrently, I exercise regularly and have done so for\nlonger than 6 months] corresponding to the five\nstages of change.\nSample size and power calculation\n`lower' diabetes genetic risk and 30 controls) was\nplanned to allow sufficient power to demonstrate\nclinically meaningful results across both behavioral\nand self-reported outcomes of interest. Based on\nthe prior experience of our diabetes center in\ndelivering 12-week diabetes prevention courses,\nwe also accounted for a 10% loss-to-follow-up rate\nwhen calculating power. Assuming the mean\nnumber of visits among controls was 8.5 based on\nprior experience at our center (unpublished data)\nand the standard deviation was 2, the study was of\nsufficient sample size to detect a 20% difference\n(1.7 difference in number of visits between\nDesign of a randomized trial of diabetes genetic risk testing to motivate behavior change 613\ncomparison groups) with 97% power with two-\nsided probability of 0.05 or less. The change in\nmotivation for each patient was categorized as\nincreased, no change, and decreased, based on\nresponses to each of the three Stages of Change\ninstruments (low fat diet, exercise, weight loss). The\nstudy had 90% power to show a difference between\n55% positive change vs 90% positive change in\nmotivation between arms and 80% power to show a\ndifference between 60% positive change vs 90%\npositive change in motivation.\nGiven the relatively small study size, our analysis\nplan included provision to control for any differ-\nences in baseline characteristics using multivariate\nmodeling when examining outcomes by allocation\nstatus.\nDiscussion\nWe had to address both ethical and logistic design\nconsiderations when implementing a randomized\ntrial of diabetes genetic risk testing and counseling\namong patients at increased phenotypic risk for\ntype 2 diabetes.\nAlthough there are no published clinical trials\nof diabetes genetic risk testing, several prior stud-\nies have examined whether family history can\nmotivate lifestyle change. These small studies\nfocused on intermediate or surrogate endpoints\nindividuals perceive `personal' genetic risk differ-\nently to their family history [27], it was important\nto assess the impact of such testing using a rigorous\ncontrolled study design. Moreover, unlike family\nhistory, where the response is either `yes' (with\nvarying degrees of increased risk) or `no' (perceived\nas `no increased risk'), diabetes genetic risk test-\ning can return not only `increased' but also\n`decreased' risk results. For this reason, we deter-\nmined that it was necessary to assess both the\npotential benefit (improved motivation) and\npotential risk (false reassurance or genetic fatalism)\nfrom such testing.\nIn designing our study, we made the following\nimportant decisions with the goal of maximizing\nthe validity and generalizability of our results:\n1) We randomized to genetic testing vs no genetic\ntesting to capture the most relevant clinical\nquestion, which is: `Among patients willing to\nbe tested, will testing have a clinical impact?'\n2) We separately evaluated the impact of `higher'\nand `lower' diabetes genetic risk results relative\nto the untested controls to disentangle the\npotentially counteracting impact of these differ-\nent results on the overall impact of testing.\n3) We used post-randomization allocation justified\nby the concept of Mendelian randomization to\nefficiently exclude nearly 50% of tested patients\nwith `average' results from the resource-inten-\nsive Phase 2.\n4) We created a clinically implementable diabetes\nrelative risk score based on the most up-to-date\nset of genetic variants associated with type 2\ndiabetes as of July 2010. This was achieved\nby combining relative genetic risk calculated\nfrom a finely phenotyped research cohort\n(Framingham) with a phenotypic risk estima-\ntion calculated from the clinical population\nfrom which research patients were recruited.\n5) We created a genetic counseling intervention\nthat in its relative brevity and explicit commu-\nnication goals is responsive to the time demands\nand limited resources that would be expected in\nthe real world setting.\n6) We tailored our genetic counseling intervention\nso as not to undermine motivation in patients at\nhigh phenotypic risk for diabetes.\nRandomized clinical trials have convincingly\nshown that increased physical activity and dietary\nmodifications leading to sustained weight loss sig-\nnificantly reduce diabetes risk among patients with\npre-diabetes or MetS. However, successful clinical\nimplementation of these lifestyle changes has been\nlimited. Given the ongoing diabetes epidemic,\ninterventions to increase adoption of healthy life-\nstyle changes among high risk patients are urgently\nneeded. In this `dawn of the genomic era' [36,37], it\nis imperative to establish the evidence base to guide\nthe clinical application of genetic testing for\ncommon chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes\n[38] given the rise of direct-to-consumer advertising\nby commercial companies [39], the eagerness with\nwhich many clinicians embrace new technology,\nand the increased cost of additional testing. The GC/\nLC Study was designed to begin establishing this\nevidence base for future practice.\nFunding\n01. Dr Meigs received support from NIDDK\nReferences\n1.
