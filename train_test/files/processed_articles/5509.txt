A legal opinion about case law associated with bullying confirms the appropriateness of such\norganizational learning approaches to address this problem and avoid litigation. The extensive literature about defensiveness\nand organizational learning has not been previously widely considered in association with bullying behaviors. This conceptual\narticle is intended to stimulate further interest to make the link between defensiveness and bullying behaviors.\n",

It has also received considerable\nattention in organizational behaviour and human resource\nmanagement research over the past 20+ years.\nAt the root of my concern about the use of the term bullying\nis that the term is relatively superficially understood and\nbullying actions are difficult to pinpoint and examine, and\neven more difficult to address--particularly bullying con-\nducted by leaders. In this article, I focus on each of these\nconcerns. No attempt is made to deeply examine the wide\ninternational research from the perspective of psychological\nor organizational outcomes associated with the topic of bul-\nlying from authors such as Bowling and Beehr (2006),\nSheehan and Griffiths (2011), Nielsen, Matthiesen, and\nEinarsen (2010), or bullying from varied levels in the hier-\narchy (Wallace, Johnston, & Trenberth, 2010). Instead, like\nthose of Van Rooyen and McCormack (2013) and Jenkins,\nWinefield, and Sarris (2011), to some degree, this article\ndoes include an attempt to pinpoint bullying by reporting\nemployee perceptions and also considers how bullying\nbehavior emerges within the social dynamics of a workplace\nThe pinpointing of bullying occurs by viewing behaviors\nthrough a reasonably high resolution lens: a lens illuminating\nbullying as a set of defensive (i.e., control and, or, avoidance)\nstrategies and values perpetrated by leaders and managers\n(from here on, the term leader is used to encompass both\nterms). The advantage of this alternate view is the associa-\ntion with a concrete approach to objectively identify, exam-\nine, and analyze bullying behavior. The defensive lens also\nprovides ideas on how to address the behavior.\nAfter briefly defining and contextualizing bullying (par-\nticularly within the Canadian and New Zealand contexts),\ntheorizing of the defensive lens is followed by a review of\napproaches to overcome defensiveness and bullying. Specific\nnote is made of approaches that are productive and have a\nlearning organization orientation. In the theoretical section\nof the article, my role is outlined for the implementation of\norganizational learning strategies to address bullying through\nelaboration of a holistic evidence-based learning (HEBL)\nmodel.\nTwo authentic scenarios of leaders accused of bullying\nare used to illustrate the way the HEBL model has been\nadopted, particularly the use of analysis through a defensive\nlens. Both overt leader behaviors and behaviors that are more\ncovert and manipulative are revealed. Regardless of whether\novert or covert, these defensive behaviors are shown to have\nmuch the same affect regarding lowering staff morale and\nfrustration, as well as reducing individual and organizational\nperformance. Finally in this article, a legal opinion is offered\n1Royal Roads University, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nEileen Piggot-Irvine, Royal Roads University, 2005 Sooke Road, Victoria,\nBritish Columbia V9B 5Y2, Canada.\nEmail: Eileen.piggotirvine@royalroads.ca\nLeader Bullying Through a Different Lens\nEileen Piggot-Irvine1\n Keywords\nleader bullying, defensiveness, productive approach, organizational learning\n2 SAGE Open\non consideration of bullying through a defensive lens and the\nways to overcome it via organizational learning.\nDefining and Contextualizing Bullying\nIn Canada, the concepts of bullying and psychological\nharassment are often used interchangeably. Those two con-\ncepts must also be distinguished from harassment generally,\nwhich is protected under the human rights codes across the\ncountry. A useful way to understand the concepts is to locate\nthem under the larger category of workplace violence,\ndefined by the International Labour Organization and\nreferred to by the Canada Safety Council as \" . . . incidents\nwhere persons are abused, threatened or assaulted in circum-\nstances related to their work, involving an explicit or implicit\nchallenge to their safety, well-being or health\" (Hoel, Sparks,\ncaptures all forms of harassment, bullying, and physical\nviolence.\nMany definitions exist for psychological harassment and\nbullying (hereafter referred to by the single term, bullying).\nGoncalves (2007), relying on the Canadian Centre for\nOccupational Health and Safety definition, stated that bully-\ning represents an attempt by one person to assert control and\nexercise power through the humiliation or harassment of\nanother. Bullying often denotes intimidatory behavior, which\nis inappropriate and has occurred over a period often desig-\nnated as 6 months or longer. The behavior can be covert (the\nmore common and of more significant psychological affect)\nor overt according to Baron, Newman, and Geddes (1999).\nAn example of both covert and overt behaviors is evident in\nthe workplace policy about bullying and harassment in a\npublic university, which notes verbal aggression or insults,\ncalling someone derogatory names, harmful hazing or initia-\ntion practices, vandalizing personal belongings, and spread-\ning malicious rumors (Public University, 2013).\nBullying includes destructive and demeaning behaviors\nthat can be difficult to see and identify and is more prevalent\nthan other harassing behavior (e.g., sexual harassment and\nracial discrimination) proscribed by human rights codes\n(Canadian Safety Council, 2015). Furthermore, physical vio-\nlence is often reported from outside sources, such as custom-\ners, students, and patients, whereas psychological violence\nof the bullying type is more often reported from within the\norganization.\nIn Canada, bullying typically is not fully covered in the\nhuman rights codes. Recourse and remedies for bullying\nmust be obtained through employer policies and provisions\nin collective agreements. Although some provinces have leg-\nislated recourse for psychological harassment, that recourse\nis usually only available for instances of physical threats or\nacts. However, the province of Quebec has legislated protec-\ntion for psychological harassment, and a similar view exists\nin New Zealand. Wallace et al. (2010) noted that although the\nresponsibility is with the organization to ensure the safety\nand well-being of employees, employers are liable for pros-\necution if they do not take preventive measures to minimize\nworkplace stress and fatigue, or create a climate conducive\nto, or causing, stress.\nTo identify the elements that constitute bullying,\nGoncalves (2007) viewed these as behaviors that are recur-\nring and persistent, obvious or subtle, not restricted to enu-\nmerated grounds, and identified through emotional effects.\nThe damage from bullying behavior at a personal level was\nsummarized by Wallace et al. (2010) to cover loss of self-\nesteem, diminished physical and emotional health, and cog-\nnitive functioning to those bullied. Bullying also affects\nfamilies of those bullied as well as those who witness work-\nplace bullying. Furthermore, the loss to productivity to orga-\nnizations and society is profound when considering loss of\nperformance and staff turnover (Greenberg & Scott, 1996) to\nthe extent that Beswick, Gore, and Palferman (2006) esti-\nmated that bullying-related stress may cost U.K. employers\nBullying by leaders has become a predominant and\nincreasing concern (Mee Kwan, Tuckey, & Dollard, 2014;\nand leader bullying, in my consulting experience with hun-\ndreds of organizations, are considerably feared by many\nleaders themselves. Bullying, for these leaders, has fre-\nquently become associated with possible consequences for\nleaders, from reputational slurs through to formal investiga-\ntions of behavior, litigation, and potential loss of career.\nI have observed that leaders accused of bullying, and the\nchief executives (CEs) trying to resolve the accusations,\nhave felt overwhelmingly helpless about how to deal with\nsuch claims because both those accused and leaders often\nfind bullying a nebulous notion--a situation not helped by\nthe lack of research on how to deal with bullying noted by\nMikkelsen, Hogh, and Puggard (2011). Also observed, and\nnoted by Bryant, Buttigieg, and Hanley (2009), is that some-\ntimes CEs in this situation of helplessness have minimized\nthe bullying complaints and have adopted a compliance\nrather than preventive approach to dealing with bullying\nbehavior. Such minimizing is at odds with a call for manage-\nment commitment (Vartia & Leka, 2011). The minimizing is\nalso at odds with my adoption of an approach used for iden-\ntifying, analyzing, and addressing bullying, which is objec-\ntive and diagnostic, emphasizes high ownership by those\naccused of bullying, while aiming to be supportive and\ndevelopmental with an underpinning organizational learning\nstance. Central to this approach is the adoption of a view of\nbullying through a defensive lens.\nBullying Through a Defensive Lens\nDick and Dalmau (1999) summarized defensiveness as rooted\nin \" . . . adversarial and competitive . . .\" (p. 47) values. At a\ndeeper level, Argyris (2003) described that defensiveness is\nPiggot-Irvine 3\nderived from a tendency to protect ourselves and others from\npotential threat and embarrassment. Competitiveness, self-\nprotection, and protecting others are manifest in strategies\nsuch as\n. . . covering up or withholding vital information or evidence,\nbypassing threatening conversations, and being indirect by\ngiving mixed rather than clear messages. These strategies of\ndefensiveness are generally summarized under categories\nof avoidance and control (striving to win) . . . they are at the root\nof misunderstandings, distortions and misinterpretations.\nCovering up, withholding and blocking information,\nbypassing (and gatekeeping), indirectness, and providing\nmixed messages are all evident at what could be described as\na more subtle level of defensiveness in bullying cases that I\nhave experienced. Evident also have been less subtle strate-\ngies such as outright tyranny, deceit, threat, and oppression.\nWhether subtle or overt, unilateral decision-making predom-\ninates in defensive behaviors, and further unpacking reveals\navoidance and control underpinnings (Argyris, 2003; Cardno,\nUnfortunately, defensiveness among leaders prevails. As\nBifano (1989) suggested several years before workplace bul-\nlying or leader bullying were catchphrases, \"Grounded in\nover a decade of research that was conducted in all types of\nsettings . . . Argyris and Sch\u00f6n concluded that defensive\nbehaviour is the predominant . . . orientation\" (p. 60). Nothing\nsuggests that this orientation has changed--Only the termi-\nnology of bullying has changed.\nMultiple affects on staff resulting from defensiveness are\nalso linked to bullying, including poor performance, low\nmorale, burnout, and low trust. These influences resonate\nwith the findings of a large-scale survey of staff, which indi-\ncated to O'Driscoll et al. (2011) that bullying \" . . . was sig-\nnificantly correlated with higher levels of strain, reduced\nwell-being, reduced commitment to their organization, and\nlower self-rated performance\" (p. 309). The results of bully-\ning work against the creation of a learning organization if\nthese strategies prevail because they are damaging for the\nleader, their staff, the organization, clients, and society.\nApproaches to Overcoming\nDefensiveness (and Bullying)\nStrategies for overcoming defensiveness, and bullying, often\nfall under an organizational learning approach. Organizational\nlearning occurs when the source of problems can be discov-\nered and addressed (Boreham & Morgan, 2004; Senge et al.,\ntional learning is a \" . . . process of detecting and correcting\nerror. Error is for our purposes any feature of knowledge or\nknowing that inhibits learning\" (p. 116). Organizational learn-\ning leads to a learning organization in which, as Hodgkinson\n(2000) noted, there exists a \" . . . coming together of individu-\nals to enable them to support and encourage one another's\nlearning, which will in the longer term be of benefit to the\nOvercoming defensive bullying via the employment of\norganizational learning strategies first requires understanding\nof both the roots of threat and self-protection and also includes\nthe challenge of shifting such defensive strategies. Because\ndefensiveness is largely seen as a set of conditioned behaviors\nlearned and well established in early childhood years, unfortu-\nnately, such behaviors are hard to change in adulthood because\nthey are usually well rehearsed and quite deeply embedded.\nShifting a defensive bullying response\n. . . requires significant, profound, shifts involving exposure,\nexamination and alteration of defensive values at a deeply\npersonal level which is both cognitively and emotionally\ndifficult and is a lengthy process. . . . the approach on its own is\nextremely complex and usually involves months, maybe years,\nof training. The reason for this is that the approach requires\nrethinking and altering our underlying value systems, and this\ninvolves changing many automatic, conditioned responses.\nSuch values and responses cannot be changed in two hours!\nEdmondson (1996) emphasized the intensity of behavior\nand value shifting required to overcome defensiveness and\nsuggested that this involved \"profound attentiveness\" (p.\n585). Altering values and responses also needs a high degree\nof self-honesty on the part of those wanting to change (Dick\n& Dalmau, 1999). Such change is possible, and I have seen\nconsiderable alteration of defensive bullying behavior when\nleaders have been willing to learn new approaches that target\nshifting defensive values and strategies to what are often\ndescribed as productive approaches in the organizational\nEssentially, adopting productive values and strategies\ninvolves openness to sharing ideas and, equally, inquiring\ninto and receiving ideas of others. Adopting these values and\nstrategies necessitates working more collaboratively and\nconsensually in decision making because a fundamental goal\nis to understand others' views. Valuing evidence and data\nfrom all perspectives when making decisions and withhold-\ning assumptions until those data are checked by all involved\nis also important. Any prejudgment and jumping to prema-\nture conclusions are minimized in a productive approach.\nSuch an approach presupposes a need to be open to challenge\nby others without getting highly defensive in response.\nWorking with rather than over staff is important here and that\nincludes engaging them in finding their own solutions when\nconfronted with problems but doing so in a way that is sup-\nportive. Treating staff fairly and consistently is also a feature\nof a productive approach.\nIn summary, using values of honesty, openness, authenticity,\nand being non-judgmental, democratic, rigorous, and respectful\nunderpin the strategies used in such an organizational learning\n4 SAGE Open\napproach. In a previous publication, I have shown that collec-\ntively, these values and strategies (as summarized in Table 1)\ncan combine to result in higher trust between leaders and staff\nThe values and strategies outlined in Table 1 align with\ntwo of the four organizational responses identified by\nO'Driscoll et al. (2011) as those effective in addressing bul-\nlying: encouraging open and respectful communication, and\nencouraging appropriate interactions between staff.\nO'Driscoll et al. described the responses more at a level of\nunderpinning values but did not elaborate on the detail of the\nspecific strategies associated with how to be open or respect-\nful. The right-hand side of Table 1 begins this elaboration.\nThe full complexity of the specific strategies and develop-\nment protocols involved in learning to become a productive\nleader are too profound to outline in detail in this article (see\nPiggot-Irvine, 2012, for such detail). Briefly, learning a pro-\nductive approach almost always engages multiple iterative\ncycles of development to enhance skills and strategies for\nrecognizing and overcoming defensiveness and for incorpo-\nrating productive approaches such as staying low on the lad-\nder of inference, balancing inquiry and advocacy approaches\nin dialogue when working with staff, sharing rather than\nwithholding information and reasoning, and creating bilat-\neral solutions. Such learning is reinforced with continuing\nskill implementation alongside further analysis and reflec-\ntion to ensure that non-defensive practices are deployed.\nMost importantly, the learning approach outlined needs to\nbe holistic regarding extending beyond the individual leader\nto the team and organizational levels. This holistic approach\nis intentional and aligns with a philosophy that attempting to\nchange the bullying behavior of the individual leader, or\nreacting in response solely to the target (Namie & Namie,\n2003), alone is insufficient for the organization.\nIn the HEBL model developed to address bullying in a\nproductive and holistic way, there are six steps for learning.\nThe steps, outlined on the right side in Table 2, constitute an\nexpansion of an original process for overcoming defensive\nbehaviors suggested by Argyris (1990), and later elaborated\nby Argyris and Sch\u00f6n (1974). In the left column, a descriptor\nis provided for the roles the facilitator (or consultant) plays\nin these steps.\nTo elaborate the HEBL model a little further, each role\nand step is described. First, the facilitator works with senior\nexecutives in the organization to clarify the specific behav-\niors associated with what has been considered to be bullying\nby a leader. Clarification usually includes gathering specific\nfeedback from the CE and staff and summarizing the feed-\nback under the headings of leader behaviors and affects. In\nmy experience, CEs struggle to determine which behaviors\nconstitute bullying and which do not, and this first clarifica-\ntion step is critical to creating objectivity.\nThe second role played by the facilitator is somewhat akin\nto a counselor with the accused bullying leaders themselves.\nThe facilitator shares the summarized leader behaviors and\naffects with the accused, allows them time to reflect on these,\nand responds to any questions they have. The accused lead-\ners are usually dealing with extreme stress and anxiety, and\naddressing that through a range of counseling type tools is an\ninitial focus.\nOnce the stress is reduced, the third role played by the\nfacilitator is to confront the issues (note that this does not\nimply a confrontational style) by guiding the accused leaders\nto analyze their perception of the type of behavior that pre-\ndominates and understand its origins.\nThe fourth role is intimately and intensely developmental\nwhere the facilitator guides the accused to learn new, more\nproductive, non-defensive, non-bullying ways to work with\ntheir staff. The learning is heavily interspersed with contin-\nual practice, followed by analysis and self- and shared reflec-\ntion with the facilitator. The leaders are encouraged to journal\ntheir reflections throughout.\nThe fifth role played is a broader developmental one with\nall staff that often happens in tandem with the one-to-one\nwork with the accused bullying leaders. Here, the facilitator\nconducts theory-informed yet experientially based sessions\nwith teams to identify and overcome bullying behavior at all\nlevels in the organization. The sessions (1 to 2 days in length)\ncover identification of defensive bullying responses, theo-\nretical underpinnings, and approaches to overcoming defen-\nsiveness and dealing with conflict in productive ways.\nSixth, and most important, is the adoption of a role of rais-\ning awareness of the importance of senior leadership taking\na systems-wide perspective on addressing bullying. The\nfacilitator usually works to ensure that senior leaders are\naware that creating highly effective systems and structures\nwithin the entire organization is an important precursor to\nTable 1.

(2011). The model\nadopts a stepwise and systematic approach, implements mea-\nsures that fit in with the targeted problems, has a participa-\ntive approach, has the sustained commitment of top\nmanagement, attempts to build trustful relationships between\nthe organization and consultant (or researcher), and attempts\nto develop an organizational culture that is able to use con-\nstructive conflict to overcome disagreements and resistance.\nTwo scenarios of leaders accused of bullying are used to\nbriefly introduce the first two roles played and the steps in\nthis learning-oriented model. More extensive illustration and\nelaboration of the third of the roles and steps are provided.\nBackground and Scenarios\nBefore discussing the scenarios, I note that the history of my\nrelationship with the public sector organization was exten-\nsive (more than 10 years) with incremental trust establish-\nment a feature of the history. The process in which that trust\nwas developed could be the feature of another article, but\nsuffice to say that trust was based on employment of a strong\nemphasis on practicing non-defensive values and strategies\nsuch as collaboration and understanding of the organization\nculture that enabled employment interventions that were\nfully discussed with the CE and considered appropriate.\nTrust was not ostensibly limited in this context in the way\nthat it could have created an obstruction (Mikkelsen et al.,\n2011): an obstruction I have experienced in other contexts\nwhere I have not had the privilege of such a long-term\nrelationship.\nThe two middle level leaders accused of bullying behav-\nior used in the following scenarios were in what might be\ndescribed as third tier, that is, just below the CE (first tier)\nand senior leadership (second tier) levels. Each had teams of\nup to 25 staff working for them. To ensure anonymity in the\nscenarios, the sector will not be identified other than to say it\nwas a public service organization of approximately 300 staff.\nIn both scenarios (which were approximately 6 months\napart), I was called in when the CE had received consider-\nable written and verbal negative feedback from staff of each\nleader that was quickly followed by accusations of bullying.\nThe CE had struggled to distinguish whether a situation of\nbullying existed or not.\nThe earlier described first HEBL role was initially imple-\nmented with these scenarios. As facilitator, I acted as advisor\nto the CE to assist with objectively clarifying the strategies\nthat each leader was implementing. Clarification was\nachieved by asking the CE to discern his own feedback and\nthe staff feedback on the accused leader behaviors and the\npossible affects of those behaviors. Tables 3 and 4 represent\nthe summary statements made by the CE and staff. As the\nfacilitator, I avoided editing or analysis of the feedback\nbecause the feedback was to be used subsequently to ensure\nhigh levels of ownership with the two accused.\nConfronting and Analyzing the\nBehaviors and Affects\nOnce the CE had clarified the leader behaviors and affects,\nthe next roles played in this bullying accusation involved\nworking with the two accused leaders themselves. The pro-\ncess began by presenting the leaders with the feedback as\nshown in Tables 3 and 4, and ensuring the leaders had time to\nreflect on this feedback and to ask any questions about the\ninformation. Initially, considerable time was needed to allow\nthe leaders to resolve some of their stress about the accusa-\ntions (Role 2 in the HEBL model). This delicate, almost\ncounseling, element is not the focus of this article, although\ncounseling is a critical element. In summary, good listening,\nclarifying, and reflecting counseling skills were used.\nWork with the leaders in the third HEBL role was in con-\nfronting the issues by guiding the accused leaders to use a\ndefensive lens to unpack and analyze the behaviors that oth-\ners had summarized. They were asked to analyze the behav-\niors as either controlling (C) strategies or avoiding (A), or a\nTable 2. HEBL Model for Dealing With Bullying.\nRoles Approach steps\n1.

The\naccused leaders (like most people) found it difficult to easily\ndistinguish avoidance and control, with frequent A/C com-\nbined categorization shown in the two tables. To demonstrate\nsuch blurring, the first example of categorization of A/C\nfrom Table 3 is provided. Here, the description of leader\nbehavior notes,\nWork submitted by due date by staff but then sat in leader in-tray\nfor over a week awaiting proofreading with result of a deadline\nfor a client being missed. (A/C)\nNote that this behavior is reported in the affect column as\n\"Seen as deliberate procrastination with outcome of loss of\nrespect by client.\" The word deliberate is important here. If\nthe behavior is viewed as deliberate, a likelihood exists that\nthe leader's subtle avoidance strategy could be quite manipu-\nlative control in disguise. Such subtlety is not lost on the staff\nand, in my experience, is often perceived as more damaging\nthan outright control. As one employee stated, \"I would\nrather have the knife put in from the front than deviously\nfrom behind. At least I can see the knife coming when it's in\nfront of me!\" To reiterate the point, avoidance can be a devi-\nous and dangerous form of control. The A/C categorization\nused in the tables indicates that control--although subtle--is\nevident.\nFollowing the analysis of behaviors, the accused leaders\ndrew up a summary of the important strategies that they con-\nsidered they had been using, as represented in Table 5.\nThe Table 5 summary indicates a picture of defensive\nbehavior with some strategies overlapping and others not.\nThe leader in Scenario 2 is a more typical example of overt\ncontrolling strategies: The leader in Scenario 1 has a more\nmanipulative style. In both scenarios, multiple examples\nexist of covering up and withholding and blocking informa-\ntion, bypassing (and gatekeeping), indirectness, and provid-\ning mixed messages. Examples are also evident of outright\ntyranny, threat, and oppression more overtly shown in\nScenario 2. Unilateral decision-making predominates for\nboth of the leaders, although again more overtly in Scenario\n2, as do alienation of staff, deceit, and inconsistency.\nMisunderstandings, distortions, and misinterpretations are\nTable 3.

Restricted inclusivity and collaboration with staff,\nlimited ownership of work, lowered morale, heightened\nstaff frustration and helplessness, and staff feelings of poor\nsupport are likely to be linked to reduced performance, low\nengagement, and low trust in the leader.\nThe defensive strategies for both leaders fall within defi-\nnitions of bullying. Whether overt or covert, the avoidance\nand control strategies that the two leaders demonstrated are\nderived from deep values, and these strategies often go unde-\ntected with individuals until they are in stressed situations:\nsituations that are common in leadership positions. I believe\nthat these stressed situations can be exacerbated at an organi-\nzational level when poor senior leadership and dysfunctional\nsystems and structures prevail. In other words, blame for\nincreased defensiveness should never be fully attributed to\nan individual leader. For this reason, as noted earlier in this\narticle, striving to address issues at a more holistic level is\nimportant.\nAs part of the developmental work conducted with the\naccused leaders, I provided each with some background to\ndefensiveness after they had analyzed the summarized\nLeadership Behaviors as avoidance, control, or combination\nstrategies. These two leaders were no different to almost all\nothers I have conducted similar work with. They did not need\nsomeone else to indicate what the dominant, or target, areas\nof concern were. They were quick to analyze those them-\nselves and were considerably more critical than I would ever\nhave been.\nAfter the analysis and summary of strategies was com-\npleted, the accused leaders were guided to prioritize what\nTable 4.

Addressing one issue at a time has been criti-\ncal to the success of improvement in addressing bullying\nconcerns: Anything more seems to create overwhelm. In the\ncase of the Scenario 1 leader, the focus was on attempting to\nbe more transparent when providing information to staff. The\nScenario 2 leader focused on reducing micro-management\nand scrutiny of staff work. The next task for the accused\nleaders was to carry out these improvements in the develop-\nmental step. In both scenarios, this development period was\napproximately a year, reflecting the depth of shifts in behav-\nior needed. Throughout this development, the leaders itera-\ntively implemented improvements and reflected on those\nindividually as well as with me as facilitator.\nApproximately 1 year after this approach was adopted with\nthe leaders, the CE and staff were asked to provide feedback\non improvements. In both cases, the feedback indicated shifts\nin the predominantly controlling strategies of the leaders.\nA Legal Lens on the Scenarios\nIn New Zealand, workplace bullying can be addressed through\nprosecution. As the earlier descriptions of bullying indicate, in\nCanada, recourse and remedies must be addressed through\nemployer policies and, or, provisions in collective agreements.\nCase law in Canada, however, provides precedence for heavy\npenalties, as the following example legal cases indicate. In Shah\nsupervisor engaged in name-calling, insults, shouting, and angry\noutbursts, which were not contradicted. These contributed to\nemployee intimidation, demeanment, and humiliation. The\njudge was satisfied that no employee should have to tolerate\n118, QL), the employee's supervisor deliberately demeaned\nthe employee by asking him to wash his truck, telling him to\ncome in through the back door, and undermined his role as\nunion president by questioning why he was at the district\noffice in front of other employees. In this case, the arbitrator\nordered less punitive remedies to assist the parties to improve\nthe workplace environment; the arbitrator ordered them to\ndevelop a harassment policy within 6 weeks, or she would\nimpose resurrection of labor-management meetings with\noutside assistance and that a trouble shooter role be estab-\nlished to resolve grievances expeditiously.\nIn Piresferreira v.Ayotte and Bell Mobility Inc. (2008), it was\nfound that abusive (the leader swore, raised his voice, pushed\nher away) treatment by a supervisor caused posttraumatic stress\ndisorder and that the employer was liable for the supervisor's\naction (a point that was later appealed). The employee was\nThis selection of case law in Canada is indicative of\nincreased attention to penalty associated with grievances\nresulting from management bullying. The types of bullying\nbehaviors noted as intimidating, demeaning, and abusive all\nfit within the defensive category of control described in this\narticle. They are behaviors exhibited individually, which pro-\nfoundly influence the ability of an organization to be seen as\na learning organization where individuals \" . . . support and\nencourage one another's learning\" (Hodgkinson, 2000, p.\n157). In each of the cases, judgment clearly showed that such\nbehavior is not tolerable, and in the second case of CUPE v.\nHouston, the arbitrator provided a strong message of a need\nto improve workplace policy and practice.\nConclusion\nThe two scenarios indicate that outcomes of defensiveness\nand bullying work against the creation of a learning organi-\nzation because they are damaging for the leader, the staff, the\norganization, clients, and society if these aggressive strate-\ngies prevail. Those outcomes also align with O'Driscoll\net al.'s (2011) large-scale survey of staff which indicated that\nbullying \" . . . was significantly correlated with higher levels\nof strain, reduced well-being, reduced commitment to their\norganization, and lower self-rated performance\" (p. 309).\nBoth the scenarios and the cases cited in the legal opinion\nhighlight that the time is overdue for organizations to take\nresponsibility for ensuring that leader bullying is addressed\nif they wish to be seen as a learning organization. Such\nresponsibility, however, goes significantly beyond the proac-\ntive suggestions raised by Van Rooyen and McCormack\n(2013) for training, or the awareness raising sessions that\nSheehan and Griffiths (2011) referred to, or \" . . . the\nTable 5.

Although each of the latter\napproaches has merit--and they are components of the fifth\nand sixth steps in the HEBL model--in my experience, these\nelements alone do not deeply enough address bullying at the\nindividual leader level. For this reason, the steps addressing\nindividual development (Steps 1-4) and those that target\norganizational development (Steps 5-6) are required. In this\nway, leaders, employers, and staff can adopt the practical\nproductive values and strategies associated with organiza-\ntional learning described in this article.\nIf the six HEBL steps are well-practiced and embedded in\nthe organization, in my experience, those steps can reduce\nthe type of litigation noted earlier. More important, at a\nbroader level, HEBL can create a culture of encouraging\nopen and respectful communication, and strengthening inter-\nactions between staff in ways that establish sustainably pro-\nductive, learning workplaces. Such culture shifting is in\nkeeping with Sheehan and Griffiths's (2011) conclusion:\n\"We further contend that workplace health management, and\na corporate culture based on partnership, trust and respect,\noffers considerable potential to move the agenda forward\"\n(p. 10). HEBL is key to moving the culture forward.\nLimitations\nThis article is limited by restriction to scenarios within one\norganization. The scenarios, however, have highlighted fac-\ntors that illustrate a link between defensiveness and bullying\nas well as supporting outcomes from bullying identified by\nLeka, 2011) and approaches for overcoming bullying\n(Sheehan & Griffiths, 2011; Van Rooyen & McCormack,\nsimilar sets of behaviors in accused leader bullying cases\nwhere I have intervened.\nThe article has a developmental focus on the intervention\napproach to identifying and addressing bullying rather than\nproviding research to establish the efficacy of the HEBL\nmodel steps discussed. This could be seen as a further limita-\ntion and adds to the concern of Mikkelsen et al. (2011) that\n. . . lack of research based knowledge on how to prevent in\nparticular bullying at work. As such, only a few research based\narticles on prevention of bullying have been published in the 14\nAlthough not specific to the context of the scenarios pre-\nsented in this article, process and milieu post hoc evaluation\ndata collection has demonstrated that behavioral shifts\noccurred for the employment of almost identical HEBL\ninterventions in another context (Piggot-Irvine & Doyle,\n2010). In the latter context, the approach adopted for both\nprocess and evaluation was within a highly collaborative\npartnership with leadership in the organization: a pivotal ele-\nment of success highlighted by Saksvik et al. (2007).\nAuthor's Note\nTo preserve anonymity, the chief executive of this public sector\norganization is not named, but he is acknowledged as a contributor\nto the detailed information in the scenarios.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nArgyris, C.
