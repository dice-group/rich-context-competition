Are individual factors\nassociated with reduced well-being the same in these countries? and Are lower socioeconomic groups more severely hit than\nthe better off?. Data before the crisis are compared with data in 2013/2014 (EU-SILC [European Union Statistics on Income\nand Living Conditions] survey 2013) for Greece, Portugal, Ireland, and Spain. Finland is used as a reference category. Before\ncontrol of individual characteristics, regressions demonstrate a small and mostly significant fall in average satisfaction with\nlife in these countries, Portugal being an exception. According to the theory of capability and actual economic and political\ndevelopment, it was hypothesized that Greece--being the worst case in terms of economic development--may experience\nthe greatest fall in life satisfaction. This hypothesis is not supported by the data. In fact, the strongest decline was found in\nIreland. In particular, lack of political trust stands in Greece out as having an impact, while poor health is related to Ireland\nand unemployment to Portugal and Spain. Greatest socioeconomic inequality in life satisfaction was found in Portugal.\n",

This is especially a pertinent issue among\nthose EURO-zone countries most hard hit by the crisis, the\nso-called PIGS-countries, that is, Portugal, Ireland Greece,\nand Spain.1 These are the countries in the Euro zone periph-\nery required to adopt budget retrenchment measures\n(Hardiman, 2012). By contrasting the situation in these\nPIGS-countries before and after the crisis with that of\nFinland, the only Nordic country being part of the EURO-\nzone, we may be better able to understand the most important\ndrivers for health and subjective well-being. Has develop-\nment in subjective health and satisfaction with life on aver-\nage worsened among people in these countries, and have\nsocioeconomic inequalities on these welfare parameters\nincreased to the same extent in all these four countries?\nI am using data from 2004 as a pre-crisis baseline, com-\nparing them with the latest available dataset in European\nSocial Surveys (ESS) from 2014 (seventh round). In addi-\ntion, I am also using 2013 EU-SILC (European Union\nStatistics on Income and Living Conditions). In contrast to\nearlier studies, this study uses a longer time span (10 years),\nand aims at incorporating individual data in a country con-\ntext. Earlier studies have used aggregated data for a huge\nnumber of countries (European Union [EU]/Agreement on\ntheEuropeanEconomicArea[EEA]countriesorOrganisation\nfor Economic Co-Operation and Development [OECD]\ncountries), or individual longitudinal data for one or two\ncountries, but, as far as I know, have not yet compared the\ndevelopment in the countries presumably worst hit by the\ncrisis with that of a non-crisis country.\nIndividual satisfaction with life (evaluative well-being) is\nnot only associated with individual factors, but is heavily\ninfluenced by country context such as \"good governance\"\n(Helliwell, Huang, & Wang, 2015). Yet, aggregate data can-\nnot tell why some individuals have been more hard hit than\nothers.

To study changes in life satisfac-\ntion, inequality has in the literature been less developed\n(Owen & Philips, 2015). Which categories are hardest hit by\nthe recession, and are they similar or dissimilar in the coun-\ntries under study? The drivers behind changes in well-being\nmay not be the same for all these countries, not least because\nthe causal paths to the crisis differ among these countries\n(Therborn, 2013). Previous aggregate studies of well-being\ncannot identify which factors in each crisis country play a\nrole. This study aims at filling these voids.\nTheory and Research Questions\nI am testing a widespread theory that recessions affect nega-\ntively well-being and that their impacts are unequal within as\nwell as between countries. People's satisfaction with life is\ndetermined not only by macro-level economic development\nbut also by their actual experiences and living conditions as\nwell as personality The theoretical point of departure is\nAmartya Sen's (1999) capability approach used as an assess-\nment of individual well-being. Capabilities are the freedoms\nand rights people have to do or be to fulfill their potential for\nwell-being. The basic capability is the freedom to choose\n(autonomy) a life she or he has reason to value (Sen, 1999).\nCapabilities are thus \"a person's real freedoms or oppor-\ntunities to achieve functionings\" (Robeyns, 2016, p. 9).\nThese freedoms and opportunities are made feasible and\nconstrained by both internal and external (social and envi-\nronmental) conversion factors (Robeyns, 2005). The coun-\ntry-level frameworks (space of action) for capabilities can\nbe measured at the national level, traditionally not only by\ngross domestic product (GDP) per capita, unemployment, or\ninequality but also, for example, by an aggregate measure of\nsocial justice, corruption or a measure of social expenditures.\nCapabilities restrict whether resources can be converted into\nfunctionings as well as choice of functions (Robeyns, 2005,\npeople actually are doing within the institutional constraint\nof a nation, can be measured by individual characteristics\nsuch as labor market status and household's economic situa-\ntion. Together, capabilities and functionings determine sub-\njective well-being (satisfaction with life). Sen's capability\napproach has been incorporated in a well-being framework,\nwhere subjective well-being reflects the \"total of an individ-\nual's capabilities to achieve subjective well-being\" (Binder,\nWell-being is a multidimensional concept. Satisfaction\nwith life, a sub dimension of well-being--the other being\nhappiness (the hedonic dimension) and meaning (the eude-\nmonic dimension)--is regarded as a valid indicator (Deaton\n& Stone, 2016). Life satisfaction can be regarded as the most\nappropriate as a policy goal (Veenhoven, 2010). This subjec-\ntive measure is meant to represent a cognitive and global\nappraisal of quality of life as a whole, taking all life\ncircumstances into consideration (Eurofound, 2012). Thus,\nlife satisfaction can be regarded as a valid measure of a per-\nson's functioning. Both past, present, and to a certain extent\nthe future is reflected in peoples' response to questions of\nsatisfaction with life.\nAconsequence of the recession has been austerity policies\nin many European countries, not least in the PIGS-countries\n(Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain), with repercussions on the\ncapabilities of populations in these countries to achieve sub-\njective well-being. Life satisfaction is not a direct function\nof the economy, but has an indirect impact through changes\nin peoples' experience of free choice and having control\nover their life situation (Helliwell & Wang, 2013). It turns\nout that the experience of freedom of choice and control pre-\ndicts satisfaction with life to a greater extent than health,\nemployment, and income, both within and across countries:\n\"Income expands freedoms of choice by definition\" (Verme,\nThe research question is threefold:\nResearch Question 1: To which degree is the financial\ncrisis of 2008 and the subsequent recession associated\nwith reduced well-being among people in the four hardest\naffected EURO-countries?\nResearch Question 2: Are individual factors associated\nwith reduced well-being the same in these countries?\nResearch Question 3: Are lower socioeconomic groups\nmore severely hit than the better off?\nDrivers of Satisfaction With Life:\nRecent Findings\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that economic growth\n(the natural log of GDP per capita) is important (Deeming &\n(social protection expenditure) has a greater impact on peo-\nple's well-being (Growiec & Growiec, 2014; O'Connor,\nFinally, economic downturns can have a negative influ-\nence on life satisfaction, because it is more sensitive to eco-\nnomic conditions than happiness (Inglehart, Foa, Peterson, &\nWelzel, 2009). In general, it turns out that income losses\nhave a stronger effect on life satisfaction than income gains\n(Wolbring, Keuschnigg, & Negele, 2013). Blanchflower and\nOswald (2011) have looked at changes in life satisfaction\nover recent years during a recession using data from\nlife satisfaction levels both in Greece and Portugal, measured\nboth by a decline in their mean scores as well as in the rela-\ntive rankings in the regression, but in fact an increase in life\nsatisfaction levels of the Irish.\nThe impact of economic crisis on happiness has been stud-\nied in the case of Iceland. This longitudinal study found that\nincome and unemployment did not predict happiness, but\nfinancial difficulties did.Adecrease (small, but significant) in\nHalvorsen 3\nFindings do not fully support the assertion that \"decreases\nin income at the national level, due to recessions for instance,\nmight with greater certainty cause declines in SWB\" (Diener\ntality and morbidity (health indicators presumably associated\nwith happiness/well-being) could rise during upturns and\ndecrease during economic downturns (Bacigalupe &\nEarlier studies have shown that change in the unemploy-\nment rate had significant impact on well-being (Arampatzi,\nFurthermore, subjective insecurity and the role of institu-\ntions seem to have an impact on well-being (Chung & Mau,\n2014). There is a positive association between the degree of\ndemocracy and satisfaction with life (Dolan, Peasgood, &\nWhite, 2008). Especially in universal welfare states (such as\nFinland), there are high mutual trust and trust in public institu-\ntions and democracy and small corruption (Eurofound, 2012;\nRothstein, 2011). Political stability has robustly significant\neffects on happiness (Wang & Sunny Wong, 2014). During\ncrises, politics change as a response, and will in turn impact on\nthe well-being of those people affected. Good governance is\nmore strongly associated with satisfaction with life than GDP\nCountry Descriptions\nCapability--regarded as set of alternative functionings that\na person can attain, is strongly influenced by the social\nstructures and institutions in each country (Robeyns, 2005).\nThe country descriptions aim at presenting possible con-\nstraints on individual freedoms and opportunities (i.e., indi-\nvidual capacity to make autonomous choices and pursue a\nfulfilling life, Graham & Nikolova, 2014), by using objective\ncapability measures.\nRecessions, Fall in GDP and Income, Inequality\nand Increase of Debts\nA recession is defined as a business cycle contraction in two\ndown consecutive quarters. In Greece, it lasted for 63 months\nstats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=350; Quarterly national\naccounts).\nGDP per capita (Purchasing Power Parity [PPS]) has\nthus decreased strongly in the PIGS-countries.

The economic crisis has\nonly to a limited extent affected the Finnish labor market.\nPublic Expenditures and Debts\nPeople in all these four PIGS-countries had to pay a heavy\nprice in the form of reduction in public expenditures such as\nstricter targeting criteria for social benefits, cuts in salaries,\ncuts in health budgets, pension reform (such as increased\npension age), privatization of public sectors companies, lay-\noffs, and higher taxes.\nAs a consequence of decreased GDP, government deficits\n(Spain), resulting in higher ratio of government debt to GDP\nhave increased strongly in all these countries. In 2012,\nGreece's gross debt was 157% of GDP, followed by Portugal\nit was 53%.2 The highest level of general government gross\nwhile there was an increase in Spain (+17.6%) and Portugal\nHealth expenditures in real terms per capita fell annually\n3.3% in Portugal, with 4% in Ireland, with 1.6% in Spain,\nwhile there was an 1.3% increase in Finland (OECD,\n2015a). Access to health care during the Great Recession\nhas decreased, and co-payments have gone up, while need\nfor medication for depression have gone up (Stuckler &\nCuts in cash benefits, and fall in their real values due to\ninflation, have had the greatest negative impact in Greece.\nSuch cuts in Greece, Ireland, and Portugal have been imposed\non them because of the European Union-International\nMonetary Fund (EU-IMF) loan program. All the four Pigs-\ncountries have met strong pressures to reduce their budget\nGDP in accordance with EU's Stability- and Growth pact.\nEU's \"Excessive Deficit Procedures\" were set in force\ntoward Ireland, Greece, and Spain as early as in October\n2008, immediately reducing their loan capacity. Greece had\nlion Euro). These rescue packages obliged Greece to accept\ncomprehensive cuts in expenditures and large tax increases.3\nIreland had to use EU-IMF loan in 2010 (rescue package\nlion Euro), while Spain in 2012 had to accept a rescue loans\nfor the banks of 100 billion Euro. The stabilization programs\nimposed by EU-IMF ended for Ireland in December 2013, in\nPortugal in May 2014, while the second stabilization pro-\ngram for Greece, which started in 2012, will last for three\nmore years.4 As a result these countries had to undertake\nlabor market reforms, resulting in substantial changes: More\nor less dismantling of collective bargaining, more insecure,\nflexible jobs, and lower minimum wages.\nIt seems that apart from Greece, the other three countries\nIreland, Spain, and to a certain extent Portugal were more or\nless equally hit by the crisis (number of months in recessions,\ndecrease in GDP per capita, and increase in unemployment\nlevels). As a consequence, household disposable income fell\nTrust\nAll these countries, with the exception of Finland, have a\npopulation with low trust in government (Eurofound, 2012;\nOECD, 2014b). We find reduced trust in police and in the\nlegal system especially in Greece (Helliwell & Wang,\n2013). Changes in social trust (in the police and the legal\nsystem) are found to be the primary contributors to changes\nover time in subjective well-being in European countries\n(Helliwell, Huang, & Wang, 2014). Distrust breeds distrust,\nnot least with a perceived increase in corruption (Sachs,\n2015): Perception of corruption is negatively and strongly\nassociated with low evaluation of life (happiness) accord-\ning to regressions on national averages levels (Helliwell\nIt is hard to distinguish between countries that were\nequally hard hit by the economic crisis, but where some have\nhad strong austerity measures and others not, as there is a\nhigh correlation between the severity of the crisis and type of\nausterity measures (OECD, 2014b, see also Saltkjel,\nIngelsrud, Dahl, & Halvorsen, in press). On the basis of the\ntheoretical point of departure and country descriptions, I\nnevertheless tentatively hypothesize that the Greek people\nhave had the most negative development in well-being expe-\nriences, followed by the Spaniards and, and to a smaller\nextent the Irish and the Portuguese, compared with the refer-\nence country, Finland.\nAccompanied with lower satisfaction with life is lower\npersonal trust (Helliwell & Wang, 2011), which could be seen\nas a consequence of political instability due to the recession.\nTherefore, fall in personal and political trust can be expected,\nbeing more strongly associated with (low) satisfaction with\nlife in 2013 than in pre-crisis period, particularly in Greece.\nHalvorsen 5\nData and Research Design\nI am using cross sectional datasets from ESS mainly from the\ncountries. Especially the South Mediterranean states have\nbeen characterized as \"familist\" welfare states. The role of\nthe Catholic Church and non-governmental organizations\n(NGOs) has been of great importance in Spain and Portugal,\nwhile the Eastern Orthodox Church has played a less impor-\ntant in promoting welfare in Greece (Petmesidou, 2013). The\n(traditional) families in these states have been used as \"social\nshock absorbers\" responding to a wide range of risks (Ferrera,\n2010). Also in Ireland being a catholic state, its people have\nput strong emphasis on the family. Finland, being a secular,\nuniversalistic welfare state with an individualistic culture,\nnot much hit by the crisis, is used as a benchmark. Although\na EURO-zone country, it is at the same time an example of\nthe well-performing Nordic countries on most indicators of\nwelfare and democratic development. In terms of happiness\nscores, Finland was ranked sixth among 158 countries in the\n(Helliwell et al., 2015). The strong social fabric of the Finnish\nsociety has enabled people to overcome earlier crisis\nthe response rates were at acceptable levels, varying between\n50% and 78%. Surveys for the ESS Round 7 were in Spain\nand Portugal conducted during 2015, which is up to 2 years\nI have used as recommended by ESS design weights/pop-\nulation weights to compensate for skewed distribution on\ncentral background variables in the samples.\nESS-data are supplemented with EU-SILC 2013 and its\nad hoc well-being module\nin order to include the development in Greece, and for the\npurpose of a robustness check by comparing data from EU-SILC\nadvantage of EU-SILC 2013 is the greater number of\nrespondents, and as a consequence reduced confidence intervals\nof coefficients in the regressions. Besides, it also includes data\nof European Social Surveys (www.europeansocialsurveys.org).\nEU-SILC 2013 surveys are done partly by personal inter-\nviews and partly by telephone interviews. I have used\nIn the comparisons, I am using ordinary least squares\n(OLS) hierarchical regression in IBM SPSS statistics 23.\nThe Dependent Variable: Definition and\nMeasurement of Subjective Well-Being\nI am using an evaluative dimension of subjective well-being,\nnamely, satisfaction with life--being an overall cognitive\nassessment of life. The validity and reliability of satisfaction\nwith life has been amply documented to be high (see, for\nassessment of life is strongly correlated with material condi-\ntions, social relationships, and health (Eurostat, 2015d). It\nalso seems that this indicator is sensitive to change in politi-\ncal measures.\nSatisfaction with life is proxied by this item (in ESSs):\n\"All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life\nas a whole nowadays. Please answer using this card, where 0\nmeans extremely dissatisfied and 10 means extremely satis-\nfied.\" This 11-point scale is thus running from 0 to 10. In\nEU-SILC 2013, satisfaction with life is measured in a similar\nway, but where score 0 means not at all satisfied and score 10\nmeans fully satisfied for last 4 weeks. This categorical vari-\nable can be regarded as continuous, making it feasible to use\nOLS regressions. Both surveys have the same numbers of\nresponse options, but as shown, the wordings are not identi-\ncal: \"extremely dissatisfied/extremely satisfied\" versus \"not\nat all satisfied/fully satisfied.\" Besides, ESS refers to \"nowa-\ndays\" while EU-SILC refers to \"last four weeks.\"\nIndependent Individual Variables\nBased on earlier findings, I hypothesize that the main explan-\natory individual factors explaining variance are supposed to\nbe unemployment, subjective health (Suhrke & Stuckler,\npersonal trust (Growiec & Growiec, 2014; Helliwell &\nated by family network and support/help from family\n(Mikucka, 2014). Health status is also a good predictor of\nsubjective well-being (Eurofound, 2013), but is here regarded\nas an independent variable.5\nHousehold income levels and national wealth have strong\neffects on social well-being, but particularly for low-income\nattrition of a household income variable is substantial for\nseveral of the countries, I have instead included a variable of\nself-perceived household financial difficulties.6 Objective\nmeasures of household income show that self-perceived dif-\nficulties are real (OECD, 2014b). Especially households\nwith poor savings have difficulties to cope with reduced\nhousehold income, unless social support measures can com-\npensate for this income loss (OECD, 2014b). Greater eco-\nnomichardshipmayalsoaffectnegativelysocialrelationships\nand attitudes toward others (OECD, 2014b).\nMistrust may occur because of bad times and dysfunc-\ntional (untrustworthy) government institutions (Rothstein,\n2011), and having a negative impact on well-being, mediated\nthrough, for example, the extent of optimism about the future\n(Eurofound, 2012). I control for personal trust and social\nrelationships--being central indicators of social capital\n(Sachs, 2015). Social networks can protect people against\n6 SAGE Open\nnegative impact of financial hardship and well-being\n(Growiec & Growiec, 2014). Social connectedness (the role\nof the family and social connections) has been found to be\ncentral for well-being promotion (Delle Fave, 2014). I have\nmeasured connectedness through a variable based on a ques-\ntion whether the respondent had anyone to talk about per-\nsonal mattes or not (intimacy). This variable is regarded as a\nmediating factor in the regressions.\nFinancial crisis can harm health or improve health as\nmentioned earlier. Health status has been found to be the\nmost notable predictor for general life satisfaction (Eurostat,\n2015d). There seems to be a strong reciprocal relationship\nbetween ill health and employment status, due to both selec-\ntive processes and health effects of unemployment (Heggeb\u00f8\n& Dahl, 2015). I have entered self-reported health to repre-\nsent the health of the individuals (fair, bad, or very bad is\ncoded 1; good or very good is coded 0), as well as a variable\nabout being hampered in daily life due to a chronic long-\nstanding illness (answered yes = 1, no = 0) as independent\nvariables.\nControl variables are dummies for sex, age (20-29 years\nvs. 30 years and older), marital status (being single--living\nin a one-person household), and finally educational level\n(primary education versus all other educational levels), as an\nindicator of socioeconomic status.\nDescriptive Statistics\nIn the following, I am restricting the analyses to age group 20\nto 59 years, which is the working age population, most likely\nhardest hit by the recession.\nBoth gender and age are quite similar in all samples that I\nam comparing, while there are dissimilarity between ESS\nand EU-SILC when it comes to proportion of single persons\nand people with low education. The most noteworthy of the\ndescriptive statistics is the high proportion having low edu-\ncation in Portugal (results not presented, but are available by\ncontacting the author).\n2006 (Spain and Portugal), there was an increase in average sat-\nisfaction with life, turning downward in 2008 (Greece, Ireland,\nand Spain), with another reversed trend in 2010 (Portugal) or\n2012 (Ireland). In Spain, there has a steady fall in satisfaction\nwith life since 2006. Yet, when using standard deviations as a\nmeasure of inequality, it does not seem that there has been\ngreater inequality in satisfaction with life in any of these coun-\ntries, with Spain and possibly Portugal being exceptions.\nMultivariate Analyses\nExternal circumstances are controlled for by entering coun-\ntry as dummy variables in the OLS regressions,8 using\nFinland as a reference category (Model 1, Table 2).Adummy\nvariable is meant to represent the different characteristics of\nthe country that we are comparing, but being unobserved. All\nbut not all of them are significant (having overlapping confi-\ndence intervals). These changes demonstrate mostly worse\nsatisfaction with life, with the exception of Portugal, where\nthere has been an improvement, although not significant\ndence intervals), albeit with a lower starting level than the\nother countries (see Table 1). Yet, the worst development\nsince 2004 according to these data was unexpectedly found\nin Ireland, followed by Spain and Greece. The next step is to\ncheck whether these country differences hold when control-\nling for individual variables.\nTable 3 (Model 2) analyzes individual variation in satis-\nfaction with life, including controls for living in a certain\ncountry. The country differences are smaller, and none of the\nagain with the exception of Portugal. Explained variance\ngests that the main changes in aggregate satisfaction with life\n(Table 1) can be attributed to individual characteristics and\nchanges in these.\nTable 1.

As is demonstrated, individual coefficients explain\nmuch more of the variance than country coefficients. The\nquality of social relations (having someone to talk to about\npersonal matters with) is associated with higher satisfactions\nwith life in all regressions, but particularly in EU-SILC 2013.\nThe importance of quality of social relations is in line with\nothers studies on satisfaction with life/happiness (see, for\nKeeping in mind that ESS 2014 does not include Greece,\nin contrast to EU-SILC 2013, coefficients in both surveys\nhave the same sign (living alone is the only exception), but\nthe magnitude is dissimilar, for example, the coefficients of\neconomic hardship and intimacy. Nevertheless, this compari-\nson indicates that the findings are robust.\nTable 4 presents interaction effects between country and\nmain explanatory variables (unemployment, financial hard-\nship, health, personal trust, and political trust). These are\nselected according to existing literature and theory in this\nfield (see \"Theory and Research Questions\" and \"Drivers of\nSatisfaction With Life: Recent findings\" sections) In 2004\n(ESS data), due to the small number of respondents, the only\nsignificant (at 5% level) interaction effect was found between\npolitical trust and Portugal, and between health and Greece\n(results not presented).\ninteraction effects) demonstrates that unemployment is asso-\nciated with lower satisfaction with life in Portugal Spain and\nIreland, but only to a small extent in Greece. On the contrary,\nGreece had the most negative impact of political trust on\nsatisfaction with life compared with the reference category\nFinland, followed by Portugal and Spain. Being healthy\nseems to be positively associated with satisfaction with life\nin Greece, while being of no importance in Spain. Bad sub-\njective health was particularly associated with low satisfac-\ntion with life in Ireland.\nFinally, Ireland is different with financial hardship being\npositively associated with satisfaction with life, while there\nwas a small negative association in Greece and no in Spain (all\ncompared to the reference category Finland). Compared to\nmay suspect that this is due to different wording of the ques-\ntion about financial hardship in EU-SILC 2013 (see Note 6).\nThe association between personal trust and country\nis small but significant in all countries compared to\nFinland.\nTable 4.

At coun-\ntry level, the greatest significant fall in satisfaction with life\nGreece, while there was an improvement in Portugal. These\nresults are not as hypothesized and not fully in accordance\nwith, for example, Blanchflower and Oswald (2011), per-\nhaps due to a different time span. When controlling for indi-\nvidual characteristics, satisfaction with life does not differ\nsignificantly among people in Spain, Ireland and Greece,\nwhile the Portuguese, having a low starting point, are signifi-\ning with Finland, used as a benchmark. This suggests that\nindividual's capability and functioning is not only influenced\nby the economic and political development (macro-factors),\nbut by individual factors such as education, household situa-\ntion, financial situation, employment status, and health.\nWorse subjective health cannot significantly explain\nthan in 2004, in any of the four countries under study, with\na possible exception for Ireland. On average, subjective\nhealth has improved or been stable. That is also the case for\ninequality in health being rather stable (as measured by\nstandard deviations) in all five countries (results not pre-\nsented). Yet, fall in life satisfaction can be regarded as a\nleading indicator pointing to later serious health problems\n(OECD, 2014b). Most of the associations between individ-\nual characteristics and satisfaction with life are in accor-\ndance with previous findings.\nThe fundamental question is whether these results give\nsupport to a hypothesis about a statistical connection between\nthe economic crisis in the PIGS-countries and average satis-\nfaction with life. Such a hypothesis implying that Greece may\nexperience the greatest fall in satisfaction with life is not sup-\nported by the data. A 25% fall in GDP per capita have resulted\nonly in a 6% fall in average satisfaction with life. In fact, the\nstrongest decline was found in Ireland (where the crisis ended\nment in Portugal. Because average subjective well-being\nwithin OECD nations also was found to be unaffected by vari-\nous economic and environmental crises (Veenhoven, 2005),\none could perhaps name the development \"The Paradox of\nWhat about increasing socioeconomic differences?\nDuring the crisis, there has not been an increase in stan-\ndard deviations of satisfaction with life (Table 1), but still\nthere could be increasing socioeconomic differences, with,\nfor example, persons with lower education more hard hit\nby the crisis than others (van der Wel et al., 2016). This\nseems to be the case: Low education explains more of the\nThis seems to be especially the case in Portugal, where\nthere was on average an increase in satisfaction with life\nduring the crisis. Besides, people having no one to talk\nintimately with (i.e., being socially isolated) seem to be\nhardest hit by the economic downturn.\nAdaptive preferences may explain why PIGS-countries\nhave not experienced a much greater average fall in satisfac-\ntion with life: People seem to get used to worse living condi-\ntions and reduce their expectations accordingly (Elster,\nregarded as a survival strategy. It is attributed to a necessity\nof keeping up self-esteem, control, and optimism (Cummins,\n2003). Related is a habituation effect of unemployment as it\nbecomes more common (Mertens & Beblo, 2016).\nWhich alternative factors than economic decline and fall\nin employment could have an impact on changes in satisfac-\ntion with life in these countries? The following aggregate\nfactors have been highlighted in recent research (apart from\nthose already mentioned: institutional trust, social justice,\nand corruption).\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Family resilience: Families, when they can, actively\nadapt to adverse circumstances, such as drawing\non savings or reducing non-essential consumption\n(OECD, 2014b). Social support (having someone to\ncount on in case of trouble) is the factor that explains\nmost of national variation in happiness around the\nworld (Helliwell et al., 2015). Surveys also show that\na high proportion of respondents in these countries\nreceive and provide help and support from people\nTraditionally, the family (and kin) has played a central\nrole in pooling resources (Petmesidou, 2013) in these\nnations. Yet in Greece, the family has had a weaken-\ning position as a welfare clearinghouse (Papadopoulos\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A large informal economy in Greece may also have\nhad a buffering impact (Petmesidou, 2013), as well as\nin Spain: Spain's black economy was by the end of\nMultilevel resilience may thus have helped the population\nto resist and adapt to health threats due to the economic crisis\n(Karanikolos et al., 2013). Resilience against economic hard-\nship is dealt with through immaterial resources from civil\nsociety, but less so among the most deprived (Reeskens &\nVandecasteele, 2016). Examples are trends toward refamil-\nialization (particularly in Ireland and Spain, cf. OECD,\n2014b), emigration in Spain and Portugal, emergence of\nlocal solidarity groups in Greece, and buffers from family\n(youth living at home and/or getting some support from par-\nents or grandparents), charities, and some regional efforts in\nSpain. Although macro-level factors play a role in reducing\npeoples capabilities to achieve subjective well-being, multi-\nlevel resilience, from families, the informal economy and\nvoluntary organizations may have played a moderating role.\nStrengths and Limitations\nThe strength of this article is the use of ESSs over a 10-year\ntime span, where the same question about satisfaction with\nlife has been used in all survey rounds. The dependent vari-\nable used is highly recommended and has high reliability and\nvalidity as an indicator of evaluative well-being. Another\nadvantage is the use of EU-SILC 2013, which gave me the\nopportunity to conduct a robustness check of the main data,\nas well as being able to include Greece in the analyses.\nBecause different individuals are interviewed each year\n(cross-sections), I cannot address the issue of causality. The\npositive association, for example, between subjective health\nand satisfaction with life postulates that health impacts on\nsatisfaction with life, but in reality the causality runs both\nDespite what has been said earlier about the reliability\nand validity of the dependent variable--satisfaction with\nlife, there is evidence that respondents tend to downplay\nnegative circumstances when answering to such questions\nin surveys (Ponocny, Weismayer, Stross, & Dressler, 2015).\nThis does not necessarily affect comparisons over time and\nacross countries, although giving a too favorable estimate of\nthe absolute level of satisfaction with life. But there may be\na problem if the tendency to downplay negative circum-\nstances differs between various categories of people.\nIn line with most other comparative studies on changes in\nsatisfaction with life, this study is based on cross-sectional\ndata. To develop further changes over time within as well\nacross countries, panel data (longitudinal data) are much\nneeded in future research on this topic.\nConclusion\nThe assumption that economic decline with certainty reduces\nsatisfaction with life does not find full support in the analy-\nses presented. I have shown that satisfaction with life has\nfallen somewhat in the PIGS-countries, Portugal being an\nexception. Compared with the reference category, the\nchanges are small and/or insignificant (overlapping con-\nfidence intervals). I hypothesized that Greece who had\nthe greatest decline in economic activity and a subsequent\nincrease in unemployment level would have seen the greatest\nfall in satisfaction with life. In fact, it was Ireland, where bad\nhealth had a strong negative influence shown by the interac-\ntion effects. Furthermore, interaction effects between a\ncountry's unemployment and individual unemployment on\nsatisfaction with life were strongest in Ireland and Portugal\nwith lowest level of unemployment, followed by Spain with\nhigh levels of unemployment. As expected, there was a great\ninteraction effect between political trust and Greece on satis-\nfaction with life.\nGreater socioeconomic inequalities in satisfaction with\npronounced in Portugal. In addition, I identified socially iso-\nlated persons and low educated as being hardest hit by the\ncrisis. The least satisfied are in the lowest income decile\nIn countries heavily affected by the \"Great recession,\"\npeoples' capabilities have been reduced, resulting in worse\nfunctionings, in particular due to unemployment, lower\nincomes, and financial hardship that follow from a reces-\nsion and austerity measures. The economic crisis has\nresulted in a political crisis and less trust in the political\nsystem/politicians. These factors reduce the freedom to\nmake life choices, most likely resulting in pessimism about\nthe future and hopelessness. Surprisingly, I did not found\nworse subjective health being a consequence of the reces-\nsion. The situation in terms of well-being would have been\nworse in these countries if not multilevel resilience had\nplayed a moderating role (by families, NGOs, regions, and\nmunicipalities).\nHowever, lower satisfaction with life can influence nega-\ntively on peoples' future health and life chances. Widespread\npessimism about the future may in itself contribute to delay\nthe reemergence of a healthy economy. The social policy\nimplications of these findings are apart from the long-term\ngoal of restoring economic growth and improving employ-\nment possibilities, to strengthen the social protection schemes.\nIn addition, redistributive income and tax policies would be\nhelpful for easing the financial burden of poor families.\nFighting corruption and restoring trust in public institutions\nwill also be necessary, especially in Greece.
