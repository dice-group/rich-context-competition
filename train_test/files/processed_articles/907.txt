This study examines the extent that older persons experience patterns of health service use that vary by race.\nMethods. Using the 1989 NLTCS database, researchers estimate ten binomial logistic regressions of community\nmedical service use by disabled White and Black older persons. Chow tests and Oaxaca decomposition analysis inform\nwhy racial differences continue to exist, although most elderly persons have Medicare.\nResults. With similar medical conditions, Blacks are less likely to use services, particularly prescription medications\nand physician services. Use of some medical services is more likely for elderly Black persons who live in rural areas,\nsmall cities, and Western states, or who have more IADLs, joint and breathing problems, and broken parts. An Oaxaca\ndecomposition indicates that differences in personal characteristics (e.g., income and health) do not fully explain racial\ndifferences in use of prescriptions and physician services.\nDiscussion. For reasons that are unrelated to financial assets, blacks remain vulnerable in their ability to access ser-\nvices commonly used by older persons. To remedy racial disparities in medical utilization, public policy must expand its\nfocuses beyond health finance issues and consider differences in availability, accessibility, and acceptability.\nOR elderly persons, maintaining health entails the use\nof a multiplicity of service providers, greater than that\nfor younger adult groups (Ferris & Wyszewianski, 1990).\nFor example, screenings for vision, hearing, dementia, can-\ncer, foot problems, and physical and occupational therapy\ncorrespond with a greater incidence of diseases and chronic\ndisabilities. However, access to a diverse spectrum of health\nand medical care services is not coordinated (Estes, Swan,\n& Associates, 1993). This lack of coordination suggests that\nsome elderly persons may lack knowledge of available ser-\nvices, face restrictions in the use of services, and/or not\nmeet eligibility criteria for use of services that are important\nto fully meet their needs. A coordinating or referral mecha-\nnism may not exist to ensure that an elderly person moves\nfrom a no-care zone, or a care environment with service\ngaps, to an agency or provider that supplies needed services\n(Estes, Swan, & Associates, 1993). When older persons ex-\nperience no-care zones, they are not able to function at max-\nThree organizational dimensions are useful in under-\nstanding why no-care zones and service gaps in care occur:\navailability, accessibility, and acceptability (Wallace, 1990a).\nStructural barriers that result from residential segregation,\nlimited income and health insurance, and geographical dis-\ntribution of facilities can limit the availability of services. A\nlack of knowledge about available services can limit acces-\nsibility. Patient dissatisfaction and unfavorable doctor-patient\ninteractions can lead to perceptions that care is unacceptable.\nAre elderly ethnic minorities more likely to experience\nno-care zones and service gaps in community-based care\ncommonly used by older persons? We know that minority\nelderly persons are more likely than White elderly persons\nto face many of the structural barriers noted above, to lack\nknowledge about new medical techniques, and to evaluate\nmedical services as culturally insensitive and/or racially dis-\ncriminatory (Wallace, 1990b; Whittle, Conigliaro, Good, &\nJoswiak, 1997). However, no conclusive research ascertains\nwhether minority elderly persons are obtaining a mix of\nlong-term care services that meet their needs (Markides &\nWallace, 1996). Further, it is unclear whether they receive\nother community services (including acute and preventive\ncare) that meet their needs.\nIn health care systems that lack incentives to deliver a co-\nordinated mix of community services to elderly persons,\nphysicians serve a central role as gatekeepers who identify\nand certify eligibility for community services. However,\nthere is a historical tradition that enables physicians to se-\nlect their patients (Rosenbaum, Serrano, Magor, & Stern,\n1997). For example, physicians may select patients by re-\nfusing to provide services to Medicaid patients or locating\ntheir practices in communities where undesirable patients\ndo not reside. Thus, the concentration of minority elderly\npersons in urban central cities and high probabilities of in-\nsurance coverage by Medicaid leads minority elderly per-\nsons to face higher risks of a lack of access to physicians. If\npatients lack access to physicians, they may also lack access\nto the gatekeepers who assist them in developing variability\nin the mix of community services obtained (Cohen, Bloom,\nWhen Blacks receive medical care, they receive less care\nand different care than that received by whites. Lee, Gehl-\nbach, Hosmer, Reti, and Baker (1997) examined this phe-\nnomenon while controlling for racial differences in location\nand insurance status. They analyzed racial differences in\nprocedures used among a zip code and race matched sample\nof Medicare beneficiaries. Lee and colleagues (1997) found\nF\nthat Whites received more services than Blacks and Black\nMedicare beneficiaries were more likely to receive lower\ncost procedures and services. These findings corroborate\nthose of Escarce, Epstein, Colby, and Schwartz (1993) who\nreport similar patterns of racial differences in medical pro-\ncedures and diagnostic tests. Among those with Medicare\ncoverage, Black patients with glaucoma have received less\ntreatment than white Medicare beneficiaries (Javitt et al.,\n1991). These racial differences in the quality of care re-\nceived may also influence utilization patterns.\nWhile there is an abundant supply of home health agen-\ncies, use of home health services is closely tied to whether\nMedicare supplements, private insurance or financial resources\nare available. Medicare provides only limited coverage for\nthese services. Further, some home health agencies, primar-\nily for-profit agencies, engage in patient selection by locat-\ning in high income areas, not using sliding fee scale pay-\nments, and providing only profitable services (Nutter, 1984;\nThese efforts, along with concerns about acceptability of\nservices due to racial prejudice (Wallace, 1990a), place\nlow-income and/or minority persons at risk of a gap in use\nof home health services.\nAccess to prescription drugs is closely tied with use of\nphysicians. For both White and Black elderly persons, use\nof prescription drugs is higher when number of physical\nhealth visits in the past year increases and when it is more\nlikely that the same physician was seen on each visit (Fil-\nlenbaum et al., 1993). Black elderly persons, particularly\nBlack men, take fewer prescription drugs; this lower utiliza-\ntion is partly explained by differences in physician prescrip-\ntions for Black compared to White elderly persons (Fillen-\nIn this paper I use data from the 1989 National Long\nTerm Care Survey to examine two primary research ques-\ntions: (a) To what extent do disabled older persons experi-\nence patterns of health service use that vary according to\nrace, and (b) Will strategies of changing health care financ-\ning options alleviate concerns of whether adequate health\ncare access exists for all disabled older persons. To address\nthese questions, I (i) examine and contrast patterns of health\nservice use and health status for disabled Black and White\nolder persons; (ii) explore the extent that there are racial dif-\nferences in the use of particular services; (iii) identify the\nfactors that influence utilization of health providers who\ncommonly deliver services to older persons who have\nchronic disabilities and live at home; and (iv) examine the\nrole of racial differences in health conditions and financial\nresources as factors influencing racial patterns of commu-\nnity service use.\nBackground\nLumsdon (1994) suggests that service gaps in long-term\ncare are not a new concern. Always present has been a pa-\ntient-driven system where patients have sought out and\npieced together a fragmented and uncoordinated system of\ncare that includes service duplication and initial treatment at\nadvanced stages of disease. It is this use of a disconnected\nspectrum of community services by White and Black eld-\nerly persons that this paper explores.\nWhether race is a factor in older disabled persons' use of\ncommunity-based long term care is equivocal. Wolinsky\nand colleagues (1989) document inequities for minority eld-\nHealth Interview Surveys to estimate models of physician\ncontacts and visits, hospital contacts and visits, stratified ac-\ncording to ethnic groups. Wolinsky and associates (1989)\ncompare stratified regressions for five ethnic groups, Puerto\nRican, Cuban, Mexican, Black, and Anglo elderly persons.\nThe model's independent variables include predisposing\ncharacteristics (gender, marital status, employment status,\nlive alone, age), enabling characteristics (telephone, city\nresidence, supply of medical personnel), and need charac-\nteristics (activity limitations, perceived health). They find\nthat health needs are the primary determinants of health ser-\nvices utilization. Yet, the importance of health needs in pre-\ndicting service use varies according to ethnic group. Thus,\nthe researchers conclude that inequities exist in access to the\nhealth care system's physicians and hospitals.\ntional Long Term Care Survey to examine long term care\nservice use by African American, Hispanic, and White older\ndisabled persons. They find that race/ethnicity is a significant\nfactor affecting utilization patterns. They examine use of in-\nhome (home health, meals-on-wheels), community social\nservices, and nursing home care. Their models include mea-\nsures of predisposing characteristics (sex, age), enabling\ncharacteristics (income, live alone, nursing home attitudes,\nuse of the three alternative services), need factors (cognitive\nand ADL impairments, number of illnesses, unmet needs),\nand dummy variables for race/ethnicity. In these models,\nMui and Burnette (1994) find that African American older\npersons are 18% less likely to use in-home care services and\n82% less likely to use nursing homes than non-Hispanic\nWhite older persons. No statistically significant racial dif-\nferences were found in the use of community social services.\nLong-Term Care Channeling Evaluation to document the\nfactors that influence the use of paid and volunteer home\nhealth services, and also informal support services. Included\nin the regression model are dummy variables for race/eth-\nnicity and variables measuring formal care availability, need\n(ADL disabilities, incontinence, cognitive/behavior prob-\nlems), and other demographic characteristics. Kemper's re-\nsults indicate a statistically significant role of race/ethnicity,\nwith African Americans and Hispanics less likely to use\nhome health services and more likely to use family informal\nsupport services.\nWallace, Levy-Storms, Kingston, and Andersen (1998)\nuse data from the nursing home and community-based sam-\nples of the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey to\nexamine racial patterns of long term care utilization. Their\nmodels predict nursing home use, paid home care use (with\nno nursing home use), and unpaid home care use only (with\nno nursing home or paid home care use), using measures of\npredisposing, enabling, and need variables. African Ameri-\ncans are less likely than non-Latino Whites to use nursing\nhomes and paid home care services.\nIn contrast, Wolinsky and Johnson (1991) examine older\npersons' use of formal and informal health services, includ-\ning nine measures of utilization. The three informal mea-\nsures are: bed disability days taken, number of bed disabil-\nity days, and number of home health services utilized. The\nformal services are physician contact, physician visits, hos-\npital contacts, and hospital visits. Two additional measures\nof formal service used are whether the respondent entered\nthe nursing home or died in the last two years of the Longi-\ntudinal Study on Aging (LSOA). The independent variables\nare measures of predisposing characteristics (including\nmeasures of multigenerational families, kin and nonkin sup-\nports, health worries, health control), and enabling and need\ncharacteristics. In addition, six interaction terms of race\nwith health needs are included. Race (Black) was entered in\neach regression and found insignificant. However, several\nrace interaction terms are significant: Among those with\nADLs limiting household activities and upper body limita-\ntions, Blacks are more likely to use home health services.\nBlacks with advanced ADLs are less likely to have a physi-\ncian contact than Whites with the same limitation. Blacks\nwho need help with basic ADLs have more physician visits\nthan Whites. Hospital contact is more likely for Blacks with\nADLs that limit household activities and less likely for\nBlacks with lower body and upper body limitations.\nMiller and colleagues (1996), use data from three na-\ntional sources (Supplement on Aging [1984], National Long\nTerm Care Survey [1984], and National Medical Expendi-\nture Survey [1987]) to examine the coefficient on a race\ndummy variable in logistic regression models of use of\nhome-based services, senior centers, and all community ser-\nvices. For comparability among data sets, only those per-\nsons who are age 70 or older were studied. The independent\nvariables are measures of predisposing characteristics (fam-\nily composition and household structure), enabling condi-\ntions (income and insurance), and need (health and func-\ntional limitations). In all cases, Miller and colleagues (1996)\nfind the coefficients reflecting the log-odds of race statisti-\ncally insignificant. The authors state that previously docu-\nmented racial disparities were possibly due to income dis-\nparities. Because ethnic minority populations are more\nlikely to have Medicaid coverage and the log-odds ratio for\nMedicaid was significant, researchers note that they have\ncaptured race effects in this variable. Thus, they conclude\nthat because Medicaid enhances access to care, it leads to\nequality in access. Aday, Fleming, and Anderson (1984)\nhave presented similar documentation of equitable access to\nhealth care.\nOne consistent finding in the literature is that Blacks are\nless likely to use nursing home services. This conclusion is\nreached in models that include dummy variable measures of\nrace. Another consistent finding is that race dummy vari-\nables are statistically insignificant in models of social and\ncommunity services. The research that identifies race pat-\nterns in the use of physician and hospital services either\nidentifies these differences based on the magnitude of the\ncoefficients in models that are stratified by race/ethnicity or\nbased on the use of race interaction terms. There are con-\ntrasting findings regarding race in models of paid in-home\ncare, even in studies that use the same data sources. Race\ndummy variables are found statistically significant in some\nWallace, Levy-Storms, Kingston, & Andersen [1998]) and\ninsignificant in others (i.e., Miller et al. [1996] and Wolin-\nsky & Johnson [1991]). However, Wolinsky and Johnson\n(1991) find significant race interaction effects in paid in-\nhome care models.\nDifferences in the reported effects of race among re-\nsearchers who use the same data is an unexpected finding.\nHowever, differences in methodological strategies may\npartly explain these equivocal results. For example, using\nthe 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey, Miller and\ncolleagues (1996) find a dummy variable measure of race\ninsignificant and Wallace and colleagues (1998) find it sig-\nnificant. One important distinction between the two studies\nis the age of persons in the study samples. Miller and associ-\nThis sampling difference has significant implications for the\nstudy of race. Due to the relatively higher mortality rates of\nBlacks, particularly Black men, the gender composition of\nthe sample of Black older persons who are age 70 and older\nis quite different from one that includes persons age 65 and\nolder.\nA second methodological strategy that may explain dif-\nferences in the reported findings is the inclusion of different\nsamples. Miller and colleagues (1996) use a community\nsample of disabled older persons whereas Wallace and asso-\nciates (1998) use a sample of institutionalized and noninsti-\ntutionalized older persons. Because Blacks are less likely to\nbe institutionalized, this sampling difference may possibly\nexplain why Wallace and colleagues (1998) found race sig-\nnificant and Miller and coworkers (1996) did not.\nPrevious research, particularly Wolinsky and Johnson\n(1991), informs that use of a dummy variable that indicates\nrace may not fully explain the relationship between race and\nservice utilization. It is possible that a race dummy variable\ncan be insignificant while a race interaction term may be\nsignificant. Whereas research that includes race interaction\nterms informs how race influences the use of particular ser-\nvices, it is unclear whether these utilization patterns are as-\nsociated with experiences of no-care zones or service gaps\nin care and a corresponding inability of elderly persons to\nfunction at maximum capacity.\nOne major limitation for all researchers who want to un-\nderstand the role of race in affecting health services use is\nlack of data that explicitly measure culture and experiences\nof discrimination. These are excluded variables that reflect\nracial phenomenon and are correlated with included mea-\nsures. Their exclusion potentially biases the reported coeffi-\ncients of included variables.\nThis paper extends the existing literature by examining\nthe factors that influence use of specific community based\nservices. I reexamine patterns in the utilization of commu-\nnity long-term care services, using both bivariate and multi-\nvariate analysis strategies. The database for this research is\nthe 1989 National Long Term Care Survey, a database de-\nsigned to understand the health and formal and informal ser-\nvice use of disabled elderly persons. I present descriptive\nstatistics on the types of community medical services used\nby disabled elderly persons, providing racial comparisons. I\ncontrast these medical utilization patterns with racial com-\nparisons of levels of health and find that Black elderly per-\nsons are more likely to report medical conditions and less\nlikely to report medical utilization.\nLogistic regressions are presented in models that include\nrace dummy variables and models that are stratified accord-\ning to race. Chow tests and an Oaxaca decomposition pro-\nvide further insight into the reasons that there are racial dif-\nferences. The Chow test examines the role of race interaction\nvariables. The Oaxaca decomposition examines the poten-\ntial role of culture and discrimination, using a data set that\ndoes not include explicit measures of either variable. The\npaper concludes with a discussion of the implications of\nthese findings for future research and public policy.\nMETHODS\nData\nThe data source for this analysis is the National Long\nTerm Care Survey (NLTCS), 1989. It is the third wave of a\nnationally representative data base that identifies survey\nparticipants from Medicare rolls and is designed to describe\nchronically disabled elderly persons. The data are sponsored\nby the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and\nEvaluation (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services),\nthe Health Care Financing Administration, and the Bureau\nof Census (U.S. Department of Commerce). In 1989, the\nNLTCS questioned 5,817 older persons who were (a) inter-\nidentified in previous survey periods and were not inter-\nviewed because they did not meet the age and disability cri-\nteria at that time, but met them in 1989; or (c) newly identi-\nfied in 1989 and met the survey's age and disability criteria\nin 1989. Respondents met the disability criteria if they had\nADL or IADL impairments that were chronic, that is, last-\ning or expected to last 90 days or longer. Respondents were\npersons aged 65 and older.\nI use a subsample of this data set for this paper's analysis.\nI include Black and White elderly persons who were living\nin the community (not institutionalized) during the survey\ndisabled elderly persons. Survey respondents provided de-\ntailed information on their medical conditions and physical\nlimitations, health insurance, financial status, medical utili-\nzation, and informal in-home assistance received from fam-\nily and friends.\nRegression analysis strategy.--To examine the relative\ninfluence of health conditions and financial resources on ra-\ncial patterns of community long-term care services, I esti-\nmate several regression models. First, I estimate ten models\nof community services utilization by elderly persons. Next,\neach service utilization model is reestimated and includes\nthe independent variables of the previous models and a\ncomplete set of interaction terms of race with each indepen-\ndent variable of the model. Finally, each race interaction\nterm is entered in each of the ten regression models sequen-\ntially, to examine its independent influence on the regres-\nsions.\nEach regression model includes at least 26 independent\nvariables. The regression models that include these vari-\nables and also a complete set of interaction terms have a to-\ntal of 51 independent variables. The sheer size of this set of\nindependent variables potentially raises a concern about\npossible overfitting of the models. The standard rule of\nthumb in event history analysis is that there must be at least\nten events (the lesser number of persons with or without the\ncondition/service use) per independent variable. If the rule\nof thumb is met, (a) regression coefficients are less likely to\nbe biased in both positive and negative directions; (b) sam-\nple variances are less likely to be biased in both positive and\nnegative directions; and (c) the probability of significance in\nthe wrong direction is reduced (Peduzzi, Concato, Kemper,\nfor each of the ten basic models of service utilization with\n26 independent variables. The ten regression models that\nalso include a 27th variable, that is, an interaction term with\nrace and one of the 26 independent variables, require 270\nevents. The full interaction models (with 51 independent\nvariables) require 510 events. Tables 3 and 4 report the\nnumber of events for each of the regression models. Most of\nthe basic 26 term additive models and models with the sin-\ngle interaction (27th) term meet the rule of ten. The excep-\ntions are emergency room, dental, foot doctor, optometrist,\nand therapist visits, and also the stratified regression of phy-\nsician visits for Black elderly persons. These equations are\nalso the ones that do not meet the rule of ten for the full in-\nteraction models.\nThe NLTCS (1989) includes fourteen noninstitutional-\nized, formal community services that disabled elderly persons\ntypically use: paid in-home caregiver, physical therapist,\noccupational therapist, speech therapist, hearing therapist,\nmental health professional, dentist, foot doctor, optometrist,\nchiropractor, emergency room, home visit by a physician,\nvisit to a physician's office, and prescription medicine. Due\nto inadequate variability in the measures of use of mental\nhealth professionals, chiropractors, and home visits by phy-\nsicians, I do not estimate regressions of these types of ser-\nvice use. To measure use of therapist services, I develop a\nmeasure that equals one if any type of therapist services is\nreceived.\nOur ten regression models include eight models that ex-\namine use of specific community services: (a) whether there\nis at least one compensated family or community caregiver;\n(b) whether there is use of at least one therapist; (c) whether\nthere is at least one visit to a dentist; (d) whether there is at\nleast one visit to a foot doctor; (e) whether there is at least\none visit to an optometrist; (f) whether there is at least one\nvisit to an emergency room; (g) whether there is a visit to a\nphysician's office; and (h) whether prescription medications\nare bought or obtained. The other two regression models are\n(i) whether there was a need to see a physician and no visit\nwas made and (ii) whether the elderly person had a usual\nsource of care. All ten regression models are estimated us-\ning a binomial logistic regression procedure.\nThe regression models include measures of medical con-\nditions and disabilities, a measure of household income,\nhealth insurance status, regional and rural residence, whether\nunpaid caregivers provide in-home services, and sociodemo-\ngraphic measures. I describe these variables in more detail\nin Table 1, with means reported by race.\nRESULTS\nHealth and Medical Care\nTable 1 reports the means for various community ser-\nvices used by disabled elderly persons, according to race.\nThe data for the subsample used in this analysis are\nweighted to produce national cross-sectional estimates of\nmedical use according to race. The patterns of service utili-\nzation of Blacks and Whites are similar, with several key\nexceptions. Disabled White elderly persons are more likely\nto receive therapist services (particularly those of a physical\ntherapist), as well as dental and chiropractor services. Dis-\nabled Black elderly persons are more likely to lack a usual\nsource of care. Disabled White elderly persons obtain more\nprescriptions and have a greater chance of receiving ser-\nvices in the emergency room than disabled Black elderly\npersons. In this 1989 data base, bivariate analysis indicates\nthat statistically significant differences exist in the commu-\nnity care of disabled Black and White elderly persons, with\nBlacks less likely to receive the care.\nMedical care services are not consumer goods purchased\nfor the direct satisfaction that they yield. Rather, disabled older\npersons have consumed them to generate/monitor changes\nin health conditions, leading to improvements or stabiliza-\ntion of their health status. Are disabled Black elderly per-\nsons receiving fewer services because they are less in need\nof care? Table 1 also reports respondents' medical condi-\ntions, according to race. Consistent with reports in previous\nresearch, the sample of disabled Black elderly persons report\nmore incidences of medical conditions and disabilities than\nWhites. Disabled Black elderly persons are significantly more\nlikely to report problems with joints, glaucoma, diabetes, high\nblood pressure, and cognitive disorders. Disabled White eld-\nerly persons are significantly more likely to report neurolog-\nical problems, cancer, and broken bones. We found no sta-\ntistically significant differences in reports of heart problems,\nstroke, or breathing disorders. Disabled Blacks are more\nlikely to have difficulty eating, getting in and out of bed,\nand getting dressed. A report of three or more limitations in\ninstrumental activities of daily living is more likely for Black\nelderly persons than White elderly persons.\nThese data suggest that disabled Black elderly persons\nshould have greater medical utilization than disabled White\nelderly persons. However, the reported health conditions in\nTable 1 are associated with lower medical services utiliza-\ntion among disabled Black elderly persons.\nTable 2 presents the data in Table 1 in a different way. It\nreports service use according to medical condition and race.\nThis strategy seeks to control for the influence of reported\nmedical conditions and investigate whether chronically dis-\nabled Black and White elderly persons with similar health\nstatus have similar monthly use of medical services. For\nmost medical conditions and limitations in activities of\ndaily living, Black elderly persons use significantly fewer\nprescription drugs than White elderly persons. Table 2 re-\nports a consistent pattern of statistically significant racial\ndifferences in therapist services. With one exception (for\nstroke patients), disabled Black elderly persons are less\nlikely to use therapist services than White elderly persons.\nGreater use of the emergency room among disabled\nTable 1.

In those instances White elderly persons are\nmore likely than Black elderly persons to have a paid care-\ngiver. Similarly, statistically significant racial differences\noccur in reports of a need to see a doctor yet not seeing one\namong disabled elderly persons with nerve and heart condi-\ntions and those with bathing limitations. Only for the later\ntwo health states are disabled Black elderly persons more\nlikely not to seek care when they need it.\nExamining particular diseases and racial patterns of ex-\npected service utilization is also informative. Among glaucoma\npatients, one would expect significant use of optometrists'\nservices. White elderly glaucoma patients are significantly\nmore likely to visit optometrists than Black elderly glau-\ncoma patients. Diabetes requires frequent monitoring by\nphysicians and podiatrists; yet, Black elderly patients are\nless likely to visit podiatrists. Hypertension is commonly\ntreated with prescription medications; White elderly patients\nwith this diagnosis have greater use of prescription medi-\ncine than their Black counterparts. Recovery from strokes is\nfacilitated by the use of therapists' services; however, White\nelderly stroke patients are less likely to have therapist visits\nand more likely to visit the emergency room than Black eld-\nerly patients. This racial pattern is possibly related to racial\ndifferences in survival from strokes, with White elderly stroke\npatients being more likely to report an \"old\" stroke. When\nelderly patients have cognitive conditions and ADLs, the\nservices of a paid caregiver provide essential support. White\nelderly patients are more likely than Black elderly patients\nto have a paid caregiver when they have been diagnosed\nwith a cognitive condition or have difficulty with toileting.\nRacial patterns in use of medical services are prevalent\namong disabled elderly persons with the same medical con-\nditions and disabilities. When statistically significant differ-\nences in utilization occur, in most instances, they are associ-\nated with Black elderly persons having lower use of medical\nservices. What explains these patterns of medical utilization\namong chronically disabled older persons? Are they prima-\nrily due to differences in financial resources? For this sur-\nvey sample, the mean household income for disabled White\nelderly persons is about $15,211; the mean for disabled\nBlack elderly persons is about $9,196. While Medicare in-\nsures most respondents (97% for Whites and 94% for\nBlacks), significant differences exist in the other types of in-\nsurance coverage acquired by disabled elderly persons.\nMedicaid insures almost half (41%) of noninstitutionalized\ndisabled Black elderly persons and about 13% of disabled\nWhite elderly persons. More than 70% of disabled White eld-\nerly persons have private insurance supplements and only\n31% of disabled Black elderly persons report such coverage.\nUtilization of Community Services\nIn Table 3 I report the results for the ten regression models,\neach including a race dummy variable. The race dummy\nvariable is statistically significant in only one model: pre-\nscription medication use. Black elderly persons were signifi-\ncantly (at the .0001 level) less likely to obtain prescriptions.\nThe regression analysis includes a sample that is smaller\nthan the total sample of Black and White older persons in\nthe data base. This is primarily due to a typical pattern in\nsurvey research, where there are missing data on family in-\ning). The typical pattern is for persons at the upper and\nlower ends of the income distribution to be less likely to re-\nport their incomes and education or both. Thus, there are\nnonrandom and systematic patterns of data loss that we ad-\ndress by list-wise deletion of all observations for which data\nare missing. Although the list-wise deletion procedure re-\nsults in a loss of statistical power, it has been found to lead\nto accurate parameter estimates in cases where no more than\nzer, Roth, & Switzer, 1998). The regressions presented in\nthis paper meet this criteria.\nHealth conditions were the primary determinants of use\nof community services in each of the ten regression models\nreported in Table 3. The only health condition that was in-\nsignificant in each of the ten regression models was stroke.\nThe variable, cognitive problems, was significant in only\none regression model, where respondents needed to see a\nphysician but did not. The presence of cognitive problems\nincreased the likelihood that a physician was not seen.\nThose who were more likely to have a usual source of care\nwere elderly persons with high ADLs, and heart and hyper-\ntension problems. Use of the emergency room was more\nlikely when elderly persons had diabetes, heart problems,\nbroken parts, or breathing problems. Physician visits were\nmore likely for those with joint, heart, and breathing prob-\nlems and for those with diabetes, hypertension, and broken\nparts. In addition to those with cognitive problems, those\nwith joint, heart, and breathing problems had higher proba-\nbilities of not seeing a physician although one was needed.\nThe only health conditions that did not influence use of\nprescriptions were cognitive problems, stroke, and broken\nparts. Only one statistically significant health condition, the\ninteraction term of high ADLs with number of IADLs, was\nnegatively related with the probability of prescription medi-\ncation use.\nHaving a paid caregiver was more likely for elderly per-\nsons with high ADLs or IADLs, yet somewhat less likely\nfor those with both high ADLs and IADLs. The only health\ncondition that significantly affected the probability of use of\na dentist was the number of IADLs; with more IADLs there\nwas a lower probability of a dental visit. Those with joint\nproblems and diabetes were more likely to visit a foot doc-\ntor. Hypertension and the joint presence of high ADLs and\nIADLs decreased the likelihood of a visit to an optometrist,\nwhile glaucoma, joint problems, and diabetes increased the\nlikelihood of a visit. Therapist visits were more likely\namong those with high ADLs and broken parts.\nIt is also interesting to note the role of the enabling fac-\ntors income and insurance as factors affecting the likelihood\nof using community services. Income was positively associ-\nated with the likelihood of a usual source of care and physi-\ncian, dental, and foot doctor visits. Higher income de-\nTable 3.

Insurance coverage\nby Medicaid increased the likelihood of having a paid care-\ngiver, yet decreased the likelihood of having a usual source\nof care and not seeing a physician when one needs to visit.\nThose who were insured by Medicare only were less likely\nto have a usual source of care, use prescription medications,\nand visit a dentist.\nSomewhat surprising is the finding that the variables un-\npaid ADL and IADL caregivers were only statistically sig-\nnificant in the paid caregiver regression model. The results\nsuggest that both unpaid ADL caregivers and unpaid IADL\ncaregivers are substitutes for paid caregivers and thus de-\ncrease the likelihood of having a paid caregiver. Although\nrural residents are less likely to visit the dentist or foot doctor,\nthey are more likely to see a physician when one is needed.\nBased on the findings of the above models, it is tempting\nto conclude that race does not influence the use of commu-\nnity medical services, with the exception of prescription\nmedication use. To further explore the role of race in influ-\nencing community medical services utilization, we perform\na Chow test and also explore the interactive effect of race.\nThe Chow test (a chi-square test of differences in intercepts\nand slopes) assesses whether every independent variable in\nthe regression model affects Black and White elderly per-\nsons differently (Chow, 1960). That is, it tests for the stabil-\nity of the regression coefficients and whether they are not\nthe same for Black and White older persons. The Chow test\nis a very stringent test of the role of race because race must\nbe found to interact significantly with every independent\nvariable in the model in order to accept the hypothesis of the\ntest. The full interaction model (on which the Chow test is\nbased) and models that test for the interactive effect of race\nwith respect to a subset of the independent variables, as-\nsume that models which include race dummy variables only\nmay produce biased estimates for all coefficients. This is\nbecause they exclude significant variables (race interaction\nterms) that are correlated with the variables that are in-\ncluded in the model. Furthermore, when the correct specifi-\ncation of the regression model is one that includes interaction\nterms, the estimated variance of the regression coefficients\nin the models with only race dummy variables will be lower\nthan those in the models with interaction terms.\nThe Chow test uses the entire sample of Black elderly\npersons and a reduced (random) sample of White elderly\npersons. This sample size adjustment is required due to the\ndiscrepancy in sample sizes for Blacks and Whites; the sam-\nple of White elderly persons is approximately seven times\nthat of Blacks. To perform the test of differences without\nadjusting for sample size differences would muddle the in-\nformation provided by the test. A chi-square test, performed\non two samples of equivalent size, neutralizes the system-\natic bias that is involved in the study design. Otherwise,\nwhen regression analyses are performed on the combined\nsamples of Whites and Blacks, the results for the combined\nsample will mirror those of the subsample population that is\ndisproportionately larger, that is, the White sample (White-\nMeans, 1995). The chi-square test assesses differences in\nuse of services by a representative 33% sample of White\nelderly persons (n  800) and the sample of Black elderly\npersons. The test statistic is the difference in 2*log-likeli-\nhood ratio for the regression that pools the Black and re-\nduced White sample (assuming the two racial groups are the\nsame) and the same statistic for a regression that assumes\nthe intercepts and slopes for the two groups are different.\nIn the chi-square test of differences for our regression\nmodels, there is not a statistically significant difference in\ncommunity service utilization by Blacks and Whites. The\ncritical value of the test statistic for our model was 124.34. I\nwhether there is at least one compensated family or commu-\nnity caregiver; (b) whether there is a visit to a physician's\noffice; (c) whether there was a need to see a physician and\nno visit was made; (d) whether there is at least one visit to a\ndentist; (e) whether there is at least one visit to a foot doc-\ntor; (f) whether there is at least one visit to an optometrist;\n(g) whether there is use of at least one therapist; (h) whether\nthe elderly person had a usual source of care; (i) whether\nthere is at least one visit to an emergency room; and (j)\nwhether prescription medications are bought or obtained,\nrespectively. Thus, we were unable to support the hypothe-\nsis that every factor examined in the regression model af-\nfected service utilization by Black and White elderly per-\nsons differently.\nAlthough the chi-square tests of differences did not indi-\ncate significant interactive effects of race for all variables in\nthe model, some individual variables had significant race in-\nteraction terms. Table 3 reports the results of the regression\nanalyses when race interaction terms are entered for every\nindependent variable of the model. A superscript (c) indi-\ncates that in such a model, the interaction term was positive\nand significant. Thus, being Black increases the probability\nof utilizing that particular service. A superscript (d) indi-\ncates that the interaction term was negative and significant,\nwith Blacks having a lower probability of service utiliza-\ntion. Table 3 also reports the results of regression analyses\nwhen each interaction term is entered separately and all oth-\ners are excluded. These results are provided for the reader's\ninformation, to compare with results found in the full inter-\naction model. A superscript (a) indicates that in such a\nmodel, the interaction term was positive and significant. A\nsuperscript (b) indicates that in such a model, the interaction\nterm was negative and significant.\nThe interactive models provide new and valuable infor-\nmation about the role of race in affecting service utilization.\nFirst, some interaction terms are significant when entered\nindividually and remain significant when all other interac-\ntion terms are added to the regression models. Other interac-\ntion terms are not significant when entered individually, yet\nare significant when all other interaction terms are added. A\nthird case is the interaction term that is significant when en-\ntered individually and insignificant when all other interac-\ntion terms are added. In the third case it is difficult to argue\nthat the identified relationship is not spurious and simply re-\nflecting a biased coefficient and standard error estimate\n(due to its correlation with another interaction term that\nshould be included in the model). Thus, the discussion of re-\nsults will primarily delineate the first two cases of signifi-\ncant interactive effects, that is, those with superscripts c or d.\nIn the usual source of care model, seven race interac-\ntion terms have significant effects. These are IADL, High\nADLIADL, rural, income, female, married, and educa-\ntion. Black older persons who have more IADLs, live in ru-\nral areas, have higher incomes and who are female are more\nlikely than their White counterparts to have a usual source\nof care. The joint presence of high ADLs and IADLs, more\nyears of formal education, and having a spouse lead Black\nolder persons to have lower probabilities of having a usual\nsource of care than their White counterparts. Black elderly\npersons who have heart conditions are less likely to have an\nemergency room visit than their White counterparts; those\nwho live in small cities in the North are more likely to have\nan emergency room visit than their White counterparts.\nBlack elderly women with more IADLs, joint problems, and\nhypertension are more likely to have physician visits. How-\never, Black elderly persons with glaucoma, who live in the\nMidwest, and have the joint presence of high ADLs and\nIADLs are less likely to have physician visits. Living in a\nrural area and having an unpaid IADL caregiver leads Black\nelderly persons to have a higher probability of seeing a phy-\nsician when needed compared with their White counter-\nparts.\nIn contrast to White elderly persons, Black elderly per-\nsons with breathing problems are less likely to have pre-\nscription medications; those who live in rural areas and\nsmall cities in the West are more likely to have prescription\nmedications. Black elderly persons who have joint problems\nare more likely to have a paid caregiver and those with an\nunpaid IADL caregiver are less likely to have a paid care-\ngiver, compared with their White counterparts. Black\nwomen who live in the Midwest are less likely to have den-\ntal visits. However, Blacks with broken parts or breathing\nproblems are more likely to visit foot doctors. IADLs, bro-\nken parts, breathing problems, and living in small cities in\nthe West increase the likelihood that Black elderly persons\nvisit the optometrist. Yet, Blacks who have glaucoma are\nless likely than their White counterparts to visit the optome-\ntrist. Finally, the interactive models indicate that Black eld-\nerly women are less likely than White elderly women to see\na therapist.\nAnother observation is important to note, although not re-\nported in Table 3: When the regression models for physi-\ncian and optometrist visits include all interaction terms, the\nrace dummy variable is significant and negative, with Black\nelderly persons less likely to have visits than their White\ncounterparts.\nTo what extent are racial differences in utilization of\nmedical services due to differences in average characteris-\ntics of Black and White elderly persons? To explore this\nquestion, I use a standard technique of labor economists and\ndemographers, the Oaxaca decomposition. This technique\ntypically is used to assess discrimination in labor market\nearnings (Oaxaca, 1973). I applied this technique to gain\ngreater understanding of the factors underlying racial pat-\nterns in medical use among elderly persons. The technique\nassumes that we can explain racial differences in the proba-\nbility of medical utilization as outcomes that occur due to\nracial differences in the average characteristics of Blacks\nand Whites (e.g., differences in income and insurance), and\ndue to factors excluded from the regression model. In labor\neconomic and demographic research, a key unmeasured ex-\ncluded variable is discrimination. Thus, labor economists\nand demographers usually attribute variation in labor mar-\nket outcomes that is not explained by differences in average\ncharacteristics of Blacks and Whites to discrimination. In\nmedical markets, the experience of discrimination is one of\nseveral key factors that researchers exclude in regression\nmodels of medical utilization.\nBased on an Oaxaca decomposition technique, we find\nthe answer to the question of whether racial differences in\nutilization of medical services are due to differences in av-\nerage characteristics of Black and White elderly persons by\ncalculating three probabilities: (a) the probability that White\nelderly persons will use a service, (b) the probability that\nBlack elderly persons will use a service, and (c) the proba-\nbility that White elderly persons will use a service (given a\nlevel of health and demographic characteristics that repre-\nsent those of the average Black elderly person). The differ-\nence in the first and third probabilities informs about the\nportion of the racial difference in medical use that is due to\nracial differences in characteristics. The difference in the\nsecond and third probabilities is the unexplained portion of\nthe racial difference in medical service use. The unex-\nplained racial difference may be due to unmeasured dimen-\nsions of availability, accessibility, and acceptability, such as\ndiscrimination, cultural preferences for different types of\ncare, skepticism about scientific medicine, and differences\nin physical proximity and transportation services.\nStratified logistic regression models were performed for\n(1) the use of prescription medicines and (2) physician vis-\nits. These regressions were used in the Oaxaca decomposi-\ntion analysis because in the previous regression analysis for\nprescription medicines and physician visits, the race dummy\nvariable was found negative and significant, suggesting that\nbelonging to the racial group, Black, has an independent in-\nfluence on the use of community medical services. The re-\ngressions are reported in Table 4. Based on these regres-\nsions, the predicted probability that an elderly person has at\nfor Black elderly persons. We first compare the probability\nthat White elderly persons will use prescriptions (given\ntheir own demographic characteristics) with the probability\nthat White elderly persons will use prescriptions (given the\ndemographic characteristics of Black elderly persons). The\nprobabilities are 83.1% and 86.4%, respectively, with a dif-\nference in the probabilities of 3.3%. This result indicates\nthat differences in the characteristics of Black and White\nelderly persons should lead Whites to have a probability of\nuse of prescription medicine that is 3.3% lower than that of\nBlacks. The difference in the probability that White elderly\npersons will use prescriptions (given the demographic char-\nacteristics of Black elderly persons) and the probability that\nBlack elderly persons will use prescriptions (given their\nown demographic characteristics) is 6.2%. This result re-\nflects the unexplained difference in use of prescriptions that\nis accounted for by racial differences in availability, acces-\nsibility, and acceptability. Thus, White elderly persons who\nhave demographic characteristics that characterize the typi-\ncal Black elderly person should experience a probability of\nprescription use that is 6.2% higher than Black elderly per-\nsons who have the same characteristics.\nThe Oaxaca decomposition also was performed using the\nlogistic regression model of visits to a doctor. Similar to the\nresults for the prescription medication model, the difference\nin the predicted probability of visits to the physician was\n3.1%, with White elderly persons having a higher probabil-\nity of physician use. From the Oaxaca decomposition we\nfind that racial differences in characteristics of White and\nBlack elderly persons should lead Whites to have a .05%\nlower probability of visits to a physician. Unexplained ra-\ncial differences in use of physicians lead the probability of\nphysician use to be 3.12% higher for White elderly persons,\ncompared with Black elderly persons. Thus, almost 100%\nof the racial difference in use of physician services is due to\nracial differences in availability, accessibility, and accept-\nability.\nDISCUSSION\nBlack elderly persons remain vulnerable in their ability to\nobtain health care services commonly used by disabled\nolder persons. Several key findings from this research sup-\nport this conclusion. First, we know that with similar medi-\ncal conditions, Black older persons are less likely to use ser-\nvices. Second, relying solely on the finding of a statistically\nsignificant race dummy variable as an indicator of racial\ndifferences in utilization of community services by disabled\nelderly persons, I conclude that Blacks are less likely to\nhave prescription medicines, visit physicians, or visit op-\ntometrists. Third, race interacts with some health condi-\ntions, geographical location, income, sex, education, marital\nstatus, and the use of unpaid IADL caregivers, or both. This\ninteraction decreases the likelihood that Black older persons\nuse some health care services and increases the likelihood\nthat they will use other health care services. Finally, the\nOaxaca decomposition indicates that race is not reducible to\na measure of socioeconomic status. Differences in personal\ncharacteristics of Black and White elderly persons do not\nfully explain racial differences in the use of medical ser-\nvices. The observed racial differences in personal character-\nistics should lead disabled White elderly persons to have a\nlower probability of use of prescription medicines and phy-\nsician services than disabled Black elderly persons. How-\never, disabled White elderly persons have a higher probabil-\nity of use of both services.\nThis paper addresses racial patterns of medical utilization\nby community-dwelling elderly patients. Use of institu-\ntional care is not examined. Wallace and associates (1998)\ndocument that Black elderly persons are less likely to be ad-\nmitted to nursing homes. Thus, many community-dwelling\nBlack elderly persons have poorer health than community-\ndwelling White elderly persons (Table 1). One would think\nthat this noninstitutional bias in the sample of community-\ndwelling Black elderly persons would be associated with\nTable 4.

However, this did not\noccur. Thus, I investigate whether the observed racial pat-\nterns are due to racial differences in sociodemographic\ncharacteristics and/or availability, accessibility, and accept-\nability of services.\nBy using the methodological strategy of comprehensive\nrace interaction terms (i.e., measures that interact race with\nincome and insurance, as well as interact it with other per-\nsonal characteristics of disabled elderly persons), I provide\nsome interesting and unexpected findings about racial dif-\nferences in predictors of medical service use. Although\nsome personal characteristics are associated with a lower\nprobability that Black older persons will use medical ser-\nvices, I also find that some personal characteristics enhance\nthe ability of disabled older Black persons to obtain medical\nservices. For example, living in rural areas and small cities\nincreases the likelihood that older Black persons will have\nprescriptions. Living in a rural area increases the likelihood\nthat older Black persons have a usual source of care and\nsmall city residence increases the likelihood that older\nBlack persons will visit optometrists. Residence in the West\nalso facilitates greater use of medical services by disabled\nolder Black persons. Women as a group are more likely to\nhave a usual source of care and to visit physicians. The in-\nteractive model indicates that disabled Black women are\nmore likely than their White counterparts to have these\ntypes of visits. Black elderly persons have greater probabili-\nties of medical service utilization when they have IADLs,\njoint and breathing problems, and broken parts.\nMy results exploring the role of race in influencing use of\npaid in-home care are similar to those of Wolinsky and\nJohnson (1991). I do not find a statistically significant coef-\nficient for the race dummy variable in this model. However,\nI find significant interactive effects. Black elderly persons\nwho have joint problems are more likely to have a paid in-\nhome caregiver than their White counterparts. However, if\nan unpaid IADL caregiver provides services in the home,\nBlack elderly persons are less likely than White elderly per-\nsons to have a paid in-home caregiver. This finding under-\nscores the importance of including race interaction terms to\nobtain a comprehensive understanding of the role of race in\naffecting medical service utilization among disabled elderly\npersons.\nOne intriguing finding was the role of rural residence for\nBlack elderly persons, compared with White elderly per-\nsons. With greater service availability in urban areas, I pre-\ndict that elderly persons who live in rural areas will have\nless use of services. Consistent with this prediction, I docu-\nmented that rural residents were less likely to visit the den-\ntist or foot doctor than their urban counterparts. However,\nrural residents were more likely to see a physician when one\nwas needed. The interactive results also indicate that among\nthe services that rural Black elderly persons are more likely\nto obtain are services of a usual source of care and prescrip-\ntion drugs. They are more likely to receive these services\nthan their urban counterparts and White elderly persons\nwho live in urban and rural areas. Rural Black elderly per-\nsons also are less likely than rural White elderly persons to\nreport that they didn't see a physician, but needed one.\nBlack elderly persons who live in rural areas are no more\nlikely than their urban counterparts to have a paid caregiver\nor receive services from a dentist, foot doctor, optometrist,\ntherapist, emergency room, or a physician. More study is\nneeded of the context of care in rural areas and small cities\nto understand the strategies that are leading Black elderly\npersons in rural areas to have better access to care than\nWhite elderly persons and Black elderly persons who live in\nlarge urban areas.\nThe Oaxaca decomposition results indicate that racial dif-\nferences in health care access also occur due to factors typi-\ncally excluded from our standard regression models of med-\nical utilization. These include life course discrimination,\nreceipt of culturally insensitive medical care, residential\nsegregation and its implications for convenient use of medi-\ncal facilities, and information gaps about how different\nraces perceive disease patterns and healing. If researchers\ndo not consider these additional factors, disabled Black eld-\nerly persons may continue to face relatively more con-\nstraints in their use of health care services, particularly phy-\nsician services and prescription medications.\nTo some extent it is difficult to disentangle the indepen-\ndent and interactive effects of discrimination, culture, per-\nceptions of racism, geographic segregation, and physical\nproximity of medical facilities as they contribute to explain-\ning a large part of the racial difference in medical services\nuse by disabled elderly persons. The role that discrimination\nand racism play in the use of medical services is currently a\ntopic of investigation, primarily in studies that use small\nsearch indicates that racial differences in elderly Black per-\nsons' use of medical care are not primarily due to cultural\nfactors. Rather, residential segregation and racial discrimi-\nnation in the medical care system explain them, as well as\nthe class factors associated with the profit motive of the\nhealth care system. The closure, relocation, and flight of\nhospitals and medical providers from low income neighbor-\nhoods where elderly Black persons live have led to racial\ndisparities in access to care. In addition, racial differences in\nthe intensity of care and profit-centered motives to mini-\nmize the number of Medicaid patients treated account for\nfurther racial disparities in care (Charatz-Litt, 1992). In a\ncase study of metropolitan elderly persons in Missouri,\nWallace (1990a) found that racial prejudice was one factor\nthat made in-home services undesirable even for older per-\nsons with severe health problems. Cultural differences and\ncultural insensitivity may influence medical treatment when\nthere is poor communication between providers and patients\nabout descriptions of pain, folk medicine, traditions, and\nviews of wellness or illness (Watson, 1994).\nThe research results presented in this paper use national\ndata and remind us that although we are in an era when we\nrepeatedly hear that discrimination no longer exists nor\nneeds a remedy, it may nonetheless contribute significantly\nto racial differences in the use of a vital necessity of life. At\na minimum, this study suggests that ethnogeriatric curricula\nin health professional schools and race conscious efforts in\nplanning and provision of medical services are two proac-\ntive strategies to mitigate racial differences in the receipt of\nmedical services that are commonly used by disabled older\nPublic policy that focuses on enhancing health insurance\ncoverage will provide a remedy for increasing the probabil-\nity of use of prescription medications. Enhanced insurance-\nfinanced access to prescription drugs is currently promoted\nby Senator Kennedy and the Democratic party. They pro-\npose a $200 deductible and a 20% copayment by elderly\npersons for their prescription medications, thus establishing\na Medicare prescription drug benefit. The regression results\nclearly illustrate the benefits of such a policy change. In the\nprescription drug model that includes the race dummy vari-\nable (Table 3) and in the stratified models (Table 4) I note\nthat those insured solely by Medicare are less likely to use\nprescription medications than those insured by Medicaid or\nMedicare and private insurance supplements. A Medicare\nprescription drug benefit would provide those covered by\nMedicare only with coverage comparable to Medicaid and\nprivate insurance supplements.\nOur results also illustrate that there are race-specific pol-\nicy implications of such a policy change. In the stratified\nprescription drug models (Table 4), coverage by Medicare\nonly is statistically significant for both Black and White\nolder persons, with coverage decreasing the probability of\nprescription drug use. However, Black older persons are\nmore likely (31%) than White older persons (18%) to have\ncoverage by Medicare only. Thus, this insurance policy\nchange disproportionately benefits Black older persons,\nthose who are currently less likely to use prescription medi-\ncines.\nIn contrast, the Breaux-Thomas Medicare Reform Pro-\nposal introduces some policy changes that may dispropor-\ntionately disadvantage White older persons. In addition to\nproviding a new benefit package, reformed Medicare would\ninclude higher copayments on some services, higher deduct-\nibles on Part B service use, and premium protection for low\nincome elderly persons. Many older persons may perceive\nhigher deductibles and copayments as reductions in Medi-\ncare coverage. The significant Medicare-only coefficient in\nthe stratified physician visit regression for White older per-\nsons only suggests that these changes may decrease use of\nphysician services among White older persons only. In ad-\ndition, because Black older persons have significantly less\nincome than White older persons (Table 1), a race-specific\npolicy implication of the Breaux-Thomas Premium Support\nProgram is that Black older persons will be more likely to\nreceive this enhanced benefit.\nSimilar to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Breaux-\nThomas Medicare Reform Proposal emphasizes competi-\ntion among health plans (especially HMOs) for Medicare\nbeneficiaries. States are moving forward in their implemen-\ntation of managed long-term care due to budget shortfalls\nand an average 12% growth rates of the Medicaid program,\nprojected insolvency of the federal Medicare program, and a\nprojected increase of 23% in the population aged 85 and\nolder. According to the research findings, these policy changes\nmay also have race-specific implications. The Kaiser Com-\nmission on the Future of Medicaid's review of more than\n100 published studies in the literature indicated that it is not\npossible to conclude whether managed care has maintained\na balance of containing cost and providing quality health\ncare services (Kaiser Family Foundation's Commission, 1995).\nManaged care may increase access to care among under-\nserved Black elderly persons through its integration of care\ndelivery and financing. Alternatively, it may facilitate the\ncontinuance of historical discrimination and lead to new\nforms of discrimination against elderly patients who are\nmore costly to treat, that is, community-dwelling disabled\nBlack elderly persons (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). A third al-\nternative is that managed care may decrease overutilization\nof services by disabled White elderly persons and have no\neffect on utilization by Blacks.\nFrom the Oaxaca decomposition analysis we learn that\ndisabled White elderly persons have greater access to medi-\ncal services and (given their personal characteristics) should\nuse less services than Blacks. It is possible to interpret this\ngreater access by Whites as overutilization that managed\ncare may correct. Due to their greater dependency on Medi-\ncaid (Table 1), Black elderly persons will face a higher risk\nof reduced health care access if managed care facilitates his-\ntorical discrimination; and a higher probability of enhanced\nhealth care access if managed care facilitates coordination\nof service use.\nThe central finding of this research is that race matters in\nthe use of community services among disabled older per-\nsons and in the implications of health policy changes. The\ngeneral consensus in the literature is that when a race\ndummy variable is significant, we know that race has an im-\nportant and unique role in influencing the use of community\nservices. This article also shows that even when a race\ndummy variable is not significant, race matters. There are\noften racial differences in the predictors of the use of medi-\ncal services. Further, these persistent racial differences are\nlikely (at least partly) a function of unmeasured racism.\nThus, public policy that focuses solely on health finance\nmay not remedy the existing racial disparities in health lev-\nels, a key factor affecting both the cost of health care and\nthe overall quality of life in our nation.\n"
