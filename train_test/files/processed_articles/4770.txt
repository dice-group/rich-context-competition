In an effort to deconstruct the `language politics' of PM,\nDabrock emphasises that the use of the term personhood, `(even more so than \"individu-\nality\")' for `a natural-scientific technique of differentiation, can under no circumstances\nbe seen as even remotely innocent'. Personhood `at least in the broad stream of the tradi-\ntion comprising trinitarian theology, personalism, phenomenology, and social psychol-\nogy--develops only in social togetherness'.2 The currently successful occupation of the\nterm `person', however, may well indicate that such `classical horizons of philosophical-\ntheological anthropology' have somewhat `begun to darken'.3 No matter how clinically\neffective, PM presents an anthropological challenge. An unbroken enthusiasm around\nPM augurs further transformations for medicine and the public healthcare system,\nresearch agendas and clinical consultations.4 In some quarters a post-hype hangover has\nalso set in. Meanwhile, health service commissioners are expected to `deliver' to meet\ngrowing patient expectations.5\nIn this article I argue that at least two fundamentally different notions of personhood\nare at work in the public debate on PM which require discernment. The first centres on\npatients' individuality, which PM promises to heed more than ever. However, if person-\nhood is reduced to this, then the in-dividuum is effectively deeply divided, which\nexplains several unsavoury side-effects of present-day PM. This notion of the person is\nin many ways a fiction, albeit a powerful one. In connection with PM it functions as a\nlever, for example to further dismantle socialised healthcare and the fabric of solidarity\nunderlying it.6\nDrawing on the work of John Zizioulas, Eberhard J\u00fcngel and others, I then explore,\nsecond, a theologically grounded existential phenomenology of personhood. Instead of\ntwo divided substances, the person is in two distinct, but not divided, modes of being: the\nbiological and the trans-individual or social mode. The person is an intrinsically\n7. Cf.

One implication is that personhood only unfolds throughout time. This\nentails the specific movement of medicine: as disease and death threaten to irreversibly\ndivide the person, the medical act aids the restoration of a person's always precarious\ndistinction-in-unity of the social and biological.\nThese two anthropologies imply a significant practical distinction: on the one hand an\nenthusiastic, hyped, but ultimately fruitless PM--what I call `enthusiastic PM' (EPM)--\nand on the other hand a sobered-up personalised medicine (SPM) that is both instrumen-\ntal and effective. In order to introduce a way in which a sobered-up PM can work, I\noperationalise the ethics of war as a set of criteria for interpreting and incorporating PM\ninto a regular medical practice adequate for persons.\nEnthusiastic Personalised Medicine (EPM)\nWhat Ingrid Slade calls the `advocacy-based' understanding of PM brings together sev-\neral strands of thought: the idea that persons are individuals, biological substances, and\nthe result of their genetic make-up. This understanding has a long, complicated trajec-\ntory, which can only partly be sketched out here.\nA Substantivist, Individualist Notion of the Person\nThe person as an ontological individual goes as far back as Boethius' sixth-century\nreflection on the person of Christ: persona est naturae rationalis individua substantia--\nthe person is an individual (metaphysical) substance with a rational nature, i.e. a `self-\nstanding singularity'. `With this',Adrian Holderegger highlights, `the person is no longer\ndefined by an act of being, which could be described as free, rational, or conscious, but\nrather by nature alone, whose specificum is then that it is also rational'.7\nBesides this substantivist background, the Cartesian turn towards subjectivity was a\nkey moment. For Descartes, the self was given in the mode of reflection as such; the\nthinking and the existing human being became identical. `With this, the re-connection of\nthe person to constitutive elements such as reason, individuality, and relation becomes\nmore difficult and intransparent. Here the \"person\" is no more than a bracket between\nbody and mind. Mind and body are distinct substances. They constitute a functioning\nunit which is guaranteed by the person'.8 Cartesian mechanistic physiology, popular well\ninto the nineteenth century, could merge well with John Locke's person as `self-con-\nscious, rational human being'.9 For Locke, there was no longer a need for metaphysical\n10.

The underpinnings of modern medicine\nand evolutionary theory lean heavily on these traditions, relying on their biological,\nmaterial(ist) sides. Most medical ethics textbooks today refer to J. S. Mill as a champion\nof individuals' autonomous consent and, based on self-ownership, their freedom from\nunwanted, paternalistic intervention.\nHowever, genomic medicine developed out of molecular biology, in vicinity to\nscientists seeking purely physical-chemical answers to humanity's `big questions'.\nFrom the 1950s onwards the quest for DNA coincided with a cultural fascination for\nscience fiction, not least under the dark cloud of nuclear threat. Outer space and the\ngenome established the `new frontiers' of humanity's (self-)conquest.10 As an indus-\ntry, biotech took off in the late 1970s with the growth of venture capitalism driven by\nthe increased value of marketable information.

Personalisation,\nprediction, prevention and participation (4P) are to replace `reactive medicine' as we\nknow it with `health maintenance'.16 Critique is seen as suspicious: anti-progressive and\nLuddite, it jeopardises Western countries' prospects in the global economic race.\n17.

Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung,\nThe Unhappy Dialectics of the Molecular Individual\nThe notion of `person' emerging in this what one might call enthusiastic personalised\nmedicine (EPM) is marked and haunted by a particular, problematic logic: the in-divid-\nual is deeply divided, to the point even of internal contradiction.\nThe first division or dualism consists in the reduction of personhood to molecular-\nbiological terms. Not the phenotypical person--the sick patient who, up until now, was\nsupposedly always given a `one-size-fits-all' treatment--but the altered genotype is the\ntruly unique person here. A `holistic' approach in this context has to extend the substan-\ntivist individual: complete knowledge of the person means more `omic' data. This\ndescriptive reduction sharply divides from other forms of personal encounter. In this\nsense, PM is not substantially different from, but a specific continuation of, biology-\noriented medicine as a whole. It `perpetuates a structural plane of immanence, which is\nbut an identical repetition of the same. Biology must reduce that which it describes to\nnothing, that is, nothing outside its descriptive abilities (DNA, etc.). This is the \"text\"\nwhich biology is, and this text has nothing outside it...'.17 In other words, the complete\n`literation'of life into codes and elements, the ancient stoicheia, simultaneously ob-liter-\nates life.18 Quite in this spirit, molecular medicine is believed to `transform ... everyday\nclinical practice from an empirical art to a rational ortho-molecular science'.19\nThis reduction of the person to a merely molecular object has been frequently criticised. For\nexample, Thomas Wabel noted the purely rational, autonomous coping strategies furthered by\nPM: the identification and analysis of diseases, the search for alternatives, and finally disease\nmanagement and control. However, `in these strategies--indispensable as they are--the body,\nthe physical condition for existence, becomes the object of analysis and action'. And: `To\nregard my body as the object of medical treatment, means to distance myself from the body\n(K\u00f6rper) I have'.20 Regarding predictive medicine, Christiane Woopen has similarly noted:\n`For the human being, his own body increasingly becomes an objectified entity, which he no\nlonger feels primarily to be an \"I\" in the sense of a unity of body and soul, but an \"It\" he has\nexamined and treated'.21 Overmedicalisation and overtreatment is the most overt result.\n22.

Here, even the Cartesian dualism championed by bio-\nmedical individualism is instable, because the material body as a mere `thing' and the\nautonomous will cancel each other out.As our genome is oddly everywhere and nowhere,\nthe body dissolves into data packages, or `network nodes', beyond the confines of its\nphysical boundaries--and control.22 Interacting with `risk factors' between health and\ndisease, the discursively objectified body then gains a new eerie, life-determining\nagency, undermining the very Cartesian inertness of the object: the `exposome' or other\n`omes' constantly redefine and extend the individual. As Conor Cunningham put it: `The\n\"cancer\" of my body is a world unto itself. My leg becomes apart from me, it grows as it\nre-narrates my body, in a manner of which Kafka would be proud. Our bodies come apart\nas knowledge rips them asunder, even though it may keep them intact.'23 In this context\nWoopen worries about overmedicalisation: `More and more tests are done, more and\nmore diseases are feared, the worries about health take on a growing space in people's\nconsciousness, in their responsibility and lifestyle.'24 Here, a new genomics-based life-\nstyle industry looms at the horizon--including vast opportunities for quackery.\nBut just as EPM's notion of the body oscillates between the biological object and a\nthreatening presence of (non-)disease or lifestyle-idol, so its autonomous (consumer-)will\nand Foucauldian `technologies of the self' paradoxically imply a new, subtle paternalism.\nBased on genetic prediction, EPM promises to enable patients to `actively own ... their\nhealthcare decisions'.25 More health data suggest more autonomy, (auto-)biographical con-\ntrol, better informed consent, effectively a `fully permissive medicine'ultimately guided by\npersonal preference.26 As the DNAsequence appears to chart out a particular life-course, the\nperson can leap ahead and retrospectively manage the present, adjusting their life according\nto genetic or other `-omic'parameters. Increased autonomy implies a self-abstraction prede-\ntermined by genetic diagnosis. The patient internalises the principle of private insurance.\nBut this autonomy immediately collapses into paternalist control and technological\n(self-)infantilisation, equipped with nudges, monitoring gadgets and apps.27 An increased\nresponsibilisation grounded in information-based autonomy implies intensified preven-\ntive compliance-regimes.\n28.

Cunningham, Genealogy of Nihilism, p. xii.\nThe more we know about predispositions through genetic testing, the more our health and our\ndiseases will seem to be results, products of our own actions, indeed products of our own will\n... In return, the person who is ill, will be confronted with the underlying question of why they\nbecame ill and, if not genetically advised, whether they could not have prevented the outbreak\nof the disease by taking a predictive genetic test. In this way, becoming ill will be moved into\nthe personal responsibility of the patient.28\nThis is particularly attractive to private insurance companies. Equipped with financial\n`soft' power, they may more intrusively mandate less cost-intensive lifestyles.29\nLooking at empirical research, Wabel noted a `dialectics of autonomy' also with\nregards to the doctor\u00adpatient relationship: `On the one hand, all additional informa-\ntion is helpful for making a rational choice in a situation of incomplete information,\nthereby increasing autonomy. On the other hand, interview studies have shown that,\nfor some patients, the possibility to choose is a burden rather than a benefit'.30 As\ndisease becomes more abstract and clinical specialisations once again fragment, cli-\nnicians' depth of control effectively increases. Yet they are depersonalised too, hand-\ning over patients from specialist to specialist in a minutely differentiated healthcare\nIn short: the `enthusiastic' version of Personalised Medicine appeals to and intensi-\nfies the substantivist, reductionist anthropology in which the in-dividual is paradoxi-\ncally marked by a logic of division: first, a division from a more than scientifically\nreduced understanding of the person; second, divided and contradicting internally.32\nIn other words, in the most enthusiastic versions of PM, personhood first becomes an\nimpossibility, and then we unsuccessfully oscillate between its two Cartesian con-\nstituents: our cherished autonomy, now the object of new regimes, and our body, no\nlonger the mere quiet functioning of the organs.33 Stable biological `thinghood' is an\noptical illusion.\n34.

At present, a retrospective attribution of responsibility for disease remains legally prob-\nlematic, since the disadvantaged are protected by welfare rights; this is less so the case in\nprivatised systems. Miriam Keil, Rechtsfragen der individualisierten Medizin (Berlin and\nTwo Ways Ahead: Further Reductionism, Mediate Paths\nOne next step has been to push molecular reductionism to its conclusion. As con-\nsciousness is increasingly mapped onto the brain, some neuro-philosophers have sug-\ngested `personhood' itself is a fiction.34 But if there are no persons, everything can be\na person, such as objects endowed with artificial intelligence. Business models con-\nnecting PM with the Internet of Things point in this direction.35 The moral imperative\nis to successfully enhance biological biographies as part of an overall evolutionary\nnarrative of humanity, a species within an overall networked flux of data.36 What\nlooms is a kind of post-patienthood for health `customers' and `service-users'. But\nmore `personal characteristics' in the form of data harbour less compassionate care on\nthe whole. Why not withdraw care from someone who has been negligent, despite\nknown genetic risk factors? With disease turning into a matter of moral judgment, the\ndark underbelly of EPM's autonomous individual is the hospital reject, the `human\ntrash' who deserves it.37\nThe divided logic of EPM's notion of the patient has also been countered by insisting\non a `mind\u00adbody unity'.38 But if transcendental agnosticism merely acknowledges that\nthere is a unity of soul and body, such insistence remains an inconsequential admonition,\nespecially in the absence of a definition of `soul'. Nonetheless, if we look at recent devel-\nopments in theological anthropology, personhood as more than a vague individual mind-\nbody unity has considerable consequences. If biology--and specifically genomic\nmedicine--is sublated into this logic of personhood, it can be understood and embraced\nas an improved tool.\n40. For Heidegger, anxiety arises from the advent of the nothing outside one's existence (Dasein);\nfor J\u00fcngel, who is the main reference point here, the advent is marked by a lingual event\nof truth allowing one to come to oneself outside oneself; cf. Arnold Neufeldt-Fast, `Martin\nHeidegger: Ansto\u00df for Eberhard J\u00fcngel's Theology', in R. David Nelson (ed.), Indicative of\nalso Cunningham, Genealogy of Nihilism, p. 178.\n41. Cf. Ingolf U.

This is the stance\nof the joyful homo geneticus in glossy prospectuses. But a significant amount of anxiety\nlurks in this vision: the frightening, abysmal option of death, which is a mere (or sheer)\nabyssos, and the social stigma associated with disease, now a negligent lapse of mainte-\nnance. Unsurprisingly, the genomics and big-data hype cannot grasp these anxieties.\nPersonhood--Advent, Presence\nTo point at this abyss or indeed any kind of true lack in molecular-biological discourse is\nalready to make it merely an option. Heeding this abyss is to already move beyond it, the\ndoor through which personhood (re-)enters. It is to acknowledge in human persons `an\nexcessive moment that breaks free of immanent description',39 though far from invalidat-\ning the immanent. Put differently, the deficiencies of the genomics hype are not addressed\nby adding more data to the individual patient (for all we know, the Good Samaritan had\nno patient record of the man by the road). It is rather by going beyond the reductionist\nbiomedical stoicheia, into the abyss of death, suffering, failure, the hospital reject, the\nsupposedly `deserving'sick. It is to integrate such horrific non-existence into healthcare,\nthough not by merely `managing' it. This breaking-through of a being's excessiveness is\na moment of advent, the recognition of that which is outside in the middle of life, so that\nthe middle can truly become itself.40 On this assumption a reflection on humans as the\nimagines Dei becomes intelligible in the first place: human personhood through Christ's\nhuman\u00addivine personhood (through weakness and death risen to eternal life).41 In other\nwords, there is a `temporal infinitude', an intrinsic ex-cessiveness to the physical human\nthat questions them as mere information, even if that is very precious information.\nWith reference to historical theology John D. Zizioulas has influentially described such a\npre-Boethian understanding of personhood.42 As theologians were debating the Incarnation\nin the fourth century, the term hypostasis (mode of being) ceased to denote `substance' and\nbecame synonymous with `person'. Personhood came to be regarded as the foundation of\nbeing as such. It was no longer the fleeting attribute of an individual substance.43\n44. John D.

Personhood is a `movement\ntowards communion which leads to a transcendence of the boundaries of the self and\nthus to freedom'.44 Significantly, `the person in its ekstatic character reveals its being in\na catholic, i.e. integral and undivided [!], way, and thus in its being ekstatic it becomes\n... the bearer of its nature in its totality'.45 Persons are, and are `global' and truly them-\nselves in unbounded, free relations of love. This does not imply a collectivist eradication\nof the individual. Quite the contrary: personal ek-stasis is partly constitutive of meaning-\nful particularity and autonomy. In the final analysis, Zizioulas emphasises, that which\n`makes a particular personal being be itself--and thus be at all--is ... communion, free-\ndom and love'.46 Effectively, for Zizioulas, the fourth century replaced the ontology of\nsubstance with an `ontology of love'.\nFor Zizioulas, true personhood as a particular individual can only be achieved by\nGod, who is love, but whose particularity is established as the one person Incarnate in\nChrist. In other words: God is a particular being `not by virtue of its boundaries (he is\n\"incomprehensible\", \"indivisible\" etc.), but by its ekstasis of communion (he is eternally\nTrinity and love) which makes it unique and indispensable'.47 Precisely in this way\nhumans strive to become the imago Dei: to achieve full ekstasis, for `all to be in all'. This\nstriving forms the desire not only for seemingly `autonomous' mastery, but also the sus-\nceptibility to all kinds of hype. The intrinsically excessive notion of human personhood\nstarkly contrasts with the primary dualism of EPM's joyful Deleuzian reductionism. The\nactual presence of persons challenges a hermetically sealed biomedical discourse, with-\nout merely tick-boxing a `mind\u00adbody' unity.\nPersonhood--Absence\nNotably, the excessiveness of personhood does not tear asunder again the relational per-\nson and the material body. This conclusion is a recurrent problem in writings that conflate\nmedicine with pastoral, (church-)community care in an attempt to counter the alienating\ncoldness of modern, industrialised medicine.48 Rather than consisting again of two sepa-\nrate spheres or substances, the human person persists in two distinct yet inseparable\nmodes: what Zizioulas calls the `ecclesial mode' (i.e. the trans-individual, relational) and\nthe biological mode.

Death and dis-\nease are the ultimate threat to communion, freedom and love. The cadaver, the human\ncorpse is the only `thing' remaining, the true `individual'.49 Conversely, just because it\nattends to the person's biological mode, molecular medicine is not per se reductionist.\nPersonhood thus equally depends on a paradox, albeit one of presence and absence.\nThe person's catholicity or globality in relations of love may suggest transparent pleni-\ntude. But in reality there is of course also a hiddenness to persons that defies all surveil-\nlance, which is the result of patients'and observers'own limited bodies. To use a different\nanalogy: `The very fact of religions, cults, temples and rituals shows that the gods are not\npresent. For if they were we would live in cities without temples and churches as the seer\nof the revelation of John described the heavenly Jerusalem'.50 This absence\u00adpresence is\nnot least hinted at in Paul (1 Cor. 13:12): `For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we\nwill see face to face'--whereby prosopon (face) signified person. The full realisation of\npersonal presence (both human and divine) remains an eschatological problem.\nThe simultaneous ecstatic relationality and inaccessibility of persons resonate with\nexperience. It is impossible to `sum up'a person, for example after death. The person `is'\nin unrepeatable connections to others, who can only share their memories.51 What a per-\nson is for themselves remains opaque, to an extent also for themselves. Their true `sum'\nwould be all their relationships in the past, present and future, including the relationships\nof those too. This would require a kind of omniscience, but would result in no more than\njudgment. From this perspective, the aim of a truly `holistic' medicine raises grave con-\ncerns. Beyond logistic limits, it suggests either a reduced or a totalitarian understanding\nAt the same time, if one takes relationality-in-communion seriously, it becomes clear\nwhy Orthodox traditions could see each person as a theophany-in-humanity and corpo-\nrate identity.

Rather, one\nproves to be a neighbour (and person) by seriously attending to manifesting appearances.\nO'Donovan, `Again, Who is a Person?', p. 371.\n55. Beyond the metaphorical, a theological-systematic transferability between different `topical'\nor `applied' ethics may point to Rom. 12:1-8, or 1 Cor. 12:4-6. On the false enthusiasm (!)\nPaul addresses, see e.g. Hans Conzelmann, 1 Corinthians: A Commentary (Philadelphia, PA:\n56. Cf. Michael D\u00f6rnemann, Krankheit und Heilung in der Theologie der fr\u00fchen Kirchenv\u00e4ter\n(T\u00fcbingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2003); Bernhard Nausner, `The Medical Encounter as Communion:\n57. Critical: Austin L. Campbell, `Medical Manichaeism: Toward an Augustinian Intervention',\nindividuals, and simultaneously much less, as radically unavailable. Individuals can be\nconfined and as data packages handled like dispensable bulk goods (despite their unique\nDNA); such reduction or dissolution is hardly possible for persons. Moreover, dramatic\namplitude captures personhood as something emerging (e-venire). In being `advents',\npersons--again Christ-analogously--are also events, hence more significant than a mere\noccurrence or incidence. As health is lost and regained throughout life-time, humans are\nalways becoming persons, social `mind\u00adbody unities'.54 In other words: the dramatic\namplitude of persons as `much more' and `much less' unfolding through and becoming\nin time happens before a horizon of reconciliation, or personhood (re-)gained.\nSobering up Personalised Medicine\nQuite undramatically, this dramatic amplitude of the person provides the very logic that\nsobers up personalised medicine. In challenging the primary dualism underlying bio-\nmedical reductionism, personhood unfolding throughout time readjusts the divided dia-\nlectics of EPM.\nAt the same time, with the overarching theological meta-discourse of personal recon-\nciliation in mind, medical ethics may analogously `poach' in the fields of the ethics of\nwar.55 If politics can be thought before the horizon of an ontological peace that over-\ncomes political division, then the medical/caring act analogously seeks to affect physical\nhealth with faith in an ontological health which overcomes contemporary Cartesian divi-\nsions of substance.56 This is not least sustained by Christian metaphors: God as the ulti-\nmate physician, the Christus medicus, and the Prince of Peace. They meet in the holicity\nof shalom (wholeness, health or peace). Diseases such as cancer are often metaphorically\ndescribed as `enemies'to `battle', and some therapies akin to `nuclear options'. Preventive\ninterventions are possible as much as genetic surveillance. Just like drones, treatments\ncan `precision-target' malign tissues or invasive microorganisms. As in politics, the dan-\nger is to fall into absolute dualism, a total enmity.57\nBetween Hype and Abandonment: Mending the Body\nSuch a logic of reconciliation inherent in personhood has significant implications. First,\nfor the understanding of medicine: concerned with actual physical disintegration,\n58. Cf.

As a scientific discipline of mending it wrestles\nthe person from `thinghood': it counters the division between mind and body to the point\nof `betrayal' (e.g. in pain), but equally the division between persons as reduction-in-\nsuffering threatens the social fabric.58 A medicine adequate to persons aids the always\nprecarious, emerging coincidence of the biological and ecclesial modes of being.\nSuch a medicine certainly includes genomics, but significantly relocates and re-temporal-\nises it.59 As a result, EPM's dialectic may resolve into a sober hope. The service of healing as\nreal `patience-work' corresponds to it, and is not replaced by the `proactive maintenance of\nhealth'.60 Notably, hype is the opposite of events arduously unfolding in time: it propounds\n`Mission Accomplished' by virtue of sheer declaration. But like the war to end all wars, a\nmedicine to end all medicine denies the encounter with actual suffering. It denies human pas-\nsibility. Christianity certainly regards death as the `last enemy' (1 Cor. 15:26). Hence EPM\nappeals to the aversion against biological fatalism. But against all claims to scientific progress,\na denial at all costs may well be a counter-factual maintenance of a status quo, a Heraclitean\nstasis--only to then regard death as a catastrophic failure of technology, again a sheer abyss.\nMedical care faces rather than postpones that abyss in continuous, patient engagement.\nLike persons themselves, a sobered-up PM (SPM) is much less and much more than\nthe hype suggests. No longer an ideology61 that offers a sufficient horizon for human\nflourishing, SPM can simply function as another diagnostic and therapeutic instrument.\nThose who have always seen PM in that way have rightly wondered why PM should\nraise anthropological concerns at all, or even be a distinct sphere of research. However,\nthe narratives of advertised revolutions challenge institutionalised forms of medicine and\nredefine terms such as `persons' or `care'. Expensive measures, where not direct-to-\nconsumer, are already heavily straining public healthcare budgets.62 Hence, a theologi-\ncal-existential language of personhood remains a `stumbling block'.\n63.

Paradoxically\nthen, the most well-pampered private patient may be deprived of true compassion, which\nreintegrates him into social togetherness.\n66. Rogowski et al. argue that health and the need for intervention should be the guiding prin-\nciple of PM resource allocation, rather than the welfarist principle of consumer preference\nor `equity' in so far as it lacks clinically differentiated content. Rogowski et al., `Criteria for\nFairly Allocating Scarce Health-Care Resources', pp. 211\u00ad30.\nAuthority--Emergent Recognition\nWho decides? The question of authority concerns not just politics. As noted, EPM\nchampions the individual over against medical paternalism. However, as we saw,\npersonhood as free and social complicates that view. The middle ground between an\n(industry-/insurance-driven) paternalism and consumer capriciousness must be\nregained in concrete clinical encounters, the locus of PM as sober medical practice.\nThe concept of `embodied autonomy' is highly relevant here: `... to experience\nmyself as \"I\" within the world, presupposes feeling myself to be the body (Leib) I\nam'.63 Moreover, if every person--to an extent--can be a theophany-in-humanity,\nthe `levelling' of authority between clinician and patient happens in personal encoun-\nters. The `act' of listening here is not so much the muting of one autonomous indi-\nvidual (patient or clinician) whilst the other asserts their demands. Rather, witnessing\nto reconciliation, in listening to the other, waiting to reach out in word, sign and\ngesture, clinician and patient become persons. In responding to concrete manifesta-\ntions with serious attention they allow for such an `autonomy' in free relationality to\nemerge in the first place.64\nParticularly as direct-to-consumer genetic tests are on the rise, clinicians find them-\nselves in the position of having to give reassurance rather than interventions that\nincrease patients' alienation from their bodies (and thus also subvert clinicians' com-\npassionate affections). Where digitalisation, big data, commercial interests and insur-\nance pressures already pre-define or even populate the clinical relationship, those\ninvolved disintegrate: into individual bodies, resalable entities within networked `con-\ntrol societies' (Deleuze).\nMoreover, since personhood is the continuous event of being-in-relation, a sobered-\nup PM is intrinsically public, growing out of and operating within a public healthcare\nsystem (and not just the church); it responds to physical suffering as a social division.65\nSPM emerges from structures of welfare justice, not vice versa.66 This side-lines the\nbiotech industry and the homo economicus, and critically contextualises the current situ-\nation: commissioners are confronted with expensive innovations, but left alone with the\ntask of integrating them into public healthcare.\n67.

Fairchild and David Merrit Jones, `Health Surveillance, Ethics of', in Hugh\nLaFollette (ed.), The International Encyclopedia of Ethics (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2013),\nDiscrimination--Discerning the Necessary\nDiscrimination means to intend to separate the innocent from the guilty; guilt is established\nby the `direct material co-operation in the doing of wrong'.67 In medicine, `discrimination'\nmeans to target the disease with the intention to heal in so far as disease and its effects as\nillness and pain directly contribute to the division of the person. Considering that PM prom-\nises to reduce indiscriminate `one-size-fits-all' treatments, one might wonder why a lack of\ndiscrimination should at all be a problem here. Treatments that replace `nuclear', `scorched-\nearth'or ineffective interventions, i.e. a stratified medicine, surely can only be welcomed.\nBased on the anthropological difference between EPM and SPM, a sharp demarcation\nline runs between stratification and the lofty, predictive and preventive promises of\n`4P'-medicine.68 Groundless testing introduces again an abysmal crack into the healthy\nperson, an alter ego or `sick personality', the (already diseased) `genetic person'. Once\ntotal surveillance suggests total suspicion, the `one-size-fits-all' approach is repeated on\nthe individual level: the body becomes an indiscriminate battlefield; risks are reified and\ntreated where other responses may be indicated.69 The intention to mend the person-as-\npatient, the proprium of medicine, gets lost here.\nPresuming the healthy integrity of persons, no matter how precarious, mandates\ngenetic surveillance only where there are clinical reasons to believe a disease will become\nmanifest as illness--i.e. as concrete persons emerge and endure throughout time.70 Again\na political parallel: a government may gather comprehensive intelligence in order to\ntarget a foreign dictator. But first they need to have an indication that that dictator is the\nenemy, not anyone or everyone else. By the same token, it may be adequate, even manda-\ntory, to withhold medical treatment merely based on someone's genetic risk factors. On\nthe surface that may well violate `patient autonomy'.\nConversely, failing to make use of PM where possible is also indiscriminate.\nArguments that PM should be available merely because it is `innovative' or (still) part of\nan EU-framework miss this point. The fact that some tests, for example for BRCA muta-\ntions, are not as widely available as they could be, and the distinct possibility that PM is\nonly for the wealthy may be examples of, respectively, random and elitist discrimination.\nParticularly if coupled with an embrace of suffering (preferably other people's) in the\n71.

These possibilities are the result of a lack of discrimination,\nthe molecular targeting of diseases that affect persons as social-communal beings.\nProportionality--Doing What's Feasible\nIf discriminate clinical judgment can be seen as a matter of intention, then proportional-\nity `has to do with the rational form which such an act assumes, i.e. with the successful\nact of judgment', O'Donovan writes on the use of force.71 Analogously, medical inter-\nventions need to be adequate to the aim they can realistically achieve.\nProportionality has a retrospective and a prospective aspect. First, the retrospection:\nHugo Grotius--one of the first proponents of a public healthcare system--suggested that\nonly an iniuria accepta, a received injury, warrants response. Mere suspicion or `risk'\ndoes not warrant an intervention (in Grotius' case: military), because it is always costly.\nPreventive `invasion', the treatment of a pre-disease `risk state' as if it was a disease, is\nflat-out disproportionate. At least Grotius thus expressed allowance for contingency:\n`For protection against uncertain fears we must rely on divine providence and on a wari-\nness free of reproach, not on force.'72 Not only does that entail that a need for flexible\nresponses, but also what O'Donovan calls a `descriptive responsibility: ... what is under-\ntaken must correspond to what is purposed, and what is purposed must correspond to\nwhat is reasonably complained of'.73 Nonetheless, the iniuria accepta by no means needs\nto be an iniuria perfecta.74 Reactive medicine need not be literally reactive. The risk of a\nperson's disease can amount to inevitability, so that supportive intervention is pre-emp-\ntive rather than preventive.\nBut another possible retrospective (dis-)proportion relates to this: funding prestigious,\nexpensive research at the expense of offering affordable conventional therapies, suffi-\ncient medical and caring staff.75 What good is the best targeted therapy, if patients on the\nward are treated like `numbers in a concentration camp', as a nurse complained at a\nRoyal Society of Medicine (RSM) meeting in 2015? The `revolution' of PM thus may\nwell be a crisis one shouldn't let go to waste. Instead of merely re-moralising healthcare\nprofessionals, sobering-up PM implies re-proportioning existing organisational struc-\ntures and funds towards the effective and necessary care for persons. The present analy-\nsis thus well connects to some central concerns of social medicine.\nSecond, what is the aim of a medical intervention in concreto? If the end of a political\nact is a concrete peace settlement, the end of a medical act is the patient's health as rea-\nsonably achievable. In politics, forward-looking disproportion may creep in when mili-\ntary victory becomes the aim, rather than a possible mere means by which to achieve a\n76. O'Donovan, Just War Revisited, p. 59.

O'Donovan, Just War Revisited, p. 61; original emphasis.\nconcrete peace settlement.76 Analogously, biotechnological triumph can become an end\nin itself--especially so when research and development is tied to the imperative of eco-\nnomic growth in the midst of post-industrial decline. The ancient apocalyptic forces of\ndeath versus God here are replaced by the late-modern struggle of man versus machine.\nPatient and disease are conflated in an antagonistic, dualistic battle against death which\nno one can win. Transhumanism is one way to reconcile the opposites, a latter-day incar-\nnation of machine into man. But pace some theologians, this is more of a parody of the\nIncarnation rather than a genuine correspondence (Entsprechung).77\nForward-looking proportion means measuring the risk of failure and benefit. It is the\ntask of proportioning an action in relation to its end. What is a reasonable end, for exam-\nple in terminal cancer? Are invasive, cost-intensive interventions with a small chance of\ntwo additional weeks of life `appropriate'? `Proportion is, indeed, always the decisive\nargument in bringing conflict to an end',78 either because everything is lost--or won. In\ndetermining medical ends and proportionate means, both implications of EPM are again\nto be avoided: the Charybdis of death-denying wellbeing, and the Scylla of prematurely\nabandoning patients. Especially this last will become an issue with further resource con-\nstraints on healthcare budgets. Not all of them are `natural': they imply theological-\nmedical anthropologies, too.\nConclusion\nPersonalised Medicine is a set of technologies promising early diagnosis, molecular\nstratification and precision-medicines. The `person' and a deep concern for individuals\nare invoked by PM enthusiasts and sober pragmatists alike. However, beyond the sto-\nicheia of biomedical reduction, Foucauldian technologies of the self, and a dissolution of\nthe human into data packages, persons are ontologically and epistemologically exces-\nsive, even as they are unique. Emerging throughout time, persons are geared towards a\nholistic integrity of shalom that escapes analysis. In line with such an ontological logic\nof reconciliation, personhood is the standard by which helpful uses of PM can be dis-\ncerned from hype, unrealistic expectations and quackery. If geared towards persons, PM\ntechnologies can be part of medicine as patience-work. Such discernment need not rein-\nvent the wheel, but can learn from other fields of applied ethics.\n"
