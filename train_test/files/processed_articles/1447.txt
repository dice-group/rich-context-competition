Hershey Medical Center, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA\ndDepartment of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA\nNationally representative data on urinary levels of bisphenol A (BPA) and its metabolites in the United States from the 2005\u00ad2006 National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used to estimate daily BPA intakes. In addition, NHANES data on potential sources of BPA exposure\nand personal characteristics were explored for their association with urinary BPA levels. On the basis of 2005\u00ad2006 NHANES urinary BPA data and\nassumptions described in this paper, median daily intake for the overall population is approximately 34 ng/kg-day. Median daily BPA intakes for men are\nstatistically significantly higher than for women; there is a significant decrease in daily BPA intake with increasing age. Gender- and age-specific median\nintakes differ from the overall population by less than a factor of 2. Although estimates of daily BPA intake have decreased compared with those from the\n2003\u00ad2004 NHANES, it is premature to draw conclusions regarding trends at this time, as there is no indication that BPA use declined from 2003 to\n2006. On the basis of an assessment of urinary BPA and questionnaire data from the 2005\u00ad2006 NHANES, consumption of soda, school lunches, and\nmeals prepared outside the home F but not bottled water or canned tuna F was statistically significantly associated with higher urinary BPA.\nKeywords: bisphenol A, BPA, daily intake, United States, exposure, NHANES.\nIntroduction\nInterest in both exposure pathways and toxicity of bisphenol\nA (BPA) has grown in the past few years and a major effort\nis underway by the US National Toxicology Program, the\nFood and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC) to evaluate exposures to\nBPA in infants and young children, to obtain the data for\nconstructing PBPK models, and to explore health conse-\nquences associated with perinatal exposures to BPA (Bucher,\n2009). Although an important exposure pathway is thought\nto be from consumption of food and beverages packaged\nin polycarbonate bottles and epoxy-lined cans, large-scale\nstudies on BPA levels in commonly consumed foods in the\nUnited States have not yet been published and paired data on\ndietary BPA intake and urinary BPA levels are needed.\nInformation on some potential sources of BPA exposure is\nincluded in dietary questionnaire information obtained as\npart of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES). There are also urinary BPA data for\na portion of the NHANES participants. Thus, this cross-\nsectional database can be used to evaluate whether\nanticipated routes of dietary exposure are associated with\nurinary BPA levels. Although the NHANES database is a\nrich source of information on several possible BPA exposure\npathways, to date, associations between potential exposure\nsources and urinary BPA levels from NHANES have not\nbeen explored. Various studies have examined specific\nproducts or activities for potential for human exposure to\nBPA, including canned foods, microwave containers (Mar-\npolycarbonate bottles including baby bottles (Vandenberg\nconsumption (He et al., 2009), medical procedures/products\nincluding cardiopulmonary bypass and hemodialysis (Calafat\n(Vandenberg et al., 2007). Personal characteristics that have\nbeen evaluated for their association with urinary BPA include\nage, education level, gender (He et al., 2009), household\nincome (Becker et al., 2009), and body mass index (BMI)\nThere are now two time periods for which nationally\nrepresentative data on urinary BPA (CAS No. 80-05-7)\n2009). The sample population includes males and females\n1. Address all correspondence to: Dr. Judy S.

As excretion of ingested BPA into\nurine, mainly as the glucuronide conjugate, is essentially\ncomplete in 24 h, total urinary BPA in a 24-h urine sample\napproximates the BPA intake from the previous 24 h (LaKind\nand Naiman, 2008) (BPA in urine is present mainly as the\nglucuronide conjugate; for the purposes of this paper, the sum\nof the concentrations of BPA metabolites plus the parent\ncompound in urine is referred to as ``urinary BPA''). Thus, the\nurinary BPA data can be used to estimate daily intakes of\nBPA in the United States (LaKind and Naiman, 2008).\nIn this paper, we provide estimates of BPA daily intakes in\nand compare these with earlier published estimates from 2003\nresults of an exploration of the NHANES questionnaire and\nexamination data for statistical associations between possible\nsources of exposure and personal characteristics and urinary\nBPA levels. Of interest is whether the information available\nin the NHANES database supports earlier published results\non likely exposure pathways. Therefore, we evaluated\nassociations between urinary BPA levels and items from the\nNHANES questionnaire and examination data that specifi-\ncally related to packaged food/drink consumption, smoking,\nand specific medical procedures. We also assessed the\nrelationship between urinary BPA and age, gender, and\nBMI as these have been described previously.\nMethods\nThe CDC's National Center for Health Statistics data files\nBPA data are from a subsample of those individuals sampled\nas part of NHANES (10,348 persons who participated in the\nhydrolysis of conjugated metabolites, was measured in urine\nin the database with units of ng/ml). The method limit of\ndetection (LOD) is given as 0.4 ng/ml. In the data analyses,\nmeasures below the detection limit were assigned a value of\nthe LOD divided by the square root of 2 (CDC, 2006a).\nThe total number of participants reported in the 2005\u00ad\nhad no data reported for BPA. Thus, the subsample for\nwhich there are existing BPA data includes 2548 individuals.\nOf that subsample, 182 of the measurements were below\nthe LOD. Selected percentiles for urinary BPA for the\nsample population, and by gender and age, are shown in\nEstimating BPA Daily Intake\nThe method used to estimate daily intake for individuals with\nwas described previously (LaKind and Naiman, 2008) and is\nsummarized here. For each individual in the NHANES\ndatabase with urinary BPA data, the urinary BPA concen-\ntration (ng/ml) was combined with estimated 24-h urinary\noutput volume (ml) to determine daily excretion of BPA in\nunits of ng/day. This was assumed to be equivalent to the\ndaily intake. To obtain the daily intake adjusted for body\nweight (expressed in units of ng/kg-day), the daily intake for\neach individual was divided by that individual's body weight,\nThirteen individuals were missing body weight data; the total\ncount of participants with all necessary data for estimating\ndaily BPA intake is 2535. To estimate various population\n(and population subgroups) quantities such as intake means\nor intake percentiles, weighted means and percentiles were\ncalculated using the NHANES 2-year weights provided by\nCDC (as described in the NHANES analytic guidelines\nUrinary BPA \u00f0ng=ml\u00de\u00c2urinary output \u00f0ml=day\u00de=\nbody weight \u00f0kg\u00de \u00bc ng BPA=kg day\nUsing this approach, distributions of intakes representative\nof the US population were determined for (i) all participants,\nby gender. The calculations of point estimates and confi-\ndence intervals for the geometric mean intakes and intake\npercentiles were carried out in the R platform (Ihaka and\nTable 1. Selected percentiles and geometric mean urinary BPA levels (ng/ml) from the 2005\u00ad2006 NHANES data for the sample population and by\nage and gender.\nAbbreviation: BPA, bisphenol A\nBisphenol A daily intakes in the United States LaKind and Naiman\nGentleman, 1996), using the Hmisc package (http://biostat.\nmc.vanderbilt.edu/s/Hmisc). Confidence intervals for quan-\ntiles were calculated using a weighted bootstrap method\nAs the NHANES data give information on urinary\nconcentrations, rather than intake, certain assumptions and\ndatabases were relied on (LaKind and Naiman, 2008). First,\nwe used urinary BPA to represent daily intake as excretion of\ningested BPA (parent and metabolite) into urine is essentially\ncomplete in 24 h (Dekant and Vo\nfactors provided by CDC were applied to the raw data,\nresulting in estimates of percentiles and mean values that are\nintended to be representative of the US population. Volume-\nbased urinary BPA data (ng/ml urine) were used because the\nappropriateness of adjusting urinary BPA concentrations by\ncreatinine has been questioned (Mahalingaiah et al., 2008).\nIn our earlier analysis (LaKind and Naiman, 2008), we\ngenerally found that within age groups F with the exception\nof the 6\u00ad11-year olds F creatinine-adjusted intake estimates\ntend to be lower than intake estimates based on non-adjusted\nurinary BPA data and that intake estimates based on\ncreatinine-adjusted BPA concentrations and non-adjusted\nconcentrations are fairly highly correlated (correlation\nNo 24-h urinary output data were collected for the\nNHANES participants; we, therefore, used generic values\nto describe typical urinary output based on age and gender to\nestimate total daily excretion of BPA in ng (Valentin, 2002;\nICRP, 2003). For individuals from 20 years of age and older,\n``adult'' ICRP values were used (male, 1600 ml/day; female,\nthe average of the ICRP values for the 5-year olds (500 ml/\nAssociations Between NHANES Questionnaire Data and\nUrinary BPA Data\nWe reviewed the NHANES questionnaires to identify items\nthat have been previously described in the published literature\nas possible BPA exposure pathways. We examined data\nfrom the demographics, examination, and questionnaire files\nAs BPA is rapidly excreted, only questions that would\nindicate regular BPA exposures were considered. Although\nthe most widely discussed exposure route is from consump-\ntion of liquids stored in polycarbonate bottles, in particular\nexposure to bottle-fed infants, no information specific to\nthese types of bottles was collected as part of the NHANES\nsurvey nor were children under the age of 6 years included;\ntherefore, we could not evaluate this specific exposure route\nor population. We focused on questionnaire data (from the\nFood Frequency Questionnaire) related to diet (specifically\nquestions that included information on consumption of\ncanned, bottled, or packaged foods); we identified only one\nlist that specifically related to consumption of canned food\n(tuna). We also examined questions on alcohol consumption\nand smoking. Alcohol as an exposure source of BPA (He\net al., 2009) may be related to storage and packaging of\nalcohol. The basis for the reported association between\nsmoking and BPA exposure (He et al., 2009) is unclear; it is\npossible that smoking is a surrogate for another behavior\ncorrelated with BPA exposure. We were also interested in\nitems in NHANES that would provide information on\nindividuals undergoing medical procedures that could lead to\nBPA exposures (Yamasaki et al., 2001). Only one question\nrelated to this potential exposure route was identified:\nwhether the individual underwent dialysis. Finally, we\nexamined associations between urinary BPA and age, gender,\nand BMI. The interested reader can link the variables used in\nthis analysis to the questionnaire component at the following\nURL: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_05_06/\nvarexam_d.pdf.\nThe predictor variables investigated for association with\nurinary BPA concentrations are of three types: categorical,\nordinal, or numerical. We used non-parametric methods so\nthat minimal assumptions would be made about the under-\nlying distributions. For the ordinal and numerical predictor\nvariables, we performed two-sided tests of association based\non Spearman's rank correlation. In addition to being non-\nparametric, this method allows for ordinal responses in which\nmeaningful numerical values cannot be assigned (i.e. for\nquestions that produce ranges of values). Standard asympto-\ntic approximations to P-values may be inaccurate because of\nthe common occurrence of ties. In these instances, we used\npermutation tests to calculate P-values: for each of 100,000\ntrials, the ordinal data were randomly permuted and a\nSpearman's correlation was calculated between the permuted\nvalues and the urinary BPA values. The P-value is taken to\nbe the proportion of these trials in which the obtained\nSpearman's correlation was at least as extreme as the one\nactually observed for the real data. For categorical data, we\nused the Wilcoxon/Mann\u00adWhitney rank sum test to\ncompare groups. As we are interested in associations between\na predictor variable and BPA urinary concentrations and\nare not seeking results that are representative of the general\nUS population, for these analyses, we did not use the\nCDC-weighting factors.\nResults\nBPA Daily Intake\nPercentiles and means were estimated for BPA daily intakes\nurinary BPA data and individual body weight data as\ndescribed in the previous section. Table 2 gives the results by\nBisphenol A daily intakes in the United States\nLaKind and Naiman\ntotal population, age group (no data were reported\nby NHANES for individuals under the age of 6 years),\nand gender. Median BPA intakes are the highest for the\n6\u00ad11-year age group, and intakes decline with increasing\nadults are statistically significantly less than those for children\nin ages 6\u00ad11 years. Median BPA intakes are statistically\nsignificantly higher for males compared with females.\nAssociations Between Urinary BPA and Dietary Exposure\nand Personal/Demographic Data in NHANES\nThe results of the exploration of correlations between\nNHANES questionnaire and examination data and urinary\nBPA data are described below and summarized in Table 3.\nDietary Exposure We identified several questions specifically\nrelated to consumption of canned food (tuna), bottled or\ncanned drinks (soda or bottled water) or food that may be\nmore likely to be packaged rather than fresh (school lunches or\nmeals obtained from outside the home). Given the short\nphysiologic half-life of BPA, we specifically targeted questions\nthat would be likely to give information on recent exposures.\nSoda, bottled water, canned tuna, school lunches, meals\naway from home There was a positive statistically significant\nassociation between urinary BPA and consumption of\nsoda during non-summer months (P \u00bc 0.0001) and summer\nmonths (P \u00bc 0.0004), number of school lunches per week\nduring the school year (P \u00bc 0.002) and meals not prepared at\nhome (P \u00bc 0.006). The association between soda consump-\ntion and urinary BPA remained for those 18 years of age and\nolder and for those younger than 18 years. For consumption\nof meals not prepared at home, separation of the population\nby age (18 years and older or o18 years of age) reveals that\nthe relationship for adults remains significant (P \u00bc 0.0002),\nbut for those under the age of 18 years, the relationship is no\nlonger significant (P \u00bc 0.9). Consumption of canned tuna\nwas not correlated with urinary BPA; this lack of correlation\nwas observed for the whole population, for those younger\nthan 18 years of age, and for those 18 and older. For\nconsumption of bottled water, data from two successive\ninterview days were available; bottled water consumption\nwas inversely associated with urinary BPA only for the data\nfrom the second interview.\nPersonal/Demographic Information Age was negatively\nstatistically significantly lower urinary BPA levels than males\nBMI was not correlated with urinary BPA (P \u00bc 0.43).\nAlcohol and cigarettes No association was observed between\nalcohol consumption and urinary BPA levels. In general,\nsmoking seems to be inversely correlated with urinary BPA.\nFor example, individuals who reported being current smokers\nhad lower urinary BPA levels than non-smokers (P\u00bc 0.011).\nTable 2.

However, we did not observe\na dose\u00adresponse relationship between numbers of cigarettes\nsmoked per day and urinary BPA. Data were also available with\nwhich to evaluate the association between urinary BPA and\nwhen the participant last smoked (variable SMQ725). The\nhighest median level was for the group of participants who last\nsmoked the day before the questionnaire was administered\n(2.7ng/ml) compared with those who smoked the day of the\ninterview (2.15ng/ml) and those who last smoked 3\u00ad5 days\nbefore the interview (2.0ng/ml).\nMedical procedures Only three individuals underwent\ndialysis over the earlier 12 months and no information was\navailable on when the last procedure took place (although\na typical dialysis patient will undergo treatment three times\nper week (National Kidney Foundation, 2009)). Two of\nthe participants' urinary BPA levels were around the 75th\npercentiles for the general population (3.7 ng/ml) and one\nwas below the 25th percentile (0.5 ng/ml) (Table 1).\nRace/ethnicity Mexican Americans had significantly lower\nurinary BPA levels than Non-Hispanic Blacks; Non-Hispanic\nWhites also had significantly lower urinary BPA levels than\nDiscussion\nEstimates of Daily Intake of BPA in the United States\nand the assumptions described in this paper, median daily\nTable 3.

Median bisphenol A intakes (ng/kg-day) and 95% CIs for\nBisphenol A daily intakes in the United States\nLaKind and Naiman\nintake for the overall population is approximately 34 ng/kg-\nday. This is in close agreement with a recent estimate of BPA\nintake from Germany (30 ng/kg; Vo\ndaily BPA intakes for men are statistically significantly higher\nthan for women and there is a significant decrease in daily\nBPA intake with increasing age. However, gender- and\nage-specific median intakes (ranging from approximately\n25\u00ad50 ng/kg-day) differ from the overall population intake by\nless than a factor of 2. The NHANES sample population did\nnot include children under the age of six, so no conclusions can\nbe drawn from these data regarding daily intakes for young\nchildren. However, other studies that have reported levels of\nurinary BPA in children have found that the youngest children\nin the cohort have had the highest urinary BPA levels. For\nthe 3\u00ad5-year olds had highest levels (mean \u00bc 3.55 mg/l) (Becker\na significant decrease in urinary BPA in 94 children over a\n5-year time period from 1st to 6th grade. The estimate of\ndaily geometric mean intake for children given by Becker et al.\nThere are now two NHANES time periods with data on\nintakes were previously reported by LaKind and Naiman\npremature to draw any conclusions from these apparent\ndecreases; we were unable to locate information suggesting\nthat BPA use in the United States declined over the\nBPA began after this time period. Furthermore, results must\nbe interpreted with caution because of the limitations imposed\nby the underlying data and the methodology for estimating\ndaily intake, especially those in the tails of the intake\ndistributions because of the small numbers of individuals\nrepresented by those tails (LaKind and Naiman, 2008).\nAs noted earlier (LaKind and Naiman, 2008), the\ncontroversy regarding conflicting interpretation of informa-\ntion from studies of BPA endocrine and reproductive toxicity\nis recognized. Existing health-based guidance values in the\nUnited States and Europe can be compared with our esti-\nmates of daily intakes. The European Food Safety Authority\n(EFSA, 2007) and the US Environmental Protection Agency\nas the tolerable daily intake (TDI) and reference dose (RfD),\nrespectively. Median values were below 52 ng/kg-day for all\ngroups analyzed and the 95th percentiles were below 500 ng/\nkg-day (Table 2). Thus, median and 95th percentile intake\nestimates were approximately two to three orders of\nmagnitude below the current health-based guidance value.\nThis result is similar to that given by Ye et al. (2009) for a\ncohort of Norwegian women, with the estimated average\ndaily intakes of BPA reported to be about three orders of\nmagnitude lower than the RfD and TDI.\nAssociations Between Urinary BPA and Diet, Lifestyle and\nPersonal Characteristics\nAlthough dietary intake is thought to be the primary source\nof exposure to BPA (Vandenberg et al., 2007), uncertainties\nremain regarding relative contributions from various sources\nof exposure. There are many uses of BPA for which related\npotential exposures have not been fully assessed (e.g. digital\nmedia, electrical and electronic equipment, automobiles, sports\nsafety equipment, electrical laminates for printed circuit\nboards, composites, paints, and adhesives (http://www.\nbisphenol-a.org/about/faq.html#b)). Much of the focus has\nbeen on leaching of BPA from polycarbonate bottles into\ndata, bottled water consumption was not associated with\nincreased urinary BPA, but no information on bottle type\n(e.g. polycarbonate, polyethylene terephthalate [PET]) was\ngiven. We observed an association between increased soda\nconsumption and urinary BPA. The questionnaire did not\ndistinguish between consumption from cans versus bottles.\nAlthough soda bottles are generally comprised of PET and\nare, therefore, unlikely to be a source of BPA exposure, cans\nare typically coated with an epoxy resin from which BPA can\nmigrate (Cao et al., 2009). It is likely that some portion of\nsoda consumption reported in the NHANES study was from\ncans; the association between soda consumption and urinary\nBPA observed here is not unreasonable.\nReports of potential for BPA exposure from food\npackaging, including carry-out food wrapping (Vandenberg\net al., 2007), cans and microwave containers (Mariscal-Arcas\n(Mungui\u00b4a-Lo\n\u00b4 pez et al., 2005), led us to focus on NHANES\nquestions related to consumption of food likely to come into\ncontact with these types of packaging. The only NHANES\nquestion specifically related to a canned food item was for\ncanned tuna; however, despite the potential for migration\nof BPA from the lining of can coatings into canned fish\n(Mungui\u00b4a-Lo\n\u00b4 pez et al., 2005), we did not observe an\nassociation between more frequent canned tuna consumption\nand higher urinary BPA. We assumed that school lunches\nand meals prepared outside the home were more likely to\ninclude canned or microwaved foodstuffs; greater consump-\ntion of both of these meal types was associated with higher\nurinary BPA. We did not have information on what\npercentage of urine collection for school-age participants\nwas conducted during the school year and so could not assess\nthat part of the sample population in isolation, but the\nassociation between urinary BPA and number of school\nlunches consumed was still statistically significant.\nWe observed statistically significant inverse associations\nbetween urinary BPA and age and household income.\nBisphenol A daily intakes in the United States LaKind and Naiman\nIn addition, men had higher urinary BPA levels than women;\nmedian levels for men and women differed by approximately\n14%. BMI was not correlated with urinary BPA.\nIn contrast with the results of He et al. (2009), we did not\nobserve a positive correlation between urinary BPA and\nalcohol consumption or cigarette smoking. Insufficient\ninformation was given on types of alcohol consumed or\nhow the alcohol was packaged to allow for a more detailed\nanalysis. As noted earlier, the rationale for the positive\ncorrelation between cigarette smoking and BPA exposure\nreported by He et al. (2009) is unclear; the NHANES data\ndid not yield an analogous result.\nData from cross-sectional studies such as NHANES are\nmost appropriately used for hypothesis-generating analyses\nand become especially valuable when used in conjunction\nwith other supporting information (LaKind et al., 2008).\nInformation on associations must be interpreted with care\nas cross-sectional studies do not, in and of themselves, give\nsufficient information with which to determine causality. This\nis especially the case for chemicals with short physiologic\nhalf-lives and for which there are data from only one\nsampling event (i.e. one biological specimen per study\nparticipant). Thus, lack of an observed association between\na particular potential exposure route and urinary BPA levels\ndoes not rule out such an exposure route. However, the\nobservation that certain behaviors are associated with urinary\nBPA levels (e.g. consumption of school lunches and meals\noutside the home) suggests that these exposure pathways\nwarrant further study. Our exploration into associations\nbetween urinary BPA and questionnaire information in some\ncases confirmed the results of earlier studies, and in other\ncases contradicted those results. Additional confirmatory\nresearch on potential exposure pathways and magnitude\nof exposures F including a study design that involves\nmeasurements of both urinary BPA and BPA levels in 24-h\ndiet F is needed.\nConflict of interest\nDr. LaKind consults to both government and industry.\n"
