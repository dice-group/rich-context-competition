However, whether these improvements have conferred decreased risk for\ndisability is unknown. The obese population may be living longer with better-\ncontrolled risk factors but paradoxically experiencing more disability.\nObjective To determine whether the association between obesity and disability has\nchanged over time.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Adults aged 60 years and older (N=9928) with\nmeasured body mass index from 2 waves of the nationally representative National Health\nMain Outcome Measures Reports of much difficulty or inability to perform tasks\nin 2 disability domains: functional limitations (walking one-fourth mile, walking up 10\nsteps, stooping, lifting 10 lb, walking between rooms, and standing from an armless chair)\nand activities of daily living (ADL) limitations (transferring, eating, and dressing).\nResults Among obese individuals, the prevalence of functional impairment in-\nobese individuals were 1.78 times greater than for normal-weight individuals (95%\ndid not change among nonobese individuals. With respect to ADL impairment, odds\nfor obese individuals were not significantly greater than for individuals with normal\n2.88) at time 2. This was because the odds of ADL impairment did not change for\nobese individuals but decreased by 34% among nonobese individuals (OR, 0.66; 95%\nConclusions Recent cardiovascular improvements have not been accompanied by\nreduced disability within the obese older population. Rather, obese participants sur-\nveyed during 1999-2004 were more likely to report functional impairments than obese\nserved for nonobese older individuals did not occur in those who were obese. Over\ntime, declines in obesity-related mortality, along with a younger age at onset of obe-\nsity, could lead to an increased burden of disability within the obese older population.\nFurthermore, new cohorts of older\nindividuals may have experienced a\nlonger duration of obesity relative to\nprevious cohorts. The increases in\nacross all age groups12; those entering\nold age (60 years) with obesity to-\nday are likely to have had a longer ex-\nposure to excess weight than older\npeople in previous cohorts. The dis-\nability risk associated with obesity may\nbe related to cumulative exposure,1 be-\ncause obesity affects disability risk not\nonly through cardiovascular disease\nburden, but also through conditions\nlike arthritis.\nOur objective was to determine\nwhether the association between obe-\nsity and disability changed between\ndividuals aged 60 years and older. A\nprevious analysis of trends in obesity\nand disability showed a constant effect\nof obesity on disability over time, with\ndisability increasing in both obese and\nnonobese populations.13 This analy-\nsis, however, was based on an earlier\nperiod when disability appeared to be\nincreasing in the older population. It is\nimportant to know whether recent de-\nclines in old age disability14 have oc-\ncurred for all older individuals or have\nbeen confined to nonobese individu-\nals. Disability in this age group is of par-\nticular importance, given the current\ncontext of population aging15 and an in-\ncreasing prevalence of obesity among\nmore, obesity-associated disability is as-\nsociated with significant burden in\nterms of both quality of life and health\nMETHODS\nThe National Health and Nutrition Ex-\namination Surveys (NHANES) are\ncross-sectional studies of the noninsti-\ntutionalized US population including\ninterviews and clinical examinations\nconducted by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics.20 In this analysis, data\namine change in disability by body mass\nindex (BMI [calculated as weight in ki-\nlograms divided by height in meters\nsquared]) category. We do not exam-\nine NHANES waves prior to NHANES\nIII because they did not include our\nmeasures of interest on disability. There\nthe clinical examination component\nNHANES collected information on\n2 types of disability indicators: func-\ntional limitations, which refer to re-\nstrictionsinbasicmovementability,and\nlimitations in activities of daily living\n(ADLs), which represent the most se-\nvere disabilities and reflect an individu-\nal's ability to live independently. These\ndomains are conceptually distinct, as\nfunctionallimitationsareintrinsictothe\nindividual (eg, ability to stoop or kneel),\nwhile ADL limitations refer to an in-\nteraction with the physical and social\nenvironment to accomplish a task (eg,\ndressing).21 For each question pertain-\ning to disability-related tasks, partici-\npants were asked, \"By yourself and\nwithout using any special equipment,\nhow much difficulty do you have\" with\nthe particular task. Participants could\nreport having no difficulty, some dif-\nficulty, much difficulty, or unable to do.\negory, \"don't do,\" was added. For each\nitem, less than 1% of respondents se-\nlected the \"don't do\" category, and these\nresponses were recoded as unable to do.\nSensitivity analysis found that exclud-\ning don't do responses as missing did\nnot change results.\nParticipants were considered to have\na functional limitation if they re-\nported much difficulty or inability to\nperform any of the following 6 tasks:\nwalking one-fourth mile, walking up 10\nsteps without resting, stooping/\ncrouching/kneeling, lifting or carry-\ning 10 lb, walking between rooms on\nthe same floor, and standing from an\narmless chair. Participants who re-\nported using assistive devices to walk\nwere assumed to have difficulty walk-\ning one-fourth mile and walking up 10\nsteps. Participants were considered to\nhave an ADL limitation if they re-\nported much difficulty or inability to\nperform any of the 3 tasks represent-\ning ADLs: getting in and out of bed, eat-\ning, and dressing. Participants were in-\ncluded if they answered at least 4 of the\n6 functioning indicators and at least 2\nof the 3 ADL indicators, which re-\nsulted in 43 participants who were ex-\ncluded for missing data on disability\nmeasures. Sensitivity tests in which we\nexcluded all participants with any miss-\ning data or assumed that all such indi-\nviduals were disabled did not change\nresults. Cronbach  for a summary scale\nof impairment items indicated high cor-\nrelations among individual items and\nacceptable internal reliability (=0.85\nfor functional limitations; =0.66 for\nADL limitations).\nUnfortunately, NHANES includes\nquestions on only 3 of the 5 ADLs\ntypically used to define ADL impair-\nment22 and did not ask about bathing\nor toileting, leading to a slightly\nlower prevalence of observed ADL\nlimitations in elderly individuals\nrelative to other surveys.14 Neverthe-\nless, we include estimates of trends\nfor the available ADL limitations as a\ncomparison for trends in functional\nlimitations.\nWeight categories were based on\nmeasured height and weight: under-\nweight (BMI 18.5), normal weight\nCovariates included self-reported age,\nsex, race/ethnicity (determined by self-\nreport and categorized as non-\nHispanic black, Mexican American, and\nother compared with non-Hispanic\nwhite), education, income, the pres-\nence of chronic conditions, smoking,\nand health insurance status. Educa-\ntion was coded in 3 categories: low\nyears). Income was measured using the\npoverty income ratio to account for\nhousehold size and inflation over time.23\nFor 11% of the respondents with miss-\ning income data, poverty income ratio\nvalues were imputed using random re-\ngression imputation.24 With respect to\nchronic conditions, participants were\nasked whether a physician had ever told\nthem that they had arthritis, asthma,\nchronic bronchitis, emphysema, dia-\nbetes, congestive heart failure, a heart\nattack, cancer, or stroke. Smoking and\nhealth insurance were coded into 2 cat-\negories: current smokers vs nonsmok-\ners and no health insurance vs any\nhealth insurance.\n326 participants were excluded for\nmissing BMI, followed by 43 for miss-\ning disability data, and 411 for miss-\ning 1 or more other covariates, yield-\nparticipants from both surveys. Logis-\ntic regression was used to model the\nodds of having a functional or ADL limi-\ntation (in separate analyses). Because\nodds ratios (ORs) may overestimate risk\nin common outcomes, we also pro-\nvide risk ratios computed as the ratio\nof the adjusted probability of disabil-\nity in the exposed group to the ad-\njusted probability of disability in the\nnonexposed group.\nWe examined the influence of weight\nstatus on functional and ADL limita-\ntions and the extent to which this re-\nlationship has changed from NHANES\ntial explanations for observed changes\nover time. First, we considered whether\ndemographic changes, such as differ-\nences in age, race, education, or in-\ncome, accounted for trends in the as-\nsociationbetweenobesityanddisability.\nNext, we accounted for the changes in\nthe distribution of BMI in the obese cat-\negory by separating obesity into stan-\ndard classes. Because the weight dis-\ntribution shifted upward over this\nperiod,12 it is possible that changes in\nthe risk associated with obesity sim-\nply reflect an upward shift in the BMI\ndistribution. We therefore estimated\nrisk for disability using separate obe-\nsity weight categories (class I, BMI 30.0-\nIII, BMI 40.0). Finally, we exam-\nined whether changes in the preva-\nlence of disabling chronic conditions,\nsmoking, and health insurance cover-\nage for participants accounted for trends\nin obesity and disability. The Univer-\nsity of Pennsylvania Institutional Re-\nview Board approved this study. All\nanalyses were conducted using STATA\nversion 8.2 (StataCorp LP, College Sta-\ntion, Texas) to account for sample\nweighting and elements of survey de-\nsign.\nRESULTS\nTABLE 1 provides the prevalence of nor-\nmal weight, overweight, and obese in\nthe respondents (after weighting) and\nthe prevalence of functional limita-\ntions and ADL disability within BMI\ngroups.

The odds of functional impair-\nment did not change between NHANES\nincreased by 43% among obese partici-\npants. Furthermore, while the odds of\nADLdisabilitydeclinedsignificantlyover\nals, it did not change among obese older\nindividuals.\nFor functional impairment, the\nchange in obesity-associated disabil-\nity risk was not explained by an in-\ncreased prevalence of extreme obe-\nsity, as the effects of both class I and\nclass II obesity increased over time. The\nassociation between class III obesity and\nfunctional impairment did not change\nover time. This group already had very\nhigh disability levels in NHANES III and\nit is possible that given the small sample\nand limited power in this analysis, we\nwere not able to detect changes. For\nADL impairment, the change in obesity-\nassociated disability risk was partially\nexplained by increases in the severity\nof obesity. Obese-time interactions were\nno longer significant after separating\nobesity into severity classes. Although\ncontrolling for chronic conditions had\nlittle effect on obese-time interactions\nfor either outcome, it did reduce the\nmain effects of obesity on disability.\nConsistentwithpreviousresearch,we\nfound a decline in ADL disability\nclines are important because the small\npercentage of individuals with extreme\ndisability accounts for a disproportion-\nate share of health expenditures.26 How-\never,ADLdeclinesobservedinthisstudy\nwere confined to the nonobese popula-\ntion, suggesting that obesity may be\nslowing disability decline at the popu-\nlation level and that obese individuals\nmay not be benefiting as greatly from\nbroaderhealthimprovements.Therehas\nbeen significant debate about the ef-\nfects of obesity on trends in life expec-\nFigure.

In\ncontrast, we find no effect of over-\nweight on disability, which is consis-\ntent with other research suggesting\nsmall effects of overweight on health in\nold age.2 We tested for an interaction\nbetween overweight and time to deter-\nmine whether trends in disability dif-\nfered for overweight vs normal-\nweight participants, and this interaction\nwas not significant.\nTwo demographic trends deserve fur-\nther consideration. First, it is often ar-\ngued that increasing education has led\nto disability decline in the older popu-\nlation.28,29 In this study, education lev-\nelsincreasedovertimeamongthosewith\nobesityevenmorethanamongindividu-\nals with nonobesity. The proportion of\nthe obese population with fewer than 12\nyears of education decreased by 16.2%\nin the period observed in this study\n(P.001), compared with only an\n11.3% decrease in the nonobese popu-\nlation (P.001). Hence, controlling for\neducationshowedanevenlargerchange\nin the risk for disability associated with\nobesity. This suggests that prevalence of\ndisability within the obese population\nmay have increased even more without\naccompanying increases in education.\nSecond, more research is needed on\nageandcohortdifferencesinobesityand\nthe associated health effects. An in-\ncreased burden of comorbidity and dis-\nability among obese individuals at older\nages could arise from an increase in in-\ndividual lifetime exposure to obesity,\nleading to an expansion of disability\namong obese individuals at older ages.\nIt could also arise from a decline in the\nmortality risk associated with obesity,\nwhich would lead to a higher preva-\nlence of obesity at older ages. Recent re-\nsearch finds that the prevalence of obe-\nsity increased by 5.0 percentage points\nin the Medicare population between\ncreased by 10.9 percentage points in\ncentage points among those aged 70\nyears and older. In addition to an in-\ncreasing prevalence of obesity, we find\nan increase in both the prevalence and\nrelative risk of functional impairment in\nthe obese elderly population. In addi-\ntional analysis, we stratified the older\nthan 60-year age group into 2 groups:\nolder. The effect of obesity on disability\nincreased over time in both age groups\nfor both functional and ADL impair-\nment, but not all increases were signifi-\ncant, perhaps due to the loss of power\nassociated with age-stratified analysis\n(available on request from the authors).\nFurthermore,wefindthatthemostse-\nvere type of disability (ADL limitations)\nis decreasing among nonobese older in-\ndividualsbutnotintheobesepopulation.\nThus,despiteincreasesineducationand\nmedicalinterventions,higherlevelsofobe-\nsity in subsequent cohorts of older indi-\nvidualsraiseconcernsaboutthedisabil-\nity burden in the future.\nIn interpreting these findings, it is im-\nportant to recognize certain limita-\ntions. First, although we attempted to\naccount for an upward shift in the BMI\ndistribution by disaggregating obesity\nby class, this approach cannot ac-\ncount for increases in BMI within obe-\nsity classes, which may be driving ob-\nserved increases in disability within the\nobese population. Second, we rely on\nself-reported difficulties in physical\nfunctioning and ADLs rather than ob-\njective measures of strength or perfor-\nmance. Unfortunately, these were the\nonly measures that could be com-\npared because NHANES performance\nmeasures of physical ability were not\ncomparable across surveys. Although\nreliance on self-reported measures may\nunderestimate prevalence differences\nbetween demographic groups (eg,\nblack-white differences), it seems un-\nlikely to account for time trends in dis-\nability by obesity. Additionally,\nNHANES did not include additional\nADL measures (bathing, toileting),\nmeaning that we are likely to underes-\ntimate ADL disability in the popula-\ntion. The ADL disability levels of 4% to\n5% observed in this study are lower than\nthe estimates of 7% to 8% observed in\nthe National Health Interview Survey\nfor a slightly older age group30; there-\nfore, NHANES is likely to have missed\n2% to 3% of ADL disability. However,\nbecause we are observing trends, miss-\ning ADL items are unlikely to affect our\nresults unless the obese group experi-\nenced changes in bathing and toilet-\ning difficulty not experienced by other\nweight groups. Some studies have in-\ncluded difficulty walking across a room\nas an indicator of ADL limitations.14 If\nwe include difficulty walking between\nrooms on the same floor as an ADL limi-\ntation rather than a functional limita-\ntion, we observe similar increases in the\neffect of obesity on both functional im-\npairment and ADL impairment over\ntime.\nOur results differ somewhat from\nsome other surveys that have reported\ndeclines in functional impairment for\nthe elderly population31; this may be\ndue to differences in interview mode\n(NHANES interviews are conducted in\nperson) or to the particular time\nperiod considered. A recent analysis of\nMedicare data found that the total\nlevel of disability was constant from\ncare beneficiaries with ADL disability\nand an increase in beneficiaries with\nfunctional impairment.32 Finally,\nscreening questions relating to walk-\ning and stair climbing changed slightly\nresults do not change in direction or\nsignificance if we exclude these items.\nIn general, further research including\nmore extensive measures of disability,\nmultiple cohorts, and longer time peri-\nods is warranted.\nCONCLUSION\ntional impairments than obese partici-\nwhich suggests an increasing risk of\ndisability in the obese population.\nFurthermore, reductions in ADL dis-\nability observed among nonobese\nolder individuals did not occur among\nobese individuals. Taken together,\nthese findings suggest that recent\nimprovements in cardiovascular\nhealth have not been accompanied by\na reduction in disability burden\namong obese individuals; instead, the\nrisk of some types of disability is actu-\nally increasing.\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Alley had full access to all\nof the data in the study and takes responsibility for\nthe integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data\nanalysis.\nStudy concept and design: Alley, Chang.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Alley, Chang.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Alley, Chang.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Chang.\nStatistical analysis: Alley, Chang.\nObtained funding: Chang.\nStudy supervision: Chang.\nFinancial Disclosures: None reported.\nFunding/Support: This study was supported by the\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation Health and Soci-\nfrom the National Institute of Child Health and Hu-\nman Development (Dr Chang).\nRole of the Sponsor: The sponsors had no role in design\nandconductofthestudy;collection,management,analy-\nsis, and interpretation of the data; and preparation,\nreview, or approval of the manuscript.\nAdditional Contributions: We thank the following col-\nleagues for their helpful suggestions on previous drafts\nof the paper, for which no compensation was re-\nceived: Robby Aronowitz, PhD, James Macinko, PhD,\nVida Maralani, PhD, and Jason Schnittker, PhD, Uni-\nversity of Pennsylvania; and Nicholas Burger, BA, Uni-\nversity of California Santa Barbara.
