Diet is an important modifiable factor contributing to\nfunctional disability, particularly in older adults [2, 3].\nSeveral studies examining the relationship between diet and\nfunctional status of individuals have focused on single\nnutrients or food groups [3\u00ad7]. Because people consume a\ncombination of foods, it is difficult to attribute the effects\nof a single nutrient to health outcomes [8]. Thus, studies\nexamining the relationship between diet and health have in-\ncreasingly witnessed a shift in focus from single nutrients\nto overall diet quality. Dietary indexes, based on recommen-\ndations from various organisations, have been constructed\nto aid in identifying diet quality, patterns and variety [9].\nby the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is\na reliable measure of overall diet quality that assesses adher-\nence to the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)\nare not currently being met in the USA. This dietary index\ndiffers from an earlier version, HEI-1995, because it incor-\nporates an assessment of foods and nutrients on a density\nbasis (amounts per 1,000 calories) [10]. It also includes new\nfood groups: whole fruit, dark green and orange vegetables\nand legumes, whole grains and oils. Lastly, it incorporates a\ndiscretionary component, the calories from solid fat,\nalcohol and added sugar (SoFAAS). The HEI-2005 and its\nearlier version (HEI-1995) have been widely used in epi-\ndemiological studies [11]. One previous study reported that\nthe HEI-1995 was associated with mobility limitations\nability domains were not examined in this study.\nTo our knowledge, no other studies have examined the\nassociation between overall diet quality, as measured by\nHEI-2005 scores, and self-reported disability assessed by\nmultiple domains. Therefore, the purpose of this study was\nto examine the association between HEI-2005 scores and\nself-reported disability in a nationally representative sample\nof older adults.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), conducted by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The\nNHANES surveys are multistage, stratified area probability\nsamples. Data were obtained from a sample of non-\ninstitutionalised civilians during both a detailed in-person\nhome interview and a health examination [13].\nexcluded because of missing covariates (age, gender, race/\nethnicity, education, smoking status, marital status, availabil-\nity of emotional support, availability of financial support,\nhousehold size and number of close friends) and 234 parti-\ncipants were excluded because of missing dietary informa-\ntion. After excluding missing data for activities of daily\nliving (ADLs; n = 4), instrumental activities of daily living\n(IADLs; n = 158), leisure and social activities (LSAs; n = 69),\nlower extremity mobility (LEM; n = 552) and general phys-\nical activities (GPAs; n = 514), the final sample size was\nfor LEM and 3,596 for GPAs. This study was approved as\nexempt by the Institutional Review Board of Auburn\nUniversity.\nDietary assessment\nOne 24-h dietary recall that employed the USDA\nAutomated-Multiple Pass Method (AMPM) was used to\ncollect the dietary data. The AMPM included multiple\npasses through the 24 h of the previous day. During the\nAMPM interview, participants received cues to help them\nremember and describe foods and the amounts of foods\nThe HEI-2005, a composite score assessing an indivi-\ndual's adherence to the 2005 DGA, was used to measure\nnutrient- and food-based components. The first six compo-\nnents, including total fruit, whole fruit, total vegetables,\ndark green and orange vegetables and legumes, total grains\nand whole grains, are each given a score of 0\u00ad5 points. The\nnext five components including milk, meat and beans, oils,\nsaturated fat and sugar are each given 0\u00ad10 points. The last\ncomponent that reflects calories from solid fat, alcohol and\nadded sugars (SoFAAS) is given 0\u00ad20 points. The sum of\nscore, which ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score indi-\ncative of a more healthful diet. Information about the\nHEI-2005 and its scoring system is reviewed elsewhere\nFor the purpose of this analysis, HEI-2005 scores were\ncategorised into quartiles to express the diet quality: the\nfirst quartile represents the lowest quality and the fourth\nquartile represents the highest quality. The lowest quartile\nof HEI-2005 scores was chosen as the reference group.\nEach of the HEI-2005 component scores was analysed as\nan indicator variable (individuals who met their dietary\nrecommendations vs. all others).\nDisability\nNineteen validated questions were used to assess five\ndomains of disability: ADLs, IADLs, LSAs, LEM and\nGPAs [13, 15]. Each question assessed the difficulty an in-\ndividual had in performing a task without the aid of any\nequipment. For each item, participants were allowed to\nselect from among four levels of difficulty: `no difficulty',\n`some difficulty', `much difficulty' and `unable to do'. The\nitems examined included locomotion and transfers, house-\nhold productivity, social integration, and manipulation of\nB. Xu et al.\nsurroundings. Four activities were classified as ADLs: dress-\ning oneself; walking between rooms on the same floor;\ngetting in and out of bed; and using a fork, knife and\ndrinking from a cup. Three activities were used to classify\nIADLs: managing money; doing household chores; and\npreparing meals. LSAs also consisted of three activities:\ngoing out to movies and events; attending social events;\nand performing leisure activities at home. LEM consisted\nof two activities: walking a quarter mile and walking up 10\nsteps. GPAs consisted of seven activities: stooping, crouch-\ning, kneeling; lifting or carrying; standing up from an\narmless chair; standing for long periods; sitting for long\nperiods; reaching up over head; and grasping/holding small\nobjects. Disability was defined as any difficulty in perform-\ning one or more of the activities within a given domain.\nData analyses\nAll descriptive and inferential statistics were estimated using\nUSA) to account for sample design and sampling weights.\nSix-year examination sample weights were derived using an\napproach described in the NHANES analytic guidelines to\naccount for the unequal probabilities of selection, person-\nlevel non-response and a post-stratification adjustment to\nthe estimated US population [13].\nAssociations between quartiles of HEI-2005 scores and\ncovariates (descriptive characteristics) were tested with 2\ntests for categorical variables and linear regression analysis\nfor continuous variables. Multiple logistic regression models\nwere used to estimate the associations between quartiles of\nHEI-2005 scores and self-reported disability. Tests for\nlinear trends across quartiles of HEI-2005 were conducted\nusing the median value in each HEI-2005 category as a\ncontinuous variable in the logistic regression models. The\ncomponents and self-reported disability were also examined\nusing multiple logistic regression models. Age, gender,\nrace/ethnicity, education, smoking status, marital status,\navailability of emotional support, availability of financial\nsupport, household size and number of close friends were\ncontrolled for in all logistic regression models. For this ana-\nlysis, age was considered to be a continuous variable. Three\nrace/ethnicity categories were examined: non-Hispanic\nwhite, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic. Level of education\nwas defined as < a high school degree or a high school\ndegree. Smoking status was determined by the self-reported\nuse of cigarettes, cigars or pipes, and participants were clas-\nsified as never, former or current smokers. Married\nincluded those who reported being married or living with\ntheir partner. Single included those who were widowed,\nseparated or never married. Availability of emotional\nsupport was assessed by the presence of someone to talk\nover problems or to help make a difficult decision.\nAvailability of financial support was assessed by the pres-\nence of someone to help pay bills, housing costs, hospital\nvisits, or provide food or clothes. Household size was\ndichotomised at 2 people living in a household. The\nnumber of close friends was dichotomised at the median\nvalue 5 of the target population. Statistical significance was\nassigned at P < 0.05 (two-sided).\nResults\nDescriptive characteristics of the analytic sample for ADLs\nby quartiles of HEI-2005 scores are presented in Table 1.\nMore than one-half of the participants were non-Hispanic\nwhite, female and married but living alone, and had an edu-\ncation  high school, emotional and financial support, 5\nclose friends and GPAs disability.\nTable 2 shows the results for the associations between\ntotal HEI-2005 scores and self-reported disability by quar-\ntiles of HEI-2005 scores. After adjusting for covariates,\nHEI-2005 scores were not statistically associated with\nADLs and LSAs disability. Older adults with higher\nHEI-2005 scores were less likely to experience LEM (P for\nCompared with older adults whose HEI-2005 scores were\nin the lowest quartile, the likelihood of both IADLs and\nGPAs disability were significantly lower in those with\nHEI-2005 scores in quartiles two, three and four.\nCompared with those who had HEI-2005 scores in the\nlowest quartile, the odds of LEM disability were significant-\nly lower for those with HEI-2005 scores in the highest\nquartile.\nTable 3 shows the results for the associations between\nindividual HEI-2005 component scores and self-reported\ndisability by quartiles of HEI-2005 scores. Some of the in-\ndividual HEI-2005 component scores were statistically asso-\nciated with self-reported disability. The odds of IADLs,\nLEM and GPAs disability were significantly lower for indi-\nviduals who met the recommendations for HEI-2005 total\nfruit and whole fruit scores compared with those who did\nnot meet those recommendations. The likelihood of IADLs\ndisability was significantly lower for older adults who met\nthe recommendations for HEI-2005 dark green and orange\nvegetables and legumes scores. The likelihood of LEM and\nGPAs disability was significantly lower for those who met\nthe HEI-2005 SoFAAS recommendations than for those\nindividuals who did not.\nDiscussion\nThis study is among the first to document an inverse asso-\nciation between overall diet quality, measured by HEI-2005\nscores, and self-reported disability among a nationally rep-\nresentative sample of older Americans. Our findings are\nconsistent with a longitudinal study that reported that older\nadults with lower HEI-1995 scores had a higher risk for in-\ncident mobility limitations (equivalent to LEM in the\ncurrent study), defined as a reported difficulty with walking\na quarter mile or climbing 10 steps [12].\nDiet quality and disability\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nSelf-reported disability (%)d\nMeeting recommendations (%)\nADLs, activities of daily living; IADLs, instrumental activities of daily living; LSAs, leisure and social activities; LEM, lower-extremity mobility; GPAs, general\nphysical activities; SoFAAS, Calories from Solid Fats, Alcoholic beverages, and Added Sugars.\naDescriptive characteristics were based on the sample available for ADLs since they had the fewest missing.\nbFor continuous variables, the P-value is for the test of difference in means of the variables of interest.

Xu et al.\nTwo other studies examined the association between the\nconsumption of food groups and functional status [4, 5]. In\nthe Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN),\nmiddle-aged women with lower fruit and vegetable intakes\nwere more likely to report subsequent functional limitations\nas assessed 4 years later using the Medical Outcomes Study\nShort-Form 36 [5]. In the Atherosclerosis Risk in\nCommunities (ARIC) Study, researchers reported that lower\nfruit and vegetable consumption was associated with\npoorer lower extremity function, ADLs and IADLs among\nmiddle-aged and older black and white participants [4].\nLikewise, we found that meeting the HEI-2005 recommen-\ndations for total fruit and whole fruit consumption was\nassociated with a lower likelihood of reporting disability in\nIADLs, LEM and GPAs. Also, meeting the HEI-2005\nrecommendations for consumption of dark green and\norange vegetables and legumes was associated with a lower\nlikelihood of IADLs disability.\nThe protective effects of consuming fruit may be\nexplained by the antioxidants found in these foods [16, 17].\nAntioxidants, including the carotenoids, vitamin C, vitamin\nE and other polyphenols, may prevent free radical damage\nthat contributes to inflammation associated with chronic\ndiseases and subsequent functional decline [6, 18]. Both\ncross-sectional and longitudinal studies have reported low\nserum or plasma carotenoid concentrations were associated\nwith poor physical performance including gait speed and\nmuscle strength [19\u00ad22]. Consumption of fruits and vegeta-\nbles, the most important natural sources of antioxidants,\nmay be important dietary components that function to\nminimise functional limitations. One longitudinal study also\nreported that women with higher dietary cholesterol, total\nfat and saturated fat intakes reported more functional lim-\nitations than those who did not [5]. Similarly, we found that\nindividuals who did not meet the HEI-2005 recommenda-\ntions for SoFAAS had a higher likelihood of LEM and\nGPAs disability.\nIt is important to note that the cross-sectional design did\nnot allow us to study the causal relationship between\nHEI-2005 and disability. Further, the NHANES data does\nnot include institutionalised individuals who probably have a\nhigher prevalence of disability than community-dwelling\nolder adults. Therefore, the lack of significant associations\nfound between HEI-2005 scores and self-reported disability\nfor ADLs and LSAs may be due to these measures not\nbeing sensitive enough to discriminate among high function-\ning community-dwelling individuals [23]. Additionally, the\nHEI-2005 scores in this study were based on a single\n24-hour dietary recall instrument, which may be subject to\nunder- or over-reporting, depending on the population [24].\nThe AMPM method has been shown to underestimate\nenergy intakes by 11% in a population of normal, overweight\nand obese persons [14]. Finally the NHANES data set does\nnot include other variables, such as depression, that may\nplay a role in the relationship between diet and disability.\nThis study also has a number of strengths. Functional\nstatus was evaluated using self-reported measures that\nencompassed five different domains covering physical,\nsocial and psychological contexts. In addition, the\nNHANES data were rigorously collected and allow us to\nexamine a nationally representative sample population.\nFurther, diet quality was measured using HEI-2005 scores\nthat reliably simultaneously capture DGA recommendations\nwhich allow us to address the complexity of diet beha-\nviours. Using HEI-2005 scores to measure diet quality is\nalso useful for comparisons across different study popula-\ntions.

Additionally several factors, such as\nsocial support, that may affect the relationship between diet\nand disability were accounted for in our study. Finally, the\ncomponent scores used to calculate the total HEI score\noffer an opportunity to study important components of\ndietary intake and their relationships to disability.\nConclusion\nThe results demonstrate that adherence to the 2005 DGA\nwas associated with lower disability in physical, social and psy-\nchological domains among older adults. This study will help\nothers to shape more effective policy interventions to\npromote healthy diets and prevent functional decline in older\nadults. The 2005 DGA are the most authoritative dietary\nrecommendations provided to the US population.\nUnderstanding the health benefits of following the guidelines\nis essential for setting up effective behavioural interventions.\nPublic health goals related to reducing healthcare costs and\nenhancing the quality of life in the older adult population are\ndependent on ensuring proper nutritional status and main-\ntaining functional abilities. The development of targeted inter-\nventions for reaching these goals will only be met through\nimproving our understanding of the complex factors influen-\ncing the relationship of nutrition and functional status.\nKey points\n\u00b7 Adherence to the 2005 DGA was associated with a lower\nlikelihood of disability.\n\u00b7 Meeting the HEI-2005 component recommendations for\nfruits, vegetables and SoFAAS was associated with lower\ndisability.\n\u00b7 The HEI-2005 score encompasses important dietary\ncharacteristics and may be a useful tool to predict func-\ntional abilities.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by funds from Alabama\ngraduate award from the Department of Nutrition,\nDietetics, and Hospitality Management.
