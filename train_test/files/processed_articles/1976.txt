Introduction\nIn 1999, an estimated 830 million pounds of pesticides were used in the United States [1].\nOrganophosphorus (OP) pesticides are among the most common in the United States and are applied\nin both agricultural and residential settings. Currently, 34 OP pesticides are registered with the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use in the United States [2]. According to the EPA, 60\nmillion pounds of OP pesticides were used on corn, cotton, other field crops such as canola and alfalfa,\nfruits, nuts, and vegetables in 1999 [1]. Because of their widespread use on food crops, the EPA\nestablished food tolerance levels to prevent hazardous exposures in the diet as mandated by the Federal\nInsecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) [2].\nThe Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (FQPA) [3] amended FIFRA to include cumulative and\naggregate exposure risk assessments in derivative food tolerance levels. In addition, special\nconsideration was to be given to exposures among children. Because of their common mode of toxicity\nas potent acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors, the EPA selected OP insecticides as the first class of\npesticides for reassessing food tolerances. The reassessment of OP pesticides was completed in August\n2006. The EPA estimated that residential use of OP pesticides decreased by 20 million pounds\nannually, largely because of the voluntary cancellation of post-construction residential registrations on\nchlorpyrifos and diazinon in 2000 and 2002 [2]. Although the phase-out approach to eliminating\nresidential uses of chlorpyrifos and diazinon occurred over a several month period, some reports\nsuggest that use of OP insecticides declined shortly after the announcement of the cancellations [4].\nMany biomonitoring studies evaluating occupational [5-9], para-occupational [8,10-13], and\nbackground exposures [4,14-25] have focused on OP pesticides. Because exposure typically occurs by\nmultiple routes and dominant routes of exposure vary, assessing exposure to OP pesticides is not a\ntrivial process. In many epidemiologic studies, exposure markers in biological samples have been\nmeasured to estimate the absorbed dose [10,26-30]. One of the most common measures of OP\npesticide exposure is quantifying six common urinary dialkylphosphate (DAP) metabolites. This\nmeasure provides no specific information about the pesticide to which a person was exposed and it\nmay represent exposure to both the pesticide itself and its environmental degradate. However, urinary\nDAP metabolite measurements may provide useful information about cumulative exposure to OP\npesticides as a class because about 75% of the EPA-registered OP pesticides form one to three of these\nsix DAP metabolites.\nWe reported urinary DAP metabolite concentrations among 7,456 persons aged 6\u00ad59 years old from\nconcentrations of dimethylphosphate (DMP), diethylphosphate (DEP), dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP),\ndiethylthiophosphate (DETP), dimethyldithiophosphate (DMDTP), and diethyldithio-phosphate (DEDTP)\n(Figure 1). Our data were collected from NHANES 1999\u00ad2004 during three, two-year collection\ncycles and are representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population, stratified by age,\nsex, and race/ethnicity.\nFigure 1.

Experimental\nThe National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's\n(NCHS/CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is designed to measure\nthe health and nutrition status of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population [31]. NHANES\nparticipants were selected based on their age, sex, and racial/ethnic background through a complex\nstatistical process using the most current census information. For this study, we analyzed urine samples\nUrine specimens were collected from participants ages six years and older during one of the\nexamination periods conducted three times daily. Sociodemographic information and medical histories\nof survey participants and their families were collected during the household interview.\nThe National Centers for Health Statistics Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved the\nstudy protocols from NHANES 1999\u00ad. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants;\ninformed written consent for participants <18 years of age was obtained from parents\nor guardians.\n2.1. Laboratory Methods\nDuring the physical examinations, \"spot\" urine specimens were collected from participants,\naliquoted, and stored cold (2 \u00b0C\u00ad4 \u00b0C) or frozen until shipment. To determine urinary creatinine\nconcentrations, we used an automated colorimetric method based on a modified Jaffe reaction [32] on\na Beckman Synchron AS/ASTRA clinical analyzer (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Brea, CA, USA) at\nthe University of Minnesota's Medical Center. Samples collected for OP pesticide measurements were\nshipped on dry ice to CDC's National Center for Environmental Health. Urine samples were analyzed\nfor DAP metabolites of OP pesticides using the methods of Bravo et al. [33,34]. The 2002 method was\nused for subsequent analyses. Both methods were shown to agree using a Pearson correlation analysis\n(r > 0.97, p < 0.001 for all analytes); a Bland-Altman plot (Figure 2) showed good agreement with no\nsystematic bias between the two methods (mean percent difference <0.5% for all analytes). Briefly,\n4 mL of urine were spiked with an isotopically-labeled internal standard mixture, then concentrated to\ndryness using an azeotropic codistillation with acetonitrile or lyophilization. The dried residue was\ndissolved in acetonitrile, and the DAPs were derivatized to their respective chloropropyl esters using\n1-chloro-3-iodopropane and potassium carbonate. The solution containing the chloropropyl esters was\nconcentrated and then analyzed using gas chromatography-positive chemical ionization-tandem mass\nspectrometry. The DAP metabolites were quantified using isotope-dilution calibration. The relative\nstandard deviations ranged from 3\u00ad18% for these analyses. The analytic limits of detection (LODs)\n0.08\u00ad0.2 \u00b5g/L for dimethyldithiophosphate (DMDTP), 0.2 \u00b5g/L for diethylphosphate (DEP),\n(DEDTP). The LOD differences were considered when making general observations regarding the\nfrequencies of detection. Both laboratories and methods were certified according to the Clinical\nLaboratory Improvement Amendment [35] guidelines.\nFigure 2. Bland-Altman plot of percent difference between two measurement methods for\ndimethylthiophosphate. The mean percent difference is -0.32%.\nMean Concentration (\u00b5g/L)\n% Difference between\nconcentrations determined from\ntwo methods\n2.2. Statistical Analysis\nSAS software (version 9.1.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and SUDAAN software (version 9.0.1,\nResearch Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) produced estimates, regression\ncoefficients, and related standard errors. SUDAAN uses sample weights to account for the unequal\nprobability of selection. Geometric means were calculated for analytes detected in 60% of the\nsamples. For a concentration below the LOD, we used a value equal to the LOD divided by the square\nroot of 2 [36,37]. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated in SAS.\nFor the race/ethnicity variable, we included every group in the calculation for total estimates, but\nonly used Mexican Americans (MA), non-Hispanic blacks (NHB) and non-Hispanic whites (NHW)\nyears old and 60 years and older for the geometric mean and the various percentiles.\nWe used analysis of covariance to examine the influence of demographic variables on the\nlog-transformed urine concentrations for the analytes with 70% detection frequency (i.e., DMTP).\nThe least square geometric mean (LSGM) was calculated from the regression model. For multiple\nregression analyses, the variables included in the initial model were age (continuous), sex (male or\nfemale), race/ethnicity (MA, NHB, and NHW) and log-transformed creatinine. We also included an\nage-squared term in the model for DMTP because the unadjusted geometric mean by age groups\nindicated a curvilinear relationship between age and the urinary DMTP concentration. We assessed all\npossible two-way interaction terms in the model. To evaluate the relationship between the\nlog-transformed concentration of all analytes and age, we changed the continuous age to a categorical\nage-decades variable in the model to generate a bar chart of LSGM concentrations.\nTo reach the final model, we used backward elimination with a threshold of p < 0.05 for retaining\nthe variable in the model, using Satterwaite-adjusted F statistics. We evaluated for potential\nconfounding by adding each of the excluded variables back into the final model, one-by-one, and\nexamining changes in the  coefficients of the statistically significant main effects. If adding one of\nthese excluded variables caused a change in a  coefficient by 10%, the variable was added back into\nthe model. For NHANES 2003\u00ad2004 data, we conducted weighted univariate and multiple logistic\nregression to examine the chance of any demographic group (with sex (male, female), age (6\u00ad11,\nconcentration above the total population 95th percentile.\n3. Results and Discussion\ncould not be calculated for any analyte but DMTP because all the other analytes had a detection\nfrequency of less than 60%. The geometric mean concentration and various percentiles stratified by\n(male, female) for all three NHANES cycles are given in Table 1\u00adTable 6. We analyzed 7,456 samples\nduring the six-year period (1999\u00ad2004). No significant differences were noted in analyte\nconcentrations from urine samples collected at different times during the day.\nTable 1. Dimethylphosphate.

We observed a curvilinear relationship between the log-transformed DMTP\nconcentration and age (Figure 3). We found both a linear increase and positive quadratic trend with age\n( for linear = 0.008,  for quadratic = 0.0005). In the model where age was treated categorically, the\nLSGM covariate-adjusted concentration of DMTP was highest among those ages 60 years and older\n(3.2 \u00b5g/L) while the second highest level was among children ages 6\u00ad11 years old (2.45 \u00b5g/L). NHB\nparticipants had the highest LSGM covariate-adjusted concentration of DMTP (3.57 \u00b5g/L), which was\nsignificantly higher than for NHW (1.97 \u00b5g/L, p = 0.02). Similarly, NHB had a higher LSGM\ncovariate-adjusted concentration than MA (1.94. \u00b5g/L, p = 0.02). MA and NHW had similar LSGM\ncovariate-adjusted concentrations for DMTP. The LSGM covariate-adjusted concentration of DMTP\nfor females (2.46 \u00b5g/L) was marginally higher than the one for males (p = 0.055).\nFigure 3. A curvilinear relationship was observed between age and the least squares\ngeometric mean (LSGM) dimethylthiophosphate concentrations.\nRegarding potential pathways of exposure, we noted that all analytes except DMP and DEDTP were\nsignificantly correlated with each other (Table 7). DMTP and DMDTP had the highest significant\ncorrelation (r = 0.59), whereas the significant correlations between other analytes ranged from 0.06 to\nAge Group (years)\nLSGM Concentration (ng/mL)\nTable 7. Spearman correlation coefficients between dialkylphosphate metabolites of\norganophosphorus pesticides (correlation, p value, number of observations).\nDimethyldithiophosphate\nIn examining the likelihood for those participants whose concentrations were above the 95th\npercentile, urine concentrations of DEP was significantly associated with age (p = 0.045), but not sex\nand race/ethnicity. Adolescents were 2.96 and 2.4 times more likely to be above the total population\nsignificantly associated with the chance to be above the 95th percentile (p=0.05). Participants aged 60\nyears and older were 3.8 times more likely to be above the 95th percentile than that for adolescents\nthan adolescents ages 12\u00ad19 years old to be above the 95th percentile (OR [95% CI]:\n2.1 [1.0, 4.4]). No differences were found for the chance to be above the 95th percentile in any other\nage categories or for any other analytes.\nDuring the three two-year NHANES cycles, the 75th, 90th, and 95th percentile estimates for\ncycles in the total population. This observation was consistent across demographic groups. We also\n1999\u00ad2000 median estimates; however, upper distribution percentiles were similar with the ones in\nDAP metabolites of OP pesticides have been measured in a random subset of three NHANES cycles\nbeen reported for adults >60 years old. Additionally, these are the first data reported on the sample sets\ncollected before and after a voluntary withdrawal of registrations for chlorpyrifos and diazinon.\nAlthough the DAP metabolite measurements are not specific for one OP pesticide in particular and a\nsizeable proportion probably derives from exposure to the preformed DAP metabolite in the\nenvironment, these data may be useful. They may serve as an indicator for the maximum potential of\nOP pesticide exposure over time.\nInterestingly, the most vulnerable age groups, children and the elderly, had the highest\nconcentrations of DMTP in 2003\u00ad2004, while adolescents and other adults had much lower levels.\nThese data suggest that older adults and children share common behaviors or activities. For example,\ntime spent indoors may contribute to their high urinary DAP concentrations. However, adolescents\nwere more than twice as likely to have concentrations of DEP above the 95th percentile estimate than\nsenior adults and adults. For DMDTP, senior adults were 3.8 times more likely to be above the 95th\npercentile than adolescents and 1.8 times more likely than adults. Also, adults were marginally more\nlikely than adolescents to be above the 95th percentile. Understanding the predictors of exposure of the\nupper tail of the distribution is particularly important for regulatory mitigation efforts, so adolescents\nmay be a good subpopulation to target for reducing exposure.\nThe significant correlation of all of the DAP metabolites in urine suggests common pathways for\nboth exposure and excretion. Because the use of diethyl OP pesticides in applications with dimethyl\npesticides is unexpected, the correlation among these likely points to dietary exposures from produce\nwhere both groups of OP pesticides were used regularly. The strongest correlation was between DMTP\nand DMDTP, both potential metabolites of the common OP pesticide malathion.\nThese data sets collectively suggest that human exposure to OP pesticides has decreased during the\nlast six years. For example, the median and 95th percentile estimates of DMTP concentrations from\nthough the frequency of detection only decreased by about 20%. Urinary concentrations of DETP were\nhowever, DEP concentrations were largely unaffected. Because DETP can be derived from\nchlorpyrifos and diazinon, strategies targeting residential pesticide use to reduce exposure may have\ncontributed to the decrease. DEP is common to all diethyl-substituted OP insecticides which perhaps is\nwhy we may not have observed a similar decrease.\nAs noted earlier, the biggest limitation of our study is the lack of specificity of DAP metabolites for\na given OP pesticide. According to some estimates, 70% or more of urinary OP metabolite\nconcentrations may be attributable to exposure to the preformed metabolite in the environment, which\nis not known to be toxic [38-41]. Thus, we caution that the concentrations reported here be used as a\nmaximum possible estimate of OP pesticide exposures. Regardless, reducing the use or tolerance\nlevels of OP pesticides would also result in reduced preformed metabolite concentrations in the\nenvironment so that changes in urinary DAP concentrations over time may parallel exposure\nmitigation strategies demonstrating their effectiveness.\n4. Conclusions\nWe reported data collected from three NHANES survey periods. Our data indicated that the most\nvulnerable segments of our population--children and senior adults--have a greater risk of exposure to\nOP pesticides than other population segments. However, for DEP, adolescents were more than twice as\nlikely to have concentrations greater than the 95th percentile compared with adults. For DMDTP,\nsenior adults were 3.8 times more likely to be above the 95th percentile than adolescents and 1.8 times\nmore likely than adults. Also, adults were marginally more likely than adolescents to be above the 95th\npercentile. In addition, NHB have higher DMTP concentrations than NHW and MA. Based on the\nDAP urinary metabolite data, overall exposures to OP pesticides have declined during the last few\ndecades, suggesting that regulatory efforts have been effective.\n"
