In the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia (Ravenna, Italy), the San Lorenzo lunette shows two\npeculiar visual effects: a transparency effect of gold seen through gold and perceptual collinearity\nbetween two parts of a cross which are physically misaligned. Both effects are found within the\narea of the halo surrounding the saint's head. In this work we addressed the problem posed by the\nphysical misalignment of the cross. Our hypothesis is that the physical misalignment went unnoticed\nthroughout history because the artist produced a perceptual alignment to correct for the Poggendorff\nillusion. Hence, we asked observers to align two ends of a cross in a reproduction showing the\nsilhouette of San Lorenzo's torso holding the cross. Results support our hypothesis: both direction\nand magnitude of adjustments comply with the alignment in the original mosaic.\n",

Every detail\nshows dynamism, something that contrasts with the rather static representations of sacred\nfigures of the same period. From left to right: the cabinet holding the four gospels is left wide\nopen; a blazing fire under the martyrdom grid is casting its own vivid shadow against the\nwall; the saint's toga is flustered in a baroque fashion while he proceeds toward the centre of\nthe scene, peering at the visitor. San Lorenzo is holding an open book of Psalms in his left\nhand and a long cross over his right shoulder (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. San Lorenzo lunette. The lunette measures 313\u00d7187 cm (base length\u00d7height). The perpen-\ndicular distance from the mausoleum's floor to the base is 290 cm; the perpendicular distance from the\nmausoleum's floor to the saint's head is 445 cm. This means that the saint is practically portrayed with\na 1:1 ratio (considering the average height of men at the time). Given such dimensions, the sinopia\nused by the artist to trace the geometrical layout of the scene must have been created with the aid of\ndrawing tools, especially for tracing straight lines and the halo.\n\u00b6 Corresponding author.\nSan Lorenzo and the Poggendorff illusion 503\nFigure 2. (a) Detail of San Lorenzo. The blue and green lines show the entity of the geometrical\nmisalignment. Notice the different density of the tesserae in the region comprised between the halo\nand the cross, and the simulation of transparency with a coarse placement of the white tesserae:\nshould these be interpreted as cues of a pentimento (a technical term to refer to a visible trace of an\nartist's change of mind concerning some detail of a work of art)? (b) The Poggendorff illusion. (c) The\ntwo visible parts of the line are geometrically aligned.\nAll portrayed objects are pertinent to the saint's iconography, but within the context of\nthe mausoleum the cross is a core feature. The building is charged with sepulchral meanings,\nwith particular reference to the theme of resurrection and eternal life (Ricci 1914). Inside this\niconological programme the cross stands out as an emblem of faith and salvation. This is\nprobably the reason why the artist had to be sure that the long cross held by San Lorenzo was\nrecognizable in its whole extent, being also a symmetric representation of the cross held by\nthe Good Shepherd on the opposite wall. Careful observation of San Lorenzo's cross reveals\ntwo details that are particularly fascinating to the vision scientist (Zavagno 1996).\nFirst of all, the cross and the saint's halo determine a peculiar transparency effect: both\nobjects are of a gold colour, and the transparency effect, which works marvellously when\nviewed at a distance, is sketched inside the halo using only white tesserae. Due to this graphic\nsolution, the halo appears transparent only where it intersects with the cross (Figure 2).\nThe second curiosity concerns the long arm of the cross, which is subject to amodal\ncompletion behind the saint's neck. However, a more careful inspection reveals that the two\nparts of the long arm are not geometrically aligned (Figure 2). We believe that this detail went\nunnoticed throughout history because the artist corrected for a perceptual misalignment\nthat would have occurred if the two ends of the cross were geometrically collinear. Given\nthe size of the lunette (see Figure 1), the geometrical elements of the sinopia of the mosaic\nmust have been created with the aid of drawing tools. At this point a problem arises: Why\ndid the artist use drawing tools to trace perfectly straight lines everywhere except when it\ncomes to the cross, which is indeed straight but made of two physically misaligned parts? To\nanswer this question and to test our aforementioned hypothesis, we designed an experiment\n504 O Daneyko , N Stucchi , D Zavagno\nin which participants were asked to adjust the upper-right part of a cross until it appeared\ncollinear to the lower-left part in silhouette configurations reproducing the saint's head, halo,\ntorso, and cross (Figure 3). Such types of configurations were used to limit the stimuli to\nthe essential features that we considered part of the problem: the head/halo/torso of the\nsaint, two portions of the cross, and a portion of the upper-curved border of the lunette. We\nbelieve that our configurations in some sense mimic the sinopia, holding equivalent those\ngeometrical features pertinent to the problem.\nFigure 3. The psychophysical method of adjustment was used to estimate a participant's point of\nsubjective equality (ie, the perceptual alignment of the two ends of the long cross). The figure shows\ntwo typical starting points for cross adjustments. Task: adjust the right end of the cross until it appeared\ncollinear to the left end. Stimuli were displayed on a 2-in CRT. Thirty-six participants performed 12\nadjustment trials, (a) half of which starting from a point, variable from trial to trial, always well above\nthe point of geometric alignment (0) and (b) the other half starting similarly from a point always well\nbelow the point of alignment set by the artist (-25 pixels from 0). Trials were randomised.\nResults are displayed in Figure 4 and reported in detail in its caption. Results support the\nhypothesis that the artist preferred a perceptual alignment to a geometrical one. Of course,\nwe are aware that our study has at least four limitations: 1) adjustments were performed\nusing greyscale silhouettes that reproduced only a small portion of the scene; 2) we omitted\nthe transparency effect; 3) silhouettes were heavily scaled to fit the CRT; and 4) adjustments\nwere performed at eye-level.\nAll four limitations were imposed by the experimental set-up. While we think that our\nconfigurations reproduce most of the geometric information available in the sinopia, they do\nnot represent the 3D information that would have been available to the artist as he portrayed\nthe head of the saint. Hence, the actual mosaic may induce greater or different effects due\nto its 3D rendering (Koning and van Lier 2007), its size, and also due to the presence of the\ntransparency effect.\nAnother hypothesis is, however, worthy of consideration: the viewing angle and distance\nfrom which the artist checked how his work was proceeding might have something to do\nwith the magnitude of the mismatch between the geometric alignment and the one chosen\nby the artist. Ours, of course, is just a conjecture; however, it is based on an objective element:\nthe size of the lunette (see caption to Figure 1), because of which the use of tools to draw the\nSan Lorenzo and the Poggendorff illusion 505\ngeometric parts of the scene in the sinopia was practically mandatory. Consider the sinopia\nto be a sketch, maybe something a bit more than a line drawing. It is quite plausible that the\nartist drew a straight line for the upper edge of the cross right across the saint's neck and\nhalo (something similar to Figure 2c). If this were the case, only afterwards, while placing the\ntesserae and checking his work from a distance, would he have noticed the problem posed\nby gold against gold--the golden halo and the golden cross, which made the artist seek for a\npeculiar transparency effect (Zavagno 1996)--and also the problem posed by the unknown\nPoggendorff illusion, which made him reject the geometrical alignment of the sinopia in\nfavour of a perceptual alignment in the mosaic.\nFigure 4. Mean perceptual alignment for each observer. `0' on the y-axis indicates the point of\ngeometrical alignment, while the blue line indicates the artist's alignment. Squares refer to adjustments\nfrom above geometrical alignment; diamonds, to adjustments from below the artist's alignment. An\nANOVA on adjustments with `adjustment direction' (from above and from below, see Figure 3) and\nrepetitions as within-subjects factors revealed no significant effects. The distribution of subjects'\nestimations is well below the geometrical alignment. In fact, all means, except one, statistically differ\nfrom the geometrical alignment. Some observers performed adjustments that were comparable to the\nartist's alignment.\nAllow us to engage in an exercise of pure fiction, by picturing how the artist might have\nworked. Up on a scaffold, about 3 m from the ground, the artist would place the tesserae\nof the mosaic according to his plans, following the sinopia he created that allowed him to\nachieve, among other things, a round halo and very straight lines. Imagine the artist going up\nand down ladders to check his work from a distance, because he could not visually embrace\nthe whole scene from the scaffold. At some point, viewing the mosaic from ground level,\nhe realised that something was wrong: the long cross appeared `broken', separated in two\npieces. This outcome was a small catastrophe considering the iconological programme that\ninformed the entire building, from its shape (a Latin cross) to its rich decorations (Ricci 1914).\nThe saint's halo was responsible for the problem, but of course, it could not be deleted: if the\ncross and the book of psalms are Lawrence's diaconal attributes, the halo is the symbol of his\nholiness. The artist thus proceeded by trial and error to fix the appearance of the long cross,\nfinally devising the stratagem of an improbable transparency effect and perceptually fixing\nthe alignment of the cross to avoid an illusion of misalignment. The same illusion tormented\nanother artist, Rubens (Topper 1984), more than 1000 years later; however, it took another\n506 O Daneyko , N Stucchi , D Zavagno\n250 years before the phenomenon was finally discovered and acknowledged as an illusion,\nwhen Poggendorff observed it while inspecting yet another illusion, published by Z\u00f6llner in\nAs stated above, ours is only an alluring conjecture. A fact, however, remains: the\nmisalignment was made because of the Poggendorff illusion. The mosaic's sinopia would\nprobably help to shed light on how 3D appearance, viewing distance, and angle influenced\nthe choice of the artist, if only it were visible. Since the sinopia is not available, as an\nalternative, we plan to run a more ecological experiment in which not only some of the\nstimuli show a detailed reproduction of the mosaic, but the set-up also mimics the viewing\ndistance inside the Mausoleum. If viewing distance and angle matter, observers' adjustments\nshould roughly coincide with the alignment chosen by the artist more than 1500 years\nago, regardless of whether stimuli are good renderings of the mosaic or sinopia-type of\nrepresentations, somewhat similar to those portrayed in Figure 3.\nReferences\nKoning A, van Lier R, 2007 \"3-D processing in the Poggendorff illusion\" Acta Psychologica 126\nRicci C, 1914 \"Il sepolcro di Galla Placidia in Ravenna.
