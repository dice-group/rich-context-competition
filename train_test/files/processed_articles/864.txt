    "reduced_content": "Although GHb is widely accepted as a\nuseful index of mean blood glucose in\nthetreatment of patientswith diabetes,\nits use as a screening test for diabetes has\nbeen controversial. Because GHb testing can\nbe performed at any time of day and with-\nout special patient preparation, it is more\nconvenient for patients and health care\nproviders than oral glucose tolerance tests\n(OGTTs) or even measuring fasting plasma\nglucose. However, some reports have sug-\ngested that GHb may not be a suitable\nscreening test because of low sensitivity\n(1\u00ad8); others have suggested the opposite\n(9\u00ad21). Although the American Diabetes\nAssociation (ADA) recommends the use of\nGHb as a baseline test before initiating ther-\napy (22), ADA does not currently recom-\nmend the use of GHb for diabetes screening\nTwo recent developments have\nprompted the reevaluation of GHb as a\nscreening test for diabetes. First, the\nNational Glycohemoglobin Standardization\nstandardizes GHb results among methods\nand laboratories (24). Second, the Report\nof the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis\nand Classification of Diabetes Mellitus,\npublished in 1997, included new criteria\nfor diabetes diagnosis that have been\nadopted by ADA (25). The new criteria\nlowered the fasting plasma glucose cutoff\nfor diabetes diagnosis from 7.8 mmol/l\nand emphasized the use of fasting plasma\nglucose rather than the OGTT for diagnos-\ning diabetes. The Expert Committee also\nrecommended that all individuals aged\n45 years and younger individuals at high\nrisk for developing diabetes be screened at\nregular intervals.\nHerein, we examine the sensitivity and\nspecificity of GHb for diabetes screening in\na large and representative U.S. population\nby using the new ADA criteria of fasting\nplasma glucose 7.0 mmol/l as the cutoff\nfor diabetes diagnosis.\nMETHODS -- The Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\nto 1994 by the National Center for Health\nStatistics of the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention.

Of these subjects, 7,832 participated in a morning\nexamination session, of which 1,273 were excluded because of a previous diagnosis of diabetes,\nmissing data, or fasting time of 8 h before examination. Venous blood was obtained to mea-\nsure fasting plasma glucose and GHb in the remaining 6,559 subjects. Receiver operating char-\nacteristic curve analysis was used to examine the sensitivity and specificity of GHb for\ndetecting diabetes at increasing GHb cutoff levels.\nRESULTS -- GHb demonstrated high sensitivity (83.4%) and specificity (84.4%) for detect-\ning undiagnosed diabetes at a GHb cutoff of 1 SD above the normal mean. Moderate sensitiv-\nity (63.2%) and very high specificity (97.4%) were evident at a GHb cutoff of 2 SD above the\nnormal mean. Sensitivity at this level ranged from 58.6% in the non-Hispanic white popula-\ntion to 83.6% in the Mexican-American population; specificity ranged from 93.0% in the non-\nHispanic black population to 98.3% in the non-Hispanic white population.\nCONCLUSIONS -- GHb is a highly specific and convenient alternative to fasting plasma\nglucose for diabetes screening. A GHb value of 2 SD above the normal mean could identify a\nhigh proportion of individuals with undiagnosed diabetes who are at risk for developing dia-\nbetes complications.\nE p i d e m i o l o g y / H e a l t h S e r v i c e s / P s y c h o s o c i a l R e s e a r c h\nGHb for diabetes screening\npreviously been diagnosed with diabetes.\nphysical examination that included mea-\nsurement of GHb and fasting plasma glu-\ncose; approximately half (n = 7,832) were\nassigned to and participated in a morning\nexamination session and were asked to fast\nfor at least 9 h before examination. Subjects\nwho were assigned to or participated in\nafternoon or evening examinations (n =\nwho reported a previous diagnosis of dia-\nbetes (n = 632), subjects who had fasted\nand subjects who had data missing (n =\n290) were excluded from analysis. No sta-\ntistically significant differences were evi-\ndent between individuals excluded from\nthe analysis and those included in the\nanalysis (27). Of the remaining individuals\nwere from other racial or ethnic groups. Of\nthese subjects, 2,871 belonged to a subset\nof individuals aged 40\u00ad74 years who were\ngiven an OGTT in which plasma glucose\nwas measured at 2 h after administration of\na 75-g oral glucose load.\nGHb was measured as HbA\nby using\nan ion-exchange high-performance liquid\nchromatography method (Bio-Rad Diamat;\nHercules, CA) interassay coefficient of varia-\ntion 2%) (28). Fasting and 2-h plasma glu-\ncose levels were measured by using a\nhexokinase enzymaticmethod(RocheCobas\nMira, Indianapolis, IN) (28). Subjects were\nclassified as having normal fasting plasma\nglucose( 6.1mmol/l),impaired fasting glu-\nmmol/l) based on the recommendations of\nthe Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and\nClassification of Diabetes Mellitus (25). The\nweighted mean HbA\nfor patients with nor-\nmal fasting plasma glucose ( 6.1 mmol/l,\nWeexamined the sensitivityandspecificity of\nto classify subjects as having undiag-\nnosed diabetes by using cutoffs of1, 2, 3, and\n4 SD above the normal mean.\nStatistical analysis was performed by\nusing SAS (Cary, NC) and SPSS (Chicago)\nsoftware packages. The NHANES III sam-\npling design involved unequal probabilities\nof selection and planned oversampling of\nblacks and Mexican Americans (26). For\nthis reason, the NHANES III Mobile Exam-\nination Center morning session final weight\nwas used in analyses so that estimateswould\nreflect a representative U.S. population (29).\nLogistical regression analysis was used to\nmodel the probability that subjects would\nbe classified as having diabetes as a function\nof their HbA\nvalue. Forthe analysis, ADA's\ncriteria for diagnosis of diabetes with fasting\nplasma glucose were used as the \"gold stan-\ndard\" (i.e., subjects with fasting plasma glu-\ncose 7.0 mmol/l were classified as having\ndiabetes, whereas subjects with fasting\nplasma glucose 7.0 mmol/l were classified\nas not having diabetes). The results were\nsummarized with receiver operating char-\nacteristic (ROC) analysis to examine the\nsensitivity and specificity of HbA\nfor\ndetecting diabetes at increasing HbA\ncutoff\nlevels (30). Table 1 summarizes the classifi-\ncation of subjects for the ROC analysis. Sen-\nsitivity at each possible HbA\ncutoff level\nwas calculated as [TP/(TP FN)] 100,\nwhere TP = true positive (diabetic fasting\nplasma glucose and HbA\ncutoff level) and\nFN = false negative (diabetic fasting plasma\nglucose, cutoff level HbA\n). The sensitiv-\nity represents the percentage of those with\nfasting plasma glucose 7.0 mmol/l who\nare classified as positive according to HbA\n.\nSpecificity was calculated as [TN/(TN\nFP)] 100, whereTN = truenegative(non-\ndiabetic fasting plasma glucose and cutoff\nlevel HbA\n) and FP = false positive (nondi-\nabetic fasting plasma glucose, cutoff level\n). The specificity represents the per-\ncentage of those with fasting plasma glucose\n7.0 mmol/l who are classified as negative\naccording to the HbA\n. The ROC curve\nplots the sensitivity against 1 minus the\nspecificity at all possible HbA\ncutoff levels.\nThe higher the area under the curve (AUC),\nTable 1--Classification of subjects for ROC analysis\nFasting plasma glucose classification\nNormal or IFG ( 7.0 mmol/l) Diabetes ( 7.0 mmol/l)\ncutoff level TN FN\ncutoff level FP TP\nFN, false negative; FP, false positive; TN, true negative; TP, true positive.\nFigure 1--Scatter plot of individuals according to their HbA\nand fasting plasma glucose values.

As the number of standard\ndeviations increased, sensitivity decreased,\nand specificity increased. HbA\ndemon-\nstrated high sensitivity (83.4%) and speci-\nficity (84.4%) for detecting undiagnosed\ndiabetes at an HbA\ncutoff of 1 SD above\nthe normal mean. Moderate sensitivity\nwere evident at an HbA\ncutoff of 2 SD\nabove the normal mean.\nCharacteristics of subjects who were\nabove or below an HbA\n(2 SD above the normal mean) were\ninvestigated further. A total of 265 sub-\njects had a diabetic fasting plasma glu-\nhad an HbA\nsubjects with an HbA\n21 had fasting plasma glucose values\nthat were very close (7.0\u00ad7.2 mmol/l) to\nnondiabetic values. Additionally, 24 of\n46 subjects in this group for whom 2-h\nplasma glucose results were available\nshowed nondiabetic ( 11.1 mmol/l or\nues.\nbetic fasting plasma glucose values ( 7.0\nmmol/l). Most of these (n = 6,024) had an\njects had an HbA\nabove the normal mean), and 54 had an\nlevel of 6.5% ( 3 SD above the\nnormal mean).\nTable 3 shows the sensitivity and\nspecificity of HbA\nat a cutoff value of\n6.1% (2 SD above the normal mean) by\nracial and ethnic group.

In\nthe present study, we demonstrate that\nGHb is both sensitive and specific for\ndetecting undiagnosed diabetes as defined\nby a fasting plasma glucose level 7.0\nmmol/l (126 mg/dl) in a large and repre-\nsentative U.S. population sample.\nWe found indications of some differ-\nences in the sensitivity and specificity of\nGHb among ethnic groups. A higher preva-\nlence of diabetes among the non-Hispanic\nblack and Mexican-American populations\ncompared with the non-Hispanic white\npopulation has been well described (27),\nbut further studies are needed both to con-\nfirm and explain why GHb has better sen-\nsitivity as a screening test in these high-risk\npopulations.\nThe ADA Expert Committee recom-\nmended that screening for diabetes be\naccomplished primarily by measuring fast-\ning plasma glucose. However, fasting is\ninconvenient for patients, and subjects do\nnot always fast properly, which can lead to\nmisdiagnosing diabetes (31). In contrast,\nGHb can be measured at any time of the\nday regardless of the length of fast or the\ncontent of the previous meal. Moreover,\nRohlfing and Associates\nFigure 2--ROC curve for HbA\nas a diagnostic indicator for diabetes (fasting plasma glucose 7.0\nmmol/l). , Each possible HbA\ncutoff level; , cutoffs of 1, 2, 3, and 4 SD above the normal mean.\nTable 2--Sensitivity and specificity of HbA\nfor detecting undiagnosed diabetes (fasting plasma\nglucose 7.0 mmol/l) at increasing HbA\ncutoff levels\ncutoff (%) Sensitivity Specificity\nData are %.\nGHb can be analyzed with a small amount\nof sample, as little as 5 \u00b5l of blood obtained\nfrom a fingerstick (32). Blood can even be\ncollected on filter paper and sent to a central\nlaboratory for analysis (33) when screening\nindividuals who live in remote areas.\nGHb is a more comprehensive mea-\nsure of total glycemic exposure than fasting\nplasma glucose in that it is a measure of\nplasma glucose not only in the fasting state\nbut also in the postprandial state. Hence, it\nmay be a better predictor of glycemia-\nrelated complications. GHb is highly cor-\nrelated with the presence of diabetic\nmicrovascular complications in prospec-\net al. (20) further demonstrated that GHb\nis as effective a predictor of microvascular\ncomplications as fasting plasma glucose.\nThe Expert Committee did not select GHb\nas the screening or diagnostic method\nbecause of \"the many different methods for\nthe measurement of GHb\" and because\n\"nationwide standardization of the GHb\ntest had just begun\" (25). However, the\nNational Glycohemoglobin Standardiza-\ntion Program has obviated these issues by\nmaking standardization of GHb methods\nwidely available (24). The NGSP certifies\nmanufacturers' GHb testing methods as\ntraceable to the Diabetes Control and\nComplications Trial (DCCT) reference.\nTherefore, results from NGSP-certified\nmethods are comparable between methods\nand laboratories, as demonstrated by\nrecent College of American Pathologists\nsurvey data (38), and can be directly\nrelated to DCCT-determined risks for the\ndevelopment of microvascular complica-\ntions. The ADA has recommended that\nonly NGSP-certified methods be used to\nmeasure GHb (39), and most of the major\nGHb assay methods currently in use are\ncertified by the NGSP (40).\nIn summary, GHb is a highly specific\nand convenient method to use in screening\nfor undiagnosed diabetes. A GHb value of\n2 SD above the normal mean could identify\na large proportion of individuals with undi-\nagnosed diabetes who are at risk for devel-\noping diabetes complications.\nReferences\n1.
