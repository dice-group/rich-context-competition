The incidence of\nnausea and vomiting caused by caesarean\nsection is as high as 60%, causing discom-\nfort to patients. For full-stomach patients,\nreflux and aspiration may occur during\ncaesarean section.2 Additionally, shivering,\na common complication of patients who\nundergo caesarean section, can increase\npatients' oxygen consumption, produce\nlarge amounts of CO2\n, and increase the\nmetabolic rate by 400%.3 If heart and lung\ndiseases are discovered in patients, serious\ncomplications may occur. Prevention of\nintraoperative and postoperative shivering\ncaused by caesarean section is an effective\nmeasure to prevent obstetric complications.4\nMoreover, the majority of puerperas may\nsuffer from hypotension when self-regula-\ntion of blood flow is inhibited and support\nof abdominal muscles for the uterus dis-\nappear when the subarachnoid space is\nblocked.5 Dexmedetomidine, which is a\nselective a2-receptor agonist, is used for\nsedation, analgesia, and inhibition of shiver-\ning during the extubation phase of general\nanaesthesia. This study aimed to investigate\nthe effects of dexmedetomidine on adverse\nreactions caused by spinal anaesthesia\nduring caesarean section.\nMaterials and methods\nInclusion criteria\nWith regard to the type of study, we\nincluded randomized, controlled trials\n(RCTs), which adopted a blinding method.\nCriteria for inclusion of studies were as\nfollows: (1) original and independent stu-\ndies; (2) RCTs; (3) the groups were compar-\nable and balanced; and (4) spinal\nanaesthesia was used. For interventions,\nthe experimental group was administered\ndexmedetomidine, while a control group\nreceived placebo or saline. Evaluation indi-\ncators of adverse reactions included the\nfollowing: (1) shivering; (2) nausea and\nvomiting; (3) hypotension; (4) bradycardia;\nand (5) pruritus.\nExclusion criteria\nAny studies with one of the following con-\nditions were excluded: (1) non-RCTs;\n(2) retrospective studies; (3) descriptive lit-\nerature reviews or systematic reviews; and\n(4) no data provided for calculating adverse\nreactions.\nSearch strategy\nWe searched PubMed, the Cochrane\nLibrary, CNKI, and other Chinese and\nforeign databases. We conducted compara-\ntive studies on specific clinical trials (from\nspinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. We\nalso manually searched the full texts of all\nstudies to obtain the primary data. The\nEnglish search terms included ``dexmedeto-\nmidine'', ``cesarean section'', and ``spinal\nanesthesia.'' The retrievals ranged from\nCriteria for assessing the quality\nof literature\nAll RCTs that met the inclusion criteria\nwere evaluated according to the Jadad scale.\nTwo reviewers separately assessed the qual-\nity, and consulted a third party or negotiated\nwith each other when there was a disagree-\nment. The evaluated items included the\nfollowing: (1) whether randomization was\nperformed and whether the method was\ncorrect; (2) whether allocation concealment\nwas used and whether the method was\ncorrect; (3) whether blinding was performed\nand in whom the method was used; and\n(4) whether there were withdrawals or\ndropouts.\nData extraction\nAll of the data were independently extracted\nusing standard data tables by two investiga-\ntors. They consulted a third party when\nthere was a disagreement. The following\ncontents were extracted from each article:\nthe first author, the published year, the\nnumber of cases, grouping, and indicators\nof adverse reactions.\nStatistical analysis\nWe performed a meta-analysis using Review\nManager 5.2 and examined heterogeneity by\nconducting the chi-square test. In this study,\nthe criteria and analytical method for deter-\nmining heterogeneity were as follows. (1) If\nI2 was <50%, there was homogeneity, and\nthe fixed-effects model was used to conduct\nthe meta-analysis. (2) If I2 was 50% and\nheterogeneity between the groups needed to\nbe combined, the random-effects model was\nselected for performing the meta-analysis.\nSubgroup analyses or sensitivity analyses\nwere performed on factors that may con-\ntribute to heterogeneity. The data were\nanalysed by means of the weighted mean\ndifference if the continuous data were\nachieved by using measurement tools or by\nmeans of the standardized mean difference if\nthe continuous data were obtained by using\ndifferent measurement tools. For categorical\ndata, the odds risks (ORs) were calculated.\nAll data were calculated with 95% confi-\ndence intervals (CIs). The funnel plot was\nused to analyse publication bias.\nResults\nLiterature screening\nIn accordance with the search strategy, 401\narticles were included in the initial search.\nA total of 94 articles were selected after\nexcluding non-relevant literature and non-\noriginal studies by reading titles and\nincluded after further reading the full text\n(Figure 1).\nData extraction and evaluation of quality\nThe basic information of the included RCTs\nis shown in Table 1.

We found that\nthere was no significant difference in the\nincidence of shivering between the dexme-\ndetomidine and control groups (OR \u00bc 0.88,\nDiscussion\nAn increasing amount of studies18\u00ad20 have\nshown that the anaesthetic efficacy of\na2-receptor agonists, such as clonidine\nand dexmedetomidine, is satisfactory.\nDexmedetomidine is a highly selective\na2-adrenergic receptor agonist.\nDexmedetomidine inhibits the release of\nnorepinephrine through stimulating the\na2-adrenergic receptor in the presynaptic\nmembrane, thus terminating the delivery of\npain signals. Dexmedetomidine also reduces\nthe activity of sympathetic nerves via the\na2-adrenergic receptor in the postsynaptic\nmembrane, reduces blood pressure and\nheart rate, and produces the effects of sed-\nation and relieving anxiety. Additionally,\ndexmedetomidine in combination with the\na2-adrenergic receptor in the spinal cord is\nan effective analgesia.19\nShivering is a common complication of\ncaesarean section. The incidence of shivering\nranges from 5% to 65% in caesarean sec-\ntion. The main reasons for shivering include\npartial inhibition of the spinal reflex,\ndecreased sympathetic activity, suppressed\nadrenal function, and surgical stimulation\nand pain. For puerperas, severe shivering\ncan lead to increased consumption of\noxygen, a rise in production of CO2\nand\nblood sugar, acceleration of heart rate, and\nin severe cases, severe hypoxaemia and\nacidosis. Dexmedetomidine is a highly\nselective and a novel a2-adrenergic receptor\nagonist. Dexmedetomidine acts on the a2-\nadrenergic receptor in the brain and spinal\ncord, inhibiting the discharge of nerve cells\nto hypnotize, sedate, resist anxiety, and\nmitigate the patient's poor mood.21 Phan\net al.22 reported that dexmedetomidine\ncurbs the thermoregulatory centre in the\nbrain by suppressing delivery of information\nvia body temperature at the spinal cord\nlevel, thus inhibiting shivering.\nNausea and vomiting during periopera-\ntion are adverse events for patients, obstetri-\ncians, and anaesthesiologists. Uncontrolled\nabdominal movement during surgery can\nincrease the risk of visceral injury. The exact\naetiology of perioperative nausea and\nvomiting remains unclear. A variety of\nfactors are likely to cause nausea and\nvomiting.23 Cerebral ischaemia tends to\ntrigger vomiting during combined spinal\nand epidural anaesthesia for caesarean sec-\ntion. Blocking of sympathetic nerves and\nhypotension secondary to spinal anaesthe-\nsia, visceral pain, and vagal stimulation are\nthe most important factors in caesarean\nFigure 6. Effect of dexmedetomidine on hypotension.\nsection. Hypotension may be the most\nimportant cause of nausea and vomiting.\nStudies have demonstrated that dexmedeto-\nmidine has effects of analgesia and sedation\nduring spinal anaesthesia. Intravenously\ninjected dexmedetomidine leads to hyperpo-\nlarization of nerve tissue to produce an\nanalgesic effect and enhance regional anaes-\nthesia by changing the transmembrane and\nionic conductivity of blue-spot in the brain-\nstem. The stable haemodynamic effects of\ndexmedetomidine are mainly related to the\nenhanced stability of the sympathetic adren-\nergic system. Steady haemodynamics may\nreduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting.\nDexmedetomidine has little effect on\nhypotension and pruritus during caesarean\nsection. Moreover, dexmedetomidine\nreduces the activity of sympathetic nerves\nvia the a2-adrenergic receptor in the post-\nsynaptic membrane and reduces heart rate,\nand thus increases the incidence of\nbradycardia.\nSeveral limitations of this meta-analysis\nshould be taken into account. First, the\nquality of the included studies was uneven.\nAdditionally, the number of included RCTs\nwas too small. Moreover, the methodo-\nlogical quality used in evaluating the 13\nRCTs was not high. Because we only\nincluded published literature, the search\nstrategy and publication bias also could\nhave affected the results of this study.\nIn summary, dexmedetomidine can\nreduce the incidence of nausea, vomiting,\nand shivering in spinal anaesthesia for\ncaesarean section, but it does not reduce\nthe incidence of pruritus and hypotension.\nDexmedetomidine can raise the incidence of\nbradycardia.\n"
