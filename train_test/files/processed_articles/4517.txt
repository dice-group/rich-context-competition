    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe present here a realist multilevel situational analysis of maternal depression. We use situational analysis to identify\nthe interaction of mothers with social structures and the possible causal influence of those social structures on her well-\nbeing. The analysis moves from an emergent empirical approach toward the more reflexive and abductive approach of\nsituational analysis, thus better informing our abductive reasoning and the generation of theory. Critical realism and symbolic\ninteractionism provide the methodological underpinning for the study. The setting was South Western Sydney, Australia.\nInterviews of mothers and practitioners were analyzed using open coding to enable maximum emergence. Situational analysis\nwas then undertaken using situational and social worlds/arena maps. Home and neighborhood situational analysis mapping\nand analysis of relations identified the following concepts: (a) expectations and dreams, (b) marginalization and being alone,\n(c) loss or absence of power and control, and (d) support and nurturing. The neighborhood and macro-arena situational\nanalysis mapping and analysis of relations identified the following concepts: (a) social support networks, social cohesion and\nsocial capital; (b) services planning and delivery and social policy; and (c) global economy, business, and media. Emerging was\nthe centrality of being alone and expectations lost as possible triggers of stress and depression within circumstances where\nmedia portrays expectations of motherhood that are shattered by reality and social marginalization. We further observe\nthat powerful global economic and political forces are having an impact on the local situations. The challenge for policy and\npractice is to support families within this adverse regional and global economic context.\n",

The purpose is to contribute\nto a realist theory building study that aims to explain neigh-\nborhood context, maternal depression, and the developmen-\ntal origins of health and disease.\nThat the early years play an important role in the genesis\nof later adult health and disease is well recognized. Intensive\nefforts at theory construction seek to explain complex genetic\nand environmental mechanisms that interact to influence this\nhypothesized developmental origin of health and disease\n(Gluckman, Hanson, & Beedle, 2007).

Postnatal depression may also be associated with sub-\nsequent maternal and childhood obesity (Herring et al., 2008;\nSurkan, Kawachi, & Peterson, 2008), not breast feed (Dennis\n& McQueen, 2009; Henderson, Evans, Straton, Priest, &\nHagan, 2003), and maternal health harming behaviors such\nas tobacco and drug addiction (Cinciripini et al., 2010;\nLancaster et al., 2010; Rubio, Kraemer, Farrell, & Day,\nWe have previously reported on individual-level psycho-\nsocial predictors of postnatal depression in South Western\nSydney (Eastwood, Phung, & Barnett, 2011) and proposed\nthat the findings were consistent with group-level socioeco-\nnomic deprivation, neighborhood environment, social net-\nworks, and ethnic diversity having causal effects on postnatal\ndepressive symptomatology and other perinatal outcomes.\nThat proposition is consistent with a recent qualitative study\nof pathways from neighborhoods to mental well-being which\nfound that neighborhood affordability, negative community\nfactors including crime and vandalism, and social makeup\nincluding unemployment and poverty were felt to be associ-\nated with poor mental well-being (O'Campo, Salmon, &\nTheoretical bio-psychosocial (Engel, 1977), eco-social\n(Krieger, 2001), and bio-ecological (Bronfenbrenner & Ceci,\n1994) models have made an immense contribution to our\nunderstanding of this interplay between human biology and\ncontext, but Ben-Shlomo and Kuh (2002) go further and\nargue that a life course approach is not limited to individuals\nwithin a single generation but \"should intertwine biological\nand social transmission of risk across generations.\" They\nextend the models proposed above to link across generations\nand to include the potential role of household, neighborhood,\nand national influences acting across time and individuals.\nThe words of a mother in our study--\"each is in different\ncircumstances anyway\" challenged our view of those models\nby suggesting that every mother's situation was different. The\npredominantly hierarchical nature of the above models may\nlimit our attempts to understand the \"deep\" and \"immediate\"\nimpact of personal situations on genetic, developmental,\nfamilial, cultural, social, and intergenerational mechanisms.\nIn contrast to the above layered conceptual frameworks,\nargues that\neverything in the situation both constitutes and affects most\neverything else in the situation in some way . . . People and\nthings, humans and nonhumans, fields of practice, discourses,\ndisciplinary and other regimes/formations, symbols,\ncontroversies, organizations and institutions, each and all can be\npresent and mutually consequential. Here the macro/meso/micro\ndistinctions dissolve in the presence/absence.\nWe will use situational analysis here to identify the inter-\naction of mothers with social structures and the possible\ncausal influence of those social structures on her well-being.\nMethod\nCritical realism and symbolic interactionism provide the\nmeta-theory and philosophical roots for this realist multi-\nlevel situational analysis. The study reported here is part of a\ncritical realist mixed method multilevel study that seeks to\nidentify and explain complex perinatal contextual social and\npsychosocial mechanisms that may influence the develop-\nmental origins of health and disease with a focus on the role\nof postnatal depression (Eastwood, Jalaludin, & Kemp,\n2014). The main study used various qualitative and quantita-\ntive methods, including emergent qualitative analysis\ncipal component (Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp, Phung,\nBarnett, & Tobin, 2012) and exploratory factor analysis\n(Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp, & Phung, 2014b), visualization\nand cluster analysis (Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp, Phung, &\nAdusumilli, 2013), and Bayesian ecological and multilevel\nexploratory spatial analysis (Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp, &\nWe have previously reported the protocol for the main\nstudy which used both Emergent and Construction Phases of\na realist Explanatory Theory Building Method (Figure 1).\nThe study reported here was part of the Emergent Phase\nwhere the focus is on observation, pattern recognition,\nabstract thinking, concept formulation, and theory genera-\ntion. Three methods of theory generation proposed by Haig\n(2005) are Grounded Theory Method, Exploratory Factor\nAnalysis, and Heuristics. Here, we will use the Grounded\nTheory method, \"Situational Analysis,\" as advanced by\nClarke. The Construction Phase of the Main Study will use\nthe findings of the Emergent Phase to construct a conceptual\nframework, theory and model. The Construction Phase\nmethods include the following: (a) defining stratified levels,\n(b) analytic resolution, (c) abductive reasoning, (d) com-\nparative analysis (triangulation), (e) retroduction, (f) postu-\nlate and proposition development, (g) comparison and\nassessment of theories, and (h) conceptual frameworks and\nmodel development.\nConstrucon\nPhase\n\u00b7 Integraon\n\u00b7 Abstract thinking\n\u00b7 Theory Comparison\n\u00b7 Best explanaon\n\u00b7 Proposion\n\u00b7 Conceptual framework\n\u00b7 Modelling\nEmergent\nPhase\n\u00b7 Observaon\n\u00b7 Paern\n\u00b7 Concepts\n\u00b7 Abstract thinking\n\u00b7 Tentave\nframework\nConfirmatory Phase\n\u00b7 Hypotheses\n\u00b7 Operaonalisaon\n\u00b7 Observaon\n\u00b7 Confirmaon\nExplanatory Theory Building\nFigure 1. Phases of explanatory theory building.\nEastwood et al. 3\nSetting, Sampling, and Recruitment\nThe study was approved by the University of New South\nWales Human Research Ethics Committee. The setting was\nfour local government areas (LGAs) in South Western\nSydney, New South Wales, Australia including communities\nwhere we had identified clusters of postnatal depression\n(Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp, Phung, & Adusumilli, 2013).\nThe region has substantial social disadvantage, and has lower\neducation attainment and lower income levels then other\nparts of New South Wales. There is a diverse multicultural\npopulation with 28.4% of the population born overseas com-\npared with 17.8% for the rest of New South Wales. A large\nshopping center, from a global chain, has recently been con-\nstructed adjacent to a recently enlarged University Teaching\nHospital.\nParent participants were from existing \"playgroups.\" The\nthree \"playgroups,\" with three to seven members, were pur-\nposefully selected from (a) a community with dense housing,\nlow socioeconomic circumstances, and high numbers of\noverseas born mothers; (b) a community with predominantly\nsingle dwellings, mixed ethnicity, and average socioeco-\nnomic circumstances; and (c) a community with predomi-\nnantly single dwellings, low socioeconomic circumstances,\nand high numbers of overseas born mothers. The groups\nwere facilitated by a research assistant. This avoided coer-\ncion and kept researcher distance. The focus group discus-\nsion asked, why there might be more or less depression in\nsome suburbs, what the characteristics of those suburbs\nmight be, and whether there are things at a city, state, and\nnational level that might increase or decrease a mother's\ndepression. Based on emerging themes, the third focus group\nwas asked whether communities with high numbers of ethnic\ngroups were likely to have higher rates of depression.\nSelection of participants (n = 8) for practitioner inter-\nviews was by purposeful sampling. Potential participants\nwere identified based on gender, LGA where they worked,\nexperience with population subgroups, professional or indus-\ntry background, and emerging concepts. Interview guides for\nthe initial interviews were as for the focus groups. The ques-\ntions asked changed as analysis was undertaken and concep-\ntual theory emerged.\nAnalysis\nAnalysis of interview transcripts involved initial open cod-\ning followed by axial and selective coding (Charmaz, 2006;\nSaldana, 2009). The interview transcripts were coded line-\nby-line and paragraph-by-paragraph. Each \"incident\" was\ncoded into as many categories that it might fit during the\nearly stages of concept and category generation to enable\nmaximum emergence of patterns and relationships (Glaser,\n1978). Constant comparative analysis was used, including\nacross quantitative and literature analysis, to identify regu-\nlarities, variations, and contrasts that would contribute to\nemerging insights. Situational analysis was used to provide\nmore reflection and in-depth analysis of the discursive ele-\nments. For the purpose of this situational analysis, we used\ntwo types of maps: situational (messy and ordered), and\nTo consider the breadth of issues surrounding a situation,\nmessy situational maps allow for the examination of all the\ndiscourses related to the situation, including those produced\nby individuals, groups, and institutions. The ordered situa-\ntional maps frame and organize the discourses that emerge\nfrom messy maps. The social worlds/arenas maps were\nused to analyze individual and collective actors, key non-\nhuman elements, and the arena(s) within which they are\nengaged. The data for the situational maps and the social\nworld/arenas maps were drawn from interviews, local\nobservations, spatial studies, and from documentary\nsources.As observed by Clarke and Friese, the maps offered\nmeso-level interpretations of the situation including social\norganizational and institutional dimensions (Clarke &\nThe observations and experience of the researchers, from\nworking in the South West Sydney community, were entered\ninto the analysis. It is here in the situational analysis, there-\nfore, that the researchers as clinicians and population health\npractitioners are able to bring to the table their knowledge of\nthe \"situation\" in South West Sydney. Clarke (2005) defends\nthis approach as follows:\nThe last caveat is perhaps the most radical. Researchers should\nuse their own experiences of doing the research as data for\nmaking these maps. There is a saying in the world of qualitative\ninquiry that the person doing the research is the \"research\ninstrument.\" I am further asserting that that instrument is to be\nused more fully in doing situational analyses . . . Beginning even\nbefore a research topic is decided upon, we notice and store\ninformation, impressions, and images about topic areas and\nissues . . . Part of the process of making situational maps is to try\nand get such information, assumptions, and so on out on the\ntable and, if appropriate, into the maps. (p. 85)\nResults\nHome and Neighborhood Analysis\nThe messy working maps described by Clarke were used\nextensively throughout the analysis but are not presented\nhere. The more structured maps (Tables 1 and 2) present the\ndata in terms of the situational elements such as individual\nand collective human actors, silent actors, discursive con-\nstructions, political elements, spatial elements, and major\nissues and debates. Table 1 focuses this analysis on the moth-\ners'close home and neighborhood arenas, while the contribu-\ntion to her situation of wider arenas, is expanded in Table 2.\nThe home and neighborhood situational analysis mapping\nand analysis of relations identified the following concepts:\n(a) expectations and dreams, (b) marginalization and being\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

What is this map telling\nus? First, there is the domestic or home social arena drawn as\nthe dotted circle with an internal light orange shade. The dot-\nted line means that the home is permeable to multiple actions.\nThe arena is made up of few actors: mother, baby, father, and\nothers such as mothers' sister, mother, midwife, visiting\nnurse, and friends. The home is the domain where mother\nand baby spend most of the day. It is here that mothers\nreceive, or do not receive their closest emotional support. It\nis also here that control is lost and expectations are most\nmanifest. Loss of control and failure of expectations may be\nmanifest with a crying, vomit, nappies, unsettled and sick\ninfant, unsupportive partner, and increased financial stress.\nThe expectations are that the house, baby, and relations will\nbe perfect. Those expectations are raised through family,\nfriends, services, radio, magazines, and television. But it is\nhere that expectations are sometimes lost and mothers may\nfeel alone, unsupported, and even marginalized. The physi-\ncal environment adds to stress with houses that are hot, cold,\nmoldy, and isolated from amenities.\nA second arena is the local neighborhood. In this case, it\nis depicted as the immediate close environment. This includes\nneighbors, mothers' groups, buses, general practitioners\n(GPs), and nurses. Other aspects of the neighborhood arena\nare explored in more depth below. Important also are the atti-\ntudes of the local neighborhood to sole parents and teenage\nmothers. These attitudes may be influences by the cultural\nand religious composition of the local neighborhood or wide\ncommunity.\nFamily is very important to most mothers. Her mother is\nclose even when she is physically distant. The family arena\ncan span generations and continents. With it comes culture,\nreligion, emotional support, nurturing, and sometimes finan-\ncial help. But family can also bring expectations and atti-\ntudes to sole or teenage parenthood leaving the mother\nunsupported and alone.\nSupport networks are a well-recognized determinant of\nmaternal depression. This was supported through the focus\ngroups and interviews with practitioners. The support net-\nwork arena contains: school friends, sisters and brothers,\nneighbors, new friends, and mothers' groups. Also necessary\nare cars and telephones. With the support networks come\nconnections, nurturing of mothers, and not being alone.\nThere may, however, also be expectations of parenting prac-\ntices and pressures to conform. Aspects of support networks\noverlap with the neighborhood arena, government arena,\nfamily arena, and services arena.\nThe ServicesArena includes a wide range of public and pri-\nvate services and utilities that reach into the lives of mothers\nand their families. There is close connection with midwives,\nFigure 2. Social worlds/arenas map of mothers' home and neighborhood.\nNote. Center Link is a Government Agency where families receive income support.\nEastwood et al. 7\nnurses, GPs, family support workers, and mothers'groups. The\nservices support the provision of nurturing environments and\nconnections. They also, however, influence and make expecta-\ntions of mothers and families.\nThe arena for government support and policy is only\nlightly touched on in the map. It is clear that this domain\nreaches into the close lives of the family members through\nprovision of income support, maternity and paternity leave\npolicies. The nature of these policies reaches into the lives of\nthe mothers who commented on the means testing of current\npolicies pleading that all parents with babies need support.\nThe financial stress that impacts on families appears to have\nits origins in higher levels of government policy. The govern-\nment arena also places expectations on families which are\nmanifest in policy requirements and expectations of parents.\nExpectations and dreams. The discursive elements of the situ-\national mapping highlighted the importance of expectations.\nAbsent was discussion of the dreams that mothers might\nhave. Yet implicit in comments by mothers were their dreams\nfor the perfect baby, home, and future.\nBoth mothers and practitioners felt that society and moth-\ners expected to (Beck, 1993) take home the perfect baby and\nthat everything was \"going to be fine.\" The reality is often\ndifferent to that portrayed in media such as the \"Huggies\nadverts.\" The shattering of dreams and expectations was\ndescribed in a range of different ways.\nFor mothers with few resources, their hopes for the future\nmay be dashed by the impact of the new baby on both finan-\ncial and emotional resources. This may be especially true for\na young woman who had plans for her life. The reality is\ndifferent as expressed by one practitioner.\n[Parenting] takes a great deal of emotional energy and to do it\nwell, to be available for children and provide all their needs.\nParents that are distracted by adverse environmental factors\nsuch as finance or domestic violence don't have that energy.\nFor some disadvantaged parents, there may, however, be\nno expectations or dreams. One practitioner put it this way:\nI am not sure whether it is hope or whether there is expectation\n. . . Expectation is the better way to put it. These people expect\nlife to get better whereas the other disadvantaged people who\nhave been here, may be 2nd or 3rd generation think this is it.\nMothers implied that they had been \"in control\" of the\nlives (and also their husbands) and \"expected\" to be in con-\ntrol after the baby was born. But this was not always the case\nand several mothers when speaking of the \"loss of control\"\nimplied that this was not their expectation of how mother-\nhood was going to be. With the birth of the baby planning\nahead was no longer possible.\nSociety has expectations of what a \"good mother\" will be\nlike as discussed in relation to the \"Huggies Advert.\" One\npractitioner felt that some mothers \"don't think they are\ndoing a good job.\" Mothers agreed with this expectation.\nSome spoke of expectations raised by helping services such\nas midwives. One mother talked of the stress associated with\nthe nurse visit:\nNow I have to get myself ready, make sure I don't look like I\nhave . . ., so they don't think I am a bad mother.\nDiscussion about the home visit also focused on expecta-\ntions related to \"you are not bonding with your child and you\nare expected to,\" and \"I am going to be graded . . . please\ndon't put me in the high risk.\"\nOne practitioner spoke of \"career women losing it.\"\nSeveral practitioners agreed with the mothers who had spo-\nken of the shattering of expectations of what motherhood\nwould be like. One practitioner put it like this:\nCareer women that have been working, who have had high\nexpectations when they have been working high achievers in\ntheir career, suddenly with a baby thing are crashing in on top of\nthem and it is not going the way they want.\nMarginalization and\"being alone.\" The situational analysis and\nsocial worlds/arenas maps confirmed and strengthened the\nimportance that marginalization and isolation may play. The\nearlier analysis (Eastwood et al., 2015) had identified the cat-\negory of marginalization and isolation and linked it to \"not\nbelonging,\" poverty, access, language, culture, single parent-\nhood, community safety, and living in new neighborhoods.\nExamination of the social worlds map drew attention to\nthe situation that may be experienced by most mothers.\nBuried in the voices of the mothers were stories of \"being\nalone\" with the crying infant, with an absent partner, mother,\nor other support friend. Sometimes, mothers spoke of not\nbeing able to get out seeing their friends. They spoke of how\nimportant the phone call from the nurse was. The descrip-\ntions were powerful and suggested that this situation is expe-\nrienced by many mothers. The link between \"being alone,\"\n\"depression,\" and partner support is clearly apparent in one\nmother's story:\nI go then, thank God Matt's with me. So he can give me the hug,\nduring the night when I am so depressed. That mental help as\nwell. Just Matt going. \"It is ok. I am home. I can relieve you. Go\nhave a shower.\"\nHer related comment was, \"I think a single parent . . . I\ndon't know how they do it?\"\nLoss of power and control. The initial analysis identified moth-\ners' \"loss of control\" as contributing to the development of\ndepressive symptoms. That analysis identified three subcat-\negories related to personal relationships, birth of a new baby,\nand conflicting advice.\n8 SAGE Open\nAlso evident in the discursive elements of the situational\nanalysis was the lack, or absence, of power that mothers\nhave. This lack of power may extend to families with chil-\ndren and those who work to support them. One practitioner\ncommented that\nthere are some women who have social expectations which are\nwell above what the society can let them have.\nWhen discussing mothers in ethnic communities, one\npractitioner spoke of the lack of power that mothers may\nhave in relation to themselves and their baby.\nand lots them they don't have the individual strengths to stand\nfor what they want or they don't know how to form their own\njudgement--what is best for their child or they even have the\npower. But lots of them . . . they don't have the power to say that\nis what I want for my child.\nThe \"loss of power\" is also implicit in comments about\ncareer women who were high achievers with high expecta-\ntions when they were working\nsuddenly with a baby and things are crashing in on top of them\nand it is not going the way they want. They don't have the social\nsupport [and] they don't know the people in the neighbourhood\n. . . I guess they lock themselves in to a mental state where they\nneed some help.\nThe loss of control may therefore be also associated with\na loss, or absence of power. We will explore the possible role\nof power below.\nSupport and nurturing. Support of mothers was identified in\nthe earlier analysis as a strong emerging protective theme.\nThat analysis drew on the findings of not only the interviews\nand focus groups but also systematic reviews of perinatal\ndepression literature and the exploratory data analysis. The\nsocial world/arena maps highlight the potential breadth of\nthis support within neighborhood and home environments.\nThe term nurturing was previously used to describe the care\nof the infant. The concept of nurturing can be broadened to\nencompass the care and protection of the mother and family\nunit. The situational analysis map was silent on a discursive\nelement related to nurturing families. We will revisit the con-\ncept of nurturing below.\nNeighborhood and Macro-Arena Analysis\nTable 2 focuses this analysis on the mother's neighborhood and\nmacro-arenas. The neighborhood and macro-arena situational\nanalysis mapping and analysis of relations identified the fol-\nlowing concepts: (a) Social support networks, social cohesion,\nand social capital; (b) services planning and delivery and social\npolicy; and (c) global economy, business, and media. As previ-\nously mentioned, the findings of situational analysis were then\nused to inform the building of the social worlds/arenas map.\nFigure 3 is the social worlds and social arenas map of\nmothers' neighborhood and macro-arenas. What is this map\ntelling us? First, there is the domestic or home social arena\nthat was explored above. That arena remains central to this\nanalysis and is made up of few actors: mother, baby, father,\nand others such as mothers' sister, mother, midwife, visiting\nnurse, and friends. The home is the domain where mother\nand baby spend most of the day. It is important to again note\nthat there may be expectations, loss of control, loneliness,\nand poor connection to support. The immediate neighbor-\nhood arena was also discussed in above. It is here that physi-\ncal and local social aspects of the environment may impact\non mothers. There may be mothers' groups, buses, and ser-\nvices available but for some these are absent. The neighbor-\nhood may feel unsafe or friendly and this may affect mothers'\nwillingness to leave the home.\nThe Map illustrates two other possible neighborhood are-\nnas. One of these has a \"nice\" local village, library, commu-\nnity hall, and nice-looking homes and physical environments.\nThere is no comment about ethnicity because most people\nare \"Aussie.\" The other neighborhood arena has mixed eth-\nnic peoples and is known as a \"drug capital\" with high levels\nof crime, distrust, and perceived lack of safety. Those neigh-\nborhoods are polarized images of suburbs in South West\nSydney.\nThe expert arena has universities that historically have\nbeen physically distant from the community although their\nexperts worked closely with the neighborhood arenas. The\nexpert arena is closely overlapped with the policy and services\nand social cohesion arenas. These are two areas where univer-\nsities have been active. Big expert hospitals are in the expert\narena with maternity services closely associated. Antenatal\nclasses are close to the hospitals while mothers' groups are\nimbedded in local neighborhoods. The expert voice is strong,\nand South West Sydney has a history of providing expert lead-\nership in innovative services and programs.\nThe Mall plays an important role in the lives of all who\nlive and work in the city and community arena. The Mall is\ndesigned for cars and may not always be mother and baby\nfriendly. The Mall is associated with \"big business,\" media,\nglamour, and expectations of what might be. The Mall has\nreplaced the Town Centre as the place to go to meet friends\nand \"hang out.\" Absent from the Community Arena are\n\"community gardens\" and league teams. There are, however,\nLeague Clubs and fast food outlets. Football teams are\nemerging. The community has a poor bus and train service\nmaking it difficult for mothers to get to The Mall. Important\nin this arena are jobs. South West Sydney jobs are vulnerable\nto changes in global economic fortunes.\nDominant is the policy and services arena. Previous anal-\nysis (Eastwood, Kemp, & Jalaludin, 2016) highlighted the\nimportance of access to services and the important role that\nsupportive government policy plays. South West Sydney has\nlarge public housing estates and relatively poor access to ser-\nvices. Services are not equitably distributed or delivered as\nevident in a visualization of access to nursing services\nEastwood et al. 9\n(Eastwood, 2011). GP services are described as a \"cottage\"\nindustry in many disadvantaged neighborhoods. There are\nfew mothers' groups, and most antenatal classes are held at\nthe hospitals. Federal and State policy plays an important\nrole in the lives of the families in South West Sydney where\nthe term \"battlers\" is used to describe the daily struggle of\nfamilies.\nGlobal and local economics play a powerful role in the\nlives of families. As illustrated in earlier media, advertise-\nments raise expectations for families a similar phenomenon\nto the impact that The Mall may have on some families.\nThere are stark differences in wealth not only between North\nand South West Sydney but also within local communities.\nParts of South West Sydney were settled by the Gentry of\nNew South Wales and that history still divides the region.\nThe power of Big Business to shape lives was illustrated in\nthe voices of local practitioners and mothers. The loss of\nlocal League teams and community gardens are two\nexamples.\nThe neighborhood and macro-arena social worlds/arenas\nmap is traversed by the Social Cohesion Arena. Social cohe-\nsion and its related concepts of social networks and social\ncapital have a positive influence on families and maternal\ndepression. The voices of mothers, practitioners, and our\nquantitative analysis (Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp, Phung, &\nBarnett, 2012; Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp, Phung, Barnett,\n& Tobin, 2012), all suggest the protective influence of sup-\nport and social integration. Global forces are increasing the\nmigration of peoples of different ethnic and cultural back-\ngrounds to South West Sydney. The diversity of peoples is a\nfeature of most South West Sydney suburbs. Previous quan-\ntitative studies have found that postnatal depression is asso-\nciated with mothers not being found in Australia and the\nspatial studies indicated that rates of depression are higher in\nsuburbs with ethnic segregation (Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp,\nSocial support networks, social cohesion, and social capital.Sup-\nport and nurturing of mothers was identified as a strong\nemerging protective theme. That analysis also identified that\nfamily, services, policy, and support networks all played a\nrole in providing a nurturing environment. The above con-\nfirmed the importance of community-level social support\nnetworks, social capital and ethnic integration. All of these\nconcepts point toward the role of connectedness or social\ncohesion as being protective of mothers.\nThe situational analysis confirmed these findings and sug-\ngested that current matters of ethnic segregation, diversity, and\nintegration were part of a broader idea of social cohesion.\nImportant historical elements were identified in South West\nFigure 3. Social worlds/arenas map of mothers' home, neighborhood, and macro-arena.\nSydney related to the phases of settlement and identity. Silent in\nthe data is the historical settlement of Macarthur by land owning\ngentry and the role that the Nepean River played in dividing\nsocial Class. In contrast to the close nit Macarthur communities,\nother parts of the region have large migrant communities and\nnew public and private housing estates with varying degrees of\nsocial cohesion and social capital. The situational analysis sug-\ngests that both economic and policy forces play an important\nrole in shaping the level of social support available to mothers.\nServices planning and delivery and social policy. Initial focused\ncoding identified group-level access to services and support-\nive social policy as key concepts in protecting mothers from\npostnatal depression. The situational analysis confirmed\ntheir important role and suggests that they are linked. The\ndivision between them probably related to the hierarchical\nnature of policy and service delivery in the Australian con-\ntext. The mothers were clear that income support, nurse\nphone calls, and mothers' groups all contributed to support-\ning them when they felt \"out of control\" or depressed.\nAlthough practitioners had clearly played an important role\nin the region, their contribution was silent in the data. Draw-\ning on our own knowledge and experience, we placed the\nexpert arena between influencing policy and service delivery\nand strengthening social cohesion.\nGlobal economy, business, and media. Finally, it is clear from the\ndata that the influence of the global economy, big business, and\nmedia reaches through all levels of the Social Arenas to impact\nsignificantly on the situation for mothers and infants. Related are\nearlier findings that included \"being broke,\" economic marginal-\nization, occupational class, absence of power and control, and\nthe generation of expectations and dreams. Strong global eco-\nnomic forces are also responsible for movement of migrants and\nrefugees to the region of South West Sydney, Sydney, Australia.\nSome are economic migrants while others are from past and\npresent conflicts. Local jobs are vulnerable to global economic\nfortunes, and the landscape of local communities are influenced\nas much by the planning decisions of Big Business as they are by\nplanners and policy makers. Thus, local communities have peo-\nples who once fought each other living side by side.\nThe \"Huggies\" comment by one mother drew attention to\nthe important role played by media and advertising in the ordi-\nnary lives of mothers. The role that media might play in raising\nthe expectations of mothers was previously discussed. Related\nare the pressures put on families by images of large five-bed-\nroom homes (McMansions), four-by-four wagons to drop the\nkids off at school, and the glitter of advertising and merchandise\nin \"The Mall.\" Our earlier analysis also included the comment\non the impact to the local community of losing the local League\nteam as a result of a media-related franchise agreement.\nDiscussion\nPsychological stress has long been recognized as certain\ncause of depression (Avison, Aneshensel, Schieman, &\nStone, Lin, & Quartermain, 2008). The role of explanatory\nresearch is to identify the, often unobserved, mechanisms\nthat trigger or maintain the experienced phenomenon.\nEmerging from our home and neighborhood situational anal-\nysis are two central mechanisms:\nLost Expectations\nBeing alone. Buried in the voices of the mothers were stories\nof \"being alone\" with the crying infant, with an absent part-\nner, mother or other support friend. Sometimes mothers\nspoke of not being able to get out to see their friends. The\ndescriptions were powerful and suggested that this situation\nis experienced by many mothers. We agree, therefore, with\nan \"incongruity between expectations and the reality of\nmotherhood,\" a sense of pervasive loss, and loneliness.\nThe centrality of these two themes is further supported by\nthe neighborhood and macro-arena situational analysis\nwhere powerful economic and media forces had further iso-\nlated mothers and families in neighborhoods that were eco-\nnomically disadvantaged with crime, violence, poor\ntransport, and either ethnically segregated or isolating for\nminorities. The Mall was associated with \"big business,\"\nmedia, glamour, and expectations of what might be.\nOne hallmark of critical realist analysis is the ontological\nassumption that reality consists of hierarchically ordered lev-\nels where a lower level creates the conditions for a higher\nlevel (Danermark & Gellerstedt, 2004). The stratified realist\nontology is not, however, in conflict with Clarke's (2005)\nview that \"everything in the situation both constitutes and\naffects most everything else in the situation in some way.\"\nDanermark and Gellerstedt (2004) argue that \"in reality lev-\nels are entwined and [the] mechanisms could be supporting\neach other or counteracting each other, and the outcome in a\nspecific context is the result of a very complex interplay\nbetween levels and mechanisms.\" Possible structures, mech-\nanisms, contexts, and outcomes are shown below based on\nthe findings from the Situational Analysis and Emergent\nTheory Generation presented here (Table 3).\nThe findings of this analysis will contribute to the mixed\nmethod theory generation undertaken for the Emergent Phase\nof the main study. The subsequent Theory Construction\nPhase undertook abductive triangulation of this and other\nstudies to construct a conceptual framework, theory, and\nLimitations and Strengths\nMothers were interviewed at a mothers'group. Consequently,\nthose mothers had experience of support from a mothers'\ngroup. They placed strong importance on the importance of\nthe groups for establishing and maintaining support networks.\nOne mother noted that support networks may include family,\nfriends, and neighbors. The mothers who attended the groups\nwere not themselves from socially disadvantaged back-\ngrounds, and few mothers were from non-English speaking\nbackgrounds. The number of mothers' groups interviewed\nwas limited in this study to three which may limit generaliz-\nability. Despite these limitations, the qualitative data were\nrich and contributed significantly to both theory generation\nand later theory construction. It was notable that the findings\nfrom this qualitative study are similar to those found by Beck\nin both her original phenomenological (Beck, 1992) and\ngrounded theory (Beck, 1993) studies and her later meta-syn-\nthesis (Beck, 2002). Here, however, we have contextualized\nthe findings within broader social structures and contexts.\nThe qualitative methods used in this realist situational anal-\nysis included interviews and focus groups with qualitative\nanalysis. The strength of these approaches is their ability to\nprovide explanatory power to the analysis (Sayer, 2000) and\nthus the identification of causal mechanisms. Sayer notes,\nhowever, that the \"concrete patterns and contingent relations\n[identified] are unlikely to be `representative', `average,' or\n`generalizable'.\"Assessment of the quality of qualitative stud-\nies is assessed using criteria that differ from those used for\nextensive quantitative studies (Cohen & Crabtree, 2008;\nMiyata & Kai, 2009). The criteria proposed by Kitto and col-\nleagues were used to assess the quality of the current study.\nThe procedural rigor was made explicit through clear articula-\ntion of the ontological and epistemology position informing\nthe study which then informed the emergent and explanatory\nstudy design, methods of data collection and analysis. The\nsampling techniques used were purposeful and sought to\ninclude subjects from different communities, and ethnic back-\ngrounds. Reflexivity was maintained by acknowledging our\ntheoretical perspectives, values, and prior knowledge. Distance\nfrom the subjects was achieved by intentionally engaging a\nresearch assistant to conduct the parent focus groups. We\nsought to \"bracket\" our prior understanding, maximize the use\nof open coding, and thus allow understanding of phenomena\nto emerge from the voices of the informants (Creswell, 1998).\nThe use of qualitative methods for emergent theory build-\ning was suited to the aim and objectives of this study which\nwas to explain the mechanisms by which circumstances influ-\nence developmental and life course outcomes with a focus on\nperinatal depression. Emergent theory building methods such\nas those used here are also consistent with accepted critical\nrealist methodologies (i.e., grounded theory). We were not\nable to identify where situation analysis had been previously\nused for critical realist theory building but, as a symbolic inter-\nactionist methodology, its use within a critical realist episte-\nConclusion\nWe presented here the findings of a realist multilevel situ-\national analysis of maternal depression. The analysis\nmoved from an emergent empirical approach toward the\nmore reflexive and abductive approach of situational anal-\nysis, thus better informing our abductive reasoning and\nthe generation of theory. Critical realism and symbolic\ninteractionism provided the methodological underpinning\nfor the study. We undertook a qualitative study of three\nmothers' groups and eight practitioners. Interviews of\nmothers and practitioners were analyzed using open cod-\ning to enable maximum emergence. Situational analysis\nwas then undertaken using situational and social worlds/\narena maps.\nThe theoretical concepts identified included (a) expecta-\ntions and dreams; (b) marginalization and being alone; (c)\nloss or absence of power and control; (d) support and nurtur-\ning (e) social support networks, social cohesion, and social\ncapital; (f) services planning and delivery and social policy;\nand (g) global economy, business, and media.\nEmerging was the centrality of being alone and expecta-\ntions lost as possible triggers of stress and depression within\ncircumstances where media portrays expectations of mother-\nhood that are shattered by reality and social marginalization.\nWe further observe that powerful global economic and politi-\ncal forces are having an impact on the local situations. The\nchallenge for policy and practice is to support mothers and\ntheir families within this adverse regional and global eco-\nnomic context.\nTable 3.
