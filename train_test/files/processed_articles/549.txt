Wiener, PhD2\n1RTI International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. 2RTI International, Washington, District of\nColumbia.\n*Address correspondence to Wayne L.

E-mail: wlanderson@rti.org\nDecision Editor: Rachel Pruchno, PhD\nPurpose of the Study: Assistive technologies help people with disabilities compensate for\ntheir impairments.This study assessed which of 5 categories of assistive technologies--\nindoor/outdoor mobility, bed transfer, bathing, toileting, and telephone assistance--were\nsubstitutes or complements for human personal assistance by differentiating between\ntotal and formal personal assistance service (PAS) hours.\nDesign and Methods:The study analyzed 2004 National Long-Term Care Survey com-\nmunity-dwelling respondents receiving assistance with activities of daily living. Ordinary\nleast squares (OLS) on total PAS hours was estimated on the entire sample, and logit\nand OLS models were estimated on the likelihood and hours of formal PAS, respectively.\nResults: Assistive technology for indoor/outdoor mobility, bed transfer, and bathing was\nfound to be substitutes for total PAS, whereas assistive technology for bed transfer and\ntoileting was found to be complements for the use of formal PAS.Telephone assistance\nwas not significant for either total or formal PAS hours.\nImplications: The use of some assistive technologies by older people with disabilities\nappears to reduce the amount of informal care provided, but not the amount of paid\nPAS.Thus, this study does not provide support for the hypothesis that the use of assistive\ntechnologies will reduce use of paid care and, therefore, spending for long-term care.\nKey words: Personal assistance services, Home care, Personal care, Assistive technology, Disability\nOlder and younger people with disabilities living at home\ncompensate for their functional limitations by receiving\npersonal assistance from human caregivers and through\nassistive technologies. These assistive technologies range\nfrom common devices such as canes and ramps to more\nhigh-tech devices such as electric wheelchairs and devices to\nmonitor and prompt people with disabilities to take medi-\ncine and perform other tasks like eating. With the increas-\ning demand for long-term care services (Johnson, Toohey,\n& Wiener, 2007; Organization for Economic Co-operation\nand Development, 2006) and a likely long-run shortage of\npersonal care workers (Stone & Harahan, 2010), policy-\nmakers are interested in whether assistive technology can\nbe a substitute for paid long-term care services or whether\nit is a complementary support. If assistive technology is a\nsubstitute for personal assistance, such as when a cane is\nused rather than relying on a human caregiver, then cost\nsavings may be possible by promoting its use. Alternatively,\nif assistive technology is a complement, meaning both are\nused together, such as when a mechanical lifting device is\nResearch Article\nused by a personal assistant for transferring a person to\nand from bed, then providing such technology will increase\ncosts to the extent that it is provided, although it may\nreduce unmet need (Agree & Freedman, 2003).\noccurred in both the U.S. disability rate and how under-\nlying needs of people with disabilities were addressed.\nPrevalence of any type of disability in the older population\nGu, & Lamb, 2006). More recent studies have shown that\nthe disability rate has been relatively constant over the last\nThis decrease in disability rates was coupled with a\ndecline in the need for personal assistance services (PAS)\nin the older population living in the community experienc-\ning difficulty in self-care activities, underlying difficulty\nin performing various tasks declined from 30% to 26%\nand the use of PAS declined from 11% to 9% (Freedman,\nAgree, Martin, & Cornman, 2005). These declines were on\nOne potential driver in the decline in the need for PAS\nis the greater use of assistive technologies over the last\nfew decades (Kaye, Kang, & LaPlante, 2000; LaPlante,\nbled community residents using equipment, with or without\nhuman help, for all activities that were analyzed doubled to\nnearly 30%; in the same population, the proportion relying\nuse of assistive devices with no human help for any deficits\nin the activities of daily living (ADLs) showed an upward\nThe policy implications of these changes are potentially\nfar reaching. With the aging of the population, especially\namong persons aged 85 and older who are more likely to\nhave disabilities, demand for long-term support services\nwill increase dramatically (Vincent & Velkoff, 2010), but\nthe country may face an even greater shortage of long-term\ncare workers to meet that need than exists today (Institute\nof Medicine, 2008). Therefore, understanding what role\nassistive technologies may play in substituting for PAS is\nimportant. Although a major benefit of assistive technolo-\ngies is promoting independence for people with disabilities,\noffsetting the need for formal (paid) care is also important\ngiven the current budget environment. Moreover, reduc-\ning the need for informal care (unpaid care by family and\nfriends) may also increase the labor supply of taxpaying\nPrior research sought to determine whether assistive\ntechnologies and PAS are complements or substitutes. The\nlimited research literature differs on this point, with some\nstudies showing they are complements (Agree, Freedman,\nCornman, Wolf, & Marcotte, 2005), some substitutes\nMortenson et al., 2012), and some both (Allen, Foster, &\nacross studies seem to depend on contextual factors, data,\nand analysis methodologies.\nA critical issue in understanding the relationship\nbetween assistive technologies and PAS use is controlling\nfor differences in disability levels of recipients using these\nservices. If the underlying need is relatively light, some\nassistive technologies may accommodate most or all of\none's need for help. On the other hand, if underlying need\nis great, then substantial amounts of assistive technologies\nand human personal assistance may be needed. Controlling\nfor differences in case mix in analyses is important if\npolicy makers are to accurately assess whether there is a\nsubstitution effect between assistive technologies and PAS\n(Hoenig et al., 2003). Otherwise, higher estimates in regres-\nsion analyses of the effect of assistive technologies on PAS\nwould likely be obtained, reflecting the uncontrolled higher\nlevel of functional limitations.\nTo address these issues, this study identified three\nresearch questions: (a) Are assistive technologies and PAS\ncomplements, substitutes, or both? (b) Which assistive\ntechnologies serve as complements and substitutes? and\n(c) Which assistive technologies have the greatest impact\non paid formal care? We hypothesize that after controlling\nfor potential case mix differences, sociodemographic and\nother factors, all assistive technology types identified in the\nanalyses will substitute for PAS.\nThis study differs from prior research in three ways.\nFirst, not all prior studies distinguished the effects of differ-\nent types of assistive technologies and their effect on PAS.\nSecond, this study uses more recent data, a wider range\nof data to control for case mix differences, and has fewer\nmissing data than prior studies. Third, we employ a two-\npart model to control for downward bias in estimates of\nassistive technology on formal care use.\nDesign and Methods\nConceptual Framework\nFor persons living at home with functional impairment,\nPAS and assistive technologies are used to address limi-\ntations in performing ADLs and other tasks required for\nindependent living. To the extent that persons in need\ncannot obtain sufficient help from assistive technologies\nor informal care, formal care is sought for any remain-\ning needs. Given that formal care often is paid at taxpayer\nexpense (Kaye, Harrington, & LaPlante, 2010; Wiener,\n2006), differentiating between formal and informal care\nuse is important, as well as assessing the amount of for-\nmal care needed (Agree et al., 2005). Overall though, from\nboth practical and research perspectives, it is important\nto understand the extent to which assistive technologies\ncan reduce total PAS, regardless of whether PAS is paid or\nnot (Hoenig et al., 2003). This study analyzes the effects\nof assistive technology types on three related outcomes:\ntotal PAS, the probability of using any formal PAS, and the\namount of formal PAS used if any.\nBecause many state Medicaid programs provide home-\nand community-based services depending on the degree\nto which an individual cannot perform ADLs (O'Keeffe,\nMaier, & Freiman, 2010), we grouped an extensive list of\nmore than 100 assistive technologies in our data by the ADL\ndomains that they addressed. This effort was aided by the\nsurvey questionnaire, which had solicited responses about\nassistive technologies used by ADL domain. Prevalence of\nuse was high enough for various assistive technologies for\nus to create four ADL domains: indoor/outdoor mobility,\nbed transfer, bathing, and toileting. Prevalence was too low\nto form categories for assistive technologies addressing eat-\ning and dressing because doing so would have produced\nspurious regression estimates for these low prevalence cate-\ngories. Finally, we also sought to create at least one assistive\ntechnology category designed to meet instrumental activi-\nties of daily living (IADLs), but prevalence of these types\nof assistive technologies was too low to support more than\none group--providing assistance with using the telephone.\nWe included a broad range of functional impairment\nand health measures as case mix controls in multivariate\nanalyses (Hoenig et al., 2003). The degree of functional\nimpairment may be indicated by how many ADL and\nIADL deficits a person has. In addition, whether they have\ndementia may affect the ability to use assistive technology\n(O'Keeffe et al., 2010). The need for supervision among\npersons with Alzheimer's disease may limit the ability of\nassistive technology to substitute for formal PAS. Health\nfactors potentially affecting the need for PAS are hypoth-\nesized to include the number of chronic conditions (Hoenig\net al., 2003) and self-reported health status. In addition,\nwhether someone actively participated in the community\nmay serve as an indicator of one's overall ability, which can\nbe measured by whether they participated in events outside\nthe home at least once in the past month.\nA range of demographic and socioeconomic characteris-\ntics also are hypothesized to affect PAS receipt (Agree et al.,\nwere considered as confounders that needed to be controlled\nrather than key issues of interest for this study. Considering\ndemographic characteristics, increasing age may result in\ngreater need for PAS because of the greater risk of disability\nand the declining availability of care from spouses. Women\nhave been found to have a higher need for PAS than men\nbecause of greater longevity and the tendency of men to\nmarry women who are younger than them. Whites when\ncompared with people of other races may have greater use\nof PAS because of possible discrimination against other\nraces and greater informal supports among older people\nin ethnic communities. In terms of socioeconomic status,\npersons with less education and income may be more likely\nusers of PAS because of the greater willingness to receive\ninformal support. Finally, persons with Medicaid are more\nlikely to receive PAS because home- and community-based\nservices are covered under the program.\nData\nThis study analyzed the 2004 National Long-Term Care\nSurvey (NLTCS), which was sponsored by the National\nInstitute on Aging and conducted by the U.S. Census\nBureau, which includes a nationally representative sample\nof the community and institutionalized populations aged\n65 and older. Sample members are selected from a list of\neligible Medicare beneficiaries provided by the Centers\nfor Medicare & Medicaid Services. The survey contains\ninformation about ADL and IADL disabilities, helpers and\nhours of help provided, equipment use, medical conditions,\ncognitive function, and demographic and socioeconomic\ncharacteristics (National Archive of Computerized Data on\nAging, n.d.).\nThe NLTCS began with a screener interview to deter-\nmine a person's functional and residential status.Individuals\nwho are not functionally impaired and living in the com-\nmunity were given an abbreviated interview. Persons with\nfunctional impairment and living at home, the sample of\ninterest for this study, were administered a detailed com-\nmunity interview.\nProxies knowledgeable about the sample person's health\nconditions and physical activities were interviewed instead\nof or along with the sample member if the sample person\nwas unavailable or unable to respond to survey items. The\nproportion of proxies participating varied across sections\nof the survey instrument, but comprised about one fifth of\nall respondents.\npleted a community interview. To construct our analysis\nsample, we excluded people who were not in need of long-\nterm care services or were missing certain data.Respondents\nwere excluded from the analysis sample if they were part\nof the new Medicare cohort that had no functional impair-\nment (729 people), had no ADL or IADL deficits expected\nto last 3 months or more (1,175 people), had ADL or IADL\ndeficits but no helpers (1,143 people), and had unknown\neducational status (59 people) or unknown overall health\nents. Thus, the analysis sample population consisted of\nolder people with ADL or IADL disabilities.\nThree dependent variables were created for regression\nanalyses. The first two, total PAS hours in the past week\nfor use in an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and\nwhether any formal PAS was used in the past week for use\nin a logistic regression, were analyzed using the full sample\nof 2,081 respondents. The third dependent variable, num-\nber of formal PAS hours in the past week, was analyzed\nwith the 686 respondents with such care using an OLS\nregression.\nThe NLTCS includes questions about the hours of help\nreceived because of a disability or health problem as per-\nceived by the sample person/proxy. Respondents were\nasked \"During the past week, how much time did someone\nhelp you because of a disability or health problem?\" These\nquestions were asked about both formal (paid) and infor-\nmal (unpaid) caregivers.\nThe NLTCS includes information on more than 100\nassistive technologies. Five variables representing assistive\ntechnology use were created as the key policy variables of\ninterest for use in regressions. Each respondent was char-\nacterized as using or not using each of five domains of\nassistive technology. The five domains were technologies\nintended to address indoor/outdoor mobility (e.g., wheel-\nchairs, walkers, canes, railings, crutches, elevators, ramps,\northopedic shoes, leg or back braces, chairlifts on stairs,\nand prostheses), bed transfer (e.g., bed lift, wheelchair, and\nwalker), bathing (e.g., shower seat, tub stool, handle bar,\nhand held shower, and rubber mat), toileting (e.g., raised or\nportable toilet, grab bar, and special underwear), and the\ntelephone (e.g., amplifier and enlarged dialer).\nA variable was created for informal PAS hours in the\npast week and used as an independent variable in the logis-\ntic and OLS regressions on formal PAS use. The remaining\nindependent variables served largely as controls in all regres-\nsions. These variables included a range of functional sta-\ntus, health status, demographic, socioeconomic, and health\ninsurance characteristics. In particular, we created a count\nvariable for five ADL deficits (movement, eating, transfer-\nring, bathing, and toileting) and an IADL deficit count vari-\nable for nine IADLs (e.g., doing housework and laundry,\nmanaging money, shopping, and using the telephone). About\n15% of the sample had missing values for income, which\nwas imputed using the demographic variables in the analysis.\nMethods\nFive analytic techniques were used in the analyses. First, we\nused the NLTCS weights to estimate descriptive statistics.\nSecond, because PAS hours in the past week are skewed\nto the right with few respondents having large numbers of\nhours, we created a more normal-shaped distribution by\nlogging the PAS hours measures when used as a dependent\nvariable. Third, when making postestimation predictions of\na logged dependent variable, a smearing factor was used\nwhen transforming a logged distribution back to a normal\ndistribution (Duan, 1983). Fourth, the assistive technology\nvariables were interacted with the variable for informal\nPAS hours but were not statistically significant and had\nsmall coefficients. As a result, these interactions are not\nincluded in the final equations. Finally, marginal effects\nwere calculated to estimate the effects of separately using\neach individual assistive technology. To do so, predictions\nwere first estimated by making all sample members have\na given assistive technology, then again with no one hav-\ning that assistive technology. After making those estimates,\nthe difference between the two predictions for each sam-\nple member was calculated. Each prediction was estimated\nwith confidence intervals so as to determine whether the\nmean difference in the sample for using versus not using\neach assistive technology was statistically significant.\nResults\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics for the full sample of\n2,081 respondents receiving some type of PAS. The propor-\ntions for dummy variables in the table are reported as per-\ncentages in the text. The mean of the first three dependent\nvariables, total (formal and informal) PAS hours in the past\nweek, was 30.2hr (2.4hr when logged), but many respond-\nents reported far fewer hours. Approximately 25.1% of the\nsample received fewer than four total PAS hours per week,\nand 38.3% received fewer than eight total PAS hours per\nweek (not shown). On the other hand, 11.2% of respond-\nents received 80 or more total PAS hours per week.\nOne third (33.0%) of respondents reported using any\nformal (paid) PAS, the second dependent variable. The\nmean of informal PAS hours across the sample regardless of\nany use was 22.2hr, much higher than the mean for formal\ncare. Approximately 85.7% of all respondents reported\nreceiving some informal PAS in the past week, with a mean\nof 25.9hr if any informal PAS was used (not shown).\nAssistive technology use ranged from 68.4% of respond-\nents using assistive technologies for mobility-related needs\nto 9.3% using assistive technology for the telephone. In\naddition, about 61.2% used assistive technology for bath-\ning, 46.3% used assistive technology for toileting, and\n40.5% used assistive technology for getting in and out\nof bed. Approximately 8.7% of respondents reported no\nassistive technology use.\nRegarding functional status and health characteris-\ntics, respondents averaged 2.9 ADL deficits and 4.9 IADL\ndeficits. Most respondents (85.7%) reported having at least\none ADL deficit (not shown). Few (14.3%) respondents\nreported having only IADL deficits.\nApproximately 32.6% of respondents/proxies reported\nthe presence of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease or mild\ncognitive impairment. On average, respondents reported hav-\ning five chronic conditions based on a list of conditions iden-\ntified in the NLTCS. For self-reported health status, 13.7%\nreported being active in the community. Several demographic\ncharacteristics are also reported in the table. Almost half of\nthe sample (47.7%) was age 85 and older. In terms of health\ninsurance, 10.5% of the sample had Medicaid coverage.\nThe third dependent variable, the natural log of formal\nPAS hours in the past week if any formal PAS hours were\nRespondents with formal PAS use reported receiving an\naverage of 14.0hr of informal PAS in the past week. Table 2\npresents results on remaining analytic variables, differing\nfrom Table 1 by the samples involved in regressions.\nTable 3 presents cross-tabulations of the proportion of\nrespondents using various types of assistive technologies\nwith regard to their use of formal PAS. Respondents with\nformal PAS hours in the past week usually had much higher\nproportions of assistive technology use than respondents\nwithout formal PAS hours. For example, in the overall sam-\nple, 75.7% of respondents with any formal PAS in the past\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics for theTotal Sample (n = 2,081)\nDomain Variable Mean SD SE\nSource: RTI International analysis of the 2004 National Long-Term Care Survey.\nweek used assistive technology for mobility issues, whereas\nonly 64.8% of respondents with no formal PAS did so.\nA similar relationship holds for each assistive technology\ntype examined.\nOf the five assistive technology variables in each of\nthe three regressions (Tables 4\u00ad6), only one was sta-\ntistically significant in each OLS regression (indoor/\noutdoor mobility for the total PAS regression and tel-\nephone assistive technology for the formal PAS regres-\nsion). Three assistive technology variables (bed transfer,\nbathing, and toileting) were statistically significant in\nthe logistic regression of receiving any formal PAS with\nall three regressions, coefficients of independent vari-\nables showing statistical significance at p < .05 had\nthe expected positive or negative sign based on the\nTable 2.

For example, regarding demo-\ngraphic, socioeconomic, and functional status char-\nacteristics in logistic analysis of receiving any formal\nPAS, people who were women, older, had Medicaid\ncoverage, and people who were more ADL and IADL\nimpaired had a greater likelihood of using any formal\nPAS. In the OLS regression on formal PAS hours, there\nwas approximately a one-for-one trade-off with infor-\nmal care hours. That is, an increase in 1\nhr of formal\nPAS hours was associated with a roughly 1hr decrease\nin informal care hours. R2 estimates in the two OLS\nregressions were .28 and .34, showing good model fit\nand potentially good control of case mix differences\nacross respondents as indicated by statistically signifi-\ncant case mix coefficients.\nThe marginal effects calculations of the changes in total\nand formal PAS hours in the past week that were per-\nformed after the regressions were run indicate that assistive\ntechnology use is associated with lower total PAS hours,\nbut modestly higher formal PAS hours (Table 7). Assistive\ntechnology for indoor/outdoor mobility, bed transfer, and\nbathing was each associated with approximately 8-hr\nreductions in total PAS hours in the past week. Neither\nassistive technology for toileting nor telephone was statisti-\ncally significant. In contrast, assistive technology for bed\ntransfer and toileting was each associated with about a 4-hr\nincrease in formal PAS hours in the past week. Assistive\ntechnologies for indoor/outdoor mobility, bathing, and\nphone were not statistically significant predictors of formal\nPAS hours.\nTable 4.

Source: RTI International analysis of 2004 National Long-Term Care Survey.\nDiscussion\nWith the aging of the population, policymakers face three\ninterrelated strains concerning the financing and deliv-\nery of long-term care (Commission on Long-Term Care,\n2013). First is the rapidly growing need for additional\nlong-term care services. If current use rates are held con-\nstant, the number of people needing informal care, home\ncare, and nursing home care will roughly double between\ntor is a likely substantial increase in public spending\non long-term care that will accompany the increase in\nuse. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment projects that public long-term care expen-\nditures in the United States, which were about 1% of\nin 2050 (Organization for Economic Co-operation and\nThe third factor is that the number of people likely to\nneed long-term care services will likely increase much faster\nthan the working age population, which may create worker\nshortages that threaten the ability to provide needed ser-\nvices even if financing is available (Institute of Medicine,\nthe working age population (people aged 20\u00ad64) to the\npopulation most likely to need long-term care (people aged\nTable 5.

Source: RTI International analysis of 2004 National Long-Term Care Survey.\nFaced with these pressures, policymakers are seeking\nstrategies that can reduce the upward demand for ser-\nvices. One hypothesis is that the use of assistive tech-\nnologies can reduce the need for paid and unpaid PAS,\nthereby reducing the need for public spending and long-\nterm care workers and the strains on informal caregivers.\nPrevious research has produced inconsistent findings as\nto whether assistive technology is a substitute or com-\nplement to PAS (Agree & Freedman, 2000; Agree et al.,\nMortenson et al., 2012). In addition, by reducing the\nneed for human assistance, assistive technologies may\nprovide greater independence and improved quality of\nlife for people with disabilities.\nThis study found a complex relationship between assis-\ntive technology and PAS use. In our analysis of the 2004\nNLTCS, across the total sample, assistive technology for\nindoor/outdoor mobility, bed transfer, and bathing each\nresulted in about an 8-hr decrease in total PAS hours during\nthe past week. Given that the mean for total PAS hours in\nthe past week was about 30hr, these three assistive technol-\nogy types resulted in about a 25% reduction each in total\nPAS hours. These reductions in total PAS hours appear to\nresult in only lower informal care hours because assistive\ntechnology use either had no or only modestly positive\neffects on formal care use. Only assistive technology for\nbed transfer and toileting had statistically significant effects\non formal PAS hours in the past week. These two assistive\nTable 6.

Thus, they served as com-\nplements for formal PAS rather than substitutes. In other\nwords, some assistive technologies appear to reduce infor-\nmal care, but not paid care, and others are associated with\nmodestly higher levels of paid care. This study did not find\nevidence that assistive technologies reduced paid care.\nWhy use of various assistive technologies would sub-\nstantially reduce informal care hours but modestly increase\nformal care hours is uncertain. One possibility is that both\ninformal and formal caregivers also benefit from assistive\ntechnology use by care recipients. More obviously, informal\ncaregivers such as family and friends effectively decrease\ntheir care time and responsibility if assistive technology is\nused. But formal caregivers may also benefit from assistive\ntechnology use if they would have been providing even\nmore care had it not been for assistive technology use by\ntheir care recipients. Formal care providers may be instru-\nmental in recommending assistive technology for heavy-\ncare recipients to keep care hours under the authorized\namount of care by third-party payers and to potentially\nprevent injury to workers, both of which are benefits that\naccrue largely to public payers. Given that most assistive\ntechnology types had no effect on formal care hours, some\nassistive technology may make the job of formal caregivers\neasier even if it modestly increases formal care hours.\nAnother possibility is that assistive technology cannot\ncompletely address the total needs of people with disabil-\nities and that PAS are still needed. When comparing the\nmean estimates of assistive technology use for respond-\nents with formal PAS (Table 2) versus the entire sample\n(Table 1), respondents with formal PAS were greater users\nof assistive technology than those without formal PAS. Even\nafter controlling for case mix, it is likely that respondents\nwho were less severely disabled might have been able to use\nassistive technology for most or all of their functional needs\nand therefore may have used fewer PAS hours as result. On\nthe other hand, more disabled respondents might have been\nable to use assistive technology for only some of their needs\n(or a given assistive technology type may not have com-\npletely compensated for their entire need for help for the\ntask) and so had to use more hours of PAS than those with\nless disability to make up for their additional need for help.\nGiven the benefits of assistive technologies for reduc-\ning total PAS hours, it is notable that assistive technol-\nogy is not used by everyone. One distinct difference of\npolicy significance is that assistive technology use rates\nare approximately 25%\u00ad50% higher among those using\nformal PAS compared with those not using formal PAS.\nEven so, among persons with no formal care use, except\nfor telephone assistive technology, assistive technology\nuse rates range from only 35% to 65%. One possibility\nis that assistive technologies may not be as accessible to\nthose relying only on informal care because they do not\nknow about them, do not know how to obtain or pay for\nthem, or cannot afford them. Wider adoption of assistive\ntechnologies by those with only informal care use would\npromote greater independence and increased quality of\nlife among such users and potentially allow caregivers\neither respite time or a greater opportunity to work. It\nmay also be possible that they may not want to use assis-\ntive technology if it means less personal interaction with\nfamily and friends. The technology also may not work\nequally well for all individuals.\nThe potential reduction in PAS hours is only one meas-\nure of the benefits of assistive technology. In addition, assis-\ntive technologies may also reduce the intensity of formal\ncare activities or stretch informal care resources in ways\nthat our formal and informal PAS measures did not cap-\nture. These additional benefits may offset initial costs of\nacquiring and learning to use assistive technologies for\nwhich this study did not account.\nAlthough this study provides new information about\nthe relationship between assistive technology and the use\nTable 7.

The potential inad-\nequacy of the case mix control variables is the primary\nstudy limitation. The marginal effects calculations derived\nfrom the regressions are unbiased only if regression mod-\nels adequately control for case mix differences in care need\nacross recipients. Otherwise, we would overstate the effect\nof assistive technologies on PAS and not observe the substi-\ntution effect found in total PAS hours. High R2 values for\nmodel fit (meaning we found an adequate set of case mix\nadjusters), and the statistically nonsignificant findings, or\nmodest positive effects of assistive technology use on for-\nmal care use, suggest that case mix differences are largely\ncontrolled.\nThis study used measures for functional and cognitive\nstatus, the number of chronic conditions, self-reported\nhealth status, and community participation to control for\ncase mix differences. Using older NLTCS data, Hoenig and\ncolleagues (2003) found that assistive technology use and\nPAS are correlated with frailty, but once frailty is controlled\nfor, a substitution effect was found, resulting in four fewer\ntotal PAS hours per week if any assistive technologies were\nused. The current study also found a substitution effect for\ntotal PAS hours, subject to modestly higher formal care use\nfor two assistive technology types.\nIn addition to any potential failure of case mix controls,\nthis study had four other limitations. First, cross-sectional\ndata were used, whereas panel data may have provided bet-\nter detection of changes in formal and informal PAS over\ntime. Moreover, some assistive technologies have changed\nsubstantially over time and with those changes the dynam-\nics between assistive technologies and PAS may have\nchanged as well.\nSecond, formal and informal care and assistive technol-\nogy use may be simultaneously determined in practice, sug-\ngesting potential endogeneity between PAS and assistive\ntechnology use. No plausible instrumental variable was\navailable to allow for potential correction with two-stage\nleast squares estimation, and such estimation is known to\nintroduce measurement error in estimates. This approach\nis consistent with the work of other researchers (Agree\nalthough this study addresses PAS utilization, it does not\nassess needs for services; thus, it cannot address whether\npeople using assistive technology have fewer unmet needs.\nFourth, the study only examines the impact of assistive tech-\nnologies on the use of PAS in the community. Assistive tech-\nnologies also may help prevent or minimize significant care\nneeds with high costs (e.g., emergency room visits, hospital\nadmissions, or nursing home use), although some studies\nhave found that home care use does not substantially affect\nacute care use (Anderson, Wiener, & Khatutsky, 2006).\nFifth, our categorical measures of assistive technology treat\neach device within each ADL category as equal, whereas\ndifferent devices within an ADL category may not have the\nsame importance or value in decreasing PAS hours.\nUnderstanding the relationship between assistive tech-\nnology and PAS use, and how both affect the disablement\nprocess, can lead to better policies to promote independ-\nent living. Future research on this topic could focus on the\nimpact of the newer \"high-tech\" assistive technologies and\non the effectiveness of assistive technologies for certain\nsubpopulations, such as people with Alzheimer's disease\n(O'Keeffe et al., 2010). Improvements in assistive technol-\nogy devices and policies to promote assistive technology\nadaptation are needed to promote greater use. The goals of\nincreased use of assistive technologies should be to increase\nthe independence of people with disabilities, reduce the\nstrain on informal caregivers, and reduce the need for ser-\nvices by paid caregivers.\nFunding\nThis work was supported, in part, by the National Institute\nfor Disability and Rehabilitation Research, U.S. Department of\nCalifornia, San Francisco, with a subcontract with RTI International.\n"
