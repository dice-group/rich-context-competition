Existing\nand purpose-developed auditory tasks that maintained the cognitive requirements of established visually presented Gs\nmarkers were completed by 96 university undergraduates. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed that the\nauditory tasks combined with established visual measures to define latent Gs and reaction time factors.These findings provide\npreliminary evidence that suggests that if auditory tasks are developed that maintain the same cognitive requirements as\nexisting visual measures, then they are likely to index similar cognitive processes.\n",

The abilities referred to are\nthose identified in current taxonomies of human intelli-\ngence--including theory of fluid intelligence and crystal-\nlized intelligence (Gf\u00adGc theory; see, for example, Horn &\nthe issue is of interest because the extent to which these abili-\nties might reflect modality-specific versus general cognitive\nprocesses is not entirely clear. Moreover, it has been noted\npreviously that an adequate description of intelligence will\nreflect knowledge of the basic forms in which it is manifest\nwithin each of our sensory\u00adperceptual modalities (Horn &\nStankov, 1982). This knowledge is still lacking.\nThere is reason to suppose that intelligence is revealed\nother than just via the visual system. Consider the auditory\nmodality: It is the prime channel for communicating and\nacquiring information during infancy, and this reliance only\nshifts to the visual system at about 5 years of age (Sloutsky\n& Napolitano, 2003). Thus, auditory abilities are crucial for\nthe normal development of intelligence, and children with\nhearing impairments, or total hearing loss, are disadvantaged\nbecause of lack of exposure to abstract concepts (Stankov,\n1994). Research showing that the average IQ of deaf people\nis lower than that of people with normal hearing (Vernon,\ngral role audition plays in human intellectual functioning.\nDespite this obvious importance, audition has been\nreferred to as the neglected domain in intelligence models\nago noted that prior to his PhD study there was nothing in the\nfield of intelligence research concerned specifically with\ngeneral auditory intelligence (Ga). Although previous\nresearch had explored the various abilities manifested in the\nauditory modality, unlike Stankov's study, these studies were\nnot themselves concerned with how auditory abilities posi-\ntion themselves within the taxonomy of intelligence or relate\nto existing cognitive abilities (for a review of this auditory\nresearch see Shuter-Dyson, 1968; Shuter-Dyson & Gabriel,\nnoted again that evidence on the structure of auditory abili-\nties remained scant because most factor-analytic studies had\n\"totally neglected the domain of auditory abilities\" (p. 365).\nCarroll's and Stankov's concerns have remained unheeded,\nhowever, and Seidel (2008) recently reiterated the ongoing\nneglect of putative auditory cognitive abilities. Our under-\nstanding of general auditory intelligence (Ga) has pro-\ngressed. However, research concerning how these auditory\nabilities relate to established broad intellectual factors (e.g.,\nGf) and other traditional measures of intelligence remains\nscarce.\n1University of Adelaide, South Australia\n2CSIRO,Adelaide, South Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nIan Zajac, School of Psychology, University of Adelaide, South Australia\nEmail: ian.zajac@adelaide.edu.au\nDeveloping Auditory Measures of General\nSpeediness:A Pilot Study\nIanT. Zajac1, Nicholas R. Burns1, andVanessa Danthiir2\n Keywords\nintelligence, auditory intelligence, speed of processing, general speediness\n2 SAGE Open\nStankov (1994) has previously proposed that auditory\nabilities form three hierarchically organized layers compris-\ning sensory, perceptual, and thinking processes. Abilities at\nthe sensory level relate weakly with each other as well as to\nthe higher order processes (Seidel, 2008), and they relate\nweakly to abilities in other sensory modalities. They are best\nmeasured using acuity tasks that determine thresholds for\nfrequency discrimination, loudness discrimination, spatial\nlocalization, and the like. At the highest thinking level, how-\never, the abilities are intellective in nature and the reliance on\naudition is incidental. Auditory speech abilities are an exam-\nple of this highest level. According to Carroll (1993), speech\nabilities rely not on the sensory and thus modality-specific\naspects of the tasks, but rather on the ability to grasp the\ncomplex and demanding relationships among elements of\nthe problem (Stankov, 1994). In this sense, these auditory\nspeech tasks are similar to traditional visual Gc marker tests\nin which performance does not rely so much on the percep-\ntion of two visually presented words, for example, but rather\non the cognitive processing required to decide whether they\nare synonyms or antonyms. According to this logic then, it\nwould appear that broad cognitive abilities that have been\ntraditionally measured using visual tasks might also be mea-\nsurable using the auditory modality provided that the audi-\ntory tasks are designed to maintain the same cognitive\nrequirements as corresponding visual tasks, as opposed to\nmore modality-specific type processes.\nSome of Stankov and Horn's studies (Horn & Stankov,\ntheory. Correlations between a select few auditory tasks and\nbroad factors defined by traditional visual measures suggest\nthat Gf and Gc can be measured auditorily. Listening to ver-\nbal comprehension, for example, loads moderately on Gc\n(Horn & Stankov, 1982), whereas tonal series and chord\nseries have been shown to load on Gf (Stankov, Horn, &\nRoy, 1980). Elsewhere, there is evidence that auditory tem-\nporal discrimination tasks might possibly relate to memory\nfunctions (see, for example, Stankov et al., 1980; Zajac &\nBurns, in press), and indeed, the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests\nof Cognitive Abilities (Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather,\n2001) includes auditory measures of short- and long-term\nmemory, which are considered independent from the Ga\ntasks in that battery. The research literature regarding so-\ncalled elementary cognitive tasks (ECTs) indicates that there\nmight also be a link between performance on auditory ECTs\nand general speed of processing (Gs). For example, studies\nof auditory inspection time (AIT) suggest the existence of a\nrelationship between auditory functions measured by AIT\ntasks and Gs-type abilities, with the spatial version of AIT\nexhibiting stronger and more consistent relationships in this\nregard than other versions of this task (see Zajac & Burns,\nvisual RT (VRT) tasks relate well to Gs (Danthiir, 2005;\nDanthiir, Wilhelm, Schulze, & Roberts, 2005), and they also\nrelate strongly to auditory reaction time (ART) tasks (Sen,\nJensen, Sen, & Arora, 1983). Given the apparently similar\nprocesses tapped by them, it is plausible that ART might also\nrelate to broad Gs, and there appears some preliminary evi-\ndence supporting this idea (Zajac & Burns, in press).\nA pertinent issue concerning these putative relationships\nbetween auditory tasks and broad abilities other than Ga is\nthat there have been few such reports, and they have received\nlittle attention because the studies have been primarily inter-\nested in auditory abilities themselves. Moreover, in studies\nthat have reported such relationships, the broad abilities with\nwhich the auditory tasks correlate have generally been poorly\ndefined, often being measured by only a single marker test.\nConsequently, this leaves these associations open to many\ndifferent interpretations.\nThe purpose of the current study was to begin to fill the\nvoid in research concerning the relationship of auditory abil-\nities to other, specific broad factors in the taxonomy of intel-\nligence. Rather than adopting the approach of administering\na battery of auditory tasks and subsequently assessing their\ncorrelations with traditional ability measures, this study\naimed to explore whether auditory tasks can be purpose\ndesigned to measure a single, specific broad factor. We felt\nthis method was advantageous because it potentially permits\nan understanding of the relationship of auditory abilities to a\nspecific broad ability as well as providing a new understand-\ning of the broad ability itself. More specifically, if auditory\ntasks are developed that maintain the same cognitive require-\nments as visual tasks, then the visual and auditory tasks\nshould correlate well. However, if no relationships are found,\nit may be necessary to question the generality of the relevant\nbroad ability and why it was not possible to measure it audi-\ntorily, for instance, \"Should this broad ability be regarded as\nvision specific, given that only visual tests appear to define\nit?\"\nThe present study focused on the broad ability Gs for two\nreasons: First, some existing ECTs such as ART and AIT\nhave been suggested as measuring Gs, but they have never\nbeen systematically investigated. Second, traditional Gs tests\nare quick and easy tasks, and many lend themselves readily\nto adaptation to presentation in the auditory modality. When\ndeveloping new auditory tasks, the nature of Gs must be\ncarefully considered and preserved if the tasks are to prove\nsuccessful. In short, Gs subsumes intellectually easy tasks\nthat require rapid scanning and responding (Horn & Noll,\n1994). The elementary nature of these tasks is paramount\nbecause this is what distinguishes Gs from higher level\n(accuracy-based) factors, where performance is a function of\ndifficulty. Controlling item difficulty in pure tests of speed\nensures that performance only reflects the rate at which par-\nticipants complete the items in the test (Carroll, 1993). Thus,\nthe rationale for this research dictated that auditory tests be\nobtained or designed to represent processes analogous to\nexisting visual Gs marker tests. Therefore, some tasks have\nbeen adapted from previous work--such as ART--whereas\nothers were newly developed. Regarding the latter, we\nZajac et al. 3\nselected visual tasks that we thought could be translated into\nan auditory format, thereby ensuring consistency in the cog-\nnitive requirements across modalities. Examples of these\nvisual Gs tasks include Symbol Digit (McPherson & Burns,\n2005), Number Comparisons (Ekstrom, French, Harman, &\nThe study reported herein was designed to pilot these new\nauditory tasks. Our primary aims were to (a) gather data\nregarding the test\u00adretest reliability of these auditory mea-\nsures; (b) examine the correlations between the auditory and\nvisual tasks, specifically the auditory/visual analogous; and\n(c) explore the underlying factor structure of the auditory\nand visual tasks to determine whether they load on the same\nfactors as opposed to modality-specific type factors.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were (N = 96) undergraduate psychology stu-\ndents of the University of Adelaide. There were 69 females\nand 27 males, and the mean age of the sample was 20.0 years\n(SD = 4.0 years). All participated as part of their 1st-year\npsychology course requirements.\nApparatus\nThe presentation of all tasks and recording of responses\nwere controlled by one of three identical Pentium 4 class\ncomputers. Visual stimuli were presented on 17-inch LCDs.\nAuditory stimuli were presented via Sony MDR-XD100\nstereo headphones. All auditory tones were calibrated prior\nMeter.\nRT Measures\nSimple ART. To begin each trial, the participant pressed the\nnumber \"5\" key in the numeric keypad of the keyboard. This\nkey acted as a nonfunctional home button only and ensured\nthat responses originated from the same position on each\nsented, followed, after a silent interval of variable duration\nHz. Participants lifted their finger off the number \"5\" key\nand pressed the number \"8\" key as quickly and as accurately\nas possible. Participants were required to complete 10 cor-\nrect trials out of 10 before they proceeded to the test. The\noutcome measure was mean RT--time between onset of tar-\nget and pressing of response key--calculated after the\nremoval of outliers (\u00b13 SD) and errors.\nTwo-choice ART (ART\n). The target tone in this task was\npresented to the left or right ear only. Participants responded\nby pressing the number \"4\" key if the target tone was played\nto the left ear or number \"6\" if it was played to the right ear.\nAll other aspects of the task were identical to ART.\nThree-choice ART (ART\n). During this task, the target tone\nwas presented to the left ear only, both ears, or right ear only.\nParticipants responded by pressing the number \"4\" key in the\nnumeric keypad for the left ear, number \"8\" if it was played\nto both ears, or number \"6\" for the right ear. All other aspects\nof the task were identical to ART.\nVRT. This task was functionally equivalent to ART but\nrequired participants to respond on the illumination of an\nempty circle, 4 cm in diameter, presented against the black\nbackground of the computer screen. The white outline of the\ncircle was presented at the onset of each trial and acted as a\ncue, and the circle illuminated red after a variable duration of\nGeneral Speed of Processing Measures\nSymbol Digit. A computerized coding task was used as a\nmeasure of Gs (see McPherson & Burns, 2005, for a detailed\ndescription of this task). A code table was presented at the\ntop of the computer screen throughout the task. This com-\nprised nine symbols arranged horizontally to which nine dig-\nits, presented directly beneath them, were paired. For each\nitem, one symbol was presented in the center of the computer\nscreen and participants responded by left clicking the mouse\non its corresponding digit in a 3 \u00d7 3 numerical grid posi-\ntioned at the bottom of the screen. Subsequent items did not\ncommence until a correct response was registered. Partici-\npants were required to complete two practice trials correctly\nbefore they proceeded to the test. The outcome measure was\nthe number of items correctly completed in 2 min.\nAudio code (AC). This task was developed to be an auditory\nanalogue of the Symbol Digit task described above. A code\ntable was displayed at the top of the computer screen for the\nduration of the task, comprising of pictures of eight musical\ninstruments arranged horizontally, to which one of the num-\nbers one through eight was paired. The instruments include a\nsnare drum, trumpet, guitar, cymbals, piano, bell, harp, and\nviolin. For each item, the sound of one of the instruments\nwas presented via headphones at an intensity of 65 dB. Par-\nticipants responded by left clicking the mouse on its corre-\nsponding digit in a 2 \u00d7 4 numerical response grid positioned\nat the bottom of the screen. Subsequent items commenced\nafter a response was registered. Participants completed two\nfamiliarization phases: In the first, instrument names were\npresented and participants clicked on the corresponding\ninstrument (two trials each) and in the second, instrument\nsounds were presented instead of text (two trials each). Fol-\nlowing this, participants were required to complete four test\ntrials for each instrument correctly before they could proceed\nto the test phase. The outcome measure was the number of\nitems correctly completed in 2 min.\nChasing-digits auditory (CD\nA\n). This was designed to be an\nauditory analogue of the digit\u00addigit task used by McPherson\n4 SAGE Open\nand Burns (2005), which was found to share substantial vari-\nance with Gs marker tests. It incorporated a 3 \u00d7 3 numerical\nresponse grid positioned in the center of the computer screen\nagainst a black background. For each item, one of the digits,\none through nine, was presented auditorily to participants via\nheadphones at an intensity of 65 dB; trial order was pseudo-\nrandomized with the restriction that no digit could be pre-\nsented on successive trials. The participant responded as\nquickly and accurately as possible by left clicking the mouse\non the corresponding number in the response grid. Subse-\nquent items commenced 200 ms following the response. Par-\nticipants were required to complete 10 correct trials out of 10\nbefore they proceeded to the test. The outcome measure was\nthe number of items correctly completed in 60 s.\nTone comparisons (TC). This task was developed to be an\nauditory analogue of Number Comparisons from the Kit of\nFactor-Referenced Cognitive Tests (Ekstrom et al., 1976).\nTrials consisted of two sequentially presented tones, which\nwere identical or differed by either a semitone or tone. Tones\nwere presented at an intensity of 65 dB, and participants\nclicked the on-screen response button \"Yes\" if they thought\nthe tones were identical or \"No\" if they were different. Par-\nticipants were required to complete five correct trials out of\nfive before they proceeded to the test. The outcome measure\nwas the number of items correctly completed in 90 s.\nHearing As (HA\nS\n). This task was an auditory version of the\nsearch task, Finding As (see, for example, Danthiir et al.,\nwere nouns, five to eight letters in length. All words had a\nconcreteness-of-imagery value of 600 or above, on a scale\nmum abstractness and the highest indicated maximum con-\ncreteness. Of the 60 words, 15 contained the letter \"A,\" and\nall of these used the long vowel pronunciation. The purpose\nof this was to reduce any potential spelling confusion that\nmight occur for the short vowel sound--where the pronun-\nciation of the \"A\" is not as distinct--or in the case of silent\n\"A.\" Participants were informed of this restriction.\nWords were presented pseudorandomly--one at a time--\nat an intensity of 65 dB. To respond, participants pressed the\non-screen button \"Yes,\" if the word contained an \"A\" or\n\"No,\" if it did not. Participants were required to complete\nfive correct trials out of five before they proceeded to the\ntest, and practice trials used different stimuli to the test phase.\nThe outcome measure was the number of items correctly\nVisual InspectionTime (VIT)\nThe vertical lines inspection time task was used to estimate\nVIT. Stimuli were presented on a video monitor at a viewing\ndistance of approximately 60 cm. Preceding the target figure\nwas a warning cue of approximately 520 ms; the cue was a\nsmall white plus (+) sign measuring 6 \u00d7 6 mm presented\nin the center of the computer screen. The target figure\nconsisted of two vertical lines: one measured 15 mm and the\nother 30 mm. These were joined at the top by a horizontal\nline of approximately 18 mm. The shorter line appeared on\neither side of the target figure equiprobably. A \"flash mask\"\nreplaced the target figure and consisted of two vertical lines\n35 mm in length, shaped as lightning bolts. Participants\nindicated on which side the short line appeared by clicking\neither the left or right mouse button, respectively. Practice\ntrials required 10 correct trials out of 10 with stimulus onset\nasynchrony (SOA) of approximately 835 ms, 10 correct tri-\ntrials out of 10 with SOA approximately 250 ms. The esti-\nmation process began with SOA approximately 250 ms and\nfollowed an adaptive staircase algorithm (Wetherill &\nLevitt, 1965). The average SOA--or mean VIT threshold--\nwas calculated over eight reversals of direction on the stair-\ncase, giving an estimate of the SOA with an associated\nprobability of 79% of making a correct response.\nProcedure\nOn arriving at the testing session, participants were seated in\na cubicle in our laboratory, and they were guided through the\ntest battery automatically by the computer. Detailed instruc-\ntions and practice phases were presented prior to the onset of\neach task, and the first author was present to answer any\nquestions. Participants completed the tasks in the following\norder: ART, CD, HA\nS,\nSymbol\nDigit, and VRT. Each RT task consisted of 60 trials, and the\ntotal testing session lasted for 1 hr and 45 min.\nTo obtain test\u00adretest reliability estimates for the new\nauditory tasks, n = 17 participants returned 6 weeks after the\ninitial testing session. Because of limited time, participants\ncompleted ART\nonly, along with the new tests AC, CD,\nHA\nS\n, and TC. Test\u00adretest reliability estimates were not\nobtained for the VIT task because of time restrictions and\nthe fact that it is typically good (see Kranzler & Jensen,\nResults\nData Preparation\nOutliers (\u00b13 SD) and errors were removed from individual\nRT data files and the average number of trials used to calcu-\nART\nvariables, there were three missing values and eight outliers\n(i.e., \u00b13 SD). These values were deleted and subsequently\nimputed using the expectation maximization algorithm in\nZajac et al. 5\nReliability Estimates\nTable 1 presents reliability estimates for the tasks. Split-half\nreliability is presented where possible and test\u00adretest esti-\nmates are provided for the auditory measures. As can be\nseen, reliability was generally good, with split-half and test\u00ad\nretest estimates being acceptable for the new auditory mea-\nsures.\nDescriptive Statistics and Correlations\nTable 2 presents the descriptive statistics for the test battery.\nOf interest is that, although AC maintained very similar\ncognitive requirements to Symbol Digit, the number\neffect, however, with ART performance being significantly\nTable 3 shows the full correlation matrix for all measures.\nTo summarize, AC and Symbol Digit correlated moderately,\nsuggesting that they measure a similar construct. The simple\nRT tasks--ART and VRT--also correlated strongly. HA\nS\n,\nCD, and TC were developed based on existing Gs marker\ntests, and they related weakly to AC and Symbol Digit, and\nshared variance with the RT measures also. The RT tasks\ngenerally correlated moderate-to-strongly with each other.\nFactor Analysis\nAs we had developed the auditory measures to be analogous\nto existing visual speed tasks, we had explicit expectations\nabout the factorial structure underpinning the test battery.\nSpecifically, we expected that RT tasks would define a latent\nRT factor and that AC, Symbol Digit, HA\nS\n, TC, CD, and VIT\nwould define a latent Gs factor. Despite these hypotheses,\nrather than use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in first\ninstance, we erred on the side of caution and instead used\nexploratory factor analysis (EFA) to assess whether this\nexpected structure would emerge naturally.\nFirst, we explored the suitability of the data for EFA using\nthe Measure of Sampling Adequacy (.75), and both showed\nthat the data were acceptable for EFA. Next, the visual and\nauditory speed tasks were entered into a principal compo-\nnents analysis. There were two components with eigenvalues\n16.9% of the variance respectively. An inspection of the\nscree plot confirmed two dominant factors. Using the eigen-\nvalue and scree criteria as a guide, we extracted two factors\nusing maximum likelihood estimation with promax rotation.\nTable 4 presents the results of these analyses.\nAs can be seen, the expected structure emerged well.\nThere is a clear RT factor defined by the visual and auditory\nRT measures. There is also a possible speediness (Gs) factor\ndefined by the remaining visual and auditory speed tasks. Of\ninterest, although it was assumed that CD would share more\nin common with the Gs-type measures, it appears to load\nmore strongly on the RT factor.\nWe tested the reliability of this EFA solution in Mplus\n(Muthen & Muthen, 1998) using CFA with maximum likeli-\nhood estimation. In our first model, we tried to confine CD\nto the Gs factor as per our initial expectations, but despite all\ntasks having moderate loadings, results showed that the fit of\nparative fit index [CFI] = .80, root mean square error of\napproximation [RMSEA] = .13, standardized root mean\nsquare residual [SRMR] = .09. Therefore, we followed the\nEFA solution with regards to CD as well as the theoretically\nsensible suggestion of modification indices to allow the\nresiduals of ART and VRT to covary. Permitting these\nchanges in a subsequent model resulted in adequate fit, 2(33)\nTable 1.

As can be seen, the correla-\ntion between the RT and Gs factors was moderately strong\nand in the expected direction. Importantly, loadings of the\nvisual tasks--Symbol Digit, VIT, and VRT--were as strong\nas those for the auditory tasks suggesting that the latent fac-\ntors may not be reflecting modality-specific processes.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of the present study was to pilot some newly\ndeveloped auditory tasks designed to measure the broad abil-\nity Gs. The tasks were derived from existing paradigms or\nwere purpose-developed to maintain the cognitive require-\nments of established visually presented Gs marker tests. To\nthe extent that the auditory tasks were successful measures of\nGs, we expected to find correlations between them and visual\nGs tasks that have typically measured speed of processing.\nFirst, we assessed the reliability of the auditory measures\nand found these to be generally acceptable. Of particular\ninterest were the new auditory measures, with the strong\nsplit-half reliability estimates indicating that the constructs\nmeasured by these tests did not appear to change much dur-\ning the course of completing them. This provides some evi-\ndence that item difficulty was consistent within the individual\nmeasures, an important characteristic of speed tasks because\nit ensures that performance reflects the rate at which examin-\nees complete the items in the test, rather than item difficulty\n(Carroll, 1993). Test\u00adretest reliability estimates were col-\nlected approximately 6 weeks after initial testing, and they\nwere also acceptable, showing that the measurement con-\nstructs did not alter over this period.\nSecond, EFA suggested that two latent factors under-\npinned performance on the auditory and visual tasks. Based\non factor loadings, these were identified as latent RT and Gs.\nSubsequent confirmatory analysis supported this solution,\nand latent RT and Gs factors shared 35% of their variance.\nImportantly, the two visual tests loading on Gs (VIT, Symbol\nDigit) had moderate loadings of a similar magnitude to the\nauditory measures on this factor. Similarly, VRT loaded on\nRT moderately and comparably with the three ART tasks.\nThis suggests that both the Gs and RT factors might not be\nreflecting auditory-specific processes because, if this were\nso, the loadings of visual tasks on these factors might be\nexpected to be markedly weaker than those observed herein.\nAs already noted, these data were collected during a pilot\nstudy of auditory tasks, and consequently, these results\nshould be considered in light of several limitations. For\nexample, test\u00adretest reliability estimates were only gathered\nfor a relatively small subsample of participants. Thus,\nalthough they appeared adequate in the present study in\nterms of their magnitude, they need to be replicated in a\nlarger sample. Similarly, for the CFA undertaken herein, the\npresent sample of N = 96 should not be considered optimal.\nFuture investigations of these auditory tasks should increase\nsample size to at least N = 200 to ensure these complex pro-\ncedures have sufficient statistical power (see, for example,\nBarrett, 2007).Based on the above analyses, which showed\nthat auditory and visual tasks combined to define latent fac-\ntors and that the loadings of visual tasks relative to auditory\ntasks were comparable, we have speculated that the speed\nfactors may not be modality specific but rather reflect cogni-\ntive processes underpinning performance across all tasks. It\nis certainly the case, however, that visual tasks are underrep-\nresented in this pilot study, and this is a serious limitation.\nThe number of visual tasks was limited due to the nature of\nthis pilot study and in light of time restrictions on participant\ntesting. Elsewhere, it has been noted that the identification of\nlatent factors generally requires three or more measures\nTable 3.

Thus, it is entirely plausible that dis-\ntinct visual speed factors did not emerge during the present\nanalyses because we did not meet this requirement for the\nvisual tasks. It is essential that this issue be addressed in\nfuture research by ensuring that a sufficient number of tasks\nfrom each modality are used to permit the identification or\notherwise of modality-specific speed factors. An alternate\nmethod of exploring this issue would include administering\nmore typical auditory ability (Ga) tests in conjunction with\nthese auditory speed tasks and examining their shared\nvariance.\nNotwithstanding these limitations, the present study pro-\nvides preliminary evidence that broad cognitive abilities\nsuch as general speediness (Gs) might be measurable via\nalternate modalities such as audition. It appears that if audi-\ntory tasks are designed to engage the same cognitive pro-\ncesses as visual tasks, then they should index the same broad\ncognitive abilities. These preliminary findings should at least\nencourage research into other broad abilities and the extent\nto which they might be measured auditorily. Such research\nmight ultimately result in the development of more \"truly\nbalanced\" measures of intelligence (Horn, 1968).\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBarrett, P.
