In the present time of\nprivatization and liberalization, the public sector, in particular,\nneeds to take a look at its work environment. In this productiv-\nity- and performance-led global economy, participation in deci-\nsion making is one of the important mechanisms and if\nemployees feel that they are not empowered, then the perfor-\nmance and competitiveness of the organizations are at stake.\nAlso, in the rapidly changing business environment, the\nemployee\u00ademployer relationship undergoes a considerable\namount of stress that leads to low commitment and high attri-\ntion. Employees form the most important resource of an orga-\nnization. The employees in an organization have to be highly\ntalented to achieve sustainable competitive advantage (Barney,\n1991). There is an increasingly diverse nature of workforce in\norganizations. They engage in social interactions and economic\ntransactions within and outside their organizations. Capabilities\nand efforts of employees are important sources of competitive\nadvantage.\nIt is well known that\norganizations that are wholly or partially owned and controlled\nby the state government are referred to as public sector\nundertakings (PSUs) in India. In a PSU, majority (51% or more)\nof the paid up share capital is held by central government or by\nany state government or partly by the central governments and\npartly by one or more state governments. (Public Sector\nThe rationale of PSUs is rapid economic development,\nreduction of concentration of economic powers, balanced\nregional development, generating employment opportuni-\nties, import substitution, export promotion, and resource\nmobilization. Government orders for PSUs generally aim at\nbetterment of the society (Peng, Bruton, Stan, & Huang,\n2016). Arms and ammunition, defense equipments, defense\naircrafts, warships, atomic energy, railways transport, heavy\nmetals, aircraft, ships, petroleum, coal, natural gas, and\npower generation come under PSUs in India.\nAccording to Performance Report (2015), in India, \"all\npublic sector undertakings collectively accounted for 23.2\npercent of the total market capitalization\" and \"9 percent of\nIndia's total export earnings was contributed by these\n1National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, India\nCorresponding Author:\nS.

Many\nof these organizations have significant worldwide presence\nand are expanding (Peng et al., 2016). However, these PSUs\ndo not have their own theory contextualized unlike other\nIn PSUs, employees from diverse cultural backgrounds\ncome together. This diversity does not affect them in work-\ning together. They often work collaboratively in taking\nday-to-day decisions related to work (Ojasalo & T\u00e4htinen,\n2016). Participation in decision making allows individuals\nto share influence among themselves who are not hierar-\nchically equal (Wagner, 1994). Participative management\npractices help to maintain a balance on the involvement of\nmanagers as well as the subordinates in daily tasks and\nactivities related to the job. Increased levels of participa-\ntion in work-related tasks can positively enhance the men-\ntal health of employees (Kukenberger, Mathieu, & Ruddy,\n2015). Employees have goals that require interaction with\nother employees including cooperation and interdepen-\ndence (Rogers & Ashforth, 2017). As a result, employees\nfeel motivated in their work and they feel highly satisfied\nwith their work. Substantial positive results are obtained in\ntheir performance. In this context, trust and participation\nof employees in decision-making processes are the two\nimportant variables worth studying.\nIn the recent past, scholars have done research on trust as\nan important managerial resource across organizations. Trust\nis an integral part of daily social activities. It is essentially\nconsidered as a facilitator that reduces transaction effort\n(Bromiley & Cummings, 1995). Trust increases interdepen-\ndence among individuals and reduces uncertainty among\nthem (Lleo, Viles, Jurburg, & Lomas, 2017). It is known to\nwork as a lubricant in functioning of organizations. It may\nincrease voluntary activities between individuals and organi-\nzations. Employees who trust their peers and managers are\nmore likely to accept organizational goals and they are highly\nsatisfied and committed to their job. Participation influences\nwork practices, recognition, and rewards. It is believed that\nparticipation correlates with job satisfaction and affective\ncommitment (Scott-Ladd, Travaglione, & Marshall, 2006).\nThe role of job satisfaction as a mediator between trust and\noutcome variables needs to be studied.\nIn India, organizational factors such as management poli-\ncies and work environment have been cited as the important\nreasons behind affective commitment and alienation of\nemployees (Sinha, 1990). PSUs are complex because of mul-\ntiple goals with conflicting interests of different stakeholders\n(Narayan, 2016). An employee with a good amount of affec-\ntive commitment will be ready to support the organization\nwhenever needed. It has been established from a review of\npast studies that there are several beneficial outcomes of trust\nsuch as job satisfaction, affective commitment, and group\ncommitment (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005; Shore, Tetrick,\nMorrow (1993) has defined affective commitment as an\nattitude that reflects feelings such as attachment, identifica-\ntion, or loyalty to the subject of commitment. It has strong\nrelationship with group-level outcomes and citizenship\nbehaviors because individuals impart greater effort when\nthey get motivated by high levels of attachment, identifica-\ntion, and internalization (Giri & Kumar, 2013). Employees\nexhibit distinguishable levels of affective commitment\ntoward their organization as well as their work group\n(Johnson & Yang, 2010). Hence, the present study has\nfocused on individual's affective commitment toward his or\nher work group. Affective group commitment has been\nlabeled as simply group commitment in this study following\nthe convention in past research (Cohen, 2003).\nA work group consists of a group of employees working\ncollectively to complete organizational goals (Hackman,\n1987). Work groups have been believed to facilitate many\npositive organizational results such as employees' motiva-\ntion, job satisfaction, and production (Mathieu, Maynard,\nRapp, & Gilson, 2008). A work environment without con-\nflicts and with good amount of trust would help in learning\nwithin work groups. In addition, if employees are highly\nmotivated and engaged in group-level activities, their job\nsatisfaction levels and satisfaction with coemployees\nincrease.\nGroup commitment is relatively less researched for its\nantecedents and outcomes (Kukenberger et al., 2015). Group\ncommitment is attracting research for its importance in orga-\nnizations. Impact of group commitment on affective commit-\nment has not been examined to the best of researchers'\nknowledge. Relationship between job satisfaction and affec-\ntive commitment has to be examined in the presence of group\ncommitment as a mediator. Also, mediating role of job satis-\nfaction needs to be studied. To address the paucity of research\nin affective commitment toward organizations as well as\ngaps in the group commitment literature, a model is described\nand represented that has empirically tested the influence of\ntrust and participation in decision making on job satisfaction,\naffective commitment, and group commitment.\nLiterature Review\nTrust and Job Satisfaction\nExcellent employment relationship is based on trust in orga-\nnization (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005). Trust between\nemployees and managers delivers positive outcomes in an\norganization. Many studies suggest that the increase of trust\ntoward superiors is because of favorable perceptions of the\nemployees (Lau & Sholihin, 2005). Presence of trust enables\nlong-termstabilityandwell-beingof employees(Appelbaum,\nLouis, Makarenko, & Saluja, 2013; Cropanzano & Mitchell,\n2005). Trust may facilitate well-being of employees as they\nKumar and Saha 3\nhave support of organizational members. However, it was\nfound that trust within management did not predict job satis-\nfaction in certain organizations (Robertson, Gockel &\nBrauner, 2012). It is argued that greater trust in an organiza-\ntion may lead to greater job satisfaction of employees in the\norganization (Chen, Aryee, & Lee, 2005). The reasoning is\nasserted on the basis that management and peers, rather than\nany other general aspect, help to get the work done through\nsharing knowledge and ideas.\nTrust and Group Commitment\nTrust between employer and employee is necessary to build\ncommitment (Rogers, 1995). Trust between work group\nmembers helps members identify themselves with their work\ngroup. It also helps to increase commitment of employees\ntoward a work group who are members of the group\nsuggested that trust among members of a work group helps\nin the success of the work group (Cho & Poister, 2014).\nHence, it can be deduced that presence of trust among\nemployees may generate group commitment among mem-\nbers of a work group.\nTrust and Affective Commitment\nOrganizations need to build trust among its employees for\ntheir own well-being at work (Peterson, 1998). Affective\ncommitment fosters when employees feel they are being\ntreated and valued for their contributions by the organization\naffective commitment comprises of positive feelings of iden-\ntification, attachment, and involvement with the organiza-\ntion. A recent study had concluded that production and\nadministrative staff were attached to their organization as\nthey trusted their management (Lleo et al., 2017). It is antici-\npated that trust of employees in their managers may act as a\nmeans to develop affective organizational commitment of\nemployees.\nParticipation in Decision Making and Job\nSatisfaction\nParticipation in decision-making processes gives employees\na sense of belongingness toward the organization by consid-\nering their opinion in important matters. To reciprocate such\nprivileged actions, employees would exhibit identification\nand loyalty with their organization. Research suggests that\nemployee participation across organizations is increasing\n(Saha & Kumar, 2015). Participation improves flow of infor-\nmation and, hence, transparent and open communications\noccur (Anderson & McDaniel, 1999). Employees whose\nopinions are considered for taking work-related decisions\nhave positive views about their job (Ornoy, 2010). Thus,\nemployees who view that their organizations are behaving in\ntheir interest may experience greater job satisfaction (Parnell,\nParticipation in Decision Making and Group\nCommitment\nParticipation in decision making and commitment may be\nrelated to each other as evident in past research (Louis & Smith,\n1992). High levels of organizational commitment are observed\nin employees who participate in decisions (Giri & Kumar,\n2013). Participation in decision making facilitates performance\nof a work group (Chen, Kirkman, Kanfer, Allen, & Rosen,\n2007). When employees have the ability to participate in deci-\nsion making, they perceive it as an organizational support for\ntheir work group to perform better (Kukenberger et al., 2015).\nParticipation may positively affect group commitment by\nbringing the members of a work group close to each other.\nParticipation in Decision Making and Affective\nCommitment\nEmployees who participate in decision making may be moti-\nvated to deliver better performance because they feel very\nhappy when their opinions are considered while making\ndecisions (Saha & Kumar, 2015). Affective commitment\narises over time as an individual presents his views and opin-\nion over work matters (Ojasalo & T\u00e4htinen, 2016). Every\nemployee who is attached to his or her organization would\nwant to have some form of influence in work-related deci-\nsions (Giri & Kumar, 2013). This might strengthen affective\ncommitment of employees toward their organization.\nJob Satisfaction and Group Commitment\nCertain tasks in organizations involve working in teams. In\nsuch cases, team spirit or group commitment should develop\namong individuals. This gives rise to fair job satisfaction lev-\nels of employees (Halepota & Shah, 2011). Randall and Cote\n(1991) studied that group commitment evolves from social\nties of individuals and with job satisfaction in an organiza-\ntion. When the reference team members provide guidance\nand support to an individual, their social ties would improve.\nFurthermore, it generally determines satisfaction with group\nachievements (Baran & Giderler, 2017). Hence, group com-\nmitment of the employee would also increase.\nJob Satisfaction and Affective Commitment\nJob satisfaction is of interest to employers and continues to\nbe studied because it is considered to be a desirable outcome\nof employment. Job satisfaction is more likely to generate\ngood levels of group commitment. Highly satisfied employ-\nees would exhibit higher levels of performance and produc-\ntivity as they believe in the values of the organization\n(Srivastava, 2012). Research indicates that these employees\nmay become affectively attached to their organizations (Saha\n4 SAGE Open\n& Kumar, 2015). For example, an individual tends to show\nemotional bonding toward his organization when he is satis-\nfied with all aspects of his job such as colleagues and work\nhours.\nGroup Commitment and Affective Commitment\nGroup commitment is defined as attachment of an individual\nwith other members in the organization (Randall & Cote,\nresearch on group commitment was related to organizational\ncommitment conceptually or empirically. Work group com-\nmitment is responsible for enhancing social involvement\n(Randall & Cote, 1991). They explained that an individual\nseeks guidance and reassurance from one's work group.\nSocial ties between the individual and the organization are\nstrengthened in this manner. Another reason for analyzing\ngroup commitment as a separate variable together with affec-\ntive commitment is the need to demonstrate the distinction\nbetween the two commitments.\nGroup commitment is believed to have an impact on orga-\nnizational commitment (Cohen, 2003). When employees\nwork in teams, they develop ties among themselves.\nEmployees of a work group share similar interests. This per-\nception of having similar interests may be associated with\ngroup commitment (Ellemers, Kortekaas, & Ouwerkerk,\n1999). To assess the performance and time a work group will\nlast, it is necessary to understand the impact of group com-\nmitment on affective commitment (Ellemers et al., 1999).\nJob Satisfaction as a Mediator\nAccording to Baron and Kenny (1986), a variable can act as\na mediator when the following terms are met: (a) significant\nlevels of variation in the presumed mediator are caused by\nvarying levels of the independent variable, (b) significant\nvariations in the dependent variable caused by the presumed\nmediator, and (c) a previous significant relation between a\ndependent variable and independent variable becomes less\nsignificant due to the presence of presumed mediator.\nHowever, multiple commitments were not included in the\ntest for mediation.\nOrganizations emphasize on job satisfaction of employ-\nees. Job satisfaction may promote commitment of an\nemployee toward his work group (Halepota & Shah, 2011).\nAn employee needs to trust his colleagues to be able to work\ncomfortably (Appelbaum et al., 2013). To achieve job satis-\nfaction, members of a work group should trust each other\n(Cho & Poister, 2014). This gives rise to the role of job satis-\nfaction as a mediator between trust and group commitment.\nGroup Commitment as a Mediator\nGroup commitment is a relatively new term (Cohen, 2003).\nThere is hardly any study that has examined the role of\ngroup commitment as a mediator in organizational behav-\nior literature except one. Paille (2009) reported that group\ncommitment acts as a mediator between support variables\nand commitment. It is beneficial to have employees who\nare committed to work and organization. Satisfaction and\ncommitment with work is considered as a boon by organi-\nzations. Job satisfaction may help employees to develop\npositive feelings about the job to enhance his affective\ncommitment (Appelbaum et al., 2013). It may also pro-\nmote group commitment of employees who are members\nof a work group (Randall & Cote, 1991). This, in turn, may\nhelp employees to build commitment toward the work\ngroup (Cohen, 2003). This gives rise to mediating role of\ngroup commitment between job satisfaction and affective\ncommitment.\nObjectives\nTo investigate the effects of predictors, trust, and participa-\ntion in decision making on outcomes, job satisfaction, group\ncommitment, and affective commitment, empirical analysis\nis needed. In addition, mediating impact of job satisfaction\nand group commitment between predictor and outcome is\nexamined. The objectives are listed below.\n1. To find the impact of trust on job satisfaction, group\ncommitment, and affective commitment;\n2. To find the impact of participation in decision mak-\ning on job satisfaction, group commitment, and affec-\ntive commitment;\n3. To find the impact of job satisfaction on group com-\nmitment and affective commitment;\n4. To examine the impact of group commitment on\naffective commitment;\n5. To investigate the mediating role of job satisfaction\nbetween trust and group commitment; and\n6. To investigate the mediating role of group commit-\nment between job satisfaction and affective\ncommitment.\nHypotheses Development\nEmpirical analysis has been done by developing the follow-\ning hypotheses (Figure 1).\nHypothesis 1 (H1): Trust will be positively related to job\nsatisfaction.\nHypothesis 2 (H2): Trust will be positively related to\ngroup commitment.\nHypothesis 3 (H3): Trust will be positively related to\naffective commitment.\nHypothesis 4 (H4): Participation in decision making will\nbe positively related to job satisfaction.\nHypothesis 5 (H5): Participation in decision making will\nbe positively related to group commitment.\nKumar and Saha 5\nHypothesis 6 (H6): Participation in decision making will\nbe positively related to affective commitment.\nHypothesis 7 (H7): Job satisfaction will be positively\nrelated to group commitment.\nHypothesis 8 (H8): Job satisfaction will be positively\nrelated to affective commitment.\nHypothesis 9 (H9): Group commitment will be positively\nrelated to affective commitment.\nHypothesis 10 (H10): Job satisfaction will mediate the\nrelationship between trust and group commitment.\nHypothesis 11 (H11): Group commitment will mediate\nthe relationship between job satisfaction and affective\ncommitment.\nFigure 1 demonstrates the hypothesized model based on\nthe literature review.\nMeasures\nMcAllister's (1995) scale was used to measure trust. It has\n10 items (e.g., \"I would have to say that we have made con-\nsiderable emotional investments in our working relation-\nship\"). The items are measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale\nranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree.\nParticipation in decision making was measured using a\nscale developed by Van Veldhoven and Meijman (1994)\nconsisting of eight items (e.g., \"Can you discuss work\nproblems with your superior?\"). All items were measured\nusing a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from always to\nnever.\nTo assess job satisfaction, Warr, Cook, and Wall's (1979)\nscale was used, which has a total of 15 items (e.g., satisfac-\ntion with freedom to choose your own method of working).\nAll items were measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale rang-\ning from I am extremely satisfied to I am extremely\ndissatisfied.\nAffective commitment was measured using Meyer and\nAllen's (1991) scale. It consisted of eight items (e.g., \"I\nwould be very happy to spend the rest of my career with this\norganization\"). All items were measured on a 5-point Likert-\ntype scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree.\nGroup commitment was assessed using Ellemers, de\nGilder, and Van den Heuvel's (1998) scale. It consisted of\nseven items (e.g., \"I am prepared to do additional work when\nthis benefits my work team\"). All items were measured on a\n5-point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly agree to\nstrongly disagree. The items to measure the different vari-\nables have been included in the appendix.\nStatistical Tools and Techniques Used for Data\nAnalysis\nThe Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and\nWarpPLS were used to analyze the data. The statistical anal-\nyses such as obtaining descriptive statistics, developing the\ncorrelation matrix, and calculating Cronbach's alpha values\nof the various measures used in the study have been analyzed\nusing SPSS. WarpPLS tool was used to perform some\nadvance statistical techniques such as creating structural\nequation models. The hypothesized structural model emerg-\ning from the review of literature was subjected to analysis\nand fit tests. For this purpose, a variety of goodness-of-fit\nwere utilized. The hypothesized model was tested and the\nconclusions regarding the model fit and acceptance are\nreported.\nMethod\nManagerial cadre respondents from four different large-scale\norganizations termed as PSUs in India constituted the sam-\nple. These organizations belonged to bauxite, petroleum, and\nheavy industries and the states covered were Orissa, Madhya\nPradesh, Delhi, West Bengal, Assam, Maharashtra, and\nKarnataka. Data were collected by visiting the organizations\nin person. Convenience sampling technique was adopted to\nidentify organizations. This procedure entails participation\nfrom all regions based on convenience, willingness, interest,\nFigure 1. Hypothesized model.\nNote.

However, care was taken to include\nparticipation from all regions of India. The sample consists\nof employees from different departments, namely, human\nresource (HR), finance, electrical, instrumentation, mining,\ncivil, environment, tender and contract, sales, production,\nchemical, lab, research and development, and several other\ndepartments. Participation of employees in this study was\nvoluntary. Respondents were asked not to disclose their iden-\ntities so that the identities are anonymous. They were\nrequested to respond to all the questions. It took a maximum\nof 45 min to completely respond to the questionnaire. The\nfilled questionnaires were collected over a period of 5 days\nfrom each of the organizations.\n65%) questionnaires were received back. Few incomplete\ntionnaires were retained for the study. Of these subjects,\n95.6% were males and the rest were females; 85% were\nreported to be married and the rest were single; 13.3%,\nrespectively. There were 44% participants each in entry-\nlevel management and middle-level management; 12.1%\nwere in senior-level management. The average years of\nwork experience across all levels of management was 14.14\nyears. In the overall sample, 61.3% subjects had BE/BTech\nas highest qualification, 36.2% had ME/MTech/MBA as\nhighest qualification, and 2.5% had PhD as highest qualifi-\ncation. Among all subjects, the maximum tenure was found\nEmpirical Results\nTo study the behavior of the variables in the hypothesized\nmodel, statistical analysis was performed using variance-\nbased structural equation modeling (SEM) by using the par-\ntial least squares (PLS) approach.\nThe data were subjected to statistical analysis to test the\nabove hypotheses. First, mean, standard deviation, reliabil-\nity, and intercorrelation were computed. Table 1 shows the\nmean, standard deviation, and reliability coefficients for all\nthe measures.\nAs the values for Cronbach's alpha are well above the rec-\nommended threshold of .70, the reliability of the measure-\nments is considered valid (Fornell & Larcker, 1981).\nOuter Model/Measurement Model Validation\nThe relationship of observed variables with their respective\nlatent constructs comprises the outer model. Indicator reli-\nability, construct reliability, and construct validity (conver-\ngent and discriminant validity) are examined. Indicator\nreliability is established when the indicator (factor) loading\nis greater than .50 (Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson &Tatham,\n2006). Construct validity is established by composite reli-\nability (CR) values of the construct. CR is considered to be a\nsuperior alternative to Cronbach's alpha (Chin, 1998). CR\nmeasures the sum of a latent variable's factor loadings rela-\ntive to the sum of the factor loadings plus error variance.\nThis value ranges from 0 to 1. This value should be greater\nthan .60 for the validity of a construct. CR values above the\nthreshold of .70 indicate strong convergent validity (Kline,\nThe CRs of all variables range from .80 to .91 as pre-\nsented in Table 2. Moreover, both CR indicators and\nCronbach's alpha values of all the variables are above the\nthreshold value of .70. All outer loadings were significant\nand were greater than their cross loadings. Hence, measure-\nments have strong convergent validity (Hair,et al., 2006).\nMoreover, it is evident from Table 2 that all variance infla-\ntion factor (VIF) values are less than 5.

Correlation analysis was employed to examine\nthe relationship among participation in decision making,\ntrust, job satisfaction, group commitment, and affective\norganizational commitment. For assessing discriminant\nvalidity, square root of AVE of a variable should be greater\nthan its bivariate correlation with any other variable (Hulland,\nthe correlations in the row for the variables TRUST, PDM,\nJS, GC, and AOC, respectively.

This\nleads to higher job satisfaction. However, if there is no trust,\nan employee does not feel safe and he is likely to worry. This\nwill have negative effect and there can be no job satisfaction\nThis study offers a unique understanding of group com-\nmitment with other outcomes. Trust is an important driver of\ngroup commitment as evident in findings. This outcome\ngrows with the seed of trust (Moreland & Levine, 2002). It\nstrengthens the social interactions among employees.\nUncertainty among them is reduced. Difficulties and issues\nrelated to work are solved easily when there is cooperation\namong the employees. Hence, success at work is easily\nachieved by the employees. Organizations may choose to\nconsider group performance important for their growth.\nHence, employees give more importance to generate effec-\ntive group results. Hence, trust is considered by employees\nas essential to build emotional relationships among them-\nselves. Managers might trust only those members of a work\ngroup who consider the work important to be completed on\ntime.\nA significant relationship between trust and affective\ncommitment is also found. Trust helps to share information\nfreely. Thus, healthy relationship prevails among all employ-\nees (Lleo et al., 2017). They feel happy that their work and\nexperience is valued by their colleagues and managers.\nInteractions increase among employees. This creates a trust-\nworthy work environment. The employees develop positive\nfeelings for their organization by exhibiting affective com-\nThe results suggest that Indian PSUs are interested in\nenhancing employee job satisfaction through employees'\nparticipation in decision making, which has been supported\nin previous research (Ornoy, 2010). Affective commitment is\ndetermined by the extent of participation of employees in\nday-to-day work-related decisions allowed to them by their\nsupervisors. The more the participation, the better will be the\nrelationship between participation in decision making and\naffective commitment. Employees are able to identify more\nwith the organization when they have an active role in mak-\ning policies and decisions of their organization (Ojasalo &\nT\u00e4htinen, 2016). This is because participation gives certain\namount of satisfaction to the employees. This satisfaction\nobtained by participation cannot be replaced by any other\nform of involvement. Participation in the decision-making\nprocess also helps employees to understand the functioning\nof their organization thoroughly in terms of managerial and\ntechnical functions. Employees would also be able to under-\nstand the managerial and technical issues in a better\nmanner.\nAs per the results, participation in decision making did\nnot have significant impact on group commitment of employ-\nees, in contrast to the findings of Kukenberger et al. (2015).\nThis is because participation in decision making can cause\nmany disadvantages in a work group. There can be pressures\narising from social systems to dominance by some members\nof the group due to unequal distribution of power. An\nFigure 2.

TRUST = trust; PDM = participation in decision making; JS = job satisfaction; GC = group\ncommitment; AOC = affective organizational commitment.\nKumar and Saha 9\ninfluential member may cause other members to follow the\ndecisions taken by him, which may be disliked by other\nmembers as stated in leader\u00admember exchange theory.\nHence, indecisiveness, lack of consensus, and group con-\nflicts might arise. In such situations, the employee might feel\nneglected by his work group. Hence, he may not be able to\nidentify with his work group to the required extent. The com-\nmitment toward his group decreases gradually.\nAnother finding of note is that job satisfaction exerted\na strong influence on group commitment. This finding is\nsupported by past research on group commitment\n(Knippenberg & Schie, 2000). Thus, the positive associa-\ntion between job satisfaction and group commitment\nimplies that identification and attachment with the group\ncan be improved by providing supportive work groups and\nproviding recognition within the reference groups for\ngood work. Social ties are believed to achieve strong sat-\nisfaction level while working in groups. Thus, when the\nmembers of the work group of an individual provide sup-\nport and guidance in work, the satisfaction obtained by\ngood work will help in observing a significant amount of\ngroup commitment.\nThe results report that job satisfaction has a significant\nimpact on the magnitude of affective commitment. This\nresult is at par with past research (Appelbaum et al., 2013).\nEmployees seek a certain level of satisfaction in the job they\nperform. This is possible when they have a certain level of\ntrust in management. Hence, appreciation from managers\ngives satisfaction to the employees. Employees will have a\npositive emotional feeling about their job. Their expectations\nare met from the job as well as the organization (Rogers &\nAshforth, 2017). This would motivate the employees more\ntoward their organization. The positive emotional feeling\nwould give rise to commitment or attachment with the orga-\nnization. It creates positive work environment in the organi-\nzation. Such positive work environment enhances the\nrelationship between job satisfaction and organizational\ncommitment.\nAs far as group commitment in the PSUs is concerned, the\nstudy shows that it is a significant predictor of affective com-\nmitment (Appelbaum et al., 2013). It is also found to mediate\nthe impact of job satisfaction on affective commitment\nshown in the empirical testing supported by a past study\n(Paille, 2009). Group commitment is the cohesiveness of an\nindividual with the members of his or her group. It implies\nthat an employee who is attached to his work group would be\nequally attached to his or her organization. Job satisfaction\ncan have an indirect influence on affective commitment\nwhen group commitment facilitates this relationship\n(Srivastava, 2012). Thus, a part of this study highlights that\ngroup commitment is an equally independent variable as\naffective commitment. Thus, it is worthy to study how sig-\nnificant amount of group commitment can be achieved with\naffective organizational commitment.\nTable 5.

They are of the opinion that\norganizational leaders have to emphasize on these concepts\nto receive consistent attention (Meyer & Allen, 1997). The\nattitudinal outcomes such as group commitment, affective\ncommitment, and job satisfaction help establish the rela-\ntionship of an employee with his or her organization. In this\nway, the organization will consider its best interests not\nonly while making business decisions but also for the wel-\nfare of the employee.\nThe results of this study confirm a set of hypotheses\nabout the nature of relationship between trust and attitudi-\nnal outcomes. Trust can have a strategic role for coping\nwith uncertainties (Bromiley & Cummings, 1995). Greater\ntrust among each other implies greater satisfaction with the\njob. Trust among members eases group work. In this way, it\nenhances commitment with the work group as well as the\nwhole of organization. These outcomes are essential for an\nemployee to continue working with the organization. Trust\nhas an indirect influence on group commitment through job\nsatisfaction. In this light, it can be inferred that trust should\nbe viewed and prioritized as an important concept in\norganizations.\nThis study has been able to identify the role of employ-\nees' participation in decision making on attitudinal out-\ncomes. Participation in decision making was not\nexclusively related to job satisfaction, but it also signifi-\ncantly predicted affective organizational commitment.\nThis is supported by findings from previous researchers\nthat increasing participation has strong sense of identity\nand satisfaction with the job (Kim, 2002). Job satisfaction\nalso significantly predicted organizational commitment.\nThe findings of this study are relevant to the managers and\ndirectors of the PSUs in understanding how affective\norganizational commitment develops. Several organiza-\ntional factors arose to explain the relationship between\ntrust, participation in decision making, and behavioral\noutcomes of employees in organizations. As globalization\nand economy are growing, there exists tough competition\nfor the PSUs. The present study has implemented the rec-\nommendations of Black and Gregersen (1997) that sug-\ngest that organizations can enhance employees' job\nsatisfaction by improving participation. Participation\nallows the management of the organization to tap the\nskills and ideas of the employees for better efficiency in\nproduction.\nThree important strategies can be derived by the orga-\nnizations from the results of this study to enhance their\nemployees' job satisfaction. First, employees will extend\ntheir support and efforts more when PSUs develop strate-\ngies to support employees' career interests. Second, these\norganizations can communicate more with employees\nabout their responsibilities, participation, and perfor-\nmance on the job, thus enhancing their job satisfaction\nand commitment. In this manner, they will understand\nhow their present performance and strategies can contrib-\nute to the work. Third, the organizations should make sure\nthat while working in a group, the junior employees do not\nfeel less important. It is often observed that the senior\nemployees do not treat their junior colleagues equally in\nterms of recognizing their potential. The managers should\nensure that the junior employees are recognized equally\nwell as their senior employees for appreciable collective\nor group work.\nThis study has taken research on group commitment, a\nvery recent variable, to new levels. Predictors of affective\norganizational commitment illustrate that emotional attach-\nment of employees with their organization depends on trust,\nparticipation, and how good are their job satisfaction and\ncordial relations in a work group. These predictors are\naffected by the degree of group commitment. Organizations\nshould ensure that employees' skills are enhanced and they\nknow how to implement latest technological advances. This\nwill help the PSUs to have sound technical and support\ndomains. They will also stay at the cutting edge, and remain\ncompetitive in this manner.\nLimitations and Scope of Future Research\nFew limitations have to be addressed. Only cross-sectional\ndata have been considered in this study. Future studies can\nconsider implementing the model with longitudinal data.\nHowever, it is a challenging task to conduct a longitudinal\nstudy as the same respondents may not be available across\ndifferent points of time (Stratford, Mulligan, Downie, &\nThis study is specifically conducted for Indian PSUs.\nThus, the results of the study should be used carefully\nwhile applying to other companies such as multinational\ncompanies (MNCs). Then, a comparison between the\nresults of the model from two different sectors can be\ndone. It can be worthwhile in conducting a multilevel\nstudy by generating a conceptual model involving psycho-\nlogical variables such as trust and participative manage-\nment interventions, and attitudinal variables such as\ncommitment and job satisfaction. This would allow\nresearchers to understand the impact of participation\ninterventions and trust on various organizational and\nbehavioral outcomes. Future research can also be carried\nwith samples from different locations across different\nindustries. In addition, other sectors such as health care,\ninsurance, and services can implement the model so that\nthe findings can have larger implications.\nAppendix\nItems to Measure Participation in Decision Making.\nPDM 1 Can you discuss work problems with your superior?\nPDM 2 Do you have a significant say in decision making at\nwork?\nPDM 3 Can you participate in decisions affecting issues related\nto your work?\nPDM 4 Can you satisfactorily consult with your superior about\nyour work?\nPDM 5 Can you participate in decisions about what is and what\nis not a part of your work?\nPDM 6 Do you participate in decisions about the nature of your\nwork?\nPDM 7 Do you have a direct influence on your department's\ndecisions?\nPDM 8 Do you have an influence on the distribution of work\namong you and your colleagues?\nItems to Measure Trust.\nTRUST 1 I have a sharing relationship with my colleagues.
