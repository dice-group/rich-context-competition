The\ngonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)\nantagonist protocol has received much\nattention recently. This protocol has some\nadvantages, including less time and cost with\nlate follicular phase administration of a\nGnRH antagonist. Recent evidence has\nindicated that follicles developing in the\nluteal phase can ovulate in the presence of\na luteinizing hormone (LH) surge.\nTherefore, this situation has created more\nopportunities to use ovarian stimulation.4\nMany investigators have confirmed that\noocytes that are retrieved in the luteal phase\ncan be fertilized and developed into embryos\nin vitro.5\u00ad9 Kuang et al.10 observed that luteal\nphase ovarian stimulation can produce com-\npetent embryos in women aged 20\u00ad38 years\nwith infertility caused by tubal, male, or\nunexplained factors. Some researchers have\nshown that luteal phase ovarian stimulation\nis feasible for obtaining mature oocytes and\ngood embryos in women with PORs.9 This\nstudy aimed to examine the efficacy of luteal\nphase ovarian stimulation in women with\nPORs, by comparing IVF outcomes with\nGnRH antagonist protocols.\nPatients and methods\nStudy setting and patients\nThe data for this study were retrieved from\npatients' medical records from January 2013\nBologna criteria,11 the patients had at least\ntwo of the following characteristics:\n(1) advanced maternal age (!40 years old);\n(2) a previous POR ( 3 oocytes with a con-\nventional stimulation protocol); and (3) an\nabnormal ovarian reserve test (antral follicle\ncount of <5\u00ad7 follicles). Two episodes of\nPOR after maximal stimulation were suffi-\ncient to define a patient as a poor responder\nin the absence of advanced maternal age or\nabnormal ovarian reserve test.\nThe study was approved by the Ethical\nCommittee of Reproductive Medicine of\nLinyi People's Hospital (Shandong\nProvince, China). Written informed con-\nsents were obtained from all participants.\nProcedures\nenrolled from our computerized IVF data-\nunderwent the luteal phase ovarian stimula-\ntion protocol (LP). Between 0 and 24 hours\nafter spontaneous ovulation or oocyte\nretrieval, patients with at least one follicle\nof <8 mm remaining were administered\nHighly Purified Menotrophin (Ferring\nIM injection until the day of human chori-\nonic gonadotrophin (HCG) administration\n(Figure 1).\nDuring the same time interval, 166\npatients (224 cycles) underwent the GnRH\nantagonist protocol (AN). On day 2 of the\nmenstrual cycle, 225 IU of Highly Purified\nMenotrophin (Ferring GmbH Wittland 11)\ndaily was commenced. When the leading\nof GnRH antagonist (Cetrotide; Merck-\nSerono, Switzerland) was started daily\nuntil the day of HCG administration\n(Figure 2).\nTransvaginal ultrasound examination for\nall patients was performed to record the\ndiameter of developing follicles, and serum\noestradiol (E2) concentrations were mea-\nsured. The criterion for recombinant HCG\n(Profasi; Merck-Serono, Switzerland)\nadministration was that at least one follicle\ndiameter reached 16 mm or one dominant\nfollicle reached 18 mm. A total of 36 hours\nafter recombinant HCG injection, oocyte\naspiration was performed, which was guided\nby transvaginal ultrasound.\nFertilization was performed in vitro, by\nIVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection,\nrelying on semen parameters. The embryos\nwere examined and graded depending on the\nnumber and regularity of the blastomeres\nand embryonic fragmentation according\nto Cummins criteria.12 All of the highest\nquality embryos (including the 2\u00ad4 rated\nembryos) were transferred or frozen by\nvitrification on the second or third day\nafter oocyte retrieval.\nEndometrial preparation in frozen\nembryo transfer was performed in an artifi-\ncial cycle or a natural cycle as previously\nA b-HCG blood test was used to detect\npregnancy on day 14 after transplantation.\nIf pregnancy was achieved, progesterone\napplication was continued until 12 weeks\nof gestation.\nStatistical analysis\nThe clinical definition of pregnancy was\ndefined as a gestational sac being detected\nby ultrasonography. The implantation rate\nwas the total number of gestational sacs\ndemonstrated by ultrasonography divided\nby the total number of transferred embryos.\nThe miscarriage rate was defined as the\nFigure 2.

The data\nare shown as the mean\u00c6 SD and were\nanalysed by the one-way analysis of variance\nmethod. When the analyses showed signifi-\ncance, the groups were compared using the\nLSD test. The chi-square or Fisher's exact test\nwas used to analyse the clinical pregnancy\nrate, implantation rate, and miscarriage rate.\nP < 0.05 was considered statistically signifi-\ncant. Windows SPSS 18.0 software was used\nfor statistical analysis (SPSS, USA).\nResults\nAmong the 337 cycles, no patient experienced\na premature LH surge or moderate/severe\novarian hyperstimulation. The baseline char-\nacteristics of patients in the two groups are\nshown in Table 1. The mean age of female\nThe mean basal follicle-stimulating hormone\nwere cancelled because of no oocyte or\nembryo. Among the cancelled cycles, two\nand 11 cycles were cancelled because of no\noocytes in the LP and AN groups, respect-\nively. Among the cancelled cycles, 23 and 37\ncycles had no embryo in the LP and AN\ngroups, respectively. The two groups were\nsimilar in terms of age, body mass index,\nmean basal FSH levels, and cancelled cycles\n(Table 1).\nThe mean duration of hMG administra-\ntion was 9.9 \u00c6 2.3 days in the LP group and\nThe total dose of gonadotrophin stimulation\nwas higher in the LP group than in the AN\nday of hCG administration were lower in the\nLP group compared with the AN group.\nHowever, the mean number of oocytes was\nnumber of high quality embryos was\ngroups, respectively (Table 2). There were\nno significant differences in these variables\nbetween the two groups.\nA total of 159 embryos were first thawed\nin the LP protocol, and the survival rate was\ntransferred. A total of 215 embryos were\ntransferred in the AN protocol (Table 3).\nThe clinical pregnancy, implantation and\nmiscarriage rates were compared between\nTable 1.

A trend of a\nP \u00bc 0.647) was observed in the LP group,\nbut this was no significant because of the\nsmall number of patients.\nForty of the pregnant women had single\nembryos and eight women had twin\nembryos. Nine women had miscarriage in\nthe first trimester, and there were three\nectopic pregnancies. Among the pregnan-\ncies, 27 women had given birth, and 12 had\nongoing pregnancies at the end of the study.\nThere were 24 single births and three twin\nbirths, and no malformations were found in\nthe newborns (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nWomen whose ovarian reserves are too poor\nto retrieve sufficient mature oocytes have\nless hope of having their own children.\nThere have been many reports on manage-\nment of a POR to improve ovarian response\nand increase IVF outcomes, including the\nfollowing: increasing the gonadotrophin\ndose; decreasing the GnRH agonist dose,\naromatase inhibitors, and natural cycle; and\nusing a GnRH antagonist protocol.14\nSeveral studies have shown that luteal\nphase ovarian stimulation might be feasible.\nImmature oocytes retrieved in the luteal\nphase can be successfully matured in vitro.\nTable 3.

After maturing, mature\noocytes that have been recovered in the\nluteal phase are able to be fertilized and\nform good quality embryos in vitro.7,8 Xu\nand Li9 reported a patient who was diag-\nnosed with a POR. A mature oocyte\nobtained through luteal phase ovarian\nstimulation resulted in a cleavage embryo\n(8-cell, grade 2). Findings in their case\nshowed that luteal phase ovarian stimula-\ntion might be equally feasible in poor\nresponders. In our study, oocytes that\nwere retrieved during the luteal phase were\ncapable of maturing in vitro and being\nfertilized.\nTwo groups were compared in our study.\nThe baseline characteristics of the groups\nwere similar, including cancelled cycles,\nfemale age, basal FSH levels, and body\nmass index. However, the total number of\ndays of stimulation, total dose of gonado-\ntrophin administered, and E2 levels on the\nday of HCG administration were different\nbetween the groups. The total number of\ndays of HMG used was longer in the\nLP protocol compared with the AN protocol.\nE2 levels on the day of HCG administration\nwere significantly lower in the LP protocol\ncompared with the AN protocol. These dif-\nferences may be due to luteal phase stimula-\ntion with the LP protocol. There were no\nsignificant differences in the pregnancy and\nimplantation rates between the two groups.\nThe trend of a higher miscarriage rate in the\nLP group than that in the AN group might\nhave been related to the small sample size.\nFertility preservation for cancer patients\ninvolves freezing embryos and oocytes, and\nthe rate of pregnancy from vitrified oocytes\nembryos that are obtained and frozen in\nthe luteal phase would result in a compar-\nable pregnancy rate is unknown. A previous\nstudy showed that the clinical pregnancy,\nongoing pregnancy, and implantation rates\nHowever, the criteria were women aged\n20\u00ad38 years with a high ovarian reserve,\nand exclusion of PORs.10 The current study\ndemonstrated that the clinical pregnancy,\nongoing pregnancy, and implantation rates\nof frozen embryo transfer with the LP\nwith PORs. These results were better than\nthe microdose GnRH agonist flare-up\nprotocol, which was reported by Yarali\nshowed that the clinical pregnancy and\nrespectively, in the microdose GnRH agon-\nist flare-up protocol. The miscarriage rate\nwith the LP protocol in the current study\nwas 22.7%, which is consistent with previ-\nous reports (23%).18 The cancellation rate\n(24.3%) and total dosage of gonadotrophins\n(4221 IU) were higher in the current study\nstudy.19 Therefore, continuous stimulation\nduring the luteal phase could be used in\nwomen with PORs.\nAn ideal protocol for poor responders\nhas not been determined. The long protocols\nof GnRH agonist administration show\nbenefits in follicular synchronization.\nHowever, they have the disadvantage of\ninhibiting the ovarian response to gonado-\ntrophins, particularly in patients PORs.\nThe current study showed that luteal phase\novarian stimulation was feasible for women\nwith a POR, and ovarian stimulation may be\nused in special circumstances. However, this\nresult might have been caused by the small\nsample size. Further prospective, rando-\nmized trials are required to evaluate the\neffect of such protocols.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agencies in the public, commercial, or\nnot-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
