Plasma galectin-9 (Gal-9) was quantitated.\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured with TLR3 or TLR4 agonists, alone or\nin combination with Tim-3 antagonist.

IFN-a, 20-50OAS,\nMxA, TNF-a and SOCS1 were upregulated by TLR3 and TLR4 agonists.

Blockade of\nthe Tim-3/Gal-9 pathway might help to\nreinvigorate antiviral immunity and\nthereby improving the clinical efficacy of\ncurrent immunotherapies.\nBoth innate and adaptive immunity have\na profound impact on status of HCV infec-\ntion, and impairment of host immunity may\nlead to chronic infection.23,24 We have pre-\nviously shown that TLR3-expressing\nCD14\u00fe monocyte levels are correlated\nwith treatment response in patients with\nHCV infection.7 The aim of the present\nstudy was to evaluate the role of Tim-3/Gal-\n9 signaling in chronic HCV infection, and\nvirological response in patients with chronic\nHCV infection treated with IFN-based\ntherapies. In addition, we aimed to clarify\nwhether TLR3/TLR4 activation and Tim-3\ninhibition could induce production of anti-\nviral molecules in human peripheral blood\nmononuclear cells (PBMCs), which might be\nbeneficial for HCV clearance.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nPatients aged 18 to 65 years with chronic\nHCV infection were recruited from Third\nHospital of Hebei Medical University, the\nFifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang City and\nBethune International Peace Hospital\n(Shijiazhuang, China) between December\nmade using European Association for the\nStudy of the Liver (EASL) Clinical Practice\nGuidelines: Management of hepatitis\nC virus infection25 and the diagnostic cri-\nteria of The Guidelines for Prevention and\nTreatment of Hepatitis C issued by the\nChinese Society of Hepatology and\nChinese Society of Infectious Diseases and\nParasitology of Chinese Medical\nAssociation.26 Exclusion criteria were: pres-\nence of decompensated cirrhosis; coinfection\nwith HIV, hepatitis A, B or D virus; other\ncauses of chronic liver disease; or comorbid-\nities precluding interferon therapy. A group\nof age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers\nwho were attending regular health screening\nand were free from HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV\nand any other cause of chronic liver disease\nwere recruited as the control group.\nThe study protocol conformed to the\nHelsinki and was approved by the ethics\ncommittee of Third Hospital of Hebei\nMedical University, Shijiazhuang, China.\nAll study participants provided written\ninformed consent.

There were no\nsignificant differences between patient-\nderived and control-derived cells in levels\nof TNF-a.\nDiscussion\nThe initial aim of this study was to investi-\ngate the dynamic changes in plasma\nGal-9 levels in patients with chronic HCV\ninfection undergoing PegIFNa-2/RBV\ntreatment. Plasma Gal-9 levels were signifi-\ncantly elevated in patients with chronic\nHCV infection compared with healthy con-\ntrol subjects in the present study, suggesting\nthat persistent high Gal-9 levels might con-\ntribute to refractory chronic hepatitis C.\nAntiviral treatment significantly reduced\nplasma Gal-9 levels compared with baseline\nin our patient cohort, particularly in those\npatients who achieved cEVR or SVR. Gal-9\nmay play an important role in the immune\nresponse.28 This indicated that the antiviral\ntherapies could down-regulate the expres-\nsions of inhibitory molecule Gal-9 and\nrelated to the restoration of immune mod-\nulatory activity of Tim-3/Gal-9 pathway,\nwhich might improve outcomes of IFNa-\nbased therapy for HCV infection.\nOur previous study demonstrated that\nTLR3 expressing CD14 \u00fe monocytes were\npresent in significantly lower numbers in\npatients who achieved cEVR than those who\ndid not.4 TLR3 and TLR4 agonists have\nbeen shown to have significant efficacy\nagainst HCV,7 and both can induce antiviral\nstudy, TLR3 and TLR4 agonists increased\nthe levels of IFN-a, and 20-50OAS and MxA\nRNAs. The combination of TLR3/TLR4\nagonist and Tim-3 antagonist further\nstimulated expression of these antiviral pro-\nteins in the current study, with TLR3\nagonist \u00fe Tim-3 antagonist shown to have\nthe strongest inducer of anti-HCV mol-\necules. These findings suggest that activation\nof TLR3 alone or in combination with Tim-\n3 suppression may produce an effective\nantiviral response and represent a possible\napproach for immune therapy in patients\nwith chronic HCV infection.\nThe induction of the proinflammatory\ncytokine TNF-a was evaluated in the pre-\nsent study in order to determine the poten-\ntial side effects of the TLR agonists and\nTim-3 antagonist. TNF-a is a key proin-\nflammatory cytokine, high levels of which\nhave been shown to aggravate liver injury\nand result in a low response rate to IFN-a\nbased antiviral therapy in patients with\nHCV infection.29 Blocking of Tim-3 on the\nsurface of monocytes has been shown to\ninhibit TNF-a expression.30 Combination\ntreatment of PBMCs with TLR3/TLR4\nagonist and Tim-3 antagonist significantly\nreduced TNF-a levels compared with\nTLR3/TLR4 agonist alone in the present\nstudy. Interestingly, the addition of Tim-3\nantagonist to TLR3 agonist treated cells\ncompletely ameliorated the increase in TNF-\na levels seen with TLR3 agonist treatment\nalone. These findings suggest that comodu-\nlation of TLR3 and Tim-3 may provide a\ntreatment option for HCV infection, sup-\npressing inflammatory response while\nenhancing antiviral activity.\nThe negative immune-regulator SOCS1\nwas upregulated by treatment with TLR3 or\nTLR4 agonist in the present study. This may\nbe due to induction of type 1 IFN by TLR,\nactivating the JAK/STAT pathway and\ninducing SOCS1 expression.11 It has been\nreported that Tim-3 and SOCS1 communi-\ncate with each other and co-ordinately\ninhibit cell signalling transduction, resulting\nin impaired innate immune response.12,20\nCulture with a combination of TLR3 agon-\nist and Tim-3 antagonist did not induce\nSOCS1 expression in the present study,\nsuggesting that blockade of Tim-3 could\nsuppress SOCS1 expression induced by TLR\nThe present study had several limitations.\nIn order to gain insight into the underlying\nmechanism and therapeutic role of modula-\ntion of TLRs and the Tim-3/Gal-9 pathway,\nlarge-scale studies and further research are\nrequired. In addition, T cells should be\nisolated from PBMCs for in vitro experi-\nments, and the activation of effector T cell\nsubsets and expression of related cytokines\nshould be determined in patients with\nchronic HCV infection.\nIn conclusion, plasma Gal-9 levels were\nsignificantly upregulated in patients with\nchronic HCV infection, and were signifi-\ncantly reduced by antiviral treatment with\nIFN-based therapy. Low plasma Gal-9\nlevels before, during, and after antiviral\ntherapy were crucial to achieve early and\nsustained virological responses. Blockade of\nTim-3 in combination with TLR activation,\nespecially TLR3, induces the expression of\nantiviral molecules without a significant\nincrease in the proinflammatory TNF-a or\nthe negative immune-regulator SOCS1, indi-\ncating a possible therapeutic approach for\npatients with chronic HCV infection.\n"
