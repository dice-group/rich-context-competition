Indeed, the belief that accurate information will\nbolster democratic decision making and enable societal improvement is\ndeeply embedded in the enlightenment paradigm, pragmatist beliefs, delib-\nerative ideals, and other prominent conceptions of a strong, just, and pro-\nductive democracy. The benefits of engagement with credible evidence\nstem from improving knowledge and understanding of issues, enabling\nassessment of varied viewpoints and policies, identification of one's interests\nin relation to varied policies, and supporting formulation of more effective\ntion can undermine the public's ability to identify desirable policies, their\ndesire to engage in politics, and their sense of the very legitimacy of demo-\ncratic governance (see Delli Carpini & Keeter, 1996; Hochschild & Einstein,\n2015). In short, there is a strong case for Daniel Patrick Moynihan's oft-\nquoted statement that ``Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not\ntheir own facts.''\nUnfortunately, we often experience the kinds of political debates that\nfrustrated Moynihan--ones in which highly partisan individuals and groups\nhave their own facts. Studies show that Republicans and Democrats (or con-\nservatives and liberals, depending on the study) differ in their beliefs about\nthe fundamental facts that relate to many of the most important issues in\nrecent years, including the Iraq War (Kull, Ramsay, & Lewis, 2003), income\nMoreover, these differences in beliefs regarding factual knowledge are not\nmerely the product of innocent ignorance. Instead, the deliberate distribu-\ntion of misinformation by some politicians, political organizations, and inter-\nest groups is common (Hochschild & Einstein, 2015; Lewandowsky, Ecker,\nSeifert, Schwarz, & Cook, 2012). In addition, partisan polarization among\npolitical officials in the United States has expanded dramatically over the\npast several decades (McCarty, Poole, & Rosenthal, 2006). And among the\nelectorate, the affective ties associated with partisanship--the degree to\nwhich partisans dislike and impute negative traits to members of the other\nparty--also has increased. To cite one stark example, in 1960, roughly 5%\nof Republicans and Democrats said they would be ``displeased'' if their child\nmarried someone from the other party. By 2010, these numbers had grown\nto 49% of Republicans and 33% of Democrats (Iyengar, Sood, & Lelkes,\n2012). These trends along with changes in the media environment such as\nthe diminished role of gatekeepers and vastly expanded opportunities for\ncirculation of both information and misinformation in the Digital Age\nmake exposure to inaccurate information both more common and more dif-\n2016). As a result of these changes, the role of schools in promoting the\ncapacity and commitment to use and identify accurate information will be\never more important in the Digital Age.\nKahne and Bowyer\nJudging Political Claims: An Educational Priority\nThose pursuing the democratic purposes of schooling have long argued\nthat educators should prepare youth to be informed about controversial\nissues, able to critically assess evidence and factual claims related to such\nissues, and able to judge and construct well-reasoned arguments (e.g.,\nMerriam, 1934). As a means of pursuing these goals, civic education scholars\nhave, for example, highlighted ways that controversial issue discussions can\ndeepen understanding, promote political interest, and help students develop\nskills needed to craft well-warranted arguments (e.g., Campbell, 2008; Hess\nThese educational priorities are also reflected in current educational\nstandards and policies. Authors of the Common Core State Standards\n(CCSS), for example, write that evidence-based reasoning is ``essential to\nboth private deliberation and responsible citizenship in a democratic repub-\nlic'' (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council of\nChief State School Officers, 2010, p. 3). And the standards embedded in\nthe CCSS attend to these concerns. Ninth and 10th graders, for example,\nare expected to demonstrate the ability to ``identify false statements and fal-\nlacious reasoning'' (p. 40).\nStandard educational responses to these priorities often emphasize con-\ntent knowledge and generic analytic abilities. However, a growing body of\nresearch demonstrates the limited value of knowledge and analytic abilities\nwhen it comes to making evidence-based judgments in highly partisan con-\ntexts. In particular, in a polarized environment, judgments of truth claims are\noften shaped more by whether or not individuals' prior perspectives on the\nissue align with the claims than by how well informed the individuals are or\ntheir capacities to reason (Lavine, Johnston, & Steenbergen, 2012; Taber &\nUnfortunately, despite concern regarding these priorities, educational\nresearchers have rarely examined whether and how school practices can\ncounter these partisan biases. Since scholars from political science, psychol-\nogy, and communications have done significant conceptual and empirical\nwork on these issues (although they have not addressed the educational\nimplications of their findings), we begin by reviewing that work. We then\nexamine data from the Youth Participatory Politics (YPP) Survey, a large-\nscale nationally representative survey of youth ages 15 to 27, to examine\nthe ways that prior beliefs shape judgment of the accuracy of political con-\ntent and ways that actions by educators may influence these dynamics.\nSpecifically, the survey includes an experiment that was designed to simulate\nthe sorts of political content that circulate on social media. Participants were\nrandomly assigned to read a post regarding economic inequality and tax pol-\nicy that expressed either a conservative or a liberal perspective and that con-\ntained accurate or inaccurate information. They were then asked to rate the\nEducating for Democracy in a Partisan Age\npost's accuracy. We assessed the degree to which youths' judgments were\ninfluenced by the posts' alignment with their prior political perspectives\nand whether the post contained misinformation. As detailed in the following,\nwe found that youth tended to rate posts as ``accurate'' when the posts\naligned with their prior views on the issue (irrespective of whether the\npost contained factual inaccuracies). In addition, we tested whether two\npotential supports (political knowledge and media literacy instruction)\nmight help counteract these dynamics. In what follows, we discuss what\nwe found and the implications of those findings for furthering the demo-\ncratic aims of education.\nBiased Judgments of Evidence and Arguments Are Common When It Comes\nto Controversial Issues\nSocial science research indicates that when individuals encounter highly\npartisan issues, numerous perceptual biases influence their judgments of\ntruth claims. These biases also limit the degree to which individuals learn\nthrough exposure to information and from deliberation more generally.\nScholars often emphasize the distinction between two fundamental motiva-\ntions that affect the ways that individuals process information: directional\nfor a review, see Druckman, 2012). When individuals are guided by direc-\ntional motivation (the desire to justify conclusions that align with prior\nbeliefs), information that is consistent with one's prior preferences tends\nto be accepted uncritically and judged positively, whereas information that\nruns contrary to one's preconceptions is subjected to greater scrutiny and\njudged less positively (Ditto, Scepansky, Munro, Apanovitch, & Lockhart,\n1998). By contrast, when motivated by accuracy goals, ``[Individuals] expend\nmore cognitive effort on issue-related reasoning, attend to relevant informa-\ntion more carefully, and process it more deeply, often using more complex\nScholars find that directional motivation is especially common in the\nprocessing of political information. Prior research demonstrates that socio-\npolitical concepts are affect laden and that when they are invoked (even pre-\nconsciously), they trigger ``hot cognition,'' whereby these positive and\nnegative feelings come to mind automatically and bias subsequent informa-\ntion processing (Lodge & Taber, 2005). This process of directional motivated\nreasoning leads individuals (regardless of ideological leaning) to seek out\nevidence that aligns with their preexisting views (confirmation bias),\nwork to dismiss or find counterarguments for perspectives that contradict\ntheir beliefs (disconfirmation bias), and evaluate arguments that align\nwith their views as stronger and more accurate than opposing arguments\nthan learning from exposure to new information, individuals who encounter\nKahne and Bowyer\nnew information that contradicts their prior perspective often become even\nmore favorable to their prior beliefs (Redlawsk, 2002).\nThese dynamics related to directional motivation deserve careful atten-\ntion from educators. They constrain individuals' ability to learn, and in par-\nticular, they appear to limit learning from exposure to diverse viewpoints\nwhen it comes to politicized topics. Moreover, contrary to common assump-\ntions, the biases associated with directional motivation are greatest among\nthose with the most political knowledge. Taber and Lodge (2006) find that\nhighly knowledgeable individuals--who possess the capacity to counterar-\ngue information and arguments that are contrary to their own views--tend\nto show a greater bias in favor of arguments consistent with their prior\nbeliefs and take a longer time processing arguments that contradict their\nbeliefs than they do arguments that align with their prior beliefs because\nthe contradictory arguments are subjected to greater critical scrutiny.\nAt the same time, as Druckman (2012) notes, the dominance of direc-\ntional motivation is not inevitable. A variety of contexts and interventions\nappear to foster accuracy motivation and diminish directional motivation.\nSuch interventions and contexts include requiring individuals to justify their\nopinions, encouraging them to consider varied perspectives, and prompting\nreflection on one's reasoning process. As we discuss in the following, these\nfindings highlight priorities and norms that educators value and may have\nways to promote.\nChanges in the Media and Information Environment\nAs a result of changes in the news media environment, particularly the\ngrowing importance of cable TV and the Internet, it is now far easier for indi-\nviduals to choose the source and partisan slant of the information and per-\nspectives to which they are exposed (Prior, 2013). These changes have\ncoincided with a dramatic increase in partisan polarization among both pol-\niticians and the electorate (Barber & McCarty, 2013). These dual dynamics\nmake it far easier and more likely for individuals to act on confirmation\nbiases and enter echo chambers (Sunstein, 2007) or be subjected to filter\nbubbles (Pariser, 2011) through which search engines guide exposure\ntoward views and information that align with views and interests one already\nholds. And this process can create a reinforcing cycle. Studies show that\nexposure to views that align with one's own fosters attitudinal polarization\n(Stroud, 2011). In sum, these changes in the media environment appear\nlikely to increase individuals' abilities to act in response to directional moti-\nvation and by fostering more extreme partisan leanings, increase the degree\nto which individuals' judgments are driven by directional motivation.\nAdding to these dynamics, a tremendous amount of political content\nnow flows through social networking sites and other online platforms with-\nout being subject to vetting or credibility checks (Metzger, 2007). For\nEducating for Democracy in a Partisan Age\nthat young people were roughly as likely to receive news on civic and polit-\nical issues from Twitter and Facebook posts by family and friends as they\nwere from newspapers and magazines read both online and offline\n(Cohen, Kahne, Bowyer, Middaugh, & Rogowski, 2012). In addition, the\nnumber of youth using social media to spread content is increasing dramat-\nically. Pew Survey data indicate that the number of youth who posted polit-\nUsers are confronted with numerous challenges when assessing the\ncredibility of the information accessed through these online sources of\nnews, particularly given the widespread presence of political misinforma-\ntion. Youth audiences evaluating a website's credibility may rely on criteria\nsuch as the site's surface characteristics (Sundar, 2008) or whether the site\nwas the first result provided by a search engine (Hargittai, Fullerton,\nMenchen-Trevino, & Thomas, 2010). These heuristics for assessing the cred-\nibility of information sources are not adequate when evaluating political\ninformation. The combination of highly partisan sources, homophilous\nonline networks, lessened influence of gatekeepers vetting the accuracy of\ntruth claims, and the speed with which information can spread through dig-\nital media means that a great deal of political misinformation circulates\nonline (Lewandowsky et al., 2012). Indeed, the prevalence of ideologically\nhomophilous online networks can encourage the viral spread of politically\nmotivated misinformation ``among like-minded audiences who can now\nselectively attend to information based on their ideological beliefs and per-\nspectives'' (Rojecki & Meraz, 2016, p. 38). Moreover, as Lewandowsky et al.\n(2012) explain, both analytic and intuitive processing lead individuals to\naccept content that is consistent with their prior beliefs because it ``feels\nright.'' This can encourage both the acceptance of misinformation as true\nand the further spread of falsehoods through social media. Garrett (2011)\nfinds that the effects of exposure to false rumors that circulated online during\nthe 2008 presidential campaign were conditional on the political biases of\nthose exposed to the rumors. Exposure to emails containing rumors about\nBarack Obama did not seem to affect the beliefs or behavior of supporters\nof the candidate; however, among nonsupporters, increased exposure was\nassociated with a greater likelihood both of believing the false rumors about\nObama and of forwarding the emails to others.\nIn addition, misinformation is particularly challenging because it is diffi-\ncult to correct in the presence of directional motivated reasoning. Unlike the\nuninformed who are more likely to learn from exposure to new information,\nthe misinformed are confident that they are correct, resist factually correct\ninformation, and use their misinformation to form their policy preferences\n(Kuklinski, Quirk, Jerit, Schwieder, & Rich, 2000). Furthermore, a ``backfire\neffect'' can occur where presenting the misinformed with correct information\nKahne and Bowyer\nnot only often fails to reduce their misperceptions but actually intensifies\ntheir commitment to their inaccurate ``knowledge'' (Nyhan & Reifler, 2010).\nDirectional motivated reasoning is not always problematic at the level of\nthe individual. Individuals might be rational not to abandon prior perspec-\ntives to which they have given considerable prior thought and to be skepti-\ncal of new information that contradicts what they have already learned about\nan issue (Lodge & Taber, 2013). However, in the presence of misinformation,\ndirectional motivated reasoning has unambiguously negative implications\nfor democratic deliberation. When individuals accept misinformation used\nto support policy arguments or even worse, when they choose to trumpet\nthat misinformation to justify their position on an issue, they may well\nlead others who are not aware that the information is inaccurate to adopt\na position they would not otherwise hold. In addition, these actions may\nlead those who hold opposing views and who are aware that the claims\nbeing made are inaccurate to believe that those they disagree with are igno-\nrant--perhaps willfully--and to doubt the likelihood of reasoned dialogue\nin a democracy.\nResearch Questions\nAlthough educators value and work to promote attention to the accu-\nracy of information and the quality of arguments, educational researchers\nhave rarely conducted systematic studies of the degree to which youths' par-\ntisan beliefs bias their judgments of arguments and of truth claims regarding\ncontroversial issues. As a result, we lack information regarding the degree to\nwhich particular educational experiences or educational outcomes influence\nthe impact of partisan biases on judgments regarding politically charged\narguments or truth claims. Educational researchers are, however, well posi-\ntioned to undertake studies that address such concerns. Indeed, we see sig-\nnificant value in this research agenda. Such studies could provide much\nneeded guidance to civic educators committed to supporting the oft-\nneglected democratic purposes of schools.\nThe study detailed in the following responds to this need. In particular,\nwe conduct an experiment designed to test how directional motivation and\naccuracy motivation affect young people's judgments of the sorts of truth\nclaims made about political issues that circulate through social media.\nNext, we examine how two factors that educators could promote (students'\npolitical knowledge and exposure to medial literacy learning opportunities)\nmight affect the degree to which directional and accuracy motivation shape\nstudents' judgments of accuracy. Specifically, the experiment was designed\nto address the following research questions about the relative influence of\ndirectional and accuracy motivation:\nResearch Question 1: How does directional motivation influence assessments of\ntruth claims?\nEducating for Democracy in a Partisan Age\nResearch Question 2: How does accuracy motivation influence assessments of\ntruth claims?\nResearch Question 3: How are assessments of truth claims influenced by factors\nthat schools can promote, such as students' political knowledge and exposure\nto media literacy learning opportunities?\nResearch Question 3a: Do these factors influence the degree to which directional\nmotivation shapes assessments of truth claims?\nResearch Question 3b: Do these factors affect the degree to which accuracy moti-\nvation affects assessments of truth claims?\nMethods\nOur examination of these questions draws on data from the Youth\nParticipatory Politics Survey, a nationally representative survey of young\npeople between the ages of 15 and 27 in the United States. Specifically,\nwe embedded an experiment within this survey, which was administered\nby the GfK Group (formerly Knowledge Networks), a private company\nthat maintains an online panel that is representative of the United States pop-\nulation. The sample for the YPP survey was drawn from two sources: GfK's\nKnowledgePanel (KP)--a nationally representative, probability-based\nInternet panel1--and a supplemental Address-Based Sample (ABS) recruited\nspecifically for this survey. The YPP survey included oversamples of African\nAmerican, Asian American, and Latino youth, and the sampling frames were\nstratified by age and race. The KP was used to draw a direct sample of per-\nsons aged 18 to 27 as well as to draw a sample of parents with offspring\nbetween the ages of 15 and 27. From the latter group, the parent was asked\nto identify the race and ethnicity of each person aged 15 to 27 in the house-\nhold, and if any individuals belonged to the target population and the parent\nconsented to their participation, one eligible household member was asked\nto take the survey.2\nThe ABS used the US Postal Service Delivery Sequence File as the sam-\nple frame. Selected households were sent a letter that described the study\nand invited one eligible household member to complete the survey online.\nThe letter offered a monetary incentive for participation and provided a web-\nsite address and unique password to complete the survey online. Initial non-\nresponders were sent a reminder postcard after about one week, and after\nabout another two weeks, attempts were made to contact nonresponding\nhouseholds by telephone.\nWe analyze the responses of those participants who took the\nEnglish language survey online (N = 2,101).3 Descriptive statistics, including\ndemographic and educational variables, for this sample are reported in\nTable 1.4 The median respondent completed the online survey in 30\nminutes.\nKahne and Bowyer\nExperimental Design\nIn the midst of a survey about their online activity and political partici-\npation, respondents were exposed to the experimental treatment. This treat-\nment was designed by the authors to incorporate relevant features of content\nthat circulates online through social media, a major source of political infor-\nWe piloted the treatment to ensure that students were answering the ques-\ntions in a manner consistent with the purpose of the items.5\nSurvey participants were randomly assigned to see one of six ``posts''--a\npicture (either a graph or a political cartoon) accompanied by a short com-\nment--on the topics of economic inequality and tax policy. Figure 1 displays\neach of the posts as well as the number of participants assigned to each\ngroup, which ranged from 204 in Group C to 269 in Group B.6 These topics\nwere prominent and polarizing issues in political discussions at the time, fol-\nAs shown in Figure 1, these posts were manipulated to vary along two\ndimensions: political ideology7 and the type of argument employed. By vary-\ning these two aspects of the posts simultaneously, we are able to gauge the\nrelative influences of directional motivation and accuracy motivation on\nCharacteristics of Online Survey Participants\nCharactersitics %\nGender\nRace/ethnicity\nLatino (any race) 24\nOther/multiple races 4\nAge\neducational status and attainment\nIn middle school or high school 32\nIn college or vocational school 33\nNot enrolled--no high school diploma 4\nNot enrolled--high school diploma 10\nNot enrolled--some college 11\nNot enrolled--BA degree or higher 10\nEducating for Democracy in a Partisan Age\nparticipants' reactions. The comments were designed to be equivalent in\nstyle (two short, declarative sentences) while presenting opposite positions.\nEach comment was accompanied by a visual (graph or cartoon) that might\nbe deployed by a supporter of that policy position. Participants assigned\nto Groups A, B, and C read a comment that presented a liberal position\non the tax rates of wealthy individuals (the second sentence of the comment\nread, ``Their taxes should go up!''). Those assigned to Groups D, E, and F\nwere exposed to a conservative argument (the sentence read, ``Tax rates\nshouldn't go up!'').\nIn addition to their ideological position, the posts also varied in the type\nof argument that they employed. Groups A and D saw a post that was\ndesigned to present a subjective, emotive appeal without any empirical evi-\ndence. Those participants in the liberal condition (A) read, ``The rich can\nafford to pay higher taxes,'' while those in the conservative condition (D)\nread, ``Successful Americans are already paying enough in taxes.'' Both state-\nments are inherently subjective and are phrased in such a way that support-\ners of the policy stance would be likely to accept the assertion while\nopponents would not. The statements were paired with a cartoon that was\nconsistent with the opinion expressed in the post. Specifically, Group A\nviewed a cartoon of Mr. Monopoly dancing on the grave of the ``American\nmiddle class,'' and Group D saw a man being shaken upside down by the\nIRS. Neither cartoon presents evidence on behalf of the policy position;\ninstead, both present emotive appeals on behalf of the purported victims\nof economic inequality (Condition A) or tax policy (Condition D). Both\nFigure 1. ``Posts'' seen by experimental groups by ideology and type of argument.\nKahne and Bowyer\ncartoons are characteristic of the kinds of cartoons used on the Internet to\nillustrate a perspective.\nGroups B and E read the same two sentences as did Groups A and D,\nrespectively, but the post that they viewed contained a graph rather than\na cartoon. These two groups were presented with graphs containing accu-\nrate data that were constructed to be as equivalent as possible while present-\ning facts that were commonly cited by liberals (in Condition B) or by\nconservatives (in Condition E). ``The Distribution of Wealth in the US'' graph\nseen by Group B was based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current\nPopulation Survey, and ``The Distribution of Income Taxes Paid in the US''\nseen by Group E was based on data from the Internal Revenue Service:\nBoth were attributed to ``US Government Statistics'' in the graph to be con-\nsistent across conditions without being inaccurate. The two particular statis-\ntics were chosen because their distributions are remarkably similar: 10% of\nthe U.S. population possess about 70% of the total wealth, and 10% pay\nabout 70% of federal income taxes. All other details of the two graphs\n(e.g., color schemes and fonts) are identical. The main difference between\nthese posts and those seen by Groups A and D is that while the latter pro-\nvided strictly emotive arguments, the arguments viewed by Groups B and\nE were supported by evidence.\nThe final pair of experimental conditions was designed to test whether\nthe presence of misinformation affects young people's judgments of the\naccuracy of truth claims. Participants in Groups C and F viewed the same\ncartoons as did Groups A and D, respectively. However, instead of the sub-\njective statements read by Groups A and D, the first sentences of the posts\nread by Groups C and F presented as fact a claim that was objectively false.\nGroup C read that ``90% of the rich don't pay any taxes at all,'' and Group F\nread that ``1% of Americans pay 90% of all taxes.'' Not only are these state-\nments inaccurate, they are wildly so, erring by orders of magnitude, not\nmere percentage points.8 Thus, the purpose of these two conditions is not\nto test young people's knowledge of the details of the tax distribution but\nrather to see whether their judgments are influenced by inclusion of a sub-\nstantial falsehood.9 Overall, then, the six experimental conditions provide\na liberal and conservative version of three types of arguments: an\nevidence-based argument, an emotive opinion statement, and an opinion\nbacked by misinformation.\nDependent and Independent Variables\nJudgment of Accuracy\nRespondents' judgments of the accuracy of the post they saw is our\ndependent variable. Immediately after viewing the post, participants were\nasked to rate the accuracy of the comment. Specifically, respondents placed\nthemselves on a 4-point scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree\nEducating for Democracy in a Partisan Age\nregarding the statement, ``I think this comment is accurate.'' In summarizing\npsychological studies of motivated reasoning in a variety of contexts, Ditto et\nal. (1998) conclude that research consistently demonstrates that ``information\none wants to believe is perceived as more valid or accurate than information\none prefers not to believe'' (p. 54).\nAlignment With Political Beliefs\nTo operationalize whether a post aligned with a participant's prior\nbeliefs, we considered the ideology of the post in conjunction with partici-\npants' responses to a question about the appropriate role for the government\nin reducing income inequality. This question, administered in the survey\nprior to the experiment, asked participants to place themselves along a scale\naccording to their beliefs about what the ``government in Washington''\nshould do to address income differences, ranging from 1 (the government\nought to reduce the income differences between rich and poor) to 7 (the gov-\nernment should not concern itself with reducing this income difference\nbetween the rich and the poor).10 Those participants who placed themselves\non liberal end of the scale (points 1\u00ad3, N = 1,001) were coded as ``ideolog-\nically aligned'' if they were assigned to Groups A, B, or C and as ``ideologi-\ncally unaligned'' if they were assigned to Groups D, E, or F. Participants who\nplaced themselves at the conservative end of the attitude scale (points 5\u00ad7,\nN = 545) were coded as ``ideologically unaligned'' if they were assigned to\nGroups A, B, or C and as ``ideologically aligned'' if they were assigned to\nGroups D, E, or F. Respondents who placed themselves at the midpoint of\nthe scale (4, N = 524) were excluded from the analyses as the hypotheses\nregarding the effects of ideological alignment do not apply to individuals\nwho are ambivalent on the issue.\nNature of Argument\nAs described previously and shown in Figure 1, the experimental condi-\ntions also varied the nature of the argument employed in the post. We clas-\nsify respondents according to which experimental group they were\nassigned. Namely, participants assigned to Groups A or D were exposed\nto an emotive argument, those assigned to Groups B or E saw an\nevidence-based argument, and those in Groups C or F read an argument\nwith misinformation. In the multivariate analyses, these groupings are oper-\nationalized as dummy variables, with the misinformative argument serving\nas the baseline condition.\nPolitical Knowledge\nWe measure political knowledge by summing the number of correct\nresponses a participant gave on a battery of three questions about the\nKahne and Bowyer\nAmerican political system. These three items are a subset of the battery of\nitems shown by Delli Carpini and Keeter (1996) to be a reliable and valid\nmeasure of general political knowledge and sophistication.11 This measure\nhas also been shown to be strongly related to awareness of current events\nThus, our measure of political knowledge serves as a proxy for being polit-\nically informed in general, not just a measure of knowledge of specific polit-\nical facts.\nMedia Literacy Learning Opportunities\nGiven the increasing difficulty of judging political claims--especially\nonline--many are advocating increasing provision of civic media literacy\neducation (Hobbs, 2010). Our focus in this study is on media literacy learn-\ning opportunities that aim to promote accurate judgment of truth claims.\nExposure to media literacy learning opportunities that aim to promote\nsuch accurate judgment is measured by a scale created by summing\nresponses to two questions asking respondents to recall their experiences\nin school. Respondents were asked how often they had ``Discussed how\nto tell if the information you find online is trustworthy'' and ``Discussed\nthe importance of evaluating the evidence that backs up people's opinions''\nin their classes.12 These experiences tap into two primary ways by which an\naccuracy motivation might be instilled through media literacy education: by\ncultivating skills for judging accuracy and developing commitment to a norm\nof accuracy.\nHypotheses\nThe first phase of our study addresses our first two research questions\nregarding the relative effects of directional motivation and accuracy motiva-\ntion on individuals' judgments of accuracy. We examine these relationships\nby comparing accuracy ratings across the different experimental conditions.\nSpecifically, in order to assess the influence of directional motivation, we\ncompare the responses of participants who saw an ideologically aligned\npost to those of participants who were presented an ideologically unaligned\npost, controlling for the type and quality of argument employed in the post.\nThis approach of varying the partisan or ideological direction of an argument\nwhile holding the quality of argument constant is consistent with other stud-\nies of motivated reasoning (Taber & Lodge, 2006). Since the posts in each\npair of experimental conditions (A and D, B and E, C and F) are equivalent\nin their accuracy, the difference in ratings between the ideologically aligned\nand unaligned conditions reflects the effects of directional motivation. If par-\nticipants are guided by directional motivation, then we hypothesize\n(Hypothesis 1) that those participants assigned to an ideologically aligned\npost will be more likely to judge the post as accurate than those who\nEducating for Democracy in a Partisan Age\nwere assigned to a post that did not align with their predispositions (holding\nconstant the kind of argument being made).\nTo assess the impact of accuracy motivation, we analyze the responses\nof participants who were assigned to an ideologically aligned condition\nonly. By restricting this analysis to ideologically aligned conditions, we\nhold constant the influence of directional motivation. While the effect of\ndirectional motivation should be the same in all three ideologically aligned\nconditions, the effect of accuracy motivation should vary by the type of argu-\nment employed in the post. In particular, it is in the experimental conditions\ninvolving an ideologically aligned post that contains misinformation that\ndirectional motivation and accuracy motivation are manipulated to be at\nodds with one another. For liberals, this occurs if they were assigned to\nGroup C, and for conservatives, it occurs if they assigned to Group F. In\nthese conditions, individuals who possess the will and capacity to act on\naccuracy motivation would be expected to identify their assigned post's\ncomment as being inaccurate in spite of their partisan motivation to agree\nwith its policy stance. By contrast, the posts seen by Groups A, B, D, and\nE are subjective enough that someone who agreed with its point of view\nmight be able to make a reasonable case for why it is accurate.13\nConsequently, we would expect (Hypothesis 2) that participants exposed\nto an ideologically aligned post will be less likely to rate the post as accurate\nif they were assigned to a misinformative post than if they were assigned to\nan evidence-based or emotive post.\nAfter testing the main effects of the experimental manipulations, we turn\nour attention to the questions of how the educational characteristics and\nexperiences of individual participants may influence these dynamics. We\nexamine whether the relative effects of directional motivation and accuracy\nmotivation on judgments of accuracy vary according to two characteristics of\nthe participants: political knowledge and exposure to media literacy educa-\ntion. Prior research (e.g., Taber & Lodge, 2006) leads us to expect that the\neffects of directional motivation will be greatest for those individuals who\npossess the most political knowledge. Consequently, we expect that\n(Hypothesis 3) there will be an interaction effect between political knowl-\nedge and being exposed to an ideologically aligned post. Specifically, we\nexpect that the difference in the accuracy ratings of participants who are\nassigned to an ideologically aligned post and those assigned to an unaligned\npost will be greater for participants with high levels of political knowledge\nthan it is for participants with less political knowledge. In particular, since\nthose individuals with more political knowledge ``possess greater ammuni-\ntion with which to counterargue incongruent facts, figures, and arguments''\n(Taber & Lodge, 2006, p. 757), we expect that participants with high levels of\npolitical knowledge will be less likely to rate ideologically unaligned posts as\naccurate than participants with less knowledge.\nKahne and Bowyer\nSimilarly, media literacy learning opportunities may help students better\nunderstand the meaning of political communications. To the extent that this\nis true, individuals who received instruction in media literacy will be more\nlikely to identify whether a political message to which they are exposed is\nconsistent with their prior beliefs. Thus, we expect that (Hypothesis 4) there\nwill be an interaction effect between media literacy learning opportunities\nand whether the post is ideologically aligned.\nThere are reasons to expect that the relative effect of accuracy motiva-\ntion on judgments of the posts' accuracy will be conditional on both an indi-\nvidual's political knowledge and media literacy learning opportunities.\nConventional wisdom would lead one to expect that those with more polit-\nical knowledge would tend to have greater capacity to recognize if a post\ncontained factual inaccuracies and to be able to make a judgment based\non accuracy motivation. Thus, we hypothesize (Hypothesis 5) that there\nwill be an interaction effect between political knowledge and the presence\nof misinformation in a post. We expect that highly knowledgeable individu-\nals will be less likely to judge posts that contain misinformation as accurate\nthan they are the other posts. Moreover, we expect that highly knowledge-\nable individuals will be less likely to judge posts that contain misinformation\nas accurate than are individuals with less knowledge.\nThe central rationale for media literacy instruction is that it should\nincrease individuals' attentiveness to the accuracy of information (a norm\nof valuing accuracy) as well as the skills to assess accuracy. Thus, we\nhypothesize (Hypothesis 6) that there will be an interaction effect between\nmedia literacy learning opportunities and the presence of misinformation in\na post. We expect that those youth who report having received the most\nmedia literacy learning opportunities will be less likely to judge posts contain-\ning misinformation as accurate relative to the posts without misinformation. In\naddition, we expect that those individuals with more media literacy education\nwill be less likely to judge posts containing misinformation as accurate than\nare youth who did not receive any such learning opportunities.\nStatistical Methods\nTo investigate the first research question regarding how directional moti-\nvation influences judgments of accuracy, we compare the average responses\nof participants exposed to an ideologically aligned post with those who were\nassigned to an unaligned post, holding constant the type and quality of argu-\nment. To address the second research question about the influence of accu-\nracy motivation, we restrict our attention to those participants assigned to an\nideologically aligned condition and compare the average responses across\nthe three different argument types. For both of these analyses, responses\nto the question about whether the post is accurate are collapsed into\na dummy variable (coded 0 for strongly disagree or disagree and 1 for agree\nEducating for Democracy in a Partisan Age\nor strongly agree). We employ t tests to evaluate whether there are statisti-\ncally significant differences in the means of this dummy variable across\nthe experimental groups.14\nTo investigate the third research question regarding whether the effects\nof directional motivation and accuracy motivation on judgments of accuracy\nare conditional on political knowledge and media literacy learning, we esti-\nmate a series of multivariate models that include interactions between the\nexperimental conditions and, respectively, political knowledge and media\nliteracy learning opportunities. In these analyses, we use the full range of\nthe four-category dependent variable, and since this is an ordinal variable,\nwe employ ordered logit regression.\nSpecifically, Models I through III evaluate the hypotheses about the\neffects of directional motivation on accuracy ratings. Models I and II are esti-\nmated as preliminary steps prior to the tests of the conditional hypotheses.\nModel I includes a dummy variable to capture the effects of the ideological\nalignment of the post as well as controls for the type of argument employed\nin the post and demographic variables.15 Model II adds political knowledge\nand media literacy learning opportunities. Model III provides our tests of\nHypotheses 3 and 4 by adding interaction terms between political knowl-\nedge and media literacy learning opportunities, respectively, and the ideo-\nlogical alignment of the post.\nA similar logic is applied in Models IV through VI, which test the hypoth-\neses regarding accuracy motivation, though these models are estimated for\nonly those participants assigned to a pro-attitudinal condition. Model IV\nincludes the dummy variables for the type of argument used in the post\nand control variables only, and Model V adds political knowledge and media\nliteracy learning opportunities. Model VI includes the interaction terms\nbetween political knowledge and media literacy learning opportunities,\nrespectively, and the type of argument dummy variables, in order to test\nResults\nDirectional Motivation and Judgments of Truth Claims\nTo investigate the first research question regarding how directional moti-\nvation influences judgments of accuracy, we compare the responses of par-\nticipants exposed to an ideologically aligned post with those who were\nassigned to an unaligned post, holding constant the type and quality of argu-\nment. Figure 2 displays the proportion of participants who agreed that the\npost's comment was accurate by the type of argument used in the post\nand whether the post was ideologically aligned with the participants' prior\nattitudes. Comparing the average accuracy ratings of aligned posts and\nunaligned posts for each argument type, we find strong support for\nKahne and Bowyer\nHypothesis 1. On average, 67% of participants exposed to a post that aligned\nwith their prior political views characterized the post as accurate compared\nto 39% of those who saw a post that did not align with their prior political\nperspective. Across all three types of arguments, there is a large and statisti-\ncally significant difference (p \\ .001 for a two-tail t test) between those\nassigned to an ideologically aligned condition and those assigned to an\nunaligned condition: For all three argument types, a majority of participants\nassigned to an ideologically aligned post agreed that the statement was accu-\nrate while a majority of participants assigned to an unaligned post dis-\nagreed.16 Thus, consistent with prior research, directional motivation\nappears to have a substantial effect on judgments of accuracy.\nAccuracy Motivation and Judgments of Truth Claims\nComparing across the three different argument types in the ideologically\naligned condition, we also find evidence of the influence of accuracy moti-\nvation as articulated in Hypothesis 2. Participants who saw an ideologically\naligned post were less likely to rate the post as accurate if it contained mis-\ninformation. Fifty-eight percent of those who saw an ideologically aligned\npost that contained misinformation (Groups C and F) agreed that the post\nFigure 2. Ratings of post's accuracy by ideological alignment and type of argument.\nNote. Ninety-five percent confidence interval bars around the proportions for each group.\nEducating for Democracy in a Partisan Age\nwas accurate compared to 74% who saw an aligned emotive post (Groups A\nand D) and 69% of those who saw an aligned, evidence-based post (Groups\nB and E). Both of these differences between the misinformative posts and\nthe two other conditions are statistically significant (p \\ .001 for a two-tail\nt test of the difference between the evidence-based and misinformation con-\nditions; p = .03 for a two-tail test of the difference between the emotive-\nbased and misinformation conditions).17\nEffects of Political Knowledge and Media Literacy Learning Opportunities on\nJudgments of Truth Claims\nHaving demonstrated that directional motivation and accuracy motivation\nappear to influence participants' judgments of accuracy, on average, we turn\nto the third research question, which asks whether these effects of directional\nmotivation and accuracy motivation are conditional on factors that schools\ncan promote: political knowledge and exposure to media literacy educa-\ntion. The ordered logit regression models reported in Table 2 estimate\nthe effects of ideological alignment on accuracy ratings, with Model III pro-\nviding the tests of whether directional motivation is conditional on political\nknowledge and media literacy learning. The results of Model III are sup-\nportive of Hypothesis 3's prediction that directional motivation will have\na greater influence on those participants with the most political knowledge.\nThose with more knowledge are more likely than others to judge posts that\nalign with their prior beliefs as accurate (regardless of the posts' actual accu-\nracy). The main effect of political knowledge is negative and statistically sig-\nnificant, indicating that in the ideologically unaligned conditions, greater\npolitical knowledge is associated with a lower likelihood of agreeing that\nthe comment is accurate. In addition, the interaction between being assigned\nto an ideologically aligned post and political knowledge is positive and statis-\ntically significant, consistent with the hypothesis that the effects of directional\nmotivation are greatest among those with the most political knowledge.\nThese conditional effects are illustrated in Figure 3, which plots the pre-\ndicted probability of agreeing that the comment is accurate by the partici-\npants' level of political knowledge. This predicted probability is calculated\nseparately for those participants assigned to an ideologically aligned condi-\ntion and those assigned to an unaligned condition, with all other variables\nincluded in Model III held constant. Political knowledge clearly has a large\neffect in the unaligned conditions. For an otherwise typical participant\nassigned to view an unaligned post, the predicted probability of agreeing\nthat the comment is accurate declines from .47 for someone at the low\nend of the political knowledge spectrum to .27 at the high end. In the ideo-\nlogically aligned condition, however, the difference in probabilities across\nthe range of political knowledge is small (.60 at the low end to .68 and\nthe high end) and not statistically significant. Put differently, among those\nKahne and Bowyer\nOrdered Logit Models of Effects of Ideological Alignment on Judgments of Accuracy\nModel I Model II Model III\nAligned Post 3 Political Knowledge 1.18***\nNote. Entries are ordered logit coefficients; standard errors in parentheses.\nEducating for Democracy in a Partisan Age\nwith low levels of political knowledge, we see a modest difference between\nthe ideologically aligned and unaligned conditions (.60 and .47, respec-\ntively). By contrast, among those with high levels of knowledge, we see\na large gap between the aligned and unaligned conditions (.68 to .27).\nBy contrast, the findings for Model III do not support Hypothesis 4.\nNeither the estimated effect of media literacy nor the interaction effect\nbetween ideological alignment and media literacy are statistically significant.\nThis indicates that the effects of motivated reasoning are not conditional on\nthe amount of media literacy education that an individual received.18\nTable 3 presents the results of the set of models that investigate whether\nthe influence of accuracy motivation on judgments of accuracy are condi-\ntional on individuals' political knowledge and media literacy education.\nContrary to Hypothesis 5, individuals with high levels of political knowledge\ndo not appear to be influenced more by accuracy motivation than do other\nparticipants. Even though those with more knowledge might be expected to\nhave greater capacity to recognize misinformation, having greater knowl-\nedge does not increase the likelihood of rating posts with misinformation\nas inaccurate relative to the two other ideologically aligned posts. That is,\nFigure 3. Accuracy ratings by ideological alignment and political knowledge.\nNote. Predicted probabilities and 95% confidence intervals estimated from Model III.\nKahne and Bowyer\nwhile Model III indicates that the effect of directional motivation on judg-\nments of accuracy is conditional on political knowledge, Model VI suggests\nthat political knowledge does not affect the relative influence of accuracy\nmotivation.\nBy contrast, there is support for Hypothesis 6's prediction that accuracy\nmotivation will have a greater influence on those individuals who reported\nhaving had the most media literacy learning opportunities. Specifically,\nthere is a positive, statistically significant interaction effect between student\nreports of media literacy learning and viewing an evidence-based post (rel-\native to seeing a post with misinformation). For those participants who\nreported receiving no media literacy training, there is no statistically signif-\nicant difference across the three types of arguments employed in the posts.\nThe presence of misinformation in a post does not appear to affect their\njudgments of the post's accuracy. However, among those participants\nwho reported the most media literacy learning experiences, there is a large,\nstatistically significant difference in ratings of accuracy between those\nexposed to a post that employed misinformation and those who saw an\nevidence-based post.19\nFigure 4 illustrates the substantive significance of this interaction by plot-\nting the predicted probability of agreeing that the post is accurate while varying\nreports of media literacy training and the presence of misinformation, holding\nconstant political knowledge and all the control variables. Participants who\nreported little media literacy education do not seem to make distinctions\nbetween the posts based on the type of argument employed. If anything,\nthey are more likely to rate the (objectively false) post with misinformation\nas accurate (.60) than the evidence-based post (.48), though this difference is\nnot statistically significant. Conversely, those individuals who reported having\nthe most media literacy learning experiences appear to make a clear distinction\nbetween the evidence-based posts and the posts with misinformation. For oth-\nerwise typical participants who reported having the maximum amount of media\nlearning opportunities, the predicted probability of saying that the post is accu-\nrate declines from .78 if they were assigned to an evidence-based post to .52 if\nthey saw a post with misinformation.\nDiscussion\nThe democratic process suffers when individuals are inattentive to or\nunable to judge the factual accuracy of political content (Delli Carpini &\nKeeter, 1996). Acceptance and circulation of misinformation undermines\nreasoned decision making and informed action while delegitimizing the\npromise of deliberation. Moreover, increasing partisanship and dynamics\nassociated with political engagement in the Digital Age (e.g., the diminished\nvetting of truth claims by gatekeepers and the prevalence of homophilous\nEducating for Democracy in a Partisan Age\nOrdered Logit Models of Effects of Type of Argument on Judgments of\nAccuracy--Respondents in Ideologically Aligned Conditions Only\nModel IV Model V Model VI\nEmotive-Based Post 3 Political Knowledge 0.61\nEmotive-Based Post 3 Media Literacy 0.58\nEvidence-Based Post 3 Media Literacy 1.69**\nNote. Entries are ordered logit coefficients; standard errors in parentheses.\nKahne and Bowyer\nonline networks) have increased both exposure to misinformation and the\nneed to prepare youth to assess the accuracy of truth claims.\nThis study contributes to our understanding of how young people judge\nthe factual accuracy of partisan claims tied to controversial societal issues\nand demonstrates clear reason for concern. To summarize, we found evi-\ndence that youth are guided by both directional motivation and accuracy\nmotivation when making such judgments. But we also found that the impact\nof alignment with one's prior beliefs was greater than the impact of whether\na given statement is accurate. In addition, the study's findings provide guid-\nance regarding strategies that civic educators and others seeking to prepare\nyouth for engagement in a democratic society can use to respond to these\ndynamics. In particular, we found that the influence of directional motivation\nwas greatest for those with the most political knowledge and that counter to\nour expectations, those with high levels of political knowledge were no\nmore likely than others to correctly identify inaccurate truth claims. The find-\nings with respect to media literacy were exactly the reverse. Youth who\nreported having media literacy learning opportunities were no more likely\nFigure 4. Accuracy ratings by argument type and media literacy learning\nopportunities.\nNote. Predicted probabilities and 95% confidence intervals estimated from Model VI.\nEducating for Democracy in a Partisan Age\nthan others to be influenced by directional motivation but were significantly\nmore likely to be influenced by accuracy motivation. In the following, we\ndiscuss the implications of these findings for those committed to promoting\nthe democratic aims of education.\nEducators Must Respond to the Problems Resulting From\nDirectional Motivation\nConsistent with prior research on directional motivation (Kunda, 1990;\nLodge & Taber, 2013) and as noted previously, we find strong evidence of\ndirectional biases when young people are asked to evaluate the accuracy\nof a political claim. Even when presented with a grossly inaccurate state-\nment, a clear majority of youth (58%) in the nationally representative YPP\nsurvey agreed that the statement was accurate when those claims were\nused to support perspectives that aligned with their ideological perspective.\nIn a media environment in which political misinformation circulates widely\nand rapidly and in which individuals can easily seek out news and perspec-\ntives from sources that champion their beliefs, this psychological tendency\nof individuals to accept claims that align with their beliefs as true, even\nwhen the claims are not accurate, will undermine the quality and ultimate\nproductivity of democratic deliberation. Thus, it is important for educators\nto identify ways to counteract the impact of directional motivation on judg-\nments of partisan content.\nPolitical Knowledge Is an Insufficient Support for Accurate Judgment\nContrary to conventional wisdom, this study also indicates that political\nknowledge is an insufficient support for accurate judgments of partisan\nclaims. Motivation is also of central importance. In particular, we find that\npolitical knowledge appears to magnify the impact of directional motivation.\nThose youth who possess high levels of political knowledge are significantly\nmore likely than less knowledgeable youth to judge content as inaccurate\nwhen that content does not align with their prior beliefs. As described by\nTaber and Lodge (2006), individuals with greater political knowledge may\nhave an increased capacity to counterargue messages that contradict their\npartisan leanings. Those with more political knowledge may also have\ngreater ability to recognize the political implications of varied posts and\nthus be better able to align their judgments of those posts with their prior\nbeliefs (Bowyer, Kahne, & Middaugh, in press).\nOn their own, the dynamics associated with knowledge are not neces-\nsarily problematic. Knowledge may enable youth to better align their beliefs\nwith their judgments. However, from the standpoint of preparing students\nfor political deliberation, political knowledge is insufficient. It does not\nlead youth to effectively attend to the factual accuracy of claims--only to\na claim's alignment with their beliefs. Highly knowledgeable participants\nKahne and Bowyer\nare just as likely as their less knowledgeable peers to accept an ideologically\naligned post as accurate even when a post contains substantial falsehood.\nThus, although it is common for those discussing the democratic aims of\neducation to assume that promoting students' political knowledge will\nhelp youth make reasoned and accurate judgments related to pressing policy\nissues, such knowledge does not appear to enhance the likelihood that indi-\nviduals will identify misinformation in charged political contexts.\nMedia Literacy Education Is an Essential Support for Judgment in a Highly\nPartisan Digital Age\nIn contrast to these findings regarding political knowledge, we were\nheartened that media literacy learning experiences that aim to promote accu-\nrate judgment of truth claims appear to be helpful. Individuals who reported\nhigh levels of media literacy learning opportunities were considerably more\nlikely to rate evidence-based posts as accurate than to rate posts containing\nmisinformation as accurate--even when both posts aligned with their prior\npolicy perspectives. Those who reported no exposure to media literacy edu-\ncation, in contrast, were not more likely to rate posts with evidence-based\narguments as more accurate than posts that contained misinformation. We\nbelieve this finding is important. It indicates that media literacy learning\nopportunities that aim to promote accurate judgments of truth claims may\nwell advance a form of what Lavine et al. (2012) label critical loyalty.\nThose with critical loyalty still hold strong values and beliefs, but they adopt\na critical stance when evaluating an argument--even when that argument\naligns with their partisan preferences.\nFuture Educational Research Must Conceptualize and Test Specific\nEducational Responses to Motivated Reasoning so as to Enhance the Quality\nof Political Judgment\nWhile these findings provide a clear indication of the potential potency\nof media literacy learning opportunities, much more work remains to be\ndone. Clearly, one limitation of our data is that we rely on self-reports of\nreceiving media literacy learning opportunities, and we lack details on the\nmedia literacy learning opportunities that students received. Studies of par-\nticular interventions (especially if structured as field experiments) would\nenable direct measurement of what students received and would avoid the\npotential biases associated with student reports of receiving media literacy.\nSuch an approach would also help to clarify the programmatic components\nof media literacy education that have the greatest impact on students' will\nand capacity to make accurate judgments. In addition, since both political\nknowledge and media literacy learning opportunities were not randomly\nassigned in our survey experiment, we cannot rule out the possibility that\nother, unobserved factors might explain the differences across participants\nEducating for Democracy in a Partisan Age\nin their judgments of accuracy.20 Again, structured experiments tied to par-\nticular interventions would be especially helpful in establishing the causal\nimpact of varied educational experiences.\nMore broadly, these findings highlight the potential payoff of educa-\ntional responses to problematic dynamics related to motivated reasoning.\nAlthough people may use argument in self-serving ways that they are\nin limited command of, it doesn't follow that they cannot achieve\ngreater conscious command and come to draw on it in a way that\nwill enhance their cognitive power. (p. 83)\nWhen assessing exposure to media literacy, we asked youth if educators had\ndiscussed how important it was to evaluate evidence that backs up opinions\n(emphasizing the norm of accuracy motivation) and if they had provided\nskills (or capacities) that would help them judge the accuracy of information\nthey find online (emphasizing the need for skills). It would be wise to test\nadditional ways to promote the norm of accuracy motivation as well as\nthe skills or capacities to act productively in response to this motivation.\nIndeed, media literacy, while a fruitful strategy to pursue, is but one way\nthat educators prepare students to care about and be able to assess truth\nclaims in policy arguments. Frequently, for example, teachers engage stu-\ndents in debates of controversial issues and have students write research\npapers that examine controversial issues. In addition, scholars have studied\nways that differing classroom discussion practices and discussion goals (i.e.,\nprioritizing convincing others vs. prioritizing reaching consensus) can foster\ndesired forms of argumentation (Felton, Garcia-Mila, Villarroel, & Gilabert,\none study, Kuhn and Crowell (2011) found that curricula engaging students\nin dialogues on social issues can increase the quality of argumentative rea-\nsoning, as exhibited in writing on topics that were not part of the curricular\nintervention (see also Hess & McAvoy, 2015). Fortunately, this priority aligns\nwith broad school reform agendas. The ability to assess the quality of truth\nclaims and arguments figures prominently in the Common Core State\nStandards (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices &\nCouncil of Chief State School Officers, 2010) and the National Assessment\nof Educational Progress (NAEP) Civics Test (National Center for Education\nIn short, the general concern for preparing youth to judge the accuracy\nof truth claims, like the broader concern for the democratic purposes of\nschooling, should not be confined to a single priority such as media literacy.\nRather, we believe these findings highlight dynamics worthy of study in mul-\ntiple domains. Indeed, educators still have much to learn about whether and\nwhen varied curricular experiences are shaped by and may influence the\nKahne and Bowyer\nprevalence and impact of accuracy and directional motivation in real-world\npolitical contexts. Moreover, our study focused on identification of one kind\nof misinformation. If educators are to prepare youth to judge the quality of\na policy argument, many qualities of political argument are worthy of atten-\ntion (e.g., how partisan leanings influence assessments of whether an argu-\nment employs coherent reasoning).\nThe relationships between directional and accuracy motivation on the\none hand and a range of curricular practices and capacities for judgment\non the other deserve careful study. Such work can clarify the impact of var-\nied approaches and deepen our conceptual understanding of ways to pro-\nmote high-quality judgment of politically charged issues. These skills are\nessential given the dramatic expansion of choice when it comes to news\nmedia, the diminishing role of gatekeepers, and the widespread circulation\nof misinformation. Without the capacity for and the commitment to the accu-\nrate assessment of truth claims regarding controversial political issues, the\nlinks between rigorous thought and evidence on the one hand and demo-\ncratic deliberation and informed policymaking on the other are severely\ncompromised. The emphasis educators place on knowledge and analytic\nreasoning in non\u00adpolitically charged contexts is not misplaced, but this focus\nis insufficient if we are to fully prepare youth for democratic participation in\nan increasingly partisan age.\nNotes\n1Participants are recruited to the Knowledge Panel through an address-based sam-\npling method (prior to 2009, the panel was recruited through random digit dialing).\nAmong other procedures to ensure the representativeness of the Internet panel, GfK pro-\nvides a laptop and free Internet access to households without home access to a computer\nconnected to the Internet. For a detailed description of the probability-based methods\nused by GfK to construct and maintain a representative Internet panel, see http://\nwww.knowledgenetworks.com/ganp/reviewer-info.html.\n2The Youth Participatory Politics (YPP) Survey also included a small sample (N = 17)\nthat was drawn by contacting KP members who were African American and at least 55\nyears old. These panelists were asked if they had any grandchildren who were in the tar-\nget group (African American and 15\u00ad17 years old), and if so, one eligible grandchild was\nselected to complete the survey.\n3A small number of sampled households that did not respond to the invitations to\ntake the online survey were administered the instrument by telephone. Because the sur-\nvey experiment was only administered to those respondents who took the survey online,\nthese phone respondents (N = 129) are excluded from our analyses, as are participants\nwho took the Spanish language version of the survey (N = 123).\n4Due to the differential probability of selection, the survey data must be weighted in\norder to be representative of the national population. However, since the primary concern\nof this article is with the comparisons across experimental groups, most of the analyses\nhere are not weighted. In those instances where statistics are used to draw inferences\nabout the national population, the appropriate survey weights are applied. Full details\nof the YPP survey and the sampling procedures are available on the authors' website\n(http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/projects/youth-participatory-politics-survey-project).\n5Items in the survey experiment, with its follow-up questions, as well as the questions\non media literacy learning experiences were piloted with 12 youth from two high schools\nEducating for Democracy in a Partisan Age\nand one college in the Bay Area. The group was diverse in terms of age, political perspec-\ntive, race, and academic performance. We asked the students to think aloud as they\nanswered these questions and to give examples of media literacy learning opportunities\nthey had in school to confirm that they were answering the question in a manner consis-\ntent with the purpose of the items.\n6A further 200 participants were assigned to a control group that was not exposed to\nany of the posts. Consequently, this group is not included in any of the analyses.\n7We use the term ideology rather narrowly throughout this article to refer to positions\non the government's role in economic redistribution.\n8Contra the assertion seen by Group C that 90% of the rich do not pay any taxes, IRS\ndata indicate that of the 1,097,879 households that reported an adjustable gross income of\nGroup F that 90% of taxes are paid by 1% of Americans is similarly contradicted by data\nfrom the Congressional Budget Office (2014): Taxpayers in the top 1% of the pre-tax\nincome distribution paid 24% of all federal income taxes in 2011. Moreover, since sales\ntaxes and social security and state and local income taxes are generally less progressive\nthan federal income taxes, the overall percentage of taxes paid by the top 1% are likely\neven lower, although the percentages vary by state.\n9Unfortunately, we made a problematic oversight in this section of the survey. At the\nend of the experiment, we did not explain to survey respondents that we had given them\nmisinformation. Thus, we may have led some survey respondents to believe factually inac-\ncurate content related to economic inequality. We thank an anonymous reviewer for alert-\ning us to this risk and regret that we did not debrief the participants in our study regarding\nthe accuracy of the content to which they were exposed. We will do this in the future. We\nalso strongly encourage researchers conducting similar studies to anticipate the need to\ncorrect any misinformation that participants receive.\n10This question is drawn from the General Social Survey, which has used this measure\nof attitudes about economic inequality since the late 1970s.\n11The three items included in the YPP survey asked respondents to identify which\nparty held the majority in the House of Representatives, which institution is responsible\nfor judicial review, and which party is considered more conservative. The prior wave\n(2011) of the YPP survey included the same three items plus two additional items asking\nabout the majority required for Congress to overturn a presidential veto and which office\nJoe Biden held. Among the 2011 respondents, the full five-item scale of political knowl-\nedge is strongly correlated (r = .92) with the three-item scale used in the 2013 survey.\nThus, we are confident that the three-item scale used here is a reliable measure of political\nknowledge.\n12The wording of these questions varied according to whether the respondent\nattended a school or college during the 2012\u00ad2013 academic year. Participants who\nwere enrolled in high school or college were asked about their classes in that school\nyear. Those who were not enrolled were asked to ``[think] back to the last school you\nattended.''\n13For participants assigned to an ideologically unaligned post, accuracy motivation\nand directional motivation never come into conflict since none of the comments is objec-\ntively accurate.\n14Randomization checks confirm that there were no statistically significant differences\nacross the groups in questions relating to economic policy or other political attitudes\nadministered in the survey prior to the exposure to the experimental treatment.\n15In particular, we control for participants' gender, age, race, ethnicity, country of\nbirth, education (whether they possess a college degree), region of residence, and metro-\npolitan status. We include these as controls because we assume that they are causally prior\nto both political knowledge and media literacy learning opportunities.\n16This same pattern of results holds when we analyze those in the liberal conditions\n(A\u00adC) separately from those in the conservative conditions (D\u00adF). Liberal participants\nassigned to a liberal condition are more likely to rate the post as accurate than are liberals\nassigned to a conservative condition, whereas conservatives are more likely to rate the\npost as accurate if they were assigned to a conservative condition.\nKahne and Bowyer\n17The difference in means between the evidence- and emotive-based posts, for which\nwe have no theoretical expectations, is not statistically significant (p = .22 for a two-tail t\ntest).\n18To further test whether the effects of motivated reasoning are conditional on media\nliteracy learning, we also tested a model specification that included a three-way interac-\ntion between ideological alignment, media literacy learning, and political knowledge.\nThis interaction was not statistically significant.\n19Because our measure of media literacy learning relies on respondents' self-reports\nand since a large portion of our sample was no longer in high school at the time of the\nsurvey, there could be concern that these results were driven by the responses of partic-\nipants who had been out of school for several years. In order to rule out this possibility,\nwe repeated this analysis using only the data for those respondents who were still enrolled\nin middle school or high school and found the substantive conclusions for Model VI\nremained the same. In particular, the interaction effect between media literacy learning\nand the evidence-based condition (relative to the misinformation condition) was positive\nand statistically significant.\n20For example, it is possible that those with more knowledge are more interested in\nthe topic and that they might feel more strongly about the issue and thus be subject to\na greater degree of directional motivation. To test this particular alternative explanation,\nwe employed a survey question that asked participants' how important the issues income\ninequality and taxes were to them. Adding this variable, as well as its interaction with the\nexperimental conditions, did not substantively change the results of Models III and VI\nregarding the effects of political knowledge and media literacy learning opportunities.\nThese results are available from authors upon request.\nReferences\nBarber, M., & McCarty, N.
