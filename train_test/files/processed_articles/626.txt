Susan Marquis\nGrowth in health care costs and in-\nsurance premiums slowed substan-\nthat the growth of health maintenance organi-\nzations (HMOs), which have captured an\nincreasing share of the employment-based in-\nsurance market, played a large part in attenu-\nating the previous trend.2\nAlthough the existing literature suggests\nthat HMO penetration can influence spend-\ning and therefore may be able to influence pre-\nmiums, no studies have examined the overall\neffect of HMO penetration on total premi-\nums.3 This paper takes on that task, focusing\non employer-sponsored health coverage,\nwhich covers 74 percent of the population un-\nder age sixty-five. We use data from two sur-\nveys of employers to examine the relationship\nbetween HMO market share and premiums\nThese data encompass two periods that saw a\nwide range of HMO penetration rates.

Within the\ngeographic units described above, the frame\nwas stratified by the number ofworkers at the\nestablishment. Both surveys were conducted\nby telephone. The interview was conducted\nwith the person(s) in each establishment\nmost knowledgeable about the employer's\nhealth benefit plans and workers' charac-\nteristics. The response rate to the 1993 survey\nBecause we use the data to measure aver-\nage health insurance premiums and HMO\npenetration in a market area, we restricted\nour analysis sample for 1993 to employers in\none of the metropolitan statistical areas\n(MSAs) in the ten states covered. For 1997 we\nlimited our sample to employers in one of the\nfifty-one MSAs that are part of the Commu-\nnity Tracking Study; the other nine Commu-\nnity Tracking sites are rural areas. To measure\npremiums in the market area, we included\nonly employer-sponsored plans for which a\npremium was reported by a respondent. We\ndistinguish between two kinds of employer-\nsponsored plans: HMOs and non-HMOs.7 We\nlimited our sample to the MSAs for which we\nhad reported single premium data for a mini-\nmum of twenty-five non-HMO plans. Our re-\nsultant sample for 1993 covers fifty MSAs and\nand have data from 6,083 employers and their\nOur two study samples include ten MSAs\nin common. We also conducted all of our\nanalyses for each year on this subset of the\nareas to investigate whether any differences in\nfindings between years is attributable to the\ndifferent mix of markets that we studied. We\nobserve the same relationship between HMO\npenetration and premiums for these ten MSAs\nthat we see for all of the study markets. There-\nfore, we do not separately report the results\nfor the ten areas.\nn Measures. Our goal is to examine\nwhether premiums for employer-sponsored\ninsurance plans vary between MSAs with dif-\nferent rates of HMO penetration. Health in-\nsurance premiums (which include the\namounts paid by both the employer and em-\nployee) were self-reported by respondents for\neach plan offered, separately for single and for\nfamily coverage. We classify plans as an HMO\nor a non-HMO based on the respondent's self-\nassessment of plan type, aided by complete\ndefinitions of plan types as needed (HMO,\npreferred provider organization, or traditional\nindemnity in both surveys and point-of-serv-\nice plan in the 1997 survey). We report all\nwere adjusted to 1997 dollars using the medi-\ncal component of the Consumer Price Index.\nIn addition to comparing premium levels\nacross market areas, we also compare the\nvestigate whether growth in premiums varies\ndepending on HMO penetration. The change\nmeasure is based on an establishment-level\nquestion included in the 1997 survey about\nchange in total health insurance cost per en-\nrollee compared with one year ago.\nThe two surveys also obtained information\nabout the scope of benefits of each health in-\nsurance plan, including the deductible, coin-\nsurance rate, amount of out-of-pocket maxi-\nmum, benefits included (prenatal, maternity,\nmental health, substance abuse, prescription\ndrugs, and dental in 1993; vision, mental\nhealth, prescription drugs, and dental in\n1997), whether the plan is medically under-\nwritten, and the waiting period for coverage\nof preexisting conditions. We adjust premi-\nums for differences among plans in these char-\nacteristics as described below.\nThe HMO penetration rate in each MSA\nwas measured from the survey data as the per-\ncentage of employees in the MSA enrolled in\ntheir employer's health benefit plan who were\nenrolled in an HMO.

The measure that we use is the\naverage payment rate for Aged Part A and\nAged Part B. The MSA area measure is com-\nputed as the population-weighted average of\nthe measure for each county in the MSA.\nn Methods. We compare average premi-\nums for employer-sponsored plans in MSAs\nwith varying degrees of HMO penetration. To\ncontrol for differences among MSAs in the\ncharacteristics of employers or the health in-\nsurance benefits they offer, we estimate and\npresent premiums that are adjusted for these\ndifferences.\nWe use multivariate regression analysis to\nexamine the relationships between area HMO\nmarket share and premiums. We estimate\nseparate models for single premiums and for\nfamily premiums. We also perform separate\nregressions for each of the two study years.\nThe range of HMO penetration rates observed\nin the data changed substantially between\ndata, differences in premiums attributable to\ndifferences in HMO penetration rates would\nbe highly confounded with any effects of time\non premiums. Therefore, we chose to fit sepa-\nrate models for the two years.11\nThe key independent variable in our mod-\nels is HMO market share in the MSA. For\neach year we divided MSAs into four groups\ndefined by approximate quartiles of the pene-\ntration distribution. We include indicator\nvariables for the groups. Since HMO market\nshares rose substantially between 1993 and\n1997, separate categorizations are used for\nket share. We created categorical measures\nfor HMO shares to avoid imposing a func-\ntional form on the relationship between in-\ncreasing penetration rates and premiums.\nDifferences among MSAs in other charac-\nteristics might confound our analysis if these\ndifferences correlate with HMO penetration.\nTherefore, we control for plan benefits, char-\nacteristics of the establishment, and charac-\nteristics of the market. Plan benefits, enumer-\nated above, are included in the model to\ncontrol for differences in the composition of\nhealth plans across areas and changes induced\nby market competition. In addition, we in-\nclude an indicator for whether the plan is a\nself-insured or purchased plan.\nEstablishment characteristics in the regres-\nsion include the size of the firm, percentage of\nworkers who are in a union, number of years in\nbusiness, industry, and amount of turnover in\nthe workforce in a year. We also control for\nrisk differences in the employee population\nusing the sex and age mix of the employee\npopulation and an indicator of whether the\nemployer was ever denied insurance.\nFactors that affect premium levels also may\ninfluence HMOs' decisions to establish in an\narea. Failure to account for this could lead to\nbiased estimates. We minimize this problem\nby including area characteristics that are\nlikely to be correlated with both premium lev-\nels and HMO penetration. These include in-\ncome per capita as a measure of area demand\nfor services and AAPCC as a measure of\nhealth care prices.12\nThe regression models are fitted to data in\nwhich the insurance plan is the unit of obser-\nvation. However, the data are weighted so\nthat each MSA receives equal weight. That is,\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : M A R K E T W A T C H\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ S e p t e m b e r / O c t o b e r 2 0 0 0\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

We treat the MSA as the unit of\nanalysis so that each metropolitan area con-\ntributes equally to our estimate of the effect of\nHMO penetration, rather than giving higher\nweight to areas with greater population.\nWithin the MSA, establishments are\nweighted by sampling probabilities to repre-\nsent the mix of establishments in the MSA. If\nan employer offers multiple plans, plans are\nweighted by their enrollment shares.\nWe use the regression to predict the ad-\njusted mean premium paid by employers for\nplans of a given type in MSAs in each of the\nfour penetration groups for each study year.\nThese predicted values adjust the premiums\nto the mean value of the plan, establishment,\nand area characteristics in our data. Differ-\nences between markets with different HMO\nmarket shares are tested using two-tailed t-\ntests of statistical significance.\nWe first perform this analysis including\npremiums from all health plans, to assess the\noverall effect of HMOs on premiums. We then\nredo the analysis once using only data from\nHMO plans and a second time using only data\nfrom non-HMO plans. This enables us to ex-\namine whether the effects we observe on all\npremiums are the result of changes in HMO or\nnon-HMO premiums.\nResults\nThere was substantial growth in the share of\nemployees in their employer-group plans who\n1993 the average rate of HMO enrollment in\nthe fifty markets we studied was 21 percent,\nwhereas the rate was 37 percent in the forty-\nthree markets included in our 1997 data.

Overall, premiums for\nemployer-sponsored plans are lower in areas\nwith high HMO enrollment. This can be seen\nin Exhibit 1, which reports average adjusted\npremiums, as well as in Exhibits 2 and 3,\nwhich plot average adjusted single and family\npremiums across all plans by the mean HMO\npenetration rate for the four groups in both\nsurvey years. In markets with HMO shares\nabove 25 percent, total premiums for single\nand family coverage were significantly lower\nthan in other markets in both years.

HMO premiums also could\nbe lower in areas with higher HMO market\nshares if, for example, growth in HMO market\nshare fosters competition among HMOs.\nWhen we examine the relationship between\nHMO market share and HMO premiums, we\nfind some significant differences, but there is\nnot a consistent relationship between HMO\nmarket share and HMO premiums.\nn Competitive influence. In addition, our\nresults support the hypothesis that there is a\ncompetitive influence of HMO penetration on\nnon-HMO premiums.

In 1993 single and family premiums\nfor non-HMO coverage were significantly\nlower in markets with HMO enrollment\npremiums for single coverage were signifi-\ncantly lower in MSAs with HMO penetration\nbetween 25 and 45 percent than in areas with\nlow penetration; non-HMO premiums for\nfamily coverage were significantly lower in all\nareas with HMO shares above 25 percent\nthan in the low-penetration markets.

If\nthis were true, then the reductions in HMO\npremiums would be accompanied by in-\ncreases in premiums for non-HMO plans; the\nnet effect on overall spending would be small.\nOur results suggest that this is not gener-\nally the case. In fact, we find that non-HMO\npremiums tend to fall with rising HMO mar-\nket share, precisely the opposite of what one\nwould observe if HMOs simply selected\nhealthy patients and shifted costs to other in-\nsurers. We had some indications of adverse\nselection in non-HMO plans in areas where\nHMOs have captured close to half the market.\nNon-HMO premiums were higher in areas\nwith market shares higher than 45 percent in\nshare, although this was not statistically sig-\nnificant. The largest difference in the premi-\nums between HMOs and non-HMOs also\ntends to be in areas with the highest HMO\nenrollment. We note, though, that while pre-\nmiums paid for those staying in non-HMO\nplans may be higher in these areas, overall av-\nerage premiums still fell as HMO market\nshare increased.\nIn addition, the growth in premiums in re-\ncent years appears to be lower in areas with\nhigh HMO penetration. This suggests that in\naddition to a one-time lowering of prices, the\ncost differences between areas may reflect a\nmore lasting phenomenon as well. However,\nwe need to observe changes in premiums over\na longer time period before drawing conclu-\nsions about long-run effects.\nn Caveats and future research needs.\nAlthough our results on health costs are en-\ncouraging, they are limited to two cross-\nsections covering a short time period, and\nthey suggest several other issues for research.\nOur data do not provide evidence of how the\nsavings are obtained--for example, through\nefficiencies in the delivery system, through\nprovider discounts, or through slowing the\nadoption of new technologies. We cannot\nmeasure the exact distribution of these effects\nbetween HMOs and non-HMOs. The growth\nof HMOs may have spurred the growth of\nother types of managed care plans, which may\nbe a factor in the lower premiums in high\nHMO areas. We have not examined how the\ndistribution of types of non-HMO plans var-\nies across markets with different HMO pene-\ntration levels, or how a different mix of types\nof non-HMO plans affects premiums within\nmarkets with the same degree of HMO pene-\ntration. We also cannot address the implica-\ntions for quality of care delivered in markets\nwith high levels of HMO activity.\nFinally, it is difficult to know how these\nresults can be extrapolated into the future.\nHMOs may have expanded initially in areas\nwhere there potential to reduce costs was\ngreatest. We included some controls for this,\nbut our results still may overestimate the ef-\nfect of changing HMO penetration and to\nsome extent reflect HMOs' location decisions.\nIf so, future expansions in other areas may not\nachieve the same magnitude of premium sav-\nings. Moreover, other analysts have found\nthat in addition to the HMO market share, the\nlevel of competition among HMOs also affects\npremiums.13 Industry consolidation, therefore,\nReported Change In Employer Premiums, By Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)\nLess than 25 percent\nSOURCE: 1997 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Employer Health Insurance Survey.\na Significantly different from the premium of the lowest HMO penetration group in the survey year, p = .05, two-tailed test.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : M A R K E T W A T C H\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ S e p t e m b e r / O c t o b e r 2 0 0 0\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
