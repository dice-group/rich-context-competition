    "abstract": "Abstract\nLike in any other heteronomous art-forms, the practitioners of Indian music and dance (Bharatiya Sangita) aim at expressing\nemotions and creating the aesthetic or the \"beautiful.\" Indian thinkers and musicologists have gone a step further in declaring\nthat Indian classical music (Raga-Sangita) is the most appropriate means for attaining aesthetic experience and delight, and\nthe most suitable pathway, if not, downright, short-cut, toward self-realization or realization of the Ultimate Reality or\nTruth. Thus, aesthetics and spirituality make up the very woof and warp of the Indian arts, in general, and Raga-Sangita, in\nparticular. Raga-Sangita is, thus, considered a spiritual exercise (nada sadhana) to attain salvation (moksha) through sound.\nThis conceptual article reflects upon and sheds light on the Theory of Rasa, as propounded in Indian Aesthetics, and attempts\nto make an assessment of it in relation to Hindustani Raga-Sangita. Through this theory, the author examines and explains the\ndifferent causes leading to an aesthetic experience, referred to as \"out-of-this-world\" (alaukika). In doing so, he also brings\nto light the possible pitfalls which both the performer and the listener should avoid.\n",

Each musical note in a melody must have a distinctive\nrelation with the preceding and succeeding notes. At the bot-\ntom line, all the musical notes of a melody, while acquiring\nmeaning and becoming expressive from their relation to the\ntonic, make up a \"form\" worth appreciating. This conceptual\narticle studies the ways and means through which emotions\nare expressed in Hindustani Raga-Sangita, and how the \"beau-\ntiful,\" or \"rasa,\" is created and experienced. \"Rasa\" is under-\nstood, literally, as \"juice,\" \"sap,\" or \"flavor.\" When applied to\nart, rasa connotes the idea of relishing aesthetically.\nProblem Statement\nIt is commonly taken for granted by many students of Indian\nmusic, especially those studying Hindustani Raga-Sangita,\nthat the mere singing or playing of the musical notes and the\nemanating melodies correctly with regard to the technical\nand grammatical aspects of the art-form are enough to create\nthe aesthetic. This problem has led to two main wrong prac-\ntices among those learners, namely, (a) mugging up of all\nmusical materials that have the potential to create the \"beau-\ntiful,\" thus discarding completely personal creativity and\ninnovation, and (b) producing the formal structure of a\nmusic, albeit improvised and grammatically correct, but\ndreary, inexpressive, and unaesthetic.\nPurpose of Inquiry and Inquiry\nQuestions\nThis article is intended to throw light on the fact that not\nonly correct singing or playing of the tonal phrases and\nmelodies but also personal creative inputs and expression\nof emotions are crucial to creating and performing good\nmusic. This is an aspect of the rich musical tradition that\n1Mahatma Gandhi Institute & Rabindranath Tagore Institute, Moka,\nMauritius\nCorresponding Author:\nSantosh Kumar Pudaruth, Mahatma Gandhi Institute & Rabindranath\nTagore Institute, Mahatma Gandhi Avenue, Moka, Mauritius.\nEmail: skpudaruth.mgi@intnet.mu\nA Reflection on the Aesthetics of Indian\nMusic, With Special Reference to\nHindustani Raga-Sangita\nSantosh Kumar Pudaruth1\n Keywords\nBharatiya Sangita, Hindustani Raga-Sangita, aesthetics, rasa\n2 SAGE Open\nnot only learners but also teachers in many music educa-\ntion institutions tend to ignore.\nThis study ventures to answer the following questions:\nWhat kind of music is there in the Hindustani musical tradi-\ntion having the most potential characteristics to lead to the\nexperience of \"rasa\" or the aesthetic? What could be the\ncauses (necessary and sufficient causes) leading to rasa expe-\nrience in this system of music? What are the prerequisites for\nand obstacles which subvert the experience of rasa in this\nsystem of Raga-Sangita?\nSignificance of the Inquiry\nThis academic venture is significant, as it tends to inform\nstudents as well as teachers of Indian music of the impor-\ntance of creating a music that is not only grammatically right\nbut also aesthetically profound and emotionally enriching.\nSuch an awareness will inform and affect positively teaching\nand learning strategies and approaches.\nTheoretical and Conceptual\nFramework\nThis submission talks about music, as a means of commu-\nnication, and its aesthetics, and not just as mere rendering\nof tones and melodies, learnt from cramming, albeit with\nsome accuracy. A music performance must have the capac-\nity to not only satisfy the intellectual aspirations of the lis-\nteners but also \"touch their hearts\" and uplift them from\nthe weariness of their ordinary lives. The theory that is best\nsuited to explain the necessary and sufficient causes con-\nducive to aesthetic experience of the highest kind is the\nRasa Theory, as propounded by sage-priest Bharata in his\nNatyashastra, a Sanskrit treatise on drama, and developed\nby the rhetorician and Kashmir Shaivite philosopher,\nAbhinavagupta in his Abhinavabharati. Bharata rightly\nsays in the sixth chapter \"Rasadhyaya\" that \"no meaning-\nful idea is conveyed, if `rasa' is not evoked\"1 (p. 105). This\ntheoretical framework is supported by a conceptual frame-\nwork, which encompasses ornamentations, embellish-\nments, improvisation, and emotional expression, as defined\nin Indian musicology.\nAesthetics as a Field of Inquiry\nAesthetics discusses what is beautiful, interesting, exciting,\nuplifting, and entertaining in such art-forms as music, paint-\ning, drama, sculpture, literature, and dance, among others. In\na general way, depending on the nature of the art-forms, the\n\"beautiful\" is experienced through any one, two, or more of\nthe five senses of perception. In music, the aesthetic, or\n\"rasa,\" is experienced directly through, primarily, the sense\nof hearing and, at most, the sense of sight, in a disinterested\ncontemplative manner.\nIndian Music and Dance (Bharatiya\nSangita)\nThe arts of singing, playing musical instruments, and danc-\ning, collectively designated as \"Sangita,\" are regarded as the\nmain assets and expressions of Indian culture. These art-\nforms, in all their diverse genres, styles, and forms, are\namong the living traditions of the Indians and the Indian\nDiasporas, and are practiced, promoted, and perpetuated\nwith much enthusiasm and earnestness.\nIndian music comprises within its fold a vast, varied, and\nrich tradition of classical, semiclassical, light, and folk\nmusic, which has grown out of the different cultures and sub-\ncultures of India and their mutual sharing. The focus of this\narticle is on Hindustani Raga-Sangita, or classical music\nbased on raga singing, as practiced in the northern part of\nIndia.\nThree Pillars of Raga-Sangita: Raga\n(Melodic Matrix), Tala (Rhythmic\nCycle) and Pada (Lyrics)\n\"Raga\" and \"Tala\" are the two unique and essential concepts\nthat Indian music, be it South Indian or Carnatic Music, or\nNorth Indian or Hindustani Music, has given to the world\n(Gautam, 1980). Pada, or lyrics, however, though being\nimportant in vocal music, is reckoned as extramusical by\nmany musicologists and musicians.\nRaga\nRaga, as it is understood in the Indian musical tradition, does\nnot have its exact equal in other musical practices of the\nworld. Raga \"is the soul of our (India's) musical system\"\ndespite the constant influence of European music on it for the\nlast hundred years or more, has still maintained its unique\nindividual identity. That is basically because of its raga and\ntala system\" (pp. 24-25). Hence, one can say that the Indian\nraga system is so deep-rooted in the musical ethos of the\nconnoisseurs that it will, undoubtedly, stand the test of time\nand the onslaught of change, and escape erosion of its very\nexistence in India and elsewhere.\nSeveral definitions have been put forth by both music\npractitioners and scholars. Very often, raga is defined as a\ncombination of notes or group of notes that can be sung or\nplayed. In short, raga is a melody. A raga is a scale. Raga is\nalso defined as a melodic scheme, which has the capacity to\ncolor or please the mind of the listener. All these definitions\nare not satisfactory, for they are partially true and overly\nsimplistic.\nMatanga, the author of Brihaddesi, defines raga as \"the\npeculiar order of sounds which is decorated, beautified or\nadorned with swara (note) and varna (order or movement)\nPudaruth 3\nand is pleasing to the listener.\"2 Fox Strangways defines\nraga as\nan arbitrary series of notes characterized as far as possible as\nindividuals, by proximity to or remoteness from the note which\nmarks the Tessitura (general level of melody); by a special order\nin which they are usually reinforced by a drone.3\nFrom these, it can be understood that a raga is, fundamen-\ntally, a specific melodic configuration produced out of a\ngroup of notes rendered systematically and beautifully.\nSwami Prajnanananda states that \"a raga is a psycho-mate-\nrial object as it is an objective expression of the subjective\nfeeling of the mind.\"4 \"Expression\" here refers to that \"extra\"\nwhich an artiste adds to and renders in her or his perfor-\nmance, over and above the fixed form, along with the out-\nward manifestation of notes and their prerequisites, to project\nher or his psychological and emotional states. Expression\nimplies freedom, for there can be no expression without indi-\nvidual freedom and creativity.\nThe definition put forth by Saxena (2009b) brings more\nclarifications to the above-stated and thus more lucidity to\nthe understanding of the concept of raga. He states,\nA raga is a specific--and (in a way) living--melodic form which\nserves to permit and determine, as a matrix, the creation and\ncontemplation of music on the basis of the quality, emphases\nand relatedness of tones, as also with the help of rhythmic\nabidance or passage, possibly with an eye to evoking an\nappropriate rasa, but always in accordance with one's individual\ncapacities for technical handling and grasp, visualization, and\naesthetic sensitiveness. (Saxena, 2009b, emphasis in original;\nRaga is a \"living\" form whereby the notes, the parts, are inte-\ngrated into a whole and follow a one-after-another or a\nbefore\u00adafter order. The notes are arranged in a particular\norder in a scale and are related as higher or lower to one\nanother. Besides, two specific notes out of the group of notes\nmust have mutual accord (samvada) and are given more\nprominence, thus bringing inner unity to the raga. Being cre-\nated from the ascending and descending passages of notes, a\nraga is constituted of an inner pulse. On account of the latter,\na raga can be viewed as a living form having movement and\ncoordination among its parts, in short, sharing some features\nof life. Each raga has a distinct perceptible character of its\nown though two different raga-s can have the same notes. A\nraga is a matrix of melody, from whose material and restric-\ntive or permissible principles, an infinite number of melodies\ncan be created.\nTala\nTala or Talam is the other edifice on which Indian music, in\ngeneral, stands. Tala refers to a rhythmic cycle on which a\nsong, an instrumental piece, or a dance is based or set. Just\nlike raga-s comprise notes, tala-s are constituted of beats.\nTala is demonstrated time in music, for being the latter's\ntemporal metric. Tala, thus, is a specific rhythmic arrange-\nment of beats to maintain time in music in a cyclic manner.\nEach cycle is complete in itself and is repetitive. A tala may\nhave different sections of equal or unequal number of beats.\nIn Hindustani Raga-Sangita, each tala has a specific \"theka,\"\nor rhythm signature, a group of basic mnemonic syllables by\nwhich the tala can be identified and recognized.\nPada\nBesides raga and tala, the two essential concepts of Indian\nmusic, pada, or literature, or language also has its impor-\ntance and unique place in this art-form, especially in vocal\nmusic, in all genres, forms, and styles. Pada can be construed\nas follows: (a) metrical or nonmetrical lyrics of vocal music,\nwhich are meaningful; (b) sets of syllables or mnemonics\nused to identify strokes of certain musical instruments, or\nsets of meaningless syllables used in songs (e.g., Tarana and\nalap of Dhrupada); and (c) a specific metrical structure with\na refrain (e.g., Jayadeva's Gita Govinda). All the three cate-\ngories are used in Indian music, in general, whereas in Khyal\nand Dhrupada compositions, the two main genres of\nHindustani Raga-Sangita, the first and third categories, are\nA bandish, or cheez, is a well-knitted composition which\nsynthesizes the key features of a raga, the gait and beat pat-\ntern of a tala, and the meaning and linguistic beauty of a text\ntinct incarnation\" or \"avatara\" of a raga. Each bandish or\ncomposition is a distinct incarnation of a particular raga\nwhich, if properly composed, has the potential to unveil the\nlatter's diverse facets and aesthetic characters.\nUnlike the \"general\" poems, pada or lyrics used in music\nis composed specifically for a raga and tala by a well-versed\nand competent \"musician-poet-composer,\" referred to in\nancient musical treatises as a vaggeyakara. As per the latter's\ndefinition given by Sharangdeva in his Sangitaratnakara, a\ncomposer must not only be a performer but must also have\nknowledge and skill pertaining to grammar, music theories,\naesthetics, languages, patterns of rhythm, and sound used in\npoetry, among others.\nThere are divergent views with regard to the importance\nof text in Indian music, especially Hindustani Raga-Sangita.\nPt. Vidyadhar Vyas, the renowned Khyal exponent of Gwalior\nGharana, affirmed that wordings of a composition are like\n\"pegs on which notes are hung.\" The words of the text in a\nbandish act, merely, as aids to enable delineation of the\nnotes, musical phrases, and tonal features of the raga. Nair\n(2007) aptly brings out this idea and the gist of current prac-\ntices by stating,\n. . . a Khyal singer's emphasis does not fall on the words of the\ncomposition nor, many a time, on the literary or semantic content\n4 SAGE Open\n(there are exceptions). Rather s/he focusses on the melodic\npossibilities that can be unleashed using the vowel and phonemic\npossibilities in words and clusters of well-chosen phrases from\nthe bandish. (p. 19)\nSaxena (2010), on the contrary, stresses on the idea of \"pure\nmusic or music alone\" which \"eschews both languages and\nbeats organized as rhythm-cycles (tala), and which can yet\nbe very expressive and generally winsome\" (p. 70). He quali-\nfies alap of the Dhrupada genre as \"pure\" music which is\n\"free from admixture with what is not absolutely essential to\nthis art, that is, language and beat-measured rhythm (or tala)\"\ntial\" makes more explicit the idea that lyrics is important, but\nnot necessarily crucial for enabling appreciation of good\nHindustani Raga-Sangita and aesthetic experience of the\nhighest type. In this sense, very often, literature or pada has\nbeen considered as \"extramusical.\" Saxena (2010) goes to\nthe extent of saying that language, if not rendered correctly,\ncan even damage a graceful musical passage and its flow\nbecause of its \"diversity of letters\" and syllables and \"their\nvarying volumes.\" To the question what makes pure music,\nfor example, alap of the Dhrupada genre; expressive and\ncapable of aesthetic appeal; the tunefulness of the notes and\nmusical passages; the evocative and contemplative pace and\nmanner of the singing; the aesthetic effects of profundity,\nserenity, continuity, and grandeur produced from the raga\nand its potential for delineation; the judicious and correct use\nof the ornamentations; the voice production of the singer;\nand the different emotions evoked, among others; in short,\nthe overall raga \"form\"6 of the alap-singing have been given\nas some of the causal factors, both necessary and sufficient,\nfor aesthetic experience.\nForm, Melodic Form and Musical Form\nThe term \"form\" is derived from French \"forme\" and Latin\n\"forma,\" which means shape or an appearance. The term\n\"form\" in daily life refers to \"shape,\" for example, round\nshape or appearance, but this definition is not so appropriate\nto explain the main characteristics of \"form\" in arts.\nIn art and aesthetics, the term \"form\" (in singular) refers\nto an organization of interrelated, diverse materials whereby\neach material heightens the significance of the other materi-\nals (Saxena, 2011). Form is, thus, a \"distinct whole of agree-\nably related parts\" (Mittal, 2000). Form exhibits both unity\nand variety.\nBourriaud (1998), rightly, defines form as an \"indepen-\ndent entity of inner dependencies.\" All the different features,\nor elements of an art-work, when put together, construct a\ncoherent unity or structure and that unity or structure is\nreferred to as \"form.\" Form is, thus, the whole and that whole\nis made up of parts. It is the form, the whole, and not the\ndistinctive parts, which determines how the art-work \"looks,\"\nand how it is given to one who perceives and appreciates it.\nForm in Indian music and dance is apprehended through sen-\nsory experience and imagination, and is the object of aes-\nthetic contemplation and delight.\nA raga is said to be a specific melodic form, which acts as\na matrix of melody, as it is formed from, among others, the\nnotes, the predominance of one of them, the unity among\nthem, the importance of some as compared with others, their\ninterconnectedness (consonance) and harmony, the avoid-\nance of some other notes (dissonance), their before\u00adafter\norder and higher\u00adlower order, their depth and proportion,\nand the pace or tempi at which they are used (Saxena, 2010).\nIt is a form, as it is an integrated, organized complex, and a\nmelodic form, as the notes follow a before\u00adafter order, which\nis more vertical than horizontal, given the ascending and\ndescending order of its notes. It is a specific melodic form in\nthe sense that each raga is different from one another. It is a\nmatrix of melody, as it permits the creation of an unlimited\nnumber of melodies (Mittal, 2000). This specific melodic\nform (raga) is fundamental in Indian classical music, as there\nis form even in alap and any other type of unbound (anibad-\ndha or manodharma) music as well.\nThe term \"forms\" (in plural) refers to musical structures\nand their varieties, which are made up, basically, of the three\nmain elements, namely, melody (raga), rhythm (tala), and\npoetry (pada). These musical structures are called musical\nforms or bandish-s. Given this, it is noteworthy that a musi-\ncal form is also a form (in singular), for it is also a formal\nunity (Saxena, 2011). The different musical forms refer to\nsuch genres as Khyal, Dhrupada, Tarana, Thumri, and\nGhazal, among others. As these are also formal unities of\nraga and tala, they can be considered as \"forms with forms\"\nIt is through its form that a piece of music acquires its\nuniqueness, individuality, and, more importantly, its beauty.\nAesthetic experience arises from the contemplation of the\ncreated form, and when that form is accessible and accept-\nable to perception and imagination of a rasika or connois-\nseur, it is reckoned as \"the beautiful.\"\nAccording to musicologists and aesthetic thinkers, art\nmay not be a thing of beauty or something which is appealing\nto the eyes. It is rather the expression of form that an artist/e\ncan create. An art-object may not be beautiful, but it must\nhave a form or a coherent structure (Mittal, 2000; Saxena,\nIndian Aesthetics\nIndian Aesthetics is unique insofar as it hovers around and is\nunderstandable through the theory of \"rasa.\" Indian aesthet-\nics examines the capacity of music, or any art-form such as\ndrama and dance, to transmit, and stimulate or induce an\nemotional state in the performers and educe the same state in\nthe contemplators or connoisseurs, or \"rasika-s,\" as they are\ncalled in Sanskrit. This emotional state expressed through\nthese arts, according to the theory, is experienced as \"rasa.\"\nPudaruth 5\nThe experience of \"rasa,\" which can also be translated as\n\"aesthetic consciousness,\" \"feeling par excellence,\" or \"sub-\nlimated emotion,\"7 is different from one's daily experiences\nof emotions such as anger, love, compassion, joy, and sor-\nrow. According to Bharata, the experience of these mental\npredispositions or basic emotions is either pleasant or\nunpleasant in ordinary real life, but when these are experi-\nenced (rasanubhava) through complete identification or\nabsorption (tanmayi bhavana) with any art-works, they are\nexperienced, invariably, as delight, bliss, rapture, or ecstasy\n(ananda). The essence of rasa is enjoyment and such enjoy-\nment is experienced as long as its stimuli continue. Such an\nexperience of delight, which cannot be expressed in words or\ngrasped by the mind,8 comes in a flash and is akin to the\ndelight of knowing or experiencing God (brahmananda\nsahodara).9\nMost thinkers agree that it is the aesthetic experience\n(rasanubhuti) which a person, with the right aesthetic atti-\ntude, experiences through arts which brings her or him nearer\nto self-realization or emancipation from the shackles of the\negocentric impulses. Through the arts, one can have a fore-\ntaste of freedom from the limited self and a motivation to\ntranscend it. However, the right aesthetic attitude consisting\nof an absence of all interests in practical life, which implies a\nkind of distancing or detachment (vairagya) from all the\npractical needs of life and a complete identification with the\nwork of art and/or the artiste, is required, hence paving the\nway for experiencing \"universalization\" (sadharanikarana)\ninstead of \"personalization.\" This is what thinkers could\nhave implied when they explained aesthetic experience as\n\"to become one\" with the object of art.\nIn the words of Saxena (2009a), aesthetic experience does\ndisconnect the art experiencer (rasika) from the \"spatio-tempo-\nral awareness and utilitarian interests\" of his everyday life. The\nlocus of rasanubhuti is the experiencer's mental state of \"imag-\ninative self-identification\" or universalization with the work of\nart and its inherent emotion. Gautam (1988) affirms that such\nan experience is an integrated and an indivisible one. It is self-\nluminous, as it does not require any mediator for its knowledge.\nIt comes as a flash of delight. It is ecstatic in nature and is very\nmuch akin to a spiritual experience. In this experience, there is\nno distinction among knower, known, and knowledge. It is an\nintuitive experience, hence an immediate one. Such an experi-\nence has been compared with the bliss of self-realization as,\nfirst, there is no dichotomy between knower and known, and,\nsecond, there is no egocentric consciousness. The experience is\ntranscendental and supra-mundane in nature. It can be experi-\nenced or relished by someone who is sensitive to beauty, thus\nnot given to everyone. In fact, aesthetic experience is the enjoy-\nment of \"one's (own) being, as an intrinsic, indivisible aspect\nof one's self\" (Saxena, 2009a). Notwithstanding its similarity\nto spiritual experience, Saxena (2009a) puts forth a note of cau-\ntion. Although aesthetic experience is considered as \"akin to\nthe bliss of self-realization,\" it does not bestow self-realization.\nAt its best, it can release the rasika temporarily from the\nvicissitudes of her or his life because of the emergence and\nexperience of pure \"happiness with absolute peace . . .\" But as\nsoon as this beatitude of aesthetic experience subsides, the indi-\nvidual returns to her or his usual state of dichotomy between\nherself or himself and the world.\nCreativity and Expression in Hindustani\nRaga-Sangita\nRaga-Sangita consists of delineating a raga or melodic matrix\nthrough singing, or playing of a musical instrument, while\ndeveloping and expanding its hidden tonal potentials and char-\nacteristic features with a view to evoking emotions in the\nminds of the listeners, hence paving the way for the experience\nof rasa and delight. This is achieved by rendering two kinds of\nmusic, namely, nibaddha (bound) and anibaddha (unbound).\nThese two concepts denote composition and improvisation,\nrespectively.\nAs mentioned earlier, a composition or bandish refers to a\nwell-knitted, structured musical form set to a specific\nmelodic form (raga) and rhythmic cycle (tala) having a text,\nlyrics, or poetry. There is a large plethora of compositions in\nHindustani Raga-Sangita. The focus of discussion in this\narticle is on the two main classical musical forms, namely,\nDhrupada-Dhamar and Khyal. These are not only musical\nforms or compositions but also two different genres in their\nown right. Both are appropriate for delineation and expan-\nsion (raga elaboration) through improvisation.\nImprovisation can be defined as \"spontaneous singing or\nplaying.\" Improvisation is \"not pre-determined\" and com-\nprises various nuances, variations, embellishments, and\nornamentations sung by the performer during her or his\nrecital (Nooshin & Widdess, 2005). Through such extempore\nimprovisation, the raga is developed gradually and its whole\n\"personality\" is built up, projected, and relished by the audi-\nence as well as the performer. Either the raga alone (as in\nalap) or both the raga and lyrics are developed through\nimprovisation within a set rhythmic cycle with the ultimate\naim of creating, expressing, and awakening various emo-\ntions, one of which can be the most predominant and pervad-\ning one, whereas others, more transient and subservient in\nnature. For example, love can be the dominant emotion and\nothers such as longing, jealousy, stupefaction, anxiety, joy,\nsadness, anger, and pity, among others, which are connected,\nin one way or the other, to the dominant one, can be the tran-\nsitory and servile ones. When the dominant emotion is expe-\nrienced, along with the passing moods and emotions, in a\nsteady but impersonal, disinterested, and contemplative\nmanner, it is realized as rasa by the connoisseur as well as\nthe performer. Such a lofty experience comes in a flash and\nis short-lived, but leaves a permanent and an enriching\nimprint on the listener's mind. However, the fact related to\nthe imperativeness of improvisation for self-expression and\nexpression of one's moods and emotions can never be over-\nemphasized upon.\n6 SAGE Open\nHaving said this, the method of raga elaboration through\nimprovisation in Dhrupada genre differs from that of Khyal.\nRaga Elaboration in Dhrupada-Dhamar\nGenre\nDhrupada is the oldest living vocal and instrumental classi-\ncal genres within the Hindustani system. Sanyal (1987)\nmaintains that Dhrupada is the most profound living tradi-\ntion of Hindu spiritual music. It is a kind of music much\nricher than any other musical genres because of its tonal\ncomplexities and stylistic renderings. Saxena (2010) claims\nthat the word \"Dhrupada\" refers not only to a specific genre\nof vocal classical music but also to the compositions preva-\nlent in this genre. \"Dhruva\" means fixed, unchanging, eter-\nnal, and \"Pada,\" text or lyrics; thus, Dhrupada is a text\ncomposed in praise of the Eternal, Unchanging, Immutable,\nand Ultimate Reality. However, not only the text of the\ncomposition is said to be spiritual, as it often has as subject-\nmatter themes related to spirituality, but also, more impor-\ntantly, the kinesis and expressions of the musical notes.\nA typical Dhrupada recital starts with alap, the unfold-\ning of the tonal potential of the raga, in very slow tempo\nusing mnemonic syllables. Alap is not constrained by tala\nor lyrics. After the slow-moving alap reaches its climax,\nthe singer proceeds to the jod and jhala, which are ren-\ndered in different tempos or varieties of aesthetic pace to\nexplore the raga in its entirety. According to the present\nresearcher, the last phase marks metaphorically, so to say,\nthe culmination of the spiritual journey into ecstatic delight\nand freedom whereby the ego is sublimated and thus tran-\nscended. Varma (2009) states, in this regard, that \"[A]lapa\nis basically the `spread-out' of the spiritual aesthetic vision\nof the musician . . . Alapa thus expands what is latent in the\nindividual\" (p. 73). After the alap-jod-jhala segment, that\nis the anibaddha or unbound singing, is over, the nibad-\ndha, or bound singing, the composition, is sung in its\nentirety. This is followed by another segment of \"anibad-\ndha\" music rendered in a playful way called upaj. The per-\nformer improvises with the words of the text in different\ntunes and layakari-s or tempi within a specific tala, to,\ntime and again, reach and bring together the opening\nphrase of the composition, or mukhda and its culminating\nbeat with the first beat of the tala, or sam, in every cycle,\nor avartana. Reaching this meeting point (sam) together\nbestows a very intense feeling of relief, satisfaction, and\nhappiness in the performers, the vocalist/s and\npercussionist/s, as well as the audience.\nThe improvisational aspects of Dhamar are very much\nsimilar to that of Dhrupada. However, the alap-jod-jhala\nphase is shorter and less profound, and the upaj segment is\nbouncier and colorful. It is very interesting to note that in\nboth the genres, the text (pada) as well as the melodic form\n(raga) are subject to elaboration through improvisation.\nRaga Elaboration in Khyal Genre\nKhyal is regarded as the most popular vocal genre of singing\nin Hindustani Raga-Sangita today. The Arabic and Persian\nword \"Khyal\" means imagination, whim, vision, fantasy,\nfancy, and thought, among others. Khyal is, thus, the imagi-\nnative rendering of the musician, which is full of feelings and\nfancy. This genre is appreciated for its fluid, flexible, and\nexpansive character and its amenability to greater use of\nornamentations and embellishments to maximize aesthetic\nexpressiveness.\nKhyal singing and its creative and improvisational fac-\nets differ in terms of presentation and emphasis from one\nmusical lineage (gharana)10 to another. Yet, the ornamen-\ntations and embellishments are, more or less, similar across\nthe board. Both the nibaddha (preset composition) and\nanibaddha (spontaneous improvisation) forms of music\nare present in Khyal singing. After introducing the raga\nand the composition, different kinds of embellishments\nsuch as swara alap, akar alap, and bol-alap; swara\nbehelava and bol behelava; and swar tana, akar tana, and\nbol-tana are sung within the composition for delineating\nthe raga. These are rendered through the musical notes\n(swara-s) and/or wordings of the composition with various\nkinds of tonal graces (gamaka-s).\nHindustani Raga-Sangita and Rasa\nExperience\nHindustani Raga-Sangita is more suitable for awakening\nrasa in the mind of the listeners for being, first, a largely\n\"improvised\" (Nooshin & Widdess, 2005) kind of music\nwhereby individual creativity is appreciated and praised;\nsecond, a heteronomous art-form, thus always making ref-\nerence to and depicting some emotions outside itself; third,\na music comprising various \"channels\" through which a\nwide range of human emotions can be expressed; fourth, a\ngenre of music which is sweetly rendered in a \"tranquil,\nyearning or ecstatic, and dignified manner\" (Saxena,\nnature; and, finally, an art-form capable of reducing drasti-\ncally the agitations of the mind, the root cause of all trials\nand tribulations of existence. While talking about\nHindustani Raga-Sangita, Thielemann (2001) claims that\n\"[W]hile proceeding on his spiritual path, man resorts to\nmusic as a vehicle . . . [and] a suitable tool to attain to\nhigher spiritual ends because of its capacity to intensify the\nthe world-renowned Sitar player, while talking about\nHindustani Raga-Sangita, remarks that a raga is \"the pro-\njection of the artist's inner spirit, a manifestation of his\nmost profound sentiments and sensibilities brought forth\nthrough tones and melodies\" (para. 11).\nIt is worth noting that, given the complexity of\nHindustani Raga-Sangita, only a trained contemplator or a\nPudaruth 7\nconnoisseur (sahrdaya) can understand and appreciate a\nraga performance and help contribute to the kind of \"give\nand take\" between her or him and the artist/e, an element so\ncrucial for the evocation or projection or manifestation of\nrasa, which, in turn, gives rise to the experience of delight\n(ananda). Conversely, the \"primary or immediate quality\"\n(Saxena, 2009b) of a raga, such as sweetness of notes and\nthe like, can be accessible to everyone, irrespective of one's\ntraining in and knowledge of music.\nBe it clearly understood also, however, as Saxena\n(2009b) points out, that rasa \"is not mere emotion conveyed\nby, or expressed through the form of the raga; it is the emo-\ntive look of the raga-rupa (melodic form) itself . . .\"\n(emphasis in original). What is being stressed upon here is\nthat the whole melodic form, or \"raga-rupa,\" and not just a\npart of it, becomes the embodiment of an emotional state. It\nis the tonal quality of the correlated sounds and the inner\ndynamic of the raga which convey its emotive content.\nCauses Leading to Rasa Experience in\nHindustani Raga-Sangita\nAccording to Bharata, there are eight basic human emotions,\nor mental predispositions (sthayibhava-s), and their corre-\nsponding sublimated feelings (rasa-s) that could be experi-\nenced in drama (natya) as follows:\nBhava-s Rasa-s\n1. Rati (Love) Shringara (Erotic)\n2. Hasa (Laughter) Hasya (Humorous)\n3. Shoka (Grief) Karuna (Compassionate)\n4. Krodha (Tendency to become angry) Raudra (Furious)\n5. Utsaha (Tendency to feel enthused) Vira (Valorous)\n6. Bhaya (Propensity to feel afraid) Bhayanaka (Fearful)\n7. Jugupsa (Tendency to dislike, abhor) Vibhatsa (Odious)\n8. Vismaya (Prone to wonder) Adbhuta (Wondrous)\n9. Nirveda (Detachment) Shanta (Peaceful)\nThe ninth bhava and rasa, namely, Nirveda and Shanta,\nrespectively, were later additions, due to the high influence\nof the Buddhist philosophy and the artistic representations of\nthe Buddha in meditative posture on Indian aesthetics.\nWhen any one of these emotions (first column) is\nexpressed through drama, its corresponding rasa or \"feeling\npar excellence\" (second column) can arise in the mind of the\nperformer as well as the connoisseur. Rasa experience builds\non and arises from the interplay of these natural, permanent\ntendencies or predispositions of the mind (sthayibhava-s)\npresent in the performer as well as the perceiver or contem-\nplator with (a) vibhava-s--alambana and uddipan--objec-\ntive stimuli such as the main protagonists (alambana), and\nthe props or created surroundings and stage decoration, and\nother subordinate or secondary characters (uddipan); (b)\nanubhava-s--bodily movements (angika), speech (vachika),\ninvoluntary signs such as tears (sattvika), and costumes,\nlighting, and music and dance (aharya); and (c) fleeting and\ntransitory emotional states (sancharibhava-s and vyabhich-\naribhava-s). All these subjective and objective elements\nwhen brought together give rise to the experience of rasa by\nboth the performers and the sensitive and discriminating\naudiences.\nIf we apply the vibhava-s (determinants) and anubhava-s\n(consequents) of drama to live music, the main musician and\naccompanying musicians and the main character of the lyrics\n(bandish) would be the vibhava-s; the performers and/or the\nmain characters as depicted in the text become the alambana,\nand the stage decoration, accompanying musicians, and/or\nthe environment and secondary characters (e.g., sakhi) as\nmentioned in the text, the uddipan. The musical sounds\n(vachika), facial expressions (kayika), emotions felt and\nexpressed by the musicians (satwik), and their costumes,\nappearance, and demeanor (aharya) on stage would then be\nthe anubhava-s. The sthayibhava-s are the predominant\nemotions that are expressed by the performer as well as pro-\njected through the wordings of the text and their meanings.\nSancharibhava-s and vyabhicharibhava-s are the fleeting,\ntransitory, and less predominant emotions that well up and\nfade out during and throughout the performances.\nIn the case of recorded music too, there can be aesthetic\nexperience of the highest kind. Although the main musician or\nthe main protagonists of the lyrics (e.g., Radha\u00adKrishna; alam-\nbana), and the accompanying musicians (uddipana), are not\nseen, the texture, quality, and timbre of the voice, or musical\ninstruments of the musician and accompanying musicians, the\ntext and its meaning (in the case of vocal music), and the qual-\nity of the sound of the recording could be considered as vib-\nhava-s. The sounds of the musical notes produced by them\neither through singing or playing a musical instrument, the pre-\nciseness and correctness of the notes sung or played, the judi-\ncious use of ornamentations and embellishments, the personal\ncreativity of the performer, and the emotions felt and expressed\nby the performer will make up the anubhava-s. Together with\nthe sthayibhava-s (predominant emotion/s evoked by the raga\nand text), sancharibhava-s, and vyabhicharibhava-s (the\n8 SAGE Open\ntransitory, fleeting, and less predominant emotions), which\ncould all be heard while listening to a recorded music, the vib-\nhava-s and anubhava-s could, undoubtedly, help evoke rasa in\nthe listener or connoisseur (rasika), provided, first, all these are\nexperienced in an impersonal or \"unindividualized\" way by her\nor him, and, second, there are no factors leading to \"rasa\nbhang,\" or obstacles to aesthetic experience.\nWhen these multiple \"bhava-s\" are expressed and experi-\nenced in an \"unindividualized\" manner by the performers\nand contemplated, in turn, by the connoisseurs (rasika-s) in a\nyet impersonal way in both live and recorded music, the\nmain emotions are awakened and realized as rasa. The ego-\nsense is surrendered for some time but not \"rubbed out\"\ncompletely, as in mystical experience. This implies some\nkind of detachment on the part of both the performer and the\nlistener or contemplator from their limited individuality, the\nego-consciousness. Raga-Sangita is, thus, regarded as a jour-\nney from the emotional to the spiritual.\nBefore we move on further, let us put forth a clarification\nof the word \"spiritual.\" Saxena (2010) states that the word\n\"spiritual\" carries two meanings: a secular and a nonsecular\none. He defines secular spirituality as a state and a process\n\"belonging to or arising from the mind or intellect; or highly\nrefined in thought or feeling,\" and nonsecular spirituality as\n\"belonging, referring, or relating to the spirit or soul rather\nthan to the body or to physical things; belonging, referring,\nrelating to religion; or sacred, holy, divine\" (Saxena, 2010,\nsearch for refinement in thought and feeling. Likewise,\nThrosby (2001) refers to spirituality as that which involves\nenlightenment, understanding, insight, and global or univer-\nsal awareness. This is basically a Western view of spiritual-\nity. Nonsecular spirituality, which is typical of the Indian\nview, refers to such matters as ego, soul, and salvation.\nMusic, according to Saxena (2010), is conducive to self-real-\nization or the realization of the spirit (atman-brahman)\nwithin. In the same line of thought, Gautam (1980) defines\nspiritual attainment as \"the transcendence of the limitations\nof egocentric impulses, where all consciousness of duality\nThe crux of spirituality from the Hindu religion's perspec-\ntive is the annihilation of the ego-sense, the source of all\nphysical, mental, and intellectual ills, and the attainment of\npeace and tranquility within. Realization of tranquility or\nserenity, which gives rise to humility, is regarded as an\nimportant sign of spiritual attainment. In this regard, Gautam\n(1980) throws light on the state of tranquility, which can be\nachieved while performing Hindustani Raga-Sangita, by\nsaying that\nthe melody produced (out of the notes of a particular raga) will\ncreate within him (the artiste) an ineffable tranquility. It seems\nparadoxical to produce musical sound without; when silence\nreigns within. This is, as I understand it, the \"summum bonum\"\nThis tranquility, if correctly expressed and conveyed, has the\ncapacity to invade the whole being of the listener as well,\nprovided he or she is attuned to receiving it. Vatsyayan\n(1972) refers to this state of tranquility as the \"still centre of\nbeing.\"\nAesthetic experience (rasasnubhuti) and aesthetic delight\n(rasananda), as they are understood in the Indian tradition,\nare said to be akin to spiritual consciousness and the bliss of\nself-realization, but one is, simply, not the other; at best, aes-\nthetic experience, which is a transcendental, educative expe-\nrience, can make the ideal goal of spiritual life appear\nreachable or \"feasible.\" It is, therefore, not difficult to make\nout why most accomplished musicians in the Hindu tradi-\ntion, for example, Saint Tyagarara, Swami Haridas, and the\nlike, were worship-worthy saints in their own right.Although\napparently two distinct paths, aesthetic and spirituality\nunveiled their meeting points to those noble souls.\nDetermining Elements of Hindustani\nRaga-Sangita Leading to Aesthetic\nExperience: Swara-s, Ornamentations,\nEmbellishments, and Expression of\nEmotions\nBefore attempting to discuss further the determining ele-\nments of Hindustani Raga-Sangita in a detailed manner, let\nus, first of all, make some clarifications as to the two terms\n\"ornamentations\" and \"embellishments,\" and their distinc-\ntions and overlaps, as these were debated in ancient musical\ntreatises and are understood in present-day Hindustani clas-\nsical music scenario.\nIn ancient musical treatises, two types of alankara were\nmentioned, namely, varnalankar and shabdalankar.\nVarnalankar referred to tonal movements based on the four\nvarna-s, namely, sthayi, arohi, avrohi, and sanchari; and\nshabdalankar meant all other sonic production techniques\nrendered by the voice or a musical instrument. Therefore,\nvarnalankar related \"to the structural aspect\" of a raga\nwhereas shabdalankar \"comprised the aesthetic aspect.\" So,\nin ancient times, shabdalankar referred to \"everything that a\nperformer wove both melodically and rhythmically outside\nthe periphery of the fixed composition,\" thus encompassing\ntoday's ornamentations (kan, khatka, murkhi, etc.) and\nembellishments (alap, behelava, tana, etc.), excluding the\nfour aforesaid tonal movements.\nBut, as per current practices, the eight anga-s or limbs,\nnamely, alap, sargam, bol-alap, behelava, bol-behelava,\nbol-banth, tana, and bol-tana as well as kaku would, collec-\ntively, be termed shabdalankar or embellishments, and the\ntonal ornamentations such as kan, murkhi, meend, and oth-\ners, alankara or ornamentations. The various arrangements\nof notes in specific sequences rendered for training purpose,\nespecially by beginners, however, are called varnalankar, or,\nsimply, alankara or vocal exercise.\nPudaruth 9\nHowever, more often than not, these two terms, namely,\nornamentations and embellishments, are used interchange-\nably by both students and teachers. There are different defi-\nnitions and interpretations for these two terms. In spite of\nthis, I believe that a line of demarcation has to be drawn\nbetween the two, and ancient musical treatises could give us\na hint on how to go about it. But what matters most is that, at\nthe end of the day, learners should be able to render these\nornamentations and embellishments flawlessly, whether\nthese are raga-specific or form-specific (ITC, Sangeet\nResearch Academy).11\nSwara-s\nThe basic elements of Hindustani Raga-Sangita having the\ncapacity to lead to aesthetic experience are the 22 shruti-s\n(microtones). Out of these 22 microtones, a minimum num-\nber of five and a maximum number of seven could be selected\nfor a particular raga and these become its notes (swara-s) in\nascending and descending order. In the words of Dr.\nVidyadhar Oke,12 a swara is a chosen, single frequency, and\nhas softness, viscosity, steadiness, resonance, accuracy, and\ndelightfulness or the capacity to please the listeners'mind, as\nfundamental qualities. Generally, it is said that there are 12\ndifferent pitches as follows: S r R g G m M P d D n N. Dr.\nOke further states that out of these, besides Sa and Pa which\nare already single frequencies, thus notes in their own right,\n10 are, strictly speaking, not notes, but frequency ranges of\nnotes or ranges of individual frequencies called swarak-\nshetra-s. In each of those 10 frequency ranges or swarak-\nshetra-s, there are two shruti-s, and any one selected from\nthese for a raga becomes its (raga's) note or swara. For\nexample, r is, in fact, a frequency range having two individ-\nual frequencies (a lower r1 and a higher r2): r1 as is used in\nraga Todi, and a higher r2 as is used in raga Bhairav. It is also\nsaid that the distinction between a tone and a \"swara\" (musi-\ncal note) is only in terms of the latter's amount of refinement,\nas compared with the former's plainness. Hence, a tone has\nto be made into a swara through in-depth reflection and rig-\norous practice.\nOrnamentations\nHaving said this, the swara-s or refined tones alone cannot\nbring out the aesthetic potentials of a raga. In the latter, the\nmusical notes need to be rendered with ornamentations\nknown as \"gamaka-s\" or \"alankar-s.\" Parshvadeva sheds\nlight on the concept of \"gamaka\" as follows:\nWhen in a song a note peeps over the region of its own legitimate\nshruti-s (microtones) a shade into the region of its (higher or\nlower) neighbours a `Gamaka' is there. (Ranade, 1976, p. 36)\nThese subtle ornamentations or \"graces\" are integral to the\nnotes of each distinct raga, and not extrinsic and accidental\nto it. Those graces can be expressed in different ways, either\nas a glide from one note to another, or touch of one, two, or\nthree notes with another, or simply a shake to a particular\nnote. Therefore, each raga acquires its uniqueness because\nof not only its musical notes but also the latter's aesthetically\nrendered, accompanying graces. Thus, in Indian music, a\nbare note, as is played on a keyboard, or a staccato, is very\nrarely used, if at all. Each note is linked to its preceding or\nsucceeding note. A musical note, to be qualified as \"musi-\ncal,\" must invariably move along with its graces.\nWithout going into the origin and historical development\nof gamaka in Indian music, for this is beyond the purview of\nthis article, the author now moves on to the types of orna-\nmentations which are used in Hindustani Music in the pres-\nent time. Suffice it to say, the different types of gamaka-s, as\nmentioned in some old music treatises, for example,\nNatyashastra of Bharat Muni and Sangitaratnakara of\nSharangdeva, are still being used today, but under different\nappellations.\nOrnamentations in Khyal Genre\nAs mentioned earlier, Khyal is the most popular genre of\nHindustani or North Indian classical vocal music nowadays.\nThis form of singing involves a lot of improvisation and cre-\nativity in its rendering.\nThe ornamentations used in Khyal singing are as follows.\nKan or sparsh. When a note is sung or played with a touch of\na preceding or succeeding note, a kan or sparsh is produced\nand thus embellishes that main note.\nMeend.This is a slow glide from one note to another in\nascending (anuloma) or descending (viloma) order with a\nview to connecting and bringing them to light. Meend is a\nunique tonal grace in the sense that it is used only in Indian\nmusic.\nKhatka. This ornamentation is executed in fast speed around\na main note. The main note is embellished with a touch of the\nnext higher note and then with that of the next lower note, or\nvice versa. This is also known as gitkiri in instrumental\nmusic.\nMurkhi. Murkhi is softer than a khatka, but as fast as the lat-\nter. It is rendered in a cluster around a main note, but instead\nof involving four notes, it does with only three notes.\nZamzamma. If a series of murkhi is executed in ascending or\ndescending order, a new kind of ornamentation called\nzamzamma is produced. Such ornamentation is mostly used\nin Sitar.\nAndolan. This is rendered by doing a gentle oscillation of a\nnote so much so that it involves the microtones of its higher\ncounterpart; thus, it is a subtle oscillation in between two\nnotes. The note on which the oscillation takes place is called\nthe andolita swar. It is worth noting that andolan is raga\nspecific and thus cannot be used whimsically in any raga.\nGamaka. This is a specific type of ornamentation bearing the\nsame name as its generic term \"gamaka.\" If a musical move-\nment between, let us say, Sa and Re is rendered in slow\nspeed, it becomes a meend. But if the same movement is\nexecuted with force in fast speed from below or above, a\ngamaka is produced.\nKampana. This is rendered by oscillating a note in fast speed,\nand the resulting effect is a shake or a vibrato.\nLahak and hudak. These are typical ornamentations rendered\nin the Dhrupada genre of singing. Lahak is a grace move-\nment produced by singing a note from below with a slight\ntouch of breath force. In hudak, the same exercise is per-\nformed with a heavier pull from below with a more forceful\nbreath exhalation that creates a \"hum\" sound.\nDhuran and muran. Dhuran and muran are rendered when\nthe musical notes are sung in a rounded pattern in ascending\nand descending order, respectively.\nAll the above-mentioned ornamentations have very\nimportant functions in Hindustani Raga-Sangita:\ni. They embellish the music;\nii. They bring out the salient features of the melodic\nmatrix or raga;\niii. They strengthen the genre or form of music being\nperformed and segregate it from others;\niv. They demarcate Hindustani Raga-Sangita from other\nsystems of music in the world;\nv. They act as vehicles to express various emotions and\nmoods.\nHowever, it is to be noted that the above-stated ornamen-\ntations should be executed in such a way that they do not\nappear \"artificial\" or \"formal.\" One has to practice very hard\nand systematically for their proper execution, but once they\nare used in a raga, they should blend into the very personal-\nity of that raga. This is achieved through proficiency and\nself-expression. Sanyal (1987) poins out in this regard that a\nperformer must transcend the formal structure of a raga in\norder to experience and project the beautiful (pp. 175-206).\nEmbellishments in Hindustani Raga-Sangita\nThe most important types of embellishments are alap (raga\ndelineation in slow tempo) and its kinds, behelava (raga\ndelineation in moderate tempo comprising different rhyth-\nmic patterns) and its kinds, and tana (raga delineation in fast\ntempo) and its kinds. These embellishments are part and\nparcel of Khyal singing. Alap using mnemonic syllables\n(nom-tom) rendered at different speed (sphurita), and upaj\n(improvisation with the wordings of the composition in dif-\nferent rhythmic divisions) forms an integral part of Dhrupada\nsinging. Instrumental music, such as Violin and Sitar,\ninvolves most of these forms of embellishments.\nThere is yet another form of embellishment known as\n\"kaku\" that occupies an important place in Indian Music, be\nit Hindustani or Carnatic. Kaku refers to a specific sound\nmodulation in the rendering of the musical notes to convey\nthe multilayered meaning and emotions and moods of a text\nand/or the diverse shades and nuances of a raga. In vocal\nmusic, the performer takes recourse to different \"voices\" in\ndifferent timbres and volumes to express his or her inner\nfeelings in a varied way, thus creating a tension in quest of a\nresolution. Just like a dancer takes recourse to abhinaya to\nexpress a plethora of emotions, a vocalist or instrumentalist\nuses kaku as vocal abhinaya to give vent to the complexities\nof human emotions through voice modulations. Although six\ntypes of kaku have been mentioned in ancient musical trea-\ntises, in actual practices, any kind of tonal or vocal modula-\ntion having the capacity to evoke a particular emotion is\nconsidered a kaku. Having said that, it is noteworthy that\nkaku is used quite sparsely in Dhrupada and Khyal genres,\nlest its excessive use might dilute their sobriety and chastity\nas classical genres.\nExpression of Emotions in Hindustani Raga-\nSangita\nMusic as an art-form must satisfy both the heart and the\nhead. One is even tempted to go a step further in saying that\nwhen music touches the heart, it overwhelms the whole\nbeing so much so that very little space is left for intellectual\nrealization, thus transcending the knower\u00adknown dichotomy.\nIt is a journey from the heart to the soul, the emotional to the\nspiritual. For music to have such an impact on one's emo-\ntional being, it ought to be made into an appropriate means to\ncommunicate inner feelings and thus fully expressive in\nnature.\nBy being a heteronomous art-form, unlike autonomous\nart-forms which are strictly self-referential, Hindustani\nRaga-Sangita is an integral part of the empirical life of man,\nas it always points to some emotive, social, moral, religious,\nor spiritual values. \"Heteronomous art . . . imitates, repre-\nsents, or expresses things outside itself\" (Hamilton, 2007,\npara. 27). Let alone the lyrics of a composition, which is\nobviously heteronomous in nature, even a raga refers to and\nconveys an emotion beyond its own melodic form which can\nbe revived and relished by the connoisseurs each time the\nraga is sung or played. Even a tala played at a certain speed\nis replete with references beyond itself. For example,\nTeentala played at fast speed can never convey the sentiment\nof pathos.\nHaving said this, it is imperative for and incumbent upon\nthe practitioners to express emotions while performing, and\nnot just to demonstrate the mere technical excellence. A\nmusic which is mugged up and/or stresses excessively on\ntechnical excellence is devoid of its quintessence or sap\n(rasa) and is thus \"empty,\" arid, and uninspiring. However,\none will never overemphasize on the fact that to make one's\nmusic become a vehicle for the expression of emotions, one\nhas to master the \"nuts and bolts\" of the art-form. Extensive\nlearning and listening, intensive analysis and reflection, and\nrigorous practice and refinement are the basic pedagogical\nobligations for all students of Raga-Sangita during their\ntraining or \"taleem\" period, which can easily extend over a\ndecade or more. It is only then that Raga-Sangita becomes an\nobject of contemplation for the talented performer as well as\nthe sensitive and discriminating listener (rasika).\nConclusion\nPrerequisites for and Obstacles in Aesthetic\nExperience of Hindustani Raga-Sangita\nAs stated above, rasa experience through Hindustani Raga-\nSangita, as is the case for other genres, styles, and forms of\nmusic in the world, builds on and arises from the chemistry\nof the different bhava-s, or emotions and moods, both per-\nmanent and transitory, as projected by an able performer\nfrom his or her inner core with a blend of his or her musical\nknowledge, skills, understanding, and judgment. When the\nconnoisseur listens to such a soul-lifting music, through\ncomplete absorption in the art-form (tanmayi bhavana) and\nthe automatic process of universalization (sadharanikarana),\naesthetic relish (rasawada) takes place, the beautiful is\nevoked (rasanishpatti), and delight (ananda) is experienced.\nSuch an experience has been compared with the bliss of self-\nrealization, which is transcendental and supra-mundane in\nnature. It can be experienced or relished by someone who is\nsensitive to beauty, thus simply not given to everyone. In\nfact, aesthetic experience is the enjoyment of \"one's (own)\nbeing, as an intrinsic, indivisible aspect of one's (higher)\nIn real life, objects are considered as either pleasant or\npainful or neutral depending on how and for what purpose\nand utility an individual or percipient relates to these objects.\nIn aesthetic experience, as the percipient is free from all indi-\nvidual personal attachment, purpose, or utility, the aesthetic\nobject is experienced by the de-individualized or imperson-\nalized self as bliss. Such bliss is nothing but the very essence\nof the self in the state of \"de-individualization,\" free from the\nshackles of the ego-sense. As stated above, rasa is mani-\nfested in the percipient because of his or her capacity for\nuniversalization which is, however, temporary in nature.\nHence, though such an experience is unique, transcending\n(alaukika), different from mundane ones (lokottara), and is\nsimilar to spiritual experience, that is, the experience of\nMoksha (liberation from the cycles of births and deaths, as\nunderstood in Indian philosophy), rasa experience is tran-\nsient and short-lived and endures as long as the stimuli com-\ning from the art-form are present.\nAbhinavagupta, while commenting on the Natyashastra\nin his Abhinavabharati, makes reference to seven sadhaka-s\nor positive factors which are conducive to aesthetic experi-\nence of the highest kind. These are (a) inborn capacity to\nenjoy and appreciate works of art (Rasikta), (b) theoretical\nand practical knowledge of and insight and sensitivity toward\nthe work of art being experienced (Sahrdaya), (c) extraordi-\nnary imaginative power to fill the gap and make sense of that\naspect of the work of art which is not perceptible (Pratibha),\n(d) inner predisposition (inherent and acquired) to appreciate\nworks of art (Vasana Samskara), (e) capacity for rumination,\ncapacity for recollecting parts, and contemplating these as a\nwhole (Bhavana-Charvana), (f) physically and mentally fit\nto enjoy works of art (Sharirika and Manasika Yogyata), and\n(g) capacity to lose one's limited self and identifying com-\npletely with the work of art (Tadatmya). Deficit of any of\nthese prerequisites will, at best, lead to a \"surface satisfac-\ntion\" of the aesthetic object (Saxena, 1996). At the bottom\nline, one who can experience bliss through music or any\nother art-forms is a connoisseur (sahrdaya or rasika), for he\nor she can get himself or herself in a state of consciousness\ndevoid of individual particularities and conditions, in short,\nthe ego-sense.\nBe that as it may, there are certainly several important\nobstacles on the path leading to aesthetic experience in Raga-\nSangita.Abhinavagupta also mentions seven such obstacles or\nvigna-s or badhak-s in the context of experiencing a drama or\npoem as follows: (a) improbability (Sambhavanaviraharupa--\npratipattavayogyata), (b) intrusion of space\u00adtime particularity\n(Svagataparagatatvaniyamena des'akaladivis'esavesah), (c)\nhelplessness of personal mood (Nijasukhadivivas'ibhavah),\n(d) lack of means of apprehension (Pratityapayavaikalyam),\n(e) lack of clarity (Sphutatvabhavah), (f) lack of emphasis on\nthe principal element (Apradhanata), and (g) doubt\n(Sams'ayayogah).\nHence, based on the above-mentioned prerequisites for\nand obstacles to rasanubhava, as discussed by Bharat Muni\nand Abhinavagupta, and the long-standing experience and\nobservation of the author spanning over 43 years as well as\nthe views of other musicians (Pt. Ritwik Sanyal, Pt.\nVidyadhar Vyas, Prof. Chittaranjan Jyotishi, Late Dr. Pradeep\nKumar Dikshit) and musicologists (Gautam, 1980; Saxena,\nteachers, researchers, thinkers, and performers, the following\ncould be submitted as the main hindrances to aesthetic expe-\nrience in Hindustani Raga-Sangita:\na. Lack of proper understanding and grasping of the ba-\nsics of Hindustani Raga-Sangita;\nb. Faulty use of the voice and its placement, production,\nintonation, and modulation, in the case of vocal music,\nand faulty handling of the sound production of musi-\ncal instruments, in the case of instrumental music;\nc. Unrestrained and improper use of the elements of mu-\nsic, namely, shruti-s, swara-s, ornamentations, embel-\nlishments, and expression of emotions;\nd.
