This literature indicates that the sociocul-\nturally constructed environment (composed of patterns of mean-\nings,practices and products) provides blueprints for what it is that\npeople are expected to do in their life and how they are expected\nto do so. We therefore expect that there are multiple sociocultur-\nally distinct pathways to wellbeing. Two such pathways have been\ncharacterized as independent and interdependent (Kitayama and\nhypothesis, the present work investigated the cultural patterning\nof independence and interdependence in Japan and the US, and\nfurther probed the links of these cultural blueprints to reported\nwellbeing and health.\nMarkus, Kitayama, and colleagues have suggested that differ-\nent cultural contexts value, sanction, and foster independence and\ninterdependence to varying degrees in organizing social practices\n(e.g.,scripted patterns of social interaction),institutions (e.g.,sys-\ntems of employment and promotion), and public meanings (e.g.,\nicons and symbols) in many different domains of life (Kitayama\ning themselves to the structured set of cultural practices and\nmeanings, individuals develop correspondingly different modes\nof engaging in a variety of actions \u00ad both personal (e.g., express-\ning the self) and interpersonal (e.g., relating to others and being\nfriends with them). According to this analysis, the constructs of\nindependence and interdependence refer to culturally divergent\nsystems of action or modes of being. Specifically, the independent\nmode of being (which is fostered in American cultural contexts)\nemphasizes pursuit of personal goals and an attendant sense of the\nKitayama et al. Independence, interdependence, health, and wellbeing\nAmericans are strongly motivated toward personal control and,\nthus, independence in general (our first hypothesis), they would\nalso be expected to achieve wellbeing and health through the path-\nway of independence, that is, that of maintaining and enhancing\npersonalcontrol.Althoughimportant,promotionof relationalhar-\nmony or avoidance of relational strain is considered to be more\ndiscretionary. In fact, such relational goals are often secondary,\nparticularly when they are in direct conflict with the personal goals\nof attaining the sense of control and mastery (Heckhausen and\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that a strong sense of per-\nsonal control is positively predictive of wellbeing and health in\nthe United States (e.g., Lachman and Weaver, 1998; Heckhausen\nand Schulz, 1999). In addition, the sense of personal control is\nlikely to yield a strong sense of self-worth or high self-esteem. A\nlarge number of studies have shown that self-esteem and, thus, an\nattendant tendency to self-enhance through social comparison are\nmajor predictors of wellbeing among Americans (e.g., Kwan et al.,\net al., 2008). Likewise, positive feelings based on personal success\nsuch as pride and feelings of superiority are highly associated with\nAdditionally, Oishi and Diener (2001) report that attaining per-\nsonal goals (e.g.,doing what one wants to do) leads to an enhanced\nwellbeing among European Americans.\nIncontrast,Asiansaremotivatedtowardrelationalharmonyand,\nthus, interdependence in general (our first hypothesis). Further,\nunlikeAmericans,wholinkhappinesstopersonalhappiness,Asians\nassociatehappinesswithrelationalharmony(UchidaandKitayama,\n2009).Wethereforeexpectedthattheywouldachievewellbeingand\nhealth through the interdependent pathway, that is, by promot-\ning relational harmony and/or avoiding relational strain (Morling\net al., 2002). Although important, attaining and maintaining the\nsense of personal control and mastery is not considered essential\nor primary. Indeed, especially when they are in direct conflict with\nrelational concerns and goals,they must be subordinated under the\never-important interdependent concerns and goals. Those failing\nto do so are often considered as immature and childish (Lebra,\nAs may be expected,wellbeing in Asian contexts is strongly pre-\ndicted by social relational factors such as social harmony (Kwan\nand Diener,2001),socially engaging emotions such as friendly feel-\nperceivedemotionalsupportfromcloseothers(Uchidaetal.,2008).\nThehypothesizedlinkof relationalharmonywithwellbeingamong\nAsians has also been suggested by the finding that attaining rela-\ntional goals (e.g., meeting expectations of significant others) is\nrelated closely to an enhanced wellbeing among Asian Americans\nand Japanese, but not among European Americans (Oishi and\nTo extend the above evidence on cross-cultural variation in\nwellbeing, the present work addressed three issues. First, currently\navailable cross-cultural evidence comes nearly exclusively from\nsamples of college students, which leaves open the applicability\nof the cultural psychological theories to wider populations. We\nthus tested age-heterogeneous samples of adults in both Japan and\nof being. As a measure of interdependence we used scales indexing\nrelational harmony with significant others such as family members\nand friends and a scale indexing relational strain with these others.\nCultural Motivations toward Independence and\nInterdependence\nThe first hypothesis states that Americans are strongly motivated\ntoward independence and Japanese are strongly motivated toward\ninterdependence.In testing it,we draw on the well-established prin-\nciplethatwhenpeoplearemotivatedtowardgivengoalstatesinclud-\ning independence from others or interdependence with others, the\nmotivationmaybeparticularlyevidentwhenthegoalisblocked.This\nprincipleisapplicabletoavarietyof domainsfromanimalbehaviors\nto human social motivations. In a well-conducted field experiment,\nfor example, Harris (1974) demonstrated that people in a waiting\nline are highly frustrated (often resulting in aggressive behaviors)\nwhen someone cuts into the line (thereby interfering with their goal\nattainment) and this was especially so when they were near the front\n(asopposedtotheend)of theline.Whenpeoplearenearthefrontof\nthe line the goal gradient is assumed to be quite steep and the drive\ntoward the goal is high (see Berkowitz, 1989, for a review).\nOnthebasisof thisliterature,onemightexpectthatpeopleshould\nfeel especially restrained and frustrated when the culturally sanc-\ntionedgoalsof eitherindependenceorinterdependenceareblocked.\nSo far,we know of no data that directly speak to this possibility even\nwithstandardcollegestudentsamples.Wethustestedwhetherpeople\nwouldinfactexperienceadegreeof restraintandfeelthatthey\"could\nnot do what they wanted to do\"when a key cultural motivation was\nblocked. We expected that Americans would feel most constrained\nwhentheirpursuitof personalcontrolwasblocked.Incontrast,they\nwould not feel particularly constrained when they failed to attain\nrelational harmony or to avoid relational strain.Given that the ideas\nand practices of interdependence are not as widely distributed in\nAmerican contexts as in Japanese contexts, many Americans would\nnotbeasstronglymotivatedtowardinterdependenceand,therefore,\nwould not feel thwarted as much as Japanese under such conditions\nof blocked interdependence. Conversely, we expected that Japanese\nwould experience a degree of constraint and feel that they \"could\nnot do what they wanted to do\" when their goals of promoting\nrelational harmony and/or avoiding relational strain were blocked.\nIn contrast, they would not feel particularly constrained when they\nwere\npreventedfromattainingpersonalcontrolormastery.Japanese\nwould not be strongly motivated toward independence and, as a\nconsequence, they would not be frustrated as much under such\n\nconditions of blocked independence.\nTo measure the sense of constraint that arises when one's impor-\ntant cultural goals and concerns are blocked and disrupted,we used\na scale designed to assess the degree to which people chronically\nexperience constraint (called the perceived constraint scale;Pearlin\ninclude \"I cannot do what I want to do\" and \"There is really no\nway I can solve the problems I have.\"\nCultural Pathways to Wellbeing\nWhereas our first hypothesis was focused on motivation toward\nindependence or interdependence,our second hypothesis was con-\ncerned with predictors of wellbeing and health. Because North\nKitayama et al. Independence, interdependence, health, and wellbeing\nMeasures\nThequestionnairesusedineachcountryincludedscalesdesignedto\nmeasure(1)independence,(2)interdependence,(3)perceivedcon-\nstraint, and (4) wellbeing and health. Independence was assessed\nwith scales of personal mastery (four items, Pearlin and Schooler,\nand Japanese, respectively) and domain-specific control (one item\neach, asking the amount of control perceived for each of seven\ndomains such as work, finance, and family;  = 0.70 and 0.67).\nInterdependence was assessed with scales designed to measure har-\nmonious or non-conflictual social relations including (1) relational\nrelational strain with family members (four items;  = 0.80 and\nperceived constraint was measured with an 8-item scale developed\nTo assess wellbeing and health,four separate categories of meas-\nures were employed:judgments of life satisfaction,hedonic wellbe-\ning, eudaimonic wellbeing, and physical health. Life satisfaction\nwas assessed with four items measuring satisfaction in different\ndomains; = 61 and 67);whereas hedonic wellbeing was measured\nwith affect balance computed by subtracting an average score of 6\nnegative affect ratings from that of 6 positive affect ratings;Mrozek\n = 0.91 and 0.94). Eudaimonic wellbeing was measured by com-\nputing the average of the scale scores for four of six dimensions of\npsychological wellbeing (PWB, Ryff and Keyes, 1995; self-accept-\nance,purposeinlife,personalgrowth,andautonomy).Theremain-\ning two PWB dimensions (environmental mastery and positive\nrelation with others) were excluded because of conceptual overlap\nwith the independence and interdependence predictor variables.\nFinally,indices of physical health included: (1) subjective health (1\nitem), (2) number of chronic health problems (maximum of 29;\nreverse-coded, e.g., diabetes), (3) frequency of somatic symptoms\n(maximum of 11; reverse-coded,e.g.,headaches),and (4) sensitiv-\nity to unpleasant sensations (called somatic amplification,5 items,\ncomponent factor analysis performed on these health measures\nshowed a robust single factor solution in both cultures. All factor\nloadings were substantial (>0.60).The factor score was used as our\nmeasure of health.\nWe used gender and age as control variables as well as the five\npersonality trait scores of agreeableness (assessed with five trait\n(five adjectives;  = 0.78 and 0.82), neuroticism (four adjectives;\n0.39), and openness to experience (seven adjectives;  = 0.77 and\n0.82).All scales had reasonable reliabilities in both countries, with\nan exception of the Japanese  for conscientiousness (= 0.39).\nResults\nOuranalysisproceededinthreesteps.First,wedimensionalizedinde-\npendenceandinterdependence.Second,wetestedthefirstof ourtwo\nmajor hypotheses, namely, that whereas Americans are motivated\ntoward personal control and,more generally,toward independence,\nthe United States. This is the first effort we know of to extend the\n\ncurrent knowledge on cultural variation in self and wellbeing to\nsuch samples of age and socioeconomically diverse adults from\ndifferent countries.\nSecond, one important shortcoming of existing cross-cultural\nwork in this area is that nearly all studies focus exclusively on\npsychological measures of wellbeing, with scant attention paid to\nhealthoutcomes.Wefilledthisgapintheliteraturebyincorporating\nreports of physical health and somatic symptoms.Furthermore,we\nbroadened the assessment of wellbeing to include not only general\nevaluative judgments of wellbeing (e.g.,life satisfaction;Kwan et al.,\nbeing, which involves assessments of purpose and meaning in life,\npersonal growth, and self-acceptance (Ryff and Keyes, 1995).\nThird,although wellbeing and health have been frequently pre-\ndicted by individual difference variables, such as personality traits\nattainment (Lachman and Weaver, 1998), contemporary work on\nculture and wellbeing rarely includes these variables in analytic\ndesigns, leaving open the possibility that observed cultural varia-\ntions might be confounded by cultural differences in personality\nprofiles (McCrae et al.,1998) and educational attainment.We thus\ncontrolled for both self-assessed traits and educational attainment\nin tests of the above relationships so as to sharpen the focus on the\nconstructs of independence and interdependence as predictors of\nwellbeing and health.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and Procedure\nWe recruited a convenience sample of 482 adult Japanese in midlife\nboth in Tokyo (the capital and the largest metropolitan area in\nJapan) and Sapporo (a regional center of a Northern island of\nJapan \u00ad Hokkaido). In Tokyo participants were recruited through\nadult education classes offered by the pertinent municipalities,\nwhereas in Sapporo they were recruited through college students,\nwho requested their adult family members (mostly parents and\ngrandparents but in some cases older siblings) to fill out the ques-\ntionnaire.All participants completed a self-administered question-\nnaireathomeandreturneditafteraweek.Whilenotrepresentative,\nthe Japanese sample covers a wide age range and varied educational\nattainment levels, and importantly, was not based on college stu-\ndents, the most common group sampled in the current literature.\nData from this Japanese sample was compared with the national\nsurvey of Midlife Development in the US (MIDUS), which is\nrandom-digit dialing procedures and then participated in a tele-\nphone interview, followed by the completion of self-administered\nquestionnaires, which were returned by mail. Whereas 29.6% of\nAmericans had a college degree or higher, 32.8% of Japanese had\ncomparable levels of educational attainment.The percent of people\nwho were married was far greater in Japan than in the US (92% vs.\n64%).Allscales,originallydevelopedinEnglish,weretranslatedinto\nJapanese.Back-translationwasusedtoachieveequivalentmeanings\nin the two languages. The Japanese version was used in Japan.\nKitayama et al. Independence, interdependence, health, and wellbeing\nit, while Americans would feel constrained when they were\n\nprevented from attaining what they were habitually aiming at,\nnamely, a strong sense of personal control, efficacy, mastery, and\nself-esteem. We used a step-wise regression to predict the per-\nceived constraint score as a function of personal control,relational\nharmony, and relational strain. In the first step in the regression,\nfour demographic variables (gender,age,culture,and educational\nattainment [college degree or higher vs. some college or lower)\nwere entered.In the second step we entered five personality traits.\nThird, we entered the three variables pertaining to independ-\nence (personal control) and interdependence (relational harmony\nand relational strain). In the last step, three interaction terms\nbetween the independence/interdependence variables and culture\nwere entered.\nAs can be seen in Table 2, each step accounted for a significant\namount of variance. Regarding the control variables, women were\nmore likely than men to experience constraint and perceived con-\nstraint also tended to increase as a function of age while decreas-\ning with educational attainment. Perceived constraint also tended\nto be higher for Japanese than for Americans. Both agreeableness\nand neuroticism were positively associated with perceived con-\nstraint, while conscientiousness and openness to experience were\nnegatively associated with perceived constraint. Higher levels of\neducational attainment were associated with a reduced sense of\nconstraint. Interestingly, however, this effect was observed only\nJapanese, the effect was no different from zero,  = 0.03, t < 1.\nThe interaction between culture and educational attainment was\nMost importantly,and beyond the effects of these control vari-\nables, the variables related to the cultural mandates of independ-\nence and interdependence had systematic effects on perceived\nconstraint and, moreover, these effects were often moderated\nby culture.\nJapanesearemotivatedtowardrelationalharmonyand,moregener-\nally,toward interdependence.Third,we examined the second major\nhypothesis,whichholdsthatindividualsachievewellbeingandhealth\nthrough living up to the major mandates of their own cultures.\nDimensionalizing Independence and Interdependence\nWe operationalized independence in terms of personal control\n(personal mastery and domain-specific control) and interdepend-\nence in terms of social harmony (the presence of positive responses\nfrom family members and friends and the absence of negative\nresponses from family members and friends). We first performed\na principal components factor analysis on the eight relevant scales\nwithin each country.\nIn both the US and Japan,a three-factor structure was judged to\nbeoptimal.First,threefactorshadeigenvaluesof eithergreaterthan\n1 or, very close to 1. Second, in both cases, after varimax rotation,\nthe three-factor solution was clearly interpretable and conceptually\nidentical.We performed the same analysis on different segments of\ndata within each country. All these analyses replicated essentially\nthe same three-factor solution.\nThe American solution is summarized in the left-side panel of\nTable1.The three factors were clearly interpretable as (1)\"relational\nstrain\"(negative family relations, and negative friend relations), (2)\n\"relational harmony\" (positive family relations and positive friend\nrelations), and (3) \"personal control\" (defined in terms of personal\nmastery, and domain-specific control). The control factor corre-\nspondedtoouroperationaldefinitionof independence,whereasthe\nremaining two factors corresponded to our operational definition\nof interdependence. The Japanese solution is given in the right-side\npanel of Table 1. The three factors were clearly interpretable as (1)\nrelationalharmony,(2)relationalstrain,and(3)personalcontrol.For\neach participant, relevant scale means were averaged to yield scores\nfor personal control, relational harmony, and relational strain.\nMotivationtowardPersonalControlandRelationalHarmony\nIf the Japanese were truly motivated toward relational harmony,\nthey would experience a sense of constraint (e.g., \"I cannot do\nwhat I want to do\") when they were blocked from \nattaining\nTable 1 | Factor analysis performed on two variables assumed to\nmeasure independence and four variables assumed to measure\ninterdependence.

Independence, interdependence, health, and wellbeing\nassociatedwithrelationalstrain.InboththeUSandJapan,relational\nharmonywasreliablyassociatedwith(theabsence)of perceivedcon-\np < 0.001, respectively, but the effect of relational harmony was\nsomewhat stronger for Japanese than for Americans although the\ndifferencewasstatisticallytrivial(seeTable2).Incontrast,theinter-\naction with culture was highly significant for relational strain. The\neffect of relational strain was \npositive both in the US and in Japan,\nrespectively.As predicted,it was significantly stronger in Japan than\nin the US. This pattern supports the hypothesis that Japanese are,\nin fact, more strongly motivated than Americans toward relational\nharmony and, thus, toward independence in general.\nIt is curious that the strong relational motivation for Japanese\nwas especially evident for the measure of relational strain,suggest-\ning that it is the failure of avoiding relational strain that creates\nthe sense of constraint among Japanese. In contrast, the effect of\nrelational harmony was comparatively weak. This converges with\nprior work that demonstrates a greater prevention (rather than\npromotion) orientation for Asians than for European Americans\n(Elliot et al., 2006). The finding is also consistent with the notion\nthat Japanese seek to self-improve by setting their standards high\nandavoidingproblemsandshortcomingsrelativetosuchstandards\n(Heine et al., 2001). The corresponding evidence for Americans\nwas much weaker.\nPredictors of Wellbeing and Health\nThe second major hypothesis of the current work is related to the\nfirst.BecauseAmericansarestronglymotivatedtowardindependence,\nattaining independence is likely to be highly self-affirming for them,\nMotivation toward personal control\nThe effect of personal control was negative in both cultures, with\npersonal control associated with a lesser degree of perceived con-\nstraint.As predicted,the culture \u00d7 personal control interaction was\nhighly significant. See the right panel of Figure 1, which depicted\ntheexpectedamountof perceivedconstraintforthosewithpersonal\ncontrol scores that are either 1 SD above or 1 SD below the mean\nwithin each culture (=0)1.The effect of personal control was highly\nsignificant in the US,  = -0.37, t\nis substantially stronger than the one in Japan. In fact the corre-\nsponding effect in Japan was only marginally significant, = -0.09,\nt\n= 1.83, p < 0.07. This pattern lends support to the hypothesis\nthatAmericansarestronglymotivatedtowardpersonalcontroland,\nthus,toward independence in general.The corresponding evidence\nfor Japanese was weak at best.\nMotivation toward relational harmony and strain\nThe effects of relational harmony and relational strain on perceived\nconstraint are illustrated in the center panel and the left panel of\nFigure 1, respectively. As expected, perceived constraint was nega-\ntively associated with relational harmony whereas it was positively\nFigure 1 | Effects of personal control, relational harmony, and relational strain on perceived constraint in Japan and the United States. Estimated means\nfor perceived constraints are plotted at 1 SD lower or higher than the mean level of each of the three independent variables within each culture.\n1All three predictor variables (personal control, relational harmony, and relational\nstrain) had lower means in Japan than in the US. As a consequence, adjusted means\nthat control for the cultural differences in the mean levels in these variables become\nhighly misleading in that the perceived constraint of Japanese would look unreali-\nstically low and the perceived constraint for Americans would look unrealistically\nhigh. To avoid this misleading impression, the x-axis in Figure 1 is centered around\nthe mean of the pertinent predictor variable within each culture. In this way, the fi-\ngure accurately represents both the culturally variable levels of perceived constraint\nand the slope within each culture as a function of each of the three predictor varia-\nbles. This caveat also applies to Figure 2.\nKitayama et al. Independence, interdependence, health, and wellbeing\nwent up. Importantly, however, these effects were moderated\nby location especially for personal control and relational strain.\nAs can be seen in Table 3, both the interaction between culture\nand relational strain and the interaction between culture and\npersonal control were all in the predicted directions and, often,\nstatistically significant.\nBecause the pattern of the data was highly similar across the four\nmeasures of wellbeing and health, we created a single summary\nindex of wellbeing and health. We performed a principal compo-\nnent analysis on the four measures of wellbeing and health,yielding\na single factor solution. In both cultures, a one-factor solution was\noptimal.Thecorrespondingfactorscorewascomputedonthebasis\nof another principal component analysis performed on the entire\nsample and then submitted to another step-wise regression with\nthe same set of predictor variables.\nThe effect of personal control is illustrated in the left panel of\nFigure 2.There was a strong positive association between personal\ncontrol and the wellbeing and health composite in both the US and\np < 0.001,respectively.Importantly,however,the culture \u00d7 personal\ncontrolinteractionwassignificant,=-0.048,t\nAs predicted,the positive association between personal control and\nthe wellbeing and health composite was significantly stronger for\nAmericans than for Japanese.\nThe effect of relational harmony is illustrated in the center panel\nof Figure 2.

We reasoned that such motivational orienta-\ntions would manifest themselves most when they were blocked.\nAs predicted, Americans reported that they \"could not do what\nthey wanted,\" thus, showing a sense of constraint in their lives\nespecially when they were low in personal control. In contrast,\nJapanese reported that they \"could not do what they wanted,\"\nthus showing feelings of constraint especially when they were\nhigh in relational strain.\nWe then demonstrated culturally divergent effects of both\n\ncontrol and relational harmony/strain on wellbeing and health.\nSpecifically, control proved to be reliably more significant predic-\ntor of the wellbeing and health composite among Americans than\namong Japanese.This finding is consistent with several recent find-\nings that demonstrate the significance of self-esteem in predicting\nwellbeing in individualistic cultures such as the US (Kwan et al.,\nings lend strong support to the hypothesis that control and associ-\natedsenseof theself asefficaciousandesteemedisacentralelement\nof independence that is particularly privileged and emphasized in\nNorthAmerica.In contrast,in Japan it was the absence of relational\nstrainthatmostpowerfullypredictedthesummaryindexof wellbe-\ning and health.

We believe that this is an\nThe effect of relational strain is illustrated in the right panel of\nFigure2.Overall,there was a strongly negative association between\nrelational strain and the wellbeing and health composite both in\nt\nand health. Yet, as predicted, the interaction between culture and\nrelational strain was highly significant,  = -0.094, t\np < 0.0001. Relative to the US data, the Japanese data showed a\nstronger effect of relational strain2.\nDiscussion\nCultural Variation in Pathways to Wellbeing and Health\nPrevious research, conducted mostly in North America, has shown\nthat both personal control and mastery strongly predict wellbeing\nand health (e.g., Lachman and Weaver, 1998; Schneiderman et al.,\n2001).Using age-diverse community samples from both the United\nStatesandJapan,thepresentworkdemonstratedthatthisconclusion\nis contingent on culture. Obviously, biology is important in health.\nHowever,our work has begun to show that culture-specific psycho-\nlogicalvariablessuchaspersonalcontrolandrelationalharmonyor\nstrain have substantial impacts on various health outcomes.\nWe started with the hypothesis that whereas the independent\nmode of being is constituted by an active motivational orien-\ntation toward control and mastery, the interdependent mode\nof being involves a strong motivational orientation toward\nFigure 2 | Effects of personal control, relational harmony, and relational strain on the composite index of wellbeing and health in Japan and the United States.\nEstimated means for the wellbeing composite are plotted at 1 SD lower or higher than the mean level of each of the three independent variables within each culture.\n2It is important to note that the same conclusions were obtained when perceived con-\nstraint was entered and thus statistically controlled for in the regressions. This means\nthat the effects reported here were found above and beyond those attributable to the ex-\nperience of constraint that arises when people fail to live up to the cultural mandates.\nKitayama et al. Independence, interdependence, health, and wellbeing\nThis subsidiary evidence suggests that it is misleading to con-\nclude from our results that relational factors are unimportant\namong Americans. To the contrary, they can be very important\nin sustaining their sense of control, autonomy, and independ-\nence. Thus, the relational factors are likely to have significant\ninfluences on health and wellbeing, but this influence is likely\nto be mediated by affirmation of the independence of the self.\nHere, there is a very different dynamic among Japanese. Our\nresults show that the relational factors (enhanced harmony and\nreduced strain) can directly affirm the sense of interdependence\nand, thus, improve health and wellbeing directly without any\nmediation by independence-related factors such as control and\nFacets of Independence and interdependence\nOur decision to focus on personal control and relational harmony\nto index independence and interdependence respectively was prag-\nmatic. The American data had been collected independent of and\nprior to the current work. Necessarily we needed to do our best\nwithin the confines of scales included in the original American\nstudy. Quite fortunately, however, personal control and relational\nharmony are likely to be two central elements of the respective\nmodes of being and, moreover, past work suggested that these are\ntwo aspects that are likely related directly to some of mental and\nphysical health outcome variables (Diener et al., 1999; Kitayama\nFurther, in their meta-analyses of scales measuring independ-\nence and interdependence, Oyserman et al. (2002) pointed out\nthat the existing scales of independence cover (1) valuing personal\nindependence, (2) personal achievement, (3) self-knowledge, (4)\nuniqueness, (5) privacy, (6) clear communication, and (7) com-\npetition to capture independence. Personal control, as assessed\nherein, requires an attitude toward independence, a strong pro-\npensity toward achievement and competition, and clear self-\nknowledge. It seems therefore to tap some of the facets covered\nin the literature, although aspects such as privacy and clear com-\nmunication were not addressed. Likewise, Oyserman and col-\nleagues observed that the existing scales of interdependence cover\nseveral faces including (1) sense of duty to group, (2) relatedness\nto others, (3) seeking others' advice, (4) harmony, (5) working\nin groups, (6) sense of belonging to a group, (7) contextual self,\nand (8) valuing hierarchy. Many of these facets are closely linked\nto both relational harmony and relational strain, as assessed in\nthe present investigation.\nFuture work should examine whether the index of cultural\norientation suggested here would converge with other indicators\nof independence and interdependence (Hofstede, 1980; Schwartz,\nUniversality and Culture-Specificity of Personal Control\nThe current data presents an interesting test case for discerning\ncultural universals (Norenzayan and Heine,2005).From our factor\nanalysis (Table 1), it is clear that the control factor as constituted\nby personal mastery and domain-specific control is common in\nthe two cultures. To the extent that control is experienced in terms\nof these two relevant elements and these elements only, then con-\ntrol may be reasonably said to be cross-culturally common and,\nimportant analytic step as it shows that the cultural differences we\nfound cannot be reduced to cultural variations in these individual\ndifference variables.\nExtrapolatingfromthecurrent findings,onemightpropose that\nany mismatch between prevailing cultural expectations or norms\nand one's psychological propensities might compromise health and\nwellbeing.This general hypothesis may help push the field forward\nbeyond the constructs of independence and interdependence. For\nexample, in a cultural group where honor is a significant virtue,\none may be especially unhappy and unsatisfied if his or her honor\nis compromised.Further,such a person may be at risk for impaired\nhealth, physical or mental. The same idea potentially applies to\nother cultural norms, such as achievement ethics, egalitarianism,\nreligious purity, and political liberalism or conservatism. These\npossibilities constitute rich future directions.\nAre Relational Factors Really Unimportant in\nIndependent Culture?\nThe present data revealed that forAmericans the effects of relational\nharmony or relational strain on wellbeing and health are relatively\nsmall although they were still statistically significant. This observa-\ntionmightseematoddswiththeemergingliterature,theoreticaland\nempirical,suggestingthefundamentalsignificanceof socialrelations\ninhealthandwellbeing.Forexample,multiplelarge-scaleepidemio-\nlogical studies have demonstrated a sizable longitudinal benefit of\navailabilityof socialrelationsonavarietyof healthandwellbeingout-\nWe suspect that our findings showing relatively weak effects of\nrelational harmony or relational strain on wellbeing and health\namong Americans are, in part, due to the fact that we looked at\nthese effects after controlling for personal control. As proposed\nby Uchida et al. (2008), in independent cultural contexts, sup-\nportive others may be crucially important to help maintain the\never-important sense of personal control and efficacy, which, in\nturn, likely enhances health and wellbeing. This implies that the\neffects of relational harmony and strain on wellbeing are likely\nmediated by personal control. Indeed, when personal control\nwas regressed on relational harmony and relational strain, the\npertinent regression coefficients for relational harmony were\nhighly significant for both Americans and Japanese,  = 0.33,\nt\nfor Americans and Japanese, respectively. As expected, however,\nthe American coefficient was significantly greater in magnitude\nthan its Japanese counterpart,  = 0.060, t\nIn the US, relational harmony had a highly reliable effect on the\nwellbeing and health composite, = 0.17,t\nbut once personal control was entered, the effect of relational har-\nmony was significantly reduced to = 0.10,t\nThe mediation by personal control was highly significant, Sobel\non the wellbeing and health composite was reduced from  = 0.20,\nt\nsame mediation appears much weaker although still statistically\nsignificant, Sobel test = 2.26, p < 0.05. Relational strain showed\nno such cross-cultural difference, showing a marginally negative\neffect on personal control when the countries were combined,\nKitayama et al.

For example, pursuit of personal goals\nand adjustment to others' needs and expectations might define\nanother significant facet of independence and interdependence,\nrespectively. Similar refinement and expansion are needed in the\nmeasurement of health outcomes.
