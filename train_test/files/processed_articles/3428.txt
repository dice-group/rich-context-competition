To decide what is a preventable\nadverse event is no easy task. Substandard care may\nnot necessarily result in patient harm, and serious\noutcome may happen in spite of adequate intervention.\nDoctors are socialized to strive for error free practice,\nand a medical mistake that leads to patient harm has\noften been regarded not only as a sign of professional\nfailure, but also as a failure of character in the respon-\nsible physician, with subsequent feelings of guilt and\nshame.1\u00ad3 Insufficient organizational support and sup-\nport from colleagues after such events are frequently\ndescribed, possibly augmenting the feeling of guilt\nand shame.4 Defensive medical practice and a tendency\nto conceal adverse events may result.5,6 Openness about\nsuch events, including disclosure to patients and next of\nkin, should be part of the safety culture.7,8 Thus, work\nto improve the medical establishment's ability to deal\nwith unwanted patient outcomes in an open way and to\ninclude support to all involved parties after an adverse\nevent may be seen as one way of strengthening patient\nrights in health care.\nA Norwegian study from 2000 revealed that many\ndoctors working within the surgical disciplines, includ-\ning anaesthesiology and gynaecology/obstetrics, had\nbeen involved in adverse events with serious patient\ninjury. However, only 37% of the incidents were\nreported to the health authorities, which is obligatory,\nand only 68% informed the patient's family after the\nincidence.9 One out of five doctors did not experience\nany support from colleagues after the incident. Several\nof the doctors in this study reported that the incident\nhad influenced their private life and had made it more\ndifficult to work as a doctor afterwards.\n1Institute for Health and Society, University of Oslo, Norway\n2Institute for Studies of the Medical Profession, Norway\nCorresponding author:\nReidun F\u00f8rde, Institute for Health and Society, University of Oslo, POB\nEmail: Reidun.forde@medisin.uio.no\nClinical Ethics\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/cet\nA shift in policy\nSince 2000, the medical community has gradually\nseen medical mistakes more as system errors than\nindividual incompetence. This change may hopefully\nlead to increased willingness to report the adverse\nevent,10,11 to improved routines to meeting the\npatient and next of kin after the event and to\nbetter routines to support the responsible health\ncare personnel after the event.12\nIn Norway, several initiatives towards increased\nopenness after adverse events in medical practice have\ntaken place. At the University of Oslo, medical students\nare offered a 2-day course towards the end of their\nstudies to increase their knowledge of how adverse\nevents should be met, professionally, legally and ethic-\nally. A new section in The Health Directorate has been\ncreated where anonymized descriptions of serious\nevents that have led to, or could have led to, serious\npatient harm are reported and processed.13 In addition,\nhealth care personnel must, according to the Specialist\nCare Act \u00a7 3-3a, report every incident with serious\npatient injury to The Norwegian Board of Health\nSupervision and to notify patients in cases of unex-\npected negative or unwanted outcome of health care\nThe complaint system\nWhen the outcome of a medical intervention is subopti-\nmal or when patient expectations are not met, the\nresponsible health care personnel may experience a\ncomplaint put forward to the health authorities. In\nNorway, filing complaints is now formalized in The\nPatient- and Users Right law \u00a77-4.15 The health autho-\nrities receive complaints on health care personnel\nthrough two channels. Less serious complaints are\nfiled to the County Governor (Fylkesmannen), who\nmay give guidance or propose deliberations between\nthe parties. More serious cases are referred to The\nNorwegian Board of Health Supervision who processes\nthe complaints with one of three possible outcomes:\nrejection of the complaint, issuing a warning to the\nhealth care personnel or suspending the authorization\nfor a number of years, or permanently. Thus the doc-\ntors who experience a reaction have all been involved in\nmore serious events. Even if Norway, since 1988, has\nhad a no blame compensation system after patient\ninjury,16 a complaint is normally perceived as deeply\ndisturbing for doctors.17\nWith increased emphasis on patient rights, it is likely\nthat the number of doctors experiencing a complaint\nwill increase, and with this follows hopefully a need\nfor health care personnel to regard complaints as\n(albeit unwanted) part of professional life and thus\nexperiencing them as less devastating.\nThe aim of the present study was to explore the\nchange over time in doctors' coping with serious patient\nharm, and to study how doctors react to and cope with\ncomplaints to the health authorities.\nMethods\nSince 1992, The Norwegian Medical Association, orga-\nnising more than 90% of all doctors practising in\nNorway, has sponsored its own research institute with\nthe main objective to study the health and behaviour of\ndoctors. See www.legeforsk.org for an overview of the\npublications. An important element of this effort has\nbeen to follow a representative panel of approximately\n1700 doctors with postal questionnaires. The panel is\nunbalanced, meaning that new young doctors are regu-\nlarly added and retired or deceased doctors are\nremoved.\nSpecialist categories\nThere are 45 medical specialties and subspecialties in\nNorway, and for the purpose of optimal statistical ana-\nlyses, the specialties are grouped into larger logical enti-\nties. In this study, we use the following seven categories:\nfamily medicine/general practice, laboratory/service\nspecialties, internal medicine specialties (including\noncologists), surgical specialties, anaesthesiology and\nintensive care, psychiatry and community medicine/\npublic health. Specialists in training are categorized\naccording to their future specialty.\nQuestions\nIn November 2012, a postal questionnaire was sent to\nthe 1792 panel members, with three reminders. The\nquestionnaire covered several broad topics such as\nknowledge of and attitudes towards guidelines, priority\nsetting issues and end of life dilemmas.\nThis article is based on the response to questions on\nadverse events and their consequences, which are simi-\nlar to the questions posed in the survey of 2000: `Have\nyou experienced serious patient injury in connection\nwith medical treatment you have given?' response alter-\nnatives: never, a few times/several times/not applicable.\nThe question was followed by eight questions about\npotential consequences on the part of the doctor (list\nis provided in Table 2), with response alternatives yes/\nno/uncertain.\nIn addition, we asked whether they had been\ninvolved in a complaint to the health authorities, fol-\nlowed by a question about The Board's conclusion, and\n11 possible consequences of this, including an evalu-\nation of whether they regarded the Board's reaction\nas fair and reasonable (Table 3).\nStatistical analyses\nResponses are reported as frequencies across three\ngroup variables: gender (female and male), age (30\u00ad\n49, 50\u00fe) and specialty (general practice, laboratory/ser-\nvice, anaesthesiology/intensive care, internal, surgical,\npsychiatry and public health). Where appropriate, the\nobservation of possible overlap between 95% confi-\ndence intervals are used to identify statistically signifi-\ncant differences between groups.\nEthics.

Sixty-two percent reported\nthat they had become more thorough with their docu-\nmentation, and 44% reported that the complaint had\nresulted in their giving better information to patients/\nnext of kin. Among negative effects were loss of trust in\npatients/next of kin and negative influence on the doc-\ntor's private life. Seventeen percent reported that the\nTable 1.

Brief\nanswers and fixed response categories seldom capture\nthe nuances of complex experiences and emotions. We\nasked whether the doctors had ever been involved in\nincidents of serious patient injury. The answer is subject\nto recall bias.\nBecause we wanted to explore how doctors react\nwhen they are involved in interventions that end up\nwith serious patient injury, we have not included ques-\ntions about the cause of injury, whether it was a result of\nan explicit error or just a result of a complicated and\nrisky intervention. It is likely that a negative outcome\nwhich is caused by obvious errors may be the most dif-\nficult to deal with for the responsible physician.\nAccordingly, they may need more guidance and support.\nOne strength of the study is that we can compare the\nin the reporting of patient injury and in how incidents\nwere experienced and followed up. We were also able to\nfind how a complaint to the health authorities may have\ninfluenced doctors, which was not possible with the\nbeen involved in serious patient injury. This may indi-\ncate more openness; but also that medical interventions\nare more complicated and risky, in spite of all attempts\nto increase patient safety. As in 2000, doctors in inter-\nvention intensive specialties like surgery and anaesthe-\nsiology are more often involved in serious patient harm.\nAs to the follow up of adverse events, we see a ten-\ndency towards more openness in that the incidents are\nmore often reported to the health authorities in line\nwith legal requirements. Also, the doctors experience\nmore support from colleagues after the event and less\nemotional stress with impact on private and profes-\nsional life. Since the numbers are small, the effects are\nnot statistically significant, but we still see a positive\ndevelopment in most of our items. In 16% of the inci-\ndents, the event was still not discussed at the workplace.\nThis is not satisfactory and underlines the need to con-\ntinued efforts to change attitudes in the medical culture\ntowards more openness regarding adverse events.\nHowever, it is encouraging that the younger doctors\nmore often report collegial support after an event,\nmore often discuss the event at the working place and\nTable 2.

This may indicate that a new generation of doctors\nis practicing better coping strategies after serious events.\nBeing reported to the health authorities\nOnly 36% of the doctors involved in patient harm have\nexperienced a complaint to the health authorities, com-\npared with 23% of the rest, which means that serious\npatient injury does not necessarily result in a complaint\nto the health authorities. This is in line with a study\nfrom New Zealand where only a minority of serious\nadverse events resulted in complaints.18 A Norwegian\nstudy found that only around 10% of patients who\nhave experienced an adverse event filed a complaint.18\nA study from the US found that even in adverse events\ncaused by negligence only a minority filed malpractice\nclaims.20 If the patient/next of kin are met with open-\nness and honest regret in an empathic way after the\nincident this may reduce the need to `punish' the\nIt is interesting to note that G.P.s/family practi-\ntioners and psychiatrists are overrepresented among\nthe doctors who experience complaints, perhaps indi-\ncating that many complaints are generated by problems\nwith communication and a suboptimal doctor \u00ad\npatient/next of kin relationship rather than serious\nsomatic injury. Also, G.P.s see more patients during a\nworking week than most other specialists. G.Ps are\noverrepresented in a New Zealand study of medical\ncomplaints as well.21 In Norway, the GP has a gate-\nkeeping role, and setting medically sound limits to\npatients' quests for tests and interventions may cause\nfrustration and possible complaints. Norwegian\npatients' reporting of adverse events tends to place\nthe responsibility for the event on their GP.19\nThe health authorities reject three out of four com-\nplaints. Still one in eight doctors report that the com-\nplaint has made it more difficult to work as a doctor\n(Table 3). We find it noteworthy, however, that 73% of\nthe doctors who did receive a reaction, typically a warn-\ning, found the authorities' decision reasonable. This\nmay be another indication of contemporary\nNorwegian doctors accepting patient complaints as\npart of their professional life. The same goes for\nhaving become more thorough with patient informa-\ntion, and in clinical work generally. A Norwegian\nstudy from 1993 indicated that having experienced\ncomplaints did not influence decision-making, while\nbeing threatened with reporting or negative exposure\nin the media did.21 More meticulous documentation\nmay be seen as a defensive, time consuming and\nstress-generating obligation rather than a sign of\nimproved patient safety. Thus, 17% also report that\nthey perform more tests and make more referrals\nafter the incident, and 11% report a less trusting rela-\ntionship to patients/next of kin. Kessler et al. found\ndefensive medicine as an effect of the medical liability\nsystems in Australia, UK and the USA.23 We have\nreason to believe that increased collegial support and\na scrutiny of what exactly happened may reduce these\nnegative effects of the complaint.12 Accordingly, not\nonly adverse events but also patient complaints\nshould be met with openness and collegial scrutiny,\nincluding ethical and relational considerations.16,24\nA recent report on serious events in the health and\ncare services stresses the importance of health personnel\nopening up for scrutiny of professional practice.24 Our\nfindings are consistent with these societal expectations.25\nConclusion\nIncreased openness towards health care that results in\npatient injury is important to meet patients and next of\nkin adequately. More doctors reported having been\ninvolved in adverse events with serious patient harm in\nto The Board of Health. Doctors below the age of 50\ndescribe better follow up of the incident at their workplace\ncompared with their older colleagues. Our study indicates\nthat efforts to improve follow up of intervention causing\nserious patient injury has given positive results.\nOnly a minority of the doctors having been involved\nin episodes with patient harm had experienced a com-\nplaint. General practitioners and psychiatrists were\noverrepresented among the doctors who had experi-\nenced a complaint. A majority of the doctors who\nhad received a formal reaction from the health autho-\nrities found the reaction reasonable.\nBeing involved in a patient complaint to the health\nauthorities may be emotionally stressful for doctors.\nMany complaints may be caused by suboptimal com-\nmunication and poor doctor\u00adpatient relationships. In\norder to learn and improve practice, it is important to\nscrutinize episodes of patient complaints and to offer\ncollegial support to the doctors involved.\nAuthors' contributions\nBoth authors have prepared the study, analysed the data and\nprepared the manuscript.
