Lipsitz\n Key Words: hypertension  disability  blood pressure  aged  Southeast\nMore than 50% of people 65 years of age in the United\nStates have limitation in 1 functional activity. Previ-\nous longitudinal studies have suggested that stroke is associ-\nated with increased risk for disability and loss of indepen-\ndence in older individuals.1\u00ad3 For example, in the\nFramingham Disability Study, stroke was the strongest pre-\ndictor of physical disability and explained 12% of the\nvariance over the follow-up period in men.4 The independent\nrelationship between blood pressure (BP) or hypertension and\ndisability risk in stroke-free individuals is not known. This is\nespecially important because 65% of older adults in the\nUnited States have hypertension.5 Furthermore, the Framing-\nham population is predominantly white, whereas African\nAmerican elderly individuals are more likely to report limi-\ntations in activities of daily living (ADL)6 and more likely to\nhave hypertension.5 Therefore, investigating the relationship\nbetween BP and disability in a well-represented biracial\npopulation fills an important gap in our knowledge. Finally,\nthe impact of BP on health takes a lengthy period of time.\nTherefore, it is important to consider BP years before indi-\nviduals start showing evidence of functional decline and\ndisability.\nControlling hypertension to 140/90 mm Hg is associated\nwith reduced cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity\nin older adults.7 Investigating the association between hyper-\ntension control status and disability has important clinical\nimplications, because there are concerns that lowering BP\nmay have a negative effect on function and quality of life in\nolder adults.8\nTherefore, the primary objective of this study was to\ninvestigate the association of BP and hypertension with the\nrate of functional decline and the risk of disability in an aging\nbiracial population. The second objective was to explore the\nrelation between hypertension control status and these dis-\nability domains.\nMethods\nSample\nA primary rationale for selecting the Charleston Heart Study was its\nadequate representation of African Americans. Also, we were\ninterested in a study that includes remote BP data before the\nfunctional measures. The Charleston Heart Study fits these criteria.\nParticipants were recruited from the community of greater Charles-\nton in 1960. For this analysis, we included data collected during 3\nFrom the Harvard Medical School (L.A.L., I.H.), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Hebrew SeniorLife, Boston, Mass; Medical University of\nSouth Carolina (D.T.L.), Charleston; and Boston University (L.A.C.), Mass.\nCorrespondence to Ihab Hajjar, Harvard Medical School, Institute for Aging Research/Hebrew SeniorLife, Division of Gerontology, Beth Israel\nDeaconess Medical Center, 1200 Centre St, Boston, MA 29206.

Stroke data\nwere collected using self-report. Of the 1040 participants evaluated\navailable for this analysis. Of these, 978 (98%) were evaluated in\nwere also excluded. In addition, BP and antihypertensive data 20\nyears before the 1984 wave were available on our selected sample.\nThe institutional review board at Hebrew SeniorLife approved this\nanalysis. All of the participants signed written consents.\nData Elements\nData collected included demographics, weight, height, and social\nelements (educational level, marital status, retirement status, access to\nhealth care, and alcohol and tobacco use). Self-reported comorbidity\ndata were collected by an interview questionnaire, and a medication\ninventory was also performed. Cognitive function was assessed using\nwave.9 Mood was assessed using the Centre for Epidemiological Studies\nTwo BP measurements were obtained using a mercury manometer\nat each visit by a trained observer. The observers underwent repeated\naudiometric examinations. The participant was in a seated position,\nand an appropriate size cuff was used. The cuff was placed at heart\nlevel, and each reading was rounded to the nearest 2 mm Hg.\nSystolic BP (SBP) was defined as the first Korotkoff sound (K1) and\ndiastolic (DBP) as the fifth Korotkoff sound (K5).11 For this analysis,\nwe used the mean of the 2 readings.\nBP Predictors\nOur main predictors were SBP and DBP, considered as continuous\nvariables. Because BP changed over the study period, as well as\nthe change in BP. We defined 2 BP variables, as follows. Concurrent BP\nchange is the variable reflected the change in SBP and DBP from the\nat the same time as the outcome measures. Remote BP change is the\nvariable that reflected the change in SBP and DBP from 1960 to the\nBecause some participants were receiving antihypertensive agents\nduring the period of BP measurement, these readings may not reflect\nthe participants' actual BP.12 To address this issue, we have used a\nmethod suggested by Cui et al12 and confirmed by Tobin et al13 of\nadding 10 mm Hg to SBP and 5 mm Hg to DBP in subjects receiving\nantihypertensive medications during each data collection visit for\nthe BP analysis only. Please see http://hyper.ahajournals.org for an\nexpanded Methods section and the Results section for the BP\nanalysis without the treatment correction (Table S2).\nHypertension Predictors\nWe also defined hypertension status and control status at baseline\nand the subject was not receiving antihypertensive medications or\nhypertensive if the mean BP was 140/90 mm Hg or if the subject\nwas receiving antihypertensive medications. We further assigned\nhypertensive individuals to 2 groups: controlled hypertensive if the\nmean BP was 140/90 mm Hg with treatment and uncontrolled\nTo study the association of hypertension status with disability, we\ncompared normotensive subjects with hypertensive subjects. To\nstudy the association between control status and disability, we\ncompared controlled and uncontrolled hypertensive subjects with\nnormotensive and uncontrolled to controlled hypertensive subjects.\nFunctional (Outcome) Measures\nMeasures of disability and daily function were collected in 1984\u00ad\nNagi's Congruency in Medical and Self Assessment of Disability,14\nthe Rosow-Breslaw Scale15 and Katz' ADL Scale.16 We considered\nthese measures of disability in this analysis in 2 ways: as continuous\nvariables to investigate the rate of change in functional abilities and\nas categorical variables to investigate the risk of developing new\ndisability (a participant is disabled if the participant reported limi-\ntation in performing 1 activity on the corresponding scale).\nStatistical Analysis\nBP Analysis\nWe used linear mixed-effects models (PROC Mixed) for correlated\ndata to investigate the association between SBP and DBP with\ndisability.17,18 This procedure is less sensitive to missing data, allows\nus to model the change in predictors and covariates during the\nfollow-up period, and calculates estimates of the functional measures\nat each visit adjusted for covariates.19 We first conducted univariate\nanalyses by investigating the association between concurrent BP\nchanges (independent variables) with functional measures as contin-\nuous variables (dependent variables). We then performed multivar-\niate analyses by developing a mixed model for each outcome\nmeasure. The modeling process is provided in the online supplemen-\ntal data. For these analyses, we present the rate of change in the\nspecific disability scale for each 10-mm Hg BP increase obtained\nfrom the final models.\nHypertension Analysis\nFor the comparison between hypertensive and normotensive subjects\nand the comparison of the normotensive, controlled hypertensive,\nand uncontrolled hypertensive subjects, we also used linear\nmixed-effects models. We also conducted univariate and multi-\nvariate analyses as in the BP analysis with hypertension status or\ncontrol status as the independent variables and the functional\nmeasures as the dependent variables included as continuous\nvariables. We present the results including P values and least mean\nsquares adjusted for the covariates from these models.\nRisk of Developing Disability Analysis\nProportional hazard models20 were used to study the association\nbetween hypertension status and control status with the risk of\ndeveloping disability. These models were developed using a step-\nwise model selection approach (forward/backward). For this analy-\nsis, the time variable was either the time to developing disability or\nthe time to censorship for the participants who were lost to follow-up\nor who died. Proportional hazard model assumptions were met.\nWe also calculated the cumulative incidence of disability for the\nfollow-up period excluding those with disability at baseline (1984\u00ad\n1985) and the fraction of disability in the study population attribut-\nable to hypertension by calculating the population attributable risk\npercentage. Attributable risk percentage is calculated by dividing\nthe attributable risk by the incidence of disability in the study\npopulation.\nCovariates and Subgroup Interaction Analyses\nFor all of the analyses, covariates considered for model selection\nincluded age, gender, race, educational level, body mass index,\nbaseline disability measures, alcohol, smoking status, and comorbid-\nity (coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, subsequent\nstroke, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and arthritis).\nFinally we tested for relevant interaction by age, gender, race, body\nmass index (BMI), and comorbidities. All of the analyses were\nconducted using SAS Software.\nResults\nSample\nThe mean ageSE of the sample (n999) at baseline was\nHajjar et al Hypertension and Disability 1027\nAmericans. Among these, 699 (70%) were hypertensive and\n413 (59%) of the hypertensive subjects were receiving\nantihypertensive medications. Only 146 (21%) were con-\ntrolled to 140/90 mm Hg. The control rates remained\nTable 1 describes baseline characteristics of our sample.\nHypertensive participants were older, more likely to be African\nAmericans, had higher BMI, reported fewer years of education,\nand had lower physical activity levels. Hypertensive subjects\nreported higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus and arthritis than\nnormotensive subjects. There were no differences in cardiovas-\ncular disease or cognitive function between hypertensive and\nhypertensive participants scored lower than normotensive par-\nticipants on the Nagi scale. There was no difference in the scores\non the Rosow-Breslaw and Katz ADL scales. We provide a\nsimilar comparison for the baseline characteristics among nor-\nmotensive subjects and controlled and uncontrolled hypertensive\nsubjects in Table S1.\nBP Analysis\nTable 2 describes the association between remote and con-\ncurrent BP change and the rate of functional measure change.\nGreater remote SBP increase was associated with greater\ndecline rates in all 3 of the functional measures. Similarly,\ngreater concurrent SBP increase was associated with greater\ndecline rates in all 3 of the functional measures. This\nremained true in the multivariate models. In contrast, remote\nand concurrent DBP changes were not associated with any of\nthe outcome measures (Table 2). These results did not change\nwhen we considered SBP and DBP without correction for\nthe effect of antihypertensive subjects (please see the data\nsupplement).\nHypertension Analysis\nCompared with normotensive participants, hypertensive par-\nticipants demonstrated greater declines in all 3 of the func-\ntional measures. This remained true in the multivariate\nmodels after adjusting for potential confounders (Figure 1).\nTable 1.

The attributable risk percent-\nage of hypertension on disability was 15% for the Nagi scale,\n36% for the Rosow-Breslaw Scale, and 22% for the Katz\nADL scale.\nParticipants with uncontrolled hypertension were at in-\ncreased risk of developing disability compared with normo-\ntensive participants. However, those with controlled hyper-\ntension, defined as BP 140/90 mm Hg with treatment, had\nno significant difference in disability risk compared with\nnormotensive or uncontrolled hypertensive subjects (Table\n3). This was true for all 3 of the functional measures.\nAttributable risk percentage for uncontrolled hypertensive\nparticipants compared with normotensive participants was\n36% for the Nagi scale, 63% for the Rosow-Breslaw, and\n25% for the Katz ADL.\nSubgroup Interaction Analysis\nTable 4 provides the results of Cox proportional hazard\nmodels with an interaction term to test whether there was a\ndifferent association between hypertension and disability by\nvarious subgroups. There was only a gender-based difference\nin the association between hypertension and disability.\nWomen had a significantly increased risk of developing\ndisability from hypertension compared with men based on the\nRosow-Breslaw Scale and the Katz ADL scale but not the\nNagi scale (Table 4). There were no consistent differences in\nthe risk of developing disability from hypertension by age,\nrace, obesity, or other comorbidities.\nDiscussion\nThis study suggests that, in a biracial elderly population,\nconcurrent and remote SBP increases are associated with\ngreater rates of decline in functional abilities. In contrast,\nneither remote nor concurrent DBP was associated with\nfunctional declines. In addition, those with hypertension at\nbaseline have greater declines in functional abilities and are at\nincreased risk of developing a new disability compared with\nnormotensive individuals. Only those with uncontrolled hy-\npertension have greater declines in functional abilities and are\nat increased disability risk.\nFew previous studies have investigated the role of BP or\nhypertension in developing disability.4,21 Hubert and Fries22\nidentified hypertension as 1 risk of an array of factors for the\ndevelopment of disability over a period of 6 years in a group\nof 407 members of a runners club. In the Framingham\nDisability Study, hypertension was associated with an in-\ncreased risk of disability.3 The populations in both studies\nwere predominantly whites, and, hence, generalizability is\nlimited. Our study extends these findings to a sample that,\nunlike the Framingham study, adequately represented African\nAmericans. Moreover, none of the previous studies investi-\ngated the roles of SBP and DBP measured during the study\nperiod or remotely before the development of disability on\nthe rate functional loss in an elderly population. Our analysis\nsuggests that SBP plays a role in the loss of function, but DBP\ndoes not. This is in agreement with previous evidence\nsuggesting that SBP is a better predictor of future cardiovas-\ncular and cerebrovascular disease in elderly individuals than\nTable 3.

The lack of associ-\nation between controlled hypertension and disability risk\nsuggests that adequate control of hypertension may prevent\nfunctional decline. However, this could also be related to the\nsmall sample size of those with controlled hypertension.\nThese findings should be interpreted cautiously and need to\nbe replicated in other studies with larger samples.\nWomen are more likely to develop disability compared\nwith men.24,25 In this study we found that, compared with\nmen, women are particularly at an increased risk of develop-\ning disability from hypertension. Because hypertension is\nmore prevalent in women,5 this may provide a possible\nexplanation for the increased predisposition to disability in\nwomen.\nThe development of disability with aging is a complex\nprocess and involves interactions between the individual's\nabilities and the surrounding environment.26 Contrary to\nprevious thought that disability was because of disabling\nmedical illnesses, recent literature emphasizes a conceptual\ndifference between comorbidity and disability.27 We found an\nassociation between hypertension and measures of disability,\nwhich was robust to adjustment for self-reported relevant\ncomorbidities including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular dis-\nease, and arthritis. The mechanisms by which hypertension\nmay produce disability are not known. It is possible that\nhypertension may lead to disability through its effect on white\nmatter hyperintensities in the brain,28 cerebrovascular func-\nchanges in the renin angiotensin system.32,33 It also could be\nmediated through the effect of hypertension on cognitive\nfunction not assessed in the Charleston Heart Study, such as\nexecutive function34 or fluid intellectual functioning.35 Fur-\nther studies to explore these possible mechanisms are needed.\nAn advantage of our study population is the low rate of\nhypertension control, which enabled us to assess the associ-\nation between uncontrolled hypertension and disability. Also,\nthe sample had close to 40% Southeastern African Ameri-\ncans, who were underrepresented in previous studies.\nA limitation of our study is that our sample was not\ndisability free at baseline. We conducted 2 analyses: 1\ninvestigating the rate of functional decline and the second\ninvestigating the risk of developing a new disability in those\nwithout disability at baseline. Both approaches lead to similar\nresults. Another limitation is that all of the functional mea-\nsures were self-reported. These measures have been widely\nused for assessing disability in the general population. Fur-\nthermore, comorbidity assessment was conducted using self-\nreport via an interview. In particular, there was no further\nobjective confirmation for the diagnosis of stroke. Although\nthis method has been validated for stroke diagnosis,36 our\nresults should be interpreted cautiously. Also, measures of\ncognitive function and mood were not conducted except in\nthe later period of the study. Because BP and disability are\nrelated to both, interpretation of our results should take this\ninto consideration.\nHigher concurrent and 20 years' previous SBP increases\nare associated with an increased rate of functional decline\nin older adults. In addition, those with hypertension,\nparticularly uncontrolled hypertension, have a significant\nincrease in disability risk independent of other risk factors\nor comorbidities.\nPerspectives\nThis study suggests an association between elevated SBP and\nhypertension with disability in older adults. Considering that\n65% of the elderly population has hypertension and that 71%\nof them have uncontrolled hypertension, it is contributing\nsignificantly to disability and to healthcare expenditure in the\nTable 4.
