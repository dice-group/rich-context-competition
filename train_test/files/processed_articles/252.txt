The purpose of this study is to see if emotional support received from fellow church members and\nemotional support from secular social networks reduce the effects of financial strain on self-rated health. A second goal is\nto determine if church-based social support is a more important coping resource for older Blacks than for older Whites.\nMethods. The data come from the second wave of interviews with a nationwide sample of older people. Two groups of\nolder adults are included in the analyses: Older Christians who go to church more than twice a year (N \u00bc 548) and older\npeople who do not go to church as frequently (N \u00bc 238).\nResults. The data suggest that support from fellow church members tends to reduce the impact of financial strain on\nself-rated health, but support from secular network members fails to exert a similar effect. The findings also reveal that the\nstress-buffering effects of church-based support emerge among older Blacks, but not older Whites.\nDiscussion. The findings from this study suggest that there may be something relatively unique about support that is\nprovided by fellow church members.\nDURING the past several decades, researchers have con-\nducted a number of studies to see if greater involvement\nin religion is associated with better physical and mental health\n(Koenig, McCullough, & Larson, 2001). Taken as a whole, this\nliterature reveals that religion may serve some health-protective\nor health-enhancing function, but it is not clear why this may\nbe so (Krause, 2004). The identification of a clear causal\nmechanism is important because, as Bradley and Schaefer\n(1998) convincingly argue, ``. . . a claim of causality is\nfundamentally interpretative. Its credibility depends on the\npresentation of a mechanism that substantial numbers of people\nfind compelling'' (pp. 166\u00ad167). Some investigators maintain\nthat the health-related benefits of religion may be traced to the\nfact that it helps people cope more effectively with adversity\n(Pargament, 1997). But there is still a lot we do not know about\nthis coping process.\nResearchers have argued for some time that informal social\nrelationships that arise within a church tend to be especially\nclose and highly supportive (Ellison & Levin, 1998). This is\nimportant because a considerable number of studies that were\nconducted in secular settings indicate that older people with\nstrong social support networks are able to cope more\neffectively with stress than are older adults who do not\nmaintain meaningful social relationships with others (Krause,\n2001). Given this extensive body of secular work, it is\nsurprising to find that the potential stress-buffering role of\nchurch-based social support has been largely overlooked in the\nliterature. Ellison and his colleagues conducted one of the few\nstudies on this issue (Ellison, Boardman, Williams, & Jackson,\n2001). They were unable to find evidence that church-based\nsocial support reduces the noxious effects of stress on either\npsychological distress or psychological well-being. But it is\nimportant to continue work in this area because Ellison and\ncolleagues focused solely on mental health outcomes. As\na result, we do not know if church-based social support\nreduces the effects of stress on other outcomes, such as self-\nrated health.\nThe purpose of the present study is to see if church-based\nsocial support reduces the effects of stress on the self-rated\nhealth of older adults. In the process, two issues are examined\nthat have not been evaluated empirically by other investigators.\nFirst, the wide majority of older adults maintain close\nrelationships with family members and friends who do not\nworship with them. This raises the possibility that support\nprovided by either fellow church members or secular social\nnetwork members (or both) may help older people cope with\nstress. Put another way, we need to know if there is something\nunique about the stress-buffering properties of church-based\nsocial support, or whether it has the same effect as support in\nthe secular world. Second, a growing body of research indicates\nthat older African Americans tend to receive more support from\ntheir fellow church members than do older Whites (Taylor,\nChatters, & Levin, 2004). This research raises the possibility\nthat church-based social support systems are an especially\nimportant coping resource for older Blacks. Unfortunately, this\nissue has been largely overlooked in the literature.\nThe theoretical underpinnings of this study are presented\nbelow in three sections. The potentially unique aspects of\nchurch-based social support are examined first. Following this,\nevidence is provided which suggests that older Blacks may\nderive greater benefits than may older Whites from church-\nbased social support. Finally, an effort is made to show why it\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2006 by The Gerontological Society of America\nis important to explore the effects of church-based social\nsupport with data provided by older people.\nChurch-Based Versus Secular Social Support\nAs Ellison and Levin (1998) point out, there are at least two\nreasons why church-based social support may be an especially\neffective coping resource. The first has to do with beliefs about the\nnature of stress and suffering, and the second involves the motives\nfor helping people who are in need. Individuals who worship in\nthe same congregation tend to have a shared set of values and\nbeliefs that are based on a common faith and shared religious\nteachings. A good deal of these shared beliefs involve issues\nrelated specifically to stress. In particular, people who worship\ntogether tend to have common views about why there is pain and\nsuffering in the world. Moreover, there is often a shared sense\nthat God has a reason for the things that happen in life, and that\nadversity may eventually lead to personal growth and de-\nvelopment (Linley & Joseph, 2003). But perhaps most impor-\ntantly, these beliefs and values form the basis for developing and\nsharing religious coping responses that are designed to help the\nfaithful overcome the inevitable problems that arise in life\n(Krause, Ellison, Shaw, Marcum, & Boardman, 2001).\nCoupled with these stress-specific beliefs is a strong motiva-\ntion for helping others that, once again, arises from shared\nreligious principles. The older people in this study are primarily\nmembers of the Christian faith. This faith encourages a number\nof beliefs and behaviors that promote and enhance the help-\ngiving process. More specifically, sacred texts encourage people\nto love one another, help those who are in need, and forgive\nothers for things they have done wrong. Moreover, help-\nproviders are taught to give without expecting anything in return.\nResearch in secular settings helps to show why these\nreligiously based helping motives are important. In reading\nsecular research on stress and social support, one is often left\nwith the impression that people always actively seek out, and\ngratefully receive, assistance from others during difficult times.\nBut as research reviewed by Eckenrode and Wethington (1990)\nreveals, this may not always be true. More specifically, these\ninvestigators argue that people may be reluctant to turn to\nothers for assistance when the event that confronts them is\nstigmatizing, embarrassing, or is perceived to be caused by their\nown limitations or inaction. The helping motives encouraged by\nreligion may foster a welcoming and trusting interpersonal\natmosphere that makes it easier for fellow church members to\nreach out to each other during difficult times.\nOther aspects of congregational life may serve to enhance the\nquality of church-based social support. Research by Krause and\nWulff (2005) suggests that some older people have attended\nworship services in the same congregation for decades. As\na result, they have shared rituals with fellow church members\nthat signal major passages in life, such as christenings, weddings,\nand funerals. These experiences generate shared memories that\nare charged with emotion and valued highly (Wuthnow, 1999).\nThis shared history may provide fertile ground in which\nreligiously based helping motives can be put into action.\nSome of the attributes associated with church-based support\nmay be found in the secular world as well. For example,\nmembers of the local Rotary Club may engage in charitable\nactivities without expecting compensation for what they have\ndone. But what sets church-based support apart from assistance\nin the secular world is that support in religious settings is\nimbued with the mantle of religious authority. Simply put, the\nbasis for helping others, and the nature of the assistance that is\nprovided, is thought to explicitly emanate from the word of\nGod. And people who believe this may be more likely to\nengage in the sanctioned helping behaviors and take steps to\nensure that these supportive acts are performed in a way that is\nconsistent with the fundamental tenets of the faith.\nExploring Variations by Race\nFor more than 100 years, scholars and theologians have\nargued that social support networks are especially well\ndeveloped in the Black church. Writing in 1887, Du Bois\nconcluded that, ``The Negro church . . . provides social inter-\ncourse, it provides amusements of various kinds, it serves as\na newspaper and intelligence bureau, it supplants the theater, it\ndirects the picnic and excursion, it furnishes the music, it in-\ntroduces the stranger to the community, it serves as a lyceum, li-\nbrary, and lecture bureau--it is, in fine, the central organ of the\norganized life of the American Negro'' (Du Bois, 2000, p. 21).\nAlthough Du Bois made these observations more than a century\nago, more recent evidence indicates that the church continues to\nbe a major source of social support for African Americans. For\nexample, the noted Black theologian J. Deotis Roberts argues\nthat, ``The Black church, as a social and religious body, has\nserved as a kind of `extended family' for Blacks. In a real sense,\nthen, thousands of Blacks who have never known real family\nlife have discovered the meaning of real kinship in the Black\nchurch'' (Goatley, 2003, p. 78). Support for these observations\nof Roberts is provided in a study by Krause (2002). His findings\nindicate that older Blacks get more emotional support from\nfellow church members than do older Whites.\nThere are both historical and cultural reasons why the church\nhas assumed such a prominent position in the Black community.\nWith respect to history, a number of researchers maintain that\nthe church became the social center of the community because\nof centuries of prejudice and discrimination. More specifically,\nBlack people turned to the church for social as well as spiritual\nsustenance because it was the only institution in the community\nthat was built, funded, and wholly controlled by Black people\n(Nelsen & Nelsen, 1975). Cultural factors may come into play\nas well. Baldwin and Hopkins (1990) have gone to great\nlengths to identify the key elements of the African American\nworldview or culture. They argue that African American culture\nis characterized by its emphasis on harmony, cooperation,\ncollective responsibility, ``groupness,'' and ``sameness.'' These\ncultural characteristics are likely to permeate the Black church,\ngiving rise to strong church-based social support systems.\nThe issues that have been raised up to this point suggest that\nsocial support systems may be more well developed in the Black\nchurch than in White congregations. However, it is important to\nshow why these support systems are more likely to help older\nAfrican Americans cope with the effects of stress. The ana-\nlyses provided below focus on one specific type of stressful\nexperience--chronic financial strain. Initially, it might appear\nthat when financial problems arise, older Whites and older\nBlacks would turn to an array of public assistance programs for\nhelp. But African Americans have had a long history of\nencountering difficulty with social welfare agencies (Trattner,\n1999). When these experiences are contrasted with the warm and\nKRAUSE\nwelcoming social atmosphere of the church, it is not difficult to\nsee why the church may become the resource of choice for older\nAfrican Americans who are faced with economic difficulty.\nChurch-Based Social Support and Stress in Late Life\nThere are two reasons why church-based social support\nsystems are likely to become an especially important coping\nresource for older people. First, extensive research by Carstensen\nreveals that as people enter late life, they become increasingly\naware that they have relatively few years left to live. This growing\nawareness of time is important because it leads older people to\nseek out relationships that are emotionally close, and shed social\nties that are more peripheral in this respect (e.g., Fung &\nCarstensen, 2004). Similar views are expressed by Tornstam\n(1997). He argues that as people age, they become more selective\nin the social relationships they maintain. More specifically, his\nresearch indicates that as people grow older, they prefer deeper\nrelationships with a few people instead of more superficial\nrelationships with many individuals. Given these developmental\ninfluences, it seems that the tightly knit social support systems\nthat arise in the church may be especially attractive to older adults.\nPerhaps this is one reason why rates of church attendance are\nhigher among older than among younger people (Barna, 2002).\nSecond, a number of studies suggest that older people tend to\nface different kinds of stressors than do younger adults. More\nspecifically, this research indicates that even though older\npeople encounter fewer stressful life events than do younger\npeople, they are more likely to be faced with stressors that are\ncontinuous and ongoing (i.e., chronic strains) (Krause, 1999).\nAnd when chronic strains arise, older people may have fewer\noptions than younger people have for dealing with them. This is\nespecially true with respect to chronic financial strain. A number\nof individuals retire from the labor force by the time they reach\nage 65 (Schulz, 2001). However, some re-enter the labor force\nafter retirement (Henretta, 2001). Although there are several\nreasons for this, one may be to alleviate current financial\ndifficulties. But the opportunity to take this kind of direct action\nmay diminish with advancing age--by about the time people\nreach age 75, physical as well as cognitive limitations may\ndiscourage the use of this coping strategy. If direct action cannot\nbe taken to resolve financial problems, then they may continue\nunabated. As a result, religion may become an especially viable\nresource for coping with this type of difficulty (Gottlieb, 1997).\nThe theoretical rationale for this study leads to the following\nstudy hypotheses:\n1. Church-based social support reduces the deleterious effect\nof chronic financial strain on self-rated health;\n2. Church-based social support is a more effective stress-\nbuffering resource than is social support that arises in\nsecular settings; and\n3. The stress-buffering function of church-based support is\nmore evident among older African Americans than among\nolder Whites.\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe data for this study come from a nationwide longitudinal\nsurvey of older Whites and older African Americans. The study\npopulation was defined as all household residents who were\neither White or Black, noninstitutionalized, English speaking,\nand at least 66 years of age. Geographically, the study\npopulation was restricted to eligible persons residing within\nthe coterminous United States (i.e., residents of Alaska and\nHawaii were excluded). Finally, the study population was\nrestricted to people who were currently practicing Christians,\nindividuals who were Christian in the past but no longer\npractice any religion, and people who were not affiliated with\nany faith at any point in their lifetime. Individuals who practice\na religion other than Christianity (e.g., Jews or Muslims) were\nexcluded because it would be difficult to devise a set of religion\nmeasures that would be suitable for persons of all faiths.\nThe sampling frame consisted of all eligible persons\ncontained in the Medicare beneficiary eligibility list maintained\nby the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services(CMS). This\nlist contains virtually every older adult in the United States.\nHowever, some older people are not in the data base because\nthey do not have a Social Security number. This may be due to\nfactors such as undocumented immigration. A five-step process\nwas used to draw the sample from the CMS file. A detailed\ndiscussion of these steps is provided by Krause (2002).\nInterviewing for the baseline survey took place in 2001. The\ndata collection was performed by Harris Interactive (New York,\nNY). A total of 1,500 interviews were completed. All interviews\nwere conducted face-to-face in the homes of the respondents.\nThe study participants were not screened for cognitive disability\nprior to the interview. Elderly Blacks were oversampled so that\nsufficient statistical power would be available to fully explore\nrace differences in religion. More specifically, the sample\nconsisted of 748 Whites and 752 older African Americans. The\noverall response rate for the study was 62%.\nThe Wave 2 survey was conducted in 2004. A total of\n1,024 study participants were reinterviewed successfully, 75\nrefused to participate, 112 could not be located, 70 were too ill to\nparticipate, 11 had moved to a nursing home, and 208 were\ndeceased. Not counting those who had died or were placed in\na nursing home,the response rate for the Wave 2 survey was80%.\nData on social support received in secular settings were not\nobtained until the Wave 2 survey. Therefore, the analyses\npresented below are based on the Wave 2 data only. When the\nWave 2 interviews were conducted, 342 study participants\nindicated that they attend church no more than twice a year.\nHowever, it did not make sense to ask people about church-\nbased social support if they attend worship services no more\nthan twice a year. As a result, the questions on church-based\nsocial support were administered to a total of 682 Wave 2 study\nparticipants. After using listwise deletion of cases to deal with\nitem nonresponse, the main analyses presented below are based\non between 538 and 548 cases. Analysis of the group consisting\nof 548 older study participants revealed that 44% were older\nWhites and 56% were older Blacks. The average age of these\nmen, and 49% were married when the Wave 2 interviews took\nplace. Finally, the older adults in this group indicated they\nhad successfully completed an average of 11.9 years of school-\ning (SD \u00bc 3.4 years). These descriptive data, as well as the\nresults presented below, are based on data that have been\nweighted. More specifically, separate weights were devised for\neach racial group so that they would correspond to the most\nrecent race-specific Census data on age, sex, education, and\nregion of the country.\nMeasures\nTable 1 contains the measures that were used in this survey.\nThe procedures used to code these items are provided in the\nfootnotes of this table.\nSelf-rated health. --Global self-rated health status was\nassessed with three indicators. A high score on these items\ndenotes more favorable health ratings.

A high score represents greater financial\ndifficulty. The reliability estimate for this scale is .791.\nChurch-based emotional support. --As shown in Table 1,\nthree items that were devised by Krause (2002) were used to\nassess emotional support provided by fellow church members.\nThese indicators were only presented to study participants who\nattended church more than twice a year. The questions are\ncoded so that a high score means more emotional support was\nreceived at church. The internal consistency reliability estimate\nfor this brief composite is .826.\nEmotional support from outside the church. --Three groups\nof older people are described in the analyses provided below:\n(1) those who go to church more than twice a year; (2) those\nwho go to church no more than twice a year but have contact\nwith people in a local church; and (3) those who go to church\nno more than twice a year and do not have contact with a local\nchurch. A series of secular support measures had to be devised\nfor each group.\nThe majority of the study participants go to church more than\ntwice a year (N \u00bc 548). Because the goal of this study was to\ncompare and contrast the effects of church-based and secular\nsupport, it was important to devise measures that are not\nconfounded. This problem could have arisen, for example, if\nolder respondents worshipped with family members. An\nexample using the first listed church-based support item in\nTable 1 shows how this problem was handled. The questions on\nsecular emotional support for people in this group were\nintroduced with the following statement: ``Now I have some\nquestions about people who do not attend your church.'' Then\nthe question stems for the first secular emotional support item\nwas worded to read: ``Not counting your (minister, pastor, or\npriest) or fellow church members, how often do family and\nTable 1.

The same\nstrategy was used to modify the other two support items,\nresulting in a three-item secular support measure for members\nof this group.\nIf people indicated that they attended church no more than\ntwice a year, a question was asked to see if they, nevertheless,\nkept in touch with people from a local congregation. A small\nnumber of Wave 2 participants indicated that they did so\n(N \u00bc 54). Church-based support items were not administered to\nthe older adults in this group, but secular support items were\ndevised for them. These secular support indicators were\nintroduced with the following statement: ``Now I'd like you\nto think about family members and friends who are not in the\nchurch you have contact with.'' Then, as the following example\nreveals, the question stems for the emotional support items\nwere worded to read: ``Not counting your minister or fellow\nchurch members, how often do your family and friends let you\nknow they love and care for you?'' This same strategy was used\nto modify the other emotional support items shown in Table 1,\nresulting in a three-item secular support measure for the\nmembers of this group.\nThe third group of study participants consisted of older people\nwho do not go to church more than twice a year and who do not\nhave contact with anyone in a local church (N\u00bc174). Therefore,\nthese study participants were not asked questions about church-\nbased support. Instead, they were only asked questions about\nsecular support. As the following example reveals, the secular\nemotional support items were worded to read: ``How often do\nyour family members and friends let you know they love and\ncare for you?'' As with the other groups, a three-item secular\nsupport measure was developed using this strategy.\nA single set of secular support items was computed by\nmerging responses to the items across the three groups. A high\nscore stands for more secular emotional support. Prior to\nmerging the items, the reliability estimate in the first group is\n.787, while the corresponding estimate in the second (.843) and\nthird groups (.802) are roughly the same.\nReligious control measures. --As a number of investigators\nhave observed, religion is a complex, multidimensional\nphenomenon (Ellison & Levin, 1998). Moreover, the correla-\ntions among some of these dimensions are fairly large.\nTherefore, steps must be taken to ensure that the potential\nstress-buffering properties of church-based emotional support\nare due specifically to this construct and not to some other\nelement of religion that is correlated with it. It is for this reason\nthat measures of two other facets of religion are included in the\nanalyses presented below. The first is used widely in the\nliterature and is sometimes referred to as ``organizational\nreligiousness'' (Krause & Tran, 1989). This construct assesses\nthe extent to which older study respondents participate in\nformal worship services, Bible study groups, and prayer groups.\nA high score on this measure represents greater involvement in\nformal activities at church. The internal consistency reliability\nestimate for this brief composite is .791.\nIndicators that assess private religious practices are also\nincluded in this study. These items ask about the frequency of\nprivate prayer, how often older people read the Bible at home,\nand how often older study participants watch religious services\non TV or listen to them on the radio. A high score on these\nindicators represents more frequent private involvement. The\nreliability estimate for the brief composite formed from these\nDemographic control measures. --The relationships among\nreligion, financial strain, and self-rated health were assessed\nafter the effects of age, sex, marital status, education, and race\nwere controlled for statistically. Age is scored in a continuous\nformat. Similarly, education is coded in a continuous format\ndenoting the total number of years of completed schooling.\nFinally, sex (1\u00bcmen; 0\u00bcwomen), marital status (1\u00bcpresently\nmarried; 0 \u00bc not married), and race (1 \u00bc White; 0 \u00bc African\nAmericans) are represented with binary indicators.\nRESULTS\nThe findings from this study are presented in four sections.\nFirst, basic descriptive data are provided for the core study\nmeasures. The next section contains findings from the analyses\nthat compare and contrast the relative stress-buffering effects\nof church-based and secular support. Following this, results\ninvolving race differences in the stress-buffering effects of\nchurch-based support are provided. The last section contains\nfindings from a series of supplementary analyses that have not\nbeen discussed up to this point. These additional analyses were\ndesigned to clarify and extend the results that emerge from tests\nof the main study hypotheses. All analyses were performed\nwith the SPSS statistical software program (version 12).\nDescriptive Data for Older Whites and Older Blacks\nTable 2 contains the means and standard deviations for the\ncore study measures that have been broken out by race.\nConsistent with previous research, the data suggest that older\nWhites rate their health more favorably than do older Blacks,\nand older African Americans encounter more financial strain\nthan do their White counterparts. As research reviewed by\nTaylor, Chatters, and Levin (2004) reveals, the means for the\nthree core religion measures indicate that older Blacks are more\ninvolved in religious activities than are older Whites. In\nTable 2. Race Differences in Core Study Measures\nVariable\nM (SD)\nOlder Whites\nOlder Blacks\nNotes: All significance tests are t tests.\n*mean difference p , .05; **mean difference p , .01; ***mean difference\ncontrast, significant race differences failed to emerge with\nrespect to secular emotional support.\nChurch-Based Support and Secular Support\nTable 3 contains the findings from the analyses that were\ndesigned to compare the relative stress-buffering effects of\nchurch-based support and support provided by people outside\na respondent's congregation. These analyses are restricted\nsolely to older people who attended church more than twice\na year. The analyses were performed with a two-step\nhierarchical multiple regression model. In the first step, self-\nreported health was regressed on financial strain, church-based\nsupport, secular support, the religious control variables, and the\ndemographic control measures. The second step involved tests\nfor the proposed interactions between church-based support,\nsecular support, and financial strain on self-rated health. This\nstep was executed by adding two multiplicative terms to the\nmodel. These cross-product terms were formed by multiplying\nchurch-based support by financial strain and secular support by\nfinancial strain.\nIf the regression coefficient associated with one of the\nmultiplicative terms is statistically significant, then hand cal-\nculations described by Aiken and West (1991) are performed to\nhelp interpret the interaction effect. If the theoretical rationale\ndeveloped for this study is valid, then the relationship between\nfinancial strain and self-rated health should become pro-\ngressively weaker at higher levels of church-based support.\nThe hand calculations yield two estimates: (1) unstandardized\nregression coefficients representing the relationships between\nfinancial strain and self-rated health at select levels of church-\nbased support; and (2) t tests to see if these coefficients differ\nsignificantly from zero. Following this, standardized regression\nestimates for the relationship between financial strain and self-\nrated health are computed in the usual manner.\nThe findings in the left-hand column of Table 2 (see Model\n1) were derived from the first step in the hierarchical regression\nanalysis. The data suggest that more financial strain is\nassociated with less favorable health ratings (b \u00bc \u00c0.216; p ,\n.001). In contrast, neither church-based emotional support\n(b \u00bc\u00c0.091; not significant [ns]) nor secular emotional support\n(b \u00bc .059; ns) is significantly related to self-rated health. This\nwould appear to suggest that social support has little effect on\nthe self-rated health of older people.\nFortunately, the data in the right-hand column of Table 3 (see\nModel 2) provide a different view. More specifically, the\nfindings reveal that the interaction between church-based\nemotional support and self-rated health is statistically signifi-\ncant (b \u00bc .038; p , .01; unstandardized coefficients are\npresented for multiplicative terms because standardized esti-\nmates are meaningless in this context). However, emotional\nsupport from people outside the church does not appear to\noffset the effects of financial strain on self-rated health (b \u00bc\n\u00c0.004; ns). The nature of the statistically significant interaction\neffect is illustrated by performing the hand calculations\nrecommended by Aiken and West (1991). This involves\nestimating the relationship between financial strain and self-\nrated health at select levels of church-based support. Although\nany value on the church-based support scale could be used for\nthis purpose, the following scores were selected: \u00c01 standard\ndeviation below the mean support score, the mean church-based\nsupport value, and \u00fe1 standard deviation above the average\nsupport score.\nThe additional hand calculations (not shown in Table 3)\nsuggest that financial strain is associated with worse self-rated\nhealth for older adults with low levels of church-based support\np , .001). However, the relationship between financial strain\nand self-rated health is not as strong for older people with\naverage levels of church-based emotional support (b \u00bc \u00c0.216;\nb\u00bc\u00c0.193; p , .001). The potentially important stress-buffering\nproperties of church-based support are even more evident\namong older people who receive relatively high levels of\nassistance from their fellow church members (b \u00bc \u00c0.108; b \u00bc\n\u00c0.096; p , .01). Simply put, the data suggest that church-based\nemotional support significantly offsets the effects of financial\nstrain on self-rated health in late life.\nExploring Variations by Race\nThe next set of analyses is designed to see if the relation-\nships among financial strain, church-based support, and health\ndiffer for older Whites and older Blacks. Once again, these\nanalyses involve only older people who attended church more\nthan twice a year. This set of analyses is complex because\nit calls for a three-way statistical interaction effect between\nrace, financial strain, and church-based support on self-rated\nhealth. The results from these analyses are presented in Table\n4. Four multiplicative terms were added to the model to\nproperly test for the proposed three-way interaction effect:\nFinancial strain 3 Church-based support; Race 3 Financial\nTable 3.

However,\nit is difficult to determine the precise nature of these effects.\nThere are two ways to proceed. The first involves computing\na series of estimates by hand using other formulas provided by\nAiken and West (1991). The second has to do with performing\na subgroup analysis in which the interaction between church-\nbased support and financial strain on health is estimated in\nsamples composed solely of older Whites and older Blacks,\nrespectively. The subgroup approach is taken here (see\nAneshensel, 2002, for a detailed discussion of this issue).\nThis approach is justified by the fact that the coefficient\nassociated with the three-way interaction term is statistically\nsignificant. The same control measures are used throughout the\nsubgroup analysis.\nThe subgroup analysis (not shown here) reveals that church-\nbased emotional support tends to offset the effects of financial\nstrain on self-rated health for older Blacks (b\u00bc .057; p , .005),\nbut not for older Whites (b \u00bc \u00c0.006; ns). Consistent with the\nstrategy implemented above, additional hand calculations were\nperformed to illustrate the nature of the interaction effect in the\nsubgroup comprising older African Americans. These compu-\ntations indicate that financial strain is associated with worse\nself-rated health for older blacks who receive little emotional\nsupport from the people with whom they worship (i.e., those\nat \u00c01 standard deviation below the mean support value; b \u00bc\nself-rated health is reduced for older African Americans with\naverage levels of assistance from their fellow church members\nbetween financial strain and self-rated health is no longer\nstatistically significant for older Blacks who receive relatively\nmore emotional support from the people in their congregation\nSupplementary Analyses\nThe findings that have emerged up to this point suggest that\nchurch-based social support may buffer or offset the effects of\nfinancial strain on health, but support that arises in secular\nnetworks may be less useful in this respect. However, it is\nimportant to carefully reflect on what the study findings actually\nreveal. The data that have been presented so far are based solely\non those older people who attend church more than twice a\nyear. As a result, the findings say nothing about whether\nsupport arising in secular settings is helpful for people who are\nnot regular churchgoers. It may be, for example, that secular\nsupport works best for individuals who do not go to church\noften, whereas church-based support is more efficacious for\nthose who are more involved in the church. To better under-\nstand the relative efficacy of church-based and secular\nsupport, it is important to bring infrequent churchgoers into\nthe analyses.\nAnother regression analysis was performed to see if support\nfrom secular sources buffers the effects of financial strain on\nhealth for older people who attend church no more than twice\na year (N\u00bc228). Private religious practices and the demographic\nvariables are included as control measures in this analysis. The\ndata (not shown here) suggest that the interaction between\nfinancial strain and secular support on self-rated health is\nnot statistically significant for older people in this group (b \u00bc\nAlthough this additional set of analyses is helpful, it does not\ngo far enough because it is hard to see why secular support\nappears to be of little use to those persons who do not go to\nchurch often. Several studies in secular settings suggest that\nolder people who are faced with ongoing economic problems\ntend to receive less emotional support from family members\nand friends (e.g., Krause & Jay, 1991). This finding suggests\nthat financial strain may erode the quality of informal social\nsupport in late life. Hobfoll's (1998) notion of the ``pressure\ncooker effect'' helps show why this may be so. When an older\nadult experiences economic problems, there is a good chance\nthat members of his or her support network are also grappling\nwith the same problem. When this happens, Hobfoll argues\nthat, ``Since no one in the system is free of threat, individuals\nwho themselves have great need to depend on others must serve\nas supporters and lose precious resources that they themselves\nrequire'' (p. 208). Because of this, the amount and quality of\nsupport they provide will be diminished.\nThis issue was addressed in the present study with three\nadditional analyses. First, support from secular network\nmembers was regressed on financial strain, private religious-\nness, and the demographic control variables for those older\npeople who do not go to church often (i.e., no more than twice\na year; N \u00bc 238). The data suggest that more financial strain is\nassociated with less secular support for the older adults in this\nTable 4.

The data suggest that\nfinancial strain is not related significantly to the amount of\nsupport that these individuals receive from secular sources (b \u00bc\n\u00c0.058; ns). Further calculations revealed that the difference\nbetween these two estimates is significant at the .05 level. In the\nthird analysis, church-based support was regressed on financial\nstrain, private religiousness, and the demographic control\nvariables for those who go to church more often. The findings\nsuggest that financial strain is not significantly related to\nchurch-based emotional support (b \u00bc \u00c0.020; ns). Taken as\na whole, these preliminary analyses suggest that church-based\nsupport provided to more frequent churchgoers is more\nefficacious than is secular support provided to less frequent\nchurchgoers because it appears to be relatively impervious to\nthe otherwise corrosive influence of ongoing economic\nproblems.\nDISCUSSION\nThree major findings emerge from this study. First, the data\nindicate that the relationship between financial strain and self-\nrated health is offset for older people who receive relatively\nmore emotional support from the people at church. Second,\nsupport provided by relationships formed in the secular world\ndoes not appear to have the same effect. Third, the results\nsuggest that church-based emotional support tends to offset the\neffects of financial strain on self-rated health for older African\nAmericans, but not older Whites. This appears to be the first\ntime that any of these relationships have been examined\nempirically. The findings involving the contrast between\nchurch-based and secular support are especially provocative.\nAlthough the results from this study may contribute to the\nliterature on church-based social relationships, there is still a lot\nwe do not know. For example, the data suggest that church-\nbased support may be an effective coping resource for older\npeople who are faced with economic problems, but we need to\nsee if this is true with respect to other stressors, such as the\ndeath of a loved one. In addition, research is needed to find out\nwhy church-based emotional support appears to be more\nefficacious for older Blacks than for older Whites. One\npossibility is that, instead of turning to fellow church members\nfor assistance, older Whites tend to rely on either psychological\ncoping resources (e.g., feelings of personal control), individual\nreligious coping responses (see Pargament, 1997), or formal\nsources of assistance (e.g., social welfare agencies).\nIn the process of conducting further work in this field,\nresearchers would be well advised to take the limitations in this\nstudy into account. Three are examined briefly. First, and\nperhaps most important, the data in the analyses presented\nabove were gathered at a single point in time. As a result, the\ntemporal ordering among the study constructs was based on\ntheoretical considerations alone. However, one might easily\nreverse the proposed causal ordering and instead specify that\nolder adults with initially poor self-rated health tend to\nsubsequently experience more economic problems. Clearly\nthis, as well as other issues involving causality, must be\nrigorously evaluated with data that have been gathered at more\nthan one point in time.\nSecond, church-based social relationships represent a com-\nplex conceptual domain in its own right. Yet, only one type of\nchurch support was examined in this study--emotional support\nfrom church members. It is important to see if other kinds of\nchurch-based support also help older adults cope more\neffectively with the problems they face. So, for example, it is\nimportant to know if emotional support from a clergy member\nhas the same stress-buffering function.\nFinally, the analyses in this study were based on responses of\nolder adults from a wide spectrum of Christian denominations.\nThis assumes that church-based support systems are just as\neffective in some denominations (e.g., Baptists) as in others\n(e.g., Catholics). This may not be a valid assumption.\nJosiah Royce was a well-known philosopher of his time and\na close friend of William James. Royce wrote a book in 1912\nthat was designed to overcome what he felt were serious\noversights was the emphasis James placed on the role of the\nunconscious processes in the generation of religious feelings and\nof arising from within the individual, the impetus for religious\nexperiences and sentiments was decidedly social in nature.\nMore specifically, he argued that, ``. . . our social experience is\nour primary source of religious insight. And the salvation that\nthis insight brings to our knowledge is salvation through the\nfostering of human brotherhood. Such salvation accrues to the\nindividual in so far as he gives himself over to the service of\nprovide one way of showing that Royce may have been right.\n"
