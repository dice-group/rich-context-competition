    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the postmodern period, first-person-limited, unreliable, female narrators may have a greater difficulty in \"seeing\" and, thus,\ndepicting their landscapes than previous eras' storytellers. Iris (Chase) Griffen, narrator-protagonist of Margaret Atwood's\nThe Blind Assassin, spins a complicated, self-reflective text exploring her attempts at composing a world vision that consumes\nthe novel's larger part. Iris's search for answers about her identity as well as that of other characters may leave readers in the\nlurch, waiting for their \"story,\" in Ross Chambers's terms, as an agreed-upon product. Nonetheless, having amassed assorted\ntextual materials, Iris stockpiles the ammunition she needs to do her \"job\" as a storyteller-assassin who creates and destroys,\nas characters suffer a fall. Assuming guises dependent on location, Iris enacts the conflicting roles of a victim, social product,\nvillain, and blind assassin to assault her culture's masculinist architectures that bar women's points of views in opposition\nto what Henry James presents as the unending panoramas offered by his metaphorical \"House of Fiction.\" Iris's struggle to\nconstruct her life story mirrors the difficulty many women face more broadly, in which they face competing, irreconcilable\nvalues. In the novel, Iris's ability to play differing parts with equal aplomb compels readers to view her as a complex narrator,\nconstructing and assassinating fellow characters to render her female descendants' fates as open ended.\n",

Narrator-protagonist, Iris (Chase)\nGriffen, aged 83, states that her sister, Laura, drove Iris's car\noff of a Toronto bridge in 1945, decades before. This fatal act\non Laura's part likely constituted a suicide. Readers, as detec-\ntives, must attempt to piece together the novel's fragmentary\nnarrative to discover the event's tragic cause and assign blame\naccordingly. The audience will hope to uncover the nature of\nIris's multifaceted relationships with other characters whose\ndeaths, disappearances, or removals she also influences\nblindly but purposefully before vanishing herself into \"the\nunknown country,\" which does not signify either a place of\nrest or torment for her, as it does for Shakespeare's Hamlet,\nconsidering suicide, but somewhere else entirely. Atwood's\nreaders, searching for clues about Iris and the cast, may find\nassembling the book's parts arduous. Iris's final destination,\nlocated beyond her castle and other residences, exists beyond\nher milieu's static, Cartesian-based dualisms and past the\nboundaries of southern Ontario's patriarchally constructed\npage. For Atwood, Hamlet's quandary of whether \"to be or\nnot to be\" may represent the question protagonists ask.\nHowever, for Iris, both being and not being signifies the\nanswer, without the requisite for female characters to commit\nto any temporal-spatial location. Atwood presents The Blind\nAssassin as a multilayered, postmodernist novel foreground-\ning the memoir of an unreliable female narrator with a failing\nmemory and changing stances. Atwood employs complex\ncompositional strategies highlighting poststructural and femi-\nnist positions that test readers' trust in the narrative view and,\nthus, the textual message itself via a negotiation with the\nauthor that Ross Chambers (1984) calls the reader/writer\n\"contract\" (p. 22). As an author-as-character herself, Iris\nshares her conflicting roles with The Blind Assassin's readers\nas a pawn to family members, nemesis to her sister, and\nhoped-for heroine to progenitors as she resides in locations\noffering diverging but masculinist landscapes. Atwood\nexplores Iris's problematic identities as an autobiographer,\n1Southeastern Oklahoma State University, Durant, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nTara Hembrough, Assistant Professor, Department of English,\nEmail: thembrough@se.edu\nFrom an Obscured Gaze to a Seeing Eye?\nIris as Victim, Villain, and Avenger in the\nRole of Writer-as-Assassin in Margaret\nAtwood's The Blind Assassin\nTara Hembrough1\n Keywords\nMargaret Atwood, Blind Assassin, narration, women's writing, feminism, poststructuralism\n2 SAGE Open\nnovelist, and writer-as-assassin as Iris both tells and retracts a\nstory in which she is simultaneously a casualty, product, vil-\nlain, and usurper of her masculinist culture as aligned with\nher ever-changing perspectives on her history.\nChambers explains that the relationship an author and\naudience members forge\ndepends on social agreements, implicit pacts or contracts\n[between the parties] in order to produce exchanges that are\nthemselves a function of desires, purposes, constraints . . . . It is\nonly on the strength of such agreements that narratives can exert\ntheir impact and produce change . . . [or offer a] point. (p. 22)\nReaders possess expectations they demand be met, and nov-\nelists must \"earn the authority to narrate in the very act of\nstorytelling\" and \"master certain `tactical' devices\" of their\nart to clench the deal with audience-members-as-consumers\n(p. 23). Authors must decide how best to employ their weap-\nons of choice, including point-of-view considerations, in\ncomposing the written form. In The Blind Assassin, Atwood\nrefuses to conform to some traditional constraints of \"show-\nmanship\" that authors adopt to create novels that, according\nto Chambers, function as commodities they hope to sell both\nliterally and figuratively. Yet, to draw an audience, Atwood\ndoes enact the key storytelling strategy that Chambers argues\nnovelists must apply to produce effective prose. In fashion-\ning Iris as a narrator-as-writer with a story to reveal, Atwood\nproposes to share what Chambers calls a \"secret\" (p. 25),\neven if this enigma's contents remain mysterious, both unex-\nplainable and nontransmittable, for audience members as the\noutcome of their engaging the book. Because, as narrator,\nIris commits to no single view of events in The Blind\nAssassin, Atwood's readers may never discern whether or\nnot Iris is culpable for Laura's death or even comprehend\nhow Laura's demise should be seen: as tragic, redemptive, or\neven, based on Enlightenment-grounded binaries, meaning-\nless. Atwood's refusal to provide an answer to her book's\nriddle represents a positive outcome for the destinies of\nfemale family successors, who may fill in their own blanks\nconcerning their stories' conclusions.\nThe Blind Assassin: A Literature Review\nSince The Blind Assassin's publication, scholars have exam-\nined it through various lenses, including the psychoanalyti-\ncal, gender-concerned, politico-economic, historiographic,\nand narratological. J. Brooks Bouson (2003), applying femi-\nnist theory, proposes that Atwood's female characters are\nbound together by their \"victimization,\" whereas Hilde\nStaels (2004), identifying Iris as a writer contemplating the\npast, focuses on her \"self-victimization.\" Paula Farca (2010)\nargues that Atwood's women, parodying male discourses to\nilluminate their problematic status, form intergenerational\nliaisons, and Susan Watkins (2013) discusses how Iris, an\naging female writer, tells her story. From a politico-economic\nview, Alaina Kaus (2015) argues that with market liberalism\nat play, the characters themselves possess market values.\nImplementing a historiographic stance, S. Isabella and\nSundarsingh (2010) explore how Atwood's female charac-\nters utilize \"History and Fiction\" to foreground their\naccounts, Coral Ann Howells (1996) portrays the novel's\ninterrogation of typical Canadian accounts, and Alan\nRobinson (2006) explains how Iris resurrects family ghosts\nvia historiographical and hermeneutic systems. Discussing\nnarratological concerns, Ellen McWilliams (2007) reveals\nthe obstacles Iris negotiates that female writers have met tra-\nditionally, Chung-Hao Ku (2004) documents implementa-\ntions of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous's \u00e9criture f\u00e9minine bridging the\ndivide between the self and the Other, and Magali Cornier\nMichael (2010) places Iris among female writers redefining\nnarrative modes, including by, according to Shuli Barzilai\n(2010), utilizing ekphrasis to formulate meaning.\nThrough the female characters' artistically based social\nnegotiations, Bouson (2010) argues, The Blind Assassin\npresents an account of early 20th-century women's interac-\ntions with patriarchal culture, which they interrogate through\nstorytelling acts. By assembling the women's accounts, read-\ners have an opportunity to sort out Atwood's book's \"puzzle\"\nAtwood's disruption of cohesion and imposition of multiple\nvoices fragmenting the text allow readers to enact its mean-\ning. Moreover, Earl Ingersoll (2003) calls the novel a \"mys-\ntery\" for which Atwood rejects a totalistic conclusion,\nwhereas Ruth Parkin-Gounelas (2004) proposes that Iris\nintroduces deceptive memories and multiple layers into the\nnarrative to obfuscate her part in Laura's fate, and Fiona\nTolan (2010) poses Iris as the book's villain. Nevertheless,\nno one has examined how Iris's positioning of herself,\nthrough Atwood's postmodern narrative technique and ren-\ndering of point-of-view, affects readers'ability to understand\nand, thus, champion Iris as a simultaneous casualty, product,\nvillain, and usurper of her masculinist world, which she con-\nstructs and erases to refute her series of patriarchally inspired,\nspatio-temporal placements.\nGenre Considerations\nThe Blind Assassin offers a collection of interfacing texts, and\nIris's memoir, a first-person-limited narrative written in pres-\nent tense, spanning her life, and directed to her granddaugh-\nter, Sabrina, comprises its bulk, while as its outermost frame,\nIris presents another autobiographical but loosely rendered\ncontemplation of herself as an aging writer composed the\nsame year. The book, somewhat linearly assembled, is inter-\nspersed with other texts, including photographs, newspaper\narticles, and Laura's presumed novella, The Blind Assassin, a\nthird-person narrative illustrating an affair between a man and\nwoman in which the science-fiction tales of an unnamed fig-\nure resembling labor agitator and pulp writer, Alex Thomas,\nare imbedded. With the novel's mise-en-abyme structure,\nHembrough 3\nAtwood offers simultaneous discourses mirroring one another\nthematically and, according to Margaret Reynolds and\nNoakes (2002), creating a collage effect that seem to present\nanswers. Atwood renders Iris's account with historiographic\nflair, and to locate a collective \"truth\" about Iris's motiva-\ntions, readers might wish to impose a hierarchy on the book's\ninterlocking pieces. Yet, the audience will discover gaps and\ninconsistencies in the larger text, which an anonymous, inter-\nvening source has edited.\nAtwood implies that compared with male counterparts\nand even female predecessors, women writers, including\nauthors-as-characters, such as Iris, must adopt new strate-\ngies, including a reconsideration of narrative perspective.\nComposing The Blind Assassin as Iris's fragmented self-\nnarrative, Atwood, striking a hard bargain with readers-as-\nconsumers, asks them to question her text at all points. The\ngoal is to uncover facets of Iris's character as she describes\nherself as a youth, wife, sister, lover, mother, and aging\nwriter, roles that she records and enacts varyingly according\nto her changing locations and their patriarchally mandated\nagendas. Foregrounding no single identity fulfills Iris's\ndesires for self-conception, and as the novel's premier \"blind\nassassin,\" she co-opts others' stories and formulates her own\nnarrative as a victim, product, villain, and avenger. In forging\nher various presences, Iris, as a writer-assassin, is blinded to\nher work's outcome, one that destroys while promoting\nregenerative, if untold possibilities for herself and her lin-\neage. Iris contemplates her life in light of her impending\ndeath to establish a fluid persona that she can affirm and that\nfemale predecessors might validate or \"buy,\" even if they\nfind themselves, like Atwood's readers, emptyhanded after-\nwards, lacking a tangible grip on the answer-as-commodity\nto the looming question she poses concerning the nature of\nIris's subjectivity and her progeny's heritage. Forestalling\nreaders' judgment of Iris's character as she navigates the\nconfining landscapes of her postwar, patriarchal milieu,\nAtwood explores Iris's contradictory account as Iris moves\nwithin a series of multilayered, male-dominated texts to\nmold others' fates as she sees fit to propel herself and other\ncharacters to a place beyond hegemonic categorizations\nfixed by language's structures. Acting as an assassin by\noccupation, Iris writes and unwrites others' identities, along\nwith her own, leaving them open for change in ways to\nimprove her progeny's vistas and to make her \"point\" in\nclosing the reader/writer contract as a professional for hire.\nMixing Truth and Fiction, or Truth Is Fiction\nVia The Blind Assassin's innovative form, Atwood plays\nwith the audience's reader-based expectations for the novel\ngenre's conclusion, according to which members expect cer-\ntain narratorial secrets to be unfolded. In writing her nonfic-\ntional memoir and autobiography, Iris is supposed to be\nsharing \"truths\" and imparting \"realities.\" Moreover, the\nnewspaper articles, photos, and novella that she presents as\ncontext for her work should render complexity to the book to\nenact a \"whole\" or more complete picture for audience mem-\nbers, with their purchasing power and, thus, clout involving\na successful reader/writer transaction. However, in a post-\nmodern schema, every new insight that Iris poses in the book\nis one that is subject to change, as she creates, considers, and\nadvances contradictory claims about herself, family, and\ncommunity members. In the novel's present tense, Iris, a\nwriter of advanced age possessing Romantic compositional\nnotions, draws herself as a conduit for artistic impulses.\nInspired by her form, Iris moves her pen across the page and\nlets her imagination take hold. Yet, simultaneously, Iris privi-\nleges memory's place in (re)constructing the past. Art may\nbe inspired by the muse, and emotion-imbued memories\ndraw supposedly from the heart. Nonetheless, Iris's \"insight-\nfully\" wrought memoir; clandestinely presented novella;\nfable-like, science-fiction inserts; documentary-style news\nclippings, and true-as-life photos represent fictional texts,\neven though Iris keeps promising readers that she is convey-\ning accuracy in her events' rendition. For example, to show\ngratitude to Laura and Alex for the guidance they have pro-\nvided in her coming-of-age story by acting as bridges,\naccording to Chapter One's title, across which she walks, Iris\nhides the novella's authorship until the end.\nIris's advances of so-called facts are followed by their\nretractions, and Iris doctors the narrative in the same manner\nthat Laura cuts herself out of Iris's picnic photo with Alex to\nmeet both girls' desired vision of events. Readers, trying to\nunlock the book's revelation, discover history, like Iris's\nmemoir, to be produced retrospectively and mediated as\nsuch, while one is blinded to the current events' significance\nas well. The Blind Assassin's plot elements, whirling in a\nstate of flux, never add up to some culminating point and\ncorresponding moment of Joycean epiphany for audience\nmembers seeking this transactional, Modernistic experience.\nInstead, Cherene Sherrard (1999) describes the \"biomythog-\nraphy\" as a fictional \"reenvisioning of a life experience\nwhich reveals multilayered histories and collective memory\"\n(p. 130), and The Blind Assassin builds upon this genre.\nPoint-of-View Considerations\nTwentieth-century writers and narratologists have produced\npoint-of-view theories, especially regarding the first-person-\nlimited, to which Atwood reacts in postmodern fashion in\ncomposing The Blind Assassin through Iris's eyes. Henry\nRealists, argues that writers must \"represent life\" according to\nmimetic premises (p. 389). In implementing the limited view,\nJames believes, writers can fashion narrators possessing\nunique perspectives. James states, \"Humanity is immense,\nand reality has a myriad of forms . . . Experience is never\nlimited; it is never complete\" (p. 397). Calling for writers to\nexplore a character's psychological interior as opposed to\nspinning intricate, mythico-wrought plots acted out by\n4 SAGE Open\ncharacter types, James advises writers to \"try and catch the\ncolour of life itself\" by painting the perspectives of dynamic\ncharacters involved in complex, remarkable situations (p. 413).\nImplementing the first-person-limited, Realists desired to\noffer intimate portraits of characters in opposition to proto-\ntypes involving the invasive, \"objective\" presence of an\nomniscient narrator dividing characters from readers.\nHowever, Atwood takes James's tenets to their next logi-\ncal, postmodern steps. First, depicted through Iris's perspec-\ntive, Atwood questions whether either life or art, in which\npersons and pieces represent copies of copies, mimeographed\nthrough generations, can, according to Ferdinand Saussure's\nguistic models, signify anything of so-called original value.\nIn describing both her female progenitors' uncannily similar\nlifestyles and their prized museum pieces, Iris exposes the\npractices of replication perpetuating both gender roles and\nart as commodification in the novel through a series of stand-\ning forms. Abiding by the dictates of those dead and gone,\nIrisbelievessheandLaura\"werebroughtupby\"Grandmother\nAdelia, with her portrait's eyes following them, and \"her\nconception of who [they] ought to be\" (Atwood, 2000, p.\n62), replicators of her own oppressive story at the Chase\nmansion. In the book, Atwood, like James, also provides\nreaders with intimate introductions to elaborately detailed,\npsychologically complex characters, including Iris and\n\"round qualities\" (p. 103). However, Atwood refuses to\nallow readers to \"know\" her characters in that readers cannot\ntrust Iris's representation of her cast. Finally, Atwood shows\nthe million-fold choices that Iris, as protagonist, might make\nvia some Jamesian \"window of opportunity\" in her various\nabodes without Iris ever having to commit to any path.\nEncompassing the possibilities presented to her era's women,\nIris catalogs the colorful array of props and costumes she\namasses throughout life, with some serving as chapter names,\nto place herself in each social setting. Nonetheless, Iris fails\nto qualify any item as a treasured possession associated with\nsome core aspect of her \"being.\"\npresents a metaphor involving the limited view invoking a\n\"house of fiction\" offering inhabitants, peering outward,\nmultiple panoramas or sight angles. Occupants can see the\nouter landscape's aspects depicted uniquely from windows at\ndiffering levels. Depending on the window, one will have an\n\"impression distinct from any other\" (p. 52) of a given tree in\nthe yard, for example. Applying this metaphor, James,\nregarding \"truth\" as pluralistic and relativistic, argued that\nwith the limited view, authors could describe a character's\nindividualistic experiences in depth as opposed to rendering\nsociety's collective moments in generic form. Similarly, fol-\nlower Norman Friedman (1955) identifies the limited narra-\ntor as a \"fixed center\" (p. 108) or camera lens filtering the\nstory's plot to provide a \"genuine\" picture of events.\nHowever, in The Blind Assassin, Iris refuses to act as a\nJamesian membrane through which details pass fluidly to\ngrant readers free access to the narrative. Iris denies readers\nany reward of understanding she, her \"self,\" or anyone else.\nInstead of relaying \"realistic\" and \"precise\" information by\nstanding at an open window and gazing at the picturesque\nscenery from a fixed position, Iris visits all of James's win-\ndows, with some broken, others barred, and all distorting\nwomen's views. Iris's abodes, including the ancient Avilion\nand contemporarily wrought house of her husband, Richard\nGriffen, with their styles effected and manufactured, bring\nher \"pleasure,\" such as that about which she reads in\nColeridge's \"Kubla Khan\" as being a \"pleasure-dome\"\nsignifies a blue \"dome\" (p. 405) through which she cannot\nescape, at least not in league with a male figure paralleling\nthe city of Sakiel-Norn's blind assassin from the novella and\nAlex himself, one who might descend from the heavens on a\nrope to rescue her, perhaps even as an elderly woman, but\nnever does, because female characters gaze at a proverbial\nglass ceiling in the book. Still, when Laura asks questions\nabout Kubla Khan's magical landscape, Iris explains that she\nis no schoolteacher to explain its significance, in juxtaposi-\ntion to the girls' tutors, \"Miss Violence\" and Mr. Erskine,\nwho approach their academic subjects via romantic, mythical\nidealizations imposing constraints on women as tight and\nridiculous as the antiquated corset.\nModernist and postmodernist writers introduce perfora-\ntions into narrative perspective models providing greater\nvariation in the patterns that authors, including Atwood,\napply, as exemplified previously. Burkhard Niederhoff\n(2011, n.p.) describes \"intermediate cases, embeddings,\ntransgressions or unusual combinations\" of points of view,\nand other contemporary narratologists broaden perspective\ndiscussions likewise by adding ideological, lingual, percep-\ntual, and spatio-temporal factors to the calculation. Feminist\nscholar Susan Lanser (1981) explains that \"[u]nlike such tex-\ntual elements as character, plot, or imagery, point of view is\nessentially a relationship [between the seer and his or her\nobject] rather than a concrete entity\" (p. 13). Casting Iris as a\nseer possessing what Lanser calls a reciprocal \"relationship\"\nwith her patriarchally influenced objects of study involving a\nsystem of their visual, lingual, and ideological co-assess-\nment, Atwood depicts Iris as a character studying her various\nlandscapes while declining to commit to any Jamesian win-\ndow of sight, with features that limit women's storytelling\nacts. For Iris, all \"houses of fiction\" in the novel function as\ncastles of some sort, providing not only lavish enjoyment\nand protection but also the reality of imprisonment for\nwomen in clouding their \"clear\" or unimpaired vantage\npoints. At her childhood residence, Avilion, a fortress left in\nruins, Iris languishes in her role as a princess; in Richard's\ndomain, an asylum similar to Laura's mental hospital that his\nsister, Winifred, decorates, Iris hides away as Richard's wife;\nin Alex's unsafe, minimalistic, and temporary hideouts, Iris,\nhis lover, must not be seen and cannot stay; and in Iris's own\nHembrough 5\nsmall house, she secludes herself as an old witch and cannot\nnavigate the premises alone, such as by descending to the\ndungeon-like basement to launder clothing. Then, there are\nthe intrusions of those caring for Iris, such as house servants\nReenie and Myra, tasked with protecting a castle's keep.\nWhile Iris, stationed in each varying compound, peers out its\nwindows, others standing outside gaze in, too, calling atten-\ntion to the postmodern consideration that Iris's vision and,\nthus, her message to readers, wanting unrestricted access, is\nmediated at all levels. According to Jacques Lacan\ngaze,\" in contemporary landscapes, one may be aware of\nbeing watched as much as of watching. Furthermore, Michel\nFoucault (1975) offers a related incarceration-based theory\nbased on Jeremy Bentham's panopticon conceptualization,\nin which a population's members are being watched poten-\ntially at all times by an unseen eye and must decide how, if at\nall, to modify their behavior under oppressive surveilling\nsin, arriving costumed as a female to kill but then save the\nsacrificial maiden, Iris decides to modify her dress, attitude,\nand posture for each of her distinctive settings, even as she\ninterrogates and fulfills the appropriate moment's role.\nFor Lanser and Wayne Booth, an author's gender, values,\nand socioeconomic station all contribute to a text's perspec-\ntive, and in discussing characters-as-writers, such as Iris,\nincluding these components in point-of-view considerations\nis important in evaluating her narratorial persona. In assess-\nconsider the narrator's position as well as his or her psycho-\nlogical state and \"privilege\" regarding the place from which\nsome narrators boast having a more privileged location than\nothers that remain isolated, such as Iris, who finds herself on\nthe periphery, no matter her residence. Booth defines the\n\"unreliable narrator,\" one remaining at a distance from the\nculture and exhibiting a disconnect with normative values, as\nrepresenting a child or an elderly person lacking full cogni-\ntive capacities, one having a criminal background or hiding\nthe truth, and/or one possessing a psychologically impaired\nmind-set. In addition to being a first-person-limited narrator,\nIris may fit each of Booth's unreliable-narrator categories,\ndepending on the lens one applies. First, Iris offers conflict-\ning accounts tied to her multiple subjectivities, either because\nshe possesses a schism in her subjectivity in psychoanalytic\nterms, due to her performance of various conflicting wom-\nen's roles, or because she wishes to hide her part in others'\ncalamitous outcomes, such as Laura's, as in a prototypical\ndetective piece narrated from the guilty party's perspective.\nAs a second qualifier for unreliability, Iris foregrounds her\nmemory-related and age-based health issues. As an octoge-\nnarian, Iris covers a time span of nearly a century in her nar-\nrative, involving not only her own history but also that of\ngenerations prior, and there exists a spatio-temporal divide\nbetween her childhood and the present hour that raises\nmetaphysical questions about their exploration's nature. As a\nlast indicator for unreliability, Iris has never recovered from\nthe psychological effects wrought by her obsessive love\naffair with Alex, which at many points makes her unstable.\nAs a female author, Iris is also fallible according to\nEnlightenment-based ideologies silencing women's voices.\nAtwood demonstrates that Iris's patriarchal milieu would not\nhave valued her work had she presented it for review, regard-\nless of whether it comprised autobiographical or fictional\ncomponents and regardless of the style and format she\nfavored. Until Iris is writing as an elderly woman, she has not\nconsidered offering her text to readers for consideration and\ndoes not even name herself, prior to the end, as the novella's\nauthor. In postmodern terms, Iris fulfills the unreliable, fal-\nlible teller's role within her culture's masculinist constraints.\nNonetheless, Atwood assumes an arguably positive stance\ntoward Iris, a narrator exploring everything she sees but pro-\nviding no clear picture of it to critique her patriarchal back-\nshould avoid presenting any moral component to a tale,\nbecause the focalizer represents a \"window\" and \"mirror\"\nreflecting society without judgment (p. 249), narratologist\nAnsgar Nunning suggests that narrators' perspectives are\ntied inescapably to their \"psychological idiosyncrasies, atti-\nCombining Realism with Postmodernism, Iris's tableau\nincludes not only James's \"portrait of a lady,\" one such as the\naristocratic Isabel Archer, who must \"affron[t] her destiny\"\na prostitute, miscreant, and an orphan.\nNarrating From Within the House of\nFiction: A Room With No View\nWhile Forster (1908) penned A Room With a View to indicate\nthe importance for the contemplative, upper-class protago-\nnist, Lucy Honeychurch, of having a \"view\" in her travels,\nfemale author needs \"a room of one's own\" in an essay of\nthat title, according to The Blind Assassin's postmodern out-\nlook, having a window does not grant one the means of sight\nfor women narrating their stories.\nAt Avilion: Iris as a Youth, Sister, and Cultural\nCasualty\nAt the novel's outset, Iris posits herself, like Laura, as a casu-\nalty of social strictures to gain readers'sympathy and present\nherself as a likeable narrator-protagonist poised to fulfill the\nbook's heroic role, which traditional readers expect in\nChambers's reader/writer contract's terms. As a victim of\nothers' wrongdoings and failures, Iris grows up at Avilion,\nnamed according to Adelia's Modernist, fairytale-founded,\nArcadian notions. In having Avilion constructed, Adelia may\nhave envisioned King Arthur's island from Tennyson's Idylls\n6 SAGE Open\nof the King, a narrative the girls read. As a protected location,\nTennyson's fantastical retreat does not suffer from Nature's\nravages, but the Chase estate, and Iris, as its inhabitant, is\nless fortunate. When Iris is nine, Liliana, her mother, dies,\nand when Iris reaches 18, her father, Norval, faces bank-\nruptcy in the 1930s depression. In the end, the Chase facto-\nries are disbanded. Reenie seeks another job and marries\nafter setting, like Iris's other female forbearers, a patriar-\nchally inspired, if rebellious, example of women's suffering\nand compliance in maintaining antiquated standards and\nplaying a wife to Norval and a mother to the girls. When\nNorval dies, Iris and Laura must fend for themselves, and\nLaura translates the maxim, \"there's no place like home,\" to\nmean that home cannot exist as a location for them (Atwood,\nherself that \"[h]ome is where the heart is,\" but because, as an\naging woman, she has become \"heartless,\" she is hence\n\"homeless\" (p. 447). The novel offers the sisters no comfort-\ning place and no secure point-of-view in any known, mascu-\nlinist realm, whether earthly, heavenly, or mythical.\nNevertheless, the premise that Iris, being heartless and\nhomeless like Sakiel-Norn's blind assassins, possesses no\nresidence at Avilion, can allow her female descendants to\npicture themselves elsewhere and anywhere.\nAlthough Iris loses the Chase house representing her\ninheritance, she does not feel comfortable there, especially\nonce Richard, its new owner via marriage, begins to revamp\nit. Eventually, Avilion serves as an assisted-living facility\ncalled \"Valhalla,\" signifying a place of eternal feasting for\nmale warriors, such as Norval, an alcoholic wounded in an\noverseas conflict pursued to defend the home front. This\nhome represents one that Iris, a veteran's daughter and not a\nwar hero herself, must leave. Nevertheless, Iris assumes that\nsmokers will burn down the house and destroy its history\nassociated with male-dominated, Victorian purposes.\nMeanwhile, the button factory, of which Iris is dispossessed\nsimilarly after it did catch fire, is salvaged and becomes a\ntourist attraction, allowing onlookers to gaze upon the past\nwithout experiencing it. Inside, Myra owns a souvenir shop\ncalled the Gingerbread House, like that depicted in Hansel\nand Gretel, where instead of hungry children, old ladies,\nincluding Iris, feast upon art and history generated for con-\nsumptive purposes, as if to memorialize themselves through\nreminiscent fabrications of some ideal form. Like Iris evalu-\nating the yesteryear via simulations of its bric-a-brac, Derrida\n(1976) presents a deconstruction-based theory posing a gap\nbetween the signifier and signified, according to which, he\nexplains, a thing cannot resemble its name. Even the town\nitself, named after a defeated battle hero, represents an\nemblematic loss. Iris's masculinist-constructed, childhood\nhome was never hers in the first place. Shelley Boyd (2013)\ncompares The Blind Assassin and Shakespeare's King Lear,\nand in both works, the daughters face their estates' destruc-\ntion. King Lear represents a genre tragedy, with Goneril kill-\ning Regan and ending her own life, but Laura's end and Iris's\nsubsequent disappearance invite a reading of the scenario in\nwhich Iris's heirs write open futures because of their king-\ndom's forfeiture.\nAnalyzing her early years, Iris invokes herself as a pawn\nmoved around the board by characters embroiled in a mascu-\nlinist society, including her parents, even if this version of\nherself, in postmodern terms, represents as much of a con-\nstruction as do the other characters' recordings. Still, Iris's\ngrandfather, Benjamin, who depicts the button factory's his-\ntory in his gold-embossed book, and Adelia, who fashions\nscrapbooks memorializing girls' debuts in elegant dresses,\nimprint their identities upon Iris, regarding their texts as\nquaint but curiously forceful. In the \"Avilion\" chapter, Iris\nlists the miscellaneous objects that Laura finds in collecting\ntokens on Avilion's uninhabited premises later on, as if Laura\nis trying to locate pieces of a story concerning how the sisters\nbecame victims of their male-invoked fate and how they\nmight save some treasure representing their \"true\" essence\nwith which to describe and value themselves. However,\nmany trifles that Laura recovers are associated with tradi-\ntional female roles, and these items' displacement from their\nlocations within the Chase home is positive for Iris's descen-\ndants'futures, which may place heirs beyond the household's\nconfines. In an interview, Atwood likens the novel genre's\nform to a \"capacious container\" (Gussow, 2000, p. B7), and\nhere, it represents one that Iris attempts to fill with a past as\nvast and random in matter as the memorabilia littering\nAvilion's rooms. Amid The Blind Assassin's narrative's clut-\nter, readers wanting answers about Iris may pan for clues that\nnever surface, and despite her ruminations, Iris discovers that\n\"[i]t is no longer possible to know\" the nature of her story's\nelements, such as the terms of her parents' relationship spe-\nlack of knowledge on readers' parts could lead to a failure of\nIris's narrative in Chambers's transactional terms, Atwood\nimplies that leaving women's questions unresolved provides\nthem with the benefit of their retaining no permanent, invia-\nble answers.\nAt Richard's Palace and Alex's Rooms: Iris as a\nWife, Mistress, and Social Product\nAvilion's dining-room's stained-glass windows, picturing\nthe tragic fairytale lovers, Iseult and Tristan, offer Iris a col-\nored, romantic world receding from view as she becomes an\nadult with a classical bent that she foregrounds in her narra-\ntive to challenge depictions of her victimization and posit\nherself as her masculinist culture's product. Still, in leaving\nAvilion, Iris enters houses with clear, glass windowpanes\ntransparent in nature but no less opaque for women's pur-\nposes of viewing their worlds. Having failed in business,\nNorval, who married a woman of his choice, urges Iris to tie\nherself to Richard, an older business associate she hardly\nknows. The Chase patriarch sacrifices Iris to save his pride,\nif not his legacy, in terms of the mansion and factory.\nHembrough 7\nLikewise, in Alex's parallel saga on Planet Zycron, set 8,000\nyears before, power shifts are ever present: The rising aris-\ntocracy threatens the ruling class, and men treat women\nabjectly, from the sacrificial maidens to the king's mistress\nherself, who he plans to sell into slavery, because \"every-\nthing was for sale,\" in the city's epicenter (p. 28). In Luce\nIrigaray's (1998) Marxist-based theory concerning women's\nobjectification and marketplace commodification, men\nexchange women, who are displayed for social consumption,\nas commodities: In a male-dominated culture, mothers hold\na use value, virgins an exchange value, and prostitutes pos-\nsess both. Similarly, during the novel, Iris, first as a virgin\nand then as a wife and mother, fulfills, in Irigaray's terms,\nher \"value\" as a social product.\nIf marrying Richard makes Iris, barely an adult, a victim,\nshe also represents an outcome of culturally enacted norms,\nas she considers her fate, as well as that of her father, sister,\nReenie, and the button-factory workers, in reviewing her\noptions as a woman facing displacement and replacement\nwithin male-centered realms. As a female character, Iris is\ndefined, according to Judith Butler's theory of gender con-\nceptions, not only by sex but also by socioeconomic status,\nethnicity, and other identity aspects comprising gender, an\nideation formulated by social strictures as opposed to being\ngenerated by personhood (Butler, 2004). Yet, like Sakiel-\nNorn's virgins, singing about \"absence and silence\" (Atwood,\n2000, p. 29), the king's mistress, requesting courtship-inspired\npoems that he fails to pen, and perhaps even the king's wife,\nmentioned only briefly, as if she possesses no desires, Iris dis-\ncovers that the noble gesture of self-sacrifice she offers in\nbecoming a wife is meaningless to everyone involved, includ-\ning her family, community, and Richard. When Laura tints\nIris's wedding photos, making them appear hyperreal, Iris is\nupset that her pictures, serving as \"clues and evidence\" for\nNevertheless, despite her position as a social product, Iris\ncannot \"recall having been present\" at the ceremony at all\nher compliance with her role as Richard's wife. Betty Friedan\n(1963) depicts the emptiness that Iris encounters as a house-\nwife during this era as \"the problem that has no name\"; for\nFriedan, the \"silent question\" that housewives were asking\nthemselves concerning their state was, \"`Is this all?'\" (p. 15).\nIn The Blind Assassin, Iris as a wife searches for something\nelse, too, if locating no new function for herself that might\ncrystallize forms for female heirs.\nWhen Iris moves to Richard's house, a refurbished, con-\ntemporary palace of his choosing and purchase, Iris is no less\nready to call this space her own. The Griffen abode, decorated\nin pearly shades, prefigures Laura's Bella Vista hospital room,\nand its sanitized, airy, heavenly nature is no more freeing\nthan Iris's ancestors' heavy, ornamented fortress rendered as\nValhalla in Norse mythology. Even as wallpaper patterns and\npaint colors change with the era, for Iris, the roles for women\nand the windows out of which they gaze at their prospects do\nnot. Indeed, Iris mentions that the Griffen garden, a landscape\nwomen before her must have observed similarly while impris-\noned in the bedroom, remains unaltered. When Iris designs its\nplot, she discovers she has no plans for it, because her person\nhas been co-opted systematically by those making every deci-\nsion for her, from clothing choices to grooming practices.\nWinifred, both decorating Richard's palace and bedecking\nIris's body as temples, might appear at any time, as if Winifred\ndoes not possess her own space either, and under Winifred's\ninfluence, Iris is expected, like an expensive piece of furni-\nture, to bear the weight of a masculinist regime wishing her to\nbe gracious, dependent, submissive, and virginal. Feeling her-\nself \"erased, featureless, like an oval of used soap, or the\nbathroom, a room without windows, first prior to her wedding\nnight, then on her honeymoon, and at the Griffen abode,\nbecause her view is blocked at every angle by Richard, the\nnew king, or his sister, the High Priestess in the Sakiel-Norn\nallegory. Although Richard requires Iris for the bedroom's\nsexual pleasures, she remains peripheral to him, while\nWinifred, roaming the premises, is \"necessary\" (p. 331).\nNevertheless, in the novel, writing and secretion practices\noffer a means for women to gain subjectivity (Ku, 2004), and\nin advancing age, Iris, visiting the donut shop's bathroom,\naligns washroom writing acts with composing messages to\nother occupants sharing this private space for urination and\ndefecation. Because the messages presented, representing\nscribbles, lack clear meaning, women may interpret them\nhowever they want, validating their perspective decisions,\nwhatever these may be.\nAs Richard's romantic partner, Iris finds that her marriage\ntransaction goes unrecorded in \"official\" historical accounts,\nsuch as the one that Benjamin offers in his leather-bound\nbook relaying economic success. Gothic literature focuses on\nthe motifs of what Gina Wisker (2012) calls \"pursuit, terror,\npower, and the potential of real rape\" (pp. 51-52), and Iris's\nand Richard's union represents what Wisker might deem a\nIris, maintained in one masculinist stronghold or another,\nstays indoors mostly and looks out windows at what lies\nbeyond, her suffering in marriage is not only veiled from\npublic view but also exists as an acceptable version of the\ncontract itself, a context precluding Iris from fashioning her-\nself simply as a martyr. Still, in Butler's (2004) theory of\ngender as involving a performative act allowing one to func-\ntion within social boundaries, Iris cannot signify her gender\nand lay claim to any value supposedly associated with it, for\nbetter or worse, despite her entrenchment in the book's vary-\ning locations linked to traditional female functions. While\nIris's fate in marriage is perhaps no worse than that of\nLaura's, who Richard sends to a mental institution for refus-\ning the place he fashions for her, a bedroom festooned in\npink, Laura becomes a saint for her later supposed suicide,\nwhile Iris, in old age, is left as the town's recluse. Of the\nsisters, Laura represents the more independent, stubborn, and\n8 SAGE Open\ngiving character, attempting to avoid the patriarchal Griffen\nlandscape by escaping on the train and providing for herself\nby working at a fair. There, Laura makes the donuts of which\nIris finds herself to be the center, absent of features. Iris nei-\nther aligns herself with the sacrificial maiden's role, nor does\nshe become the predatory opportunist Winifred plays, either.\nAvoiding these dualisms as exemplary of her lineage's\noptions, Iris invokes and mimics both offices in turn.\nNonetheless, Richard, a foil to the Chase men and sweat-\nshop tycoon, compensates Iris, an aristocratic wife, with new\nmoney. As a social product, Iris benefits from the \"sale\" of\nher person via what Irigaray (1998) describes as the market\nexchange's terms, ones not unlike Chambers's reader/writer\ncontract in which both parties possess obligations and\nexpect returns. While Laura colors Richard's photograph\ngreen to indicate his financial appetites, and green signifies\nBenjamin's book's shade, Iris also conforms to her newest\npart, having acting lessons, clothes, and makeup, along with\nthe house Richard purchases to replace the one she left,\nwhich, \"out of sight,\" is also \"out of mind\" for her until\nNorval dies, Laura phones, and Iris reconsiders her alliances.\nHaving given herself over to outward appearances like the\nChase and Griffen houses to be remodeled, Iris dresses styl-\nishly and applies potions to soften her hands and brighten her\nface. Simone Beauvior (1997), discussing women's concep-\ntions, argues that \"[t]he social significance of the toilette\nallows woman to express, by her way of dressing, her atti-\ntude toward society. If she is submissive to the established\norder, she will assume a discreet and stylish personality\" (p.\n547). In their storytelling,Alex compares Iris, who he implies\nis a \"pampered society bride,\" to Sakiel-Norn's sacrificial\nvirgins: Both ceremoniously \"fulfill [their] duties with deco-\ntemple-residence rites, and as a new wife, Iris is seduced by\nthe popular culture depicted in women's magazines to mirror\nits modes. Capitalism engineers one's gender and thus one's\nstory, and, according to Isabel Carrera (1994), Iris represents\nnot only a product but also a consumer who consumes.\nFollowing matriarchal leads dictated by patriarchal codes,\nIris, a cultural product, acts as a hostess, housewife, and,\neventually, mother at Richard's palace. Iris represents a rich,\nnominally educated socialite, yet, to her credit, in postmod-\nern terms, she remains unrefined and unimpressed by her\nsurrounding system of patriarchal enterprise and industry. At\nthe Chase home, Iris had confused original masterpieces\nwith fabricated classics, and she possesses no relationship\nwith the museums, buildings, and high-culture artifacts\nRichard dispatches her to see for educational purposes on\ntheir honeymoon. Both Irigaray (1985), describing women\nas the \"sex which is not one,\" and Cixous (1975), calling for\nwomen to implement \u00e9criture f\u00e9minine, founded on the origi-\nnal relationship that women, as language teachers, possess\nwith their children, posit that in a patriarchally inscribed uni-\nverse, women are constructed by numerous forces, least of\nall themselves. Yet, in \"actuality,\" Iris possesses no real\n\"self\" at all to assert as a female character contained in mas-\nculinist spaces. Iris's only escape lies in tending a rock-filled\ngarden, a barren landscape, where she holds no responsibility\nto nurture anything living, from the perspective of her cul-\nture's fatherly origins, back to the primordial Garden of\nEden. Still, stones may roll, and Sakiel-Norn's vanished peo-\nple could live beneath their city's rubble. Years later,\nRichard's house with its \"squinty\" windows (Atwood, 2000,\np. 295), from which Iris, as a wife, had difficulty seeing,\nboasts a broken, second-floor pane allowing for the possible\ndeparture, one Iris herself never made, of some female\nresident.\nRichard's house serves as Iris's prison, and she walks\nabout town, enters shops, and attends movies to escape it,\neven though she is subject to male purview in these public\nareas. Iris cannot express her \"self\" in Alex's changing series\nof rooms either, because there she assumes an identity as his\nmistress while retaining her function as Richard's wife. Iris\ndoes not possess her own place, and there is no location\nwhere she might meet Alex on \"free\" ground in some alter-\nnate space that she and Alex, as storytellers, might invent\ntogether to empower men and women equally. Indeed,\nZycron's inhabitants of an alternate universe later people\nEarth. Having fled Richard's palace, Iris hides in Alex's\nhovel-like sanctuaries, located often on the town's wrong\nside but offering furnishings that seem offputtingly similar to\nIris, if of lesser quality, like the shoes worn by the street's\nwomen exhibiting their perambulation's value and nature.\nThe narratives that the lovers tell to release themselves of the\ntedium and duress of their affair's constraints become barri-\ners demarcating their respective gender roles, and Iris real-\nizes that there is little difference between her marriage to\nRichard and liaison with Alex, men dedicated to their given\noccupations and not to her. Alex, both like Richard and the\nalien creature Alex himself invents for his stories, \"love[s]\"\nIris by attempting to \"assimilate her\" into himself (p. 279),\nand while Iris resists Alex's mission to possess her, she never\nescapes his gravitational pull, one as strong and bright as the\nApollonian sun of masculinist truth in Nietzsche's\nWhile Alex signifies his own milieu's outcome, Iris repre-\nsents his mistress and a prostitute, according to her jokes and\nIrigaray's (1998) portrayal of women's use values, with pros-\ntitutes having both male exchange and use purposes. As in\nbeing paired with Richard, Iris remains contained within the\nsame patriarchal strictures.\nIn the novella, the maiden trusts the assassin to lead her\nfrom the castle, even though outside the city gates, there lies\nas much danger as within. Yet, Iris is unable to abandon her\ncomfortable metropolitan lifestyle, and neither does Alex\nwish to take Iris with him to an open, foreign country. Like\n\"Kubla Khan's\" lover, Alex, whose name means \"to aid,\" is\nabsent when needed. Meanwhile, similar to Adelia, Iris pos-\nbecause everything belongs to Richard via marriage, and Iris\nHembrough 9\nis unwilling to get a paying job herself. Indeed, as a waitress,\na role Laura suggested for the two sisters, Iris's obligation\nwould be to serve all men, instead of a handful. Before\ndeparting for Spain, Alex asks Iris to leave Richard and his\nhouse, but she declines. In reply, Alex decides that if Iris\nwere to get a room, he would obsess about other men pos-\nsessing her through their gaze instead of him or Richard. No\nmatter where Iris travels in her contemporary world, she\nremains a captive of some masculinist-created stronghold,\nwhileAlex, slipping among apartments to avoid detection for\nhis Communist leanings, the tenor of which remains murky,\nis less impeded. When Alex flees to Spain, his fate remains\nopen. Iris expects his reappearance until receiving the tele-\ngram, which does not provide the confirmation of his death\nthat a body's return would. It is easy for Alex as a younger\naged male to vanish, his corporal form missing, yet the\nelderly Iris imagines death via heart failure as the path to\nfreedom from the patriarchally sewn cloaks that she has\ndonned and exchanged as so many costumes.\nBefore news of Alex's death, Iris imagined getting an\napartment with her daughter, Aimee, above a grocer's store\nto await Alex, and, once, Iris dreams that he or his semblance\nappears at her tower-like residence of an unknown location,\nwhere she considers sneaking out of the bedroom window to\nIris does not want to drop into the night or, later, tumble\nalone into her cellar as an aging woman facing the end,\nalthough, in this state, women's possibilities for journeys\nmight present themselves more openly, Atwood suggests, as\none enters a state of mental darkness, and the \"self\" disinte-\ngrates. Both sisters live with Richard while setting their\nsights on Alex, and the romantic Laura dies when she loses\nAlex, while Iris, steeped in classicism, pines in old age. Like\nIseult, Laura assumedly commits suicide, and Iris decon-\nstructs her \"self\" as a woman alone in her tomb-like house.\nIn the book, Iris resides in various tower-like structures\nsheltering but imprisoning her. The mythical Rapunzel\nmakes herself accessible to male rescuers, yet Iris does not\noffer any hand in her escape, because she foresees having\nnowhere to go. In The Blind Assassin, Iris is rendered a zero,\na space defined by absence, the scooped-out egg. She acts as\nthe indefinable male obsession: Alex \"invents[s]\" and\n\"makes[s] her up\" as with his stories' characters (Atwood,\nand her lineage with options: Even as Iris contemplates being\nwith Alex, she hopes to forget her name, to black out and\nfloat in space, as \"[s]he render[s] herself up, is blotted out\"\nwished for happy endings, yet she will not receive one her-\nself, because reaching foregone conclusions involves writing\nstories that then have been told. When Alex argues that all\nstories terminate with wolves, Iris refuses to agree with him.\nInstead, claiming that there are other endings without specu-\nlating about their essence, she leaves her descendants' fates\nopen to unfold as they will.\nAt an Unspecified Location: Iris as (Not) a\nMother and Villain\nOn her honeymoon, Iris, without foreknowledge, stays at a\nhotel later associated with Paris's Nazi headquarters.\nMoreover, she describes Richard as a fascist. However, com-\nposing a self-narrative, Iris also writes of \"her struggle\" from\nher jail-cell-as-small-house to inspire future generations to\nremember her. From the beginning, Iris acknowledges her\nsignificance not only as a casualty and product of her mascu-\nlinist system but also a villain in its terms. Nonetheless, psy-\nchoanalyst Jessica Benjamin (1998) describes a scenario\ninvolving \"the bonds of love\" in which all parties in a liaison\nare complicit in adhering to and recapitulating acts of domi-\nnation because they do not recognize them as such: Even\nwhen parties espouse equality and personal autonomy, they\nmay apply a set of dominating strategies with sexual partners,\nfamily members, and community relations. Still, Iris raises\nquestions of where to draw the line between being compliant\nto and forming an alliance with the Griffens once she believes\nRichard had been raping Laura. With Iris's professed inability\nto protect Laura, if also herself and later Aimee, Iris flees\nRichard's palace. Iris cannot abscond to Alex's rooms now\nthat he is gone, nor return to the Chase mansion, never refur-\nbished, even though Laura admits to having lived there after\nBella Vista. When Iris leaves Richard, an unacceptable act for\na woman of her stature and purposed grounds, because\nLaura's novella is unpublished, and Richard remains above\nsuspicion, Atwood places Iris in no notable space at all.\nAlthough victorious, Iris remains vague concerning her\ndowngraded living circumstances, which she has detailed in\nexcess, down to the items she packs in her suitcase to travel\nfrom one residence to another in earlier periods, such as with\nher honeymoon. Iris provides no clear timeline demarcating\nher new independence, even though she has referenced his-\ntorical events as backdrops anchoring her spatio-temporally\nto prior scenes, such as World War I, either.\nAs a woman with a small house but someone without a\nknown social residence, Iris represents an outlaw without\nrefuge, even though she pits Richard as the novel's darker\nforce. Although Iris's location remains remote, if her own,\nduring Aimee's early childhood, Iris does not skip town and\nthe masculinist constraints and figures associated with it.\nIndeed, Winifred, with legal support, seizes Aimee subse-\nquent to Iris leaving her home territory and sharing a bed\nwith an unnamed man at a hotel in a maneuver placing her,\nas both a mother and so-called prostitute, beyond masculine\nuse values in Irigaray's market-exchange theory. In the\nnovel, Iris does not represent the traditional mother figure\ntaking steadfast care of her wards; she critiques Liliana,\nrejects the matriarchal part with Laura, watches her daughter\nbe removed, and finds herself barred from involvement with\nSabrina. Nevertheless, because Iris both reaches out to her\ngranddaughter through writing but avoids assuming an\noverly directive tact toward her in prototypical terms, Iris,\nwho might be called a villain in masculinist terms, allows\ndescendants to depict a mother's role in broader strictures or\nrefuse it totally.\nAt the Small House: Iris as a Writer, Assassin,\nand an Avenger\nRegardless of the years' passage, Iris's cottage, like\nColeridge's pleasure dome, retains its masculinist structure\nproviding limited sightlines for women. Yet, it is at Iris's lit-\ntle house where she assumes a writer's personality to address\nLaura's case as well as her own. In The Blind Assassin, as\nwith William Faulkner's (1936) novel, Absalom, Absalom!,\nreaders must assemble the book's events and assign blame\nfor family members' misfortunes spanning multiple genera-\ntions. Reading represents a decoding act, but Faulkner's nar-\nrative's structure, like Atwood's, remains one of mirrors and\nendless reflections. After The Blind Assassin's digressions\nand detours, readers return to its puzzle concerning Laura's\ndeath presented in the first sentence. Where did Laura go,\nand why? The mystery as to whether Laura committed sui-\ncide and, if so, who is to blame remains unsolved, to Iris's\nbenefit, detriment, and sense of affected removal from the\nso-called crime scene. In Atwood's Alias Grace (Atwood,\n1996), a novel with a similar theme portraying a female char-\nacter involved with criminal circumstances, readers never\nlearn whether Grace Marks is guilty of the murders of her\nemployer and his housekeeper/mistress either. Grace, like\nIris, represents both a \"villain\" and a \"victim\" (Cooke, 1998,\ncerned similarly with the narrator's former lover's suicide\nand the corresponding nature of the couple's involvement.\nIris's name derives from the eye's black-hole center, signify-\ning an expanse beyond mapped locations, and in her varied\nsettings, Iris portrays herself as a victim, product, and villain.\nNow, as a writer-as-blind-assassin, Iris will avenge her\nfemale line. In keeping secrets, representing logocentrically\nconstructed knowledge gaps, and telling lies, signifying dis-\nplacements of masculinist truths, Iris chooses a middle\nground for herself, never accepting nor defying any one self-\ncharacterization. Iris's ability to, as Butler (2004) puts it, per-\nform and \"trouble\" her gender allows her to play diverging\nroles supporting and undermining women's stances.\nIn The Blind Assassin, a postmodern narrative about\nsomeone constructing a narrative, Iris assumes her function\nas a writer-killer undertaking the task of character assassina-\ntion to dispel singularly defined female constructs. Indeed,\nas a writer, Iris is intent on, if unable and even unwilling to,\nunderstand and convey Laura's persona. Iris remarks that\nLaura possesses the same traits as the average person, except\nthat Laura refuses to hide her essence, a feature that Iris finds\n\"frighten[ing]\" to others (Atwood, 2000, p. 89). Also, Iris is\njealous of her alter-ego, who utilizes Iris's property, from her\nnail file, hairbrush, and car to the white gloves that Laura\nwears to her death to nullify any fingerprints associated with\nher location, one now beyond the pale. By the conclusion,\nthe sisters are conflated, so that any damage Iris does in\naffecting Laura's death, Iris renders to herself. Iris represents\nher sister's maker and savior but also her grim reaper, and\nIris creates and removes many of the book's agents, includ-\ning Laura, from their hegemonic settings to free them from\nthe masculinist lines of which they cannot break loose them-\nselves. Ultimately, Iris believes that she does not own the \"I\"\nin her name in the manner that Laura wields the \"L\" (p. 88),\nbecause everyone possesses an \"I\" with which to tell one's\nstory. Yet, Iris's name's expansiveness leads her to become\nan avenger of women and a leader at their forefront's cause,\nwhatever that might be.\nLike many of Atwood's novels, The Blind Assassin deals\nwith social strictures, whether women accept these stan-\ndards, and how they will be judged if refusing to comply.\nOften, Atwood's female characters face bleak futures and\nview themselves as having fractured identities (Deery, 1997,\np. 4). However, Iris, grappling with multiple subjectivities\nand choosing none, is empowered, not dysfunctional, in her\nfluctuating state. Iris contemplates Laura as another version\nof her \"self,\" and Atwood presents comparisons between the\nprotagonist and female family members, such as Liliana and\nWinifred, too, propelling Iris to contemplate her personali-\nty's set of fissures based on these outliers. Besides likening\nherself to family, Iris divides herself still further upon seeing\nwomen, who she resembles, walking the street, too. The\nbreaches in Iris's semblance allow her to represent a large,\ndiverse female sphere as opposed to rendering her a casualty\nin terms of Lacan's (1985) mirror stage theory, in which peo-\nple are damaged, if left enlightened, upon discovering their\n\"novel is fundamentally concerned with the idea of selfhood\nas a narrative construction or invention\", and as an octoge-\nnarian, Iris posits herself as being \"perfect\" and in her prime\navailable to female characters but assumed no single cast.\nAssassin possesses an \"absence of viable role models\".\nNevertheless, this lack of inspiring prototypes renders Iris\nfree of the masculinist-constructed identities for women that\nshe attempts, deconstructs, and finally explodes in the book.\nMany ofAtwood's (1969) novels, such as The Edible Woman,\ninvoke a society demanding that women choose between\nmarriage and having a career, yet as a widow and writer, Iris\nassumes both of these roles, along with others, and problem-\natizes each via its appropriate locale.\nIn reliving her past, Iris believes that she is gaining insight\ninto her affairs. However, Iris also reveals her \"wish to con-\nceal,\" one common to others holding secret knowledge of\ntheir backgrounds. Then, she admits that what she has writ-\nten is \"wrong\"; the \"truth\" is missing, because Iris's message\nrepresents \"a voice outside the window\" (Atwood, 2000, pp.\n448, 395). Alternately, Iris confesses that she is buried alive\nin the so-called information she has amassed. As a writer\nexploring and judging her past and Atwood's novel's pro-\ntagonist, Iris represents a \"remembering self\" recalling her\n\"historical self\" as she veers between \"self-reproach and the\ndesire to justify or vindicate herself\" (Robinson, 2006, n.p.).\nNonetheless, Iris's compiling of logocentric knowledge\nleaves her speechless and confused, because, as a female\nwriter, she both lacks information concerning women's\naffairs, reproducible in feminine lights, and possesses it in\nexcess. Iris represents an unreliable, fallible narrator, unable\nto assemble the \"full\" details of Laura's death. Hence, in tra-\nditional terms, Iris's culpability in Laura's tragedy is blunted\nand diffused. Nonetheless, with her position as protagonist-\nnarrator decentered, Iris resigns any claim to male-enacted\nlegitimacy and Socratic-based insight. In the face of readers'\nexpectations for the novel genre, Iris offers no singular secret\nto be revealed and no one case to make. Instead, as a writer-\nassassin, she builds and destroys the book's characters,\nincluding herself, morphing from the young princess in the\ncastle to the aging witch in the gingerbread house to render\nwomen's possibilities open.\nIris as a Vanished Writer: The\nConclusion and Beginning\nBecause The Blind Assassin possesses discontinuous narra-\ntives and multiple viewpoints, Iris cannot create a\nModernistic, totalistic effect for her story and so tell a defin-\nitive and perhaps redeeming story about herself for which\nreaders, once satisfied, may acquit her of her failings. The\ndiverse facets of Iris's character, linked with Atwood's\nbook's structure, may affect her believability and likeability\nas a storyteller for readers choosing to view her as a custom-\nary narrator. Instead, Atwood forces audience members to\nreconsider their \"normative\" reading practices in light of the\nbook's narrative perspective and forms. While Iris repre-\nsents a narrator with a first-person-limited, fallible view, a\nfemale character marginalized by socioeconomic and fam-\nily-related circumstances, in postmodern terms, all first-\nperson narrators become \"unreliable\" and untrustworthy.\nPossessing a faulty memory and shifting views, as a blind\nkiller, Iris dispels any meaning she creates and posits no one\naccount. In commencing the writing of her book, Iris states\nthat she has no audience in mind and that \"[t]hings written\nonly through the destruction of gender norms that Iris's line\nmay generate beginnings. In the novella, the maiden escapes\nher city before the truth about her absence can be discov-\nered, while Iris hides her authorship from town residents.\nThe maiden's secret brings destruction to Sakiel-Norn, and\nIris's tale causes Richard's downfall, even his death, as well\nas the loss of her daughter and social position. Despite\nenacting their own personal and cultural tragedies, the\nmaiden and Iris face fates unknown and undescribed. At\nfirst, Iris does not imagine her readers, but later she admits\nher wish to make her book available to Myra and Sabrina.\nIris hopes to avenge herself and Laura through an act of\nwriting, signifying \"a commemoration of wounds endured\navoid affixing potential readers, such as Sabrina, with iden-\ntities solidified in masculinist terms, Iris avoids imagining\nSabrina's future life after envisioning her entering the door\nfor their first meeting.\nBy leaving Iris's identity and The Blind Assassin's tenor\nopen ended, Atwood creates a living story for women where\nnothing is finalized, and later, the unnamed editor and artist\ncan gather up and strew Iris's collected works throughout the\nnovel as a pastiche representing Iris's bright, jagged \"[s]\nhards\" invoking a place called \"home\" (Atwood, 2000, p.\n57). In assisting Laura to enact her fate, Iris kills and sends\nher sister to a different and perhaps superior location beyond\nthe page before traveling there herself. While Hamlet was\nafraid of entering the \"unknown country,\" Atwood implies\nthat to affect changes for women, characters such as Iris must\nenter open spaces to expand the options of those remaining\nin the living world. Looking at the picnic photograph, Iris\nremarks,\nThe picture is of happiness, the story not. Happiness is a garden\nwalled with glass: there's no way in or out. In Paradise there are\nno stories, because there are no journeys. It's loss and regret and\nmisery and yearning that drive the story forward, along its\nFor an assassin, killing is amoral.
