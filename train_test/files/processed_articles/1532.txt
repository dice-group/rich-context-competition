For men, aging is largely a partnered\nexperience. The majority of men experience aging, illness, and\ndeath with their life partner. In contrast, many women experi-\nence their later years alone (Lindau et al., 2007). The implica-\ntions of these gender differences for health in later life are\npoorly understood. The National Social Life, Health, and Ag-\ning Project (NSHAP) was designed, in part, to identify bio-\nlogical mechanisms through which social, including intimate\nand sexual, relationships affect health as women and men age.\nCollection of sensory function measures (olfaction, gus-\ntatory function, vision, tactile sensation) (Schumm et al., in\nreview), salivary sex hormone measures (estrogen, testos-\nterone, progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone) (Gavrilova\n& Lindau, in review), and vaginal mucosal measures in a\nsingle, population-based study of older adults is novel to\nNSHAP and reflects the study's orientation toward under-\nstanding the physiology of social and sexual relationships\nand a focused interest in addressing largely neglected areas\nof older women's health.\nHere, we provide the initial detailed description of the ra-\ntionale and methods for vaginal self-swab specimen collec-\ntion in the NSHAP study, as well as applications of these data\nfor health research. Design and implementation of the vagi-\nnal self-swab protocol including transportation, methods for\nselecting, training, and supporting field staff in vaginal swab\ncollection, laboratory procedures and coordination, and a re-\nsults reporting system are described. Specimens were ana-\nlyzed for bacterial vaginosis (BV), vaginal candidiasis (VC)\nor yeast, high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV), and cy-\ntological characteristics. Participant cooperation, specimen\nadequacy, and explanations of missing data are reported.\nThe first wave of NSHAP, conducted between July 2005\nand March 2006, included collection of vaginal specimens\nfrom female respondents. Vaginal specimens provide\nmicrobiologic material, including fungal, viral, and bacte-\nrial pathogens that can be deleterious for women's health\nand functioning.

To describe the methods used for, cooperation with, assays conducted on, and applications of vaginal\nspecimens collected by older women in their homes.\nMethods. Community-residing women (N = 1,550), ages 57\u00ad85 years, participated in a nationally representative prob-\nability survey. Vaginal self-swab specimen collection and in-home interviews were conducted between 2005 and 2006.\nSpecimens were analyzed for bacterial vaginosis (BV), vaginal candidiasis (VC), high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-\nHPV), and cytological characteristics. Field methods, consent procedures, the swab protocol, laboratory procedures, and\nresults reporting are described.\nResults. One thousand twenty-eight respondents (67.5% weighted) agreed to provide a vaginal specimen; 99.1% were\nsuccessful. The specimen adequacy rates were BV and VC, 94.1%; HR-HPV, 99.7%; and cytology, 85.5%. The most\ncommon recorded reason for nonparticipation was a physical or health problem (38% of nonresponders). Responders\nwere significantly more likely than nonresponders to be younger and more educated, and were more likely to report a\nrecent pelvic examination, menopausal hormone use, and recent sexual activity.\nDiscussion. Collection of vaginal self-swab specimens from older women in a population-based study is feasible and\nprovides novel data on microenvironmental characteristics of the female genital tract relevant to analyses of gynecologic\nhealth, sexual activity and problems, and immune and inflammatory function.\nKey Words: Vaginal swab--Vaginal cytology--Self-collection--Methods--Protocol--Older women--Population.\nanalyses) performed on the NSHAP vaginal swab speci-\nmens, including BV, VC or yeast, human papillomavirus,\nand vaginal cellular characteristics (cytology), follows.\nBV is a common polymicrobial condition of the vagina\nthat occurs with reduction of vaginal acidity (pH) and a shift\nin the normal bacteria that colonize the vagina. The estimated\npopulation prevalence of this condition among younger\nworth & Peipert, 2007). While often asymptomatic, symp-\ntoms include a thin, fishy vaginal discharge that can worsen\nfollowing sexual intercourse. Douching, sexual intercourse\nwith multiple partners, oral sex particularly with a new sex-\nual partner, and cigarette smoking are associated with BV in\nyounger populations (Allsworth & Peipert, 2007; Marrazzo\n2004). BV has been associated with infection of the lining of\nthe uterus and upper genital tract, urinary tract infections,\ninfectious complications following gynecologic procedures,\nand sexually acquired HIV transmission (Harmanli, Cheng,\nNyirjesy, Chatwani, & Gaughan, 2000; Peipert, Montagno,\nHurt, 1990). Although most research on BV has been con-\nducted in younger populations, one northern Italian study of\n921 postmenopausal women seeking gynecologic care found\na BV prevalence of about 6% (Cauci et al., 2002). This is\nlikely a low estimate of the population prevalence of BV\namong older women, as the condition may inhibit women\nfrom seeking gynecologic services or be associated with\nother barriers to medical care. BV can be persistent, irritat-\ning, and malodorous, and left untreated can compromise\nquality of life, including sexual activity and functioning.\nVC results from overgrowth of a yeast species commonly\nfound in the normal vaginal flora. It is highly prevalent\namong younger women and, based on clinical data, is less\nfrequently diagnosed among postmenopausal women.Yeast\ncan cause vaginal and vulvar irritation, itching, burning\nwith urination, and a thick white vaginal discharge. It can be\nepisodic, recurrent, or chronic and, if not treated, can cause\ndisruption in sexual and social functioning due primarily to\nthe physical discomfort. Obesity, incontinence, and seden-\ntariness can promote and/or exacerbate yeast vaginitis. The\nsymptoms are similar to those, and must be distinguished\nfrom, thinning of the vaginal epithelium (atrophy) that oc-\ncurs with loss of estrogen in postmenopausal women. Yeast\nvaginitis can be sexually transmitted or associated with sex-\nual activity but commonly occurs in women who are not\nsexually active. Risk factors in older women include diabe-\ntes mellitus, immune suppression, and use of antibiotics,\nestrogen, and pessaries (vaginal devices used to treat pelvic\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV), a common sexually trans-\nmitted viral infection of the anogenital tract, is an important\nfactor in genital tract dysplasia (precancer) and high risk\ntypes are found in association with nearly all cases of cervi-\ncal cancer. More than 100 types of HPV have been identi-\nfied, with as many as 40 infecting the female genital tract.\nHPV infection in younger women is frequently transient but\ncan be persistent, latent, or reactivated. Risk factors for gen-\nital tract HPV in women include sexual activity, tobacco\nexposure, and immune suppression (Baseman & Koutsky,\n2005). NSHAP provides data on the presence and subtypes\nof HR-HPV or the strains that are most strongly associated\nwith cervical dysplasia and cancer. With recent availability\nof an assay for identification of low-risk HPV subtypes (as-\nsociated with vulvar and vaginal warts), work is under way\nto make these data available from the NSHAP specimens.\nFor the first time, these data provide information on popula-\ntion prevalence and correlates of HPV among older women\nin the United States (Lindau, Drum, Gaumer, Surawska, &\nJordan, in press). Genital tract HPV presence may be a\nmarker of immune function in older women (Garcia-Pineres\nThe vaginal swab specimens also provide cellular mate-\nrial useful for gauging sex hormone metabolism and, in par-\nticular, the bioactivity of estrogens within the vaginal\nepithelium. The vaginal epithelium is the cellular layer that\nlines the vagina and is physiologically important for sexual\nfunction and an indicator of the overall integrity of the fe-\nmale urogenital tract, including the bladder, urethra, vagina,\nvulva, and pelvic floor support structures. To date, popula-\ntion data have not been available for documentation of the\ncytological features of the vagina in older women, particu-\nlarly in relation to sexual function. These data are important\nfor basic scientific understanding of older female endocrine\nphysiology and may relate to sexual function and behavior\nin later life.\nThese measures and possible applications are summa-\nrized in Table 1.\nVaginal self-swab methods have been used in previous\nstudies of younger women, mainly to assess HPV preva-\nlence or as an alternative to the conventional clinical Pap\nsmear procedure (Dunne et al., 2007). These methods have\nbeen particularly useful in remote and resource-poor set-\ntings. Women are receptive to these methods, find them ac-\nceptable, and, in some cases, prefer self-swab to gynecologic\nexamination (Chernesky et al., 2005). Few studies have\nused vaginal self-swab procedures with older women. NS-\nHAP worked with investigators for the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to harmonize\nthe vaginal self-swab protocols; some data from younger\nwomen in NHANES are therefore comparable to data from\nolder women in NSHAP. To the best of our knowledge, NS-\nHAP is the first study to use a vaginal self-swab protocol\nwith a large, home-based cohort of older women.\nMethods\nDetails of the NSHAP sample design and participant\ncharacteristics have been previously described (Lindau\net al., 2007). Here, we describe the translation and adaptation\nof common clinical methods of in-home vaginal microbio-\nlogical and cytological assessment.\nDesign and Implementation of the Vaginal Swab Collection\nProtocol\nHuman subjects protocol.--All NSHAP data are pro-\ntected by approval from local Institutional Review Boards\nand by a National Institutes of Health (NIH)\u00adissued Certifi-\ncate of Confidentiality (National Institutes of Health, 2003).\nThe vaginal swab informed consent protocol involved: (a)\nsigned consent prior to initiating the interview, (b) detailed\ndescription of collection procedures followed by oral recon-\nsent at the time of vaginal swab collection, and (c) for those\nproviding a specimen, signed consent to receive a mailed\nnotification of results availability. To ensure anonymity of\nthe vaginal specimens, each was labeled with a unique iden-\ntification number used for tracking in transportation, and\nprocessing, and the results reporting system was operated by\nthe American Social Health Association (ASHA, Research\nTriangle Park, NC). ASHA has expertise in contact center\noperations and extensive experience in providing test results\ncounseling services for federal research and clinical trials.\nLaboratories and ASHA had access to only these unique\nidentifiers. All the vaginal specimen data are available via\nthe NSHAP public use data set, with the exception of the\nHPV assay results. Because a small proportion of the popu-\nlation tested positive for HPV and individuals may have dis-\nclosed their HPV status to sexual partners, these data are\nrestricted to maximize protection of participant anonymity.\nSelection, training, and support of field staff for vaginal\nswab collection.--The National Opinion Research Center\n(NORC) maintains a large, national field staff with extensive\nexperience in survey interviewing. Interviewer recruitment and\ntraining protocols were tailored to support the breadth and na-\nture of biological data collection unique to NSHAP, including\nvaginal swab collection. A detailed description of interviewer\nrecruitment, staffing, and training as it relates to integrating\nbiomeasures into a social science survey has been previously\npublished (Jaszczak, Lundeen, & Smith, in review).\nField staff recruitment involved detailed description of\nexpectations and tasks related to the vaginal swab protocol.\nCandidate willingness to handle and store vaginal swab ma-\nterials and comfort discussing the protocol and its rationale\nwith participants were assessed. Field staff training proce-\ndures combined NORC survey interviewing expertise with\nthe clinical expertise (gynecology, internal medicine) of\nmembers of the investigator team. Vaginal swab training in-\ncluded: (a) pretraining home study using a customized\ntraining video and manual; (b) in-person training involving\ndirect contact with study investigators (including a clinical\ngynecologist), active learning techniques, and practice\u00ad\nfeedback sessions with trainers; and (c) phone-based small\ngroup booster trainings with NORC staff and a physician\nstudy investigator during the field period. All female NS-\nHAP participants were interviewed by female field staff\n(the NORC field staff pool is predominantly female).\nVaginal swab specimen collection, processing, and re-\nsults reporting.--All female respondents were asked to pro-\nvide a vaginal self-swab specimen.

Pro-\ncedures were explained using a scripted description aided\nby illustrated instructions, developed for NSHAP by a med-\nical illustrator in conjunction with a study investigator who\nis a gynecologist (Figure 1). Participant questions were ad-\ndressed using a \"frequently asked questions\" document to\nensure consistency of responses across field staff. Field staff\nread each step of the illustrated instructions to the respon-\ndent and asked for questions.\nFigure 1. Illustrated instructions for self-collected vaginal swab by older women. Illustration by Rachel Seelen (Chicago, IL) in collaboration with Stacy Tessler Lindau.\nParticipants were given the instruction card with the col-\nlection materials (details on materials have been previously\ndescribed) and directed to a bathroom or other private room\nin the home (Lindau, Mendoza, Surawska, & Jordan, 2008a,\nviewer then secured the Digene swab inside a tube containing\nstandard transport medium and the BBLTM CultureSwabTM\ninside a tube containing Amies medium without charcoal\n(Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The\ninterviewer labeled both tubes with the unique, numeric iden-\ntification number. Additional details regarding the protocol\nare summarized below and have been previously published\n(Lindau, Drum, Gaumer, Surawska, & Jordan, in review).\nAt the end of the interview, respondents were instructed\non accessing results for the clinically relevant vaginal swab\nassays (presence or absence of BV, VC, or HPV). Respon-\ndents were given an identification number and asked to cre-\nate a unique four-digit password to access test results. At 3\nand 5 weeks following the interview, willing respondents\nreceived a reminder letter indicating availability of anony-\nmous results counseling and reporting at ASHA. Via a toll-\nfree phone call, ASHA provided respondents with BV, VC,\nand HPV test results, pre- and posttest counseling, supple-\nmentary educational literature, and referrals. To test the\nfeasibility of a passive survey for results counseling, ASHA\ncounselors completed a postcall survey for a subset of calls,\ndocumenting the counseling topics discussed, who initiated\nthe counseling, and about whom the caller was concerned.\nCallers were anonymous; these data are therefore not link-\nable to individual-level data in the main NSHAP data set\nbut are in the process of becoming available as part of the\nNSHAP data set (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACDA/).\nTransportation and tracking protocol.--At the end of each\nhome encounter, field staff stored the vaginal swab transport\ntubes in an insulated cooler with ice packs. Vaginal swabs\nwere shipped daily on cold packs in a Styrofoam container to\nthe University of Pittsburgh, Magee-Women's Hospital De-\npartment of Pathology clinical microbiology laboratory via\novernight delivery. The swabs were packaged in accordance\nwith the federal shipping guidelines for diagnostic biological\nmaterial. Following processing at Magee-Women's Research\nInstitute laboratory, one BBLTM CultureSwabTM for each re-\nspondent was repackaged and shipped overnight on cold\npacks to the University of Chicago Institute for Mind and\nBiology laboratory for cytological analysis. An interactive rec-\nonciliation system facilitated remote tracking of vaginal\nswabs. Weekly reconciliation between NORC and the Magee-\nWomen's laboratory compared questionnaire data (indicating\nwhether a sample was recorded as collected) with laboratory\ndata (indicating whether a sample was recorded as received).\nDiscrepancies in reconciliation were resolved and recorded.\nTable 2.

The specimen adequacy rate for each\nassay is defined as the ratio of vaginal swab specimens that\nwere eligible for analysis by the laboratory to the total num-\nber of specimens obtained in the home eligible for that as-\nsay (excluding one specimen lost in the mail).\nBV assay and scoring procedure.--Preparation for the BV\nand VC assays began with rolling of the culture swab onto\nthe surface of a glass slide, thereby transferring the vaginal\ncellular specimen from the swab to the slide. The slide was\nair-dried and fixed with 95% methanol and then stained us-\ning a standard Gram stain protocol (Burke, 1922).\nFor BV assessment, 20 or more fields of the stained slide\nwere examined microscopically using an oil immersion ob-\nnumber of each of the three classes of observed vaginal bac-\nterial organisms including (a) Lactobacillus species, (b)\nGardnerella species and anaerobic gram-negative rods, and\n(c) Mobiluncus species were observed. A 0- to 10-point\nscoring system (previously described [Lindau et al., 2008a])\nclinically classifies the specimen as normal vaginal flora/no\nBV detected (0\u00ad3 points), intermediate (4\u00ad6 points), and\nindicative of BV (7\u00ad10 points) (Nugent, Krohn, & Hillier,\n1991) (Table 3). Slides lacking normal flora (estrogen-\nrelated depletion of lactobacilli can be a nonpathologic state\nin postmenopausal women) and lacking criteria for BV\nwere separately coded. Estrogen-related shifts in the pres-\nence of lactobacilli in postmenopausal women may affect\ninterpretation of the Nugent classification; this should be\nconsidered in interpreting these scores (Cauci et al., 2002).\nVC assay and scoring procedure.--The same gram-\nstained slides used to assess BV were also evaluated for\nthe presence of yeast (for additional details, see Lindau\net al., 2008b). The reader examined the entire area of\neach stained slide to determine the presence or absence\nof yeast cells showing blastoconidia (cell buds) in the\nspecimen. A dichotomous score was assigned to each\nslide. Figure 2 provides photographs of a normal vaginal\nepithelial cell, bacterial vaginosis (BV) and vaginal can-\ndidiasis (VC).\nGenital human papillomavirus assays and scoring\nprocedures.--The details of the HPV assays have been pre-\nviously published, including a flowchart summarizing the\ndisposition of the assays (Lindau et al., 2008c; Lindau et al.,\nin review).\nHR-HPV detection by hc2 assay.--HR-HPV DNA testing\nwas performed on 1,010 specimens using the Hybrid Cap-\nture 2\u00ae (hc2) High-Risk HPV DNA TestTM (Catalog No.\nmanufacturer's protocol. Specimens with relative light unit/\ncutoff values 1.0, obtained using the Digene Microplate\nsidered positive for HR-HPV DNA.\nHPV genotyping.--Genotyping was performed on 56 hc2\nHR-HPV\u00adpositive specimens using the Linear Array HPV\nGenotyping Test and Linear Array Detection Kit (Roche\nMolecular Systems Inc., Pleasanton, CA) according to\nthe manufacturer's instructions. Due to accessibility of the\ngenotyping assay to our research team in relation to the\nstudy period, only hc2 HR-HPV\u00adpositive specimens were\ngenotyped.\nCoding.--HPV-related variables in the NSHAP data set\nare not included in the public-use data set, as explained in the\nHuman Subjects section, above. Each specimen was reported\nas positive or negative by hc2 and coded dichotomously. For\nthose testing positive for HR-HPV by hc2, a dichotomous\nvariable based on the Roche genotyping assay result indi-\ncates the presence or absence of each of 37 genotypes.\nVaginal cytology assessment and scoring.--Preparation\nof the cytology slides.--The vials containing BBLTM Cul-\ntureSwabTM Plus Amies Medium Without Charcoal BD\n(Becton, Dickinson and Company) were delivered in batch-\nes packaged with cold packs from the Jordan Magee-Wom-\nen's laboratory and were immediately stored at 4\u00b0C in a\ncold room. The vaginal swabs were kept in their individual\nvials until the sample of vaginal epithelium was transferred\nfrom swab to slide. Throughout the transfer process, the vi-\nals were placed on wet ice and processed one at a time.\nEach swab was placed into a prelabeled 1.5-ml microcen-\nPittsburgh, PA) filled to 1.0 ml with Hanks balanced salt\nsolution (Catalog No. H6648; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The\nsolution was used to suspend the vaginal epithelial cells\nfrom the swab, as well as to thin the Amies medium to\nfacilitate suspension. The swab was gently twirled in the\nTable 3. Nugent's Point Scoring System for Bacterial Vaginosis\nObjective\nMorphotype\nGardnerella species\nand anaerobic GNR\nNote: Adapted from Nugent et al. (1991). GNR = gram-negative rods.\nsolution for 15 s and discarded. The culture tube, containing\nthe remaining cells in the Amies medium, was recapped,\nplaced on ice, and returned to storage at 4\u00b0C along with the\nmicrocentrifuge tube containing the suspended cells.\nThe vaginal epithelial cells typically settled in the tip of\nthe microcentrifuge tube and were resuspended by gentle\nagitation by flicking the tube with an index finger (mechan-\nical methods degraded the cell suspension). Five slides with\ntriplicate samples were created to maximize validity, reliabil-\nity, and versatility. First, a 0.15-ml aliquot of the suspended-\ncell Hanks solution was micropipetted onto the frosted end\nPropper, VWR, West Chester, PA). Two additional aliquots\nwere placed on the same slide; the size of the aliquot and\nglass texture ensured that the aliquots remained separate.\nFive slides from each woman's specimen were prepared,\nyielding 15 independent samples of vaginal epithelial cells.\nTwo of the slides (six aliquots), designated for cytologic\nanalysis, were immediately sprayed with an alcohol fixative\nto air-dry along with the three additional, unfixed slides. Af-\nter drying overnight, one cytology slide was stained by the\nUniversity of Chicago Hospitals Department of Surgical\nPathology with the progressive Papanicolaou stain (Pap\nXY machine. The other slide, fixed for cytology staining,\nwas stored in microscope boxes at room temperature for fu-\nture use. The unstained slides were stored in microscope\nslide boxes in a 4 \u00b0C cold room for future analyses.\nPap staining facilitates cytological coding by adding\ncolor that helps distinguish superficial epithelial cell types\nfrom those deriving from deeper layers of the vaginal epi-\nthelium and differentiates nuclear from cytoplasmic mate-\nrial. Estrogen promotes cellular glycogen production (the\nsubstrate for lactobacilli, a predominant bacteria normally\nresiding in the vagina that is necessary for maintaining\nacidity [pH]). Typically, glycogen in the estrogenized su-\nperficial cells of the vaginal epithelium stains red, reveal-\nfrom the intermediate epithelial cell layer stain light blue\nand have a less dense nucleus compared with superficial\ncells (Papanicolaou, 1956). Cells from the parabasal layer\nstain dark blue and have a larger nucleus than the interme-\ndiate cells. Basal cells, from the deepest epithelial layer,\nstain dark purple and have the largest nucleus of all the\ncell types above (Papanicolaou, 1956). These four cell\ntypes are also distinguished from one another by size, the\nnuclear to cytoplasm ratio, and the characteristics of their\nnuclei. Illustrative photographs are presented in the Re-\nsults section.\nFigure 2. Normal vaginal flora, bacterial vaginosis (BV), and vaginal candidiasis (VC). Normal vaginal flora: A gram-stained vaginal swab\u00adbased sample that was\ngiven a score of 1, which is indicative of normal flora. The field contains epithelial cells with significant numbers of Lactobacillus spp. (arrow) but lacked small gram-\nnegative rods (\u00d71,000 magnification). BV: A gram-stained vaginal swab\u00adbased sample that was given a score of 10, which is indicative of BV. The field contains a\nsingle epithelial cell with significant numbers of small gram-negative rods and lacked any Lactobacillus spp. (\u00d71,000 magnification). VC: A gram-stained vaginal\nswab\u00adbased sample. The field contains several gram-positive yeast cells, including one that is budding (arrow) (\u00d71,000 magnification). Microscope: Nikon Eclipse\nE600; Code No. 2CE-MVZH-9; Nikon Corporation (Tokyo, Japan).\nThe vaginal maturation index.--The vaginal maturation\nindex (MI), a common clinical measure, uses the exfoliated\nvaginal cells to evaluate the hormonal status and thickness\nof the vaginal epithelium (Cibas & Ducatman, 2003). The\nMI also gives insight into the estrogen status of the related\ngenital structures including the vulva, urethra, and the\nbladder (Grodstein, Lifford, Resnick, & Curhan, 2004;\nHammond, 1977). In contrast to a serum or salivary mea-\nsure of circulating estrogen, the MI indicates the net effect\nof biologically active sex hormones (circulating levels of\nfree estrogens, androgens, and progestogens) on the vaginal\nepithelium and provides an integrated measure of hormonal\nbioactivity over time, rather than blood levels at a single\ntime point (McEndree, 1999). The traditional MI quantifies\nthe relative proportion of the vaginal parabasal (P), interme-\ndiate (I), and superficial (S) cells (Bibbo, 1997).\nCoders from the Institute for Mind and Biology, experi-\nenced in cytology assessment of the rat vaginal epithelium,\nwere trained by clinical cytopathologists at the University of\nChicago Hospitals to read slides for the MI; coders were not\ntrained to recognize cellular atypia. First, using a modifica-\ntion of the Cibas and Ducatman method, a visual survey ap-\nproach at \u00d7100 magnification was used to read each slide\nsystematically from left to right, checking each aliquot\nfor cellular number, quality, and consistency (Cibas &\ncells, consistent in proportions across the three aliquots,\nwere considered \"excellent\" for coding the MI. Slides were\ndeemed \"adequate\" if they had one of the following charac-\nteristics: moderate staining, fewer than 100 cells, unstained\nnuclei, or cell fragments (see photographs in Results). Slides\nwith several of these characteristics were deemed inadequate\nfor traditional MI methodology. The coder then estimated\nthe relative proportion of parabasal, intermediate, and su-\nperficial cells (P:I:S), integrating across all three aliquots.\nSpecimens were obtained for assessment of vaginal, not\ncervical, cytological characteristics. Cervical cells are\nneeded in order to assess risk for cervical cancer (e.g., Pa-\npanicolaou smear). Self-collection of cervical epithelial\nspecimens for cytopathology requires a different approach,\nincluding clinical laboratory assessment and clinical-level\nresults counseling; this was outside the scope of our\nstudy.\nResults\nParticipant Cooperation in Vaginal Self-Sampling\nweighted) agreed to submit a self-administered vaginal\nswab specimen (Figure 3). A total of 522 women were con-\nsidered nonresponders; 521 respondents did not submit a\nswab specimen, and for one individual the vaginal swab\nprotocol was inadvertently omitted due to a data entry error\nearlier in the interview.\nIn univariate analysis, participants in the vaginal swab col-\nlection were significantly more likely to be younger (<74\nyears), and have at least a high school diploma, and were more\nlikely to report a recent pelvic examination, menopausal\nprescription hormone use, and sexual activity in the past\nyear (Table 4). All female participants were interviewed by a\nfemale field interviewer. Field staff whose age matched that of\nthe study population were significantly more likely to obtain\ncooperation with the vaginal self-swab protocol (74.5% of\n.001). Field staff were encouraged to record the respondent's\nreason for refusal, if offered. When recorded, the most com-\nmon anecdotal reason for nonparticipation was a physical or\nhealth problem.\nSpecimen Adequacy\nThe vast majority of the vaginal self-swab specimens ob-\ntained in the home arrived in the laboratories and were ad-\n(5.7%) had an insufficient quantity of bacterial or fungal\nmaterial and so were inadequate for analysis; 51(5.0%)\nwere adequate for analysis but not assigned a Nugent score\nbecause they lacked both normal and BV-like vaginal flora.\nDetails regarding the HPV specimens have been previously\npublished (Lindau et al., in review); however, among the\n1,010 adequate for analysis, all were adequate for testing by\ntive for HR-HPV by hc2 were adequate for genotyping\n(Figure 3).\nAll 1,016 swabs received by the Jordan Laboratory were\nsent on to the McClintock Laboratory, and all were pro-\ncessed for cytological analysis. Of these, 85.5% were excel-\nFigure 3). As shown in Figure 4, all three types of vaginal\nepithelial cells--superficial, intermediate, and parabasal--\nused in the MI were readily identified in the adequately\nstained slides. The majority of the Pap-stained cytology\nslides that were categorized for MI had more than 100 cells\nThere was little overlap between specimens found to be\ninadequate for pathogen analysis (BV, VC) and those found\nto be inadequate for cytological analysis. Only 0.9%\n(9/1,016) of the specimens were inadequate for both. In\nother words, 99.1% of women who provided a swab suc-\ncessfully collected a vaginal specimen.\nResults Reporting Usage\nAll respondents who provided a vaginal swab specimen\nand/or an HIV test (women and men) were eligible to call\nASHA for results counseling and receipt (n = 1,551) and\nwere provided detailed instructions at the time of the inter-\nview about how to access results. Of the respondents eligi-\nnotification of results availability. A total of 685 (44.2%)\ncalls were made to the NSHAP results hotline. The content\ndocumented by ASHA phone counselors. Due to a small\nnumber of repeat callers, ASHA estimated that the true\npercentage of respondents seeking results was closer to\n41%\u00ad42% of those eligible for results. Although data on\ncounseling about BV and VC were collected, they are very\nlimited due to a high frequency of missing data (resulting\nfrom a programming error in the ASHA electronic passive\nsurvey) and are therefore not reported here. However, HPV\ncounseling data were successfully obtained.\nAmong the 517 documented calls, HR-HPV results were\nhad questions about HPV. Counseling included definition of\nthe disease, test accuracy, symptoms, transmission, risk\nreduction, treatment, and emotional issues. Respondents\nrarely initiated discussions. The most frequently discussed\ntopics included definition of the disease and symptoms;\nemotional issues were the least frequently discussed. For\neach counseling topic discussed, the counselor identified\nabout whom the respondent was concerned--self, partner,\nfamily, or other. Most callers did not identify a specific indi-\nvidual of concern, but for those who did, they most often\nexpressed concern about self rather than others.\nDiscussion\nThe acceptability and performance of vaginal self-swab\nspecimens in studies of younger women are well established\nand compare very favorably to specimens collected by clin-\nical transvaginal speculum examination (Chernesky et al.,\n2005). Interdisciplinary collaboration among NSHAP in-\nvestigators merged clinical medical with social survey and\nbehavioral endocrinology expertise to successfully imple-\nment novel methods for vaginal self-swab specimen collec-\ntion with older community-residing women participants\nand nonmedical field staff. Self-swab participation rates\noverall (number of collected swabs/number of eligible study\nparticipants) were excellent, particularly given prevalent\nfunctional limitations such as arthritis and obesity that could\ninterfere with older women's physical ability to accomplish\nspecimen collection (Drum, Shiovitz, Gaumer, Surawska, &\nLindau, in review).\nAlthough the participation rate was lower in NSHAP\n(66.3%) than in a recent NHANES study of HPV in younger\nwomen (ages 18\u00ad59 years) using similar self-swab methods\nFigure 3.

In contrast to\nNSHAP,NHANES'self-swabspecimensofyoungerwomen\nwere obtained in a mobile clinical setting, with medical per-\nsonnel, and using specimen storage and laboratory transport\nprocedures typical of clinical protocols. The similarity in\nperformance of the vaginal self-swab methods across these\ntwo major population studies, despite the differences in\nstudy population and research setting, lends additional reas-\nsurance about the feasibility of the NSHAP vaginal self-\nswab methods for use with population-based samples of\nolder women.\nCollection of vaginal cytological data in the population\nsetting, particularly from older women, was both highly\nnovel and highly successful. Interpretation of the MI for\nmanaging gynecologic problems in the clinical setting has\nbeen based heavily on small, referent data sets from indi-\nvidual physicians' clinical practices and is therefore subject\nto selection bias (Hafez & Evans, 1978). The Pap-stained\ncytological specimens obtained in NSHAP are indistin-\nguishable from those obtained under clinical conditions.\nAlthough no data are available for comparison, clinical\nexperience suggests that the specimen adequacy rate is\nalso comparable. The NSHAP vaginal self-swab protocol\nfor cytological assessment presents a highly promising, new\nfield-based biomeasure for use in population-based older\nwomen's health research.\nSeveral factors emerge in bivariate analysis to explain coop-\neration with the vaginal self-swab protocol, including respon-\ndent sociodemographic and health characteristics and field\nstaff characteristics. In contrast to studies of younger women\nwhere sociodemographic factors are not significantly associ-\nated with self-swab participation (Chernesky et al., 2005), we\nfound that younger, more highly educated, healthier, sexually\nactive respondents and those indicating participation in gyne-\ncologic care were more likely to participate. Interestingly, in\nbivariate analysis, field staff whose age matched that of the\nstudy population were significantly more likely to obtain co-\noperation with the vaginal self-swab protocol. Concordance\nbetween respondent and interviewer sociodemographic\nand/or racial characteristics has been found to be influential\nin some cases (Campanelli & O'Muircheartaigh, 1999;\nPickery & Loosveldt, 2002), and accounting for such inter-\nactions could be informative. Other mechanisms through\nwhich field staff characteristics may influence respondent\ncooperation include field staff experience and confidence\n(Groves & Couper, 1998). For future waves of NSHAP, the\nimpact of both general interviewing experience and prior\nNSHAP interviewing experience on participation could be\nexplored.\nDuring the field period, booster trainings were imple-\nmented for a subset of interviewers to maximize respondent\ncooperation; the effectiveness of this intervention may be\nreflected by stable vaginal swab cooperation rates through-\nout the study period. Alternately, without additional training\nduring the data collection period, one might have expected\ncooperation with vaginal self-swab collection to be subject\nto decline over time as the more reluctant or inaccessible\nparticipants were recruited into the study. Of course, some\ncases of missing vaginal swab data are due neither to the\nrespondent nor to the field staff person but to errors in equip-\nment, transportation, and laboratory processing (as indicated\nin Figure 3). Interventions to address these sources of miss-\ning data would need to occur in conjunction with strategies\ntargeted to respondents or field staff. Further analyses of\nfield staff correlates of participation could be accomplished\nwith access to NSHAP operations data; however, these are\ncurrently not part of the NSHAP public use data set.\nAn anonymous results reporting system provided coun-\nseling and results to the respondents who chose to call\nfor their vaginal swab test results. Most importantly, all\ncallers seeking results were able to receive their results.\nThis demonstrates the operational success of the anony-\nmous results reporting system, which required flawless\ncommunication among home, Magee-Women's laboratory,\nAll respondents providing specimens for which counsel-\ning was available were given instructions during the in-\nhome interview for test results access, but more than 40%\ndeclined further notification of results availability, and a mi-\nnority of those eligible actually called the ASHA hotline.\nStudies of younger adults also find that many respondents\ndecline to access test results following study participation\n(Pugatch et al., 2001). This may be due to active avoidance\nof the information, disinterest, or the feeling that the infor-\nmation replicates testing already received in the clinical set-\nting. For older adults, difficulty with phone communication\ndue to hearing or speech problems may also present a bar-\nrier. In the case of NSHAP, counseling data collected by the\npilot passive survey were limited by a technical error in sur-\nvey programming by ASHA that resulted in inadvertent\nskipping of questions relating to BV and VC. This can eas-\nily be overcome for future waves. Although the cooperation\ndata are limited, they do shed light on the role and value of\na results counseling service for vaginal swab\u00adbased testing\nin a population-based study that includes older women and\nthe feasibility of implementing a passive survey in conjunc-\ntion with the phone encounters. Interpretation of these data\nwould be significantly enhanced if linkable to the main data\nset; how to accomplish this while protecting participant an-\nonymity presents a challenge that we were not able to over-\ncome in the NSHAP study.\nExperience from the NSHAP study demonstrates that\ncollection of vaginal self-swab specimens from older\nFigure 4.
