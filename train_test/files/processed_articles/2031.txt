    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rapid rise in the incidence of obesity has emerged as one of the most pressing global public health issues in recent years. The underlying\netiological causes of obesity, whether behavioral, environmental, genetic, or a combination of several of them, have not been completely elucidated.\nThe obesity epidemic has been attributed to the ready availability, abundance, and overconsumption of high-energy content food. We determined\nhere by Pearson's correlation the relationship between food type consumption and rising obesity using the loss-adjusted food availability data from\nthe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic Research Services (ERS) as well as the obesity prevalence data from the Behavioral\nRisk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) at the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC). Our analysis showed that total calorie intake and consumption of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) did not correlate with\nrising obesity trends. Intake of other major food types, including chicken, dairy fats, salad and cooking oils, and cheese also did not correlate with\nobesity trends. However, our results surprisingly revealed that consumption of corn products correlated with rising obesity and was independent\nof gender and race/ethnicity among population dynamics in the U.S. Therefore, we were able to demonstrate a novel link between the consumption\nof corn products and rising obesity trends that has not been previously attributed to the obesity epidemic. This correlation coincides with the introduction\nof bioengineered corns into the human food chain, thus raising a new hypothesis that should be tested in molecular and animal models of obesity.\n",

This rising\ntrend continues unabated both globally and in the United States,\nwhich claims the largest population of overweight and obese\nadults [2,3]. Various etiologic factors associated with obesity\nhave been reported, including a number of genes identified from\ngenome-wide scans and functional genomic studies as well as\nsome viruses and bacteria [4-7]. The current prevailing hypothesis\ncenters on the premise that the problem of obesity is one of\nenergy imbalance, wherein total energy intake far exceeds energy\noutput [8]. In addition, the global epidemic of obesity has been\nattributed to heuristic observations of an increase in the\nconsumption of high-energy/high-fat content foods coupled with\na sedentary lifestyle that expends little energy.\nThe notion that particular nutrients or food sources might\ninfluence obesity is controversial [9]. For example, the increased\nconsumption of some food types, including beverages and foods\nthat contain high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), is speculated to\nbe associated with obesity [10,11]. Moreover, in a previous study,\nmice given HFCS-sweetened water gained more weight and\nshowed increase adiposity [12]. While the results of this animal\nstudy seem to provide experimental evidence that supports the\nhypothesis that consumption of HFCS causes obesity, the results\nfrom epidemiological and clinical studies in human are\ninconclusive [13,14], leaving the question of HFCS association\nwith obesity unanswered. Therefore, whether or not the intake\nof certain food types predisposes an individual to increased risk\nfor obesity needs to be examined.\nQuantifying the amount of food an individual consumes daily\nis difficult, and determining the intake of specific food types\nis intractable, thus posing significant challenges to the\ninvestigation of food intake and the development of obesity. It\nis known that the Loss-Adjusted Food Availability Data from\nthe Economic Research Services (ERS) of the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) constitute time series data\non the national food supply of several hundred food-types\ntargeted to the food marketing system.

We confirmed a novel association of rising\nobesity trends with increased corn product consumption that may\nbe linked to the growing and ubiquitous presence of genetically\nmodified (GM) or engineered (GE) corn in the human diet.\nSubjects and Methods\nDatasets\nWe obtained the Loss-Adjusted Food Availability Data\nat the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic\nResearch Services (ERS). The per capita food availability data\nwas adjusted for food spoilage, waste, and other losses, as well\nas converted to average daily per capita calories. The data are\ndownloadable at the USDA ERS data bank [16].\nThe obesity prevalence and trends data spanning from 1995\nand 2008, comprised of health survey data on health risk\nbehaviors such as obesity, were obtained from the Behavioral\nRisk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) at the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) [17]. Trends data with\nbody mass index (BMI)  30, classified as obese, were used\nin this study.

To validate\nthe positive correlations, we investigated the dependence of the\nobesity trends on different food types by fitting a multiple linear\nregression using both full and reduced model functions.\nSince the BRFSS obesity prevalence and trends data were only\ncorrelation and multiple linear regression. The food types\nanalyzed were red meat, poultry, dairy products, grains, fats and\noils, sweeteners, and average total calories consumed daily per\ncapita. In addition, specific food types such as fish, eggs, nuts,\nand some dairy products exhibiting either negative or no change\nsubjected to Pearson's analysis.\nResults\nTo determine the correlation between obesity and food type\nintake, we first assessed the suitability of the BRFSS dataset for\nour analysis. Use of the NHANES obesity prevalence data was\nhampered by the availability of only five data points, NHANES\n2008), in contrast to the 14 data points in the BRFSS dataset\nfor our study. However, the BRFSS dataset, which is based on\nself-reported weights and heights, is generally considered inferior\nto the NHANES obesity prevalence data [20,21]. Despite the\nqualitative and quantitative differences between the NHANES\nand BRFSS data, our results show that the obesity trends between\nsimilar by regression analysis (Fig. 1). Therefore, we used the\nBRFSS data for our correlation study with the food trends data\nsince it is statistically more robust than the NHANES dataset.\nWe analyzed the USDA ERS Loss-Adjusted Food Availability\nData, which include seven major aggregated food groups\nincluding 1, meat, eggs, and nuts; 2, dairy; 3, fruit; 4, vegetables;\n5, flour and cereal products; 6, added fats and oils, and dairy\nfats; and 7, caloric sweeteners. These groups are further\ncomprised of more than 100 individual or specific food types\n(commodities). Analysis of these food types revealed that a large\nnumber of them including fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, beverage\nmilk, fish and shellfish, fruit juice, nuts, and others, showed either\nnegative trends or no change in trends of consumption and did\nnot coincide with rising trends in obesity (Fig. 2).\nSince energy imbalance resulting from excess calorie intake\nis thought to contribute to obesity, we first analyzed the trends\ndata indicated that the average daily per capita total calorie intake\nhas plateaued since year 2000, whereas obesity exhibited a rising\ntrend (Fig. 3A), and Pearson's analysis showed a correlation coefficient\nof 0.79 (Table 1).

The consumption of refined cane and beet sugar (Fig.\n3O) as well as sweet corn as a fresh vegetable (Fig. 3P) also\ndid not correlate with obesity. The consumption of corn as a\nfresh vegetable constituted only a small percentage (averaging\nTo further test these positive correlations with obesity trends,\nwe performed a fitting by multiple linear regression analysis with\nfood types that showed correlation coefficients > 0.95, which\nincluded chicken, corn products, dairy fats, salad and cooking\noils, and total cheese, in a full model function. This analysis\nshowed that only corn products had p-values smaller than 0.05\n(Table 2), suggesting that consumption of corn products had a\nsignificant effect on rising obesity trends. In the reduced model,\nwe analyzed corn products and total cheese, which have p-values\nclosest to 0.05 from the full model analysis, and our results\nconfirmed a correlation between corn products, but not total\ncheese, and obesity trends (Table 2).\nThe observed correlation between consumption of corn\nproducts and rising obesity is surprising. It is noteworthy that\nHFCS is classified separately as a caloric sweetener and not\naggregated with other corn products. Moreover, HFCS showed\na negative correlation with rising obesity (Table 1). We were\nnot able to fully analyze whether or not corn product consumption\nthe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) datasets are only available in four cross-sectional,\nQin Shao and Khew-Voon Chin 257\nFig. 5.

Nevertheless, we showed that the\ntrends in obesity prevalence and corn product consumption\nWe were also aware that genetically modified (GM) corn has\nbeen planted in the U.S. since 1996 [23]. To further investigate\nthe relationship between bioengineered corn and rising obesity,\nwe obtained data on the adoption of GM corn from the USDA,\nwith rising obesity. These data did not take into account the use\nof GM corn for other purposes besides as a food or animal feed.\nDespite this limitation, our result shows that the trends of obesity\nand adoption of GM corn were similar (Fig. 4B).\nWe further asked whether or not the consumption of corn\nproducts might be associated with the demographic distribution\nof the population. Using the NHANES stratified obesity\n2008), we examined the relationship between corn product\nconsumption and race/ethnicity of men and women between 1995\nand 2008. Our results show that the trends of obesity and corn\nproduct consumption rose in parallel irrespective of gender\namong non-Hispanic white men and women (Fig. 5A and B),\nnon-Hispanic black men and women (Fig. 5C and D), and\nMexican-American men and women (Fig. 5E and F), thus\nsuggesting that the association of rising obesity trends with\nincreased corn product consumption is independent of race/\nethnicity and gender.\nDiscussion\nOur analysis of obesity and food type consumption trends data\nin this report yielded three major findings. First, it has been long\naccepted that overconsumption of food coupled with a sedentary\nlifestyle results in a positive energy imbalance, which is a formula\nfor obesity development. Our analysis in this report, however,\nindicates that even though total calorie intake in the U.S. has\nplateaued in recent years, the incidence of obesity continues to\nrise, thus suggesting that rising obesity trends do not correlate\nwith total energy intake. Alternatively, it is conceivable that the\ntotal caloric intake has plateaued while the levels of physical\nactivity have also not increased, thus explaining the intransigent\nobesity trends.\nSecond, HFCS as a cause of obesity has been intensely debated.\nIt was shown recently that rats given HFCS along with a regular\nchow diet gained more weight than control rats, even when they\nconsumed the same amount of calories [24]. Further, consumption\nof an HFCS-containing diet increased visceral fats and blood\ntriglycerides over time. However, our results show a negative\ncorrelation of HFCS with rising obesity, as HFCS consumption\nhas been on the decline since 2000. However, this negative\ncorrelation does not refute the underlying biological role of HFCS\nin obesity. Instead, it suggests that HFCS consumption on the\nwhole may not contribute to rising obesity trends. Though we\ninitially also observed positive correlations between increased\nconsumption of chicken, salad and cooking oils, dairy fats, and\ntotal cheese with obesity, subsequent multiple linear regression\nanalysis and cross-validation of these results revealed a lack of\nsignificance in these correlations.\nThe above observations suggest that additional factors may be\ninvolved in rising obesity trends. Therefore, our third finding\nof a correlation between increased corn product intake and rising\nnot generally considered unhealthy. What are the underlying\netiologic links between these foods and obesity?\nIn the ERS dataset, corn products are considered an aggregate\ncomprised of flour and meal, hominy and grits, cornstarch, and\nother corn products, which are widely used in the manufacture\nof a large variety of food products consumed by humans.\nRecently, it was reported that approximately 85% of the corn\ngrown in the U.S. is transgenic [25]. The increased ubiquity of\nGM or genetically engineered corn products in human food\nsources is noted, but their potential impact on human health has\n258 American food trends and obesity\nnot been investigated despite recent reports of hepatorenal\ntoxicity in rats fed GM maize [26,27]. Moreover, the rising trends\nin obesity coincide, in part, with the introduction of GM corn\nin foods and animal feeds in the U.S. [28,29]. These observations\nprompted us to hypothesize that consumption of GM corn\nproducts may contribute to rising obesity trends. The implications\nof our results and the new hypothesis raised here are provocative\nbut testable, as the effects of GM corn products can be assessed\nin molecular and animal models of obesity. No data are currently\navailable on how much genetically engineered food is on the\nmarket due to a lack of proper labeling and traceability.\nWe further speculate that the bacterial antigen derived from\nthe Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) entomocidal crystalline protein\nprotoxin [30], which is genetically engineered into corn to confer\nresistance to insect pests, may be the underlying culprit that\ncauses anomalous adipose tissue dysregulation and obesity\ndevelopment.\nWhile our trends study has yielded novel insights into the\npotential impact that some food types may have on the\ndevelopment of obesity, there are some possible confounding\nfactors that should be discussed. It is noteworthy that the\nLoss-Adjusted Data do not reflect actual consumption or the\nquantities of food ingested. Moreover, it was difficult to collect\ndata on the actual amount of food or the specific food types\nconsumed, as most previous clinical studies have relied on\nquestionnaires and voluntary reporting or recollection of food\nconsumed by study subjects, which are well known to be prone\nto psychosocial behavioral errors. In the absence of true food\nconsumption data, therefore, trends in food use obtained from\nthe USDA ERS Food Availability Data served as an alternative\nindirect measure of whether Americans are consuming more or\nless of various foods over time. Similarly, the weight and height\ninformation collected from phone interviews for the BRFSS\nobesity trends data is also highly susceptible to erroneous\nself-reporting. In contrast, physical measurements for weight and\nheight were obtained from participants in the NHANES studies.\nDespite such shortcomings, the BRFSS obesity trends were\nremarkably similar to the NHANES dataset. In addition, the data\nfor the rate of GM corn adoption in the U.S. did not take into\nconsideration the different uses of these transgenic corns other\nthan as foods and feeds. Although it is clear that transgenic corn\nhas penetrated into human foods and animal feeds, and the\nconsumption of GM crops has been deemed safe [31], precise\ndata regarding the amounts and types of foods containing\ntransgenic corn products are unavailable, and the correlation with\nincreased emergence of common human diseases including\ndiabetes and obesity has not been investigated.\nTaken together, our results reveal a novel association of corn\nproduct consumption with rising trends of obesity, which may\nbe linked to the increased ubiquity of transgenic corn in the diet.\nThese trends data findings warrant further investigation and\nconfirmation through laboratory testing.\n"
