Run by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism (ICIJ),\nthe investigation brought together journalists in 80 countries to examine more than\nmillion leaked documents. This joint project was facilitated by a virtual newsroom,\nwhich enabled journalists around the world to pool their knowledge, skills and perspec-\ntives, even though few ever met in person (Hare, 2016). Gerard Ryle of the ICIJ explains,\nInside the virtual newsroom, the reporters could gather around the themes that were emerging\nfrom the documents. Those interested in blood diamonds or exotic art, for instance, could share\ninformation about how the offshore world was being used to hide the trade in both of those\nVirtual newsrooms are not just used for big bespoke investigations such as the Panama\nPapers, however. The online collaborative software (OCS) packages on which they are\nbased are now cheap, widely available and increasingly used in the day-to-day opera-\ntions of thousands of news organisations around the world. The most popular OCS today\nis Slack, which was launched in August 2013 by Stewart Butterfield (the founder of\nFlikr). By 2015, Slack had more than a million daily active users and, at just 2 years old,\nwas valued at $2.8billion \u00ad making it the fastest-growing business-to-business company\nin history (Kiss, 2016). Its clients include Al Jazeera, BuzzFeed, Vox, The Times,\nMedium, The Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic, Quartz, Slate, NBC News, The Guardian,\nAOL, ITV, Time Inc.\nThe architecture of Slack has been designed to echo social media and the informal,\ncollaborative norms of digital culture. The main dashboard is organized around a series\nof perpetual chatrooms, each called a `channel' which users can customize and name\nwith a hashtag, for example, #HumanResources or #ITissues. Inside these channels, par-\nticipants can text, tag each other, share documents, photos, gifs and so on. Reviewing the\nsoftware for PC Mag, Duffy (2017) noted that teams often use Slack in more playful\nways than traditional work communications, for example, by dedicating channels to\n#banter, #social, #news, #humor, or just plain old #watercooler.\nEarly adopters of Slack were enthusiastic about its ability to enable productivity, hori-\nzontal collaboration, organisational transparency and team morale (Owen, 2015; Perkel,\n2017). Some believe that it may create more democratic and egalitarian work conditions\n(Kiss, 2016), while others worry about its impact on productivity (Jeffries, 2016).\nHowever, these observations are anecdotal, consisting of blogs and industry commen-\ntary, rather than empirical academic studies. Moreover, the existing commentary has\ntended to focus on news outlets that use Slack in addition to their physical newsroom(s).\nIt has not explored the far more radical potential of Slack as a replacement for physical\nnewsrooms. This is a notable oversight given (1) the intense economic pressures on jour-\nnalism and the massive cost-cutting potential of a virtual newsroom. And (2) the large\nnumber of casually contracted or remotely employed journalists who don't have access\nto a physical newsroom.\nThis article looks at two broad questions. First, how might Slack change and influence\njournalistic practice? Second, how can we theorise and research these platforms? We\nexamined these questions through extensive ethnographic observations and semi-struc-\ntured interviews. We had unprecedented access to complete a year of ethnographic work\nin the Slack account of a global, digital only news outlet called IRIN. We also inter-\nviewed all the journalists working at the newsroom.\nOur research found that Slack deepened relationships between journalists and enabled\nnew creative practices across geographic regions. However, it also contributed to the\nerasure of the line between private and professional spheres for workers, and introduced\nnew opportunities for management to shape newsroom culture. We argue that the con-\ncept of `space' as developed by David Harvey can helpfully frame the analysis of these\nnew, important digital platforms. In the literature review that follows, we expand on this\napproach, and integrate the discussion with industry commentary about OCS and Slack.\nJournalistic practice in digital spaces\nVirtual newsrooms can be considered `spaces'in the sense that geographers use the term:\na social construction that is continuously produced and reproduced by its users (e.g.\nLefebvre, 1991). Harvey (2006), one of the most prominent theorists of space, draws a\nhighly influential distinction between absolute space, relative space and relational space.\nJournalism researchers have started to use this distinction to inform their analyses of\nnewsrooms, news practices, and technological change (e.g. Robinson, 2011; Usher,\n2015; Zaman, 2013). We argue that it is a particularly helpful for analysing virtual news-\nrooms because it shifts the focus beyond the physical to consider the properties of space\nmore generally, including how digital platforms may facilitate some experiences, rela-\ntionships and power dynamics over others (see also Robinson and Metzler, 2016).\nImportantly, it does not privilege either physical space or digital space but sees these\nexisting in tension with one another.\nIn Harvey's (2006) schema, absolute space refers to the physical, material existence\nof something that can be counted, measured, observed. It is in this sense that virtual\nnewsrooms are, of course, very different from physical newsrooms. The physical news-\nroom has desks, chairs, offices, meeting rooms, office coolers and so on with physical,\nmaterial properties. Virtual newsrooms, by contrast, exist via a device, and can be\naccessed from anywhere that has Internet access.\nThe second type of space \u00ad `relative space'\u00ad draws our attention to perspective; it sug-\ngests that a space means different things to people depending on their situation. This may\nbe because of distance (how far an individual is from a particular space), or it might reflect\nan individual's personal characteristics or resources. For example, a virtual newsroom\nmay mean something different to a user who has a slow Internet connection, is logging in\nfrom a busy family holiday, has a precarious employment contract, or who cannot fluently\ncommunicate in the lingua franca. Relative space reminds us that distance and resources\nmay still matter \u00ad even when users see the same text on their device screens.\nInitial commentary suggests that the introduction of Slack can have a profound impact\non relative space in the newsroom. Most significantly, because it provides a central locus\nand meeting point that all journalists can access, regardless of their location. Journalists\nwho work remotely from traditional, physical newsrooms have described feeling\nestranged from the culture and comradery of their organisation, and less able to collabo-\nrate and share information (e.g. Hannerz, 2004). In addition, remote journalists may not\nbe exposed to the daily interactions that have been identified as pivotal for sharing and\nsolidifying organisational norms (e.g. Breed, 1955).\nSlack provides a virtual newsroom that is `equidistant' for all participants, and this\nmay increase collaboration between remote journalists. The platform also brings journal-\nists into more constant exposure with one another as well as `organisational chatter',\nwhich may support the development of team culture and norms. In an article for the\nNeiman Foundation, Owen (2015) asked eight editors how Slack had changed their\norganisational work processes. The editors stated that it increased journalistic collabora-\ntion and helped foster a sense of team among previously dislocated workers. As one\ncommented, `Slack is one of the threads that holds our internationally distributed teams\ntogether. We use it ... to foster team-building and camaraderie with remote colleagues'.\nIn a similar vein, Alexis Madrigal, the editor-in-chief at Fusion states, `We're a big\norganisation with offices in Miami and New York, Oakland and L.A. It's a lot of people\nto keep track of, so Slack is kind of our national office in the cloud' (Owen, 2015).\nThe third property of space in Harvey's schema is `relational'; spaces makes some\nrelationships possible, and these relationships, in turn, shape what a space means to\nusers. In a physical newsroom, for example, the location of journalists can influence their\nrelationships with one another, and their work processes (e.g. Josephi, 1998). Similarly,\nresearch has shown that digital platforms can transform the relational properties of news-\nrooms. Robinson (2011), for example, finds that online spaces operated as extensions of\nthe physical newsroom, and that relationships that develop in `virtual platforms'translate\ninto the physical newsroom:\nCliques formed electronically; jokes passed through the newsroom via text messages, leaving\nout those who did not `text' or check their e-mail constantly. Digitally flexible workers\ngravitated toward each other (virtually), whereas traditionalists found support for each other (in\nWhile there has been no empirical academic research on Slack's impact on relation-\nships, industry commentary suggests that it can create closely bonded teams. Writing for\nSlate magazine, Hess (2015) argues that, because Slack's interface resembles social\nmedia, bonds form faster: `Chatting with your co-workers in the same way you commu-\nnicate with your friends helps accelerate the office bond ... running jokes lead to a shared\nhistory, and a shared history is culture' (see also Rosenberg, 2015).\nOne of the most important relationships in the newsroom is that between management\nand journalists. Researchers have argued that digital communication can make this rela-\ntionship less hierarchical (Deuze, 2007; Gurstein, 2001) because it enables simultaneous\ncommunication and puts more information in the public domain, increasing transpar-\nency. Slack (the company) claims that its platform is more egalitarian than email. As\nLeah Reich, the in-house user researcher at Slack writes,\nEmail is hierarchical and compartmentalized, and great for political manoeuvering. Blind\ncopying, or the bcc, is an example of that: your boss could be silently copied into an email\nchain. Email allows the sender to choose who to send information to, and who to exclude ...\n[Slack by contrast is] radical collaboration, a different way of working and thinking. (Quoted\nBut digital platforms also open up more opportunity for managerial surveillance, and\nmay create unreasonable labour demands and expectations (Loeschner, 2016; Rosenberg,\n2015) These platforms often track when users are online and active, and make this infor-\nmation available to others. In his famous metaphor of the Panopticon prison, Foucault\nargues that the mere act of observation can lead individuals to self-discipline: individuals\ninternalize power and therefore subject themselves to norms without the need for force\n(Foucault, 1991). As a result, it is possible that Slack may extend the indirect influence\nof management. It may also place more pressure on workers, as it puts the responsibility\nto be up to speed on individuals as opposed to requiring scheduled time and meetings to\nread or discuss work.\nIn one of the few studies to examine the management of remote journalists via digital\nplatforms, Hendrickson (2009) analyses journalists at Jezebel who collaborate through\ninstant messaging (IM). The study finds that IM increased lateral, egalitarian decision\nmaking at the outlet. But Hendrickson notes that management continued to wield signifi-\ncant control over news processes and organisational culture, and this fact was sometimes\nveiled by the seemingly casual communications taking place on IM. It is unclear whether\nthese dynamics would prevail on Slack and other OCS, which are group communication\ntools, rather than one to one messaging.\nHarvey (2006) argues that these three properties of space exist in tension, and can\nevolve: `it is impossible to disentangle space from time ... A wide variety of disparate\ninfluences swirling over space in the past, present and future concentrate and congeal at\na certain point to define the nature of that point' (p. 274). As such, it's important that we\npay attention to how norms, relationships and uses of a platform can change over time.\nHarvey's triptych helps focus our study of virtual newsrooms by identifying specific\ncharacteristics that these spaces may possess. Following this literature, and the early\ncommentary on Slack, our study asks three specific research questions. First, how did the\njournalists at IRIN use Slack? Here, we are interested in its absolute properties: when\nand how they use it, what kind of messages did they send? Second, did Slack change the\njournalists' perception of physical distance? Here, we are interested in the impact of\nSlack on relative space \u00ad did it change the journalists access to newsroom and its conver-\nsations, and increase their ability to collaborate? Third, how does Slack shape relation-\nships at the news organisation? Here, we are interested in Slack as a relational space.\nFollowing the literature, we are particularly interested in how it may have shaped the\nrelationships between journalists and each other, as well as with their managers.\nThe following section introduces the case study before the methods are outlined.\nThe case study: IRIN\nIRIN is the world's oldest and largest dedicated humanitarian newswire. For its first\n19years, it operated under the umbrella of the United Nations. In January 2015, it became\nan independent, not for profit, media outlet funded by charitable donations, grants and\nphilanthropy. The organisation describes itself as providing the `Inside story on emer-\ngencies', covering humanitarian events and issues around the globe. IRIN are digital\nonly; stories are published on their website, and they have a large social media\npresence.\nThe number, location and job title of employees fluctuated throughout the study but,\ngenerally speaking, consisted of 12 employees based in 7 countries. This included\nbetween 8 and 10 full-time editorial staff who were spread around the world, with small,\ninformal clusters of journalists in London and Nairobi. These journalists write content,\nas well as commission and edit the work of a large network of freelance journalists.\nIRIN is a `virtual team'. That is, a group of people `who work interdependently with\nshared purpose across space, time, and organisation boundaries using technology to\ncommunicate and collaborate' (Lipnack and Stamps, 2000: 18). All daily communica-\ntions were done via digital platforms. Slack was introduced at IRIN in January 2015, and\nbecame the primary platform for internal communications. Prior to this, employees had\nrelied on email, which was generally used along vertical lines, with journalists in the\nfield pitching and reporting \"up\" to regional editors.\nIn addition to Slack, the journalists communicated in a group skype call each morning\nduring the working week. These meetings vary from quick conversations where each\njournalist listed their news stories, through to lengthy debates about the purposes of their\norganisation, reflecting on questions like, `what is humanitarianism?' During the study,\nthe team also experimented with a once weekly strategy skype call. However, poor\nInternet connections frequently interrupted these longer meetings, and they were discon-\ntinued. Outside the morning skype call, almost all internal communications took place\nthrough Slack.\nMethods\nThis article draws on data collected as part of a larger research project on humanitarian\njournalism (Scott, Bunce, Wright 2017a, 2017b). As part of this research, we spent a year\nstudying IRIN. Our project sought to explore all the factors that shaped the organisa-\ntion's news production, from their business model and journalistic niche, to the news\nvalues of individual journalists. We were particularly interested in how the move from\nUnited Nations funding to independent charitable status might shape humanitarian news\noutputs. The founding editor was also interested in this question and invited us to come,\nas independent researchers, to observe the transition. We made this arrangement in\nthe research, we realized that Slack had become a crucial tool at the organisation, and we\ndecided to add the role and impact of this digital platform as an additional focus in our\nresearch.\nWe explored the topic through interviews and ethnographic observations.Atotal of 25\nsemi-structured interviews lasting between 30 and 90 minutes were conducted with all\ncontracted staff at the news outlet. Every staff member (see Table 1) was interviewed at\nleast once, including managers, journalists, and the organisation's administrator. Long-\nserving members of staff were interviewed at least every 6 months, new members of staff\nwere interviewed a month after taking up the job, and those leaving were interviewed\nshortly after their departure.\nA large number of interviews were done face to face in February 2015 when the IRIN\nteam held a rare, in person meet up \u00ad their first as an independent news organisation. The\nremainder were primarily done by skype. In interviews, we asked the journalists to\nreflect on their use of Slack, as well as their relationships with one another and work\nprocesses. All the interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed for the journal-\nist's perception of Slack and its impact on their relationships, and work practices.\nWe also conducted extensive ethnographic observations in the news outlet's Slack\nnewsroom. We were given the login details at the same time as the journalists in January\n2015, when the organisations started using the platform. Every two or three days through-\nout the study period, we would observe the journalists on Slack, for anything from 15\nminutes to several hours. The goal of these observations was to understand how the\njournalists interacted in live time: `to capture the real-time interactions and dialogue that\nalso read back over the messages that had been sent since we last logged in, taking notes\non any interactions relevant to our research questions. These observations helped us tri-\nangulate the statements journalists made in interviews.\nWe also completed ethnographic observations in the weekday editorial meetings held\non skype. We observed approximately four daily editorial meetings and one weekly plan-\ntotal of 47 meetings, lasting between 20 and 60 minutes each. Finally, we attended a\n2-day annual strategy meeting held face to face with the IRIN team in London in February\n2015. In these fora, we were able to observe the journalists describe their use and percep-\ntion of Slack.\nOne limitation of our study was that we could not observe private one-to one messag-\ning on Slack (`Dark Slack', as we came to call it). We attempted to address this by asking\nour interviewees to describe how and when they chose to use private rather than public\nchannels. A second, more conceptual limitation concerned the challenge of establishing\nthe impact Slack has on production practices. We do not have counterfactual data: we do\nnot know what the outlet's work practices would have looked like had they not introduced\nthe platform. However, there were many long-standing employees in the company who\ncould describe the practices prior to the introduction of Slack. Moreover, our study began\nat the same time that the organisation started using Slack, meaning that we could observe\nthe journalists initial experimentation, learning, and normalization of the platform, as well\nas how they talked about it in their editorial meetings throughout this process.\nTable 1.

Here, we are interested in its absolute properties: when\nand how they use it, what kind of messages did they send? This section provides context\nfor the rest of the study as well as, we hope, providing descriptive information that may\nbe helpful for researchers examining Slack in other contexts.\nIRIN used Slack as a professional tool to coordinate and collaborate on news produc-\ntion. The journalists all had Slack on their phone and laptops, and with staff in multiple\ntime zones, there was almost always someone online. The majority of interactions were\nprofessional in their topic and tone, and focused on the news production process, but there\nwas the occasional more light-hearted discussion and banter. During the study period, the\njournalists set up and used 21 channels. These were primarily set up by the IRIN managers\n\u00ad the managing editor and chief executive, and, at their instruction, the admin team. The\nbelow list outlines the key functions that journalists used these channels for\n1. Sharing and developing story ideas. Slack was used to pitch and develop story\nideas. This was done on three channels in particular: #dailymeetings #storyideas\nand #intheworks. When there was a very big story, the journalists set up a specific\nchannel to manage the reporting. This happened twice during the study, in both\ninstances in the wake of natural disasters. This allowed for quick exchanges of\ninformation about what was happening, almost like a live newsblog (How many\nare hurt? Is the airport open?). This information was then used directly in news\noutputs, particularly a live rolling blog on IRIN's website. It was also used to\ncoordinate the news response and reduce the duplication of effort.\n2. Framing and editing decisions took place in a number of channels, including\n#headlines, where journalists would ask for input and brainstorm the wording of\nstory headlines. In #style, they would clarify the use of terms and debate semantic\nissues. #Photos was used to discuss accompanying images, and #socialmedia\nlooked at how to promote and send out news.\n3. Sharing audience responses \u00ad the IRIN journalists also use Slack to share notes\non the reception of stories. For example, the #feedback channel where they\nrelayed audience comments, and #impact which noted when IRIN content was\nused or shared by important people or policy documents.\n4. Organisational logistics \u00ad the journalists used Slack to note details such as their leave\ndates, IT troubles, and payment issues under the channel #admin and #itandweb.\nSeveral of the core IRIN team are commissioning editors, and they posted details\nabout available freelancers, location and payment details in #stringers.\n5. Likes and dislikes \u00ad two channels were dedicated to sharing news stories, ideas\nand announcements that the journalists either liked (#thingswelike) or didn't\n(#thingswedontlikemuch). These discussed things that happened in the humani-\ntarian sector generally, and were also used to praise, critique or parody other\norganisation's coverage.\n6. Miscellaneous - a #general channel captured everything else that was important,\nand a #random channel captured everything else that was unimportant (a funny\ngif from the Internet).\nIn addition to these public channels, the journalists used private messaging through-\nout the day. In interviews, the journalists stated that they primarily used messaging to\ndeal with the more specific and technical elements of news production \u00ad the `nitty gritty\neditorial stuff' (Interview, 20 February 2015) such as checking the details of a source, or\nasking when a photo would arrive; `rather than put it out on a general channel which just\nclogs up that channel, if it's kind of how you're getting along with that story ... details'\n(Interview, 22 May 2015). The editors and journalists also described using private mes-\nsaging for more sensitive conversations, for example, to provide feedback to journalists\non their stories when this was delicate or critical, or to check in on their friends.\nGenerally speaking, the journalists thought that Slack led to efficiency gains. One\nstated, `it's useful also to have all those different ... parallel conversations happening in\ndifferent rooms, and channels' (Interview, 16 February 2016). But some felt that this\ncame at a cost in terms of erasing the dividing line between private and professional time\n(discussed further below).\nSome found the platform highly addictive and struggled to turn it off in weekends and\nevenings. One journalist returning from holiday asked, for example,\nJournalist 1: What did I miss? What excitement?\nJournalists 2:\nI saw your green button on Slack a few times. I was worried that you\nwere actually tuning in, in your absence.\nJournalist 1: Well, I would say, with half an ear; it's hard to turn off\nReflecting on this in an editorial skype, a journalist coined the phrase, `Slack is crack'.\nDuring the workday, some also found the omnipotence of the chat distracting:\nSometimes you need just a couple of hours just to shut everything off ... to be productive, and\nall these collaborations sometimes, you know, especially with the headlines channels and things\nlike that, everyone wants to chip in you can get sucked into the conversations, you know, `cos\nanything's better than writing, right?\nPart of the danger, the journalist believed, was that `you can kid yourself you're work-\ning if you're contributing to a conversation in Slack' (Interview, 20 February 2015).\nInterestingly, a similar observation was made at the news outlet Slate, where journalists\nfound that chatting on the platform `satiated' their desire to publish news articles (Hess,\n2015). The managing editor at IRIN shared the concerns of staff that Slack may get in the\nway of creative work, and told the team:\nFor the future projects, we need to get back to adding kind of a unique edge to what we're doing\n... And if that means for half a day a week you disconnect from Slack and the news cycle, go\nand meet people, that's fine. (Team skype meeting, 14 April 2015)\nRQ2: Did Slack increase connection and collaboration\nacross geographic distance?\nInitial commentary suggests that the introduction of Slack can have a profound impact\non relative space in the newsroom. In particular, it provides a central platform for\ngeographically dispersed journalists that may foster connection and collaboration. We\nfound this was the case at IRIN, where Slack supported extensive collaboration across\nremote geographic locations. This included, first, logistical collaboration: the journalists\nfrequently asked their colleagues around the world for information and advice on every-\nthing from the name of contacts to recommendations for transport; it was a `hive mind',\nwhere individuals could draw on the knowledge of the group. Second, it included crea-\ntive collaboration around story ideas and angles. It was common for one journalist to\npost an idea and others to quickly chip in, suggesting new angles and leads. Notably, this\ncollaboration often took place between journalists who were geographically remote. The\nfollowing quite typical exchange, for example, involved three journalists: one in\nBangkok, one in London, and one in Oxford (UK):\nJournalist 1: \nI don't know if there's an angle in this for us yet, but ... our new (and\nvery good) string in kabul is working on a story about people fleeing\nAfghanistan to Europe ...\nJournalist 2: i\nf it's of interest the Afghan family I helped in Lesbos had lost their\nmiddle son while crossing the border out of Iran ... have the story and\npictures\nJournalist 3: \nI had a pitch last week from [another stringer] who wants to do some-\nthing focused on Afghans' journey through Europe which tends to be\nrougher than for the Syrians so maybe we can meld the two or run\nthem as a series.\nThis discussion, and many like it, resulted in a thematic story that brought together\nfacts and sources from different regions of the world. This is a notable observation, given\nthat one of the biggest criticisms of international news content is its sporadic, episodic\nnature. Stephen Ward argues that the challenges facing the world \u00ad environmental, eco-\nnomic, political and social \u00ad do not take place in isolation; as such, one of international\njournalism's key jobs is to connect dots and identify patterns across regions (Ward,\n2010). Our study suggests that Slack can help disassociated teams do exactly this.\nPrior to the introduction of Slack, physical distance had a greater impact on news-\nwork: trans-bureau collaboration and information sharing was rare. Journalists worked\nindependently on their region or beat, and generally pitched `up' via email to an editor,\nwho was the only person with oversight of the daily output, meaning far less scope for\nhorizontal collaboration. The Managing Editor, who had worked at IRIN for 5 years prior\nto Slack's introduction described the arrangement:\nBefore we each worked in isolation, and now someone has an idea, they'll put it on Slack,\nsomeone from a different bureau will say `Oh yeah, I noticed a similar trend here' or `Hey, you\nshould totally talk to this guy' or `Does anyone have a contact for x?' so I feel we're all a little\nQuick fire brainstorming was particularly common in the #headline channel, where\njournalists rapidly suggested phrases, tweaking and building on each others' ideas, as\nillustrated in the following exchange between three journalists spread between Nairobi,\nLondon and Oxford:\nJournalist 1:\nPhoto feature on survivor stories who were rescued in the med. what\nshall we call it? Rescued in the Mediterranean: `We thank God we are\nalive!?'...\nJournalist 2: can't we be more narrative?\nJournalist 1: In a headline?\nJournalist 2:\nReportage: After days at sea, shipwreck survivors turn up alive on\nEurope's shores or whatever\nJournalist 1: Crossing the Mediterranean in a rubber dinghy: survival stories...\nJournalist 3: \nRescued! Survivors recount Med ordeal (we use so many question\nmarks, time to mix up the punctuation a bit)\nJournalist 1: \nRescued! From shipwreck to safety If you can call a deflating dingy a\nshipwreck ...\nThese frequent interactions also helped the journalists develop organisational norms\njust as a physical newsroom may do (e.g. Breed, 1955). During our study, IRIN was in a\nparticular state of flux. As noted above, the outlet had become independent from the\nUnited Nations, and was searching for new funding streams as well as a new, independ-\nent identify. This involved debates from board level down about IRIN's purpose and\nvalues. Against this backdrop, Slack was a platform where journalists could debate the\nboundaries of their news beat, and establish reporting norms. Journalists would post a\nstory idea, and ask the group, `is it humanitarian enough?', `is this too inside baseball?'\nor `how do I do this in an IRIN-ish way?'\nThese debates about the boundaries of the newsbeat were then visible to other journal-\nists and new hires, who could use Slack to help them `learn the ropes' \u00ad just as Perkel\n(2017) described a lab of scientists using the platform. In addition, they could message\nto quickly seek clarification on small points. One journalist described a new hire learning\nthe boundaries of the beat: `his private messages are about ... the distinction between\nhumanitarian and development and, you know, and that kind of murky line ... he seems\nto have fitted in very quickly and very well' (Interview, 1 October 2015).\nThese conversations \u00ad like many of the interactions on Slack \u00ad would be extremely\nchallenging or frustrating to have by email, and would likely be considered too minor to\ndiscus in the skype editorial meeting, particularly if there was trouble with the Internet\nconnection. As one journalist commented, `everyone's spread out all over the world \u00ad so\nwe use Slack really to avoid those endless emails which don't really work. Instead, eve-\nryone can communicate instantly on streamlined themes'(12 May 2016). In other words,\nSlack brought journalists in to the same `room' in a way that other technological plat-\nforms had not previously done. In doing so, it changed the properties of relative space at\nAlthough Slack facilitated collaboration across distance, the location that journalists\naccessed the platform from continued to matter. Counter-intuitively perhaps, the journal-\nists with the worst Internet connections found Slack the most valuable. Two journalists\n\u00ad one in West Africa, and one in South East Asia - had constant issues with their Internet\nand were rarely able to join the editorial skype conference calls. For these journalists,\nSlack was the only platform (outside of email) where they interacted with colleagues.\nOne noted: `group calls on skype were a disaster, but for the most part, even if I couldn't\nactually participate on the group calls, usually after [I would] be talking via Slack'.\nBy contrast, a cluster of journalists based in London would sometimes work together\nin the lounge of a flat. This created a small, more closely knit network with additional\nlayers of interaction above and beyond Slack. This group often included IRIN's editor\nand manager, and members of the admin team. A journalist who had spent time working\nin both London and remotely felt this made a big difference:\nThe thing on Slack that's difficult is ... [you] haven't quite got that feeling of `We're all working\ntogether on this one project' ... when things have worked is when you had everybody kind of\nchipping in and helping out, and that really in the London office was much better. (Interview, 1\nThere was also a strong connection between location and activity level, which meant\nthat geography continued to shape the user experience. It is possible to search the Slack\narchives for the handles of the IRIN employees, and see the number of times each user\nposted a public message or was publicly `tagged' by another user. These searches show\nthat employees based in the UK produced more than half of all the posts on Slack during\nour study (see Figure 1), meaning that Slack was busiest in the working hours of British\nStandard Time. By contrast, few messages were sent when the Asia correspondent was\nonline, meaning less opportunity to collaborate in live time.\nThese searches also identified big differences between how individual journalists\nused the platform. The Lebanon-based correspondent accounted for 14% of the handles\non Slack (almost the same percentage as four employees in Kenya combined). The\nSenegal-based correspondent, by contrast, posted only 4%. In interviews, these two jour-\nnalists suggested a number of factors behind their differing use of Slack. This included\nthe challenges of Internet and electricity where they were based, the amount of travel\nthey did for work, whether or not they were working on projects with other journalists,\nand their subjective enjoyment of online chat.\nThese findings further illustrate the appropriateness of using Harvey's (2006) con-\ncept of space to analyse OCS. As Harvey contends, space is inherently relative, and\nits meaning and significance can vary between individuals. Slack supported connec-\ntion and collaboration \u00ad which reduced the impact of physical distance on the news\nculture. But this did not mean the journalists had identical experiences of the space.\nFactors such as time zones and Internet connectivity \u00ad in addition to personal prefer-\nences \u00ad continued to influence their experience and feelings about the virtual\nnewsroom.\nRQ3: How does Slack shape relationships in the news\norganisation?\nHarvey argues that one of the key characteristics of space is relational; spaces make\nsome relationships possible and these relationships, in turn, shape what a space means to\nusers. In our final results section, we consider the way that Slack shaped relationships\nbetween journalists, as well as management at IRIN.\nThe industry commentary suggested that Slack may help build relationships between\nworkers. This is what we observed at IRIN. Almost every journalist commented that\nSlack helped them feel closer to their colleagues, and that it sparked and solidified friend-\nships that would not exist otherwise. One praised the platform for helping him `have\nrelationships with all of the people, direct relationships with all of the people in every\ndesk' \u00ad despite having not met in person (Interview, 30 January 2015). The journalists\nchatted on Slack throughout the workday \u00ad interacting far more than they had in the past.\nAs one commented, `it was a way of maintaining [connections]. Obviously not quite the\nsame as all being in the same room but better than ... corresponding only on email cause\nemail's not real-time' (Interview 16 February 2016). These comments echo the deep\nresearch literature showing that the widespread adoption of any technology can promote\nnew connective patterns among formerly disassociated workers (e.g. Haythornthwaite,\nMore broadly, Slack helped create a team identity at IRIN because conversations that\nmight have been one-to-one in the past were now communal. One user commented,\nThat's what I'm loving about this new IRIN, is that a lot of that [is] happening on the public\nchannels like `Oh, happy birthday'or `Hey, did you see ha ha', a lot of that seems to be a shared\nexperience across the whole team, which I've found really refreshing. (Interview, 23 June\nInteractions on Slack were often light-hearted; a #random channel was used to share\nweird and wonderful things from the Internet, for example, and one senior journalist\nFigure 1. Location of employees messaging / tagged on Slack.1\nenjoyed customizing the welcome message to make fun of his colleagues. A journalist\ndescribed this banter as supporting `nice little bits of bonding'(Interview, 22 May 2015).\nSlack improved team spirit, as the duty editor told the Board members at the annual\nmeeting: `It's very good for feedback and, generally, for the morale of the team, so that\neveryone knows they're part of something, and they can interact on it, rather than just\nfeeling isolated. It's really become quite an essential tool' (12 May 2016).\nSlack also became an important space for mediating the relationship between the\nmanager and the journalists. Several commentators have predicted that Slack will create\nmore egalitarian or lateral power structure (e.g. Kiss, 2016). Our findings on this ques-\ntion were mixed. As noted above, the journalists did have more opportunity to contribute\nto creative practice at the news outlet than they had in the past. There was, for example,\na lot of peer-to-peer discussion around how the humanitarian news beat should be\ndefined. This contrasts with the previous `spoke and wheel' arrangement at the organisa-\ntion, where journalists tended to communicate up to their editor rather than laterally.\nIn addition, interactions on Slack were largely informal and all members felt they\ncould contribute to conversations. Indeed, such was the egalitarian nature, that there\nwere occasions when it wasn't clear who was in charge. Early in the study, for example,\na breaking news story took place over a weekend. The editor posted some ideas on Slack,\nand assumed the journalists would act on these. This was not clear to the journalists,\nsome of whom did not see the posts or recognize them as a request. As one commented\nafterwards, `I completely understand that this is a breaking news story, but who's in\ncharge?... If you wanted to do something, call' (Interview, 22 May 2015). If the same\ncomments had been made in an editorial meeting, the journalists would likely have rec-\nognized them as instructions, suggesting that they do not see Slack as a particularly\nhierarchical space.\nAnother way that Slack appears to support more egalitarian working conditions is that\nit provides a permanent platform for management to share information about strategic\ndecisions and key performance indicators. For example, monthly progress reports were\nshared on IRIN's Slack, showing which stories had performed well. An admin stated that\n`It's also shared with the team to help them better understand what's working online,\nwhat's popular and how well we've done at the end of each month' (Interview, 29 May\n2015). This may increase organisational transparency. But it is important to remember\nthat information can also be strategically shared (or withheld) as a form of discipline \u00ad\nencouraging journalists to focus on particular ideas or measurements, such as the audi-\nence metrics. Thus, although Slack has the potential to create a `flattening' of hierarchy\nthrough its increased transparency (Rosenberg, 2015), this may not be how it operates in\npractice.\nOur study also found that Slack creates opportunities for managerial teams to shape\ngroup culture and practice. Indeed, top-down management is inherent in the platform's\narchitecture. Although most journalists could, in practice, set up a new channel, at IRIN\nthis was generally done by senior staff. The existence of these channels may then inform\nthe range of topics that are discussed, moving conversations towards managerial priori-\nties. For example, `impact' is an important consideration for non-profit news organisa-\ntions such as IRIN that seek funding from private foundations and governments. These\nnews outlets are often required to demonstrate the impact of their journalism in order to\nsecure grants. Because of the importance of impact to the managers at IRIN, there was a\nSlack channel dedicated to measuring it, which sent a clear signal to journalists about its\nimportance. As one journalists had noticed, `impact is to be...trumpeted, that's why\nthere's an impact channel on Slack \u00ad the more impact the better' (Interview, 16 February\nIn addition, Slack provides a permanent platform for managers to give `public' praise\nand censure to their employees, which constitutes an important form of influence in the\ndigital newsroom (Bunce, 2017). Editors praise journalists and articles they deem appro-\npriate, and criticize those which are not, sending messages about organisational priori-\nties. The managing editor, for example, describes using Slack to give an individual's\nfeedback publically in an attempt to change behaviour across the organisation: `when it's\nmore critical stuff ... you know \"This article, it really didn't work for me\" ... I intention-\nally made that public so that we can all engage in that discussion' (Interview, 23 May\n2015). Slack was also used to send specific praise to stories that were doing well. Several\njournalists were sensitive about the use of Slack for these `herograms'that elevated some\nwork (and journalists) above others.\nFinally and importantly, the omnipresence of Slack was also perceived by some staff\nas a form of surveillance and a source of stress. The name of each user is listed on the left\nhand bar with a small dot indicating whether they are online and available. One journalist\ncommented,\nI do end up working very late and being on there all the time and I, I genuinely don't know\nwhether that's a kind of ... a peer pressure thing. It almost becomes a kind of unconscious,\n`macho-er than thou type thing ... you see people that were on there from ten or midnight ... I\nthink that puts a greater pressure on the [individual] to time-manage themselves and to set their\nThis was not necessarily the intention of management. Indeed, as noted above, the\nmanaging editor had told IRIN employees to leave Slack if they needed space to think or\nmore time to do more `on the ground' investigations. Nonetheless \u00ad as Foucault argues\n\u00ad the simple act of monitoring can result in employees self-policing their own behaviour;\nthe sense of being visible can encourage journalists to comply with managerial priorities,\nwithout needing to be asked. This pressure may be felt particularly strongly by workers\non casual contrasts, worried about their future employment.\nIn sum, then, Slack had a significant impact on relationships at IRIN. First, because it\nmade journalists feel a lot closer and more connected to one another. Its impact on the\nrelationship between journalists and management was more ambiguous. On the one\nhand, it opened up the possibility for more horizontal conversations about important\nissues at the organisation. For the first time, journalists could have extensive conversa-\ntions with one another, not just their editors and line managers. On the other hand, man-\nagement could use the constant platform to send public messages of praise and censure.\nAnd because the manager and administrative team tend to control the settings, there is\nscope to push conversations in certain directions. As Harvey suggests, one of the most\nimportant properties of any space, such as Slack, is the way in which it changes and\nshapes relationships.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nThis article has provided the first analysis of how remotely working journalists collabo-\nrate in a virtual newsroom supported by Online Collaborative Software. Our year-long\nobservations and interviews found that this virtual space supported many of the functions\nthat a traditional, place-based newsroom does. The journalists at IRIN used Slack to share\nideas and make news production decisions, and they developed friendships and organisa-\ntional norms through its channels. The team felt more connected, collaboration increased\nand it supported the production of cross-boundary, global journalism. Slack also created\nmore opportunities for managerial incursion, and pressure on journalistic time.\nIRIN is just one news organisation. Their geographic spread, employees and market\nniche are all unique. In particular, IRIN journalists are highly specialized, have a colle-\ngiate respect for each other's expertise, and they adopted Slack very comprehensively:\nusing it to replace almost all internal communication. These variables may create a\nunique experience of Slack. Our study cannot, therefore, reach firm conclusions about\nthe impact the introduction of Slack will have in different contexts. Rather, this study\noperates as a `revelatory' case study (Yin, 2003: 42), including descriptive information\nthat can be tested in future work. It would be helpful to see future research testing our\nfindings in other team dynamics, and exploring whether different digital layouts and\nplatforms \u00ad both within Slack and on other OCS \u00ad may support different practices.\nMore theoretically, our article has suggested how other researchers might study and\ntheorize these platforms in the future. We have argued that the tripartite concept of space,\nas developed by Harvey, is a useful theoretical framework for analysing OCS. As Harvey\nargues, and our research has demonstrated, a space like Slack has absolute, relative and\nrelational properties, and examining these helps us understand what a space means to\nparticipants. This approach has a number of strengths.\nFirst, by drawing attention to relative space, we are reminded that individuals use and\nexperience technology differently from one another. As we saw at IRIN, some individu-\nals were prolific users of Slack, others were not; some loved it, others found it a source\nof stress. We cannot assume that the impact of new technology will be consistent across\nthe organisation \u00ad a fact that can be overlooked in the journalism literature that often\nfocuses on the macro and meso level of organisational practice (Schudson, 2003).\nSecond, Harvey posits that spaces do not exist independently of how people make use\nof them, and the relationships they facilitate. Our study has illustrated how digital plat-\nforms may create new power dynamics; and suggested that these power dynamics may\nreside in the very architecture of the space, and the categories into which users must\nplace their thoughts before being able to articulate them to other users. Our research adds\nfurther evidence to Hendrickson's (2009) contention that this casual and chatty appear-\nance can veil managerial influence on these platforms.\nFinally, Harvey's approach is sensitive to temporal dynamics. Many of our observa-\ntions related to the users' experience of time \u00ad its impact on productivity and wasted\ntime; its blurring of the boundaries between personal time and professional time; the\nmanner in which time zones created different `types' of Slack for users. It is crucial that\nwe take these into account if we are to understand what a platform means to users. As\nHarvey (2006) writes, `it is impossible to disentangle space from time ... A wide variety\nof disparate influences swirling over space in the past, present and future concentrate and\ncongeal at a certain point to define the nature of that point' (p. 274).\nIt is worth underlining a final point: the remarkable potential of Slack and other OCS\nas research sites. It may be difficult to access an organisation's virtual newsroom as news\norganisations are often sensitive about sharing access to internal communications with\nethnographers (Robinson and Metzler, 2016: 456). However, where this is achieved, the\nsheer quantity and depth of data, from an ethnographic point of view, is phenomenal.\nResearchers can observe multiple simultaneous interactions, rather than being limited to\none physical position in the newsroom. And significantly, Slack is already in textual\nform. This makes it practical to study very large quantities of communication using con-\ntent analysis tools. Researchers can quantify interactions, relationships and change over\ntime: what words are used, in proximity to which others, who speaks to whom, what\ntopics they address and so on. This enables an exciting new lens to view journalistic\nproduction. As well as altering journalism practices, Slack may change the way research-\ners study them.\n"
