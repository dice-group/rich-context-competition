    "abstract": "Abstract: Previous research has shown that individuals who are reminded of their death\nexhibited a greater desire for offspring than those who were not reminded of their death.\nThe present research investigated whether being reminded of mortality affects mate\nselection behaviors, such as facial preference judgments. Prior research has shown that\nwomen prefer more masculine faces when they are at the high versus low fertility phase of\ntheir menstrual cycles. We report an experiment in which women were tested either at their\nhigh or fertility phase. They were randomly assigned to either a mortality salience (MS) or\ncontrol condition and then asked to judge faces ranging from extreme masculine to extreme\nfeminine. The results showed that women's choice of the attractive male face was\ndetermined by an interaction between fertility phase and condition. In control conditions,\nhigh fertility phase women preferred a significantly more masculine face than women who\nwere in a lower fertility phase of their menstrual cycles. In MS conditions, high fertility\nphase women preferred a significantly less masculine (i.e., more average) face than women\nwho were in a low fertility phase. The results indicate that biological processes, such as\nfertility phase, involved in mate selection are sensitive to current environmental factors,\nsuch as death reminders. This sensitivity may serve as an adaptive compromise when\nchoosing a mate in potentially adverse environmental conditions.\n",

Studies of birth rates following natural and man-\nmade disasters have shown that increases in birth rates following such events (Cohen and\nCole, 2002; Rodgers et al., 2005). Also, experiments have shown that reminding people of\nmortality can increase their desire for offspring (Fritsche et al., 2007; Wisman and\nGoldenberg, 2005). These experiments and many others conducted over the last 20 years\nprovide support for terror management theory (TMT, Greenberg, Pyszczynski, and\nSolomon, 1986; Solomon, Greenberg, and Pyszczynski, 1991; See Greenberg, Solomon,\nand Arndt, 2008). One of the core tenets of TMT is that reminders of mortality cause a\nunique change in attitudes and behaviors. The purpose of the present research was to\ninvestigate whether reminding one about their mortality can influence other human\nreproductive choices, specifically how women evaluate the faces of potential mates.\nResearch on the effect of death reminders on behavior has been viewed as support\nfor TMT, which was inspired by the writings of the cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker\n(1973) who stated that humans, unlike other animals, have the cognitive capabilities to\nrealize that they will die, which causes deep anxiety. According to Becker, to alleviate this\nanxiety, humans invest in a shared cultural conception of reality or a cultural worldview.\nThese worldviews not only answer existential questions, such as where did we come from\nand what should we do, they also provide self-esteem, which buffers the anxiety of\nmortality. Cultural worldviews also provide an avenue to immortality. By meeting or\nexceeded the demands of the culture, humans can achieve a literal immortality as with\nreligion, or a symbolic immortality. Symbolic immortality can be achieved by contributing\nto a meaningful society in such a way that will continue after the individual has died.\nIndividuals can also achieve immortality by producing children that carry on their genes. In\nany case, thoughts of death are pushed to the back of the mind.\nEmpirical support for Becker's writings and TMT has come from reminding\nindividuals of their mortality (mortality salience, MS; Rosenblatt et al., 1989). MS is\ngenerally manipulated by having the participant describe in writing what will happen to\nthem as they physically die and the emotions that arise from the thoughts of their own\ndeath. Participants assigned to a control condition describe in writing what will happen to\nthem physically as they experience an event that does not involve death, such as dental\nappointment or watching television and the emotions that arise from the thoughts of the\nevent. According to TMT, reminding individuals of their mortality should increase\nadherence to their particular cultural worldview and set of cultural values (Rosenblatt et al.,\n1989). This adherence to a cultural worldview not only gives individuals a sense of unity\nwith others, but also gives the individual a sense of being a part of something greater than\nthemselves and something that will endure after the individual ceases to exist. Prior\nresearch has shown that participants in MS conditions defend cultural norms more\ndiligently and regard those who do not uphold culture norms less favorably than\nparticipants in control conditions (Greenberg et al., 1990; Greenberg et al., 1994;\nRosenblatt et al., 1989). This stronger adherence to cultural values seems to be unique to\nthoughts concerning death.\nIn addition to defending cultural norms after MS, it has been proposed that\nindividuals attempt to deny their mortality by passing on their genes (Fritsche et al., 2007;\nWisman and Goldenberg, 2005). Several TMT studies have provided cross-cultural\nThe effects of mortality\nevidence that the desire for children and the perception of children is influenced by death\nreminders. In Germany, participants were randomly assigned either to an MS condition or a\ncontrol condition and then asked to self-report their desire for children (Wisman and\nGoldenberg, 2005). After MS, men demonstrated a stronger desire for children than men in\nthe control condition. In a separate study, women were randomly assigned to be primed\nwith bogus newspaper articles reporting either the compatibility or incompatibility of\nhaving children and a career and were then randomly assigned to an MS or a control\ncondition. Women who were in the children/career compatible group demonstrated a\nstronger desire for children following MS while participants in the children/incompatible\ngroup did not. In the Netherlands participants were randomly assigned to an MS or a\ncontrol condition and were later asked about their desire for having any children in the\nfuture and the strength of their desire for children (Fritsche et al., 2007). The results\nindicated that after MS both men and women showed a significantly greater desire for\nchildren compared with participants in a control condition. Similar results have been found\nin China (Zhou, Lei, Marley, and Chen, 2009). After MS participants viewed images of\nbabies longer than the control group participants. Individuals in an MS condition were also\nless likely to complete word fragments with death related words if they had viewed images\nof baby animals in comparison to participants that had viewed images of adult animals. It\nhas also been found that after being reminded of death, Chinese participants were less\nlikely to support birth control (Zhou, Liu, Chen, and Yu, 2008). Lastly, it has been shown\nthat after MS individuals are more likely to endorse risky sexual behaviors that could result\nin pregnancy in America (Hirschberger, Florian, Mikulincer, Goldenberg, and Pyszczynski,\nThese experimental studies showing that being reminded of death increases desire\nfor offspring are consistent with studies showing a relationship between increased birth\nrates and incidents of natural and man-made disasters. Cohen and Cole (2002) examined\nmarriage, birth, and divorce rates in the years following Hurricane Hugo that struck South\nCarolina in 1989. Birth rates across the state increased significantly from 10 births per\nThis was a significant increase when compared to the general decline of birth rates for\nSouth Carolina from the years 1975 up to 1990. The increase was most significant in the\n31 counties that were directly affected by the hurricane. In 2005, Rodgers, St. John, and\nColeman reported an examination of birth rates in several Oklahoma counties following the\n1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. The damage to\nthe downtown Oklahoma City area was extensive and resulted in the deaths of 168 persons\nof whom 19 were children. In the four years following the bombing, birth rates increased\nsignificantly each year in Oklahoma County, the county in which Oklahoma City is\n1999. When compared to the other counties in Oklahoma, it was found that this increased\nbirth rate was unique to Oklahoma County.\nPrior research has also shown that persistent environmental stressors, which may\nresult in individuals being reminded of death routinely in daily life, also appear to play a\nrole in birth rates. Wilson and Daly (1997) examined the birth rates in several Chicago\nneighborhoods that had either long or short life expectancies based on information for the\nyears 1988 to 1993. In the neighborhoods with the shorter life expectancies, crimes such as\nThe effects of mortality\npersons per year for the short life expectancy neighborhoods compared with roughly 25 per\nBirth rates in the short life expectancy neighborhoods were 190 births per 1,000 persons for\nyear. By contrast, the birth rates for the long life expectancy neighborhoods were\nbirths per 1,000 persons per year for women aged 20-24. While these differences are\nstriking it should be noted that the differences in birth rates could also be associated with\nlack of education in matters related to family planning.\nIn the present research, we investigated the extent to which being reminded of death\ncould influence how women evaluate the faces of potential mates and how the influence of\ndeath reminders might interact with biological determinants of face judgments. Humans\nare unique in that they do not have to directly experience death reminders, such as in a\nnatural disaster, to be able to contemplate death, and have those cognitions influence their\nbehavior, as evidenced by TMT studies. Whether death reminders can influence mate\npreferences is less well known, though time perception has been shown to influence social\nresource exploitation (Kruger, Reischl, and Zimmerman, 2008).\nThere are numerous studies demonstrating that women's judgments of men's faces\nare related to biological factors (See Schaefer, Mitteroecker, Fink, and Bookstein, 2009).\nThis is particularly the case when making a judgment concerning facial attractiveness of a\npotential mate. At points of low fertility women tend to choose faces that are more\n`feminized' as being attractive however at points of high fertility women tend to choose\nfaces that are more masculine as being attractive (Fink and Penton-Voak, 2002; Johnston\nJohnston and Oliver-Rodriguez, 1997; Little, Jones, and Burris, 2007; Little, Jones, Burt,\nPenton-Voak et al., 1999; Scarbrough and Johnston, 2005). The presence of masculine\nfeatures is associated with high levels of testosterone. Testosterone is toxic in high levels\nand the ability to sustain these high levels of testosterone may act as a signal of genetic\nfitness. Research has also shown that highly masculine features are associated with socially\nnegative attributes while more feminized features are associated with more pro-social\nJohnston, et al., 2001). These biologically influenced choices ultimately reflect an adaptive\ncompromise; when to choose good genes and when to choose a good father.\nIn our research, we utilized a paradigm that has been used successfully in prior\nresearch investigating women's preferences for mates. Women are shown a continuum of\nmale faces, varying in masculinity and are asked to select a face that corresponded to an\n\"attractive male.\" Prior research has shown that women's preferences for attractive male\nfaces is influenced by their fertility phase. Faces selected during high fertility phrases are\nsignificantly more masculine than faces selected during low fertility phases of low risk\nIn the present paper, we report an experiment carried out using the faces created by\nJohnston et al. (2001). We hypothesized that women who experience death reminders may\nengage in different reproductive strategies than women who do not experience death\nreminders. Life History Theory (LHT) provides a coherent framework in which to\nunderstand the allocation of resources toward survival and reproductive effort across the\nThe effects of mortality\nlifespan. Reproductive effort is further divided into mating and parenting effort. The\nallocation of resources is heavily influenced by developmental as well as current contextual\nwomen express a preference for a monogamous relationship to a man who will invest\nheavily in her and her children (Geary, Vigil, and Byrd-Craven, 2004; Whissel, 1996).\nWe hypothesized that women who are reminded of death during a high fertility\nphase would prefer signals of investment over \"good genes.\" LHT posits that reproductive\ndecisions are based on trade-offs. In the case of mortality salience, we predicted that it\nwould be in the best interest of a woman to have a high investing, and thus possibly less\nmasculine partner to assist in childcare in the event of her death. Local mortality risks as\nwell as other contextual factors have been shown to influence women's reproductive\nstrategies (Belsky, Steinberg and Draper, 1991; Brumbach, Figueredo, and Ellis, 2009;\nDaly and Wilson, 1988; Draper and Harpending, 1982). Our study determines whether\nthinking about one's own death influences mate preferences.\nIn the experiment, we randomly assigned heterosexual women who were in a high\nfertility phase or low fertility phrase to either an MS or control condition and asked them to\nmake judgments about male faces. As in Johnston et al. (2001), we asked women to make 8\nface selections: a) the attractive male face; b) the average male face; c) the dominant male\nface; d) the healthy male face; e) the masculine male face; f) the intelligent male face; g)\nthe good-father male face; and h) and the androgynous face. Regarding predictions for the\naverage male face, dominant male face, healthy male face, masculine male face, intelligent\nmale face, good-father male face, and the androgynous face we expected to replicate the\nfindings of Johnston et al.'s (2001) study that showed no significant differences in choices\nbetween women who were at a high fertility phase in their menstrual cycles and those at a\nlower fertility phase. Regarding predictions for women's preferences for the attractive male\nface, we expected to replicate the results of Johnson et al. (2001) and Penton-Voak and\nPerrett (2000) showing that women during the highly fertile phase of their menstrual cycles\nprefer significantly more masculine faces than women in a lower fertility phase. Further,\nwe expected to find that the effect of MS would also influence women's judgments. We\nexpected MS to increase desire for offspring in women in both the higher and lower\nfertility phases and lead them to choose a significantly more masculine face than those\nwomen in both the higher and lower fertility phases in the control condition.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nOne hundred thirty nine women, who identified as heterosexual and who were not\ntaking hormone-based contraception, participated in the study. All were undergraduates\nenrolled in psychology courses at Oklahoma State University. Their age range was 18 to 29\n(M = 20, SD = 2.05). Participants received course credit for their participation.\nMaterials and Procedure\nEligible participants were identified from a pre-screener survey that is taken at the\nbeginning of each semester and required of all participants enrolled in the Department of\nPsychology's research participant pool. The pre-screener survey consisted of questions\nconcerning sexual orientation, use of hormone-based birth control, date of last menses,\nThe effects of mortality\nlength of cycle, and regularity or irregularity of their cycles. The participants used in this\nstudy were those that identified as heterosexual, not using hormone-based birth control, and\nhad regular menstrual cycles. Ovulation generally occurs 14 days prior to the onset of\nmenses in women regardless of cycle length (Fluhman, 1957; Lein, 1979; Matsumoto,\nNogami, and Okhuri, 1962) with the high points of fertility being between days 10-17 of\nthe cycle and low fertility being between days 1-7 and 20-28 (Dunson, Baird, Wilcox, and\nWeinberg, 1999). Using the menstrual cycle information that the participants provided on\nthe pre-screener survey, a projection was made to determine when participants would be\neither in the high or low fertility point of their cycle. Participants were then contacted via\nemail to set up an individual appointment on the specific date that corresponded with the\nestimation of the point of either high or low fertility. When participants arrived to the\nsession, they were asked to confirm that they were not pregnant and not using hormone-\nbased birth control. To help guarantee that information from the pre-screener survey was\naccurate, participants were also asked to confirm the last onset of menses and length of\ntheir menstrual cycle. A second calculation was then performed to confirm that participants\nwere appropriately assigned to the high fertility or low fertility condition. Due to the large\nnumber of qualified participants in the participant pool, and due to the fact that participants\nwere only tested once, this method was deemed to be the most convenient.\nAll participants were also randomly assigned to either the MS or control condition.\nParticipants assigned to the MS group were given a form and asked to write about the\nemotions they feel about their own death and what they think will happen to them as they\nphysically die (Rosenblatt et al., 1989). Participants in the control group were also given a\nsimilar writing task in which the word `death' was replaced with the phrase `an upcoming\nexam' (Heine, Harihara, and Niiya, 2002).\nFollowing the writing task, all participants completed the Positive and Negative\nAffect Scales (PANAS; Watson, Clark, and Tellegen, 1988). This measure has been used in\nprevious terror management studies as a distracter task, occurring between the MS or\ncontrol manipulation and the measuring of the dependent variable. The PANAS consists of\ntwo 10- item scales that provide a brief measure of mood.\nLastly, participants completed the face judgment task. The program developed by Johnston\net al. (2001) was used (video was obtained from V.S. Johnson with permission for use in\nresearch). The program is a 1,200 frame QuickTimeTM movie that gradually morphs an\nextremely masculine face into an extremely feminine face at the rate of 30 frames per\nsecond. The faces used to develop the movie consisted of 16 random male and female\nCaucasian facial images. The male facial images were of men between 18 and 2t6 years of\nage and the female faces were of women between 18 and 30 years of age (for details of the\nprogram see Johnston et al., 2001). Participants were given an introduction on how to use\nthe Johnston et al. (2001) program and then asked to make the appropriate face choices for\neach of the categories. The order in which the judgments were made was counterbalanced\nacross participants. For each judgment, participants moved the mouse to view the sequence\nof faces that ranged from frame 0 \"extremely masculine\" to frame 1,200 \"extremely\nfeminine\" with frame 600 depicting an androgynous face. When participants indicated that\nthey had made a choice, the interviewer recorded the number of the frame corresponding to\nthe choice. Participants were assured that there were no right or wrong choices and during\nthis part of the procedure and the researcher was seated behind the participants in order to\navoid any possible bias on the part of the researcher.\nThe effects of mortality\nExperimental design\nA 2 x 2 between-participants design was used. The factors were fertility status (i.e.,\nhigh fertility phase vs. low fertility phase) and conditions (MS vs. control). The dependent\nvariable was the level of masculinization/feminization of the face judgments.\nResults\nThe frame selected for each of the eight judgments was recorded for each\nparticipant and averaged for each condition. Table 1 displays the mean frame selections for\neach judgment for each condition.\nTable 1. Mean Judgments (Standard Deviations) by Question Type from Experiment 1.\nCondition\nLow Fertility High Fertility\nAn analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out for mean frame selection for\neach type of judgment. In each ANOVA, fertility status and condition were the two\nbetween-subjects factors. Significant results were observed only for three of the eight\njudgments: attractive male face, dominant male face, and healthy male face. These results\nare displayed in Figures 1 \u00ad 3, respectively.\nFigure 1. Results of MS and type of participant for the \"attractive male face\" category.\nThe effects of mortality\nFigure 2.

The main effects of\novulation status and condition were not significant Fs < 1.\nThe effects of mortality\nDiscussion\nThe present results provide new evidence about how environmental factors, such as\nthe presence of death reminders, can influence human reproductive behaviors, such as mate\nselection. We found that the judgments that women made when selecting the attractive\nmale face were determined by an interaction of fertility status and condition. In control\nconditions, high fertile phase women preferred significantly more masculine faces than low\nfertile phase women. These results in control conditions replicated prior research (Fink and\nJohnston and Oliver-Rodriguez, 1997; Penton-Voak and Perrett, 2000; Penton-Voak et al.,\n1999; Scarbrough and Johnston, 2005). In MS conditions, high fertile phase women\npreferred significantly less masculine faces than low fertile phase women and also\nsignificantly less masculine faces than high fertile phase women in the control condition. A\nsimilar pattern was observed in women's judgments for the dominant male face and healthy\nmale face.\nThe present results are also consistent with TMT research. First, it has been shown\nthat people in a MS condition will adhere more strongly to socially acceptable norms and\nwill react negatively towards those persons who do not uphold these norms (Greenberg et\nselected by ovulating women in the MS condition could be considered a more average face\nthan faces chosen by high fertile phase women in the control condition and low fertile\nphase women in the MS condition. High fertile phase women in the MS condition may\nhave viewed the masculine face negatively because of the association of masculine faces\nwith socially negative characteristics and would view feminized faces more positively\nbecause feminized faces are shown to be associated with more pro-social attributes such as\nbeing helpful, cooperative, trustworthy, and a good father (Boothroyd, et al., 2007; Jones et\nal., 2008; Johnston, et al., 2001). Second, it has been shown that following MS, women\nand men may find the physical aspects of sex and sexual attraction unappealing, as the\nphysicality of sex may be a reminder of one's eventual mortality (Goldenberg et al. 1999;\nLandau et al. 2006). In the present research, it may have been the case that high fertile\nphase women experienced the highly masculine male faces as associated with physical\nsexuality and, therefore, death. Following MS, women who are at a high risk of pregnancy\nmay view mates with highly masculine faces as involving more risk than mates with more\nfeminized faces. It is possible that following MS, high fertile phase women's judgments of\nmale faces are affected both by perceived risk and the extent to which the face fits a\ncultural norm. In future research, it is necessary to investigate the extent to which highly\nmasculine faces increase death-related thoughts in high fertile phase and low fertile phase\nwomen.\nOur results suggest that mortality salience may result in an over-ride of the high\nfertility phase-induced preference for masculine faces and a strengthening of the\npredisposition for less masculine and likely higher investing mates. These results are\nconsistent with Life History Theory in that an adaptive compromise may be taking place\nwith the high fertile phase women. Our sample was composed primarily of White, middle-\nclass college women who have been shown to express a preference for mates who will\ninvest heavily in her and her children (Geary et al., 2004; Ellis et al., 1999; Low, Hazel,\nParker and Welch, 2008; Whissel, 1996). In the presence of a potential environmental\nThe effects of mortality\nthreat posed by the MS condition, the highly fertile women may be making an adaptive\ncompromise that favors investment over good genes. Our study shows that death reminders\ndo not have to be directly experienced to influence mate preference, at least temporarily.\nFurther research on populations experiencing harsh developmental environments with\nhigher mortality risks would help fortify this conclusion.\nOur results are also consistent with alternative explanations, and thus further\nresearch is necessary to distinguish between these alternatives. For example, it is possible\nthat the death reminder influences how women in a highly fertile phase of their menstrual\ncycles, but not in a low fertility phase, judge the healthiness of male faces. In the present\nresearch, we found that highly fertile phase women in the MS condition selected a less\nmasculine face than highly fertile women in the control condition. In comparison, low\nfertile phase women who experience a death reminder do not view more masculine faces as\nmore unhealthy. Prior research has shown that the perceived healthiness of mates plays an\nimportant role in reproductive behavior (See Etcoff, 1999; Fink and Penton-Voak, 2002;\nRhodes, 2006 for review). Women seek healthy mates because they can produce children\nwith genetic advantages, such as inherited resistance to disease. Healthy mates may also\ncontribute more in the form of resources or parental care (Andersson, 1994).\nIn future research, it will also be important to investigate whether women's\nrelationship status influences facial preferences. Prior research by Durante, Li, and\nHaselton (2008), has shown that the choices that high fertile phase women make can be\ninfluenced by whether or not they are in a committed relationship. They assessed the\nclothing worn by women when they were at high or low risk of pregnancy. They\nhypothesized that when women were at high risk of pregnancy they would wear clothing\nthat was more sexy and revealing of their bodies. They found evidence to support their\nhypothesis in both a naturalistic observation study as well as a laboratory study; however,\nthey found that relationship status mattered. Women who were not in committed\nrelationships wore more revealing outfits when they were not at high versus low risk of\npregnancy. In contrast, women who were in committed relationships wore revealing outfits\nboth when they were at high and low risk of pregnancy. The authors suggested that the\nfindings involving women in committed relationship may be explained \"from an\nintrasexual competition perspective....[that states that] if mated women are highly satisfied\nwith their partners, they may be inclined to increase their attractiveness in order to remain\ncompetitive with members of the opposite sex for their mates' attention, especially at a\ntime when mating decisions can result in potentially high consequences (at high fertility)\"\n(p. 1458). In our future research, we will investigate whether the effect of mortality\nsalience on ovulating women's face judgments for women who are and are not in a\ncommitted relationship.\nIn sum, the present results are intriguing because they show that death reminders\ncan be considered a situational source of influence can impact human reproductive\nbehavior. The present results demonstrated that death reminders influenced women's\npreferences for male faces. They add to the prior literature showing that death reminders\ninfluence men and women's desire for offspring. We anticipate that future research will\nalso show that death reminders may influence additional behaviors related to human\nreproduction.\nThe effects of mortality\nReferences\nAndersson, M. (1994).
