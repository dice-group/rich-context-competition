The\nrisk for violent reinjury among high-risk, assault-injured youth is poorly understood.\nOBJECTIVE To compare recidivism for violent injury and mortality outcomes among\ndrug-using, assault-injured youth (AI group) and drug-using, non\u00adassault-injured control\nparticipants (non-AI group) presenting to an urban ED for care.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Participants were enrolled in a prospective cohort study\nfor 24 months. We administered validated measures of violence and substance use and\nmental health diagnostic interviews and reviewed medical records at baseline and at each\nEXPOSURE Follow-up over 24 months.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Use of ED services for assault or mortality measured from\nmedical record abstraction supplemented with self-report.\nRESULTS We followed 349 AI and 250 non-AI youth for 24 months. Youth in the AI group had\nalmost twice the risk for a violent injury requiring ED care within 2 years compared with the\nmortality was 0.8%. Poisson regression modeling identified female sex (RR, 1.30 [95% CI,\n1.09-1.97]) at the index visit as predictive of ED recidivism or death within 24 months.\nParametric survival models demonstrated that assault-related injury (P < .001), diagnosis of\nposttraumatic stress disorder (P = .008), and diagnosis of a drug use disorder (P = .03)\nsignificantly shortened the expected waiting time until the first ED return visit for violence or\ndeath.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Violent injury is a reoccurring disease, with one-third of our AI\ngroup experiencing another violent injury requiring ED care within 2 years of the index visit,\nalmost twice the rate of a non-AI comparison group. Secondary violence prevention measures\naddressing substance use and mental health needs are needed to decrease subsequent\nmorbidity and mortality due to violence in the first 6 months after an assault injury.\nAuthor Affiliations: Author\naffiliations are listed at the end of this\narticle.\nCorresponding Author: Rebecca M.\nCunningham, MD, Department of\nEmergency Medicine, University of\nPlymouth Rd, North Campus\n.edu).\nResearch\nOriginal Investigation\n \nDownloaded From: http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

Homicide is the second leading cause of death\namong youth overall and has been the leading cause of\ndeathamongAfricanAmericanmaleadolescentsandyoungmen\nfor more than a decade.1 In addition, nonfatal assault-related\ninjuries are responsible for more than 700 000 emergency de-\npartment (ED) visits annually among youth (aged 10-24 years).1\nAnnual societal costs for fatal youth violence injuries are sub-\nstantial,estimatedatmorethan$4billionforacutemedicalcare\nand $32 billion for lost wages and productivity.2\nPublishedratesofviolentinjuryrecidivismvarywidelyfrom\nvism among a broader combined population of assault-injured\nandunintentionallyinjuredpatients4,7 orfocusedonasubpopu-\nlation of assault-injured youth, such as those with penetrating\ntrauma11 or those requiring hospital admission.4,6,9 As a result,\ndataarelimitedonthe84%ofviolentlyinjuredpatientswhoare\ntreatedanddischargeddirectlyfromtheED.12 Inaddition,much\nofthisbodyofresearchisnow10to20yearsold,limitingitsabil-\nitytoinformcurrentpractice.Theliteraturetodatehasalsobeen\nprimarily retrospective in nature, often using trauma registry\ndata, and has lacked a true comparison group or diagnostic cri-\nteria for substance use or mental health.3-5,9,13 Among the lim-\nitednumberofpriorprospectivestudies,2examinedrecidivism\namongacombinedassault-injuredandunintentionallyinjured\npopulation,7,10 1 focused only on admitted adult trauma\npatients,14 and1wasapilotstudyofassault-injured,ED-treated\nyouthwithalimited8-weekfollow-upperiod.8 Thesubstantial\nmethodological and population differences in existing studies\naccountforourincompleteunderstandingofthecurrentriskfor\nviolent injury recidivism among assault-injured youth treated\nin the ED and limit intervention development.\nFurthermore,althoughsubstanceusehasbeenoverwhelm-\ningly associated with a history of violence,15 none of the prior\nED-basedlongitudinalstudieshavefocusedonasampleofdrug-\nusing youth seeking care for assault-related injuries. Among\nassault-injured youth treated in the ED, almost 55% have a his-\ntory of recent substance use.12 The relationship between sub-\nstance use and youth violence is explained by theories of clus-\ntering of problem behaviors,16 pharmacological effects of drug\nuse,17 and the violent nature of the illicit drug trade.18\nThe purpose of this study was to examine 2-year outcomes\noffatalandnonfatalviolentinjuriesamongasampleofassault-\ninjured, drug-using youth (AI group) (14-24 years of age) seek-\ning ED care compared with non\u00adassault-injured, drug-using\nyouth (non-AI group) seeking ED care for other reasons. Based\non prior work and theory, we hypothesized that the AI group\nwouldhavehigherratesofrepeatedviolentinjuryrequiringED\ncare compared with the non-AI group and that the probability\nof reinjury would be associated with baseline characteristics of\nsubstance use, mental illness, and carrying weapons.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nThis prospective cohort study measured 2-year prevalence of\nviolent injury and mortality among a consecutively obtained\nED sample of assault-injured youth aged 14-24 years with a his-\ntory of drug use in the past 6 months (AI group) compared with\na group of non\u00adassault-injured, drug-using youth proportion-\nally sampled for age and sex (non-AI group). The study is part\nof the larger Flint Youth Injury Study.12 The study was ap-\nproved by the institutional review boards of the University of\nMichigan and Hurley Medical Center, and a Certificate of Con-\nfidentiality from the National Institutes of Health was ob-\ntained. Written assent or informed consent was obtained from\nparticipants or their parents if the participants were younger\nSetting\nThe study was conducted at an urban public ED in Flint, Michi-\ngan, which is the only level I trauma center for the region.

The\nstudysamplereflectsthelocalpopulation,whichis50%to60%\nAfrican American and is similar to those of prior studies con-\nducted among patients at this site.21\nPopulation\nPatients aged 14 to 24 years presenting to the ED for an assault-\nrelated injury and a non-AI group proportionally balanced by\nreported any drug use in the past 6 months (see the Measures\nsubsection) on a computerized screening survey12 were eli-\ngible for inclusion in the longitudinal study. Patients were ex-\ncluded if they presented for acute sexual assault, child mal-\ntreatment (ie, injury caused by an adult caregiver), suicidal\nideation/attempt, or conditions precluding ethical consent (eg,\naltered mental status, psychosis). Recruitment occurred 7 days\nper week, 21 h/d (5 AM to 2 AM) on Tuesday and Wednesday and\nmedically unstable were recruited on the inpatient unit if they\nstabilized within 72 hours.\nStudy Protocol\nAssault-injured youth identified through electronic medical\nrecords were approached by trained research assistants (RAs)\nin waiting rooms or treatment spaces. Assaults were defined\nas any injury intentionally caused by another person and were\nassessed by the RA at the time of ED presentation. After pro-\nviding assent or consent, patients self-administered a com-\nputerized screening survey12 to assess their eligibility for the\nlongitudinal study, specifically drug use in the past 6 months\n(see the Measures subsection). The non-AI group was en-\nrolled systematically in parallel to the AI group to limit tem-\nporal or seasonal variation and was proportionally balanced\nby age and sex. For example, after identifying a 16-year old fe-\nmale with an acute assault-related injury and drug use in the\npast 6 months on the screening survey, the RA would recruit\nsequentially, by triage time, the next female aged 14 to 17 years\nResearch Original Investigation Reinjury and Mortality Among Youth in the ED\n \nDownloaded From: http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc. User on 11/20/2015\n \nseeking ED care for a medical complaint or an unintentional\ninjury; those with screen findings that were positive for any\ndrug use in the past 6 months would be recruited for the lon-\ngitudinal study. All screening and baseline surveys were ad-\nministered privately; family or friends accompanying the pa-\ntient were not allowed to observe or participate during\nadministration.\nBaseline and Follow-up Assessments\nEligible youth subsequently completed a baseline assess-\nment approximately 90 minutes in duration in the ED, includ-\ning a self-administered survey and an RA-structured diagnos-\ntic interview for which they received $20 in remuneration.15\nIn-person follow-up assessments similar to the baseline sur-\nED or at a community location (eg, library, restaurant, or their\nhomes).Participantswerereimbursed$35forthe6-month,$40\nmonth follow-ups.\nMeasures\nDemographic data were collected using validated measures\n(Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Studies and National Lon-\ngitudinal Study of Adolescent Health).22,23 Use of substances,\nincluding alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs (cocaine,\ninhalants, street opioids, methamphetamine, and hallucino-\ngens) were assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identifi-\ncation Test24 and the National Institute on Drug Abuse\u00ad\nModified Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement\nScreening Test.25,26 Binge drinking was defined as 5 or more\ndrinks on a single occasion. The RA-administered Mini Inter-\nnational Neuropsychiatric Interview (version 6.0; January 1,\n2010) was used to assess drug use disorder (ie, abuse or\ndependence).27 For analysis, substance use variables were di-\nchotomized (yes or no).\nFirearm carriage was measured by asking participants how\noften in the past 6 months they carried a gun.28 Mental health\ndisorders reflecting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-\ntal Disorders (Fourth Edition) diagnostic criteria, including a\ncurrentmajordepressiveepisode(inthepast2weeks)andpost-\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (in the past month but ex-\ncluding the index assault), were assessed using the RA-\nadministered Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview\nandtheversionforchildrenandadolescents.27 Legalstatuswas\nmeasured using a yes/no item (ie, on probation/parole) from\nthe Addiction Severity Index.29\nED Baseline Visit and Recidivism\nDatafromreviewofthemedicalrecordsfortheindexvisitwere\nabstracted from the ED medical record for all participants, in-\ncluding visit type (assault-related and non\u00adassault related in-\njury or medical) and disposition (admission or discharge) using\na standardized abstraction form. The RAs categorized all as-\nsaults using standard E-code designations30 and calculated In-\njury Severity Scores from the medical record data. Medical rec-\nords were audited with an error rate of less than 5%.\nAssault-related reinjury for which the participant sought\nED care was examined as a composite measure that captured\nmedicalrecorddataonEDvisitsatthestudyhealthsystemdur-\ning the 24-month follow-up and self-report data from each of\nits that may occur out of the study ED). Recidivism was mea-\nsured by the question, \"How many of your ER [ED] visits in\nthe past 6 months were related to injuries from a fight, as-\nsault, or conflict with another person?\"31 A prior study21 found\nthat 90% of this sample uses the study site hospital system ex-\nclusively for routine medical care. Out-of-hospital mortality\nwas assessed through family members during attempted fol-\nlow-upcontact,localmedia,andregularreviewofnationaland\nlocal public health mortality records.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe used 2 and unpaired t tests to evaluate bivariate associa-\ntions with the outcome of interest (ie, 24-month use of ED ser-\nvices for assault-related reinjury). Kaplan-Meier (nonparamet-\nric) estimators of the survival function for the AI and non-AI\ngroups were plotted with confidence bands. We used Poisson\nregression to estimate risk ratios for use of ED services for as-\nsault within 24 months associated with baseline ED visit\ncharacteristics.32 Independent variables were chosen based on\nsignificance in the bivariate analysis (assault-related injury, di-\nagnosis of PTSD or drug use disorder) and theory (race/\nethnicity, use of public assistance). Parametric survival mod-\nels estimated the effect of assault-related injury, diagnosis of\nPTSD, and diagnosis of a drug use disorder on the time until\nthe first ED return for assault or death. This approach allowed\ninterval-censored return times to be incorporated.\nResults\nBaseline Sample Characteristics\nintheAIand250inthenon-AIgroups.Participantsweremostly\nlic assistance (73.0%).

Firearm assault was the injury mecha-\nnism for 3.2% of the cohort with a post\u00adindex ED visit (mean\nInjury Severity Score, 8.5) (13 youth in the AI group vs 6 youth\nin the non-AI group).

For\nexample, the model estimates that participants without a di-\nagnosis of PTSD or a drug use disorder in the non-AI group\nhave an approximately 20% chance of returning to the ED\nwithin 48 months, whereas participants in the AI group with-\nout these diagnoses have a 40% chance of return visits.

Although promising trends in reduction of exposure to\nviolence have been shown in other arenas, this study sug-\ngests that little progress has been made in the arena of recur-\nrent violent injury.3,9\nThe results have important implications for the further de-\nvelopment and implementation of secondary violence pre-\nvention programs.

Although such measures have been applied to\nchronic diseases, which have an overall ED recidivism rate of\n26% in a national network study,34 no comparable system of\nstandard medical care currently exists for youth presenting\nwith a violent injury. The monetary costs of these violent in-\njuries are high, with 1 review estimating that acute care for fire-\narm assault injuries alone cost the US health system $630 mil-\npublic insurance payers (eg, Medicaid) or uninsured or self-\npaying patients.35 Given that violence remains the leading\ncause of death for urban youth in this age group, surpassing\ncancer, asthma, and human immunodeficiency virus infec-\ntion, it may need to be managed with a comprehensive ap-\nproach that addresses the acute care wounds and the long-\ntermriskforreinjuryandneedforsubsequentED/hospitalcare.\nThese data also indicate that the initial 6 months after\ntheir ED evaluation for assault injury is the time of highest\nrisk for a subsequent violent second injury requiring medical\ncare. Prior research finds the immediate post-ED period to be\na high-risk time for retaliatory violence,8 which is also a key\ncause for youth fighting.36 The survival model demonstrates\nthat several modifiable and baseline conditions (PTSD, drug\nuse disorders) substantially affected outcomes of repeated\nviolence. Although the entire cohort had a history of drug\nuse (most commonly marijuana use and often occasional\nuse), a diagnosis of a drug use disorder at the index visit was\npredictive of future assault in the multivariate model. This\nfinding reinforces the significant risk for recurrent injury\namong drug-using youth and the need to include substance\nuse interventions within ongoing violence prevention pro-\ngrams. This study also confirms the importance of consider-\ning preexisting mental health needs while addressing vio-\nlence prevention. Posttraumatic stress disorder was a\nsignificant predictor of future assault in the multivariate\nmodel, independently of acute reasons for the ED visit. Prior\nresearch37 has suggested that PTSD symptoms may decrease\nnormal defensive cues and thus increase the risk for violent\nvictimization. Given that effective PTSD treatment exists,38\nincorporating this treatment as a component of violence pre-\nvention programs may be critical.\nRace and receipt of public assistance were not predic-\ntive of future use of ED services for assault. The high levels\nof public assistance observed among the sample likely\nFigure 2.

Furthermore, female participants consti-\ntuted almost half of those who returned for an assault-\nrelated visit within 2 years. This finding, combined with\nrecent data highlighting the increasing rates of violence\namong young women,39 emphasizes the need to develop\nviolence interventions relevant to both sexes.\nWe note several limitations of this study. This study was\nconducted at a single urban ED, potentially limiting general-\nizability. In addition, although our sample reflected the racial\ncomposition of the city where it was located, future studies\nare needed among youth samples composed of a broader range\nof races and ethnicities. Although a potential limitation, the\nuse of self-reported survey data has been shown previously\nto have high reliability and validity among youth for self-\nreported risk behaviors, including drug and alcohol use.40 Al-\nthough the AI and non-AI groups15 did not have significant dif-\nferences in use of medical services (primary care physician\nvisits in the past 6 months, routine physician examinations,\nand ED visits in the past year for any reason) and typically pre-\nsented for minor self-limited injury or medical complaints\n(Figure 1), participants in both groups may have had or devel-\noped medical illnesses that would alter their probability of\nbeing exposed to violence, which may have affected re-\npeated ED visits for assault. Also, this study examined a co-\nhort of drug-using youth, which limits our ability to general-\nize our findings to the 46% of assault-injured youth who do\nnot report drug use in the past 6 months.12 Finally, we at-\ntempted to capture all potential ED visits for assault-related\ninjury during the follow-up period by combining objective re-\nview of medical records with self-reported data (strength-\nened by an 85% follow-up rate); however, use of ED services\nmay be underreported.\nConclusions\nThiscohortstudyofassault-injuredyouthfindsthatmorethan\none-third of high-risk, assault-injured youth experience a re-\npeated violent injury requiring ED care, with 0.8% mortality,\nduring a 2-year period. Future violence interventions for youth\nsustaining assault-related injury may be most effective in the\nfirst 6 months after injury, which is the period with the high-\nest risk for recidivism. These interventions may be most help-\nful if they address substance use and PTSD to decrease future\nmorbidity and mortality.\nAuthor Affiliations: University of Michigan Injury\nCenter, University of Michigan School of Medicine,\nAnn Arbor (Cunningham, Carter, Zimmerman, Blow,\nGoldstick, Walton); Department of Emergency\nMedicine, University of Michigan School of\nMedicine, Ann Arbor (Cunningham, Carter);\nDepartment of Health Behavior and Health\nEducation, University of Michigan School of Public\nHealth, Ann Arbor (Cunningham, Zimmerman);\nDepartment of Emergency Medicine, Hurley\nMedical Center, Flint, Michigan (Cunningham);\nMichigan Youth Violence Prevention Center,\nUniversity of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann\nArbor (Cunningham, Carter, Zimmerman, Goldstick,\nWalton); Addiction Research Center, Department of\nPsychiatry, University of Michigan School of\nMedicine, Ann Arbor (Carter, Blow, Walton); Injury\nPrevention Center, Department of Emergency\nMedicine, Alpert School of Medicine, Brown\nUniversity, Providence, Rhode Island (Ranney);\nNational Serious Mental Illness Treatment,\nResource and Evaluation Center, Department of\nVeterans Affairs, Ann Arbor, Michigan (Blow);\nDepartment of Psychiatry, College of Medicine,\nUniversity of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little\nRock (Booth).\nAuthor Contributions: Drs Cunningham and\nWalton had full access to all the data in the study\nand take responsibility for the integrity of the data\nand the accuracy of the data analysis.\nStudy concept and design: Cunningham,\nZimmerman, Blow, Walton.\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:\nCunningham, Carter, Ranney, Zimmerman, Booth,\nGoldstick, Walton.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Cunningham, Carter,\nRanney, Zimmerman, Booth, Walton.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important\nintellectual content: All authors.\nStatistical analysis: Carter, Booth, Goldstick.\nObtained funding: Cunningham, Zimmerman, Blow,\nWalton.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support:\nRanney, Blow.\nStudy supervision: Cunningham, Walton.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nFunding/Support: This study was supported by\nDrug Abuse (principal investigator, Dr Cunningham)\nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism\nDisease Control and Prevention.\nRole of the Funder/Sponsor: The funding sources\nhad no role in the design and conduct of the study;\ncollection, management, analysis, and\ninterpretation of the data; preparation, review, or\napproval of the manuscript; and decision to submit\nthe manuscript for publication.\nPrevious Presentation: This paper was presented\nas an abstract at the Pediatric Academic Society\nMeeting; May 5, 2014; Vancouver, British Columbia,\nCanada.\nAdditional Contributions: Wendi Mohl, BS, and\nJessica Roche, MPH, Department of Emergency\nMedicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor,\nassisted in manuscript preparation.
