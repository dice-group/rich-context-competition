    "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Objective. Dental care is a major unmet\nhealth need of refugee children. Many refugee children\nhave never received oral health care or been exposed to\ncommon preventive oral health measures, such as a\ntoothbrush, fluoridated toothpaste, or fluoridated water.\nOral health problems among refugee children are most\nlikely to be detected first by pediatricians and family\npractitioners. Given the increased influx of refugees into\nthe United States, particularly children, it is important\nfor the pediatric community to be aware of potential oral\nhealth problems among refugee children and be able to\nmake referrals for treatment and recommendations for\nthe prevention of future oral diseases. The purpose of\nthis study was to describe the prevalence of caries expe-\nrience and untreated decay among newly arrived refugee\nchildren stratified by their region of origin and compared\nwith US children.\nMethods. Oral health assessments were conducted\nwithin 1 month of arrival to the United States as part of\nthe Refugee Health Assessment Program of the Massa-\nchusetts Department of Public Health. The outcome vari-\nables include caries experience and untreated decay. Car-\nies experience is determined by the presence of an\nuntreated caries lesion, a restoration, or a permanent\nmolar tooth that is missing because it has been extracted\nas a result of dental caries. Untreated caries is detected\nwhen 0.5 mm of tooth structure is lost and there is brown\ncoloration of the walls of the cavity. Comparisons of the\nrefugee children with US children in Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey data were\nmade using 2 test of independence and multiple logistic\nregression.\nResults. Oral health screenings were performed on\n224 newly arrived refugees who ranged in age from 6\nmonths to 18 years and had a mean age of 10.6 years (SD:\n53.6%, with the majority from Somalia, Liberia, and Su-\ndan. Eastern European refugees composed 26.8% of the\nstudy sample. The remaining 19.6% come from a number\nof countries, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Mid-\ndle East. Refugee children had 51.3% caries experience\nand 48.7% with untreated decay. Caries experience in\nrefugees varied by region of origin, with 38% from Africa\nexhibiting a history of caries compared with 79.7% of\nEastern Europeans. The highest proportion of children\nwith no obvious dental problems was from Africa\nchildren had caries experience similar to that of refugees\n(49.3%) but significantly lower risk of untreated decay\n(22.8%). Comparisons between refugee children and US\nchildren found significant differences for treatment ur-\ngency, untreated caries, extent of dental caries, and pres-\nence of oral pain. White refugee children, primarily from\nEastern Europe, were 2.8 times as likely to have caries\nexperience compared with white US children, with 9.4\ntimes the risk of untreated decay compared with white\nUS children. In contrast, African refugee children were\nonly half as likely to have caries experience compared\nand African American children (95% confidence interval:\n0.3-0.7). However, African refugee children were similar\nto African American children in risk of untreated decay\nConclusion. African refugee children had signifi-\ncantly lower dental caries experience as well as fewer\nuntreated caries as compared with similarly aged Eastern\nEuropean refugee children. They were also less likely to\nhave ever been to a dentist. Possible reasons for these\nfindings may include differences in exposure to natural\nfluoride in the drinking water, dietary differences, access\nto professional care, and cultural beliefs and practices.\nThe prevalence of caries experience and untreated caries\ndiffered significantly between refugee children and US\nchildren. These differences varied significantly by race.\nWhen refugee children were compared with US children,\nthe African refugee children had only half the caries\nexperience of either white or African American children.\nHowever, African refugee children had similar likeli-\nhood of having untreated caries as compared with Afri-\ncan American children, despite that very few African\nchildren had previous access to professional dental care.\nThese findings are consistent with previous studies on\nhealth disparities in the United States. White refugee\nchildren, primarily from Eastern Europe, were also 3\ntimes as likely to have caries experience compared with\neither white or African American children and were 9.4\ntimes as likely to have untreated caries as white US\nchildren. Refugee children are more likely to establish\nprimary medical care before seeking dental treatment.\nWith the limited access to dental care among refugees,\npediatricians should be particularly alert to the risk of\noral diseases among refugee children.

In fact, in a national survey\nof pediatricians, 90% responded that they had an\nimportant role in identifying dental problems and\ncounseling families on the prevention of dental car-\nies.3 Because refugee children may be more likely to\nestablish primary medical care before seeking dental\ncare, it is important for pediatricians and family phy-\nsicians to be aware of the oral health needs of refugee\nchildren.\nIn 2002, the United Nations estimated that there\nwere 12 million refugees worldwide.4 They have\nbeen defined as people who are outside their native\ncountry and cannot return because of a well-founded\nfear of persecution because of race, religion, nation-\nality, political opinion, or membership in a particular\nsocial group.4 Refugees present with a wide range of\nunique health care needs, reflecting conditions in\ntheir native countries, time in migration, and expe-\nriences in refugee camps. Refugees' countries of or-\nigin reflect current world political conditions. Al-\nthough during the past 3 decades refugees who\nentered the United States were primarily from the\nformer Soviet Union and Southeast Asia, more re-\ncently there have been increasing numbers from\nEastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Central\nMany refugees originate from areas where disease\ncontrol, diagnosis, and treatment are lacking and\nwar or civil unrest has disrupted the function of\nhealth care systems. For example, refugee children\nfrequently experience malnutrition, anemia, and\npoor growth6 and are also at an increased risk for\ncertain conditions, such as hepatitis, intestinal para-\nsitoses, latent tuberculosis infection, and dental prob-\nlems.7\u00ad10 Vastly different health care beliefs, as well\nas cultural and linguistic barriers, contribute to their\ndifficulties in gaining access to health care services in\nthe United States.\nSeveral studies have noted a high prevalence of\ndental disease and unmet dental care needs in refu-\ngees. Chilean and Polish refugees in Sweden have\nbeen shown to have poorer oral health status com-\npared with corresponding Swedish population\ngroups.11 Similarly, refugee children in Holland\nwere found to have inferior oral health status com-\npared with Dutch children, with 85% of refugee chil-\nWorld Health Organization documented high levels\nof dental caries in the former Yugoslavia when com-\npared with other Europeans.13 Because of war and\ndeteriorating socioeconomic conditions, the previ-\nously poor state of oral health in the former Yugo-\nof adult refugees and immigrants in Italy also found\na greater burden of dental problems, with higher\ncaries prevalence, poorer oral hygiene, and greater\nunmet dental needs being particularly high among\nYugoslav refugees.15\nIn the United States, an assessment conducted in\nSan Francisco in the late 1980s of recently arrived\nrefugee and immigrant school children from Asia,\nCentral America, and the Philippines found that 77%\nof the refugee and immigrant children needed dental\ntreatment, as compared with 25% of comparably\naged US children. In addition, refugee children, as\ncompared with immigrant children, had more caries\nin their permanent teeth but fewer caries in their\nprimary teeth and fewer serious dental conditions.16\nIn contrast, a study in Israel of refugees from rural\nareas of Ethiopia noted relatively low rates of dental\ncaries in refugee children, with only 13.2% of 5- to\ntal caries.17 It is interesting that none of these Ethio-\npian children had ever been to the dentist before\nemigration to Israel. All foods consumed by these\nEthiopian refugees in their native culture were\nhomemade without the use of refined sugar, which is\ntypical of many parts of Africa. Throughout East\nAfrica, dental caries prevalence is low compared\nwith developed countries, with a lower prevalence in\nrural versus urban areas.18 In addition, differences\nhave been noted in caries prevalence between high\nand low socioeconomic groups, with the prevalence\nand severity of dental caries generally higher among\nprivileged Africans who reside in urban centers,\nwhere sugar consumption is limited to those of a\nhigher socioeconomic status and considered a lux-\nury. In contrast to the indigenous African rural diet\nthat is low in refined sugar, refugees are often ex-\nposed to dietary changes that may include increased\nquantities of refined sugar. Such dietary changes\nmay be compounded by disrupted family eating pat-\nterns within refugee camps, with these new dis-\nrupted patterns persisting as refugees resettle in a\nAll newly arrived refugees in the United States are\nentitled to a comprehensive health assessment on\narrival through the Federal Refugee Act of 1980\nscreening of newly arriving refugees was consoli-\ndated in 1995 as the Refugee Health Assessment\nProgram under the auspices of the Massachusetts\nDepartment of Public Health. The program is con-\ntracted to a limited network of clinical sites around\nthe state. An earlier report by the program's medical\nproviders noted that 63% of newly arrived refugee\nchildren in Massachusetts had significant oral health\nproblems, which were the most prevalent health\nproblems among these children.6 As a result, oral\nhealth assessments by a dental hygienist were incor-\nporated into the Refugee Health Assessment Pro-\ngram with the establishment of the Program for Ref-\nugee Oral Health (PROH).

Comparable oral health data from children\nwho live in the United States was obtained from the\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III). The results of these analyses\nprovide new information on the oral health status of\ndiverse refugee populations.\nMETHODS\nRefugee Data\nOral health assessments of newly arriving refugees were con-\nducted as part of the Refugee Health Assessment Program starting\nin January 2001. This article reports findings from screenings\ncompleted by September 2002. The screenings of refugee children\nwere performed within 90 days of arrival in the United States. A\ndental hygienist visually screened each refugee child by using a\npenlight and a disposable mirror. An intra-oral examination was\nperformed on each child to detect the presence of any oral pathol-\nogy. A parent and/or a child was interviewed about the last\ndental visit of the child and whether the child currently had oral\npain. These interviews were conducted through hospital interpret-\ners, when needed. Data were collected from a retrospective chart\nreview of the medical records. Oral health findings and demo-\ngraphic information for each refugee child in the study were\nrecorded. Demographic information included age, gender, race/\nethnicity, and country of origin. The Institutional Review Board of\nthe Boston University Medical Center approved and monitored\nthe study.\nThe Basic Screening Survey of the Association of State and\nTerritorial Dental Directors was the survey instrument used for\ninformation on caries experience, untreated caries, treatment ur-\ngency, and early childhood caries.19 Caries experience is deter-\nmined by the presence of an untreated caries lesion, a restoration\n(which presumably was once a caries lesion), or a permanent\nmolar that is missing because it was extracted as a result of dental\ncaries. Untreated caries is detected when the screener can readily\nobserve the following criteria: (1) a loss of at least 0.5 mm of tooth\nstructure at the enamel surface and (2) brown to dark-brown\ncoloration of the walls of the cavity. Early childhood caries is\ndefined as any child 3 years old with any 1 of his or her upper\n6 primary anterior teeth decayed, filled, or missing as a result of\ncaries. Treatment urgency code is an estimate of how soon the\nchild should visit the dentist for clinical diagnosis and necessary\ndental treatment. Treatment urgency is classified into the follow-\ning categories: (1) \"urgent/emergency care\" is defined as needing\ntreatment within 24 hours for signs and symptoms including pain,\ninfection, and swelling or soft-tissue ulceration of 2 weeks' du-\nration; (2) \"early care\" is defined as needing dental treatment that\nshould be administered within several weeks for problems such as\ncaries without signs or symptoms, spontaneous bleeding of the\ngums, or suspicious white or red soft-tissue lesions; and (3) \"no\nobvious problem\" indicates that the child can forgo dental exam-\nination and treatment until his or her next regular checkup.19\nIn addition to treatment urgency, the extent of dental caries was\nassessed and classified as follows: (1) no obvious caries; (2) 1 to 4\ncarious surfaces; (3) 5 to 9 carious surfaces; and (4) 10 carious\nsurfaces. This caries assessment was adapted from an index used\nby the US Department of Labor's Job Corp.20\nChildren with dental examinations from the NHANES III da-\ntabase were compared with the refugee children. A total of 11296\nchildren between the ages of 2 years of age and 16.9 years of age\nwere included in this comparison group. Information gathered\nfrom dental examinations was used to construct the following\nparameters for comparison with the refugee database: (1) treat-\nment urgency, (2) caries experience, (3) untreated caries, (4) dental\ncaries, (5) presence of dental pain, and (6) presence of oral pathol-\nogy. Some parameters (treatment urgency, caries experience, un-\ntreated caries, and dental caries) were created from the dental\ninformation available from the NHANES III database. The\nNHANES III database involves complex, multistage sampling in\nwhich racial minorities were oversampled to obtain detailed in-\nformation on these groups. To compensate for the complex nature\nof sampling, we used weighting in all comparisons involving\nNHANES III so that population-based estimates could be ob-\ntained.\nNHANES III dental screenings were visual/tactile screenings,\nwhereas the refugee screenings was a visual-only screening. On\nthe basis of previous studies, these 2 methods are comparable in\nStatistical Analysis\nThe refugee children were categorized into 1 of 3 regions of\norigin: Africa, Eastern Europe, and other. Initial comparisons of\ndemographic information (age group, race, and gender) and oral\nhealth parameters for these 3 refugee groups were made using 2\ntests of independence. Initial comparisons of oral health parame-\nters between the refugee children and US children as represented\nby NHANES III were conducted using a weighted 2 analysis to\nadjust for the complex sampling of NHANES III.\nMultiple logistic regression models were constructed to test the\ndifference in the prevalence of untreated caries and the prevalence\nof caries experience between refugee children and US children\n(NHANES III) while adjusting for confounding by age, gender,\nand race and effect modification by race. Weighting again was\nused to compensate for the complex sampling of NHANES III.\nBecause only 8 refugee children had the racial classification of\n\"other\" and had a similar distribution of untreated caries and\ncaries experience to white refugee children, they were grouped\nwith white refugee children when fitting the multiple logistic\nregression models.\nRESULTS\nThe refugee study sample consisted of 224 refugee\nchildren between the ages of 6 months and 18 years\nEastern European refugee children composed 26.8%\n(60 of 224) of the study sample and were primarily\nrefugee children came from a number of countries, in\n19 of 44).

No significant differences\namong the 3 refugee groups were detected for oral\npain, presence of early childhood caries, or oral pa-\nthology.\nIn comparisons between refugee children and US\nchildren, significant differences were found between\nthe refugee children and the US children (NHANES\nIII) for treatment urgency (P  .001), untreated caries\npresence of oral pain (P  .001).

They also were less likely\never to have been to a dentist. Possible reasons for\nthese findings include differences in exposure to nat-\nural fluoride in drinking water, dietary differences,\naccess to professional care, and cultural beliefs and\npractices.\nWhen refugee children were compared with US\nchildren, while taking race into account, the African\nrefugee children had only half the caries experience\nof either white or African American children. African\nrefugee children had similar likelihood of having\nuntreated dental caries as compared with African\nAmerican children, despite that very few African\nrefugee children had previous access to professional\ndental care. Our results are in agreement with the\nlow rates of dental caries observed in Ethiopian ref-\nugee children in Israel without previous access to a\ndentist,17 as well as with the generally lower caries\nprevalence in many parts of Africa.18\nIn contrast, children from Eastern Europe were\nalmost 3 times as likely to have caries experience\ncompared with US children and were 9.4 times as\nlikely to have untreated caries as white US children.\nIn addition, Eastern European children were 5.6\ntimes more likely to have caries experience and 4.7\ntimes more likely to have untreated caries compared\nwith African refugee children, despite generally\ngreater access to dentists than was found among\nAfrican refugees. This high rate of dental caries\namong Eastern European refugee children confirms\nprevious studies that noted high caries prevalence\namong refugees from the former Yugoslavia in Ita-\nly15 and a poorer state of oral health13 that subse-\nquently worsened as a result of war.14\nDiffering levels of fluoride in the drinking water\nsupply may contribute to the differences in the caries\nexperience between African and Eastern European\nrefugee children. It has been well documented that\nfluoride at an optimal range of 0.7 to 1.2 ppm reduces\ndental caries; however, it does not eliminate risk of\nwater sampling for fluoride content in parts of the\nformer Yugoslavia. Unpublished data from Project\nHope indicated that in a number of districts of Sara-\njevo and adjacent areas, fluoride levels were below\n0.3 ppm (I. L. Dogon, LDS, RCS, DMD, written com-\nAfrican countries have naturally occurring optimal\nlevels of fluoride in drinking water with some areas\nactually having very high fluoride levels.24,25\nHowever, a more likely explanation for the differ-\nences in caries prevalence is the variations in diet. In\nparticular, refined sugars are the most important\ndietary factor in the development of dental caries.26\nThe relationship between dental caries and refined\nsugar consumption has been well documented, in\nboth developed and developing countries. In the lat-\nter, as socioeconomic levels rise, so does the amount\nof sugar in the diet, typically with corresponding\nincreases in dental caries.27 Annual per capita sugar\nconsumption exceeding 15 kg has been associated\nwith increased prevalence of dental caries.27 The Af-\nrican countries from which the refugee children in\nthis study originated have annual per capita sugar\nconsumptions ranging from 3.1 kg in Liberia to 14.6\nin Sudan and 17.8 in Somalia. In contrast, Bosnia, the\nprimary origin of Eastern European refugee children\nin this study, had an annual per capita sugar con-\nsumption of 24.9 kg.27 In the United States, per capita\nsugar consumption is among the highest at 32.6 kg.\nDetailed nutritional data on the refugees were not\nobtained in this study; therefore, we are not able to\naddress directly the role of diet in explaining the\nvariation in caries prevalence. Nevertheless, our\nfindings clearly justify the need to collect such nutri-\ntional data prospectively to better understand caries\nrisk factors in refugee children and their families.\nCulture plays an important role in determining\noral health status, primarily through the effects on\noral hygiene practices, dietary patterns, and access\nand utilization of professional dental care services. In\nparticular, refugees face important cultural as well as\nTABLE 5.

For example, traditional oral hygiene practices\nvary widely in different parts of the world. Chewing\nsticks are a common practice in many parts of Africa,\nthe Middle East, and Asia. When properly used,\nchewing sticks are effective in removing plaque.29 A\nrecent report suggested that \"miswak\" chewing\nsticks may have an inhibitory effect on the levels of\noral streptococci and, thus, lower the risk of dental\ncaries.30 Such a finding could be particularly note-\nworthy, as many refugees prefer using chewing\nsticks as part of their daily oral hygiene regimen\nrather than adopting the use of a toothbrush.\nPrimary care physicians can play a crucial role in\neducating newly arrived refugees about personal\noral hygiene practices, the role of fluoride, and use of\npreventive oral health services. In addition, these\nphysicians can often facilitate referrals to dental ser-\nvices for the initiation of care. Although some refu-\ngee groups may actually have lower rates of caries\nthan the US population, they will often have other\nneeds and issues. For example, many Sudanese ref-\nugees have had ritual extraction of incisors and ca-\nnines and as a consequence of the resulting tongue\nthrusting have significant problems with speech ar-\nticulation, malocclusion, and simple biting and\nchewing. Also, the process of acculturation may lead\nto adoption of deleterious habits such as a diet with\na high content of refined sugar. In contrast, refugees\nsuch as those from Eastern Europe may have urgent\noral pathology, including severe caries, that require\nearly and ongoing dental intervention coupled with\neducation about hygiene and personal practices.\nHealth education and community outreach efforts\nare important elements of successful refugee reset-\ntlement programs. The infusion of targeted informa-\ntion on appropriate oral health practices and the\nfacilitation of access to dental care services can ben-\nefit existing programs. One key component could\nfocus on counseling refugees about nutrition, chang-\ning dietary patterns, and the increased susceptibility\nto dental caries as the result of increased sugar con-\nsumption. The introduction of new oral hygiene\npractices for preventing dental caries and periodon-\ntal disease could be coordinated into other health\neducation efforts aimed at enhancing various pre-\nventive self-care health behaviors. Last, information\nabout the value of regular professional dental care\nservices in children could be integrated into related\nhealth promotion efforts, such as vaccination pro-\ngrams and well-child care visits.\nThe PROH, in collaboration with the Massachu-\nsetts Department of Public Health's Refugee and Im-\nmigrant Health Program, has provided a critical link\nbetween oral health care and the refugee community.\nIn particular, through community outreach educa-\ntors, oral health has been incorporated into home\nvisits and other community outreach activities\nthroughout Massachusetts. Oral health assessments\nof newly arrived refugee are an essential component\nof all refugees' health assessments. PROH has effec-\ntively integrated oral health into existing medical\ncare settings to enhance an interdisciplinary ap-\nproach to providing client services and patient care.\nIn particular, the oral examination method that we\nhave used (Basic Screening Survey) is based on a\nsimple, visual intra-oral assessment that can be im-\nplemented by nondental professionals (eg, nurses\nand physicians).\nOne important limitation of this study is that it\nassessed the oral health status of refugee children at\nonly 1 point in time, shortly after their arrival in the\nUnited States. As discussed earlier, it is plausible that\nthe refugees' dietary patterns and increased expo-\nsure to refined sugars in the United States may result\nin increased caries risk. Ideally, these children should\nbe monitored prospectively to assess changing nutri-\ntional patterns and health behaviors that may have\nan impact on caries incidence. Studies using data\nfrom the National Vital Statistics System and Na-\ntional Health Interview Survey revealed an increased\nrisk of disability and chronic disease morbidity with\nan increasing length of residence in the United\nStates.31 By additional investigation of these refugees\nprospectively, we should be able to develop a more\ncomprehensive understanding of their dental caries\nrisk factors so that culturally appropriate prevention\nstrategies can be established.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported in part by the Northeast Center for\nResearch to Evaluate and Eliminate Dental Disparities, grant U54\nDE14264 from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial\nResearch and National Center on Minority Health and Health\nDisparities; the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Re-\nFoundation, a Delta Dental Plan of Massachusetts initiative.\nWe acknowledge Dr Elizabeth Barnett and the medical staff at\nthe Boston Medical Center International Clinic and the Massachu-\nsetts Department of Public Health Refugee and Immigrant Health\nProgram for support, enthusiasm, and participation with the Pro-\ngram for Refugee Oral Health.\nREFERENCES\n1.
