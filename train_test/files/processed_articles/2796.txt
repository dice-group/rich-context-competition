The Role of Scope and\nIntensity of Organizational Involvement\n Keywords: political participation, civic associations\n1 Introduction\nPolitical participation is vital to democracy (Tocqueville 2002; Fung 2003; Verba\nand Nie 1972; Verba, Schlozman, Brady 1995). Why people participate in political\nlife has thus been an important research question for generations of scholars.\nlars have examined the causes of political participation. Downs (1957) adopts an\neconomic perspective, arguing that it is irrational to vote if the probability that a\nsingle vote will make a difference to the outcome of the election is minuscule.\nBuilding upon Downs' argument, Olson (1965) proposes that rational individuals\n*Corresponding author: Hui Li, School of Public Administration, University of Central Florida,\nOrlando, FL, USA, E-mail: Hui.Li@ucf.edu\nJiasheng Zhang, Askew School of Public Administration and Policy, Florida State University,\n\u00a9 2017 Li and Zhang, published by De Gruyter.

These ideas help establish a general framework for\nthe rational choice theory.\nFollowing the rational choice theory, scholars have tried to empirically\nexamine the effects of various factors on political participation. They first\nfocus on the personal-level indicators, such as income, education, psychological\ninvolvement, political efficacy, or party identification. The standard socioeco-\nnomic model, or the resource model, developed by Verba and colleagues (e. g.,\nIt proposes that participation is primarily driven by individuals' resources\n(i. e., time, money). High-status individuals are more likely to participate in\npolitics than low-status individuals (Milbrath 1965; Verba, Schlozman, and\nBrady 1995). A second group of scholars focuses on the mobilization effect. It\nasserts that participation is a response to contextual cues structured by the\nindividual's environment. Individuals participate in politics because they are\nasked (through either institutional or informal channels) to do so (Kitts 2000;\nLim 2008). These two mechanisms are succinctly summarized in Brady, Verba,\nand Schlozman (1995), in which they state that \"they can't, they don't want to,\"\nor \"nobody asked\" can best explain the puzzle for political participation.\nAnother stream of research emphasizes the importance of \"organizational\nlife.\" Scholars assert that civic associations are the training ground where citizens\nlearn meaningful democratic skills and foster civic virtues and collective efficacy\nscholars have empirically tested the effects of civic associations on political\nparticipation. Some focus on association memberships, arguing that the more\none is affiliated with civic associations, the more one is involved in political\nscholars \"get into the organization\" and focus on the activities one performs in\ncivic associations. They propose that the extent to which one is active in associa-\ntional activities is more important than memberships in political participation\nfinds that protest participation is positively associated with one's commitment of\ntime and money to civic organizations. Therefore, both membership and degree of\ninvolvement seem important, but which one matters more is inconclusive.\nTo summarize, one's organizational life, along with one's socioeconomic\ncharacteristics and network mobilization, are critical to political participation.\nThey have been studied by scholars from different disciplines. In addition, most\nresearch treats political action as a single-dimension variable measured by\n4 H. Li and J. Zhang\nvoting behavior or the number of political activities in which individuals engage.\nHowever, political participation is not simply equated with voter turnout, nor is\nit the simple aggregation of different activities. Rather, it is a multidimensional\nconcept that includes different forms of political action, such as formal or\ninformal participation (Newman and Bartels 2010).\nThis study contributes to the literature by distinguishing various modes of\npolitical participation and by specifying the mechanisms under which civic\nassociations influence political participation. Specifically, we categorize political\nparticipation into three modes: voting, formal, and informal participation. We\npropose that these modes vary in their degree of institutionalization, the number\nof people involved, the difficulty of acts, and the degree of policy influence. In\naddition, we identify two aspects of associational life \u00ad the scope and the\nintensity \u00ad and find that they relate to the various modes of political participa-\ntion differently. The study proceeds this way. First, we review various streams of\nliterature and explain how civic associations are related to different modes of\npolitical participation. Second, we use the data from the U.S. Citizenship,\nInvolvement, and Democracy Survey in 2006 to test a set of hypotheses.\nFollowing that, findings are presented. We conclude the paper by summarizing\nthe main findings and the implications of the research.\n2 Theory and Hypotheses\nPolitical participation is defined as \"those actions of private citizens by which\nthey seek to influence or to support government and politics\" (Milbrath 1981,\n198). Civic associations are organized and governed by private individuals in\ntheir capacities as citizens who are concerned with public matters (Andrews\nefforts for management and operation. They often have a decentralized decision\nmaking process during which members' collective voices can be heard. The\nrelationship between civic associations and political participation has long\nbeen studied. In this paper, we first distinguish three types of political participa-\ntion: voting, formal, and informal participation. How civic associations are\nrelated to them is then presented.\n2.1 Three Modes of Political Participation\nPolitical participation not only includes voting but also encompasses various\nforms of other political activities, such as volunteering for a political candidate\nHow do Civic Associations Foster Political Participation? 5\nor campaign, contacting government officials, attending meetings of local gov-\nernment boards or councils, signing petitions, or engaging in protests or demon-\nstrations. These activities can be categorized into three types: voting, formal, and\ninformal participation. They differ in a variety of ways (See Table 1; Newman and\nof institutionalization. Some political acts, such as voting, are highly institutio-\nnalized; they operate within the well-established formal or legal channels. In\ncontrast, some political activities, such as informal, are loosely structured out-\nside the formal institutional channels (McAdam 2010). Second, some participa-\ntion forms are individualized, whereas others are group-based (Klandermans\ndualized political act, whereas formal and informal forms of participation may\nbe shaped by group interactions and social networks. Third, the three forms of\nparticipation vary in terms of the \"difficulty of the act\" (Verba and Nie 1972),\nwith some requiring less time and effort to carry out and others more. For\nexample, voting requires less initiative, whereas formal or informal forms of\npolitical acts, such as protesting or contacting officials, require more time,\nmoney, and skills (Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995). In addition, the three\nmodes provide varying degree of information about citizens' preferences, inter-\nests, and needs, and they differ in their influence on public policy (Verba,\nambiguous information about voters' preferences and provides an infrequent\nand blunt instrument for political influence (Dalton 2008; Verba et al. 1993). In\nother words, voting only occurs every several years, and waiting that long to\nvote down the administration that one is dissatisfied with seems like political\ninaction. Instead, some political acts, such as contacting government officials or\nsigning a petition, seem to be more direct means of expressing political concerns\nGiven the distinctions in the modes of political participation, it is likely that\nfactors associated with them vary. While existing research on political participa-\ntion has mostly focused on individuals' socioeconomic status and network\nTable 1: The differences among various modes of political participation.\nParticipation forms Degree of\ninstitutionalization\nIndividualized vs.\ngroup-based\nDifficulty\nof actions\nPolicy\ninfluence\nVoting High Individualized Low Low\nFormal participation Moderate Mixed High Medium\nInformal participation Low Mixed High High\n6 H. Li and J. Zhang\nrelations, this study highlights the role of \"organizational life\" in political\nparticipation. Below, we examine how civic associations influence political\nparticipation. Specifically, we distinguish two aspects of civic participation,\nscope and intensity, and relate them to different modes of political participation.\n2.2 Civic Associations and Political Participation\nCivic associations have long been considered critical to political participation.\nMore than a century ago, Tocqueville (2002) argued that civic associations do\nnot only empower individuals but also serve as a learning school for democracy.\nAlmond and Verba (1963) stressed on the importance of civic associations in\nfostering a democratic political culture and in providing their members with an\nincreased sense of political efficacy. Civic associations may also function as\nagents of mobilization through disseminating political information and encoura-\nIn examining the role of civic associations, most studies use the \"member-\nship approach,\" which uses either binary variables to indicate whether one\nbelongs to certain associations, or a simple count of the number of organiza-\ntional memberships one has (Somma 2010). While this measure focuses on the\nscope of organizational involvement, it neglects the intensity of the involvement,\nwhich is essential in fostering political participation (Wolleb\u00e6k and Str\u00f8msnes\n2007). Below we consider both aspects of organizational involvement and pro-\npose competing hypotheses.\n2.2.1 The Scope of Organizational Involvement\nScholars argue that the scope of organizational involvement, which is measured\nby the number of affiliations to which one belongs, is important in fostering\ntions in civic associations provide non-redundant information, cultivate shared\nidentification and trust, and convey a sense of cooperation and efficacy.\nFirst, overlapping memberships indicate crosscutting ties, which function as\ninformation systems, i. e., the bridging form of social capital that Burt (2000)\nadvocates. These bridging ties help disseminate knowledge about current issues\nand how the association relates to them. A majority of civic associations now\nsend their members published newsletters, through which participants can be\ninformed about the goings-on in the association. Second, overlapping\nHow do Civic Associations Foster Political Participation? 7\nmemberships in several associations can cultivate a sense of identification and\ntrust, which can be transferred to several contexts and possibly to society as a\nThird, membership conveys a sense of the value of cooperation for common\npurposes and of political efficacy (Paxton 2007). Therefore, it is likely that\nindividuals with more affiliations will participate more in politics. For example,\nin a case study on an American civic association, Erickson and Nosanchuk\n(1990) showed that associational involvement positively influences political\ninvolvement by bringing participants into contact with politically active friends.\nWolleb\u00e6k and Str\u00f8msnes (2007) found that multiple memberships have a very\nstrong effect on political engagement, because overlapping membership\nbetween different organizations helps develop and disseminate social trust.\nSimilarly, Alexander et al. (2010)'s study revealed that people who associate\nwith a wider range of groups are more likely to be politically engaged than\nthose who are active within a small number of groups.\nThe effect of the scope of civic association on political participation may\nvary across modes. Given that voting is a relatively individualized and anon-\nymous political act, it may not be affected by memberships. In contrast, formal\nand informal modes of participation may be mobilized by overlapping networks.\nTherefore, we hypothesize as follows,\nH1 The number of affiliations in civic associations is positively associated with\nformal mode of political participation.\nH2 The number of affiliations in civic associations is positively associated with\ninformal mode of political participation.\n2.2.2 The Intensity of Organizational Involvement\nContrary to the membership approach, scholars like Putnam (2000) and\nSkocpol, Ganz, and Munson (2000) emphasized the benefits (e. g., social\ncapital, trust, norms) accrued from intense interactions within civic associa-\ntions. Putnam (2000) believed that frequent face-to-face contact between\nmembers helps foster societal trust and cooperative behavior which are essen-\ntial to the vitality of American democracy. He claimed that social capital in the\nUnited States is declining, because active voluntary associations are being\nreplaced by growing tertiary organizations (i. e., mailing list) in which mem-\nbers do not interact personally. Skocpol, Ganz, and Munson (2000) took it one\nstep further and proposed that multi-tiered national federations consisting of\nrobust local chapters are key supports of classic American voluntarism\nbecause they offer an institutional framework in which nationwide leadership\n8 H. Li and J. Zhang\nnetworks are sustained and career lines, resources, and incentives for member-\nship organizers are provided.\nIndividuals participate in civic associations by engaging in or even shaping\norganizational activities, which include going to meetings where they take part\nin decision making, planning or chairing a meeting, giving public speeches,\namong others. Through participating in these activities, one may foster confi-\ndence and efficacy, acquire democratic skills, inculcate civic virtues, and gain\npolitical knowledge. Hence, those individuals who are more involved, or who\nparticipate in more organizational activities, are considered \"active members,\"\nand they are likely to engage more in politics because of their public-spirited-\nput, civic association \"teaches people about the operations of governments,\naffords them the opportunity to understand the potentials and limits of their\nown personal influence, sharpens their cognitive skills and gives them the\nexperience necessary to develop self-confidence in their abilities\" (p. 256).\nNonetheless, this effect may vary across different modes of political partici-\npation. As voting is a highly individualized and low-initiative political act, it\nmay not be affected much by the extent to which one engages in civic associa-\ntions. The other two modes of political acts, including formal and informal\nparticipation, may be fostered by one's intensity of involvement in civic associa-\ntions. For example, through engaging in group discussions, one may have more\nideas of what constitutes effective political action and may act on it (Eliasoph\nH3 The depth of involvement in civic associations is positively associated with\nformal mode of political participation.\nH4 The depth of involvement in civic associations is positively associated with\ninformal mode of political participation.\n3 Data and Method\nTo examine factors associated with different types of political participation, this\nstudy uses data from the U.S. \"Citizenship, Involvement, and Democracy\" (CID)\nSurvey, which was conducted by the Center for Democracy and Civil Society at\nconsisted of in-person interviews with a representative sample of 1,001\nHow do Civic Associations Foster Political Participation? 9\nAmericans whose age were 18 years old or over. The survey employed a clus-\ntered sample design and achieved an overall response rate of 40 %. The CID\nSurvey covered a variety of questions, related to the participants' socioeconomic\nstatus, political participation, voluntary associations, and personal networks.\nCompared to the American Citizen Participation Study (Verba et al. 1990),1 which\nis a widely-used dataset over the past two decades, the CID data provides\ncomparable level of details, but with updated information.\n3.2 Dependent Variables\nThree different modes of political participation are measured. The first is\nbinary, measuring one's participation in voting. The second set of dependent\nvariables measures different forms of political participation. It is derived from\na question that asked whether a respondent had participated in any of the\n11 political activities in the year prior to 2006. Examples include contacting a\npolitician or a local government official, signing a petition, donating money to\na political organization or group, and participating in illegal protests. Based on\nthe characteristics of these activities, we categorize them into two distinct\nmodes of political participation \u00ad formal and informal. Formal participation\ncaptures those activities that are more formal and institutionalized. The vari-\nable consists of six items, including 1) contacting a politician or a local\ngovernment official; 2) working in a political party or action group; 3) working\nfor the campaign of a candidate for office; 4) working in another political\norganization or association; 5) wearing or displaying a campaign badge/\nsticker; and 6) donating money to a political organization or group. A higher\nscale variable is created by summing the six items. Informal participation\ninvolves those activities that are more informal and non-institutionalized.\nThis variable consists of five items, including 1) signing a petition; 2) taking\npart in a lawful public demonstration; 3) boycotting a certain product;\n4) deliberately buying certain products for political or ethical reasons; and\n5) participating in illegal protests. The variable is calculated by summing the\nabove five items.\n1 The American Citizen Participation Study (ACPS) is a survey of adults living in the United\nStates in 1989 and 1990. It was designed to examine political and nonpolitical civic participa-\ntion. In the survey, respondents were asked to provide information on various topics, including\ntheir interest in politics and their party identification, voting status, and activity in community\npolitics. Information on campaign activities and personal experiences with government pro-\ngrams and opinions on national and social problems was also collected.\n10 H. Li and J. Zhang\n3.3 Independent Variables\nTwo aspects of organizational involvement in civic associations are measured:\nthe scope and the intensity. The scope of organizational involvement is mea-\nsured by the number of affiliations that one participates in any of the fifteen\ncivic associations, including 1) sports clubs, 2) cultural or hobby groups, 3) trade\nunions, 4) business or professional organizations, 5) consumer or automobile\norganizations, 6) human rights organizations, 7) religious organizations,\n8) political parties, 9) neighborhood/homeowner associations, 10) veteran's\norganizations, 11) ethnic or racial groups, 12) self-help groups, 13) organizations\nfor environmental protection, peace, or animal rights, 14) organizations for\nscience, education, or teachers and parents, and 15) organizations that provide\nsocial services to the needy. The intensity of organizational involvement is a\nscale ranging from 1 to 4 where 1 means one participates in one of the following\nactivities, including writing a letter, going to a meeting where one took part in\nmaking decisions, planning or chairing a meeting, or giving a presentation or\nspeech in the organizations that one is most active at, and 4 means one\nparticipates in all 4 activities.\n3.4 Control Variables\nThe first set of control variables concerns one's socioeconomic status.\nAccording to the standard socioeconomic model, which was first elucidated\nby Verba and Nie (1972), political participation is primarily driven by one's\nsocioeconomic status and civic orientations. As high-status individuals are\nbetter located in the social environments, they have more resources and\nopportunities to enhance and cultivate participatory norms and civic skills.\nThus, compared to low-status individuals, those in a high socioeconomic\nstatus are more likely to participate in politics.\nIncome and education are among the most important variables to measure\none's socioeconomic status. Education, because it enhances political interest\nand civic skills, and income because of the monetary resources that it pro-\nexample, argue that education allows citizens to acquire necessary civic skills\nto understand abstract political issues and communicate their concerns to\ngovernment officials and politicians. Therefore, people with higher income\nand education may be more likely to use institutionalized channels, such as\nvoting and formal forms, to participate in politics. Given these options, they\nmay not choose to use informal means of participation.\nHow do Civic Associations Foster Political Participation? 11\nIncome is a categorical variable measuring a household's total annual net\nincome.2 It consists of eleven categories, with the lowest being less than\nrical variable. It covers 6 levels of educational attainment: 1) None, or grades\n1\u00ad8, 2) High school incomplete \u00ad grades 9\u00ad11, 3) Business, technical, or voca-\ntional school after high school, 4) Some college, no 4-year degree, 5) College\ngraduate, and 6) Post-graduate training, professional schooling after college.\nIt is expected that individuals with higher income and education are more likely\nto engage in voting and formal mode of political participation.\nThe second set of control variables examines one's network mobilization.\nThe mobilization approach asserts that individuals are embedded in their social\nnetworks where contextual cues and political opportunities may be supplied and\nparticipation may be mobilized. Being asked to participate by one's political\nparty, groups of affiliation, family, friends, or others in the social networks,\nmakes one more likely to engage in political activities (e. g., Booth and Richard\nmany studies have highlighted the positive association between recruitment and\nthe likelihood of one's engagement in protests, boycotts, or the like (Diani and\nWalker 2008). Therefore, mobilization allows people to live beyond personal\nresource constraints and may narrow the participation gap between low and\nMobilization is a binary variable that captures whether an individual was\nasked to vote, to contribute money to a political cause, or to engage in some other\ntype of political activity. It is coded as 1 if the individual was asked, 0 otherwise.\nIn addition, several other control variables, including age, gender, race,\nparty identification, political interests, and political efficacy, were considered.\nAge is a subtraction of the year or birth from 2005, the year of the survey. It\nranges from 18 to 90. Gender is a binary variable in which 1 refers to male and 0\notherwise. The variable on race encompasses four dummy variables where\nwhites serve as the reference group. Party identification consists of two\n2 According to the data coding handbook, the original question on the main income variable\nhas a great deal of missing data (including 95 refused, 29 don't know, 10 no answer). To correct\nmissing data problem, in the appendix of the released dataset, the author of the dataset,\nHoward, Gibson and Stolle constructed a new variable \u00ad adjusted income \u00ad which is based\non imputations from a combination of homeownership, the interviewer's estimate of the\nrespondent's social class, the respondent's response to a question about \"how you feel about\nyour household's income nowadays\", and a follow-up question about whether the respondent's\n12 H. Li and J. Zhang\ndummy variables where the independent serves as the reference group. The\nvariable on political interests measures how interested one is in politics, where\n1 refers to she/he is not at all interested, 2 not very interested, 3 somewhat\ninterested, and 4 very interested. The last control variable, political efficacy, is\nconstructed from the question \u00ad \"do you think that politicians care what people\nlike you think?\" This is a 5-point scale variable, in which 1 refers to \"hardly any\npolitics care what people like me think,\" and 5 means \"most politicians care\nwhat people like me think.\"\n3.5 Analytic Techniques\nAs voting is a binary dependent variable, a logistic model is used. Given that\nboth formal and informal participation are count dependent variables and their\nstandard deviations are larger than their means, negative binomial regression\nanalysis is conducted using Stata 12.\nTable 2 shows the descriptive statistics for the variables. On average, American\ncitizens participated in 2 out of 14 political activities in 2006. This echoes\nPutnam (2000)'s argument regarding the decline of civic engagement.3\nCompared to informal participation, citizens engage more in formal political\nactivities. Cross-tabulation results reveal that individual Americans who engage\nin voting are also significantly more likely to participate in formal political\nactivities (chi-square = 81.07, p < 0.000). The results are similar in any other\ntwo pairs of cross-tabulations. Thus, we suspect that the strong relationship\nacross different types of political participation is in large part due to the shared\nindividual- or organizational-level attributes (Jeong 2013).\n3 In Bowling Alone, Putnam presented a series of evidence regarding the decline of civic\nengagement: 1) voter turnout had declined by nearly a quarter from a relative high point in\nthe early 1960s to 1990; 2) membership in traditional women's groups had steadily declined;\n3) the number of volunteers for civic organizations had significantly reduced; 4) the number of\nAmericans who report that \"in the past year they have attended a public meeting on town or\nreply that they \"trust the government in Washington\" only \"some of the time\" or \"almost never\"\nHow do Civic Associations Foster Political Participation? 13\nTable 3 displays the Pearson correlation coefficients for the variables described\nabove. The two independent variables are not highly correlated (r = 0.34), pro-\nviding some confidence that they tap into different aspects of civic participation.\nThe correlation matrix also shows that the independent variables are all sig-\nnificantly correlated with the three modes of political participation.\nTable 4 presents three models with different modes of political participation\nas the dependent variables. As the dependent variables for the first two models\nare all count variables, the explanatory variables are thus the log of expected\ncounts. To facilitate interpretation, incidence rate ratio (IRR) is calculated. IRR\nrepresents the estimated ratio for a one-unit increase in the independent vari-\nables, holding other variables constant in the model. The value of IRR is either\nabove or below 1. If IRR is above 1, the value from IRR minus 1 indicates the\nextent to which the dependent variables increase with a one-unit change in the\nindependent variables, and vice versa.\nModel 1 examines factors associated with formal mode of participation. On\naverage, holding constant other factors, with one additional increase in the\nnumber of affiliations in civic associations, the expected log count of the\nnumber of formal political acts increases by 0.058 (p < 0.05), supporting H1. In\nTable 2: Descriptive statistics.\nVariables Mean Std.\nDeviation\nFormal mode of participation (count) . .\nInformal mode of participation (count) . .\nVoting (binary) . .\nMembership in civic associations (count) . .\nDepth of involvement in the most active\norganizations (scale)\n. .\nIncome (categorical) . .\nEducation (categorical) . .\nMobilized (binary) . .\nAge (quantitative) . .\nGender (binary) . .\nAsian . .\nBlack . .\nHispanic . .\nOther . .\nRepublican . .\nLiberal . .\nPolitical interest (scale) . .\nPolitical efficacy (scale) . .\n14 H. Li and J. Zhang\nother words, for each one-unit increase in the number of civic associations, the\nexpected number of political acts in which one engages increases by a factor of\n1.059, or 5.9 %. Regarding the intensity of involvement, adjusting for other\nfactors, for each one-unit increase in the level of involvement in the voluntary\norganization at which one is most active, the expected number of political acts\nincreases by 14.4 % (p < 0.001). H3 is supported. Thus, the intensity of involve-\nment matters more than the scope of memberships in formal participation.\nTable 3: Correlation matrix.\nVariables          \n Formal\nmode of\nparticipation\n.\n Informal\nmode of\nparticipation\n.* .\n Voting .* .* .\n Membership .* .* .* .\n Intensity .* .* .* .* .\n Income .* .* .* .* .* .\n Education .* .* .* .* .* .* .\n Mobilization .* .* .* .* .* .* .* .\n Age .* -.* .* .* -.* -. -.* . .\n Gender .* . . . . .* -. -. . .\n Asian -. -. -. . -. . .* -. -.* -.\n Black -. -. . -. -. -.* -.* . -. -.\n Hispanic -. -. -.* -.* . -.* -.* -.* -.* .\n Other . . . . . . . -. -. .\n Republican . -. .* . -. .* .* . . .\n Liberal .* .* . . . -.* -. . . -.\n Political\ninterest\n.* .* .* .* .* .* .* .* .* .*\n Political\nefficacy\n.* .* .* .* . .* .* .* -. -.\nVariables        \n Asian .\n Black -. .\n Hispanic -. -.* .\n Other -. -. -. .\n Republican -. -.* -. . .\n Liberal -. .* . . -.* .\n Political\ninterest\n. -. -. . .* . .\n Political\nefficacy\n-. -. -.* . .* -. .* \nHow do Civic Associations Foster Political Participation? 15\nAmong the control variables, neither income nor education is statistically sig-\nnificant. Compared to those who were not asked by their friends or relatives, the\nexpected number of formal political acts for those who were asked to participate\nis 62.1 % higher (p < 0.001). This is consistent with the findings from social\nnetwork scholars who argue that the recruitment effect is strong among those\nwho have a close relationship. This kind of embeddedness provides quality\ninformation on politics, mutual trust, and certainty (McAdam and Paulsen\n1993).

Those who report being\nmore interested in politics engage more in formal political participation\nModel 2 examines factors associated with informal political participation.\nInterestingly, the scope of memberships is not statistically significant anymore,\nrejecting H2. The intensity of involvement remains significant, and the effect is\nported. Income is not statistically significant in predicting one's participation in\ninformal political activities, but education is negatively associated with infor-\nmal political participation (p < 0.05). In other words, people with higher level of\neducation tend to engage in informal participation less. Furthermore, mobiliza-\ntion remains significant. Adjusting for other factors, the expected number of\ninformal political acts for those who were asked to participate is 34.3 % higher\nthan for those who were not asked (p < 0.01). Political interest remains signifi-\nexisting studies find. Controlling for other factors, one additional year of\nincrease in age decreases the expected count of informal political acts by\n1.3 % (p < 0.001). This makes sense since younger people are usually more likely\nto participate in demonstrations or illegal protests. Two of the race variables are\nsignificant in this model. Holding constant other variables, compared to\nWhites, the expected numbers of informal political acts for Blacks and\nrespectively.\nModel 3 examines factors associated with voting. Neither the scope nor the\nintensity of organizational involvement matters. Education has a statistically\nsignificant effect on voting. Controlling for other factors, one additional year\nof education increases one's likelihood of participating in voting by 55.5 %\n(p < 0.001). This effect is substantial, and it implies that more investment in\neducation will probably boost voting rate. Mobilization does not lead to higher\nvoter turnout. Age is statistically significant; one additional year of increase in\nage increases one's likelihood of voting by 4.3 % (p < 0.001), adjusting for other\nfactors. Compared to Whites, Hispanics are statistically less likely to vote\nto vote than independents, holding constant other factors.

Neither the scope nor the intensity of organiza-\ntional involvement explains voting behavior. This finding differs from Wolleb\u00e6k\nscope of organizational links has substantially strong explanatory power in\npredicting political participation. Why is this so? Due to the unavailability of\ndata, we are unable to empirically examine this question. We suspect that the\ndifference in findings may be attributed to the distinct characteristics of various\nmodes of political participation. In particular, voting is more individualized\nparticipation with minimal policy influence; thus civic associations are not\ndirectly associated with voter turnout. Informal political activities are more\ndifficult to carry out and require more commitment. Active involvement in\ncivic associations helps foster political efficacy and \"persuade\" one to act;\nsimple affiliation may be unable to achieve this. Thus, membership is not\nrelated to informal participation.\nIn addition, the socioeconomic status has more explanatory power in indi-\nvidualized political activities, such as voting. While income is not significant in\nall three models, education is highly significant in predicting voting and infor-\nmal participation. Mobilization is positively associated with one's participation\nin both formal and informal political activities, both of which require more time,\nefforts, and resources to carry out. The requests from friends or relatives provide\nan external stimulus to participation.\nTo further explore the effects of the intensity of involvement, we graphed the\nexpected number of political activities by intensity of involvement in civic\nassociations, adjusting for other factors, see Figure 1. The X-axis indicates the\nnumber of activities one performs in the organization, and the Y-axis is the\nPolitical Activities\nIntensity of Involvement\nformal informal\nFigure 1: Predicted number of political activities by intensity of involvement in civic associa-\ntions, adjusting for other factors.\n18 H. Li and J. Zhang\npredicted number of political activities. The two different patterns in the col-\numns indicate two different modes of political participation. We can see that as\none is more involved in civic associations, the number of political activities\nincreases across the two modes. But roughly, the increase is more substantial in\nformal participation mode, suggesting that the effect of the intensity of involve-\nment is larger.\n5 Discussion and Conclusion\nExisting literature depicts the relationship between civic associations and\ndemocracy from two perspectives (Torpe 2003). The first highlights the internal\ndemocratic role of associations. Through participating in the internal life of\nassociations, one learns democratic norms and values, develops democratic\ncompetences, and becomes more active in politics. The second focuses on the\nexternal democratic role of associations, which are considered as intermediary\ninstitutions between citizens and government. This paper joins the first perspec-\ntive by examining how civic associations contribute to political participation.\nUsing the Citizenship, Involvement, and Democracy dataset, we showed that\nparticipation in politics rises with participation in voluntary associations, even\nwhen these associations are quite apolitical. Specifically, we disaggregated\npolitical participation into three modes: formal, informal participation, and\nvoting. We then highlighted two aspects of involvement in civic associations:\nthe scope versus the intensity. The former argues that civic associations serve as\nnetworks of bridging social ties through which novel information travel. The\nmore affiliations to which one belongs, the more exposed one is to social\ninfluence, and thus, the more political activities one will participate in. In\ncontrast, the latter proposes that civic associations are socialization agents\nthrough which the seeds for generalized social trust, identification, and cohe-\nsion sprout. The more involved one is in the active associations, the more\npolitical activities one will engage in. We found that the intensity argument is\nsupported in two types of political activities, including formal and informal\nparticipation. However, the number of affiliations affects formal participation\nbut does not have a significant impact on informal participation. This is inter-\nesting because it enriched our understanding on the longstanding debate\nbetween bonding and bridging social capital (Burt 2000). Bonding ties are the\nstrong ties that exist within closed networks. They help disseminate information\namong densely connected members within a certain group, reducing the cost of\nobtaining information. They also help build and reinforce participants' identities\nand cultivate collective norms. Knoke (1990), for example, examines the\nHow do Civic Associations Foster Political Participation? 19\nnetworks of political action, arguing that when people discuss political matters\nwith their intimates very frequently, their interests and participation in national\ncampaigns and voting will be enhanced. In contrast, bridging ties are the weak\nties that exist between groups, creating \"brokerage opportunities\" and providing\nthe intensity of organizational involvement matters more than the scope. Thus,\nbonding social capital is more important in promoting political actions.\nFurthermore, we found that the classic socioeconomic status model works\nbetter in predicting individualized political activities, such as voting, whereas\nmobilization has strong explanatory power in predicting both formal and infor-\nmal political acts\u00adthose require more efforts and are more difficult to carry out.\nThis study contributes to the literature on political participation in three\nways. First, by identifying, conceptualizing, and unpacking political participa-\ntion, it attempts to bring some conceptual order to a research area that has been\nextensively explored in recent decades. Second, by incorporating these dimen-\nsions in multivariate models, it disentangles the explanatory power of the often\ndiscussed mechanisms in each type of political participation. Finally, by giving\nspecial attention to organizational involvement and the mobilization effects, the\nresearch highlights that compared to socioeconomic characteristics, associa-\ntional life, especially one's depth of involvement in civic associations and social\nnetwork, have a more significant effect in political recruitment.\nOur study carries important implications for policy makers and nonprofit\npractitioners. Over the past two decades, the nonprofit sector has become\nincreasingly professionalized. Many small, local-based civic associations have\nbeen replaced by large, membership-based associations in which members do\nnot have frequent interaction with each other and the organizations. The intense\nface-to-face encounters and the benefits that these interactions generate seem to\nhave withered. However, it is these interactions that cultivate political interest,\nefficacy, and participatory norms. Facilitating frequent interactions thus seems\ncritical. While the growth of nationwide, professionalized associations seems to\nbe an inevitable trend, establishing an institutional framework in which robust\nlocal chapters are supported is a viable strategy. In particular, guidelines on\nhow to develop leadership, integrate resources, and engage members should be\nprovided to these local chapters. For nonprofit managers, more attention should\nbe paid to encourage citizens to involve actively in associational activities, such\nas attending meetings, holding discussion sessions, or organizing activities. In\norder to nurture the nonprofit sector, policy makers should focus their funds and\nenergies on building the capacity of local-based civic associations.\nThis study has limitations as well. The study only looks at one way of a\nprobably two-way relationship between voluntary and political participation.\n20 H. Li and J. Zhang\nClearly, the two variables are interconnected and endogenous. That is, involve-\nment in voluntary organizations helps foster civic skills and democratic values\nand thus can promote political participation, but in turn, political participation\nmay reinforce one's level of engagement in voluntary associations. As Diani\n(2004) asserts, the process of movement participation is dynamic and diachronic\nin the sense that memberships in voluntary organizations contribute to social\nmovement mobilization and this very participation also helps forge new bonds\namong participants. Longitudinal data are required in order to address the\nendogeneity problem. Nonetheless, we are cautious in establishing the link\nbetween civic associations and political participation. When discussing the\nrole of civic associations, we confined our purview to involvements in organiza-\ntions that do not take stands on public issues. This permits us to make the\nassumption of causal priority for civic organizations. In addition, the dataset\nused in this study was collected in 2006. Now that almost 10 years have passed,\nit is possible that the participation landscape has changed greatly, and the\nimpact of the factors on political participation reported here may vary. Future\nstudy should use a more up-to-date data set and examine how the mechanisms\nshape various modes of political participation.\nReferences\nAlexander, D. T., J. Barraket, J. M. Lewis, and M.
