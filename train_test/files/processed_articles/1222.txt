The burden of\ndeath attributable to diabetes in the United States is not well quantified, particularly with regard to age. The\nauthors analyzed data from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) (1976\u00ad\n1980) and the NHANES II Mortality Study, in which a nationally representative cohort of 9,250 adults aged 30\u00ad\n75 years was followed for 12\u00ad16 years, to determine all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Overall, between\nmortality was 1.9 (95% confidence interval: 1.5, 2.3), and the population attributable risk (PAR) was 3.6%. The\nrelative hazard of CVD mortality was 2.3 (95% confidence interval: 1.8, 2.8), and the PAR was 5.2%. Including\nparticipants with undiagnosed diabetes in the estimates increased the PAR for all-cause mortality to 5.1% and\nthat for CVD mortality to 6.8%. Women had a higher prevalence of diagnosed diabetes than men and a greater\nrelative hazard of death than nondiabetic women, leading to a higher PAR for women (3.8% for all causes and\n7.3% for CVD) versus men (3.3% for all causes and 3.8% for CVD). These data suggest that diabetes accounts\nfor at least 3.6% of all deaths and 5.2% of CVD deaths in US adults. Improvements in diabetes prevention and\ntreatment should produce noticeable effects on US life expectancy.\ndiabetes mellitus; mortality\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; NHANES II, Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; PAR, population\nattributable risk.\nIt is estimated that 5.9 percent of US adults over age 20\nyears have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (1, 2). By\nthe year 2025, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in US\nadults may reach 8.9 percent (3). Diabetes is a well-estab-\nlished risk factor for lower extremity amputation, retinop-\nathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease\n(4). Thus, it is not surprising that diabetes contributed to\nand that it was listed as the underlying cause of death for\nleading cause of death. However, such attributions are\nsubject to two major sources of bias. First, most studies esti-\nmating the burden of diabetes are based on death certificate\ncoding, where underreporting of diabetes may lead to 50\npercent of all deaths attributable to diabetes being missed\n(7). Second, there is an assumption that all deaths among\npeople with diabetes are solely related to diabetes (i.e., that\nthe etiologic fraction is 100 percent), leading to an overesti-\nmate of the number of deaths (8, 9).\nA more sound approach is calculation of the population\nattributable risk (PAR), which is independent of death certif-\nicate coding and makes no a priori assumption about the\netiologic fraction. The PAR is a common tool for public\nhealth officials and researchers for planning and allocating\nhealth care resources and understanding the burden of\ndiabetes. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there are no\npreviously published studies with data on the PAR of\ndiabetes-related death in the United States (10, 11), nor have\nReprint requests to Dr. Frederick L.

In the calculation of\nPARs, we paid special attention to the effect of age, since\nthere is some controversy over the benefits of aggressive\ndiabetes care among older persons (12), and gender, since\nthere is evidence of an increased risk of cardiovascular\ndisease among women with diabetes (13).\nMethods\nData sources. Data were obtained from the Second\nNational Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES II)\nMortality Study, a prospective cohort study that passively\nfollowed participants over 30 years of age who underwent a\ndetailed examination (n = 9,250). NHANES II was\nCenter for Health Statistics (14). The response rate for adults\naged 20\u00ad74 years who were selected and completed the\nParticipants. Participants were classified as having previ-\nously diagnosed diabetes if they answered \"yes\" to the ques-\ntions \"Do you have sugar diabetes?\" and \"Did a doctor tell\nBaseline assessments. Data on participants' age at inter-\nview, sex, race, years of education (less than high school,\nhigh school or greater), and personal health characteristics\nwere obtained by interview (16, 17). The physical examina-\ntion included measurements of height, weight, and blood\npressure (18). Body mass index was calculated as weight\n(kg) divided by height (m) squared for each participant.\nLaboratory measures included standard blood assays for\nserum total cholesterol level (19).\nTo determine the effect of undiagnosed diabetes on esti-\nmates of the number of deaths attributable to diabetes, we\nconducted a subgroup analysis of participants selected for\noral glucose tolerance testing at baseline who had fasted for\nat least 8 hours and had a fasting plasma glucose value (n =\nparticipants (6.9 percent) with a fasting plasma glucose level\nof 126 mg/dl were classified as having undiagnosed\ndiabetes.\nOutcomes. Mortality status was ascertained for the years\nSocial Security Administration's Death Master File (21).\nThere was no censoring due to loss to follow-up in this\ncohort; participants not found to be deceased by December\ncardiovascular disease if any of the following conditions\nwere coded as the underlying cause of death according to the\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision:\ncardiovascular disease (code 429.2), cerebrovascular disease\nAnalysis\nWeighting to the US population. All of the analyses were\nweighted to the US population at the midpoint of NHANES\nII (March 1, 1978) using SUDAAN statistical software,\nversion 6.4 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle\nPark, North Carolina) to account for the complex survey\ndesign and to obtain nationally representative estimates (22).\nBaseline comparisons. Demographic characteristics and\ncardiovascular disease risk factors at baseline were\ncompared for participants with diabetes versus those without\ndiabetes using analysis of variance or Pearson's 2, after\nstratification by age group. All tests of significance were\ntwo-tailed. No corrections were made for multiple compari-\nsons.\nProportional hazards analysis. To determine the inde-\npendent relative hazard of mortality related to diabetes, we\nused proportional hazards models to adjust simultaneously\nfor age, sex, race, education, behavioral risk factors (phys-\nical activity and smoking), and biologic risk factors (body\nmass index, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol\nlevel). There were no significant first-order interactions\nbetween diabetes status and any other covariate (all p's >\n0.05). Graphs of the log-log plot of the relative hazards by\ntime showed that the assumption of proportional hazards was\nmet.\nPAR analysis. The following formula was used to calcu-\nlate the PAR for the entire cohort and then separately for\neach age group:\nPAR = Pe\n(RH \u00ad 1)/[Pe\nwhere Pe\nis the prevalence of diabetes and RH is the fully\nadjusted relative hazard (23).\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics and risk factors at baseline\nTable 1 summarizes the characteristics of the cohort by\nage group and diabetes status at baseline. Expected trends\nwere observed across age groups for participants with and\nwithout diabetes.\nPAR and age\nUnlike the relative hazard of death related to diabetes,\nwhich decreased with increasing age, the prevalence of\ndiabetes increased from the youngest group to the oldest\ngroup (table 2). Thus, the PAR of all-cause mortality due to\ndiabetes increased from the youngest ages to the oldest (table\n2). A similar trend was seen for cardiovascular disease\nmortality (table 2).\nPAR and gender\nOverall, women had a slightly higher prevalence of diag-\nnosed diabetes than men (4.7 percent vs. 3.8 percent, p =\n0.05) (table 3). The relative hazard of mortality among\nwomen with diagnosed diabetes compared with those\nwithout diabetes was 1.83 (95 percent confidence interval\nTABLE 1.

The increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular\ndisease mortality for women with diagnosed diabetes trans-\nlated to a higher PAR for women (3.8 percent for all causes\nand 7.3 percent for cardiovascular disease) compared with\nmen (3.3 percent for all causes and 3.8 percent for cardiovas-\ncular disease) (table 3).\nInfluence of undiagnosed diabetes\nIn the foregoing analyses, individuals with undiagnosed\ndiabetes were classified as \"nondiabetic.\" To determine\nwhether reclassification of these individuals would influence\nthe PAR, we conducted a subsidiary analysis in a subgroup\nof individuals who underwent oral glucose tolerance testing\n(table 3). Incorporation of undiagnosed diabetes led to an\nincrease in prevalence (8.9 percent) but a decrease in the\nrelative hazard of death among persons with undiagnosed\nand diagnosed diabetes compared with nondiabetics for all-\n2.00) and cardiovascular disease mortality (relative hazard =\nin prevalence was proportionally greater than the decrease in\nthe relative hazard, the net effect on the PAR was positive.\nDISCUSSION\nBeyond confirming an excess risk of mortality among\nadults with diabetes, these results support two conclusions.\npercent of cardiovascular disease deaths are attributable to\ndiabetes in the general US population aged 30\u00ad75 years.\nPARs are even greater for women, whose relative hazard of\nmortality related to diabetes is greater than that for men.\nSecond, the risk of mortality attributable to diabetes does not\ndiminish with age, even though the relative hazard declines\nwith age. This is due to the increase in the prevalence of\ndiabetes with age, which increases the number of deaths\nrelated to diabetes and cancels out the effect of the\ndecreasing relative hazard.\nStrengths of this study include its large, nationally repre-\nsentative sample and 12\u00ad16 years of follow-up and the\nability to evaluate attributable risk estimates for undiagnosed\ndiabetes. Nonetheless, several limitations of this study\nshould be kept in mind. First, there was potential misclassi-\nfication of vital status, because a person not found to be\nstatus was evaluated independently of diabetes status,\nmisclassification is likely to have been nondifferential and\nwould have produced a conservative bias (10). Second,\ndiabetes status was only assessed at one point in time, at\nbaseline. In populations similar to that of NHANES II, the\nincidence rate of progression from impaired glucose toler-\n(26). Participants with normal glucose tolerance or impaired\nglucose tolerance who developed diabetes during follow-up\nwere considered to have no diabetes in this study. However,\nit is to be expected that they would have higher mortality\nthan participants who never developed diabetes, biasing the\nrelative hazard and PAR estimates towards the null (27). For\nthese reasons, the results presented here may be underesti-\nmates of the burden of death due to diabetes.\nThird, NHANES II did not include individuals living in\ninstitutions, including long-term care facilities and nursing\nhomes (14). The National Nursing Home Survey estimated\nyears were known to be in health care institutions and\nTABLE 3.

It is to be expected that these individuals\nwould have greater mortality than persons who participated\nin NHANES II. Finally, there was nonresponse in NHANES\nII at each stage of the survey. In particular, for adults aged\nthe examination completed it and thus were included in the\nmortality study (14). On the other hand, respondents and\nnonrespondents did not differ significantly in terms of demo-\ngraphic or health-related characteristics (28).\nMethods of estimating deaths attributable to diabetes face\nmultiple biases. The commonly used approach involving\nnational mortality statistics and death certificates suggests\nthat diabetes contributes to 8.4 percent of deaths in the\nUnited States (5, 6). However it is suspected that this quan-\ntity is an underestimate, because death certificates do not\ninclude 37\u00ad47 percent of people who have diabetes and die\n(7\u00ad9) and they may underestimate diabetes deaths almost\nthreefold (29). Opposing this underreporting on death certif-\nicates is the assumption that the etiologic fraction for deaths\namong people with diabetes is 100 percent. Similarly, the\nPAR calculation method used in this paper is likely to under-\nestimate deaths attributable to diabetes, because of the\nfactors described above. While it is difficult to assign an\nexact estimate to the proportion of deaths due to diabetes in\nthe United States, given the multiple biases, our conservative\nestimate of 5.1 percent is relatively similar to previously\npublished estimates from mortality statistics (5, 16), and it\nestablishes an empirical lower limit for diabetes-related\nmortality.\nAs the prevalence of diabetes continues to increase in the\nUnited States, it will become more important to estimate the\nimpact of diabetes on mortality in order to effectively assess\nprogress in treating the disease (30). These results indicate\nthat improvements in the treatment and prevention of\ndiabetes may postpone these deaths and have an impact on\nlife expectancy in the United States, even at older ages. This\nstudy suggests a need for research on barriers to and facilita-\ntors of treatment for people with diabetes and the develop-\nment of approaches that promote cooperation by patients\nwith their treatment regimen.\n"
