Introduction\nThe Research Center on Health Disparities, Equity, and the Exposome employs a transdisciplinary,\nexternal exposome framework. This framework integrates diverse data for exposure assessment and\nuses sophisticated tools and methods, such as spatial analytics, Geographic Information Systems (GIS),\nspatiotemporal and computational models to identify health disparities \"hotspots\" among and within\nsubpopulations in order to design place-based, public health interventions. Geographically-targeted\ninterventions to break the chain of disparity in a subpopulation and the indicated geographic\nregion are needed to support public health decision-making and policies. In previous work [1],\nwe applied the external exposome framework to a subset of a previously established multidimensional,\nspatiotemporal data repository of county-level health, socioeconomic, and environmental measures\nobtained from publicly available sources including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Census Bureau, Health Resources and Services\nAdministration (HRSA), etc.\nThe external exposome approach builds on the work of Wild [2,3], who first coined the term\n\"exposome\" as a measure of the totality of life-long environmental exposures on health. It also\naddresses the need identified by Payne-Sturges and Gee [4] for a model to test empirically the\ninterrelations between social, physical, and built environments and health disparities. In this\ncurrent effort, we applied an external exposome framework, geographic information systems, and\nspatiotemporal models to study the interrelationships between multiple health and environmental\ndimensions and several health outcomes among women.\nLow income, African American women who do not complete high school, and present later in\ntheir pregnancy for prenatal care, have a higher than average prevalence of unintended pregnancies\nand higher than average rates of pregnancy-related morbidities and mortalities [5]. They also have\nhigher prevalence of overweight/obesity, alcohol use, exposure to second hand smoke before and\nduring pregnancy compared to non-Hispanic White women, lack preconception care, have limited\naccess to other healthy reproductive and sexual practices or are disproportionately affected by chronic\ndiseases that negatively impact pregnancy outcomes [6\u00ad10]. Over the last 50 years, the risk of death\nfrom pregnancy complications for African American women was four times higher than for White\nwomen. Studies suggest that between 20%\u00ad50% of these maternal deaths were preventable [13].\nThe top five causes of maternal mortality were embolism, hemorrhage, preeclampsia and eclampsia,\ninfection, and cardiomyopathy [14]. Tucker et al. [11] examined the prevalence of common pregnancy\ncomplications and associated fatality rates. African American women also were found more likely to\nhave preexisting medical conditions (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, asthma, connective tissue disease,\nhuman immunodeficiency virus, genitourinary infections, and periodontal disease), have unintended\npregnancies, and to be publically insured and/or Medicaid eligible due to pregnancy [15]. While the\nnumber of deaths from hemorrhage has declined in recent years, deaths from pulmonary embolus and\nhypertension have not [16].\n1.2. Infant Mortality, Premature Birth, Low Birthweight, and Maternal Morbidities\nIn 2007, the infant mortality rate for African American women nationally was 2.4 times the rate\nfor White women [17]. The leading cause of infant death among African American women was short\ngestation and/or low birthweight (LBW) [17]. Increased risk of infant mortality has been associated\nwith lower socioeconomic status, lower educational attainment, decreased access and utilization of\nprenatal care, maternal stress, infections, and experiences of racism [18]. These factors, however, only\npartially explain racial/ethnic disparities in infant mortality [19].\nThe risk of premature birth is particularly heightened among women with a previous premature\nbirth, multiple pregnancy, cervical or uterine abnormalities, and certain lifestyle factors. The number\nof African American women with LBW infants (less than 2500 g) is nearly two-fold compared to white\nwomen. Recent reports link LBW with a number of adverse health outcomes later on in children's\nlife, including low cognitive performance, learning disabilities, lower height-for-age, and increased\nrisks of mortality and/or morbidity [20\u00ad24]. Numerous epidemiological studies have identified key\ncontributing factors, such as maternal age, parity, weight gain, smoking, premature birth (less than\nWhile the increasing rate of pregnancy-related mortality is alarming, severe maternal morbidities\nare 50 times more common [17]. Rates of racial and ethnic disparities in maternal morbidities were\nthree to four times higher for African American women than for White, Hispanic and Asian American\nwomen [18]. Known risk factors for severe maternal morbidities included increased maternal age,\nself-pay or Medicaid coverage, low socioeconomic status, and preexisting chronic medical conditions.\nAfrican American women who become eligible for Medicaid due to pregnancy often have delays in\nseeking prenatal care or have difficulty finding providers who accept Medicaid. It is well documented\nthat women who do not receive or begin prenatal care after the first trimester have an increased risk\nof pregnancy-related complications compared to women who receive timely prenatal care [12]. If an\nAfrican American woman is uninsured or enters pregnancy with chronic medical conditions, the risk\nof pregnancy-associated morbidity is increased.\nThe majority of women of reproductive age in the United States are overweight or obese [19],\nwith African American women having an increased risk of obesity [15]. Obesity is associated with\na variety of adverse pregnancy complications including cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes, and\npreeclampsia [19]. Interestingly, low socioeconomic status (SES) is not associated with increased\nmaternal morbidities among African American women. These risk factors only partially explain\nthe disparities in maternal morbidities in African American women [18]. When African American\nand White women present with the same comorbidities (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, asthma, human\nimmunodeficiency virus), African American women fare worse in pregnancy than White women [15].\nBruce et al. [20] found that the five most common maternal complications were urinary tract infections,\nanemia, mental health conditions, pelvic and perineal complications, and obstetrical infections.\nCompared to other racial and ethnic groups, African American women have a greater proportion of\npregnancies that were associated with at least one of these complications.\nThe underlying causes of the disparities in pregnancy-related morbidities and mortalities are\ncomplex and have proven difficult to unravel. While many individual risk factors associated with\npoor pregnancy-related outcomes are known, the complex spatial/temporal nature of the relationships\nbetween health outcomes, environmental exposures and population level disparities are not yet well\nunderstood. Environmental factors that have been previously identified include characteristics about\nhealth care providers, access to a timely, culturally competent prenatal care, and exposures found in\nthe natural, built, social, and policy domains [26]. Though significant progress has been made, some\ngaps still persist in pregnancy-related morbidities and mortalities literature partly because many of the\nfactors are interwoven, complex, and poorly understood. Besides, most studies on pregnancy-related\nmorbidities and mortalities have relied heavily on hospital administrative data and do not assess\nclinical, environmental exposures, or systems level factors or account for complications that are treated\nFigure 1 provides a conceptual exposome framework for understanding adverse birth outcomes.\nThis framework consists of the external and internal exposome domains, health outcomes and risk\nfactors, and analytical tools, methods, and strategic goals for revealing novel patterns and insights.\nAlthough a number of recent studies have been conducted in this emerging exposome area, there is\nstill little information on geographically-integrated health measures. In this study, we have reviewed\ngenetic factors that are specific to the internal exposome domain or are reported to be associated with\npreterm birth, reduced head size, infant birthweight, and premature birth. Non-genetic factors that\nmake up the external exposome domain and are specific to this application include, health outcomes,\nhealth behaviors, clinical care, socioeconomic, policy and programs, and the physical environment.\nThe framework, which combines exposome, the use of GIS and spatial analysis, spatiotemporal\nmodels, computational and traditional statistical analytics, is applied to study the complex relationships\nof LBW across U.S. counties. The framework addresses the total life span of individuals in relation to\ntheir exposure and offers a better way to examine contributory factors, and thus may provide new\ninsights. The objective of this paper is to assess geographic variation and role of environment on the\nburden of LBW among women for the purpose of developing targeted public health interventions\nto decrease disparities. We used spatiotemporal models to identify counties in the 48 contiguous\nUSA where observed LBW rates were higher than expected during a five-year study period. This\nwas conducted using a retrospective space-time analysis scan for statistically significant clusters in\ncounties with high or low rates by a Discrete Poisson Model. The findings from this study could be\nused to develop targeted, public health interventions to decrease disparities. The findings can also\nserve as a basis for designing multilevel culturally-situated interventions to address ethnic disparities.\nInterventions that incorporate geographic parameters provide a more promising approach and will\nyield geographically targeted, optimal control and preventive strategies to reduce ethnic disparities in\npregnancy-related morbidities and mortalities.\ngeographically targeted, optimal control and preventive strategies to reduce ethnic disparities in\npregnancy-related morbidities and mortalities.\nFigure 1.

The downloaded datasets\nwere processed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA, USA) and ArcGIS 10.2.2 (ESRI\nInc., Redlands, CA, USA). Descriptive and confirmatory statistical analyses were done using the\nsame software packages. But the ordinary least square (OLS) models were generated using IBM SPSS\nVersion 22 (SPSS Inc.; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) and the spatiotemporal models were created using\nSaTScan (developed jointly by Kulldorff M., Boston, Massachusetts and Information Management\nServices, Inc., Silver Spring, MD, USA). The best OLS and spatiotemporal regression models were\ncreated after conducting a comprehensive screening and exploratory analysis of 47 variables of interest\n(see Table 1). All diagnostic statistics were analyzed for all the models, including model fitness and\ncollinearity results.\nModeling the relationship between low birthweight and contributory factors followed a two-step\nprocess. The first step was the development of six OLS models. In the second step, we used Kulldorff's\nretrospective Space-Time Statistics to determine whether high or low rates of LBW were randomly\ndistributed in the United States over space and time. For all of these models, we assumed that LBW\nreported at county-level in the 48 contiguous USA (3109 counties) was dependent on the 47 predictor\nvariables during the study period.\nWe constructed five regression models for each year (2010\u00ad2014) to explain the link between LBW\nand predictor variables. Each of the reduced models had between 12 and 17 predictor variables that\nwere influential. Consequently, 17 predictor variables were used to create the overall regression model\nfor LBW for the entire period. Upon compilation and synthesis of the model results, we determined\nthat only nine influential predictors consistently explained LBW outcomes in all five of the models that\nwere created. Using this new knowledge, we developed two retrospective spatiotemporal models for\nLBW outcomes.\n3. Results\nTable 2 gives the OLS model outputs for LBW and the most influential predictors, with some\nbeing statistically significant at each time point. The best overall model yielded an R2 of 0.705 based\non backward stepwise regression criteria. The R2 results for each of the years were quite close to one\nvalue and fitness statistics for the overall model. Nine influential predictors were temporally consistent\nand able to explain LBW variations in all the five models. These predictors included ambulatory care\nsensitive conditions discharge rate, teen births rate, percent of adults 18\u00ad64 without insurance, percent\nof adults that report BMI  30, mentally unhealthy days per month, age-adjusted years of potential life\nlost rate, percent of white, percent of Native Americans, and percent of Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.\nTable 1.

Overall, the main areas of concern with elevated risk of\nLBW were identified in the southern and mid-western regions of the United States, it is especially\npronounced in the counties of Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, Arkansas, Tennessee, South\nCarolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Virginia, New Mexico, Texas, and Colorado.\nDemographically, the racial/ethnicity composition of counties with elevated LBW risk comprises 65%\nwhite, 17% African American, 10% Hispanics, and 8% others. However, these counties also have the\nlargest proportion of African Americans (i.e., about 67% of the total population of African Americans\nin the 48 contiguous state).\nFurthermore, we identified three trajectories of LBW outcomes during the spatiotemporal\nmodeling process (Figure 2). The first trajectory was observed between 2011 and 2014, this trajectory\nwas associated with higher rates of LBW outcomes and was present in all the counties; the second\ntrajectory was observed between 2010 and 2013, this trajectory was associated with lower rates of LBW\noutcomes and was present in all the counties except south Texas and counties that lie at the intersection\nof New York and Connecticut state boundaries; and the last trajectory was a set of outliers observed\nbetween 2010 and 2012, this trajectory represented counties with lower rates of LBW outcomes. These\nwere identified in counties in south Texas (mostly Hispanics) and counties lying at the boundaries of\nNew York and Connecticut states.\n4. Discussion\nFor this study, LBW was used as a proof of concept to apply GIS and spatial analysis,\nspatiotemporal models, and traditional statistical analytics to an external exposome. The county-level\npredictive measures of LBW offers new insights into spatiotemporal patterns relative to key\ncontributory factors. The findings in this study provide further evidence and are consistent with\nprevious studies that have identified socioeconomic [29\u00ad35], behavioral [36\u00ad38], and environmental\nfactors [39\u00ad43]. By means of our external exposome approach, we observed that LBW rate was more\nstrongly associated with 17 variables. We consistently observed the influence of nine predictors in\nall the five models (ambulatory care sensitive conditions discharge rate, teen births rate, percent of\nadults 18\u00ad64 without insurance, percent of adults that report BMI  30, mentally unhealthy days per\nmonth, age-adjusted years of potential life lost rate, percent of White, percent of Native Americans, and\nPercent of Hawaiian or Pacific Islander). In some of the years, there were notable variations suggesting\nthe changing influence of some of the predictors. However, after accounting for place as an explanatory\nvariable, we identified LBW associations with five socioeconomic variables (teen births rate, percent of\nadults 18\u00ad64 without insurance, percent of adults that report BMI  30, mentally unhealthy days per\nmonth, and percent of adults who smoke) in two counties (Greene and Henry Counties in Alabama);\nall the counties identified with higher than expected LBW rates were also significantly associated with\ntwo environmental quality variables (ozone and fine particular matter).\nIt was evident from the county-level health measures that the southern portion of the United States\nhas consistently experienced poor pregnancy-related outcomes during the study period spanning from\n2010 to 2014. The spatiotemporal models provide further evidence of LBW hotspots and are driven by\na mixture of key socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental factors. Furthermore, the profiles of\ntwo counties with statistically significant spatiotemporal clusters of LBW were consistent with prior\nAlabama's Health Disparities Status Report of 2010, the disparity has worsened from 82% higher in\ncomposition of Greene County consists of 86% African Americans; while, the composition of Henry\nCounty is 31% African American. Both of the counties are situated in the rural part of Alabama, where\nmany hospitals lack basic health care services such as obstetrical services (Alabama Department of\nPublic Health Annual Report 2013). Greene County was ranked last in the state health report due to\npoor health indicators. In this report, Greene County's low weight births increased from 9.4 percent in\nWithin the south, we recommend place-based targeted interventions to prevent and control\npregnancy-related morbidities and mortalities with the target being low income, unmarried, African\nAmerican women. We believe such intervention measures will have an effect of a set of socioeconomic,\nbehavioral, and environmental factors and improve pregnancy-related health outcomes. In addition,\nwe recommend efforts to prevent and control identified risk factors should be implemented before and\nduring pregnancy, because there are likely to have an impact on perinatal health outcomes.\nIn spite of the key insights derived from this study, there are some limitations that must be\nrecognized because there is no prefect model. First, some of the measures in this study are derived from\neither objective or subjective reports. Second, health behavior measures are not adjusted in the county\nranking data. There are other concerns that are related to temporal misalignment; large units may\nmask differences within areas; and small numbers problem. In the future, as more accurate secondary\nlongitudinal data becomes readily available, we expect to use it to refine our spatiotemporal models.\n5. Conclusions and Implications\nThe causes of pregnancy-related morbidities and mortalities are numerous and include a broad\narray of factors from across multiple environmental domains. The development of a multi-level,\nmulti-dimensional surveillance system is needed to increase our understanding of the broad array of\nrisk and protective factors associated with pregnancy-related morbidities and mortalities.\nThe external exposome approach and tools provide a theoretically agnostic, data driven model\nthat holds considerable promise as an alternative to traditional, discipline-specific, hypothesis-driven\nmodels for understanding health disparities. It supports both data-driven and hypothesis-driven\napproaches, and can be used both to generate and to test hypotheses. An external exposome\napproach offers new ways for conceptualizing the underlying causes of health disparities and the\nbiological pathways through which environmental exposures affect human development and health.\nBy incorporating spatial and temporal dimensionalities, an external exposome framework provides\na data structure that accommodates a life span approach, a cumulative risk model, and extended\nperiods between exposure and expression and detection of a disease. Furthermore, an external\nexposome approach is able to incorporate methods and analytics from various disciplines and can\nhandle multiple types of data with varying spatial and temporal dimensions. This approach holds\nconsiderable promise in unraveling the complex nature of health outcomes and disparities data.\nThe multi-dimensional nature of this approach can support a broad array of analytics including\npredictive modeling, simulation, Bayesian networks, and structural equation modeling, which can\nbe used to produce network of hypotheses concerning factors that might be manipulated to improve\npregnancy-related disparities.\nAn exposome framework has implications for identifying populations at greatest risk for health\ndisparities and for increasing our understanding of the underlying molecular pathways through\nwhich environmental exposures affect human health and development and result in disparities at a\npopulation level. It holds great promise for the deployment of place-based, targeted interventions that\nare responsive to local risk factors that underlie protracted disparities in pregnancy-related morbidities\nand mortalities and other diseases. While this paper uses county level data to describe the link between\nhealth outcomes and external exposome, the approach can be readily scaled spatially and temporally\nto address other units of analysis (e.g., neighborhoods). Applying an external exposome approach can\nassist in developing and targeting interventions to those at greatest risk.\nFuture Directions\nThis analysis will be applied to three other pregnancy-related [32] morbidities and mortalities\n(infant mortality rates, maternal mortality, and prematurity) in future studies. While data presented in\nthis paper are cross-sectional in nature, we are currently working on methods to apply this general\napproach to the analysis of longitudinal data. In addition, we will continue to expand and harmonize\nadditional datasets to incorporate into the current model. This line of research should help unlock the\nexplanatory and predictive power of innovative methods such as those we have discussed here.\n"
