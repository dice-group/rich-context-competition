Increasing use of antipsychotics in adult anxiety disor-\nders may have a similar effect.12\nA comparison is presented of nationally representative\nsurvey data from adult and youth visits to office-based phy-\nsicians. The analyses focus on trends and patterns of an-\ntipsychotic treatment. Prior to conducting these analyses,\nwe predicted that the increase in the proportion of physi-\ncian visits with a prescription of antipsychotic medica-\ntionswouldbemorepronouncedforyouthsthanforadults.\nMETHODS\nData were obtained from the National Ambulatory Medical Care\nSurvey (NAMCS).32 The NAMCS, which is conducted annu-\nally by the National Center for Health Statistics, samples a na-\ntionally representative group of visits to physicians in office-\nbased practice. Following National Center for Health Statistics\nrecommendations, data from contiguous survey years were com-\n66.1%.33 For each visit, the treating physician or member of the\nphysician's staff provided information about patient sociode-\nmographic and clinical characteristics, as well as the medica-\ntions prescribed or supplied to the patient.\nDIAGNOSIS\nDiagnoses were made according to the International Classifi-\ncation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. For the\nanalysis of trends in antipsychotic use stratified by age groups,\nvisits were grouped by occurrence of mood, anxiety, and psy-\nchotic disorders. In the analysis that compares the character-\nits were classified by diagnoses of schizophrenia and related\npsychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, de-\nvelopmental disorders or mental retardation, disruptive behav-\nior disorders, and other mental disorders (eTable, http://www\n.archgenpsychiatry.com).\nVisits in which psychotropic medications were either sup-\nplied or prescribed were classified into 5 medication groups:\nantipsychotic medications, which are the primary focus of the\nanalyses; stimulants and other attention-deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder medications; antidepressants; anxiolytics/hypnotics;\nand mood stabilizers. The antipsychotic medication group ex-\ncluded prochlorperazine edisylate and promethazine hydro-\nchloride because they are commonly used for nonpsychiatric\nindications. Anxiolytics/hypnotics included benzodiazepines\nand nonbenzodiazepine sedatives and anxiolytics. Mood sta-\nbilizers included lithium carbonate or lithium citrate, carba-\nmazepine, divalproex sodium/valproate sodium/valproic acid,\nand lamotrigine. All antidepressants including those such as\nbupropion hydrochloride, duloxetine hydrochloride, and tra-\nzodone hydrochloride, which are also used for non\u00admental\nhealth indications, were included.\nData were collapsed into 3 nonmutually exclusive categories: (1)\nprivate insurance such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield and other com-\nmercial insurance; (2) public insurance, including Medicare,\nMedicaid, and other government insurance; and (3) a residual\ncategory (\"self-pay/other\") that combined patients with self-\npayment, no charge, workers compensation, those whose source\nof insurance was unknown, and those who received uncompen-\nsated care. In visits with more than 1 source of payment, assign-\nment was hierarchical, with visits assigned to private, public, and\nself-pay/other insurance groups in descending order.\nOne or more antipsychotics have been approved for schizo-\nphrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, autistic\ndisorder, Tourette syndrome, and major depressive disorder\nwhen coprescribed with an antidepressant. In the following\nanalysis, FDA-approved visits include only those visits with a\ndiagnosis for which the specific prescribed antipsychotic had\nbeen approved by the visit year for the age of the patient. This\ndefinition recognizes the substantial within-class heteroge-\nneity in safety34 and efficacy35 that exists among antipsychotic\nmedications and is consistent with the FDA's approach of drug\nindication approval at the level of individual drugs.\nVisits were also classified by patient sex, patient race/ethnicity\n(white, non-Hispanic, or other), specialty of the treating phy-\nsician (psychiatrist or nonpsychiatrist), and whether psycho-\ntherapy was provided by the physician at the visit.\nPopulation-based proportions and associated 95% CIs of office-\n(0-13 years) visits with antipsychotic treatment (hereafter re-\nferred to as antipsychotic visits) were determined for the time\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association.

A study period variable was defined for each\ncome of interest is the odds of an antipsychotic across the en-\nnotes twice the odds that a visit included an antipsychotic at\nperiod. Separate regressions were constructed for each level of\nvisit characteristics of interest. For example, one regression as-\nsessed the odds of antipsychotic visits over the study period\nfor male visits and a separate regression for female visits. An\ninteraction term was added to each regression to assess whether\ntrends in antipsychotic use significantly differed across these\ngroups. The P values associated with these interaction terms\nare presented in Tables 3 and 4.\nwas used to compare the background and clinical character-\nistics of antipsychotic visits for children, adolescents, and\nanalysis compared the clinical characteristics of youth and\nadult antipsychotic visits by specialty of the treating physi-\ncian (psychiatrist vs nonpsychiatrist). The frequency distri-\nmonly prescribed antipsychotics in each age group was also\ndetermined.\nAnalyses were adjusted for visit weights, clustering, and strati-\nfication of data using design elements provided by the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics. When adjusted for these ele-\nments, survey data represent annual visits to US office-based\nphysicians.37 Analyses were conducted using SUDAAN soft-\nware (Research Triangle Institute), all analyses were 2 sided,\nand  was set at .05.\nRESULTS\nOn a per capita basis, office-based antipsychotic visits\nincreased among all 3 age groups but were consis-\ntently more prevalent for adults than for adolescents\nand were least prevalent for children (Table 1). During\nantipsychotic visits per 100 adults was significantly\ngreater for female than male patients, while the reverse\nwas true for children (Table 2). For adolescents and\nadults, but not children, the corresponding proportion\nof antipsychotic visits was significantly greater on a\nper population basis for white non-Hispanics than for\nthe other racial/ethnic group.\nTable 1.

Not surprisingly, schizophre-\nnia, bipolar disorder, and depression accounted for a\nconsiderably larger percentage of adult than child anti-\npsychotic visits, while disruptive behavior and develop-\nmental disorders accounted for a greater proportion of\nchild than adult antipsychotic visits. Visits without a men-\ntal disorder diagnoses accounted for roughly one-third\nof adult antipsychotic visits. In a post hoc analysis, 96.5%\nof the adult antipsychotic visits without mental disor-\nders were to nonpsychiatrist physicians, and 33.7% in-\ncluded a quetiapine fumarate prescription (data not\nshown).\nTable 3.

Mood stabilizers were\nprescribed in roughly one-quarter of adolescent and adult\nantipsychotic visits, but only about 1 in 10 child anti-\npsychotic visits (Table 5).\nOnly a small proportion of child and adolescent an-\ntipsychotic visits included an FDA clinical indication\n(Table 5). For child antipsychotic visits without an FDA\nindication, the 3 most common specific mental disorder\ndiagnoses were attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\nruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified (10.5%).\nThe corresponding diagnoses for adolescent antipsy-\nchotic visits were bipolar disorder not otherwise speci-\nfied (14.9%), anxiety disorder not otherwise specified\n(12.6%), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\n(11.4%), and, for adults, the 3 most common diagnoses\nin antipsychotic visits without an FDA indication were\nanxiety disorder not otherwise specified (17.7%), de-\npression not otherwise specified (10.9%), and bipolar dis-\norder not otherwise specified (10.3%) (data not shown).\nAn evaluation by physician specialty revealed that,\ncompared with visits to psychiatrists, visits to nonpsy-\nchiatrist physicians by youths and adults that included\nantipsychotic medications were more likely not to in-\nclude a mental disorder diagnosis. As a result, antipsy-\nchotic visits to psychiatrists were far more likely than those\nto nonpsychiatrists to include several specific mental dis-\norder diagnoses. For example, a significantly larger per-\ncentage of youth and adult visits to psychiatrists than non-\npsychiatrists included a bipolar diagnosis. As compared\nwith antipsychotic visits to psychiatrists, antipsychotic\nvisits to nonpsychiatrists were also significantly less likely\nto be for an FDA-approved indication.

Com-\npared with children and adolescents, adults make a sub-\nstantially larger number of per capita office-based visits\nthat include antipsychotic prescriptions. Increasing an-\ntipsychotic use by adults has also been reported from sev-\neral other industrialized countries, although trends among\nyouths have not been studied outside the United States.38\nWhen considered in the narrower context of US office-\nbased care, antipsychotic treatment has increased more\npsychotics were prescribed in roughly equal propor-\ntions of youth and adult visits to psychiatrists. Yet im-\nportant differences exist in antipsychotic use across age\ngroups. Although antipsychotic treatment of adults is con-\ncentrated among female patients and patients diag-\nnosed with bipolar disorder, depression, or schizophre-\nnia, antipsychotic treatment of children and adolescents\npredominantly involves male patients and is common\namong patients with disruptive behavior disorders.\nMost of the youth and adult antipsychotic visits did\nnot include a diagnosis for which the antipsychotic had\nFDA approval for the patient age group. The strength of\nevidence supporting efficacy for these \"off-label\" condi-\ntions varies considerably across psychiatric disorders and\nindividual antipsychotics.18 Almost two-thirds of child\nbehavior disorder diagnosis, and there are currently no\nFDA-approved medications for the treatment of disrup-\ntive disorders. Across all child visits during this period,\nrisperidone was by far the most commonly prescribed an-\ntipsychotic. Uncertainty surrounds the appropriate role\nof risperidone and other antipsychotic medications in the\nTable 5.

Al-\nthough some have urged greater caution in the treat-\nment of disruptive behavior disorders with antipsy-\nchotic medications given their uncertain effects on\ncognitive, social, and physical development,39 others note\nthat risperidone tends to be well tolerated and benefi-\ncial for conduct disorder and other disruptive behavior\ndisorders, particularly when there are problematic ag-\ngressive behaviors.40,41 Randomized clinical trials pro-\nvide evidence of efficacy in the treatment of aggressive\nyouths with subaverage intelligence,41-43 although dis-\ncontinuation related to lack of continued efficacy may\nbe considerable over the longer term.43\nAntipsychotic treatment in youth mood disorder vis-\nits increased especially rapidly during the study period.\nmostly for bipolar disorder, were more likely than their\nadult counterparts to include an antipsychotic medica-\ntion. This pattern is consistent with pooled analyses in-\ndicating that the effect size of antipsychotics for bipolar\nmania, especially compared with mood stabilizers, is larger\nfor youths than adults.44 The trend in the prescribing of\nantipsychotics to youths occurred within the context of\na dramatic increase in the clinical diagnoses of bipolar\ndisorder among young people.11,45 Concern exists, how-\never, over the accuracy of community diagnoses of bi-\npolar disorder in children and adolescents.46,47\nA greater proportion of adult antipsychotic visits than\nchild or adolescent antipsychotic visits do not include a\ndiagnosed mental disorder. This is largely attributable to\nthe proportionately greater role of nonpsychiatrist phy-\nsicians in the treatment of adults with antipsychotics than\nin the treatment of young people. Nearly all of the adult\nantipsychotic visits without mental disorder diagnoses\nwere provided by nonpsychiatrist physicians. Primary care\nphysicians and other nonpsychiatrists sometimes delib-\nerately mask their patients' mental health problems to\nminimize stigma, to prevent adverse legal or occupa-\ntional consequences associated with seeking mental health\ntreatment,48 or to capture more health plan benefits than\nwould be available by providing mental health treat-\nment.49 Because patient and physician identities are pro-\ntected in the NAMCS, however, deliberately withhold-\ning mental disorder diagnoses from the survey data is\nunlikely to be widespread. The considerable degree to\nwhich antipsychotics are prescribed to adults and, to a\nlesser extent, young people without concomitant psy-\nchiatric diagnoses calls for further examination. It is pos-\nsible that some of these patients have been treated with\nantipsychotic medications for an extended period of time\nand that, at the time of the survey visit, they were expe-\nriencing few psychiatric symptoms. Because the survey\nform captures only up to 3 diagnoses per visit, it may also\nnot enumerate all mental disorder diagnoses. Alterna-\ntively, some physicians may prescribe quetiapine or other\nantipsychotics for insomnia,50 agitation,51 or other symp-\ntoms that do not rise to the threshold of a mental disorder.\nResearchonracial/ethnicvariationinantipsychotictreat-\nment has largely, but not exclusively,52 focused on pa-\npresent findings offer a somewhat broader perspective on\ntrends in antipsychotic use by white and nonwhite pa-\nTable 6.

This pat-\ntern is consistent with evidence that adult African Ameri-\ncans and Hispanics are less likely than white adults to find\npsychotropic medications acceptable.59,60 The roughly par-\nallel increase in antipsychotic use among nonwhite youths\nand white youths during the study period is broadly con-\nsistent with research indicating that the race/ethnicity of\nadultsisnotstronglyrelatedtotheirwillingnesstogivepsy-\nchiatric medications to their children.61,62\nSeveral factors may account for the increase in anti-\npsychotic treatment within office-based practice. One fac-\ntor may be the availability of new antipsychotics, includ-\ndone (2006), during the study period. Food and Drug\nAdministration approval of antipsychotics to treat bipo-\nlar disorder, schizophrenia, and irritability associated with\nautistic disorder in youths, as well as various FDA ap-\nprovals of adult indications, may also contribute to the\nincrease in antipsychotic treatment. Clinical trials40 and\nclinical practice guidelines63 supporting antipsychotic use\nfor youths outside of FDA-approved indications may have\nencouraged antipsychotic treatment of young people. The\npreviously mentioned increase in the community diag-\nnosis of bipolar disorder in young people, as well as in-\ncreasing diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders,64,65 may\nhave also played a role. Furthermore, lower rates of acute\nand chronic extrapyramidal adverse effects with second-\ngeneration antipsychotics compared with first-\ngeneration antipsychotics66 may also have increased the\ngeneral ease of prescribing antipsychotics to vulnerable\npediatric patients, even despite generally greater weight\ngain and metabolic risk with the newer agents.9,17 The\nproliferation of behavioral managed care67 and the at-\ntendant limitations on psychotherapy reimbursement68\nmay further shift practice toward psychopharmacologi-\ncal management.69 Cultural factors may also be at work,\nincluding a lessening of the stigma associated with men-\ntal health care, which is especially pronounced among\nyoung adults,70 and greater public acceptance of psycho-\ntropic medications.60 Pharmaceutical marketing,71 in-\ncluding the promotion of off-label use,72 likely also con-\ntributes to community antipsychotic prescribing practices.\nFinally, some patients may respond but not remit to evi-\ndence-based treatments, and, as a result, physicians en-\ndeavor to achieve remission by using antipsychotics as\nTheseanalyseshaveseveralimportantlimitations.First,\nthe NAMCS samples visits rather than patients. Because\nan unknown quantity of patient duplication occurs and\nbecause patients may make several visits to several phy-\nsicians each year, it is not possible to derive from the sur-\nvey data an estimate of the number of unique people who\nare treated in office-based practice with antipsychotic\nmedications each year. However, because each physi-\ncian is randomly assigned to 1 of 52 weeks in the survey\nyear, this duplication is likely to have only a limited ef-\nfect on national estimates of unduplicated visits. Sec-\nond, diagnoses in the NAMCS are based on the indepen-\ndent judgment of the treating physician, rather than\nresearch diagnostic interviews. Some primary care phy-\nsicians may rely on diagnoses made by psychiatrists or\nother mental health specialists. Third, information is not\navailable concerning dosages and duration of the anti-\npsychotic medications. Dosages of antipsychotics for\nyouths with disruptive behavioral disorders are likely to\nbe considerably lower than that for youths with schizo-\nphrenia and other psychotic disorders.75 In addition, some\npatients with FDA-indicated disorders may receive sub-\ntherapeutic antipsychotic doses.76 Fourth, physician non-\nresponse may have biased the observed pattern of anti-\npsychotic prescribing. Fifth, sample size limitations\nconstrain efforts to evaluate the independence of asso-\nciations between patient characteristics and provision of\nantipsychotic treatment. Sixth, since 2009, several de-\nvelopments, such as the approval of new antipsychotics\nperidone [2010]), labeling revisions strengthening the\nmetabolic risk section regarding hyperglycemia and dia-\nbetes, dyslipidemia, and weight gain, and new practice\nguidelines,77 may have influenced antipsychotic prescrib-\ning patterns. Finally, the sample is restricted to office-\nbased visits and therefore does not capture visits to com-\nmunity mental health centers, hospital outpatient clinics,\nor various other outpatient settings, nor does it capture\nvisits to inpatient settings where mental health care is pro-\nvided. In 2009, for example, there were approximately\n54.8 million total antipsychotic prescriptions in the United\nwere from office-based settings included in the NAMCS\nscope. For these reasons, the population-based results\nshould not be interpreted as representing population-\nwide antipsychotic use.\nIn summary, over a 17-year period, antipsychotic medi-\ncations became more commonly used in office-based prac-\ntice. The increase, which has been broad-based, has been\nespecially concentrated among children and adolescents,\nparticularly among youths diagnosed with mood disor-\ndersandthosetreatedbynonpsychiatristphysicians.Asub-\nstantial majority of child antipsychotic visits are for young\npeoplediagnosedwithdisruptivebehaviordisorders.Inlight\nof known safety concerns and uncertainty over long-term\nrisks and benefits, these trends may signal a need to re-\nevaluate clinical practice patterns and strengthen efforts to\neducatephysicians,especiallyprimarycarephysicians,con-\ncerningtheknownsafetyandefficacyofantipsychoticmedi-\ncations. At the same time, a new generation of clinical trials\nis needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of antipsy-\nchotic medications in conditions for which they are com-\nmonly prescribed but for which the evidence base re-\nmains underdeveloped.\nCorrespondence: Mark Olfson, MD, MPH, Department\nof Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons of\nColumbia University, New York State Psychiatric Institute,\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Wang had full access to all of\nthe data in the study and takes responsibility for the in-\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association.
