Little regard has been given to the contribution of 100% FJ to diet quality.\nMethods: In this study data from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to\nexamine the association of 100% FJ consumption with diet quality in participants 2-5 years of age (y) (n = 1665),\nusual intake using the National Cancer Institute method. Usual intake, standard errors, and regression analyses\n(juice independent variable and Healthy Eating Index-2005 [HEI-2005] components were dependent variables),\nusing appropriate covariates, were determined using sample weights.\nwas associated with higher energy intake in 6-12 y, 13-18 y, and 19+y; and higher total, saturated, and discretionary\nfats in 13-18 y participants. Consumption of 100% FJ was associated with higher total HEI-2005 scores in all age\ngroups (< 0.0001). In 100% FJ consumers, total and whole fruit consumption was higher and intake of added sugars\nwas lower in all age groups.\nConclusions: Usual intake of 100% FJ consumption exceeded MyPyramid recommendations for children 2-5 y, but\nwas associated with better diet quality in all age groups and should be encouraged in moderation as part of a\nhealthy diet.\nBackground\nConsumption of fruit is associated with a variety of\nhealth benefits including an improved profile of cardio-\nvascular disease markers [1], and a reduced risk of\nhypertension [2] and some types of cancer [3]. Despite\nthese health benefits, few Americans consume the\nrecommended amounts of fruit per day [4-6]. The\nMyPyramid recommendations for fruit consumption are\nage, gender, and physical activity specific [7]. Recom-\nmendations range from 1 cup/day for children 2-3 years\nof age (y) to a maximum of 2.5 cups/day for physically\nactive young males. The fruit requirement can be met\nby consuming whole fruit\u00adfresh, frozen, or dried, or\n100% fruit juice (FJ); although the Dietary Guidelines\nAdvisory Committee (DGAC) recommended that only\n1/3 of the recommendation should be met through\n100% FJ to encourage fiber intake [8]. The American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that for chil-\nday, and for older children/adolescents, 7 to 18 y, to\ntwo 6-oz servings of juice per day [9].\nRecommendations for consumption of 100% FJ by\nchildren, however, continue to be debated due to con-\ncerns about consumption and a potential link with over-\nweight/obesity.

Studies of weight\nand 100% FJ consumption have been primarily in chil-\ndren since they are the principal consumers. Few studies\nhave looked at 100% FJ consumption and weight in\nadults [21-23], but there is less concern than in children.\nWhat is often overlooked in the on-going debate\nabout 100% FJ and weight and the uncertainty of how\nmuch, if any, should be consumed, is the nutrient con-\ntribution of 100% FJ to the diet. One hundred percent\nfruit juices are nutrient dense [24] and are low in total\nfat, SFA, and sodium. One hundred percent fruit juices,\nespecially grape, cranberry, pineapple, and orange juices,\nare high in phytochemicals [25]. They also contain a\nwide array of micronutrients, including vitamins A (par-\nticularly in the form of beta-carotene) and C, folate,\npotassium, and magnesium. The 2010 DGAC recognized\nvitamins A, C, D, and E; phosphorus; magnesium; potas-\nsium; and dietary fiber [26] as shortfall nutrients, and in\naddition, potassium and dietary fiber were nutrients of\npublic health concern. Calcium was also a nutrient of\npublic health concern for children and adolescents 9 to\n18 y, and possibly for younger children aged 4 to 8 y, as\nwell as for adults [26]. For adolescents (and women) of\nchildbearing potential, folate was also identified as a\nnutrient of special concern [26].\nPrevious studies of children 2-11 y [15] and adoles-\nbetter nutrient intakes and higher intakes of whole fruit\nthan those that did not consume 100% FJ. Although the\nassociation between 100% FJ intake and nutrient intake\nhas been established in nationally representative sam-\nples, assessment and comparison of diet quality of 100%\nFJ consumers versus non-consumers is lacking. The pur-\npose of this study was to compare the diet quality of\n100% FJ consumers with non-consumers in a nationally\nrepresentative population.\nMethods\nData collection\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) is conducted on a continual basis by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention. One of the major\nobjectives of NHANES is to examine the relationship\nbetween diet, nutrition, and health [27]. Details regard-\ning the survey design, content, operations and proce-\ndures are available online [28].\nStudy population and dietary intake\ninto four age groups and then further dichotomized as\nconsumers and non-consumers of 100%FJ as follows:\ntwo 24-hour dietary recalls administered using an auto-\nmated multiple-pass method [29,30]. The first was\nobtained at the original interview (Day 1) and the sec-\nond (Day 2) was obtained several days later via tele-\nphone. Parents/guardians provided the 24-hour dietary\nrecalls of children 2-5 y; children 6-11 y were assisted\nby an adult; all others provided their own recalls. Only\nrecall data deemed complete and reliable by the USDA\nFood Surveys Research Group were included in the ana-\nlyses. Pregnant or lactating females (n = 711) were\nexcluded from the sample. Detailed descriptions of the\ndietary interview methods are provided in the NHANES\nMEC In-Person Dietary Interviewers Procedures Man-\nual, which includes pictures of the Computer-Assisted\nDietary Interview system screens, measurement guides,\nand charts used to collect dietary information [31]. Due\nto the nature of the analysis (secondary data analysis),\nand the lack of personal identifiers, this study was\nexempted by the Institutional Review Board of the\nLouisiana State University Agricultural Center.\nDetermination of 100% FJ and nutrient intake\nTwo survey-specific food composition databases were\nused to determine the foods consumed by NHANES\nparticipants. The USDA Food and Nutrient Database for\nDietary Studies (FNDDS) v. 2.0 [32] was used to deter-\nNHANES survey foods, and the FNDDS v. 3.0 [33] was\nused to determine the nutrient content of foods con-\nIn this study, 100% FJ was defined according to the\nFederal Food and Drug Administration [34], which\nmeans that the juice was squeezed directly from fruit\nand that the words \"100% juice\" were included on the\nlabel. Products reconstituted from concentrate with\nwater were also considered 100% FJ, although their label\nmust have included the words \"reconstituted\" or \"made\nfrom concentrate.\" Juice cocktails, juice punches, juice\ndrinks, or juice beverages were not considered as fruit\njuice in this study, although they contain some juice\n[34]. Participants were dichotomized into consumers\nand non-consumers of 100% FJ. Further, the amount of\n100% FJ consumed was compared with the MyPyramid\nrecommendation that 100% FJ should not account for\nmore than 1/3 of total fruit intake per day, which is\nequivalent to the following amounts in cups (c) per total\nHealthy eating index\nThe Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2005) was used to deter-\ncomponents that reflect the recommendations of the\n2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Dietary intake is\nexpressed per 1000 kilocalories for all components\nexcept SFA and sodium, which are fixed recommenda-\ntions. The maximum possible score on the index is 100.\nThe first six components (i.e., total fruit; whole fruit;\ntotal vegetable; dark green, orange vegetable and\nlegumes; total grain; and whole grain) were scored from\n0 to 5 points. The next five components (i.e., milk, meat\nand beans, oil, SFA, and sodium) were scored from 0 to\n10 points; and the last component of solid fats, alcoholic\nbeverages, and added sugars (SoFAAS) were scored\nfrom 0 to 20 points. Scores were calculated proportion-\nally, except for SFA and sodium; for these components,\nscores were prorated linearly between 0 to 8 and 8 to\n10 points (8 and 10 points represented acceptable and\noptimal levels, respectively) [36]. Data files used to\ncalculate HEI-2005 scores were downloaded from\nthe USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion\nStatistical analyses\nThe National Cancer Institute (NCI) method was used\nto estimate usual intake of selected nutrients and for\nHEI-2005 total scores and subcomponent scores. The\ntwo days of intake, using first day sampling weights,\nwere used to obtain necessary variance estimates. The\nNCI SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) macros Mixtran\nv.1.1 and Distrib v.1.1 were used to generate parameter\nestimates after covariate adjustment and to estimate the\ndistribution of usual intake via the Monte Carlo method,\nrespectively. Covariates for these analyses were sequence\nof participant's intake (Day 1 or Day 2) and a variable\nfor weekday/weekend consumption. Differences among\n100% FJ consumers and non-consumers were deter-\nmined by computing population Z statistics generated\nfrom usual intake variables.\nRegression analyses were conducted using the sin-\ngle 24-hour recall data (Day 1) to determine the\ncontribution of nutrients per ounce of 100% FJ con-\nsumption. Covariates for the regression analyses were\nage, gender, race-ethnicity, and socioeconomic status\n(using poverty income ratio). Differences in beta coeffi-\ncients were determined and p < 0.05 was deemed\nsignificant. For all analyses study-specific dietary four-\nyear sample weights [38] were used to adjust the var-\niance for the complex sample design of NHANES\nusing the statistical package SUDAAN (version 9.0.3\n[2007] Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle\nPark, NC).\nResults\nConsumption of 100% fruit juice\nThe percentage of individuals consuming 100% FJ varied\nPer capita usual intake of 100% FJ (oz) among the four\ntively.

Reasons\nfor the high prevalence of 100% FJ consumption in chil-\ndren may include participation in the Women, Infants,\nand Children (WIC) Program by young children [39]\nsince 100% FJ is a WIC authorized food in three of the\nfood packages for children over 11 months of age [40].\nParticipation in the National School Lunch or Breakfast\nProgram by older children [41] may also lead to con-\nsumption of 100% FJ since these are approved menu\nitems, and is the only juice product that may be served\nin the National School Breakfast Program [42]. It is also\npossible the frequency of consumption is lowest in ado-\nlescents since they are the least likely age group to con-\nsume breakfast [43] and 100% FJ is thought of as a\nbreakfast food by many consumers. Adolescents who\nparticipate in the National School Lunch program also\nhave more beverage options than elementary school\nchildren [44] have and may not choose 100% FJ.

This study showed that the\nusual intake for children 2-5 y exceeded these recom-\nmendations. Further studies are needed to assess the\nhealth effects of consuming higher than recommended\nlevels of 100% FJ, and whether consuming whole fruit\nwithout 100% FJ provides an advantage to consumers.\nRecommendations for 100% FJ consumption vary; thus,\ncaretakers and consumers may be confused and efforts\nshould be made to reconcile the recommendations\nusing an evidence-based approach.\nMyPyramid recommendations were established, in\npart, to encourage fiber intake since modeling studies by\nthe USDA showed that when 100% FJ was replaced by\nwhole fruit, fiber intake increased by nearly 37% [8].\nRegression analysis did show a modest, but significant\ncontribution of fiber to the diet from 100% FJ in all but\nthe youngest age group. That there was no difference in\nfiber intake between 100% FJ consumers and non-\nconsumers suggests that other foods were contributing\nfiber to the diet. Usual fiber intake was, however, below\nthe Institute of Medicine's recommendations [46] in all\nage groups in 100% FJ consumers and non-consumers\nand foods rich in fiber should be encouraged.\nThe rationale for the AAP recommendations for 100%\nFJ consumption in children and adolescents is not com-\npletely clear, but is in part based on one study that\nshowed an association of 100% FJ consumption and over-\nweight in pre-school aged children [10]. Although con-\ncerns about overweight/obesity and consumption of\n100% FJ appear unfounded [20], it is important to con-\nsume 100% FJ with other foods while maintaining energy\nbalance. Paradoxically, in all age groups except children\n2-5 y, the group that consumed the most 100% FJ, energy\nwas higher in 100% FJ consumers. The relationship of\nweight and 100% FJ consumption was not examined in\nthis study.\nPrevious studies have shown that children [15] and\nadolescents [16] also had higher intakes of total fruit and\nadolescents had higher intakes of citrus, melons, and ber-\nries. These studies have not been conducted in adults.\nMoreover, studies have not examined the effect of 100%\nFJ intake on overall diet quality. The HEI-2005, used to\nassess diet quality, was revised to reflect the 2005 Dietary\nnents of the MyPyramid eating plan, including grains/\nwhole grains, fruit/fruit juice, variety in vegetable and fat\ntypes, non/low fat dairy, sodium, and discretionary cal-\nbeen used with a single 24-hour dietary recall [48], but\nrecently it was shown that it could also be used when\nmultiple recalls were available [49].\nThe HEI-2005 scores for this population were lower\n[50]. However, the overall scores of those consuming\n100% FJ were significantly higher than those not con-\nsuming juice. Consumption of 100% FJ improved total\nHEI-2005 scores in all age groups; by choosing to con-\nsume this single food, the HEI-2005 score improved\nscores calculated in this study both with and without\n100% FJ consumption were still low and needed\nimprovement.\nConsumers of 100% FJ also had improved intake of\nwhole fruit. When assessing consumption levels, many\nstudies have combined the intake of fruit and vegetables;\nhowever, those studies reporting fruit separately have\nshown that children, adolescents, or adults [4-6,51] did\nnot meet the fruit recommendation. Data from the\nhighest percentage (12.3%) of those meeting the fruit\nrecommendation; only 8.6% of adult males met the\nrecommendation [4]. For both genders, the median\nTable 5 Distribution of HEI-2005 total usual intake (UI) scores among 100% FJ consumers and non-consumers by age\nabUsual HEI-2005 means with different superscripts within age groups are significantly (p < 0.05) different. Abbreviations: y, years; n, number; UI, usual intake; SE,\nstandard error.\nnumber of servings consumed was 0.61 per day [4].\nOverall consumption was lowest in pre-adolescent, ado-\nlescent, and young adult males [5]. Despite extensive,\ncoordinated public health campaigns by government\nand industry [52], fruit consumption remains low. Con-\nsumption of 100% FJ appears to be one way to increase\nfruit intake; however, the goal should be to encourage\nintake of all types of fruit.\nOne concern about consumption of 100% FJ in chil-\ndren and adolescents is that it may replace fluid milk in\nthe diet [53]. Regression analyses showed that there was\nno difference in the HEI-2005 Milk component score\nbetween consumers and non-consumers of 100% FJ.\nThis supports findings from previous studies that con-\nsumption of 100% FJ was not associated with lower con-\nsumption of milk in the diets of children [15,16].\nThis study did show that in adolescents 13-18 y con-\nsumption of 100% FJ was also associated with higher\nintake of total, saturated, and discretionary fats. Reasons\nfor this are not clear, but may reflect the overall poor\neating habits reported in this age group [43,54]. Addi-\ntional studies are needed to determine factors leading to\npoor diet quality in adolescents.\nLimitations\nNHANES is a cross-sectional study, thus cause and\neffect relationships cannot be determined. Participants\nrelied on memory to self-report dietary intakes; there-\nfore, data were subject to non-sampling errors, including\nunder- or over-reporting of energy. Parents reported or\nassisted their children 2-11 y with the 24-hour recalls;\nparents often report accurately what children eat in the\nhome [55] but may not know what their children con-\nsume outside the home [56], which could also result in\nreporting errors [57].\nConclusions\nThis study showed that, with the exception of children\n2-5 y, usual intake of 100% FJ was within the MyPyra-\nmid recommendations for children, adolescents, and\nadults, and the AAP recommendations for children and\nadolescents. Among consumers, all age groups exceeded\nMyPyramid recommendations for 100% FJ consumption.\nConsumption of any amount of 100% FJ was associated\nwith improved diet quality in all age groups. Due to its\ncontribution to overall diet quality, 100% FJ should be\nrecommended to all age groups as a component of a\nhealthy diet.\nAbbreviations\nAAP: American Academy of Pediatrics; FNDDS: Food and Nutrient Database\nDGAC: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee; MEC: Mobile Examination\nCenter; NHANES: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; SoFAAS:\nSolid fats, alcoholic beverages, and added sugars; USDA: United States\nDepartment of Agriculture; WIC: Women, Infants, and Children.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is a publication of the United States Department of Agriculture\n(USDA/ARS) Children's Nutrition Research Center, Department of Pediatrics,\nBaylor College of Medicine, and Houston, Texas.
