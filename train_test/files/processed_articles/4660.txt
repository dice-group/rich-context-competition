    "abstract": "Abstract\nA growing literature examines the effect of corruption on political behavior. However, little attention has been paid so\nfar to the fact that politicians engage in it for various reasons and with different welfare consequences. In this article, I\nargue that voters judge corrupt politicians differently depending on what the money is used for. I show results from a\nsurvey experiment in India in which respondents heard about a politician who accepted money for a political favor. One\ntreatment group was told that the politician used the money to personally enrich himself (personal corruption), while\nthe other group was informed that he used it to buy votes (electoral corruption). Respondents who received the vote\nbuying treatment were clearly and consistently less likely to agree with a series of potential punishments. This suggests\nthat the overall welfare consequences of corrupt exchanges are an important factor when voters decide how to judge\noffending politicians.\nCarlos III\u00adJuan March Institute, Spain\nCorresponding author:\nSimon Weschle, Carlos III - Juan March Institute, Calle Madrid,\nEmail: sweschle@inst.uc3m.es\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nwith a series of potential punishments. The welfare conse-\nquences of corrupt exchanges thus are an important factor\nwhen voters decide how to evaluate offending politicians.\nThis can help explain the central puzzle of the literature,\nnamely that corrupt incumbents are often treated with leni-\nI also show that the differences between the two treatments\nare larger among wealthier respondents, even though they\nare less likely to benefit from vote buying efforts. This sug-\ngests that the effect is not necessarily driven by narrow self-\ninterest, but instead by a sociotropic evaluation of the\noverall welfare consequences of personal and electoral cor-\nruption among parts of the electorate.\nThis article contributes to the literature on the effect of\ncorruption on political behavior, which so far has mainly\nfocused on how environmental factors condition voters'\nresponses to corrupt politicians. For example, studies dem-\nonstrate the impact of information (Chong et al., 2015; Ferraz\net al., 2010), the state of the economy (Klasnja and Tucker,\nZizumbo-Colunga, 2013), political partisanship (Anderson\nclarity of responsibility (Tavits, 2007), and the level at which\ncorruption is experienced (Gingerich, 2009; Klasnja et al.,\n2016). I complement the literature by drawing attention to\nthe fact that the welfare consequences of corrupt exchanges\nmatter as well.3 The article therefore is also part of a recently\nemerging literature that disaggregates corruption and special\nThe paper relates most closely to two recent observa-\ntional studies. Manzetti and Wilson (2007) find that support\nfor governments perceived as corrupt among World Values\nSurvey respondents is negatively related to the strength of\ngovernment institutions. This is interpreted as evidence that\nvoters in countries with strong patron\u00adclient relationships\nare more likely to support corrupt politicians, since they\nexpect to receive tangible benefits. However, countries\nwith low institutional strength differ from those with high\nstrength in many other ways than their level of clientelism.\nMore directly, Fern\u00e1ndez-V\u00e1zquez et al. (2016) examine\nthe reelection probabilities of Spanish mayors involved in\ncorruption scandals. They show that only representatives\nwhose corrupt dealings had no welfare enhancing conse-\nquences (e.g. embezzlement) saw a decrease in their reelec-\ntion probabilities. If there were positive side benefits for\nvoters (e.g. jobs through licensing illegal construction pro-\njects), there was no punishment. One worry with such an\nobservational study is that politicians may select the type of\ncorruption they engage in strategically, for example based\non characteristics of the electorate.4 I contribute to this line\nof inquiry by providing direct experimental evidence of the\nmicro-level mechanisms behind these findings, net of any\npotential confounders.\nThe article also speaks to contributions showing that\nvoters tend to tolerate corruption when the offending poli-\ntician delivers good results otherwise (Klasnja and Tucker,\ntrast to these \"implicit exchange\" accounts, I provide evi-\ndence for a more explicit exchange that involves the usage\nof money obtained from a corrupt transaction itself.\nFinally, my findings are relevant for the literature on clien-\ntelism, and in particular for the debate about its welfare\nconsequences. Clientelistic competition is not considered a\nnormative ideal and has many negative effects (e.g.\nwhere the state provides few public goods, these payments\nare one of the only tangible benefits that especially poor\ncitizens get from the political system (Auyero, 1999;\nGonzalez Ocantos et al., 2014). I show evidence that\nvoters do indeed recognize that clientelism has certain\nwelfare-enhancing effects.\nSurvey experiment design\nIn this article, I focus on India, a country which currently\nInternational's Corruption Perception Index and 130th out\nof 189 in the World Bank's ease of doing business ranking.6\nIt is widely acknowledged that political corruption is very\nKapur and Vaishnav, 2011). Furthermore, as the examples\nabove make clear, it happens for several reasons. Many\npoliticians use their tenure in office to enrich themselves\n(Fisman et al., 2014). But election campaigns are increas-\ningly costly, with clientelistic expenditures making up a\nlarge part of the tab. Candidates need to invest considerable\nresources to be serious contenders (Gowda and Sridharan,\nting to investigate the impact of corrupt money for personal\nenrichment versus vote buying.\nThe survey experiment for this study was conducted as\npart of a larger survey in the National Capital Territory of\nDelhi in January 2014. Respondents were selected from the\nvoter roll in a multi-step process. First, 10 of 70 assembly\nconstituencies in Delhi were chosen randomly. Second, five\npolling stations from each constituency were sampled.7\nFinally, for each polling station, 20 voters were selected\nfrom the official electoral roll published by the Chief\nElectoral Officer of Delhi.8 They were assigned to one of\ntwo treatments in alternating order.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Personal Enrichment Treatment: Imagine a politi-\ncian who received money from a company for a\npolitical favor. He used this money to personally\nenrich himself. What do you think the consequences\nshould be?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Vote Buying Treatment: Imagine a politician\nwho received money from a company for a\npolitical favor. He used this money to buy votes in\nan election. What do you think the consequences\nshould be?\nBoth prompts are formulated in a neutral manner. In\nparticular, the vote buying one does not stress who the\nrecipients are or what benefits they receive. Instead, it sim-\nply refers to vote buying, which is illegal under Indian law,\njust like personal enrichment in exchange for a political\nfavor. Note that I use a fictional rather than a real politi-\ncian. While this comes with the downside of greater\nabstraction, previous research shows that pre-existing atti-\ntudes such as partisanship affect how much punishment\nvoters exert for the same corruption offense. This is likely\nalso true for ethnicity or, in the Indian context, caste. To\nabstract from these specifics, experimental studies of cor-\nruption typically ask respondents to evaluate fictional poli-\nticians, and I follow this convention.\nAlso note that the experiment does not have a control\ncondition asking about a corrupt politician without giving\nany information about what the money was used for. The\nexperiment thus cannot tell us whether the personal enrich-\nment and vote buying treatments differ from a generic cor-\nruption allegation. But as the examples mentioned above\nindicate, corruption cases are rarely generic. They are usu-\nally discovered based on irregularities resulting from how\nthe illegal money is used, so there are reports about politi-\ncians who increase their personal assets while in office, or\nwho call in favors to engage in vote buying. In addition to\nnot corresponding to many real-world situations, a generic\ncorruption allegation would also introduce the amount of\ninformation a respondent receives as a second condition\ninto the experiment. Because the goal is to tease out the\neffect of personal versus electoral corruption, I focus on\ncomparing two conditions that hold constant the amount of\ninformation given.\nAfter receiving the treatment statements, participants\nwere presented with three punishments.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A politician who took money for political favors to\n[buy votes/enrich himself] should have to resign\nfrom his position.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A politician who took money for political favors to\n[buy votes/enrich himself] should be banned from\ncontesting future elections.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A politician who took money for political favors to\n[buy votes/enrich himself] should be sentenced to\ntime in jail.\nFor each statement, respondents were asked whether they\nagreed completely, agreed, neither agreed nor disagreed,\ndisagreed, or disagreed completely. In addition to this\nexperimental treatment, the survey asked about a number\nof political issues and included a standard battery of demo-\ngraphic questions. Interviews were conducted face-to-face\nin Hindi by trained interviewers of a Delhi-based polling\ncompany. If a sampled voter was unavailable, a replace-\nment in the same locality and of the same gender and age\ngroup was selected. In total, 993 interviews were com-\npleted. The sample is balanced for most variables, with two\nsmall exceptions.9 To ensure that they do not drive the\nresults, I account for them in various ways below.\nFinally, it is important to note the context the survey was\nconducted in. In December 2013, the month before the sur-\nvey, an anti-corruption party called the Aam Aadmi Party\nsuccessfully competed in state elections for the Delhi\nassembly. The party gained almost 30 percent of the votes.\nIt subsequently formed a minority government, which\nthat the survey experiment was conducted while an anti-\ncorruption party was in power. Corruption therefore prob-\nably had a higher than average salience among its\nrespondents. This makes it likely that they condemn corrupt\npractices more than would be the case in another place or at\nanother time. But since the focus here is not on how much\nvoters disapprove of corrupt politicians, but instead on\nwhether their disapproval differs depending on what the\nmoney was used for, this should not limit our ability to\ndraw inference.\nAnalysis\nAs an initial step, I treat the respondents' answers to the\nthree questions as continuous going from one (agree com-\npletely) to five (disagree completely). The first thing to\nnote is that tolerance for politicians who accept special\ninterest money for political favors is low, no matter how it\nis used. Most respondents agree or agree completely that a\npolitician who engages in such behavior should be pun-\nished. The means in the entire sample are 1.43 (the politi-\ncian should resign), 1.54 (the politician should be banned\nfrom contesting future elections), and 1.48 (the politician\nshould be jailed). This was expected given the location and\ntiming of the survey during the administration of an anti-\ncorruption party.\nTable 1 shows the means of the two treatment groups\nfor the three response variables. Despite the high overall\ndisapproval of corruption, the means are consistently\nsmaller for respondents who were given the personal\nenrichment treatment compared to those who received the\nvote buying treatment (a lower number means more sup-\nport for punishment). On the scale from one to five,\nrespondents who received the personal enrichment treat-\n(resign) points more supportive of punitive measures.\nThese differences are significant at conventional levels,\nboth when using uncorrected p-values as well as when\naccounting for multiple hypothesis testing using\nBenjamini\u00adHochberg corrections. Put the other way\naround, people are more tolerant of politicians accepting\n4 Research and Politics \nmoney in exchange for political favors when it is distrib-\nuted to the population in an attempt to buy their support.\nOf course, it is not clear that the response variables can\nbe treated as continuous. Figure 1 shows the share of\nrespondents who agree completely with the punishment\nstatements for the personal enrichment treatment (gray) and\nthe vote buying treatment (white). Again, it is apparent that\nthere is widespread disapproval of the politician's behavior.\nHowever, the share of respondents agreeing completely\nthat he should resign, be banned, and be jailed is consist-\nently larger for those who received the personal corruption\ntreatment. These differences are statistically significant at\nconventional levels (see Table 2 in the Online Appendix).\nBecause there are slight imbalances between the two treat-\nment groups, I also estimate a series of regressions that control\nfor demographic variables. Table 2 shows the coefficient of\nthe vote buying treatment from Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)\nspecifications with controls, constituency fixed effects, and\nstandard errors clustered by polling station. The coefficients\ncan be interpreted as the differences in means between the two\ntreatments, controlling for demographic and constituency\neffects. Their magnitudes are actually larger than when look-\ning at the raw differences, ranging between 0.178 (jail) and\n0.285 (resign). In the Online Appendix, I present a series of\nadditional model specifications as robustness checks. I also\naccount for the imbalances in the treatment assignment groups\nby pre-processing the data using matching. In all cases, and for\neach dependent variable, the coefficient of the vote buying\ntreatment is positive and significant at conventional levels.\nThe fact that voters are more lenient with vote buying\npoliticians begs the question what the reason behind this\nfinding is. Is it driven by the egocentric self-interest of vot-\ners who usually are among the beneficiaries of clientelistic\npolitics? Or is it because voters think about the sociotropic\nwelfare consequences for society as a whole? Table 3\nshows the effect of the two treatments separately for\nrespondents in the lower and upper income halves. Because\nvote buying efforts primarily target the poor (e.g. Stokes,\nincome half are less likely to benefit personally from it.\nNevertheless, they are consistently more lenient with the\nvote buying candidate. Respondents in the lower income\nhalf, however, are only significantly less punitive for the\nvote buying politicians when it comes to the mildest form\nof punishment (resignation). For the other two punish-\nments, the differences between the treatments are smaller\nand not significant. This suggests that the effect is not nec-\nessarily driven by narrow self-interest. Instead, it mainly\ncomes from wealthier (and more educated) respondents\ndifferentiating the overall societal welfare consequences\nof personal and electoral corruption.10\nConclusions\nOne of the main advances in the study of corruption in\nrecent years has been the disaggregation of the catch-all\nconcept. Scholars now distinguish between bureaucratic\nand political corruption, petty corruption and grand corrup-\ntion, personal and electoral corruption, and so on. Not only\nare these conceptually distinct (e.g. Bussell, 2013;\nwelfare consequences. The survey experiment presented\nhere contributes to this line of inquiry. It shows that voters\nare less willing to punish politicians engaging in a corrupt\nexchange if its proceeds are then \"shared\" with the wider\nelectorate. This can help explain the central puzzle that\nmotivates the literature, namely why voters frequently ree-\nlect incumbents they know to be corrupt (Golden, 2010;\nIn future research, it will be necessary to replicate the\nsurvey experiment in different contexts to determine its\nempirical scope. Are voters generally more tolerant of vote\nbuying, or are there situations where they are not? How\ndoes the magnitude of the effect differ, especially between\ndifferent income levels? More broadly, (illegally) provid-\ning favors in exchange for money used to buy votes or for\npersonal enrichment are only two ways in which special\ninterest money enters politics. Others include (legal)\nTable 1. Differences in means for the three dependent variables between the two treatment groups.\nVariable Vote buying Enrichment Difference Std.

What are their\nwelfare consequences, and how do voters evaluate politi-\ncians engaged in them? Answering these questions will fur-\nther advance the growing literature on different types of\ncorruption as well as the study of its effects on political\nbehavior. Ultimately, this will help us understand when vot-\ners punish corrupt politicians, and when they give them a\nfree pass instead.\nAcknowledgements\nFor their helpful comments and suggestions, I am grateful to\nLorena Becerra, Pablo Beramendi, Pablo Fern\u00e1ndez-V\u00e1zquez,\nDaniel Gingerich, Karen Remmer, Michael Ward, Erik Wibbels,\nas well as the editors and anonymous reviewers at Research and\nPolitics.

This has been accompanied by a surge in research\nexamining how corruption affects political behavior (cf.\nKlasnja et al., 2016). Studies show that factors such as\ninformation, the economy, and partisanship influence the\ndegree to which voters punish corrupt politicians. But law-\nmakers who engage in corruption do so for various rea-\nsons. Take the example of India, where politicians who\nbecome rich while holding office are not hard to find.\nAmong the most high-profile cases are the former telecom-\nmunications minister A. Raja, who is accused of accepting\nmillions of dollars in bribes, and the Chief Minster of\nTamil Nadu, Jayaram Jayalalitha, who was convicted for\nillegally amassing \"disproportionate assets\" in excess of\n$10 million over five years in office.1\nBut money from corrupt transactions is also used in\nother ways: \"Parties and candidates tend to use their term of\noffice to accumulate war chests for future elections and for\nnursing their constituencies. There is evidence that they\nraise these resources through any means available, includ-\ning through corrupt means such as kickbacks for regulatory\nand allocative favors while in office.\" (Gowda and\ntry to buy votes by distributing cash, liquor, and small gifts\n2007). This has certain welfare consequences: an article in\nBloomberg View calls Indian general elections a \"quasi-\nKeynesian boost (...) rich with multiplier effects from\nboardroom to tea shop.\"2\nDo voters judge politicians who engage in corruption\ndifferently depending on what they use the money for? In\nthis article, I present evidence that this is indeed the case. I\nshow results from a survey experiment conducted on a rep-\nresentative sample of voters in Delhi, India. Respondents\nwere asked about a politician who accepted money for a\npolitical favor. One treatment group was told that the politi-\ncian used this money to personally enrich himself (personal\ncorruption), while the other was informed that he used it to\nbuy votes (electoral corruption). Respondents were then\nasked how much they supported different punishments the\npolitician could face. Those who received the vote buying\ntreatment were clearly and consistently less likely to agree\nPunishing personal and electoral\ncorruption: Experimental evidence\nfrom India\nSimon Weschle"
