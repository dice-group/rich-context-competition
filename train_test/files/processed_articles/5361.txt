On the other hand, those delivering support in\nvoluntary sector projects had to work harder to establish and maintain relationships with other\nagencies, but their independence was seen to be greater and this was perceived as a strength for\ngaining access to victims and maintaining their confidence.

It is no longer the case that the only support\nservices for victims are found in community-based voluntary sector organizations, such\nas Rape Crisis. Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs) are now available in many\nareas to facilitate additional support to victims of sexual violence. A SARC aims to\nprovide an accessible, multi-agency, forensically secure, one-stop-shop provision for\nvictims.1 Similar programmes, known as SARTs (Sexual Assault Response Teams),\nhave been set up in the USA(Cole, 2011). The first SARC was established in Manchester\nin 1986, and they have since become `the largest expansion of statutory services for\nvictims of rape in contemporary history' (Lovett et al., 2004: vii).\nConsequently, attention to sexual violence at local, regional and national levels of\ngovernment has increased, as has the level and range of services available, although, as\nwill be seen in this article, perhaps not to the extent wished for by those providing direct\nservices to the women, men and children affected by sexual violence. The study\npresented in this article examines the strengths and limitations of two different types of\nsettings: Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs) and other projects located in the\nvoluntary sector2 that provide specialist support to victims of sexual violence. Ultimately,\nour evidence suggests that these two approaches provide different, yet complementary,\nresponses to the many types of victims requiring support, and thus both are needed if the\nBritish approach is to be considered both adequate and comprehensive.\nLiterature Review\nResponding to need\nRecent changes in service provision for victims of sexual violence are a direct response\nto the unremitting negative attention given to the performance of criminal justice\nagencies in dealing with offences of rape and sexual violence in recent years (HM\nGovernment, 2010). For example, it was noted in the Government's Action Plan for\nWhile the number of rapes reported to the police and recorded has increased substantially over\nrecent years, there has been barely any increase in the number of convictions. The conviction\nrate is less than 6% for recorded offences of rape, significantly lower than for other serious\nThere are a number of factors that make rape cases difficult to progress successfully\nthrough the criminal justice system (for a summary see, for example, Feist et al., 2007;\nKelly et al., 2005). A common factor identified in research is the high rate of attrition,\nwith most cases being lost at the reporting or investigation stages because victims do not\nwant to proceed. This may be due to a lack of trust in agencies, shame and embarrass-\nment, fear of not being believed or feeling a conviction is unlikely and/or fear of and\nRobinson et al., 2011). Evidently, such considerations are still clearly warranted today\ngiven the recent failings of the London Metropolitan Police in two separate serial rape\ncases (John Worboys and Kirk Reid). In both cases, the victims were routinely disbe-\nlieved and their evidence discredited, indicating that even a large police force that has\npioneered much good practice in the investigation of sexual offences can still fail to give\nvictims proper information or support (HM Government, 2010).\nSuch poor treatment by the police (and other statutory agencies, for example, health)\nclearly fails to provide a victim-centred approach (Martin, 2005). Indeed, there is ample\nresearch supporting the notion that their handling of such cases often `re-victimizes'\nvictims and has thus been referred to as `the second assault'(Campbell, 1998; Campbell,\nand Holmes, 1981). Certainly our understanding of the consequences of sexual violence\nshows us that victims `live and relive the event' (Martin, 2005: 3) to the extent that their\nlives can be defined as a traumatic on-going survival process (Jordan, 2008). It therefore\nbecomes imperative that victims receive responsive treatment, where their needs are\nprioritized (HM Government, 2010) in order to help make the transition from victim to\nModels of service provision\nConcern over existing practice has changed the range and type of support available to\nvictims of sexual violence. Most notably, there has been the introduction and expansion\nof Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs) to provide a range of immediate, short- and\nlonger-term support and assistance to victims of sexual violence. Over the same period,\nhowever, there has not been a similar development and support of specialist rape and\nsexual violence services located in the voluntary/third sector, prompting concern over\nthe long-term organizational and financial stability of these projects. Both of these\nmodels are discussed in more detail below.\nThe SARC model of providing assistance to victims of sexual violence promotes\npartnership working, across relevant agencies, in responding to victims. This `one-stop-\nshop' model of service provision attempts to counteract criticism highlighted\nby criminal justice inspectorates and the media (HM Government, 2010; HMIC and\nHMCPSI, 2007) by acknowledging the importance of multi-agency partnerships and col-\nlaborative efforts with respect to improving criminal justice performance.3 For example,\nSARCs involve a partnership approach between the police and health services, and good\nliaison with other statutory and voluntary agencies in order to provide better support and\ncare to victims (Lovett et al., 2004; Robinson et al., 2008). This in turn is expected to\nimprove their confidence and subsequently their participation with the Criminal Justice\nSystem (CJS). There are currently 29 SARCs in operation throughout England and\nWales, and the Government has committed to having one in every police force area by\nWhile the SARC model has been adopted by the Home Office to provide assistance\nto victims of sexual violence, there are of course other projects that provide services to\nvictims. These are community-based, voluntary sector organizations that have historically\noffered women-only services, such as Rape Crisis Centres (Jones and Cook, 2008). These\nprojects tend to support women who have been raped or suffered sexual abuse from men\nknown to them, perhaps some time ago, and which may not have been reported to the\nauthorities. In contrast to SARCs they are not formally affiliated with police or other\nstatutory services (although they may work in partnership with such agencies). Like\nSARCs, however, they are premised on the idea of believing women and respecting their\nconfidentiality and autonomy (Jones and Cook, 2008; Robinson et al., 2008). The impor-\ntant role played by voluntary projects such as Rape Crisis in helping victims overcome the\ntrauma of sexual violence, and in getting sexual violence recognized as a significant social\nproblem, cannot be overstated. Indeed, they can be seen to have laid a foundation of\nprofessional and impactful service provision that has informed the ideological and\noperational principles of SARCs. In recent years the number of Rape Crisis Centres in\nsee Jones and Cook, 2008; Women's Resource Centre (WRC), 2008). Perhaps even more\nworrisome has been the lack of long-term funding to maintain stability in this sector, a\nproblem exacerbated by the introduction of SARCs, which can increase the number of\nreferrals received by voluntary projects in a particular area (Survivors Trust, 2010).\nPromoting advocacy:The role of ISVAs\nAlong with the expansion of SARCs, there also has been an increasing recognition of the\nimportance of providing advocacy and support to victims of sexual violence (HM\neffectiveness of providing victim advocates within other settings (Cook et al., 2004;\nand Bybee, 1999; Vallely et al., 2005), for example Independent Domestic Violence\nAdvisors (IDVAs), and resulted in the Home Office's decision to provide funding and\nassistance to test the utility of a new type of specialist support worker to assist victims of\nsexual violence: the Independent Sexual ViolenceAdvisor (ISVA). Drawing on the IDVA\nmodel of service provision, ISVAs provide individual victims with information, advice,\nsupport and guidance that is specifically tailored to their needs as victims of crime. For\nexample, ISVAs are expected to provide crisis intervention and non-therapeutic support\nfrom time of referral, information and assistance through the CJS if requested; provide\nother types of practical help and advice; and, work with partner agencies to ensure co-\nordinated service planning on behalf of individual victims. Their remit is to help victims\nmake the transition to survivor, independent of any other organizational mandates\n(Robinson, 2009). However, while their priority is to attend to the needs of the victim,\nthere is the expectation that the support they offer will reduce their fear and uncertainty\nover the criminal justice process and encourage their participation. Since 2006, ISVAs\nhave been viewed as key workers in both SARCs and voluntary sector projects.\nMethods\nThis article draws upon data from a larger study looking at how ISVA services were\nimplemented in SARCs and voluntary projects (see Robinson, 2009).4 Information from\ninterviews and visits in six case study sites between October 2007 and March 2008 was\nanalysed to compare the advantages and limitations of delivering support to victims of\nsexual violence in different workplace settings. The six sites were chosen to provide a\nrange of different locations and contexts with which to study the delivery of support to\nvictims of sexual violence. This included three SARCs and three voluntary projects:\n\u00b7 Sites 1 and 2: SARCs with specialist support workers (ISVAs);\n\u00b7 Sites 3 and 4: Voluntary projects with specialist support workers (ISVAs);\n\u00b7 Site 5: A SARC without ISVAs; and,\n\u00b7 Site 6: A voluntary project without ISVAs.\nAtotal of 93 interviews were conducted with workers in sexual violence projects (SVPs);\nreferral/partner agencies (RPAs); and victims/survivors of sexual violence (VS). Direct\nquotations from the interviews are denoted as `SVP', `RPA' or `VS', followed by the site\nnumber (e.g. RPA2).\nWhile the qualitative aspect of this research attempted to provide several important\ncontrasts (e.g. SARC versus voluntary project), these were made across a very small\nsample of projects. Given that the total number of sexual violence projects in England\nand Wales exceeds 100, it is acknowledged that this is a small number of case studies,\nand one that does not encompass all of the different services and models of advocacy that\nare operational in the UK, or indeed that may be possible.\nThe qualitative data were therefore complemented by quantitative monitoring data\nfrom 35 sexual violence projects in England and Wales (including the six case study\nsites). This was used to give an indication of the types of clients being referred to SARCs\nand voluntary sector projects, and from where; the nature of the offences committed\nagainst them; the services provided in SARCs, the services provided by ISVAs in volun-\ntary projects; and criminal justice outcome information. Unfortunately, the data were not\nequally distributed between SARCs and voluntary projects as eight of the 35 projects\nfor analysis. This was predominantly due to the recording practices in both settings as\nwell a higher annual caseload within the SARCs studied (see Robinson, 2009).\nA further limitation of the data was that they only reflected the most recent incident\nsuffered by a victim, and not all of the incidents in a victim's history which were being\naddressed by the SARC/voluntary project. No information about the outcomes from access-\ning these services was included, other than criminal justice outcomes. The data collection\nforms could not therefore give a sense of the level of emotional support or the broader range\nof `practical assistance' provided to individual victims receiving support from the projects.\nNational Overview\nDespite the limitations outlined above, the quantitative monitoring data are helpful in\nproviding a national picture of how the two settings differ. The differences between the\ntwo settings are quite pronounced in terms of the characteristics of victims seeking\nsupport, types of offences and the source of referrals (see Table 1).\nThe demographic profile of victims receiving support can be summarized as white\nfemales, generally young, capable of speaking English, with few disabilities. This profile\nTable 1. Clients and sources of referrals, by type of setting\nTotal cases Vol.projects\nAll projects\nClient demographics\nBlack or minority ethnic 11%\nEnglish language difficulties 3%\nDisability (any type) 13%\nCharacteristics of offences\nLocation of offence\nMultiple perpetrators 15%\nType of perpetrator\n Ex-partner or partner 24%\nSource of client referrals\nPolice/criminal justice 19%\nVoluntary/charity 24%\nis similar across voluntary projects and SARCs, with the exception of age. SARCs gen-\nerally had a younger client base than the voluntary projects (56 per cent and 28 per cent\nyounger than 21, respectively). Furthermore, the majority of cases reported to SARCs\nwere committed by strangers and acquaintances (73 per cent combined, compared to 47\nper cent in voluntary projects), whereas more incidents committed by relatives, partners\nand ex-partners were reported to voluntary projects (48 per cent combined, compared to\n25 per cent in SARCs). Voluntary projects also had a more even spread of referrals across\nthe four main referral sources (police/CJS, health, voluntary/charity, self), whereas\nSARCs had the highest proportion coming from police/CJS (80 per cent). This is likely\nto be due to SARCs' affiliation with, and funding from police. Another notable differ-\nence is that voluntary projects had twice the level of self-referrals compared to SARCs\nAlthough comparisons are difficult due to missing data, we know from the case stud-\nies that Sites 3 and 4 (both voluntary sector projects) saw a much higher figure of `his-\ntorical' incidents (offences that occurred during childhood accounted for 38 per cent and\n42 per cent of their client bases, respectively) than did Site 2, a SARC (16 per cent). This\nwas not able to be assessed in the national monitoring data but is likely to be different\nacross settings nationwide. The implications in relation to the services offered to victims\nof sexual violence will be discussed later.\nTable 2 provides the criminal justice information from the national monitoring data,\nrevealing that a much higher proportion of cases in SARCs were reported to the police\n(77 per cent, or 92 per cent excluding missing data). This is perhaps the consequence of\nthe police being the main source of referrals to SARCs. Although conviction rates are\nremarkably similar across both types of settings when viewed as a proportion of cases\ncharged (27 per cent versus 28 per cent), voluntary projects have a higher conviction\nrate as a proportion of cases reported to police (10 per cent versus 2 per cent). Looking\nat the data in terms of case progression within the two types of setting reveals that, on\naverage, 39 cases were reported to each voluntary project, 14 of these resulted in\ncharges and four convictions were obtained. In comparison, the average SARC reported\n269 cases to police which resulted in 15 charges and four convictions. SARCs therefore\nfacilitate more offences coming to police attention, although many of these do not result\nin successful outcomes (from a criminal justice perspective). Conversely, it would seem\nthat voluntary projects are more selective in their reporting, but the ones that do get\nreported are more likely to result in convictions. This type of analysis masks substantial\nvariation within both types of settings so we hesitate to draw firm conclusions about\nhow the type of setting may or may not impact on criminal justice case progression.5\nFurthermore, it is unwise to equate criminal justice performance measures as indicative\nof success from a victim's point of view (e.g. maybe having the courage to report the\ncase was `enough' for one victim, whereas another might be disappointed the case did\nnot go to trial, etc.).\nIn the next section, information from the case studies is used to describe the support\ndelivered to victims of sexual violence that accessed the different sites, highlighting first\nthe main differences in the two approaches, followed by benefits and challenges that they\nshare as specialist service providers to victims of sexual violence.\nThe SARC Model of Service Provision\nAs stated previously, SARCs are a partnership model of service provision which aim to\nco-ordinate medical, legal and advocacy arrangements for victims under one roof. Since\ntheir introduction in 2006, ISVAs are the central point of contact for victims accessing\nservices within SARCs, as they co-ordinate the different services required on their\nbehalf. SARCs can be based within different settings (e.g. police, hospital or other loca-\ntions that are not part of statutory services), but they are closely aligned with police and\nhealth and tend to be based in these types of locations. This is reflected in the staffing\ncontingent at SARCs, which typically includes staff seconded from health (e.g. doctors\nto conduct forensic medical exams (FMEs)), specially trained police (e.g. Sexual\nOffences Liaison Officers (SOLOs)) as well as other specialist workers (e.g. ISVAs or\ncounsellors).\nIn contrast to the national picture, the three SARCs in this study are based in discreet\nresidential locations (although Site 5 has two sites, one in a residential area and the other\nin a hospital). Two are managed by charitable voluntary sector organizations (Sites 1 and\n2) while the other is managed by the police (Site 5). Sites 1 and 2 employ ISVAs. Site 5\ndoes not employ any ISVAs, but instead has counsellors and a Case Tracking Co-ordinator\nPrevious research has documented a number of advantages to delivering services for\nvictims of sexual violence within SARCs leading to the Government's current plan to\nimplement them nationally. For example, in the study of three SARCs (and three com-\nparison areas without SARCs) conducted by Lovett et al. (2004) it was shown that\nTable 2. Criminal justice information, by type of setting\nTotal cases Vol. projects\nAll projects\nCriminal justice information\nReported to police 39%\nPolice classification\nCourt outcome\nSARCs increase access to services and support in a significant number of cases and\nimportantly among those who do not report rape to the police (due to the possibility of\nself-referral). While our data clearly show that a number of victims accessed support\nfrom SARCS by self-referral, the voluntary projects had twice this level. This could be\nattributed to the higher number of historical abuse cases dealt with by the voluntary\nprojects. Given the predominance of police/criminal justice referrals to SARCs, the key\nadvantage of this approach is to provide a location for delivering advocacy and support\nto victims that might not otherwise receive it. Furthermore, SARCs provide victims\nwho have self-referred, and who might be considering reporting a rape, the option to\ntalk to specialist police officers anonymously before deciding what to do.\nFurther advantages of SARCS discussed by Lovett et al. (2004) included a higher\nproportion of cases resulting in examinations and the provision of a range of immediate,\nshort- and longer-term support options to victims. Research has indicated that victims\naccessing SARCs particularly value the automatic provision of female examiners and\nsupport staff; proactive follow-up support; case tracking; advocacy; and easy access\nthrough the telephone to advice and information (Lovett et al., 2004; Robinson et al.,\n2009). The comments made by respondents in our research reinforce many of these find-\nings, particularly on the ability of SARCs to produce a model of service delivery that\nenables a wide range of services to be successfully co-ordinated under one roof.\nImportantly, they provide an interface between two large, bureaucratic systems: health\nand criminal justice.\nNotably, respondents working in the SARC, as well as those from partner agencies,\nfelt that SARCs were not simply putting `old services into a new building', but actually\ndelivering a different, improved experience for victims. In addition, SARCs, like multi-\nagency risk assessment conferences (MARACs) for domestic violence,7 were seen by\nrespondents to be effective mechanisms for getting partnership work started, or\nenhanced, around sexual violence (Robinson et al., 2008). The sustained and pro-\nnounced participation from members of the health service in SARCs is evidence of\nSARCs facilitating a more `joined up'approach across relevant systems. This affiliation\nor indeed integration with statutory partners means that referral routes were clearer in\nsites operating a SARC, as the quotation below from staff working in the SARC in Site\n5 illustrates:\nP62 (SVP5): But what works well is if somebody's being referred in through a police process\nby a SOLO [Sexual Offences Liaison Officer], if that SOLO officer can actually bring them\nhere for that very first appointment, it makes it so much easier for the client as ... making that\nfirst step is the hardest. And that does work very well. And I suppose from the victim's point\nof view it demonstrates the police commitment and the police support to the whole process\nas well.\nThe participation of statutory services is essential for the delivery of the SARC model,\ngiven what SARCs aim to achieve, and indeed many SARCs receive funding and/or are\nmanaged by statutory services (usually police or health). However, staff (including\nISVAs) working in the three SARCs studied here commented on the usefulness of not\nbeing physically based within statutory settings:\nP18 (SVP2): I think the fact that ISVAs are independent from those agencies is really\nimportant ... because the clients don't associate them with those agencies ... so if you were\nto have an ISVA based in hospital or police station it is likely that their duties would get\npulled into other directions, whereas being based in agencies like ours it is easier to resist.\nP63 (SVP5): ... personally I would suggest the best place for an ISVA to be set would be not\nwithin police, health or any other big organization [but in a] charitable organization certainly\nwithin a setting where that person would have the power to help challenge the local authority\nand police and all of those big, big organizations.\nIn summary, the key advantage of SARCs is that services are delivered in a setting\nthat has an inherent multi-agency approach combining the different and complementary\nstrengths of voluntary and statutory agencies into one model of service delivery.\nRespondents in the SARCs studied here commended the fact that, although they may\nhave close working relationships with statutory agencies, they were not housed within\nstatutory settings, as this was felt to have negative implications for their ability to be\nperceived as independent and to challenge the practice of their statutory partners.\nTheVoluntary Sector Model of Service Provision\nVoluntary charitable organizations tend not to be formally affiliated with police or other\nstatutory services, and therefore are not as aligned with criminal justice services com-\npared to SARCs. This is apparent in their referral sources (nationally, less than one in\nfive referrals to a voluntary project come from police or criminal justice agencies; see\nTable 1). The staffing contingent of voluntary projects tends to be smaller compared to\nSARCs, and some operate with the use of volunteers.8 As discussed previously, their\nhistorical legacy is different in that they emerged from a grassroots movement to provide\nspecialist services to victims of sexual violence, whereas SARCs are a government-led\ninitiative that came later. Of the three voluntary projects studied here, two employed\nISVAs (Sites 3 and 4) and one (Site 6) did not. These sites provide a comparison in terms\nof how a less statutory-affiliated organizational context affects the support provided to\nvictims of sexual violence.\nThe key difference to emerge from the qualitative data was the variation in the level\nto which voluntary sector projects were engaged with other local agencies. Crucially,\nthe voluntary sector projects who employed ISVAs (Sites 3 and 4) felt that having an\nISVA in post had raised their ability to engage with, and influence, partner agencies.\nThis was accomplished with a lot of time and effort invested into activities such as\nattending meetings, making presentations and generally making themselves known to\npartner agencies:\nP28 (SVP3): So I think the ISVA project has been fantastic for us and it has been a lever in\ngaining credibility and to actually be commissioned [on] what we provide ... I think before we\nlaunched this ISVA project we were very inward thinking as an agency ourselves ... now I think\nthere is much more of a framework for sharing information so we are up front and honest about\nwho our clients are, what we're doing with them and we liaise more with external agencies.\nMaintaining effective referral processes and working relationships is essential for the\ndelivery of support to victims. Despite the `boost'given to the local standing of voluntary\nprojects employing ISVAs, they were still clearly working in multi-agency partnerships\non sexual violence that seemed less established than those study areas with SARCs.\nOperationally, this can cause difficulties, for example with referrals. Unlike those work-\ning in SARCs, some respondents from the voluntary sector projects felt that their referral\nroutes with police could be improved, as there was concern that not all potential victims\nwere being referred to their projects:\nP27 (SVP3): There are still huge gaps where police officers do not tell people about us ... And\npeople get referred to us quite late. So they might, if the doctor doesn't know about us, they'd\nrefer them to the mental health services, they might wait months and then finally get an\nappointment and then get sent to us. I think it's people's lack of awareness of what's available\nfor their client group really. So the right people aren't being made aware of our service.\nThese concerns were echoed by partner agencies working with voluntary sector projects,\nsome of whom voiced a need for more formalized referrals structures. Compared to\nSARCs, where police are actually embedded into the model of service delivery, the\nvoluntary projects seemed to struggle to get consistent referrals:\nP32 (RPA3): I'd like to see in the police force [for] any type of offence like that ... having a\nstandard tick box or a standard assessment of referring to the ISVA. That needs to be done so\nthat they do get all the type of offences rather than a mismatch of people who know about them\nreferring.\nThe separateness of voluntary projects, while perhaps causing problems such as those\ndiscussed above with referrals, at the same time enabled them to have a degree of inde-\npendence that was highly valued by respondents. Their independence from statutory\npartners was viewed as the key benefit of providing victim support within the voluntary\nsector, which was, on the whole, seen to be more aligned with victims' needs than the\nstatutory sector. Voluntary projects were seen to provide a space where victims could tell\ntheir story without fear of judgement: `I don't think people feel judged by coming here,\nI think people feel accepted, and they might not feel that in a mainstream service [like\nSARCs]' (P27 (SVP3)). For this very reason, some respondents from partner agencies\nalso perceived a greater willingness from victims to access services from a voluntary\nrather than statutory agency:\nP37 (RPA3): Because they are a voluntary agency, it gives them a different standing in the\ncommunity. The statutory agencies are always seen as part of the machine if you like, whereas\na voluntary agency will always be seen as much more of a service I think. I think people are\nmuch more likely to approach a voluntary agency in a time of need rather than an establishment\norganization.\nRespondents from the voluntary sector projects felt strongly that it was necessary to\nhave independence from statutory partners (e.g. police and health) if there was to be\neffective delivery of services to victims of sexual violence. Primarily because it was felt\nthat victims were more likely to self-refer to voluntary sector organizations (and indeed,\nthe national monitoring data indicate a higher proportion of self-referrals to voluntary\nprojects, as shown in Table 1), these settings were often perceived by respondents as\nmore independent than SARCs. Furthermore, those working in SARCs recognized that\nthey had to work harder to gain victims' confidence given their alliance with statutory\nservices:\nP1 (SVP1): I think as well because we work with two strong statutory bodies, being health and\npolice, I think that they were very wary of us first of all. Because we hear a lot of complaints\n[from] people that don't think that they've been treated the way that they should have been\neither by a doctor or by the police. And we can only learn by sharing that information and then\ngrowing from it, so taking it as constructive criticism.\nIt is important to note that these assertions about the lesser independence of SARCs\nshould be substantiated with further research, especially research accessing the opinions\nof victims on this matter. Even if true, as SARCs become more established in some com-\nmunities, and continue to employ workers whose key function is to provide independent\nsupport and advice to victims of sexual violence (ISVAs), this distinction between the\nsettings is likely to fade over time.\nShared Benefits: Multi-Agency Partnership Working\nOne commonality across all of the sites, both SARCs and voluntary projects and regard-\nless of whether they employed ISVAs, was the great value placed on taking a multi-\nagency approach to helping victims of sexual violence:\nP72 (RPA5): I guess partnership working would be key ... because we have such a cohesive\ncommunication strategy with paediatricians, social workers, children and adults services,\nprobation, Crown Prosecution Service, the voluntary agencies. If any agency saw that there was\nsome kind of problem or had an issue or needed to discuss an issue, they would know exactly\nwho to phone up to, and we would resolve things together.\nP87 (SVP6): I think that probably one of the things that I've discovered is [how] important\nnetworking with other organizations [is] ... more networking and more contact between the\norganizations is very helpful.\nThere were many examples of working arrangements that improved multi-agency\npractice around sexual violence. One example of particularly good practice from a SARC\nwas the implementation of formal arrangements whereby performance was regularly\nreviewed, enabling partners across agencies (e.g. the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS),\npolice, staff at SARC) to discuss and learn from the cases with which they had been\ninvolved. The meetings provided a chance for on-going learning, where partners also\ncould reinforce good working relationships and spot problematic issues early on. As a\nresult of these efforts, sites were beginning to experience the benefits of engaging in\nmulti-agency dialogue in ensuring that the victims' perspectives were kept at the centre\nof operational practices.\nThe sites that employed ISVAs benefitted from their ability to deliver institutional\nadvocacy to their multi-agency partners. Institutional advocacy refers to providing sup-\nport and advice to institutions rather than to individuals and is viewed as a key aspect of\nthe ISVA role. It is the process by which partners in multi-agency initiatives learn and\nimprove their practice. Theoretically, ISVAs are uniquely placed to deliver this service\nbecause they have experience working within and across different agencies as they co-\nordinate services on behalf of victims. For example, the following quotation, from a\npolice officer, clearly demonstrates the unique service that the ISVA can provide in facil-\nitating multi-agency partnership work:\nP21 (RPA2): To me it's wonderful, because I can refer people to [ISVA] and she's then got links\nthrough agencies that she partners in, where she can help clients out with all sorts of things,\nfrom housing matters, all sorts of complicated things that previously we were trying to do ...\nAnd by having [ISVA] now it's made things so much better both for us and for the clients,\nwithout any shadow of a doubt.\nIn summary, although partnership work was valued across all settings, it was more\nfirmly in place in those areas with SARCs. Furthermore, regardless of the type of set-\nting, ISVAs helped facilitate better partnership work by virtue of the co-ordinating and\nliaising function of their role.\nShared Concerns: Raising the SexualViolence Agenda\nA challenge raised by many respondents working within the different projects and in\nreferral agencies was the perceived `newness' of local multi-agency work on sexual\nviolence. While they recognized that there had been progress making sexual violence\nmore apparent at a national level (e.g. the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the Government's\nAction Plan on Sexual Violence and Abuse (Home Office, 2007) and Action Plan for\nISVAs, etc.), they also believed that there was still much work to be done at integrating\nsexual violence into local efforts to address crime and disorder.\nStaff in both SARCs and voluntary projects were willing to undertake this work to\ntry and raise the `sexual violence agenda' in their local areas. Despite these efforts, a\nwidespread belief remained among those working in the six areas studied here that there\nwas a relative lack of attention to sexual violence \u00ad from partner agencies, government,\nthe public \u00ad and this impacted on the ability to secure funding, negotiate with partner\nagencies and also maintain adequate staff (and their morale). In addition, respondents\nfelt that it was difficult to make headway on the `sexual violence agenda' when staff in\npartner agencies moved out of post quickly. The need for all sexual violence projects\n(both SARCs and voluntary) to become more visible in the multi-agency arena was also\ncommented upon by partner agencies:\nP54 (SVP4): Because we're in the voluntary sector, and we're seen as like a charity, I think\ntheir understanding of what we do is minimal. We do open days, and stuff like that to get\nagencies in to get a better understanding, but then like [ISVA] said they move on so rapidly, it's\nnot helpful, so you're continually getting someone there and they've got that understanding and\nthen they move on and then you have to start again.\nAn important contributing factor was the lack of strategic direction across the sites on\nsexual violence, meaning that the local infrastructures were often not in place to enable\nthe recognition of ISVAs' expertise around sexual violence. For example, of the six case\nstudy sites, only one (Site 1, a SARC) had the work of ISVAs included in local strategic\nplans. The other SARC with ISVAs (Site 2) was making progress on this, as the quotation\nbelow indicates. In the two voluntary sector projects (Sites 3 and 4) that employed ISVAs\nthese were not included. Although there is much national guidance, local Crime and\nDisorder Reduction Partnership (CDRPs) set their own locally driven priorities and it is\napparent that, to date, they may not be prioritizing sexual violence in the way that many\nrespondents (working in both SARC and voluntary settings) hoped for:\nP17 (SVP2): We are on a meeting called the Serious Sexual Violence meeting locally, which\ncame about as a result of the cross-government action plan. And as a result of that we're trying\nto get the ISVA onto the agenda of the CDRP and Local Criminal Justice Board. And so far the\nLCJB have been quite receptive to that, and we're working with them to try and fit the ISVA\ninto what they need to achieve, and it does fit quite well. The CDRP is a different matter,\nbecause they have different Performance Indicators which don't reflect as much the ISVA\nwork, so they have their indicators that they are meant to work towards, and that's where all\ntheir money goes. And because there's nothing specific around sexual violence, then that's why\nwe're struggling to get the ISVA onto their agenda.\nThere was an often-expressed concern from respondents (especially in the projects\nbut also from partner agencies) that sexual violence, unlike domestic violence, was not\non `the agenda' to the same extent, resulting in the view that much of their work was\n`below the radar' of other involved agencies. Lovett et al. (2004) also found that, in\ncomparison to domestic violence, inter-agency links on sexual violence were minimal.\nP59 (RPA4): ... domestic violence services tend to be ahead of sexual violence service on the\nagenda, because it's something that's more familiar to the public, people understand what\nyou're talking about when you talk about domestic violence. I think issues relating to sexual\nviolence just are not so comfortable, and therefore not talked about so much, and therefore have\na lower profile generally.\nAll six study sites had links with local domestic violence agencies. Through activities\nsuch as being members of local domestic violence fora and participating in multi-agency\ninterventions for domestic violence (e.g. MARACs), respondents were very aware of\nwhat was `going on' in the domestic violence sector, which was considered to be a\nhigher level of engagement with the issue and more established multi-agency working\nthan in the sexual violence sector. For example, in the absence of a SARC, good work-\ning relationships with police were noted by agency staff who participated in MARACs.\nTherefore the key lesson felt to be learned from the domestic violence sector was the\nability of genuine, regular multi-agency partnership working to `raise the profile' of\nsexual violence across agencies, thereby improving performance:\nP31 (SVP3): I've heard some other stories where the police aren't interested, but in [city] I feel\nthat we're lucky. I have quite a good relationship with the police there. I think that possibly\nbecause I sit on the MARAC. The barriers should be broken down and I think the way to do that\nis for us all liaising with each other for the good of the survivor.\nFinally, despite the noticeable improvements in service delivery in many areas, there\nwere still parts of the population felt to be neglected by the current arrangements. When\nasked about remaining gaps in service provision, the vast majority of respondents imme-\ndiately mentioned services for children and young people experiencing sexual violence.\nOf the six sites, only one (a SARC) could be said to provide its services to nearly all\nchildren (three years and over). As a result, even in areas with very `joined up' working\non behalf of adult victims, there was a sense that the worst, most inconsistent services\nwere being reserved for the most vulnerable \u00ad children and young people.\nConclusion\nThe aim of this study was to describe the advantages and limitations of delivering sup-\nport to victims of sexual violence in two different settings: Sexual Assault Referral\nCentres (SARCs) and projects located in the voluntary sector such as Rape Crisis. Yet in\nour analytical focus on the differences across sites we must not lose sight of their shared\nvalues and concerns as projects with an exclusive focus on supporting victims of sexual\nviolence. Respondents in every site were passionately committed to the work they were\nundertaking and strongly believed that the services they provided were of great benefit\nboth to individual victims and the agencies with which they worked on a regular basis.\nThose working in both SARCs and voluntary projects shared a belief that multi-agency\npartnership work is the way forward in terms of overcoming past failures and providing\na better, more comprehensive response to the needs of victims and survivors of sexual\nviolence. However, despite these inroads, the level of multi-agency engagement differ-\nentiated the two settings, with each having varying degrees of experience and engage-\nment in multi-agency working. Because productive working relationships with partner\nagencies are required to enable effective and appropriate service provision to victims, it\nis imperative that, regardless of the approach taken, this type of work is prioritized and\nmaintained.\nRespondents across the sites were also similarly concerned over the relative lack of\nattention paid to sexual violence by local and national government, and felt that specialist\nservices were in a continual state of jeopardy in terms of funding. The newness of multi-\nagency work in this area was felt by many, and it seemed to be exacerbated by turnover\nfrom staff in key partner agencies. While successful multi-agency working on domestic\nviolence provided a useful example for the continuation of these efforts, it was felt that\nmore needs to be done to ensure that all victims of sexual violence receive adequate\nlevels of support.\nOur research suggests these two approaches complement each other, as each has\ndifferent strengths and limitations. First, it was identified that the two settings have very\ndifferent referral sources. For example, although SARCs may be based in different types\nof locations, as this research has highlighted they are more closely aligned to statutory\nservices as a result of their funding and nationally eight out of every 10 referrals to\nSARCs come from police or criminal justice agencies. In contrast, voluntary projects had\na more even spread of referrals from the various sources and, importantly, they had twice\nthe level of self-referrals compared to SARCs. Because of their close affiliation with\npolice in particular, SARCs were often perceived by some respondents as less independ-\nent than voluntary projects.\nAs we stated previously, the veracity of this assertion needs to be empirically tested\nas there is no evidence to suggest that, for example, the work of ISVAs is less victim-\nfocused when it takes place in a SARC rather than a voluntary project. Given that the\nmajority of respondents felt strongly that it was necessary to have independence from\nstatutory partners if there was to be effective delivery of services to victims of sexual\nviolence, yet were also very positive about SARCs, this issue requires further investiga-\ntion. More research is required to confirm whether concern over the independence of\nSARCs is warranted and, if so, how their independence can be maintained. The\nperspectives of those working in different agencies need to be understood alongside\nlonger-term trends of referrals to voluntary versus statutory services (including SARCs\nlocated in different types of settings), and especially the perceptions of victims them-\nselves (e.g. what are their reasons for accessing a particular service and how does the\n`independence issue' feature into this?).\nDifferences in referral sources are a likely explanation for the differences in the client\nbases for each of the two settings. Victims that accessed SARCs were more likely to be\nvictims of recent, rather than historical, cases of sexual violence, and more likely to be\nassaulted by strangers and acquaintances. They were twice as likely to be assaulted in\npublic places. In comparison, those accessing support from voluntary projects tended to\nbe victimized in domestic locations by family members, partners or ex-partners. As a\ndirect consequence of these differences, the services that victims require and receive in\nthe projects are likely to be similarly affected. Such differences raise questions about the\nappropriate location of the different support roles, namely ISVAs and counsellors. To\nreiterate one of the main responsibilities and valued aspects of the ISVArole is to provide\ncrisis intervention to victims following the abuse (Robinson, 2009). Consequently, while\nthe work of an ISVA may be undertaken either in SARCs or in voluntary projects, it\ncould be argued that ISVAs are best placed to work in SARCs to deal specifically with\nthis client base. Likewise, it could be argued that counsellors are better suited to working\nin voluntary projects where they are able to respond to victims reporting historical sexual\nabuse. While these might be valid arguments, especially in times of economic frugality,\nthe evidence from our research points to the utility for both settings to have available\nboth of these key workers to provide support to victims.\nOur research has described the different, yet complementary, nature of the two main\napproaches used to support victims of sexual violence in the UK. This is not to say that\nthese are all the approaches that are possible, or even desirable. We would argue that \u00ad\ntogether \u00ad they represent the minimum that should be available to victims living in every\narea of the UK. The service needs of sexual violence victims in any local area will be\ndiverse, and indeed could change over time for the same victim. A comprehensive\nstrategy that is truly victim-focused will include many types of support (e.g. advocacy,\ncounselling, criminal justice advice, practical assistance, medical attention, etc.), offered\nin varied locations (e.g. residential, police, medical), by different personnel (e.g. ISVAs,\ncounsellors, specialist police, forensic medical examiners, etc.). The Government's\nrecently published Action Plan indicates a commitment to funding and expanding both\nof the approaches discussed here, as well as considering additional methods of providing\nsupport to victims of sexual violence (e.g. implementing MARACs for high-risk victims\nof rape and sexual assault) (HM Government, 2011c). It was pleasing to hear the\nGovernment's recent announcement in March 2011 for the funding of four new Rape\nCrisis Centres, in addition to the \u00a310.5 million funding announced in January 2011 for\nexisting Rape Crisis Centres. This will complement monies committed to fund the work\nof ISVAs working in either SARCs or voluntary sector projects. We can only hope that\nthese positive developments will translate into improved outcomes for individual victims\nand their families, and lead to reductions in the prevalence of sexual violence over time.\nNotes\n1.

We use the term `voluntary projects' to denote projects located in the voluntary/third sector.\nAlthough the three case study sites located in the voluntary sector were Rape Crisis Centres\n(RCCs), not all of the voluntary projects included in the monitoring data (27 out of 35) were\nRCCs. To avoid confusion we refer to `voluntary sector projects'rather than RCCs throughout.\n3. Lack of partnership working was cited as a key contributor to the criminal justice system's\npoor performance in the Government's Without Consent report (HMIC and HMCPSI, 2007),\nas this was deemed responsible for a lack of co-ordinated service provision to victims and high\nlevels of attrition in these cases.\n4. This study was funded by the Home Office (SRG/07/019). The views expressed here do not\nnecessarily reflect Home Office policy.\n5. For example, see Table C.9b, Appendix C from the original report (Robinson, 2009).\n6. The distinction between these roles has been discussed in more detail in Robinson et al. (2011).\n7. MARACs are multi-agency risk assessment conferences for very high-risk victims of domes-\n8.
