Although decision research was\nonce split by distinct preferences for what it ought\nto be, recognition of the need for a more unified\nand complete understanding of decision making\nhas called for an end to these divisions (Dalal et al.,\n2010; Gore, Banks, Millward, & Kyriakidou,\ndrew, Gore & Banks, 2009). Examples of what\nsome have claimed decision making ought to be\ninclude a discipline based on normative ideals and\nprescriptive standards, one providing descriptive\naccounts of cognition studied in the \"wild,\" and\nthe study of systematic deviations in the form of\nheuristics and biases. Recent reframing by Kahne-\nman and Klein (2009) has focused on the intersec-\ntions between naturalistic decision making (NDM)\nand the heuristics and biases approach. Parallel to\nthis discussion, Rakow and Newell (2010) recom-\nmend the importance of researching a new frame\nof experience-based choice within the wider con-\ntext of decision research. It is clear to appreciate\nthat the conditions for advancement are ripe.\nThis article draws insights from the field of\nNDM to better understand decision makers'\npreferences as investigated within the paradigm\nof experience-based choice. We open with an\nexamination of recent findings relating to expe-\nrience-based choice. Noting the call to comple-\nment this with studies of \"cognition in the\nwild,\" the authors highlight the important con-\ntributions of the NDM community. We then\noutline an exploratory field study that advances\nour understanding of preferences in experience-\nbased choice in the wild. We conclude by con-\nsidering the implications of our findings for\nfuture research within the decision sciences.\nExperience-Based Choice\nExperience-based choice has rapidly become\na feature of decision science research. Recent\nresearch has found decision makers' prefer-\nences to consistently differ depending on the\nformat of choice presented. This has been\nmarked by studies documenting the observation\nAddress Correspondence to Claire McAndrew, The Bartlett\nSchool of Graduate Studies, University College London,\nCentral House, 14 Upper Woburn Place, London, WC1H\n0NN, United Kingdom, c.mcandrew@ucl.ac.uk.\nJournal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making\nCopyright \u00a9 2012, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.\nUnderstanding Preferences in Experience-Based\nChoice: A Study of Cognition in the \"Wild\"\nClaire McAndrew, University College London and Julie Gore,\nUniversity of Surrey\nof systematic differences between decisions\nbased on description and those based on experi-\nence (Camilleri & Newell, 2009b; Hertwig &\nThe first, decision from description, is a for-\nmat whereby every possible outcome and deci-\nsion is specified at the outset (Hertwig & Ples-\nkac, 2008). Consider, for example, a game\nwhereby you are asked to choose between (a) a\nwinning $10 or (b) a guaranteed $1. People tend\nto attribute more weight to small-probability\nevents than objectively warranted and so prefer\n(a), the gamble. That is, people are risk seeking\nfor small-probability gains and high-probability\nlosses (people tend to prefer a 10% chance of\n$10 to $1 for sure) and risk averse for high-\nprobability gains and small-probability losses\n(most people prefer $9 for sure to a 99% chance\nof $10). Decisions emerge consistent with pros-\npect theory's fourfold pattern of choice: Partici-\npants are risk averse for high-probability gains,\nrisk seeking for high-probability losses, risk\naverse for small-probability losses, and risk\nseeking for small-probability gains (see Table 1).\nThe second format of choice, decision from\nexperience, is defined as one whereby personal\nobservation and feedback from the environment\nguide the outcomes generated and assessments\nof their relative probabilities. When people are\npresented with the task in this format, prefer-\nences for small-probability gains and losses tend\nto be the converse, with people displaying a\npreference for the sure thing (b) (Barron & Erev,\nHertwig, 2009; Hau, Pleskac, Kiefer, & Hertwig,\nsee Table 1). Risk aversion for a gain is attribut-\nable to underweighting of the rare event. Exami-\nnation of preferences for high-probability gains\nand losses for decisions from experience has\nbeen more limited, although speculation has sug-\ngested that there is little difference when com-\npared to preferences in the condition of descrip-\nExplanations for the differences between\nthese formats of choice have included sampling\nbias (one is more likely to undersample than\noversample experiences of rare events), recency\neffects (giving more weight to observations\nexperienced most recently; although note Bar-\nron and Yechiam's [2009] findings that call into\nquestion the notion of recency effects with rare\nevents), and the phenomenon of representation\n(an encoding distortion of the outcome distribu-\ntion prior to choice; Camilleri & Newell, 2009b;\nHertwig & Erev, 2009). Commenting on these\nfindings, Hertwig and Erev (2009) note the\nresults are to be viewed not as contradictory but\nas an illustration of how the mind operates in\ntwo different informational environments:\nIn other words, one should not play off\nresearch on description-based and experi-\nence-based behavior--their contrast is\nenlightening. However, to better under-\nstand how people make decisions with\nincomplete and uncertain information \"in\nthe wild\", there is a need to study experi-\nential choices that are often representative\nof people's actual choices.

Speculation is indicated by the presence of question marks.\nPreferences in Experience-Based Choice 181\nRakow and Newell (2010) echo this call for a\nframework that places experience-based choice\nwithin the wider context of decision research,\nsuggesting that rather than asking what happens\nin experience-based choice and what happens in\ndescribed choice, one may do better to ask what\nis the role of experience and what part does the\ndescription play? They suggest this approach is\nimperative to understanding properties of the\nexternal choice environment, types of learning\nexperience, types of choice, and properties of\nthe internal representation of payoffs (see\nRakow & Newell, 2010, for a comprehensive\nreview of future directions). It is through such\nan examination that we position this article in\nthe hope that this exchange is constructive to\nboth communities and researchers working in\nthe field and the laboratory.\nCognition in the Wild\nOriginating as a critique of disembodied\nviews of cognition resulting from study within\nthe artificial setting of the laboratory, the con-\ncept \"cognition in the wild\" was coined by\nHutchins (1995a). By locating cognition in\ncontext and by focusing on the interactions\nbetween multiple agents and material artifacts,\nthe study of cognition in the wild would give\nrise to the situated and socially constituted\naspects of cognitive activity.\nA new perspective for cognitive science\nguided by anthropology and cognitive theory,\ndecision making has been studied in complex\nsettings, such a shipboard navigation (Hutchins,\nHutchins & Klausen, 2000) and steam plant\noperations (Halff, Hollan, & Hutchins, 1986).\nAlthough the central thesis of Hutchins' work\nhighlighted the necessity to complement exper-\nimental investigations with experiential studies\nof cognition, it is important to observe that this\nperspective emerged in parallel to NDM, a per-\nspective that arguably combines quasi-experi-\nmentalism and ethnography to study cognition\nin the wild, to which we now turn.\nNDM\nTo some decision research communities,\nNDM is a relatively nascent research area\n(Hodgkinson & Starbuck, 2008) focusing on\nthe study of cognition in real-world environ-\nments marked by ill-structured problems;\nuncertain, dynamic environments; shifting, ill-\ndefined, or competing goals; action-feedback\nloops; time stress; high stakes; multiple players;\nand organizational goals and norms (Orasanu &\nConnolly, 1993). Regarded as \"the way people\nuse their experience to make decisions in field\nreceived as a complementary mode of inquiry\nto the more classic behavioral decision-making\nparadigm and research associated with heuris-\ntics and biases (Connolly & Koput, 1996; Gon-\nGore et al. (2006) noted, the NDM movement\ninvolves the close examination of heuristics and\nthe study of expertise to learn about more pow-\nerful domain specific heuristics. NDM research-\ners look for what people do right rather than\nwhat they do wrong, which is the traditional\nform of inquiry inspired by Kahneman and col-\nleagues (Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982;\nIn other words, much of behavioral decision\nmaking and heuristics and biases research has\nlooked at errors in cognition focusing on judg-\nments for which participants have very little if\nany expertise (Strack & Mussweiler, 1997;\nTversky & Kahneman, 1974). NDM's focus on\nthe positive features of expert cognition is posi-\ntioned in response to the inappropriateness of\ngeneralizing insights from the study of novices\nto experts in more realistic settings. Lipshitz,\nKlein, Orasanu, and Salas's (2001) focus article\n\"Taking Stock of Naturalistic Decision Mak-\ning\" provides a good insight into the field and\ndocuments the boundaries of the framework.\nFor more recent discussions of the intersections\nand differences between NDM and the heuris-\ntics and biases approach, see Kahneman and\nKlein's (2009) article \"Conditions for Intuitive\nExpertise: A Failure to Disagree.\"\nAs outlined in Kahneman and Klein (2009),\nNDM research emphasizes two skills: the abil-\nity to recognize patterns of previously experi-\nenced cues in new situations and the ability to\nnotice and extract cues in unrecognized situa-\ntions by drawing from past experience and\nbuilding stories (G. Klein, 1997; Lipshitz &\nPras, 2005). Recognition-primed decision mak-\ncues from sensory stimuli can trigger the prob-\nlem-solving process. Accordingly, the NDM\ncommunity has made significant progress in\nexamining decision making as an experientially\ndriven process through a consolidation of the-\nory and real-world applications (Johnston,\ngomery, Lipshitz, & Brehmer, 2005; Mosier &\nFischer, 2011; Schraagen, Militello, Ormerod,\nDespite this progress, the choice in domains\nof application has scarcely deviated from early\nstudies of firefighting, military command and\ncontrol, and nursing (Drury & Darling, 2008; G.\nMilitello & Lim, 1995). Accordingly, this work\ninvestigates the relevance of an NDM lens to a\nfurther field of study: day traders in financial\nmarkets. This builds on recent discussions exam-\nining the synergies between NDM and organiza-\ntional decision making (Gore et al., 2006: Lip-\nshitz, Klein, & Carroll, 2006; McAndrew &\nGore, 2010) and the relevance of Orasanu and\nConnolly's (1993) typology of eight defining\ncharacteristics of NDM to this domain.\nThe uncertain and dynamic environments\nexperienced by day traders are epitomized by\nthe comparatively fast pace of markets in which\nthey work. \"Real\" decision problems seldom\npresent themselves in an entirely complete and\norderly form. Dealing with ill-structured prob-\nlems, day traders expend effort (a) generating\nhypotheses about the situation, (b) developing\noptions as appropriate responses, and (c) recog-\nnizing that the situation is one permissible of\nchoice. Shifting, ill-defined, or competing goals\nalso denote the information environments\nwithin which traders operate. Although the\noverarching objective is to create profit, the\nnatural fluctuation and pattern of markets may\nnecessitate changes in trading strategies (i.e.,\ntrading ranges or jobbing) and positions (i.e.,\nlong vs. short).\nNDM purports that \"real\" decision environ-\nments are arranged as a series of temporally\nsegregated events as opposed to one discrete\ndecision at a specific point in time. The use of\naction-feedback loops to rectify early mistakes\nis a characteristic of corrective action that maps\ndirectly onto the work of day traders. This is\namplified by a rate of feedback that is almost\nimmediate when trading intraday positions. The\nhigh stakes associated with such transactions\nare also significant because of the uncertainty\nand risk associated with the short-term volatil-\nity of markets, which necessitate instantaneous\ncalls of judgment and also bring a significant\namount of time stress. The financial market as\na reflection of an underlying psychological sen-\ntiment felt by market players at any one point in\ntime fits with Orasanu and Connolly's (1993)\nneed to appreciate the cognitive activities of\nmultiple players. Finally, the suggestion that the\norganization may establish general goals, rules,\nand standard operating procedures is reflected\nin the specification of the size of trading fund\nand stop losses.\nIn spite of this congruence, researchers have\nnot, until now, examined day trading from an\nNDM perspective, favoring instead a behav-\nioral finance lens. Examining the role of experi-\nence in financial markets, behavioral finance\nresearchers have displayed a tendency to use\nlaboratory settings to compare expert versus\nstudent performance. See, for instance, Ander-\nson and Sunder's (1995) comparison of labora-\ntory market behavior between expert commod-\nity and stock traders and MBA students. Stock\nprice forecasting using probabilistic judgments\nof the likelihood of price increases or decreases\n(Sta\u00ebl von Holstein, 1972) is also characteristic\nof this approach although it has had limited suc-\ncess. As Mieg (2001) notes, experimental tasks\nof this nature lack the realism necessary for\ninformative conclusions, as in practice, market\nprices are judged directly, not in terms of cate-\ngorical judgments or probabilities. Research of\nthis type also neglects the role of social net-\nworks and intercorrelated markets as a basis of\ninformational leverage.\nA growing trend has been the use of social\npsychological approaches, such as personality\nprofiling to understand risk propensity (Fenton-\nO'Creevy, Nicholson, Sloane, & Willman,\n2005) and the application of concepts such as\nemotion regulation to understand decision-\nmaking behavior and performance (Fenton-\nO'Creevy, Soane, Nicholson, & Willman,\nPreferences in Experience-Based Choice 183\n2011). This work has aided understanding of\nthe process by which day traders acquire exper-\ntise: anticipation, encounter, adjustment, and\nstabilization. Fenton-O'Creevy et al. (2005)\nsuggest that the most pertinent episodes shap-\ning trading styles include early experiences of\nloss and gain, emotional experience of the for-\nmer, and beliefs about the market that are based\non cause and effect and decision outcomes.
