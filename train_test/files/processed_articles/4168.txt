Exemplars from five Protestant denominations,\nSouthern Baptist, United Church of Christ, Presbyterian, Methodist and Church of Christ,\nwere found and confidentially interviewed at length about their lives, religious education\nand indoctrination, aspirations, problems and ways of coping. The in-depth, qualitative\ninterviews formed the basis for profiles of all five, together with general observations about\ntheir predicaments and how they got into them.

Certainly there are former clergy who\nfall in this category. Before making their life-wrenching decisions, they were secret\nnonbelievers. Who knows how many like-minded pastors discover that they simply cannot\ntake this mortal leap from the pulpit and then go on to live out their ministries in secret\ndisbelief? What is it like to be a pastor who doesn't believe in God? John Updike gave us a\nmoving account in his brilliant novel, In the Beauty of the Lilies (1996), which begins with\nthe story of Reverend Wilmot, a Lutheran minister whose life is shattered by his decision to\nrenounce the pulpit in the face of his mounting disbelief. But that is fiction and Wilmot's\nperiod of concealment is short-lived. What is it like to be a pastor who stays the course, in\nspite of sharing Wilmot's disbelief?\nPreachers who are not believers\nWith the help of a grant from a small foundation, administered through Tufts\nUniversity, we set out to find some closeted nonbelievers who would agree to be\nintensively \u00ad and, of course, confidentially \u00ad interviewed. The interviews were all\nconducted by Linda LaScola, a clinical social worker with years of professional experience\nas a qualitative researcher and psychotherapist, and, until recently, a regular churchgoer.\nLike her co-author, philosopher Daniel Dennett, the author of Breaking the Spell (2006),\nshe is an atheist who is nevertheless a sympathetic and fascinated observer of religious\npractices and attitudes. For this pilot study we managed to identify five brave pastors, all\nstill actively engaged with parishes, who were prepared to trust us with their stories. All\nfive are Protestants, with master's level seminary education. Three represented liberal\ndenominations (the liberals) and two came from more conservative, evangelical traditions\n(the literals). We decided to concentrate this first project on Christians, and we would have\nincluded a Roman Catholic or Greek Orthodox priest, for instance \u00ad if we had encountered\nany, but we didn't. We initially had six participants, but one, a woman in the Episcopal\nchurch, had a change of heart as we were about to go to press and, at her request, all further\nreferences to her and quotations from her interviews have been removed.\nOur sample is small and self-selected, and it is not surprising that all of our pastors\nthink that they are the tip of an iceberg, but they are also utterly unable to confirm this\nbelief. They might be deluding themselves, but in any case their isolation from others\nwhom they suspect are in the same boat is a feature they all share, in spite of striking\ndifferences in their stories and attitudes. While we couldn't draw any reliable\ngeneralizations from such a small sample of clergy, the very variety of their stories, as well\nas the patterns discernible in them, suggest fascinating avenues for further research on this\nall but invisible phenomenon.\nMaterials and Methods\nHow on earth did we recruit them? By spreading the word discreetly. Eighteen\npeople were contacted to participate between September 2008 and April 2009. Initial\nrecruiting attempts were made via personal contacts (e.g., clergy and seminary\nacquaintances, non-believing clergy who had retired or left the profession). When\napproached, potential respondents were told that the intent was to \"learn more about the\nissues that clergy face when their beliefs are not in synch with church teachings.\" Dennett\nmentioned the study at conferences he attended. Ultimately, the five participants came from\ntwo sources: two from a list of clergy who had originally contacted the Center for\nProgressive Christianity (TCPC) for general information, and three from people who had\npersonally contacted Dan Barker, co-director of the Freedom from Religion Foundation.\nBarker is a former minister and author of two books about losing his religious beliefs. Jim\nAdams, a retired Episcopal priest, author and the founder of TCPC, provided a list of 28\nnames. Of those, nine were contacted and two of the nine participated in the study. Four\npeople contacted Dan Barker directly. Of those, two agreed to participate. One contact who\nwas a former clergyman, and therefore not eligible to participate, referred a colleague who\nthen agreed to participate. Three women who expressed interest were not asked to\nparticipate: one because she was no longer in a pastoral role and two because their\ndenominations were already represented in the study. Four men declined to participate: two\ndid not follow up after showing initial interest; two others cited concerns about the term\nPreachers who are not believers\n\"non-believing.\" Though neither of them believed in a supernatural god, both strongly self-\nidentified as believers.\nBut what do they mean by this? Are they perhaps deceiving themselves? There is no\nway of answering, and this is no accident. The ambiguity about who is a believer and who a\nnonbeliever follows inexorably from the pluralism that has been assiduously fostered by\nmany religious leaders for a century and more: God is many different things to different\npeople, and since we can't know if one of these conceptions is the right one, we should\nhonor them all. This counsel of tolerance creates a gentle fog that shrouds the question of\nbelief in God in so much indeterminacy that if asked whether they believed in God, many\npeople could sincerely say that they don't know what they are being asked.\nThis is not just agnosticism, the belief that one does not (or cannot) know whether\nGod exists, but something prior: the belief that one cannot even know which question \u00ad if\nany \u00ad is being asked. Many people are utterly comfortable with this curious ignorance; it\njust doesn't matter to them what the formulas mean that their churches encourage them to\nrecite. Some churches are equally tolerant of the indeterminacy: as long as you \"have faith\"\nor are \"one with Jesus\" (whatever you think that means) your metaphysical convictions are\nyour own business. But pastors can't afford that luxury. Their role in life often requires\nthem to articulate, from the pulpit and elsewhere, assertions about these very issues.\nA problem of definition\nI think my way of being a Christian has many things in common with\natheists as [Sam] Harris sees them. I am not willing to abandon the symbol\n\"God\" in my understanding of the human and the universe. But my\ndefinition of God is very different from mainline Christian traditions yet it is\nwithin them. Just at the far left end of the bell shaped curve. (Rick, one of\nour participants)\nA spectrum of available conceptions of God can be put in rough order, with frank\nanthropomorphism at one extreme \u00ad a God existing in time and space with eyes and hands\nand love and anger \u00ad through deism, a somehow still personal God who cares but is\nnevertheless outside time and space and does not intervene, and the still more abstract\nGround of all Being, from which (almost?) all anthropomorphic features have been\nremoved, all the way to frank atheism: nothing at all is aptly called God. To some people,\ndeism is already atheism in disguise, but others are more flexible. Karen Armstrong (2009),\nfor instance, dismisses both the anthropomorphic visions (\"idolatry\") and the various\nbrands of atheism, while claiming, as she recently put it while speaking with Terry Gross\non Fresh Air, that \"God is not a being at all.\" Assuming that she meant what she said, she\nclaims, by simple logical transposition, that no being at all is God. That would seem to be\nabout as clear a statement of atheism as one could ask for, but not in her eyes.\nThere is no agreement at all, then, about where to draw a line across this spectrum,\nwith belief in God on one side and non-belief on the other, and many people are quite\ncontent to ignore the question. But two of our pastors have felt the need to draw the line,\nand to recognize that, given where they draw the line, their own view has crossed it: they\nno longer deserve to be called believers, whatever others may think. The other three say\nthat they may not believe in a supernatural god, but they believe in something. Still, they all\nfind themselves with a secret: they don't believe what many of their parishioners think they\nPreachers who are not believers\nbelieve and think they ought to believe.\nThe fact that they see it in such morally laden terms shows how powerfully the\nphenomenon of belief in belief figures in our lives. Most people believe in belief in God;\nthey believe that it is a state one should aspire to, work strenuously to maintain, and foster\nin others \u00ad and feel guilty or dismayed if one fails to achieve it. Whether or not our pastors\nshare that belief in belief \u00ad some still do and others no longer do \u00ad they recognize only too\nwell that revealing their growing disbelief would have dire consequences for their lives. So\nthey keep it to themselves.\nResults\nAfter introducing them, we will explore the most interesting similarities and\ndifferences we discovered. We have given them fictitious names and scrambled the\ninessential details of their stories that might serve to identify them, so any similarity seen\nbetween their stories and known individuals should be viewed as mere coincidence. Here\nare their stories.\nWes, the Methodist \u00ad Making Clergy Obsolete\nWes, age 42, has been the pastor of a liberal Methodist church in the Northwest for\n10 years. He has a 10 year old son and is married to a schoolteacher who shares his views\nabout religion. Wes and his wife are raising their son to recognize that Bible stories are not\nfactual:\nAnd so when we talk to him about Bible stories, we remind him constantly\nthat these are just stories. These are stories; think about them in no different\nway than you would any other stories.\nWes was raised Baptist in the South and attended a liberal Christian college and seminary\nbefore moving west. Although he rejected his family's conservative views as a young adult,\nhe was positively involved in the life of the church in his youth:\nI felt very surrounded by people who were concerned about me. I was very\ncomfortable in that environment. And I suppose I've always been, perhaps,\nmost comfortable in a church environment. I flourished there. I was the one\nthat answered all the questions. I cared about all this kind of stuff ... Bible\ntrivia. It made me think I knew the Bible.\nFrom liberal to literal\nOnce in college, he was surprised by what he learned:\nI went to college thinking Adam and Eve were real people. And I can\nremember really wrestling with that when my Old Testament professor was\npointing out the obvious myths and how they came to be. And I kind of\njoked at the time that I prayed my way all the way to atheism. Because in\nthe early days, it was wrestling with God; praying to God.\nPreachers who are not believers\nWes decided to go on to seminary because the credits he would receive there could be\napplied either to PhD studies in the philosophy of religion or to a career in the clergy.\nLooking back on it, he realizes that he also felt limited in his choices:\nIf you finish your junior year, if you're going to declare a new major, now\nyou're setting yourself back. And I'll be the first to admit that my\nupbringing placed limitations on what I thought was possible for me, which\nis something I've sworn to not do with my son.... Not that I believe in such\nthings, but it was almost predestined that I would be a minister because of\nmy role as a kid in church, my parents' role.... I'd love to be a scientist. I\nthink that would be wonderful.\nWhen in seminary, he noticed the differing reactions that his classmates had to the\nscholarly information they were receiving about biblical history:\nI would guess if there were 30 people in the archeology class, there would\nbe 25% of them who would become very defensive and argumentative with\nthe professor. And probably only one or two of the 30 would be open to it.\nThe rest would just not say much.\nEventually, he decided to pursue a career in the ministry. It seemed like a natural fit:\nSo I kind of thought, well, you know I really know religion; I know\nChristianity. It's been in my blood. And I suddenly felt like there was a\ncertain strand of Christianity that I could identify with. And the Methodist\nChurch --- was different ... really, it's a very progressive church. So I felt at\nhome there.\nWes has had some qualms about his role as a non-believing minister, but overall he thinks\nhe is being true to the very worthy mission of developing liberal, democratic values among\nhis church members:\nMy first few years of doing this were wracked with, \"God, should I be doing\nthis? Is this ---? Am I being ---? Am I posing? Am I being less than\nauthentic; less than honest?\" ... And, I really wrestled with it and to some\ndegree still. But not nearly as much.\nI will be the first to admit that I see Christianity as a means to an end, not as\nan end unto itself. And the end is very basically, a kind of liberal,\ndemocratic values. So I will use Christianity sometimes against itself to try\nto lead people to that point. But there's so much within the Christian\ntradition that itself influenced the development of those liberal values, you\nknow. They didn't arise through secular means. They came out of some\nreligious stuff.... I could couch all that in very secular language. If we were\nin a college setting, I would. But we're in a religious setting, so I use the\nreligious language.\nPreachers who are not believers\nDemythologizing religion\nWes thinks that what separates him from people who identify themselves as atheists\nis his openness to using the word \"God\":\nThe difference between me and an atheist is basically this: it's not about the\nexistence of God. It's: do we believe that there is room for the use of the\nword \"God\" in some context? And a thoroughly consistent atheist would\nsay, \"No. We just need to get over that word just like we need to get over\nconcepts of race. We quit using that word, we'd be better off.\" Whereas I\nwould say I agree with that in a great many cases, but I still think the word\nhas some value in some contexts. So I think the word God can be used very\nexpressively in some of my more meditative modes. I've thought of God as\na kind of poetry that's written by human beings. As a way of dealing with\nthe fact that we're finite; we're vulnerable.\nHe says he is happy in ministry, knowing that it provides a flexible and comfortable\nlifestyle and an opportunity to positively influence people's lives. Although he thinks that\nreligion will be around a long time, he sees that part of his role is to help make his job\nobsolete. He thinks many of his liberal Christian colleagues have similar views, which they\nwould express if they had a suitable opportunity:\nMy colleagues here are very educated, very well read, and do not believe the\nsignificance of Christianity lies in whether it's literally true. They do believe\nthat it is metaphorically describing something that is real. Something\nspiritual that we cannot get at, that is a presence in this universe. That's\nwhere they differ from me. But the way we use the language is going to be\nvery similar, and the reason it's going to be similar is that our goals are the\nsame. Our goals are to help people become freer than they were before, and\nto be transformed. So if becoming a Christian transforms a person's life for\nthe better, I have no problem with them becoming a Christian. But I also\nhave no problem with it if it means betraying Christianity, if that's what\nhelps them. And I think many of my colleagues, if they were in this kind of\nenvironment [confidential interview], would admit to that. They wouldn't,\nthough, in front of their bishops.\nThey're very liberal. They've been de-mythologized, I'll say that. They\ndon't believe Jesus rose from the dead literally. They don't believe Jesus\nwas born of a virgin. They don't believe all those things that would cause a\nbig stir in their churches. But that's not uncommon in mainline\ndenominations, or even in the Catholic Church. I mean, you have a\nprofessional class of people, basically, who are working with an\norganization of non-professionals.\nComing Out to a Friend\nWes has confided his non-belief with one of his church members. He and Wes\nPreachers who are not believers\nbecame close friends while working on various church projects over a period of several\nyears:\nWe kind of felt each other out over the course of time ... just a little bit of\nself-revelation at a time. And we got to the point, you know, where he felt\ncomfortable saying things to me.\nPerhaps he was the one that maybe kind of initiated asking questions, trying\nto figure out what I thought of some things. I can't remember exactly what\nhe said, but he brought it up: \"Do you think there is a being out there\nsomewhere?\" And at that point, I knew him well enough, so I said \"Oh, no.\"\nHe absolutely died laughing! And he said, \"You know, I've really been\nwrestling with that myself, but I've never met anybody who just said, \"Oh,\nof course not!\" He hasn't been privy to all my years of struggle. He was just\nshocked that I was just so matter-of-fact.\nOffering Community\nWes thinks he is especially effective at offering community to people who doubt\nthey would fit into a Christian community:\nI'm interested in community, relationships. And I believe the argument\ncould be made that that's what Jesus was interested in anyway. So I can do\nthat at the local church level. And I'm also there for people who are\nrecovering Christians. There are a lot of people out there who have been\ndamaged by Christianity. And they feel guilty that they're not a Christian ---\nor that they're not practicing or whatever. I'm their ideal pastor, because\nthey can come to me and be told that they don't need to feel guilty.\nRick, the UCC Campus Minister \u00ad Social Justice Through the Church\nRick is a 72 year old United Church of Christ (UCC) minister receiving a full\npension from the church and a monthly stipend for his part-time work as a campus minister\nat an academically top-ranked university. He has served in campus ministry throughout his\nlong career because it has allowed him to pursue his interests in social causes. While\nworking on various campuses across the country, he has worked in civil rights, gay rights\nand women's rights, including assisting women who were seeking abortions before they\nwere legalized nationally. He specifically chose the UCC denomination because it had \"no\nforced doctrine,\" offered \"a lot of freedom to believe what you want to believe,\" and had a\nlarge and active social justice mission.\nThe Accidental Minister\nRick's family was not very religious, but attended a socially liberal mainline\nprotestant church when he was growing up. While in college, he says:\n... like many students, I became agnostic \u00ad I didn't believe any of it. I\nwasn't reacting against it; I wasn't abused, as many I talk to are. But I just\nPreachers who are not believers\nsaid, \"there's nothing much there.\"\nHe majored in philosophy, political science and English and would likely have entered his\nfather's profession of law if the Korean War hadn't intervened. He learned that he could\navoid the draft by signing up for seminary. That wasn't his only motive, though. He was\ntruly interested in learning more about Christianity:\nI didn't believe in God, but I thought, before I reject the street version of\nChristianity, I'll go to seminary for a year. And I'll argue with the best\ntheologians and the best religious scholars, and then I'll get out. I'm not\ngoing to leave the church; I'm not going to leave what I was formed in until\nI have a chance to confront the scholars and argue and see what's going on.\nIs there anything in this God business? That was the way I kind of put it. Is\nthere anything to this? So I determined to enter seminary.\nIt was a good move for him and he decided to see it through. He enjoyed his professors,\ndescribing them as, \"people of faith who were also deeply intellectual and critical.\" He\nrespected the fact that they could, \"hold the life of the mind and the life of the faith\ntogether.\" He also realized that, unlike many of his classmates, he was not destined for\nparish ministry. He remembers his reaction when a professor said:\nWhen you get into your own churches, you've got to realize that there's\nthese two things that are important that you've got to do: you've got to raise\nmoney, and you've got to recruit members. And I checked out.\nIt was not just the responsibilities of parish life that held him back, it was the beliefs:\nI knew I'm not going to make it in a conventional church. I didn't believe\nthe conventional things, even then. I mean, sure, I'm studying theology with\nPaul Tillich --- and Bultmann who says we can't know much about Jesus,\nand Paul Tillich's philosophical stuff about \"God is the ground of being.\"\nI'm not going to go into a church and talk like this; I'm not going to, I'm not\ngoing to --- I did not believe the traditional things even then.\nChoosing the Christian Tradition\nWhen asked about how his classmates reacted to learning the details of Christian\nhistory, he said:\nWell, they sat through the same Old Testament courses I did, and half of\nthem were fighting against it the whole way. Because they didn't like the\nscholarship, they couldn't --- it was a challenge to their faith. Well, I didn't\nhave to deal with that; because I wanted to know what it was. They felt\nthreatened; they pulled back. ...they would fight the professor about his\ninterpretation about Old Testament passages. They were kind of literalistic\nabout it. And when we'd talk about myth and stories, they'd say, \"No, it\nhappened!\" So there was kind of a clash. They didn't like to have their\nPreachers who are not believers\nliteralistic interpretation of the Bible undermined by an Old Testament\nscholar. It was quite a thing to see!\nStill, Rick identifies strongly as a Christian:\nThese are my people, this is the context in which I work, these are the\npeople that I know. These are the communities I've worked with. These are\nthe communities where I can make a difference.\nWhile he does not believe \"all this creedal stuff\" about Jesus dying for our sins, being God\nor being incarnate, he is attracted to Jesus as \"...somebody who was concerned about\nsocial justice\" and \"...a compelling vision of what it means to be human, and what it means\nto --- live life fully in the world.\" He acknowledges that:\n...if I'd been born in China, I'd be a Buddhist. I wasn't. I was born here, and\nI was formed here.... I do not see the passion for social justice in the\nBuddha. Jesus was born a poor peasant, and worked with the poor, and\ntalked about the poor.\nAccording to Rick, his UCC ordination does not require taking vows. He made \"a\nstatement of faith,\" which meant presenting a paper to clergy in his Conference (i.e., the\nassociation of local churches). His paper was on liberal scholars Paul Tillich and Rudolf\nBultmann. This was adequate, he says, because:\n...as long as ... you're talking about God and Jesus and the Bible, that's\nwhat they want to hear. You're just phrasing it in a way that makes sense to\n[them] ... but language is ambiguous and can be heard in different ways.\nA Place to Question and Grow\nCampus ministry gave him freedom within the structure of the church, allowing him\nto work with students who were questioning as much as he was. He could \"run and be\ncreative,\" making his own \"exciting programs\" without having too many people \"in\nauthority\" over him.\nHe especially enjoys doing adult education and sees his goal as liberating people\nfrom \"bad ideas\" about Christianity, saying, \"Can you imagine the pain that people\nsuffered with? `I'm going to hell if I don't believe this?'\" He feels some of them have been\n\"wounded, like an alcoholic\" and points out that they will \"invariably\" ask, \"Why didn't\nthey teach us that in church? If I'd known this 25 years ago, I wouldn't have had to carry\nthis burden around!\" So he feels he's playing \"a kind of a therapeutic role.\"\nWhen asked his opinion of why ministers do not pass on their knowledge of\nChristian history to parishioners, he said:\nThey don't want to rock the boat. They don't want to lose donations. They\nwant to keep their jobs. They don't want to stir up trouble in the\ncongregation. They've got enough trouble as it is, keeping things moving\nalong. They don't want to make people mad at them. They don't want to\nlose members. What they will often do is bring in someone like me to be a\nPreachers who are not believers\nlightning rod, and teach it, and they'll follow up on it.\nHe expressed more about his views on God after the interviews, commenting on an article\nhe emailed that was written by atheist author Sam Harris (2006b). He felt that he'd been\n\"educated and sensitized\" by the article, saying, \"If not believing in a supernatural, theistic\ngod is what distinguishes an atheist, then I am one too.\" But he also said, \"I don't consider\nmyself an atheist\" and, \"I am not willing to abandon the symbol `God' in my understanding\nof the human and the universe.\"\nDarryl, the Presbyterian - Transcendency of the Human Spirit\nDarryl is a 36 year old Presbyterian minister with a church outside of Baltimore. He\nis married and has three young children. After an initial phone conversation about the\nstudy, he sent an email further explaining his desire to participate. In it, he wrote:\nI am interested in this study because I have regular contact in my circle of\ncolleagues \u00ad both ecumenical and Presbyterian \u00ad who are also more\nprogressive-minded than the \"party line\" of the denomination. We are not\n\"un-believers\" in our own minds \u00ad but would not withstand a strict \"litmus\ntest\" should we be subjected to one. I want to see this new movement within\nthe church given validity in some way.\nI reject the virgin birth. I reject substitutionary atonement. I reject the\ndivinity of Jesus. I reject heaven and hell in the traditional sense, and I am\nnot alone.\nI am a \"Jesus Follower\" for sure. It is arguable whether I am also a\n\"Christian.\" I can't imagine continuing in this work if I did not have a strong\npersonal faith of some kind. My cognitive dissonance revolves around the\nurge to rescue others who find themselves in the same boat \u00ad and who still\nstrongly believe in God in some sense, and find Jesus a compelling religious\nfigure.\nHis Beliefs and Others'\nHe described himself as a believer in God, but not in the traditional Christian God:\n...it's not that I'm not a believer. I do believe in God. But I find that the\ncharacter of my belief is much closer to that pantheist view than the typical\ntheist.\nHe says he and his wife are \"very similar theologically,\" and he doesn't think she has any\nproblems with where he is. She's \"very progressive, very liberal.\"\nHe also thinks his seminary professors and some of the members of his\ncongregation have similar feelings:\n...certainly the professors I respected at seminary were very open minded\nPreachers who are not believers\npeople. And for the most part, with education comes a healthy skepticism,\nbut not necessarily disbelief. I think most of the academics in my\ncongregation would agree with me that --- that God is not the literal God\nfrom the bible that the tradition has somewhat purported. I don't think that\nthese men and women in my congregation, for the most part, believe in the\nvirgin birth. I know that some of them don't. I had these conversations with\nsome of them. That it's something that's just not important to them.\nFollowing the Call\nDarryl was raised in the Presbyterian Church and was drawn to the ministry as a\nyouth after a playmate was killed in a terrorist attack while abroad on a family vacation.\nAfter experiencing frightening thoughts of suicide, he decided that:\nWhether there was a God or not, I would choose to live as if there was a\nGod. Because I didn't like the alternative. I didn't want to kill myself. The\nalternative was despair.\nHe felt that \"there was always this sense of call in my life. The process of becoming a\npastor was exploring this sense of calling from God.\"\nHe enjoyed his seminary experience, saying that it \"blew open\" Christian doctrine,\nallowing him to realize that Christianity wasn't \"black and white, it was plaid, polka dot ---\nthere was just such a variety of thought that went in every different kind of direction.\"\nAt some point in his studies, he gave up the idea of an afterlife that was an\nextension of our current consciousness. He started thinking in terms of \"a transcendency of\nthe human spirit\" that he has difficulty describing, saying, \"I know that it's not going to be\nsomething that I can comprehend with my mortal brain.\" Still, believing in something is\nimportant to him. He thinks clergy would be \"really sad individuals if they just didn't\nbelieve in anything and that they're just sadly going through the motions of the job.\"\nHe likes his work and the flexibility his job offers. He'd like an opportunity to\nopenly minister to people like himself:\nI do feel called to work with people who have the same doubts and\nquestions.... I think there's room in Christianity for this. Is the Presbyterian\nChurch willing to make that room within its own? I don't know.\nConsidering Other Options\nHe also thinks about the freedom he'd have if he left or retired from the church,\nspecifically mentioning Jack (John Shelby) Spong, the retired Episcopal Bishop who writes\nand speaks openly about how Christianity needs to modernize in order to survive:\nWell that guy has a glow to him; he's just fantastic. But he can say whatever\nhe wants because he's got his nest egg. He's not concerned about his\nretirement or anything like that. Liberating!\nHe expressed concern about the possibility of moving to a more conservative presbytery\nwhere he might not be able to honestly respond to the doctrinal questions he could be\nPreachers who are not believers\nasked:\nIf I had to jump through too many hoops, ... I just have to look and see how\ngenuine I would be, and how comfortable I would feel.\nHe has broached the subject of his lack of traditional beliefs with a few colleagues whom\nhe thinks are like-minded, but has not talked as directly with them as he talked during the\ninterviews. He did talk fairly candidly with a trusted older colleague whom he felt had\nsimilar beliefs:\nI doubt [he] believes in the virgin birth. And probably wouldn't admit that\nhe didn't believe Jesus was God. ... and I did tell him that I didn't think\nJesus was God necessarily.... We talked about whether it would be a\nproblem if at some point, I transfer.\nAfter seeing Religulous, Bill Maher's (2008) comedy documentary about religion, he had\ngood things to say about Maher:\nHe's a genuine, honest guy who's acknowledging the questions in his heart,\nand is fed up and passionate and angry about the religious violence in the\nworld. And there's a lot of justification for that. And I'm right there on 80-\n90% of the stuff, so we'd have a lot to talk about. You know, we'd go out\nand have a beer together. And I think we agree on a lot of stuff, and I think\nhe would criticize me about just sticking with this right now.\nAnd despite his many stated concerns, he also had good things to say about the role of the\nchurch in his life:\nThe church has been a positive thing in my life overall. It's been a place of\naffirmation, it's been a place of comfort, it's been a place of ritual and\nwonderful mystery.\nPractical Concerns\nDuring the interviews, he often discussed his feelings toward the ministry and how\nhis changing beliefs could affect his family. For instance, he said:\nThis is not only the course of my life I've chosen to pursue, but I provide for\nmy family this way. So if I'm having this cognitive dissonance, then sure,\nI've got to come to terms with how I do this in a genuine way. And at what\npoint do I not do it any longer.\nSo maybe there'll be a divorce between myself and the Presbyterian Church.\nI need to feel fulfilled, and I need to provide for myself and my family. I can\ngo back and get new education and training, but I've got to do something.\nAnd so do I completely pitch this? Well, I don't think it's completely\nwithout value.\nPreachers who are not believers\nI realize that if I come out a little more, I may be burning bridges in terms of\nmy ability to earn a living this way. At some point, that may be less\nimportant. But it still would be something I would grieve, because this has\nbeen a meaningful experience in my life even though there are parts of the\nhierarchy of the church that I have become dissatisfied with.\nHe also raised the possibility of being defrocked at different points in the interviews:\nTo a certain extent, I don't care if I get defrocked. I really don't. If people\ndon't want me in this, I'll do something else. I might try and do hospital\nchaplaincy.\nI'm really not afraid of anything coming as a result [of these interviews].\nI'm not afraid of being defrocked just because I'm not interested in being\nafraid.\nAdam, Church of Christ \u00ad A Hunger for Learning\nAdam decided to obtain a Master of Arts in Religion to be a minister in the Church\nof Christ, a denomination that does not require master's level education for its clergy:\nI hungered to continue learning; I felt like it was very applicable; I felt like it\nwould prepare me more to minister. And I was very focused on the practical\nministry side. I wasn't so much into deep theology or --- world missions, or\n--- philosophy of religion.... I mean, there were theology classes and\nphilosophy classes and all that. And I had to have one year of Hebrew, two\nyears of Greek.\nOver 20 years later, that same desire to learn led him away from religious belief. It started\nwhen he read David Kinnaman and Gabe Lyons' (2007) unChristian: What a New\nGeneration Thinks About Christianity \u00ad and Why It Matters, a Barna Group publication\nthat rebuts common criticisms people have about Christianity. His intention was to become\nmore skilled at defending his faith, but as he tried to \"step back\" to look at Christianity\nfrom a non-believer's perspective, he found that he became more swayed to that point of\nview:\nIf God is God, he's big enough; he can handle any questions I've got. Well,\nhe didn't. He didn't measure up! And that sounds, you know, so funny,\nbecause if I heard somebody else saying that a year ago, I'd have thought,\n\"You are such a sacrilegious person. God's going to strike you dead by\nlightning or something!\" I've actually thought and tried to pin-point, but I\ncan honestly say that intellectually, from within the first few weeks of my\nstudies, I thought, \"Wow! Could this be true?\" So almost from that point\non, it's almost been downhill if you're Christian; uphill if you're a non-\nbeliever. Coming to the truth --- and I always thought there was absolute\nPreachers who are not believers\ntruth out there. Now I'm a lot more relativistic.\nI tell you, the book that just grabbed my mind and just twisted it around, was\nChristopher Hitchens' God is Not Great. It was shocking, some of that stuff\n\u00ad the throws and jabs against faith and stuff. I would think, \"He's crazy.\"\nBut then I'd say, \"No. Step back and read it for what it is.\" And that's also\nthe same time when I thought, \"I'm going to balance my study. I'm not\ngoing to over-balance myself with atheist writers.\"\nIn the past year, Adam has absorbed over 60 books, videos or podcasts addressing a wide\nvariety of views. He was especially impressed by debates on religion:\nProbably one of the most mind-opening things was listening to all these\ndebates from top people of Christianity; or believers vs. non-believers. And\nI tried to do the same thing: be open and listen, and use my mind and reason,\nI guess. And almost undeniably, even being a believer and knowing the\nChristian claims and scripture, you know what? This guy won in the debate.\nHe's a non-believer. Why?\nWanting a Life that Mattered\nAdam is a 43 year old worship minister and church administrator currently working\nin a large Church of Christ congregation in South Carolina. He was raised Presbyterian and\nbecame involved with conservative Christianity while dating his future wife. He decided to\nenter the ministry not because he felt a \"calling\" or had a \"mystical experience\" but\nbecause he wanted \"a purpose that was beyond just existing\":\nI wanted my life to matter. To connect. For something bigger and better,\nbeyond what I was doing.\nEven in seminary, when confronted with questions and contradictions in the study of\nacademic Christianity, he stayed focused on his desire to help people live a Christian life\nthat would ultimately lead them to eternal life:\nOK, here's what Biblical scholars are saying, and there's some questions\nover here, but I just trust God, and know he's guiding me, and I'm learning\nthis so I can be a minister and help people. When I was working with\npeople, it was a lot more practically focused on, \"OK, here's what the Bible\nsays, how do we live it out? How do we encourage other people? What's the\nwhole evangelistic side of Christianity? How can we win more people into\nChrist.\" I mean you're sincere; that's what your goal is. You don't want\nanybody to miss out and to go to hell.\nI don't remember stressing a lot over doubts that were raised by the study,\nundergraduate or graduate. At the graduate level, I was challenged a little bit\nmore by the theology and the philosophy \u00ad like suffering in the world.\nWhich in the last year was probably one of my major wake-up calls. Like,\nPreachers who are not believers\nhow can there be a living God with the world in the shape that it's in? But\nlooking back at it, I learned what I learned to get through so I could focus on\nthings. My intentions were the greatest and the purest.\nDuring the time when I was introduced --- even in undergraduate to textual\ncriticism --- looking at how we got the scriptures that we have, and the\ntextual variances. I just kind of learned what I needed to learn to pass the\ntest, and didn't really --- I mean, I thought, \"Well, how do we know what\nwas the right variant that was chosen that we now have as the scripture?\"\nBut I really didn't --- I had way too much going: I was too busy working\nfull-time and going to school, and a family, and small children.\nNow, when Adam thinks about leaving the ministry, one of the hardest things to\ncontemplate giving up is the rich community life that his religion has provided:\nI will say one strong aspect of any religion, I'd guess, that I've been in is the\ncommunity life. You have great friends who are close; you can depend on\nthem. When there's hard times, financially, emotionally, whatever, you've\ngot a support group.\nAnguishing about Change\nHe also fears for the effect leaving could have on his family, because his wife and\nteenage children are very religious. While he has conducted his current religious study\nsurreptitiously, he has expressed some of his changing views to his wife. At her urging, he\nhas been talking about it with an old seminary professor. However, their meetings have not\naffected Adam's changing ideas:\nHe's done everything he knows to do. He's prayed for me; he's shared with\nme. And I said, \"One of the fears is that I'm going to sway you, and you're\ngoing to lose your faith. If I see that happening, I'll back off.\"\nAdam does not want to make trouble in his friend's life or to let down the people in his\nchurch:\nAnd if they knew what I believe right now ... some would [be against me]\nand some would try to keep working with me, and minister to me, and help\nme.\nAt the same time, he thinks there could be a benefit to his church family knowing about\nhow he has changed:\nAnd the other part of me thinks: \"You know what? It'd be good for people\nto grow up and to think things through at least. If they decide to keep their\nfaith, that's fine. But if they don't, let's be real about it.\"\nBut he also wonders if he should leave well enough alone:\nPreachers who are not believers\nEven if Christianity isn't true, is it best to leave the people alone in their\nignorance? And I struggle with that feeling of superiority intellectually,\nwhich I've read all kinds of faith literature, and they say that's just a\nstruggle you've got to deal with. But is it better to leave them ---? And\nthey're happy, and they have hope in a life to come, and so it helps them\nthrough their suffering, which is a strong selling point of Christianity. You\nknow what I'm saying? I look at things a lot more in kind of a marketing\nform now.\nMeanwhile, he struggles through his job, hiding his beliefs:\nHere's how I'm handling my job on Sunday mornings: I see it as play\nacting. I kind of see myself as taking on a role of a believer in a worship\nservice, and performing. Because I know what to say. I know how to pray\npublicly. I can lead singing. I love singing. I don't believe what I'm saying\nanymore in some of these songs. But I see it as taking on the role and\nperforming. Maybe that's what it takes for me to get myself through this, but\nthat's what I'm doing.\nHe'd like to get out of this situation, but hasn't yet figured out how to do it:\nI'm where I am because I need the job still. If I had an alternative, a\ncomfortable paying job, something I was interested in doing, and a move\nthat wouldn't destroy my family, that's where I'd go. Because I do feel kind\nof hypocritical. It used to be the word \"hypocritical\" was like a sin. I don't\nhold that view anymore: there is goodness, and there is sinfulness; it's one\nor the other. It's black or white. That there's ultimate absolute truths that are\nmandated in scripture or given by a supernatural being. I don't see those\nanymore, so I use the word \"hypocritical\" differently, as in, I'm just not\nbeing forthright. But, at the same time, I'm in the situation I'm in, and\nrationally thinking about it is what I've got to do right now.\nHe considers himself an \"atheistic agnostic\" and wonders how non-believers fill the void\nleft by loss of faith, or even if they feel a loss. For his part, he says:\nI've got to the point where I can't find meaning in something that I don't\nthink is real anymore. I guess mostly inside I do toy with the fact that, \"OK,\nwhat's driving me to get up every morning?\" I used to be very devotional-\nminded. Get up, and maybe read a passage of scripture; say a prayer; ask\nGod to guide me through the day, totally believing that he would. Now it's\nlike, \"You don't have that.\" So there's a lack of guidance. But at the same\ntime I find it more free, where I create my own day.\nHe thinks of himself as being through with religion. He's not interested in a more liberal\nform of Christianity or in a non-supernatural concept of God:\nPreachers who are not believers\nI've thought I could stay in church work, and I could become more liberal.\nBut it's like, what have you become at that point? It's really like any other\norganization.... I mean, if you take God out of it, I don't understand why\nyou would go to the trouble of being religious.... If it's only your natural\nabilities, why mask it as something religious? Other than the fact you don't\nwant to make waves; you want to fit in with society without causing\nproblems for yourself.\nI don't see nature as a God; I just see nature as nature. I can admire the\nbeauty and the horror in it at the same time and don't have to cast a religious\ntone on it.\nRight now, he is still studying and wondering where it all will lead:\nHonestly, there's been times when I thought, \"You're going to drive\nyourself crazy dealing with all this.\" It's like, I just --- I get through it, kind\nof keep plugging along even though I don't know what is ultimately going\nto happen. So it's just kind of like --- take a day at a time; a week at a time.\nKind of look at certain things. Keep studying; keep my options open.\nJack, the Southern Baptist - A Bunch of Bunk\nJack, age 50, has been a Southern Baptist minister for 15 years, serving mainly as a\nworship leader in churches in various southern states. He has a bachelor's degree in\nreligion from a liberal Baptist Christian college and a master's in church music from a\nSouthern Baptist seminary. He's been married for 25 years and has three teen-aged\nchildren.\nHe was raised nominally Christian, but his parents, who were abusive to each other\nand their children, did not attend church. As a child, he did not know the basic tenets of\nChristianity and did not think of Christmas as a Christian holiday. He first became involved\nin church activities in high school at the invitation of a classmate. He stayed involved, as he\nput it, because of the love:\nMy attraction was the talk of love. So I said, \"OK, I'm going to go toward\nthis. I'm going to explore this. I want this. The greatest love of all.\" Who\nwouldn't want that, as a human? Especially one who had been deprived of\nit, of some of the basic needs of love, you know, from your parents.\nAbout 10 years ago, he decided to read through the Bible very carefully. He did this\ncompletely on his own, as a way to get closer to his faith. However, his study has had the\nopposite effect:\nThe pursuit of Christianity brought me to the point of not believing in God.\nNot that somebody did something mean to me. Let me tell you; ain't nothing\nanybody did in a church can compare to what my parents did to me, OK?\nPreachers who are not believers\nI didn't plan to become an atheist. I didn't even want to become an atheist.\nIt's just that I had no choice. If I'm being honest with myself.\nI've just this autumn, started saying to myself, out loud, \"I don't believe in\nGod anymore.\" It's not like, I don't want to believe in God. I don't believe\nin God. And it's because of all my pursuits of Christianity. I want to\nunderstand Christianity, and that's what I've tried to do. And I've wanted to\nbe a Christian. I've tried to be a Christian, and all the ways they say to do it.\nIt just didn't add up.\nThe love stuff is good. And you can still believe in that, and live a life like\nthat. But the whole grand scheme of Christianity, for me, is just a bunch of\nbunk.\nHe initially resisted his changing views:\nI wanted it to be true. And I kept telling myself, \"I don't understand.\" And,\nyou know, I devoted my whole life trying to understand. And finally I got to\nthe point where --- I've got to admit to myself this is how I feel. I can't\npretend any longer. You know, this is probably just --- I really started\ngetting this way probably in the last 10 years. Realizing, \"Hmmm, you know\nyou've really given this one a chance, OK?\" It's not like on a whim I\ndecided to do something that didn't work out. You know what I mean? I've\ngiven it a good chance.\nHe related numerous examples of biblical thought that did not make sense to him, for\nexample:\nOK, this God created me. It's a perfect God that knows everything; can do\nanything. And somehow it got messed up, and it's my fault. So he had to\nsend his son to die for me to fix it. And he does. And now I'm supposed to\nbeat myself to death the rest of my life over it. It makes no sense to me.\nDon't you think a God could come up with a better plan than that?\nWhat kind of personality; what kind of being is this that had to create these\nother beings to worship and tell him how wonderful he is? That makes no\nsense, if this God is all-knowing and all-wise and all-wonderful. I can't\ncomprehend that that's what kind of person God is.\nEvery church I've been in preached that the Jonah in the Whale story is\nliterally true. And I've never believed that. You mean to tell me a human\nwas in the belly of that whale? For three days? And then the whale spit him\nout on the shoreline? And, of course, their convenient logic is, \"Well, God\ncan do anything.\"\nPreachers who are not believers\nWell, I think most Christians have to be in a state of denial to read the Bible\nand believe it. Because there are so many contradicting stories. You're\nencouraged to be violent on one page, and you're encouraged to give\nsacrificial love on another page. You're encouraged to bash a baby's head\non one page, and there's other pages that say, you know, give your brother\nyour fair share of everything you have if they ask for it.\nBut if God was going to reveal himself to us, don't you think it would be in\na way that we wouldn't question?... I mean, if I was wanting to have ...\npeople teach about the Bible ... I would probably make sure they knew I\nexisted.... I mean, I wouldn't send them mysterious notes, encrypted in a\nway that it took a linguist to figure out.\nEven before he rejected belief in God, he rejected aspects of Christianity that didn't make\nsense to him:\nI do remember this a couple of years down the road after being a Christian \u00ad\nthis concept and idea of hell. I was going, \"Hell? What do you mean I was\ngoing to hell? Why? What's hell, and where is it?\" And I've never believed\nin hell. I just never bought it. There's a place where people go when they\ndie, and they burn eternally? No.\nThe whole heaven thing makes no sense either. Why would I want to walk\non streets of gold? I know people think that's literally how it's going to be.\nIf we have no value system in heaven, as far as monetary or value system\nlike we have here on earth, why would I want to walk on streets of gold?\nAnd I have people who believe they're going to have a physical body, and\nwe're going to be in the new Earth ... and we're not going to die, and we're\nnot going to grow old, and we're not going to have pain. Why? That all\nmakes no sense to me.\nSettling into the Ministry\nAfter traveling the country with a theater group, and marrying a woman of strong\nChristian faith, he decided to become a minister. It seemed like a natural fit. He and his\nwife were very involved in the life of the church, he felt he could make a special\ncontribution to the church through his musical abilities and he was known for being\nsensitive and compassionate.\nAnd that's what people told me my best skills were \u00ad dealing with people....\nI can be with somebody and genuinely have empathy with them, and\nconcern and love and help them get through a difficult situation. And every\ntime that I did it, those people thought that I was wonderful. And they would\njust bend over backwards to tell me, \"Thank you.\" That was one of my\nstrengths.... Being with somebody when their husband died. And just\nholding their hand, or putting my arm around them. But I never said \"Now,\nhe's in heaven. Aren't you glad for him?\"\nPreachers who are not believers\nHe felt the education he received in religion was high quality and objective, even though it\nwas limited to Christianity:\nYou know, where my degree says \"Religion\", it really should say\n\"Christianity\", because it wasn't a degree in religion because we did not\nstudy any other religion. But it still was an academic approach to\nChristianity rather than, \"You will believe this.\"\nLooking back on his education, he remembers other students being very upset about what\nthey were learning:\nWe had people that would cry in class because they were challenged on\nwhat they were thinking. And I'm going, \"That's what we're supposed to be\ndoing. Why are you so upset?\" I could never get that. And actually, some\nprofessors got in trouble because they challenged the students' belief\nsystems. Well, that's what it's about. That's part of what a philosophy class\ndoes.\nHe also recalls that he simply compartmentalized information that he didn't understand:\nI just attributed [biblical inconsistencies] to the fact that I didn't understand,\nand I compartmentalized it. I probably learned that as a child, because that's\na survival technique. You know, my parents are the source of all my pain,\nphysical, emotional, and otherwise. But then, they're my parents.\nOnce he was ordained, he took on the role of worship leader rather than pastor. This\nallowed him to focus on doing readings and music for the services. He much preferred this\nto preaching, which he has avoided as much as possible throughout his career:\nI didn't enjoy it [giving sermons] because of the issue of, \"OK, what am I\ngoing to talk about, and what I'm not going to talk about?\" This was very\ntricky.... I kept it very broad. And I didn't say, \"You've got to believe in\nJesus or you're going to hell.\"\nWhen I read a prayer, they're generic. They usually border on making\npeople feel good. You know, \"May we think these thoughts and do these\nkinds of things.\" I've never prayed out loud even, \"May all these people be\nsaved from hell.\" ... I like to leave them open to their own interpretation.\nOngoing Empathy for Believers\nWhile personally rejecting Christianity, he understands why others find it appealing\nand has no desire to change their views:\nI kind of understand where all those people are coming from. You know \u00ad of\nwanting to believe in God and wanting some higher power that's really\nPreachers who are not believers\nlooking after me. Especially me coming from the childhood that I had. I can\nunderstand that. It'd be nice if I had an omniscient big brother up there,\nwouldn't it? Saying, \"Don't worry about it. I got it covered. I know they\nwere mean to you. But don't worry; I'm going to take care of it.\" But that's\nnot reality. I wished it was God still, but it's not. I wished it was like that.\nI don't think less of them for being a Christian.... Matter of fact, I\nunderstand them, because I was there too.\nWell, I'm not going to go on a campaign to try to convince people to\nbecome an atheist. It's my journey.... Everybody has their own journey; and\nthis is my journey. And how I kind of look at it, I journeyed through it and\ncame here.\nStill, even when he was a believer, he had difficulty identifying with others' experience of\nGod:\n[People would say] \"I had this wonderful experience with God.\" I'd say, \"I\nwant that. Give it to me.\" Why didn't God ever give it to me? I think they're\nmaking it up in their mind. I never had one of those. I never heard God\nspeak. I don't know how many people, I can tell you, come up and told me,\n\"God told me to tell you this.\" I feel like saying, \"Well, I think he could\nprobably tell me himself, couldn't he? Because I've got my ear open.\"\nPlanning His Exit\nHe is firm about his decision to leave religion entirely, stating that, \"I took many\nyears making my mind up on this issue; I don't need to try another brand of it.\" He is\nplanning to leave the ministry as soon he finds another way to support his family. He would\nleave sooner, if he had enough money to pay off his debts:\nIf somebody said, \"Here's $200,000,\" I'd be turning my notice in this week,\nsaying, \"A month from now is my last Sunday.\" Because then I can pay off\neverything.\nIn the meantime, he is quietly pursuing another career. His wife is aware of his plan to\nswitch careers, but he hasn't told her yet of his reason for the change. He thinks she will be\nboth upset and supportive of whatever he wants to do. Mutual support has been the pattern\nin their marriage:\nI couldn't ask for a better wife. I was very fortunate. We get along great. We\nsupport each other, and always give each other words of encouragement,\nand just support each other in every way we can think about.\nShe doesn't need to hear this right now. It's not going to serve any of us. I\nfeel like when the time's right, I can talk to her about it. She won't like it,\nbut I will share it with her. And after I share it with her, I will start sharing it\nPreachers who are not believers\nwith other people. But she's going to be first. Because I know it's going to\nbe --- it's going to turn her life upside-down ... she's a very dedicated\nChristian. Very devout.\nHe thinks she is aware that he has been changing, but she doesn't press him about it and he\nhas no intention of trying to change her beliefs:\nI think she definitely sees me pulling away from it though. And we've talked\nabout it, but in very superficial ways. I don't get into details about it.\nI'm not going to try to force her to change her mind. And if she wants to\ncontinue to live her life that way, I'll be supportive of her. And I'm not\ngoing to try to demean her or belittle her or belittle her beliefs.\nHe thinks his children won't have a problem with his change in beliefs. They haven't\nseemed to notice or care that he no longer says prayers before meals. Recently, he was very\nopen with his son who asked him about some Bible passages:\nWe were talking about some scriptures in Revelation and some other things.\nHe said, \"Dad, do you really believe?\" Before I could think, I said, \"Son, I\ndon't believe any of it. No way.\" He just smiled.\nDiscussion\nThe not so tender trapi\nAll of our pastors were grateful for the opportunity to talk candidly about their\nquandaries with an interested outsider who would challenge and probe them without\njudging them. This was, in most cases, the first time in their lives that they could speak\naloud about these matters. As Wes said:\nSo it's been very helpful, and --- I was concerned at first that it might\nreawaken in me some of my old anxieties and depression about maybe I\nshouldn't be doing this for a living, and stuff like that. But it has not done\nthat. If anything, it's --- it's kind of convinced me that I'm over that stage in\nmy life.\nThe loneliness of non-believing pastors is extreme. They have no trusted\nconfidantes to reassure them, to reflect their own musings back to them, to provide reality\nchecks. As their profiles reveal, even their spouses are often unaware of their turmoil. Why\ndon't they resign their posts and find a new life? They are caught in a trap, cunningly\ndesigned to harness both their best intentions and their basest fears to the task of\nimmobilizing them in their predicament. Their salaries are modest and the economic\nincentive is to stay in place, to hang on by their fingernails and wait for retirement when\nthey get their pension:\nI think I'm doing it now because financially I don't have a choice. I could\nPreachers who are not believers\nquit and go in there today and say today, \"I'm not coming back.\" But it\nwould cause a huge financial burden on me. I mean, how would I continue\nto make my house payment and support my family? (Jack)\nPastors who are provided a parsonage to live in are even more tightly bound: they\nhave no equity to use as a springboard to a new house. But economic worries are not the\nonly, or even the primary, consideration, in the eyes of some of our five:\nBecause there have been times when I'd say, \"You know what? I'm just\ngoing to tell everybody, and whatever happens happens.\" And then I think,\n\"Gosh, I can't do that.\" I think I could handle it, but it's other people that\nI'm worried about.
