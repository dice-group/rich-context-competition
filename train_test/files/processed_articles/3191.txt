    "abstract": "Abstract\nAgainst the background of the recent housing boom and bust in countries such as Spain and\nIreland, we investigate in this paper the macroeconomic consequences of cross-border banking in\nmonetary unions such as the euro area. For this purpose, we incorporate in an otherwise standard\ntwo-region monetary union DSGE model a banking sector module along the lines of Gerali et al.\n(2010), accounting for borrowing constraints of entrepreneurs and an internal constraint on the\nbank's leverage ratio. We illustrate in particular how different lending standards within the\nmonetary union can translate into destabilizing spill-over effects between the regions, which can\nin turn result in a higher macroeconomic volatility. This mechanism is modeled by letting the loan-\nto-value (LTV) ratio that banks demand of entrepreneurs depend on either regional productivity\nshocks or on the productivity shock from one dominating region. Thereby, we demonstrate a\nchannel through which the financial sector may have exacerbated the emergence of macroeconomic\nimbalances within the euro area. Additionally, we show the effects of a monetary policy rule\naugmented by the loan rate spread as in C\u00fardia and Woodford (2010) in a two-country monetary\nunion context.\n",

However, the traditional view on financial globalization\nhas been significantly relativized since the 2007 global financial crisis (see e.g. Kose et al., 2009 for\na critical review). An alternative view stresses the importance of a potential link between finan-\ncial integration and the emergence of financial bubbles and, thus, macroeconomic instability due\nto overly optimistic growth expectations and excessive cross-border private and public borrowing\nThe increased financial integration among euro area countries, driven by the elimination of currency\nrisk, a fall in real interest rates in Southern European economies and the general economic integration,\nled to a surge in cross-border financial flows as shown in Figure 1. Given the well-known predominance\nof the banking sector in the European financial landscape, the expansion in cross-border financial\nactivities took place primarily in the form of bank-related capital flows (BIS, 2010; Kleimeier et al.,\n2013). While initially economic convergence processes within EMU seemed to be related to the\nincrease in financial integration, cross-border banking was also a driving factor for the credit booms\nand housing bubbles in some European countries such as Spain and Ireland, and thereby contributed\nto the build-up of intra-Eurozone current account imbalances (see e.g. Allen et al., 2011 and BIS,\nAgainst this background, we investigate in this paper the role of cross-border bank credit flows in\na two-region monetary union by incorporating a banking sector in an otherwise standard two-country\nDSGE framework. As the main contribution of the paper, we evaluate the macroeconomic conse-\nquences of cross-border banking under different lending standards. This is modelled by letting the\nloan-to-value (LTV) ratio that banks demand of firms as a measure of their creditworthiness depend\non either regional productivity shocks, or on the productivity shock from one dominating region. The\nlatter scenario, which we term rule-of-thumb banking, may capture the effect of interest rate conver-\ngence within EMU shown in Figure 1, where the elimination of currency risk effectively led financial\nmarkets to apply the low risk standards of the largest European economies throughout the whole\nmonetary union. Our model thus allows to evaluate the role of the financial sector for the transmis-\nsion and amplification of shocks throughout the monetary union. Following Gerali et al. (2010) and\nGambacorta and Signoretti (2014), the banking sector is assumed to consist of an international whole-\nsale branch, which underlies an exogenous constraint on the target leverage ratio, and regional retail\nReal Gross Capital Flows (mill.

As in Iacoviello\n(2005), entrepreneurs are subject to a financial constraint where credit is awarded relative to their net\nworth, weighted with banks' desired LTV ratio as a measure for firms' creditworthiness.\nCalibrating the model to the euro area, we first analyze the effect of a common monetary policy\nshock. Second, the nature of cross-border banking and trading flows in a monetary union with different\nLTV-based credit standards is evaluated. In the baseline scenario, bank's desired LTV ratio of firms\nis assumed to be constant and equal across regions. The baseline scenario may thus be regarded\nas capturing the case with symmetric information regarding firms' net worth in both regions. In the\nsecond scenario, the parameter follows an AR(1) process driven by regional-specific technology shocks.\nThereby, a positive technology shock not only affects firms' net worth directly, but also serves as a\nsignal for banks' assessment of firms' creditworthiness. Hence, in this scenario banks are assumed\nto suffer from asymmetric information which they attempt to recover using the technology shock as\na signal. The effect of the shock on bank lending is amplified, and via the trade links between the\nregions, the whole monetary union is affected. In the third scenario, we assume that there exists\none dominating region providing the signal for credit worthiness. This scenario may be regarded as\ncapturing convergence in short-run interest rates across EMU countries with the introduction of the\ncommon currency. Notably, macroeconomic volatility is highest in the third scenario.\nIn a nutshell, our simulation results highlight the role of cross-border lending not only as an\namplifying mechanism within a monetary union, but also as a potential source of macroeconomic\ninstability in the presence of asymmetric information. More precisely, while cross-border lending\namplifies the effects of exogenous shocks in all three considered scenarios, in the latter one \u00ad where\nthere is a dominant region which implicitly determines the lending standards for the whole monetary\nunion \u00ad cross-border lending also leads to the occurrence of business fluctuations driven purely by\nlaxer credit conditions, and not by macroeconomic fundamentals. Hence, the financial sector may\nwork to exacerbate the emergence of macroeconomic imbalances in a monetary union if banks assign\nlending standards from one dominating region to the whole monetary union. Analyzing possibilities\nfor monetary policy against this scenario, we find that a standard inflation targeting monetary policy\nrule augmented by an intermediate loan spread target may be beneficial for reducing the volatility\nof macroeconomic variables, an argument along the lines of the proposals by C\u00fardia and Woodford\nIn modern DSGE models, the financial sector has only more recently received more attention.\nWhile models accounting for a financial accelerator as in Bernanke et al. (1999) or Iacoviello (2005) are\nnow relatively common, most models do not feature a detailed banking sector. Recently, Gerali et al.\n(2010) set up a DSGE model with an imperfectly competitive banking sector subject to an internal\nleverage constraint and entrepreneurs facing a borrowing constraint. Estimating the model on euro\narea data, the authors report that shocks originating in the banking sector explain the largest share\nof the contraction of economic activity in 2008, while macroeconomic shocks play only a limited\nrole. A similar result is obtained in Kollmann et al. (2011) in an estimated two-country model for\nthe US and the euro area. In a simplified version of this model, Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014)\nanalyse whether monetary policy should also target asset prices or credit in the presence of borrowing\nconstraints on firms' side and a banking sector with a credit supply constraint. They show that\nleaning-against-the-wind policies by the central bank in reaction to supply side shocks allow for a better\ntrade-off between output and inflation stabilization. Hence, the authors reinforce the results obtained\nby C\u00fardia and Woodford (2010) in a much simpler model with exogenously introduced interest rate\nspreads. We extend the analysis in Gerali et al. (2010) and Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014) by\nevaluating the effect of borrowing and credit supply constraints in a two-region model of a monetary\nunion, allowing us to focus on spill-over effects of banking related shocks between the regions.\nMoreover, our paper is related to the three-country New Keynesian model analyzed in in 't Veld et al.\n(2014), which also focuses on the emergence of international capital flows in a monetary union like\nthe euro area. Specifically, in 't Veld et al. (2014) identify the following determinants for the recent\nboom-bust cycle in Spain: a) falling risk premia on Spanish housing and non-residential capital, b)\na loosening of collateral constraints for Spanish households and firms, and c) a fall in the interest\nrate spread between Spain and the rest of the euro area. Their approach differs from ours in that we\nmodel cross-border lending in an explicit manner through the specification of an international bank\nwith loan retail branches at the national level, and analyze the effects of changes in banks' assessment\nof firms' credit-worthiness across the monetary union.\nFinally, our approach is more broadly related to other two-region DSGE models of a monetary\netary and fiscal policy rules in a monetary union, the latter three papers focus more specifically on\nproblems related with fiscal policy in a monetary union, such as possibilities to improve inflation\ndifferentials with fiscal policy, or to use fiscal devaluation to counteract macroeconomic imbalances.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we set up a two-region DSGE\nmodel of a monetary union with a cross-border banking sector consisting of an international wholesale\nbranch and region-specific retail branches as in Gerali et al. (2010) and Gambacorta and Signoretti\n(2014). In section 3 we discuss the properties of the resulting theoretical framework, and analyze\nthe dynamic adjustments of the model's main variables to unexpected monetary policy and cost-push\nshocks, as well as the consequences of alternative specifications of the lending standards by the banking\nsector. In section 4 we investigate the design of monetary policy in such an environment. Finally, we\ndraw some concluding remarks in section 5.\n2 The Model\nWe consider a two-region monetary union populated by a continuum of agents on the interval [0, 1],\na segment [0, n] residing in a region labeled H(ome), and the other segment living in the other region\nlabeled F(oreign). We assume that Home is the risky region (the South, for the sake of illustration),\nand Foreign is the safe-haven region (the North, for the sake of illustration). There is no labor mobility\nbetween the regions. Both regions are assumed to produce tradable consumption goods, which are\nconsidered to be imperfect substitutes due to a standard home bias argument.1 Since we model a\nmonetary union, the nominal exchange rate between the regions is constant and may be normalised\nto one.\nHouseholds in both regions are infinitely-lived and have identical preferences and endowments within\neach region. Further, as in Iacoviello (2005) households are assumed to be more patient than en-\ntrepreneurs, that is, that they have a lower discount factor ( < E\n). As a result, households\npurchase a certain amount of new deposit contracts and entrepreneurs borrow a positive amount of\nloans in equilibrium. In other words, in equilibrium positive financial flows exist with households\nbeing net lenders and entrepreneurs being net borrowers. In order to render the model stationary, we\nfollow Schmitt-Groh\u00e9 and Uribe (2003) and assume that households face a small quadratic portfolio\nadjustment cost D when their deposits differ from the steady-state level D.\n1Capital letters denote indices, small letters denote single units.\nIn a standard manner, the utility maximization problem of households in Home (analogous ex-\npressions apply for the Foreign households) is given by\nmax Et\n\ns=t\ns ln CH\ns\n-\nNH\ns\nsubject to the real budget constraint\nCH\nt\n+ DH\nt\n=\nWH\nt\nPH\nt\nNH\nt\n+\nH\nt\n+\nD\nDH\nt\n+ H\nt\nwhere CH\nt\nrepresents the households' aggregate consumption bundle (to be defined below), NH\nt\nthe\nhouseholds' labour supply, DH\nt\nthe interest-earning deposits, H\nt\nt\nthe gross CPI inflation\nrate, Wt\nt\nthe real wage and H\nt\nthe real profits from retailers in H, which are paid in a lump-\nsum manner to households. Households thus maximize the expected present discounted value of\nintertemporal utility, which we assume to be separable in consumption and leisure. Households in\nboth Home and Foreign save in the form of bank deposits, earning a uniform deposit rate rd\nt\nwhich\nfor the sake of simplicity is assumed to be equal to the short-term interest rate controlled by the\nmonetary authority of the currency union.\nFrom the FOCs of this intertemporal optimization problem we obtain a consumption Euler equation\nand the standard labor supply equation:\nCH\nCH\nt\n= Et\nt\n)\nH\nt\n- D)\nand\nNH\nt\n\n=\nWH\nt\nCH\nt\nPH\nt\nAs the households in Foreign are assumed to have symmetric intertemporal preferences, we get\nanalogous expressions for the Foreign households:\nCF\nCF\nt\n= Et\nt\n)\nF\nt\n- D)\nand\nNF\nt\n\n=\nWF\nt\nCF\nt\nPF\nt\nFollowing Duarte and Wolman (2008) and Ferrero (2009), the aggregate consumption bundle in\nHome (analogous expressions hold for Foreign) contains region-specific goods bundles from both\nregions and is defined as\nCH\nt\n Ch\nt\n Cf\nt\n\n\nwhere Ch\nt\nand Cf\nt\nrepresent bundles of retail consumption goods i produced in Home and Foreign,\nrespectively,  denotes the elasticity of substitution between these two consumption bundles and the\nparameter H represents the steady-state import share of households in H. Given our assumption of\nhome bias in consumption, it holds that H < (1 - n).2\nNext, we determine the optimal allocation of total consumption expenditures of the representative\nhousehold across the regional good bundles Ch\nt\nand Cf\nt\n. This is derived from the point of view of a\nhousehold in H here, where analogous relations apply for households in F. Assuming that the law of\none price (LOP) holds, the price for identical bundles of goods will be the same in both regions. For\ninstance, Ph\nt\n= St\nPh\nt\n, where Ph\nt\nis the price of goods produced in H in terms of foreign currency\nand St\nis the nominal exchange rate. Since we model a monetary union, the nominal exchange rate is\nfixed at one and LOP implies Ph\nt\n= Ph\nt\nand Pf\nt\n= Pf\nt\n.\nHouseholds in region H first allocate consumption across individual retail goods, and then optimally\nchoose how to allocation consumption across bundles produced in region H and F. We assume that\nregion-specific bundles of retail goods i, produced in H and in F, are packed into consumption bundles\nCh\nt\nand Cf\nt\nwith the usual CES functions, adjusted for region size, where n is the size of region H, (1-n)\nthe corresponding size of region F and  denotes the elasticity of substitution between differentiated\nCh\nt\n\nn\nCh\nt\n(i)\n di\n\nCf\nt\n\nn\nCf\nt\n(i)\n\ndi\n\nThis gives the usual demand functions for individual goods:\nCh\nt\n(i) =\nn\nPh\nt\n(i)\nPh\nt\n-\nCh\nt\nCf\nt\n(i) =\nPf\nt\n(i)\nPf\nt\n-\nCf\nt\nwhere the retail price indices are defined as\nPh\nt\n\nn\nn\nPh\nt\ndi\nand Pf\nt\n\nn\nPf\nt\n(i)\ndi\n.\nConsequently, the cost minimization problem for the allocation of consumption across the region-\nspecific bundles of retail consumption goods produced in H and F gives the following demand func-\ntions:\nCh\nt\nPh\nt\nPH\nt\n-\nCH\nt\n2Note that the assumption of a symmetric steady state with equal per-capita output in the two regions implies that\nthe amount of home bias in both regions is related to the relative region size: F = n\nH .\n3When using consumers' demand functions to derive total demand for retailers' individual goods, we model the\nelasticity of substitution as a region-specific exogenous shock process. Thereby, a cost-push shock on retailers' mark-\nup may be introduced. To keep the model simple, we omit this assumption here and simply treat the elasticity of\nsubstitution as a parameter.\nCf\nt\n= H\nPf\nt\nPH\nt\n-\nCH\nt\nwhere PH\nt\nt\n+ H Pf\nt\ndenotes the CPI price index for region H. Given\nthe assumed home bias in consumption, the households' aggregate consumption bundles in Home and\nForeign and the corresponding price indices are not necessarily symmetric. In order to get rid of\nrelative prices, we can express everything in terms of trade. Terms of trade Tt\nare defined as follows:\nTt\n Pf\nt\n/Ph\nt\n. By expanding the expression for the CPI price indices in H and F, we thus derive:\nPh\nt\nPH\nt\nt\nPf\nt\nPH\nt\nt\nSimilarly, we get for relative prices in region F, assuming that the law of one price holds:\nPf\nt\nPF\nt\nt\nPh\nt\nPF\nt\nt\nFinally, in a monetary union with fixed nominal exchange rate the real exchange rate RERt\nis\ngiven by the relation of foreign to home CPI price indices:\n=\nPF\nt\nPH\nt\n= Tt\nt\nWe assume that production takes place in two stages. In the first stage, firms in region H and firms\nin region F produce the intermediate good Y h,int\nt\nand Y f,int\nt\nin fully competitive markets and under\ncredit constraints as in Iacoviello (2005). In line with Bernanke et al. (1999), we then assume that\nintermediate goods are sold to retailers, who take their price as given and differentiate them at no\ncost. Due to the differentiation of products, retailers are assumed to operate under monopolistic\ncompetition and face a quadratic cost for the adjustment of prices as in Rotemberg (1982). All profits\nfrom retail activities are rebated lump-sum to households in the respective region.\nEntrepreneurs in regions H and F produce intermediate goods Y h,int\nt\nand Y f,int\nt\nunder perfect compe-\ntition. Intermediate goods are used in the production of a final consumption good and are assumed to\nbe non-tradable. Entrepreneurs aim at maximizing their consumption and use capital goods and labor\nfor the production of intermediate goods. We assume that entrepreneurs consume only goods from\ntheir own region. At the end of each period, entrepreneurs buy new capital goods from capital produc-\ners, so that capital is only realized in the next period. Investment into new capital goods is assumed\nto be financed with loans from banks.4 Following Iacoviello (2005), we assume that entrepreneurs are\ncredit-constrained and thus can only borrow up to a fraction of their collateral, i.e. their capital assets.\nThe resulting dynamics are similar to a financial accelerator effect as in Bernanke et al. (1999). Note\nthat our assumption of a lower discount factor for firms ensures that the borrowing constraint will\nalways bind in the neighbourhood of the steady-state.\nEntrepreneurs in H thus maximize consumption CEH\nt\nsubject to their budget and their borrowing\nconstraints and to a Cobb-Douglas constant-returns-to-scale production function:\n\nt\nE\nln CEH\nt\ns.t.\nCEH\nt\n+\n)\nH\nt\nBEH\n+\nWH\nt\nPH\nt\nt\n+ qKH\nt\nKH\nt\n\nY h,int\nt\n\u00b5t\nt\n+ qkH\nt\n(1 - k)KEH\nBEH\nt\n\nmEqkH\n(1 - k)KEH\nt\nH\nt\nY h,int\nt\n= AH\nt\nKEH\n\nt\nwhere CEH\nt\nis entrepreneurs' consumption in H, BEH\nt\nis the amount borrowed from banks at the loan\nrate (1 + rbH\nt\n), NdH\nt\nis the amount of labor demanded by entrepreneurs, \u00b5t\n Ph,t\n/Ph,int\nt\ndenotes\nthe mark-up of retail over intermediate goods prices (we assume that the mark-up is the same in\nboth regions), KEH\nt\nis capital obtained at the price qkH\nt\nand depreciated with rate k. Entrepreneurs'\ndiscount factor E\nis assumed to be lower than households' , so that entrepreneurs are always net\nborrowers.\nThe borrowing constraint in (21) states that loans cannot exceed a fraction mE of the real de-\npreciated value of capital assets in relation to the interest obligations. The parameter mE may be\ninterpreted as the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio that banks demand of entrepreneurs and, thus, gives a\nmeasure of banks' assessment regarding firms' credit-worthiness. We assume that mE may vary across\nregions in the monetary union, reflecting different macroeconomic conditions and different assessments\nof firms' credit-worthiness by banks. While the baseline simulation assumes symmetric borrowing con-\nstraints in both regions, in section 3.4 we assume that the borrowing constraint parameter is either\naffected by the region's own technology shock, or banks may perceive one region's technology shock\nas dominant and apply restrictions to borrowing constraints in both regions.\n4This seems to be a reasonable assumption for a model of the EMU, since bank credit is the predominant source of\nexternal finance for European firms, see for instance Allen et al. (2011).\nFinally, the Cobb-Douglas production function gives output as a function of capital and labour\ninputs, where AH\nt\nis an exogenous technology process which may differ across regions. We define AH\nt\nas an exogenous AR(1) process with persistence parameter a\nand i.i.d. shock process AH\nt\n. Defining\nthe real return of capital as RkH\nt\nt\nt\n\u00b5t\nwe then get the following optimality\nconditions:\nCEH\nt\n- sB\nt\n=\nE\nt\n)\nH\nCEH\nqkH\nt\nCEH\nt\n=\nE\nCEH\n+ qkH\nsB\nt\nmEqkH\nt\nWH\nt\nPH\nt\n=\n(1 - )Y h,int\nt\nt\n\u00b5t\nEquation (23) gives entrepreneurs' Euler equation, where sB\nt\ndenotes the Lagrange multiplier on\nthe borrowing constraint and thus gives the marginal value of one unit of borrowing. The relation\nin (24) gives the optimal relation between entrepreneurs' consumption and real returns from capital,\ngiven the borrowing constraint. Finally, equation (25) shows that in the optimum, real wages equal\nthe marginal product of labor. Analogous optimality conditions hold for entrepreneurs in region F.\nAs in Gerali et al. (2010) and Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014), we assume that each period, cap-\nital production is undertaken by perfectly competitive capital producers, which are owned by en-\ntrepreneurs. These firms buy last period's depreciated capital stock from entrepreneurs as well as an\ninvestment It\nin the form of new final goods from retailers and use both to produce the new capital\nstock. In line with previous authors, we assume that old capital stock can be transformed one-for-one\ninto new capital stock, while investment from final goods underlies a quadratic adjustment cost for\nthe transformation into capital goods. At the end of the period, the resulting new capital stock is\nsold back to entrepreneurs. Since capital goods production takes place within each region, we only\ndescribe the problem for capital goods producers in H, but analogous relations hold also in F:\nDefining xH\nt\nt\n- (1 - k)KEH\n, capital goods producers then solve the following problem:\nmax\nxH\nt\nt\n\nEH\nk,t\nqkH\nt\nxH\nt\n- IH\nt\ns.t.\nxH\nt\nI\nIH\nt\nIH\nIH\nt\nwhere EH\nk,t\n k\nE\nt+k\n) = k\nE\nEH\nt+k\n, with k = 0, 1, ..., is the stochastic discount factor from en-\ntrepreneurs, who are assumed to own capital producing firms, and EH\nt\nis the Lagrange multiplier on\nentrepreneur's budget constraint. The capital adjustment cost is denoted by I, which we assume to\nbe equal across regions. The FOCs then yield an expression determining the price of real capital, qkH\nt\n:\nt\nI\nIH\nt\nIH\n- I\nIH\nt\nIH\nIH\nt\nIH\n+ E\nEt\nEH\nEH\nt\nqkH\nI\nIH\nIH\nt\nIH\nIH\nt\nRetailers in regions H and F buy intermediate goods Y h,int\nt\nor Y f,int\nt\nfrom entrepreneurs in a com-\npetitive market, taking their price Ph,int\nt\nor Pf,int\nt\nas given. These intermediate goods are then\ndifferentiated into final consumption goods at no cost, so that retailers operate under monopolistic\ncompetition. Additionally, they are assumed to face quadratic costs for the adjustment of prices as in\nRotemberg (1982). In our two-region model, retailers are symmetric, but face demand from consumers\nin both regions as well as from domestic entrepreneurs.\nAggregating over households and entrepreneurs, world demand for individual retail goods for retail-\ners in H is then derived from the demand equations of households and from entrepreneurs, measured\nin units per domestic firm. Note that we model the elasticity of substitution for individual goods\nproduced in H as a region-specific exogenous process H\nt\n. This gives the demand for individual good\nY h\nt\n(i), faced by a retailer in H (again, analogous relations apply for retailers in F):\nY h,total\nt\n(i) =\nP h\nt\n(i)\nP h\nt\n-H\nt\nP h\nt\nt\n-\nCH\nt\n+ F\nn\nP h\nt\nt\n-\nCF\nt\nt\nY h,total\nt\n(i) =\nP h\nt\n(i)\nP h\nt\n-H\nt\nt\n\nt\n+ F\nn\nt\n+ F\n\nt\nt\nY h,total\nt\n(i) =\nP h\nt\n(i)\nP h\nt\n-H\nt\nt\nwhere CWH\nt\ndenotes aggregate world demand for retail goods from region H and F, respectively, and\n is the share of entrepreneurs in the economy. Individual retailers in H set the price Ph\nt\n(i) for the\nindividual final good Y h\nt\n(i), and thus face the following maximization problem:\nmax\nP h\nt\n(i)\nEt\n\nHH\nk,t\nPh\nt\n(i)\nPh\nt\nY h,total\nt\n(i) -\nPh,int\nt\nPh\nt\nY h,total\nt\n(i) -\np\nPh\nt\n(i)\nPh\n(i)\nCWH\nt\nwhere HH\nk,t\n kU(CH\nt+k\n) = kHH\nt+k\n, with k = 0, 1, ..., is the stochastic discount factor from house-\nholds' utility maximization in H, h\nt\n= Ph\nt\n/Ph\ndefines retail price inflation and p\ndenotes the\nadjustment cost for changing prices. The maximization problem is subject to total demand for the\nfinal good as derived above:\nY h,total\nt\n(i) =\nPh\nt\n(i)\nPh\nt\n-H\nt\nCWH\nt\nImposing a symmetric equilibrium, this yields the following optimality condition:\nt\n+\nH\nt\n\u00b5t\n- p\nh\nt\nh\nt\nEt\nHH\nHH\nt\nCWH\nCWH\nt\nh\nh\nFinally, the exogenous process for the elasticity of substitution is related to retailers' mark-up mkH\nt\nin region H via the relation mkH\nt\n= H\nt\n/(H\nt\n- 1). We model retailers' region-specific mark-up as an\nAR(1) process with persistence mk\nand an i.i.d. cost-push shock Y H\nt\n.\n2.3 The Banking Sector\nFor our model of cross-border banking within a monetary union, we build on the work of Gerali et al.\n(2010) and Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014). The two papers present DSGE models with both\na collateral channel from entrepreneurs' credit constraint \u00e0 la Iacoviello (2005) and a credit-supply\nchannel stemming from a target for banks' leverage ratio, which may limit the supply of credit available\nfrom banks. We follow this approach and adjust the set-up of banks in the model to allow for cross-\nborder credit flows.\nSpecifically, we assume that there exists a representative bank in the monetary union, which con-\nsists of an international wholesale branch and national retail branches in each region of the monetary\nunion. The wholesale branch is responsible for collecting deposits from households throughout the\nmonetary union and distributes the resulting funds to the retail branches at the internal loan rates\nRbH and RbF . The retail branches then provide credit to entrepreneurs in their region of residence.\nNote that in this set-up, banks cannot endogenously create new credit. The wholesale branch is ad-\nditionally responsible for adhering to the exogenous constraint on the bank's leverage ratio, which is\nmodelled in the form of a quadratic cost of deviating from the target value . The value of  could\nfor instance be interpreted as reflecting regulatory legislation regarding banks' equity holdings. The\ncredit-supply channel thus introduces an additional feedback loop between real and financial condi-\ntions in the sense that the loan rates, as well as the spread between the loan rates and the risk-free\npolicy rate, depends on banks' leverage, their profit and, hence, on macroeconomic conditions. Finally,\nretail branches in H, F are assumed to operate under monopolistically competitive conditions, and\nthus charge a constant mark-up \u00b5b on the internal loan rate RbH, i.e. RbF .\nAggregate deposits in the monetary union and aggregate lending to entrepreneurs in both regions\nare defined as follows:\nDt\n nDH\nt\n+ (1 - n)DF\nt\nBt\nt\nt\n\n\nwhere BH\nt\nand BH\nt\ndenote the credit supply given to retail branches in region H and F, respectively,\nand  denotes the bank's elasticity of substitution between lending to both regions. We thus assume\nthat loans to the two regions are imperfect substitutes from the point of view of the bank, which may\nbe motivated with the notion of a historically more sound economic performance in one region (here\nthe North), as well as with differences in the credit screening capabilities in both regions. Note that\nwe assume no home bias in lending, because the wholesale bank is assumed to be international. In our\nset-up, the wholesale branch thus aims at maximizing profits subject to a quadratic cost for deviating\nfrom their target leverage ratio  and to their budget constraint:\nmax nRbH\nt\nBH\nt\n+ (1 - n)RbF\nt\nBF\nt\n- rd\nt\nDt\n-\n\nKb\nt\nBt\n- \nKb\nt\ns.t.\nBt\n= Dt\n+ Kb\nt\nBt\nt\nt\n\n\nwhere Kb\nt\nis the banks' own capital and the parameter  gives the proportion of Kb\nt\nto which the cost\nof deviating from target applies. The bank's leverage ratio and its budget constraint are determined\nwith respect to aggregate lending Bt\n. Solving the maximization problem gives the internal loan rates\nfor credit supply to retail branches in regions H and F:\nt\n rd\nt\nBt\nBH\nt\n\n \nKb\nt\nBt\n- \nKb\nt\nB\n\nt\nBH\nt\n\nt\n rd\nt\nBt\nBF\nt\n\n \nKb\nt\nBt\n- \nKb\nt\nB\n\nt\nBF\nt\n\nHence, extending the closed economy set-up in Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014) to the open\neconomy case, it turns out that both the effect of the risk-free deposit rate and of the leverage\nconstraint on the loan rate are weighted with the relative share of loan supply to the respective\nregion, adjusted for region size. This means that loan rates in a given region will be more sensitive to\ndeviations from the bank's leverage target and to changes in the policy rate if the wholesale branch\ndistributes a larger share of its overall credit supply to this region.\nAs in Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014), the retail banks are then assumed to be able to differenti-\nate the wholesale loans at no costs and pass them under monopolistic competition on to entrepreneurs,\ncharging a constant mark-up \u00b5b, which we assume to be equal across regions in the monetary union:5\nrbH\nt\n= RbH\nt\nrbF\nt\n= RbF\nt\n5This assumption implies that throughout the monetary union, the market structure among retail banks is similar.\nSince we assume that the representative bank acts internationally in both regions of the monetary union, this assumption\nseems reasonable.\nFinally, we define aggregate banks' profits Jb\nt\nas the sum of wholesale and retail profits and assume\nthat banks re-invest their profits into new bank capital, where a fraction b is used each period to pay\nfor banking activities:\nJb\nt\n= nrbH\nt\nBH\nt\n+ (1 - n)rbF\nt\nBF\nt\n- rd\nt\nDt\n-\n\nKb\nt\nBt\n- \nKb\nt\nKb\nt\n= (1 - b)Kb\n+ Jb\nThe central bank in the model controls the nominal risk-free interest rate rd\nt\nand adjusts to inflation\nas in Bernanke et al. (1998). Since we model a currency union, the central bank targets inflation in\nboth regions, where the weight is given by their relative size. This results in the following Taylor-type\nrule:\nt\n) = (1 + rd\nt\n+ (1 - n) F\nt\n\nrd\nt\nwhere  measures the amount of interest rate smoothing, \u00af\nrd the nominal steady state interest rate,\n\ngives the strength of inflation targeting and rd\nt\nis an i.i.d. monetary policy shock.\nEquilibrium in our model is defined by the resource constraints and market clearing conditions in all\nmarkets. These are given as follows for the goods market, the labor market and the banking sector,\nwhere Y k denotes aggregate output in region k:\nt\nt\n+ qkH\nt\nKEH\nt\n- (1 - )KEH\n+\nn\nbKb\nt\nt\n+ qkF\nt\nKEF\nt\n- (1 - )KEF\n+\nbKb\nnY H\nt\n+ (1 - n)Y F\nt\n= n CH\nt\nt\n+ qkH\nt\nKEH\nt\n- (1 - )KEH\n+(1 - n) CF\nt\nt\n+ qkF\nt\nKEF\nt\n- (1 - )KEF\nNH\nt\n= NdH\nt\nNF\nt\n= NdF\nt\nBEH\nt\n= BH\nt\nBEF\nt\n= BF\nt\nBt\n= Dt\n+ Kb\nt\nFinally, the model is log-linearized around the steady state and solved numerically using Dynare 4.4.3,\n3 Simulations\nFor the following simulations we follow Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014) and set our model param-\neters mainly as in Gerali et al. (2010), who calibrated their model so as to match key aspects of the\neuro area real and financial sectors. Additionally, some parameters relating to the open-economy\naspect of the model are calibrated as in the two-region model of the euro area of Engler et al. (2013).\nTable 1 reports all parameter values.6\nAccordingly, households' discount factor P\nis set at 0.996, which implies a steady-state policy\nrate of about 2 % (annualized). Entrepreneurs' discount factor E\n(2005). The inverse of the Frisch elasticity  is set at 1 as in (Gal\u00ed, 2008). The share of capital in\nthe aggregate production function  is set at 0.20, and the depreciation rate of physical capital (k)\nat 0.05 as in Gerali et al. (2010). The elasticity of substitution across regional goods bundles  is\nset at 2 as in Engler et al. (2013). Further, we set the adjustment cost for changing prices p\nat the\nvalue estimated by Gerali et al. (2010) for the euro area, namely 28.65. Concerning the investment\nadjustment cost parameter I, we set it at 5 as in Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014) in their analysis\nof their model's response to technology shocks.7\nThe required LTV ratio for entrepreneurs set by the retail bank branches, mE, is set at 0.35 in\nthe baseline case, which is similar to the average ratio of long-term loans to the value of shares and\nother equities for nonfinancial corporations in the euro area, see also Gerali et al. (2010) as well as\nGambacorta and Signoretti (2014). The target leverage ratio  and the cost for managing the bank\ncapital position b are set at 9% and 0.049, respectively, following again Gerali et al. (2010). Due to\nthe lack of a more direct measure, we set the bank capital adjustment cost  at 11, the value estimated\nby Gerali et al. (2010). The bank's elasticity of substitution between loans to Home and Foreign, ,\nis set equal to the elasticity of substitution between Home and Foreign goods bundles, , at 2. The\ndegree of monetary policy inertia is set at 0.77, and \nis set at 1.5, as it is standard in the literature.\nWe set the relative size of the Home and Foreign economies at 0.34 and 0.66, respectively, to\nreflect the asymmetric economic size of the regions within the euro area, assuming for the sake of\nillustration that Home represents the Southern euro area countries such as Spain, Italy, Portugal or\nGreece, and Foreign the Northern euro area countries, in particular Germany (see also Engler et al.,\n2013). Finally, we set the variance of the technology and the cost-push shocks equal to 1 percent as\n6We also considered estimating the current framework with disaggregated euro area data, but decided against it\nbecause a proper estimation of the cross-border banking effects at work here would be a task beyond the scope of this\npaper, due to their overlap with the global financial liberalization since the 2000s. We leave this for further research.\n7Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014) set I at 0.5 when analyzing cost-push shocks, but argue that when both tech-\nnology and cost-push shocks hit their model at the same time, their overall results are not affected by the choice of a\nTable 1: Calibration parameters\nParameter Description Value\nP\nE\n Elasticity of substitution between Home and Foreign goods bundles 2\nD Parameter for households' portfolio adjustment cost 0.001\nD Steady-state level of deposits 1\nH Steady-state import share in Home 0.33\nF Steady-state import share in Foreign 0.17\n Inverse of the Frisch elasticity 1\n Capital share in the production function 0.20\nk Depreciation rate of physical capital 0.050\nI Investment adjustment cost parameter 5\nmE Entrepreneurs LTV ratio 0.35\np\nAdjustment cost for changing prices 28.65\n Bank's elasticity of substitution between lending to both regions 2\n Bank capital adjustment cost 11\n Target capital-to-asset ratio 0.09\nb Cost for managing the bank's capital position 0.049\n\nInflation gap Taylor rule parameter 1.5\nmk\nPersistence of retailers' cost-push shocks 0.5\na\nPersistence of technology shocks 0.95\nmp\nVariance of monetary policy shock 0.1\nmk\nVariance of cost-push shock 1\na\nVariance of technology shock 1\nin Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014), and the variance of the monetary policy shocks equal to 0.1\npercent, reflecting qualitatively the relative size of the empirical estimates by Gerali et al. (2010).\n3.2 Monetary policy shock\nIn order to illustrate the different mechanism at work in the present framework, in the following we\ndiscuss the dynamic adjustments of the model's endogenous variables to an unexpected contractionary\nshock on the policy rate of the monetary union's central bank.\nMonetary Policy Rate\nLoan Rates\nSouthern\nNorthern\nSpreads\nSouthern\nNorthern\nAggregate Loans\nSouthern\nNorthern\nAggregate Investment\nSouthern\nNorthern\nAggregate Capital\nSouthern\nNorthern\nAggregate Consumption\nSouthern\nNorthern\nWages\nSouthern\nNorthern\nRetail Inflation\nSouthern\nNorthern\nCPI Inflation\nSouthern\nNorthern\nRER\nAggregate Output\nSouthern\nNorthern\nUnion-wide Deposits\nWholesale Bank Profits\nBank Capital\nFigure 2: Dynamic adjustments after a union-wide monetary policy shock. All rates are shown\nas absolute deviations from steady state, expressed in percentage points. All other variables are\npercentage deviations from their respective steady state levels.\nAs summarized in Figure 2, the unexpected increase in the policy rate of the monetary union's\ncentral bank affects both economies through a variety of channels. First, a contractionary shock to\nthe policy rate rt\nleads to an increase in the internal rate of interest between the wholesale and the\nregion-specific retail bank branches, and thus by extension also to an increase in the loan interest rates\nRbH and RbF offered to the entrepreneurs by the retail bank branches in the Southern and Northern\nregions, respectively. This pass-through effect from rt\nto RbH and RbF is larger than one, as the rise\nin the spread between the loan rate in both regions and the policy interest rate clearly illustrates. At\nthis point it is noteworthy that despite the fact that the initial shock in the policy rate affects both\nregions in an identical fashion, the reaction of loan interest rates, the loan spreads and by extension\nthe aggregate amount of awarded loans is, though qualitatively similar, quantitatively different in\nboth regions, with a larger effect on the spread in the Southern region. This rather unexpected result\narises from the different economic sizes assumed for both economic regions and the resulting different\nrelative shares of aggregate lending allocated to each region.8\nThe deterioration in the credit financing-conditions for firms leads to a decrease in the demand for\ncredit and thus in the amount of loans granted in equilibrium. This results in a reduction in the level\nof aggregate investment and by extension in the capital accumulation in both economies, as illustrated\nin Figure 2.\nThe increase in the policy rate leads of course also to a reduction in aggregate (both households'\nand entrepreneurs') consumption \u00ad by their respective consumption Euler equations \u00ad which, jointly\nwith the reduction in aggregate investment, leads to an overall decrease in current aggregate output,\nemployment and wages. Note that the effect of the monetary policy shock on aggregate output is\nvery similar across both regions despite larger differences in the effect on investment. This is because\naggregate consumption in our model is a relatively larger part of output compared to investment.\nThe reduction in households' wage income causes a net reduction in their bank deposits despite the\nincreased opportunity costs related with the increase in the deposit rate (which is assumed to be equal\nto the policy rate).\nFinally, as expected the increase in the policy rate causes a fall in both retail and CPI inflation in\nthe two regions. Since the LOP assumption holds, inflation in both regions reacts symmetrically to\nthe shock, even though the level of inflation may differ.\nTurning our attention back to the banking sector, the dynamic reactions of the wholesale bank's\nprofits JB\nt\nand capital Kb\nt\nillustrated in Figure 2 show clearly that while the reduction in the quantities\nof both deposits and loans affects the international wholesale banking sector negatively, the net effect\nof a policy rate increase is positive due to the larger increase in the internal and loan interest rates,\nleading to an increase in the bank's profits and capital.\nNext, we briefly discuss the dynamics resulting from an unexpected cost-push shock of one standard\ndeviation in the Northern region. Figure 3 summarizes the dynamics of the main variables of the\nmodel.\nAs can be clearly observed, an unexpected asymmetric cost-push shock in the Northern region\nleads to an immediate rise in both retail and CPI inflation in both regions, as well as to a relative\n(though very small in absolute terms) improvement in the competitiveness position of the Northern\n8Theoretically, if both regions were completely identical in their economic structure and had the same relative\neconomic size, i.e. n = 0.5, then the reactions would also be identical and no shift in relative prices would occur. This\nis indeed corroborated by our model when n is set at 0.5.\nLoan Rates\nSouthern\nNorthern\nSouthern\nNorthern\nAggregate Loans\nSouthern\nNorthern\nAggregate Investment\nSouthern\nNorthern\nAggregate Capital\nSouthern\nNorthern\nAggregate Consumption\nSouthern\nNorthern\nWages\nSouthern\nNorthern\nSouthern\nNorthern\nSouthern\nNorthern\nEntrepreneurs Consumption\nSouthern\nNorthern\nRetail Profits\nSouthern\nNorthern\nAggregate Output\nSouthern\nNorthern\nUnion-wide Deposits\nWholesale Bank Profits\nBank Capital\nFigure 3: Dynamic adjustments after a cost-push shock in the Northern region.

Note that since the LOP applies in our model, prices in both regions adjust symmetrically\nto the cost-push shock in the Northern region, even though the level of CPI inflation may differ due\nto the asymmetric region sizes. The standard countercyclical reaction of the monetary union's central\nbank implies a rise in the policy rate sufficient to yield an increase in the real interest rate. Again,\nthis effect is amplified via the banking sector, as the increase in loan rate spreads in both regions\nclearly illustrates. Note that the larger increase in the Southern regions' loan spread is again due to\nthe different region sizes.\nHowever, in the case of a cost-push shock occurring only in one region, here the North, only the\nNorthern region's economy is adversely affected by the shock. This may be observed by the drop in\nretail profits due to a fall in aggregate demand for retail goods produced in the Northern region (the\ninitial positive effect is because prices increase on impact, while demand is slower to adjust), leading\nto a fall in agregate consumption, wages, investment and output. By contrast, retail profits in the\nSouthern region increase, yielding a boom in the region. Therefore, even though loan spreads increase\nmore in the Southern region, entrepreneurs from the South are awarded relatively more loans.\nFinally, as in the case of a monetary policy shock, the banking sector profits relatively more from\nthe increase in loan spreads than from the drop in loans and deposits, so that overall banking profits\nand capital increase.\n3.4 Cross-Border Lending, Rule-of-Thumb Banking and Business Fluctuations\nHere we investigate the implications of cross-border banking for macroeconomic activity. Indeed, as\npreviously discussed (see also CIEPR, 2012), the recent experience of the housing boom-and-bust\ncycles in Spain and Ireland \u00ad which were financed to a large extent by cross-border capital flows\nfrom Germany \u00ad seems to suggest that cross-border lending may not have been subject to the same\nscreening standards for credit worthiness as internal lending, and that this practice may have thus\ncontributed decisively to the recent macroeconomic instability of those countries.\nIn order to model this phenomenon in the most parsimonious manner, we assume in the following\nthat the LTV borrowing constraint for entrepreneurs, captured by the parameter mE, is not constant\nas assumed in the previous sections, but that it follows a time-varying process driven by firms' region-\nspecific total factor productivity (TFP):\nmE,k\nt\n= (1 + \u00b5Ak\n) mE, k = {H, F} (53)\nwhere \u00b5  1 is a proportionality factor, assumed here to equal 0.65. While this is of course a\nconvenient modeling shortcut, the rationale behind this specification is straightforward: In the real\nworld, banks usually employ a screening mechanism to assess the profitability of the investment\nprojects to be financed, and thus the creditworthiness of the loan applicants. To reflect this, we\nassume that investment profitability is given solely by TFP. Under the assumption that TFP shocks\nare observable also by the banking sector, it is natural to assume that a positive TFP shock leads\nto a relaxation of the borrowing constraint imposed on the entrepreneurs by the banks. Obviously,\nthe determination of mE,k\nt\nwould be region-specific in the normal case, with the retail bank branches\nin Home and Foreign determining mEH\nt\nand mEF\nt\naccording to the observation of AH\nand AF\n,\nrespectively. We refer to this normal case as scenario 1 in the following.\nAlternatively, we consider an additional scenario where the lending standards in both countries\nregions are determined uniformly solely on the observation of TFP in the Northern region, i.e.\nmE,k\nt\n= (1 + \u00b5AF\n)mE, k = {H, F}. (54)\nThis alternative specification of mE,k\nt\nsolely as a function of AF\nis meant to represent the rule-of-\nthumb determination of lending standard in cross-border banking within the euro area discussed for\ninstance by Allen et al. (2011) and CIEPR (2012). In particular, this specification reflects the implicit\nrisk pooling associated with the establishment of monetary unions, and observable in the excessively\nlow sovereign risk premia of EMU countries and resulting interest rate convergence during the 2000s,\nsee e.g. De Grauwe and Ji (2012) and Proa\u00f1o et al. (2014). We term this scenario rule-of-thumb\nbanking or scenario 2.\nFigure 4 illustrates the dynamic adjustment of selected variables of our model under a constant\nLTV borrowing constraint (baseline scenario), varying region-specific lending standards (scenario 1),\nand rule-of-thumb lending standards (scenario 2). In all cases we assume a positive one-standard\ndeviation shock in TFP in the Northern region, AF\nt\n, leaving all other variables (and especially TFP\nin the Southern region) unchanged, as the first two graphs in the first column of Figure 4 show.\nTFP Productivity (Northern)\nBaseline\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nLTV Constraint (Northern)\nBaseline\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nTFP Productivity (Southern)\nLTV Constraint (Southern)\nBaseline\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nBaseline\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nLoan Rate Spread (Northern)\nAwarded Loans (Northern)\nBaseline\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nBaseline\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nLoan Rate Spread (Southern)\nAwarded Loans (Southern)\nBaseline\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nBaseline\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nWholesale Bank's Profits\nAggregate Investment (Northern)\nBaseline\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nBaseline\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nWholesale Bank's Leverage\nAggregate Investment (Southern)\nBaseline\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nBaseline\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nAggregate Consumption (Northern)\nAggregate Output (Northern)\nBaseline\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nBaseline\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nAggregate Consumption (Southern)\nAggregate Output (Southern)\nBaseline\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nBaseline\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nFigure 4: Dynamic adjustments to a positive TFP shock in the Northern region under constant\n(baseline), region-specific (scenario 1) and rule-of-thumb (scenario 2) lending standards. All rates are\nshown as absolute deviations from steady state, expressed in percentage points. All other variables\nare percentage deviations from their respective steady state levels.\nAs further shown in Figure 4, a positive shock to TFP in the North leads to an expansion in\naggregate income, consumption and investment in that region, the latter being partly financed by\nan expansion of lending to the entrepreneurs by the banking sector over time. Note that this credit\nexpansion takes place also in the baseline case where mE,k = const., but is of course larger in magnitude\nin the two alternative scenarios, where mE,k is a direct function of TFP in the Northern region. Due\nto the higher aggregate income in the North, there is also a higher demand for goods produced\nthere which requires an expansion of the capital stock and thus in the production capabilities of the\nregion. This effect takes place in all three scenarios, but is of course largest in scenario 2, where the\nLTV borrowing constraint (assumed to be a function of the observed TFP in the Northern region) is\nrelaxed not only in the Northern economy (where indeed an increase in TFP took place), but also in\nthe Southern region. As the graphs in the last row in Figure 4 show, aggregate economic activity in\nboth regions is significantly larger \u00ad particularly in the first periods after the shock \u00ad in scenarios 1\nand 2 relative to the baseline scenario.\nAnalyzing the different effects on dynamic adjustments in the Southern economy in the different\nscenarios allows to distinguish between spill-over effects via the trade linkages and the additional\neffect of rule-of-thumb banking assumed in scenario 2. These emerge specifically with respect to loans\nawarded to entrepreneurs and, thus, investment. As the South is awarded the same relaxation in\nborrowing conditions than the North in scenario 2, both loans and investment increase more rapidly.\nFinally, both aggregate consumption and output increase by more with time-varying LTV ratios,\nalthough there are only marginal differences between scenario 1 and 2. Overall, the comparison\nbetween scenarios 1 and 2 shows that with rule-of-thumb banking additional business cycle dynamics\noccur in the Southern region, which are solely related to relaxations in credit availability, and not\nbacked by macroeconomic fundamentals.\nLoan rate spreads decrease in both regions following the increase in loans awarded after the North-\nern TFP shock, whereas the effect is relatively larger in the Southern region. In both regions, the effect\nbecomes stronger over time as the bank adjusts the borrowing constraint to changes in productivity.\nSince credit expands at the same time, we observe again that \u00ad as in the previously discussed cases of a\nmonetary policy or cost-push shock \u00ad price effects (in this case changes in loan rate spreads) dominate\nover quantity effects (i.e. loans awarded), resulting here in a negative effect of the TFP shock on the\ninternational wholesale bank's profits. Further, as it can be clearly observed in Figure 4, the reduction\nin the bank's profits increases ceteris paribus the wholesale bank's leverage, as a higher quantity of\nawarded loans goes hand in hand with lower profits and, by extension, lower bank capital, see eq. (43).\nThis result is particularly noteworthy as it implies that cross-border rule-of-thumb banking leads to\na higher leverage in the financial system, and thus to a more fragile macrofinancial situation.\nIn order to assess the effects of this alternative specification of the LTV borrowing constraint for\nthe business cycle dynamics of the model, we report the theoretical first and second moments of the\n(logarithms of the) main variables of the model in Table 2.\nTable 2: Theoretical First and Second Moments (of the logarithms of the variables)\nMean Variance\nVariable Baseline Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Baseline Scenario 1 Scenario 2\nCH\nt\nCF\nt\nWIH\nt\nWIF\nt\nDt\nIH\nt\nIF\nt\nKH\nt\nKF\nt\nBH\nt\nBF\nt\nBt\nKb\nt\nKb\nt\n/Bt\nJb\nt\nrd\nt\nspreadH\nt\nspreadF\nt\nt\nt\nH\nt\nF\nt\nTt\nAs can be observed there, there is no significant variation in the theoretical means of the reported\nvariables across the three scenarios just analyzed, notable exceptions being the means of aggregate\ninvestment IH\nt\nand IF\nt\n, the amount of loans awarded to the entrepreneurial sector BH\nt\nand BF\nt\n(and by\nextension, Bb\nt\n), as well as the aggregate amount of households deposits Dt\n, which feature a significant\nincrease due to a varying LTV constraint, either as determined by eq. (53) or by eq. (54). In other\nwords, a varying LTV constraint linked to the development of TFP in the entrepreneurial sector leads\nto a larger amount of awarded loans and aggregate investment in both economies, and thus in the\nmonetary union.\nThis rather small level effect of the endogenization of the LTV ratio through eq. (53) and eq. (54)\nat the macroeconomic level is, however, relativized when taking a look at the second moments of the\nmodel's main variables. Indeed, as reported in the last three columns of Table 2, the volatility of\nnearly all variables (the only exceptions being the real exchange rate RERt\nand the terms-of trade\nTt\n) is significantly larger in the two scenarios 1 and 2 in comparison to the baseline scenario, being\nmarginally larger in the second scenario in the great majority of cases.\nSumming up, the numerical results discussed in this section suggest that cross-border lending\nactivities, especially with time-varying and potentially cycle-enhancing borrowing constraints, can\ncontribute to the magnification of macroeconomic fluctuations. This may eventually lead to sudden\nbusts as was the case in Spain and Ireland. Further, they highlight the need of a strict regulation\nof the financial system and the lending standards, in particular given the perfect mobility of capital\nwithin monetary unions such as the euro area.\nNonetheless, it could be possible that monetary policy could support such regulatory efforts by\nthe appropriate design of a monetary policy rule. Indeed, recent theoretical studies within the DSGE\nmodeling paradigm have shown that the incorporation of the banking sector \u00ad and the explicit modeling\nof interest spreads \u00ad has important consequences for the design of monetary policy, see for instance\nGambacorta and Signoretti (2014). In the next section we thus address this question.\n4 Is there a role for monetary policy in stabilizing the effects of cross-\nborder banking?\nDespite the highly stylized formulation of the banking sector in our model of a monetary union, the\nsimulation exercises of the previous sections clearly illustrate how cross-border lending can act as an\namplifying factor in the business cycle fluctuations within monetary unions, especially when lending\nstandards are not adequately determined at the regional level. In this context, the obvious question\nis: What are the consequences of cross-border lending for the conduction of monetary policy? Or, in\na more plain wording: Can monetary policy alleviate some of the destabilizing effects of cross-border\nbanking?\nSince we model a banking sector (both wholesale and retail branches) with monopolistic power as\nin Gerali et al. (2010) and Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014) in the present theoretical framework,\nmonetary policy has only imperfect control of the effective loan interest rates at the regional level.\nHowever, in contrast to these studies which analyzed only closed economies, in the present paper\nwe explore the open-economy, union-wide implications of such a modeling approach for the banking\nsector in the presence of trade links and cross-border banking. In other words, our framework allows\nus to investigate how monetary policy should be conducted in the presence of an imperfect interest\nrate pass-through to the monetary union sphere.\nIn order to address this imperfect pass-through problem, recent studies introducing a bank-\ning sector into the DSGE model such as C\u00fardia and Woodford (2010), Gertler and Karadi (2011),\nGoodfriend and McCallum (2007) and Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014) have proposed incorporat-\ning the spread between the loan and the policy rate in an otherwise standard monetary policy rule.\nIn our framework, this implies including the loan rate spreads in both regions H and F, namely\nrbH\nt\nand rbF\nt\n\u00ad weighted by the respective relative regional sizes \u00ad in eq. (44), delivering\nt\n) = (1 + rd\nt\n+ (1 - n)F\nt\n\nn rbH\nt\n+ (1 - n) rbF\nt\n- rd\nt\ns\nrd\nt\nas n rbH\nt\n- rd\nt\n+ (1 - n) rbF\nt\n- rd\nt\n= n rbH\nt\n+ (1 - n) rbF\nt\n- rd\nt\n, where s\nrepresents the reaction\nparameter of the policy rate to increases in the weighted average of the loan rate spreads in the two\nmonetary union regions.\nIn Figure 5 we show the variances of the key model variables as functions of different values of\nthe monetary policy parameters \nand s\nunder the scenario 2 specification of the LTV borrowing\nconstraint discussed in the previous section. The purpose of this exercise is of course to analyze the\neffects of implementing an unconventional monetary policy rule as discussed in the recent literature.\nFigure 5 contains a variety of important results. To begin with, it is interesting to note that the\nvariances of all reported variables are nonlinear functions in \nand s\n, as the irregular shape of the\nsurfaces indicate. Nonetheless, a common feature of all variances is that they decrease in \nfor all\nconsidered values of s\n. This underlines the common notion that inflation targeting is key for the\nstabilization not only of inflation, but for the other key macroeconomic variables as well.\nIn contrast, the relationship between macroeconomic volatility and s\nis less straightforward. On\nthe one hand, concerning aggregate output in the Southern and Northern regions, the graphs in Figure\n5 show that the incorporation of the unconventional term s\n( \u00b7 ) in the monetary policy rule, i.e. the\nswitch from s\n= 0.05, leads to an increase of the output variance in the two economies.\nHowever, for \nleads to a small decrease in Y H\nt\n's variance, but\nnot in Y F\nt\n's. As the graphs concerning aggregate consumption and investment illustrate, this effect\nresults primarily from the reaction of consumption volatility to these parameter changes. By contrast,\nit is particularly noteworthy that higher values of s\nlead to a lower volatility of aggregate investment\nin both Southern and Northern regions for rather low values of \nand s\n, i.e., when monetary policy\ntargets inflation with the strength commonly assumed (\n= 1.5) and reacts only with about s\nto changes in loan rate spreads. Note that this effect is more pronounced regarding investment in the\nSouthern region.\nFurther, the dependence of the loans' variance with respect to s\nis also worth being highlighted,\nas it demonstrates in a clear manner that this type of unconventional monetary policy works to\ncontribute to macroeconomic stabilization through the reduction in the amount of (eventually desta-\nbilizing) cross-border lending. Similar to the effect on aggregate investment, we observe in Figure\n5 that a medium reaction to interest rate spreads with s\nvolatility of loans if the central bank targets inflation with \n= 1.5. Finally, at the usual inflation\ntargeting parameter our results show that a mild reaction to interest rate spreads will also stabilize\n\ns\nSouthern Output\n\n\n\ns\nSouthern Consumption\n\n\n\ns\nSouthern Investment\n\n\n\ns\nNorthern Output\n\n\n\ns\nNorthern Consumption\n\n\n\ns\nNorthern Investment\n\n\n\ns\nSouthern Inflation\n\n\n\ns\nSouthern Loans\n\n\n\ns\nNorthern Inflation\n\n\n\ns\nNorthern Loans\n\n\nFigure 5: Theoretical Variances of Key Model Variables for \ninflation further. Overall, our results thus corroborate the findings in C\u00fardia and Woodford (2010)\nand Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014) also in an open-economy monetary union setting.\n5 Concluding Remarks\nWhat are the macroeconomic consequences of cross-border banking and a rule-of-thumb determination\nof lending standards? In this paper, we try to shed some light onto this and other questions by setting\nup a two-region DSGE model of a monetary union featuring a banking sector along the lines of\nGerali et al. (2010) and Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014), allowing us to differentiate the effects of\ncross-border lending from the standard trade links of two interacting economies in a monetary union.\nAgainst the background of the recent credit-fuelled housing booms and busts experienced in some\neuro area countries such as Spain and Ireland, we investigate the macroeconomic consequences of asym-\nmetric rule-of-thumb lending standards applied in a cross-border manner. Specifically, we compare a\nscenario where the LTV ratio that banks demand of entrepreneurs depends on regional productivity\nshocks to a scenario where desired LTV ratios are driven by productivity shocks from one dominating\nregion, thereby relaxing borrowing constraints for all firms after a positive technology shock in that\nregion. The latter scenario is motivated by the observation of converging real interest rates after the\nstart of the European monetary union, with a corresponding increase in cross-border capital flows as\nfinancial markets applied the low risk standards of the Northern region throughout the whole mone-\ntary union. Our simulation results suggest that such type of cross-border lending practices amplifies\nthe effects of a region-specific technology shock in both regions of the monetary union, leading to\nbusiness fluctuations in the other country generated by the relaxation of lending standards, and not\nby corresponding changes in macroeconomic fundamentals. Furthermore, such developments lead\nto a significant increase in the volatility of all main macro variables in both regions of the monetary\nunion. We thus show that under certain conditions the financial sector may exacerbate macroeconomic\nimbalances originating via the trade channel within the monetary union.\nGiven the significant effects that such a larger aggregate volatility implies both in macroeconomic\nand social terms, our results suggest that macroeconomic policy (both fiscal and monetary) concerned\nwith stabilizing the regions within a monetary union should pay attention to the nature of cross-border\nlending within the union, especially if banks do not assign region-specific lending standards. Further,\nour simulation results indicate that a central bank adjusting to changes in loan spread rates with a\nrelatively small coefficient may enhance macroeconomic stability in the face of rule-of-thumb cross-\nborder banking. This effect, however, may not replace a tighter regulation and standardization of\nlending practices across the monetary union intended to reduce destabilizing capital in- and outflows\nbetween the regions within monetary unions such as the euro area.\nReferences\nAdjemian, S., H.
