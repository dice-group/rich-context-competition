A conceptual model of payment behavior is developed and\ntested using data from a cross-sectional survey of households in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana (GARG) and the billing\nrecords of Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL). Among the constructs considered in the analysis, service quality,\ncorporate image, and monitoring and control are found to be the major determinants of customer satisfaction toward the\nwater utility, which in turn, together with the direct influence of monitoring and control measures and transaction time at\nbill payment points, explains a significant part of the total variation in water customers' bill payment behavior. We provide\nin-depth discussion and policy implications of our findings.\n",

In particular, water is needed for food, energy,\nand industrial production (United Nations Water [UN-Water],\nimportance of water to people, it is estimated that by 2050, at\nleast one in four people, especially in developing countries,\nwill be affected by infrequent water supply (Marson & Savin,\n2015; United Nations Development Programme [UNDP],\n2016)--a situation that will potentially undermine people's\nhealth and dignity, and consequently exacerbate the already\nprecarious economic conditions in those countries.\nIn recognition of this looming danger, the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly in its recently adopted sustainable devel-\nopment agenda, known as the Sustainable Development\nGoals (SDGs), correctly sets out to \"ensure availability and\nsustainable management of water and sanitation for all\"\n(SDG 6; UNDP, 2015). However, until the much-needed\ninvestments are made in the water sectors of developing\ncountries, this goal is unlikely to be met. For example, the\nUNDP (2015) reports that, until adequate investments are\nmade in water infrastructure, it will be difficult for water\nutilities to ensure universal access to safe and affordable\nWater utilities in developing countries are often capital\nconstrained, and hence, their service provisions as well as\nrequired investment in infrastructure largely depend on cus-\ntomers' patronization as reflected in their timely payment of\nwater bills. If customers default on their payments and/or are\nunable to pay their bills in a timely manner, the water utilities\nin these countries are more likely to face serious cash flow\nproblems in maintaining sustainable water services (Sualihu\n& Rahman, 2014b). In this backdrop, it is imperative that\nwater utilities fully appreciate the factors that affect the\npatronage behavior of their customers to avoid delayed or\nirregular payment of water bills. However, little empirical\nresearch exists in the literature investigating the factors influ-\nencing customer decisions when it comes to paying water\nbills in time (Mugabi, Kayaga, Smout, & Njiru, 2010). In this\narticle, we aim to contribute to this strand of the literature by\n1Monash University, Caulfield East, Victoria, Australia\n2North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh\n3Alijos Consultancy Services, Konongo, Ghana\nCorresponding Author:\nMohammed Aminu Sualihu, Monash University, Monash Business School,\nEmail: mohammed.sualihu@monash.edu.au\nThe Payment Behavior of Water Utility\nCustomers in the Greater Accra Region\nof Ghana: An Empirical Analysis\nMohammed Aminu Sualihu1, M. Arifur Rahman2,\nand Zakiya Tofik-Abu3\n Keywords\nbill payment behavior, water utility, attitudinal factors, institutional factors, Ghana, Africa\n2 SAGE Open\nanalyzing the influence of a set of attitudinal and institutional\nfactors on the bill payment behavior of water utility custom-\ners of Ghana, a lower middle-income country.\nFollowing the lead from the service marketing literature,\nprevious studies (viz., Kayaga, Franceys, & Sansom, 2004)\nhave tried to understand the effect of different attitudinal vari-\nables such as service value, service quality, corporate image,\nand customer satisfaction on customers' loyalty toward water\nutility and their bill payment behavior. However, in the con-\ntext of the theory of planned behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991),\nMugabi et al. (2010) suggest that, in addition to customers'\ngeneral attitude toward bill payment, some service issues that\nare largely within the control of water utility managers may\nalso affect their timely bill payment. Therefore, our approach\nin this article is more integrated, in the sense that, we study\nthe effect of some key attitudinal variables and service issues\n(which are mainly institutional in nature) simultaneously to\nunderstand the variation in water customers' bill payment\nbehavior. To this end, we first undertake a review of related\nliterature to identify a set of important attitudinal and institu-\ntional constructs that is not only potentially useful in explain-\ning the actual payment behavior but also quite amenable to\nthe influence of the water utility. The rationale for these selec-\ntion criteria is that, by isolating the factors under its influence,\nthe water utility would be able to implement more realistic\nstrategies to promote timely bill payment. Subsequently,\nbased on the background knowledge from the literature, we\npropose and test a conceptual relationship among the factors\nconsidered in the study.\nLiterature Review\nA water utility's failure to collect bills on a timely basis may\nresult from a range of factors; some of which may be viewed\nas entirely under the control of the utility (such as the billing\nissues and monitoring and control activities), some only par-\ntially under the control of the utility (such as the willingness\nof water customers), and some others completely beyond the\ncontrol of the utility (such as the social and demographic\nprofile of the customers). To be consistent with the focus of\nthe study, this section reviews related literature that helps\nidentify some factors that a water utility may influence at\nleast to some meaningful extent.\nCustomer Satisfaction and Behavioral\nIntentions\nCustomer satisfaction is a consequence of purchase and con-\nsumption arising from the buyer's comparison of the rewards\nand costs of the purchase in relation to the expected conse-\nquences (Bolton & Drew, 1991). Customers are able to tell\nwhether or not they are satisfied with a product by comparing\nthe benefits they get from using the product relative to its\ntomer satisfaction or dissatisfaction arises from the difference\nbetween prior expectations and actual performance (Oliver,\nformance appraisals, and disconfirmation are possible deter-\nminants of customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction, and\nconclude that customers' assessments of continuously pro-\nvided services, such as water utilities, may depend on only\nperformance evaluations. Therefore, in the context of this\nstudy, we measure customer satisfaction based on the custom-\ners' evaluation of the performance of the water utility.\nIn a comprehensive study on the relationship among and\nbetween the major consumer judgmental constructs in the\ncontext of a service industry, Cronin, Brady, and Hult (2000)\nshow that customer satisfaction is positively associated with\nbehavioral intentions. The authors' findings are borne out by\nthe results of several other prior and subsequent studies on\ncustomer satisfaction and various indicators of behavioral\nintentions such as customer loyalty, repurchase intention,\nand switching behavior (e.g., Andreassen & Lanseng, 1997;\nSharma, 2013). Therefore, in the context of a utility com-\npany, it may be argued that the more consumers are satisfied\nwith service provision, the more likely they are to pay their\nbills on time. Sualihu and Rahman (2014b) conclude that\nhigher customer satisfaction is associated with higher bill\npayment. As such, it is hypothesized that customer satisfac-\ntion is likely to be positively associated with customers'\nbehavioral intentions, ceteris paribus.\nService Value and Customer\nSatisfaction\nIn her exploratory study, Zeithaml (1988) suggests that \"per-\nceived value is the customer's overall assessment of the util-\nity of a product based on perceptions of what is received and\nwhat is given\" (p. 14). If perceived service is comparable\nwith the concept of perceived product value, then service\nvalue can be considered to involve the trade-off between a\ncustomer's evaluation of the benefits of using a service and\nits cost (Bolton & Drew, 1991). Whereas the benefits are\nmade up of physical attributes, service attributes, and techni-\ncal support available from the supplier, the costs are the sac-\nrifices the consumer makes when making the purchase\nGiven that service value is crucial for customers in all\nsuccessful exchange transactions (Holbrook, 1994), other\nthings remaining unchanged, customer perception of\nimproved value in a service encounter is expected to lead to\nincreased customer satisfaction and more favorable behav-\nioral intentions. In line with this argument, Brand, Cronin,\nand Routledge (1997) conclude that there is a positive cor-\nrelation between service value and customer satisfaction.\nSimilarly, Cronin et al. (2000) also present evidence of the\nrole of service value as a causal antecedent of customer sat-\nisfaction. In addition, because perceived benefits from using\na service are likely to be influenced by service quality\nSualihu et al. 3\nattributes, some studies also emphasize the role of service\nvalue as a mediating variable in the relationship between ser-\nvice quality (discussed shortly) and customer satisfaction\n(e.g., Bolton & Drew, 1991; Lee, Lee, Lee, Park, & Moon,\n2004). Thus, service value is likely to influence customer\nsatisfaction positively, ceteris paribus.\nService Quality and Customer\nSatisfaction\nMuch of the research on customers' attitude toward services\nhas focused on perceived service quality (e.g., Dabholkar,\nquality is seen as a customer's assessment of the overall\nexcellence or superiority of the service (Zeithaml, 1988).\nAccordingly, perceived service quality is the degree to which\na service meets or exceeds customers'expectations. Following\nKayaga et al. (2004), we use a blend of technical quality and\nfunctional quality indices to measure service quality. Whereas\ntechnical quality is what a customer receives in his or her\ninteraction with the service firm, functional quality describes\nhow service is delivered to the consumer.\nThere seems to be a broad consensus emerging in the ser-\nvices management literature that service quality is a major\ndeterminant of overall customer satisfaction. Indeed, numer-\nous studies document a significant positive relationship\nbetween these two judgmental constructs in the context of, for\nexample, the commercial airline industry (Ostrowski,\nO'Brien, & Gordon, 1993); a variety of consumer service\nthe banking, pest control, dry cleaning, and restaurant ser-\nvices (Cronin & Taylor, 1992); the photographic services\n(Dabholkar et al., 2000); the professional accounting services\n(Hong & Goo, 2004); and the university library services\n(Wang & Shieh, 2006). We are not, however, aware of any\nstudy in the context of water utility services that empirically\ntests the effect of customers'service quality judgment on out-\ncome variables such as satisfaction and subsequent behav-\nioral intentions. Therefore, service quality is more likely to\npositively influence customer satisfaction, ceteris paribus.\nCorporate Image and Customer\nSatisfaction\nCorporate image is the way an organization is presented to or\nperceived by its members and the public (Andreassen &\ncan be aided by the information (communications) provided\nby the firm, as well as managerial attitudes and philosophy.\nAccordingly, it enables a company to engage more effec-\ntively in maintaining and improving the relationship with its\ncustomers, and thereby helps to improve customers' attitude\ntoward the company. An improved customer attitude is\nexpected to reflect favorably on customer satisfaction and\nbehavioral intentions.\nSrivastava and Sharma (2013) report a positive associa-\ntion between corporate image and customer satisfaction in\nthe context of Indian telecommunication industry, suggest-\ning that higher corporate image results in a greater customer\nsatisfaction, which in turn leads to high repurchase intention\nand less switching behavior. Similarly, Richard and Zhang\n(2012) also report that corporate image has a positive effect\non customer commitment and customer satisfaction in the\nNew Zealand travel service industry. Thus, in this study, cor-\nporate image is likely to positively influence customer satis-\nfaction, ceteris paribus.\nBilling Issues and Payment Behavior\nMost utility companies provide bundle of services to their\nclients (Gr\u00f6nroos, 1984) and the water utility is no excep-\ntion. Hence, issues relating to tariff setting, meter reading,\nbilling, and payment options form an important part of facili-\ntating and support services for water utilities. In an explor-\natory study of five small urban water utilities in Uganda,\nMugabi, Kayaga, and Smout (2007b) identify that bill deliv-\nery, dependability or correctness of meter reading and bills,\nclarity of bills, flexibility, and choice in payment options are\namong the main factors that customers believe to be the\nfacilitators of, or barriers to, timely payment of their water\nbills. These issues, which we may collectively term as the\nbilling issues, if not managed properly, may easily add to\ncustomer dissatisfaction and eventually lead to more delayed\npayments (or outright nonpayments) and poorer revenue per-\nformance for the utility. Chipofya, Hoko, and Gustaff (2009)\nargue that utilities do not achieve efficiency in billing because\nthey do not employ appropriate billing practices. If so, then\none could argue that it is the reason for the abysmal bill pay-\nment on the part of consumers (Sualihu & Rahman, 2014a).\nIn addition to behavioral and institutional constructs such\nas those reviewed in the preceding paragraphs, Mugabi et al.\nWaldron, 2011) argue that some other institutional factors,\nnamely, transaction time of customers at the bill payment\npoints and monitoring and control measures on the part of\nwater utilities, may also play critical independent roles in\ndetermining customers' satisfaction level and their bill pay-\nment behavior. For example, a reduction in the transaction\ntime at bill collection centers is likely to increase customers'\nsatisfaction levels and encourage water utility clientele to\npay off their bills on time. Sualihu and Rahman (2014b) find\nthat a reduction in transaction time at bill collection centers\ndoes not only increase the satisfaction level of customers but\nalso reduces the number of days it takes utility customers, on\naverage, to pay off their bills after presentment. Furthermore,\nit is also argued that if utility companies step-up their moni-\ntoring and control roles, they are likely to detect faults such\nas metering errors and burst pipes, and fix them on time\n(Waldron, 2011). This would not only increase the level of\ncustomer satisfaction toward the water utility but also reduce\n4 SAGE Open\nFigure 1. Conceptual framework of the study.\nthe unusual delays in customers' bill payment. Therefore,\ntransaction time and monitoring and control are more likely\nto negatively influence bill payment behavior.\nFramework of Analysis\nTimely payment of bills can be viewed as a clear manifesta-\ntion of patronage intention of water customers. Several\nresearch perspectives suggest customers' behavioral inten-\ntion to patronize to be the primary predictor of their actual\npatronizing behavior. Many researchers, especially in service\nmarketing literature, rely on the expectation confirmation\ntheory (Oliver, 1980) to explain patronizing behavior, and\nsuggest customer satisfaction as the most important driver of\nthe customer's favorable behavioral intention (see, for exam-\nple, Cronin et al., 2000). Although this framework contrib-\nutes significantly to understanding customers' patronage\nbehavior, it is clearly based solely on customer's evaluative\njudgment on previous service encounters.\nThe TPB (Ajzen, 1991), however, recognizes that actual\nbehavior in many contexts may not entirely be dependent\non an individual's volitional behavioral intentions, but may\nbe influenced by factors that are external to one's volitional\ncontrol. Specifically, the theory suggests that customer\nbehavior is guided by behavioral intention as well as per-\nceived behavioral control, whereas behavioral intention is\njointly determined by customer's attitude toward the behav-\nior, subjective norm (perceived social influences on\nintended behavior), and perceived behavioral control (per-\nceived ease or difficulty in carrying out intended behavior).\nClearly, to the extent customer satisfaction helps form the\nattitude toward the behavior, the TPB appears consistent\nwith the expectation confirmation model, but it enriches\nconsumer behavior analysis with the inclusion of poten-\ntially important social influences and perceived behavioral\ncontrol. Previous repatronage literature indeed finds that, in\ninfluencing behavioral intention, the attitude toward the\nbehavior, especially formed through previous consumption\nexperiences (customer satisfaction) is more relevant and\npredominant than the general attitude toward the behavior\nAlthough the TPB identifies the role of subjective norm in\ndetermining behavioral intention, some researchers argue\nthis to be the weakest component of the theory (Armitage &\nConner, 2001). In practical applications, including that in the\nanalysis of patronage intentions, the connection between\nsubjective norm and behavioral intention is often quite mixed\ncontrast, the role of perceived behavioral control appears\noverriding in influencing patronage intentions such as the\nintention to pay water bills. For instance, although a water\ncustomer has positive attitude and perceived social pressure\nto pay bills on time, he or she may find it difficult to carry out\nhis or her intention due to lack of monitoring and control on\nthe part of water utility, billing irregularities, or prolonged\ntransaction time at payment centers. A number of previous\nstudies have demonstrated that patronage intentions will be\nhigher when an individual holds greater control over per-\nforming patronage behavior (e.g., Hansen, 2008; Liao, Chen,\nIn this article, we draw on the essence of both the expec-\ntation confirmation theory and the TPB and examine the\neffect of Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) custom-\ners' volitional behavioral intention and nonvolitional behav-\nioral control on their bill payment behavior. In keeping with\nthe literature reviewed in the previous section, relevant pre-\ndictor variables having a direct and/or indirect effect on pay-\nment behavior are postulated to be service quality, service\nvalue, corporate image, utility billing, monitoring and con-\ntrol, transactional time, and customer satisfaction. These\nvariables are presumed to be associated with each other as\nshown in Figure 1.\nSualihu et al. 5\nAs is evident in Figure 1, customer satisfaction in this\nstudy is conceptualized as an outcome of the influences of\nother predictor variables, which in turn is expected to affect\ncustomers' behavioral intentions as reflected in their deci-\nsions to pay water bills on time. However, in line with the\nTPB, customers' bill payment behavior is not assumed to be\nentirely under their volitional control (customer satisfaction)\nbut is allowed to be influenced (directly and indirectly) by\nnonvolitional external institutional factors such as curtailing\nthe transaction time at bill payment centers and an intensive\nmonitoring and control mechanism and appropriate billing\nsystem on the part of water utilities.\nResearch Objectives\nConsistent with the conceptual framework of analysis, three\nspecific objectives guide our study--(a) identifying the prin-\ncipal factors that influence customer satisfaction of water\nservices in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana (GARG), (b)\ndetermining whether endogenously determined customer\nsatisfaction levels translate into an expedient actual bill pay-\nment behavior, and (c) examining whether, in addition to\ntheir indirect influence through customer satisfaction, insti-\ntutional variables such as billing issues, transaction time, and\nmonitoring and control have a direct effect on customers'bill\npayment behavior.\nMethod\nData Source\nA sample of 150 households is obtained from GARG out of\nin the GARG are divided into three, namely, Accra East,\nAccra West, and Tema regions, with customer populations of\nregions, the Accra East region is randomly selected, and, the\nsample for the study is then obtained from the list of custom-\ners of the Accra East region using a systematic sampling\ntechnique, which is considered very appropriate in a house-\nhold survey (Cooper & Schindler, 2003). To do this, we ran-\ndomly begin with a household from the list of customers and\nhold from the population of customers (i.e., total list of cus-\ntomers) until a sample of 150 households was obtained.\nTherefore, in a sense, a two-stage sampling technique is\nused. The billing systems of the customers in the region are\ncomputerized, and that makes the sampling process quite\nsimple and easier to be carried out.\nThe Questionnaire\nA self-developed survey questionnaire is used in the study.\nTo develop the instrument, a literature review is conducted to\ndetermine the constructs that are necessary to be included in\nthe instrument. In addition to using the literature review, the\nengagement of the personnel of the Customer Service\nDirectorate (CSD) of the GWCL helps in the design of the\ninstrument. In a pilot study, the questionnaire is sent out to 60\ncustomers of the GWCL in the GARG. The data obtained\nfrom the pilot study help in assessing the validity and reli-\nability of the instrument before it is used for the main study.\nThe questionnaire has a total of 46 items divided into seven\nsections: The first section contains two questions for transac-\ntion time (one item) and monitoring and control (one item).\nFor example, the questions for transaction time and monitor-\ning and control read like \"How long on average does it take\nyou to pay your bill at payment centers?\" and \"How many\ntimes on average does the staff of the GWCL visit your\npremise and neighborhood?\", respectively. The remaining\nsix sections capture data on quality of service (13 items),\ncustomer satisfaction (10 items), corporate image (five\nitems), utility billing (five items), and service value (six\nitems) as well as background information (five items). As we\nhave indicated in the preceding section on variable construc-\ntion, \"a 5-point Likert-type scale with classifications from 1\n(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) is used to capture\ndata for the constructs of service quality, customer satisfac-\ntion, corporate image, utility billing and service value\"\nare then used for the regression analysis.\nThe reliability of the five scales of Customer Satisfaction\n(CS), Service Quality (SQ), Corporate Image (CI), Utility\nBilling (UB), and Service Value (SV) is examined using the\nCronbach's coefficient alpha. The results show alpha coeffi-\n.906, and .754, respectively. Notably, these coefficients are all\ngreater than .7, which is considered good and acceptable\n(Sekaran, 2000). The composite scores of these constructs are\nused to run the regression analyses. Construct validity of the\nscales is established via exploratory factor analysis, and the\ndimensions extracted using the principal components method.\nCustomer satisfaction is grouped into three subdimensions:\none subdimension describing satisfaction toward \"billing\" and\nthe other two describing satisfaction toward \"service\" and\n\"response.\" Likewise, three factors are extracted from service\nquality construct: one subdimension describing quality toward\n\"employee behavior\" and the remaining two describing qual-\nity related to \"service\" and \"resources.\" The corporate image\nconstruct yields one factor and is labeled \"trust.\" Utility billing\ngenerates two factors and they are labeled as \"monetary\" and\n\"billing.\" The service value construct yields two factors,\nwhich are labeled as \"trust\" and \"service.\"\nData Collection Procedure\nThe data are collected using a survey questionnaire. Of the\nadopted approaches such as sending regular reminders to the\nsurvey participants and providing appropriate assistance to\n6 SAGE Open\nthose respondents who had difficulty in reading and/or\nunderstanding the items on the questionnaire. That resulted\nin the relatively higher response rate (81.33%). Our compu-\ntation of the dependent variable (mean bill payment period\n[MBPP]), which reflects the bill payment behavior, is based\non customers' billing and payment history sourced directly\nfrom the GWCL.\nWith respect to the respondents' background data, out of\nthe 122 respondents who answer and return their question-\nAnother 65.48% of the respondents claim they are educated,\nof the respondents report they are aged between 18 and 35\nyears (elderly), respectively; 24.60% of the respondents have\nan annual income level of more than GH\u00a2 5,000.\nEthical Consideration\nAll social science research involves ethical issues. This is\nbecause research involves collecting data from people and\nabout people, and their rights and concerns in the research\nprocess must be respected at all times (Sekaran, 2000). Ethical\nconsiderations of confidentiality and voluntary and informed\nconsent are consciously upheld throughout the research. For\ninstance, on the issue of the voluntary and informed consent,\nletters are given out to the respondents informing them about\nthe rationale for the research, the roles they are expected to\nplay and how the information they provide is going to be\nused. Questionnaires are then distributed to only those who\nagree to participate in the research. Besides, for the sake of\nconfidentiality, instead of using house numbers to identify\nrespondents, special codes are given to them to make them\nanonymous. Finally, the research is not sponsored by any\nfunds from the GWCL or its affiliates.\nEmpirical Specification\nIn line with the conceptual framework (Figure 1), we esti-\nmate the following empirical model so as to appreciate the\nnature and extent of the influence of each of the previously\ndefined constructs on customer satisfaction and how the lat-\nter is reflected in their bill payment behavior.\nSV u\ni i i i i i\ni i\n= + + + + +\n+ +\n     \n\ni i i i i i\n= + + + + +\n    \nwhere CS MBPP\ni i\n, , TTi\n, MCi\n, SQi , CIi\n, UBi , and SVi\nare customer satisfaction (CS), mean bill payment period\n(MBPP), transaction time (TT), monitoring and control\n(MC), service quality (SQ), corporate image (CI), utility bill-\ning (UB), and service value (SV) corresponding to i th cus-\ntomer in the sample, respectively. \nk\nand k are the k th\nregression parameters of interest, and ui\nand vi are the error\nterms for Equations 1 and 2, respectively (see Table 1 for\nvariable construction).\nBecause CSi\nis the dependent variable in Equation 1 and\na predictor in Equation 2, clearly there exists a system of\nequations. The problem with such a system of equations is\nthat the estimation of each equation separately will produce\nbiased and inconsistent estimates of coefficients if the error\nterms across Equations 1 and 2 are correlated. As typical of\nmany research settings, we consider this possibility to be real\nin our case as well. Technically, any construct irrespective of\nwhether it is identifiable and/or measurable or not, that sys-\ntematically affects both CSi and MBPPi and is missing\nfrom the set of variables explicitly considered in the model\nwill induce correlation between the error terms in Equations\n1 and 2. Moreover, the measurement errors associated with\nand MBPPi may also be another source of correlation\nbetween error terms across equations. Therefore, to obtain\nconsistent estimates, we apply an instrumental variable esti-\nmation technique underlying the two-stage least squares\nmethod in this study. In implementing the two-stage least\nsquares method for our purpose, we follow a three-step pro-\ncedure suggested by Shaver (2005)--(a) least squares are\nused to estimate Equation 1, (b) predicted values of CSi\nfrom Equation 1 replace CSi\nin Equation 2, and (c) least\nsquares are then used to estimate coefficients of Equation 2.\nEmpirical Results\nWe begin by reporting the results of some preliminary analy-\nses of the survey instrument and data. Specifically, before\nestimating the empirical specification of our interest, we pro-\nvide some relevant descriptive and diagnostic statistics on\nthe constructs we use in our regression model.\nDescriptive Statistics\nThe descriptive statistics of the data in Table 2 provide infor-\nmation about the sample characteristics as captured by mean,\nstandard deviation, minimum and maximum values, and coef-\nficient of variation (CV) of the variables. The dependent vari-\nable in our regression model, MBPP, has a mean value of\napproximately 208 days. The MBPP shows a minimum value\nof approximately 20 days and a maximum value of 365 days.\nClearly, there is a wide variation of MBPP across customers.\nThis is supported by a relatively high value of CV of about\n49%. Except for TT and MC, all variables show only a reason-\nable amount of variation relative to their respective mean val-\nare an indication of very diverse customer experiences in\nterms of waiting times at different bill payment points and\nmonitoring and control activities on the part of the GWCL.\nSualihu et al. 7\nCorrelations depicting the magnitude and direction and\nlinear pairwise relationship between the variables under\nconsideration are provided in Table 3. Consistent with our\nconceptual framework, the mediating variable (CS) has\nthe expected signs with each of the six predictor variables\nand, except for MC, they are all significant at 5% level or\nbetter. Similarly, we note that CS and TT correlate with\nthe dependent variable (MBPP) with expected sign and\nthe correlation coefficients are at 5% level. Although MC\nis found to have an expected negative correlation with\nMBPP, the relationship is not significant. The correlation\nmatrix of Table 3 also helps to examine the issues of mul-\nticollinearity between the predictor variables. If the vari-\nables are highly correlated with the correlation coefficient\nbeing close to 1, then it becomes extremely hard to evalu-\nate the true effects of the predictor variables. Accordingly,\nwe assess the issue of multicollinearity in Table 4, and\nfind that, although there is no notable evidence of high\ncorrelation between MC and TT or with other predictors,\nthere are some traces of rather high and significant corre-\nlation coefficients among the other predictor variables.\nFor instance, SV shows a positive correlation of .723 and\n.740 with SQ and CI, respectively.\nBased on the high correlations between some of the\nvariables, for example, SV with SQ and CI, we decide to\ninvestigate the issue further using the variance inflation\nfactor (VIF), and its inverse referred to as the tolerance, for\neach of the predictor variables (see Table 4). Large VIF\nvalues show a high degree of collinearity or multicol-\nlinearity among the predictor variables used in a regres-\nsion analysis (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2014).\nNotably, our collinearity diagnostics do not show high VIF\n(or tolerance), as the values for the predictor variables are\nTable 1.

Reported results in Table 5 show that, although\nall the predictor variables have an expected sign of the asso-\nciation with CS, only MC, SQ, and CI have a statistically sig-\nnificant influence on CS at 1% level or better. Controlling for\nthe effects of the other variables, the coefficient value on MC\nimplies that an additional monitoring and control measure\n(measured by average number of inspections) reduces the sat-\nisfaction level of a typical water customer by 0.338 units.\nLikewise, significant SQ and CI coefficients imply that the\nunit of increase in the service quality and corporate image\nindices, respectively. Absolute values of reported standard-\nized coefficients show that one standard deviation change in\nCI results in the highest effect on CS followed by SQ and\nMC, respectively. Finally, the results in Table 5 suggest that\nthe predictor variables collectively explain much of the vari-\nance in the CS (adjusted R2 = 73.0%), the significance of\nwhich is established by the overall test of the goodness of\nEstimation results of regression Equation 2 are summa-\nrized in Table 6. Consistent with the predictions underlying\nour conceptual framework, we find that all the variables\nexcept UB (TT, MC, and CS) statistically significantly (at\nthe 5% alpha level or better) affect customers' MBPP in\nexpected directions. More specifically, the coefficient value\non TT suggests that, controlling for the effects of the other\npredictors, a water customer's MBPP increases by more than\none third of a day (0.334) for an increase in transaction time\nby 1 min. Likewise, the coefficient value on MC implies that,\nceteris paribus, each additional inspection of customers'\nfacilities has the potential to decrease MBPP by approxi-\ncustomer drops by approximately 9 days (9.112) when the\ncustomer satisfaction index increases by one unit. The abso-\nlute values of standardized coefficients suggest that one stan-\ndard deviation change in CS results in the highest effect on\nMBPP, followed by that in MC and TT, respectively. The\nadjusted R2 value (70.63%) coupled with a significant over-\nvariables considered together explain much of the variations\nin MBPP of the GWCL customers. Finally, given our con-\nceptual framework, two institutional variables TT and MC\nare presumed to have both direct and indirect effects on\nMBPP. In contrast, however, our empirical results in Tables\n5 and 6 suggest that, whereas MC has both a direct effect and\nan indirect effect mediated through CS, the entire effect of\nTT on MBPP is of direct nature.\nDiscussion of Results\nThe results presented in Tables 5 and 6 show that MC, CI, and\nSQ are the major determinants of CS toward the water utility,\nwhich in turn, together with TT and MC, explains a signifi-\ncant part of the total variation in water customers' bill pay-\nment behavior. The variables, in order of their direct impact\non customers' MBPP, are CS, MC, and TT, respectively.\nThe results indicate that, although TT does not have an\ninfluence on CS, it has significant effect on MBPP. Therefore,\nthe entire effect of TT on MBPP is direct and no part of the\neffect works indirectly through its influence on CS. This\nfinding implies that even though customers may not form a\nfavorable attitude toward the utility company, a reduction in\nTT has the potential to induce customers to pay their bills\nearly. Unlike TT, however, we find MC variable to have both\na direct and an indirect (through CS) effect on MBPP.\nInterestingly, these two effects work in opposite direction.As\npart of its direct effect, increased MC activity by the water\nutility helps curtail MBPP to a significant extent. However,\ngiven an observed negative relationship between CS and\nMBPP, as part of its indirect effect through CS, increased\nMC tends also to prolong MBPP.2 A positive indirect effect\nof MC on MBPP is not entirely surprising.

Consistent with Zeithaml's (1988)\nmodel, several studies have shown that SQ leads to SV in a\nservice encounter. Because a customer assesses SV by trad-\ning off the quality of service versus its cost in a given situa-\ntion, the customer's assessment of SV may largely be driven\nby SQ for as long as the prices for the service do not freely\nfluctuate. Like that of many other continuously provided ser-\nvice utilities, GWCL's price changes are largely infrequent\nand no such changes occurred at the time of our survey.\nAnother possible reason of the insignificance of SV in\nexplaining CS and MBPP could be related to the general\nbelief and attitude of many customers that the flow of water\nought to be free of cost. Given the long history of either free\nor at least heavily subsidized water services across most low-\nincome countries (see Kayaga et al., 2004), such attitudinal\nproblem and consequent misplaced evaluations of value of\nwater services on the part of customers may have distorted\nthe relationship between SV and CS in our analysis.\nThe results of the study show a significant positive rela-\ntionship between corporate image and customer satisfaction,\nwhich is consistent with our conceptual framework and some\nof the recent findings such as that of Richard and Zhang\ntrary to the prediction of our conceptual framework of analy-\nsis, we do not find significant effect of UB in determining\ncustomers' satisfaction level. One possible explanation for\nbilling issues not having an impact on CS could be that the\nwater customers of the GWCL have other more pressing con-\ncerns such as those related to infrequent water supply and\ndelays in fixing frequently leaking water pipes, which weigh\nmore in determining the overall customer satisfaction level.\nSummary, Conclusions, and\nRecommendations\nIn recent years, GWCL has been going through a series of\ntransformational reforms so as to break away from the depen-\ndence on government subsidy and to achieve financial inde-\npendence. However, similar to other water utilities operating,\nespecially in the low-income countries, the company is find-\ning it increasingly difficult to keep its customers current with\ntheir water bills. Faced with poor cost recovery because of\nuntimely bill payment from the customers, it has become\nvery much of a burden on the company to continue to pro-\nvide adequate service and meet an acceptable headline effi-\nciency target (Hassanein & Khalifa, 2006). With this\nbackground, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect\nof a set of behavioral and institutional factors on the bill pay-\nment behavior based on a cross-sectional survey of water\ncustomers in the GARG.\nCustomer satisfaction is found to be the most significant\ndirect predictor of the variation in the time taken to settle the\nOur study shows a significant positive relationship\nbetween SQ and CS. Consistent with the findings of many\nothers (e.g., Babakus & Boller, 1992; Cronin & Taylor,\n1992), this result suggests that service quality may indeed\nplay a key role in creating a satisfied and loyal customer base\nfor water services in Ghana. In contrast, however, our results\nwith respect to SV seem to contradict what appears to be a\nconsensus in the services literature that perceived service\nwater bills followed by monitoring and control measures and\ntransaction time at the bill payment centers, respectively.\nAlthough an increase in customer satisfaction and monitor-\ning and control activities induce customers to settle their\nwater bills early, increased transaction time at bill payment\ncenters leads to delayed payments. The conceptual model of\nthe study also considers how the effects of a set of judgmen-\ntal (service quality, service value, and corporate image) and\ninstitutional (utility billing, monitoring and control, and\ntransaction time) variables on customers' payment behavior\nare mediated through customer satisfaction. The results indi-\ncate that an increase in perceived service quality and corpo-\nrate image relate positively to the level of customer\nsatisfaction and help curtail the payment period. In contrast,\nhowever, increased monitoring and control activities are\nfound to reduce customer satisfaction, which in turn exert an\nindirect negative influence on customers' payment behavior.\nOur results do not support any indirect role of service value,\nutility billing, and transaction time in customers' decision to\npay water bills in time.\nFrom both theoretical and managerial standpoints, these\nfindings may have several implications. From a theoretical\nperspective, this study makes an important contribution to\nthe limited literature on the factors influencing customer\ndecision when it comes to paying water bills in time.\nAlthough the importance of some customer-centric judg-\nmental factors such as service quality and customer satisfac-\ntion has previously been studied in models of customers'\ndecision to pay in time (namely, Kayaga et al., 2004; Mugabi\net al., 2007b), we are not aware of any study that explicitly\nconsiders whether certain institutional factors, independently\nor in combination with typical judgmental factors, have a\nrole to play in customers' decision process. In addition to\ncustomer satisfaction, the inclusion of factors such as billing\nissues, monitoring and control, and transaction time in this\nstudy not only highlights the importance of these institu-\ntional factors but also provides a more comprehensive under-\nstanding of their effect on both customer satisfaction and\nbehavioral intention as reflected in customer decision to pay\nwater bills in time.\nForm managerial perspective, one of the key lessons that\ncan be drawn from this analysis is that cost recovery of water\nutilities through customers' timely payment may be influ-\nenced by a multitude of factors. An understanding of these\ndiverse factors affecting the payment behavior is extremely\nuseful, especially in the context of capital-constrained water\nutilities operating in developing countries. The study con-\nfirms that customer satisfaction is of paramount importance\nin inducing customers to pay their water utility bills on a\ntimely basis. Given our results, it seems that any particular\ncost recovery or bill collection strategy is unlikely to succeed\nif certain aspects relating to the service and the organization\nitself (e.g., service quality and corporate image) are not prop-\nerly taken care of. Our results support the view that service\nquality is important in creating a satisfied and loyal customer\nbase (Ostrowski et al., 1993). Because perceived service\nquality originates from customers' expectations, it is neces-\nsary to identify customers' expectations of service quality\nand incorporate these expectations into water service deliv-\nery process. In addition, we find that the customers not only\nneed to feel satisfied because of a high perceived quality,\nwhich fulfills or exceeds their expectations, but also need to\nperceive some form of positive emotional attachment with\nthe water utility. Therefore, emphasis should also be placed\non improving image of the utility in the minds of the custom-\ners. Corporate image can support or undermine the value that\ncustomers believe they are getting (Abdullah, Al-Nasser, &\nHusain, 2000), and it is created and developed in customers'\nmind through proper communication and experience of ser-\nvice delivery encounters (Srivastava & Sharma, 2013).\nIn addition, our analysis suggests that, rather than merely\nconcentrating on customer satisfaction improvement, strate-\ngies also need to be adopted at the operational level (e.g.,\nimproving monitoring and control mechanism and curtailing\ntransaction time). In describing management-related chal-\nlenges facing water utilities in developing countries, Mugabi,\nKayaga, and Njiru (2007a) correctly note that many of those\nutilities lack effective management information system to\nallow adequate monitoring and evaluation to achieve opera-\ntional improvements.\nInterestingly, we find that greater monitoring and control\nactivities tend to reduce customer satisfaction level, and\nthereby have an adverse indirect effect on the time taken to\nsettle water bills. This finding underscores the need for orga-\nnizing various customer awareness\u00adraising programs on a\nregular basis so as to help customers understand that water is\njust another scarce economic resource, and the water service\ndelivery system is an essential but a very cost-intensive pro-\ncess. Such customer sensitization initiatives would not only\nensure dissemination of more information on the process of\nwater and sanitation provision but also help to resolve cus-\ntomers' misunderstandings in appreciating the true value of\nwater services. We also find that there is a wide variation in\nthe number of days that customers take to pay their bills.\nAlthough some customers pay their bills within 20 days after\npresentment, it takes others about a year to pay their bills.\nThis is not a good sign, as the water utility relies on these\npayments for its operational activities and investments.\nNotwithstanding the findings of our study and their associ-\nated practical implications, the study has its own limitations.\nTo ascertain the theoretical aspects of the proposed model of\nbill payment behavior, we have purposefully limited the num-\nber of antecedents to seven variables. However, we acknowl-\nedge that there may be additional variables that are potentially\nuseful for a better understanding of customers' attitude and\ntheir actual payment behavior, which should also be explored\nin future studies. In this regard, Mugabi and Kayaga (2010),\nfor example, stress the importance of sociodemographic char-\nacteristics of the customer clientele. Another potential limita-\ntion of the study relates to the ability of cross-sectional data in\nestablishing causal relationship, which is often questioned in\nthe literature (see, for example, Katz, 2001; Hong & Goo,\n2004). Although we have adopted a two-stage least squares\napproach to establish the causal ordering of the variables\nbased on background knowledge from the existing literature,\nthe adequacy of the proposed model depends critically on the\nstability (coherence) of results across time and space\n(Rindfleisch, Malter, Ganesan, & Moorman, 2008; Wunsch,\nRusso, & Mouchart, 2010). Future replication of the study is,\ntherefore, important for testing whether and to what extent\nthese results extend to the context of water utilities in other\ncountries with similar socioeconomic characteristics. By\ndoing so, the structural equation modeling, although seriously\ncriticized by Shaver (2005), could also be used. To achieve an\nexplicit time ordering of the cause-and-effect relationship, the\nuse of longitudinal data in future studies would be another\ninteresting development.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1.
