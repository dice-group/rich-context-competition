The prevalence of asthma\nhas been increasing in recent years, and now\naffects as many as 334 million people worldwide\nresidents over the age of 14 years in eight Chinese\nfound the overall prevalence of asthma to be 1.2%\n[Feng et al. 2014]. The number of asthmatic\npatients in China has been estimated to be roughly\nAlthough asthma is not curable, many studies have\nshown that correct diagnosis, proper treatment\nand long-term management of asthma can improve\nthe level of asthma control and enhance the quality\nof life [CTS, 2008]. Good management of asthma\nis also essential to reduce the economic burden of\nasthma. If not controlled properly, asthma can\naffect daily activities and result in physical, emo-\ntional and social limitations which can impair\nquality of life and even be fatal [Van Lieshout and\nto the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), the\nlong-term goals of asthma control are symptom\ncontrol and risk reduction [GINA, 2015].\nUncontrolled asthma and its risk factors in\nadult Chinese asthma patients\nNanshan Zhong, Jiangtao Lin, Jinping Zheng, Kefang Lai, Canmao Xie, Ke-Jing Tang,\nMao Huang, Ping Chen and Changzheng Wang\n Keywords: adult, asthma, cross-sectional studies, risk factors\nCorrespondence to:\nNanshan Zhong, MD\nDepartment of Respiratory\nDisease, The First\nAffiliated Hospital of\nGuangzhou Medical\nChina\ncom\nJinping Zheng, MD\nKefang Lai, MD\nDepartment of Respiratory\nDisease, The First\nAffiliated Hospital of\nGuangzhou Medical\nUniversity, Guangzhou,\nChina\nJingtao Lin, MD\nDepartment of Respiratory\nDisease, China-Japan\nFriendship Hospital,\nBeijing, China\nCanmao Xie, MD\nKe-Jing Tang, MD\nDepartment of Respiratory\nDisease, The First\nAffiliated Hospital, Sun\nYat-Sen University,\nGuangzhou, China\nMao Huang, MD\nDepartment of Respiratory\nDisease, Jiangsu\nProvincial People's\nHospital, Nanjing, China\nPing Chen, MD\nDepartment of Respiratory\nDisease, The General\nHospital of Shenyang\nMilitary Region, Shenyang,\nChina\nChangzheng Wang, MD\nDepartment of Respiratory\nDisease, Xinqiao Hospital,\nThe Third Military Medical\nUniversity, Chongqing,\nChina\nOriginal Research\nTherapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 10(6)\nOnly limited information is available on the state\nof asthma management in Chinese patients, espe-\ncially adult patients. A survey conducted in eight\nAsia-Pacific countries in 2011 reported that\nasthma was uncontrolled for a large proportion of\npatients from mainland China were either uncon-\ntrolled or only partly controlled [Thompson et al.\nfrom eight Chinese provinces found that 15.6%\nwere completely controlled and 49.5% were\npartly controlled, as evaluated by the Asthma\nControl Test (ACT) [Su et al. 2014]. The dis-\ncrepancy between the findings of these two stud-\nies may be due to limitations in geographic\ndistribution and sample size.\nAsthma control is related to many factors.\nMedication adherence is an important determi-\nnant of asthma control, though nonadherence to\nasthma controllers among asthma patients is\nprevalent and maybe is an important reason for\npoor asthma control in many countries including\net al. 2013]. Allergic rhinitis (AR) is also a widely\nreported risk factor for asthma control. A study\nshowed that 69.9% of Chinese asthma patients\nover the age of 14 years reported AR symptoms\nand that the presence and severity of AR were\nnegatively associated with asthma control [Lin\net al. 2014]. Studies also reported obesity is asso-\nciated with subsequent poor asthma control\nies to comprehensively evaluate risks associated\nwith poor asthma control in Chinese patients\nwere still very limited.\nThis study aims to provide a comprehensive esti-\nmate of asthma control across mainland China\nand to identify predictors associated with uncon-\ntrolled asthma in Chinese asthma patients.\nMethods\nStudy design and patients\nThis nationwide cross-sectional observational\nstudy was conducted in China between November\n2 years who visited outpatient clinics of respira-\ntory disease for treatment, prescription refill and\nconsultation during the study period. A total of\n8873 asthma patients were enrolled in this study.\nHere we report only the results from the 4125\nparticipants aged 17 and older. The results from\nreported separately.\nThe asthma patients 17 years old were consecu-\ntively enrolled from 48 tertiary general hospitals\nin 34 cities of different provinces across China,\ncovering all territories and regions of mainland\nChina except Tibet. All participants had con-\nfirmed asthma for at least 3 months and had\nsymptoms or took asthma medication during the\nAsthma diagnosis was confirmed by medical chart\nreview at the enrollment visit. The diagnosis of\nasthma was defined as the presence of relevant\nclinical history (i.e. history of recurrent dyspnea,\nwheezing or cough episodes) and pulmonary\nfunction tests demonstrating variable airflow lim-\nitation by means of airway responsiveness testing\nor airway reversibility testing, which satisfied\nthose of GINA [GINA, 2015]. Asthma duration\nand treatment were also confirmed by medical\nchart review. Eligible patients were requested to\nsign the informed consent. Patients who had mild\nasthma, intermittent asthma, chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis,\nbronchitis, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer or pneu-\nmonia or who were not able to fill in the question-\nnaires were excluded.\nThe study protocol was originally approved by\nthe Independent Ethics Committee of China\u00ad\nJapan Friendship Hospital. Other participating\nhospitals either accepted the decision of that\ncommittee or conducted a further independent\nethics review, according to their own institutional\npolicy.\nData collection\nSociodemographic and clinical information,\nincluding family history of allergic disease, con-\ncomitant disease (e.g. rhinitis and AR), asthma\nsymptoms, asthma duration since diagnosis,\nasthma-related treatments and tests, and asthma\ntreatment adherence, was collected from partici-\npants' medical charts during their visits. Any\nidentifier to an individual patient, such as social\nsecurity number, identification number and full\nname, was not collected. Body mass index (BMI)\nwas measured and classified as normal (18.5 \nBMI < 28), and obesity (BMI  28) based on\nCriteria Of Weight for Adults issued by National\nN Zhong, J Lin et al.\nHealth and Family Planning Commission\nRhinitis was defined as nasal symptoms including\nsneezing, nasal blockage, itching of the nose\noccurring during multiple consecutive days for\nmore than 1 hour on most days and not caused by\ncold or flu [Bousquet et al. 2008].

Both questionnaires were completed by\nparticipants during the interview and reviewed by\nphysicians for completeness.\nQuality control\nAll data were collected using a uniform data col-\nlection form. All investigators were trained on the\nstandardized study protocol and data collection\nform before initiation of the study. A clinical\nresearch organization (CRO) was employed to\nmonitor the quality of data collection and to man-\nage the data. All data were inputted into a pro-\ngrammed database by two people independently\nfor statistical analysis.\nStatistical analysis\nSince the study was not testing any hypothesis,\nwe calculated sample size based on the estimation\nof uncontrolled asthma rate. A sample size of\ntwo-sided) when we estimated uncontrolled\nasthma rate was 42% according to the result of\nthe Asia Pacific Asthma Insights and Management\nstudy [Thompson et al. 2013]. With considera-\ntion of stratification analysis on AR comorbidity\nand other risk factors, we amplified the sample\nsize to 4000. Descriptive statistics were used to\nsummarize demographic and clinical characteris-\ntics. Continuous variables were displayed by\nmean, median, standard deviation (SD), and first\nand third quartiles (Q1 and Q3). Categorical var-\niables were summarized by frequency and per-\ncentage. Continuous variables were compared\nusing two-sample Student's t-test. To explore the\npotential risk factors associated with uncontrolled\nasthma, the level of asthma control was summa-\nrized into two categories: controlled asthma\n(ACT  20) and uncontrolled asthma (ACT \n19). The proportion of uncontrolled asthma in\npatients among two different characteristics\ngroups was calculated and compared using a Chi-\nsquare test. A Cochran\u00adArmitage test was used to\ndetect the trend of proportions of uncontrolled\nasthma in patients among more than two ordinal\ncategories. Factors of statistical significance (p <\n0.1) were analyzed using multivariate logistic\nregression models to identify the risk factors asso-\nciated with uncontrolled asthma. Odds ratio\n(OR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of\neach factor from the multivariate logistic regres-\nsion models was estimated and presented.

Several\nrisk factors for uncontrolled asthma were identi-\nfied, including poor treatment adherence, con-\ncomitant rhinitis, asthma duration since diagnosis\n> 3 years, age  45 years and obesity.\nPrevious studies have found that insufficient\ntreatment is prevalent among asthma patients\nIn the present study, asthma treatment adherence\nwas low in most of the study participants, and\n21.3% of the participants had not taken any\nasthma medication during the previous 4 weeks.\nOnly 39.0% of them had complete asthma treat-\nment adherence. The frequency of uncontrolled\nasthma was particularly high in patients with\npoorer asthma controller adherence. Multivariate\nlogistic regression analysis showed that poor\nasthma treatment adherence was a significant risk\nfactor associated with uncontrolled asthma. The\nrisk of uncontrolled asthma in patients with non-\nadherence was 4.55 times of that for patients with\ncomplete adherence. All these results show that\npoor treatment adherence is a very important fac-\ntor contributing to the high proportion of uncon-\ntrolled asthma among Chinese patients.\nAmong the participants who had not used asthma\ncontrollers during the previous 4 weeks, most\nstopped taking asthma controllers on their own\nand 53.3% stopped taking them because they\nthought their asthma symptoms had been relieved.\nThese patients probably overestimated the level\nof asthma control they had achieved. This finding\nis consistent with a previous survey in the Asia\u00ad\nPacific area which reported that one third of\nresponders with severe persistent asthma thought\ntheir disease was either well or completely con-\ntrolled [Thompson et al. 2013]. Differences\nbetween patient perceptions of asthma control\nand clinically defined asthma control is an impor-\ntant factor for low asthma treatment adherence in\nChinese patients. Efforts should be made to\nimprove patients' understanding of asthma con-\ntrol and of the importance of good treatment\nadherence.\nRhinitis was identified as predictor associated\nin this study. This was different from many stud-\nies where concomitant AR was usually reported\nas predictor for asthma control. The prevalence\nof rhinitis in this study was 37.1% and it was\nhigher than the prevalence of AR 15.2% we\nfound. A previous study showed that over 50% of\npatients with asthma or rhinitis in China had\nidentifiable sensitivity to aeroallergens, as\ndetected by a skin prick test [Li et al. 2009]. But\nthere was insufficient use of a skin prick test\npopulation, which might have resulted in under-\ndiagnosed AR among those with rhinitis. This\nmight be the reason why the prevalence of AR is\nlower than the other study [Hojo et al. 2015]. Lin\nand colleagues also reported a higher prevalence\nof AR 69.9% in Chinese asthma patients [Lin\net al. 2014], however, the definition of AR they\nadopted was only based on typical nasal symp-\ntoms without the evidence of an IgE-mediated\nimmune response, which may have led to the\noverestimation of prevalence. Since AR was not\nidentified as a contributor to uncontrolled asthma\nwith statistical significance in the univariate anal-\nysis and both AR and rhinitis were moderately\ncorrelated (Spearman correlation coefficient =\nmultivariate logistic regression model for risk\nanalysis. Nevertheless, when we used it to replace\nrhinitis in the model, very similar results were\nobserved and AR was still found to be associated\nwith increased risk of uncontrolled asthma (OR =\nnot conflict with previous studies but was a new\ncomplement in this study context. The finding\nwas also consistent with the study by Powell and\ncolleagues where rhinitis adversely affected\nasthma control [Powell et al. 2015]. All of these\nN Zhong, J Lin et al.\nsuggest that diagnosis and treatment of concomi-\ntant AR or rhinitis may help to maintain good\ncontrol of asthma in China.\nObesity has been reported to be associated with\npoor asthma control [Pradeepan et al. 2013;\nstudy, high frequency of uncontrolled asthma\n(62.9%) was found in obese participants (BMI \nasthma compared with those with normal BMI.\nThis finding was similar to previous studies\nResponse to pharmacological asthma therapy in\nobese patients showed that obese patients altered,\nin general less favorable, response to both reliever\nand controller medication compared with normal\nweight patients [Ulrik, 2016]. Obesity increases\nairway hyperresponsiveness and restoring normal\nbody weight is an appropriate strategy for reduc-\ning airway hyperresponsiveness and controlling\ninflammation that may help improve asthma con-\ntrol [Kim et al. 2015]. Therefore, in addition to\ngood treatment adherence, options such as weight\nloss and dietary intervention should be consid-\nered in asthma management.\nA study conducted in China reported that chil-\ndren with asthma with a longer disease course\nand regular follow up had better treatment com-\npliance and fewer asthma attacks [Thomas et al.\n2010]. Those finding implied that patients with a\nlonger duration of asthma tended to have better\ndrug adherence and better control of asthma.\nHowever, a study conducted in Warsaw in Polish\nreported that a longer duration of the disease was\nassociated with worse asthma control\n[Krasnodebska et al. 2012]. All those studies indi-\ncated that a longer duration of asthma does not\nnecessarily mean better drug adherence and\nasthma control. In this study, we found that\npatients with a duration of asthma more than 3\nyears had a higher risk of uncontrolled asthma\npatients with a longer duration of asthma in China\nmay still not be well trained in terms of following\nstandard asthma management and correct per-\nception of asthma control. This study also\nrevealed that having `college and above' educa-\ntion was a protective factor for asthma control\nwith other studies' common findings that higher\nsocioeconomic status or health literacy have been\nassociated with good asthma control [Cope et al.\nabove implies that patient educational interven-\ntion should be included in asthma management\nto increase treatment adherence and also improve\nasthma control.\nSince this study was a cross-sectional survey, no\ndefinite conclusion can be drawn about the causal\nrelationship between risk factors and uncontrolled\nasthma. The enrollment of study participants\ndepends on patient clinical visits and their will-\ningness to be surveyed which might result in\nselection bias. Patients willing to attend the study\nmight be prone to follow physician advice or their\nprescription during previous treatment, which\nmay cause better adherence for them than those\nnot in the study. Therefore, the proportion of\npatients with poor or nonadherence may be\nunderestimated. Additionally, the judgment of\nadherence in this study was based on outpatient\nprescription refill during the past 3 months rather\nthan actual dosage that the patients took, which\nmay have led to complete or good adherence to\nhave been overestimated to some extent. There\nwas still a possibility that outpatients hospitalized\ndue to an asthma attack during the past 3 months\nbefore the study and all related inpatient treat-\nments for asthma could not be included in their\nrecords of outpatient clinics, which also jeopard-\nized the accuracy of judgment of adherence. Also,\nsince the participants all came from tertiary gen-\neral hospitals, it is possible that the symptoms of\nasthma among these patients were more severe\nthan in ordinary asthma patients such as patients\nvisiting lower-grade hospitals. This may be a rea-\nson for the high proportion of uncontrolled\nasthma among surveyed patients. We excluded\nintermittent asthma because it does not necessar-\nily need controller treatment and has limited neg-\native impacts on patient's daily activity and sleep\ndue to a symptom duration of less than once a\nweek. We also excluded mild asthma. Therefore,\ninterpreting the results needs caution that the\nuncontrolled rate of asthma might be overesti-\nmated for overall asthmatic patients. The study\nwas carried out between November and June of\nthe following year when the impact of rhinitis/AR\non asthma control could be modified by the sea-\nson. This could be another explanation for the\nhigh rates of uncontrolled asthma in this study\n[Hojo et al. 2015]. Our study found that patient\neducation level was positively related to asthma\ncontrol, however it might be confounded by soci-\noeconomic class. Although people with higher\neducation are very likely to have better or com-\npetitive earnings, meanwhile it could not be\nTherapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 10(6)\ndenied that the rich could purchase better health-\ncare than the poor. Future studies should exclude\nsuch confounding effects to generate more solid\nevidence. Nevertheless, this study provided a\ncomprehensive profile of the most recent asthma\ncontrol status in Chinese adult patients. The\nresults should serve as a valuable reference to\nguide further management of asthma control in\nChina.\nThe long-term goals of asthma control, as defined\nby GINA, are symptom control and risk reduc-\ntion. The results of this study revealed that the\nlevel of asthma control in China is still far below\nthe goal. Poor asthma treatment adherence was\nthe most important risk factor contributing to\nuncontrolled asthma. Patients' lack of knowledge\nof standard asthma control might be an underly-\ning reason for poor treatment adherence. This\nmay be improved through educating patients\nabout asthma control and improving the aware-\nness of asthma management. Diagnosis and\nappropriate treatment of AR or rhinitis are also\nimportant.\n"
