The current study uses population-based mortality\ndata to investigate whether heavy drinking affects the age of death among individuals with HCV and,\nif so, whether this effect differs between men and women.\ndrawn from the Multiple Cause of Death (MCD) public-use data files compiled by the National Cen-\nter for Health Statistics (NCHS). International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)\ncodes were used to identify the presence of HCV (B17.1 and B18.2) and HAU (as indicated by\nalcohol-induced medical conditions, F10 and K70) either as the underlying cause or as one of the\ncontributing causes of death. The deaths were divided into 4 distinctive cause-of-death categories:\nHCV without HAU, HAU without HCV, HCV plus HAU, and all others. The mean ages of death\nand the cumulative probabilities of death derived from multiple-cause life table were compared across\nthese categories.\nResults: Hepatitis C virus deaths showed an excessive prevalence of HAU when compared with\nnon-HCV deaths.

Conceivably, heavy\ndrinking may have a stronger effect on HCV disease pro-\ngression among women than among men, as women are\ngenerally more susceptible to the adverse effects of alco-\nhol. The current study uses population-based mortality\ndata and a life table method to analyze the age pattern of\nHCV deaths and to investigate whether heavy drinking\naffects the age of death among individuals with HCV and,\nif so, whether this effect differs between men and women.\nData\nMortality data were taken from the Multiple Cause of Death\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The MCD includes\nindividual records from all resident death certificates filed each year\nin the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Data for a 3-year period\nwere used to increase the reliability of the analysis results.\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10).\nEach death record in the MCD includes codes for 1 underlying cause\nof death and up to 20 contributing causes. For the current study,\nHCV deaths were identified by either the underlying cause or a men-\n(0.4%) had acute or chronic HCV coded as the underlying cause or\none of the contributing causes of death.\ntality rates and life table parameters were taken from releases by the\nResearch Design\nBecause no information on drinking behaviors is provided on\ndeath certificates, medical conditions mentioned on the death certifi-\ncates that are certainly alcohol-induced served as a proxy measure\nfor HAU. These included alcoholic cirrhosis and mental/behavioral\ndisorders due to use of alcohol. Because these medical conditions are\n100% attributable to alcohol use, the proxy measure has a high sen-\nsitivity in identifying heavy drinkers, although it is a conservative\nmeasure as not all heavy drinkers develop those alcohol-induced\nmedical conditions (AIMC). Depending on the presence of HCV and\nHAU (as indicated by AIMC), irrespective of whether they were\ncoded as underlying or contributing causes,1 the death records\nwere classified into the following 4 cause-of-death categories:\nTable 1 presents the ICD-10 codes for HCV and AIMC. Compar-\ning these cause-of-death categories allows us to assess the net effect\nof HAU beyond the effect of HCV, as well as the net effect of HCV\nbeyond that attributable to HAU. For instance, we can evaluate the\nnet effect of HAU on HCV mortality by comparing the age distribu-\ntion among deaths in Category 3 (HCV plus HAU) with that in\nCategory 1 (HCV without HAU). Similarly, we can evaluate the\neffect of HCV on alcohol-induced mortality by comparing Category\n3 and Category 2 (HAU without HCV). Category 4 (all others) rep-\nresents mortality from all other causes and serves as a baseline for\nassessing premature deaths. We can evaluate the combined effect of\nHCV and HAU by comparing Categories 3 and 4.\n1Preliminary analyses showed very similar age patterns between deaths\nwith HCV coded as the underlying cause and deaths with HCV coded as a\ncontributing cause.\nAnalysis Procedures\nMultiple-cause life table analysis (Selvin, 1996) was conducted\nto reveal the age patterns of different cause-of-death groups. This\nprocedure builds on single-cause life table analysis, and is aimed at\nisolating the effect of specific causes. A single-cause life table pro-\nduces survival probabilities and cumulative probabilities of death\n(CPD) by age based on a set of age-specific death rates from all\ncauses, whereas a multiple-cause life table generates conditional\nsurvival probabilities and CPD, which are cause-specific for sub-\npopulation groups with the respective conditions.\nThe construction of a multiple-cause life table can be considered\nas an extension of a single-cause life table, which can be succinctly\nsummarized as follows: from the length of the age interval dx\nand\nthe age-specific mortality rate Rx\n, derive qx\n\u00bc dx\nRx\nRx\n, the\nprobability of dying in each age interval [x,x1dx\n] for those alive at x.\nSecondly, apply qx\nto an arbitrary number of individuals lx\nto pro-\nduce the number of deaths dx\nqx\nin the age interval. Finally,\ndivide the sum of deaths dx\nfrom age x and up by the sum of deaths\ndx\nfrom age 0 and up to obtain Sx\n(the probability of surviving age x)\nand Fx\n5 1 \u00c0 S (the probability of deaths before age x). Extending\nthis procedure with cause-specific qx\nand dx\nresults in a multiple-\ncause life table.\nWe used the lifetabl command (Ramalheira, 2001) in the statistical\nsoftware package Stata (Stata Corp., College Station, TX) to con-\nstruct the multiple-cause life table. For the convenience of reporting,\nthe CPD (Fx\n) were presented by 5-year age intervals (based on an\nabridged life table) in tabular form, and by single-year intervals\n(based on a complete life table) in graphs. All analyses were carried\nout separately for males and females.\nRESULTS\nHAU Involvement in HCV Deaths\nthe annual average number of HCV deaths was 6,670 in\nmales and 3,187 in females. These numbers can be trans-\npopulation in males and females, respectively. Using\nAIMC as a proxy for HAU, the HCV deaths showed an\nexcessive prevalence of HAU when compared with non-\nplus HAU.'' In contrast, of the non-HCV deaths, only\n2.2% in males and 0.6% in females had AIMC.\nEffect of HAU on HCV Mortality\nFigure 1 presents the CPD from the life table analysis for\nthe 4 cause-of-death categories. The curves showed little\ndifferences before age 40 among these categories. After age\n40, there was an increasing divergence in the CPD, with the\nfastest increase of deaths in the ``HCV plus HAU'' cat-\negory. The curves of the CPD presented a clear ordering\nfor females, with ``HCV plus HAU'' being the highest, fol-\nlowed by ``HAU without HCV,'' ``HCV without HAU,''\nand ``all others.'' Among males, between the same highest\nand lowest categories, the CPD curves for ``HAU without\nHCV'' and ``HCV without HAU'' were very similar.\nNevertheless, it is clear that, among both sexes, the com-\nbination of HCV and heavy drinking (as indicated by\nAIMC) resulted in dying at younger ages.\nThese patterns are also presented in Table 3. The cumu-\nlative probability of ``HCV plus HAU'' increases rapidly\nTable 1.

This\npattern confirms findings from the clinical literature that\nHCV has a disproportionate effect in males. However,\nheavy drinking reduced these gender differences, as shown\nin the graph for ``HCV plus HAU.'' In that graph, the\nCPD curves not only increased much faster but also were\nalmost identical for both sexes, indicating a ``catching-up''\neffect for females that resulted from a stronger impact of\nHAU on female HCV deaths than on male HCV deaths.\nAs mentioned earlier, the male mean age of HCV death\nwith HAU, whereas the reduction was about 12 years\n(from 61 to 49.1) among females.

It was worth noting, however,\nthat the gender difference in the reduction of mean age of\ndeath was smaller for non-HCV than for HCV deaths.\nDISCUSSION\nUsing multiple-cause life table analysis, the current study\nattempted to examine the effect of HAU, as represented by\nAIMC, on the age patterns of HCV mortality. The find-\nings from this study showed that the prevalence of HAU,\nas indicated by the presence of AIMC, was relatively\nhigh among HCV deaths. More importantly, HAU had\nan undue effect on HCV mortality in shortened life in both\nmales and females. This pattern is consistent with evidence\nfrom recent clinical and laboratory studies on HCV dis-\nease progression. For instance, it was recently found in\nHCV core-transgenic mice that chronic ethanol consump-\ntion and HCV core protein additively increased lipid\nperoxidation and acted synergistically to increase the\nhepatic expression of transforming growth factor-b\n(TGF-b) (Perlemuter et al., 2003) and to activate some\nmitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (Tsutsumi\net al., 2003). These may in turn contribute to fibrogenesis\nand the pathogenesis of liver disease.\nAlcohol consumption at high levels is immunosuppres-\nsive and increases oxidative stress. Furthermore, alcohol\npotentiates HCV replicon expression, decreases viral clear-\nance, and compromises interferon-a therapy. Both alcohol\nand HCV activate hepatic stellate cells, the main source of\ncollagen within the liver. These in vitro and in vivo data\nsupport several biologically plausible explanations for the\nobservations reported here and suggest possible appro-\naches that may reveal the mechanisms underlying the\nincreased rate of liver fibrosis progression in heavy drink-\nThe current study also examined the gender difference in\nthe effect of alcohol on HCV deaths. Confirming our\nhypothesis, the findings revealed that HAU affected\nfemales more strongly than males, resulting in a much\ngreater reduction in the mean age of female HCV deaths\nthan that of male HCV deaths. The presence of an inter-\naction effect of gender observed in the current study may\nbe partially due to more detrimental effects of alcohol on\nprogression of liver injury among women than among men\nwith a similar level of alcohol use (Becker et al., 1996). A\nreview of the literature by Colantoni et al. (2003) summar-\nized several reasons why females are at a higher risk for\nalcoholic liver diseases: differences in ethanol pharmaco-\nkinetics, alcohol elimination rate, production of free\noxygen radicals, levels of endotoxin in the blood, and\nKupffer cell function. Additionally, Colantoni et al.\nression and 2 additional factors--tumor necrosis factor-a\n(TNF-a) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)--involved in hepatic\napoptosis and proliferation that might explain the sex dif-\nferences found in rats.\nMost existing studies on HCV progression have relied\non clinical samples. Because of the asymptomatic nature of\nHCV infection and the long duration of progression, studies\nthat attempt to characterize the long-term consequences\nof HCV infection have certain inherent limitations. Retro-\nspective studies are often based on patients in more critical\net al., 1993), and therefore usually find that the infection of\nHCV leads to end-stage liver disease in a relatively short\ntime. Prospective studies are usually too short (o20 years)\nto follow patients from infection to death. The deaths\nor the lack thereof during the follow-up has led some\nresearchers to suspect that the observed differences in rate\nof progression among HCV patients may be due to the\ncompeting mortality risks from other causes of death (Kim\nIn most prospective studies, the duration of follow-up is\ninsufficient to provide complete outcome data on the pro-\ngression of the HCV disease because it is not feasible to\nconduct large-scale prospective studies that follow patients\nfrom infection to death (Seeff, 2002). The current study\ndraws strength from mortality data with all death records\nin the United States.

More importantly, they provided an\nalternative source of information with which to examine\nthe consequences of heavy drinking on HCV disease pro-\ngression as reflected in the age of death.\nAs with other observational studies, our inferences are\nsubject to measurement bias and confounding. The under-\ndiagnosis of HCV-infection is well established in the\nliterature, as a large proportion of the infected population\nhas no symptoms (Seeff, 2002). It is possible that the non-\nHAU group had a less chance of being diagnosed with\nHCV than did the HAU group due to less exposure to\nprevious medical presentations, liver function tests, or\ndevelopment of cirrhosis. Nonetheless, this underdiagno-\nsis may not bias mortality studies as much as morbidity\nstudies because decedents in the non-HAU group have\nincreased chances of being diagnosed with HCV once they\nhave developed symptoms of severe end-stage liver disease.\nTherefore, the underdiagnosis problem is not likely to\nobliterate the large differences in the proportion with\nHAU between the HCV and non-HCV deaths in our\nresults, as they are also consistent with previous studies\nBecause death certificates lack information on treatment\nexperiences, the effect of selectivity from interferon treat-\nment and liver transplantation cannot be assessed in our\nstudy. Because HAU lowers the efficacy of antiviral ther-\nalcohol users are often excluded from interferon-based\ntherapy. Liver transplantation for patients who have\nalcoholic liver diseases is highly selective, with many psy-\nchosocial criteria including abstinence from alcohol\n(McCallum and Masterton, 2006). These types of treat-\nment selectivity may have contributed to the shorter\nsurvival of the HCV deaths observed in the HAU group\nthan in the non-HAU group.\nThere are several limitations in this study. First, due to\nthe lack of information on the onset of the HCV infection,\nthe analysis assumed that the age of HCV infection was\nsimilarly distributed between the ``HCV plus HAU'' and\n``HCV without HAU'' categories. Under this assumption,\nthe mean age at death was used to reflect the duration of\ndisease progression of the 2 categories. If the onset of HCV\ninfection was at younger ages among heavy drinkers than\nnonheavy drinkers, the observed alcohol effect for the\n``HCV plus HAU'' category may be overestimated. Sec-\nond, because drinking history is not provided in death\ncertificates, it is impossible to establish the dose\u00adresponse\nrelationship between level of alcohol consumption and\npremature HCV deaths. The AIMC coded on death cer-\ntificates reflect heavy, problematic drinking. Therefore,\nthis study was not able to assess the effect of light and\nmoderate alcohol consumption. Third, using AIMC as a\nproxy for heavy drinking may underidentify heavy drink-\ners because not all heavy drinkers develop these medical\nconditions, and AIMC are generally under-reported on\nFinally, as Jamal and Morgan (2003) noted, studying the\neffects of alcohol and HCV on liver disease is complicated.\nBecause there is no information on the temporal sequenc-\ning of the onset of AIMC and HCV infection in the\nmortality data, it is almost impossible to separate\nthe effects of alcohol on HCV liver disease from the effects\nof HCV on alcoholic liver disease. Despite these limita-\ntions, the mortality data do confirm the significant impact\nof HCV and alcohol and their detrimental synergism.\nIn conclusion, this study is a new approach that is useful\nbecause it complements other approaches. The findings\nreported here provide mortality-based evidence to further\nestablish heavy alcohol consumption as one of the key risk\nfactors contributing to premature deaths from HCV in the\nUnited States. More importantly, this study, for the first\ntime, provides empirical evidence that alcohol consump-\ntion affects men and women differently in HCV mortality.\nFuture research should examine whether the alcohol effect\non HCV mortality varies across racial/ethnic groups, as\nthey differ in the rate of chronic HCV infection, response\nto treatment, and development of complications (Chen\nand Morgan, 2006). It will also be useful to examine the\nroles of other coinfections, such as HIV, in the relationship\nbetween HAU and HCV mortality.\nREFERENCES\nAlter MJ, Kruszon-Moran D, Nainan OV, McQuillan GM, Gao F,\nMoyer LA, Kaslow RA, Margolis HS (1999) The prevalence of hep-\nArmstrong GL, Alter MJ, McQuillan GM, Margolis HS (2000) The past\nincidence of hepatitis C virus infection: implications for the future\nburden of chronic liver disease in the United States.
