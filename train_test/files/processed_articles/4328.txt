In the\nresearch into state of language, much attention is paid to\ndetermination of factors, the interaction of which influences\nous that generation and modification of the state of language\ntake place due to a complex network of objective (linguistic,\ncultural-historical, demographic, geographical, economic,\nsocial-historical) and subjective (sociological and political)\nHowever, the fact that state of language has a procedural\ndynamic character means that the quality of functioning of\ntwo and more languages must be a leading indicator in the\ncharacteristics of states of language. Distribution of lan-\nguages in the sphere of public education, mass communica-\ntion, and culture shows not only demand of one or another\nlanguage in a definite sphere but also the degree of coverage\nof communicative demand by the given language, the\naccordance of its development with communicative tasks.\nFor instance, in the situation of mass bilingualism, there\narises a problem of functional potential of each of the lan-\nguages forming state of language.\nWhen studying state of language, specifically determina-\ntion of the status of languages,Ayupova (2000) and Baskakov\n(1994) proceed from the criterion of multifunctionality of a\nlanguage. This criterion is defined by a group of social func-\ntions performed by the language and often does not corre-\nspond with the legal status of language. It refers to the former\nUSSR republics when the republic's title language gets the\nstatus of the state language but is not used to the full in such\nintegrated state spheres as administration, industry, science,\ncommunication, and transportation. According to Baskakov,\nat the territory of the former USSR, only the Russian\n1Kostanay State University, Kazakhstan\nCorresponding Author:\nNatalya Mongilyova, Department of Foreign Philology, Kostanay State\nEmail: natmong@rambler.ru\nResearch Into Functioning of the State\nLanguage in the Situation of Mass\nBilingualism of North Kazakhstan Using\nthe Differential Technique\nNatalya Mongilyova1\n Keywords\nbilingualism, differential technique, state language\n2 SAGE Open\nlanguage complies with the criterion of multifunctionality,\nwhich is the reason of mass bilingualism in new post-Soviet\nCharacteristics of State of Language in\nthe Northern Region of Kazakhstan\nFunctioning of languages in modern Kazakhstan has its\nunique features. On one hand, we can observe the co-exis-\ntence of a big amount of typologically and genetically differ-\nent languages (more than 130 nations and nationalities live in\nthe country); on the other hand, we can state the existence of\ntwo most wide-spread languages--Kazakh and Russian. But\nstudy of this situation rarely becomes the object of the\nresearch (Zhikeyeva, 2011) or is not conducted in a sociolin-\nguistic aspect but within the theory of discourse, for instance\nState of language of the northern region of Kazakhstan is\ncharacterized by mass Kazakh\u00adRussian and Russian\u00adKazakh\nbilingualism (Zhikeyeva, 2011).According to the authors, state\nof language in modern Kazakhstan is the direct reflection of\npolitical, ethnical, demographic, social, and economic changes\nin society. Revival of national culture and spirituality is accom-\npanied with strengthening the vitality of the state Kazakh lan-\nguage as well as support of the vitality of the Russian language\nthat was acknowledged as the official language in Kazakhstan.\nKazakh and Russian languages mutually function within the\nuniversal communicative space (Suleimenova & Smagulova,\n2005). That is, as in other republics of the former USSR, the\nlanguage of the title nation was recognized as the state lan-\nguage. As a consequence, there is a misbalance between the\nofficial status of languages and the real state of language when\nRussian is dominant in all socially important spheres of com-\nmunication (even in the flow of documents, the share of the\nKazakh language does not exceed 80%).\nEthnical Kazakhs living in the north of Kazakhstan are\nmostly bilingual; they speak both Kazakh and Russian,\nswitching from one language to the other regardless of the\ndegree of knowledge of these languages. A speaker joins the\nlanguage of the interlocutor or answers a question asked in\nRussian using Kazakh; a conversation may consist of Kazakh\nand Russian phrases. On the example of dialogues of resi-\ndents of Kazakhstan, it is possible to research all types and\nkinds of language interference. According to the 2009 popu-\nlation census, 99% of the entire population of Kostanay\nregion understand Russian, 96% write fluently in Russian\nHowever, various sociological surveys in which questions\nabout language skills suggest yes/no replies do not reflect the\nobjective situation. Ethnical Kazakhs understand a question\nof language skills in different ways: Some are satisfied with\nthe fact of language fluency in everyday situations, others\nthink that the conversation in common language cannot be\nequal to speaking literary language, so the latter do not con-\nsider they can speak Kazakh.\nTherefore, the current statistical data do not reflect the\nreal state of language, as they divide respondents into\nKazakh-speaking and Russian-speaking, but in fact, northern\nKazakhs use both languages. In any case, they understand\nRussian and Kazakh, and the preference in the choice of the\nlanguage in a certain situation gives the idea of the real func-\ntioning of the language, including the state one.\nIn describing state of language in northern Kazakhstan, it\nis necessary to note the following. There is no dominance of\nRussian in communicative space. Communicative environ-\nment of Kostanay region was formed by the leading Russian\nlanguage due to historical reasons: departure of Kazakhs\nbecause of mass famine in the 30s of the 19th century, terri-\ntorial contacts of Kazakhstan and Russia, migration process\nin connection with deportation of peoples in the period of\nStalin repressions, evacuation of Soviet enterprises during\nthe Great Patriotic War, mass migration of the Russian-\nspeaking population during cultivation of virgin lands, and\nso on. Ethnical Kazakhs comprised numeric minority in\nKostanay region up to the beginning of the 21st century\nmance of the state language functions by Kazakh does not\nmean return to the previous state of language (which never\nexisted) but formation of new communicative functions of\nKazakh as the basic language in communicative space.\nMethod\nIt is language functionality, its integration in all social\nspheres, which must be the criterion of the status of a lan-\nguage in society. Which of the languages a bilingual uses in\neveryday communication when buying bread, bringing up\nchildren, working at the enterprise, and passing the time is\nthe main indicator of multifunctionality of a language.\nAkhmetzhanova (2001) claims that the study of bilingualism\nof social-demographic groups of informants allows analyz-\ning the dynamics of bilingualism development in Kazakhstan\nand making a prognosis about the direction of the process of\nmass bilingualism. Following Akhmetzhanova, such groups\nwere distinguished. The objective of the research was to find\nthe technique to state the level of the functioning of two lan-\nguages in figures. To define the index number of communi-\ncative functionality of Kazakh and Russian languages, the\ndifferential technique was used.\nThe research into state of language with the differential\ntechnique conducted by the author allows stating the domi-\nnant language of routine behavior in the situation of bilin-\ngualism, defining language preference in social spheres, and\ndetermining the direction of expanding communicative pos-\nsibilities of a language. When a bilingual uses either first or\nsecond language, the differential technique defines the coef-\nficient of language preference.\nA traditional questionnaire of situation analysis widely\nused in sociolinguistics was used in the research method\nMongilyova 3\na questionnaire, we used the scaling technique that was\ndeveloped in psychology and linguistics to get quantitative\nindicators when evaluating the attitude of test subjects to\nvarious notions, Ch. Osgood's classical differential tech-\nnique served as an example. Thus, instead of traditional yes/\nno answers for the questionnaire, the scaling technique sug-\ngests variants of answers (in this research, from \"only\nKazakh\" to \"only Russian\"), which allows minimizing the\nlevel of abstraction in answers and reaching the accuracy of\nthe experiment. For instance,\nIn which language do you read application instructions\nfor household appliances, information about products\ncomposition?\nTo define distribution of communicative functions\nbetween Kazakh and Russian languages, a number of ques-\ntions were worked out that cover various situations of the\nuse of Kazakh and Russian languages. First of all, we pro-\nceeded from the statement about basic functions of the lan-\nguage (communicative and cognitive); therefore, we\nformulated questions concerning various situations of\ncommunication and information comprehension. Also,\nwhen making up questions about the choice of the lan-\nguage as a means of communication, we imagined a usual\nday of an average Kostanay city resident and decided to\nsimulate situations in which he or she happens to be during\nthe day. Furthermore, we generalized them according to\nthe spheres of social communication (work, home, trans-\nport, street, etc.).\nAs the author and research participants (university stu-\ndents) live in Kostanay city, we took into consideration the\npeculiarities of communicative behavior of Kostanay region\nresidents. As it was mentioned above, the Russian language\nin Kostanay historically has been the basic language of com-\nmunication in all spheres; that is why ethnical Kazakhs, as a\nrule, speak to ethnical Russians in Russian (Kazakhs have\nAsian appearance, Russians--Slavic; ethnical identity is\nexpressed externally). But they will try to speak in Kazakh\nto ethnical Kazakhs, especially if a communicant is older.\n(During the discussion, Kazakh students spoke about this as\nan obligation. There are even cases when they are not sure\nthat their language skills will allow them to speak in Kazakh,\nand in such situations, a young person may even refuse to\ntalk.) In the Kazakh mentality, respect to the elders and fol-\nlowing the traditions are the leading concepts defining rou-\ntine behavior. In the situation when it is possible to choose\nthe language, addressing a person in the native language is a\nsign of respect, following the tradition. Therefore, we would\nlike to find out to what extent Kazakh performs its commu-\nnicative functions in situations when Kazakhs consciously\nchoose Kazakh. Discussing situations for the questionnaire,\nwe asked students to think when they spoke Kazakh during\nthe day. As a result of interviewing students, there were\nstated questions such as, \"In which language do you con-\ngratulate your relatives?\" \"In which language do you listen\nto songs?\" and others. These questions cover the peculiari-\nties of the Kazakh culture, such as musicality of Kazakh eth-\nnos (there is a proverb: A Kazakh is born with a song and\ndies with a song), as well as importance of Word in Kazakh\ntradition. In the Kazakh culture, there are special words\n(bata; Shaymerdenova & Avakova, 2010), words for wish-\ning good things, and in such a ritualized situation of com-\nmunication variation in the choice of the language is possible\n(as distinguished, for example, from the situation of express-\ning condolences when a speaker is obliged to use the lan-\nguage of the addressee). Thus, the situation of congratulating\nrelatives was reflected in the questionnaire.\nThe sphere of family communication was presented by\nthe questions concerning communication with parents and\nwith children. As in the children\u00adparents line, there are laws\nof tradition and respect; as it was said before, we wanted to\ndeduce to what degree communicants follow the same prin-\nciples in relation to their children in their own families or in\ncommunication with younger relatives.\nThe question concerning communication with colleagues\nhas a mark \"with colleagues of Kazakh nationality\" to check\nthe degree of functionality of Kazakh in business sphere, as\nit is obvious that communication with Russian colleagues is\nconducted in Russian. The question, \"In which language do\nyou think and express your ideas fluently and naturally?\" is\nconnected with the preference of the language when form-\ning thoughts and constructing new information.\nThe questionnaire of situation analysis has an introduc-\ntion in which there is an address to respondents with specifi-\ncation of the purpose of the survey, degree of anonymity,\nsociodemographic data about the respondent (gender, age,\nnative language, place of residence city/village, language of\neducation).\nAs a result, the questionnaire of situation analysis is the\nfollowing:\n1. Which language do you use in communication with\nparents?\n2. In which language do you speak to your children?\n3. Which language do you use in communication with\nfriends of Kazakh nationality?\n4. In which language to you congratulate your\nrelatives?\n5. Which language do you use in professional activity\n(at work, study)?\n6. In which language do you communicate with col-\nleagues of Kazakh nationality?\n7. In which language do you watch TV shows?\n8. In which language do you read study literature (sci-\nentific, connected with profession)?\nOnly\nKazakh\nKazakh,\nsometimes\nRussian\nMore Ka-\nzakh than\nRussian\nKazakh and\nRussian\nequally\nMore Rus-\nsian than\nKazakh\nRussian,\nsometimes\nKazakh\nOnly Rus-\nsian\n4 SAGE Open\n9. In which language do you watch (listen to) the news?\n10. In which language do you read fiction?\n11. In which language do you listen to songs?\n12. In which language do you read application instruc-\ntions for household appliances, information about\nfoodstuff composition, instructions for drugs?\n13. In which language do you speak in public places\n(shops, pay-offices, means of transportation, social\nservices, etc.)?\n14. In which language do you read newspapers?\n15. In which language do you text messages, chat online,\ncommunicate in social networks?\n16. In which language can you express your thoughts\nfluently?\n17. How you do estimate the degree of your language\nskills? Russian: fluent/good, but not fluent/bad/\nunderstand, but cannot speak/do not understand.\nKazakh: fluent/good, but not fluent/bad/understand,\nbut cannot speak/do not understand.\nAs it can be seen from the questionnaire, situations can be\ngeneralized according to social spheres:\nfamily communication (with parents, children, friends, in\nwhich language do you congratulate relatives);\nbusiness communication (in which language do you com-\nmunicate at work, with colleagues, with colleagues of\nKazakh nationality);\neveryday communication (public places); and\nethnocultural communication (congratulating relatives,\nchoice of the language when listening to songs).\nA number of questions defined the function of the Kazakh\nlanguage in getting knowledge and new information (infor-\nmation at labels, reading books, study textbooks, news,\nradio, television, newspapers).\nCalculation of results was conducted in the following\nway.\nThe coefficient is calculated by the technique of adding\nthe indicator of each question and division on the total num-\nber of questions. The total amount of questions is 17, but the\nanswer to the seventeenth question is studied separately.\nThat is why the sum of questions indicators is divided by 16.\nN is the sum of indicators in the questionnaire, for exam-\nple, n = 3 + (-1) + (-2) + . . ., and so on.\nK (coefficient of functionality) = n\\16.\nThe closer K is to 0, the more respondent's bilingualism is\nbalanced. Symbol \"-\" or \"+\" of the total indicator shows\ngeneral preference of the language: more Russian if it is +K,\nor more Kazakh if it is -K. It is possible to define both the\ncoefficient of a separate respondent and total preference of\nthe language in each sphere, in a certain situation.\nAnalysis of the Experiment Results\nAbout 400 residents of north Kazakhstan (Kostanay city and\nits districts) took part in the survey; 162 of them are male and\n234 are female. The ages of the participants are as follows:\nThe total results of the research were predictable in cer-\ntain parameters, but some indicators turned out to be surpris-\ning. So the table 1 shows the coefficients of functionality in\nthe sphere of family communication:\nAll coefficients are marked with the symbol \"-\", which\nmeans the choice of Kazakh as the language of communi-\ncation. It is worth noting that the sphere of family commu-\nnication is the obvious preference of Kazakh, but the\nlanguage of communication with parents has a higher indi-\ncator than the language of communication with children.\nThat is, the coefficient of Kazakh of those respondents\nwho choose Kazakh more often when talking to parents is\n3 times less in communication with children (the most fre-\nquent answer is \"Russian and Kazakh equally\"). This ten-\ndency was observed in all answers, but in no questionnaire\nsheet was the answer to the question about communication\nwith children higher than in that about communication\nwith parents (see Table 1). It was the same or lower. Even\nthe coefficient of functionality of Kazakh in communica-\ntion with friends is much higher than that with children.\nThis confirms the opinion that the use of Kazakh is con-\nnected also with respect and following the traditions.\nHowever, it is surprising that respondents do not demand\nthe same from their children.\nAnalysis of functionality of the Kazakh and Russian lan-\nguages in the sphere of ethnocultural communication showed\nthe following:\nMore preference to Kazakh turned out to be in the ques-\ntion concerning congratulating relatives (the most frequent\nanswer, 150 of all respondents answered \"only Kazakh\" or\nTable 1. Close Circle of Contacts (Family, Friends).\nAnalyzed situation\nCoefficient of functionality\n\"-\" Preference of Kazakh\n\"+\" Preference of Russian\nCommunication with parents -0.33\nOnly\nKazakh\nKazakh,\nsometimes\nRussian\nMore\nKazakh\nthan\nRussian\nRussian\nand\nKazakh\nequally\nMore\nRussian\nthan\nKazakh\nRussian,\nsometimes\nKazakh\nOnly\nRussian\nMongilyova 5\n\"more Kazakh\") (see Table 2). Here, the coefficient is almost\ntwice higher than in the indicator of communication with\nparents. It is accounted for by a big value of a word, parting\nwords (bota) in Kazakh culture, especially pronounced on\ncelebrations and family gatherings; in such situations, even a\nperson whose Kazakh is bad tries to prepare a worthy con-\ngratulatory speech in Kazakh not to offend the older genera-\ntion. Popularity of modern song creativity in Kazakh can be\nexplained by attachment to ethnocultural traditions, even\nthough the coefficient is closer to 0, the most popular answer\n(210 respondents) was \"Kazakh and Russian equally.\"\nThe Sphere of Business and Everyday\nCommunication\nThe results show that in business and everyday spheres, both\nRussian and Kazakh are used with a slight preference of\nRussian (see Table 3). In variants of answers, it is expressed\nas \"more Russian than Kazakh\"; the coefficient does not\nexceed 1. The fact that, when communicating with Kazakh\ncolleagues, respondents choose Russian more often is not\nfavorable for Kazakh. These indicators confirm the sugges-\ntion that residents of north Kazakhstan use both Kazakh and\nRussian as a means of communication, preferring Russian.\nAnalysis of Questions About Getting New\nInformation and Acquiring Knowledge\nNevertheless, Russian gets more preference in situations\nconnected with the use of language as a means of acquiring\nknowledge, new information (see Table 4).\nThe comparison of coefficients allows stating that Kazakh\nspeakers perceive aural texts in Kazakh (songs, radio, TV)\nbetter than written ones (books, study literature, newspapers,\nmagazines, chats). The results demonstrate that when watch-\ning TV shows and the news, they choose both Kazakh and\nRussian with the preference of the latter (\"more Russian than\nKazakh\"). In situations of acquiring information and knowl-\nedge through reading, there is an obvious misbalance in\nfavor of Russian. The role of Russian in information space\nmay be considered as an implicit mechanism of globalization\nof the language; the situation is similar to the expansion of\nEnglish in South Korea (Piller & Cho, 2013) and French in\nA number of situations were aimed at defining functional\nload between languages in forming thoughts and text produc-\ntion, where final texts are compiled in Russian, with a slight\npreference of Russian in thinking process (see Table5).\nRandom comparative analysis did not elicit much differ-\nence in gender distinction, place of residence city/village.\nHowever, the decisive factor of increasing multifunctionality\nof Kazakh was the language of education.\nInfluence of the Language of Education\non the Choice of the Language in\nCommunication\nThe comparison of the results of answers of respondents edu-\ncated in Kazakh and in Russian shows the increase in the\nshare of Kazakh in all situations (see Table 6).\nTable 2.

If respondents educated in Russian use\nmore Russian in professional activity (+1.164) with their col-\nleagues who are ethnical Kazakhs, they try to speak less\nRussian (+0.428), but the coefficients of respondents edu-\ncated in Kazakh do not change at all.\nPreference to Russian in acquiring knowledge and new\ninformation of respondents educated in Russian is accounted\nfor the difference between colloquial and standard Kazakh,\nso they have difficulties in perceiving scientific texts in\nKazakh. However, the analysis of the results of respondents\neducated in Kazakh also indicates preference to Russian,\nthough to a lesser degree. According to the author, such\nresults can be explained by the fact that Russian gives more\naccess to information space in terms of both scientific litera-\nture and fiction. Students educated in Kazakh often say that\nthey read textbooks in Russian but have to translate into\nKazakh to prepare for lessons.\nInfluence of Age Differences on the\nDistribution of Functions Between\nKazakh and Russian Languages\nFor this purpose, two groups of respondents were selected:\nthe younger group and the group of respondents above 36, as\nwe decided that the latter is more involved in public life than\nthe group of people above 50 (see Table 7).\nComparative analysis confirms that there is a decrease in\nthe share of Kazakh in communication of young respon-\ndents according to all indicators. The coefficient in com-\nmunicative situations ranges from +0.5 (communication\nwith parents) to +1.3 (communication in public places),\nwhich shows that using both Russian and Kazakh with pref-\nerence to Russian, young people do not see the difference\nbetween situations of communication and use both lan-\nguages equally. The difference in indicators of respondents\nwho are above 36 is much bigger: from -1.4 (communica-\ntion with parents) to +2 (communication with colleagues).\nThe difference in coefficients between \"communication\nwith parents\" (-1.4) and \"communication with children\"\n(-0.12) of respondents above 36 is also surprising. Despite\nsuch a tremulous attitude to the native language, while\ncommunicating with their children, respondents do not try\nso much to speak Kazakh as they do it while communicat-\ning with their parents. Such indicators indirectly prove\npreference to Russian of respondents aged 17 to 25. The\nresults of the survey of young people are depressing because\nthey were born in a new state and grew up having obliga-\ntory lessons of Kazakh in kindergarten, primary school, and\nso on. The results raise questions about the effectiveness of\nlanguage policy carried out by the government.\nDefinition of the Native Language\nAccording to Ethnical Feature\nThe results of the answer to the question in the introduction\nconcerning \"native language\" arouse a special interest. Of\n400 respondents, only 15 indicated Russian as their native\nTable 6. Comparative Analysis of the Results of Answers of Respondents Educated in Kazakh and in Russian.\nAnalyzed situation\nCoefficient of the respondents\neducated in Kazakh\nCoefficient of the respondents\neducated in Russian\nMongilyova 7\nlanguage. The rest, regardless of the share of Kazakh in their\nspeech, do not doubt saying that Kazakh is their native lan-\nguage. We studied questionnaires of respondents whose indi-\nvidual total coefficient is higher than +2 (from +2.13 to\n+2.85), which means most of their answers are \"only\nRussian\"; there are 48 of them, and to the exclusion of three\nquestionnaires, all of them indicate Kazakh as their native\nlanguage. The introduction also included the request to esti-\nmate language skills in Russian and Kazakh according to the\nscale \"fluent\u00adgood, but not fluent\u00adbad\u00adunderstand, but can-\nnot speak\u00addo not understand.\" So, out of the 48 respondents\nindicating Kazakh as their native language, 12 people (25%)\nchose \"do not understand\" Kazakh. On the contrary, of those\nwho indicated Russian as their native language, 6 people\n(40%) chose \"do not understand\" Kazakh, and their individ-\nual coefficients range from +0.69 to +2.81, that is, the share\nof Kazakh is much bigger. These respondents are ethnically\nKazakh and try to use Kazakh, study it, and include it in their\nlife. It turns out that objective conception of which language\nis one's native causes the desire to study the language of your\nethnos.\nSuch results mean that in the communicative space of\nnorth Kazakhstan, the notion of \"native language\" needs\ndeciphering. Indeed, there are several definitions of the con-\ncept \"native language.\" It is the name of a language acquired\nin infancy by imitating adults (O. S.Akhmanova), a language\nthat was studied first (U. Weinreich; quoted by Avrorin,\n1975). This approach does not clarify anything if we speak\nabout bilingual communicative space, wherein the family\nadults choose either one language code or the other. Avrorin\n(1975) thinks that it is necessary to expand the content of the\nnotion \"native language\" depending on the degree of lan-\nguage skills (pp. 124-148). The language in which the person\nor group of people speak fluently and actively in any case of\nlife should be considered native--if they do not only speak\nand understand it but also think in it without using the mental\noperation of translation into the other language.\nNevertheless, the results of the research show quite the\ncontrary situation. The concept of \"native language\" for resi-\ndents of Kazakhstan is directly connected with the ethnical\nfeature. A respondent with distinctively dominating Russian\nindicates Kazakh as the native language as it is the language\nof their ethnos. Thereat, none of the respondents hesitated\nabout the choice of the native language, and no one (!) tried\nto indicate both languages. Avrorin notes that a person can\ncall the language they know well their native language, not\nthe language they are attracted to (Avrorin, 1975). Also, he\nsays that if one should proceed from linguistic meaning of\nthe term native language, a person may have two or three\nnative languages, and in this situation of bilingualism in\ndefining the native language, the ethnical feature becomes\ndecisive. This choice of the respondents is explained by this.\nOn one hand, a person can only approximately give an\nobjective estimation of their language skills. The question-\nnaire offered the scale of answers, but the results concerning\nthis point are questionable. Respondents (42 people)\nanswered \"do not understand\" to the question on the degree\nof language skills in Kazakh, but general indicators of the\ncoefficient are from +0.73 (it is a relatively balanced bilin-\ngualism!) to +2.81, and among the answers, there is a variant\n\"Kazakh and Russian equally\" in the questions about the lan-\nguage of communication with parents and friends.\nRespondents may have answered \"do not understand\" think-\ning about grammar or its literary variant. In turn, the answers\nabout language skills in Russian are more objective. There is\na dependence between answers to the question about skills in\nRussian and the general coefficient: The answers \"bad,\"\n\"understand, but do not speak\" always correspond to the \"-\"\nTable 7. Comparative Analysis of Coefficients of Functionality of Two Age Groups.\nAnalyzed situation Respondents aged 17-25 Respondents above 36\n8 SAGE Open\ncoefficient, that is, there is misbalance in favor of Kazakh\n(there are no answers \"do not understand\" at all).\nAccording to the ethnical feature, respondents sincerely\nthink that Kazakh is their native language regardless of the\ndegree of their skills. Most part of Kazakh in answers about\nsongs and congratulations of relatives proves the attachment\nto this language; these situations indirectly reflect the prior-\nity of the language in its expressive function.\nEthnical self-consciousness distinguishes Kazakh as\ndominant regardless of communicative indicators. Self-\nidentity as a part of the ethnos is reflected in respectful atti-\ntude to the language. Such a difference of coefficients of\nrespondents of older and younger generations can be\nexplained by this. For a young man, ethnical identity is\naccounted for by itself, they answer such questions automati-\ncally. Conscious comprehension of one's own culture and\nfollowing tradition come with age--and along with it, cer-\ntain responsibility for their people and language.Aa 17-year-\nold respondent is more involved in information space where\nRussian and English are dominating. Older respondents (36\nand above) prefer Kazakh for communication becouse they\nspeak Kazakh--it is both respect to the speaker and part of\nthe ritual, and the way to establish trust with the interlocutor.\nAn adult understands what in their personality is formed\nunder the influence of ethnical traditions and which actions\nare approved in their culture; all these are expressed in the\nuse of the language of their ethnos. That is why, those respon-\ndents in our research who answered \"do not understand\"\nabout the language skills in Kazakh (42 people) aspire to\nbroaden their knowledge; coefficients show that they often\nwatch the news, TV shows, and read newspapers in Kazakh.\nThese are the situations in which those who speak Kazakh\nfluently use more Russian.\nSummary\nAnalysis of questionnaires shows that the choice of Kazakh\nis made in the direction of middle-aged generation to the\nelder generation. Even according to the age criterion, prefer-\nence to Kazakh is given more by respondents who are above\n30. Thus, the effectiveness of language policy aimed at\nyounger generation (increase in lessons of Kazakh at school,\nuniversities, various events, measures of encouragement,\netc.) is questionable.\nThe research demonstrates that the use of Kazakh by\nKazakh-speaking residents of north Kazakhstan is obliga-\ntory and unconditional in situations when respect to the\nelders (parents, aksakals) and respect for family traditions\n(congratulations of relatives, congratulatory speeches at cel-\nebrations) is concerned. That is, Kazakh speech is also con-\nnected with ethnical self-identity and cultural identity.\nHowever, the older a person is, the more definite their plans\nfor the future are. Connecting their further life with\nKazakhstan, respondents of older generation better under-\nstand the necessity to know Kazakh (flow of documents,\nrequirements at work) and consciously speak more Kazakh\nto improve their skills. We may suggest that for ethnical\nRussians, who are residents of Kazakhstan in the second,\nthird, and generations thereafter, it will be possible to use\nKazakh in case they realize their affiliation with Kazakh\nculture and the state of Kazakhstan. Propaganda of the\nKazakh language as an inevitable part of the Kazakhstan\nnation (not only Kazakh ethnos); knowledge of the language\nas a sign of respect for values of a multiethnic state is also a\nlong-term direction of language policy.\nStudy of public functions of languages in the situation of\nbilingualism allows estimating objectively the state of lan-\nguage and defining the extralinguistic factor that determines\nthis state, which will allow us to reveal the language problem\nwith its subsequent solution.\nThe proposed differential technique is also convenient as\nthe questionnaire may be infinitely specified according to the\ntypes of communication in each sphere, defining the priority\nof languages in the informative, expressive, and other func-\ntions. For instance, business communication may suggest\nmany questions; so the point \"which language do you use at\nwork\" may be more specified into \"communication with the\nemployer,\" \"communication with employees,\" \"with col-\nleagues,\" \"with Russian colleagues,\" and so on. The neces-\nsity of a balanced language policy determines relevance of\nsuch kind of research. In this context, scientific study and\ndescription of the specific character of the northern region of\nKazakhstan become topical.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAkhmetzhanova, Z.
