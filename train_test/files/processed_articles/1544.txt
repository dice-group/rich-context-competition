Some analysts report that\nseasons influence affective disorders [19]. Others indicate\nthat cold and long winter nights increase suicide rates [78].\nIn many cultures, there is a popular belief that the weather,\nseasons, and even lunar cycles may be associated with\ncase for a possible effect of the natural environment on\nhumans, pointing out that ``the seasons in their course,\nexact a marked influence'' on human behavior.\nAmong earlier quantitative efforts to provide empirical\nevidence in support of the impact of seasonality on suicide\nwas the work of Morselli [55]. He compiled suicide and\nclimatic data on 28 European countries in the late nine-\nteenth century and observed that the seasonal regularity in\nannual suicide statistics was ``too great for it to be attrib-\nuted to chance of the human will'' (p. 120). Morselli [55]\nindicated that the temperate part of Europe provided the\nmost favorable environment for suicide and that most\nsuicides took place during summer, with the fewest taking\nplace in winter. He was among the first to point out that\nmood disorders could be influenced by the weather, con-\ncluding, for example, that temperature increased suicide\nrisk by interfering with brain functions.\nIn his book Suicide, Durkheim [18] observed correlations\nbetween suicide and day of the week and month of the year,\nadding that these associations displayed certain similarities\nof form and origin. He generalized that suicide is higher in\nthe first part of new periods (e.g., start of the week), and\nlower at the end of new periods (e.g., end of the week). In\naddition, Durkheim [18] found that most suicides occurred\nin the afternoon. In accounting for these findings, however,\nA. J. Kposowa (&) \u00c1 S. D'Auria\nDepartment of Sociology, University of California,\ne-mail: augustine.kposowa@ucr.edu; ajkposowa@sbcglobal.net\nS. D'Auria\ne-mail: sdaur001@student.ucr.edu\nhe discounted the role of climatic and temporal factors,\nindicating that ``to explain it one could certainly not refer to\nthe action of the sun and the temperature'' (p. 117). He\nproposed instead that sociological variables mediated the\nrelationship between the temporal associations and suicide.\nAs he put it, the environmental explanation ``...being dis-\ncarded, we have but one other possible, namely, that day\nfavors suicide because this is time of most active existence,\nwhen human relations cross and recross, when social life is\nmost intense...Whatever information is available to us as to\nhow suicide is distributed among the different hours of the\nday or the different days of the week confirms this view'' (p.\n117). Durkheim also reported that most suicides occurred in\nthe spring, not summer. To explain this observation, he once\nagain downplayed the role of the natural environment, and\nwent instead for a sociological explanation. According to\nhim, most suicides took place in spring because ``everything\nbegins to awake; activity is resumed, relations spring up,\ninterchanges increase.'' (p. 119). In other words, it is the\ndensity of human interactions, and not the environment that\ncaused higher incidence of suicide in spring. Thus, although\n[18] examined the role of cosmic factors in the etiology of\nsuicide, he moved away from attributing direct association\nwith them. In his view, the natural environment had no\ndirect bearing on the incidence of suicide, which he felt\ndepended on social conditions and the intensity of human\ninteractions, or what Massing and Angermeyer [51] have\ndescribed as the varying intensity of social life. Thus, sui-\ncide was not a direct result of physical or climatic\nconditions.\nMore contemporary quantitative studies on the rela-\ntionship between temporal variables and suicide, however,\nhave produced a major puzzle. Some investigators have\nreported associations between seasonality and suicide [7,\nincidence of suicide in southeastern Australia shows a clear\nseasonal pattern. They found that suicides peak during\nspring and summer months, indicating a positive associa-\ntion between suicide incidents and prevailing sunlight\nlevels. In contrast, Edwards and Whitlock [21] found a\nspring peak in the number of suicides committed in Bris-\nbane, Australia, but the results were not statistically sig-\nnificant. Dublin [16] reported that the incidence of suicide\nvaried according to seasons in the northern hemisphere, but\ncontrary results were found for the southern hemisphere.\nLandau and Fridman [43, p. 164] affirmed that ``Much of\nprevious research on this topic has produced inconsistent\nand contradictory findings.'' For example, although Rotton\n[68] observed a significant relationship between winter\nmonths (December, January, and February) and suicide, the\nsigns were in the negative direction, a finding that con-\ntradicts those reported by Barraclough [4], Gabennesch\nEngland and Wales, Page et al. [59, p. 109] contradicted\nmany prior findings of a spring or summer peak in suicide\ndeaths, noting instead that most suicides occur in January\n(winter). A review of 27 quantitative studies by Deisen-\nhammer [14] reported that much of the literature on sea-\nsonality and suicide is contradictory.\nPast research\nMost researchers who have identified an association\nbetween seasonality and suicide found a peak during the\nstudy that involved 20 countries and found an early sum-\nmer peak. They concluded that the seasonal variation in\nsuicide incidence could be explained by the increase in\nsunshine in summer months. A relationship between sun-\nshine, high temperatures and suicide rate has since been\nDeisenhammer's [14] review of the existing literature\nfound that most studies failed to control for potentially\nconfounding variables, a situation that seriously calls into\nquestion the validity of some claims. Further, adding to the\ncontroversy are findings with regard to sex differences in\nthe seasonal distribution of suicides [5, 65]. Several\ninvestigators have found that the seasonal suicide incidence\nhas one peak in spring for men and a bimodal peak, one in\nspring and one in autumn, for women [23, 53]. However,\none peak in spring or summer, regardless of sex differ-\nences, has been found in the United States [45] and Taiwan\nAt the cross-national level, researchers have found evi-\ndence in support of the influence of season, climate, month,\nand week on intentional violence. Kok [35] reported a\nstrong relationship between climatic variables such as\ntemperature, wind speed, rainfall and humidity and suicide\nin Singapore. Using regression analysis in France, Souetre\net al. [73] noted that among all the variables analyzed, the\nmain factors affecting the regional distribution of suicide\nwere ambient temperature and sunlight duration.\nIn a study based on the US population, MacMahon [50]\n1978. He found that in each year, suicides peaked in late\nspring and dropped in winter. In each month, suicides\npeaked on the fifth day and dropped until the end of the\nmonth. In terms of days, MacMahon [50] reported that\nsuicides peaked on Monday and dropped to weekend lows.\nIn a replication of the MacMahon [50] study, McCleary\net al. [52] found support for the effects of days of the week,\nbut no support was found for months on suicide rates in the\nUnited States. In the years following these studies, there\nhas been relatively little research on the relationship\nbetween day of the week and suicide in the United States.\nIn a West German study undertaken by Lamp [42]\nseason of the year, especially summer had an impact on\nrape, theft, and other forms of violence, but not on suicide.\nMaldonado and Kraus [49] studied suicides committed in\nand found that the occurrence of suicide varied substan-\ntially by time of day, with the fewest taking place between\nwere most frequent on Monday, and this held true for both\nmales and females, regardless of age. They observed no\nsignificant finding with regard to month or lunar phase.\nMaldonado and Kraus [49] also remarked that suicides\noccur at an almost equal frequency during the seasons.\nOther works on the relationship between temporal fac-\ntors and suicide have been done by Hassan [24] and Stack\nstudy the impact of moon phase, day of the week, month of\nthe year, and season. According to Hassan [24, p. 89], the\nhighest incidence of suicide for both men and women was\non Mondays, a finding consistent with those of Maldonado\nand Kraus [49]. With regard to seasons, however, Hassan\ncontradicted findings by Maldonado and Kraus and\naffirmed that in Australia, suicides do vary according to\nseasons. For both men and women, the highest incidence of\nsuicide in Australia tended to occur in the spring. With\nregard to lunar phases, Hassan [24, p. 89] observed ``that\nexcept for the Full Moon Day, the average daily suicide in\nvarious lunar phases varies only slightly.'' He noted that\nthe mean suicide for the Full Moon Day was higher than\nthe daily mean in different lunar phases.\nStack [74] retested Gabennesch's argument that tem-\nporal factors affect suicide because of an unfavorable\ncontrast between raised expectations and reality. According\nto Gabennesch [22] weekends, holidays, and new seasons\nraise expectations for a better mood. They also offer hope\nfor a new and better beginning at the end of the holiday,\nweek, or season. If these raised expectations are not ful-\nfilled, the suicidal individual may feel deprived and\ndepressed, and may subsequently destroy himself/herself\n[22]. In short, disappointments, resulting from unfulfilled\nexpectations explain higher suicides on certain days (as\nopposed to others), and in certain months (as opposed to\nothers). In re-testing the above ideas, Stack [74, p. 318]\nfound that suicides peak in the spring months (March,\nApril, and May).\nSome scholars report that the seasonality of suicides has\nOravecz et al. [58] compared data on suicides in Slovenia\n1998 and found that the seasonal influence on suicide\nstudied the suicide incidence in England and Wales\nsonal variation in suicide rate present in England and\ngreatly decreased. A recent multicentre study in England\nand Wales [26] observed temporal patterns of self-harm,\nwith diurnal variations in time of presentation to hospital\ngation was, however, limited to deliberate self-harm and\ndid not include completed suicides. In addition, no effort\nwas made by the authors to control for day of the week or\nseason.\nAs the foregoing review has shown that several analysts\nhave found either no relationship between temporal vari-\nables and suicide, or have reported conflicting findings [4,\nbe pointed out to all those who are interested in man's\nseasonal behavior that there is little likelihood of finding\nany clear-cut relationship between atmospheric conditions\nand human behavior...Man's reactions are not going to be\neasy to understand, and so, there is no reason to expect an\nearly resolution to the socio-economic/biometeorological\ndebate on suicide.''\nThe present study offers an opportunity to reexamine the\nassociation between temporal factors and suicide with the\naim of resolving some of the inconsistencies in the existing\nliterature. An added advantage of the present analysis over\nprevious ones is the use of a nationally representative\nsample, and the entire universe of suicide deaths occurring\nin the United States. To increase statistical power, and to\navoid drawing false inferences based on unexpected yearly\nhierarchical models are specified.\nThe present study employs a multi-level approach to\ninvestigate the association of temporal factors and suicide\nrisk. The response variable is suicide risk measured at the\nindividual level. The predictor variables are measured at\nboth level 1 (individual) and level 2 (US state). A\nnumber of research questions are addressed: (1) Are days\nof the week associated with suicide? (2) Are seasons of\nthe year related to suicide? (3) Do states with high sui-\ncide rates influence individual suicide risk? (4) Do\nobserved daily and seasonal patterns in suicide risk hold\nfor Whites and Non-Whites? (5) What are the implica-\ntions of answers to the above questions for past and\nfuture research?\nAnalytical strategy\nIn multi-level data with a categorical response variable, it\nis desirable to use a hierarchical generalized linear mod-\neling technique that incorporates a unique random effect\ninto the equation for each higher level observation. This\napproach produces more robust standard errors than those\nproduced via techniques that do not allow nested models\n[66]. In contextual analysis, dependence may arise because\nindividuals within a given level 2 unit for example, the\nstate, have shared experiences and expectations. In short,\npersons within a state may have more in common with\ntheir state citizens than with individuals residing in other\nstates. The situation is similar to `design effect' issues that\narise in complex surveys due to clustering of observations,\nand hence the need to obtain robust standard errors by\napplying appropriate variance estimation techniques. In\nmulti-level models with binary outcomes, therefore, cal-\nculated standard errors must adjust for the variability in\nrandom effects [66]. In the present analysis, the GLIM-\nMIX procedure in SAS 9.2 [69] was used to estimate\nparameters.\nHierarchical modeling approaches are rare in the suicide\nliterature in general. A search of PUBMED (http://www.\nncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) [61] and Sociological Abstracts (http://\nwww.csa.com) [72] covering the past 2 decades produced\nnone that used the approach in the investigation of the link\nbetween temporal factors (seasonality) and suicide. Multi-\nlevel techniques have appeared only recently in suicide\nresearch, including that by van Tubergen et al. [77], and by\nStack and Kposowa [75]. Van Tubergen et al. [77] exam-\nined completed suicides, while Stack and Kposowa [75]\nstudied suicide acceptability at the cross-national level.\nThe multi-level or mixed modeling approach recognizes\nthe fact that most individual events do not occur in a\nvacuum, but are located in time and space. Thus, just as\nindividual characteristics can have effects on the odds of\nsuicide, contextual factors can also affect individual odds.\nPast studies have reported that suicide attempters have\ngenerally had more contact with role models that have\ncommitted suicide [3]. As Stack and Kposowa [75, p. 41]\nobserve, in communities with more persons that have died\nof suicide, there could be greater interaction with individ-\nuals that have attitudes favorable to suicide. This study\nrecognizes the possibility of the complex relationship\nbetween macro structural factors and micro characteristics\nby modeling individuals as located in their states of resi-\ndence, taking into account that some of the individual risk\nfactors may be due to state differences.\nMethods\nData\nThe data used in the study were derived from the national\nUS Multiple Cause of Death Files (MCDFs) for 2000\u00ad\non the information from death certificate records of all\ndeaths occurring in the United States. The information is\nreceived on computer data tapes coded by the States and\nprovided to the National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS), through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program,\nor are coded by NCHS staff from copies of the original\ncertificates received from registration areas. NCHS\nreceives the data for the MCD Files from the registration\noffices of all States, the District of Columbia, and New\nYork City. Mortality data for the United States are limited\nto deaths occurring within the country to US residents and\nnonresidents. Deaths occurring to US citizens outside the\nUnited States are not included in the MCDF [56]. A more\ndetailed description of the MCDFs has been presented\nThe current analysis focused on suicide deaths among\nnon-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic African Americans,\nnon-Hispanic Native Americans (American Indians), non-\nHispanic Asians, and Hispanics aged 18 years and above.\nThe results presented are based on those adults 18 years\nold and above who died of suicide in their state of resi-\nDependent variable\nThe MCDF is cross-sectional, and lacks population\ndenominators. Therefore, a case\u00adcontrol design was\nemployed in this study. The response variable was the odds\nof death by suicide (the cases), as opposed to deaths from\nnatural causes (the controls). The data used do not permit a\ncomparison of victims versus non-victims (those still\nalive), so the `non-victims' in the analysis are those who\ndied of natural causes. Deaths resulting from suicide were\ndefined according to the Tenth Revision of the Interna-\ntional Classification of Diseases [ICD-10] [79], with the\nunderlying cause codes X64 to X87.0. All suicides to\npersons age 18 and above (cases) were coded 1. Persons\ndying of natural causes (after eliminating homicides and\naccidents) were coded 0 and used as controls. Like the\nsuicides, analysis was limited to individuals dying in their\ncurrent state of residence. Due to serious technical diffi-\nculties encountered (computer memory problems, conver-\ngence problems, etc.) in analyzing all deaths from natural\ncauses (nearly 10 million) a 20% simple random sample\nwas selected for each year studied. The deaths for all\n5 years were then pooled into one concatenated file. The\nresulting deaths from natural causes per year (after sam-\neffective sample size at the individual level comprised\nIndividual level variables\nDay of the week was treated as a series of dummy variables\nwith one each for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thurs-\nday, Friday, and Saturday. Sunday was treated as the ref-\nerence category for comparison. To measure season, we\ncollapsed the 12 months in the calendar year into autumn\n(September, October, and November), spring (March,\nApril, and May), and summer (comprising the months\nJune, July, and August). The reference group was winter\n(December, January, and February). Owing to the fact that\nthe data were pooled from deaths occurring in five different\nyears, period effects might be present. It is conceivable that\nany single year is atypical and that the number of suicides\nmay be affected by extraneous national and even interna-\ntional events. To control for period effects as well as\npossible trends in the data, analysis employed year of death\nas an independent variable. The variable was measured as a\nseries of dummy variables. There was one each for 2001,\ncategory for comparison purposes.\nStudies in the United States consistently show that there\nare substantial disparities in rates and risks of suicide by\nhave also been reported in South Africa, with whites\nexperiencing much higher rates than Blacks, Coloureds or\nAsians in major South African cities [9]. It has also been\nsuggested that seasonality might affect non-whites and\nwhites differently [7, 54, 74]. The present report, therefore,\ncontrolled for race/ethnicity. The variable comprised non-\nHispanic African Americans, non-Hispanic native Ameri-\ncans, non-Hispanic Asians, and Hispanics. Each of these\ngroups was coded 1, and non-Hispanic Whites were used as\nthe reference category. Marital status has figured promi-\nnently in many studies as a significant predictor of suicide\nsured by a set of dummy variables, with one each for\nsingle, widowed, separated, or divorced. Those married at\nthe time of death constituted the reference category. Per-\nsons with missing marital status information were deleted\nfrom the analysis. Age at death was captured by leaving it\nin its interval form. For sex, females were the omitted\ngroup. Both age and sex were included as demographic\ncontrol variables. The MCDF lacks many socioeconomic\nvariables. Education, the only one collected in all states\nwas used as a control variable. The covariate was left in its\nformat as highest grade completed. The data contained a\nlarge number of missing cases, so the mean value (high\nschool education) was substituted for persons with missing\ninformation. City size of residence was left in its ordinal\nformat. Inclusion of city size is important for reassessing\nfindings in some recent studies that rural areas have sig-\nnificantly higher suicide rates than urban areas [32, 63].\nState level variables\nThe main level 2 variable was the state suicide rate. Its\ninclusion was based on the reasoning that high suicides in a\nstate increase not only awareness of suicide, but attitudes\nfavorable to suicidal behavior. As Stack and Kposowa [75,\np. 41] explain, ``In a community with a high suicide rate,\nthere are proportionately more persons committing suicide\nand, hence, more cases that offer excuses for suicide.'' The\nvariable was measured as the number of suicides per\nvariable was physician supply, measured as the number of\nthe variable in this research was informed by past eco-\nlogical studies that have shown a relationship between\navailability of primary care physicians and both morbidity\nand mortality [6, 70]. The unemployment rate was mea-\nsured as the percent of the civilian labor force that was\nunemployed in 2000. Unemployment has been used\nextensively in suicide research with mixed results [27]. The\npresent study offers an opportunity to ascertain its associ-\nation with suicide in a multi-level framework. Divorce was\nmeasured as divorces per 1,000 resident population in\n2000. The variable has been generally used as an indicator\nIndex of income inequality, 2000 were used as socioeco-\nnomic controls. Higher values on Gini (which ranges from\n0 to 1) indicate higher income inequality and thus higher\nrelative deprivation. With regard to region, we divided the\nUS into West and non-Western States, with non-West used\nas reference. The rationale for this classification was based\non research in sociological science that finds Western states\nconsistently having the highest suicide rates than the rest of\nthe country [8, 36, 38]. Western states were limited to\nCalifornia, Oregon, Nevada, and Washington.\nResults\nDescriptive findings\nFigure 1 presents descriptive results on pooled suicides by\nThe highest percentage of suicides occurred on Wednesday\n(24.6%). The percentages dropped suddenly on Thursday\n14.4% on Saturday. On the whole, descriptive statistics\nshowed a single suicide peak on Wednesday and the lowest\npoint on Thursday (11.1%). Thursday and Friday were the\ndays with the fewest suicides in the 5 years of data\ncombined.\nFigure 2 shows graphic results with regard to seasons\nand suicide. As may be seen, 26% of all suicides took place\nin summer, and 25.8% occurred in spring. Autumn months\nposted 24.4% and the lowest incidence was in the winter\n(23.8%). On the whole, the descriptive results seem to\nsuggest that suicides are highest in the summer months,\nfollowed closely by months in winter.\nMultivariate findings\nThe remainder of the analysis focuses on examining the\nassociation between days and seasons and the odds of\nsuicide, taking into account the association of other vari-\nables. Table 1 presents hierarchical logistic regression\nresults showing the effects of days and season on suicide in\nare generally in agreement with the descriptive findings\nshown earlier in Figs. 1 and 2.

Indeed, the seasonal distribution appears\nmore evenly distributed among non-Whites than Whites.\nYear of death exhibited slightly divergent patterns in the\ntwo groups. For instance, year 2001 elevated suicide risk in\nwhites, but not in non-whites. Similarly, year 2003\nincreased suicide risk in non-whites, but the covariate did\nnot reach statistical significance among whites; indeed, it\nwas in the negative direction.

The first two have been unequivocally answered\nby the data analysis. Results have shown both significant\ndaily and significant seasonal variations in suicide. Sui-\ncides are more likely to occur in summer and spring and\nsignificantly less likely in fall and winter. This is consistent\nwith numerous recent studies that have reported a suicide\ndata analysis challenge some previous studies [68] that\nreported an inverse relationship between temperature and\nsuicide, because such a relationship implies that higher\nsuicide deaths occur in winter and autumn and lower deaths\ntake place in spring and summer. Results also challenge\nfindings of a recent study [27] that emphatically stated that\nsuicides peak in winter. In the present study, the highest\npeak was observed in summer.\nAs far as daily distributions are concerned, findings in\nthis study reveal that suicides are concentrated on\nWednesday. This may well be the first US study to dem-\nonstrate a Wednesday suicide peak. Past work has found\nMonday as the peak day. Given that Wednesday, not\nMonday was observed as the day with the highest suicide\noccurrence, results are at odds with Durkheim's [18]\nobservation that suicides are higher at the beginning of new\nperiods. Results reported here disconfirm research in the\nUnited States by Maldonado and Kraus [49] and in Aus-\ntralia by Hassan [24] that found most suicides occurring on\nMonday. Findings are also at odds with those noted by Page\net al. [59] for the United Kingdom that suicides took place\nmost often in winter, notably in January. Indeed, Page et al.\n[59, p. 109] expressly stated that their study did not support\nprior findings of a spring or summer peak in suicide. While\nMaldonado and Kraus [49] reported mixed results regarding\nmonths of the year (seasons), in the present study, a clear\npattern emerged, with suicides peaking in summer.\nWhile the effects of days and seasons on suicide should\nnot be interpreted as climatic or environmental determin-\nism, they do highlight periods when people are significantly\nmore likely to be victimized. Thus, at the clinical level, the\npresent research is important in the behavioral sciences\n(e.g., psychology, psychiatry, social work, counseling, and\napplied sociology). Knowledge of day or season when\nTable 2 continued\nVariables Whites Non-Whites\nb unstandardized logistic coefficient, OR odds ratio, CI confidence interval\nsuicides are more likely to happen can possibly help clini-\ncians and therapists in advising patients and potential vic-\ntims when they present themselves with depressive and\nassociated symptoms. A clinician could become more\nproactive, whether through medication or advice, thereby\nintervening to prevent death.\nIn view of the finding that most suicides tend to occur on\nWednesday compared to other days of the week, and that\nthe likelihood of death is also highest in summer, compared\nto winter, the question may be asked as to whether psy-\nchosocial problems are especially more pernicious on\nWednesday, compared to say, Weekends, or in summer,\ncompared to Winter. If psychological and certain social\nproblems are significantly more likely to be experienced on\nWednesday, then future research could try to disentangle\nwhat these problems are, with the view to partialling out\ntheir link to Wednesday.\nIt is plausible that the finding with regard to season is due\nto co-morbidity. Some past studies [47], and to some extent\npopular folklore in many cultures allude to winter months as\nlikely to have higher levels of suicide. Reasons for this are\ngenerally given in terms of winter months having less\nsunshine on average, and thus raising the stakes for condi-\ntions such as depression, anxiety, affective disorders,\ngreater suicide ideation, and thus suicidal behavior [78].\nAnother tack in this regard is that two major `family' hol-\nidays (Christmas and the New Year) take place in the winter\n(at least in the western hemisphere). Winter holidays are\nviewed as being especially stressful for persons who lack\nsocial support due to absence of significant others (family,\nfriends, spouses, and other loved ones). According to co-\nmorbidity arguments [14], the incidence of depression,\nanxiety, seasonal affective disorder, and other psychiatric\nconditions may be especially high during winter and\ntherefore, suicide risks and rates would be high. Research\nhas shown, however, that a condition such as seasonal\naffective disorder occurs during autumn and winter [14].\nThe finding here and in other studies that suicides peak in\nsummer and spring challenges any view of seasonal affec-\ntive disorder having an effect on the seasonality of suicides.\nThe argument about the concentration of many psychi-\natric and psychological disorders in winter having been\ndiscarded in the present study, could it be, for example, that\nsocial integration, as proposed by Durkheim is actually\nmuch higher in winter than in summer? After all, despite the\nless sunny weather in winter, people may spend more time\nat home, with family and friends. With increasing tech-\nnology, perhaps, they also spend more time on the tele-\nphone, computers, and other entertainment gadgets when\nthe weather gets bad. In an information age (cell phones,\nemails, and other instant means of communication), phys-\nical separation need not necessarily imply complete lack of\nsocial support or networking. Thus, the mere fact of cold\nweather (in the winter) should not be assumed as bringing a\nreduction in social ties, or as promoting depression and\nhigher suicidal behavior. Disentangling the various ideas\nraised here presents a clear research challenge in the quest\nto increase more fully our knowledge of the link between\ntemporal factors and suicide.\nFor suicide research on seasonality to advance and\nbecome more consistent, investigators may need to make\ngreater use of multi-level designs. Events which are fre-\nquently viewed as individual behavior may also be influ-\nenced by contextual factors. In the present study, state\nsuicide rates significantly affected individual's suicide\nbehavior. How to explain this finding?\nConsistent with social learning and differential associ-\nation theories of deviant behavior [1\u00ad3, 76], persons living\nin states or localities with high suicide rates may have\nhigher exposure to definitions favorable to suicide accep-\ntance, and this in turn may increase their odds of com-\nmitting suicide. Prevailing social, economic, and even\npolitical conditions in a state may further affect individ-\nual's suicidal behavior by maintaining an environment in\nwhich people's aspirations are thwarted and dreams of a\nbetter tomorrow are deferred.\nWith regard to racial/ethnic differences, Stack [74, p.\n321] reported that white suicides peak on Monday, adding\nthat there were 8.25 additional suicides on Mondays,\ncompared to Sundays, and that Saturday was the trough in\nwhite suicides. Likewise, McIntosh and Lester [54] found\nthat white and black suicides peaked on Mondays, although\nthe peak was less pronounced for Blacks. Data analysis for\nthis study failed to find support for Stack's [74] contention\nof white suicides peaking on Monday, or McIntosh and\nLester's [54] suggestion of both white and black suicides\nalso peaking on Monday. Analysis has clearly shown that\nfor white suicides, Wednesday is the peak. Although\nBlacks were not specifically studied, and they were lumped\nwith other minority groups, findings here have shown that\nnon-White suicides also peaked on Wednesday, followed\nnot by Monday, but by Saturday. In contrary to Stack's\n[74] report, the trough in white suicides in the present study\nwas not Saturday, but Friday. The trough in non-White\nsuicides was also on Friday.\nA consistent and notable finding is that divorce places a\nperson at an especially high risk of becoming a suicide\nvictim. How to interpret the divorce findings? Sociologist\nDurkheim [18] informed us a century ago that a breakdown\nin social integration through divorce is a crisis and a pro-\nfoundly stressful life event. This is now a well-documented\nobservation in mental health, health psychology, psy-\nSeparated and divorced individuals have been found to be\nover-represented in the psychiatric patient population, for\ninstance. Separated people are more likely to be involved\nin automobile accidents than non-separated people [39].\nMarital separation, as opposed to non-separation, is asso-\nciated with higher rates of illness and disability as well as\nhigh death rates due to suicide, homicide, and other causes\nof mortality [37, 67]. Findings from this study confirm\nonce again that divorce is a non-trivial risk factor for sui-\ncide at both the individual and contextual levels.\nFindings confirm that there are still significant rural\u00ad\nurban differences in suicide risk in that metropolitan areas\nexperienced lower risks than non-metropolitan areas.\nResults are consistent with those reported in recent\nCommenting on the on rural\u00adurban differentials in sui-\ncide risk, Kposowa [38] argued that completed suicides may\nbe influenced by emergency response services and the\nexistence of nearby trauma centers. Simply put, in localities\nwith rapid emergency response, timely arrival at the scene\nof a suicide event could make the difference between life\nand death. In general, emergency response services as well\nas trauma centers are more likely to be concentrated in large\nurban centers than in smaller cities or rural areas. Implicit in\nthis argument is that at some point in American history,\nurban areas might have experienced much higher suicide\nrates than rural areas, but with advances in technology,\nespecially communication and transportation centered in\nmetropolitan areas, there has been a gradual shift in suicide\noccurrence that disadvantages rural communities [17, 28].\nIn general, results showed that climatic factors should\nnot be discounted in efforts to explain suicide. In this\nregard, results support Morselli's [55] admonition that the\nregularity observed between season and suicide may be too\ngreat for it to be attributed to chance of the human will.\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the\nCreative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which per-\nmits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any\nmedium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.\nReferences\n1.
