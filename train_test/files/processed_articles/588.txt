The biopsychosocial model is the prevailing framework used for understand-\ning, managing and treating back pain. This approach suggests that in addition to biology, psy-\nchological, socio-economic, environmental and cultural factors all contribute to the incidence\nand persistence of back pain symptoms [2, 3]. Many musculoskeletal conditions start in mid-\ndle-age and require interactions with health care providers over many years [1, 4, 5]. Low back\npain, or \"back pain\", is a leading cause of activity limitation, work absenteeism and lost produc-\ntivity throughout much of the industrialized world\u00adthreatening function, mental health and\nquality of life [6\u00ad8] and inflicting substantial direct and indirect costs on health, social and eco-\nnomic systems [1].\nGlobally back pain causes more disability than any other condition. The 2010 Global Bur-\nden of Disease Study ranked low back pain as the condition with the highest number of years\nlived with disability (YLDs) and sixth in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) [8, 9].\ning countries, but by 2010 this proportion had increased to 67% [10]. With rapid growth in the\nnumbers and proportions of older adults in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) the\nback pain burden in older adults in these countries is expected to grow significantly in coming\nBack pain is also one of the most common conditions for which patients in high-income\ncountries seek medical care [12]. Most of the information about back pain has come from de-\nveloped countries in Europe, North American and Australasia, making it difficult to draw com-\nparisons with developing countries [12\u00ad15]. Italian researchers reported back pain prevalence\nyears in the United States (US) demonstrated back pain prevalence of 36%. A review of the\nprevalence of musculoskeletal conditions in adults aged 60 and over in developed countries re-\nported one-month back pain prevalence of between 18% and 29% [17].\nThe Jerusalem Longitudinal study [18] showed that chronic back pain was prevalent in the\nelderly (aged 70 years and over) and that psychosocial factors, female gender and hypertension\nLow Back Pain in Older Adults in Low- and Middle-Income Countries\ncollection and analysis, decision to publish, or\npreparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting Interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nwere associated with back pain. Association between back pain and older age is also heavily\nmodified by the severity and intensity of the complaint [19]. Studies conducted in North Amer-\nback pain is associated with individual, psychosocial and occupational factors. In addition to\nbeing older and female [1, 24, 25] modifiable determinants of back pain in developed countries\ninclude smoking, depression, lack of physical activity and abdominal obesity [12, 23, 24, 26\u00ad\n30]. A Japanese study of men aged 40 years and older demonstrated that back pain had a signif-\nicant negative impact on quality of life [31]. European studies provide evidence of inverse asso-\nciation between back pain and socioeconomic factors, such as older age, higher income and\nAlthough a few studies investigating the determinants of back pain have been conducted in\ndeveloping countries, the literature is sparse compared with developed countries. In a commu-\nnity-based study of adults in Korea (mean age 56 years) the common determinants were ad-\nvancing age and female sex [36]. Studies conducted in Taiwan [37], China [38] and Sri Lanka\n[39] have focused on working-age populations. A review of back pain prevalence studies con-\nducted in Sub-Saharan Africa on mostly working-age adults and adolescents, concluded that\nback pain prevalence was rising [25].\nThe perception and reporting of back pain is influenced by individual characteristics, work-\ning conditions, lifestyle, and social, economic, cultural and ethnic factors, as well as the avail-\nability of treatment and rehabilitation options [1, 5]. In some societies and countries there is a\ngreater awareness of the symptoms and also a greater willingness to report them, while in oth-\ners, back pain is not necessarily associated with disability, but rather seen as a natural conse-\nquence of routine physical work or the ageing process itself [1]. Given the fundamental social,\ncultural and economic differences between developed and developing countries, it is reasonable\nto argue that the antecedents and consequences of back pain are not homogeneous. For exam-\nple, extreme poverty, infectious diseases epidemics, work tasks, family structures, responsibili-\nties, social expectations, geography, health care availability and support may all impact\ndifferently on the perception and reporting of back pain in different contexts and settings.\nAs a consequence of the major epidemiological and demographic transitions occurring in\nemerging economies in all regions of the world, there is now an urgent need to gather accurate\ncomparable epidemiological data on back pain in older adult populations in developing coun-\nabling and contextual factors that require consideration at the country level [5].\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) one of the most disabling conditions\namong the elderly is musculoskeletal disorders, of which back pain is a major contributor [8,\nStudy on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) were analysed to: measure the prevalence of\nback pain; identify risk factors and determinants associated with back pain prevalence and in-\ntensity, and describe association between back pain and disability. The purpose is to gain in-\nsights into country-level differences in self-reported back pain in a group of socially, culturally,\neconomically and geographically diverse LMICs.\nMethods\nEthics Statement\nThe SAGE study was approved by the following bodies: the Ethics Review Committee, World\nHealth Organization; Ethical Committee, Ghana Medical School, Accra, Ghana; Ethics Com-\nmittee, OPM (School of Preventive and Social Medicine), Russian Academy of Medical Sci-\nences, Moscow, Russia; Ethics Committee, Shanghai Municipal Centre for Disease Control and\nLow Back Pain in Older Adults in Low- and Middle-Income Countries\nPrevention, Shanghai, China; Institutional Review Board, International Institute of Population\nSciences, Mumbai, India; Research Ethics Committee, Human Sciences Research Council, Pre-\ntoria, South Africa; and Ethics Committee, National Institute of Public Health (INSP), Cuerna-\nvaca, Mexico. This approval also covered all procedures by which written informed consent\nwas obtained from each individual participant. Confidential records of participants' consent\nwere maintained by SAGE.\nData Collection\nThe SAGE Wave 1 is a longitudinal study that provides the baseline round of data for national-\nly representative samples of adults aged 50 years and over in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, the\nRussian Federation and South Africa. Cross sectional data from SAGE Wave 1 were collected\nvia in-person structured interviews (2007\u00ad2010). All six SAGE countries implemented multi-\nstage cluster sampling strategies [44]. Household-level and person-level analysis weights, based\non the selection probability at each stage of sampling along with post stratification corrections,\nwere applied to produce nationally representative cohorts. Age and sex standardizations based\non WHO's World Standard Population [45] and the United Nations Statistical Division's pop-\nulation distributions (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/default.htm)) were carried out to adjust for\nbetween country population age and sex differences. Additional details about SAGE are provid-\nSample\nThe sample in this study included adults aged 50 years and over in the six SAGE countries.\nRussian Federation and 2,720 in South Africa.\nVariables\nDependent Variables. Three dependent variables\u00adpast-month back pain prevalence, back\npain frequency/intensity and disability--were derived from questions in the SAGE individual\nquestionnaire.\nPast-month back pain prevalence (no vs. yes) was identified from responses to the question\n\"Have you experienced back pain in the last 30 days?\"\nA score measuring the intensity and frequency of past-month back pain, was conditioned\non responses (yes) to this prevalence question (4008). Frequency was measured using re-\nsponses to question 4009 which asked \"On how many days did you have this back pain during\nthe last 30 days?\" A pain intensity measure was derived by summing responses to questions\n2007 and 2008. In these two questions respondents were asked to use a Likert scale (1 = none,\n2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe and 5 = extreme) to rate the extent of overall bodily pain\ntensity and frequency score was computed as the product of these two measures. This was\nconverted to a percentile index, with zero and 100 indicating the minimum and maximum\npossible scores. The distribution was skewed (skewness = 1.48, median 8.3, mean = 18.2 and\nstandard deviation = 21.6). Scores were grouped into three categories: low (zero score) vs. mod-\nerate (> = 50) vs. high intensity (>50). The proportion of respondents in the categories varied\nacross countries ranging from: 9% to 22% in the low group, 72% to 82% in the moderate group\nand 4% to 12% in the high group. This intensity/frequency variable was used here as the mea-\nsure of \"back pain intensity\".\nLow Back Pain in Older Adults in Low- and Middle-Income Countries\nDisability was measured using the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0)\nencompassing six domains [47, 48]. Twelve items were included in the scale asking about diffi-\nculty in functioning in the past 30 days. This included activities of daily living (such as, stand-\ning, dressing oneself) and instrumental activities of daily living (such as learning a new task,\nparticipating in community activities, household chores). Responses were measured on a Likert\nscale, ranging from no difficulty to severe difficulty or cannot perform the activity, and\nsummed to a composite score which was transformed to a scale of 0\u00ad100, with 100 indicating\nthe most severe disability [48].\nSocio-demographic variables. Data on socio-demographic characteristics collected in\nSAGE were used to describe the study sample. The variables were sex: male vs. female; age: 50\u00ad\ned vs. completed primary vs. completed secondary or high school vs. completed university or\ncollege; marital status: never married, vs. married/cohabiting vs. divorced/separated/widowed;\nwork status: never worked vs. currently working vs. not currently working; wealth quintiles: 1\n(poorest) to 5 (richest) and area of residence: urban vs. rural. A random-effects probit model\n(previously developed and reported elsewhere) was used to estimate wealth levels based on\nasset ownership [49, 50]. This was applied to every household in the SAGE surveys and used to\nestablish country-specific quintiles of household wealth made available by the WHO. The\nquintiles provide an alternative measure of income and assets that is less likely to be biased by\ncontextual differences than traditional income-based measures.\nHealth-related variables. Health-related variables are described here. Responses to ques-\ntions on the use of alcohol and tobacco were categorised as smoker: not current vs. current;\nand alcohol: never drinkers vs. former drinkers vs. current drinkers. Obesity was measured\nusing waist circumference rather than body mass index (BMI). In making this decision we con-\nsidered evidence of the importance of waist circumference as a predictor of health outcomes\n[30, 51\u00ad53] and the availability of WHO recommendations for waist circumference in men\nand women separately [54]. The waist circumference variable (low risk vs. high risk) was de-\nrived using WHO recommended cut-offs of > = 102 centimetres for men and > = 88 centi-\nmetres for women.\nPhysical activity was measured using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ)\n[55, 56] which collects information on sedentary behaviour and physical activity participation\nin work, travel, and recreation. A categorical variable measuring low vs. moderate vs. high\nphysical activity was included. High physical activity was defined as vigorous-intensity activity\n(such as running which increases the heart rate and breathing) on at least three days per week,\nor seven or more days per week of any combination of walking, moderate or vigorous intensity\nactivities. Moderate physical activity was defined as (per week) three or more days of vigorous-\nintensity activity, or five or more days of moderate-intensity activity (such as walking or\ncycling resulting in a small but noticeable increase in the heart rate and breathing) of at least\n30 minutes per day, or five or more days of any combination of walking, moderate or vigorous\nintensity activities. Low physical activity was defined as not meeting any of these criteria.\nIndicator variables (no vs. yes) for symptom-based arthritis, depression, asthma [57, 58]\nand self-reported diabetes mellitus are included. Symptom-based conditions were derived\nusing validated WHO algorithms. A \"chronic count\" variable (zero vs. one vs. two or more\nchronic conditions) was included.\nStatistical analyses\nData presented here are weighted and include post stratification adjustments in national coun-\ntry samples and in the pooled multi-country data set [45].\nLow Back Pain in Older Adults in Low- and Middle-Income Countries\nWe undertook a complete case analysis. Data were missing for: education (2.2%); marital\ndiabetes (1.8%) and the count of chronic conditions (1.7%).\nDescriptive statistics for socio-demographic variables are presented as proportions for each\ncountry and pooled. The prevalence of back pain and back pain intensity (conditioned on prev-\nalence) is shown by countries and pooled, and also by socio-demographic and health-related\ncharacteristics in the pooled sample.\nThree sets of multivariable regression were undertaken using the pooled multi-country data\nset. Multivariable logistic regression describes association between socio-demographic and\nhealth-related determinants and back pain prevalence. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression\ndescribes association between socio-demographic and health-related determinants and back\npain intensity (low vs. moderate vs. high). Multivariable linear regression describes association\nbetween back pain intensity (independent variable) and disability (dependent variable) adjust-\ning for confounding by socio-demographic and health-related factors. A country variable (ref-\nerence China) was included in all multivariable regressions.\nThe literature includes a substantial number of factors associated with back pain and dis-\nability. In aiming to achieve relatively parsimonious models, we focused on recurrent, com-\nmonly cited factors, identifiable in the SAGE data. These factors were tested in bivariate\nanalyses, and where statistically significant (p<0.05), were included as covariates in the\nmultivariable regressions.\nOdds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are reported. Variables were tested for correlation\nand multicollinearity. Diagnostic checks were undertaken on models and no violations of as-\nsumptions were found. STATA Version 11 (StataCorp, 2009) was used for all statistical\nanalyses.\nResults\ndividual observations in the six SAGE countries pooled. In order to measure back pain intensi-\nty, the analysis was conditioned on back pain prevalence, giving a sub-sample of 8,815.\nTable 1 compares socio-demographic characteristics of the study sample by countries and\npooled (n = 30,146). There were more females in the study population except in Ghana and\nIndia. In most countries, almost half of the study respondents were aged between 50\u00ad59 years.\nIn contrast to Ghana and India, where over 60% of the respondents reported no primary edu-\ncation, almost 18% of respondents in the Russian Federation reported that they had completed\nuniversity or college education. The majority of the respondents were married or cohabiting at\nthe time of the survey. Almost 40% of the respondents were separated, divorced or widowed in\nGhana and the Russian Federation. Over 56% reported that they were currently working in\nthe Russian Federation compared with 23% in Mexico. About 72% of respondents in India\nlived in rural areas, compared with only 22% and 30% in Mexico and the Russian Federation\nrespectively.\nTable 2 presents past-month prevalence (n = 30,146) and back pain intensity conditioned\non prevalence (n = 8,815) for respondents 50 years and older in the six SAGE countries.

Amongst respondents with two or more chronic conditions, the prevalence of back\npain was 59%. There are prevalence gradients for wealth, education and age, with higher wealth\nand higher education associated with lower prevalence, and older age associated with\nhigher prevalence.\nIn Table 3, the proportion of respondents with low intensity (n = 1,311) vs. moderate inten-\nsity (n = 6,804) vs. high intensity (n = 700) back pain in the pooled sample is shown by socio-\ndemographic and health characteristics. There were more females than males were in the high\nintensity group (9% vs. 6%). About 10 to 13% of respondents who did not complete primary\neducation, were separated, divorced or widowed, not working, operated at low levels of physical\nactivity, and had diabetes, were in the high intensity group. Over 20% of respondents with de-\npression, 18% with asthma, and 17% with two or more chronic conditions were in the high in-\ntensity group. An age gradient is evident for the high intensity group; 21% of respondents aged\n80 and over had high intensity back pain compared with 5% of respondents aged 50 to\nTables 4, 5 and 6 present the results of the adjusted multivariable regressions. Reference cat-\negories for the education, employment, wealth status and physical activity variables were\nchanged from those shown in Tables 1 and 3 in order to show odds as risk.\nIn Table 4, female sex, rural residence, being married or separated/divorced/widowed com-\npared with never being married, being a current smoker, and drinking alcohol, were statistically\nsignificantly in association with back pain. There is a gradient in the association between edu-\ncation level and back pain. Respondents who had not completed even primary education had\nalmost two-fold higher odds of reporting back pain compared with those who completed uni-\nversity/college. The odds of back pain were 40% higher for respondents in the lowest (poorest\nsocioeconomic quintile) compared with respondents in the highest quintile (as the reference\ngroup). The odds of back pain increased with the number of chronic comorbidities, (i.e. from\n2.7 times for those with one condition, to 4.8 times for those with two or more comorbidities).\nThere was no statistically significant association between back pain and age, physical activity\nlevel, waist circumference and employment status. Country odds ratios, with China as the ref-\nerence, were statistically significant. Adults in the Russian Federation, for example, had four-\nfold higher odds of reporting back pain compared with adults in China.\nIn Table 5, the ordinal logistic regression presents the odds of reporting high intensity back\npain vs. low intensity back pain and high intensity back vs. moderate intensity back pain for\nTable 2.

Older age, female sex, living in a rural area, not completing primary edu-\ncation, not currently working, being a current smoker, and having multiple chronic conditions,\nwere statistically significant in association with higher back pain intensity. A clear gradient is\nseen across age, with individuals aged 80 and over having three times higher odds of high back\npain intensity compared with those aged 50 to 59 years. Unlike the results in Table 4, marital\nstatus and wealth were not statistically significant in association with high back pain intensity.\nIn Table 6, the multivariable linear regression shows association between levels of back pain\nintensity and the continuous WHO disability score. The reference group comprises respon-\ndents with no back pain, according to self-reported past-month back pain prevalence. Com-\npared with the non-prevalent reference group, people in the high intensity group had, on\naverage, a 19-unit worse disability score, and people in the lowest intensity group had less dis-\nability, when all other variables were held constant. The disability score for respondents in the\nmoderate disability group was, on average, five units higher than the score for those without re-\nported back pain after adjusting for all other variables.\nThe sample size (N = 29,996) is due to missing data (n = 150) on the intensity score for re-\nspondents who were included in prevalence estimates.\nDisability was also associated with socioeconomic factors and comorbidities when back\npain intensity was held constant. There are inverse associations between education, wealth and\ndisability and there was positive association between disability and comorbid chronic condi-\ntions. There was higher disability amongst the oldest age group and rural residents. People\nwith higher physical activity had less disability compared with those with low physical activity,\nand those who never worked had higher disability compared to those who were working.\nTable 3.

These findings are a start but not sufficient.\nThey serve as a reference point for clinicians, public health practitioners and researchers plan-\nning future qualitative and quantitative studies that can inform development of country-specif-\nic medical education and practice guidelines.\nIn recent years, there has been increasing recognition of the growing burden of musculo-\nskeletal disease and back pain in both developed and developing countries [5, 8, 9, 11, 43]. A\nlarge multi-country study of chronic pain conditions [42] showed that the age standardized\nprevalence of chronic pain conditions in the previous twelve months was 37.3% in developed\ncompared with 41.1% in developing countries, with back pain more common in developing\ncountries.\nAcross the six SAGE countries, past-month back pain prevalence was almost 30%. These re-\nsults are within range of prevalence estimates reported in some other studies. Estimates of one-\nmonth back pain prevalence for adults aged 60 and over in developing countries range between\n18% and 29% (13). In our study prevalence estimates varied across the SAGE countries, from\n22% in China to 56% in the Russian Federation. The estimates for the two African countries,\nGhana and South Africa, were 41% and 39% respectively. A review of back pain prevalence\nstudies in adults aged 20 to 85 years in the African continent reported one-year back pain prev-\nalence between 40% and 72% [25]. The high back pain prevalence seen here in the Russian Fed-\neration is consistent with a previous analysis of World Health Survey data in which the\nprevalence was 76.8% in the major metropolitan areas of Moscow and St Petersburg [59].\nIn addition to pharmacological interventions, treatment and management modalities for\nback pain include behaviour and exercise therapy and lifestyle change, many of which are rela-\ntively low-cost to implement in primary care settings [60]. However, most of what is known\nand demonstrated comes from developed countries. Context-specific trials and evaluations in\ndeveloping countries are needed.\nIn agreement with other studies [15, 16, 61] this study shows that back pain increases with\nage although not necessarily for the very old, and that female sex is significantly associated\nwith back pain [16, 18, 24]. The reasons for this are not clear, although it is suggested that this\nmay be due to greater sensitization to pain, the reporting of pain, and differences in response to\nanalgesics in females [42, 62, 63]. Even though the mechanisms that lead to gender differences\nin pain are yet to be elucidated, in their literature review, Bartley and Fillingim [63] suggested\nthat multiple bio-psychosocial mechanisms (e.g. genetic, sex hormones, pain coping, gender\nroles) may interact and contribute to the phenomenon.\nOther studies have also reported inverse socioeconomic gradients between the prevalence\nand intensity of back pain and education and wealth [14, 32, 35]. Our study also found that\npeople living in rural areas were more likely to experience back pain and at higher intensity.\nThis may have also been due to more frequent and strenuous outdoor household activities (e.g.\ncarrying water or food), undertaken by older people living in rural areas in these six countries\n[14, 36, 37]. The occupational variable in SAGE that identified physical labour however had\nconsiderable missing data, and for that reason, was not included here. Instead, we used a mea-\nsure of working status for which the data were over 98% complete. However, a simple cross\nLow Back Pain in Older Adults in Low- and Middle-Income Countries\nTable 5.

The precision of these estimates is influenced by missing\ndata in the waist circumference variable.\nIn this study of the six SAGE countries there was a higher prevalence of back pain amongst\nthose with high levels of physical activity and the odds of reporting back pain were slightly\nhigher for those who had high, compared with moderate or low levels of physical activity.\nHowever, these results were not statistically significant and the association between back pain\nand physical activity can occur in both directions. For example Kim et al. [64] found that vigor-\nous and moderate physical activity in older Koreans was associated with an increased risk of\nback pain in both men and women, whereas strength exercises were associated with a reduced\nrisk of back pain.\nIn the pooled analysis of adults aged 50-plus in the SAGE countries, about 8% of those with\nback pain experienced it at high intensity, although at the country level this ranged from 4% in\nChina to 12% in India. Respondents who experienced high intensity back pain had consider-\nably greater disability, compared with those with low intensity or no back pain. Musculoskele-\ntal disorders are a frequent cause of disability in older populations [40] and these findings\nreflect the major disabling effect of back pain on daily function and activities. In the multivari-\nable disability model, the effect of female sex was not evident as in the other models, but there\nwas a clear age gradient, with older age significantly associated with greater disability. These re-\nsults are generally consistent with other studies. In a study of Korean adults with a mean age of\n40 years, Kim et al. [64] found that the degree of disability from back pain assessed was influ-\nenced by a pain severity and type. In the US Weiner et al. [65] showed that, in a large cohort of\nwell-functioning adults aged 70\u00ad79 years, back pain frequency/intensity was associated with\nperceived difficulty in performing important physical functional tasks. These authors suggested\nthat the dose-response relationship between back pain frequency/intensity and self-reported\nfunctional task difficulties underscores the importance of efforts to treat and reduce pain with-\nout necessarily eradicating it [65].\nThe WHO measure of disability [48] takes into account variations in the reporting of dis-\nability across cultures [66]. There is increasing evidence of the effectiveness of low-cost easily\nimplemented therapeutic interventions, such as physical exercise, in improving rehabilitation\noutcomes for people with back pain as well as the quality of life for people with disabilities [67]\nin higher income countries. The finding of strong association between back pain and disability\nin the SAGE countries has important public health policy implications for LMICs. One of the\nreasons for this is that the data were population-based being captured in households, rather\nthan in clinical settings or the workplace. This suggests the need for investment in community-\nbased primary care assessment and education.\nLimitations\nThe cross sectional nature of the study presents limitations in terms of interpreting causal asso-\nciation. We cannot separate antecedent factors that influence incident cases from consequent\nfactors associated with prevalent cases. Some determinants may also be consequences, e.g.\nsmoking and drinking, and there may also be selection effects, e.g. those with back pain are\nunable to undertake physical activity at high levels but physical activity may also be a causal\nfactor. Data from future waves of SAGE will provide information about the direction of\nassociations.\nLow Back Pain in Older Adults in Low- and Middle-Income Countries\nTable 6.

The GPAQ only captures work and recreational activities and does not include indoor\nand outdoor household activity, which can be significant in developing countries, particularly\nin rural areas.\nThe WHODAS 2.0 disability score captures respondents that have difficulties in performing\neveryday tasks that may not be attributable to back pain. Nevertheless, the WHODAS 2.0 was\nthe most appropriate measure of disability for this study.\nWe developed an index for back pain intensity and frequency using questions that referred\nto pain in general, rather than back pain specifically. While it is true that the pain that the indi-\nvidual reports could have been due to a number of conditions, we assume that back pain was\none of these. Therefore if back pain was experienced in the previous 30 days, we assume that it\nwould have contributed to the responses to the questions about general pain that were used to\ndevelop the intensity/frequency index.\nA large proportion of the data in the SAGE were self-reported, and could be influenced by\nthe reporting heterogeneity by the respondents, either due to their experiences or expectations.\nSalomon et al. [68] suggested the use of anchoring vignettes based on fixed levels of health on\ndifferent dimensions such as mobility, pain, cognition, to adjust for this. However Hirve et al.\n[69] analysed eight health and demographic surveillance sites within the WHO-INDEPTH\nNetwork and found that the use of vignettes to adjust for reporting heterogeneity could not be\njustified because vignette equivalence and response consistency requirements were\nnot fulfilled.\nBecause there was a relatively low percentage of missing data, we decided against using mul-\ntiple imputation methods. We acknowledge the possibility of bias due to missing data.\nStrengths\nMeasures of back pain prevalence are typically based on self-report. Estimates vary widely\nacross populations and settings owing to methodological, definitional and socio-cultural differ-\nences [11, 12, 36]. Socio-cultural and psychosocial factors influence the reporting of pain, as\nwell as knowledge and perception of ways of dealing with the impact of pain on everyday func-\ntioning [1, 41]. The SAGE adjusted for cultural differences as far as possible by using standard-\nized culturally appropriate instruments.\nThis is the first study of its kind to use nationally representative standardized population\nsurvey data to present detailed contextual analyses of back pain and disability in older adults in\nLMICs. The questionnaire was first translated into the local language, and then back translated.\nAll translations were validated before data collection commenced. The interviews were\nTable 6.

Amongst those who experienced back pain, a relatively high propor-\ntion of respondents in India reported high intensity back pain, while a high proportion re-\nported low intensity back pain in Mexico, and a high proportion reported moderate intensity\nback pain in South Africa. Ghana and India had greater disability compared with China. Al-\nthough the SAGE questionnaires are designed to accommodate cultural differences, there may\nbe other reasons for the between-country differences. This is certainly an area for further\nresearch.\nConclusions\nOur study highlights the need to further gather data and investigate back pain determinants in\nolder adults within country settings [5]. We do not yet fully understand the impact of sociocul-\ntural factors on the perception and reporting of back pain in developing countries [29]. Our\nfindings are a start but certainly not sufficient. What is needed is context-specific data that can\ninform the design, development, trialling and economic evaluation of interventions for the di-\nagnosis, management, treatment and rehabilitation of back pain in older adults in developing\ncountries.\n"
