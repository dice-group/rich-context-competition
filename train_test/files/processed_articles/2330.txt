Anecdotal reports and studies of select populations suggest that\nthe use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has increased since their\nPPIs are used to treat gastrointestinal conditions such as gastro-\nesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease (PUD)\nor in patients who may be at high risk for these diseases (e.g.\npatients on non-steroidal anti-inflammatories [NSAIDs] and anti-\nplatelet therapy). Although PPIs are generally believed to be safe\nmedications, recent studies indicate that there may be harms\nassociated with their use such as pneumonia and fracture [16\u00ad25].\nOveruse of PPIs may put patients at unnecessary risk for these\nharms and may also contribute to rising health care costs.\nOne study has documented increased PPI use in the U.S.\noutpatient setting but to our knowledge, no studies have examined\nvery recent national trends in PPI use in the U.S. outpatient\nsetting, the characteristics of patients on PPIs, the characteristics of\nphysicians who prescribe PPIs, and trends in indications for their\nuse [13]. Knowledge of these trends and characteristics may\ninform patients, physicians, payers, and policymakers who want to\nreceive or deliver high quality, high value care.\nWe used data from two national surveys of visits to ambulatory\nphysicians to describe recent trends in the use of PPIs in the\nambulatory setting. We explored potential reasons for these trends\nby looking at changes in the prevalence of newly prescribed PPIs,\nchanges in histamine blocker (H2\n-blocker) use, and changes in the\nprevalence of indications for their use.\nMethods\nSource of Data\nWe used data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care\nSurvey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical\nand NHAMCS are annual surveys conducted by the Center for\nDisease Control's (CDC's) National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS) on a nationally representative sample of visits to\nphysicians in office-based practices and hospital outpatient\nThe NAMCS and NHAMCS use a three-stage sampling design.\nThe first stage is based on geographic location, the second stage\nidentifies offices in each geographic location, and the third stage\nsamples visits within each office. The visits sampled take place\nduring a one week period that is randomly assigned for each\npractice. Between 20% and 100% of the visits that week are\nsampled depending on the size of the practice. The NCHS weighs\neach visit so that the data can be used for national estimates. Each\nvisit weight accounts for selection probability, adjusts for non-\nresponse, and accounts for other factors so that the national\nestimates properly reflect the scope of ambulatory visits in the U.S.\nPhysicians in the fields of anesthesiology, radiology, and pathology\nare excluded from the survey. Physicians who participate in the\nsurvey cannot participate again for at least three years. There has\nbeen no change in the sampling design for our study period.\nThe surveys collect physician and office demographics, patient\ndemographics, and visit-specific clinical information. For each\nvisit, the surveys record up to three diagnoses based on the\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification\n(ICD-9 CM) and up to three reasons for visits which are based on\nthe patient's complaints or symptoms. The surveys also record up\nto eight medications that the patient is currently taking or that are\nprescribed at the visit. The survey specifically asks for both\nprescribed and over-the-counter medications. The information\nfrom each visit is recorded on a standardized survey form by the\nphysician, office staff, or a U.S. Census Bureau representative.\nEach visit is weighted so that national estimates can be calculated.\nThe study was approved by the institutional review board of Weill\nCornell Medical College.\nStudy Design and Sample\nWe performed a trend analysis using NAMCS and NHAMCS\nfrom 2009. We included all visits by patients 18 years and older\nwho saw a physician.\nVariables\nOur main outcome variable was PPI use calculated both as the\nnumber and percent of visits in which a PPI was prescribed,\nordered, supplied, administered, or continued. PPIs included\nomeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and esome-\nprazole (Table 1) [28]. We excluded dexlansoprazole because it\nwas introduced in 2009 and was used in very few visits in that year.\nTo understand whether changes in use could have been due to\nmore new PPI prescriptions, decreased H2\n-blocker use, or more\ndocumented indications for PPIs, we also looked at new PPI\nprescription and overall H2\n-blocker use and documented indica-\ntions (see below). H2\n-blockers included ranitidine, cimetidine, and\nage, patient gender, patient race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic,\nother), number of chronic medical conditions (0, 1\u00ad3, .3),\nprimary payer (private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, other),\nphysician specialty category (primary care, medical specialist,\nsurgical specialist), and practice type (private practice, community\nhealth center, health maintenance organization, hospital outpa-\ntient department, other).\nWe defined an indication for PPI use as a visit in which a\ngastrointestinal diagnosis (GERD, gastrointestinal ulcer, gastroin-\ntestinal bleed, esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal varices,\ndyspepsia, gastritis, Helicobacter Pylori infection, malignant\nneoplasm of the esophagus or stomach, hepatitis, or liver disease)\nwas documented, the patient reported a gastrointestinal complaint\nor a potential symptom that may be caused by a gastrointestinal\ndiagnosis (gastrointestinal bleeding, heartburn, abdominal pain,\nchest pain, or cough), or documentation of a medication where\nprophylaxis might be necessary (NSAIDs, anti-platelet therapies,\nAnalysis\nWe performed a visit-level analysis using visit sampling weights\nto account for clustering at the physician and practice level and to\ngenerate national estimates of counts and percentages. We used\nthe Pearson chi-squared test to compare patient and physician\nlinear regression to test for linear trends in PPI use (overall and for\nTable 1.

We also estimated the prevalence of visits in which PPIs\nwere used by patients without gastrointestinal diagnoses, com-\nplaints, or concomitant high-risk medication use. We used\nmultivariable logistic regression to test for associations between\nthe patient and physician characteristics described above and PPI\nuse in patients with no documented indication. All tests were two-\nsided with a p-value of 0.05 considered significant.\nResults\nThere were approximately 772 million ambulatory visits by\nadults patients in 2002.

In multivariable analyses, we found no\ncorrelation between any physician or practice characteristics and\nPPI use without a documented indication (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nIn this study of PPI use in the ambulatory setting, we found\nalmost a three-fold increase in their use in recent years. In 2009,\nPPI use was documented in almost a tenth of ambulatory visits\n(over 80 million visits) compared with close to 4 percent of visits in\nWe explored three potential reasons for increased use of PPIs:\ncontinuation of previously prescribed PPIs, a shift to use PPIs\nrather than other acid reducers such as H2\n-blockers, and more\nreasons for their use because of gastrointestinal diagnoses, patient\nsymptoms, and medications.\nOur finding of little change in new prescriptions for PPIs\nsuggests that patients stay on PPIs chronically, that they may be\nstarted in settings other than the outpatient setting (e.g. hospital,\nnursing home), or that self-prescribe over-the-counter PPIs. The\nsecond explanation is not supported by our findings: H2\n-blocker\nuse did not decrease over the study period and, in fact, increased\nover our study period. The third explanation, increased docu-\nmented indications, may also contribute to increased PPI use over\nthe study period.\nNevertheless, in all study years, we found that the majority of\nvisits with documented PPI use had no documented indication for\ntheir use. These findings raise the question of whether PPI use\nsince 2002 reflects overuse rather than appropriate use. Potential\nreasons for overuse include PPI continuation after a short term\nindication (e.g. hospitalization), a belief that PPIs offer benefit with\nlittle harm, and aggressive marketing to patients and physicians.\nInterestingly, the two individual PPIs with the most significant\nincrease in their use were omeprazole and esomeprazole. Both of\nthese medications are made by the same manufacturer (Astra\nZeneca) and their increased use may reflect effective marketing -\nboth medications have been marketed as ``purple pills'' in multiple\nmedia setting [30]. However, this may be mere coincidence\nparticularly because esomeprazole is not the most frequently\nprescribed PPI. Increased omeprazole use may also be the result of\nincreased availability as an over-the-counter medication, its long\ntime on the market, and its availability in generic formulations\nOur findings are in concert with reports that PPI use is\nincreasing worldwide. Reports from Taiwan, the United King-\ndom, and Australia have all documented increased use [10,14,15].\nFor example, in Australia, researchers found a greater than one\nUnited Kingdom researchers have documented that a majority of\nPPIs are prescribed inappropriately [14].\nUnfortunately, recent work has elucidated potential harms of\nPPIs including pneumonia, fracture, enteric infection, and\nmalabsorption [16\u00ad25]. One study found a 1.6 fold increased risk\nof community acquired pneumonia in patients on PPIs [22].\nAnother found a 1.3 fold increased odds of hospital-acquired\npneumonia in patients on PPIs [19]. Analyses of data from the\nUnited Kingdom showed a 1.5 fold increased risk of hip fracture\nwith long-term PPI use [24].\nFurther, literature also suggests that the benefits of PPIs may be\noverstated particularly for prophylaxis in hospitalized patients\n[25]. In fact, a recent literature review found no significant\ndifference in stress ulcer prevalence in hospitalized patients who\nreceived H2\n-blockers and PPIs [21]. If, in fact, such a high\npercentage of patients are on PPIs for no reason, we may be\nputting patients at undue risk.\nOur study is limited primarily by the data available through the\nNAMCS and NHAMCS. First, our evaluation is at the visit level,\nnot at the patient level so the percentages we report of percent of\nvisits, not percent of patients. It is possible that there is not a direct\ncorrelation between the number of patients on PPIs and their use\ndocumented at the visit level or it is possible that patients on PPIs\nhave more visits than patients not on PPIs. We did, however, look\nat trends across years and documented medication use, diagnoses,\nand symptoms at the visit level for multiple years. Second, our data\nare limited to what is documented from the patient record.\nTable 3. Characteristics of visits by patients on PPIs, 2008\u00ad\nNo PPI, % On PPI, % p-value\nRace/Ethnicity\nPractice Type\naWeighted percentages based on the sample that was surveyed.\nProton Pump Inhibitor Use\nAlthough the surveys do ask for over-the-counter medications, it is\npossible that PPIs that are available over-the-counter may not be\ndocumented in the patient record. Conversely, we may be\noverestimating potentially inappropriately used PPIs because not\nall symptoms, diagnoses, and medications are documented in\nNAMCS and NHAMCS. We also do not know whether PPIs were\nprescribed on an as needed basis (prn) or the duration of therapy.\nLastly, it is possible that patients remain on PPIs long-term\nbecause of rebound symptoms when they are removed from PPIs\nIn summary, we found a large and significant increase in PPI\nuse in the U.S. outpatient setting since 2002 but no increase in PPI\nuse without a documented indication or in new PPI prescriptions.\nNevertheless, the majority of patients on PPIs in all years had no\ndocumented indication. Our findings confirm what has been\ndocumented in smaller settings, older studies and international\nsettings. Our findings suggest that inappropriate PPI use is not\nnecessarily increasing but is still an important public health\nproblem.\nWhile growing evidence points out important adverse associa-\ntions with PPIs, they do remain effective drugs for their specified\nindications. More research is needed to fully understand the scope\nof overuse of PPIs in the ambulatory setting. These methods\ninclude more granular reviews of their use in the ambulatory\nsetting or studies to understand why physicians prescribe and\npatients use PPIs when the indications are not clear. Further\nresearch should also address methods to change physician and\npatient decisions regarding their use. Interventions such as\neducation, treatment guidelines, and decision support systems\nmay address this problem. Ultimately, however, physicians,\npayers, policymakers, and even patients should be tasked with\nevaluating the need for PPI therapy, especially for long-term use.\n"
