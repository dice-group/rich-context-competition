    "abstract": "Abstract: We conducted three studies to (1) investigate individuals' beliefs about change\nin mating desires over the course of emerging adulthood and (2) determine whether those\nbeliefs reflect actual variation in mating desires among emerging adults of varied ages (late\nteens through twenties). In Study 1, 103 men and women gave their thoughts on how\ncollege students change, if at all, in what they most desire in a relationship and relationship\npartner as they move from being incoming freshmen to graduating seniors. In Studies 2 and\n3, using a college sample and then an internet sample (ns = 288 and 307), men and women\nbetween the ages of 18 and 26 completed mating strategies inventories and allotted a\nlimited number of \"mate dollars\" to 10 mate characteristics. Findings suggest that although\nemerging adults believe that their peers' mating desires change systematically over time,\nemerging adults' self-reported mating desires vary little with age.\n",

Several key findings can be extracted from this research. First, men and women\nplace similar value on kindness, love, intelligence, and emotional stability in a long-term\nmate (Buss, 1989). Second, despite their similarities, men and women differ in the extent to\nwhich they value certain characteristics in a long-term mate: On average, men value\nphysical attractiveness more than women do, and women value the potential for financial\nBeliefs versus reality\nsuccess more than men do (Buss, 1989; Buss, Shackelford, Kirkpatrick, and Larsen, 2001;\nKenrick, Sadalla, Groth, and Trost, 1990; Shackelford, Schmitt, and Buss, 2005). Third,\nmen display a higher mean level of sexual unrestrictedness than do women: Men\nconsistently report more favorable attitudes toward casual sex and devote more effort\ntoward short-term sexual relationships than women do (Simpson and Gangestad, 1991;\nSex differences in attitudes toward casual sex and desire for sexual variety have\nbeen documented with a variety of research methods (Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Clark and\nal., 2003). Similarities and differences between men's and women's mate preferences also\nhave been corroborated with both non-experimental and experimental research designs\n(Baize and Schroeder, 1995; Kenrick, Neuberg, Zierk, and Krones, 1994; Li, Bailey,\nKenrick, and Linsenmeier, 2002; Pawlowski and Koziel, 2002; Sprecher, Sullivan, and\nHatfield, 1994), and have been documented across cultures (Baize and Schroeder, 1995;\nChange over time in mating desires\nAlthough past research has documented these prominent similarities and differences\nin men's and women's mating desires and mate preferences, one area of mating research\nthat relationship scientists currently know very little about is change over time in\nindividuals' mating strategies and preferences. A two-month test-retest reliability of .94 for\nshort-term mating orientation (Simpson and Gangestad, 1989), as assessed by the\nSociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI; Simpson and Gangestad, 1991), suggests intra-\nindividual stability in attitudes toward casual sex, at least over relatively short periods of\ntime. However, no research has investigated stability and change in people's mating\nstrategies over a longer period of time.\nTo date, only one study has investigated stability and change over time in mate\npreferences. Shackelford, Schmitt, and Buss (2005) assessed individuals' mate preferences\nin the first year of marriage and again in the fourth year of marriage. Shackelford et al\n(2005) found little change beyond an increased emphasis on a mate's level of agreeableness\nand emotional stability. There are at least two possible explanations for this lack of change.\nFirst, individuals' mate preferences and desires are likely tied to their other enduring\nindividual differences--such as personality traits, physical appearance, and self-perceived\ndesirability--and thus might show the same degree of stability as do those characteristics\n(McCrae and Costa, 1994). Second, the initial sample in Shackelford et al.'s (2005) study\nof mate preferences consisted of married individuals and the follow-up sample consisted of\na subset of those who were still married. Perhaps change in mate preferences occurs prior\nto marriage, during emerging adulthood (primarily the years of 18 to 25) when individuals\nare most likely to be exploring different sexual and romantic partners and identities (Arnett,\n2000). Although 94% of emerging adults hope to get married someday (Krane and\nand 25.9 for women (U.S. Census Bureau, 2006); other industrialized countries report\nsimilar median ages. If emerging adulthood is a time of role exploration in life and love,\none might expect that individuals in their later 20s--who have experienced assorted\nBeliefs versus reality\nrelationships and partners and who are more likely to be preparing for marriage--might\nhave desires that differ from those of individuals who are a decade younger (e.g., 18-19).\nThe current research\nIn summary, little is known about change over time in men's and women's mating\ndesires and mate preferences. The current studies were designed to begin to fill that gap. In\nStudy 1, emerging adults currently in college reported their beliefs on how people's\nrelationship desires and partner preferences change over the course of college (typically 18\nto 23 years of age). To determine whether those beliefs mirror reality, in Studies 2 and 3\ndistinct samples of emerging adults of varying ages reported their own relationship desires\nand romantic partner preferences.\nMethod\nParticipants\n(Male M = 20.70, Female M = 19.90). All participants were traditional college students\nfrom a public university in the United States. Twenty of the men and 29 of the women were\nadvanced psychology majors who volunteered to complete a brief survey online. Twenty of\nthe men and 34 of the women were freshmen and sophomores who participated as part of a\nbrief activity in an introductory English composition class.\nInstruments and Procedure\nParticipants responded to two questions: (1) \"How, if at all, do you think young\nmen's and young women's romantic relationship desires (that is, what they want out of a\nromantic relationship) change as they develop from incoming college freshmen to\ngraduating seniors?\" and (2) \"How, if at all, do you think young men's and young women's\npartner preferences (that is, what they want in a romantic partner) change as they develop\nfrom incoming college freshmen to graduating seniors?\" Participants provided open-ended\nresponses either through SurveyMonkey or on paper. They then reported their age and sex.\nResults and Discussion\nCoding\nParticipants' responses to the two questions were largely redundant. Thus, each\nperson's responses were combined to make one longer response that was then coded\nindependently by the first author and one research assistant. Four prominent themes\nemerged in the responses; these and exemplary statements from the participants are\ndisplayed in Table 1. First, responses were coded for whether or not they mentioned an\nincreased long-term mating strategy with age, such as a move toward looking for a life\npartner or marriage partner. Second, responses were coded for whether or not they\nmentioned a decreased short-term mating strategy, such as a move toward serious\nrelationships rather than one-night stands. Third, responses were coded for whether or not\nthey mentioned an increased emphasis on personality, such as a move toward looking at\nBeliefs versus reality\ninternal characteristics and intellectual or spiritual stimulation. Finally, responses were\ncoded for whether or not they mentioned a decreased emphasis on physical attractiveness,\nsuch as a move toward caring about internal rather than external beauty. Interrater\nagreement for coding decisions was 96%, with disagreements resolved by discussion. All\ninferential tests reported below were two-tailed, with alpha set at .05.\nTable 1. Beliefs about change in college students' relationship desires and romantic partner\npreferences\n_\nBelief Sample Responses\n_\nIncreased Long-Term Mindset I think that as freshmen most people want just a\nrelationship, and by the time they are seniors they are\nstarting to look for someone who could be their \"life\npartner.\" (Female, age 19)\nWell as a freshman I would say most relationships are all\nabout physical attractions, but then as freshmen turn into\nseniors they are looking more for a companion that they\none day may marry. (Male, age 18)\nDecreased Short-Term Mindset I think as a freshman, most desires are for the here and\nnow. I've noticed that most seniors are looking for more\nthan sexual gratification like a younger student. I think\nthey want more emotions and intimacy than one night\nstands. (Female, age 22)\nI believe partners are more focused into long-term\nrelationships as seniors rather than instant\ngratification of freshmen. (Male, age 19)\nIncreased Emphasis on Personality Freshmen are more interested in looks. Seniors will look at\nphysical attractiveness but they also take into account\npersonality, responsibility, work ethic, and other traits.\nI think graduating seniors look for intellectual qualities\nrather than appearance qualities. (Male, age 22)\nDecreased Emphasis on Appearance They become more selective and find more refined\ncharacteristics (intelligence, similar interests, humor, etc.)\npreferable over more crude or lustful characteristics (sex\nappeal). (Female, age 22)\nAs a freshman, we are looking for the \"hottest\" person to\n\"hook up\" with and as seniors, I think that goes out the\nwindow and internal beauty becomes so much more\nattractive. (Male, age 19)\n_\nBeliefs versus reality\nBeliefs about change\nThe majority of respondents (85, or 83%) mentioned a move toward more long-\nlasting, committed relationship desires. Of those, 29 (34%) also explicitly mentioned a\nmove away from flings and sex-only relationships. No participant mentioned the latter\nwithout also mentioning the former. Chi square analyses showed no significant sex\ndifference in likelihood of mentioning an increase in long-term relationship desires (83% of\nwomen to mention a decrease in pursuit of short-term sexual relationships (38% of men,\nOver half (55, or 53%) of respondents mentioned an increased emphasis on\npersonality traits. Of those, 32 (58%) also explicitly mentioned less emphasis on physical\nattractiveness with increasing age. No participant mentioned the latter without also\nmentioning the former. Chi square analyses showed no significant sex difference in\nlikelihood of mentioning an increased emphasis on personality (60% of men, 49% of\nTo determine whether participants of differing ages were more or less likely to\nyear olds (n = 48). Participants in the two age groups did not differ in their likelihood of\nmentioning any of the four themes, all ps between .21 and .59.\nOf the 103 respondents, only four felt people's preferences do not change. For\nexample, one participant stated, \"People's preferences don't change much. People are\ndrawn to the same type of people regardless of how old they are.\" Other comments noted a\nmaturation of mating desires along with student maturation (but did not specify what that\nmaturation involved) or a move from wanting a wild and fun relationship partner to\nwanting a good friend. Not a single respondent suggested that college students become\nmore short-term oriented or more concerned about good looks, or less long-term oriented or\nless concerned about personality, as they go through college.\nIn summary, the findings from this study indicate a belief among college students\nthat people become more oriented toward commitment and marriage and less driven by\nsexual desires, and more concerned about their partners' internal attributes and less focused\non outward appearances, as they go through college. In Study 2, we investigated whether\nemerging adults of varying ages differ along those lines.\nMethod\nParticipants\n= 20.84) participated in Study 2.1 All participants were of heterosexual or bisexual\norientation and between the ages of 18 and 25. These participants were recruited in two\nways during the first half of the fall semester. Many (186) participants were students in\nintroductory and advanced psychology courses at a public university who participated in\nexchange for credit toward a course research participation requirement; they completed an\nBeliefs versus reality\nonline survey. Second, as part of a class project, students in the first author's research\nmethods course recruited a total of 102 friends from the university and from their\nhometowns to participate; these participants completed either the paper questionnaire or an\nonline survey as per request. The aim was to acquire students at all stages, from those just\ngraduated from high school to those just graduated from college. Upon questioning, no\nstudent in Study 2 expressed awareness of Study 1, so it is unlikely that any participants in\nStudy 2 had also participated in Study 1.\nInstruments and Procedure\nParticipants completed a paper questionnaire or an online survey administered\nthrough SurveyMonkey. Similar to the method used in previous studies (e.g., Li et al.,\n2002), participants were told that they had 50 \"mate dollars\" to be used toward designing\ntheir ideal romantic partner. Note that participants were not instructed to think of either a\nlong-term partner or short-term partner; we intentionally left the context ambiguous so that\nparticipants' current desires would be projected into their allotments. They were instructed\nto allot between 0 and 10 dollars per characteristic, with more dollars indicating somebody\nat a higher percentile of the population. Participants were told, for example, that if they\nallotted 1 dollar toward ambition, then their mate would be at the 10th percentile of\nambition, or more ambitious than 10% of the population and less ambitious than 90% of\nthe population; if they allotted 10 dollars toward ambition, then their mate would be more\nambitious than everyone else in the population. Participants then allotted their mate dollars\nto 10 mate characteristics commonly used in previous research (e.g., Buss, 1989; Li et al.,\ncharacteristics were listed in alphabetical order: ambition, desire for children, emotional\nstability, faithfulness, intelligence, physical attractiveness, potential for financial success,\nsense of humor, similar values, and social popularity.\nAfter allotting their mate dollars, participants reported their sex, sexual orientation,\nage, and education level (high school graduate, one year of college, two years of college,\nthree years of college, four or more years of college, college graduate). Finally, to assess\nshort-term mating strategy, they answered three items taken from Simpson and Gangestad's\n(1991) Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI): (1) How many different partners have you\nhad sexual intercourse with during the past year?, (2) How many different partners do you\nforesee yourself having sex with during the next five years (Please give a specific, realistic\nestimate)?, and (3) How many people have you had sex with on ONE and ONLY ONE\noccasion?\nResults\nAge and education\nParticipants were distributed across age and education level. Participant age and\neducation level were highly correlated, r(288) = .80, p < .001. Because previous research\non emerging adulthood focuses on age rather than on educational level, and because age\nand education level were nearly redundant in this sample, we describe below the findings\nfrom analyses using age as the predictor.\nBelow we provide the results of bivariate correlational analyses between age and\nnumber of sex partners, and between age and mate dollar allotments. To facilitate the\nBeliefs versus reality\ndisplay of age and sex effects simultaneously in graphical form, we split age into three\ngroups: 18 and 19 year olds (the age of most freshmen and some sophomores; male n = 27,\nfemale n = 32), 20 and 21 year olds (the age of most sophomores and juniors; male n = 53,\nfemale n = 85), and 22-25 year olds (the age of most seniors, super-seniors, and college\nAge variation in short-term mating strategy and mate preferences\nThe results of our first study suggested that young men and women believe that\ncollege students' relationship desires and partner preferences change as they move through\nemerging adulthood, such that with age they look more for committed relationships and\nless for short-term sexual relationships, and that they become increasingly concerned with\npartners' internal attributes and less concerned with external attributes. If these beliefs\nrepresent reality, then older students should foresee fewer sex partners in their future and\nshould have had fewer sex partners in the previous year. Additionally, older students\nshould allot more mating dollars toward personality characteristics (such as ambition,\nemotional stability, intelligence, sense of humor, and potential for financial success) and\ncharacteristics pertinent to a long-term relationship (such as faithfulness, similar values,\nand desire for children). Finally, older students should allot fewer mating dollars toward\nphysical attractiveness.\nParticipants' estimates of their future number of sex partners, reports of their recent\nnumber of sex partners, and mate dollar allotments did not confirm these predictions. Both\nacross sex and within each sex, age was not associated with either foreseen number of\ndifferent sex partners in the next five years, all rs  -.06, all ps  .26, or number of different\nsex partners in the previous year, all rs  .09, all ps  .15. Figure 1, with age split into the\nthree categories, displays this lack of an association between age and recent and foreseen\nnumber of sexual partners. Both across sex and within sex, age was positively associated\nwith participants' reported number of one-time sex partners, all rs  .16, ps < .04. This\nassociation between lifetime number of sex partners and age is expected, given that the\nlonger one lives the more sexual partners they are likely to accrue.\nBeliefs versus reality\nFigure 1.

In the overall sample, only one association neared significance: Age was\nnegatively associated with dollars allotted to social popularity, r(288) = -.11, p = .07 (all\nother rs  .08, ps  .17). This trend was driven by men, for whom the association was\nsignificant, r(118) = -.20, p = .03. No other dollar allotment was significantly associated\nwith age for either sex.

No other pair-wise\ncomparisons were significant.\nFigure 2.

Values in parentheses represent standard deviations.\naWomen allotted more dollars than did men; b Men allotted more dollars than did women.\nDiscussion\nThe findings in Study 2 indicate little to no age variation in emerging adults' mating\ndesires and mate preferences. Men's and women's recent and foreseen sexual behavior did\nnot vary with age; nor did their mate dollar allotments; consequently, sex differences in\nmating desires and mate preferences did not vary with age, either.\nIn Study 3 we attempt to address two limitations of Study 2. First, the sample in\nStudy 2 was demographically homogeneous: it was comprised primarily of college students\nand college graduates from a university community in the United States that is over 96%\nCaucasian. In refutation, one could argue that college students are the ideal population for\nstudying role and identity exploration in emerging adulthood (Arnett, 2000), and that\npatterns in people's mating desires and preferences have been clearly documented across\nmany countries and cultural groups. Regardless, in Study 3 we posted our survey on several\npopular internet sites to obtain a more demographically diverse sample of individuals.\nA second limitation of Study 2 is that it did not include specific items to tap long-\nBeliefs versus reality\nterm mating desires. The items used to measure mating strategy were taken from the SOI, a\nwell-validated and commonly used measure of short-term mating orientation, or\nwillingness to engage in casual sex. However, individuals are not necessarily expected to\npursue either short-term sex partners or long-term partners, and plenty of evidence\nindicates the prevalence and advantages of pursuing a dual mating strategy (Gangestad and\nSimpson, 2000; Li and Kenrick, 2006). It is possible that although men's and women's\nwillingness or desire to engage in short-term sexual opportunities may not change much\nover the college years, their interest in long-term mateships might increase. In Study 3,\nthen, we utilize Jackson and Kirkpatrick's (2007) new measure of mating strategies, which\nincludes items that pertain directly to one's attitudes about engaging in committed, long-\nterm mateships.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were individuals between the ages of 18 and 26 who provided complete\nor near-complete responses to our online survey. We posted the survey at each of the\nfollowing websites for internet research, some of which boast page-views from over 60\ncountries and regions around the world: http://webexperiment.net/aboutus.php (U.S.A.);\nhttp://www.socialpsychology.org/addstudy.htm www.onlinepsychresearch.co.uk (United\nKingdom); (U.S.A.); http://psych.hanover.edu/research/exponnet.html (U.S.A.);\nhttp://genpsylab-wexlist.unizh.ch/ (Sweden). We stopped data collection when our sample\nsize reached 400. Because of our primary interest in emerging adulthood (in addition to\nethical concerns), we then omitted data from nearly 50 16-year olds and 17-year olds. We\nalso omitted data from individuals older than 26 because there were so few (one 28-year\nold male, one 30-year old female, etc.). Finally, we omitted data from a number of\nparticipants whose data were deemed inappropriate (e.g., people who left the mate dollar\nitems blank or whose foreseen or past number of sex partners were extreme outliers). Our\ndata (nine individuals were omitted from mate dollar analyses for failing to follow the cap\nof 10 mate dollars for any given characteristic), and 284 provided complete mate\norientation data. All but 10 participants were heterosexual or bisexual (four men reported a\nhomosexual orientation, and three men and three women responded with \"unsure.\").\nInstruments and Procedure\nParticipants first completed the same mate dollar task as in Study 2; this time,\nhowever, we incorporated a required sum of 50 into the mate dollar allotment task. They\nthen completed Jackson and Kirkpatrick's (2007) multidimensional measure of mating\norientations. The measure includes items from the SOI designed to capture interest in short-\nterm mating and previous sexual behavior (see Study 2), as well as additional items to\nassess interest in short-term mating such as, \"Sometimes I would rather have sex with\nsomeone I did not care about,\" and \"I could enjoy sex with someone I find highly desirable\neven if that person does not have long-term potential.\" Jackson and Kirkpatrick's measure\nBeliefs versus reality\nalso includes nine items to capture interest in long-term mating. Sample items include, \"I\ncan see myself settling down romantically with one special person,\" and \"I am interested in\nmaintaining a long-term romantic relationship with someone special.\" Participants provided\nratio scale responses to questions about their past and foreseen number of sex partners; we\nprovided seven-point response scales (strongly disagree to strongly agree) for the short-\nterm and long-term mating orientation items. In our sample, inter-item reliability\n(Cronbach's alpha) was .93 for the short-term mating items and .89 for the long-term\nmating items.\nThe final section of the survey requested demographic information: biological sex,\nage, education level (ranging from high school graduate to college graduate), and sexual\norientation.\nResults\nAge and education\nAs in Study 2, participant age and education level were highly correlated, r(307) =\n.73, p < .001. To provide results in a format comparable to Study 2, we describe all results\nby age.\nBelow we provide the results of bivariate correlational analyses between age and\nsexual behavior, age and mating strategies, and age and mate preferences. To facilitate the\ndisplay of age and sex effects in graphical form, we again split age into three groups: 18\nAge variation in sexual behavior, short-term mating strategy, and long-term mating\nstrategy\nThe results from Study 1 suggested that young men and women believe that college\nstudents' relationship desires change as they move through emerging adulthood, such that\nwith age they look more for committed relationships and less for short-term sexual\nrelationships. If these beliefs reflect reality, then older emerging adults should foresee\nfewer sex partners in their future and should have had fewer sex partners in the previous\nyear. They should also score lower in short-term mating strategy and higher in long-term\nmating strategy, compared to their younger counterparts.\nBeliefs versus reality\nTable 3.

Results suggested a negative\nassociation between men's age and their foreseen number of sex partners over the next five\nyears, although this was only a trend, r(94) = -.17, p = .10. Univariate analyses of variance\nto compare the age groups within each sex revealed essentially the same results as with\ncorrelational analyses, with univariate ANOVA ps > .12; the sole exception was that 18-19\nyear old men (M = 5.94, SD = 1.10) displayed a weaker long-term mating strategy than did\nand mate strategy scores by age group, illustrates the lack of a consistent association\nbetween age and mating desires.\nBeliefs versus reality\nFigure 3.

Although our participants did not spontaneously mention changes in the\nreverse direction, a solid direction for future research would be to provide participants with\nall possible directions of change (e.g., more emphasis on physical attractiveness as well as\nless emphasis on physical attractiveness), and ask them to rate each one for the extent to\nBeliefs versus reality\nwhich they believe it occurs as emerging adults progress through their twenties.\nStudies 2 and 3 of this research documented that emerging adults of varying ages,\nand in varying stages of their education, did not vary systematically in their mating desires.\nConsequently, the sex differences that were observed were of consistent magnitude across\nage: In every age group, men invested more than women did in physical attractiveness,\nexpressed more interest in pursuing sexual opportunities, and (in Study 2) foresaw\nthemselves having more sex partners in the future. These findings coincide with those of\nstudies that have involved both college student and non-college student samples (Grammer,\nfit with sex differences, across age groups, in sex drive (e.g., Klusman, 2006). We caution\nagainst over-interpreting the findings on foreseen number of sex partners, because an\nevolutionary analysis does not necessitate that men and women have any conscious\nawareness of a desire for future sex partners. Notably, Penke and Asendorpf (2008) have\nintroduced a valid and reliable, differentiated measure of short-term sexual strategy that\ndoes not include an estimate of future number of sex partners. We recommend its use in\nsubsequent research on short-term sexual strategy.\nA couple of trends in the data highlight the need for future research in this topic\nwith broad, representative samples of emerging adults of varying ages. For example, in\nStudy 3, in which we acquired an internet sample through a variety of popular sites, we\nfound in the overall sample less emphasis on physical attractiveness with age, and greater\nemphasis on emotional stability and intelligence with age. We are currently in the process\nof designing a longitudinal study to investigate these trends further. That said, the primary\nlimitation of the current investigation is its cross-sectional design. Study 2 and Study 3 data\nwere not collected prospectively, and thus do not serve as clear indicators of stability in\nmating desires and preferences over time. However, there is little reason to suspect cohort\neffects. It is reasonable to expect that, in overall distributions, the 18 year olds in the\nsample will be similar at age 25 to those participants in the sample who are currently 25.\nRegardless, we hope that this initial research prompts researchers to conduct prospective\ninvestigations of individuals' mating desires and preferences. An initial sample of\ngraduating high school seniors, followed up at various points over a decade, could\ndetermine whether and how various factors, such as education, marriage and divorce,\nchildren, and changes to one's mate value, are tied to change in men's and women's mating\norientations and mate preferences.\nBeliefs versus reality\nConclusion\nWe have documented that young adults believe that their peers' mating desires and\npreferences change as they move through their college years and approach graduation.\nSpecifically, young adults believe that their fellow counterparts become more long-term\noriented and less short-term oriented, and more invested in internal characteristics and less\ninvested in external characteristics (such as attractiveness). However, the findings from our\ntwo subsequent studies of emerging adults of varying ages suggest that men's and women's\nmate preferences, short-term mating desires, and long-term mating desires vary little\nbetween the ages of 18 and 26; sex differences in short-term mating desires and in value\nplaced on a mate's physical attractiveness do not vary with age, either. In 1994, writing in\nreference to their 1988 national probability dataset out of the United States that revealed\nconsistent gender differences in marital preferences, Sprecher et al. (1994) concluded with\nthe suggestion that, \"gender differences in mate selection preferences could narrow in the\nnext two decades as young males and females are socialized to value the same traits and are\npresented with equal opportunities in the larger social structure.\" (p. 1079). Our research,\ntwo decades later and with samples clearly embedded in that egalitarian social structure,\nhas failed to support their prediction. Cross-cohort consistencies are suggesting stability\nover time in men's and women's disparate mating desires, perhaps yet again offering\n\"testimony to the long reach of human nature.\" (Pinker, 2002, p. 254). Only prospective\ninvestigations will clarify whether and how mating strategies and partner preferences might\nchange within individuals over time.\nEndnote: 1. The original sample size was 330; however, those whose mate dollar\nallotments summed to greater than or less than $50 were omitted (we prevented this\nsituation in Study 3), as were those who allotted more than $10 to any single characteristic\n(e.g., several people allotted more than $10 to faithfulness). Data from three individuals\nwho did not provide their age and sex were also omitted.\n"
