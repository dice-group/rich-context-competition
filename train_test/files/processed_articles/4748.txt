As with other psychosocial interventions,\nthese include variations in the skills of those who deliver them, the settings where they take\nplace, the characteristics of the recipient populations, and the content of the activity deliv-\nered (Pawson, Greenhalgh, Harvey & Walsh, 2004). This complexity can influence the out-\ncome of the intervention, and raise challenges in understanding the `active ingredients' that\nbring about changes in outcomes (Medical Research Council; MRC, 2006). Creating effec-\ntive interventions first requires a strong theoretical understanding of how they may influence\nchanges in outcomes (MRC, 2006). However there has been little exploration of the under-\nlying conditions and theoretical mechanisms through which any benefits of arts activities\nmay occur (Burnside, Knecht, Hopley & Logsdon, 2017; de Medeiros & Basting, 2013;\nZeilig et al., 2014). De Medeiros and Basting (2013) conclude that in order to improve\nresearch and practice, a better understanding of cultural arts interventions is required, es-\npecially in terms of how and why they may lead to positive outcomes.\nThis is an important area for attention. Critical reviews of arts and health research\nsuggests that participatory art interventions for people living with dementia have the po-\ntential to improve a broad range of outcomes. These include well-being, quality of life,\ncognitive function and communication (de Medeiros & Basting, 2013; Mental Health\nZellig, Killick & Fox, 2014). However the reviews identify that in many instances the\nbenefits are often insufficient and tentative, especially for the visual arts. This is attributed\nto design limitations in some studies, but also because `the field is still in its infancy' (Zeilig\net al., 2014) and requires further research development.\nOf relevance are two recent studies that each developed from qualitative data a grounded\ntheory of how a gallery-based art programme may impact on people with dementia\n(Burnside et al., 2017; Camic, Baker & Tischler, 2015). These studies provide valuable\ninsights, however there are some limitations. Camic et al. (2015) derive their theory\nfrom people with mild to moderate dementia living in the community and able to attend\ngalleries. As they acknowledge, this requires further exploration in different care settings.\nBurnside et al. (2017) recognise their theory is limited to people able to attend galleries with\nearly stage dementia and \"a high degree of previous art experience as well as a higher level of\neducation\" (p.40). Consequently both theories have demographic constraints.\nGiven the growing interest in the arts in dementia care, this paper is a timely contribution\ntowards advancing theoretical understanding. This is important for broader implementa-\ntion. If policy and practice are to adopt arts approaches into mainstream care, understand-\ning the essential conditions for effective delivery is important. What `works' in one setting\nmay not have the same benefits in other settings.\nAims of this research\nReflecting guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions (MRC, 2006) we\naddress this gap in knowledge through a theoretical investigation. Given the current uncer-\ntainty around definitive outcomes of visual arts programmes (and what caused them), the\naim was to explore how visual art interventions might `work' and lead to positive outcomes\nin people living with dementia at all stages of the condition. We undertook the following\nphases of work within the timelines of a wider research project to innovate the development\nof a visual arts intervention for empirical investigation.\n1. Drawing on aspects of realist methodology, papers and reports presenting primary data\nwere examined for theoretical clues about how and why visual arts programmes might\nhave good outcomes. The synthesis developed and tested a preliminary programme\ntheory, producing an exploratory account of how visual arts interventions might `work'.\n2. A qualitative exploration of stakeholders' perspectives (service providers, arts practi-\ntioners, people living with dementia and their carers using arts programmes), regarding\naspects they felt contributed to the success (or otherwise) of their visual arts programme.\n3. An overarching synthesis of the previous two pieces of work, integrated with broader\ntheory, producing a conceptual model of the key features for understanding visual art\nprogrammes, suggesting the foundations for excellent practice.\nMethods\nPart 1 - realist synthesis\nA peer-reviewed protocol for this work is publicly available, providing a detailed account of\nthe methodology for conducting the synthesis (Windle et al., 2014). This method involves\nscrutinising the theoretical foundations of an intervention, exploring how contexts (the\ncircumstances/conditions that enable or constrain) affect outcomes through the activation\nof mechanisms (e.g. Pawson et al., 2004). Our realist inquiry was informed by the\napproaches of Pawson et al. (2004) and Rycroft-Malone et al. (2012) and involved scoping\nthe review, searching and appraising the evidence, extracting and synthesising findings. To\navoid repetition in this paper, Supplementary File 1 summarises some key aspects for clar-\nification, recognising that this approach, whilst growing in popularity may be new to readers\nof this article. We also report any changes and additional details not reported in the original\nprotocol, including updates to the searches.\nAs realist review methodology is an emerging field, there is a lack of consensus about how\ninitial programme theories should be expressed (Pearson et al., 2015). After a number of\ndiscussions within the research team, we initially operationalised our programme theory to\nidentify key features of two contextual factors/conditions hypothesised as important ingre-\ndients for intervention development. 1) Dynamic and responsive artistic practice (by whom\nand how) and 2) a provocative and stimulating aesthetic experience (where, what and how)\nfor people living with dementia (for whom) triggers the mechanisms (why) that lead to\n(outcomes) well-being, quality of life and social connectedness (Windle et al., 2014). We\nthen sought to test and augment this preliminary programme theory with published\nresearch.\nResults\nCharacteristics of included studies\nFigure 1 presents the review process. Table 1 describes eighteen journal articles and five grey\nreports included in the final synthesis. All tended to be small and exploratory, using social\nscience data collection methods (e.g. qualitative, quantitative and observational\napproaches), including mixed-methods. In some studies data were collected from more\nthan one source (e.g. professional/family carers, artists/facilitators, people living with\ndementia).\nA challenge for this synthesis was the design and reporting of some of the included\nstudies. Methodological limitations and different approaches can lead to variations in out-\ncomes. Whilst a realist synthesis does not consider the quality of the research as in a sys-\ntematic review (the focus is on theory building, not definitive statements of effectiveness)\nrigour is an important consideration when drawing conclusions for the programme theory.\nOur appraisal considered a) the study design and sampling, b) whether the data collection\nand analysis were appropriate enough to ensure confidence in the findings, c) if authors\nrecognised the limitations of the study designs; d) was the evidence is clear/insightful, e.g.\ndid the authors' interpretations reflect the reported data; were alternative explanations/\ninterpretations suggested. For information, Supplementary File 2 summarises the comments\non the rigour of the included studies. Some have design and reporting limitations that future\nresearch could attempt to rectify. Others were small but well-conducted exploratory studies\ndelivered in galleries, museums and care settings, but are limited by the demographic profile\nof the participants. All generated theoretical inferences for refining the preliminary pro-\ngramme theory.\nFor whom?\nTable 1 presents the demographic details (where it was available). The studies all tended to\nfocus on older adults, with Camic et al. (2014) reporting a younger participant aged fifty-\neight. Reports of dementia severity varied from mild, early stage through to moderate and\nsevere. However reports were not always supported by data, e.g. an assessment on a mea-\nsure of cognitive function. Ten studies did not report any cognitive functioning scores, and\nof these Roe et al. (2016) did not collect demographic data. Only three studies reported on\nethnicity and three on either occupational status or education level. The grey literature\ntended to omit some demographic details.\nOutcomes\nAcross the included studies, four main outcome areas were reported; 1) social connected-\nness; 2) well-being, including pleasure, enjoyment, quality of life; 3) changes in public\nperceptions and attitudes; 4) cognitive processes (subjective memory, verbal fluency). The\nlatter two added to our initial conceptualisation of the programme theory. Only one study\nused validated quantitative outcome measures, but did not find significant outcomes, pos-\nsibly because the study was under-powered by the small sample size (Camic, Tischler &\nPearman, 2014). Others reported using validated measures of cognitive function (Eekelaar,\nData base searches\nUpdated data base\nSupplementary\nsearches (websites,\nbrowsing)\nn=50 service provider\nwebsites\nRecords after\nduplicates removed\nRecords screened\nsearches\nsupplementary\nsearches\nFull text articles\nassessed\nn=24 journal articles\nIdenficaon\nScreening\nRecords excluded - did\nnot meet the inclusion\ncriteria\nsearches )\nEligibility\nFull-text articles\nexcluded, with reasons\nrelevant, insufficient\ndetail)\nn=6 journal articles (no\ndata presented; opinion\narticles).\nIncluded\nStudies included in\nsynthesis\nn= 5 reports\nFigure 1.

Quantitative content\nanalysis of audio recordings was applied in two studies (Eekelaar et al., 2012; Young et al.,\n2015) tentatively suggesting improvements in cognitive aspects.\nBehavioural observation captured changes in well-being (Kinney & Rentz, 2005; Gross\n(MacPherson, Bird, Anderson, Davis & Blair, 2009). Roe et al. (2016) took a more subjec-\ntive, ethnographic approach with their observation, qualitatively analysing the researcher's\nfieldwork notes from the arts sessions, as did Huzzan et al. (2016). Ullan et al. (2013)\nanalysed written notes and photographic records of the arts sessions. In this synthesis,\nsome of the deeper insights into the outcomes (and mechanisms) come from qualitative\nInterventions\nThe visual arts interventions consisted of either 1) art making/visual art production only; 2)\nviewing and discussing art, also described as art appreciation; 3) a combination of both 1\nand 2. The art interventions reflected two distinct settings for delivery; shared public envi-\nronments (museums and galleries), or specialist dementia care facilities (day centres, resi-\ndential care homes). Generally, the public environments hosted people at the early to\nmoderate stage, whilst the specialist care environments reflected people described as mod-\nerate to severe. The exceptions were Macpherson et al., (2009; people with mild to severe in a\ngallery) and Hazzan et al., (2016; people with moderate to severe in a combination of gallery\nand in-patient ward).\nContextual factor 1: the role of the artists and facilitators\nA key contextual feature underpinning good outcomes was the programme deliverers (var-\niously described as art educators, gallery staff, or artists) were not only knowledgeable about\nart and artistic practice but they also had knowledge and expertise about living with de-\nmentia, the latter often provided through specific training from a professional organisation\nor clinical members of the research team. MacPherson et al. (2009) reported that throughout\nthe duration of the research, a member of the research team provided clinical advice to\ngallery staff. Huzzan et al. (2016) also describe a further exchange of skills, with gallery staff\nproviding training in art appreciation and art-making to clinical staff in the care facility.\nThis combination of arts and dementia skills were important for skilled facilitation.\nSkilled facilitators adopted a perspective of seeing the potential of what could be achieved\nas opposed to what had been lost, understanding and allowing for individual needs and\nabilities yet guiding and supporting when necessary. These included \"patience, less intellec-\ntual and more sensual approaches, less talking and leading and more listening, slowing down\nthe educating process, and not being frightened of the silence\" (Macpherson et al., 2009,\np.751). They embedded a multi-sensory experience within the art activity. In a gallery set-\nting, educators used `visual thinking strategies' to facilitate discussion and communication,\nnot relying on short-term memory or factual recall of information (e.g. Burnside et al.,\nniscence (Flatt et al., 2015; Gross et al., 2014); thinking and learning (MacPherson et al.,\n2009). This context-mechanism combination appeared important for well-being outcomes at\nall stages of dementia, including advanced stages, irrespective of the type of intervention\ndelivered. Skilled facilitation also appeared important for the outcomes of cognitive process\nand social connectedness, however the current data only support this for people in early\nstages of dementia.\nTwo studies provided further support for outcomes being contingent on appropriate\ncontextual attributes. Sessions delivered by high school art students (Brownell, 2008) and\nchaplains or pastoral carers (Byrne & McKinlay, 2012) suggested a lack of facilitation\nexpertise and understanding of dementia. In the latter the facilitator regularly engaged in\nengaged conversation with the staff, but less with the participants. Consequently the data\nsuggest that the attributes of dynamic and responsive artistic practice is a contextual factor\nthat underpins the success of a visual arts programme.\nContextual factor 2: Provocative and stimulating aesthetic experience\nA key feature of programmes delivered through galleries and museums may be the visual\nappeal of the environment, and in all the studies delivered in these settings, original artworks\nwere utilised for the art viewing and discussion. The experience is multi-sensory. Camic et al.\n(2015) suggested that a gallery, open to the public at the same time, enabled an intellectually\nstimulating learning experience, social interaction, increases in confidence and support for\ncarers, which led to enjoyment, changes in the perceptions of dementia from carers and\nfacilitators, and continued connections with the gallery. Such community settings can enable\nparticipants to interact socially not just with each other, but also with the general public.\nRoe et al. (2016) suggested that an intervention in a gallery setting is an opportunity for\nparticipants to be in the `real world', or a protected space which is \"less about the illness\"\n(Flatt et al., 2015, p.9). One study showed how the gallery experience could be taken into a\nspecialist dementia care setting, with a museum collection being viewed digitally via a lap-\ntop and projector, followed by an art-making process (Ullan et al., 2013).\nWhen visual art programmes were designed to be `failure-free', using good quality, age\nappropriate materials that maximised the residual capacities of the participants, they were\nable to trigger positive psychological processes in people living with dementia. These in-\ncluded autonomy, mastery and pride (Flatt et al., 2015) confidence (Camic et al., 2015;\nMalin, 2011) and improved confidence in own skills and abilities; \"I didn't think I could\nlearn things like this at this point\" (Ullan et al., 2011, p.436). All the art viewing and dis-\ncussion programmes sought to facilitate imaginative and emotional responses without the\nparticipants needing any previous knowledge of art. These programmes tended not to em-\nphasise reliance on hard to recall memories, and focussed more on just `being in the\nand achievement, and the \"quality of silence\", reflecting the way people were immersed in\nthe task.\nIn contrast, one of the art-making programmes (Memories in the Making) delivered in\ntalk about memories the paintings stirred, with some well-being outcomes captured. Others,\nalthough not focussing on reminiscence for memory, suggested that participants recalled\nsome memories. This may be understood through the mechanisms of companionship and\ninteraction (Camic et al., 2014); social contact and communication (Eeklaar et al., 2012),\nbonding with others (Flatt et al., 2015), and engagement, social interaction and discussion of\nIn some studies, carers also took part in the arts programme alongside the people with\ndementia. This alternative to the task-focussed aspect of caring appeared to be an important\ncontextual factor, triggering quality time together and carer-patient social interactions, sub-\nsequently improving social connectedness and enjoyment (e.g. Camic et al., 2014; Eeeklar et\nthe group was important for the participants (who had severe dementia) as it facilitated\ncommunication and meaningful relationships, enabling them to see the creative side of the\nperson with dementia and reduce their levels of stress. In contrast MacPherson et al. (2009,\np.750) - perhaps because they were explicitly seeking to challenge notions of excess disability\n- reported how `the presence of carers impacted on participants, noticing that outside of the\ngroup context some participants became less confident in their opinions and actions'. This was\nimproved by asking the carers to sit out of sight of the participants, which enabled inter-\nactions between the artworks, the educator and each other, leading to high levels of engage-\nment and enjoyment.\nFour studies reported outcomes for those facilitating the arts interventions. Student\nvolunteers interacting with care home residents developed a deeper understanding of de-\nmentia and improved confidence, which led to positive attitude changes about older adults\n(Brownell, 2008). Facilitators and artists developed a deep insight into dementia and\nincreases in confidence, leading to different perspective of the condition, despite initial\napprehensions (McPherson et al., 2009), and gained new insights into the abilities and\nchallenges of people living with dementia (Gould, 2012). Schoolchildren age 9-10 years\nold all changed their perceptions after an art-making session with people living with demen-\ntia. \"Just because the people that you'll be working with have dementia it doesn't mean they're\ngonna be totally different `cause they're really nice and kind. . ..as you meet them you just\nforget they have dementia, `cause they're so. . .normal\" (Gregory & Windle, 2013, p.25).\nSummary of synthesis\nTesting the preliminary programme theory found some support for the key contextual\nattributes. We revealed that these conditions generated cognitive, social and psychological\nresponses. In turn, these led to the outcomes of social connectedness; well-being (including\npleasure, enjoyment, quality of life); changes in public perceptions and attitudes and cog-\nnitive processes. In relation to `dynamic and responsive artistic practice' the review sug-\ngested some of the necessary characteristics of the practitioner (by whom) and details of\nskilled facilitation and delivery (how). In relation to `provocative and stimulating aesthetic\nexperience' our analysis suggested `what' was delivered, and `how' it was delivered, were\nimportant. It was less clear from this exploration whether one type of venue (where) may be\nmore stimulating than another. Whilst one aspect of dementia are changes in cognition, the\nother is how this influences, and is influenced by the social environment. The gallery and\nmuseum as a `valued place' (Camic et al., 2015) or `special place' (Burnside et al., 2017) is an\nintriguing proposal, and further research could explore the extent to which care settings can\nbe transformed to reflect such inspirational environments. As an example, Basting, Towie\nand Rose (2016) described how they enacted a depiction of The Odyssey in the day-to-day\nrunning of care facility. This engaged residents, staff and family members in a uniquely\ncreative way to improve quality of life, showing how the arts can transform environments.\nThe next step in this theory building exercise explores stakeholder experiences of visual\nart programmes, and then develops the final overarching synthesis, including substantive\ntheory into the model. Following that, the strengths and weaknesses are considered in the\ndiscussion.\nMethods\nPart 2 \u00adStakeholder perspectives\nOver a three-month period, self-reported qualitative data were obtained. This explored\nexperiences of taking part and delivering visual art programmes, what people felt were\nthe elements of a good programme, what they thought worked well and was beneficial,\nand what they felt should not be done. A call for responses was initially distributed using a\nsnowball sampling approach through the research team's networks and email distribution\nlists. The target group were stakeholders with experience of either delivering or taking part\nin visual art programmes. Participants were invited to submit their responses into either a\nbespoke online or paper copy document. This contained a short explanation of the purpose\nof the work, with requests to recipients to circulate. The university's research ethics com-\nmittee approved the work. Taking approximately 15 minutes to complete, it explained why\nwe sought their input, their rights as research participants, including assurances regarding\ndata protection, and their consent to participate. It was designed to be simple and under-\nstood by all, including those with early stage dementia.\nAnalysis\nResponses were analysed independently by two researchers (TH and SG) using thematic\nanalysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). This consisted of a detailed reading and annotation of the\nresponses, followed by inductive coding and theming from the text to capture patterns in the\nstakeholder's experiences of visual art programmes for people with dementia. This was an\niterative process with refinements on coding and themes reached through ongoing discus-\nsion. To avoid unnecessary bias, both researchers did not work on the data extraction and\nsynthesis in phase 1.\nResults\nThirty-seven people responded to the survey (6 male, 26 female, 5 not reported). These\ndescribed themselves as health professionals (n=2); artist/facilitators (n=13); service pro-\nviders (n=6); academic/clinical (n=1); carers (n=5); people living with dementia (n=5),\nand one person with mental health difficulties. Four respondents described themselves as\nboth a service provider and an assistant facilitator. The majority of responses came from\nEngland (18) and Wales (16) with two from America and one from Australia. In view of the\nresources and timescale for this phase of work, we aimed for a broad range of responses\nfrom a diverse range of expertise in different geographical localities. Whilst we had some\nsuccess, the unequal balance of respondent characteristics indicate that further themes could\nemerge with more data from different stakeholder groups, however a qualitative comparison\nstudy was beyond the remit of this phase of the work. However the findings are relevant for\ntheoretical development and informing the conceptual model.\nStakeholder perspectives\nResults of the thematic analysis of the stakeholder perspectives are presented in Table 2,\nalong with example quotes. In summary, stakeholders emphasised treating the person living\nwith dementia as a capable individual and allowing them freedom of expression. They\nsuggested programmes should be flexible and include different arts activities and skills,\nboth challenging and stimulating to the participant, with good quality, adult-appropriate\nmaterials that are inspiring and engaging. Professional artists may have unique expertise to\nbenefit participants. A careful balance is required for people with dementia in terms of\nsupport, but also independence to develop and work at their own pace. People with demen-\ntia and carers valued the opportunity to work `alongside people in a similar situation'.\nLogistics were a theme from this analysis. Similarly, some of the papers and reports\ncontained suggestions regarding organising art programmes for people with dementia. It\nwas unclear as to whether these aspects had any influence on the mechanisms and outcomes,\nbut as they provide useful suggestions for planning and implementing services, these are\nfurther summarised in Supplementary File 1.\nPart 3 - Overarching synthesis and conceptual framework. The first phase of this work uncovered a\nnumber of contextual attributes which if in place generated cognitive, social and individual\nresponses leading to beneficial outcomes. The second phase sought first-hand accounts from\nstakeholders, and this final synthesis examines whether the themes from their qualitative\naccounts corroborate, enhance or refute the realist programme theory.\nThere was considerable corroboration between the qualitative data and the realist pro-\ngramme theory, in particular the qualitative data emphasised and augmented the impor-\ntance of the programme content and the qualities of those delivering the programme,\nproviding further accounts of the key attributes of the quality of the experience and artistic\npractice. Differences were apparent in terms of outcomes. The research tended to focus on\nimprovements or change, whereas the qualitative accounts from the survey placed little or\nno importance on whether well-being or memory improvement should be, or was achieved,\nbut there were clear expressions of enjoyment. The qualitative data enhanced evidence for\nthe outcome of social connectedness, with the public celebration of achievements being an\nimportant way for bringing people together.\nIn terms of the severity of dementia, the qualitative data does not elaborate on this\ncharacteristic. Most (but not all) of the research literature describe the severity in their\nsamples. However whether early or late stage, there is a general sense of the benefits, and\nit is not possible from this evidence base to say that a certain programme might be less\neffective according to the level of dementia.\nA further important aspect of a realist approach to theory building is to test the coher-\nence of the programme theory by drawing on broader, formal theories to elucidate further\nunderstanding of the context-mechanism-outcome relationships (Wong, Westhorp, Pawson\n& Greenhalgh, 2013). As the synthesis progressed, three broader theories (cognitive stimu-\nlation, resilience and person-centred care) provided additional explanation for the cognitive,\nsocial and psychological mechanisms (`why') which may arise from the interplay between\nTable 2.

These are particularly\nrelevant as they also underpin practice delivery initiatives.\nCognitive stimulation\nCognitive stimulation is a form of `mental exercise' and a psychosocial treatment for people\nwith dementia where a number of enjoyable activities provide general stimulation for think-\ning, concentration and memory, usually in a social setting, such as a small group. Cognitive\nstimulation may be a key aspect of visual art programmes, as there is congruence between\nthe `guiding principles' of cognitive stimulation, as described by Aguirre et al., (2011) and\nthe attributes of the two contextual aspects of art programmes uncovered in this work.\nResilience\nResilience describes how people manage to have good outcomes despite significant difficul-\nty. Achieving resilience is contingent upon protective factors that operate at the level of the\nindividual (e.g. psychological resources) social (family and friends, participation) and wider\nsociety, such as services and environments (Windle, 2011). The synthesis demonstrates a\nnumber of resilience aspects. First, people living with a significant challenge to their lives \u00ad\ndementia - reported positive outcomes. Second, this can be understood by considering the\ninterplay between the contextual factors and the reactions they triggered. These included\nautonomy, mastery and pride, (Flatt et al., 2015) confidence (Camic et al., 2015) and im-\nproved confidence in own skills and abilities (Ullan et al., 2013). The interplay between the\ncontexts and psychological resources provided resilience for adaptation and a positive\noutcome.\nPerson-centred care\nOne of the major influences of dementia care is Kitwood's theory of person-centred care\n(1997), where well-being is a direct result of the quality of relationships between people with\ndementia and those around them. There is an interdependency between the quality of the\ncare environment and the quality of life experienced by people with dementia. Of relevance\nare suggestions of twelve positive interactions that are theorised to underpin good dementia\ncare (Kitwood, 1997). These are particularly appropriate for creative arts programmes as\nthey corroborate and augment the necessary conditions (provocative and stimulating aes-\nthetic experience; dynamic and responsive artistic practice) triggering the mechanisms that\nlead to outcomes (see Figure 2).\nGiven the growing interest in the arts for dementia care, recognising that many people\nwill be developing their skills and practice, our findings can be summarised into a conceptual\nframework for intervention and further research. This suggests the essential attributes of the\nconditions and processes for improving outcomes of visual arts programmes for people\nliving with dementia, which reflect a cognitively stimulating, person-centred activity\n(Figure 2).\nDiscussion\nThis paper explored the theoretical foundations of visual art programmes for people living\nwith dementia, drawing on published research and reports, stakeholders' experiences, and\nreflecting these within broader theoretical perspectives. Bringing these sources together\nmakes a distinctive contribution to a current gap in knowledge about how and why arts\ninterventions may lead to positive outcomes. The emerging theory and conceptual model\nreveal evidence of the attributes of two key conditions (provocative and stimulating aes-\nthetic experience; dynamic and responsive artistic practice) that could underpin effective\nprogrammes in any given setting. These conditions were important for a number of cogni-\ntive, social and individual responses, which led to improvements in well-being, cognitive\nprocesses and social connectedness for people with early to more advanced dementia. More\nbroadly, improved perceptions of dementia were found within the wider social networks of\npeople living with dementia. The theories of cognitive stimulation, resilience and person-\ncentred care further explain how and why visual art programmes may `work'.\nStrengths and limitations\nIdentifying and understanding the theoretical basis of interventions is important for service\ndevelopment, definitive tests of effectiveness and implementation (MRC, 2006). If the un-\nderpinning theory is incorrect, then the desired changes will not occur (Astbury & Leeuw,\n2010). We have used this exploratory work to inform the development of a visual arts\nprogramme to benefit well-being, quality of life and social connections of people living\nwith all stages of dementia. This has been subjected to testing within a mixed-methods\nlongitudinal framework, and adapted into a guide for practitioners and service providers\nwho may wish to deliver similar projects (Parkinson, Windle & Taylor, 2017). Further work\nwill seek to implement this into practice, along with ongoing iterations and refinements. To\nour knowledge, this work represents the first use of realist methodology in arts and science\nFigure 2. Conceptual model of how visual art programmes may `work'.\nresearch to inform intervention development, and contributes to an emerging field in evi-\ndence review.\nThe initial theorising was undertaken by a multi-disciplinary team (arts, humanities,\nsocial sciences). We acknowledge that another review team may have made different judge-\nments about the conceptual model. Whilst we have followed realist inquiry, we are aware\nthis is a subjective, qualitative approach and we may have overlooked other relevant the-\nories. However this work is exploratory and we do not propose it as a definitive theory.\nOther theoretical approaches to understanding how visual arts programmes impact on well-\nbeing could be suggested in the future, particularly as the arts and health literature develops.\nNevertheless, this model could serve as a first point of reference upon which other work\ncould build.\nA further limitation and important caveat is the synthesis can only reflect the evidence\nfrom which it is derived. For some of the included studies and reports, there were method-\nological limitations. Most papers tended to report little information about the practitioners,\nlimiting the inferences drawn about this contextual factor. There was variable reporting of\nthe intervention content. This was previously identified as a wider problem common to non-\npharmacological interventions, which led to the development of a template for intervention\ndescription and replication to assist clarity in reporting interventions (Hoffman et al., 2014).\nWe suggest future studies could utilise this template to guide their reporting. This will be of\nbenefit to service providers who may wish to adopt a similar programme, and researchers\nwho wish to critically examine primary research.\nWe sought a range of stakeholder experiences, including people living with dementia as\nwell as carers, artists and service providers, both as users and providers of art services, using\na snowballing method to seek responses. A strength of the methods used to obtain stake-\nholder perspectives was there were no interactions with participants to influence their\nanswers. However the sampling does not permit a calculation of the response rate, conse-\nquently there may be other contradictory opinions we have not captured. Despite best\nefforts with requests, including sending reminders, the responses favour artists and organ-\nisers reflections on practice, with less from service recipients (N \u00bc 5 people with dementia\nand N=5 carers). Nevertheless synthesising secondary sources with primary data adds to\nthe current theorising around of how visual art programmes might be effective.\nImplications for practice\nCamic et al. (2015) discuss whether a gallery setting, considered a `valued place' in their\nqualitative exploration of a gallery-based project, is a different experience and so has a\ndifferent impact compared to other settings. Our synthesis could not draw any definitive\ndistinctions between settings (shared public spaces or specialist dementia care facilities), or\nin terms of outcomes, largely due to the lack of literature. However the better conducted\nstudies were either delivered within a gallery (e.g. Burnside et al., 2017; Camic et al.; 2014;\nMacPherson et al., 2009) or reflected a gallery programme in care settings (e.g. Ullan et al.,\n2013). Art museums and cultural venues have considerable potential for public health pro-\nmotion, however with the exception of MacPherson et al. (2009) and Hazzan et al. (2016)\nthere is little evidence of galleries being used in a public health context for people who may\nbe more severely impaired. These studies indicate the possibilities, and an area for further\ndevelopment.\nThere are also opportunities for museums and arts organisations, with their collections\nand skilled staff, to deliver the `gallery experience' in other settings such as hospitals and\nresidential care. This review only identified three studies undertaking outreach activities (e.g.\nfor transformative care practice.\nImplications for further research\nFew included studies reported any detail about ethnicity and socio-economic status.\nConsequently there is a question over the extent to which the conceptual model reflects\nthe experiences of different ethnic and social groups. Despite the potential of galleries and\nmuseums, they can appear exclusive, attracting those with prior arts engagement (e.g.\nBurnside et al., 2017) and disproportionately drawing people from a higher socio-\neconomic position (Mathews et al., 2016). Recognising the growing global interest in the\nsocial inclusion of people living with dementia (Lin & Lewis, 2015) further research should\nmake efforts to recruit participants from diverse backgrounds. It is also worth considering\nthat different types of dementias may lead to different preferences and outcomes, which may\nbe worthy of further investigation.\nThere was limited evidence for the impact of taking part on cognitive outcomes, partic-\nularly at more severe levels of dementia. Three studies explored this aspect (Young et al.,\ntions. The theoretical model suggests the art activity is cognitively stimulating, consequently\nfurther research could assess of cognitive function. A further limitation relates to the extent\nto which the outcomes may be uniquely attributed to the art activity, and further research\ncould usefully examine this through a control-comparison condition.\nConclusion\nBy synthesising research on visual arts in dementia care, academic theory and the lived\nexperience of stakeholders, our exploration substantively contributes to understanding\nhow and why visual arts programmes are suggested to achieve outcomes. This framework\nalso has the potential for application with other arts activities. As further research critically\nexplores, challenges and tests this conceptual model, theoretical refinements will improve\nresearch and practice. This could strengthen the evidence base for the arts in dementia care,\nand subsequently provide a stronger platform to inform policy.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest withrespect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nDescription of authors' roles\nGW led the main study and was responsible for the analysis, drafting this manuscript and secured\nfunding (with DO'B AN as co-applicants).
