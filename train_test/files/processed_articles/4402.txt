Participants have included the full range of uni-\nversity students: from freshmen to PhD students. These stu-\ndents have served in a variety of roles and have performed\nwork spanning numerous disciplines of study. Many students\nworked on topics related to their major; a few pursued topics\nof interest that did not align with their field of academic\nstudy. Numerous teams were instantiated; each was led by a\nstudent team leader and mentored by a faculty member. In\nsome disciplines (e.g., computer science and electrical engi-\nneering), student group leaders managed the interaction\nbetween multiple teams (each of which had its own team\nlead). Participants were able to learn new skills and apply\nexisting skills to a real-world challenge. They also gained\nskills related to working with students in different disci-\nplines: They learned the vernacular of these different fields\nas well as the working styles of their practitioners.\nSome students participated in the project to satisfy a proj-\nect component of a course or for independent or directed\nstudy credit. Many, however, participated as volunteers to\ngain experience in this real-world project which operated, in\nmany ways, like an industry project. While the project had\nestablished learning goals (and delivered, based on partici-\npant feedback, some unanticipated learning benefits), it did\nnot incorporate formal test-based assessment techniques, as\nthe learning experience and topics varied by individual areas\nof participation. Student participants, instead, were asked to\nrespond to an experience assessment survey, which asked\nthem to characterize their competence in key learning focus\nareas prior to and after program participation. This article\npresents and analyzes the responses from a limited number\nof undergraduate participants in the program.\nBackground\nThe OpenOrbiter program draws on several different areas of\nprior work. It is working to design, build, and validate a\nCubeSat-class spacecraft, drawing (as would be expected)\nheavily on prior work in small spacecraft design. As an expe-\nriential or project-based research experience, it also draws on\nprior work in the design and operation of these techniques.\nBoth these topics are now expanded upon.\nCubeSat Spacecraft\nCubeSats were developed as an educational tool by Robert\nTwiggs and Jordi Puig Suari (Deepak & Twiggs, 2012).\nReducing the spacecraft size and complexity facilitates the\n1Department of Computer Science, University of North Dakota, Grand\nForks, USA\n2Department of Space Studies, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks,\nUSA\nCorresponding Author:\nJeremy Straub, Department of Computer Science, University of North\nEmail: jeremy.straub@my.und.edu\nAssessing the Value of the OpenOrbiter\nProgram's Research Experience for\nUndergraduates\nJeremy Straub1, David Whalen2, and Ronald Marsh1\n Keywords\nundergraduate research, undergraduate education, small spacecraft development, CubeSat\n2 SAGE Open\nuse of the spacecraft in educational settings, allowing stu-\ndents to, prospectively, be involved in the complete space-\ncraft design, construction, and validation process during\ntheir academic career. CubeSats have been successfully\ndeveloped by numerous institutions (Klofas, 2011; Klofas,\nSwartwout, 2011) served educational purposes; more\nrecently, CubeSats have been used for bona fide research,\ncommunications, and other mission types. CubeSats were\ndesigned to cost a fraction of the price of larger spacecraft\nhas demonstrated that this cost can be driven lower through\nthe use of publically available design documents and low-\ncost, readily available parts.\nExperiential Learning for Undergraduates\nExperiential learning (also commonly known as problem-\nbased or project-based learning) has been demonstrated to be\neffective at all levels of the educational continuum (Brodeur,\nWaitz, Brodeur, Soderholm, & Nasr, 2002; Mathers,\nGoktogen, Rankin, & Anderson, 2012; Mountrakis &\nTriantakonstantis, 2012; Straub, Berk, Nervold, & Whalen,\n2013) and across numerous disciplines (Correll, Wing, &\nRobson, Dalmis, & Trenev, 2012; Saunders-Smits, Roling,\nBreiter, Cargill, and Fried-Kline (2013), in the context of\nundergraduate hospitality management education, surveyed\nindustry perception of the value of experiential education\nand found that industry perceptions of value included student\nlearning of technical and management skills as well as learn-\ning related to intangible aspects of the field. In the context of\nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)\nundergraduate education, work (Simons et al., 2012) at\nWidener University demonstrated how student participation\nin an in-the-field experiential learning exercise increased\nstudent understanding (as both self-assessed by students and\nassessed by their field supervisors) of subject material and its\nreal-world application; it also caused the student participants\nto gain a better understanding of the needs and intricacies of\nthe populations that they were serving. Students also indi-\ncated that participation increased their interest in careers in\nthe field and caused them to learn relevant terminology and\ntime management skills. They also indicated that they gained\nan appreciation of the duties of a professional job in the field\nand assessed themselves as \"better prepared\" for workforce\nentry or to pursue graduate studies. Bauerle and Park (2012)\nconducted work that demonstrated the value of an experien-\ntial exercise in increasing knowledge retention. They found\nthat students who participated in the experiential exercise\nincreased homework scores by 12% and the scores of those\nwho fully participated (including participating in a tree\nclimbing exercise) increased by 19%. The impact of this\nwork was the greatest for students outside of the STEM dis-\nciplines participating in the STEM plant science course.\nEdwards, Jones, Wapstra, and Richardson (2012) demon-\nstrated that experiential learning techniques increased stu-\ndent engagement. In response to declining honors level (an\noptional 4th year program for undergraduate students com-\nmon to many institutions outside of the United States) enroll-\nment, they incorporated experiential elements into all 3 years\nof their base undergraduate program. While demonstrating\ncorrelation only anecdotally (and failing to account for\nHawthorne effect attributable changes, though the magnitude\nof the Hawthorne effect is an open research question; Cook,\ndata suggests that the experiential inclusions stemmed the\nGilkeson, and Phillips (2012) describe the role of experien-\ntial elements in the Harvey Mudd College Engineering pro-\ngram. They show a significantly significant (at p < .05)\npositive difference in the performance of Harvey Mudd\nCollege students as compared with students at 30 other engi-\nneering schools. Perhaps more significantly, they demon-\nstrate the efficacy of and ability of first-year students to\neffectively participate in design projects.\nOpenOrbiter Program\nThe OpenOrbiter program is a student-conceptualized, stu-\ndent-led program that aims to provide opportunities for stu-\ndent research and experience related to spacecraft design and\nengineering, software design and practical experience in\nmany supporting areas. Student team members defined the\nproject's scope, starting from a loosely defined concept of\nbuilding a CubeSat, as well as specific program objectives,\nwork areas, and timelines. The name, logo, and other project\nbranding elements were also developed by student partici-\npants. The following sections provide an overview of the\nprogram and its progress, highlight key learning objectives,\nand discuss undergraduate participation to date.\nOverview\nThe OpenOrbiter initiative aims to create design materials\nfor the Open Prototype for Educational NanoSats (OPEN)\nkg) CubeSat-class spacecraft based on these designs. OPEN\nis poised to have a positive impact on aerospace engineering,\nmission critical system software development, and other\nfields through making a complete set of CubeSat designs,\nfabrication instructions, testing plans, and other materials\nfreely available. The OPEN designs target a materials cost of\nal., 2013). This places the cost of the spacecraft at a level that\nStraub et al. 3\ncould, in many institutions, potentially be supported by\nteaching or institutional funds (as opposed to requiring extra-\nmural funding). This reduced cost level also acts to enable\nresearch projects that may not be able to attain the levels of\nfunding required for more expensive approaches. The\nreduced cost level also decreases the impact of failure, allow-\ning more freedom to take risks and allow, in the case of edu-\ncational projects, student leadership and decision making.\nThe OPEN design is different from traditional CubeSats\nin that it utilizes vertical insertion of the printed circuit\nboards instead of physical stacking of horizontal boards.\nEach of the four sides of the spacecraft, shown in Figure 1, is\ncomprised of a board, which is held in place by corner posts\nwith a retaining track. Electronic connectors are included in\nboth the top and bottom plates, which allow electrical stack-\ning of the boards without requiring physical stacking. This\nconfiguration also makes it very apparent if a board is not\ncompletely or properly seated, as the top plate cannot be\nlocked in place.\nThe software that will accompany the OPEN design will\nrun on top of a customized Linux kernel. It has been sepa-\nrated into three primary development efforts: operating soft-\nware, payload software, and ground station software. A\nverification and validation group assesses the software cre-\nated by the other groups to ensure flight-readiness. The oper-\nating software controls the moment-by-moment operations\nof the spacecraft, commanding all sensors, actuators, and\nsubsystems. The payload software plans payload objective\nperformance tasks and processes the data collected during\nthese tasks. The ground station software communicates with\nthe onboard operating software to convey controller instruc-\ntions in the form of new tasks, task cancellations, and task\nmodifications.\nLearning Objectives\nA number of learning objectives were set at the beginning of\nthe OpenOrbiter program. These objectives were identified\nbased on a combination of the identification of areas where\ntraditional curriculum was lacking and prospective learning\nbenefits that could be conveyed by a small spacecraft pro-\ngram. These objectives fall into several large categories:\ntechnical skills, communications skills, teamwork skills,\nspacecraft design skills, and time/project management skills.\nThe project also sought to increase student excitement about\ntheir field of technical participation and about space in\ngeneral.\nThe technical skills category is defined as being com-\nprised of all elements of the team's work which are not\nspacecraft-specific. These categories should have a loose\ncorrelation with a subfield of an academic discipline, based\non how teams were divided. Some teams' work covered a\nfew related subfields; in a few limited cases, teams were\nthemselves interdisciplinary due to the nature of the work\nthey were performing.\nThe communications skills category covered both work-\nplace communications and presentation skills.\nCommunications skills were deemed to be an important\nfocus, as they are enumerated as a required component of\nvarious discipline-specific accreditation programs. The lack\nof interdisciplinary communication skills by graduates was\nalso identified as a prospective problem (as employers would\nbe required, in the absence of its correction in academia, to\nbear the cost of this reduced productivity and training).\nLearning related to these interdisciplinary communications\nskills was deemed to be a benefit that could only be produced\nby a project, such as OpenOrbiter, with significant interdisci-\nplinary participation.\nThe category of teamwork skills was comprised of the\nskills required to participate effectively in a large team.\nUnlike many class projects where students self-select a group\nof peers with whom (in many cases) they may already be\nfriends with, OpenOrbiter placed students together based on\ntheir thematic interest. While, certainly, many students knew\none another, the broad promotion of the project campus-wide\nresulted in many groups being composed of collections of\nindividuals who were not previously well acquainted. This\nincluded the pairing of undergraduate and graduate students,\nindividuals from different disciplines and across multiple\nyear levels. For this reason, the project was an exercise in\nteamwork skills closely resembling the workplace, where\none may be required to work with individuals not previously\nknown or liked by them.\nSpacecraft design skills were comprised of spacecraft\ndesign-specific technical skills. These included skills and the\nassociated knowledge about the spacecraft design process as\nwell as knowledge and abilities related to designing for the\nharsh and different environment of space. The validation\nFigure 1. OpenOrbiter spacecraft computer aided design (CAD)\nfile (Brewer, Badders, Berk, & Straub, 2013).\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 3.

Division of Undergraduate Respondents by Role.\nRole Quantity\nParticipant 9\nTeam lead 4\ndesigns and their implementation for the space environment\nwas also a critical element of this category.\nTime and project management were identified as impor-\ntant skills that were also lacking in other areas of the tradi-\ntional curriculum. While students might have an\nappreciation for managing their own efforts (though for\nsome, this may be the cram-at-the-last-moment mentality),\nworking with others in a large interdependent project\nrequires a significantly more robust skillset. It necessitates\nan understanding of what areas represent dependencies for\nothers (and which do not) to facilitate decision making and\nprioritization in a time-resource-constrained environment.\nTeam and group leaders, in addition to managing their own\ntime relative to project, academic and other commitments,\nalso had to learn the skills required to manage the efforts of\nothers.\nWhile all of these areas were deemed to be important (and\ncovered by the program in some way), assessment during\nthis initial period was limited to a subset. Future work will\nfocus on assessing additional learning objectives.\nUndergraduate Participation\nUndergraduate participation is ubiquitous throughout the\nprogram. Undergraduates have participated in every team\nand have served as team leaders for several teams. One\nundergraduate served as a group leader (leading other under-\ngraduate and one graduate student team leaders).\nUndergraduate participation has included individuals who\nvolunteered, one individual who was funded to work on the\nprogram through a competitive internal (to the university)\nundergraduate researcher support program, and individuals\nwho have participated as part of a class project or indepen-\ndent study. There is at least one instance of an individual who\nstarted working on the project as an undergraduate continu-\ning to participate as a graduate student; more transitions of\nthis type appear imminent.\nUndergraduate participants have expressed several gen-\neral classes of reasons for participating. Some partici-pate\nbecause the project and the chance to launch something into\nspace at the end excite them. Many participate to improve\ntechnical skills in a particular area or to learn a new technical\nskill. Others have indicated that their reason for participating\nis to gain experience in working on a team project that is\nmuch larger than anything they have been exposed to in\nclasses. Still others are participating to satisfy a specific\ndegree or a course objective.\nThe undergraduates who have participated have expressed\ngeneral pleasure with the results so far. Anecdotally, several\nexamples of the program being discussed in an interview\n(and helping the participant secure an internship or position)\nhave been mentioned to the authors. The following sections\npresent a more formal assessment of program performance in\nundergraduate students.\nResults\nAn assessment survey was distributed to student participants\nin the OpenOrbiter program in April 2013 during regular\nteam meetings. Both graduate and undergraduate students\nresponded to this survey; however, only the responses of\nundergraduates are presented and analyzed in this article.\nThese students spanned all four undergraduate class levels\n(see Table 1) and three disciplines (see Table 2). They ranged\nin grade point average (GPA) from 3.0 to 4.0 (see Table 3).\nThe group surveyed included both individuals who partici-\npated in a team lead role and who participated as team mem-\nbers (see Table 4). The average amount of time spent by\nparticipants was also collected; this is presented in Table 5.\nQuantitative Results\nImprovement in five of the key educational goal areas was\nassessed. Reported status by undergraduate students prior to\nand after program participation is presented in Figure 2. As\nTable 1. Division of Undergraduate Respondents by Class Level.\nClass Quantity\nSophomore 2\nFreshman 2\nTable 2. Division of Undergraduate Respondents by Major.\nMajor Quantity\nEntrepreneurship 2\nElectrical engineering 1\nStraub et al. 5\nshown in this figure, undergraduates reported improvement\nin all five areas. The most significant growth was reported in\nspacecraft design skills; the second most was reported in\nfocus-specific technical skill growth. Figure 3 depicts the\naverage level of improvement, by category. Figure 4 shows\nthe average level of improvement enjoyed by those who\nshowed improvement in a given category. Note that, for the\npurposes of calculation, three anomalous prior/post score\ncombinations (indicating an effective decline) have been\nremoved. These data points appear to be clerical errors, as\nthe related attribution levels reported were not negative (as\none would expect if an actual decline had occurred).\nStudent respondents were then asked to characterize the\nprogram's impact on creating the changes described. They\nwere asked to rate, on a 9-point scale (ranging from 1 =\nstrongly disagree to 9 = strongly agree), whether they agreed\nwith statements indicating the project had improved the skill\ncategory in question. Technical skill improvement is attributed\nto this with a 6.9 average response (just below the 7-agree\nmark); improvement in space interest received a 6.3 response\n(also near the agree threshold). The response with regard to\npresentation skills was less positive: a 4.8 response just below\nthe no-preference level. Figure 5 shows the distribution of\nresponses for each category. For technical skills, 84.6% of\nresponses were in the positive (program was impactful) range.\nFor space interest, 76.9% were in the positive (impactful)\nrange. For presentation skills, only 15.4% were in the positive\n(impactful) range, whereas 53.8% were in the indifferent cat-\negory and 30.8% were in the negative (non-impactful) range.\nTech.

Histogram of responses for each status for\nimprovement attribution questions.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe impact of serving as a team lead was also considered.\nFour team leads were included among the 13 respondents.\nAll four team leads reported spending between 4 and 7.99 hr\nper week on the project; only one non-lead participant spent\nthis much time (all of the rest spent between 1 and 3.99 hr per\nweek on the project). The average duration of involvement in\nthe project, for team leads, was slightly longer (0.8 year as\nopposed to 0.7 year), the average GPA was marginally lower.\nTeam leads were either juniors or seniors (while non-lead\nparticipants spanned all four undergraduate years).\nTeam leads, as shown in Figure 6, attributed technical skill\ngains to project participation to a greater extent (7.3 vs. 6.8\naverage) than non-lead participants. They attributed increase\nin space excitement to the project significantly less (5 vs. 7\naverage) and improvement in presentation skills marginally\nless. As shown in Figure 7, they significantly outperformed\nnon-lead participants in all five categories. The most signifi-\ncant outperformance was in improvement in spacecraft design\n(1.0 greater average improvement), followed by presentation\ncomfort (0.78 average improvement) and technical skills\n(0.75 average improvement). They outperformed in excite-\nment about space by 0.4 and in presentation skills by 0.3. The\nlevel of improvement, for those showing improvement, also\nwas greater for team leads in each category (as shown in\nFigure 7).\nIn addition to showing greater improvement across the\nboard, team leads had a greater percentage of respondents\nshowing improvement in four of the five categories (techni-\ncal skills, design skills, presentation skills, and presentation\ncomfort). Non-lead participants reported a greater number of\nindividuals showing improvement in space excitement. This\nis depicted in Figure 8.\nQualitative Results\nIn addition to program assessment conducted through cate-\ngorical and scale-response questions, an open-ended ques-\ntion was also provided to allow respondents to highlight\nother areas of value to them. Of the 13 undergraduate respon-\ndents, 6 included comments in response to this question. The\nquestion was phrased as follows:\nPlease share with us: (a) any areas where you believe the project\nmay have provided you with particular benefit and/or (b) any\ncomments on any of the above questions and/or (c) any other\nareas of benefit that you enjoyed that were not discussed.\nThe first highlighted leadership skills, presumably as an\narea of particular benefit or an area not discussed. The sec-\nond indicated that the largest benefit that they received was\ninvolvement in a large project and the opportunity that this\nprovided for them gaining experience working in teams. This\nwas mirrored by another respondent who also indicated a\nbenefit from group work. The fourth indicated that the proj-\nect was useful in \"introducing\" the respondent to \"group-\nbased computer science work\"; they also benefited from\nlearning about validation and testing activities. The fifth\nindicated that the project had \"opened\" his or her \"eyes\" to\nImp. Tech Skills Imp. Space Interest Imp. Presentaon Skills\nParcipants Team Leads\nFigure 6.

This individ-\nual also commented on his or her ability to gain experience\nin a particular technical skill that he or she otherwise would\nnot have had an opportunity to learn. Finally, the sixth\nrespondent indicated that the program had allowed the direct\napplication of material learned in his or her classes and also\nexpanded his or her knowledge in both these related and\nother areas.\nAnalysis of Results\nThe results presented in the preceding section indicate that the\nmajority of the surveyed participants were upper-level under-\ngraduates with good GPAs (3.0 and higher). Most spent less\nthan 4 hr per week on the project, whereas a few spent between\n4 and 8 hr per week on the project. Roughly a third of those\nsurveyed were team leads (there is a high level of correlation\nbetween the 4-8 category and being a team lead). Respondents\nwere largely computer science majors (approximately 75%),\nthough electrical engineering and the non-STEM entrepre-\nneurship major were also represented. This distribution was\nnot representative of overall participation in the project.As the\nstudents self-selected for participation and the project occurred\nlargely at a single institution, the ability to generalize these\nresults to other projects and other institutions is limited. This\nbeing said, the results serve to demonstrate initial successes\nthat serve to justify future work and assessment.\nThe results demonstrate improvement across all measured\ncategories (and anecdotally, based on free-response com-\nments, across some categories not specifically assessed).\nThis improvement was particularly centered in the technical\nskills and spacecraft design categories, with an average\nimprovement of 20% of the scale in these two categories.\nStrong attribution (nearly 7-agree) also existed for the tech-\nnical skill category. Space excitement and presentation skills\nand comfort also showed improvement (between 10% and\n15% of the scale range); however, the attribution for the pre-\nsentation skills category was not strong. The level of benefit\nenjoyed by team leads was shown to be significantly greater\nthan for non-lead participants: In two categories, the average\nlevel of improvement shown for those who improved was\ndouble (or greater than double) that of non-lead participants.\nIn other categories, it was also significantly greater.\nConclusions and Future Work\nThis article has demonstrated the efficacy of using a small\nspacecraft development program to facilitate undergraduate\neducation, for a limited number of undergraduate student\nparticipants in the OpenOrbiter program. The results pre-\nsented cover the first academic year of OpenOrbiter opera-\ntions, following a thematically related predecessor program\n(which operated for approximately 6 months). It has been\nshown that participation in this program is generally effec-\ntive and that team leads enjoy greater levels of benefit than\nnon-lead participants. The extrapolation to other small space-\ncraft programs is limited due to programmatic differences\nand the small number of individuals sampled in this work.\nFuture work will include the completion of the OPEN designs\nand their implementation. Assessment activities are planned\nto continue (and be augmented) during this time and be\nextended to assess the benefits to students in multiple small\nspacecraft development programs.\n"
