    "abstract": "Abstract\nSelective exposure is a growing concern as people become more reliant on social media for political information. While\nself-reports often ask about exposure to political content on social media, existing research does not account for the\nfact that even those exposed to political content may still choose to ignore it. To effectively account for this, we employ\ncorneal eye tracking software, such that we can observe users' gaze and the amount of time they actually spend with\npolitical content. Consistent with expectations, the earlier a cue that a post is political, the faster a user skips over it.\nThis trend is concentrated among those least interested in politics. Implications for how we think about social media and\npolitical information flows in the modern media environment are discussed.\n",

This concern is built on two\nassumptions: first, that people do not want to see certain\ntypes of content (political content, partisan content from\nthe other side, etc.); and second, that people are able to\neffectively sort out less desired content from content they\nare more interested in or amenable to. While a great deal\nof evidence exists confirming the first assumption\nIn order to opt out of unwanted content, people have to\neffectively eliminate it from their attention in some way.\nThis can happen in terms of exposure--people can unfriend\nor unfollow types of information flows they dislike on\nsocial media (Bode, 2016a)--but it can also happen in less\nextreme ways. Rather than opting out of whole streams of\ninformation within social media, people can simply skip\nover content in their feed that they are not interested in\n(Thorson et al., 2014). This gets at the heart of selective\nattention--picking and choosing among the information to\nwhich you are exposed, choosing to pay attention to only\nsome types of content while ignoring others.\nWithin social media, political content is particularly\nlikely to be subject to these selective attention pressures.\nDespite scholars' interest in the democratic value of politi-\ncal content on social media, it tends to be a salient, disliked,\nand oft-avoided form of content (Bode, 2016a; Vraga et al.,\nselective attention on social media occurs.\nAs part of the process of selective attention, people\nshould respond to cues signaling the goal of the content\nbeing read. When those cues are prominent and easily\nunderstood--for example, featuring a political picture or a\npartisan word--users should be able to easily identify and\navoid content they do not like.\nOf course, selective attention is more difficult to study\nthan selective exposure. Exposure is often asked via self-\nharder to capture in this way. Attention is also more\nnuanced--people might start reading a particular post and\nstop only once they realize they are not interested. This\nwould still count as exposure, but the question of how much\nSkipping politics: Measuring avoidance\nof political content in social media\nLeticia Bode1, Emily K.

This\nstudy seeks to fill in this gap, to better understand how peo-\nple avoid political information on social media.\nTo do so, we expose individuals to a simulated Facebook\nfeed, comprising posts on a range of social, news, and polit-\nical topics. We then use eye tracking technology to observe\nhow much time they spend with different types of political\nposts and what encourages them to skip over political con-\ntent more or less quickly. This allows us to determine not\njust exposure to politics on social media, which is constant\nfor all of our subjects, but instead measure attention to such\ncontent, which varies by individual.\nLiterature review\nIn general, people just do not like politics (Eliasoph, 1998).\nAs a result, most people do not produce political content on\nsocial media (Duggan and Smith, 2016), and many report\ndisliking the presence of politics on social media (Vraga\net al., 2015b). However, they do see political content on\nsocial media from their friends even when they are not nec-\nessarily looking for it (Bode, 2016b; Duggan and Smith,\ngests such incidental exposure may not garner much atten-\ntion to political posts (Vraga et al., 2016b). This may result\nfrom individuals' motivation to avoid disliked content\nthey will be able to effectively ignore unpalatable political\ncontent on social media.\nBut what helps people realize that content is political? In\ngeneral, people use cues to stand in for more complicated\ninformation. Known as heuristics or information shortcuts,\nwhen considering politics or political candidates, these\ncues include economic conditions, partisan identification,\nony that is social media, cues should be even more impor-\ntant to direct individuals towards or away from certain\ntypes of content, depending on their interests.\nWe think there are three main cues that could alert read-\ners to the political-ness of content. First, there are political\nwords in each political post. Identifiers like political par-\nties, recognizable politicians, or political institutions should\noffer a red flag that the post is political. The earlier those\nwords occur, the more effectively users can skip over\nthem--therefore earlier political words should mean less\ntime spent with a post (H1A). Second, the more such words\noccur in a post, the more cues are available to a reader that\nthe content is political. This, too, then, should lead to the\nability to skip and therefore less time spent with the content\n(H1B). Finally, posts that include outside links also include\npictures. Some, but not all, of these pictures are identifiably\npolitical--most often showing a known political figure like\nJohn Boehner or Hillary Clinton. These pictures should\nalso serve as a cue that the post is political, and political\npictures should therefore lead to more skipping, or less time\nspent on the post (H1C).\nAdditionally, this desire to skip content should depend\non the extent to which people dislike the content. While\nmany people prefer to ignore politics, some are quite\ninterested in it (Zaller, 1992), and people are known to\ntailor their media choices to consume more politics if they\nare interested, and less politics if they are uninterested\n(Prior, 2007). For this reason, we expect that those lowest\nin political interest should be more sensitive to political\ncues and thus spend less time with political content when\nthese political cues (including first political word (A),\nnumber of political words (B), and presence of political\npictures (C)) are present (H2).\nFinally, we test whether the presence of political cues\nintersects with the tone taken in the political post. A long\nline of research has debated the benefits and drawbacks of\nnegative politics (see Lau and Rovner, 2009 for a sum-\nmary). While we cannot weigh in on every aspect of this\ndebate--we cannot say anything about its effects on turn-\nout, trust, etc.--we can test what draws attention. Because\nthe literature is mixed, we phrase this as a research ques-\ntion, asking whether people will spend more time on posi-\ntive or negative posts (RQ1), and whether this relationship\nwill be moderated by the placement and salience of politi-\ncal cues, such as the placement of the first political word\nin text, the number of political words in a post, or the\ninclusion of a political picture (RQ2).\nMethods\nTo answer these questions, we pair two methods: corneal\neye tracking and surveys.\nEye tracking\nEye tracking is a well-validated measure of attention to\ninsight into precisely when people turn their attention from\none post to another. This allows us to `watch' respondents'\nattentional patterns, without relying on unreliable self-\nreports of attention, which are often flawed through inac-\ncurate recall, unconscious processing, social desirability,\nand a tendency to rely on inferences of attention based on\nParticipants were allowed to scroll through 35 pages of\na simulated Facebook feed, consisting of 120 posts about\nnews, social or personal posts, and politics at their own\npace, and were encouraged to view the posts as if they were\nscrolling through their own Facebook News Feed (analysis\nis restricted to only those who had Facebook to ensure this\nexperience was as natural as possible)1. Two versions of the\ntask were used to guarantee that the same posts did not\nalways occur together, which could have influenced\nBode et al. 3\nattentional patterns (Pollatsek and Well, 1995), and the\norder of the 35 pages of posts was fully randomized.\nThe study began with a standard nine-point calibration,\npresented using Tobii Studio (Tobii Technology, Sweden).\nEye movement data were recorded at 60-Hz (that is, 60\ntimes per second) using a Tobii X60 (Tobii Technology,\nSweden) corneal reflection eye tracker, and stimuli were\npresented using Eprime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools,\nInc., Sharpsburg, PA), standard for the method. Visual\nattention to the stimuli was measured with tens of millisec-\nonds precision. To determine attention to each post, areas of\ninterest (AOIs) were established around each post using a\nrectangular drawing tool (essentially a rectangle is drawn\naround the outside of each post, allowing us to measure\nwhether any given gaze was directed at that area or at some\nSample\nThe sample of participants was recruited from fliers\nposted on campus and course instructor emails at a Mid-\nAtlantic university in the summer of 2014. Participants\ntook an online survey about social media habits and demo-\ngraphics, and then reported to the Psychology laboratory\nfor the eye tracking task (the average time between the\nsurvey and the eye-tracking task was 3.8 days, standard\ndeviation (SD) = 2.7). They then engaged in a liking task\n(viewing each post and indicating whether they liked or\ndisliked it) and completed a post-test survey.\n(SD = 5.22), 54% female, and more Democratic in their\nRepublican, which mirrors national samples of this age\ncohort).2 The 53 participants who had a Facebook account\nfemale; party affiliation 46% Democrat, 31% Independent,\n23% Republican) to the overall sample.\nPost creation\nPosts were created by researchers to resemble frequent top-\nics of posts on Facebook, including social posts, news posts,\nand political posts (Vraga, et al., 2016a). Posts were consist-\nently formatted to standard sizes, with two lines of text and\nblurred picture, user name, and time and date information to\nprevent these things from influencing respondents. Links\nconsisted of one line of text for the link title, with website\ninformation removed to ensure consistency.\nFor the analyses presented in this paper, only political\nposts are included--a total of 60 posts. To be political, a\npost had to mention political personalities or campaigns,\nusually mentioning prominent political figures (e.g. Barack\nObama, Hilary Clinton, John Boehner, and Chris Christie)\nor political parties (e.g. Republican, and Democrat) by\nname. Political posts were further subdivided into those\nfavoring Democrats, those favoring Republicans, and those\nfavoring neither side (e.g. neutral). Those favoring each\nparty were then subdivided into those that attacked the\nopposing party, and those that praised the favored party.\nAcross all of these categories, posts consisted of two stylis-\ntic types: statuses or links.\nAll posts were pre-tested to confirm they were catego-\nrized correctly by researchers, both in terms of their topic\nand political preference (that is, we pre-tested to ensure\nthat what we thought of as favoring Republicans was\nperceived that way by respondents as well). For more\ninformation on the creation and pre-testing of posts, see\nMeasures\nVisual attention.Throughout the eye tracking task, time\nspent looking at each individual post was recorded in mil-\nliseconds. This time per post was then divided by the total\ntime spent on the task to control for individual differences\nlike reading speed to compute a percentage score (this\ncould theoretically vary between 0 if a user spent no time\non the post and 100 if a user spent all their time during the\nPolitical cues. The presence of political cues is what should\nallow subjects to effectively identify political posts and\nskip over them if they are uninterested. Political words\ninclude references to political parties (Republican, Demo-\ncrat, Grand Old Party, etc.), references to well-known\npolitical figures (Hillary Clinton, John Boehner, Joe\nBiden, etc.), and references to political ideas (candidate,\nCongress, bipartisan, etc.). We measure political cues in\ntwo ways. First, we identify the location of the first politi-\ncal word that occurs in the post (word location, ranges\nnumber of political words that occur in the post (political\nassumption that more cues should serve as a greater heu-\nristic to the political-ness of the post. Finally, we analyze\nwhether a picture present in a link is political in nature\n(political picture, 17 of the 30 pictures included with\nlinks). Political pictures were identified by containing\nknown political symbols (donkey, elephant, and Capitol\nBuilding) or known political figures (Clinton, Boehner,\nand Biden). These are our key independent variables.\nLinks.Because previous work has shown that posts with\nlinks receive more compared to other types of posts, we\ninclude a dummy variable to control for whether a post was\nTotal words in post. Looking time is partly a function of\nthe length of a post, so we also control for the total\n4 Research and Politics \nnumber of words in a post (ranges from 13 to 37, M =\nPolitical interest. Because some of our analyses are split\nby high and low political interest, we created an item\nfrom a measure in the survey respondents completed\nseveral days before engaging in the eye tracking task,\nwhich asked how interested they were in politics on a\nseven-point scale, from \"not at all interested\" to \"very\nused to divide participants into low (1\u00ad2; 47.2%) versus\nPraise/attack.Two categories of partisan posts were cre-\nated: posts that praised one party or posts that criticized an\noppositional party. Therefore, posts that praised the Repub-\nlican Party or attacked the Democratic Party were coded as\n\"pro-Republican,\" while those that attacked Republicans or\npraised Democrats were coded as \"pro-Democrat.\" This\ncreated four categories of partisan posts, each of which\nAnalysis and results\nOur analyses begin by considering how long people spend\non posts, which we anticipated would depend on how\nquickly they can identify them as political. First, we esti-\nmate an ordinary least squares regression, with time spent\non the post as the dependent variable. The key variables\nare the location of the first political word--which is the\nfirst way in which subjects could determine a post was\npolitical--and the number of political words. We control\nfor whether the post was a link, as that includes more\ninformation (headline and picture), and how many total\nwords the post contained, since longer posts should gener-\nate more attention in general.\nAs can be seen in Table 1, our first hypothesis, which\npredicted that politically identifying words would result in\nshorter looking time, is partially supported. The further into\na post a political word arrives, the longer people spend\nlooking at it, supporting H1a. In contrast to H1b, however,\nthe number of political words do not seem to matter for\nattention, suggesting that people are relatively effective at\nidentifying a political post by its first political cue.\nThe third part of that hypothesis is that political pictures\nshould also serve as a cue to the political-ness of a post.\nBecause political pictures only occur within links, we\nrestrict our analysis to link posts only, and then estimate a\nsimilar model to that just described, but also including a\ndichotomous variable for whether or not the picture\nincluded is political (17 of the 30 pictures are identifiably\npolitical). Results of this model, shown in Table 2, must be\ninterpreted with caution due to the low sample size (n =\n30). Still, it does not seem that pictures are offering a mean-\ningful cue above and beyond the political words included in\nthe post, in contrast to H1c.\nOur second expectation was that this relationship should\nvary by political interest. To test this, we split our sample\ninto higher and lower political interest individuals, and then\nestimated the same model described above. As can be seen\nin Table 3, it does seem that the only people affected by\nword location are those lower in political interest.\nSpecifically, the earlier a political word appears in a post,\nthe less time low interest individuals spend on that post--\nbut this relationship is not significant for individuals who\nreport higher levels of political interest.\nFinally, we were interested in determining whether peo-\nple were better able to skip over posts that praised a politi-\ncal party or entity, or attacked it. To examine this, we\nestimate a separate model predicting time spent on a post,\nwith a variable indicating whether the post was attacking or\npraising a political entity, and an interaction between that\nvariable and the first political word location (and again\ncontrolling for whether the post was a link and how many\nwords it contained).As can be seen in Table 4, people spend\nmore time on posts that attack a political figure or idea, as\ncompared to those that praise, but that does not interact\nwith the first political word location. This suggests that\nattack posts garner more attention overall, but the location\nof the first political word does not influence this relation-\nship. This attention to political attack may partially explain\nthe success of fake partisan news on social media, which\nfrequently attack a political candidate (Silverman, 2016).\nDiscussion and conclusions\nThe findings of this study reinforce concerns about the\nextent to which people consume political content via\nTable 1. Ordinary least squares regression predicting time\nspent on posts.\n Standard error Significance\nTable 2. Ordinary least squares regression predicting time\nspent on posts (links only).\n Standard error Significance\nBode et al. 5\nsocial media. While people may have relatively centrist\nmedia diets in general (Guess, 2016), and regularly be\nexposed to political content posted by others on social\nmedia (Duggan and Smith, 2016), our findings suggest\nthat they are relatively efficient in identifying political\ncontent based on the first salient cue, and skipping over it\nif they are uninterested.\nIf people are adept at skipping over political content,\neven incidental exposure to political content (Bode, 2016b;\nKim, et al., 2013) is brought into question, since we cannot\nbe sure how much of the content is actually consumed by\nsocial media users. It further suggests that measuring the\nextent to which people are engaging in selective exposure on\nsocial media is more complicated than simply asking what\ntypes of content they see there. This reveals an area of confu-\nsion in the literature, when people often talk about selective\nexposure but really mean selective attention. As we have\nshown in previous research (Vraga et al., 2015a), attention is\noften the preferred concept and operationalization for some\nof these key questions in mass communication research.\nWe also show some evidence that people spend more\ntime with attack posts than praise posts \u00ad though this does\nnot interact with how quickly they are cued to the political-\nness of the post. Recent evidence shows that citizens and\nresearchers do not always agree on what constitutes nega-\ntivity (Mattes and Redlawsk, 2014), so future research\nshould examine different manifestations of negative con-\ntent to see if this effect depends on different types of nega-\ntivity. Both expertise (McClurg, 2006) and incivility (Mutz,\n2015), for example, may function differently than simple\ndisagreement with the other side. Due to our sample size,\nwe also cannot consider other factors that might affect\nattention to content and skipping speed. We encourage\nfuture research to examine the role of factors like partisan-\nship and gender in this area.\nThis also suggests practical implications for those look-\ning to share political information with others. Our results\ndo not discourage the use of political pictures associated\nwith links, which previous research has shown to be par-\nticularly engaging (Vraga et al., 2016b), but do suggest that\nthe longer one withholds the first clearly political word in a\npost, the more of that post will be consumed by otherwise\nuninterested readers.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by the George Mason University\nOffice of Research and Economic Development.\nNotes\n1. It is worth noting that because we limit our analysis to those\nthat had a Facebook account, we are only able to general-\nize to that population. These processes are likely differ-\nent for non-users of Facebook, partly by virtue of lack of\nfamiliarity with the platform, and partly in terms of a selec-\ntion bias--for example, those that opt out of the commonly\nused social media platform are more likely to be male, older,\nand wealthier (Greenwood et al., 2016). We believe study-\ning those familiar with the platform is an important first step\nin understanding attention patterns on Facebook, but future\nresearch should test the ability to \"skip\" politics across a\nrange of online and offline spaces.\n2.
