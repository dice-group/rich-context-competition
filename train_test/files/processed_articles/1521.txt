A nationally representative sample of 1216 adults (>20 years old) with diagnosed diabetes pro-\nvides population estimates for >12.6 million individuals. Nephropathy was defined as urinary albumin-\nto-creatinine ratio >30 mg/g in a random spot urine sample. Serum 25-hydroxycalciferol vitamin D\nlevels were characterized as <20 ng/mL vitamin D deficiency, 20 to 29 ng/mL vitamin D insufficiency,\nand >30 ng/mL normal vitamin D.\nResults: Overall, 30.7% of adults with diabetes have nephropathy, 48.9% have vitamin D deficiency\nand 36.6% have vitamin D insufficiency. Minorities are more likely to have nephropathy (non-Hispanic\nindividuals with nephropathy have vitamin D deficiency than individuals without nephropathy (53.2% vs\n47.0%; P  .03). Logistic regressions demonstrate vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are associated\nwith the presence of nephropathy after adjustment for race/ethnicity, age, sex, hypertension, high cho-\nlesterol, smoking status, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor\nConclusions: There is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in individuals with\ndiabetes; minorities have the highest prevalences. Thus, evaluating vitamin D levels in people with dia-\nbetes may be warranted. There is an independent association between vitamin D deficiency and vitamin\nD insufficiency with the presence of nephropathy, even after adjustment for race/ethnicity and other\nvariables. Further studies of this relationship may lead to new interventions that decrease health dis-\nBackground\nDiabetic nephropathy is a risk factor for cardiovas-\ncular disease and the leading cause of chronic kid-\nney disease in patients starting renal replacement\ntherapy.1 Racial and ethnic differences exist in the\nprevalence of diabetic nephropathy. A study evalu-\nating people with diabetes in the United States\nshows that non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics are\nless likely to have normal renal function than non-\nHispanic whites.2 Similarly, the incidence of re-\nported end-stage renal disease in people with dia-\nbetes is more than 4 times as high in African\nAmericans and 4 to 6 times as high in Mexican\nAmericans than in the general population of diabe-\ntes patients.3 These disparities exist despite similar\nproportions of blacks, whites, and Hispanics meet-\ning recommendations for glycolated hemoglobin\nand blood pressure control and similar proportions\nwith rennin-angiotensin system blockade via use of\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\nor angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs).2\nThus, reasons for the racial/ethnic disparities seen\nin diabetic nephropathy are unclear.\nA factor that may impact the differential devel-\nopment of diabetic nephropathy is vitamin D.

Therefore, this study will evalu-\nate the association between Vitamin D and diabetic\nnephropathy in a nationally representative sample\nof people with diabetes.\nMethods\nSurvey Description\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was an-\nalyzed. The NHANES is a product of the National\nCenter for Health Statistics. It is a continuous,\nannual survey involving participants from a nation-\nally representative sample of noninstitutional-\nized residents of the United States. Samples are\nweighted so they are representative of the US pop-\nulation. Sampling weights are calculated by taking\ninto account unequal probabilities of selection\ncaused by sample design, nonresponse and planned\nover-sampling of minorities, and then matched to\npopulation control totals known to be representa-\ntive of the US population. This allows for the\ncalculation of population estimates for the United\nStates.13 The NHANES includes a detailed house-\nhold interview and physical examination plus labo-\nratory information obtained through mobile exam-\nination centers. Data are collected throughout the\nyear across designated data collection communities\nin the United States. To protect the anonymity of\nthe respondents, the month of data collection and\nthe specific community of origin of the respondent\nis not released to the public. The reported investi-\ngations have been conducted in accordance with\nthe principles of the Declaration of Helsinki as\nSample\nAdults (20 years of age) who reported a diagnosis\nof diabetes by answering yes to the question,\n\"Other than during pregnancy, have you ever been\ntold by a doctor or health professional that you\nhave diabetes or sugar diabetes?\" were included in\nthis sample. Participants self-identified as non-His-\npanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Hispanic. Be-\ncause of the small size and heterogeneity of the\n\"Other\" racial category, this group was not ana-\nlyzed.\nDefinition of Diabetic Nephropathy\nConsistent with American Diabetes Association\nguidelines, albumin and creatinine were measured\nin a random spot urine sample.14 These measure-\nments were used to calculate the urinary albumin-\nto-creatinine ratio. Values of 30 mg/g were char-\nacterized as being normal, whereas values 30\nmg/g describe either microalbuminuria or mac-\nroalbuminuria.14 Thus, in this study, nephropathy\nwas defined as a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio\nDefinition of Vitamin D Deficiency and Vitamin D\nInsufficiency\nVitamin D status in the serum is evaluated based on\nthe Diasorin 25-OH-D assay, which measures 25-\nOH-D. This is the predominant circulating form of\nvitamin D in the normal population and is the most\ncommonly used to determine vitamin D status.4,5\nAlthough there is no consensus on optimal levels of\n25-OH-D, data suggests that levels 30 ng/mL\ncan be considered an indication of sufficient vita-\nmin D.4 Thus, individuals with 25-OH-D levels\nized having vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D\ninsufficiency, respectively. This is consistent with\nrecommendations from the National Kidney Foun-\nMedication Use\nParticipants were asked to present the containers\nfor all the prescription medications taken during\nthe past month and to report any medications taken\nfor which the container was not available. These\nmedications were then matched by trained survey\ninterviewers to an annually updated comprehensive\ndatabase of all prescription drugs in the US market.\nProducts not matched to the drug database were\nedited after data collection at the National Center\nfor Health Statistics, where quality control activi-\nties resulted in 1% of medications being listed as\nunknown. All reported medication names were\nconverted to their standard generic ingredient\nname for data release.15,16 These generic names\nwere used to identify medications as ACE inhibi-\ntors or ARBs. Use of these medications was in-\ncluded in addition to the diagnosis of hypertension\nbecause data suggests that they provide benefits\nbeyond their effect on blood pressure in the pre-\nvention and delay of diabetic kidney disease.17,18\nDefinitions of Disease\nHypertension was assessed by self-report. Individ-\nuals who reported ever being told they had hyper-\ntension or high blood pressure were classified as\nhaving hypertension. Having diagnosed high cho-\nlesterol was defined based on the question, \"Have\nyou ever been told by a doctor or other health\nprofessional that your blood cholesterol level was\nhigh?\" Individuals answering \"No\" or \"I don't\nknow\" or who stated they had not had their cho-\nlesterol checked were characterized as not having a\ndiagnosis of high cholesterol. Hypertension and\nhigh cholesterol were assessed as possible con-\nfounding variables because dyslipidemia and hyper-\ntension are established risk factors for diabetic ne-\nphropathy.1 Obesity was based on body mass index\n(BMI), calculated using measured weight and\nheight (kg/m2). BMI categories were consistent\nwith 1998 National Heart, Lung and Blood Insti-\ntute guidelines, which classify obesity as a BMI of\nSmoking Status\nSmoking has been demonstrated to be a putative\nrisk factor for diabetic nephropathy.19,20 Smoking\nstatus was assessed using 2 questions to characterize\nindividuals as never, former, or current smokers.\nCurrent cigarette smoking was defined as answer-\ning \"Yes\" to the question, \"Have you smoked at\nleast 100 cigarettes in your entire life?\" and answer-\ning \"Everday\" or \"Some days\" to the question, \"Do\nyou now smoke cigarettes?\" Individuals who an-\nswered \"Yes\"' to the first question and answered\n\"Not at all\" to the second question were defined as\nbeing a former smoker. Those answering \"No\" to\nboth questions were defined as never smoking.\nAnalysis\nstratified cluster sample, standard statistical tech-\nniques could not be used. Therefore, we used\nSUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle, NC), a specialized statistical program\nthat accounts for the complex weighting of the\nNHANES sample. Using SUDAAN allowed us to\ncorrect for unequal probabilities of selection and\ndifferent response rates, ensuring that the results\ncould be generalized to the noninstitutionalized\ncivilian population of the United States. Thus the\npercentages and odds ratios in this study repre-\nsented weighted values. SUDAAN also adjusts the\nstandard errors to account for the weighting, strat-\nification, and clustering of the complex sampling\ndesign to ensure that expressed P is valid. The\nprevalences of demographic and disease character-\nistics were assessed within the overall population\nand also by race/ethnicity, where they were com-\npared using 2 tests. Similarly, the prevalences of\nthese characteristics were also assessed and com-\npared in those with and without nephropathy. Lo-\ngistic regressions were used to determine the inde-\npendent relationship between vitamin D status and\ndiabetic nephropathy. An unadjusted regression\nwas computed initially. Regressions adjusting for\nrace/ethnicity, age, sex, and for these demographic\nvariables in addition to other predictor variables\nwere also computed. The other predictor variables\nevaluated were hypertension, high cholesterol,\nsmoking status, obesity, and use of an ACE inhib-\nitor or ARB. P  .05 was determined to be signif-\nicant.\nResults\nThe inclusion criteria for this study provided an\nunweighted sample size of 1216, which could be\nused to provide population estimates for more than\nticipants had vitamin D deficiency (20 ng/mL)\nand 36.6% of the participants had vitamin D insuf-\nficiency. The mean vitamin D concentration in our\nmographic and disease characteristics for adults\nwith diabetes by race/ethnicity are presented in\nTable 1. Differences in age and sex exist by race/\nethnicity, with non-Hispanic whites being older\nand a higher proportion of non-Hispanic blacks\nbeing women. Minorities had a higher proportion\nof individuals with nephropathy and were more\nlikely to have vitamin D deficiency. In fact, 80% of\nnon-Hispanic blacks and 59% of Hispanics with\ndiabetes exhibited vitamin D deficiency.\nAs seen in Table 2, higher proportions of indi-\nviduals with nephropathy had vitamin D deficiency\nversus individuals without nephropathy. Table 3\npresents results from logistic regressions, which\ndemonstrate that this relationship remains even af-\nter controlling for demographic variables such as\nrace/ethnicity, age, and sex as well as other vari-\nables. The odds ratios for the unadjusted and ad-\njusted relationships remained similar, demonstrat-\ning the independent nature of the relationship\nbetween low levels of serum vitamin D and the\npresence of nephropathy. We also tested the rela-\ntionship between urinary albumin-to-creatinine ra-\ntio and vitamin D (both continuous) in linear re-\ngressions. The unadjusted  for vitamin D was\nicant at P  .01.

Furthermore, this association re-\nmains despite adjusting for race/ethnicity, the pres-\nence of hypertension, and medication use as well as\nother factors, demonstrating a robust relationship.\nThis is one of the first studies in humans showing\nthis association.

Previous studies suggest that the re-\nlationship between these 2 variables is such that\nboth of these interactions may be occurring simul-\ntaneously. This study evaluates 25-OH-D, the cir-\nculating metabolite produced in the liver that is\nBased on this well-established pathway, renal insuf-\nficiency could not be the reason for the low levels of\n25-OH-D seen in study. This suggests that studies\nto further describe the role of vitamin D as a pos-\nsible risk marker or risk factor in diabetic nephrop-\nathy are needed to evaluate the impact of maintain-\ning an adequate level of vitamin D on the\nprogression of diabetic nephropathy. Studies dem-\nonstrating a benefit to vitamin D supplementation\nfor total mortality suggest that this may be a strat-\negy to consider in future studies.21 Further studies\nshould also evaluate the value of vitamin D as an\nindependent predictor of the progression of ne-\nphropathy as compared with other possible predic-\ntors.\nThis study also described the high prevalence of\nvitamin D deficiency in patients with diabetes, re-\ngardless of their kidney function. This finding\nhighlights the need to improve screening for vita-\nmin D deficiency in patients with diabetes, espe-\ncially minority populations, because vitamin D is\nknown to have a role in decreasing the risk of many\nchronic illnesses, including cancer, cardiovascular\ndisease, and infectious diseases.10 This is especially\npertinent for individuals with diabetes, who are at a\nhigher risk of developing these conditions than the\ngeneral population and thus may receive a greater\nbenefit from having higher vitamin D levels.22\u00ad24\nThere are limitations to this study that should be\nconsidered. As previously mentioned, the cross-\nsectional nature of the data limited inference and\nonly allowed for the identification of associations.\nWe were only able to measure 25-OH-D in this\nstudy, which did not allow us to evaluate the role of\nthe kidney in metabolizing this form of vitamin D\nto the biologically active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D3.\nThis is an accepted approach to the evaluation of\nvitamin D status because only a small amount of\n25-OH-D is metabolized in the kidney.4,5 We were\nunable to identify the month of the year in which\nrespondents participated in the examination be-\ncause of confidentiality issues in the NHANES.\nHowever, NHANES data are collected throughout\nthe year and across the country so we would not\nexpect a bias in racial data collection during specific\nseasons of the year. Finally, there was no consensus\non the level of 25-OH-D that denotes insuffi-\nciency. Thus, analyses were also performed evalu-\nating another commonly used threshold (32 ng/\nml), and these yielded similar results.25\nConclusion\nThis study demonstrated an association between\nvitamin D deficiency and vitamin D insufficiency\nwith nephropathy in individuals with diabetes even\nafter controlling for factors such as race/ethnicity\nand the presence of hypertension and use of ACE\ninhibitors or ARBs. The high prevalence of vitamin\nD deficiency and vitamin D insufficiency in indi-\nviduals with diabetes, especially in minorities, sug-\ngest that further study of this relationship may lead\nto new interventions to delay the progression of\ndiabetic nephropathy.\nReferences\n1.
