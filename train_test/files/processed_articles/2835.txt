Introduction\nThe determinants of firms' investment spending have been the focus of academic research\nfor several decades. Improving the foundations of investment theory as well as the policy\nimplications is a most interesting objective. Investment spending is known to be very\nvolatile and therefore one of the driving forces of macroeconomic activity.\nIn empirical research on investment several approaches have been used (see for an\nQ models of investment are attractive in several respects. Theoretically the Q-model can be\nderived explicitly from an optimization problem which the firm faces when deciding about\nnew investments.2 Under quite strong assumptions, a linear relationship can be derived\nbetween the ratio of investment to the capital stock and a measure of Q. Theoretically Q is\na sufficient statistic for determining the investment decision if the capital market is\nWhen using balance sheet data for an empirical analysis of firms' investment decisions\nresearchers face the problem of non-adequate concepts for several variables. The\nmeasurement concepts underlying the balance sheet data often do not match the economic\nmeaning that interests the researcher. One of the key variables which has attracted much\ndetailed research is firms' net capital stock at replacement costs. The challenge is to\ntransform historical cost data depreciated at non-economic, tax-oriented depreciation rates\ninto unreported and probably unknown economically meaningful data at actual\nreplacement values. First of all, therefore, we use a complex procedure for calculating\nreliable replacement values of a firm's capital stock.4\nThe second problem is that no stock prices are available for non-quoted firms, which\nmakes it impossible to follow the usual approach when applying the Q-theory of using\nstock market data to calculate the market value of equity. The problem is circumvented by\nusing a vector-autoregressive approach (VAR) for panel data to estimate the present\nvalues of the future returns on capital in order to calculate Q. This direct forecasting\napproach, as Chirinko (1993) named it, is based on a VAR forecasting model and was first\nsuggested by Abel and Blanchard (1986) for aggregate times series. This approach was\nextended in the context of the Q-theory by Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995, 1998) to panel\n* We would like to thank Heinz Herrmann for his support and helpful comments.\n1 In the following we use the upper case symbol Q throughout the text indicating all different measures,\nwhether they are based on share prices or on values gained by direct forecasting systems.\n2 Von Kalckreuth (2001) analysed investment behaviour in Germany on the basis of an implicit (user\ncost) model with the same data set used in this paper.\n3 But see Caballero/Leahy (1996) for the case of fixed costs of capital stock adjustment.\n4 See Hayashi (1997) for a discussion of the biases resulting from the use on non-adequate measures of\nthe capital stock.\ndata. The advantage of this direct forecasting approach is that it enables the Q-theory to be\napplied to non-quoted firms as well.\nIn our study we follow two different operationalisation strategies. First we estimate an\naverage Q comparable to Tobin's Q by forecasting future profits using a VAR-model along\nthe lines of Abel and Blanchard. Second, we estimate marginal Q following the approach\nsuggested by Gilchrist and Himmelberg, which is based on a restrictive formulation of the\nunderlying production process.\nThe results show a very strong influence of the calculated average as well as marginal Q on\ninvestment for a large panel of German firms. Therefore, we find that the Q-theory is well\nsuited for application to non-quoted firms on the basis of balance sheet data using a direct\nforecasting approach.\n2. Theoretical considerations\nThe economic models of business fixed investment can broadly be classified into two\nclasses of models.5 The distinguishing feature is whether or not the models explicitly take\naccount of the process of adjustment of the capital stock. In both classes of models the\noptimal level of the firms capital stock results as the solution of the profit maximization\nproblem. But where the class of older models (Jorgensen (1963, 1971)) does not explain\nthe optimal path of adjustment of the actual capital stock to the optimal one, the second\nclass of models explicitly derives the optimal evolution of the capital stock from the\nunderlying optimization problem. The difference therefore can be seen in the step from the\nstatic problem of optimal factor demand to dynamic investment models. This step can be\nperformed either by ad hoc specifications or by an explicit derivation of the adjustment\npath undertaken in the investment models based on the Q-theory .\nNaturally, this advantage is achieved by making strong assumption about the costs of\nadjusting the capital stock, which leads to a rationalization of the observed slow\nadjustment. In most cases the costs of adjustment are assumed to be strictly convex in the\namount of investment what implies increasing marginal costs. Therefore deviations\nbetween the actual and the optimal capital stock will be reduced through a sequence of\nsmaller investments rather than through a one-time large change in the capital stock. The\ncosts of adjustment can be thought of as installation costs or costs caused by the\ndisruptions of the production process when new investment is undertaken.\nIn the following the Q-model including an explicit formulation of the adjustment costs is\nillustrated. In the basic Q-model the firm faces the following maximization problem:\n\n=\n\n=\n+\n+\n|\nj\nt\nj\nt\nj\nt\nt E\nV \nThe firm is assumed to maximize the expected value of the sum of discounted profits t\n\ngiven the state of information  at time t.\nThe discount factor between period t and period t + j is denoted by j\nt+\n and is assumed to\nbe the product of the single-period discount rates:\n( )\n\n=\n-\n+\n+ +\n=\nj\ni\ni\nt\nj\nt r\nThe profit t\n is the difference between sales and costs of production taking into account\nthe adjustment costs and the cost of investment:\n( ) ( )\n[ ]\nt\nI\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt I\np\nL\nw\nK\nI\nG\nL\nK\nF\np -\n-\n-\n= ,\n,\n\nThe output is given by the amount of production F minus the lost output G caused by\nadjusting the capital stock. The firm is assumed to be producing on the basis of the given\ncapital stock Kt while other factors of production Lt, mainly labour, are assumed to be\nadjusted instantaneously. The function of adjustment cost G is assumed to be strictly\nconvex in investment and to be additively separable from the gross production function.\nIf asset markets are efficient in the sense that assets are valued at the expected present\nvalue of the associated income streams, then the value of the firm's capital stock Vt is the\nstock market value of the firm when abstracting from other assets beside the capital stock.\nThe maximization problem the firm faces can therefore be expressed as a dynamic\nprogramming problem.\nUsing the first-order derivatives of the maximization problem it can be shown that, in\nequilibrium, the ratio of the shadow value to the replacement cost (which includes the\nadjustment costs) of an additional unit of capital should be one.\nAssuming that markets are competitive, the firm is a price taker in all markets, and the\nratio of the shadow value of capital in period t to the price of a unit of investment is known\nas marginal Q.\nTo derive a linear relation between marginal Q and investment, some rather restrictive\nassumptions have to be made concerning the adjustment cost function. If a quadratic\nadjustment cost function is assumed for mathematical convenience (Summers 1981), it can\nbe shown that marginal adjustment costs increase linearly with the rate of investment and\nthat the rate of investment is a linear function of marginal Q.\nSo far only marginal Q has been analysed. Following Hayashi (1982) it is also possible to\nderive a linear relation between average Q and investment. To derive a simple relation\nbetween marginal Q and average Q it is necessary to assume, besides perfect capital and\nproduct markets, that the production function ( )\nt\nt L\nK\nF , and the adjustment cost function\n( )\nt\nt K\nI\nG , are homogeneous of degree one in their arguments. In other words, it is assumed\nthat the production function has constant returns to scale.\n3. The data source\nThe empirical analysis is based on the Deutsche Bundesbank' corporate balance sheet\nrepresent about 4% of the total number of enterprises in Germany. In the context of its\nrediscount lending operations the Bundesbank collects the financial statements of firms\nusing trade bills to assess the creditworthiness of bill-presenting firm.7\nBecause the sample is biased towards larger enterprises, it covers about 75% of the total\nturn-over of the corporate sector in western Germany. The period covered by our sample is\nStarting with a very large data set the number of observations decreases considerably\nthrough incomplete balance sheets, outlier control and balancing. In particular, the need to\nuse the detailed schedule of fixed asset movements (Anlagespiegel) in order to apply our\nalgorithm for calculating the capital stock at replacement costs shrinks the available data to\nThe theoretical concept of the Q-theory of investment is microeconomic. Hence the use of\nfirm-level data seems the natural way to apply an empirical test of the theory. But using\nindividual balance sheet accounts has some caveats: the sample is not random and the data\ninclude noise from individual irregularities. Nevertheless, the theory seems to be better\napplicable to individual firm data. What leads to severe problems in using the balance\nsheet for economic analysis is the fact that the majority of the data (85%) is based on tax\nbalance sheets. Therefore, the figures represented in the balance sheets accord with the\nlegal descriptions as defined in tax law and differ from the theoretical concepts in several\nways.9 To overcome these problems as far as possible, great efforts are made in the\nmeasurement procedures; they are described in the following sections.\n4. The capital stock at replacement costs: A new algorithm\nThe most prominent approaches for this transformation are the ones proposed by\nLindenberg/Ross (1981), the NBER-approach (Hall et.al. (1988)) and the algorithm\nsuggested by Lewellen/Badrinath (1997). In this paper we suggest an alternative algorithm\nwhich, according to our understanding and the results of a comparison based on Monte\nCarlo simulations, is almost comparable to the precise results of the algorithm by Lewellen\nand Badrinath but has considerable lower data requirements.\n6 For an overview of empirical work based on this data base see St\u00f6ss (2001).\n8 For details about the data source and cleaning procedures see the appendix.\nIn the following section we sketch the aforementioned approaches and try to show the core\nidea as well as the data requirements for the implementation, before we present our own\napproach. The next section contains a Monte Carlo simulation intended to compare the\noutcomes of the different approaches with our own suggested algorithm.\n4.1. A short review of the literature\nThe algorithm by Lindenberg and Ross starts from year t = 1 where the book value at\nhistorical costs less accumulated depreciation is taken as an approximation for the\nunknown net capital stock at replacement values. At the beginning of period t = 1 we have\n(in the following K* denotes capital stock at replacement costs while K denotes the book\nvalue)\nt\nt K\nK =\n* .\nIn the following periods the capital stock is updated taking into account the depreciation\nrate ( , book rate), price changes (i) and the technical process ( ) as well as gross\ninvestment (It):\nt\nt\nt I\ni\nK\nK +\n+\n-\n+\n= -\n)\n(\n)\n)(\n(\n*\n*\n\n\n.\nThe capital stock contains fixed assets as well as inventories. The procedure described\nabove is applied to fixed assets. With respect to inventories two cases are distinguished:\n- When using FIFO (First-In-First-Out) the valuation of the stock is rather close to\nreplacement costs and the book values remain unadjusted.\n- When using LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) greater discrepancies will occur. In this case the\nbook values of inventories will be adjusted using a procedure close to the one described\nabove and the parameter settings 0\n=\n=\n .\nWhile inventories are treated with a technique similar to the approach of Lindenberg and\nRoss the NBER-approach adjusts the book value of fixed assets for price changes. Central\nto the algorithm is the assumption about the average age a of the existing capital stock.\nThus if a =4, the adjustment of the book value takes into account the price changes of\ncapital goods,  , for the last 4 years. In general the estimated capital stock in period t is\ngiven by\n\n=\n+\n-\n+\n=\na\nj\nj\nt\nt\nt K\nK\n* )\n(  .\nIt is evident that the quality of the estimation hinges on the correctness of a .

The basic idea is to disaggregate the actual capital stock into\nthe years of purchase in the first step and the price adjustment for the different vintages in\nthe second step. Like the a in the NBER-approach, this approach contains a magical\nnumber as well. This time the key number for the quality of the procedure's results is the\nlongest lifetime of capital goods n\n~ . Assuming that number is correct, the actual capital\nstock contains investment goods of the last n\n~ vintages It:\n=\n-\n-\n=\n)\n~\n(n\nt\nt\ng\nt I\nK\n\n .\nTo estimate n\n~ we start with 1\n~ =\nn and increase n\n~ until the following inequality holds:\n<\n\n-\n=\n-\n-\n=\nn\nt\nt\ng\nt\nn\nt\nt\nI\nK\nI\n~\n)\n~\n(\n\n\n\n .\nIf\ng\nt\nn\nt\nt\nK\nI <\n-\n-\n=\n)\n~\n(\n\n ,\nthe difference between cumulative investment and the gross capital stock at historical costs\n)\n~\n(\n>\n-\n-\n-\n=\nn\nt\nt\ng\nt I\nK\n\n\nis added to the oldest still-living vintage of investment.\nNow we are interested in the share \ng\n~ of the vintage \nI that is still contained (not fully\ndepreciated) in period t. Given the period of purchase  under the assumption of linear\ndepreciation for n\n~ periods, the still-living share of the vintage is given as\nn\nt\nn\ng ~\n)\n(\n~\n~ -\n-\n-\n=\n\n , t\nn\nt ...,\n,\n~ +\n-\n=\n .\nSumming the parts, the replacement value of the net capital stock for period t (starting\npoint) can be estimated as:\n-\n-\n=\n=\n)\n~\n(\n* ~\nn\nt\nt\nt\nt P\nP\ng\nI\nK\n \n\n .\nAdjustment routines\nThe algorithm leads to estimates of cumulative depreciations of the capital goods which\nare still contained in the capital stock. These estimates *\nt\nDK might differ from the book\nvalues of cumulative depreciations t\nDK . This possible discrepancy will be eliminated via\nthe following adjustment routine.\nThe estimates of cumulative depreciations of still-living capital goods are given by\n)\n~\n(\n)\n~\n(\n*\n\n\n g\nI\nDK\nn\nt\nt\nt\n-\n=\n-\n-\n=\n.\nThese estimates are contrasted with the book value of cumulative depreciations of still-\nliving goods:\nt\ng\nt\nt K\nK\nDK -\n= .\nIf we have\n*\nt\nt DK\nDK > ,\nthe difference\n*\nt\nt DK\nDK - ,\nwill be added to the oldest vintage still living .\nIf we have\n*\nt\nt DK\nDK < ,\nall estimated depreciations will be adjusted (diminished) by the following ratio:\n*\nt\nt\nDK\nDK\n.\nThis adjustment routine guarantees the equality of estimated and balance sheet data for the\nnet capital stock at historical costs.\nThe Lindenberg-Ross-approach is rather simple and easy to implement. But it is obvious\nthat the quality of the estimated capital stock at actual prices will increase over time. The\nquality of the initial estimate will be rather poor owing to overly fast depreciation of book\nvalues because of tax considerations and the neglecting of capital goods price changes. The\nupdating of the capital stock might also be biased because book depreciation rates probably\noverstate economic depreciation rates. Our own empirical estimates will show that initially\nthe book value amounts on average to only 40% of the economically meaningful\nreplacement value.10\nAs in the approach taken by Lindenberg and Ross, in the NBER-approach it is assumed\nthat book depreciations equal economic depreciations. Especially for German accounting\ndata, there will be major discrepancies because in general the tax-oriented depreciation\nrates will exceed the economic rates. The calculations of average age and average lifetime\nignore the fact that the stock of fixed assets in a period t is a composition of several\ninvestment vintages.\nThe approach taken by Lewellen and Badrinath is by far the most complex of the three\ndiscussed. By taking into account the age structure of the still-living capital stock, the price\n10 One solution often applied in empirical work is to leave out several years at the beginning of the\nperiod covered. While that avoids using the worst estimates at the beginning of the estimation period,\nthere will still be a strongly decreasing measurement error over time.\nadjustment can be expected to be rather precise. The main disadvantage of this approach\ncan be seen in the rather high data requirements. To estimate the capital stock for period t\nthe investment data for the n\n~ -1 years preceding year t have to be given. Taking into\nconsideration the rather long lifetime of structures, this data requirements will hardly ever\nbe met when working with micro balance sheet data. Finally, the assumption of an equal\nlifetime of all capital goods seems to be rather oversimplifying.\n4.2. A new algorithm\nThe basic idea of the new algorithm which we propose is to split the actual capital stock\ninto two additive components. The first component contains the vintages which are still\nalive and already belonged to the capital stock at the beginning of the first year in the data\nset. We will add the subscript \"old\" to indicate this component. (In our data set this was the\nyear 1987.) The second component consists of the capital goods which were acquired\nduring the years covered by the data set and still belong to the capital stock. This\ncomponent will be indicated by the subscript \"new\". For these two components we apply\ndifferent adjustment procedures to transform the book values at historical costs and tax-\ndriven depreciations into economically meaningful net capital stock figures at replacement\ncosts. The final estimate of the capital stock will therefore be\n*\n*\n,\n*\nnew,t\nt\nold\nt K\nK\nK +\n= .\nLet us first consider the \"new\" component. For this component the investment at actual\nprices for period t is covered in the available data set. Each vintage leaves the capital stock\naccording to the retirement function commonly employed in the classical perpetual-\ninventory procedure. In addition, each year the capital stock is revalued so as to take\naccount of the price development of capital goods.\nNow let us look at the \"old\" part of the capital stock. The crucial point is to disaggregate\nthe existing capital stock at the beginning of the first year covered by the data set t0 into its\nvintages. If this is achieved in a plausible way, each vintage leaves the capital stock in line\nwith the retirement function in the same way as the vintages of the \"new\" capital stock.\nBesides this disaggregation into the different vintages, a second disaggregation is the\nimportant separation into structures and equipment. These two components are\ncharacterized by very different life-times which are associated with very different\ndepreciations as well as different price changes.\nAs the depreciations given in the balance sheet data are mainly driven by tax\nconsiderations, their use would lead to a severe underestimation of the life time of capital\ngoods. Therefore we use sectoral data for depreciation rates and capital goods' lifetimes\nwhich we assume will be closer to economic reality. Since the data set does not contain\nany price information, we also use sectoral price data. Both sectoral data sets are\ndisaggregated into structures and equipment. The inventories are not revalued. Given that\nmost firms employ the First-In-First-Out valuation scheme, we take the book values as\nbeeing sufficiently close to replacement values. In this case (FIFO) there will only be\nminor differences between book values and replacement values. In the next section of the\npaper we will formalize the algorithm and present further details.\n4.2.2. The disaggregation of the first period's capital stock into different vintages\nThe detailed schedule of fixed asset movements (Anlagenspiegel) contains information\nconcerning the sum of all past investment still in stock at historical costs (gross capital\nstock at historical costs, g\nt\nK ).\nDisaggregation into structures and equipment\nIn our starting period t0 we disaggregate the value of the capital stock ( g\nt\nK\n) into structures\nand equipment based on the respective shares of structures and equipment in the balance\nsheets:\n,\nj\nt\ng\nt\nj\ng\nt K\nK\nK\nK \n= , j=1,2 (structures, equipment),\nwith:\nj\ng\nt\nK ,\naccumulated still-living investment at historical costs, typ j\ng\nt\nK\naccumulated still-living investment at historical costs (Anlagenspiegel), aggregate\nj\nt\nK\nnet capital stock at historical costs (balance sheet), typ j\nt\nK net capital stock at historical costs (balance sheet), aggregate\nIn the following all calculations are performed at the disaggregated level for structures and\nequipment separately. To improve readability we leave out the subscript j.\nSectoral adjustment in year t0\nWe do not make the counterfactual assumption of equality between historical cost data and\nactual replacement values. This procedure would lead to a severe underestimation of the\nnet capital stock at actual replacement values. Instead we use sectoral data supplied by the\nFederal Statistical Office (Statistisches Bundesamt) to adjust for the discrepancies\nstemming from the different depreciation methods and price schemes.\nThe starting point is the firm level balance sheet value adjusted for the sectoral ratio for\ns\nh\ng\nt\ns\nr\nt\ng\nt\nt\nK\nK\nK\nK\n,\n,\n,\n*\n\n= ,\ns\nh\ng\nt\nK ,\n,\ngross capital stock at historical costs in sector s,\ns\nr\nt\nK ,\nnet capital stock at replacement values in sector s\nadjustment takes into account the different price scheme as well as the difference between\ngross and net capital stock. It is obvious that the adjusted values in the initial year t0 will be\nthe closer to the true value the more the structure of firm i's capital stock resembles the\nstructure of the capital stock in sector s in terms of both goods and age.\n4.2.3. The retirement of the investment vintages\nWe disaggregate a vintage t into parts of different lifetime n. n denotes the part of a\nvintage with lifetime n (it retires after being n years in stock) and N is the maximum\nlifetime. In the course of its maximum lifetime N the vintage will retire completely.\nTherefore we have\n=\n=\nN\nn\nn\n\nand\n=\n=\nN\nn\nn\nt\nt I\nI\n .\nFor determining the retirement ratios n we use the gamma function, which is also used by\nthe Federal Statistical Office:\nn\nn\nn e\nn\nn\nn\nn\n\n-\n\n\n\n=\n=\n!\n)\n,\n(\n\n .\nThis gamma function tells us which part of a fixed asset with average lifetime n retires at\nthe age of n years.\nFigure 1: The retirement function for average lifetimes of 5 and 10 years\n n\nn\nyears\n=\nn\nyears\n=\nn\nFor the individual firm i the average lifetime n of the sector the firm belongs to is used.11\nIt is It is worth noting at this point that average lifetimes for structures and equipment\ndiffer considerably.

Disaggregation of the capital stock at the beginning of the initial year into its\nvintages and retirements\nThe initial estimate of the capital stock is disaggregated into its vintages of investment\nseparately for structures and equipment. To achieve this disaggregation several\nassumptions are necessary:\n- the retirement function is stable over time,\n- investment in the prior years has taken place evenly,\n- the capital goods depreciate linearly over time.\nThese assumptions imply:\n- what shares of investment vintages still belong to the capital stock, and\n- the average lifetime of the vintages.\nLet us denote the oldest vintage still belonging to the capital stock with 0. Then summing\nthe depreciations and taking into account the price adjustment 1\n/ -\nt\nt P\nP we obtain the\nreplacement value less depreciation of the capital goods still living in year t0 at the end of\nyear t:\n,\n*\n,\n*\n,\n-\n-\n-\n=\n- -\n=\nt\nt\nt\nN\nt\nold\nt\nt\nold\nt\nold P\nP\nDK\nK\nK\n\n .\nThe calculation of the depreciations\nThe counterpart to the retirement function is the survival function.

A comparison of the different approaches\nIn this section of the paper we run a Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the performance of\nthe algorithms by Lindenberg/Ross, the NBER approach, the algorithm proposed by\nLewellen/Badrinath and our own proposed alternative algorithm.\n- The average lifetime n of fixed assets is 10 years, evenly distributed between 5 and 15\nyears.\n- Each firm has a specific average lifetime i\nn of its fixed assets and a specific retirement\nfunction.\n- The retirement rates in\n of fixed assets with lifetimes n = 5, 6, ..., 15 for firm i are\ndrawn at random. They will be held constant over the whole simulation period. The\naverage lifetime of the firms fixed assets is then given by\n\n=\n=\nn\nin\ni n\nn  .\n- We set book depreciations equal to economic depreciations, so there is no need to\ncorrect non-economic, tax-oriented depreciations. (Note that this assumption has to be\nmade in the approaches by L/R, NBER and L/W, while in our algorithm we make use\nof an adjustment procedure in the initial year to correct for differences and apply an\neconomic meaningful linear depreciation scheme.)\nA.

Random draws from the empirical data (Bilanzstatistik/VGR)\nAccording to this procedure, the true capital stock at replacement values is generated for a\nperiod of 70 years. We assume that the data available to the researcher start at period 21\nFigure 2: Distribution of errors for the different algorithms (estimation period 30 to 50,\nscenario A scenario B\nerror in %\nour approach\nNBER\nerror in %\nour approach\nNBER\nNotes: L/R = Lindenberg and Ross, L/B = Lewellen/Badrinath. We use kernel-density estimates (triangular\nkernel, bandwidth 1 %).\nIt can be seen from the simulation results that the algorithm we propose performs rather\nwell. The results show that our algorithm is outperformed by the algorithm suggested by\nLewellen/Baldrinath. But it should be remembered that their approach requires investment\nto be known at least 10 years before the first capital stock can be calculated. Therefore\ntheir approach, even having the smallest error, cannot be applied in most empirical cases.\nComparing the algorithm which we propose with the two approaches having similar data\nrequirements, we find that the errors for the new algorithm are rather small.\n4.4. Estimates of the capital stock\n4.4.1. The capital stock at replacement costs for the Bundesbank data file\nIf we summarize the results, we find that the ratio of the capital stock at replacement costs\nto balance sheet values at historical costs is on average 2.5. There is a strong increase in\nfollowing years up to 1998 the capital stock is almost stationary.\nFigure 3: Sum of calculated capital stocks at replacement values\nyear\nbill. DM\nIf we estimate median and quartiles it is apparent that the distribution of the capital stocks\nof individual firms is extraordinary skewed. The median of the capital stock in our data\nbase is about 10 million DM.\nFigure 4: Level and dispersion of the capital stocks\nmill. DM\nyear\nmedian\n4.4.2. A comparison with official sectoral data\nFor calculating sectoral capital stocks based on the individual balance sheet data, we\nexpand the sectoral estimates proportionally by the ratio of the sum of sales to the sectoral\nsales figures.\nFigure 5: Estimates by proportional expansion through sales\nVGR own approach\nbill. DM\nmanufacturing construction\ncommerce\nyear\nThe comparison with official sectoral data (national accounts) shows that for\nmanufacturing and construction the estimates based on the individual balance sheet data\nresemble the aggregate data reasonably well. Only for the wholesale/retail trade sector do\nthe balance sheet-based figures underestimate the sectoral data noticeably. When assessing\nthe results it should be borne in mind that no information concerning the sectoral level of\ncapital stocks was used in the calculations. Only sectoral price changes and sectoral ratios\nof different price concepts were used for adjusting the book values as well as the sales\ncoverage ratio of our data base. We therefore conclude that the algorithm used for\nestimating the capital stock at replacement values based on given historical cost data from\nfirm-level balance sheets performs rather well.\n5. The Calculation of Q\nWhile the advantage of average Q based on stock prices is the exploitation of market\nexpectations there are several serious drawbacks to this conventional approach. First,\nmarket expectations can be rather poor. The recent slump in technology shares, which lost\nabout 90% of their value within one year, may serve as an example of the noisiness of\nshare prices. The second drawback is that only a small fraction of an economy's firms is\nquoted on stock markets. Finally, it is marginal Q that is theoretically relevant for the\nfirm's investment decision and not average Q, except under special conditions concerning\nproduction technology.\nIn this chapter we outline our approach to calculating measures of Q using balance sheet\ndata. Both measures of Q we calculate are based on balance sheet data using a vector-\nautoregressive forecasting procedure. By estimating market values of equity, we first\ncalculate average Q values comparable to the conventional Q measures based on stock\nmarkets. In a second approach following Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995, 1998) we\nestimate marginal Q-values based on strong assumptions about firms' production\ntechnology. After giving a brief overview of related work, the estimation procedure as well\nas empirical results are presented.\n5.1. An Overview of empirical work using the direct forecasting approach\nIn the following overview we concentrate on empirical papers which adopt the direct\nforecasting approach. An extensive overview of empirical studies using stock market data\nwas already provided by Hubbard (1998). We start with the influential paper by Abel and\nBlanchard (1986), which introduced the method of vector autoregression into the context\nof Q-models. Even though it only used aggregated data, the paper laid the fundamental\nbasis for the following extensions to panel data by Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995, 1998).\nThe paper by Bontempi et al (2001) follows Gilchrist and Himmelberg by applying the\napproach to a large panel data set of non-quoted Italian firms.\nAbel and Blanchard base their approach on the Q-theory of investment. Instead of using\nthe conventional stock market-based average Q, they estimate Q through forming\nexpectations on future returns based on lagged variables.12 The authors use a VAR model\nto make use of the time series information contained in their macroeconomic data set.\nMarginal Q is estimated as the discounted sum of expected future profits.13 The\nexpectations of the unknown marginal profits and the unknown discount factors are each\nestimated as linear combinations of an observable vector Z which evolves according to a\n13 Thereby Abel and Blanchard treat the future discount rate as an unknown random variable. In this\ncase the estimation of the unknown marginal Q requires taking into account the product of random\nvariables.\nvector-autoregressive process. As the information set 1\n-\nt includes only lagged values of\nZ, the estimated Q is a beginning-of-period marginal profit of investment.14\nVariables used to estimate the VAR are, besides the returns on equity and debt, the ratio of\nlabor cost to the capital stock, the sales/capital stock ratio, the stock market valuation of\ncapital, average Q, the manufacturing price inflation, and the investment ratio.\nIn the estimated investment functions, only lagged values of the estimated marginal Q\nseries have any explanatory power for investment, whereas the parameter of current Q is\ninsignificantly negative. If added to the investment equation, lagged sales appear to have a\nsignificant positive influence on investment.\nThe performance of marginal Q in explaining the investment ratio is relatively poor. The\nauthors present a list of possible causes of the poor results: the aggregation problems, the\nassumption of homogeneity of capital, the assumption of perfect capital markets and the\nnegligence of liquidity constraints.\nFollowing Abel and Blanchard (1986), the authors estimate a set of vector-autoregressive\nforecasting equations using a subset of balance sheet information. The forecasts of the\nVAR model are used to construct the expected value of marginal Q conditional on the\nobserved fundamentals. The expected value of marginal Q is called fundamental Q.15\nThe unobservable marginal profit of capital is proxied by a measure of realized profits in\nrelation to the existing capital. This approximation holds under strong assumptions\nconcerning the production technology.16\nThe VAR model is estimated separately for a priori liquidity constrained and unconstrained\nfirms to allow for differences in the forecasting scheme. The authors do not use firm-\nspecific depreciation rates nor time-varying interest rates. The fixed value assumed for\ndepreciation is 15% and the fixed value assumed for the interest rate is 6%.\nTobin's Q based on share prices leads to much lower parameter estimates compared to\nfundamental Q. Adding cash flow as a further explanatory variable leads to a significant\ncash flow sensitivity for both Q specifications. When the sample is grouped a priori, only\nthe constrained firms show a significant cash flow sensitivity. Controlling for cash flow\nthrough the incorporation in the forecasting system does not alter the findings of the\nprevious literature.\nVAR model is estimated using 5 or 7 variables following a fourth-order vector-autoregressive process.\n15 In the 1998 paper Gilchrist and Himmelberg extend the approach, analyzing in a first step the\ndynamics of firms' investment behaviour using a VAR model for panel data. See\nEven if the authors find Tobin's Q a poor proxy for investment opportunities, the results of\nthe literature using Tobin's Q are confirmed. The fundamental Q seems to be superior,\nleading to higher parameter estimates. Because cash flow is explicitly included in the\nforecasting model, the authors interpret an additional sensitivity of cash flow as evidence\nof the existence of capital market imperfections.\nBontempi et al base their analysis on the fundamental distinction between equipment and\nstructures.17 These two components of the capital stock are characterized by different rates\nof depreciation and a different tax treatment. The usual aggregation of equipment and\nstructures is criticized because this aggregation rests on the counterfactual assumption of\nperfect substitutability. Further, the authors assume that equipment and structures show\ndifferent adjustment costs.18\nThe results show that equipment reacts strongly and significantly to Q, whereas structures\ndo not respond to Q.19 Some of the regressions have to be interpreted with care because\nthe Sargan test fails to reject the validity of the instruments. When testing for different\nforms of adjustment costs, the authors find that the assumption of convex adjustment costs\ndoes not hold for structures. This implies a fixed component in the adjustment costs. When\nestimating separate equations for purchases and sales of investment goods, the results show\nthat only equipment responds significantly to Q, with purchases reacting much more\nstrongly than sales.\nIn a further step Bontempi et al explore the possibility of interrelated adjustment costs. It is\ntherefore assumed that the level of structures influences the adjustment costs of equipment\nand vice versa, and that the adjustment cost function is linearly homogeneous. The\nestimated investment functions now include, besides the Q-measures for equipment and\nstructures, the ratio of the two components of the capital stock as well as the product of Q\nand the measure of the capital stock's structure. For this investment equations Q is\nsignificant for structures as well as for equipment, while the structure of the capital stock is\nnever significant and the combined effect only sometimes. Based on these results, the\nauthors conclude that the two capital goods seem to be complements in their adjustment\n18 The authors use a large database including balance sheets and income statements of more than 52,000\nItalian manufacturing firms. The final estimates are base on a balanced panel of 1,539 firms.\n5.2. The Calculation of Q using firm-level balance sheet data\nWe use the following definition of marginal Q stated by Hayashi (1982) as the starting\npoint: \"Remember that Q, which we call marginal Q, is the ratio of the market value of an\nadditional unit of capital to its replacement cost.\"21\nAs marginal Q is not observed, one way to overcome this problem followed extensively in\nthe empirical literature is to use stock market data to measure unobservable expectations.\nSince in Germany only the smallest share of an economy's firms is quoted on stock\nmarkets, the concept of using stock market data to study firms' investment behaviour\nexcludes the majority of firms from an empirical investigation.22 When using accounting\ndata it is therefore necessary to apply alternative concepts to find measures that proxy for\nthe expectations about future profits or future marginal profitabilities of capital. In the\nfollowing two concepts for measuring the firm's investment profitabilities, average Q and\nmarginal Q, are illustrated.\n5.2.1. Calculating Tobin's Q (average Q)\nThe approach used in this paper is based on the formula used by several authors23 to\ncalculate Tobin's Q for firm i at period t as the ratio of the market value of equity (\nit\nV ) plus\nthe market value of outstanding debt ( )\nit\nD minus the replacement value of all remaining\nassets besides the capital stock ( )\nit\nN to the replacement value of the capital stock (\nit\nK ):\nit\nit\nit\nit\nit K\nN\nD\nV\nQ\n-\n+\n=\nWhen using balance sheet data in the empirical analysis, no market values of equity and\ndebt are available in the data source and they therefore have to be estimated. The approach\nused in this paper is to estimate market values of equity based on a VAR-forecasting model\nas was suggested by Abel and Blanchard (1986). This approach was extended to panel\nThe VAR-model we estimate contains three variables, pre-tax profits (PTP), sales (S) and\ncash flow (CF). The use of pre-tax profits instead of the theoretically more appealing after\ntax profits is inevitable because the apparent tax rate often shows implausible values and\nenormous variance. This is due to the fact that the data base contains firms of different\nlegal status and no information about the firms' dividend policy. In our final estimates we\nmake use of the forecasts based on a VAR containing one lag, but we obtained comparable\nresults when using two lags.\n22 Beside the argument of data availability, the empirical results using stock market data have been\nrather disappointing, see e.g. the overview in Chirinko (1993).\nThe equations of the VAR model using one lag can be written as\nit\nt\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni\ni\nit x\na\nx\na\nx\na\nd\n,\n,\n,\n\n+\n+\n+\n+\n= -\n-\n-\nit\nt\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni\ni\nit x\na\nx\na\nx\na\nd\n,\n,\n,\n\n+\n+\n+\n+\n= -\n-\n-\nit\nt\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni\ni\nit x\na\nx\na\nx\na\nd\n,\n,\n,\n\n+\n+\n+\n+\n= -\n-\n-\nThe equations of the VAR do not contain time dummies because we are interested in\nexpected values conditioned on lagged values and fixed firm effects and not conditioned\non specific time effects.24\nAs the usual LSDV estimator is known to be biased, one of the various other available\napproaches has to be followed, taking into account the problems of dynamic panel data\nestimation.25 When applying a direct bias correction to estimate the dynamic equations\ncontaining fixed effects, all variables j are measured as deviations from their firm-\nindividual means and therefore the equations do not contain firm-specific effects:\n=\n-\n=\nT\nt\njit\njit\njit x\nT\nx\nx\n~\nAlternatively the dynamic equations can be estimated using a GMM approach.

For discounting even further\nforecasts the interest rate with a maturity of 9 years is used. In this respect we differ from\nwhich for simplicity assume a fixed interest rate for all years and for all maturities.\nThe estimated discounted value of future profits t\ni\nV ,\n^ is taken as part of the nominator to\ncalculate firm and year-specific average Q:\nit\nit\nit\nit\na\nit\nK\nN\nD\nV\nQ\n-\n+\n=\n^\nSo far we have estimated average Qa using the estimated market value of equity.28 To\ncalculate marginal (fundamental) Qm we follow a similar approach using the described\nPanel-VAR-technique. To calculate fundamental Qm we first have to find a proxy for the\nmarginal profitability of capital ( it\nMPK ). Following Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1998) we\nuse a measure based on a Cobb-Douglas-Production technology where capital is seen as a\nquasi fixed factor of production:\n\n\n M\nL\nCK\nY =\n26 This formulation of the forecast process does not take into account the existence of individual fixed\neffects. Either these effects have to be cancelled out by some data transformation (averaging or\ndifferencing) or they have to be estimated explicitly. See the Appendix for further details.\n27 In our calculation we stop after 200 forecasting periods instead of using an indefinite forecast horizon.\n28 From a theoretical point of view a marginal Q is more appropriate, see Gilchrist/Himmelberg (1998).\nwith\nY output\nK capital stock\nL labour\nM intermediates\n\n\n ,\n, elasticities of production\nAllowing for economies of scale\n\n\n\n +\n=\n+\nthe firm faces the following maximization problem:\nF\nMV\nLW\nYP -\n-\n-\n=\n\nwith\n profit\nP output price\nW wage\nV price of intermediates\nF fixed costs\nsubject to the Cobb-Douglas production function\nF\nMV\nLW\nP\nM\nL\nAK -\n-\n-\n= \n\n\n .\nThe marginal profitability of capital is given by\n( )\nK\nF\nMV\nLW\nP\nM\nL\nAK\nK \n-\n-\n-\n\n=\n\n \n\n\n\nAllowing for non-perfect competition, the MPK can be written as\nY\nK\nY\nY\nP\nP\nK\nY\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n=\nK\nY\nP\nP\nY\nY\nP\nP\nK\nY\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n=\nK\nY\nP\nP\nK\nY\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n)\n-\n+\n\n\n= \nP\nK\nY\n)\n- +\n= \nK\nK\nS\nK\nS\n\n\n =\n+\n= - )\nwith\n price-elasticity of demand\nS sales\nTherefore, the unknown MPK is proportional to the sales-to-capital-stock ratio.

Empirical Results\n6.1. Descriptive evidence\nThe following table contains some descriptive statistics for the estimated average and\nmarginal Q. From the table as well as from the graph containing kernel-density estimations\nfor the two Qs, it can be seen that average Q exhibits on average a higher level and greater\nvariance.30 While the average Q is somewhat higher than the expected equilibrium value,\nthe estimated marginal Q values are somewhat too low.\nTable 1: Descriptive statistics of the estimated Qs\n Skewn.\nFigure 6:Kernel-density estimations for the estimated Qs\nAverage Q\nMarginal Q\nQ\nNote: The kernel used was triangular with a bandwidth of 0.25.\nBefore estimating the dynamic investment equations using the two different measures of Q\nwe take a non-parametric approach to see whether we can find any indication of a linear\nrelation in the bivariate case. We estimate three non-parametric regressions explaining the\ninvestment ratio by its lagged value, average and marginal Q respectively.\n30 To control for outliers we drop the upper and lower 0.5% quantils for both (average and marginal) Q-\nmeasures.\nFigure 7: Kernel regression: I/K = f(I/K -1)\nLag(I/K)\nNote: The non-parametric regression includes the 500 nearest neighbours at each data point. The kernel used was triangular.\nFigure 8: Kernel regression: I/K = f(Qa)\nQ\nNote: The non-parametric regression includes the 500 nearest neighbours at each data point. The kernel used was triangular.\nFigure 9: Kernel regression: I/K = f(Qm)\nQ\nNote: The non-parametric regression includes the 500 nearest neighbours at each data point. The kernel used was triangular.\nThe non-parametric regression indicates a positive and fairly linear relation between\ninvestment and the Q measures for positive Q-values, while the figure for lagged\ninvestment might indicate a saturation point.\n6.2. Estimated Q-investment functions\nThe investment functions are estimated using a bias-corrected estimator to take into\naccount the resulting bias when using the lagged endogenous variable.31 We also applied\nGMM-estimation techniques to estimate the dynamic investment function. But when\ncomparing the two estimation techniques we prefer the direct bias correction method for\ntwo reasons. First, when analyzing different estimator simulation studies (Kiviet (1995),\ncompared to GMM-estimators.\nSecond, as is usually the case when using large micro data files containing mainly cross-\nsection information, the correlations of the data are rather low in almost all respects.\nTherefore, the use of differences instead of levels considerably reduces the amount of\ninformation contained in the data used for estimation. Instrumental estimation is known to\nbe problematic when instruments are rather weak.32 When instruments are weak, the\nresults are extremely sensitive to the choice of instruments, leading to a large number of\ndegrees of freedom for the researcher. We therefore regard it as an advantage of the bias\ncorrection approach that it restricts these facilities.33\nAverage Q:\n,\n.\n.\n)\n.\n(\n)\n.\n(\n=\n+\n+\n= -\n-\n\nn\nQ\nK\nI\na\nK\nI a\ni\nMarginal Q:\n,\n.\n.\n)\n.\n(\n)\n.\n(\n=\n+\n+\n= -\n-\n\nn\nQ\nK\nI\na\nK\nI m\ni\nWe find both measures of Q to be highly significant.34 In both equations the lagged\ninvestment ratio is highly significant as well. Comparing the parameters, we find that the\nparameter of marginal Q is four times the parameter of average Q. But it has to be taken\ninto account that average Q has a standard deviation almost four times the standard\n31 See the appendix for details about the estimation procedure.\n32 When instrumenting the difference of Q by the lagged difference of Q we loose about 99% of the\ninformation contained in the difference of Q!\n33 A comparison of the results using GMM-methods is given in the appendix.\n34 These results confirm the significant influence of Q on German firms investment spending found\nwhen using sectoral data, see Behr/Bellgardt (1998, 2000). For results for German firms using stock\nmarket data see Audretsch/Elston (2002).\ndeviation of marginal Q. The parameter of average Q is at the upper bound of the interval\nof parameters found in empirical studies using stock market data rather than the direct\nforecasting approach.35 The higher parameter of marginal Q is closer to the theoretical\nexpectations about its value when trying to interpret the parameter as the capital stock\nadjustment cost parameter. However, because of the dependence of the parameter value on\nthe standard deviation of the Q measure, the parameter should be interpreted with care.\nWhited (1992) discusses the problems of inferring adjustment cost parameters from the Q-\nparameter in detail.\nEven if the simple variance decomposition does not hold exactly in the context of the\ndynamic panel data estimation, the share of explained variance is still a useful indicator of\nthe explanatory power of the estimated equation. It turns out that average Q (5%) explains\na slightly larger part of investment compared to marginal Q (4%).\nAs marginal and average Q were measured quite differently, one might ask whether the\ninformation is rather redundant, or whether the two measures are independent of one\nanother. As shown by Hayashi (1982), the two measures can be interchanged only in the\ncase of perfect competition and linear homogeneous technology.\nTherefore, comparing the two different measures can also be seen as an indirect test of the\ncombined hypothesis of the production function and the adjustment cost function of the\ncapital stock being linearly homogeneous and of perfect competition. Of course, the\ncomparison is based on the operationalisation of both concepts and therefore depends\nstrongly on the adequacy of the operationalisation procedure. The following shows the\nestimated dynamic investment function containing marginal as well as average Q.\n,\n.\n.\n.\n)\n.\n(\n)\n.\n(\n)\n.\n(\n=\n+\n+\n+\n= -\n-\n-\n\nn\nQ\nQ\nK\nI\na\nK\nI m\na\ni\nWe find that both measures of Q contain valuable and largely independent information\nexplaining the investment behaviour of firms. According to the t-values, average Q does\nexplain partially a somewhat larger amount of the investment compared to marginal Q.\nTogether both measures of investment profitability explain about 10% of the variation of\ninvestment according to the naive measure of residual sum of squares divided by total sum\nof squares. The finding of fairly independent information in the two different measures of\nQ casts doubt on the theoretical assumptions of perfect competition and linear homogenous\ntechnology, which would make the use of the two measures interchangeable.\n6.3. Results for classes of firm size\nIn this section of the paper we analyse the investment behavior of four classes of firm size.\nThe following table contains descriptive measures for these four classes of firm size.36\nAs can be seen, the investment ratio decreases with firm size from 16.6 % in the smallest\nclass of firms to only 11.8 % in the class containing the largest firms. While marginal Q\nalso decreases from 0.7 for the smallest firms to only 0.6 in the class of the largest firms,\nthere is no such evidence for average Q.\nTable 2: Descriptive statistics for class sizes\nAverages, standard deviation in parentheses\nAll\n(smallest)\n(largest)\n( )\n, -\nt\ni\nK\nm\nt\ni\na\nt\ni\nNext we estimate dynamic investment functions for the four different size-classes using a\ndirect bias correction estimation method. The following table contains the results. It can be\nseen that the firms belonging to different classes exhibit strong differences in their\ninvestment behaviour. The influence of the lagged investment ratio increases from 0.05 for\nthe class of smallest to 0.23 for the class of largest firms and is significantly different from\n0 in all classes. Of course, it has to be borne in mind that the smaller the capital stock the\nless continuous will the investment process of a firm be according to pure aggregation\neffects. For larger firms the aggregation will smooth out such discontinuities. The\nparameter for average Q almost halves from 0.092 for the smallest firms to only 0.040 for\n36 The variable used to classify firms according to size is total assets (TA, balance sheet total) in 1988,\nthe year prior to the estimation period. Because only the balance sheet total is observable for lenders\nand outsiders, we do not correct the balance sheet total for the capital stock at replacement values. The\ngrouping according to the balance sheet total corrected for the revaluation of the capital stock leads to\nno major changes in the results.\nthe largest firms. Therefore it can be stated that the larger the firms the more its investment\nratio is influenced by its past investment behaviour and the less it takes the profitability,\nmeasured by average Q, into account.\nWhen using marginal Q the findings for the different size classes are similar concerning\nthe increasing influence of lagged investment for increasing firm size. For marginal Q\nthere is less evidence of decreasing influence with firm size compared to average Q. Each\nof the four different size classes show a strong and significant reaction to marginal Q.\nTable 3: Average Q investment functions for class sizes\nAll\n(smallest)\n(largest)\n( )\n, -\nt\ni\nK\na\nt\ni\nTable 4: Marginal Q investment functions for class sizes\nAll\n(smallest)\n(largest)\n( )\n, -\nt\ni\nK\nm\nt\ni\n7. Conclusion\nIn this paper we have analyzed the investment behaviour of German firms within the\nframework of the Q-theory. Facing two severe problems of non-adequate capital stock\nbalance sheet data and non-available stock market data, alternative measures were applied.\nTransforming the balance sheet figures of the capital stock less depreciations at historical\ncosts into meaningful figures at replacement values was accomplished using a new\nalgorithm. The disaggregation into structures and equipment, the disaggregation into\nvintages and the existence of different capital goods' lifetimes is taken into account.\nSince anonymous individual firm balance sheet data were used, no stock market measure\nof Q is available. The data basis contained roughly 2,000 firms covering the twelve years\nfor the period 1987 to 1998. By following the approach of Abel and Blanchard and\nGilchrist and Himmelberg, measures of Q were derived making use of a vector-\nautoregressive model to forecast future profitability directly. Two different measures of Q,\nmarginal and average Q were derived. Both, a direct bias correction method and the GMM\napproach, were applied to estimate the investment functions. Given the loss of information\nwhen turning to differenced variables, as also because simulation results favour a direct\nbias correction procedure, the direct bias correction method was preferred to the GMM\napproach.\nThe estimation results of dynamic investment equations show that the Q measures\ninfluence the firm's fixed investment spending significantly. When comparing the two Q-\nproxies, the average Q slightly outperforms marginal Q. This outcome might be due to the\nstrong assumptions concerning the production technology underlying the calculation of\nmarginal Q which are perhaps not met in reality.\nWhen analyzing the investment behaviour in four different classes of firm size, we find\nthat larger firms react less strongly to Q and more strongly to lagged investment.\nAppendix\nA.

The data source\nThe data set after calculating the capital stock using the detailed schedule of fixed asset\nmovements leaves us with 3,169 firms and 11 years to start with.\nTo prevent outliers biasing the results we drop the upper and lower 0.5 % of the\nobservations of the following nine variables:\n- ratio of aggregated investment to the aggregated capital stock\n- ratio of investment in equipment to the capital stock of equipment\n- ratio of investment in structures to the capital stock of structures\n- ratio of pre-tax profits to the capital stock\n- ratio of sales to the capital stock\n- ratio of cash flow to the capital stock\n- ratio of operating income to the capital stock\n- marginal Q\n- average Q.\nThe balancing of the data after eliminating the outliers leaves 2,303 firms in the sample.\nThroughout the analysis we use (with one exception) all variables at nominal values. The\nreason for doing so is the use of ratios in the investment equation:\na\nt\ni\ni Q\nK\nI\na\nK\nI\n,\n-\n\n+\n+\n= \n\nBy dividing through the capital stock, the resulting ratios contain the relevant information\nfor the investor according to our understanding. We do not see a ratio of, for examples ales\nat prices of year t-k to the capital stock at prices of year t-k as constituting a relevant piece\nof information for the investor. By the same reasoning, we do not envisage an investor\ndeciding about investment at prices of year t-k divided by the capital stock at prices of year\nt-k.\nF.
