Within this emerging domain of positive/\nprosocial research, empathy has become a central and well-\nstudied construct. As detailed by Rosan (2012), philosophers\nhave long discussed empathy in a variety of ways, including\npsychological study has developed its own conceptualiza-\ntions grounded in these long-standing discussions.As a result,\nthe construct has been used in at least eight distinct ways (see\nBatson, 2009a) across various investigations in psychology;\nthus, empathy has no universally accepted definition. Even\nso, this research has typically focused on affective aspects of\nempathic responding (i.e., sharing the emotional experience\nof another; see Decety & Jackson, 2004), though a great deal\nof attention has also been devoted to its cognitive characteris-\ntics as well (i.e., taking the perspective of another; e.g.,\nBakker, Shimazu, Demerouti, Shimada, & Kawakami, 2011;\nSchnell, Bluschke, Konradt, & Walter, 2011).\nWhen it comes to the affective aspects of empathy, modern\npsychology researchers typically distinguish between self-\noriented and other-oriented feelings (e.g., personal distress vs.\nempathic concern; see Davis, 1983). Both types of feelings are\nbelieved to be triggered by emotional contagion--a process\nthrough which people converge emotionally with one another,\nas if one individual \"catches\" another's emotion (Hatfield,\nCacioppo, & Rapson, 1992). If an individual encounters and is\naffected by another's distress, self-oriented feelings produce\nan \"aversive emotional reaction . . . that is associated with the\negoistic motivation of making oneself feel better\" (Eisenberg,\nform of other-oriented feelings, the experience is undergirded\nby motivation to help that other feel better. As Bernhardt and\nSinger (2012) describe it, \"emotional contagion underlies\naffect sharing; this can be followed by other-oriented feelings\nsuch as compassion, sympathy, and empathic concern, which\nmay further promote prosocial behavior\" (p. 3). Such other-\noriented affective states do not constitute the whole of empa-\nthy, of course, but are central nonetheless because they are\nbelieved to motivate prosocial behaviors (cf. Kim & Kou,\n2014). Moreover, they are a key component of most descrip-\n1California State University, Long Beach, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nAaron Castelan Cargile, Department of Communication Studies,\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach, 1250 Bellflower Blvd. Long Beach,\nEmail: aaron.cargile@csulb.edu\nCan Video Engender Empathic Concern\nfor Others?

Provided this conceptual centrality then, affective\nempathy's ability to motivate prosocial behavior has been\nwidely studied.\nAlthough the connection between affective empathy and\naltruism is complex, it has nevertheless been found to be\ndemonstrably valid (Batson, Lishner, & Stocks, 2015;\nEisenberg, Eggum, & Di Giunta, 2010). Among the most\ntypical findings, laboratory participants with greater other-\noriented concern express greater interest in and willingness to\nhelp others (e.g., Batson, Chang, Orr, & Rowland, 2002;\nBatson, Eklund, Chermok, Hoyt, & Ortiz, 2007; Eisenberg\net al., 1989). Longitudinal studies have helped to corroborate\nthis relationship outside the laboratory (e.g., Yoo, Feng, &\nDay, 2013), and functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI) studies have helped to identify several neurological\nmechanisms of this relationship. Empathic concern has been\nassociated with activity in particular neural regions (i.e.,\nmedial prefrontal cortex [MPFC] and anterior insula), and\nstudies have linked enhanced activation of these regions to,\namong other things, a greater willingness to endure physical\npain on behalf of a fellow ingroup member (Hein, Silani,\nPreuschoff, Batson, & Singer, 2010), and the authoring of\nmore prosocial emails to victims of social exclusion (Masten,\nMorelli, & Eisenberger, 2011). In these myriad ways then, the\ncentral status and importance of empathic concern (i.e., other-\noriented affect) have been corroborated. In light of that sig-\nnificance, it is worth investigating what motivates empathic\nconcern.\nEmpathic concern can be influenced by a number of\nboth \"trait\" and \"state\" factors. Beginning with the former,\nnumerous individual difference variables have been linked\nto greater empathic concern, including age (e.g., Sze,\nGyurak, Goodkind, & Levenson, 2012), gender (e.g., Van\nder Graaff et al., 2014), genetic variation (e.g., K. E. Smith,\nPorges, Norman, Connelly, & Decety, 2014), emotion regu-\nlation style (e.g., Lebowitz & Dovidio, 2015), cultural\nbackground (e.g., Cassels, Chan, & Chung, 2010), and self-\nreported dispositional empathic concern (e.g., Singer et al.,\n2008). Similarly, a fair number of situational conditions\nhave also been linked to increased affective empathy,\nincluding autobiographical memory sharing (Bluck, Baron,\nAinsworth, Gesselman, & Gold, 2013), perceiving the other\nas in need (e.g., Lishner, Batson, & Huss, 2011), valuing\nthe other's welfare (e.g., Batson et al., 2007), detailed pro-\ncessing (Woltin, Corneille, Yzerbyt, & F\u00f6rster, 2011), and,\nmost prominently, active imagining of the other's plight\n(i.e., perspective taking; see Batson, 2009b). Given the\nvariety of pathways to expanding empathy suggested by\nthis research, a host of trainings and interventions have\nattempted to do just that: increase participant empathic con-\ncern for others.\nIn a review of 29 studies assessing seven different training\nmethodologies, Lam, Kolomitro, and Alamparambil (2011)\nconcluded that although cognitive empathy can be reliably\nimproved, \"very little is known about the trainability of the\naffective [empathy]\" (p. 163). For example, although mind-\nfulness training develops present moment awareness believed\nto encourage empathy-inducing perceptions (e.g., percep-\ntions of need or detailed processing), studies have failed to\nreliably demonstrate its effect on affective empathy (e.g.,\nBirnie, Speca, & Carlson, 2010; Block-Lerner, Adair, Plumb,\nof studies have shown that other sorts of interventions can\nincrease affective empathy, if only slightly.\nOne potential pathway to increased empathic concern is\nthe development of empathic habits. Although empathic\nresponding is, in part, genetically grounded, there is a large\nsocio-cultural component as well. Thus, it is conceivable that\nlevels of empathic concern could be shifted with practice. A\nstudy by Konrath et al. (2015) has recently assessed such a\npractice-based intervention, called \"text to connect.\"\nParticipants in the \"text to connect\" group received a \"high\nempathy\" text message 6 times a day for 14 days (e.g.,\n\"Reflect on somebody close to you. What makes them feel\nhappiest?\"), while those in a control group were either sent\nsimilar, but self-focused messages (e.g., \"Reflect on this\nquestion. What makes you better than others?\"), or were not\nsent any text messages. Participants who were prompted to\npractice empathy during the 2-week period reported higher\nlevels of emotional empathy for a distressed individual than\nthose in either control group. The increase was small, yet it\nwas significant and persisted after controlling for individual\ndifferences in dispositional empathy. A similarly small\nincrease in empathic concern was observed among nursing\nstudents who underwent 3.5 hours of professional nonviolent\ncommunication training (Nosek, Gifford, & Kober, 2014).\nThrough both instruction and role-play practice, this training\nwas designed to help participants tune into others' perspec-\ntives (see Rosenberg, 1999). It succeeded in this instance,\nand the results help demonstrate that affective empathy can\nindeed be increased through practice.\nAlongside practice, research also suggests that affective\nempathy can also be increased through affect arousal. As\nmentioned earlier, emotional contagion appears to underlie\nempathic concern; thus, certain emotional states may trigger\nsubsequent affective empathy (see Forgas, 2001). For exam-\nple, Mallinckrodt et al. (2013; Study 1) found that an attach-\nment security prime (i.e., imagine a loved one coming to\nyour assistance) contributed to a small increase in partici-\npants empathic feelings beyond those engendered by a posi-\ntive affect prime (i.e., imagine that you won the lottery). This\nstudy did not include a no-prime control group, but previous\nresearch suggests that positive affect itself may also increase\naffective empathy (Nelson, 2009). Affective empathy has\nalso been observed to trigger additional affective empathy\nwith respect to a second target (Cargile, 2016). Specifically,\nthis study found that an emotional video about a boy with\ncancer increased participants' affective empathy for the boy\n(relative to a neutral video) which, in turn, engendered addi-\ntional affective empathy for an African American man\nrecounting a true story of discrimination.\nJust as some forms of positive affect have been found to\nincrease affective empathy, so too have some forms of nega-\ntive affect. For example, hypothesizing that personal pain\nwould facilitate other-pain empathy, Xiao, Zhu, and Luo\n(2015; Study 1) exposed participants to ice-induced physical\npain. Results showed that participants in the pain group\nreported slightly higher levels of state empathy (including\naffective empathy) than those in a no-pain, control group.\nSimilarly, negative affect induced by psychosocial stress has\nbeen found to engender a small-to-moderate increase in emo-\ntional empathy for people pictured in emotional social scenes\n(Wolf et al., 2015). The explanation is that elevated levels of\naffective empathy may be the result of a prosocial-behavior-\nafter-stress process (von Dawans, Fischbacher, Kirschbaum,\nFehr, & Heinrichs, 2012). Thus, although it is still the case\nthat we know relatively little about reliably enhancing affec-\ntive empathy, this recent research adds to our understanding\nand suggests several potential methods that merit additional\ninvestigation.\nGiven the above-described candidate methods to enhance\naffective empathy, it is worth noting that not all are easily\n(e.g., professional nonviolent communication training) or\nethically (e.g., personal pain) implemented. One method,\nhowever, shows promise as a convenient intervention: the\nemotional video. Emotional videos have been used in the lab,\nin classrooms, and across cultures to great effect (e.g.,\nthis, as well as the mediated impact that one video has already\ndemonstrated (Cargile, 2016), the aim of the present research\nis to further investigate the effect of this brief emotional\nvideo on empathic concern for a secondary other. Specifically,\nthis article will address (a) whether this effect can be repli-\ncated across different educational settings (i.e., in a class-\nroom setting and online) with different participant\npopulations, (b) whether the effect persists when relevant\ncovariates are controlled, and (c) whether the effect degrades\nover time.\nTo address the above-listed questions, Study 1 was designed\nto replicate the previous findings of mediated impact for an\nemotional video in a classroom setting (Cargile, 2016).\nUnlike the prior study, however, the present one engaged rel-\nevant controls and conditions to help ensure that any differ-\nence in empathic concern for the secondary other was best\nexplained by affect arousal, and not by some other mecha-\nnism. Specifically, this study controlled for dispositional\nempathic concern, as well as perceptions of police racial\nbias--an individual difference variable directly relevant to\nthe stories told by the secondary others (see the Appendix).\nIn addition, situational empathic concern was assessed in\nrelation to two different (secondary) others at 2 different\ntimes to detect the possible degradation of effect.\nAlthough this study was not designed to identify the spe-\ncific mechanism of affect arousal (i.e., no physiological data\nwere collected), there are several possibilities, which all pre-\nsumably degrade over time. For example, the emotional\nvideo used here has been demonstrated to increase viewers'\nlevels of oxytocin (Barraza & Zak, 2009)--a neurohormone\nwith robust links to empathy (Hurlemann et al., 2010;\nRodrigues, Saslow, Garcia, John, & Keltner, 2009). If oxyto-\ncin were the mechanism of effect, it should fade entirely after\n3 min (Zak, 2012). Alternatively, if the affective impact\ndepended upon short-term memory, this too should decay\n(Ricker, Vergauwe, & Cowan, 2014) or be subject to interfer-\nence (Lewandowsky, Oberauer, & Brown, 2009) over a short\nperiod of time. It is thus important to establish whether the\nhypothesized effect disappears after 10 min or whether it\nunexpectedly endures.\nWith the above-described aims and design, Study 1 tested\nthe following two hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1: Participants shown the emotional video\nwill report greater empathic concern (relative to control\ngroup participants) for a secondary other that is both\nmediated by empathic arousal and which is not explained\nby correlated individual differences.\nHypothesis 2: The controlled, mediated effect of the\nemotional video on empathic concern for secondary oth-\ners will be significant for the assessment made immedi-\nately after showing the video and non-significant for the\nassessment made approximately 10 min later.\nMethod\nParticipants and Procedures\nParticipants were 118 undergraduate students at a large urban\nuniversity in the Western United States, recruited in class to\ntake part on a voluntary basis. Participants reported a mean\nfemales (two declined to state) from a variety of racial/ethnic\nAfrican American, 5 mixed ethnicity, 3 \"Other,\" and 3\ndeclined to state). After signing a statement of informed con-\nsent, participants completed demographic items and two trait\nmeasures in a brief survey packet (i.e., empathic concern and\nperceptions of police bias), after which they were randomly\nassigned to view either the control (n = 65) or experimental\n(n = 53) version of the video.\nFollowing this, the control group was excused from the\nlecture hall while the experimental group viewed the video\nclip, listened to Speaker 1's story, and completed measures\nof state empathic concern. Afterward, the experimental\n4 SAGE Open\ngroup was excused, and the control group engaged in identi-\ncal procedures--except that they were shown the control\nversion of the video. Finally, after approximately 10 min had\npassed, the experimental group returned to the classroom\nand, together, both groups listened to Speaker 2's story and\ncompleted a measure of state empathic concern. Following\nthis protocol meant that the control group was provided only\nan approximate 4-min gap between their evaluations of\nSpeaker 1 and Speaker 2, whereas the experimental group\nwas provided 10 min. This unbalanced designed was deemed\nsuitable because the null impact of the control video was not\nexpected to change in relation to the time gap.\nMaterials and Measures\nVideo stimuli. Because they have been successfully used in\nstudies of affective empathy (Cargile, 2016) and subse-\nquent altruism (Barraza, Alexander, Beavin, Terris, & Zak,\ntional) and control (i.e., non-emotional) videos used here\nwere clips edited from a brief feature produced by St. Jude\nChildren's Research Hospital. Both videos portray the\nfather of a 2-year-old boy who is dying of brain cancer.\nHowever, the experimental video (79 s duration) includes\nscenes of the child in the hospital and the father who is\nnearly brought to tears, whereas the control video (56 s\nduration) includes scenes of the child at a zoo with no\nmention of his illness.\nAs described earlier, affective empathy includes both self-\noriented (i.e., personal distress) and other-oriented (i.e.,\nempathic concern) reactions. The experimental video used\nhere has been shown to increase both types of affective\nempathy in participants relative to the control video (Barraza\n& Zak, 2009). However, only other-oriented affective empa-\nthy has been linked to subsequent altruistic behavior (Barraza\net al., 2015) and additional affective empathy with respect to\na second target (Cargile, 2016). Thus, although the experi-\nmental video potentially engenders a complex emotional\nreaction, the focus here was on manipulating and studying\nthe effects of other-oriented affective empathy (i.e., empathic\nconcern).\nStories of police racial bias. As this study focused on enhanc-\ning empathic concern, a relevant question became, \"empathic\nconcern for whom?\" Although there are many secondary\nothers for whom enhanced empathic concern could be\nassessed, I chose individuals with stories most relevant to\nongoing racial tensions in the United States: two African\nAmerican men recounting true stories of discrimination and\nabuse at the hands of police officers. Frank and Reginald's\nstories were taken from a video series of oral histories (The\nSouthern Coalition for Social Justice, n.d.). To make the sto-\nrytellers as comparable as possible, only the audio was used,\nand both stories were edited to approximately 2 min in length\n(see the appendix).\nStudy measures. Following Barraza and Zak's (2009) protocol,\nempathic feelings for the boy (EFB) with cancer (i.e., other-\noriented affective empathy) experienced in response to the\nvideo presentation were assessed by six adjectives (sympa-\nthetic, compassion, moved, tender, warm, soft-hearted) used\nespecially in economic research and derived from A. Smith\nnot feel this way at all) to 4 (felt this way very much;  = .94).\nEmpathic concern for the storyteller was measured using\nseven items adapted from the Empathic Concern subscale of\nthe most widely used measure of empathy--the Interpersonal\nReactivity Index (IRI; Davis, 1983). The IRI is a measure of\ntrait empathy and the seven-item Empathic Concern subscale\nwas used as intended, without alteration, at the outset of\nstudy participation ( = .77). Previous research indicates that\nthis subscale is the best, if not the sole (e.g., Krueger et al.,\n2013) predictor of state empathic concern among the four\nIRI subscales (i.e., Perspective Taking, Fantasy, Personal\nDistress, and Empathic Concern). As a result, only this sub-\nscale was used here. In addition, following the lead of others\nwho have measured state empathic concern (e.g., Xiao et al.,\n2015), the seven IRI trait items were slightly modified to\nmeasure empathy for the storytellers; for example, the item\n\"I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less for-\ntunate than me\" became \"I had tender, concerned feelings for\nthe speaker.\" The resulting state version of the Empathic\nConcern subscale exhibited even greater reliability than the\ntrait version across both speakers (Speaker 1,  = .88;\nFinally, to control for participant beliefs about police dis-\ncrimination that would most likely affect their empathic con-\ncern for the specific speakers featured here, four items were\nused to measure trait perceptions of police racial bias (PPRB;\nWeitzer & Tuch, 2005). Unfortunately, the four-item measure\nexhibited poor reliability ( = .62). Although dropping the\nreverse-coded item would improve reliability ( = .68), all\nfour items were retained to maintain consistency with respect\nto Study 2 (in which the measure exhibited high reliability).\nFinally, as noted in the literature review, age and gender are\noften associated with greater empathic concern, so they were\nassessed as potential covariates alongside both PPRB and\ntrait empathic concern. Descriptive statistics and intercorrela-\ntions for all study variables are presented in Table 1.\nResults\nAs indicated in Table 1, all potential covariates except age\n(i.e., PPRB, trait empathic concern, and gender) were signifi-\ncantly correlated with empathic concern for Speaker 1\n(ECS1). Consequently, age was dropped from the analysis,\nand mediation models were estimated both with and without\ncovariates. A series of independent sample t tests indicated\nthat although there were no significant differences between\nthe control and experimental groups with respect to PPRB\nand gender, the experimental group had higher levels of trait\nreason, trait empathic concern was never excluded as a\ncovariate in the analyses.\nTo test whether the emotional video had a mediated effect\nestimated using unstandardized coefficients and bootstrap-\nping with 10,000 resamples (including only trait empathic\nconcern as a covariate). The emotional video was found to\nsignificant direct effect of the emotional video on ECS1 (b =\ncovariates, the non-significant result (i.e., video direct effect\nas well as the significant results remained unchanged (i.e.,\nThe same approach was used to assess the impact of the\nemotional video on empathic concern for Speaker 2 (ECS2),\nwho was evaluated approximately 10 min after seeing the\nvideo.

When PPRB and gender were included as\ncovariates, the indirect effect of the video on empathic con-\ncern for the speaker remained non-significant (b = .16, SE =\nDiscussion\nThis study replicated a small but significant indirect effect of\nthe emotional video on empathic concern for a secondary\nother found in earlier research (Cargile, 2016). Moreover, it\nconfirmed both Hypotheses 1 and 2 by finding both that this\neffect persisted when controlling for relevant covariates and\nthat the effect diminished over time. Despite the fact that\nexperimental and control group participants possessed\nunequal levels of dispositional empathic concern, the use of\ncovariates in this study has helped confirm the first hypoth-\nesis by demonstrating a mediated effect caused by the video\nand not by the measured individual differences. In addition,\nthese results also confirmed the second hypothesis by dem-\nonstrating a degradation of this mediated effect over an\napproximate 10-min period. This suggests that affect arousal\nis the mechanism likely responsible for the video's effect on\nspeaker empathic concern. Even so, it is worth noting that\nthe size and significance of the effect degraded only mini-\nmally over this period.\nAlthough this study successfully addressed questions\nabout the source and time frame of this mediated effect, it is\nimportant to determine whether this effect can be replicated\nin other pedagogical contexts, with different participant pop-\nulations. Specifically, as more learning and training shifts\nfrom traditional classrooms to online environments, an emo-\ntional video may have less (or perhaps more) success in\narousing affect and engendering subsequent empathic con-\ncern. In addition, it is worth assessing the generalizability of\nthe effect shown here; will it be observed among a less\nTable 1.

To\naddress these questions, a second study was conducted.\nAs described above, Study 2 was designed to reassess the first\nhypothesis in an online environment with a different partici-\npant population.To do this, the following method was engaged.\nMethod\nParticipants were 145 adults living in the United States and\nrecruited via Amazon MTurk to participate in the study in\nexchange for payment. The study was hosted online and\nadministered via Qualtrics. Participants reported a mean age\nHispanic, 6 Asian, 8 African American, 2 mixed ethnicity, 1\n\"Other\"). After completing a statement of informed consent,\nparticipants completed demographic items and the two trait\nmeasures (i.e., empathic concern,  = .96; and four-item per-\nceptions of police bias,  = .91), after which they were ran-\ndomly assigned to view either the control (n = 61) or\nexperimental (n = 84) version of the video. After viewing the\nvideo, participants reported their EFB using the same six-\nitem measure as in Study 1 ( = .98) and then immediately\nlistened to the audio recording of Speaker 1 (Frank) featured\nin the first study. Finally, they completed the seven-item state\nempathic concern measure in relation to Speaker 1 ( = .81).\nResults\nAs before, all potential covariates except age (i.e., PPRB,\ntrait empathic concern, and gender) were significantly cor-\nrelated with ECS1 (see Table 2). Consequently, age was\nagain dropped from the analysis, and mediation models were\nagain estimated both with and without covariates. Unlike\nStudy 1, a series of independent sample t tests indicated that\nthere were no significant differences between the control and\nexperimental groups with respect to PPRB, gender, or trait\nempathic concern; thus, no statistical controls were imple-\nmented in the model without covariates.\nTo test whether the emotional video had a mediated effect\nestimated using unstandardized coefficients and bootstrap-\nping with 10,000 resamples.

Although the size of this effect was reduced\nTable 2. Correlations Among and Descriptive Statistics for Study 2 Variables.\nM (SD), range ECS1 EFB EC PPRB Gender Age\nNote. For Study 2, n = 145. All variables are scored such that larger values indicate increased levels of the construct.

Gender: 1 = male; 2 = female.\nin the controlled model, it nevertheless remained statistically\nsignificant, thereby indicating that individual differences\ncorrelated with empathic concern cannot fully explain the\nobserved differences in participants' empathic reactions to\nFrank's story of race-based discrimination.\nGeneral Discussion\nFive years ago, Lam et al. (2011) noted that very little was\nknown about reliably increasing affective empathy in students\nand trainees. Since that time, research has pointed to several\ndifferent methods that can increase empathic concern through\npractice, negative affect arousal, or positive affect arousal.\nDespite the uniformly small effect sizes of such interventions,\nthe present research sought to assess the reliability and poten-\ntial boundary conditions of one such intervention--a brief\nemotional video featuring a boy diagnosed with cancer.\nStudy 1 demonstrated that the video succeeded in indi-\nrectly increasing empathic concern for an African American\nvictim of police abuse among an ethnically diverse student\nsample. When controlling for three relevant trait characteris-\ntics (i.e., perceptions of police racial bias, gender, and trait\nempathic concern), participants who viewed the emotional\nvideo reported more EFB with cancer, and greater subse-\nquent empathic concern for the victim of police abuse, com-\npared with participants who saw an unemotional version of\nthe video. When, approximately 10 min later, participants\nrated their empathic concern for a second African American\nvictim of police abuse, the difference across conditions was\nmarginally non-significant. This seems to suggest that the\npotency of positive affect arousal degrades over time, though\nnot as much as anticipated. This merely marginal degrada-\ntion suggests that the potency of positive affect arousal may\nbe somewhat sustainable.\nBy finding the same mediated effect in the same classroom\nsetting as previous research (Cargile, 2016), Study 1 demon-\nstrated the reliability of this emotional video to engender\nempathic concern for secondary others. In addition, analysis\nof covariance indicated that individual differences could not,\nby themselves, account for all of the between-group variation.\nThe use of control variables here thus further implicated the\nemotional video as a source of the increased empathic con-\ncern. This, however, still left open the question about whether\nthe effect of the video would replicate in other settings and\namong other populations. To address this question, Study 2\nwas conducted online among a population of near-racially\nhomogeneous adults. Again, the results were similar, thereby\nestablishing the consistency of this small effect.\nTogether, these studies clearly demonstrate that increas-\ning empathic feelings for a boy with cancer through use of an\nemotional video subsequently leads to a slight increase in\nempathic concern for an African American victim of police\ndiscrimination. The effect of this brief, convenient, positive-\naffect intervention is in line with other practice-based and\nnegative-affect interventions. Five years ago, we knew very\nlittle about the trainability of affective empathy. Today, we\nknow that there are perhaps several mechanisms by which to\nengender it and that the impact of these interventions appears\nto be limited.\nDespite the limited size of this positive-affect intervention,\nthe duration of impact may be longer than anticipated.\nAlthough the specific mechanism of affect arousal is unknown\nhere, it was hypothesized not to endure beyond a 10-min\nperiod because the possibilities that were initially imagined\n(i.e., oxytocin, short-term memory) degrade, decay, or are\ninterfered with in relatively quick succession. Thus, although\nHypothesis 2 was confirmed (i.e., the effect was indeed insig-\nnificant at Time 2), questions remain. In particular, it is worth\nconsidering what exactly constitutes the state of positive\naffect engendered here and, relatedly, how long it may last.\nPhysiologically speaking, positive affect is associated\nwith many different body states. It has been tied to lower\nsystolic blood pressure (Steptoe, Gibson, Hamer, & Wardle,\ndiurnal cortisol decline (Lai et al., 2005), and increases in\nsecretory immunoglobulin A (Hucklebridge et al., 2000),\namong other indices (see Dockray & Steptoe, 2010). Thus, it\nis possible that the emotional video engendered a host of\nbody state changes that endured up to 10 min.\nIn addition, the video may have also served as a prime for\nsubsequent empathic responding that was not subject to the\nlimits of short-term memory. As Custers and Aarts (2005)\nnote, \"positive affect [primes play] a key role in noncon-\nscious goal pursuit\" (p. 129), and consciously perceived\nprimes can show effects after a 24-hr period (Srull & Wyer,\n1980). Thus, it is possible that the video engendered a mode\nof empathic responding that was accessible both immedi-\nately after the presentation, as well as 10 min later. Future\nresearch should address plausible mechanisms of the some-\nwhat enduring effect seen here, as well as investigate possi-\nbilities of increasing its effect size. Although the small effect\nwas handily achieved (i.e., via a brief video) and is consistent\nwith other affective empathy interventions, it would be ben-\neficial to augment it, perhaps via longer presentations, differ-\nent subject matter, and/or different message characteristics\n(e.g., music, editing features, etc.).\nFinally, as with any study, there are limitations to con-\nsider. Although empathic concern can be measured behavior-\nally (e.g., Moran & Diamond, 2008) and physiologically\n(e.g., Silva & Gon\u00e7alves, 2011), only self-report measures\nwere used here. In addition, although the two testimonies\nabout police racial bias used here were comparable in all\nrespects, they were nevertheless two different speakers pro-\nviding two different testimonies. Thus, it is possible that\nspeaker differences triggered the differences in empathic\nconcern, and not the difference in time of presentation. It is\nalso plausible that some variety of compassion or distress\nfatigue (Klimecki & Singer, 2012) could have diminished\nempathic concern for the second speaker, as participants had\nalready heard similar story moments earlier. Despite these\n8 SAGE Open\nlimitations, the two studies described here have nevertheless\nsucceeded in further outlining the promise and possibility of\nengendering empathic concern for others, in others.\nAppendix\nSpeaker 1 (Frank's) Testimony\nWell, I was on my way to my second job. Once I arrived there and\nexited my car. I happened, I noticed a police car. He came around\nto the driver's side, told me to come out the car. I was like, \"For\nwhat? What do I do wrong?\" He was like, \"Step outside the car. I\ngotta take precautions. I gotta put you in cuffs.\" And I was like\n\"For what? What did I do wrong?\" Then he was like, \"Put your\nhands on the car. Spread your legs.\" He finally put me in hand-\ncuffs; then he told me to lay down on the ground. I said \"For\nwhat?\" He forcibly pushed me, my whole body on the ground,\nlay me all the way on the ground. And that's when back up had\ncame and the officer had put the taser to my neck. When I guess I\nwas completely down, that's when the officer mushed me down,\nyou know, dirty up my face. He never told me what I did.\nHe kept saying, \"Is your name such and such?\" I was like,\n\"No, that's not my name. Why you keep calling me that?\nThat's not . . . \" He said some name, I don't remember the\nname, but it wasn't mine and he had my license so it show\nwho I was. I think if you stop me, I should be able to ask you\nwhy you stop me and get an answer. So now you just racially\nprofile me because I'm Black. It's not the first time. It's like\nevery time an officer see me, they want to stop me. How they\nsearching now it's like you getting sexually harassed, humili-\nated, and everything 'cuz now you got everybody coming\nout, looking . . . Now you done brandished my name. You\ndone tarnished my name. Now, everybody's looking at me,\n\"oh! he a criminal!\"\nSpeaker 2 (Reginald's) Testimony\nWent to visit my mother and grandmother as I did every day.\nI saw the officer ride by. I gave my mother the keys and a\nkiss. I got in my SUV, I turned around and I proceeded to go\nhome. Put my turn signal on, pulled up in the front of the\nstore, and I had the blue lights on me. The officer got out . .\n. I got out of my vehicle and the officer got out his vehicle\nand asked me to get back in and I asked him why am I being\nstopped and he said get back in the vehicle. And I asked him\nwhy he stopped me again and he told me \"shut up!\" I think\nI have a right to ask you why am I being stopped. He stood\nthere for a minute and he say, \"You know you're comin' out\nof a known drug area?\" I was like, \"My mother live in that\nneighborhood\" And I asked him, \"What does that mean?\nEverybody ride through a drug neighborhood is subjected to\nbeing stopped?\" \"You know, you didn't see me make no\nhand transactions, nobody walked up to my vehicle, you\nknow there's just no reason for it.\" So, I went to light my\ncigarette and he grabbed my left arm and pulled it out the\ndoor, when my arm was being bent back toward the back of\nmy vehicle. And I asked him, \"Why you putting your hands\non me?\" And I asked him what was my badge number and\nbefore I could get out \"badge number,\" I was tased. And I\nwas looking the opposite way, you know.\nIt felt like I was stopped because I was a Black man com-\ning out of a known drug area. So, uh, to me that's racial pro-\nfiling. There was police brutality happened to me for nothing.\nI didn't see the taser coming or nothing, I just felt it. And like\nI said, I urinated on myself, um, that was humiliating because\nthe peoples at the store was watching, and I'm sure they\ncould see. It was just a humiliating, probably the most humil-\niating day of my life.\n"
