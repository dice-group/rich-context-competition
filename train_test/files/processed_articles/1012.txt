Older adults are increasingly likely to experience cohabitation, or living together unmarried in an intimate,\nheterosexual union. In order to begin building a conceptual framework, we provide a descriptive portrait of older adult\ncohabitors, emphasizing how they compare to older remarrieds and unpartnereds.\nMethods. We used data from both Census 2000 and the 1998 Health and Retirement Study (HRS; Health and\nRetirement Study, 1998) to estimate the size and composition of the cohabiting population aged 51 and older. Also, using\nHRS data, we estimated multinomial logistic regression models to identify the correlates associated with cohabitation\nand remarriage (vs being unpartnered) among women and men who were previously married.\nResults. More than 1 million older adults, composing 4% of the unmarried population, currently cohabit. About 90% of\nthese individuals were previously married. We identify significant differences among cohabitors, remarrieds, and\nunpartnereds across several dimensions, including sociodemographic characteristics, economic resources, physical health,\nand social relationships. Cohabitors appear to be more disadvantaged than remarrieds, and this is especially evident\nfor women.\nDiscussion. Older cohabitors differ from individuals of other marital statuses, and therefore future work on marital\nstatus should explicitly incorporate cohabitation.\nTHE PREVALENCE of heterosexual cohabitation in the\nUnited States has increased enormously in recent decades.\nThe number of cohabiting couples grew by a factor of 10\nmillion (U.S. Census Bureau, 2001). Today, even though only\nabout 45% of all cohabiting unions eventuate in marriage, more\nthan half of all marriages are preceded by cohabitation\nMost of the public attention surrounding cohabitation, as\nwell as most of the research, has focused on younger adults,\nwho usually cohabit as either a prelude or an alternative to first\nmarriage (Smock, 2000). However, cohabitation is actually\nmore common among the formerly married than the never\nof the roughly 10 million individuals currently cohabiting, more\nthan 1 million are older than age 50. It is clear that the rising\nincidence of cohabitation crosses the age spectrum. Yet with\nresearch literature has ignored the cohabitation experiences of\nolder adults (Cooney & Dunne, 2001). Research on the living\narrangements of older persons (e.g., Angel, Angel, McClellan,\ncohabitation.\nThe objective of this study was to use Census 2000 data and\nnational data from the 1998 Health and Retirement Study to\ndescribe the characteristics of cohabitors aged 51 and older and\nto show how these individuals compare with their contempo-\nraries of different union statuses. As will be shown in the\nResults section, nearly all older cohabitors have prior marital\nexperience; that is, they are divorced or widowed. Conse-\nquently, we will emphasize comparisons across the previously\nmarried: cohabitors, remarrieds, and unpartnereds. In other\nwords, to explore the significance of union type, we will\ninvestigate how those who are formally remarried differ from\nthose who are cohabiting in informal unions. This research\ncontributes to an understanding of the antecedents and con-\nsequences of cohabitation in the later stages of the life cycle,\nissues that will become increasingly important to gerontologists\nas the number of older cohabitors continues to rise.\nBackground\nSeveral demographic processes are responsible for the\nincrease in cohabitation among middle-aged and older persons.\nA major cause is simple cohort replacement. Substantial\nincreases in cohabitation among younger adults first occurred\nin the baby boom cohorts. These people are now aging into\ntheir later middle-age years, meaning that an increasing share\nof older adults is likely to be favorably disposed towards\ncohabitation (De Jong Gierveld, 2004). Moreover, divorce rates\nhave been relatively high among these cohorts, and remarriage\nrates have decreased (Allen, Blieszner, & Roberto, 2000;\nCooney & Dunne, 2001), yielding more adults who are\nunmarried and available for partnering. Cohabitation is also\nmore common among Blacks and Hispanics than among non-\nand these groups are increasing as a proportion of the older\npopulation. In consequence, a smaller fraction of the older\npopulation will be married in coming decades, and a higher\nproportion is likely to be cohabiting. Because the older\npopulation is growing, this will produce an even greater\nincrease in the number of older cohabitors. There were just\nCensus Bureau, 2002). Although growth in this age group has\nbeen modest over the past decade, it is expected to accelerate\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2006 by The Gerontological Society of America\nIndeed, Chevan's (1996) estimates of cohabitation among\npersons aged 60 and older indicate that whereas fewer than\nmore than 1.2 million persons aged 50 and older were\nthese were aged 60 and older.\nLike the demographic trends, Americans' attitudes and\nvalues regarding cohabitation are changing. Research shows\na dramatically increased tolerance of unmarried cohabitation\namong both younger and older persons (Thornton & Young-\nDeMarco, 2001), a trend that appears to comprise both cohort\nand period effects. Well over a decade ago, Bulcroft and\nBulcroft (1991) reported that unmarried adults older than age\n60 were as interested in cohabiting as in remarrying. These\ntrends point to an increasing diversity of living arrangements\namong the older population that includes, notably, cohabitation\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, cohabitation likely has\na unique meaning and plays a different role in the life course\nof older adults than it does in that of younger adults (Chevan,\nand remarriage among older adults suggests that theories\ndeveloped to explain these behaviors among young and middle-\naged adults are inadequate as they ignore the significance of\nlife-course stage in structuring opportunities and outcomes\n(e.g., Bulcroft & Bulcroft, 1991; Bulcroft, Bulcroft, Hatch, &\nBorgatta, 1989). Similarly, the motivations for cohabitation\namong the older population are likely to differ from those of\nyoung adults.\nSeveral researchers assert that older adults, particularly\nwomen, are not especially interested in remarriage (Bulcroft\ndisincentives for remarriage are greater among older adults,\nwho are especially likely to have economic resources whose\nvalue may be undermined by remarriage. For instance, pro-\nvisions governing social security and pension receipt typi-\ncally depend on one's marital status. Also, adult offspring may\nencourage their parents to cohabit rather than to remarry in\norder to protect their estates (i.e., the offspring's inheritances).\nIn summary, there are important demographic and theoretical\nreasons for investigating the composition of the older adult\ncohabiting population and for assessing how this group\ncompares with other union statuses. Despite the growth of the\nolder population, which is increasingly composed of unmar-\nrieds who may enter into cohabitation, research on this topic\nis scarce and dated. For instance, Chevan's (1996) study of\ncohabitors older than age 60 relied on decennial census data\ncohabitors used census data from 1980. Not only were these\nanalyses conducted at a time when cohabitation was much less\ncommon, but both studies were also undermined by significant\ndata constraints, including the availability of only indirect\nmeasures of cohabitation and a very narrow set of sociodemo-\ngraphic correlates to explore. Until 1990, cohabitation had to be\ninferred from census data; respondents were not directly asked\nwhether they were currently involved in an intimate, hetero-\nsexual, coresidential relationship (Casper & Cohen, 2000).\nMoreover, Chevan's analyses compared cohabitors only to\nother unmarrieds; marrieds were excluded. A few recent anal-\nyses have incorporated cohabitation into studies of mental\nhealth (Brown et al., 2005) and repartnering following marital\ndissolution in The Netherlands (De Jong Gierveld, 2004)\namong older adults, but these studies do not describe the older\nadult cohabiting population and how it compares with other\nunion statuses.\nThe Present Study\nThe present study updates and extends the limited prior work\nin this area by drawing on two data sources. We will construct\na detailed portrait of older cohabitors, providing explicit\ncomparisons to those in other union statuses (i.e., marriage,\nremarriage, separation or divorce, widowhood, and the never-\nmarried state). By examining older adults' characteristics across\nthese union statuses, we will document the composition of the\nolder adult cohabiting population and the extent to which these\nolder adults are similar to (and different from) those in other\nunion statuses. We will investigate multiple features of older\nadults' lives according to union status, emphasizing factors\nthat were shown in prior research to be related to union\nstatus among older adults: (a) demographic characteristics,\n(b) economic resources, (c) physical health, and (d) social\nrelationships.\nDemographic characteristics. --Union status is associated\nwith individual demographic characteristics, including gender,\nage, and race. Union formation and dissolution processes differ\nfor men and women, particularly among the older population.\nThis is largely an artifact of the skewed sex ratio: Unmarried\nwomen outnumber unmarried men by a ratio of 2.5:1 among\nthe 55 and older population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2002: Table\n48). This imbalance is exacerbated by gender-specific mate\nselection strategies, whereby men tend to partner with younger\nwomen whereas women often partner with older men. These\ndynamics indicate that older men will be more likely to form\nand maintain unions than women. Indeed, older cohabitors are\nalso disproportionately men. Men compose only about 25% of\nthe elderly unmarried population but account for nearly 60%\nunmarrieds, age is negatively associated with cohabitation\npopulation, cohabitation is especially common among African\nAmericans and Hispanics (Raley, 1996). As the older\npopulation becomes more racially and ethnically diverse with\nthe changing composition of the American population and the\nlengthening life expectancies of non-Whites, there is no reason\nnot to expect that African Americans and Hispanics will\ncontinue to be more likely than Whites to cohabit. Among older\npersons, Blacks are more likely to reside in cohabiting unions\nthan Whites, but Hispanics do not differ from Whites (Chevan,\nEconomic resources. --Among younger persons (especially\nmen), economic stability is associated with marriage versus\nManning, & Porter, 2005; Xie, Raymo, Goyette, & Thornton,\n2003). Cohabitation is particularly common among those with\nlower levels of education, although its popularity has increased\namong individuals of all educational strata. Among older\npersons, the association between education and cohabitation\nis unclear. Hatch (1995) documents a negative relationship\nbetween education and cohabitation, but Chevan (1996) finds no\nsignificant association. In the present study, we tested whether\neducation was negatively related to cohabitation among older\nadults, as it is for younger adults. Chevan's analysis of co-\nhabitation among older unmarried adults shows that poverty\nis positively related to cohabitation. Nonetheless, he also finds\nthat labor force participation is positively associated with\ncohabitation among men, perhaps because it serves as a proxy\nfor health and social integration. Or, economically active men\nmay be more attractive partners. In contrast, Hatch's analysis of\n1980 Census data indicates that cohabiting older men are less\nlikely to be working and earn smaller incomes than either mar-\nried or single older men. Women exhibit a distinct pattern; co-\nhabitors have higher levels of employment than marrieds or\nsingles. Older cohabiting women report higher earnings than\nsingle women but lower earnings than married women. Addi-\ntional economic factors associated with cohabitation among\nolder adults include renting (vs owning) a home and receipt of\nPhysical health. --Despite being younger, on average, than\nmarrieds, cohabitors report poorer physical health (Brown et al.,\n2005). Relative to marriage, cohabitation may be selective of\nindividuals in worse health. Those in poor health may be less\nattractive as potential spouses, leaving these less healthy\nindividuals at risk of a cohabiting union, which typically\nrequires a weaker commitment from a partner. Among older\nmen, poor health is positively related to cohabitation versus\nbeing single (Hatch, 1995), perhaps because older men in ill\nhealth are seeking support. This finding is consistent with\nTalbott's (1998) assertion that older women are reluctant to\nassume the burden of caregiving that may follow from\nremarriage at older ages, particularly when men's tradi-\ntional familial obligation of economic provision ends in\nold age. Existing studies of caregiving, even those focused\non ethnic minorities among whom cohabitation is more\ncommon, essentially ignore cohabitation (e.g., Pinquart &\nSocial relationships. --There are competing hypotheses\nregarding the association between social relationships and\nThe compensatory hypothesis suggests that those individuals\nwho do not receive adequate support from friends and family\nmembers will be especially motivated to form a union to\nachieve support through an intimate partner. Alternatively, the\ncomplementary hypothesis states that those individuals who\nenjoy the highest levels of social interaction with friends and\nfamily will be most interested in--and effective at--forming an\nintimate partnership, which these individuals view as offering\nunique, nonoverlapping forms of support. Widows with close\nfriends are more interested than those without close friends\nin forming a new partnership, supporting the complementary\napproach to social relationships (Talbott, 1998). Additional\nsupport for this hypothesis comes from a study of dating among\nolder unmarrieds that documents a positive relationship\nbetween organizational participation and dating (Bulcroft &\nBulcroft, 1991). To the extent that social relationships enhance\nindividual well-being and promote social integration, we\nexpected that they would be positively associated with\ncohabitation. Religious commitment and affliliation are nega-\ntively associated with cohabitation not only because some\nreligions frown upon living together outside of formal\nmarriage, but also because religious persons tend to espouse\nmore traditional, conservative family attitudes that are dis-\napproving of cohabitation (Clarkberg, Stolzenberg, & Waite,\nrepartnering among older adults conceptualized the absence\nof religious affiliation as an indicator of individualism, which\nwas positively associated with forming a cohabiting union (De\nJong Gierveld, 2004). Older adults' relationships with their\nchildren may influence their own relationship trajectories. Close\nrelationships with children may weaken an older adult's interest\nin forming a cohabiting (or marital) union. Or, children may\npressure parents to avoid the legal complexities that would\naccompany remarriage and may suggest cohabitation as an\n1995). Indeed, Hatch contends that children actively discourage\ntheir widowed mothers from remarrying, and De Jong Gierveld\nposits that the parent\u00adchild relationship weakens following\nrepartnering. Widowed older women with children are less\nlikely than their childless counterparts to remarry, but chil-\ndren are not associated with older men's remarriage patterns\nIn summary, we expect cohabitors, remarrieds, and those\nwho were previously married but are now unpartnered (i.e., the\ndivorced and widowed) to differ in terms of demographic\ncharacteristics, economic resources, physical health, and social\nrelationships. Additionally, these union status differences are\nlikely to be distinct for men and women. We extend prior work\non remarriage following divorce or widowhood by including\ncohabitation as a competing risk.\nMETHODS\nWe used two sources of data. Initially, we drew on the\nCensus 2000 Public-Use Microdata Samples 5% sample to\ndocument the prevalence of cohabitation among older adults by\nage and union status. This basic census information provided\na point of comparison for our findings from the main source of\ndata we employed: the 1998 Health and Retirement Study\n(HRS; Health and Retirement Study, 1998). Designed to\nexamine health and retirement decision making as well as how\nolder adults and their families respond to declining health in\nlater life, the HRS is a nationally representative sample\nand earlier. Thus, at the time of the 1998 interview, respondents\nwere as young as 51 years old.\nour sample because we were unable to determine their current\nmarital status. Another 21 respondents were eliminated because\nthey reported being in same-sex partnerships (although sub-\nstantively of interest, the small number of cases prohibits\nmeaningful analysis of this group). Finally, an additional 681\nrespondents were excluded because they did not have a sample\nweight (typically because they were institutionalized). We also\nlimited our sample to individuals aged 51 and older, which\nresulted in the loss of an additional 922 respondents (i.e.,\nyounger spouses or partners of primary respondents), for a final\nMeasures\nUnion status. --HRS respondents reported their union status\nat the time of interview. Approximately 2.2% of the sample was\ncohabiting, yielding 437 cohabitors for analysis. About 48.7%\nremarriages, 9.9% (n \u00bc 1,948) were separated or divorced, and\nDemographic characteristics. --Gender was a dichotomous\nvariable (1 \u00bc women). Race/ethnicity was composed of four\ndummy variables: non-Hispanic White (reference), non-\nHispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic other race. Age\nwas coded in years. Previously widowed (a dummy variable\ncoded 1 for those whose marriage ended through death of the\nspouse and 0 for those whose marriage ended in divorce) was\ncontrolled for in the analyses that were restricted to the\npreviously married.\nEconomic resources. --Several indicators of respondents'\neconomic resources were included. Education was coded in\nyears, ranging from 0 (no formal education) to 17 (post-college;\ni.e., more than 17 years of education). Household income was\na constructed measure in the HRS data set that incorporated\nbracketed income responses using sophisticated imputation\ntechniques. It was logged to minimize the effects of skewness.\nA dichotomous measure indicated whether the respondent\nowned his/her home (1 \u00bc yes). Employment status was dummy\ncoded full-time employment (reference), part-time employ-\nment, unemployed, and not working. Retirement status in-\ndicated whether the respondent was retired (1 \u00bc yes). This\nmeasure was distinct from the employment status variable\nbecause some respondents were technically retired but working\nin a different job. We also included measures to tap receipt\nof Social Security and a pension (1 \u00bc yes). Health insurance\ncoverage is gauged by four mutually exclusive dummy\nvariables: private insurance (reference), Medicare, other in-\nsurance (e.g., Medicaid), and no insurance.\nPhysical health. --The activity of daily living (ADL)\nmeasure is a scale composed of the responses to 11 items\nasking the respondent whether, because of health problems, he\nor she has any difficulty with various ADLs (e.g., walking\nseveral blocks, sitting for about two hours, picking up a dime\nfrom a table). For each question, answers of yes are coded 1 and\nanswers of no are coded 0. Responses are then added together\nto form the scale. Alcohol measured whether and how much the\nrespondent drank. Those who indicated that they did not drink\nor have never drunk alcohol (more than 50% of the sample)\nwere coded 1; those who responded that they drank alcohol but\nless than once a week were coded 2; those who responded that\nthey drank alcohol at least once a week but not daily were\ncoded 3; and those who reported drinking alcohol every day\nwere coded 4.\nSocial relationships. --Social relationships were gauged by\nseveral measures. Neighborhood friends was coded 1 if the\nrespondent reported having good friends living in the neighbor-\nhood and 0 otherwise. Relatives in the neighborhood was coded\n1 if the respondent reported at least one relative residing in their\nneighborhood and 0 otherwise. (The term neighborhood is not\nexplicitly defined by the HRS.) Religiosity is a measure of the\nreported significance of religion in the respondent's life,\nranging from 1 \u00bc not too important to 3 \u00bc very important.\nChildren is coded 1 if the respondent reported having at least\none living biological child and 0 otherwise.\nAnalytic Strategy\nWe began by establishing the size and marital status\ndistribution of the older adult cohabiting population using the\nCensus 2000 data. These data provide a benchmark against\nwhich to compare the figures we obtained from the 1998 HRS.\nNext, we employed the HRS to compare older adults across six\nunion statuses in terms of several sets of characteristics that are\nrelated to union status, including demographic characteristics,\neconomic resources, physical health, and social relationships.\nBecause roughly 90% of HRS cohabitors were previously\nmarried (i.e., had been divorced or widowed), the most\nappropriate comparison group for ascertaining the significance\nof union type was not individuals in marriages but rather those\nin remarriages. Previously published literature (e.g., Bulcroft\naged and older adults' decisions to remarry following divorce\nor the death of a spouse, and we extended this line of inquiry by\ntreating cohabitation and remarriage as competing risks. Thus,\nour final set of analyses was restricted to those who were\npreviously married. Detailed comparisons by union type (i.e.,\ncohabitation vs remarriage) were examined separately for\nwomen and men. We estimated multinomial logistic regression\nmodels of the competing risks of being in either a cohabiting\nunion or remarriage (vs being unpartnered; i.e., being divorced\nor widowed) separately for women and men. Our objective is\nto describe the population of older cohabitors, so we are less\nconcerned about causal order here; the set of independent\nvariables likely includes both antecedents and consequences of\nunion type. This analysis shows most clearly how older,\npreviously married persons who cohabit differ from those who\nare remarried or unpartnered. These are critical comparisons\nbecause it is unclear whether cohabitation is better conceptu-\nalized as an alternative to marriage or to remaining unpartnered\namong older persons who have experienced divorce or\nwidowhood. The complex sample design of the HRS means\nthat the sample is not self-weighting. Thus, standard errors need\nto be adjusted to correct for design effects. Both descriptive and\nmultivariate analyses were conducted in Stata (StataCorp LP,\nCollege Station, TX) using the survey procedure to correct for\nthe complex sample design.\nRESULTS\nand older are currently cohabiting (, 2% of this age group; see\nTable 1). Age is negatively associated with cohabitation; most\nand 59. Among those who are at risk of cohabiting (i.e., the\nunmarried), 4% are involved in cohabiting relationships. For\nunmarrieds aged 51\u00ad59, the number of cohabitors is nearly 9%.\nA majority of older cohabitors are divorced or separated (71%),\nfollowed by widowed (18%), and never married (11%).\nHRS data show slightly higher percentages of older adults\ncohabiting. Among respondents aged 51 and older, 2% (n \u00bc\n437) are currently cohabiting. As in the census data, younger\npersons are more likely to cohabit. Among the unmarried,\nnearly 10% of those aged 51\u00ad59 are cohabiting; this decreases\nThis is consistent with the prediction that the number of older\ncohabitors will increase via the process of cohort replacement.\nAs is also shown by the census data, most HRS cohabitors are\ndivorced or separated (63%), followed by widowed (23%), and\nnever married (12%; these percentages do not equal 100%\nbecause marital status is indeterminable for 2% of the sample).\nTable 2 shows the weighted means of the variables by union\nstatus. As anticipated, older adult cohabitors are less likely than\nfirst marrieds and remarrieds to be White and are more likely\nto be Black. Cohabitors are also younger, on average, than all\nother groups except the divorced. Although cohabitors have\na greater likelihood of being employed full time, the household\nincomes of older cohabitors, first marrieds, and remarrieds\ndo not differ significantly. Also, older cohabitors are less likely\nthan either group of marrieds to own a house or to have health\ninsurance. About 13% of cohabitors have no health insurance,\nand another 25% rely solely on Medicare. Although cohabitors,\nfirst marrieds, and remarrieds experience similar levels of\nADLs (levels that are lower than those reported by divorced,\nwidowed, and never marrieds), cohabitors report significantly\nhigher average levels of alcohol consumption than any other\ngroup. In terms of social relationships, cohabitors do not fare\nespecially well. They are least likely of any group to report\nhaving friends or relatives in the neighborhood (although they\ndo not differ from the divorced in their reports of having friends\nor from remarrieds in their reports of relatives nearby). This\nsuggests that cohabitors are more isolated socially. Cohabitors\nalso report lower levels of religiosity than any other union\nstatus group. Not surprisingly, although cohabitors are slightly\nless likely than both groups of married persons to have living\nchildren they are much more likely than the never married to\nhave children. Taken together, cohabitors appear most similar\nto the divorced group, which is consistent with our decision\nto emphasize here comparisons among those who had been\npreviously married.\nThe remaining analyses focus on cohabitors, remarrieds, and\nunpartnereds who are divorced or widowed. Table 3 compares\nthese three groups separately by gender. Women are much\nmore likely to be unpartnered (73%) than are men (41%). Men\nare twice as likely as women to be cohabiting (6% vs 3%) or\nremarried (53% vs 24%). Among both women and men,\ncohabitors are more likely than remarrieds but less likely than\nunpartnereds to be previously widowed. Consistent with the\npattern shown for the full sample, remarrieds are more likely\nthan cohabitors to be White and older, regardless of gender.\nThe race/ethnic composition of cohabitors and unpartnereds is\nsimilar, although the former are younger, on average, than\nthe latter. Among women, remarrieds report higher household\nincomes, on average, than cohabitors, who in turn report higher\nincomes than unpartnereds. Among men, the household\nincomes of cohabitors and remarrieds do not differ, but\ncohabitors report higher incomes than unpartnereds. Remarried\nand unpartnered women are less likely than cohabiting women\nto be employed full time. Among men, employment patterns\nare similar for remarrieds and cohabitors, but unpartnereds are\nless likely than cohabitors to work full or part time. Cohabiting\nwomen are most likely to be without health insurance (16%),\nbut there are no union status differences among men. Women\nreport more ADLs than men, and unpartnereds report the\nhighest levels of ADLs. Alcohol consumption is higher among\nmen than women; it is also higher among cohabitors than\nany other group. Cohabitors tend to score lower than either\nremarrieds or unpartnereds on the measures of social relation-\nships, although reports of children are uniformly high across\nunion status and gender. Among cohabitors, women have\nhigher levels of religiosity than men, on average.\nTable 4 shows the multinomial logistic regression models\npredicting cohabitation versus remarriage among those who\nhave been previously married, estimated separately for women\nand men. The reference category for these comparisons is the\nunpartnered (i.e., the widowed and divorced). The patterns of\nassociation between demographic characteristics and cohabita-\ntion versus remarriage are similar for men and women. Those\nwho were widowed are less likely than those who were\ndivorced to be cohabiting or remarried. Older Blacks are less\nlikely than Whites to be remarried, but the probability of being\nin a cohabiting union is not associated with race/ethnicity. Age\nis negatively related to both cohabiting and being remarried.\nIn contrast, economic resources appear to be related quite\ndifferently to women's and men's union type. Education is\nnegatively associated with both cohabitation and remarriage\namong women, but it is not significantly related to union type\namong men. Cohabiting and remarried women, but not men,\nare more likely than the unpartnered to be unemployed. Among\nwomen, part-time employment and not working are more\ncommon among the remarried, whereas being retired is\nnegatively associated with remarriage. None of these factors\nis associated with cohabitation among women, nor are they\nTable 1.

All percentages are weighted,\nand HRS percentages are corrected for complex sampling design.\nrelated to men's union type. Women without health insurance\nare more likely to be cohabiting, whereas, among men, the\nabsence of health insurance is unrelated to union type. Alcohol\nconsumption is positively related to cohabitation among\nwomen, but it is not associated with men's union status.\nNeither the presence of friends nor of relatives in the\nneighborhood is associated with cohabitation or remarriage.\nAmong women, religiosity is negatively associated with\ncohabitation, whereas among men, it is positively related to\nremarriage. The presence of children is positively associated\nwith cohabitation and remarriage among men and with\nremarriage among women.\nDISCUSSION\nThe prevalence of cohabitation has grown dramatically in\nrecent decades, and this growth has been evident across all age\ncohabitation experiences of older adults have been largely\noverlooked (Cooney & Dunne, 2001). Combining data from\nportrait of older adult cohabitors that reveals both the\ncharacteristics of this group and how this group compares\nwith older adults in other union statuses.\nThe data reported here suggest that, in terms of social and\ndemographic characteristics, older cohabitors and remarried\npersons differ in many of the same ways that younger\ncohabitors and married persons do. Blacks are less likely to\nbe married. Cohabitors (particularly women) have lower\nincomes and are less likely to own their homes than are\nremarried persons. They are also more likely than remarried to\nuse alcohol. Finally, they score lower than older remarrieds on\nmost of the measures of social relationships used in this\nstudy, including religiosity and having friends and relatives\nwho live nearby.\nIn some respects, cohabitors compare favorably to the\nunpartnered. Cohabitors' household incomes are higher, and\nthey are more likely to be employed full time and to have\nprivate health insurance than are the unpartnered. On the other\nhand, cohabitors (especially women) are more likely than the\nunpartnered to have no health insurance at all. Cohabitors also\nscore lower than the unpartnered on all of the measures of\nsocial relationships used in this study, except having children.\nThe picture that emerges from these comparisons is one of\nfairly systematic disadvantage among older cohabitors, espe-\ncially in comparison to their remarried counterparts. As is the\ncase among younger persons (Clarkberg, 1999; Oppenheimer,\nchosen by individuals whose economic circumstances make\nmarriage more risky. This raises the question of whether\ncohabitation has similar consequences to remarriage for older\nTable 2.

Studies show, for example, that older married persons\n(especially men) are more likely than unmarried persons to\nengage in healthy behaviors (Schone & Weinick, 1998);\nresearchers do not know yet whether the same is true of\ncohabitors.\nThe disadvantage associated with cohabitation appears\nespecially pronounced among women, who may derive fewer\nbenefits than men do from cohabitation. Among men,\ncohabitors are more likely than unpartnereds to own a home;\namong women, cohabitors and unpartnereds do not differ in\nthis respect. Among women, the proportion of cohabitors with\nno health insurance is 3 times larger than that of remarrieds and\nunpartnereds; among men, there are no significant union status\ndifferences in this respect. Although cohabiting and remarried\nmen enjoy statistically similar high household incomes,\ncohabiting women report an average household income of\nroughly two thirds that of remarried women. It is therefore not\nsurprising that more cohabiting women than either remarried or\nunpartnered women are employed full time (among men,\ncohabitors and remarrieds are equally likely to work full time).\nTaken together, our findings indicate that union status may be\nmore consequential for women than men. Simply put, there are\nfewer union status differences among men than among women.\nAs researchers continue to explore the gendered consequences\nof remarriage, divorce, and widowhood, our results reveal the\nimportance of incorporating cohabitation into this research, too.\nThere are still many unknowns about later life cohabitation.\nCohabitation, of course, entails less commitment than remar-\nriage. Does this lesser commitment allow cohabiting persons to\n``bail out'' when their partners become infirm or disabled, and\ndo they take advantage of this possibility? Do older cohabitors\nshare their resources in the same ways that married couples do,\nor do they hoard their own because the union may be fragile?\nThis is important because cohabitors tend to have fewer\nresources per capita than remarried persons. To the extent that\ncohabitation is an alternative to remaining unpartnered, it may\nbe a key source of support for older persons. Similar to\nmarrieds, cohabitors presumably enjoy access to a regular sex\npartner. To the extent that cohabitation is a substitute for\nremarriage among the divorced and widowed, it may make\nolder adults' lives less secure and their support networks\nmore vulnerable to disruption.\nIn order to fully ascertain the implications of cohabitation for\npolicy and practice, researchers need answers to at least some of\nTable 3.

For some older persons, a cohabiting partner\nmay be a critical resource, providing help in times of need,\nmaterial support that alleviates the strains of poverty, and\nemotional support to assuage loneliness. Or the partner may\ndisappear just when the need for support is greatest. Until\nresearchers know more about what motivates older persons to\ncohabit, as well as the factors that predict entry into and exit\nfrom cohabitation, it is difficult to accurately assess the\nimplications of cohabitation.\nAs the older adult population continues to grow, and\nespecially as the baby boomers age into this group, it becomes\nincreasingly important that researchers assess the ramifications\nof cohabitation among older adults. Baby boomers were the\nfirst generation to cohabit in significant numbers as young\nadults, and consequently society can anticipate an increase in\nolder adult cohabitation as the boomers age into older\nadulthood. Unfortunately, baby boomers are not represented\nThe present study indicates that cohabitation among older\nadults is more common than researchers realized and is likely to\nincrease in the future. We are not alone in this prediction; others\nresearchers have noted that a declining share of older adults will\nbe married in the coming decades, and thus a larger share will be\nat risk for cohabitation (e.g., Allen et al., 2000; Cooney &\nformation and dissolution of older adult cohabiting relationships\nawait future research. In the meantime, the present analyses\ndemonstrate that cohabitors are a distinct group, comparable\nneither to remarrieds nor to other unmarrieds. As described in\nthis article, the ramifications of this emerging relationship form\nfor the well-being of older adults are not entirely clear. More-\nover, because we were not able to ascertain whether older adult\ncohabitors weighed the decision to cohabit against remaining\nunpartnered or getting remarried, we compared cohabitors to\nboth of these groups. Whether cohabitation typically operates as\nan alternative to singlehood or as a substitute for marriage is not\nreadily apparent, because cohabitors--especially women--are\nunlike those in other union statuses across several key\ndimensions, including several indicators of economic resources\nand social relationships. For this reason, future gerontological\nresearch would benefit from expanding the formulation of\nmarital status to include cohabitation so that researchers can\nbegin to uncover the implications of cohabitation for the health\nand well-being of older adults.\n"
