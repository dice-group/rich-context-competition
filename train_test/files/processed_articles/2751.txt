To avoid being\narrested she needed to pay a fine. Fortunately, Betty's nurse\naid got on the phone and the caller hung up (Olson, 2014).\nMillions of older adults, however, are not as lucky as Betty\nis. Indeed, governments, law enforcement agencies, and\nthird-sector organizations have long been interested in\nreducing the rate of financial victimization, but with little\nhard data to support any specific programs (Scheibe et al.,\nFinancial elder abuse is increasingly common (Dong,\n2014), and researchers have long been interested in what fac-\ntors help protect older adults against financial exploitation.\nWe define financial elder exploitation (FE) broadly in this\npaper as the illegal or improper use of older adults' finan-\ncial resources. Large population-based studies have, thus,\nexamined common correlates of financial elder abuse (U.S.\nGovernment Accountability Office, 2011), emphasizing\ndemographic variables such as age, race, and income (Beach,\nLaumann, Leitsch, & Waite, 2008). Functional depend-\nence--activities of daily living (ADLS) and instrumental\nactivities of daily living (IADLS), and some mental and\nphysical health diagnostic information (depression, current\ndiagnoses)--were also found to be related to elder financial\nexploitation (Acierno, Hernandez-Tejada, Muzzy, & Steve,\n2013). There has also been a growing interests in the link\nbetween cognitive variables such as memory and executive\nfunctioning, and financial elder abuse (Dong, 2014).\nAlthough the research on financial exploitation of\nolder adults has gained some attention, a parallel line of\nresearch has focused the relationship between cognitive\nability and financial behavior, such as investing. Based on a\nseries of studies in patients with mild cognitive impairment\nand moderate dementia, neuropsychological measures\nhave been linked to financial incapacity including arith-\nmetic abilities, executive functioning, and verbal memory\n(Griffith et al., 2003; Marson, Earnst, Jamil, Bartolucci, &\nskills as assessed by the WRAT-R calculation subtest was\nassociated with impairment in financial capacity in the very\nearliest stages of mild cognitive impairment (Griffith et al.).\nEven among healthy adults, researchers have shown that\nhigher cognitive abilities are associated with increased like-\nlihood to plan for the future and participate as investors in\nfinancial market (Cole & Shastry, 2009).\nNumeracy--usually conceptualized as the capacity to\nunderstand and manipulate basic mathematical concepts--is\na variable that has been reported to be important in a broad\nrange of decision-making contexts (Schwartz, Woloshin,\nBlack, & Welch, 1997). However, numeracy is a distinct con-\nstruct from basic calculation abilities and influences not only\nan individual's ability to \"do the math\" but also their engage-\nment, comprehension, and use of numeric information in\ndecision making (Reyna, Nelson, Han, & Dieckmann, 2009).\nA paper by Hung, Parker, and Yoong (2009) maintains that\nwhile numeracy and financial literacy have certain features in\ncommon, they capture different abilities, skills, and knowl-\nedge. The authors argue, therefore that, \"it is more produc-\ntive to keep general numeracy distinct from financial literacy\"\n(2009, p. 7). Numeracy, however, is not only a separate\ncapacity than financial literacy. After reviewing the literature,\nReyna and colleagues (2009) state that on \"the basis of stud-\nies that have controlled for education, intelligence, literacy,\nand other factors, we can be reasonably sure that numeracy\nis a separate faculty\" (p. 967).\nTypically, assessments of numeracy include an indi-\nvidual's ability to understand probabilities. For example,\nPeters and colleagues (2006) have reported that indi-\nviduals lower in numeracy are more susceptible to cer-\ntain biases in the decision making, such as being more\nsusceptible to framing effects in their medical decision\nmaking. These individuals are more likely to demonstrate\nthe \"denominator\" effect, that is, focusing on a numera-\ntor, but ignoring the denominator when estimating prob-\nabilities. Individuals lower in numeracy have also been\nreported to be more susceptible to mood effects, that is,\ndemonstrating overconfidence when in a positive mood\n(Reyna & Brust-Renck, 2014). Numeracy appears to be\nrelated to deliberative reasoning in the sense that infor-\nmation derived from numbers is more easily extracted\nand comprehended in high numerate individuals.\nIndividuals lower in numeracy have been reported to be\nleft with information that is less complete and less under-\nstood than in high numerate individuals. As a result, the\nlow numerate appears to be influenced by competing\nirrelevant affective factors (Peters et al., 2006). Ample\nresearch has demonstrated the importance of numer-\nacy as a protective factor in both the health and finan-\ncial domains. Individuals high in numeracy make better\nhealth insurance decisions (Hibbard, Mahoney, Stock, &\nTusler, 2007), and numeracy is an independent predictor\nof people's ability to choose a health plan (Hibbard et al.,\nto be less numerate than younger adults and therefore\nmay be at higher risk for poor decision making (Jenkins,\nAckerman, Frumkin, Salter, & Vorhaus, 2011).\nhighlighted the important link between numeracy and the\nability to understand, grapple, and utilize financial infor-\nmation. Their studies show that numeracy is related to the\nability to correctly answer financial questions, make bet-\nter financial decisions about their retirement saving, and\nmore likely to pay off loans and credit cards (Lusardi &\nargued that one way of protecting older adults from FE is\nto increase their financial knowledge (Gamble, Boyle, Yu,\n& Bennett, 2014). Despite this corpus of data, we know of\nfew empirical studies that have examined the link between\nnumeracy and financial exploitation among older adults.\nGiven earlier work linking financial capacity to mild cogni-\ntive impairment, it is, therefore, reasonable to predict that\nnumeracy may also be an indicator of risk in a nonclinical\nAssessment of financial exploitation has been done tra-\nditionally by a single-item measure. Realizing its limita-\ntion, researchers have developed a multiple-item interview\nquestions to better capture the complexity and diversity of\net al., 2010). Probably the most in-depth and comprehen-\nsive measure currently available, the Self-Report Measure\nof Financial Exploitation of Older Adults (the Older Adult\nFinancial Exploitation Measure [OAFEM]) is a 79-item,\nclient self-report measure that has been psychometrically\nvalidated in a sample of abused older adults (Conrad, Iris,\nRidings, Langley, & Wilber, 2010). The OAFEM covers six\ndomains of financial exploitation: theft and scams, abuse\nof trust, financial entitlements, coercion, signs of possible\nabuse, and risk factors. The wide variety of domains cov-\nered in the OAFEM makes the measure more likely than\nothers to detect potential financial exploitation that has\ntaken place within the past 12 months. These character-\nistics render the OAFEM as the best instrument for our\npurposes, which is the study of elder financial exploitation\nbroadly defined in a community sample.\nIn the current study, we interviewed a sample of commu-\nnity-dwelling older adults to identify risk factors for finan-\ncial exploitation. Previous work in elder mistreatment has\nfound that dependency, physical health, and mental health\nare important risk factors in elder mistreatment (see Wilber\n& Reynold, 1997, for a theoretical overview). We included\nthese variables and added executive functioning, general\ncognitive functioning, and numeracy. It was hypothesized\nthat lower scores on all of the cognitive measures will\nbe a critical risk factor for higher scores on the OAFEM.\nHowever, we were especially interested in the role that\nnumeracy may play in vulnerability to financial exploita-\ntion in this project.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA total of 201 community-dwelling adults aged 60 and\nolder were recruited from the Greater Los Angeles Area.\nParticipants were residents in Claremont and nearby cities\nrecruited from an existing participant pool, or with flyers\ndistributed to senior centers and retirement communities.\nof education; SD = 3.09). Mini-Mental State Examination\nMeasures\nThe OAFEM contains 79 items of exploitation statements\n(Conrad et al., 2010). Participants self-reported whether\neach statement had occurred to them within the past\n12 months. Positive endorsement received a score of 2, sus-\npicion of exploitation received a score of 1, and negative\nendorsement received a score of 0. Responses could range\nfrom 0, indicating no exploitation, to 158. As indicated by\nConrad and colleagues, the OAFEM is unidimensional,\nRasch person and item reliability were high, and fit of the\nNumeracy\nAn 11-item numeracy scale was included to assess numeri-\ncal literacy (Lipkus, Samsa, & Rimer, 2001). Most of the\nquestions assess basic calculation or probability. One point\nwas given for each correctly answered question, with the\nhighest possible score of 11.\nDependency\nThe Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADLS)\nwas used to measure dependency (Lawton & Brody,\n1969). Research assistants were trained to interview par-\nticipants about their ability to perform daily activities\nindependently. IADLS score was based on abilities in eight\ndomains of daily living, including ability to use a tele-\nphone, shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry,\ntransportation, medication adherence, and financial man-\nagement. Participants received 1 point for each domain in\nwhich they can handle the domain tasks; thus, the possible\nscore ranges from 0 to 8.\nPhysical health and mental health\nThe 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) includes\nsubjective physical and mental health questions rated by\nparticipants themselves (Ware, Kosinski, & Keller, 1996).\nScore range for the SF-12 is 0\u00ad100, with a lower score indi-\ncating poorer health.\nGeneral cognition: MMSE\nThe Folstein MMSE is a 30-item scale that will be used to\nscreen participants for cognitive impairment and to help\nstage level of impairment (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh,\n1975). Each item answered correctly received 1 point.\nExecutive functioning: Trail Making Tests A and B\nThe Trail Making Test A requires participants to trace a\nsequence of numbers while timed and can be used as a\nsimple measure of processing speed (Reitan, 1958). Trail\nMaking Test B requires participants to shift between two\nstreams of information and was found frequently to be\nimpaired in the LACEAFC data on victims of financial\nexploitation (Wood et al., 2014). Executive performance\nwas calculated as the difference of task completion time\nbetween part A and B (B - A difference), which adjusted for\ngeneral slowing with age (Bowie & Harvey, 2006).\nExecutive functioning: Stroop task\nThe color-word-interference task takes advantage of partic-\nipants' ability to read words faster than respond to colors.\nParticipants were asked to name the ink color of a list of\nwords; for example, the word green was written in blue\nink. The task measures executive functioning on inhibition.\nThe Delis\u00adKaplan Executive Functioning System (D\u00adKEFS)\nversion of the color-word-interference task was used (Delis,\nKaplan, & Kramer, 2001). This measure included the tra-\nditional color-word version and a more challenging color-\nword-condition version for four color-word-interference\nconditions in total.\nDemographics\nThe demographic questionnaire included age, gender, ethnic-\nity, education, marital status, and living situation. No identi-\nfying information such as name or social security was asked.\nProcedure\nThe study materials were part of a larger, ongoing NIJ\nfunded study on elder financial exploitation. The study pro-\ntocol was approved by the appropriate institutional review\nboards, and all participants provided informed consent.\nA 2-hr meeting session was scheduled for participants to\ncomplete the study individually at Scripps College or local\nsenior centers. Research assistants conducted interviews\nand assisted participants to complete a survey/interview\nbattery including the above measures. Time to complete the\nstudy varied from 50 to 120min, depending on the number\nof breaks taken and the relative speed of participants.When\nparticipants completed the battery, they were thanked and\ngiven $25 for their participation.\nResults\nOn average,participants' OAFEM score was 7.26,whereas\nthe median was 4.00. Our sample contained more women\npants were married or lived with a partner (see Table 1).\nEmpirically, no score has been identified as a cutoff point\nfor elder financial exploitation substantiation on the\nOAFEM. With the possible range of 0\u00ad158, a mean of\n7.26 indicated that few elder financial exploitation cases\nwere at severe levels. One can conceptualize the OAFEM\non a continuum with risk for FE and mild symptoms at\nthe low end and substantiated severe cases at the high\nend. Our sample of community-dwelling individuals\nwith a mean score of 7.26 clearly represents the mild end\nwith many individuals (64/201) endorsing no for all the\nAlthough the OAFEM distribution might reflect the\nnational incidence of 5% elder financial exploitation\n(Acierno et al., 2009), adjustments are required for statisti-\ncal analysis after examining the data distribution. Because\nthe distribution of OAFEM scores was strongly positively\ntions of linear regression analysis with the OAFEM as a\ndependent variable were not satisfied. When data are sub-\nstantially positively skewed, it is suggested to perform a\nlogarithmic transformation (Howell, 2009; Tabachnick &\nFidell, 2012). A small constant (one) was added to all par-\nticipants' OAFEM score because some participants, who\ndid not experience any of the 79 events, reported zero val-\nues of the OAFEM.The transformed log OAFEM produced\nimproved skewness and kurtosis values (skewness = 0.23,\nkurtosis = -0.98). Subsequent analysis, therefore, adopted\nthe log-transformation OAFEM as the dependent variable.\nTrail making tests and Stroop tasks also went through the\nsame logarithmic transformation due to the skewed data\ndistribution. The case number, mean, and standard devia-\ntion of each potential predictor, as well as correlations\nbetween predictors are listed in Table 2.\nThe first model included only demographic variables.\nMale participants scored higher on the OAFEM. A below-\naverage standard of living was related to higher OAFEM\nscore (Table 3). Numeracy was added to the second model.\nUnlike with the first model, more years of education was\nrelated to higher OAFEM score. Lower numeracy was\nassociated with higher OAFEM score above and beyond\nNumeracy remained a significant predictor even after\nother risk factors were entered into subsequent models. In\nModels 3 and 4, worse physical and mental health were\nassociated with higher OAFEM score, whereas younger,\nmale, and more educated participants also reported\nhigher OAFEM scores. In Model 3, controlling for other\nrisk factors, lower numeracy was still related to higher\nSimilar to the results from Model 3, lower numeracy con-\ntinued to be related to higher OAFEM score (R2 = 0.02,\nutive functioning were taken into account in Model\n4.

Higher scores\nrepresented lower dependency, better physical health, better mental health, better cognitive ability, longer time in completing executive functioning tasks, and higher level of numeracy.\nDiscussion\nWith millions of older adults experiencing financial exploi-\ntation (Acierno et al., 2010), it is vital to gain a better under-\nstanding of what protects them from FE. As expected, our\ndata reveal that numeracy plays a key role. High numeracy\nwas found to be a significant predictor of decreased risk\nafter controlling for other demographic variables. Less\nnumerate participants reported risk of experiencing finan-\ncial exploitation significantly more frequently. Importantly,\nnumeracy remained a significant predictor in the presence\nof other risk factors, including dependency, physical and\nmental health, as well as overall cognition. Our findings,\nthus, are aligned with those of Hung and colleagues (2009)\nand Reyna and colleagues (2009) that numeracy acts as an\nindependent factor in the medical and financial domain.\nIndeed, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper\nto illustrate the protective role numeracy plays in tackling\nfinancial exploitation.\nRecent research in numeracy has documented its\nimportance for decision making in a spectrum of contexts.\nIndividuals lower in numeracy, in general, are less likely\nto engage with numeric information and are less able to\nextract meaningful and precise information resulting in\nnumerate individuals have been reported to be more sus-\nceptible to certain biases in their decision making including\nincreased susceptibility to verbal versus numeric risk infor-\nmation, framing, and mood effects (Gurmankin, Baron,\nRenck, 2014). We propose that low numeracy presents as\na risk factor for financial exploitation because it may limit\nindividuals from understanding and engaging in delibera-\ntive reasoning. As such, individuals with lower numeracy\nmay be at greater risk for financial exploitation. Although\nour study provides preliminary support for this hypoth-\nesis, indirect evidence supporting our suggestion comes\nfrom a study by Fischer, Lea, and Evans (2013). Although\nthe authors did not investigate the role of numeracy, they\nargue that what distinguishes those who fall victim to scams\nfrom those who don't is the reliance on ineffective decision\ntechniques. In a similar vein, DeLiema, Yon, and Wilber\n(2014) reported that diminished cognitive resources can\nincrease the success of persuasion tactics used by fraudu-\nlent sales agents. As argued earlier, low-numeracy individ-\nuals are more likely to be the ones to engage in ineffective\ndecision techniques in the medical and financial domains.\nIt seems reasonable, thus, to argue that they also fail to use\nadequate decision techniques when dealing with possible\nfinancial exploitation threats. In an older adult sample, it is\nlikely that some individuals due to lack of education may\nhave never obtained a high degree of numeracy, whereas\nothers may have demonstrated capacity at 1 point, but\nhave declined. These subgroups may present with differ-\nent types of risk and may benefit from different types of\ninterventions.\nInterestingly, executive functioning was not related\nto financial exploitation in this sample. Executive func-\ntioning has been reported as a critical domain in other\nstudies of financial exploitation and we expected that to\nbe the case here as well (Wood et al., 2014). Executive\nTable 3.

In this relatively high-functioning\nsample, it may be that the tasks we chose were not sen-\nsitive enough to provide discrimination. It is also pos-\nsible that executive functioning emerges as a risk factor\nonly in more impaired populations. Indeed, in a previous\npaper, it was found that the Trail Making B measure was\nsignificantly lower among victim sample compared with\na control group; however, in that study, the substanti-\nated victims were lower functioning (mean MMSE = 23)\nThis study was designed to focus on community-dwell-\ning individuals who may or may not be at risk for current\nand future financial exploitation. We predicted that many\nof the individuals would show no risk and hoped that we\ncould find measures that discriminated a \"pro-dromal\"\ngroup similar to work relating financial capacity to mild\ncognitive impairment (Griffith et al., 2003). In our work\nwith substantiated FE victims, we have observed that by\nthe time an intervention has occurred by social services,\nmany had already suffered exploitation for years and been\nserial victims of FE. At that point, because of significant\nimpairment, only formal protections (conservatorship,\nfiduciary assistance, and power of attorney) could be\nused to minimize risk. In the current study, our focus has\nshifted to individuals who had a variety of levels of risk but\nwere generally lower than substantiated elder abuse sam-\nples because we believed that these individuals will most\nlikely benefit from intervention and be most amenable to\ninterventions.\nAs a result of this sampling decision, our current sam-\nple had low scores on the OAFEM. Conrad et al. (2010)\nprovide some guidance for characterizing severity. For\nexample, a difference between two scores can be safely\nassumed to be at different severity levels when it is two\ntimes greater than standard deviation, although most of\nour sample lacked variability. Additionally, it is difficult\nto pinpoint an exact cutoff for financial exploitation\noccurrence, as the instrument includes items that might be\nbetter categorized as risk than occurrence. The restricted\nrange of scores may have limited the ability for some rela-\ntionships to emerge, for instance, dependency and overall\ncognition were not significant predictors to elder finan-\ncial exploitation. However, we did replicate some previ-\nous findings including seeing a link between physical\nand mental health and experiencing mistreatment (e.g.,\nAcierno et al., 2009). It is also likely that different models\nof risk will emerge in different subgroups of older adults\n(cognitively intact, mild cognitive impairment, and clearly\nimpaired). For example, numeracy may well be a critical\nfactor in high-functioning seniors, but may play a minor\nrole among older adults with lower ranges of cognitive\nability.\nOther limitations of this study included sample com-\nposition, as our relatively highly educated, active sample\nof older adults is not representative of the general popula-\ntion of older adults. It is important to note that even in\nthis sample, risk for financial exploitation emerged. Future\nstudies should target more representative population. We\ndid not deliberately exclude cognitively impaired older\nadults, thus ended up with a small subset of our sample\nscoring lower on the MMSE (six older adults scored lower\nthan 23). Nonetheless, all participants were living indepen-\ndently in the community and arranged their own trans-\nportation to participate in the study. Moreover, although\nour data indicated numeracy to be a risk factor, we cannot\ninfer a causal relationship between numeracy and financial\nexploitation.\nIn summary, we provide evidence that it is feasible to\nevaluate risk in community samples using the OAFEM.\nAlthough overall scores were low, the majority of our sam-\nfind that variables associated with elder mistreatment con-\ntinue to demonstrate a significant relationship in our sample\n(physical health and mental health). Above and beyond our\nbasic model, numeracy demonstrated a significant relation-\nship to risk of financial exploitation, with lower numerate\nparticipants reporting higher levels of financial exploitation.\nThese findings are in line with other work indicating the\nimportance of numeracy in financial decision making.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Borchard Foundation for Law and\nfaculty research grant from Scripps College.
