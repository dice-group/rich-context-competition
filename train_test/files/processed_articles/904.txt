With respect to\nrisk of meeting criteria for the clinical dependence syndrome,\nestimated peak values for alcohol and marijuana were found\nat age 17\u00ad18. Peak values for cocaine dependence were found\nat age 23\u00ad25.

Most of the observed cases of cocaine dependence met\ncriteria for dependence within three years after initial cocaine\nuse.

By comparison, among per-\nsons who had tried alcoholic beverages at least once, about\none in 6 or 7, or 15%, had become alcohol dependent (An-\nthony et al. 1994). In the present study, we extend this look\nat the comparative epidemiology of drug dependence, but\nhere our focus is upon estimation of the age-specific and\ntime-specific risks of progression from first drug use to de-\npendence, separately for marijuana, cocaine, and (for com-\nparison) alcoholic beverages (hereinafter, `alcohol').\nPrior studies have conveyed estimates of age-specific\nrisk for first alcohol use and alcohol dependence, as\nwell as risk estimates for initiation of illicit use and de-\npendence on controlled drugs in general (e.g., Kandel\nearly onset of drug use and progression to initial and\nproblematic use of other drugs also has been studied in\nsome detail (e.g., Kandel 1985; Anthony and Petronis\nwhat is especially novel about the present study is its\nnew look at both the cumulative and instantaneous risk\nof drug dependence in relation to time elapsed since\nfirst use of marijuana and cocaine, with alcohol for\ncomparison.\nWhereas epidemiological studies of this type gener-\nally are regarded as valid sources of evidence, it is pos-\nsible that some critics might call into question the valid-\nity or reliability of drug dependence assessments\nobtained in large-sample survey research as compared\nwith what can be obtained via intensive clinical study\nof smaller samples (e.g., see Anthony et al. 1985; Brugha\net al. 1999). Nonetheless, at least with respect to the\ndrug dependence syndromes, recent empirical research\nprovides evidence that epidemiologic studies can and\ndo provide generally valid and reliable estimates of the\noccurrence of these conditions, as well as their corre-\nsponding ages of onset (e.g., see Prusoff et al. 1988; Lan-\naddition, the types of survival analysis we have per-\nformed with respect to drug dependence in the present\nstudy have many analogs in studies that other research\nteams have completed with respect to psychiatric dis-\nturbances outside the realm of drug dependence (Bres-\nIn this paper, we study the risk of transition from\nfirst drug use to drug dependence using two measures\nof risk: the \"cumulative probability\" and the \"instanta-\nneous\" hazard or time-specific risk of an event. De-\nscribed briefly, the cumulative probability for an event\nis the proportion of individuals in a population who ex-\nperience the event up to or through a specified time\npoint or interval (e.g., the accumulated probability of\nhaving initiated marijuana use by age 17). In contrast,\nthe instantaneous hazard or risk refers to the probabil-\nity of event occurrence within a particular interval of\ntime, given no prior event occurrence (Willet and\nSinger 1993). In the latter, the risk of becoming depen-\ndent on cocaine at age 25 is the proportion of respon-\ndents who become dependent while age 25, among\nthose who had not become cocaine dependent up to\nthat age. As defined, these estimates summarize the ex-\nperience of all persons in the study population.\nSo that the results of this study might be compared\nwith similar epidemiological evidence about other\nmental and behavioral disturbances (e.g., major depres-\nsion), we have depicted the risk of developing drug de-\npendence in two ways. First, we estimate the risk of de-\npendence on marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol for all\npersons in the study population, without regard to their\nuse of each drug. The resulting curves are directly com-\nparable to those that depict the developmental periods\nof risk for major depression or other psychiatric distur-\nbances (e.g., as offered by Eaton et al. 1989). Second, we\nrestrict the analyses to individuals who have used each\ndrug on at least one occasion, and we re-estimate the\nrisk of becoming drug dependent for every year after\nfirst drug use. These results are more akin to post-expo-\nsure induction or latency periods of risk, once a discrete\nexposure has occurred. DeWit and colleagues (2000)\nhave presented similar evidence on alcohol, based upon\na survey in Canada, but made no attempt to compare\nthe experience of alcohol consumers with the experi-\nence of marijuana and cocaine users.\nEvidence about the post-exposure periods of risk is\ncrucial whenever we seek to understand the epidemiol-\nogy of conditions for which a discrete exposure is re-\nquired, whether the exposure involves an infection, a\ntoxin or a drug, irradiation, or a traumatic life event.\nFor this reason, in this paper we also show estimates on\nthe developmental periods of risk for first exposure,\nmeasured as the age at which individuals start to use\nmarijuana, cocaine, and alcohol.\nMETHODS\nThe data for this study were gathered for the National\nComorbidity Survey (NCS). Detailed descriptions of\nthe NCS and its procedures for assessing drug depen-\ndence are provided elsewhere (Anthony et al. 1994;\nstudy sample is a stratified multistage area probability\nsample of community residents age 15 to 54 years in the\nnonistitutionalized civilian population of the 48 cote-\nrminous United States, and a supplemental sample rep-\nresentative of students living in campus group housing.\nCarefully trained interviewers collected the data under\nclose monitoring. The NCS achieved an 82.4% response\nrate, with 8,098 participants. This paper, and the NCS,\nfully comply with the Declaration of Helsinki and with\nresearch ethics regulations adopted and promulgated\nby the National Institutes of Health.\nData on illicit drug use and alcohol were obtained\nvia standardized questions adapted from the National\nHousehold Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) and the\nComposite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), a\nstructured diagnostic instrument administered by\ntrained interviewers (Robins et al. 1988; U.S. Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services 1993). Respon-\ndents were asked the age at which they used each drug\nfor the first time. In addition, for each drug, respon-\ndents were asked whether they had a particular prob-\nlem or group of problems, and the age when problems\nstarted. Regrettably, for tobacco use, the questions\nasked for the age at which the respondent started to use\ntobacco daily for a month. For this reason, it is not possi-\nble to study transitions from first tobacco use to depen-\ndence in any detail. For many tobacco smokers, daily\nsmoking is a manifestation of tobacco dependence. In\naddition, there were neither detailed questions about\nroutes of administration nor about separate dosage\nforms (powder cocaine HCl, crack, hash oil); hence, this\nstudy's estimates are averaged summary values across\nall dosage forms and routes of administration.\nDrug use initiation was made operational in relation\nto each respondent's answers to the standardized sur-\nvey question about the age at first use of each drug.\nDrug dependence was assessed according to the Diag-\nnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Re-\nvised Third Edition, DSM-III-R diagnosis criteria\n(American Psychiatric Association 1987), as made oper-\national in the University of Michigan version of the\nCIDI (UM-CIDI) described by Kessler et al. (1994). In\norder to qualify for drug dependence, the respondent\nhad to report at least three separate manifestations of\ndependence. The UM-CIDI assesses a range of clinical\nfeatures characteristic of drug withdrawal syndromes,\nas well as behavioral manifestations of dependence\nsuch as unsuccessful attempts to stop or cut down drug\nuse, continued use of drugs despite recognition of re-\nlated physical, psychological and social problems, and\nrole performance impairment. Final diagnoses for this\nstudy were derived via the CIDI algorithm and associ-\nated diagnostic computer programs, as were used in\nthe original NCS reports on drug dependence (World\nAppropriate statistical survey methods were used to\naccount for the complex survey design, such as cluster-\ning of respondents by sampling strata and unequal\nprobability of selection into the NCS sample. Survival\nanalysis methods were used to estimate the cumulative\nprobability of first marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol use.\nWe then estimated the risk for onset of use for each\ndrug, that is, the risk of first marijuana, cocaine, and al-\ncohol use during a specified year, given no history of\nusing that drug up to that time interval. In these analy-\nses, age is expressed in terms of years since birth.\nAll survival analyses were performed using the\nSTATA software (Stata Corp. 1999), and included Ka-\nplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative probability of\nprogression from first use to dependence on each drug.\nFor these analyses, we applied two developmental per-\nspectives: (1) time was measured chronologically in\nyears since birth; (2) thereafter, the time scale was set as\nyears since first use of each drug. To enhance the graph-\nical display of the estimated risk, we used non-para-\nmetric smoothing techniques such as a median kernel\nsmoother with cubic splines.\nInterpretation of evidence from survival analysis re-\nquires answers to the following questions: (1) What is\nthe origin for the X axis? (2) What is the time scale along\nthe X axis? (3) What is the outcome event under investi-\ngation? (4) What is the survival analysis estimate de-\npicted on the Y axis? and (5) Are there any noteworthy\nrestrictions? In this study: (1) The origin first is speci-\nfied as the birth year; next, it is specified as age at first\nuse of each drug. (2) The time scale is years of life. (3)\nThe outcome of interest is first occurrence of the depen-\ndence syndrome (i.e., age at which the full set of criteria\nfor dependence first were met). (4) The survival analy-\nsis estimates are (a) cumulative probability, and (b) age-\nor time-specific risk of dependence upon each drug. (5)\nIn the analyses of risk among users, the non-users have\nbeen excluded; otherwise, there are neither restrictions\nnor exclusions from the NCS sample.\nTraditional test statistics such as the 2 or t-test could\nnot be used to test for drug-related differences in the\nrisk of developing dependence due to the lack of inde-\npendence across responses (i.e., dependence on one\ndrug being correlated with dependence on another\ndrug). To address this issue, multivariate response pro-\nfile analyses were implemented via Generalized Esti-\nmating Equations (GEE); the GEE robust p-values are\nbased on methods that take into account the multiple\nintercorrelated responses (Liang and Zeger 1986; An-\nRESULTS\nFigure 1 depicts the estimated age-specific risk for first\nuse of marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol as a function of\nyears since birth, with the estimates based upon data\nspondents. The peak risk for initiation of drug use was\nestimated to occur at age 18 years for marijuana and al-\ncohol, with peak risk for cocaine two years later (Figure\n1). When studied in comparison with values for mari-\njuana and cocaine, the estimated risk for initiating alco-\nhol use is seen to have higher values, with earlier occur-\nrence, and is spread over a longer age span. An\nadditional feature of the data is the very small risk\nvalue for ages beyond 25 years: it has been very uncom-\nmon for Americans to start the use of these drugs in the\nlater years of life, as noted elsewhere (Anthony and\ntal period of risk for starting to use marijuana, cocaine,\nand alcohol is effectively completed by age 35\u00ad50 years.\nFigure 2 shifts emphasis from initial drug use to the\nonset of drug dependence, and depicts the estimated\nrisk for developing dependence upon marijuana, co-\ncaine, and alcohol, reflecting the experience of all per-\nsons in the population so that developmental periods of\nrisk for drug dependence might be compared with sep-\narately published periods of risk for developing major\ndepression and other psychiatric disturbances. Here,\nthe denominator of `at risk' experience is defined in re-\nlation to all people, without respect to their history of\ndrug-taking, and the numerator included 354 cases of\nmarijuana dependence, 220 cases of cocaine depen-\ndence, and 1,212 cases of alcohol dependence in the to-\ntal sample of 8,098 respondents. The highest risk value\nis observed for dependence on alcohol at about age 20\u00ad\n21 years; the peak risk value for marijuana dependence\nappears slightly earlier, at about 17 years. The esti-\nmated peak risk value for cocaine dependence occurred\nsome seven years later, at about age 24\u00ad26 years. For\nmarijuana dependence, the developmental period of\nrisk has virtually ended by age 30 years; very few cases\narise after this age. Not so with respect to cocaine de-\npendence, for which the period of risk extends to just\npast age 35 years. However, new cases of alcohol de-\npendence are observed to arise through the middle\nyears of adult life, as observed elsewhere (e.g., see\nTable 1 shifts focus to the experience of drug users,\nand shows the estimated cumulative probability of\nmeeting criteria for dependence, among users of mari-\njuana, cocaine, and alcohol, for specified age intervals.\nFor those who used marijuana at least once, the esti-\nmated cumulative probability of becoming dependent\nMost cases of dependence on marijuana occurred when\nusers were age 15\u00ad25 years old. In fact, the cumulative\nprobability of developing dependence on marijuana re-\nmained below 1% to age 14 years among users, but in-\ncreased sharply in the following 15 years and climbed\nto 9% by age 30 years. On the other hand, among per-\nsons who had used cocaine, the cumulative probability\nof cocaine dependence by age 45 years was estimated to\nthe estimated cumulative probability of cocaine depen-\ndence are seen to occur between ages 15 to 30, growing\nfrom roughly 1% to 18% during this period, thereafter\nwith modest growth at lower rates. Starting from age 20\nonward, the cumulative probability estimates for de-\npendence on cocaine exceeded values observed for de-\npendence on marijuana during the same developmental\ninterval. With respect to people who had used alcohol\nat least once, the estimated cumulative probability of al-\ncohol dependence by age of 55 years was about 20%\ndence on alcohol between ages 15 and 35 years.\nLike Figure 2, Figure 3 presents a graphical display\nof the developmental periods of risk for becoming de-\npendent upon marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol, but it\ndiffers from Figure 2 in an important respect: Figure 3\nFigure 1.

Risk is estimated here in terms of the one-year inter-\nval that separates one age stratum from the next age stratum.\nFigure 2.

Data from the U.S.\nhere in terms of the one-year interval that separates one age\nstratum from the next age stratum.\nconveys the experience of drug users only. When each\nstudy base is restricted to persons who have used each\ndrug, the risk for cocaine dependence peaks at age 23\u00ad\n25 years, somewhat later than estimated peaks for alco-\nhol and marijuana dependence, which take place dur-\ning the teen years.\nFigure 4 and its inset figure depict the estimated risk\nof developing dependence, with a restriction to users of\neach drug, and with a time scale that is set as years\nelapsed since first drug use. The X-axes for the larger\nfigure and for the inset figure express number of years\nsince first use, but each Y axis depicts a different aspect\nof the epidemiology of drug dependence. The Y axis in\nthe larger figure depicts the estimated drug-specific cu-\nmulative probability of meeting dependence criteria\namong individuals who had used each drug, by\nelapsed time since first drug use. In contrast, the inset\nfigure depicts the estimated instantaneous or time-specific\nrisk of meeting dependence criteria for the first time.\nWhereas values in the larger figure grow to show how\nthe estimated probability of becoming dependent accu-\nmulates over time since the start of each drug user's ca-\nreer of use, the inset figure shows the risk of becoming\ndependent during each year since first use among those\nwho remained non-dependent to that year. While the\nX-axes in both figures depict time elapsed since first\nuse, this does not mean that the use of the drug has fol-\nlowed a specific pattern. As mentioned in the methods\nsection, no information is available to assess variation\nin the dosages used over time and their relation to the\nrisk of becoming dependent on each drug. For example,\nit is possible that a respondent had a first cocaine use\nand continued using cocaine for one year without be-\ncoming dependent, stopped using cocaine for three\nyears, and then resumed cocaine use in a more intense\nfashion that led him or her to meet full criteria of de-\npendence. The NCS data and the following analyses do\nnot allow disclosure of such differences in patterns of\ndrug involvement.\nAs reflected in both the larger figure and the inset,\nthere is continuing risk for experiencing cocaine depen-\ndence a decade or more after initial cocaine use. Both the\nlarger figure and the inset show less explosive develop-\nment of marijuana dependence among marijuana users.\nWhereas some 15\u00ad16% of cocaine users had developed\ncocaine dependence within 10 years of first cocaine use,\nthe corresponding values are about 8% for marijuana us-\nFigure 4's inset clarifies that the emergence of mari-\njuana and alcohol dependence is at roughly similar mag-\nnitudes for the first few years after initial use of these\ndrugs. Thereafter, cases of alcohol dependence continue\nto accumulate, but the risk of developing marijuana de-\npendence drops off, perhaps because illicit drug use\ntends to be a more transient experience than alcohol use.\nSome 10 years after first marijuana use, the instantaneous\nTable 1.

Risk for meeting drug-specific DSM-III-R criteria\nfor dependence on marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol, based\nupon users of each drug. Data from the U.S. National\nrisk of becoming marijuana dependent has reached val-\nues near zero and there is no more accumulation of new\ncases. The estimated instantaneous risk of meeting crite-\nria for alcohol dependence is about one percent per year;\nnew cases continue to mount (Figure 4, inset).\nThe inset figure within Figure 4 shows that cocaine\ndependence emerges quite early and explosively in the\ninitial years after first cocaine use; most of the observed\ncases of cocaine dependence met criteria for depen-\ndence within 1\u00ad3 years after initial cocaine use. An esti-\nmated 5.5% of cocaine users developed cocaine depen-\ndence within the first year of use; a corresponding\nestimate of 2.5\u00ad3.0% was observed for the period from\n1\u00ad3 years after initial cocaine use. Thereafter, the esti-\nmated instantaneous risk of cocaine dependence drops\nto about 1.5%, and subsequently to values between one-\nhalf and one percent, or lower. Some years after first co-\ncaine use, the estimated instantaneous risk of cocaine\ndependence generally is intermediate between the val-\nues reported for marijuana and alcohol.\nDuring the initial year of use of marijuana, cocaine,\nand alcohol, cocaine users were found to be about two\ntimes more likely to develop cocaine dependence, com-\npared with the risk of alcohol dependence among alco-\nGEE robust p  .018). In contrast, during the first year\nof marijuana use, the risk of meeting criteria for mari-\njuana dependence was not found to differ from the risk\nDISCUSSION\nThis report offers novel evidence about age- and time-\nrelated developmental periods of risk for first drug use\nand first drug dependence in the United States. It is of\ninterest that the risk for cocaine dependence among co-\ncaine users develops more explosively than the risk of\ndependence among marijuana or alcohol users, as con-\nfirmed in GEE multivariate response profile analyses\nthat took into account the statistical interdependencies\nof our three response variables. The risk of becoming al-\ncohol dependent persists for decades after first alcohol\nuse, whereas there appears to be a shorter developmen-\ntal period of risk for marijuana use and perhaps also for\ncocaine use.\nIn order to appreciate this study's new empirical evi-\ndence on the comparative epidemiology of cocaine,\nmarijuana, and alcohol, or to discuss the findings in de-\ntail, readers may wish to know more about the study's\nlimitations. Population estimates of this type necessar-\nily require the use of survey research methods, with at-\ntendant difficulties such as restriction of range to\nhousehold residents and the exclusion of homeless and\nincarcerated individuals. Nevertheless, as illustrated in\nthe Epidemiologic Catchment Area studies, overall\npopulation estimates for drug dependence do not tend\nto change substantially when the experiences of non-\nhousehold residents are taken into account, except per-\nhaps when there is a specific focus on inner city popula-\ntions. This is because the size of the U.S. household\npopulation is much larger than the size of the non-\nhousehold population, and a large fraction of the popu-\nlation lives outside of the inner city (e.g., see Anthony\nAnother limitation involves the assessment of clini-\ncal syndromes of drug dependence and determination\nof the ages at first drug use and first drug problems;\nthere is no bioassay for these syndromes nor for first\ndrug use. These circumstances necessitate reliance\nupon self-reported information. As such, these assess-\nments are subject to all of the potential errors and biases\nof recall and reporting that have been described in de-\nparticular concern is that events studied might have\ntaken place some years before the NCS interviews were\nconducted. In this context, accurate recall sometimes\nrepresents a challenging cognitive task for both the\nyoung and older adults. Nonetheless, during the years\nof young and middle adulthood, it appears that age at\nfirst use of illicit drugs is reported with reasonably high\ncoefficients of agreement (Prusoff et al. 1988; Wittchen\n2000). The NCS used a variety of measures to reduce\nbias and to promote the respondent's commitment to\ntelling the truth, but the cost of portable computer-as-\nsisted self-interviewing and programming was deemed\nprohibitive at that time. Hence, we acknowledge a po-\ntential limitation that can be overcome in future sur-\nveys, which might show greater (or earlier) risks for\nstarting to use drugs and for becoming drug depen-\ndent, to the extent that computer-assisted self-inter-\nviewing promotes more complete and accurate report-\ning of illicit and sensitive matters (e.g., see Lessler and\nAnother set of inter-related limitations involves the\nquestion of reliability and validity of the National Co-\nmorbidity Survey diagnoses, already mentioned in our\nintroduction to this paper. This set of limitations has\nbeen discussed quite thoroughly in past NCS papers\npublished in the Archives of General Psychiatry and else-\nlike to add a note of clarification: large-sample epidemi-\nological studies do not provide the same context for\nstudies of reliability and validity as one can create in a\nsmaller sample study where there might be multiple\nopportunities for repeated assessment and increasingly\ndetailed diagnostic cross-examination. For large-sam-\nple epidemiological research, the research team gener-\nally must knock on doors of randomly selected house-\nholds, and then follow disclosure and informed consent\nprocedures required to recruit a randomly selected\nhousehold member for the 1\u00ad2 h diagnostic assessment.\nEven when the sampled community residents are will-\ning to complete an initial 1\u00ad2 h diagnostic assessment,\nmany of them are not willing to repeat the assessment\nfor the purposes of a reliability or validity study. Fur-\nthermore, the participants willing to share more of their\ntime and effort for repeat assessments generally may\nnot be regarded as a random or representative sample\nof all participants, and there is considerable uncertainty\nabout whether resulting reliability and validity esti-\nmates actually hold for the population under study\nthis reason, there are no definitive estimates of reliabil-\nity or validity of the NCS drug dependence diagnoses\nthat are based on thorough standardized clinical direct\nexamination and re-appraisal of a proper random sam-\nple of the NCS participants. It is necessary to turn to re-\nliability and validity estimates from separately con-\nducted methodological studies in order to see that our\nstandardized drug dependence diagnoses in survey re-\nsearch generally have substantially better reliability\nand validity than the corresponding survey research di-\nagnoses for other DSM Axis I disorder categories (e.g.,\nSome readers might not be aware of `sample space'\nconstraints upon the evidence; we must confess that\nthese observed values characterize experiences in the\nU.S. household population during the last several de-\ncades of the 20th century, and might have no generaliz-\nability to other people, other places, or other times. For\ninstance, the sampling scheme for the NCS did not in-\nclude members of the population 55 years or over;\ntherefore, our analyses are not informative about the\nrisk of dependence on alcohol or other drugs for older\nsegments of the population. Based upon prospective\nevidence from the NIMH Epidemiologic Catchment\nArea research and other studies, the risk of developing\ndependence on alcohol and other substances for the\nfirst time after age 55 is quite low (e.g., Eaton et al.\n1989), and the risk of starting to use marijuana or co-\ncaine after age 55 is vanishingly small (e.g., Anthony\nand Helzer 1995). Hence, it is most likely that our study\nestimates would not be altered to any great extent if\nolder respondents had been included within the NCS\nepidemiological sampling frame.\nThe rate of transition from non-use to use and the\nrate of transition from use to dependence are not fixed\npharmacological properties of cocaine, marijuana, or al-\ncohol, and relatively little is known about `laws of epi-\ndemiology' that govern matters such as these. Unless\nexperimental laboratory studies have been misleading,\nthe transition rates experienced by community-dwell-\ning drug users are likely to have multiple determinants\nsuch as `host' characteristics, as well as local variation\nin availability of each drug, prevailing routes of admin-\nistration, dosage forms, and daily doses. For example,\npast and recent studies show that early onset of drug\nuse is a predictor of subsequent development of drug-\nrelated problems (Anthony and Petronis 1995; Grant\nand evidence from DeWit et al. (2000) links earlier onset\nof alcohol use to greater cumulative risk of developing\nalcohol dependence, while Obot et al. (2001) have\nfound that children of alcohol dependent parents are\nmore likely to be early onset users of alcohol and other\ndrugs. In addition, recent epidemiological evidence\nconverges with clinical and laboratory evidence in sup-\nport of the idea that general repertoires of behavior\nmight displace or prevent drug use (Johanson et al.\n1996). If so, the above-mentioned circumstances of envi-\nronment and behavior are among the conditions and\nprocesses that govern the transition rates. Elsewhere,\nwe have speculated and offered epidemiological evi-\ndence that features of the neighborhood and work envi-\nronment impinge on risk of alcohol and drug use and\ndependence, in addition to vulnerabilities linked with\npsychiatric and behavioral disturbances such as mood\ndisorders and antisocial personality disorder, with so-\ncial status, and with male sex (e.g., see Crum et al. 1995,\nnetic epidemiology confirms the role of inherited pre-\ndispositions toward drug-taking and toward drug de-\npendence, once drug use begins, apparently more so for\nmen than for women (e.g., see Pickens et al. 1991; Lyons\nThe estimates of this study, and from prior popula-\ntion studies of this type (e.g., Kandel and Logan 1984;\nulation averages over the experiences of all individuals\nin the study populations, including the higher and lower\nrisk subgroups delineated in the aforementioned stud-\nies. As such, these estimates have some utility in clinical\npractice and in research, akin to the utility of other aver-\naged values. These are `population norms' that clinicians\nmay use on a daily basis to guide decision-making about\nthe care and management of individual patients, that\npublic health workers can use to make decisions about\nappropriate timing of prevention activities, and that sci-\nentists may apply in planning for their future studies.\nIn future research, it should be possible to examine\nthese subgroup variations and markers of individual\nvulnerability in more detail. In the past, most attention\nin etiologic research on drug dependence has been\nfixed upon risks of first drug use or first appearance of\ndrug dependence. The perspective advanced in this pa-\nper is one that encourages greater attention to the tim-\ning of the transitions from first drug use to develop-\nment of drug dependence.\nOne clear application of this shift in perspective in-\nvolves genetically oriented twin studies. For the most\npart, twin studies of drug dependence have sorted the\ntwin pairs into two groups: pairs that are discordant for\noccurrence of drug dependence (one twin `positive' and\none twin `negative') versus pairs that are concordant\n(both twins `positive' or both twins `negative'). Instead,\ntwin studies can re-define concordance with respect to\nthe time elapsed from first drug use to first drug depen-\ndence (or first drug problem). Twins with exactly the\nsame elapsed time from first drug use to first depen-\ndence are concordant; otherwise, they are discordant.\nOne advantage of this analytical approach to defining\nconcordance and discordance is to increase the number\nof `discordant' twin pairs, with increasing precision of\nstudy estimates and statistical power to detect environ-\nmental influences upon vulnerability to drug depen-\ndence. Determinants of lag time from first use to each\ndrug to first dependence may become an issue in twin\nstudies and other research on etiology of drug depen-\ndence, just as `rapid' or slower transition from drug ex-\nposure opportunities to actual first use has become an\nissue for research on the causes of initial drug involve-\nment (e.g., see Van Etten and Anthony 1999; Wagner\nIn conclusion, estimates from this national survey\nrepresent novel evidence concerning the drug-taking\nexperiences of the U.S. population. Analyses of time\nelapsed from first drug use to first drug dependence\nshed new light on these experiences. Directions for fu-\nture research include more careful study of sub-group\nvariation in the average values reported in this paper,\nsuch as clarification of the mechanisms by which earlier\nonset of drug use is associated with later increased risk\nof drug dependence problems.\n"
