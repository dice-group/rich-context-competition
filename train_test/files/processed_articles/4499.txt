The classic\nsurgical correction of clubfoot has been\nabolished because the resultant poor func-\ntion and painful foot were thought to be a\nresult of the surgical procedure itself,5 and\nsuch treatment has been replaced by\nPonseti's method.6\nPonseti's method is a nonsurgical tech-\nnique that has been extensively proven to be\nsafer and more efficient than surgery for the\ntreatment of clubfoot.7,8 Ponseti's method is\nnow widely recommended as the gold stand-\nard for treatment of idiopathic clubfoot, and\nit has been approved on a worldwide basis.\nAlthough some other methods are still\nwidely applied in the clinical setting, such\nas Kite's method and the French method,9\nfew studies have compared the effects of\nthese different conservative treatment\nmethods for clubfoot, and no definitive con-\nclusions have been reached. The purpose of\nthis study was to determine whether Ponseti's\nmethod is the most efficient technique in the\nconservative treatment of congenital idio-\npathic clubfoot based on a meta-analysis of\nthe current scientific literature.\nMethods\nSearch strategy\nEmbase, Medicine, PubMed, and Web of\nScience were searched from an undefined\nThe following search terms were used:\n``clubfoot,'' ``Ponseti,'' and ``treatment'';\n((clubfoot) AND treatment) AND Ponseti).\nReferences of included articles and reviews\nwere also manually investigated to avoid\nomission. In cases of duplication, the most\nrecent or complete study was included. This\nmeta-analysis was performed according to\nthe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic\nReviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)\nstatement criteria.\nTwo independent reviewers assessed the\neligibility of the studies by reviewing the\ntitles and abstracts. The inclusion criteria\nwere as follows:1 conservative treatment of\npatients with clubfoot,2 comparison between\nPonseti's method and at least one non-\nPonseti's method,3 publication in English,4\nand enough data to calculate the odds ratio\n(OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The\nexclusion criteria were as follows:1 similar\nstudies including the same patients and2 lack\nof comparison between those similar studies.\nStatistical analysis\nORs were calculated to compare Ponseti's\nmethod and non-Ponseti's methods.\nHeterogeneity between the studies was\nconsidered statistically significant if the\nP value was <0.10; heterogeneity was also\nquantified using the I2 metric (I2 \u00bc 0%, no\nheterogeneity; I2 < 25%, low heterogeneity;\nheterogeneity was present, we used a\nrandom-effects model instead of a fixed-\neffects model.12,13 All P values were two-\nsided.

The\nresults showed that there were signiEcant\ndifferences in all three factors between Kite's\nmethod and Ponseti's method (Figure 3).

Several surgical tech-\nniques (soft tissue release, arthrodesis) have\nbeen used to correct clubfoot in the past few\ndecades. However, conservative treatment\n(physiotherapy, casts, and braces) is cur-\nrently considered the most effective method\nand has been widely accepted by paediatric\northopaedic surgeons. Surgically treated\nclubfoot may be associated with many\ncomplications, including scar contracture,\nneurovascular injury, wound infection, and\nlimb length discrepancy. Although conser-\nvative treatment is generally considered a\nTable 1.

This\nmeta-analysis suggests that the application\nof Ponseti's method appears to yield a lower\nlikelihood of the need for major clubfoot\nsurgery. Although we found no signiEcant\ndifference in relapse between Ponseti's\nmethod and non-Ponseti's methods, this\nmeta-analysis of data from eight compara-\ntive studies showed that Ponseti's method is\nsuperior to non-Ponseti's methods with\nrespect to better results and less need for\nadditional operations.\nLaaveg and Ponseti4 claimed that 89% of\npatients who underwent treatment using\nPonseti's method required no additional\nmajor surgical operations. Cooper and\nDietz24 reported that 78% of patients had\nan excellent or good functional prognosis in a\nretrospective study with a 30-year follow-up\nperiod after treatment by Ponseti's method.\nAlthough Ponseti's method is extensively\nrecommended and has become widely used,\nthis is the first meta-analysis to compare non-\nPonseti's methods with Ponseti's method and\nthe first meta-analysis to compare Ponseti's\nmethod and the French method.\nClubfoot was historically treated by a\nnonoperative casting method introduced by\nKite.19,25 The reported success rates were\nThe present meta-analysis showed signiEcant\ndifferences in the correction, relapse, and\noperation rates between Kite's method and\nPonseti's method (Figure 3). All three factors\nwere significantly lower with Ponseti's\nmethod than with Kite's method (P< 0.05)\n(Figure 3). Moreover, the treatment duration\nwas longer with Kite's method than with\ncasting was higher with Kite's method than\nConsidering all of these findings, Ponseti's\nmethod is a more effective conservative\ntreatment technique than Kite's method for\nidiopathic clubfoot.\nFunctional treatment, also known as\nFrench physiotherapy, was described by\nPaul Masse in the 1970s and subsequently\ndeveloped by several different paediatric\northopaedic surgeons.18,26 The general phil-\nosophy is very progressive and gradual\ncorrection by daily manipulation; various\nelements of the deformity are corrected\nseparately and in a speciEc order.18 In\ncontrast to Ponseti's method, a wide variety\nof results have been reported with French\nfunctional treatment.26\u00ad28 The complexity\nand duration of the French method might\naccount for this greater variation in out-\ncomes. The technical skill and experience of\nthe physiotherapist are major factors for\nsuccessful treatment of clubfoot. A gait\nanalysis of patients treated with the French\nmethod and Ponseti's method was per-\nformed.29 The joint range of motion in the\nsagittal plane was better after the French\nmethod (65%) than after Ponseti's method\n(45%). However, the present meta-analysis\nshowed no signiEcant difference between\nPonseti's method and French functional\ntherapy in terms of the correction, relapse,\nand need for additional operations.\nPonseti's method has been widely\naccepted as a conservative treatment regi-\nmen because of the reported good results\nduring long-term follow-up. The present\nmeta-analysis showed that Ponseti's\nmethod avoided major surgery in an average\nof 84.9% patients among different institu-\ntions, succeed in an average of 75.6%\npatients among different institutions, and\nachieved an excellent or good functional\nprognosis in an average of 91.1% patients\namong different institutions. However,\nbetter correction and a lower relapse rate\nare still desired. Brace application is a useful\nmethod for preventing relapse after correc-\ntion. Noncompliance with or nonadherence\nto the brace protocol has been considered\nthe predominant risk factor for relapse of\nclubfoot, which is still a challenging\nThe differences in bracing and the dur-\nation of follow-up among different studies\ncould have contributed to the differences in\nthe reported results; the importance of bra-\ncing in Ponseti's method was widely high-\nlighted, and the number of relapses with\nsurgical indications increased as the follow-\nup period progressed.30 An objective measure\nof clubfoot severity, such as the Dimeglio\nscore, was not available in each study\nincluded in this meta-analysis. The overall\nseverity of clubfoot treated may have differed\namong the different methods, thereby con-\nfounding the results. Additionally, Achilles\ntenotomy was commonly performed among\nthe studies included in this meta-analysis.\nThus, Achilles tenotomy also should have\nbeen considered a factor affecting the thera-\npeutic efficacy for clubfoot.\nSome limitations of this meta-analysis\nshould be noted. First, the heterogeneity was\nquite high in this meta-analysis. The above-\nmentioned characteristics may make the\npooled results less reliable. Second, some\nbiases may have been introduced because\nstudies in languages other than English were\nexcluded. Thus, we could not perform a\nuniform analysis from the quite different\nresults.\nThis meta-analysis has shown that\nPonseti's method can be successfully used\nto correct idiopathic clubfoot and is the\nmost effective of all conservative methods.\nPonseti's method is a safe, efficient conser-\nvative treatment method for clubfoot and\ndecreases the number of surgical interven-\ntions required.\nEthical approval\nAll procedures performed in studies involving\nhuman participants were in accordance with the\nethical standards of the institutional and/or\nnational research committee and with the 1964\nHelsinki declaration and its later amendments or\ncomparable ethical standards.
