The highest rates\nof hospitalization are in the Southeast and the lowest are in the\nNorthwest. Additionally, a hospital-based prevalence study in\nNorth Carolina [6] and a study of occupational populations in\nTennessee [7] found higher lifetime risks of stones in these\nSoutheastern states compared with a population-based study in\nMinnesota [1] and a survey of well members of an HMO in\nNorthern California [31.\nOur purpose was to examine rates of self-reported kidney\nstones, measured as lifetime prevalence, in two large cross-\nThese data provide a more complete picture of the demographic\n\u00a9 1994 by the International Society of Nephrology\nand geographic variability of kidney stones in the U.S. than\npreviously reported.\nMethods\nStudy populations\nthe second Cancer Prevention Survey (CPS II), described else-\nwhere [8]. Briefly, over 77,000 American Cancer Society volun-\nteers enrolled friends, neighbors or relatives living in households\nwith at least one member 45 years of age or older. In eligible\nhouseholds, all members 30 years old or greater were asked to\ncomplete a self-administered questionnaire on disease history,\nmedication use, dietary habits, occupational exposures and other\nhealth-related matters.

Kidney stones were listed on the CPS II ques-\ntionnaire as one of 24 diseases or conditions which had ever been\ndiagnosed by a physician. A subject who checked \"kidney stones\"\nwas considered to have had one or more stones based on\nself-report.

Age-, race- and sex-specific prevalence was calculated\nfor the entire study population.\nWe calculated prevalence for white participants by state, five\ncategories of latitude, and seven geographic regions (see Appen-\ndix). We were unable to perform similar calculations for minority\nparticipants because of insufficient numbers. Latitudes were se-\nlected to generally follow state northern and southern boundaries.\nPrevalence estimates were directly standardized to the age distri-\nbution (5-year age groups) of the entire CPS II cohort. Ninety-five\npercent confidence intervals (CI) for prevalence estimates were\ncalculated assuming that the responses to the survey were distrib-\nuted binomially [9].\nThe prevalence ratio (PR), a measure comparing the preva-\nlence of stones in one group of CPS II participants with that in a\nreference group (for example, the prevalence in Asians compared\nto the prevalence in whites), was used to assess differences in the\noccurrence of stones among demographic and geographic groups\n[101. Further, in examining associations with race, we controlled\nfor geographic region using a logistic regression model that\nincluded race, age (5-year intervals), and region. We tested the\nstatistical significance of a North-South trend in prevalence using\na five-level ordinal variable for latitude in a logistic regression\nmodel that also included age and race. A West-East trend in\nprevalence was evaluated in a similar manner using a four-level\nordinal variable for the northern regions (Northwest, North\nCentral, Midwest, Northeast) and, in a separate analysis, a\nthree-level variable for the southern regions (Southwest, South\nCentral, Southeast). All regression models had history of kidney\nstones (yes or no) as the outcome. Data were analyzed using SAS\nsoftware (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).\nTo determine how closely the prevalence estimates from the\nCPS II volunteer sample compare with estimates from a repre-\nsentative U.S. probability sample, we calculated age-, and sex-\nspecific lifetime prevalence of stones for white participants in\nNHANES II and compared these measures with those of CPS II.\nNHANES II data were analyzed using SUDAAN software (Re-\nsearch Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Caro-\nlina, USA) so that sample weights and other elements of the\ncomplex survey design could be considered in estimates of stone\nprevalence. Confidence intervals were calculated using the stan-\ndard error of the prevalence estimates. In comparisons with CPS\nII, an age- and sex-specific prevalence estimate from NHANES II\nwhose 95% confidence interval did not include the corresponding\nCPS II prevalence estimate was considered to be significantly\ndifferent at the 5% error level.\nResults\nParticipants in CPS II were largely middle-aged and white\n(Table 1).

Our results\nextend the findings of hospital discharge surveys [4, 5} which,\npresumably because of sparse data resulting from low survey\nresponse rates (less than 30%), failed to find statistically signifi-\ncant results despite large apparent differences between the South-\neast and the Northwest in hospitalization rates for stones. The\nhighest prevalence of kidney stones in CPS II was seen in six\nSoutheastern states: North and South Carolina, Georgia, Ala-\nbama, Mississippi, and Tennessee.\nMany factors have been hypothesized to cause kidney stones.\nOf these, only climate can be reasonably assessed through crude\ngeographic correlations. In 1945, a high incidence of stones was\nobserved among troops stationed in desert war regions [11]. The\nstones presented soon after transfer to the area and the incidence\nwas higher among those transferred during summer months.\nSoucie et al: Kidney stone prevalence in the US 895\nAge group\nFig. 1.

Prevalence of kidney stones among\nwhite women in CPS II, 1982. Estimates are\nstandardized to the age distribution of all\nCPS II participants.\nSubsequently, numerous reports from around the world of in-\ncreased stone rates during warmer months were published [12--\n17]. A high incidence of stones was also observed among Euro-\npean immigrants to Israel [18] and among members of the Royal\nNavy serving in Mediterranean and tropical zones [19].\nClimatologic factors most likely responsible for these findings\nare heat, associated with a more concentrated urine; and sunlight,\nknown to increase vitamin D production. Experimental evidence\nfor heat and dehydration comes from a study of immigrants to two\ntowns in Israel [20]. During a three year period, the prevalence of\nstones among the immigrants to one of the towns, who had been\nconditioned to increase their fluid intake, was only one-tenth that\namong immigrants to the otherwise similar town. The possible\nrole of sunlight in stone occurrence was suggested by Parry and\nLister [21], who measured urinary constituents of soldiers before\nand 10 days after transfer to a tropical climate, and found that\nurine calcium levels increased markedly only among soldiers\ntransferred during summer months. The authors, having consid-\nered other factors such as changes in diet, differences in water\nhardness, and fluid intake, concluded that the hypercalciuria\nresulted from sunlight exposure. Sunlight stimulates increased\nproduction of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol in the skin which, after\nconversion to 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D by the kidneys, enhances\nthe intestinal absorption of calcium. Subsequent studies found\nelevated levels of circulating vitamin D in patients with hypercal-\nciuria [22] as well as positive correlations between serum vitamin\nD levels and both urinary calcium and urinary oxalate excretion\n[23]. We reasoned that persons living in more southern locations\nin the U.S. would have greater potential exposure to both high\nambient temperature and sunlight. The consistent north-south\ngradient in lifetime prevalence of stones among both men and\nwomen in CPS II provides ecologic evidence that hot weather\nand/or sunlight may exacerbate stone occurrence.\nThe apparent gradient of higher risk in Eastern states (Table 2),\nseen especially in men, was expected in the Southeastern \"stone\nbelt\" states but not in the Northeast. This east-west gradient,\nalthough not as pronounced in the North as in the South, suggests\nthat factors other than climate may play an important role in the\ndevelopment of stones: possibly diet [24], drinking water [25],\nand/or comorbid conditions such as hypertension [26] and obesity\n[271. For example, oxalate-rich foods such as collards and greens\nand tea, are more popular in the Southeast than elsewhere.\nI\nPrevalence\ni Alaska\nHawaii\nAlaska LI\nHawaii LI\nSoucie et a!: Kidney stone prevalence in the US 897\nShuster et a! [25] provide evidence that drinking water is softer\n(contains less calcium and other minerals) in eastern states\ncompared to those in the west. A complete examination of these\nhypotheses is beyond the scope of the present paper.\nThe large size and geographic diversity of CPS II provides a\nunique opportunity to study the prevalence of stone disease by\nstate. Because we measured the prevalence of physician-diag-\nnosed stones rather than hospitalizations for treatment of stones,\nthe study avoids potential biases from regional variations in\nmedical treatment that limit previous national surveys [4, 5].\nWe cannot envision biases that might artificially create the\ngeographic variation observed in this study. It is possible that\nphysicians in the South might be more aware of stones and thus be\nmore likely to diagnose them than are physicians elsewhere. Most\nkidney stones are symptomatic [28], however, and the symptoms\nof renal colic are distinctive, arguing against this alternative\nexplanation. Further, the observed smooth gradient in prevalence\nfrom north to south is unlikely due to regional differences in\ndiagnosis.\nThe number of subjects who participated in CPS II in two states\nwas quite small and may have resulted in inaccurate estimates of\nstate-specific stone prevalence for those states. Volunteers in\nrespectively. In each remaining state, on the other hand, at least\nThe lower prevalence of stones that we observed among\nsubjects in the oldest age groups of men and women in CPS II and\nNHANES II was unexpected. This may reflect less complete\ndetection in past decades, lower use of physicians, or incomplete\nrecall. It might also reflect higher rates of mortality among stone\nformers perhaps due to differences in diet, lifestyle, or comorbid-\nity. However, none of the medical conditions known to be\nassociated with stones seem sufficiently common or lethal to\naccount for the decrease we observed. It is also possible that the\nlower prevalence among the oldest subjects reflects a birth cohort\neffect, since the incidence of stones appears to be increasing over\nthe last century in the U.S. [1, 5], Sweden [29, 30], and other\ncountries [31]. Increasing incidence would be manifest as a\ngreater frequency of stone occurrence among young compared to\nolder persons.\nIt has been previously noted that stones are more common\namong whites than blacks. Sarmina, Spirnak and Resnick [2], in a\ncomprehensive review and hospital-based study of stone occur-\nrence among blacks, concluded that stones were about three to\nfour times more common among whites than blacks. Our finding\nthat lifetime prevalence among whites was twice that among\nblacks is identical to that found by Hiatt et al [3]. Hiatt et a! [3],\nin the single published study of stones among Asian Americans,\nalso reported that stone prevalence among Asians living in\nNorthern California ranged from 1.0 to 5.2 percent among men\nand from 1.2 to 1.0 percent among women in the third to the\nseventh decade of age, respectively. Stone prevalence among\nAsian participants in CPS II was slightly higher than that reported\nby Hiatt et al. However, our data are consistent with their finding\nin California that Asian women had the lowest prevalence of\nstones and that the prevalence among Asian men was intermedi-\nate between that of white and black men.\nTo our knowledge, the prevalence of stones among Hispanics\nhas not been previously described. Among participants of CPS II,\nHispanic men and, to a lesser degree, Hispanic women were less\nlikely to report a stone diagnosis than were whites. The difference\nbetween Hispanic men and women relative to whites suggests that\nthe prevalence of stones among Hispanics may be influenced by\nthe white and black racial heterogeneity of the Hispanic popula-\ntion. The CPS II questionnaire did not ask subjects to indicate\nboth race and ethnicity and fewer than 10% of Hispanics did so.\nMore than thirty years ago, researchers noted the relative rarity\nof kidney stones among blacks compared to whites and Indians\nliving in Africa, and proposed a number of possible causes which\nhave yet to be tested [32]. Rather than genetic differences, these\ninvestigators favored environmental (especially dietary) causes\nincluding: (1) less intake and absorption of calcium among blacks,\nresulting in lower serum and urinary calcium levels [32, 33]; (2)\nhigher carbohydrate consumption among blacks leading to a\nhigher average urinary output [34] and a higher acid-ash residue\n[35]; and (3) nutritional liver damage among blacks which, by\nfailing to metabolize circulating estrogens, resulted in increased\nurinary citrate excretion [36]. More recent African studies attrib-\nuted lower stone rates in blacks to higher urinary sodium-to-\ncalcium ratios [37] or to low calcium content in drinking water and\nlimited consumption of dairy products [38]. Recent evidence for\nan apparent protective effect of calcium intake [24] would seem to\nrefute some of these hypothesized mechanisms.\nCompared to whites, black CPS II participants were somewhat\nmore likely to live in the Southeast, Hispanics in the Southwest\nand South Central, and Asians in the Southwest. However, in\nanalyses comparing stone prevalence in minorities to that in\nwhites, the odds ratios adjusted for region were the same as the\nunadjusted prevalence ratios. This indicates that the prevalence\nestimates themselves were not confounded by region.\nStudies which rely on voluntary enrollment may be biased by\nselective participation. Since CPS II was primarily a cancer study,\nit is unlikely that participation would be influenced by kidney\nstones. The comparison with the NHANES II probability sample\nrevealed remarkably similar prevalence estimates by age and by\ngender among whites. This finding addresses two main concerns:\nfirst, whether persons with stones are less likely to participate in\nvoluntary surveys; and second, how well a volunteer sample can\nrepresent the U.S. We believe that the validity of the contrasts\nbetween age, gender, and regional subgroups of CPS II partici-\npants, while not dependent upon representativeness, is strength-\nened by the results of this comparison.\nIn summary, we found that the lifetime prevalence of kidney\nstones varied markedly among a large cohort of U.S. residents\naccording to age, race, gender, and geographic location. Our\nresults supplement previously reported findings from hospital\nsurveys with low participation rates. These demographic and\ngeographic differences most likely reflect environmental, poten-\ntially preventable, causes. Further study of specific risk factors in\nCPS H are underway.\n"
