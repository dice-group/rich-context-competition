The ADA recently recommended that all\noverweight people (BMI 25 kg/m2) who are 45 years of age with prediabetes could be\npotential candidates for diabetes prevention, as could prediabetic people aged 25 years with\nrisk factors. In NHANES III, 2-h postload glucose concentrations were done only among subjects\naged 40\u00ad74 years. Because we were interested in overweight people who had both the 2-h\nglucose and fasting glucose tests, we limited our estimates of IGT, IFG, and prediabetes to those\n22.6% had prediabetes, and 5.6% had both IGT and IFG. Based on those data, we estimated that\nmillion had prediabetes, and 3.0 million had IGT and IFG.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Almost 12 million overweight individuals aged 45\u00ad74 years in the U.S.\nmay benefit from diabetes prevention interventions. The number will be substantially higher if\nestimation is extended to individuals aged 75 and 25\u00ad44 years.\nType 2 diabetes, which has devastat-\ning consequences on life expect-\nancy, morbidity, and quality of life\nand imposes large economic costs, cur-\nrently affects 16 million persons in the\nU.S.--a number that is projected to in-\ncrease (1\u00ad3). Despite major advances in\nthe treatment of glycemia, risk factors for\ncardiovascular disease (CVD), and other\ndiabetes complications, type 2 diabetes\nremains a chronic degenerative condition\nthat is difficult to treat (4). Prevention of\ndiabetes is thus a worthy public health\ngoal, especially because the diabetes pan-\ndemic is linked to contemporary lifestyle\n(5). Although literature from the last de-\ncade indicated that lifestyle interventions\nmay reduce the incidence of type 2 diabe-\ntes, evidence from randomized controlled\ntrials has been lacking (6).\nNow four recent randomized con-\ntrolled trials, performed across diverse\ncountries, settings, and populations, have\nprovided evidence that the progression\nfrom impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to\ntype 2 diabetes can be delayed or pre-\nvented (7\u00ad11). The most compelling evi-\ndence so far is from the recently published\nDiabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in the\nrandomized controlled clinical trial that\nincluded a diverse group of 3,200 adults\nand IGT. The trial found that modest\nweight loss and changes in lifestyle re-\nduced the 3-year incidence of type 2 dia-\nbetes by 58%, and that the drug\nThe DPP showed that it was possible to\nprevent or delay diabetes among individ-\nuals at high risk for diabetes, regardless of\nage, sex, and race/ethnicity.\nThe success of these major diabetes\nprevention trials is clearly a call for action\n(5). Although these trials focused on\nadults with IGT, the American Diabetes\nAssociation (ADA) has recently recom-\nmended that all overweight people (BMI\nabetes (IGT or impaired fasting glucose\n[IFG]) be considered potential candidates\nfor diabetes prevention, as well as over-\nweight younger individuals with predia-\nbetes and other risk factors (12). As a first\npublic health step, we need to determine\nhow many individuals in the U.S. may\nbenefit from such interventions. These\ndata will help assess resource needs, plan\nresource allocation, target the delivery of\ninterventions, and provide baseline data\nfor monitoring national diabetes preven-\ntion programs.\nIn our study, we wanted to estimate\nhow many individuals in the U.S. could\nbe eligible for diabetes prevention inter-\n                                                \nFrom the Division of Diabetes Translation, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health\nPromotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Stephanie M.

To do this, we projected\ntotal and strata-specific (e.g., age, sex, and\nrace/ethnicity) estimates of IGT, IFG, and\nprediabetes for the year 2000 using data\nfrom the nationally representative Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES III), which was\nMETHODS -- NHANES III was a sur-\nvey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized\nU.S. population that followed a complex\nsampling design, including oversampling\nof blacks and Mexican-Americans\naminations, and laboratory examinations\naged 2 months. Adults were randomly\nassigned to either morning or afternoon\nsessions for physical and laboratory ex-\naminations. Only those who participated\nin the morning session were eligible for\nthe oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)\nand fasting glucose test; therefore, we lim-\nited our analyses to this population. Of\nwho were randomly assigned to the\nmorning, 572 reported a previous diag-\nnosis of diabetes when not pregnant and\nperiod, a blood sample was obtained from\nself-reported diabetes. Of the participants\nage group to which OGTT was restricted.\nlenge, a second blood sample was ob-\nthat age group.\nWe assessed other information from\nthe participants, including demographics\nand risk factors for CVD. Being over-\nweight was defined as having a BMI 25\nkg/m2 (12). Dyslipidemia was defined as\nan HDL concentration 45 mg/dl in men\nor 55 mg/dl in women, a total choles-\nterol concentration 200 mg/dl, an LDL\nconcentration 100 mg/dl, or a fasting\ntriglyceride concentration 200 mg/dl or\nas having ever been prescribed medica-\ntion for high cholesterol (15,16). Hyper-\ntension was classified as having an\nelevated blood pressure (systolic 140\nmmHg or diastolic 90 mmHg) or as\nhaving ever been prescribed medication\nfor hypertension (17). Microalbuminuria\nwas determined by a urinary albumin\nmeant being a current smoker and having\nsmoked 100 cigarettes during one's life-\ntime.\nAside from adults with self-reported\ndiabetes, all analyses were conducted\nyears who received both the fasting glu-\ncose test and a 2-h glucose challenge.\nAdults without self-reported diabetes\nwere classified as having undiagnosed di-\nabetes if their 2-h glucose concentration\nwas 200 mg/dl and/or their fasting glu-\ncose concentration was 126 mg/dl\nto identify adults without diabetes who\nhad IGT (2-h glucose concentration of\nprediabetes, and IGT plus IFG was esti-\nmated among overweight adults aged\nwith prediabetes with people meeting\nDPP criteria for IGT (IGT plus fasting glu-\ndemographic and clinical characteristics\nlences of self-reported diabetes and being\noverweight, undiagnosed diabetes and\nbeing overweight, and prediabetes and\nbeing overweight to year 2000 population\nestimates (21).

Recent controlled trials on di-\nabetes prevention have confirmed that\nlifestyle changes such as diet, weight loss,\nand exercise as well as the drug met-\nformin can substantially delay or prevent\nthe progression from impaired metabo-\nlism to type 2 diabetes (7\u00ad10). Thus, sev-\neral million individuals could benefit\nfrom diabetes prevention intervention.\nFurthermore, in the process of identifying\nthose with prediabetes, we estimated that\nan additional 6.5 million persons with\nundiagnosed diabetes would be detected.\nWe compared the characteristics of\nindividuals with IGT in the population\nrepresented by NHANES III with those of\nindividuals with IGT recruited in the DPP\nDPP sample was younger and had a lower\nproportion of men, a lower proportion of\nnonminority groups, a higher mean BMI,\nlower mean lipid concentrations, a lower\nproportion of smokers, but roughly simi-\nmg/dl) and mean 2-h glucose concentra-\nNumber of overweight adults with prediabetes\nthe DPP population had a higher propor-\ntion of minority groups, the DPP research-\ners found that lifestyle and metformin\ninterventions worked equally well across\nall race/ethnic groups (10). Of interest is\nthe fact that people with prediabetes had\nremarkably similar characteristics to\nthose with IGT in the DPP trial (IGT plus\neral demographic and clinical variables.\nTo date, no diabetes prevention trial\nhas been conducted solely among persons\nwith IFG, although each of the recent tri-\nals included some persons with IGT who\nalso had IFG. Both conditions indicate\nprediabetes (12), and the two states over-\nlap somewhat, but are not identical. In\nour study, 25% of those with prediabetes\nhad both IGT and IFG; yet we found that\ndemographic and CVD risk factor profiles\nwere similar between those with IGT and\nIFG except for some differences in gender\ndistribution, mean weight, and mean\nwaist circumference. In the Hoorn study\n(24), the conversion rate from IGT to di-\nabetes and from IFG to diabetes was fairly\nson-years).\nThe risk of diabetes is strongly linked\nto contemporary lifestyle, which is\nheavily influenced by socioeconomic and\ncultural factors; diabetogenic lifestyles are\nalso ubiquitous (4,5). It is intuitive to ar-\ngue that a diabetes prevention approach\naimed at the entire population rather than\none targeted at a high-risk group should\nbe adopted. However, several factors sup-\nport an aggressive, DPP-like approach\ntargeting high-risk persons (defined by\nIGT or IFG in overweight adults). For ex-\nample, in the total population serum glu-\ncose concentrations were bimodally\ndistributed (19), and the threshold for di-\nabetes risk coincided with the onset of\nprediabetes. Using data reported in the\nHoorn study (24), we estimated that al-\nthough 8% of that study population had\nIGT, 40% of incident cases of diabetes oc-\ncurred among subjects with IGT, and al-\ncases occurred among subjects with IFG.\nIn addition, most, if not all, individuals who\ndevelop type 2 diabetes pass through IGT\nor IFG; this phase offers an opportunity to\nefficiently identify those at imminent risk\nof developing diabetes. Moreover, in our\nanalysis, the prevalence of certain CVD\nrisk factors (e.g., dyslipidemia and hyper-\ntension) among those with IGT or IFG\nwas very high; lifestyle interventions in\nthis group may help prevent CVD, in ad-\ndition to delaying or preventing the devel-\nopment of diabetes.\nFigure 1--Proportion of IFG, IGT, and IFG plus IGT among overweight (BMI 25 kg/m2)\nprediabetic individuals aged 45\u00ad74 years.\nTable 1--Prevalence of prediabetes, IGT, and IFG among overweight (BMI >25 kg/m2) adults aged 45\u00ad74 years, by race and ethnicity and by\nsex\nUsing ADA criteria Using DPP criteria\nPrediabetes (IGT or IFG) IGT IFG IGT and IFG\nIGT and fasting\nAll races\nNon-Hispanic white\nNon-Hispanic black\nMexican-American\nData are %  SEM (n in millions, calculated using the 2000 U.S. population). Adults with IGT (2-hour glucose concentration 140-199 mg/dl) and/or IFG (fasting\nglucose concentration 110\u00ad125 mg/dl were considered to have prediabetes (12). Also included in analysis were people meeting DPP criteria for IGT (9) *Estimates\ninclude those of racial and ethnic groups not listed separately.\nBenjamin and Associates\nThe NHANES III data posed some ad-\nvantages and disadvantages for our anal-\nyses. It was advantageous that the data\nwere nationally representative and had\nstandardized laboratory, clinical, and\nphysical measurements. However, the\nfact that limited data were available on\nracial/ethnic groups at high risk for diabe-\ntes (e.g., Native Americans), and that no\n2-h glucose data from adults ages 40\nyears and 75 years were available was\ndisadvantageous. In addition, we might\nhave underestimated the true size of the\nU.S. population at risk for diabetes be-\ncause the proportions of overweight and\ndiabetic adults have increased since the\nNHANES III was conducted (25). We\nhave estimated that in 2000, among over-\nmillion had IGT, 5.8 million had IFG, and\nThere is strong evidence for substan-\ntially delaying or preventing diabetes\namong overweight adults with IGT. The\nADA has recommended that all over-\nweight people aged 45 years with pre-\ndiabetes are potential candidates for\ndiabetes prevention (12). To what extent\nother people with abnormal glucose tol-\nerance (e.g., those with IFG) would re-\nspond similarly to subjects that\nparticipated in the clinical trials of pre-\nvention (7\u00ad11) is not clear. In any case,\nour estimates suggest that very large num-\nbers of people at risk for diabetes may\nbenefit from diabetes prevention inter-\nventions; our estimates may also be con-\nservative, because data were not available\nfor all age groups. The immediate chal-\nlenge is to translate research evidence for\ndiabetes prevention into practice and pol-\nicy. Questions remain about which\ngroups may benefit and by how much\nfrom diabetes interventions, the most ef-\nficient means to identify these groups,\nand the most effective ways to deliver and\nsustain interventions.\n"
