Individuals with atherosclerosis\nin the lower extremities are likely to have atherosclerosis\nin other arteries placing them at an increased risk of coro-\nnary heart disease, stroke, and all-cause mortality [3-6].\nIron has been hypothesized to promote atherosclerosis\nbased on its ability to catalyze the generation of highly\nreactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radicals, through\nFenton and Haber-Weiss reactions [7]. There is no consen-\nsus in the literature regarding the role of iron in the devel-\nopment of atherosclerosis [8]. Several studies have\nexamined the association of biomarkers of iron metabo-\nlism with measures of carotid artery atherosclerosis, with\ninconsistent results [9-13]. Few studies, however, have\nevaluated the association between biomarkers of iron\nmetabolism and PAD [8].\nThe purpose of the current analysis was to evaluate the\nassociation of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation\nwith the prevalence of PAD, assessed through the ankle-\nbrachial blood pressure index (ABI), using data from the\nMethods\nStudy Population\nity survey designed to select a representative sample of the\ncivilian non-institutionalized US population [14].\nin the interview and examination, we excluded 1,475 pre-\nmenopausal women, 846 participants with anemia (non-\nHispanic black men: hemoglobin <12.5 g/dL; other men:\nhemoglobin <13.5 g/dL; non-Hispanic black women:\nhemoglobin <11 g/dL; other women: hemoglobin <12 g/\ndL), 506 participants taking iron supplements, 10 partici-\npants with likely hemochromatosis (men: serum iron\nsaturation >60%; women: serum iron >175 g/dL, serum\nferritin >200 ng/mL, and transferrin saturation >60%),\n123 participants with an ABI  1.3 (a sign of severe arterial\nparticipants missing data for ferritin, 23 participants miss-\ning data for transferrin saturation, and 490 participants\nmissing other covariate information, the final sample\nwomen). Using alternative cutoff points for excluding par-\nticipants with anemia did not materially alter the results\nof the study. When participants excluded because of miss-\ning data were compared to those included in the study,\nexcluded participants were more likely to be older, non-\nHispanic black, and to have a higher body mass index,\nlower cholesterol levels, and a higher prevalence of diabe-\nthe National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention Institutional Review\nBoard. All participants gave written informed consent.\nData Collection\nData were collected during an in-home interview and a\nsubsequent visit to a mobile examination center. During\nthe in-home interview, information on demographic,\nhousehold income, education, smoking status, alcohol\nconsumption, and medication use was collected using a\nstandardized questionnaire.\nHeight and weight were measured and body mass index\n(BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by\nheight in meters squared. Systolic blood pressure was\ndetermined based on the average of 3 blood pressure\nmeasurements. Participants had a blood specimen drawn\nfrom their antecubital vein by a trained phlebotomist\naccording to a standardized protocol. Serum C-reactive\nprotein (CRP) was quantified using latex-enhanced neph-\nelometry, a high sensitivity assay. Alanine aminotrans-\nferase (ALT) and total serum cholesterol was measured\nenzymatically. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-\nterol was measured using a heparin-manganese precipita-\ntion method. Serum creatinine was measured by a kinetic\nrate Jaffe method. We calculated estimated glomerular fil-\ntration rate (eGFR) using the Modification of Diet and\nRenal Disease equation after aligning the serum creatinine\nconcentrations with the assay employed in the develop-\nment of the equation [15,16]. Individuals were classified\nWe defined diabetes mellitus as a self-reported history of\ndiabetes with concurrent use of anti-diabetes medication.\nMarkers of Iron Metabolism\nA detailed description of the measurement of ferritin and\ntransferrin saturation is available elsewhere [14]. Ferritin\nwas measured using a single-incubation two-site immu-\nnoradiometric assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,\nCA). The software used was not able to quantify ferritin\nlevels below 5 ng/mL; therefore, participants with ferritin\nlevels below 5 ng/mL (n = 2) were assigned a value of 3\nng/mL. The inter-assay coefficient of variation ranged\nbinding capacity were measured using a modification of\nthe automated AAII-25 colorimetric method on an Alp-\nkem Flow Solutions IV system (Alpkem, Inc., College Sta-\ntion, TX). Transferrin saturation was calculated as (iron/\ntotal iron-binding capacity)*100%.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPeripheral Arterial Disease\nSystolic blood pressure measurements for ABI determina-\ntion were taken via blood pressure cuff on the right bra-\nchial artery and both posterior tibial arteries with the\nparticipant lying supine on the exam table. These meas-\nurements were taken separately from the measurements to\ndetermine blood pressure. Participants with conditions\npreventing measurement in the right arm had the left bra-\nchial artery systolic blood pressure measured instead (n =\n8). ABI measurements were taken twice for participants\nRight and left ABI were calculated as the ratio of the mean\nsystolic blood pressure in the respective ankle to the mean\nbrachial systolic blood pressure in the arm. Participants\nwith an ABI <0.9 in either leg were considered to have\nPAD. The 0.9 cutoff value for ABI has 95% sensitivity for\ndetecting angiogram positive disease and almost 100%\nspecificity in excluding healthy individuals [17].\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses were conducted separately for men and post-\nmenopausal women. Participants were categorized into\ngender-specific tertiles of ferritin and transferrin satura-\ntion based on the weighted population distribution. Age\nand race-ethnicity adjusted means and percentages were\ncalculated by linear regression for continuous covariates\nand logistic regression for dichotomous covariates.\nWe calculated the odds ratios of PAD associated with ter-\ntile of ferritin and transferrin saturation after multivaria-\nble adjustment using logistic regression. Initial models\nadjusted for age (continuous) and race-ethnicity (non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American,\nother). Subsequent models further adjusted for house-\ncation, smoking status (current, former, never), alcohol\nconsumption (<1 and  1 drink per week), and body mass\nfurther adjusted for systolic blood pressure (continuous),\nhigh sensitivity C-reactive protein (log-transformed, con-\ntinuous), ALT (log-transformed, continuous), total cho-\nlesterol (continuous), high-density lipoprotein-\ncholesterol (continuous), estimated glomerular filtration\nlitus, use of blood pressure medication, diabetes medica-\ntion, aspirin, and hormone replacement therapy (among\nwomen). Tests for linear trend across tertiles of ferritin\nand transferrin saturation were computed by including an\nordinal variable with the median of each tertile of ferritin\nor transferrin in the regression models. Further analyses\nincluded ferritin and transferrin saturation as continuous,\nlog-transformed variables. For these analyses, we present\nodds ratios for PAD associated with a two-fold increase in\nferritin or transferrin saturation. The analysis of ferritin\nand transferrin saturation as continuous, log-transformed\nvariables was repeated after stratifying by total cholesterol\nlevels above and below 200 mg/dL to investigate the\npotential interaction with cholesterol levels as has been\nData were analyzed using SUDAAN (version 9.0; Research\nTriangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) to account\nfor the complex NHANES sampling design, including\nunequal probabilities of selection, over-sampling, and\nnon-response.\nResults\nThe geometric mean ferritin and transferrin saturation lev-\n81 ng/mL and 21.9%, respectively, for women.

Our find-\nings were consistent with a modest association of ferritin\nand transferrin saturation with PAD, particularly among\nthose with high cholesterol levels, but we cannot exclude\na chance association.\nvated iron levels, below the levels found in hemochroma-\ntosis, may increase cardiovascular risk. This hypothesis\nwas based on the observation that premenopausal women\nhad lower rates of heart disease compared to men and this\ndifference narrowed in concert with increasing iron levels\nas women went through menopause. The human body\ncarefully maintains iron homeostasis, as both iron defi-\nciency and iron overload are harmful [8]. Nearly all iron\nin the human body is bound to other molecules since free\nferrous iron is highly reactive and may catalyze free-radi-\ncal oxidative reactions. Free ferrous iron may be involved\nin the Fenton or Haber-Weiss reactions and catalyze the\nformation of hydroxyl radicals, which have been impli-\ncated in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol oxida-\ntion. As a consequence, it has also been hypothesized that\nexcess iron may be more harmful in those with elevated\nLDL cholesterol than those with lower LDL cholesterol\nWhile there is limited information in the literature on the\nassociation of iron with PAD, several studies have evalu-\nated the association of iron with carotid artery atheroscle-\nrosis. In the Bruneck Study of 826 men and women, high\nferritin levels were associated with greater progression of\ncarotid artery atherosclerosis after 5 years [11].

Conversely, a cross-sectional study of 206\nFinnish men [13] and a case-control analysis of 730 men\nand women participating in the Atherosclerosis Risk in\nCommunities (ARIC) study found no association\nbetween ferritin and carotid artery atherosclerosis [12]. In\nthe ARIC study, there was no evidence to support a syner-\ngistic interaction between ferritin and cholesterol; in fact,\nthe cholesterol stratified results indicated a lower odds\nratio of carotid atherosclerosis among those with higher\ncholesterol levels.\nThe association of biomarkers of iron metabolism with\ncoronary heart disease or stroke has been a source of sub-\nprospective studies found no evidence to support an asso-\nciation between biomarkers of iron metabolism and cor-\nonary heart disease [29]. Three prospective studies\ninvestigating the association of measures of iron metabo-\nlism and myocardial infarction have found evidence of\nsynergistic interaction with cholesterol levels [18-20], but\nother similar studies have failed to find evidence of inter-\naction [22,24]. Recently, a multicenter randomized con-\ntrolled trial was conducted with 1,277 men and\npostmenopausal women randomized to either a control\ngroup or to receive phlebotomy at six-month intervals to\nreduce body iron stores; at the end of the six year follow-\nup, all-cause mortality and the secondary endpoint of all-\ncause mortality plus nonfatal myocardial infarction and\nstroke were nonsignificantly lower in the phlebotomy\nThe findings from the present study need to be considered\nin the context of its limitations. Ferritin and transferrin\nsaturation are acute-phase reactants and may not accu-\nrately reflect body iron stores. To minimize this potential\nTable 2: Adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of peripheral arterial disease by tertile of and for a two-fold increase in ferritin\nand transferrin saturation stratified by gender\nTertile 1 Tertile 2 Tertile 3 p-trend Two-fold increase\nMen transferrin saturation <22.4%\nWomen ferritin <57 ng/mL\nWomen transferrin saturation <19.0%\n*Weighted percentage of population with peripheral arterial disease\nAdjusted for age (continuous), race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American, and other), household income\n(<$20,000 and  $20,000), high school education, smoking status (current, former, and never), alcohol consumption (<1 and  1 drink per week),\nAdjusted for variables in model 1 and systolic blood pressure (continuous), C-reactive protein (log-transformed, continuous), alanine\naminotransferase (log-transformed, continuous), total cholesterol (continuously), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (continuous), estimated\nglomerular filtration rate (<60, 6089, and  90 ml/min/1.73 m2), diabetes mellitus, blood pressure medication, cholesterol medication, aspirin, and\nhormone replacement therapy (among women)\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nsource of confounding we adjusted for CRP. NHANES\ncausation and selection bias and, therefore, we cannot\ndetermine causality in any observed associations. There\nwere relatively few cases of PAD, limiting our ability to\ndetect modest associations and subjecting our findings to\nsubstantial random variability. Also, when investigating a\npossible interaction between ferritin and cholesterol lev-\nels, the use of LDL cholesterol would have been preferable\nto total cholesterol, but fasting LDL cholesterol was only\navailable in 47% of our study participants. Despite these\nlimitations, the present study maintains a number of\nstrengths. NHANES data were collected using a rigorous\nstudy protocol with extensive quality control procedures\nand with technicians trained and certified in all data col-\nlection procedures. Additionally, the results are represent-\native of the US noninstitutionalized civilian population.\nConclusion\nIn a large nationally representative sample of US adults,\nwe found a modest association of ferritin and transferrin\nsaturation with PAD, particularly among those with high\ncholesterol levels, but we cannot exclude a chance associ-\nation. After stratifying the analysis by cholesterol levels,\nthe associations were also consistent with a synergistic\ninteraction of cholesterol levels with ferritin and transfer-\nrin saturation. Prospective cohort studies with adequate\npower to investigate ferritin-cholesterol interaction are\nneeded to fully characterize the relationship between\nbiomarkers of iron status, cholesterol, and measures of\natherosclerosis.\nAbbreviations\nPAD: peripheral arterial disease; ABI: ankle-brachial\nblood pressure index; NHANES: National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey; BMI: body mass index;\nCRP: C-reactive protein; HDL: high-density lipoprotein;\neGFR: estimate glomerular filtration rate; LDL: low-den-\nsity lipoprotein; ARIC: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communi-\nties.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAM participated in the analysis and interpretation of the\ndata and drafted the manuscript.
