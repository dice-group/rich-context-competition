Introduction\nThe predictors of relationship status are often viewed from an \"external to the\nperson\" perspective instead of from the viewpoint that these predictors are often\nreflective of intrinsic qualities of the people in the relationship. While a rela-\ntionship's status is surely not entirely determined by qualities intrinsic to the\npeople in that relationship, the results of this paper indicate that relationship\nstatus is best determined by examining the actual people in a relationship.\n2. Literature Review\nOne prominent approach to analyzing divorces/separations nowadays is the ra-\ntional choice model. In the context of relationships, this model posits that people\n*The following paper is a revised version of the author's MA thesis, which he completed in late '06.\nHow to cite this paper: Mastroniani, A.\nof Relationship Status with a Caveat on\nInterpretation.

Mastroniani\nwill stay in relationships when it is in their own best interest to do so and end\nthem when the overall cost of remaining in them exceeds the benefits of doing\nso, hence maximizing their utility. Using this logic, the positive relationship\nsometimes found between the household division of labor (i.e. specialization)\nand union stability is perceived as reflecting the greater costs incurred by exiting\na relationship in which the partners have grown increasingly dependent on each\nother due to increasing specialization [1] [2] [3] [4]. In regards to a wife's in-\ncome, this outlook has explained the sometimes negative association between\nsaid measure and union stability as reflecting the lessened costs for a wife to exit\na relationship when her income has risen [5]-[11]. As for the frequently found\nnegative relationship between age at marriage and union stability, this perspec-\ntive has argued that it reflects the longer payoff period a person has to find\nanother partner when he/she ends a relationship while young as opposed to\nwhile older [10] [12]. The negative relationship between female labor force par-\nticipation and union stability, meanwhile, has been explained as resulting from\nthe greater number of attractive partners made available to men via said factor\nIn addition to the findings mentioned in the preceding paragraph, there are\nothers to which the rational choice viewpoint has been applied. The negative re-\nlationship between union dissolution and investments in a relationship via\nthings such as time spent in union, children, and home ownership has been ex-\nplained as resulting from the greater costs incurred by exiting a union with more\ntimes found positive relationship between a couple having a boy and union sta-\nbility has been viewed as reflecting the greater costs for fathers to leave unions in\nwhich they have put more time and energy into due to their greater involvement\nwith a male child vis-\u00e0-vis a female child [18] [19] [20]. At the same time, the\nsometimes positive relationship which has been found between a wife's income\nand union stability has been deemed as resulting from the reduced benefit of ex-\niting a relationship in which a wife's income, if pooled, has benefited the entire\nfamily and relieved the economic pressure on the husband [8] [21].\nAnother major, related approach in the literature on relationships is to ex-\namine certain variables, particularly demographic ones, and to explain their im-\nportance in terms of what they provide instead of looking at them in terms of\nwhat they reveal about the person. One such variable is education, which some\nhave argued reflects communication skills needed to maintain relationships [9]\n[22] [23], while one study by an author named Ono argued that in specific re-\ngards to a wife's education, it only affects relationships through earnings [9]. In\nthat study, however, even when a wife's earnings were controlled for, the re-\nsponse of \"no information\" given for a wife's education had a statistically signif-\nicant positive effect on marital dissolution [9]. This finding may be caused by the\npossibility that women in that dataset who had little or no education preferred to\ngive no information on that variable, consistent with the social desirability phe-\nA. Mastroniani\nnomenon sometimes found in surveys [24] [25]. If so, Ono's claim that a wife's\neducation only impacts relationship status via earnings may be contradicted [9].\nThe resources available to a husband, meanwhile, as measured by things such as\npercentage of time working in a given period and his level of education, have\nbeen looked at as proxies for income/resources which can be made available to\nstabilize relationships [6] [9] [13] [16] [26]. In addition, age at marriage has been\ndescribed as reflecting less knowledge of proper role performance in marriage\n[16] and as a proxy for time spent gathering info as to whether someone is a\nsuitable partner [10]. In regards to domestic violence and other stressful events,\nthe negative relationship between these things and union stability has been ex-\nplained as being a result of the reduced benefits to staying a relationship which\nThe preceding two paragraphs, it should be noted, are not meant to be taken\nas exhaustive. Whether one identifies as Catholic, for instance, has been ex-\namined on the grounds that identifying oneself as such would reduce the like-\nlihood of union dissolution due to said religion's views on divorce [10] [30]. A\ncouple's degree of similarity in regards to things such as education and ethnicity,\nmeanwhile, has been looked at with the belief that greater dissimilarity leads to\ngreater conflict and hence less union stability [31] [32]. The effect of tax rates\nhas also been examined [33], as has the often found negative relationship be-\n[38], the effect of welfare reform [39] [40], and there are numerous other factors,\nas well. A complete overview will not be undertaken, however, for entire papers\nhave been devoted to such attempts [41] [42].\n3. A Different Perspective\nReferring back to the title, the caveat which will be mentioned is that this author\nbelieves that some of the aforementioned variables should be examined in the\nlight of what they reveal about the actual persons involved in the relationship.\nThis action should by no means be taken as an assumption that events which\nhappen during a relationship do not matter for its stability, however, for what\nactually happens during one surely plays some role in its eventual outcome.\nWhat it does indicate is that it is this author's viewpoint that things such as do-\nmestic violence, whether a partner has gone to jail, level of educational attain-\nment, etc., should be viewed primarily as indicators of the actual people involved\nin the relationship. Looking at unions as ventures/agreements that are usually\nbetween two parties which require skills such as the ability to communicate,\ncompromise, and think calmly in regards to the long-term future (and hence\ndelay gratification) to achieve long-lasting stability, it is hereby hypothesized\nthat people who are able to succeed in other endeavors that require at least some\nof these same skills, such as attaining a good paying occupation and saving\nenough over the long haul to buy expensive items such as a home, will be more\nlikely to achieve long-lasting union stability than those people who cannot. Un-\nA. Mastroniani\nfortunately, this hypothesis cannot be used to show cause, for it is a subjective\ninterpretation of available facts. It should be pointed out, however, that for what-\never reason, results obtained from data in this field, which if not completely\nnon-experimental is overwhelmingly so, are oftentimes referenced in a way that\nimplies that they reveal causation. All attempts will be made in this paper to avoid\nthat error, for this analysis is based on non-experimental data (i.e. survey data).\nBefore moving on, a few more points need to be made. Firstly, the \"types of\npeople\" argument has been made previously, as when authors such as Morgan\nand Rindfuss [43] and South and Spitze [16] argued that the positive relation-\nship between age at marriage and union stability exists because age at marriage\ncan be seen as a proxy for maturity. But as any even cursory survey of recent\njournal articles regarding this subject would reveal, that this focus is not the\npredominant one in this field today. Secondly, the conclusion that the assign-\nment of responsibility for relationship status should primarily be placed with in-\ndividuals is supported by many biological studies which have directly examined\ndivorce via behavioral genetics studies [44] [45] [46] and testosterone studies\n[47]. Thirdly, testosterone has been linked indirectly to marriage in numerous\nstudies that have demonstrated a link between it and things known to affect ma-\nrital stability (e.g. antisocial behavior, occupational attainment) [48] [49].\nFourthly, as noted by Johnson et al. [45], the genetic influence on personality has\nbeen well established [50], which is noteworthy considering that as some such as\nTeachman have noted [51], several personality traits have been linked to divorce\nvidual factors vis-\u00e0-vis external/situational factors is an old one, as when Rein-\nhold Niebuhr criticized many liberal thinkers for placing the blame for the ills of\nthe world primarily on situations and institutions rather than on human beings\nthemselves [56]. Given the recent dominance of rational choice models in this\nfield, however, it was decided to make this point of difference clear.\nThe dataset which will be used in this paper is the Puerto Rican Maternal and\nInfant Health Study (PRMIHS), which consists of 2763 personal interviews with\nmothers of infants drawn from two independent samples. Because this paper is\nattempting to determine what predicts the failure or sustaining of relationships,\nincluding marriages, only those mothers who gave information on union status\nand who did not respond that they never married or that they were widowed to\nthe question regarding current marital status will be examined. The sample size\nwill further be reduced by excluding people who gave no information on va-\nriables considered to be important for this analysis, thereby reducing the final\n4.1. Dependent Variable\nAll dummy variables were coded as either 0 or 1, as per convention, and all biva-\nA. Mastroniani\nriate regressions mentioned hereafter regarding dummy variables utilized probit\nregression.\nCurrent marital status: A dummy variable was created to deal with respon-\ndents who answered that they were divorced or separated from their partner at\nthe time of their interview. It should be noted that due to question wording, it is\npossible that some mothers had been in relationships which had ended and then\ngotten into ones which were still existent. If anything, this possibility would\nmake it seem as if relationships had been more stable than they actually were.\nLastly, there was a question in the PRMIHS survey asking about first union sta-\ntus, but not much data pertaining to that time in the respondent's life was avail-\nable. Current marital status was therefore examined instead.\n4.2. Independent Variables\n4.2.1. Variables Pertaining to Living Situation and Partner Quality\nLiving status and partner quality: Dummy variables pertaining to whether the\nrespondent had been living with the father of the focal child at time of concep-\ntion and to whether the respondent's partner had hit her or been to jail were in-\nteracted in these analyses. The latter dummy variable was initially entered by it-\nself into models to test the hypothesis that relationship stability is contingent\nupon the quality of one's partner. It was not entered by itself into final regres-\nsions, however, because a bivariate regression between that dummy variable and\nthe aforementioned one pertaining to living situation revealed that a 1 value for\nthe latter lowered the chances of a 1 value for the former by 12.2% (p < 0.02).\nIt should be noted that including the living situation dummy variable followed\nthe lead of Oropesa and Landale [29] on the grounds that relationships where\nthe partners lived together at time of conception would be more stable than ones\nwhere they did not. Additionally, whether a respondent's partner had hit her or\nbeen to jail was interacted because a bivariate regression revealed that an answer\nof \"yes\" to whether the respondent's partner had been in jail raised the likelih-\nood of the respondent having been hit by her partner by nearly 38.5% (p <\n0.0001). The decision to require that the respondent's partner had both hit her\nand been to jail was foregone, however, because this concurrence occurred in\nonly 13 cases in the final sample. Lastly, the interaction with a positive value for\ninstances when the respondent lived with the father at the time of conception\nand where her partner had not been to jail or hit her served as the base category\nby author's discretion.\n4.2.2. Partner Similarity Variables\nEducation: Dummy variables regarding whether the respondent had completed\nthe 11th grade at most and the father had completed 16 or more grades were in-\nteracted.\nEthnicity: Whether the father of the focal child was Puerto Rican and whether\nthe mother identified herself as Puerto Rican under ethnic identification were\nexamined. At first, a dummy variable dealing only with the father's ethnicity was\nA. Mastroniani\ncreated, but later analyses showed that results with this dummy were essentially\nidentical. The choice to use the dummy with both partners' ethnicity was thus\nmade solely by author's discretion.\n4.2.3. Age First Union - Age First Sexual Intercourse Interaction Variables\nAge first union and age first sexual experience: Dummy variables for whether\nthe respondent's first union occurred before the age of 27 and whether her first\nsexual experiences occurred at the age of 17 or later were created due to the logic\nof previous hypotheses regarding long-term thinking, patience, etc. These two\nvariables were not entered separately into final equations, however, but were in-\nstead interacted because a bivariate regression between them revealed that a 1\nvalue for the latter dummy variable lowered the chances of a 1 value for the for-\nmade to eschew continuous measures of age at first union and age at first sexual\nintercourse for the following reasons: 1) to diminish the impact of extreme res-\nponses given (e.g. in the final analyses, there were 22 values of 13 or less for age\nat first union when it was asked for in years and eight values of 11 or less for age\nfirst time when measured in years); 2) measuring age at these events as a conti-\nnuous variable seems to imply that there are important cognitive differences\nbetween people when there is none (e.g. how much more mature is a 25.3 year old\nrespondent from a 25 year old one, or a 14 year old from a 15 year old?); 3) using a\ncontinuous variable implies that there is a constant effect for every year added\nagewise, but results indicated that this condition was not present (i.e. not delaying\none's first union until 22 or 23 raised the chances of a positive value of the depen-\ndent variable more than entering one's first union before the age of 20).\nBefore moving on, it must be pointed out that it is of course possible that\nthese variables will be affected by things other than the aforementioned traits\nsuch as social reclusiveness. This trait, which would probably increase the res-\npondent's age at loss of virginity and presumably at first union, but the PRMIHS\nsurvey does not provide data suitable for this type of alternative analysis (i.e. it\ndoes not ask respondents about their social tendencies or habits). It is also possi-\nble that delaying one's first sexual experience until the age of age or later reflects\nadherence to traditional values, but again, this possibility cannot be further ex-\nplored due to data constraints. Furthermore, alternate forms for the variables\nforming the basis of this interaction which used different age cutoff points were\ncreated. Results for regressions with these variables serving as the basis for al-\nternate interactions were not substantially different. The connection between age\nat first union and age at first sexual encounter, meanwhile, remained strong\n17 served as the cutoff points for age at first union and age at first sexual expe-\nrience, respectively, by author's discretion.\n4.2.4. Stressful Events Variables\nDifficulty with bills and health of a loved one: Pertains to respondents who were\nA. Mastroniani\nunable to pay their bills and who had a loved one fall into poor health. In the\nsurvey which provided the basis for the Puerto Rican Maternal Infant and\nHealth dataset, respondents were asked if someone close had died, if a close fam-\nily member had been hospitalized, and if they had been unable to pay their bills.\nThe answers to these three questions will not be used as part of an index, as in\nprior research [29], but they will be used in this paper to form interaction va-\nriables. A dummy for instances where someone close was not well was created by\nmultiplying one dummy with a positive value for instances where a relative was\nin the hospital and another dummy for a positive value in cases where someone\nclose died after a bivariate regression showed that a yes response to one of these\nquestions raised the probability of a yes response to the other one by approx-\nwho could not pay their bills and who had someone close be not well was then\ncreated by multiplying a dummy for respondents who could not pay their bills\nby a dummy for instances where someone close to the respondent was not well\nafter a bivariate regression showed that a 1 value for the bills dummy raised the\nchances of a 1 value for the loved one's health dummy by close to 9.9% (p <\nThe interaction where the respondent could pay her bills and no loved one\nwas ill served as base category by author's discretion. Additionally, a different\ndummy variable regarding financial difficulties was created and it served as a\npart of interactions with the health of a loved one dummy also. Results for mod-\nels with these variables were essentially identical. Furthermore, previous research\nhad included whether someone close to the respondent had had problems with\nsubstance abuse [29]. A bivariate regression, however, revealed that a yes re-\nsponse to whether someone close had abused substances raised the likelihood of\na 1 value for the aforementioned dummy pertaining to a partner's having hit the\nquestion was thus not be used as a stressful event variable. In the same light,\nrespondents had been asked if they had been in a fight as an indicator of stress,\nbut a bivariate regression between this answer and the dummy pertaining to a\npartner having hit the respondent or having gone to jail showed that a yes re-\nsponse to one of these questions raised the probability of a yes response to the\nthus not used as part of a stressful event variable, either.\n4.2.5. Variables Dealing with Education and Money\nEducation and income: Dummies were created regarding whether the respon-\ndent had attained at least a Bachelor's degree and whether her combined house-\nhold income at time of pregnancy was at minimum 25,000 dollars. The decision\nwas made to interact these variables because a bivariate regression between them\nrevealed that 1 value for the education dummy raised the chances of a 1 value for\nthese dummy variables, it may be possible to determine whether it is increasing\nA. Mastroniani\nlevels of money or of education which has the stronger effect on union stability.\nAs for measurement decisions, it was decided to measure education and income\ndichotomously for reasons similar to the ones already given for measuring age at\nfirst union and at first sexual intercourse dichotomously. They are: 1) measuring\neducation at the interval or ratio level suggests that there may be differences be-\ntween people when there actually is none, at least not substantively (i.e. there\nmay be no meaningful difference between someone who drops out of school af-\nter 10th and someone who drops out of school after 11th grade); 2) there may be\nan important difference between people who complete a certain phase of\nschooling (e.g. college) and those people who merely begin it (i.e. different levels\nof diligence, rational long-term decisionmaking ability, etc.--also sometimes re-\nferred to as the Glick effect). 3) in regards to income, there is a possibility that\nthe effect of each additional dollar which a person possesses is not constant and\nthat instead there are instead meaningful thresholds which should be sought out\n(e.g. minimum monetary amount needed to pay rent).\nNo separate dummy variable was constructed for people who go on to com-\nplete Master's or PhD level studies due to the small number of respondents who\ndid so. Additionally, alternate dummy variables for income using different cutoff\nwith them did not differ substantially from the one presented here. Additionally,\nthere was no sure way to determine if respondents had dropped out of high\nschool or college once beginning it, thereby making it impossible to examine a\npossible dropout effect. Lastly, the interaction representing respondents who had\nnot attained at least a Bachelor's degree and whose combined household income\nwas under $25,000 served as the base category by author's discretion.\n4.2.6. Variables Pertaining to Religion\nReligious denomination and frequency of service attendance: Separate dummy\nvariables representing Catholics, Protestants, and non Catholics or Protestants\nwere created to check for an effect of religion on union dissolution and to avoid\nhomogenizing people belonging to different religious sects. At the same time, a\ndummy variable pertaining to whether a respondent attended religious services\nonce a week or more was created and then interacted with the religious deno-\nmination dummies. This decision was made for the simple reason that religious\npeople who attend services frequently (here defined as at least once weekly by\nauthor's discretion) may be different from people of the same faith who do not\nshow such devotion to it. Respondents who did not identify themselves as Prot-\nestant and who did not attend religious services at least once weekly served as\nthe base category by author's discretion.\nPrior fertility: The number of births the respondent had before the birth of the\nstudy's focal child was entered into final analyses.\nNo prior children: A dummy variable dealing with the specific instances\nA. Mastroniani\nwhere the focal child was the union's first was included.\nSex of child: A dummy variable dealing with whether the focal child was fe-\nmale was included.\nIt should be noted that a dummy variable regarding instances where the focal\nchild was the couple's first child and a girl did not substantially alter the final\nmodel and was thus dropped.\n4.2.8. Variables Purposely Not Included\nFather's age at pregnancy: Although a variable for the father's age at pregnancy\ncould have been very valuable considering the numerous studies showing that\nthere is a relationship between age and union stability, none was included in this\nanalysis. This exclusion was decided upon because there were only 520 values for\nthe father's age at pregnancy in the entire dataset.\nAge endogamy: For the reason given in the preceding paragraph, no variables\nconcerning age endogamy were used in this analysis.\nType of job. In keeping with the logic previously set forth, a dummy variable\nwas created to ascertain the possible relationship between having a manageri-\nal/specialty occupation job as defined by 1990 Census Industry codes and rela-\ntionship status. It was dropped from final analyses because including it with all\nthe other variables included in the final model reduced the sample size to only\nWantedness of focal child. Again partly following the lead of Oropesa and\nLandale [29], a dummy variable regarding the wantedness of the focal child was\ncreated. If a respondent answered \"wanted to become preg sooner or wanted to\nbecome preg then,\" said dummy variable was coded as 1. This variable was\ndropped in final analyses, however, because bivariate regressions with an afore-\nmentioned dummy variable pertaining to living situation showed that a 1 value\nfor the child wantedness dummy raised the probability of a 1 value for the living\nsituation dummy by 26.4% for the entire dataset (p < 0.0001). Lastly, including it\nalongside all the other variables ultimately included reduced the sample size to\n5.

Starting with the age first union-age first sexual experience interac-\ntions, the dummy for cases where the respondent entered into the union in\nquestion before age 27 and had not experienced sexual intercourse until after her\n17th birthday became significant at the.05 level, whereas it had not been signifi-\ncant previously at even the 0.1 level. At the same time, the coefficients for each\nof the union-age at first time interaction variables became much larger (i.e. coef-\ndummies pertaining to entering a union before 27 and having sex before 17, en-\ntering a union before 27 and delaying sex until at least the age of 17, and for de-\nlaying entering a union until after 27 and having sex before reaching the age of\nIn regards to the other variables in the model, the variable for instances where\nthe respondent had completed at least college and the combined household in-\ncome at time of pregnancy was over $25,000 became insignificant at the 0.1 level.\nMeanwhile, the dummy for cases where the respondent had attained at least a\nBachelor's degree and her combined household income during pregnancy was\nless than $25,000 remained significant only at the 0.1 level. As for the dummy\npertaining to cases where the couple did not live together at time of conception\nand the father of the focal child had hit the respondent or been to jail, it became\nsignificant at only the 0.1 level. The effect of the focal child being the couple's\nfirst child, meanwhile, became significant at the 0.1 level and its effect on the\ndependent variable nearly doubled (i.e. a 1 value for it lowered the chances for\nthe dependent variable equaling 1 by nearly 10. 3% in multivariate calculations\ninstead of by 5.2% as in a bivariate calculation). The other fertility-related varia-\nble, meanwhile, became significant at the 0.1 level and had its coefficient rise\nof it. As for the effect of the respondent being unable to pay her bills and having\nsomeone close to her be not well, its positive effect on union dissolution was re-\nTurning to cases where the respondent attended religious services less than\nonce a week and identified herself as Catholic, this interaction became signifi-\ncreasing its effect on the dependent variable by 2.3%. The effect of attending re-\nligious services infrequently and of not being Catholic or Protestant, meanwhile,\nwent from being insignificant at even the 0.1 level to being significant at the 0.05\nlevel and it went from having virtually a nil effect on union dissolution to affect-\ning it by 16.3%. Lastly, the effect of the respondent having completed less than\n12 years of schooling while her partner had completed 16 or more went from\nbeing the largest to being the 4th largest behind each of the three age first union -\nage first time interactions (although it should be pointed that the interaction re-\ngarding respondents who entered into a union before 27 and had first sexual in-\ntercourse after 17 was not significant at even the 0.1 level).\nA. Mastroniani\nThere were other changes in results when going from bivariate to multivariate\nanalyses, but they were of much less substantive importance. They were as fol-\nlows: 1) the dummy for respondents who entered a union before the age of 27\nand who engaged in sexual intercourse before the age of 17 became insignificant\nat the 0.001 level; 2) the dummy for respondents who had not attained at least a\nBachelor's degree and whose combined household income during pregnancy\n6. Discussion\nThe people who did not delay both their entry into their first union and into\nsexual intercourse were the ones most likely to be divorced or separated. Interes-\ntingly, the group second most likely to be divorced or separated was the one\nwhose members delayed sexual intercourse but did not delay their first union\nuntil later on in their 20s, thus repeating the implication from prior research that\nage at first union is the most substantial predictor of relationship status.\nAs for the variables regarding living arrangement and partner quality, it must\nbe pointed out that each of the three variables in the final multivariate regression\nhad substantial effects on the dependent variable and were all significant at the\n0.1 level. The interaction representing cases where the couple lived together at\ntime of conception and where the male had hit the respondent or been to jail\nand the interaction representing cases where the couple did not live together at\ntime of conception and the male had not hit the respondent or been to jail being\nsignificant at the 0.05 level. Perhaps the most interesting fact about these va-\nriables is that it was the interaction representing cases where the couple did not\nlive together and the father had not been to jail or hit his partner which had the\nlargest coefficient, not the interaction for cases where the couple did live togeth-\ner and the father had been to jail or hit his partner. While their coefficients were\nroughly equal, it is interesting that in regards to this dataset, not living with the\nfather was slightly more deleterious to the chances of a union proving stable\nthan living with someone who hit his partner or had been to jail.\nMoving to other multivariate results, it is very interesting that the interaction\nrepresenting respondents who had a partner with 16 or more years of schooling\nbut less than 12 themselves had such a substantial impact on the dependent va-\nriable. With its positive coefficient of 0.844, it implies that, at least in the context\nof the PRMIHS dataset, there was a much greater chance for a union to end\nwhen the man had attained a substantially higher level of education than the fe-\nmale (i.e. all else held equal, this condition raised the chances for a 1 value for\nthe dependent variable by nearly 30%). This finding must be treated cautiously,\nhowever, for the dummy in question had a positive value only 13 times in the fi-\nnal sample. Nevertheless, it is a finding worth taking note of, especially consi-\ndering that it is consistent with prior relationships found between union status\nand educational endogamy. The exact reason for this finding, however, cannot\nbe ascertained from the examined survey. It is possible that the male after a cer-\nA. Mastroniani\ntain point attempts to \"trade up\" by attaining a more educated wife. At the same\ntime, however, it could be the case that education level/BA attainment is a proxy\nfor communication as previous authors have argued [9] [22] [23]. This finding\nimplies that the woman's communication skills are more important for union\nsurvival than the man, a proposition supported by the finding that a positive\nvalue for an interaction representing cases where the respondent had at least a\nBachelor's degree and her partner had completed less than 12 years of schooling\npredicts a negative value for the dependent variable perfectly. Similar to the in-\nteraction for cases where the respondent had not finished at least 12 years of\nschooling and the father had completed 16 or more, however, this result must be\nviewed cautiously because there are only 15 instances of this situation.\nThere is yet another interesting finding in regards to coefficient size when one\nexamines the education-income interaction variables. While it did not reach sig-\nnificance at the.05 level, the interaction for cases where the respondent had at\nleast a Bachelor degree and her combined household income during pregnancy\nwas under $25,000 had the largest coefficient for these three variables and it will\nnot be discarded here considering that its p-value was barely above.05 (p =\n0.052). This finding indicates that education is slightly more important for union\nstability than income. Nevertheless, the interaction for cases where the mother\nhad not attained at least a Bachelor's degree and her combined household in-\ncome during pregnancy was at least $25,000 was statistically significant at the.05\nlevel and it did not have an effect to scoff at on the dependent variable (i.e. a 1\nvalue for this independent variable reduced the chances of a 1 value for the de-\npendent variable by nearly 18.1%). This fact implies that it is sufficient that a\ncouple have either money or at least one educated partner (in this case, the\nwoman) to lower its likelihood of ending in divorce or separation. In one final\npoint on these variables, it is surprising that the interaction representing cases\nwhere the respondent had attained at least a Bachelor's degree and whose com-\nbined household income during pregnancy was at least $25,000 had the smallest\ncoefficient and would only be considered significant at a rather relaxed alpha\nlevel of 0.15. One would have expected this variable to have the largest coeffi-\ncient for this group of variables; this expectation was clearly not met, however.\nFor the stressful event interaction variables, there are two things worth dis-\ncussing. One, the signs for the two significant interactions were in opposite di-\nrections (i.e. the coefficient for the dummy pertaining to respondents who could\nnot pay their bills and did not have a loved one be not well was positive, whereas\nthe dummy representing respondents who could pay their bills and had some-\none close to them be not well was negative), thus calling into doubt the wisdom\nof putting these two variables into the same index variable as had been done in\nprior research [29]. Two, the coefficient for the interaction representing respon-\ndents who could pay their bills and who had a loved one be not well was slightly\nlarger than its inverse (i.e. the interaction representing respondents who could\npay their bills and did not have someone close to them be not well (0.465 and\n0.37, respectively)), thereby implying that having a loved one be ill has a some-\nA. Mastroniani\nwhat stronger \"pulling together\" effect on couples than any \"pulling apart\" effect\nof not being able to pay bills (i.e. a 1 value for the former interaction affects the\ndependent variable by 18.1%, instead of by 14.4% as a 1 value for the latter one\ndoes).\nMoving on to the variables dealing with religion, only two attained signific-\nance at even the relaxed 0.1 level (i.e. the interaction for Catholics who attended\nservices less than once a week and the interaction for respondents who were\nneither Catholic nor Protestant and who attended services less than once a\nweek). The latter dummy also had the largest coefficient of the group (-0.434),\nmeaning that a 1 value for this interaction reduced the chance of the dependent\nvariable equaling one by nearly 16.6%. The coefficient for the dummy\nrepresenting Catholics who attended services less than once a week, meanwhile,\nlowered said chances by 11.8%. It is very interesting that nonfrequently church\nattending Catholics are less likely in this dataset to be divorced or separated than\nfrequent church attending Roman Catholics and frequent church attending\nProtestants. Lastly, it should be noted that although only two of these five va-\nriables were statistically significant, all were in the expected direction (i.e. nega-\ntive).\nAs for the variables regarding the actual child and fertility history, the dummy\nfor cases where there was no prior child and the continuous variable for the\nnumber of births prior to the focal child both had negative coefficients and were\nsignificant at the 0.1 level. The effect of the child at the focus of the PRMIHS be-\ning the first child was to reduce the chances of the dependent variable equaling 1\nby approximately 10.3%, whereas each child had prior to the focal child reduced\nsaid chances by nearly 3.6%. This effect may not seem like much at first glance,\nbut it is noteworthy considering that 193 respondents in the final sample had 3\nor more children prior to the focal child.\n7. Parting Thoughts\nThis analysis of the Puerto Rican Maternal and Infant Health Study dataset pro-\nvides support for the assertion that relationships fail primarily because of the\npeople in them. The relationships which turned out to be the least stable, re-\ngardless of which dummy variables were used, were the ones where the respon-\ndent had not delayed entering into their first union until later in life, particularly\ninto their late 20s, and the ones in which the male exhibited undesirable qualities\nby hitting his partner or going to jail. While it of course could be argued that it is\nthe stress of having one's partner going to jail or the possible negative employ-\nment consequences in the future for said partner that is truly affecting unions,\nsuch an argument in this author's opinion mistakes an effect for a true cause.\nMoving on to another point, perhaps the most interesting finding in this\nanalysis was that the best predictors of union stability were the interaction\nrepresenting cases where the respondent entered the union before 27 and en-\ngaged in sexual intercourse before 17 and the interaction representing cases\nA. Mastroniani\nwhere the respondent entered the union before 27 and engaged in sexual inter-\ncourse after 17. While it is possible that later age at first sexual intercourse and at\nfirst union could be driven by things such as low attractiveness and being social-\nly hermetic; a 2012 study found that adolescents who reported first sexual inter-\ncourse at a later date than other adolescents actually were not less attractive\nphysically [57]. Moving on, it should be noted that these two variables, age at\nfirst union and age at first sexual intercourse, quite possibly pertain to the as-\npects of life most under the control of the actual respondent compared to the\nother aspects of life examined in this study. Income can be affected by things\nsuch as a weak economy or being friends with someone who has hiring power,\neducational attainment can be affected by something such as family finances\ndictating that schooling must be foregone for an additional regular paycheck,\netc. At what age one first enters into a union or engages in first sexual inter-\ncourse, however, are intimate decisions presumably not heavily or as heavily af-\nfected by such externalities. Perhaps divorce falls into this category of being an\nintimate decision, not an economic or rational one as it has primarily been\nthought of in recent decades.\nIf the final sentence of the preceding paragraph is correct, it would dovetail\nwith studies showing that the reasons given most frequently by divorcees for\ntheir divorces oftentimes include things such as extramarital sex and abuse [13]\n1995 study that even with conservative estimates, a substantial number of di-\nvorces in their work were presaged by extramarital sex [13]. The usefulness of\nexamining sexual behavior to understand marital stability has been documented\nin other studies examining sex as well, particularly premarital sex [63] [64].\nNotably, a 2012 study on young adults found that later age at first sexual inter-\ncourse was associated with reduced odds of marriage or nonmarital cohabita-\ntion, with fewer romantic partners in adulthood, and with greater relationship\nsatisfaction [57]. Furthermore, although not examining unions, some recent stu-\ndies show that an economic, rational choice viewpoint is sometimes limited or\nnot the most explanatory viewpoint [65] [66] [67]. Given this fact, along with the\nothers presented in this paper, it may well be the case that the primary focus on\nunion status should return to where it had been before: on people and emotions.\nReferences\n[1] Becker, G.S.
