These cognitive demands\nare reflected in an operator's mental workload\n(MWL), or the proportion of mental capacity on\na task (Brookhuis & de Waard, 2010; Kahne-\nA variety of MWL measurement techniques\ncan be divided into three general categories:\nperformance, subjective, and physiological\nmeasurement techniques (Brookhuis, 2004;\nPerformance-based techniques are assessed\nthrough the capability in which an operator is\nable to perform system or task functions, such as\nspeed and accuracy on primary and secondary\ntasks (Wierwille & Eggemeier, 1993). Second,\nsubjective measurement techniques rely on opera-\ntor judgements. Self-rating scales of MWL--such\nas the NASA Task Load Index by Hart and\nStaveland (1988), the Subjective Workload\nAssessment Technique by Reid and Nygren\n(1988), the Overall Workload Scale by Vidulich\nand Tsang (1987), the Modified Cooper-Harper\nScale by Wierwille and Casali (1983), and the\nRating Scale Mental Effort by Zijlstra (1985)--\nare a few of well-known examples that are used\nin multiple domains (Young, Brookhuis, Wick-\nens, & Hancock, 2014).

In a recent study,\nmultiple psychophysiological measurement\ntechniques have been used to compare MWL,\nsuch as EEG, electrocardiogram (ECG), transcra-\nnial Doppler sonography, functional near infrared,\nand eye tracking (Matthews, Reinerman-Jones,\nBarber, & Julian Abich, 2015). The findings\nfrom this study indicate that certain metrics are\nmore sensitive to dual tasking--namely, short\nfixation duration and a high task load index\n(derived from EEG). Metrics more sensitive to\nworkload-associated change detection included,\nfor example, a low HRV (derived from ECG)\nand a high theta (derived from EEG).\nIn the current study, MWL measurement\nthrough HRV is further explored due to the\nincreasing availability of wearable and con-\nsumer devices and the potential advantages of\nthese low-cost and/or less intrusive devices for\nhuman factors research.\nPsychophysiological tools focusing on HRV\nmeasurements have traditionally been conducted\nwith three-lead ECG sensors attached to the\nchest. The removal of bodily hair is a basic pro-\ncedure to conduct the measurements, often fol-\nlowed by a laboratory or simulator setting in\nwhich participants are restricted in their move-\nments by a wired connection to the recording\nsystem. Over the past few years, \"wearable\"\nsensors have become more widely available.\nThese sensors are unobtrusive in the sense that\nthey can be worn as an ambulatory system in\nwhich the individual is able to move around\nfreely during his or her measurement. The emer-\ngence of wearable sensors can be explained by\nrecent advances in microelectronics that have\novercome the limitations resulting from the size\nof front-end electronics and the sensor itself\n(Patel, Park, Bonato, Chan, & Rodgers, 2012).\nWearable sensors in the form of rings, wrist-\nbands, earplugs, and so on, are increasingly\nused by individuals to monitor their health\n(e.g., during workouts), whereas sensors in the\nform of patches are more commonly used by\nmedical practitioners for the remote monitor-\ning of their patients. With consumers and med-\nical practitioners as potential clients in the\nheart rate\u00admonitoring market, these devices\nbecame more affordable than ECG sensors\nused for research.\nThese innovative measurement devices have\ngreat potential for research in the railway\ndomain, where human factors research has been\nsteadily increasing since the railway sector, in\nmany countries worldwide, was broken up into\ncommercial and governmental organizations in\nNetherlands, radical changes in the railways are\nbeing implemented, as long-term targets have\nbeen set to increase the infrastructural capacity\nmade by the government for capacity expansion\nprojects amounted to only 600 million euros,\nwhich is 53% of the total funding (ProRail,\n2015). Projects focusing on meeting a higher-\ncapacity demand vary from optimizations of\nphysical infrastructural configurations, such as\ncreating more buffers in bottleneck areas to pro-\ncess optimizations. These changes also affect\nrailway traffic operations, for which it is there-\nfore essential to investigate the impact on the\ncognitive demands imposed on railway traffic\noperators.\nA series of railway gaming simulation ses-\nsions have been conducted to test future modes\nof the railway system, which is expected to carry\nincreasing amounts of freight and numbers of\npassengers each year (Lo, Van den Hoogen, &\nMeijer, 2013). Insights into the MWL of railway\ntraffic operators are considered valuable in these\nsessions, with a finite pool of operators, who\noften return as participants. Less obtrusive\ninstruments, such as wearable sensors, could\nfacilitate data collection without requiring too\nmuch effort on the part of the participating oper-\nators such that they may not need be interrupted\nduring their tasks. Also, the use of instruments\nMeasuring Mental Workload With Low-Cost and Wearable Sensors 325\nthat are less obtrusive can support conditions\nwhere participants are more aware of being in a\nsimulated environment or an investigation. Fur-\nthermore, less invasive instruments can be help-\nful when investigations on operators are not an\nestablished routine, as in the railway sector, in\nwhich case individuals might be more prone to\nfeelings of hesitance and reluctance to partici-\npate. Additionally, longer MWL measurement\nperiods during operators'shifts in real-world set-\ntings can be obtained. Current measurement tech-\nniques in the railway domain obtain estimates of\nMWL through self-rating or observation-based\nrating tools (e.g., Pickup et al., 2005). As such,\nthe use of objective methods, such as psycho-\nphysiological measurement techniques, can pro-\nvide insights into MWL development next to the\nexisting tools.\nIn addition, due to their easy application and\nuser-friendly interfaces for data extraction and\nvisualizations, low-cost and wearable psycho-\nphysiological sensors can reduce the need for\nassistance from expert researchers (who are usu-\nally required when traditional heart rate mea-\nsurement instruments are used) and thus make\ndata processing in large-scale research efforts\nmuch easier.\nThe present study focused on establishing\nwhich low-cost and/or wearable sensors are suit-\nable for accurate MWL measurements and,\ntherefore, future deployment. Three psycho-\nphysiological sensors that had not yet been\nresearched were selected from a broad range of\nlow-cost and wearable sensors: the E3 from\nEmpatica (Milan, Italy), the emWave Pro from\nHeartMath (Boulder Creek, CA), and the Bio\nPatch from Zephyr (Annapolis, MD). They were\nused to measure the MWL of train traffic con-\ntrollers in a simulator through the analysis of\nHRV. To identify the suitability of sensors for\nanalysis and future deployment, the focus was\non identifying (1) the extent to which partici-\npants perceived the sensors as being obtrusive;\n(2) the sensors' usability for research purposes,\nin terms of usable data points and ease of post-\nprocessing data for the analysis; and (3) the\naccuracy of the E3 and emWave sensors versus\nthe BioPatch ECG sensor as a U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration (FDA)\u00adapproved gold\nstandard reference device.\nThe following section presents a description\nof the three psychophysiological instruments\nand their specifications, followed by the method,\nresults, and discussion and conclusion.\nPsychophysiological\nInstruments\nThe possibility of applying low-cost wearable\nSuunto t6) to measure HRV has been explored\nin a number of studies, mostly by comparing the\nsensor to a gold standard (typically an ECG; Ess-\nner, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Ahlgren, & Lindmark, 2013; Hlo-\ntova, Cats, & Meijer, 2014; Porto & Junqueira,\nson, Theorell, Canlon, & Osika, 2012; Weippert\net al., 2010). Although their findings are incon-\nclusive, these studies indicate that the results from\nwearable sensors are significant when physical\nactivity, gender, and age are taken into account\nand care is taken in the use of absolute values.\nThis section provides a description of the func-\ntionalities and specifications of the E3, emWave,\nand BioPatch devices, which were selected on the\nbasis of placement at different locations on the\nbody--respectively, at the wrist, ear, and chest--\ntheir low-cost availability (EmWave), their rec-\nommended application for research purposes (E3\nand BioPatch), and the possibility to extract data\nsets from the devices. Table 1 shows the simi-\nlarities and differences among the three sensors\nEmpatica's E3 device (see Figure 1) is a\nwristband that has a photoplethysmograph sen-\nsor, an EDA sensor, a three-axis accelerom-\neter, and a temperature sensor (Garbarino, Lai,\nBender, Picard, & Tognetti, 2014). Photople-\nthysmograph is often used in wrist sensors to\nassess variations in the reflected or transmitted\nlight to measure blood volume pulse, which in\nturn can be used to derive heart rate and HRV.\nThe measurements are started by pressing a\nbutton on the sensor. To access the raw data, it\nfirst has to be uploaded from the device to the\nEmpatica website.\nA unique feature of Empatica sensors is that\nthey include an EDAsensor for skin conductance.\n326 December 2017 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making\nEDA is known to be correlated with an individ-\nual's emotional state (e.g., stress) and workload,\nas perspiration increases skin conductance (Pina,\nwhich is available in various sizes, is fixed to the\nwristband.\nFor the current study, only HRV analyses\nwere conducted. To obtain the HRV data set\nfrom the E3, the data from the device need to be\nuploaded to the Empatica website. Empatica\nuses algorithms to provide online visualizations\nof the data and the option to download data sets\nwith the interbeat intervals (IBIs)--that is, the\ntime intervals between heartbeats. In the data\nset, a time stamp for the first recorded data point\nis provided with, subsequently, the number of\nseconds after the start of the recording and its\nrespective IBIs. Note that the raw data are not\naccessible nor downloadable.\nemWave Pro\nThe emWave Pro is offered as a training sys-\ntem for individuals to achieve better emotional\nbalance. The sensor is attached to the earlobe\nand features only a photoplethysmograph sen-\nsor to measure heart rate (see Figure 2). As the\nsensor is wired to the measurement computer\nvia a USB connector, it is not considered a wear-\nable device.\nThe emWave Pro product version is required\nto access the raw data from the recorded ses-\nsions. Measurements and raw file extractions are\naccessible with the emWave software. The data\nset is obtained through the software program and\nprovides the initial time stamp with the start of\nthe recording time of the data. The data set con-\nsists of IBI data per second.\nBioPatch\nThe BioPatch by Zephyr Technology is an\nFDA-approved ECG sensor that can be placed\non the chest with two replaceable electrodes\n(see Figure 3). FDA approval indicates that\nthe sensor complies with regulations on users'\nsafety and is therefore permitted for use in a\nclinical setting. The BioPatch is rather unob-\ntrusive in comparison with the standard three-\nlead ECG sensor, as no chest hairs need to be\nremoved (depending on its placement).\nThe BioPatch is capable of measuring heart\nrate, interbeat (difference between R-wave occur-\nrence times [RR]) interval, respiration rate, ECG,\nTable 1: Specifications of the E3, emWave Pro, and BioPatch Sensors\nE3 emWave Pro BioPatch\nReal-time data display iPhone app PC software Android app\nData extraction format .csv .txt,.json .csv, .dat, .hed\nFigure 1.

The\nmeasurement is triggered by pressing a button on\nthe sensor. To obtain the raw data from the\nrecorded sessions, the BioPatch needs to be con-\nnected to a computer and accessed through a log\ndownloader. HRV data can be analyzed through\nthe ECG data set file or the IBI data set file. In the\npresent study, the sampling rate of the BioPatch\nwas set to the default 250 Hz, and the ECG data\nset file was used to conduct the analyses.\nMethod\nExperimental Setting\nA human-in-the-loop simulator that is used to\ntrain traffic controllers and test infrastructural,\ntimetable, and process changes was deployed to\nconduct the experiments. This simulator, called\nthe PRL game (version 3.5.7), incorporates a\nsubset of the traffic management system's fea-\ntures. PRL is an acronym for \"Proces Leiding\"\nin Dutch, which translates to the name of the\ntraffic management system. For this experi-\nment, its features were extended and matched\nto the level of validity of the simulator for the\ncurrent task at hand, in which operators had an\ninterface design highly similar to their regular\nworkstation. Table 2 shows the simulator design\ncharacteristics based on a gaming simulation\nScenarios\nEach 20-min scenario comprised 4 phases,\nin which the start of a phase was triggered by\nan event (e.g., a call from a train driver). Each\nphase approximately took 5 min. These sce-\nnarios and phases were developed and selected\nby a subject matter expert. Scenario 1 focused\non an overloaded freight train that needs to\ndrive with a lower speed, therefore delaying\nsubsequent trains. In Scenario 2, a malfunction-\ning freight train blocks multiple tracks near a\nrailroad crossing, triggering a railroad crossing\nmalfunction in time. In Table 3, the four phases\nof this scenario are summarized.\nParticipants\nTwelve male train traffic controllers took part\nin the simulator session. Their average work\nMaterials\nPerceived obtrusiveness.\nThe degree of\nobtrusiveness of the sensors was qualitatively\nmeasured through questions during the debrief-\ning. Two questions were asked to measure the\ndegree of perceived obtrusiveness: \"Did you\nexperience the sensors as obtrusive?\" \"Which\nsensor did you find the least obtrusive?\" The\ndata were processed by checking how many\nparticipants answered the first question with yes\nor no and which sensor was indicated as being\nleast obtrusive.\nUsability of the sensors for research.The\nusability of the sensors was assessed by the\nextent to which they were suitable for research\npurposes in terms of usable data points and the\nease of postprocessing data for the analysis. The\npostprocessing of data was necessary to identify\nthe start and end of a selected period or phase.\nReducing postprocessing saves time and\nreduces the costs involved in the analysis stage\nof a study. In terms of usable data points, the\ncollected data were evaluated on their heart rate\nconfidence values and normal distribution,\nFigure 3. BioPatch from Zephyr Technology.\n328 December 2017 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making\nwhich also indicates the quality of the obtained\ndata.\nSensor accuracy. In line with the notion of\nconducting analyses without the assistance of\nexpert researchers who use specific program-\nming tools, HRV was analyzed in each phase\nwith a freeware software packages called\nKubios HRV 2.2. Kubios has been applied in\nnumerous clinical studies (Fagundes et al.,\n2011). Based on a visual inspection of the out-\nliers, medium artifact corrections were applied\nfor the emWave and E3, and a very low arti-\nfact correction was applied to the BioPatch\ndata. HRV parameters were similarly calcu-\nlated for all three sensors by the time-domain\nmethod (mean difference between R-wave\noccurrence times; also known as mean RR) or\nIBI in milliseconds, standard deviation of\nnormal-to-normal RR intervals, root mean\nsquare of successive differences in millisec-\nonds, relative amount of successive intervals\ndiffering >50 ms in percentages (pNN50), tri-\nangular interpolation in milliseconds, and\nfrequency-domain method (lower frequency\nKubios in terms of power, normalized values,\nand ratio). For an elaborate description see,\nfor example, Sch\u00e4fer and Vagedes (2013) and\nTarvainen, Niskanen, Lipponen, Ranta-aho,\nProcedure.In this within-subjects design,\nthe participants were briefed on the purpose of\nthe simulator study at the start of each session,\nand their permission was obtained to use the\ndata from the session anonymously. All partici-\npants gave their consent and were then equipped\nwith all three sensors. The E3 was worn on the\nwrist that was not used for writing or handling\nthe computer mouse. The BioPatch was placed\non the sternum on the first day. During the\nstudy, it was decided to change the location of\nthe BioPatch for the second measurement day,\nto the rib left of the sternum (as seen from the\nrear of the participant), to increase the data-\nrecording quality. The emWave sensor was\napplied to the left earlobe, due to the location of\nthe computer. As the train traffic controllers'\ntasks did not require physical activities, move-\nment activities were limited to seating positions\nand arm movements.\nAfter the final scenario, the participants were\ndebriefed about their experience with the sen-\nsors, their MWL, and their usage of the simula-\ntor. Questionnaires were handed out prior to and\nafter the session and after each scenario.\nTable 2: Simulator Design Characteristics\nCore aspect Description\nPurpose Studying the impact of a new infrastructure and a new train\ntimetable on the workload of train traffic controllers\nScenarios Two scenarios: (1) 2014 train timetable and infrastructure and\nSimulated world Detailed infrastructure; detailed timetable of the\nNijmegen workstation; additional safety-critical features;\ncommunication possible with train drivers, the regional\nnetwork controller of Arnhem, and other roles\nNo. of participants One per session\nRoles Train traffic controller\nType of role Similar to one's own role\nObjectives Execution of tasks--similar as in one's daily work\nConstraints Exclusion of a number simulator features\nLoad Medium disruptions in both scenarios\nSituation (external influencing factors) Presence of three facilitators in the room\nTime model Continuous\nMeasuring Mental Workload With Low-Cost and Wearable Sensors 329\nResults\nPerceived Obtrusiveness\nThe qualitative findings from the debriefing\nsession showed that none of the participants\nperceived any of the sensors as being obtrusive.\nHowever, operators noted that the emWave was\noccasionally noticeable due to its wired con-\nnection with the computer. Most participants\nindicated that they forgot they were wearing\nthe E3 wristband, as they were used to wearing\nwatches. Few participants who were not used\nto wearing watches stated that they had some-\ntimes found the E3 device noticeable. Overall,\nthe BioPatch sensor was perceived as the least\nobtrusive device.\nUsability of the Sensors for Research\nThe BioPatch sensor is provided with a heart\nrate confidence value as a quality indicator.\nValues >20% are indicated as a threshold for\na reliable heart rate (Zephyr, 2014). For this\nstudy, this margin has been adopted based on\nthe assumption that a FDA-approved sensor\ncan validly serve as a gold standard device. A\nraw data file from the E3 can be extracted only\nfrom the website, which omits values when the\nTable 3: Phase Descriptions Across Scenarios 1 and 2\nPhase Trigger Description\nExpected mental\nworkload\nScenario 1\n1 Start of the\nscenario\nThe train traffic controller is building up his or her\nsituation awareness and monitors the current\ntrain traffic flow.\nLow\n2 Regional network\ncontroller calls\nRequest is received to make a change in the order\nof trains.

The emWave sensor always provides a\nvalue at each constant measurement point. Due\nto the unavailability of data points caused by\na low measurement confidence, especially in\nthe case of the E3, a normal distribution of RR\nintervals in each phase was not always obtain-\nable. In the evaluation of usable data points,\nfour data sets of the BioPatch showed a low\nheart rate confidence value, whereas seven data\nsets of the E3 partially showed too few data\npoints to obtain a normal distribution. Also one\ndata set from the E3 was lost during an attempt\nto upload the data from the device. No issues\nwere encountered regarding the emWave.\nThe E3 and emWave data first needed to be\nprocessed manually by converting the time\nstamps and identifying the start of the recording.\nTime indications of the ECG file are directly dis-\nplayed in Kubios. Some data files had to be\nmanually split, since Kubios is not able to open\nvery large files.\nA precondition for the comparison among the\nthree sensors is that the data in each phase have\nnormal distributions and sufficiently high data\nconfidence rates. Failure to meet this precondi-\ntion led to omission from the analysis. Due to\nthe omission or unavailability of data, only HRV\ndata from three to six participants could be\nincluded in the analysis per phase.\nAccuracy of the Sensors\nSince the BioPatch is an FDA-approved\nECG sensor, it was used as a reference for the\naccuracy of the E3 and emWave devices. For\neach participant, only full data sets from all\nthree sensors were used in the analysis. Tables\n4 and 5 present 10 HRV parameters and their\nmeans and standard deviations for each sen-\nsor and per phase, respectively for Scenario\nOne phase in Scenario 2 was removed, as the\nscenario was too short to provide sufficient data\npoints for the E3 sensor.\nTo identify to what extent the E3 and emWave\nfollowed a similar trend in their data points in\ncomparison to the BioPatch, which indicates the\naccuracy in relative terms, a linear regression\nwas computed based on the data from the seven\nphases in Tables 4 and 5. The linear regression\nanalysis was conducted between the BioPatch\nand each of the two other sensors; the significant\nrelationships are given in Tables 4 and 5. In total,\n6 of 10 HRV parameters showed a linear rela-\ntionship between the emWave and the BioPatch\n7.1, p = .04. A significant linear regression was\nfound for 1 of 10 HRV parameters for the E3\nsensor (i.e., mean RR, adjusted R2 = .98, F =\nThe results from two commonly used HRV\nparameters derived from the time- and\nfrequency-domain analysis (mean RR and nor-\nmalized LF, respectively) are given in Tables 4\nTime-domain analysis.For the mean RR\nvalues (see Figure 4), a linear regression analy-\nsis was conducted over all phases. The findings\nshow that the data from the BioPatch can be\nvery well represented by a linear function in the\n.001, as listed earlier). The absolute values of\nthe BioPatch and emWave can even be consid-\nered equal within the current measurement\nrange, with an error of approximately 8%. For\nthe E3, a similar result is observed (adjusted\nmentioned). Thus, the data values recorded by\nthe emWave, E3, and BioPatch are linearly\ndependent and can easily be converted for the\nmean RR values as an HRV parameter.\nFrequency-domain analysis. The regression\nanalysis shows a poor correspondence for the\nnormalized LF values between the emWave and\n.04) but a very good one when the outlier P7 is\nsee mean normalized LF values in Figure 5).\nFor the E3 sensor, no such linear dependency is\nfound. This implies that the findings from the\nE3 sensor do not provide accurate indications\nfor the measurement of HRV for this parameter\nand should therefore not be used to derive\nconclusions.\nTable 4: Heart Rate Variability Parameters for the E3, emWave, and BioPatch for Phases 1\u00ad4 (Mean \u00b1 SD)\nHRV parameter E3 eW BP E3 eW BP E3 eW BP E3 eW BP\nNote.

For this HRV parameter, the absolute\nvalues of the emWave could be used inter-\nchangeably with those of the BioPatch. How-\never, when the results from all 10 HRV parame-\nters were taken into account, a correspondence\nwas found for 6 of 10 parameters between the\nemWave and the BioPatch. For the E3 sensor,\nthis applies to only one HRV parameter. Thus,\ngreat care should be taken when selecting HRV\nparameters derived from the E3 wristband data.\nThese findings are surprising in that, overall,\nthe emWave is more accurate than the E3, given\nthe lower sampling rate of the EmWave. A rea-\nson for the difference in significant findings\nbetween the E3 and the emWave with regard to\nthe 10 HRV parameters might be the location of\nthe sensors: A wristband sensor might incur\nmore noise during data acquisition. The impact\nof the E3 as being less accurate given its signifi-\ncant relationship with 1 of 10 HRV parameters\nmay contribute to the discussion about the extent\nto which commercially available wearable sen-\nsors, often wristbands, are accurate. However,\nalthough the FDA does not actively enforce reg-\nulations on commercially available wearable\nsensors, it has developed a draft set of guidelines\nfor products that are used only for wellness pur-\nposes, that present a very low risk to users'\nMean RR (ms)\nPhase\nEW\nBP\nFigure 4.

In\nterms of usable data points, both the E3 and the\nBioPatch had difficulty acquiring either suffi-\nciently high data-recording confidence values\n(especially the BioPatch) or normal distributions\n(especially the E3, due to missing data points in\nthe output file).As for the ease of postprocessing\ndata, the BioPatch output files required no man-\nual postprocessing, which reduced costs and\nefforts in the analysis stage. In this case, 12 par-\nticipants were analyzed, and in the case of both\nthe emWave and the E3, data had to be prepared\nfor the actual analysis in terms of manually iden-\ntifying the start and end phases within the output\nfiles (e.g., through time stamp conversions, the\nsynchronization of sampling rate with times, and\nadaption of the output file). The postprocessing\nof data took a considerable effort over a period\nof a few days for both files. An output file that\nneeds very few or no manual adaptations can be\nhighly recommended when dealing with a larger\nsample. However, greater compatibility between\nthe output file and the software program can also\nsupport the postprocessing work.\nEach of the three devices has its own pros and\ncons regarding deployment in a research setting.\nThe BioPatch would be the overall preferred\nsensor, due to its assumed accuracy and usability\nfor research purposes. However, a strong empha-\nsis lies on exploring how to increase the data-\nrecording confidence rate. As an alternative sen-\nsor, the emWave could be acceptable for mea-\nsuring HRV, as it had a sufficiently high accuracy\non 6 of 10 parameters to measure HRV, in which\n1 parameter (mean RR) was significant in terms\nof absolute values. It is not, however, a wearable\nsensor, which limits the measurements to a static\nsetting. Note that sensors can be more preferred\nor recommended given the priorities of a partic-\nular study. For instance, if the number of data\npoints is prioritized, if no time constraints are set\non postprocessing data, and if no ambulatory\nmovements are expected during the study, the\nemWave would be recommended over the Bio-\nPatch, as the latter's data-recording confidence\nrate is unstable. The E3 could also be used in\ncontrol room studies when researchers want to\nuse a wristband sensor and are supportive of\nusing only the mean RR as an HRV parameter to\ncalculate MWL.\nThis study shows that the wearable BioPatch\nsensor and the low-cost emWave sensor can\nboth be used to analyze the MWL development\nof train traffic controllers. The positive advan-\ntages of the sensors, especially with regard to the\nease of use in recording and postprocessing data\nfor analysis, could provide opportunities for cost\nreductions in terms of expertise in traditional\nECG measurements as well as in equipment\ncosts. With proper but limited training, it is pos-\nsible to apply the devices and prepare the data\nset without much prior experience. Moreover,\nwith the increasing popularity of wearable sen-\nsors, the chance increases that researchers and\nparticipants are acquainted with the use of these\nsensors. Additionally, in the light of so-called\nregret costs, measuring the objective MWL of\noperators through low-cost heart rate sensors\n(<$450 for the BioPatch sensor [in U.S. dollars])\ncosts a fraction of the amount spent on imple-\nmenting a traffic management system--for\nexample, approximately $43 million (originally\nstated as 28 million pounds) in the United King-\nHowever, limitations in this study should be\nnoted, as the BioPatch had a different sensor\nplacement on the chest on the second measure-\nment day. As the sample size was too small to\ninvestigate possible differences between the two\ngroups, future research should investigate pos-\nsible effects. In general, future research is\nneeded to confirm these findings, given the lim-\nited number of samples in this study. Also the\npresented conclusions are valid only for HRV\nmeasurements in nonphysically demanding\ntasks, such as supervisory control tasks. More\nresearch is needed to explore the other wearable\nsensors on the market, to investigate the effects\nof individual differences, such as gender and\nage, on the level of accuracy of the sensors and\nto confirm the use of the BioPatch as a valid and\naccurate reference device.\nAll in all, the accessibility and affordability\nof wearable sensors show great potential to\nobtain insights in the MWL development of\nMeasuring Mental Workload With Low-Cost and Wearable Sensors 335\noperators next to the use of observational and/or\nself-rating data. The advantages of long-term\nmeasurements throughout operators' shifts can\nespecially provide new insights into the cogni-\ntive demands of certain tasks at hand. Future\nwork could also examine the MWL through\nHRV and stress through EDA relation, which\ncan be retrieved from the Empatica device.\n"
