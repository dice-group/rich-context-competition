Research in this area has identified\nsome apparent predictors of physical, cognitive, and emotional\nhealth in later life, which include both genetic and environmen-\ntal influences. Because environments represent all nongenetic\neffects, environmental, and quasi-environmental, influences\ncan be conceptualized broadly to encompass protective/risk\nfactors and behavioral patterns in which individuals engage.\nFor instance, they can easily be conceptualized as \"purely\" en-\nvironmental influences, such as literal environments (eg, lead\nexposure). They can also be more complex influences that re-\nflect environmental exposures (eg, a lifetime of smoking) that\nmay arise partly from genetic influences (eg, genes predispos-\ning an individual to develop nicotine dependence). Using this\ndefinition, environmental influences affect a wide array of\nsuccessful aging constructs (ie, constructs associated with\nimproved longevity as well as higher quality of life as individu-\nals age). Environmental influences range from the biological\nTranslational Article\nSpecial Issue on Genetics and Aging\nGenes, Environments, Personality, and Successful Aging:\nToward a Comprehensive Developmental Model in\nLater Life\nNicholas R.

Outcomes in aging and health research, such as longevity, can be conceptualized as reflecting both\ngenetic and environmental (nongenetic) effects. Parsing genetic and environmental influences can be challenging,\nparticularly when taking a life span perspective, but an understanding of how genetic variants and environments relate\nto successful aging is critical to public health and intervention efforts.\nMethods. We review the literature, and survey promising methods, to understand this interplay. We also propose the\ninvestigation of personality as a nexus connecting genetics, environments, and health outcomes.\nResults. Personality traits may reflect psychological mechanisms by which underlying etiologic (genetic and environ-\nmental) effects predispose individuals to broad propensities to engage in (un)healthy patterns of behavior across the life\nspan. In terms of methodology, traditional behavior genetic approaches have been used profitably to understand how\ngenetic factors and environments relate to health and personality in somewhat separate literatures; we discuss how other\nbehavior genetic approaches can help connect these literatures and provide new insights.\nConclusions. Co-twin control designs can be employed to help determine causality via a closer approximation of the ideal-\nized counterfactual design. Gene-by-environment interaction (G \u00d7 E) designs can be employed to understand how individual\ndifference characteristics, such as personality, might moderate genetic and environmental influences on successful aging out-\ncomes. Application of such methods can clarify the interplay of genes, environments, personality, and successful aging.\nKey Words: Personality--genetics--aging.\nDecision Editor: Luigi Ferrucci, MD, PhD.\n(eg, longevity) to the psychological (eg, optimism, resilience)\nto the social (eg, social integration) (1).\nUntangling the complex direct causal effects of, and inter-\nactions among, genetic and environmental influences will be\ncritical to public health efforts to promote successful aging in\nthe coming years. For instance, although social integration\nmay show positive associations with aspects of successful\naging, interventions to improve quality of life by strength-\nening social ties might fail if these associations reflected\nreverse causation (eg, continued good health is the cause of\nincreased social integration, as opposed to functioning in\nthe opposite direction) or the presence of a third variable\nwith broad impacts, such as underlying genetic factors. The\npurpose of the current report is to outline the beginnings of\na framework to unravel the complex genetic and environ-\nmental influences on successful aging. This framework inte-\ngrates individual differences in personality as a potential\nexplanatory mechanism and highlights newer behavior\ngenetic methods that can lead to stronger causal inferences\ndue to their novel design features. The wide variability in\nmany outcomes of successful aging suggests numerous\nopportunities to apply such models toward understanding\nthe sources of this variation.\nGenetics and Successful Aging\nWe will begin our discussion of the relative contributions of\ngenetic factors and environments to successful aging by focus-\ning on the direct effects of genetic factors. It is self-evident that\ngenetic factors relate to human development; just as genes\nprovide the informational framework to build each human\nembryo, their impacts continue to be felt throughout the life\nspan. Although molecular genetic approaches are now being\napplied to questions of successful aging--for instance, which\ngenetic variants might be related to the development of demen-\ntia of theAlzheimer's type--the majority of our current under-\nstanding about the role of genetics in later life has come from\nbehavior genetic studies of twins. In their classic formulations,\nbehavior genetic studies parse variation in an observed pheno-\ntype (eg, a trait) into causal components--most typically (i)\nadditive genetic effects (referred to as \"A\"), (ii) shared environ-\nmental effects (\"C\") that are common within a family, such as\nthe neighborhood in which the twins were raised together, and\nthat act to create greater phenotypic similarity within pairs than\nwould be predicted solely from genetic similarity, and (iii) non-\nshared environmental effects (\"E\") that are unique to each\nfamily member and that serve to make individuals different,\nincluding, eg, stochastic effects (2). Behavior genetic methods,\nfor example, provide estimates of heritability, which is the pro-\nportion of phenotypic variance due to genetic effects.\nThis classic approach has yielded important findings about\nthe relative importance of genetic factors for successful\naging. For instance, the heritability of longevity has been\nestimated to be around 25% or greater and to be stable\nacross birth cohorts (3\u00ad5).\nEnvironments and Successful Aging\nIn accepting a broad definition of \"environment\"--one that\nincludes all nongenetic sources of variance--we accept a\nwide variety of possible influences on successful aging. If, for\nexample, 50% of subjective well-being variation were shown\nto be due to nonshared environmental effects in behavior\ngenetic analyses, the next logical direction would be to ascer-\ntain precisely which constructs accounted for this effect. On\none hand, we would include literal environmental settings,\nsuch as the impact of continuing to live independently in one's\nown home versus moving to an assisted living community. On\nthe other hand, given our definition, we would include less\ncommonly conceived types of environmental influences as\nwell. These include environmental exposures, such as expo-\nsure to health-related behaviors (eg, smoking, exercise), indi-\nvidual differences, social interactions, and so on. Such\nenvironmental exposures are not purely environmental in most\ncases; they are likely most accurately conceptualized as being\npartially environmental exposures because they are also reflec-\ntions of genetic influence in many cases. For instance, if an\nindividual chooses to expose himself to exercise, this might\nreflect a genetically influenced predisposition to being ener-\ngetic and personality traits that might predispose an individual\nto exercise. Alternatively, if an individual were, say, randomly\ndrafted into the military and was thus exposed to regular phys-\nical exercise, this would be a purely environmental manifesta-\ntion of the same variable. This highlights the relative rarity of\nidentifying a construct that is purely genetically, or environ-\nmentally, driven, and any discussion of such \"environmental\"\nexposures should be understood as possibly reflecting down-\nstream genetic influences as well. Finally, in behavior genetic\nanalyses, the nonshared environmental variance component\ntypically also includes psychometric error.\nNumerous factors that have environmental aspects to\nthem have been linked to successful aging. A recent review\nhas established such behavioral factors as caloric restriction\nand physical activity, and intervention-based environmental\nexposures such as cognitive interventions, stress reduction,\nand social programs, as being associated with cognitive,\nemotional, and physical health in older adults (1). Of course,\nhealth risk behaviors, such as smoking, have also been\nrelated to health throughout the life span (6). Constructs\nsuch as socioeconomic status--which, in childhood, is a\ncommonly used example of shared environmental effects\nbetween twins--are also linked to healthy aging (7).\nPersonality\nLike discrete health behaviors, environmental settings, and\ngenetic factors, personality traits have been associated with\nimportant outcomes related to successful aging. For instance,\npersonality traits prospectively predict longevity, divorce, and\noccupational attainment--and they do so as well as cognitive\nability (eg, IQ) and socioeconomic status (8). Personality trait\nmodels typically include multiple distinct trait domains.\nExamination of these individual domains and the facets sub-\nsumed therein has yielded associations with successful aging\nvariables. For instance, the domain of conscientiousness--a\nkey higher-order domain in Big Five models of personality--\nand some of its facets (eg, responsibility, self-control, tradition-\nalism) are consistent predictors of longevity (eg, an effect size\nof r = -.09 of conscientiousness for mortality, indicating a\nprotective effect; [9,10]). Another trait domain, neuroticism/\nnegative affectivity/internalizing, has been shown to account\nfor the observed comorbidity of many forms of mental disorder\nat different points across the life span (11). Although beyond\nthe scope of the present chapter, some extreme and maladap-\ntive personality features (12), known clinically as personality\ndisorders, are, by definition, associated with dysfunction and\noccur throughout the life span, including very late life (13).\nBehavior genetic research has consistently demonstrated\nthat individual differences in single-assessment, self-report\npersonality traits, on average, are due approximately 50% to\nadditive genetic effects and 50% to nonshared environmen-\ntal effects (14); when incorporating multi-rater data and\nthus assessing personality traits more fully than self-report,\ngenetic factors account for around two-thirds of domain-\nand facet-level variance (15). However, this literature is\ntypically quite separate from the behavior genetic literature\non successful aging and on environmental contributions\nthereto. Because genetic factors, personality, health-related\nbehaviors, and successful aging appear so closely inter-\ntwined, this lack of integration is notable. In the following\nsections, we lay out some features of a conceptual model of\nhow personality can be used to capture this interplay and\nhow behavior genetic methods can be used to understand\nthe complex etiologic underpinnings of successful aging.\nHealth Behaviors as Patterns\nStudies focusing on health-related behaviors frequently\nexamine how a particular health-related behavior, such as\ncaloric intake or regularity of physical activity, relates to\nconstructs associated with successful aging, such as longevity,\nsubjective well-being, or physical health. This approach has\nyielded a somewhat piecemeal understanding of the impact\nof particular behaviors on aging. Numerous seemingly dis-\nparate factors are associated with successful aging, such as\neating nuts, using sunscreen, and owning a car (16).A different\napproach--one that focuses on broad longstanding patterns\nof behavior across the life span rather than discrete behaviors--\nmay be a profitable and complementary angle from which\nto investigate how behaviors are associated with successful\naging. For instance, it is probably not solely the frequency\nof physical exercise in later life that relates to health. Rather,\nit seems likely that this relation reflects a broad propensity\nto adopt a healthy lifestyle, in which exercise is but one\naspect of an overall approach to living. Other behaviors\nlinked to this propensity perhaps include a combination of\nhigh physical energy, focus on physical health, enjoyment\nof being active versus sedentary, interest in stimulation\nversus inactivity (eg, watching television), and so on. Studies\nof physical exercise tap into this propensity, but they fail to\ncapture its breadth and may thereby attenuate its associations\nwith successful aging. The broad propensity is akin to studying\ngeneral cognitive ability (g)--which is a broad construct satu-\nrating a variety of performance measures--by assessing only\nmathematics. On the outcome side, this approach is similar to\nconceptualizing successful aging solely as one aspect of this\nbroader construct (eg, longevity).\nThe Role of Personality in Health Patterns\nIf we accept that specific health behaviors are reflections\nof broad, underlying propensities to engage in generally\nstable patterns of related, but distinct, health behaviors, the\nquestion becomes how to conceptualize these constructs for\nfurther study. We propose that investigations of personality\nmay represent an important first step. The use of personality\nas a means of framing these health-related behavioral pat-\nterns is sensible, given that personality traits confer broad\npredispositions to behave in a given way within a group of\nrelated behaviors. For instance, the trait of extraversion\nrelates to characteristics such as outgoingness, sociability,\nself-confidence, sensation seeking, energy, and positive\nemotionality. Clearly, personality traits such as extraversion\nencompass a broad set of behaviors; although each of these\nbehaviors might relate to successful aging if examined\nseparately, a better understanding of their impacts would\nrequire an understanding that they are all manifestations of\nthe same psychological core. By incorporating information\nabout the domain-level trait of extraversion with informa-\ntion about the specific characteristics (facets) it subsumes,\nresearchers can elaborate a model of personality-liked health\nbehaviors that shows both generality and specificity.\nTo illustrate this point, let us consider a particular personal-\nity trait as relating to patterns of specific health-related behav-\niors. Bogg and Roberts (9) meta-analytically examined trait\nconscientiousness in tandem with tobacco, drug, and excessive\nalcohol use; diet and activity patterns; violence, risky sexual,\nand driving behaviors; and suicide. Results indicated that trait\nconscientiousness related positively to all beneficial health-\nrelated behaviors and negatively to all risky health-related\nbehaviors, thus highlighting how trait conscientiousness can be\nused to unify our understanding of these superficially different\nbehaviors in a systematic patterned way.\nPersonality traits are also relatively stable over time, particu-\nlarly in adulthood (17,18). This is not to say that personality\ntraits are immutable or \"set like plaster\" as previously thought;\nindeed, there are patterns of within-individual and between-\nage cohort mean differences across the life span (19). How-\never, the general rank-order stability of personality traits\nprovides a critical strength for studies of successful aging,\nwhich typically take a longitudinal developmental approach.\nGiven recall biases and memory lapses, we can never know\nprecisely how an individual was in the past by retrospective\nreporting. Because personality traits show a notable degree of\ndevelopmental stability, they provide a rough estimate for how\nindividuals have been--and behaved--throughout their life\nspan. In this way, personality traits might be conceptualized as\nproviding a reasonable basis upon which inferences about\nlifelong health-related behavioral patterns can be drawn.\nThis being said, personality traits can change substantially,\neven in later life, but this does not change the overarching mes-\nsage. To wit, the factors that concern health and aging investi-\ngators may be significantly impacted by latent individual\ndifferences constructs that have been excluded from most\nhealth research. These latent constructs, including personality\ntraits, likely influence health outcomes, and they do so whether\nthey change across the life span or not. It should also be noted\nthat personality is likely reciprocally influenced by some health\noutcomes, such as health restrictions being associated with\napparent personality changes (eg, decreased mobility\nresulting in fewer opportunities for, and less interest in, risk\ntaking or sensation seeking).\nIntegrative Frameworks\nAlthough researchers have demonstrated associations of\nsuccessful aging and health variables with genetic factors,\nenvironmental influences, and personality, these findings\nhave been reported in largely separate literature and remain\nrelatively unsynthesized. The full promise of these separate\nlines of inquiry likely lies in developing an integrative\nframework in which the effects of genetics, environmental\ninfluences, and personality can be considered simultaneously.\nWe believe that particular behavior genetic approaches can\nprovide a means by which these ends can be realized. As\nsuch, we now turn our attention to two methods that hold\nnotable promise for gerontological studies: co-twin control\ndesigns and gene-by-environment (G \u00d7 E) investigations.\nCo-twin Control Analysis\nThe first behavior genetic method we will discuss is\nthe co-twin control design. Traditional behavior genetic\napproaches parse variance in a phenotype (or set of phe-\nnotypes) of interest into genetic, shared, and nonshared\nenvironmental components. This can be helpful for ascer-\ntaining the heritability of a phenotype and determining\nwhere, for instance, research and intervention efforts should\nbe directed. For instance, a phenotype with a very high\nheritability--say, 80%--would suggest that the phenotype\narises primarily from genetic influences (eg, stature is an\nexample of this type of highly heritable phenotype, [20]).\nThe picture here is complicated in a sense because, although\nvarious phenotypes may differ in the degree to which their\nvariance is heritable, all human phenotypes are mediated\nthrough genes. In other words, environmental exposures,\nsuch as carcinogen exposure in the workplace, will interact\nwith the genetically driven biological substrates within each\nindividual, and thus gene-environment interplay will account\nfor whether an individual develops cancer.\nThe co-twin control design yields different information than\nthese traditional approaches. Rather than parsing phenotypic\nvariance in a single phenotype into its etiologic components,\nco-twin control analyses support causal inferences about the\nrelations between specific constructs and aging outcomes of\ninterest. The illustration of causation is a contested and com-\nplex issue in general (21). Drawing strong causal inferences is\neven more problematic for gerontological research because the\ncausal inference gold standard--the randomized controlled\nexperiment--can rarely be conducted given the constructs\nof interest, the life-span perspective, potential selection effects,\nand other confounding factors. To understand better the\nstrengths of the co-twin control design for causal inference, we\nmust first discuss the counterfactual briefly.\nIn simplified experimental terms, we can think of the\ncounterfactual as being the result of a given individual\nreceiving and not receiving the experimental treatment.\n(For an excellent discussion of the counterfactual and\nco-twin control designs, see McGue and colleagues [22]). If\na researcher is interested in the impact of a cognitive inter-\nvention (treatment) versus no intervention (control) for a\nsuccessful aging outcome like memory performance, what\nshe would like to know is how her sample of N individuals\nwould react if they received the treatment compared with if\nthey had received the control. In other words, she seeks a\ndifference score for each individual (di) between his or her\nmemory performance after receiving the treatment ( T\ni\nY ) and\nafter receiving the control ( C\ni\nY ), which can be represented\nas \ni\ni i\n= - (22,23). However, this counterfactual\napproach--where one knows the outcome of simultaneously\nexposing, and not exposing, each individual to both treat-\nment and control--is not feasible. Instead, the researcher\nrelies on a randomized experiment. Because she cannot\nassign each individual to both conditions simultaneously,\nshe will instead assign individuals to the treatment or con-\ntrol group. By use of random assignment and a reasonable\nsample size, she hopes that individual differences will cancel\neach other out and the groups will differ meaningfully only\nwith regard to treatment condition. As such, she is attempt-\ning to approximate the idealized counterfactual model.\nNonexperimental designs, and particularly the observational\nand quasi-experimental designs used in much gerontology\nresearch, typically approximate the idealized counterfactual\nmodel less well than randomized experiments; however,\nclose attention to observational study design can mitigate\nsome of these issues (23). (In some instances, due to factors\nsuch as selection effects, it may indeed even be the case that\nbroad observational studies can provide better estimates\nof causality than potentially biased experimental designs;\n[22]). One study design that can approximate the idealized\ncounterfactual model is co-twin control, wherein twins who\nare discordant for a given X (ie, a treatment, exposure,\nbehavior, individual difference, etc.) are compared on an\noutcome of interestY. The use of twins reared together to com-\npare the impact of one potential cause on the outcome capital-\nizes on the understanding that monozygotic (identical, MZ)\ntwins have in common 100% of their segregating DNA and\n100% of their shared rearing environments. Dizygotic (frater-\nnal, DZ) twins, on the other hand, have in common, on aver-\nage, only 50% of their segregating DNA in addition to 100% of\ntheir shared rearing environments. Neither MZ nor DZ twins\nhave any nonshared environmental effects in common because,\nby definition, these effects are unique to each twin.\nThe understanding that MZ and DZ co-twins have different\nprofiles of genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared\nenvironmental overlap, formulated in quantitative terms,\nallows for co-twin control behavior genetic modeling and\nbolsters causal inferences (22). For example, if one can iden-\ntify identical twins who differ, within pairs, on exposure to\na risk environment and those twins differ in a corresponding\nway on an outcome, this suggests, but does not definitively\ndemonstrate, that the risk exposure is causal. The risk-outcome\nassociation in this case would likely not be a function of, for\nexample, the same genetic variation causing both the risk\nexposure and the outcome because these MZ twins share\n100% of their segregating DNA. Thus, the co-twin control\ndesign can be particularly helpful for testing and rejecting\nsome causal hypotheses. The design is comparatively less\nstrong in rejecting third variable explanations (eg, third\nvariable X causes the investigated risk exposure as well as\nthe outcome, giving the appearance of a direct exposure-\noutcome link that is instead mediated through the third\nvariable X; third variable X causes the one twin to be\nexposed while the other is not, and thus the measured\nrisk variable might not actually be in the causal chain of\nexposure-outcome events). One limitation of the co-twin\ncontrol design--particularly for studies of aging--relates to\npotentially varying ages of onset of disorders within twin\npairs, which may give the appearance of true discordance\nwhile actually representing only a temporary discordance.\nCo-twin control studies can be conducted with different\nlevels of analytical sophistication. For instance, some\nco-twin control studies take a relatively straightforward\napproach: they approximate the idealized counterfactual by\ncomparing outcome measures of MZ twins who are discor-\ndant for a potential causal factor. Although we cannot assess\nindividual i after he or she has been exposed to a potential\ncausal factor and after not having been exposed to the factor,\nwe can treat a pair of MZ twins as being highly similar\nindividuals who are nearly perfectly matched on many\npotential confounders (eg, gender, age, childhood environ-\nment, genetic code, etc.). Now, if Twin1 has engaged in, say,\nregular physical exercise, whereas Twin2 has not, our compar-\nison of these two highly similar individuals on an outcome\n(subjective well-being) will help clarify the role regular physi-\ncal exercise plays with regard to subjective well-being (24).\nBasic co-twin control designs of this nature are not perfect\nanalogs of the counterfactual, of course, and they do not\ndefinitively demonstrate causation in and of themselves; how-\never, these designs do approximate the comparison of the same\nperson after exposure and nonexposure to a potential causal\ninfluence in a closer way than individual-level analysis (22).\nGiven its analytic and inferential strengths, the co-twin con-\ntrol design is being increasingly applied to gerontological\nquestions. Historically, co-twin control designs were applied to\nthe evaluation of interventions by giving one MZ twin the\ntreatment while leaving the other as a control, which is a more\nefficient design than the standardized case\u00adcontrol random-\nized-controlled trial (25). This method is equally applicable to\nnonexperimental observational designs as well, making it a\nparticularly promising approach to test hypotheses in aging\nresearch. Co-twin control designs of this nature require little in\nthe way of analytic complexity and several registries of mid- to\nlater-life twins exist (eg, the Midlife in the United States sam-\nple and the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins).\nDiscussion of a nongerontological co-twin control study\nof this nature would be informative for the purposes of illus-\ntration. One excellent application of this sort of co-twin\ncontrol was done to examine the potentially causal relations\nbetween childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and later develop-\nment of psychopathology (26). By examining a population-\nbased sample of 1,411 female adult twins (MZ and DZ\nanalyzed as a group), the researchers brought to bear the\npower of basic co-twin control designs to test hypotheses.\nAfter they established a link between CSA and later\npsychopathology, the researchers were able to infer whether\nthis link was causal by examining co-twins discordant for\nCSA. It is possible, for instance, that some characteristic of\nthe individual (eg, a personality-related third variable\nconfounder) would predispose her to CSA and indepen-\ndently to psychopathology. Because twins (and particularly\nMZ twins) are likely to share this characteristic with their\nco-twins, within each pair of twins, there should be a rela-\ntively low association between CSA and psychopathology;\nthe third variable hypothesis here would suggest that, since\nthe twins have similar levels of the characteristic, they\nshould both develop psychopathology regardless of whether\nor not they experienced CSA. The authors did not find this\npattern; rather, their results showed clear links between\nCSA status and psychopathology within discordant twin\npairs, with the abused twin significantly more frequently ex-\nperiencing psychopathology. This bolsters the inference that\nCSA causes psychopathology. In this way, a relatively basic\ncomparison of twins--and particularly those discordant on a\npotential influence of interest--can rule out confounding fac-\ntors and provide support for causal links. Causal inferences\nare further strengthened by study design factors and the\nnature of the research question. For instance, the temporal\nsequencing of the variables in this study (26)--onset of psy-\nchopathology temporally followed CSA--bolstered the in-\nference that CSA's link to psychopathology was causal.\nMore complex co-twin control designs are available, and\nthese designs can be even more informative. By examining\noutcome association is not causal but is due entirely to some\nmix of both genetic and/or shared environmental effects,\none would expect RWI to be large while RMZ and RDZ\nwould similarly be near zero because the influence-outcome\nassociation would be seen only at the individual level\n(27,28). Importantly, Figure 1 is intended to be heuristic, as\nopposed to involving precise point values corresponding\nwith the exact heights of the lines in the figure. For exam-\nple, the \"within MZ pair\" bar in scenario B is not precisely\nzero as drawn, and hence, there may be a partial causal\neffect if those bars corresponded with precise numerical\nvalues along the y-axis. In actual empirical application of\nthese approaches, formal quantitative models can be fit that\nyield precise quantitative statements of the degree to which\nthe data fit with the different kind of scenarios portrayed\nheuristically in the Figure (eg, McArdle and Prescott [29]).\nThis sort of co-twin control design is increasingly being\napplied in gerontological research, given its ability to parse out\ncause and effect (30,31).A recent review of the co-twin control\nstudies in successful aging research highlights this method's\nversatility (22). Co-twin control designs--often examining\ndiscordant MZ and DZ twins grouped together--have tested\nthe impacts of potential influences on outcomes, such as phys-\nical exercise and job complexity on dementia; physical activity,\nsmoking, and heavy alcohol use on mortality; social class on\ncognitive performance; physical exercise on life satisfaction;\nand so on. Some of these studies have suggested causation\nby exposure to a potential influence, whereas others have\nsuggested genetic and/or environmental confounding.\nGiven the wealth of constructs of interest--both as\npotential influences and important outcomes for successful\naging--these studies represent only a preliminary step\ntoward a comprehensive developmental model of success-\nful aging in later life. How can we best proceed to test the\nmyriad possible combinations of influences and outcomes,\nparticularly given that it is likely patterns of behavior over\nthe life span rather than short-term exposures, that will have\nthe strongest impacts on successful aging? Again, we sug-\ngest the unifying role of personality. It seems likely that the\nanalysis of twins discordant for personality traits, which\nhave broad impacts on a range of behaviors and other influ-\nences, would clarify influence-outcome relationships and\nprovide researchers with useful constructs for further study.\nFor instance, analyses of twins discordant for the personality\ntrait disinhibition might show associations with successful\naging. Researchers could then examine particular aspects of\ndisinhibition (eg, medication noncompliance, risk taking,\nalcohol and substance use, etc.) likely to be associated with\ndifferent types of health outcomes.\nGene-by-Environment Analysis\nTraditional behavior genetic methods assume that the\neffects of genetics, shared environments, and nonshared\nenvironments are relatively set at a given level. For instance,\nFigure 1. Possible co-twin control result patterns. Scenario A suggests a causal\nlink between influence and outcome. Scenario B suggests a genetic third variable\nmay account for the influence-outcome association. Scenario C suggests a shared\nenvironmental third variable may account for the influence-outcome association.\nScenario D suggests genetic and shared environmental third variables may account\nfor the influence-outcome association. These scenarios are intended to be heuristic\nsketches of possible observations, as opposed to involving model-derived precise\npoint values corresponding with the exact heights of the lines in the figure.\nwithin- and between-pair associations between the potential\ninfluence and the outcome, separately in MZ and DZ twins,\na researcher can statistically estimate the outcome level of\nan affected twin had he not been affected and vice versa\n(27). Perhaps more importantly, these approaches also can\ntest causal hypotheses about the association between a\npotentially causal influence and an outcome rather clearly.\nLike traditional behavior genetic analyses, the co-twin con-\ntrol design relies on what we know about the differences\nand similarities between MZ and DZ twins in terms of\nshared genes, shared rearing environments, and unique\nenvironments, as discussed above.\nCo-twin control analyses estimate the magnitude of the\nrelationship between influence and outcome within individ-\nuals in the general population (RWI), within discordant\nMZ twin pairs (RMZ), and within discordant DZ twin pairs\n(RDZ). Four possible resulting scenarios for comparing the\nmagnitudes of these relationships are shown in Figure 1.\nScenario A: If the influence is truly causal (ie, exposure to\nthe influence directly contributes liability to the outcome),\nthen RWI, RMZ, and RDZ will be equivalent--regardless of\none's genetic and shared environmental status, exposure to\nthe influence increases the risk for the outcome. Scenario B:\nIf the influence-outcome association is not causal but is due\nto a genetic third variable that causes both the influence and\noutcome, one would expect RWI to be large, RDZ to be\nsmaller, and RMZ to be smaller still. Scenario C: If the\ninfluence-outcome association is not causal but is due to a\nthird variable residing in shared family environment (eg, child-\nhood socioeconomic status conferring risk to CSA as well\nas psychopathology) causing both influence and outcome,\none would expect RWI to be large and RMZ and RDZ to be\nequivalently lower. This is because both MZ and DZ twins\nexperience the same shared rearing family environments,\nand, regardless of whether or not they were exposed to the\ninfluence, their shared environment predisposes them equally\nto the outcome. Scenario D: Finally, if the influence-\nan approximate 50% heritability for a phenotype (a common\nfinding) is interpreted as 50% of the trait's variation across\nindividuals is due to additive genetic factors; we emphasize\nthat it is not, and should not be interpreted as, that 50% of the\n\"cause\" of a disorder in an individual is due to genetic influ-\nences. Indeed, heritability is a population statistic that tells us\nabout the variation of a phenotype among people not about\nan individual person. However, some compelling behavior\ngenetic models also have the power to get closer to influences\non individuals within the population, by examining interac-\ntions between genetic factors and environments. In other\nwords, the impact of genetic factors (or environments) might\nbe moderated by some other variable--perhaps heritability of\na phenotype differs as a function of another construct. While\nsuch interactions have long been considered theoretically,\nrecent statistical advances (32) have made examining them\nmore empirically tractable, and it has become clear that the\neffects of genetic factors are not static as once believed. We\nnow turn our attention to these models, focusing on what is\ncommonly referred to as gene-by-environment (G \u00d7 E) analy-\nses (albeit these techniques rely on genetic variation discerned\nfrom family data, as opposed to specific measured genetic\npolymorphisms). While other methods of investigating the\nassociations between genetic factors and environments exist\n(eg, the gene\u00adenvironment correlation), we believe G \u00d7 E will\nprovide a particularly important tool for gerontological re-\nsearchers. For information on other models, see Johnson (33).\nThe mathematics behind gene\u00adenvironment interactions\nis complex and beyond the scope of the present report, but\nboth algebraic derivations and theoretical descriptions have\nbeen reported elsewhere for interested readers (32\u00ad34). For\nour purposes, it is sufficient to think about gene by environ-\nment analyses as being conceptually analogous to interac-\ntions in multiple regressions, and we will discuss these\nmethods by example rather than design. To use an example\nof relevance to successful aging, we will review a study of\nthe genetic and environmental contributions to two indica-\ntors of physical health (number of chronic illnesses and body\nmass index; [35]). Although one can think of an aspect of\nphysical health as having a set level of heritability, it is perhaps\noptimal to think of this level of heritability as representing the\nmean genetic influence on physical health when the effect of\nall other influences are removed. For instance, the authors\nnoted that, while physical health has been shown to have a\ngenetic component in previous studies, there is also a robust\nassociation between income level and physical health, such\nthat individuals with higher incomes tend to have better physi-\ncal health. Clearly, genetic factors and environments both\npotentially play a role in physical health outcomes.\nThere are several ways to reconcile the genetic- and\nincome-related findings regarding physical health--among\nthe most statistically elegant is the analysis of G \u00d7 E interac-\ntion. Rather than assuming that genetic and environmental\ncontributions were steady across the full range of income,\nwe (35) tested whether these contributions might differ\nas a function of income. Indeed, this was the case. When\nindividuals earned 1 SD above the income mean, the genetic\nvariance associated with number of chronic illnesses (after\ncontrolling for insurance coverage and education) was .33;\nfor individuals 1 SD below the mean, the associated genetic\nvariance was 1.7 times greater (.55). Similar results were\nreported for body mass index. These trends, which became\neven more pronounced toward the tails of income distribu-\ntion, indicated that the impact of genetic factors on physical\nhealth was moderated by income. At low levels of income,\ngenetic effects are associated strongly with physical health;\nat high levels of income, variance in physical health is due\nmuch less to genetic effects. Why? One hypothesis is that\ngenetic factors provide a diathesis for health problems, and,\nat lower income levels, individuals face higher levels of\nstress (eg, financial, physical stress due to manual labor, etc.)\nthat can activate this diathesis. Importantly, modern methods\ncan also model gene\u00adenvironment correlations in the same\nframework as gene\u00adenvironment interactions, and examina-\ntion of these correlations can also enrich our understanding.\nFor example, in an extension of our first study on income and\nhealth (36), higher gene\u00adenvironment correlations were\nobserved between income and the personality characteristic\nof sense of control, in relatively higher income environments.\nThis may reflect a tendency for similar (eg, personality and\nability) tendencies to affect both an individual's perception of\ncontrol and that individual's income level.\nPhysical health variables aside, how could G \u00d7 E analyses\nbe meaningfully applied to research on successful aging?\nAgain, we return our focus to personality and the supposi-\ntion that personality traits represent reasonable proxies for\nrelatively stable lifelong patterns of behaviors of interest to\ngerontologists. By examining broadband constructs such as\npersonality traits, gerontology researchers can (i) ascertain\nthe genetic and environmental contributions to personality,\n(ii) determine how these contributions are moderated by\nrelevant environmental variables, and (iii) test the effects of\npotentially worthwhile environmental variables as they\nrelate to successful aging. Questions of this sort have already\nbegun to be addressed. For instance, one study examined\nG \u00d7 E with regard to the origins of higher-order personality\ndomains of positive emotionality (a tendency to view life as\npleasurable; including facets of achievement, social close-\nness, social potency, and well-being), negative emotionality\n(a tendency to experience psychological distress, akin to\nneuroticism; including facets of aggression, alienation, and\nstress reactivity), and constraint (a tendency to act cautiously\nand endorse traditional beliefs; including facets of control,\nharm avoidance, and traditionalism; [34]). Clearly, these\ndomains are broad constructs, and they comprise theoreti-\ncally interesting and important facets related to successful\naging (eg, well-being, social factors, risk avoidance, etc.).\nAlthough it had previously been established that the vari-\nance of personality traits such as these is due approximately\n50% to additive genetic effects and 50% to nonshared\ndo not. In addition, the merging of traditional tools (such as\nthe twin study) with novel biological technologies (eg, the\nability to study epigenetic variation at the genomic level) is\nlikely to provide novel insights about the mechanisms\nunderlying individual differences in aging outcomes (38).\nFunding\nThis research was supported in part by National Institute on Aging\nReferences\n1.

For instance,\nas depicted in Figure 2, genetic factors accounted for 35%\nof the variance in positive emotionality when parental\nregard for their children was 2 SDs below the mean; at the\nmean of parental regard, genetic factors accounted for 52%\nof the variance in positive emotionality; at 2 SDs above the\nmean, genetic factors accounted for 76% of the variance in\npositive emotionality. This finding appears to indicate that\nincreasing levels of parental regard provide a stable \"canvas\"\nupon which genetic factors can demonstrate their predis-\nposing effects. The directionality of these links can alter-\nnatively be reversed, highlighting how personality can\nmoderate the genetic and environmental etiologies of the\nparent\u00adchild relationship. Indeed, a separate study taking\nthis perspective demonstrated that the genetic and environ-\nmental influences on parent\u00adchild relationship variables were\nsignificantly moderated by the child's personality traits,\nsuggesting that the child's personality also had an evocative\nimpact on the quality of the parent\u00adchild relationship (37).\nSummary\nStudies of successful aging must move beyond traditional\nframeworks and apply sophisticated methods to understand\ncausality and etiology. Behavior genetic approaches such as\nco-twin control and G \u00d7 E analysis can provide a framework\nfor such analyses. Further, refinement of constructs, beyond\nspecific influences, to relatively stable, lifelong constructs\nthat can pervade multiple aspects of life and account for\nlongstanding patterns of behavior, may be of particular\nimportance. We believe personality traits are worthwhile\nconstructs for study toward these ends. The integration of\npersonality traits with novel analytic methods may provide\ncompelling findings, and help frame new hypotheses, about\nhow and why some individuals age successfully, while others\n18.
