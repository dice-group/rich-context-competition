Building on prior work linking high anger expression to poor health, this cross-sectional study addressed\nwhether anger expression exacerbated age-related risk for metabolic syndrome in a national sample of adults, known as\nMIDUS (Midlife in the United States).\nMethod. Respondents reported anger expression via survey assessments and completed an overnight clinic visit.\nResults.Unadjusted metabolic syndrome prevalence was 40.6%. Men, less educated individuals, and those who\nreported not getting regular physical activity were at significantly higher risk for metabolic syndrome. Anger expression\ndid not predict higher risk for metabolic syndrome in main effects models, but it moderated the relationship between age\nand metabolic syndrome. Age-associated risk for metabolic syndrome was significant only for adults with high anger\nexpression.\nDiscussion. Among older adults, anger expression predicted higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Older adults\nreporting low anger expression had metabolic syndrome rates comparable to younger adults. Results highlight that failing\nto show the frequently observed decline in anger expression with age may have pernicious health concomitants.\nKey Words: Anger expression--Emotion regulation--Life course or developmental change--Metabolic syndrome.\nEmotional well-being is generally preserved or\nimproved with age. Cross-sectional and longitudinal\nresearch shows fewer negative emotions with age, whereas\npositive emotions are maintained or increased (Carstensen\nOlder adults report fewer experiences and expressions of\nanger and greater anger control compared with younger\nadults (Phillips, Henry, Hosie, & Milne, 2006; Schieman,\nhowever, capture important individual differences in anger\namong older persons. This study addressed variability\namong older adults in the link between anger and later\nlife health risks, an important question given that aging\nis known to increase risk for diabetes and cardiovascular\ndiseases (Berry et al., 2012; Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention, 2011). The central question was whether\nolder adults who fail to show the lower levels of anger doc-\numented in prior research have greater risk for metabolic\nsyndrome, a known cardiovascular risk factor.\nOur formulation draws on the strength and vulnerability\nintegration (SAVI) model, which postulates that the advan-\ntages in emotional well-being with age may be attenuated, or\neliminated, under conditions of elevated arousal, given that\nolder adults have reduced physiological flexibility (Charles,\n2010). The model adds that physiological reactivity from\nstressors, including emotional stressors, may increase car-\ndiovascular health risks due to frequent arousal accompanied\nby a loss of physiological resilience with older age. Anger\nis understudied in this context, even though it is a prototypi-\ncal high arousal negative emotion associated with heightened\nphysiological reactivity (Levenson, 1992). As a test of the\nSAVI model, we hypothesized that older adults who reported\ngreater anger expression, believed to be accompanied by\nmore frequent physiological reactivity, would be at higher\nrisk for metabolic syndrome than older adults who show the\nmore typical pattern of better emotional experience and regu-\nlation, defined here in terms of lower anger expression.\nMany factors may contribute to heightened anger among\nolder adults. For example, greater susceptibility to poor\nhealth, financial strain, role loss, and spousal loss are\nall chronic stressors faced in middle and old age (Scott,\nWhitehead, Bergeman, & Pitzer, 2013). Older adults with\ngreater chronic disease burden and lower self-rated health\ndemonstrated less healthy personality profiles, including\nhigher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness, which may\nalso be accompanied by high anger (Sutin, Zonderman,\nstudy demonstrated that experiencing negative social interac-\ntions, defined as interactions causing irritation, frustration, or\nannoyance, all key components of anger, was more strongly\nrelated to negative affect in middle-aged and older adults\ncompared with younger adults (Birditt, 2013). This sug-\ngests that when negative interactions occur, older adults are\naffected more negatively by them. Together, these findings\nBoylan and Ryff\nhighlight variability in anger among older adults, and the cur-\nrent study examines the health correlates of such a profile.\nAnger expression has well-established ties to cardio-\nvascular and metabolic disease (Chida & Steptoe, 2009;\nEverson et al., 1999; Schum, Jorgensen, Verhaeghen, Sauro,\n& Thibodeau, 2003). Long-standing interest in the cardio-\ntoxic effects of expressing anger dates back to a 1896 pub-\nlication entitled \"The Physiologic Effects of the Indulgence\nin Anger\" (JAMA, 1896). Further, prospective and cross-\nsectional research showing that greater anger expression\nand related constructs like hostility predict increased risk\nof metabolic syndrome (Cohen, Panguluri, Na, & Whooley,\n2007), although some studies failed to find an association\nMetabolic syndrome is a constellation of risk factors,\nincluding central obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia,\nand hypertension, associated with increased risk for coro-\nnary heart disease, Type II diabetes, functional limitations,\nand mortality (Alberti, Zimmet, & Shaw, 2006; Beavers\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003\u00ad\n2006 indicated the unadjusted prevalence of metabolic syn-\ndrome was 34.4% and identified age as a key risk factor.\nUsing data from a national sample of adults known as\nMIDUS (Midlife in the United States), we first examined\ncross-sectional age differences in anger expression and\nmetabolic syndrome prevalence, predicting anger expres-\nsion would be lower and metabolic syndrome prevalence\nwould be greater among older adults. Second, we tested\nassociations between anger expression and metabolic syn-\ndrome. The targeted question, however, was whether indi-\nvidual differences in anger expression would moderate the\nrelationship between age and metabolic syndrome, testing\nthe hypothesis that greater anger expression heightens age-\nrelated risk for metabolic syndrome.\nMethod\ntutionalized adults recruited through random digit dial-\ning (RDD) from the 48 contiguous states. The sample\nincluded siblings from some RDD respondents as well as\nsome twins (Brim, Ryff, & Kessler, 2004; Radler & Ryff,\na 75% retention rate. Biological data were collected from\na subset of respondents (N = 1,255) who traveled to one\nof three General Clinical Research Centers (GCRCs) for\nan overnight clinic visit. There was a 43% response rate,\nreflective of the demanding protocol and extensive travel\nrequired for many participants (Love, Seeman, Weinstein,\n& Ryff, 2010). The biological subsample was comparable\nwith the full MIDUS II sample on most demographic and\nhealth characteristics, though was better educated and less\nlikely to smoke than nonparticipants (Love et al., 2010).\nThis study was approved by Institutional Review Boards\nat Georgetown University, University of California, Los\nAngeles, and University of Wisconsin\u00adMadison. All par-\nticipants provided written informed consent.\nAnger Expression\nAnger expression was assessed using the anger-out\nsubscale from Spielberger's State-Trait Anger Expression\nInventory (Spielberger, 1996). Participants completed the\ninventory at the clinic, indicating how often (1 = almost\nnever; 4 = almost always) they expressed their anger out-\nwardly when they felt angry or furious. The scale contained\neight items, and internal consistency was 0.77.\nMetabolic Syndrome\nMetabolic syndrome was defined by the International\nDiabetes Federation definition (Alberti et al., 2006).\nParticipants were classified as meeting metabolic syndrome\ncriteria when they had central obesity and at least two out\nof the following risk factors: triglycerides (150\nmg/dL),\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (<40mg/dL in men or\nmg/dL in women), blood pressure (130\nmm Hg sys-\ntolic or 85mm Hg diastolic), and high fasting plasma glu-\nmg/dL or Type II diabetes diagnosis). For the\nclassification of central obesity, waist circumference cutoffs\nwere greater than or equal to 94cm for men and greater than\ncm for women, measured at the narrowest\npoint between the ribs and iliac crest by GCRC staff. Blood\npressure was assessed in a seated position 3 times consecu-\ntively with a 30-s interval between each measurement. The\ntwo most similar readings were averaged. The lipid panel\nand glucose were assessed from a fasting blood sample\ntaken on the morning of the second day of the GCRC visit\n(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).\nCovariates\nControl variables included gender, educational attain-\nment, race (coded to reflect white or black/African\nAmerican), current smoking status, alcohol consumption\nover the previous month, regular physical activity (at least\n20min 3 or more times per week), and chronic conditions\n(sum of those experienced or treated within the previous\n12 months, such as diabetes, stroke, and hypertension).\nResults\nTable 1 provides sample descriptive information as well\nas bivariate correlations. Unadjusted metabolic syndrome\nprevalence was 40.6%. Older adults were more likely to\nbe white/Caucasian and less likely to smoke. Age was\nrelated to less frequent anger expressions, lower alcohol\nAnger, Aging, Metabolic Syndrome\nconsumption, greater waist circumference, higher sys-\ntolic blood pressure, lower diastolic blood pressure, and\ngreater likelihood of having metabolic syndrome in bivar-\niate analyses. When age was stratified into tertiles, there\nwere significant age differences in anger expression such\nthat each age tertile reported significantly lower anger\nStandardized age and anger expression were entered\nas predictors of metabolic syndrome diagnostic status in\nthe first step of a logistic regression analysis, controlling\nfor demographic factors and health covariates. An inter-\naction between age and anger expression was entered\nin the next step. Results are presented in Table 2. Men\nment (Wald = 8.06, p < .01), more chronic conditions\n(Wald = 6.28, p = .01) were at significantly higher risk\nfor metabolic syndrome. Anger expression did not predict\nmetabolic syndrome (Wald = 0.02, p = .88). However, the\ninteraction between age and anger expression was signifi-\ncant, Wald = 4.23, p = .04.

Neither interac-\ntion was significant, suggesting that the reported findings\nare not driven by males.\nTo assess the nature of the obtained interaction, we\nexamined simple slopes reflecting the relationship between\nage and metabolic syndrome at three levels of anger expres-\nsion: at 1 SD below the mean, at the mean level, and at 1\nSD above the mean. Adjusting for all covariates, the rela-\ntionship between age and metabolic syndrome was only\nsignificant at high levels of anger expression (B = 0.23,\nWald = 5.22, p = .02). Age and metabolic syndrome were\nnot significantly related at average (B = 0.09, Wald = 1.83,\np = .18) and low levels of anger expression (B = -0.05,\nWald = 0.31, p = .58). These simple slopes are graphed in\nFigure 1, where the y-axis reflects the predicted probabili-\nties of meeting metabolic syndrome criteria for each partici-\npant based on the final regression model, which adjusted for\nSupplemental Analyses\nBecause the MIDUS includes siblings and twins of the\nRDD sample, assumptions of independent observations\nare violated. To address these dependencies, mixed effects\nmodels with random intercepts for family clusters were used\nto rerun analyses. All conclusions drawn from the mixed\neffects models are unchanged from those reported earlier.\nDiscussion\nAging involves juxtapositions between gains and losses.\nOn the one hand, physical health tends to decline, but emo-\ntional well-being may hold steady or improve. We predicted\nthat older adults who did not show the typical pattern of\ndownregulation in anger expression would be at greater risk\nfor metabolic syndrome. As hypothesized, greater anger\nexpression (i.e., being more likely to express anger out-\nwardly when anger is felt) was associated with an increased\nprobability of having metabolic syndrome among older\nadults. The pattern of effects was apparent, though weaker,\namong middle-aged adults, and not apparent at all, among\nthe younger adults. Importantly, older adults reporting low\nanger expression did not exhibit the expected age-related\nincrease in risk for metabolic syndrome and instead dem-\nonstrated comparable risk to their younger counterparts.\nNonsignificant interactions with gender suggest that these\nfindings were consistent in both men and women.\nThe findings support the SAVI model, which suggests\nthat age-related advantages in emotional well-being may be\nattenuated or even eliminated when physiological vulnera-\nbilities are at play under situations of high arousal (Charles,\n2010). Anger is a high arousal negative emotion associ-\nated with physiological reactivity (Levenson, 1992); high\nanger also predicts increased risk for cardiovascular and\nmetabolic disease in prospective research (Chida & Steptoe,\nSchum et al., 2003). On average, older adults experience\nand express anger less frequently than younger adults\nthat some may learn more effective strategies to regulate\nFigure 1.Predicted probability of metabolic syndrome by age and anger expression. The lines represent the simple slopes for age and metabolic syndrome\n\nrelationship at different levels of anger. Low anger reflects less than 1 SD from the mean, and high anger reflects greater than 1 SD from the mean. Only the simple\nslope between age and metabolic syndrome at high anger expression was significant.\nAnger, Aging, Metabolic Syndrome\ntheir emotions with age and rely less on strategies that have\nnegative consequences (John & Gross, 2004; Scheibe &\nCarstensen, 2010). Indeed, we found a significant negative\nrelationship between age and anger expression in our sam-\nple. As SAVI theorizes, however, our results highlight that\nolder adults who failed to show the typical decline in anger\nwith age are at increased risk for metabolic syndrome com-\npared with same-aged adults reporting fewer expressions\nof anger.\nA key assumption behind this formulation is that more\nfrequent physiological arousal underlies increased rates of\nmetabolic syndrome among older adults with high anger.\nDue to reduced flexibility in biological systems with age,\nphysical health may be negatively affected by the increased\narousal. Although not explicitly measured in our study,\nresearch in other domains lends credence to this perspec-\ntive. Middle-aged adults who reported greater anger in\nresponse to a laboratory stressor exhibited greater pro-\nduction of proinflammatory cytokines during a laboratory\nstressor (Carroll et al., 2011). Adults who displayed more\nnegative behavior during a marital conflict in the laboratory\nalso showed greater endocrine activation and poorer immu-\nnological health in response to the conflict (Kiecolt-Glaser\net al., 1997). Whether such profiles of high anger and asso-\nciated exaggerated physiological reactivity in the labora-\ntory prospectively predict disease is an important avenue\nfor future research.\nSeveral caveats should be noted. Limited representation\nof racial and ethnic minority group members precludes\ngeneralizing results to other racial/ethnic groups, where\nanger may be experienced to a greater extent (Barefoot\net al., 1991). The cross-sectional nature of this research\ndoes not allow the direction of effects to be resolved; lon-\ngitudinal data are needed to establish temporal precedence\namong anger and metabolic syndrome. However, we found\nthat changes in self-rated health over a 10-year time span\nwere unrelated to anger expression (data not shown), which\nsomewhat reduces concern of reverse causation (i.e., that\npoor health leads to increased anger expression among\nolder adults).\nDespite these limitations, a strength of this report was\nthe integration of a well-established risk factor for poor\nmetabolic health (i.e., age) with a core aspect of emotional\nexperience, the tendency to outwardly express anger. We\ndemonstrated that both are important for understanding\nmetabolic risk associated with aging. Specifically, older\nadults who expressed their anger outwardly had the high-\nest health risks, whereas older adults who reported fewer\nanger expressions exhibited comparable probabilities of\nmetabolic syndrome to adults several decades younger. An\nimportant implication of the findings is whether anger man-\nagement strategies might be useful for older adults prone to\noutwardly express their anger, with possible prophylactic\nimplications for metabolic syndrome and subsequent car-\ndiovascular disease.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Institute on Aging at the\nfollow-up of the MIDUS investigation.
