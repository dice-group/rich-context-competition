As a result, the long-term care\ncontinuum for older people with mental health problems (including those with dementia),\nwhich has traditionally ranged from care at home to admission to a care home or long-stay\nhospital ward is changing. The overriding aim is to enable older people to live at home as\nlong as possible. Furthermore, where some form of residential care is required, the desire is\nto make this as homelike as possible (Moise, Schwarzinger, & Um, 2004). To this end, a\nrange of new facilities have been developed which provide `housing with care' for older\npeople, including a number of specialist facilities for older people with dementia (Evans et\nal., 2012; Verbeek, Van Rossum, Zwakhalen, Kempen & Hamers, 2009). Some of these\ninitiatives are designed to serve as alternatives to long-term care home placement, such as\nthe small-scale living complexes found in the Netherlands (Verbeek et al., 2009) and the\nGreen Houses seen in the US (Kane, Lum, Cutler, Degenholtz, & Yu, 2007); others are\npositioned at an intermediate point between living at home and institutional care, such as\nSweden's group living schemes (Annerstedt, 1994).\nIn the United Kingdom, a number of extra care housing (ECH) facilities have been\ndeveloped with the intent of providing a community-based alternative to care home place-\nment (Department of Health, 2010). Although there is no standard definition of ECH (also\nknown as very sheltered housing), such schemes typically offer older people their own flat as\nwell as care and support in a purpose-built complex designed with the needs of highly\ndependent people in mind (Department of Health, 2010; Netten, Darton, B\naumker, &\nCallaghan, 2011). Personal care (often provided by an on-site care team) is generally avail-\nable 24 hours a day and communal facilities typically include a laundry, restaurant/dining\nroom and lounge (Laing & Buisson, 2010).\nTo date, several studies have explored the characteristics of ECH residents and how they\ndiffer from those of older people living at home or in a care home (B\naumker, Netten, &\nECH residents need more assistance with personal care and domestic tasks than older\npeople living at home (Netten et al., 2011), but less assistance with activities of daily\nliving (ADLs) than care home residents (Darton et al., 2012). Nevertheless, over half of\nECH residents are unable to go outdoors or manage steps or stairs, a similar proportion\nrequire assistance with washing and bathing, and over a third need help with dressing\nOther research has focused on the ability of ECH to promote independence and security\nand reduce isolation (B\n& Holland, 2016). For example, one English study found that older people who had moved\ninto ECH identified a significant decrease in their unmet needs and a significant increase in\ntheir quality of life compared with their situation at home (B\nreported that 80% of ECH residents described their social well-being as either `good' or `as\ngood as it can be'; 90% had made new friends; 85% were positive about their social life; and\n75% were occupied in activities of their choice (Callaghan, Netten, & Darton, 2009).\nAlthough such studies have included people with cognitive impairment, they have usually\nformed only a minority of the sample, and it has often been suggested that older people with\ndementia are less likely to participate (and hence be socially isolated) than other residents in\nNevertheless, there is mounting evidence to show that the quality of life of people with\ndementia in ECH is generally good, particularly where staff have specialist dementia exper-\ntise, enabling them to develop meaningful relationships and provide specialised activities\nIn contrast, there has been little focus on how recommendations of ECH entry are made\nby frontline staff and managers. Indeed, although many studies have examined the factors\nthat predict care home admission for people with dementia (Gaugler, Yu, Krichbaum, &\nahler, K\nonig, & Riedel-Heller, 2008), evidence is lacking\nabout the factors that predict transition to ECH, or health and social care professionals'\nperspectives on the best use of such facilities (i.e. who is most appropriately supported in\nECH). This is despite the fact that such information would seem to be of great value to\nservice planners seeking to optimise resource use and to frontline practitioners, facilitating\nthe provision of advice and transition planning. Against this background, this paper\npresents new, previously unpublished analysis of the views of a range of frontline practi-\ntioners and managers on when ECH is the most appropriate option for older people with\nmental health problems, in particular dementia, and examines the barriers to its wider use\nwith this client group.\nMethods\nThis paper uses three strands of data (see Table 1) to explore the potential use of ECH for\ncurrent care home entrants in Site X, a `prospering smaller town' whose older residents had\na sociodemographic profile resembling England as a whole, albeit the proportion from\nethnic minorities was less than half the English average. At the time the study was con-\nducted, the number of people in long-stay residential care was close to the England average\nhome beds. The local authority was interested in exploring the use of ECH as an alternative\nto care home placement and had recently upgraded several sheltered housing complexes into\nECH for older people; however none of these were specifically dedicated to the care of\npeople with dementia. The data were collected as part of a Balance of Care (BoC) study,\nwhich sought to identify the most appropriate mix of community and institutional services\nto provide for older people with mental health problems in North-West England (Challis et\nal., 2014; Tucker, Brand, Wilberforce, Abenstern, & Challis, 2015). Balance of care is a long-\nstanding strategic planning framework, identifying people whose needs can be met in more\nthan one setting (e.g. in hospital or at home) and exploring the potential costs and con-\nsequences of changing the mix of services provided in a simulation exercise grounded in the\nknowledge of frontline practitioners (Challis & Hughes, 2002; Clarkson, Hughes, & Challis,\nVerbeek et al. 3\nStrand 1. Care planning workshop. The identification of care home entrants for\nwhom ECH could be more appropriate: Frontline practitioners' recommendations\nAnonymised information on 169 older (65\u00fe) care home entrants with mental health prob-\nlems was collected by their care co-ordinators. Data collection was undertaken in 2010/2011\nand encompassed details of individuals' sociodemographic, functional and clinical charac-\nteristics, including a number of standardised measures (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975;\nYesavage et al., 1983). Further information was collected on individuals' recent service\nreceipt and reason for admission. Short-term admissions for planned respite or intermediate\ncare and people moving from one care home to another were excluded.\nThe sample was divided into subgroups of people with similar needs for care on the basis\nof three variables deemed important in determining the locus of care (Tucker et al., 2008).\nThese were the individuals' need for help with ADLs, their level of cognitive impairment and\nthe presence of behaviours that carers often find hard to manage (Table 2). As each of these\nvariables had three levels, we could generate 27 unique combinations of these variables,\nrepresenting subgroups or `case types' of patients (3 \u00c2 3 \u00c2 3).\nA series of vignettes (n \u00bc 14) were formulated to exemplify the most commonly populated\ncase types. These were based on real individuals in the dataset and took the form of short case\nsummaries depicting the person's situation immediately before care home entry \u00ad the point at\nwhich alternative care options could realistically have been considered. Each vignette sys-\ntematically incorporated information about the three key variables listed above, as well as the\nrisk of falling, physical health status, living situation, service receipt, location on assessment\n(hospital or home) and care preferences. An example of a vignette is given in Box 1.\nA range of frontline practitioners (NHS and Social Care staff) were invited to a care\nplanning workshop in October 2011 at which the most appropriate ways of meeting the\nneeds of the people depicted in the vignettes were explored. Workshop participants (n \u00bc 17)\nwere divided into small multidisciplinary groups, each of which was allocated six vignettes.\nTable 1.

Still in their small\ngroups, participants then chose case types for whom they felt care at home or in ECH was\na realistic proposition, and specified the care services and professional support needed to\nachieve this. For the purposes of this exercise, participants were asked to put aside any\nshort-term constraints in current services (including the then lack of ECH specifically\ndedicated for people with dementia) and to think creatively, whilst remembering that all\nprovision inevitably has funding implications. A list of services available in other parts of\nthe country was provided to facilitate this activity, and a comprehensive costing approach\nwas subsequently used to estimate the weekly costs of the proposed community care\npackages.\nDescriptive statistics were used to characterise the recommendations for each case type\n(vignette), and modelling was employed to illuminate the decision-making process. The\ndecisions of individual practitioners and small groups formed the analysis dataset, and a\nmultinomial logistic regression was undertaken to explore the factors associated with the\nchoices made.\nStrand 2. Simulated resource allocation management panel. The identification of\ncare home entrants for whom ECH could be more appropriate: social care\nmanagers' views\nDetails of the case types for whom practitioner groups recommended community care (in-\ncluding ECH) were presented at a specially convened meeting of the Site X Resource\nAllocation Management (RAM) Panel in November 2011. This was composed of three\nsenior social care managers who acted as gatekeepers for access to long-term care home\nTable 2.

The Panel was asked to consider each case and to decide whether or not the\nproposed alternative support arrangements were: (i) appropriate; (ii) sufficient to enable the\ndepicted individuals to remain in the community; and (iii) fundable.\nThis exercise took the form of an in-vivo simulation of a normal RAM Panel meeting and\nutilised local proformas containing information on:\n\u00b7 The individuals' needs (as depicted in the vignettes);\nBox 1. An example of a vignette, Mrs E living with dementia.\nMrs E\nSociodemographic information\nMrs E is an 80-year-old lady who usually lives with her husband. She is currently an inpatient at the\ndistrict general hospital where she has been treated for a urinary tract infection and delirium.\nInformation about care needs:\n1. Activities of daily living: Mrs E is very active and has no problems mobilising in or outdoors. She\nis, however, occasionally incontinent of urine. Whilst she can wash, dress and feed herself, she\nneeds much encouragement to change her clothes (which she often sleeps in) and can rarely be\npersuaded to have a bath. She looks tired and dishevelled.\n2. Physical health: Mrs E is prone to urinary tract infections and takes medication for high blood\npressure. Her physical health is otherwise very good.\n3. Cognition/mood: Mrs E was diagnosed with vascular dementia two years ago, now moderate in\ndegree. Whilst she has obvious short-term memory problems and frequently struggles to express\nherself, her family can generally understand what she says. There is no indication that she is depressed.\n4. Behaviour: Mrs E appears restless and agitated. She repeatedly picks at her clothing and spends\nmuch time walking around the ward with a purposeful stride. Indeed, on two occasions she has left\nthe ward without detection. Whilst she is not usually physically aggressive, she often becomes\nangry when offered personal care and has on occasion spat at staff. She sleeps poorly and is now\ncared for in a single room because she was disturbing other patients at night. This behaviour is not\nnew, and mirrors that she displayed at home.\nCurrent care:\n1. Informal support: Mrs E's main carer is her husband, who is himself 85 years old. In recent years,\nhe has undertaken all the household tasks, including shopping, cooking and cleaning, and has pro-\nvided a high degree of support for his wife. His daughter and granddaughter are also supportive, but\nall three feel that they have reached their limit in caring for Mrs E at home.\n2. Formal care package: Mrs E is well known to her the local social services team but has never\nreceived a formal care package, having resisted any external help. The community mental health\nteam are also involved and, prior to Mrs E's current admission, were trying to persuade her to\naccept day care.\nAssessment issues:\n1. Risk factors: Mrs E is a fit and active lady who needs constant supervision. In the last few months,\nthere have been a number of occasions on which she has left her home unobserved, and whilst she\ndoes not usually get very far, her husband has twice had to involve the police. Both he and his family\nare clearly very stressed by the prospect of Mrs E returning home.\n2. Attitude to future care. Mrs E herself is adamant that she wants to return home and that she\ndoes not need any help. It is not thought she has the capacity to make an informed decision about\nthe future however.\n\u00b7 Their actual care home placement (with or without nursing, for older people generally or\ndementia specific) including the cost to social services; and\n\u00b7 The alternative community care packages proposed by practitioners, including the esti-\nmated cost to social services.\nWith the participants' consent, the RAM Panel discussion was audio-recorded, and the\ntranscript was professionally transcribed. A framework approach was used to manage and\ninterpret the data (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994; Spencer, Ritchie, O'Connor, Morrell, &\nOrmston, 2014). This matrix-based system was developed to support thematic analysis\nand involves a series of stages to familiarise, sort, index and summarise data, allowing\nmovement between levels of abstraction, whilst staying close to the original material.\nData are summarised by both case and subtheme facilitating cross and within case analysis.\nThree authors (HV, ST, MA) undertook this task individually, with later discussion to\nchallenge and refine themes and build understanding and consensus, a method that was\nboth iterative and comprehensive.\nStrand 3. Real life care home applications: Reasons for not considering ECH\nFree text information on the reasons why ECH was not considered suitable for actual care\nhome entrants, the vast majority of whom had significant cognitive impairment or dementia,\nwas extracted from real life (anonymised) care home application proformas (n \u00bc 61) com-\npleted by care co-ordinators and presented to the RAM Panel over a three-month period in\n2010. Coding used conventional content analysis (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004). This\nderives themes/categories directly from the data at hand (avoiding the use of preconceived\ncategories), making it an appropriate approach for exploratory analyses (Hsieh & Shannon,\n2005). Interpretation was limited to manifest content, i.e. which is visible and obvious\n(Graneheim & Lundman, 2004). Two researchers (HV and ST) independently analysed\nthe data to identify basic codes, which were subsequently grouped into broader categories\nand refined and compared in discussion with a third team member (MW).\nEthics\nEthical approval for the study as a whole was granted by the then Cambridgeshire 3\nResearch Ethics Committee (reference number 10/H0306/51) and research governance pro-\ncedures in each participating organisation were fulfilled.\nResults\nStrand 1. Care planning workshop. Identification of care home entrants for whom ECH\ncould be more appropriate: Frontline staff's recommendations\nOf the 169 care home entrants, just over half were !85 and 68% were female. Although the\nvast majority had previously lived at home (8% lived in ECH), most were admitted to a care\nhome directly from hospital (49% from a general ward and 9% from a psychiatric ward).\nApproximately two-thirds had at least medium ADL dependency; more than four-fifths had\nmedium or high levels of cognitive impairment; and a still higher proportion presented with\nVerbeek et al. 7\nmedium or high levels of challenging behaviour. Full details of the study sample are avail-\nOf the 27 case types used to characterise the care home entrants, 23 were populated. As\nwould be expected, some combinations of characteristics were more prevalent than others,\nand in combination the 14 vignettes represented 77% of the sample (see Table 2). Nine of\nthe vignettes depicted people with a formal diagnosis of dementia, whilst three others\ndepicted people with some degree of cognitive impairment (including memory loss, disori-\nentation to time and word-finding difficulties). The remaining two had no significant cog-\nnitive impairment, but had marked anxiety or depression.\nAs noted, 17 (frontline and managerial) staff participated in the care-planning workshop,\nand each of the 14 vignettes was considered by at least six individuals (maximum 11).\nMental health nurses were the most frequently represented discipline, but other participants\nincluded social work and housing staff. Altogether, individual participants made a total of\n102 recommendations, of which 37 were for ECH \u00ad 23 for ECH for older people generally\nand 14 for dementia-specific ECH (see Table 3). Indeed, at least one individual recom-\nFourteen alternative care plans were formulated by the multidisciplinary groups, of\nwhich seven identified ECH as the most appropriate care setting (see Table 3). These\npertained to six case types, of which three represented people with a formal diagnosis of\ndementia and two represented people with evident cognitive impairment.\nMultinomial logistic regression analyses of recommendations of individual practitioners\nfound that previous receipt of social care and being in hospital on assessment increased the\nlikelihood that ECH would be seen as more appropriate than care at home. ECH was not\nrecommended for those individuals who needed care at night.

Neither living alone\nnor the need for care at night influenced the recommendation of care home entry (Table 4).\nStrand 2. Simulated resource allocation management panel. The identification of care\nhome entrants for whom ECH could be more appropriate: view of social care managers\nWhen presented with the details of the five care home case types with dementia/evident cog-\nnitive impairment for which the staff groups recommended ECH, the RAM Panel supported\nECH for just one (case type 22). Furthermore, the home of the individual depicted in this case\nwas described as physically unsuitable to meet their needs, meaning a change of residence was\n(at least in the short-term) inevitable. In each other case, the Panel favoured care at home.\nFive main themes relating to the rejection of ECH as the most appropriate care setting\nwere identified from the RAM Panel discussion: (1) the desire to support people at home\nwherever possible; (2) the wish to support individuals' preferences; (3) the need to avoid\npotentially disruptive moves; (4) uncertainty about at what stage in the care pathway ECH\nwas most appropriate for people with dementia and (5) the lack of sufficient information to\njustify such a move.\nPerhaps, the most pervasive of these was the Panel's strong desire to support people with\ndementia at home wherever possible for as long as possible (taking into account the risks the\nperson would face in doing so). `Our key brief and our key principle is that we will always\ntry and support somebody in their own home'.\nWhen considering whether a proposed move to ECH was appropriate for a particular\nperson, for example, the Panel often started by asking whether or not the individual had\nany needs that could not be met at home, or whether all home care options had been\n`exhausted': `I suppose from my perspective just before we got to this level [ECH] I suppose\nwe're looking to see what additional support can we provide within the home. . .' (Case type\n9). `What would extra care housing give her that we couldn't provide by enhancing her care\npackage?' (Case type 17).\nTable 4. Characteristics influencing decision making of practitioners.\nOdds ratio (base) Standard error Z p\nOwn home\nExtra care housing\nCare home\nADL: activity of daily living.\nVerbeek et al. 9\nSecond, whilst staying in one's own home appeared to be seen as a `good' in itself, the\ndesire to support the person's wishes was often cited in support of their decision: `You\nknow, if somebody was really keen on returning home and wanting to stay there and\nthat was their wishes, then we'd look to support those' (Case type 22).\nHowever, analysis suggested that where individuals (or more often their family) felt they\ncouldn't remain at home and/or expressed fears about their ability to cope, the Panel's initial\nresponse was still to see if they could address/overcome these issues by providing more\nsupport at home. Talking about the situation of Mrs E in Box 1, for example, for whom\nthey were inclined to provide support at home, they noted that:\nIt doesn't say anywhere in here that the husband or the family are saying that actually with\nadditional support they feel they would, . . . be able to support her at home. So I mean, realis-\ntically, that's a piece of work that really does have to be undertaken before you go anywhere\nbecause they're saying they're at their limit. (Case type 9)\nA third theme captured the Panel's desire to avoid a change of residence for older people\nwith dementia on the basis that moving was a major upheaval, could potentially make\npeople less independent (e.g. increase disorientation) and may, if the individual's condi-\ntion subsequently deteriorated, be for a short-period only: `Maybe the issue around\nprognosis does come into it somewhere in terms of presumably she might not want\nanother change of accommodation. If that was unclear. . . I think that would be key\nto it, wouldn't it. . .' (Case type 13). `That's always a quandary. . . for someone to move,\nto then possibly find themselves in a position in 8/10 months' time of having to move\nagain. . .' (Case type 17).\nIndeed, identifying the optimal time to move to ECH was identified as a fourth theme of\nitself, and seemed to pose the Panel something of a quandary, as whilst they considered that\nolder people with dementia would be more likely to adapt to ECH if they moved at a\nrelatively early stage in their illness (the long-term perspective), they also wished to prevent\nany unnecessary moves (the short-term perspective) and were concerned that people may\nsubsequently need to move into a care home (the long-term perspective):\nLooking at placements for extra care at an earlier point is sometimes more useful for people\nbecause it gives an opportunity to orientate, but then you're left with the dilemma of will it\nultimately still lead to a place in a residential home in which case you've had several moves. And\nI suppose on that basis you do try to support people as long as possible as well at home. . . so\nyou've got sometimes a bit of a dilemma. (general discussion)\nFifth, a lack of information about the person's situation (with too many issues not clarified)\nor the possibility that the person's mental or physical health might improve, was also often\ngiven as a reason for preferring to support a person at home, at least in the short-term:\nClearly this lady is at the moment in hospital. She's got a urinary tract infection sort of over-\nlaying on her diagnosis anyway of vascular dementia. . . This lady will need some time, and in\nterms of . . . her behaviour, you know, perhaps situational. . . (Case type 9)\nBy way of contrast, the Panel's arguments in favour of ECH largely related to its ability to\nalleviate social isolation or mitigate risk, albeit they did not appear entirely convinced of\nthis. Thus, although they stated that ECH could offer `extra reassurance that there is some-\nbody around if needed' (Case type 13), they also noted that it could `be fairly isolating for\nsome people' (Case type 2) and typically looked to meet people's need for social contact in\ndifferent ways, including the provision of regular home and day care.\nStrand 3. Reasons for not considering ECH in actual care home applications\nThe reasons care coordinators (frontline practitioners) gave for not considering ECH for\nactual care home entrants fell into five main categories: the extent of care the person needed;\nthe level of individuals' needs; the perceived inability of ECH to maintain people's safety;\nthe desire to respect the individual's (or family's) wishes; and the previous, unsuccessful trial\nof ECH.\nThe first and most common of these (noted in 42 applications) concerned the extent of the\ncare the person needed, which was perceived to exceed that available in ECH. This was\nexpressed in several different ways. For instance, many care co-ordinators highlighted the\nfrequency of care service users required, including the need for `care throughout the 24 hour\nperiod' or `24 hour supervision', whilst eight applications stated that the person needed\nsomebody with them at all times to prevent them becoming distressed. Other applications\nrather emphasised the degree of care the person required (e.g. needs two carers and hoisting)\nor the fact that care inputs could not be regularly scheduled (e.g. ECH would not be a viable\noption. . . due to the unpredictability of his toileting needs), whilst the need for care at night or\nnursing care were also seen as prohibitive.\nComing at this in a different way, in 27 cases care coordinators emphasised the level of\nindividuals' needs (the second category), arguing that these were too severe/complex to be\nmet in ECH. In some cases, no further detail was given. However, many applications made\nreference to specific psychological or behavioural concerns, predominantly people's levels of\ncognitive impairment, anxiety and depression. In one instance, for example, ECH was\ndeemed unsuitable because of the person's `agitated state and verbal aggression', whilst in\nanother instance, it was stated that the individual's `level of disorientation' made ECH in-\nappropriate. By contrast, only two applications referred to the extent of people's physical\nneeds.\nRelated to the above, a third category concerned the perceived inability of ECH to\nmaintain people's safety. This was mentioned in 15 applications, with ECH seen as partic-\nularly inappropriate for people at risk of falls. However, the same argument was sometimes\nmade for people reported to wander.\nThe fourth set of reasons related to the older person's or family's wishes, which were\nmentioned in connection with 17 applications. Some of these were linked to the person's\naforementioned level of needs. However, a more common scenario was that the person had\nbeen temporarily placed in a care home in response to a crisis, and had since settled, such\nthat they/their family or staff were reluctant to consider another move. Frequently, how-\never, no explanation was given other than that the person or their relatives did not want to\nconsider ECH.\nFinally, in a handful of cases, ECH was said to have been tried and unsuccessful (n \u00bc 3),\nor unavailable (n \u00bc 3), there no suitable schemes within the area the person wanted to live in\nor no vacant flats at the right time.\nDiscussion\nThis study provides new insight into views of frontline practitioners (including care coor-\ndinators) and social care managers on the appropriate use of ECH for older people with\nmental health problems and identifies potential barriers to its greater employment. As in-\ndicated in the first strand of the results from the care planning workshop, frontline staff\nviewed ECH as a valuable alternative to care home placement for a significant minority of\ncurrent care home entrants, particularly people with a formal diagnosis of dementia or\nevident cognitive problems who lived alone. However, ECH was not recommended for\npeople who needed care at night. Indeed, the third strand of the results, the analysis of\nreal care home applications, showed that the need for more care (and in particular more\nfrequent \u00ad often 24 hour \u00ad care) than was perceived to be available was given as a reason for\nnot considering ECH in more than two-thirds of actual care home applications. In contrast,\nthe second strand of the findings, the analysis of the RAM Panel meeting, revealed that\nsocial care managers appeared overwhelmingly focused on maintaining people at home, and\nsaw few if any advantages to ECH for the presented case types, despite expressing general\nsupport for this form of housing.\nLooking across the different datasets, this study indicates a lack of clarity as to the place\nof ECH in the care spectrum, which may prevent its wider development for people with\ndementia. On the one hand, when asked to state why ECH was not appropriate for actual\ncare home entrants in the third strand of the study, frontline staff suggested it did not\nprovide sufficient care, arguing that individuals' needs were too high to be met in such\nfacilities. This would appear to indicate that they saw its place in the care spectrum as\nclose to care at home. On the other hand, when asked to identify the most appropriate\ncare option for certain current care home entrants in the first strand of the study, social care\nmanagers typically argued that the individuals' needs did not warrant ECH. This might\nseem to suggest that they would perceive it as closer to care home entry. As indicated in the\nintroduction, however, studies suggest that ECH can enable older people to lead fulfilling\nlives in an environment that is widely perceived to be less restrictive than many care homes\n(Callaghan & Towers, 2014; Demos, 2014). Further, the limited evidence available from\nsimilar, homelike residential models in other countries suggests that residents' satisfaction\nwith care is high in such environments (Ausserhofer et al., 2016; Verbeek et al., 2009).\nTogether, this might encourage social care staff to view ECH as a discrete alternative to\nboth of these environments.\nAnother important finding from this study highlights a lack of consensus about the\npoint on the care pathway at which ECH is most appropriate for people with dementia,\nwith different staff placing different weights on different arguments. These include the\nbelief that people with dementia are more able to adapt to a change of residence early in\nthe care pathway; the likelihood that a change of residence will create major stress and a\npotential deterioration in functioning and the assumption that a move to ECH will not\nbe for life. The latter, in particular, appeared to be an important obstacle to the greater\nuse of ECH in this study. However, internationally, other small-scale, homelike care\nmodels have developed to support very highly dependent people, sometimes in close\nrelation with other assisted living facilities (Verbeek et al., 2009; Wimo & Morthenson\nEkel\nof, 2004), and it might be argued that given the flexible care available, residents\nshould be able to stay in ECH as their needs progress. More research is needed to\ninvestigate whether these expectations can be met over time. Further, whilst frontline\npractitioners tended to consider ECH inappropriate for older people who needed fre-\nquent care or supervision or posed potential risks, particularly in relation to falls, wheth-\ner care homes can minimise these risks to a greater extent than ECH and are better\nplaced to provide 24-hour care is a moot point. There is certainly some evidence that\ncare homes find it difficult to meet the needs of people with complex, unpredictable\nneeds, and that sufficient time and prerequisite skills among care home staff may be\nlacking (Robbins, Gordon, Dyas, Logan, & Gladman, 2013). Moreover, whereas care\nhomes in some other countries employ their own specialised medical staff, facilitating the\ncare of people with greater needs (Conroy et al., 2009), in the UK, medical responsibility\nfor both ECH and most care home residents is held by general practitioners (GPs).\nFinally, interestingly, this study found no evidence that costs were a key factor in driving\nstaff decision making, with there being minimal reference to costs in any of the three strands.\nPrevious evidence has suggested that ECH can be a cost-effective alternative to care home\nadmission (B\naumker et al., 2010) and it may be that the participating staff were aware of\nthis. Alternatively, it may be that other reasons, such as the desire to support people at home\nwere perceived as more important. Indeed, as noted above, particularly for the RAM Panel,\nthis desire appeared to override any other concern, including on occasion older people's and\nfamilies' preferences.\nLimitations and strengths\nA major strength of the current study is its use of both quantitative and qualitative methods.\nThe materials used in the care planning workshop drew on a rich dataset of current care\nhome residents' characteristics at the precise time of care home admission. It facilitated the\nconstruction of representative case types whose care needs were explored using a modified\nnominal group approach, whilst the in vivo RAM panel exercise and the analysis of real life\ncare home applications supplied rich data on the factors underlying both managers' and\nfrontline practitioners' decision making. Nevertheless, four key limitations must be ac-\nknowledged. First, the research was conducted in just one area of the UK, which may\nlimit generalisability of results. For example, the limited extent to which social care man-\nagers' regarded ECH as a valuable alternative to care home admission could be a local\neffect. Second, although there were several ECH facilities in the study site, none of these\nwere dedicated for people with dementia. Whilst the focus of the study was on the services\nneeded by people with dementia, as opposed to the services available, it is possible that the\nparticipants in the first two strands of the study (the care planning workshop and simulated\nRAM Panel) may have over- or under-estimated what such facilities can offer. Third, the\nstudy focused solely on staff views and did not directly involve older people with mental\nhealth problems or their carers themselves, albeit information on their preferences was\nincluded in the vignettes. Fourth, the issue of ownership (i.e. whether people's previous\nhousing was privately owned or rented) was not considered in the decision about different\nECH options.\nConclusion\nThis study provides new understanding of perspectives of frontline practitioner' and social\ncare managers on the appropriate use of ECH for people with dementia. Whilst social care\nmanagers' appeared overwhelmingly focused on maintaining people at home, frontline\npractitioners viewed ECH as a valuable alternative to care home placement. More empirical\nevidence is needed on whether, for whom and in what circumstances ECH provides a pref-\nerable alternative for people with dementia, including the views of users' themselves. In the\nmeantime, local care planners and commissioners could investigate whether the concerns\nand reservations about the use of ECH identified above are mirrored in their locality and\nconsider the potential utility of alternative supported housing models from other countries.\n"
