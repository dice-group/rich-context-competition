Blood pressure (BP) percentiles in childhood are assessed according to age, gender, and height. Objective. To create\na simple BP/height ratio for both systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). To study the relationship between BP/height ratios\nand corresponding BP percentiles in children. Methods. We analyzed data on height and BP from 2006-2007 NHANES data. BP\npercentiles were calculated for 3775 children. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to calculate\nsensitivity and specificity of BP/height ratios as diagnostic tests for elevated BP (>90%). Correlation analysis was performed\nbetween BP percentiles and BP/height ratios. Results. The average age was 12.54 \u00b1 2.67 years. SBP/height and DBP/height ratios\nR2 = 0.90). The cutoffs of SBP/height and DBP/height ratios in boys were 0.75 and 0.46, respectively; in girls the ratios were\n0.75 and 0.48, respectively with sensitivity and specificity in range of 83\u00ad100%. Conclusion. BP/height ratios are simple with\nhigh sensitivity and specificity to detect elevated BP in children. These ratios can be easily used in routine medical care of children.\n1. Introduction\nHypertension in children and adolescents is defined as sys-\ntolic BP (SBP) and/or diastolic BP (DBP) above the 95th\npercentile. BP between the 90th and 95th percentile is des-\nignated \"high normal\" or \"prehypertensive\" [1]. Currently\nthe available data to quantify hypertension in children is in\nthe form of a table reference matched by sex, age, and height\npercentiles [2].\nIn recent years the prevalence of hypertension in the\npediatric population in the United States has been increasing\n[3]. Children and adolescents with primary hypertension\nare frequently overweight or obese. The prevalence of\nhypertension increases progressively with increasing body\nmass index (BMI), and hypertension is detectable in over\n30% of overweight children with BMI above 95th percentile\n[4]. The increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity\nand its strong association with hypertension make both\nprehypertension and hypertension a major health problem\nin the young [5].\nHypertension in childhood and adolescence can lead\nto hypertension as adults [6, 7]. Although hypertension in\nchildhood has been thought of as an independent risk factor\nfor CVD (cardiovascular vascular disease), there are several\nstudies demonstrating the association of hypertension with\nother risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyc-\neridemia, low HDL cholesterol, truncal (central) obesity,\nhyperinsulinemia, and metabolic syndrome [8, 9].\nThe criteria for diagnosis of hypertension in children\nand adolescents can be complex and challenging to apply in\nclinical practice because of age-, gender-, and height-specific\nreference values [10]. Both hypertension and prehyperten-\nsion though prevalent and increasing in incidence remain\nthe first time, the feasibility and accuracy of the systolic\n2  \nSBP percentiles\nBoys\nSBP/height ratio\nFigure 1: The graph depicts the strong correlation of systolic blood\npressure percentiles (SBP Percentiles), on the Y Axis and the systolic\nblood pressure over height ratio (SBP/height ratio) on the X Axis in\nSBP percentiles\nGirls\nSBP/height ratio\nFigure 2: The graph depicts the strong correlation of systolic blood\npressure percentiles (SBP Percentiles), on the Y Axis and the systolic\nblood pressure over Height ratio (SBP/height ratio) on the X Axis\nblood pressure-to-height ratio (SBP/height ratio) and the\ndiastolic blood pressure-to-height ratio (DBP/height ratio)\nand proposed the optimal thresholds of SBP/height ratio and\nDBP/height ratio for identifying hypertension in Chinese\nadolescents. They concluded that the BP/height ratios are\nsimple, inexpensive, and accurate indices for identification\nof hypertension in adolescents [12]. Subsequently BP/height\nratios and cutoffs were also proposed for Italian and Nigerian\nIn order to validate the BP/height ratios in US children,\nsimilar studies needed to be repeated and studied further.\nTherefore, this formed the basis of hypothesis of our study.\nIn this study we tested that simple BP/height ratios can be\nused as an accurate clinical tool to identify children and\nadolescents at risk for hypertension. For this purpose we\nhave reported the simplified ratios of BP/height as an\naccurate detection method of elevated BP. We also report\nthe correlation of BP/height ratios with commonly used BP\npercentiles.\n2. Materials and Methods\nExamination Survey). Data on age, gender, ethnicity, height,\nweight, and waist circumference was analyzed [13]. Systolic\nblood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP),\nwere reported to be measured by a standard protocol used\nby NHANES [14]. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated\nusing the standard formula. BP percentiles were calculated\naccording to the standard formula provided in the following\nreferenced manuscript [2].\n2.2. Statistical Analysis. Receiver-operating characteristic\n(ROC) curve analyses were performed to calculate sensitivity\nand specificity of SBP/height and DBP/height ratios as\ndiagnostic tests for elevated, that is, >90th percentile of SBP\nand DBP, respectively. Correlation analysis was performed\nbetween SBP percentile and SBP/height ratio. Similar corre-\nlation was studied for DBP percentiles and DBP/height ratio.\nROC analyses and curve generation were performed using\nAnalyse-it Method Evaluation edition. For data analysis and\ninterpretation we used SPSS v.19.\n3. Results\nethnicity as defined in the NHANES Demographics Variable\nList was accessed. The various ethnicities were as follows:\nRaces. The BMI percentile in girls from all ethnic groups\nhad BMI greater than 95th percentile. The BMI percentile in\nboys from all ethnic groups was 66 \u00b1 30 (Mean \u00b1 SD). The\nproportion of boys with BMI greater than 95th percentile was\napproximately 24 percent. The proportion of overweight girls\nand boys with BP reading above 90th percentile was 11% and\n10% respectively. The proportion of BP above 90th percentile\nin all girls and boys was 6.3% and 5.2%, respectively.\nSBP/height ratio strongly correlated with SBP percentiles\nobtained for DBP/height ratio and DBP percentiles: boys'\nanalysis showed a very steep progression of sensitivity and\nspecificity above certain cutoff values. The cutoffs of elevated\nSBP/height and DBP/height ratios in boys were 0.75 and\nAbove the cutoff values of the ratios the sensitivity and\nspecificity of detection of elevated BP (greater than 90th\npercentile) was very high as shown in (Table 1). There\nwas no significant difference of BP/height ratios in various\nethnicities as demonstrated by an inter-group weighted t test\n(data not shown).\nThe accuracy of this determination of ratios above the\n95th percentile is diminished by the low number of children.\nIn this cohort there were only 50 boys (2.6%) who had SBP\npercentiles above 95th percentile and only 6 (0.3%) had\nDBP above this range. Similarly 46 girls (2.6%) had SBP\npercentiles above 95th percentile and only 7 (0.4%) had DBP\npercentiles in the hypertensive range.\n  3\nTable 1: ROC analysis of SBP and DBP in boys and girls.

Discussion\nHypertension in the pediatric and adolescent population\nmay remain undiagnosed. Although the BP charts for age,\ngender and height are readily available, they are generally\nnot used in a busy pediatric practice. The diagnosis of\nhypertension may be missed in some children [10]. In\nadolescents. Overall, 507 children fulfilled the criteria for\nhypertension, of whom 74% were undiagnosed. Prehyper-\ntension was documented in 485 individuals, but 89% had not\nbeen previously diagnosed. [11] The authors concluded that\nthe current practice of identifying the BP percentiles from\nlengthy tables can be cumbersome, ineffective, and can often\nmiss the diagnosis of hypertension in children, which can\nbecome detrimental to their long-term health [11].\nIn this study we have shown that BP/height ratios are\nsimple and accurate method of diagnosing elevated blood\npressure. Our findings are in complete agreement with the\npreceding studies on this matter [12\u00ad14]. The authors in that\nstudy clearly demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of the\nSBP/height and DBP/height ratios in their cohort of Chinese,\nItalian, and Nigerian adolescents [12\u00ad14]. In our study the\ncutoff for SBP/height ratio for both boys and girls is 0.75. The\ncutoffs for DBP/height ratio in boys and girls are 0.46 and\n0.48, respectively (Table 1). The sensitivities and specificities\nof these ratios are from 83% to 100% in identifying elevated\nBP above the 90th percentile. Our study is the first to report\nthe BP/height ratio for prehypertension, which can be used\nas a reliable tool not only for diagnosis but also screening for\nhigh BP in ambulatory care setting in children. Also, there\nwere no significant differences of BP/height ratios in various\nethnicities as demonstrated by intergroup weighted t tests.\nTherefore, we have proven for the first time that these ratios\ncan be used universally in most ethnic groups represented\nin USA In addition, we have shown that SBP/height and\nDBP/height ratios strongly correlated with their respective\nSBP and DBP percentiles in both boys and girls (Figures 1\nOur study has a large cohort of subjects derived from\nthe NHANES database. Hence the ROC analysis for the\ncalculated cutoffs generates good power and validation\n(Table 1). In this cohort the incidence of BP above 95th\npercentile was low (below 3% in both boys and girls).\nTherefore it is our belief that more studies need to be done\nwith looking at a larger cohort of hypertensive children to\nassess the reliability and reproducibility of the BP/Height\nratios. Although NHANES data focuses on US children and\nadolescents without any particular pathology, the large num-\nbers of subjects in this study make it possible to extrapolate\nthe results at a population level. Also this study is based on\ncross-sectional data and does not imply target organ damage,\nwhich would need standard diagnostic techniques such as\nechocardiogram.\n5. Conclusions\nBP/height ratio is a simple, excellent screening and diagnostic\ntool with high sensitivity and specificity to detect elevated\nBP. The BP/height ratio can be easily used in routine medical\ncare of children. The BP/height ratios also correlated with the\ncorresponding BP percentiles in both genders. More studies\nare needed in patients with proven hypertension to validate\nthe use of this proposed BP/height ratio in conditions with\nsevere elevations of blood pressure.\nAbbreviations\nCDC: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nNHANES: National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey\nROC: Receiver-operating characteristic\nCVD: Cardiovascular vascular disease.\nReferences\n[1] A.
