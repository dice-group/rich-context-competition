Adolescents\nwho attended schools with higher student smoking rates; adolescents who had easier access to cigarettes\nat home; and adolescents who had more friends smoking were all more likely to be adverse transitioners\nby young adulthood.\nConclusions: State level tobacco control policies and individual level factors during adolescence are\nindependently associated with smoking initiation and adverse transition by the onset of young adulthood,\nespecially for low SES females. While states may have very little direct influence on individual level\nbehaviours, through their policies they do have the potential to exert considerable influence on smoking\nbehaviour that persists through adolescence into young adulthood.\nCigarette smoking in the USA and other developed\ncountries has been found to be associated with social\nclass.1 2 Adult smoking is highly concentrated among\nthose of lower socioeconomic status (SES), where SES is\ndefined by educational attainment, income, and occupation.\nConsequently, those of low SES bear the heaviest health\nburden. To reduce such disparities, recent national initiatives\nlike those of the Healthy People 2010 objectives have been\nundertaken, and various tobacco control policies have been\nenacted and implemented.3 Many of the policy initiatives are\ntargeted at teenagers because most adult smokers start\nsmoking before age 18.4 Even in those younger than 18,\nsmoking initiation is known to be positively correlated with\nlow household income.4\u00ad6 What is not well understood is how\ntobacco control policies affect smoking in young female\nadolescents, particularly those of low SES. The goal of this\npaper is an exploration of how tobacco control policies\ndifferentially influence female adolescents in low, middle,\nand high SES groups in terms of their smoking initiation and\ntransition to a more detrimental or adverse (that is, heavier\ntobacco use) stage of smoking behaviour during the period\nfrom adolescence through young adulthood.\nEarly tobacco control research chiefly focused on the bio-\nbehavioural influences of smoking such as personality traits,\nfamily characteristics, and parental smoking status in an\nattempt to identify the characteristics of children and\nadolescents who were at risk of smoking. Consequent tobacco\ncontrol interventions, such as school based educational\nprogrammes, were based upon this bio-behavioural\ndemand-side model. More recently, tobacco control research\nhas shifted to a focus on the environmental factors\ninfluencing tobacco use (for example, policies to reduce\nsupply, raise tobacco taxes, and limit tobacco advertising and\npromotion). However, neither the bio-behavioural influences\nmodels nor the environmental influences models alone\nadequately explain why adolescents take up smoking or\nwhy they continue to smoke. Instead, models combining both\nof these two sources of influences--macro, distal environ-\nmental factors (for example, state and school related factors)\nand proximal factors (for example, individual, parent, family,\nand peer related factors)--offer an opportunity to examine\nhow individual smoking behaviour is influenced by an\ninteraction of multiple factors. Considering the interaction\nof these multiple factors is important because it is now\nrecognised that although tobacco control policies do influ-\nence rates of adolescent smoking initiation and transition to\nheavier smoking, not all adolescents respond to policies in\nthe same way. Indeed, a person's susceptibility or resilience\ntowards smoking is mainly determined by demographic and\nproximal factors, which may be modified by the more distal\npolicy environment, such as clean indoor air laws.7\u00ad9\nIn this paper we investigate the issue of whether state level\ntobacco control policies have an effect on smoking transitions\nfrom adolescence through young adulthood. Stated another\nway, do differences exist in the smoking behaviour of\nadolescents of low SES living in states with strong youth\ntobacco access policies compared with states with weak\npolicies? Available evidence is sometimes contradictory. Most\nadolescents believe that cigarettes are readily available,10\u00ad13\nand there is evidence to support that notion. In one study,\n83% of those adolescents who ever smoked reported that they\ndid not usually buy their own cigarettes, and adolescents\nwww.jech.com\nwhose best friends smoked were significantly more likely to\nreport getting cigarettes from other smokers.14 Likewise,\nexperimental smokers were more likely to rely on friends,\npeers, or family members for cigarettes.15 However, as they\nmove to higher use rates adolescents must purchase\ncigarettes themselves,10 11 thus smoking transition and\ncommercial cigarette accessibility are linked.\nEven though policies limiting youth access have been\nadopted at the local, state, and federal levels, debate over the\neffectiveness of youth access laws has not been silenced,\npartly because of a paucity of data on enforcement and partly\nbecause of methodological limitations of studies examining\npolicy effectiveness.16\u00ad23 Regardless of the debate, policy\nenforcement seems to be an essential element in reducing\nfederal block grants are conditional upon each state enacting\nand enforcing laws restricting the sale and distribution of\ntobacco products to minors. However, implementation of the\nlaws has been slow: since 1996 each state has been required\nto conduct annual surveys of merchant compliance, but\nstates failing to meet the requirements of the Synar\nAmendment have not been punished. This is the case even\nthough several studies examining the impact of access laws\nconcluded that enforcement and merchant compliance lead\nto reduced access to tobacco products and consequent\nstudy in Illinois showed that active enforcement over a two\nyear period resulted in not just a reduction of sales to minors,\nbut a reduction in tobacco use by adolescents.22 These studies\nshowing a positive relation between increased policy com-\npliance and reductions in adolescent smoking are encoura-\nging, but it should be understood that even if youth access\nlaw compliance by merchants were 100%, adolescent smok-\ning would not completely disappear. Adolescents will still\nprocure cigarettes from other sources, such as friends or\nfamily. Indeed, any level of merchant compliance less than\n100% guarantees that some adolescents will find a store\nwilling to sell them cigarettes.26 Therefore, the effects of\naccess laws are just one factor in adolescent smoking, albeit\nan important one.\nThe fundamental hypothesis of this study is that restricting\ncommercial availability of tobacco to minors will make it\nmore difficult for adolescents to obtain tobacco products,\nthereby delaying their smoking initiation. While the focus of\nthe study is on the effects of state level tobacco control\npolicies, we also consider multiple factors important in\ndetermining smoking transitions in the long run. Hence\ntobacco control related factors at school and individual levels\nduring adolescence are examined together, along with state\nlevel tobacco control factors. In considering the long term\ninfluence of adolescent experiences, we hypothesise that the\nimpact of tobacco control policies targeted at youths will\nextend into young adulthood, and that family and school\nexperiences will have a sustained influence on smoking over\nthe long term. In examining the effects of state tobacco\ncontrol policies described above, we incorporate into our\nmodel measures of cigarette availability at home; number of\nbest friends who smoked; and student smoking rates at\nschool, while controlling for the effects of age; race and\nethnicity; parent structure; and family bonding.\nMETHODS\nOur dataset, the national longitudinal study of adolescent\nhealth (Add Health), is a school based survey of the health\nrelated behaviours of adolescents. Add Health ensures\nnational representativeness by surveying individual adoles-\nframe stratified by region, level of urbanisation, school type,\nschool size, and by school racial compositions. In 1994\u00ad5\nsurveys were conducted to interview again 15 197 of the\nrespondents from wave 1 about their health behaviours and\nlife experience as young adults. Data from wave 1 were used\nto operationalise outcome variables on smoking, demo-\ngraphic characteristics, family characteristics, parent's level\nof education, and family income (the latter two from the\nparent's questionnaire). A set of linked identifiers--data\nfrom the in-school survey, in-home wave 1 and wave 3\nsurveys, school administrator survey, and parent surveys,\nalong with state tobacco control score data (described\nbelow)--were merged with detailed information about\nfemale respondents' behaviours related to smoking, as well\nas the characteristics of their families and friends, and their\nschool and state. For analyses, the sample was restricted to\nadolescents younger than 18 years of age at wave 1, namely\nthose who could not legally purchase cigarettes, resulting in\nFemale respondents were classified into five groups based\non a hierarchy of increasing severity of smoking related\nbehaviours.27 28 Respondents who had: (1) never puffed a\ncigarette, classified as never smokers (the reference group in\nour multivariate analyses); (2) smoked an entire cigarette at\nleast once but not every day in the past 30 days, classified as\nintermittent smokers; (3) smoked every day, classified as\nregular smokers; (4) smoked an entire cigarette at least once,\nbut not in the past 30 days, and who claimed not to ever have\nbeen regular smokers, classified as experimental smokers; (5)\nformerly been a regular smoker and who had quit, classified\nas former smokers. To create subgroups for analyses, the\nclassification of smoking stages was applied to female\nrespondents who answered wave 1 Add Health in-home\nTable 1 Definitions and sample sizes of adverse transitioners and initiators from\nclassification of smoking stages\nInitiators\nSmoker stage at wave 3 Never smoked Experimental Intermittent Regular\nSmoker stage at wave 1\nAdverse transitioners\nSmoker stage at wave 3 Never smoked Experimental Intermittent Regular\nSmoker stage at wave 1\nAdverse transitioners include initiators.\nwww.jech.com\nquestionnaire in 1995 and who participated in the follow up\nwave 3 study in 2001\u00ad2. Data from the two time points, seven\nyears apart*, permit inferences to be made about transitions\nin smoking behaviour. Different kinds of smoking transition\nmight have occurred during the seven year time period, but\nthe focus of this paper is on adverse transition (that is, a\ntransition from one smoking classification stage in wave 1 to\na more adverse stage in wave 3). An important subgroup of\nadverse transitioners is ``initiators''--those who had never\nsmoked in wave 1 but became a smoker in any stage in wave\n3. In our analyses we compare: (1) initiators and never\nsmokers; and (2) adverse transitioners and never smokers.\nTable 1 reports the definitions and sample sizes for smoking\ninitiators and adverse transitioners.\nFor analyses, female respondents were classified into three\ngroups, low SES, middle SES, and high SES based on both\nfamily income and parent education in wave 1. Missing\nvalues for family income were imputed.29 Based on the\nfederal poverty level guidelines, four levels of family income\nwere created: (1) below poverty level (,100% of poverty\nfor parent education were not imputed. Parent education\nlevel was combined with family income level to create SES\ngroups; if the income level was below poverty level, then\ncases with missing values in parent education were classified\nas low SES. The three SES groups were constructed as\nfollows: (1) low SES includes (a) cases from families below\npoverty level and all levels of parent education, and (b) cases\nfrom parent education less than high school graduate; (2)\nmiddle SES includes cases from (a) low income families/\nparent education of high school or more, (b) middle income\nfamilies/parent education of high school or some college, and\n(c) high income families/parent education less than or high\nschool graduate; (3) high SES includes cases from (a) high\nincome level/parent education of some college or more, and\n(b) middle income/parent education of college graduate.\n640 for high SES female adolescents.\nFor state level tobacco control policy variables, we adopted\na measure of comprehensive state tobacco control efforts\nbased on a score developed by the National Cancer Institute\nevaluating nine items for each state each year (see Alciati et al\nfor further information about the rating system).30 31 Three of\nthe items cover law enforcement provisions (statewide\nenforcement, random inspections, graduated penalties); six\ncover specific tobacco control provisions (photo identifica-\ntion, free distribution, minimum age, packaging, vending\nmachines, and clerk intervention). We also incorporated 1995\nstate excise tax data as a tobacco policy variable in separate\nmodels. For school level control measures (for example,\npenalties for smoking at school), we focused on the smoking\nrates of students in the schools attended by our respondents,\nselected from preliminary analyses. At the individual level,\ncigarette availability at home; extent of best friends'\nsmoking; and family bonding were used. Control variables\nwere age, race/ethnicity, and parent structure. Small sample\nsizes for Asian, Native American, and other race groups\nprecluded analyses of these detailed categories of race/\nethnicity. Instead, three racial and ethnic groups, Hispanic,\nAfrican American, and white and other racial groups (here-\nafter referred to as white group) were created.\nTo account for the nested structure of individual level data\nwithin states and schools, multilevel logistic regressions\ncomparing initiators to never smokers were used. Low,\nmiddle, and high SES female adolescents were initially\nmodelled separately to examine the possible overall effects of\nTable 2 Description of predictors used in multivariate multilevel analyses\nPredictor at wave 1 Description\nIndividual level\nRace/ethnicity White, Asian, Native American, or other race (reference group); Hispanic (yes, no); African\nAmerican (yes, no)\nAge Age in years at wave 1\nParent structure Lived with two biological parents (yes, no)\nFamily bonding Mean of four questions on a five point Likert scale regarding respondent's feelings about\nfamily bonding (for example, How much do you feel that your family pays attention to you?)\nAvailability of cigarettes at home Are cigarettes easily available to you in your home?

Later, a series of models\nincorporating individual policy items, one at a time, was\ndeveloped to evaluate the effect of each individual policy.\nSchool level characteristics and individual level character-\nistics were included in the models, along with basic\ndemographic characteristics as controls. The analyses were\nrepeated for adverse transitioners compared with never\nsmokers to assess policy effects on the three SES groups.\nRESULTS\nTable 3 reports the descriptive statistics of predictors at the\nindividual level by low, middle, and high SES females for\nnever smoked and initiation groups, as well as for never\nsmoked and adverse transition groups.\nTable 4 reports the odds ratios of smoking initiation and\nadverse transition for low, middle and high SES female\ngroups. Our hypothesis that state level tobacco control\npolicies reduce the likelihood of smoking initiation and\nadverse transition was supported. Stronger state tobacco\ncontrol policies are in general positively associated with a\nlower likelihood of initiation and adverse transition. The\npositive policy effects for initiation were strongest for low\nSES females, whose odds ratio was 0.95 (0.98 for middle SES,\n1.00 for high SES). For initiation, school level smoking rates\ndid not vary substantially across low, middle, and high SES\nconsistent with the research of others.32\nThe pattern of results for adverse transition was overall\nvery similar to that of initiation, and consistent with prior\nresearch by others. Individual level tobacco control variables,\nsuch as cigarette availability at home and best friends'\nsmoking, were significantly associated with the likelihood of\nadverse transition (typically estimates did not reach statis-\ntical significance for initiation). Availability of cigarettes at\nhome was associated with greater odds of initiation and\nadverse transition in all SES groups. If there were best friends\nwho smoked, the odds of initiation and adverse transition\nincreased (significantly so for transition, less significantly for\ninitiation). Of note, there was a consistent pattern of having\none, two, or three best friends smoking associated with\ninitiation and adverse transition, but it was not the linear\nrelation seen for other variables, such as state policy effects,\nwherein greater effects for the low SES group were seen.\nInstead we see that the more pronounced effects are on the\nTable 3 Descriptive statistics of demographic/family characteristics; and tobacco control polices and tobacco control related\nfactors at individual, school and state levels for low, middle, and high SES female groups by never smoked compared with\nadverse transition\nVariable\nLow SES females Middle SES females High SES females\nNever smoked Adverse transition Never smoked Adverse transition Never smoked Adverse transition\nMean SD Mean SD Mean SD Mean SD Mean SD Mean SD\nIndividual level characteristics\nRace/ethnicity\nFamily income level (federal poverty level)\nParent's education*\nParent structure\nLived with two biological parents\nCigarette easily available at home\nAmong three best friends...\n*Because some low SES particpants could have missing values on parent's education, information, means and SD were calculated based on cases with non-missing values. \u00c0Each of the state\ntobacco control policy can range from 0 to 4 points (extra point available in three items); the state total score can range from 0 to 39 points.\nwww.jech.com\nmiddle SES group (for example, with two best friends\nsmoking, the transition odds ratios for low, middle, and high\nHowever, for low SES females, having more best friends\nsmoking translates into a higher likelihood of adverse\nWe also evaluated the effects of eight of the individual\npolicies\u00c0 in separate models for enforcement related policies:\n(1) statewide enforcement, (2) random inspections, and (3)\ngraduated penalties, and access related policies, (4) photo\nidentification, (5) free distribution, (6) minimum age, (7)\npackaging, and (8) vending machines. With respect to\nsmoking initiation, we found that two of the three enforce-\nment related policy variables (statewide enforcement and\nrandom inspections) and one of the five access related policy\nvariables (photo identification) represent the most significant\neffects of the policies. But almost every control policy had the\nsame pattern: higher levels of controls lead to lower\nlikelihoods of initiation for lower SES females. In other\nwords, tobacco control policies have the biggest impact on\nreducing the likelihood of smoking initiation in low SES\nfemales, less of an impact on the likelihood of middle SES\nfemale group, and the least impact on high SES females.\nIndeed, for initiation there were almost no positive effects\nnoted for any control policy on those female adolescents in\nthe high SES group, a pattern that was even more\npronounced for the adverse transition analyses results. This\npoint will be discussed in a later section of the paper. To\nillustrate the positive effects of specific control policies, we\nfocus on three of them. Firstly, for statewide enforcement,\nthe odds ratios of initiation were significantly lower for the\nlow (0.89) and middle (0.91) SES female groups; on the other\nhand, the policy had no effect on the high SES female group\n(OR = 1.00). Secondly, for random inspections the odds\nratios of initiation were significantly lower for low (0.88)\nand middle (0.90) SES female groups. Finally, photo\nidentification had a significant positive effect on the low\nSES female group (OR = 0.85), but not on the middle SES\nfemale group (OR = 0.95, NS) and on high SES females\n(OR = 1.10, NS). However, other policies had a pattern\nsimilar to the significant ones (that is, tobacco control\npolicies have the biggest impact as SES decreases), one\nexample of which is free distribution, where the odds ratios\nhigh SES.\nThe results for the analyses of adverse smoking transition\n(as defined in the Method section) were virtually identical in\npattern. They can be summarised as follows: stronger tobacco\ncontrol policies are positively related to lower likelihood of\nadverse transition in smoking, especially for the low SES\nfemale group. Although most of the estimates did not reach\nTable 4 Estimated odds ratios (OR) from multilevel logistic regressions for the effects of state tobacco control policies, and\nschool and individual level tobacco control factors on smoking initiation and adverse transition in low, middle, and high SES\nfemale groups\nVariable\nInitiation compared with never smoked Adverse transition compared with never smoked\nLow SES Middle SES High SES Low SES Middle SES High SES\nOR p Value OR p Value OR p Value OR p Value OR p Value OR p Value\nState level\nSchool level\nIndividual level\nCigarettes availability at home\nAmong three best friends...\nWhen state tobacco control policy variables used as a single variable in separate models\nOther individual level demographic/family characteristics\nRace/ethnicity\nParent structure\nstates;\nEstimated odds ratios from the full model shown here include the state law total score as a state policy variable as well as other individual and school level variables.

These policies had a larger impact on low\nSES than on middle and high SES female groups. Individual\nlevel tobacco control factors, such as the availability of\ncigarettes at home and best friends' smoking, were powerful\npredictors of adverse transition as well. Given the minimal\nlevel of tobacco control policies across states at the time data\nwere collected (before the Synar Amendment was fully\nimplemented), the results clearly show an encouraging\nassociation between stronger policies and lower likelihood.\nTherefore, if states increase their effort levels, we can\nreasonably expect to see positive effects in reducing adverse\ntransition.\nDISCUSSION\nBecause stronger state tobacco control policies are especially\nassociated with lower likelihood of smoking initiation and\nadverse transition in low and middle SES female groups,\npolicies related to enforcement provisions have the potential\nto decrease adverse transition--if properly implemented.\nResults for the low SES female group are especially\nnoteworthy: stronger policies are associated with lower\nlikelihood of adverse transition for both low and middle\nSES female groups, but not necessarily for the high SES\nfemale group. Somewhat surprisingly, there were no positive\neffects for high SES females. Indeed, they sometimes had the\nopposite sign, although none of estimates were statistically\nsignificant. A possible explanation for the lack of policy effect\nmay be that high SES females have access to other sources of\ncigarettes. The small effect sizes generally seen even for low\nSES females should be viewed in light of the fact that levels\nof state tobacco control efforts reported in the data are far\nfrom target levels. Further studies that track the effectiveness\nof state level policies should be undertaken regularly as\ntobacco control efforts ramp up toward their target levels.\nIt is also important to bear in mind that the tobacco control\npolices included in this analysis measure just the existence of\na policy, not its implementation or the actual enforcement of\nlaws. Two states might have identical laws, but enforce them\nquite differently. Or laws may be implemented selectively. As\nan example, consider that previous studies show girls have an\neasier time purchasing tobacco products from stores than\nboys; in fact, clerks more frequently encourage girls to buy\ncigarettes, and request identification less frequently from\nthem than boys.33\u00ad35 Race and ethnicity of clerks also\ninfluence tobacco sales to minors--African American clerks\nare less likely to sell to minors.35 What this suggests is that\nthe proper implementation and rigourous enforcement of\nphoto identification and clerk intervention policies, both\ninvolving an active interaction between merchants and\nbuyers, could be quite effective in deterring access to tobacco\nproducts, especially for initiators. Indeed, photo identification\nwas strongly associated with lower likelihood of initiation\nand adverse transition among low SES females. The reason\nthat photo identification was not associated with middle and\nhigh SES female groups is unclear. It might be because\nmiddle and high SES female groups are more likely to obtain\ncigarettes from social sources instead of stores, or might it be\nbecause stores in middle or high SES females' neighbour-\nhoods do not check photo identification to the same extent as\nstores in low SES neighbourhoods. If laws are enforced\nselectively and if low SES is correlated with geographical\nlocality, then the differential effects we see for state policies\nmay be attributable less to the actual state policy and more to\nits enforcement. The question of clerk intervention effective-\nness is yet to be determined, as no state received a positive\nscore in 1995. It may be that clerk intervention could be an\neffective policy, but difficult to implement. Future research\nregarding this should determine the answer.\nA further consideration of study limitations is that of the\nseven year gap of the Add Health data used for the analyses\nof predicting the association of tobacco control polices\nbetween adolescence and young adulthood--a long time\nspan for adolescents experiencing numerous transformative\nevents in their life (becoming independent, moving away\nfrom home, starting college, starting jobs, and so on). Many\nfactors, some possibly important, in determining smoking\nbehaviour are therefore missing from the two waves of the\nAdd Health data. A related issue is the timing of the\ncollection of the data we used. In 1992, when enactments\nof the Synar Amendment were gradually being implemented,\nnine states reported compliance rates above 90%.21 In our\nanalyses, we were limited to available data, but data collected\nin the future may show a different pattern. We also\nintentionally focused our attention on low SES and other\nSES female groups, and so did not examine similarities or\ndifferences of gender in the data. As the data already exist, it\nwould be worthwhile analysing smoking and SES for men to\nsee if additional insights on the effectiveness of policy might\nnot be gleaned. Finally, the data were not experimental, so\ncaution is needed when interpreting the findings, especially\nfor causality.\nWhat is not in question is that factors at the individual\nlevel are all important predictors for adverse transition. Girls\nwho have easy access to cigarettes at home, and girls who\nhave more friends smoking, are all more likely to be adverse\ntransitioners. An especially strong association was noted\nbetween the number of best friends smoking during the teen\n` No significant interaction effects between race/ethnicity indicators and\nstate tobacco control policies were obtained. Therefore, only the main\neffects were reported and discussed in the paper.\nWhat this paper adds\nPast studies of the effects of tobacco control polices and\nfactors on general population have been conducted, but few\nstudies have investigated the impact of tobacco control\npolicies and factors on the subpopulation of the low\nsocioeconomic status female group. In this study, although\nthe effect sizes are small, stronger state level tobacco control\npolicies are associated with lower likelihood of smoking\ninitiation and adverse transition, especially for low SES\nfemales.\nPolicy implications\nWhile individual level factors (such as friends and family)\nhave a profound impact on smoking, state level policies, such\nas tobacco access laws, have a substantial positive impact on\nsmoking for the low SES female group. Although states may\nhave very little direct influence on individual level behaviours,\nthrough their policies they do have the potential to exert\nconsiderable influence on smoking behaviour, which persists\nthrough adolescence into young adulthood. For the low SES\nfemale group in particular, the greatest promise of deterring\nthem from smoking in later life may well lie in the policies\nimplemented during their adolescence.\nwww.jech.com\nyears for all SES women and their adverse transition to\nsmoking, possibly because having more smoking friends\nmeans more sources of tobacco. School level predictors, in\ngeneral, were not important predictors. Student smoking\nrates at school were only marginally associated with the odds\nof adverse transition in smoking, which is consistent with the\nfindings of most previous research that school interventions\nare not effective in lowering smoking rates in the long run.32\nIn conclusion, state level tobacco control policies and\nindividual level factors during adolescence are independently\nassociated with smoking initiation and adverse transition by\nthe onset of young adulthood, especially for the low female\nSES group. While states may have very little direct influence\non individual level behaviours, through their policies they do\nhave the potential to exert considerable influence on smoking\nbehaviour that persists through adolescence into young\nadulthood. For the low SES female group in particular, the\ngreatest promise of deterring them from smoking in later\nlife may well lie in policies implemented during their\nadolescence.\n"
