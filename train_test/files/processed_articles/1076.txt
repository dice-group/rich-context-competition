Co-occurrence of\nsomatic complaints is common. Among girls who expe-\nrienced headaches more than once a week, 3.2 million\n(53.3%) also reported stomach pain more than once a\nweek and 4.1 million (74.3%) reported morning fatigue\nmore than once a week.

All students in a selected class were\nasked to participate with active parental and student consent.\nSeventeen thousand students responded, resulting in a partici-\npation rate of 83%. If records were missing for key variables (eg,\nage or sex) or had more than 75% missing responses, the re-\ncords were dropped according to the study protocol require-\nments (n=835). Records were excluded if the participant's grade\nwas out of the target range, if the participant's age was outside\nof the 99th percentile for the grade (n=440 students), or if either\nthe participant's grade or age was unknown (n=39).

The 5\ncategories were compressed to 4 levels for this analysis with\nthe responses for more than once a week and about every day\nbeing combined; the resulting composite category was labeled\n\"more than once a week.\" Social and institutional support was\nassessed using 3 composite variables: parent support, teacher\nsupport, and student support, and frequency of bullying ex-\nperienced during the past school term. Health behavior mea-\nsures included the frequency of alcohol use in the past 30 days,\nparticularly binge drinking defined as 5 drinks or more con-\nsumed consecutively on more than 3 days in the past month;\nsmoking; caffeine intake (including both coffee and soda); and\nphysical activity as measured by participation in nonorga-\nnized sports. Sociodemographic characteristics included grade,\nrace/ethnicity, and mother's educational attainment.\nStatistical analyses were performed using SUDAAN and SPSS\nsoftware.27,28 Principal components analysis and correlation ma-\ntrices (including varimax rotations29 and scree plots30) were used\nto determine the selection of variables for inclusion in the com-\nposite parent, teacher, and student support variables. SUDAAN\nwas used in all statistical analyses to obtain standard errors and\n95% confidence intervals (CIs) that account for the complex\nmultistage design. Methods of analysis included univariate de-\nscriptive analyses, bivariate comparisons, and multiple logis-\ntic regression controlling for all predictors and grade level, race/\nethnicity, and mother's educational attainment. The significance\nof the bivariate relationships between the 4 somatic com-\nplaints and the predictors were tested using the 2 test. The in-\ndependent variables in the logistic regression models were ex-\namined for evidence of multicollinearity and interactions with\ngrade, race/ethnicity, and mother's educational attainment. All\nfinal analyses were weighted to be nationally representative.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents the overall prevalence of headache, stom-\nachache, backache, and morning fatigue among US girls\nin grades 6 through 10. Within this population, about one\nthird experienced headaches or morning fatigue more than\nonce a week, one fifth reported stomachache more than\nonce a week, and almost one quarter experienced back-\nache more than once a week. Almost 40% of the girls re-\nported stomachache about once a month, while more than\nonethirdreportedmorningfatigueaboutonceaweek.Only\none fifth of the respondents reported rarely or never ex-\nperiencing headaches or stomachaches and only 7% re-\nported rarely or never experiencing morning fatigue.\nRace and ethnicity was not significantly associated\nwith the prevalence of reported symptoms, with one ex-\nception. Non-Hispanic black girls were significantly more\nlikely than other girls to report stomachaches more than\nonce a week. Girls whose mothers had not graduated from\nhigh school were also at higher risk for frequent head-\nmothers had at least completed high school (Table 2).\nTherewasaconsistentandsignificantrelationshipbe-\ntween grade and symptom prevalence.

The proportion of girls reporting a backache once\na week or more decreased from more than 50% with very\nlow levels of teacher or parent support to fewer than one\nthird with high levels of perceived support (data avail-\nable on request). Girls who drank alcohol were more likely\nto experience stomachaches (adjusted odds ratio, 1.2; 95%\nCI, 1.0-1.5) than nondrinkers, while girls who reported\nhigh caffeine consumption were 1.4 times more likely to\nreport headaches, stomachaches, and backaches com-\npared with those who consumed lower levels. Teens who\nsmoked were about 1.5 times more likely to report all\nsymptoms compared with nonsmokers. A dose-\nresponse was also observed between the prevalence of\nfrequent symptoms and the increasing levels of sub-\nstance use and caffeine consumption. For example, the\nprevalence of stomachache once a week or more in-\ncreased from one third among nondrinkers to almost two\nthirds among binge drinkers. Caffeine intake demon-\nstrated a similar pattern with the proportion of frequent\nheadache sufferers increasing 30 percentage points be-\ntween low- and high-caffeine consumers (data available\non request). Bullying experienced at least once a week\nincreased the risk for all symptoms. Bullied girls were 1.4\nence backaches once a week or more compared with girls\nwho were not bullied. Prevalence estimates supported\nthese findings with three quarters of the girls who expe-\nrienced bullying at this rate also reporting morning fa-\ntigue (data available on request). No evidence of either\nmulticollinearity or interactions were found in the mul-\ntivariate models.\nCOMMENT\nThis first national study to report on multiple somatic com-\nplaints indicates that US adolescent females are at particu-\nlarly high risk for headache, stomachache, backache, and\nmorning fatigue. While other studies have documented the\nhigh prevalence of these symptoms among adolescents and\ngirlsinparticular,fewhavepursuedagender-specificanaly-\nsis of multiple co-occurring symptoms.1-7,31 Adolescent fe-\nmales who report experiencing one symptom more than\nonce a week often experience at least one other symptom\nat the same frequency rate. Among girls who experienced\nheadaches more thanonce a week, 3.2 million(53.3%)also\nreportedstomachachesmorethanonceaweekand4.1mil-\nlion (74.3%) reported morning fatigue more than once a\nweek. The high prevalence of these somatic symptoms ex-\nperiencedaloneandconcurrentlycouldhaveimportantim-\nplications for this population's daily functional status and\nclinical treatment.\nThis investigation found a generally positive asso-\nciation between grade level and symptom frequency or\nintensity. Age effects reported for the prevalence of so-\nmatic symptoms vary by complaint and symptom fre-\nquency in previous studies. Other studies found a strong\nassociation between increased age and the prevalence of\nbackache,19,32 while Egger et al4 found no age effects for\nheadaches, stomachaches, or musculoskeletal pains. In\nthis study, significant grade-level effects were observed\nprimarily for symptoms occurring at least weekly and in\nsome cases monthly, possibly capturing the onset of men-\nstruation and associated symptoms.33-36 The variance in\nage effects observed in previous studies may be attrib-\nuted to different sample sizes, age groupings, and study\ndesigns. Further research is needed to determine the ex-\ntent to which somatic complaints can be explained by\npubertal developments such as menstruation.\nFuture research on the relationship between age and\nsomatic complaints may need to consider the degree to\nwhich observed age effects are potentially a reflection of\ngirls' increasing participation in risky health behaviors and\nreduced involvement in protective activities.

A re-\ncent US study found that levels of physical activity decline\nsharply among adolescent girls, with the median activity\nscore decreasing by 83% between the ages of 9 and 10 years\nhas been linked to higher-quality relationships with par-\nents, improved academic performance, and a lower preva-\nlence of depression.39 This study did not find physical ac-\ntivity to be a protective factor for somatic symptoms except\nbackache. This may be owing to the inability to measure\ntotal physical activity in the survey. In addition to re-\nduced physical activity, as adolescents age, less leisure time\nmay be spent engaged in family-related activities. Several\nstudies have found parent-child connectedness to be pro-\ntective against a range of risk behaviors and conditions as-\nsociated with somatic symptoms including emotional dis-\ntress,suicidalthoughts,violence,andsubstanceabuse,even\nSocial and institutional support from peers and in-\nstructors may also have a significant effect on the health\nteacher support measures had a more notable association\nwith somatic symptoms than peer support. For both fac-\ntors, a protective association was observed for most symp-\ntoms even at the low and moderate levels of perceived sup-\nport (compared with very low). Previous studies have\ndocumented the protective effects of parental support in\nfamily connectedness was protective against several risk\nfactors for somatic symptoms including substance abuse,\nviolence, and emotional distress. These findings were ech-\noed in studies of 2 high-risk populations: overweight ado-\nlescents and African American girls. Among overweight\nadolescents, Mellin et al41 reported that high levels of fam-\nily connectedness were positively associated with better\nschool performance and lower levels of emotional dis-\ntress. Among African American girls, Aronowitz and Mor-\nrison-Beedy40 found that connectedness with mothers was\nassociated with fewer risky health behaviors and more\npositive future aspirations. Similar protective effects have\nbeen observed for teacher support.20 These findings sug-\ngest that increased parent and teacher support may act\nto help reduce risk behaviors shown to be related to health\nsymptoms among adolescent girls. Additional research\nis needed to identify effective methods for fostering par-\nent- and school- connectedness within familial and com-\nmunity structures that may already be overburdened.\nAlthough peer support appeared to play a less pro-\ntective role than parental or teacher support in this study,\nthe proportion of girls reporting somatic complaints once\na week or more in this study decreased by almost 10% for\nall 4 symptoms between those reporting very low levels\nand those reporting high levels of peer support. These find-\nings are consistent with those of Natvig et al20 who re-\nported that increasing support from fellow students was\nassociated with decreased risk for somatic symptoms. In\nparticular, Natvig et al observed a protective effect be-\ntween student support and depression, a symptom com-\nmonlylinkedtoarangeofsomaticsymptomsinotherstud-\nies.4,7,18 Additionalresearchisneededtodeterminewhether\nsome risk factors for somatic symptoms can be effectively\naddressed through positive peer networks, and if so, what\nmechanisms can be used to mitigate the negative effects\nof poor peer relations associated with bullying.\nIn this study, girls who experienced bullying at least\nonce a week were more likely to experience headaches,\nbackaches, and morning fatigue compared with girls who\nhad not been bullied during that term. Previous studies\nhave documented the association between bullying and\nies indicate that while being bullied is associated with\ndifficulty making friends and lower use of alcohol,21 per-\npetration of bullying is associated with more time spent\nwith friends44 and increased use of alcohol and ciga-\nrettes.21 This suggests that although adolescents who are\nbullied may be at less risk for adverse health outcomes\nassociated with substance use, they may be at increased\nrisk for somatic complaints associated with poor peer re-\nlationships.3,18 New initiatives such as the US Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services, Health Resources\nand Services Administration's Stop Bullying Now cam-\npaign45 should be evaluated for their efficacy in raising\npublic awareness and reducing the prevalence of bul-\nlying.\nBinge drinking and frequent smoking were signifi-\ncantly associated with all symptoms. Of note was the simi-\nlarity in prevalence of frequent headaches, stomach-\naches, and morning fatigue between girls reporting at least\nweekly smoking and those reporting less than weekly\nsmoking. This suggests that even sporadic smoking may\nMother's Educational Attainment\nLess\nThan\nHigh School\nHigh\nSchool\nSome\nCollege\nCollege\nDegree\n\u00a92004 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nbe associated with somatic symptoms. Smoking among\nadolescent girls has been associated with somatic symp-\ntoms,3 lower parent-family connectedness, and weight\ncontrol efforts.46 The reported relationship between weight\ncontrol and smoking is particularly salient to the health\nstatus of adolescent girls. As they age, girls report in-\ncreased dissatisfaction with their bodies,47 participation\nin dieting behaviors,48 and cigarette smoking.49 It is pos-\nsible that some of the symptoms associated with adoles-\ncent female smoking may also reflect negative health ef-\nfects associated with the psychological pressure to fit social\nbody norms and the physical effects of food restriction\nand disordered eating.\nAlcohol consumption was modestly associated with\nincreased risk for headaches, stomachaches, and morn-\ning fatigue in this study. The association between alcohol\nabuse and lifetime negative health effects has been docu-\nmented.50,51 Adolescentalcoholusehasbeenassociatedwith\nfrequent physical symptoms ranging from headaches to\nabdominal pain, risky health habits including poor diet,\nsmoking, low levels of regular physical activity, and de-\nlayed puberty.23,52 At least 1 study has suggested that de-\npression and anxiety among this population may be more\nsignificantly associated with reported symptoms than the\nphysical effects of alcohol.53 Another study has reported\na strong association between somatic symptoms and \"re-\nlief\" substance abuse among adolescent girls, a practice\ncharacterized by substance use during stressful events.54\nThese findings suggest that the physical symptoms asso-\nciated with substance use may also be reflecting the so-\nmatization of concurrent emotional distress. Further re-\nsearch is necessary to determine to what extent students\nwho report risky health behaviors may be otherwise prone\nto somatic symptoms and, in particular, how stress and\ndepression, may impact health behaviors and outcomes.\nSeveral limitations should be noted. The school-\nbased study population excludes high-risk teens not at-\ntending school. Students in special education classes were\nalso less likely to be interviewed. Students with language\ndifficulties or learning disabilities may have been less likely\nto complete the questionnaires. Students who were ab-\nsent on the day of the survey may be more likely to have\nchronic illnesses or have higher risks associated with tru-\nancy or other related factors assessed here. Assessment of\neffects of absenteeism on adolescent reports of health be-\nhaviors has shown it may be a problem.55 Students in al-\nternative schools are excluded from the sample and have\nbeen shown to have higher levels of health-related risk be-\nhaviors than high school students surveyed in the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention's Youth Risk Behavior\nSurvey.56 Thus,thelevelsofriskreportedheremaybelower\nthan those of the adolescent population as a whole.\nAssessment of the association between food intake\nand restriction practices and somatic symptoms was omit-\nted because of concerns about the reliability of self-\nreport data for these measures. Self-reported data on risk\nbehaviors among adolescents have been found to be lower\nfor dietary behaviors compared with other health behav-\niors,57 while comparisons of self-reported energy intake\nand expenditure have shown adolescents to underesti-\nmate energy intake.58 Food restriction practices were also\nomitted because data were unavailable on the intensity\nor frequency of dieting behaviors.\nThe association between stressful life events, such\nas familial illness and violence, on somatic symptoms ex-\nperienced by adolescent girls was not addressed in this\nstudy.54 Given the prevalence of sexual assault59 and part-\nner violence60 experienced by adolescent girls, subse-\nquent studies of multiple co-occurring symptoms among\nthis population would benefit from inclusion of these mea-\nsures.\nFinally, a similar study of somatic symptoms among\nadolescent boys would be valuable. Male adolescents do\nnot report suffering from somatic symptoms as fre-\nquently as female adolescents, with the exception of morn-\ning fatigue26; however, further research is needed to de-\ntermine how social and environmental factors influence\nthe frequency and prevalence of this condition and oth-\ners among boys.\nCONCLUSIONS\nSomatic complaints of headache, stomachache, back-\nache, and morning fatigue are common among US ado-\nlescent girls. These health conditions are reported fre-\nquently and often in tandem with other conditions\naffecting daily functional levels. These findings suggest\nthat effective clinical treatment may require comprehen-\nsive assessment of all female adolescents presenting with\nseemingly isolated somatic complaints to accurately iden-\ntify and treat both the presenting symptom and any re-\nlated conditions. While linkages may be drawn between\nselected complaints and other biological functions such\nas menstruation, most of these complaints seem to be as-\nsociated more strongly with social, environmental, and\nWhat This Study Adds\nHeadache, stomachache, backache, and morning fa-\ntigue are frequently reported somatic complaints among\nchildren and adolescents. Studies have shown that girls\nreport a higher prevalence of these symptoms and are at\ngreater risk for experiencing these symptoms concur-\nrently. The disproportionate rates of symptoms experi-\nenced by adolescent girls, in conjunction with the det-\nrimental effects of these symptoms on social development,\nsuggest the need for a better understanding of the na-\nture, extent, and possible causes for frequent somatic\nsymptoms among adolescent girls in the United States.\nThis first national study to report on multiple so-\nmatic complaints among US adolescent females indi-\ncates that this population is at particularly high risk for\nheadaches, stomachaches, backaches, and morning fa-\ntigue and frequently experiences symptoms in tandem\nwith other conditions.
