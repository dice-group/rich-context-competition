The availability of improved data in recent\ndecades has made it possible to identify physiological and behavioral explanations for these\ndifferences. Substantial evidence now shows that men are both physiologically more\nvulnerable to most diseases and psychologically more prone to take risks and engage in\nunhealthy behavior that turns these vulnerabilities into early mortality (Folstad and Karter,\nHowever, efforts to explain why men are physiologically more vulnerable and\npsychologically more prone to risk taking have only recently begun. To answer these\nquestions requires an evolutionary perspective on why natural selection shaped differences\nbetween men and women. This recognition in no way precludes consideration of the\nprofound influence of culture on mortality patterns. In fact, this paper illustrates how recent\ncultural changes in Eastern Europe interact with evolved facultative mechanisms to\ninfluence the Male-to-Female Mortality Ratio (M:F MR).\nSex differences are usually shaped by the processes of sexual selection, intersexual\nselection and intrasexual competition. Evolutionary biologists recognize consistent patterns\nthat influence mortality differences between males and females. In most species, males\nmake a smaller parental investment than females and females tend to be more\ndiscriminating in mate choice because of their greater costs of reproduction. As a result, the\nreproductive success of males depends largely on their ability to compete for mating\nopportunities, whether by winning fights with other males, competing for social status or\nterritory, or by presenting displays preferred by females (Darwin 1871; Trivers, 1972).\nMales who succeed in these competitions have more offspring, and this shapes traits that\nfoster such success, even if those traits also lead to physiological and behavioral differences\nthat make males more prone to injury, sickness and early death. Relative to females, the\noptimum balance of investment for males is shifted towards reproductive effort and away\nfrom somatic effort (building up the body and maintaining health), and towards mating\neffort at the expense of parental effort.\nBecause males benefit more so from numerous mating opportunities than do\nfemales, they were selected to invest more effort in mating than females, while females\nallocate proportionally more effort to improve the quality of their offspring. Male\nreproductive success also shows more variance and skew because most females will rear\nsome offspring to maturity, but many males may not mate at all, and a few males are likely\nto have many offspring, especially in species where mating patterns are polygynous. Higher\ndegrees of polygyny in a species correspond with greater male-male competition and risky\nmale behavior (Plavcan, 2000; Plavcan and van Schaik 1997; Plavcan, van Schaik, and\nKappeler 1995), larger size and armor of males, and higher male mortality rates as\ncompared to females (Leuttenegger and Kelley 1977). The role of sexual selection in\nshaping traits that increase male mortality rates is supported by the high correlation\nbetween excess male mortality and sexual size dimorphism across mammalian taxa, after\ncontrolling for the effects of phylogeny (Promislow, 1992).\nEvolution, economics, and mortality\nMales in many species have been shaped by trade-offs that increase competitive\nabilities and risk-taking that increase male reproductive success even if that decreases\ncaution and ability to repair tissues and prevent disease (Daly and Wilson 1978; M\u00f6ller,\nChriste, and Lux 1999; Trivers 1985). In short, males in many species are selected for\nsuccess in reproductive competition even at the expense of health and longevity, so females\nlive longer on average (Hazzard, 1990). Compared to women, men tend to have greater\nheight and weight, more upper-body strength, higher metabolic rates, higher juvenile\nmortality, and later sexual maturity (for a review, see Miller, 1998). Some increased risk\nresults directly from the greater vulnerability of male structural, physiological,\nendocrinological, and immunological systems, especially lower resistance to infection,\ninjury, stress and degenerative diseases (Hazzard, 1990).\nThe peak sex difference in mortality rates, which occurs during young adulthood\nand mainly from behavioral causes, can be accounted for by the shift in male allocation of\neffort from mating to parenting over the life course (Kruger and Nesse, 2006). Human male\nmating effort peaks in young adulthood, possibly in part because young men have fewer\nchildren requiring parental investment, and also because men who have not committed their\ncurrent and future resources may be more attractive partners (Hill and Kaplan, 1999).\nThe peacock signals its mate value though the brilliant plumage of its tail (Darwin,\n1871). This costly display is an honest signal of the quality of the male's genetic\ninvestment, as it demonstrates parasite and predator resistance (Zahavi, 1975). Paternal\ninvestment is much larger in humans than in other primates (Buss and Schmitt 1993; Geary\nand Flinn, 2001), possibly because of the high payoffs for large investments in the care and\ninstruction of offspring compared with our primate relatives (Fisher, 1992). This degree of\ninvestment is highly influential for determining human characteristics (see Lancaster,\nAltmannn, Rossi, and Sherrod, 1987). Thus, displays of wealth and social status may signal\nhuman male mate value. The high investment by human males in their children may\nsomewhat decrease the relative importance of direct male-male physical competition but\nwill tend to increase female choosiness and its power to select for ability and willingness to\ninvest in potential offspring (Low, 2000). Human male competition includes direct physical\nand status competition, as well as competition for resources that make them more attractive\nto females.\nIn recent human ancestral times, men who controlled more resources married\nyounger women, married more women, and produced offspring earlier (Low, 1998). In\ncurrent foraging societies, even ones that are relatively egalitarian, men with higher status\nhave more mating opportunities (Chagnon, 1992; Hill and Hurtado, 1996). Cross-culturally,\nmen are evaluated by potential partners in terms of social status and economic power\n(Buss, 1994; Kenrick and Simpson, 1997). Across a wide variety of societies, male social\nand economic status is directly related to reproductive success (Hopcroft, 2006). During\nrecent human evolution, males who do not have substantial resources or status may have\nbeen unable to establish long-term relationships. Thus, sexual selection helps to explain\nsome sex differences in psychology and behavioral tendencies, including the stronger male\ntendencies for risk-taking, competitiveness, and sensitivity to hierarchy (Cronin, 1991).\nThese attributes are related to competition for resources, social status, and mates (Daly and\nWilson, 1985), competition which is hazardous and sometimes fatal (Betzig, 1986; Kaplan\nEvolution, economics, and mortality\nand Hill, 1985). Violent male conflict is prevalent among mammalian species and is highly\ncorrelated with rates of male mortality (Daly and Wilson, 1985).\nWomen have also faced unique selection pressures which may have contributed to\nthe divergence in risky strategies. Survival of offspring depends more on maternal than\npaternal care and defense (Campbell, 1999), so risk taking may have been more costly to\nwomen. Sex differences in behavioral responses to stress may follow ancestral challenges.\nTissue-damaging \"fight or flight\" responses may be observed more so in males than in\nfemales. In contrast, women may be more likely to \"tend-and-befriend,\" helping to protect\nand reduce distress in oneself and one's children (Taylor et al., 2000). These activities,\nwhich could also be described as \"huddle and hide,\" may also help develop and sustain\nsocial networks that facilitate recovery from adverse situations.\nThese patterns lead to the expectation that men in most cultures should have higher\nmortality rates for most causes of death across the life span. They also make the more\nspecific prediction that differences will be maximal in young adulthood when mate\ncompetition is the most vigorous (Daly and Wilson, 1985). Recent research has confirmed\nthese predictions, along with the hypotheses that high M:F MRs in early adulthood should\nresult mostly from direct behavioral (or external) causes of death, such as homicide,\nsuicide, and accidents, high M:F MRs later in life should result from internal causes such as\ncardiovascular disease that reflect risky behaviors much earlier in life (Kruger and Nesse,\n2004, 2006). Thus, external and internal forms of mortality are both influenced by risky\nbehaviors, although there is a delayed impact for behaviorally influenced internal causes of\ndeath.\nAccidents are the fourth leading cause of death for men in the USA, but the seventh\nfor women (Anderson, 2001). The substantially higher rates of fatal and non-fatal accidents\nfor boys has been attributed to their systematic underestimation of risk (Kraemer, 2000),\nand epidemiologists are starting to recognize the evolutionary significance of\ndisproportionate male risk-taking in their recommendations for prevention programs (Nell,\n2003). The tendency for males to take more risks is thought to also account for much of the\nsex difference in rates of violence and the use of alcohol or illicit drugs (Kraemer, 2000).\nDifferential rates of alcohol intake explain substantial sex differences in mortality from\nchronic liver disease and cirrhosis (Zhang, Sasaki, and Kesteloot, 1995). Suicide rates for\nyoung men in several Western nations are now several times that of young women\n(McClure, 2000). Social expectations for men may amplify the tendency to take risks\nSex differences in mortality are strongly influenced by environmental changes over\ntime. Some of the more important ones are: 1) the presumed rise in infectious disease\nmortality due to increasing population size, density, and mobility since the Palaeolithic\n(Diamond, 1997); 2) decreases in mortality from infection in the past two centuries due to\nimproved sanitation, 3) recent declines in general mortality rates due to modern public\nhealth and technological medicine, including vaccination and antibiotics; 4) increased\nmortality from lifestyle factors such as high-fat diets, lack of exercise, consumption of\ntobacco, alcohol, and other drugs; and 5) the novel risks from modern technologies, such as\nautomobiles and lethal weaponry. Overall, the pattern is dominated by the huge decline in\nmortality from infection (Lopez, 1998), thus increasing the prominence of other causes,\nEvolution, economics, and mortality\nmany of which pose higher risks to men. The decline in maternal mortality has also\nExisting mechanistic explanations of sex-based mortality differences have recently\nbeen augmented by explanations of how characteristics shaped by sexual selection interact\nwith environmental factors (including culture, for humans) to result in these discrepancies\n(e.g., Wilson and Daly, 1993). Socioeconomic factors have been shown to differentially\naffect male mortality. Both education level and income have a stronger impact on mortality\nrates for men than for women. (Bopp and Minder, 2003; Martikainen, Makela, Koskinen,\nand Valkonene, 2001). Evolutionary life history theory predicts that individuals who\ndevelop in relatively more uncertain environments will develop riskier behavioral strategies\nto take advantage of possibly fleeting opportunities (Chisholm 1999; Roff, 1992; Stearns,\n1992). The steep discounting of the future by young people could be a rational response to\nuncertainty (e.g., Gardner, 1993; Wilson and Daly, 1997). A convex upward association\nbetween proximate outcomes of risk-taking (e.g., social status) and reproductive success in\nunpredictable environments (e.g., high skew) would cause the mean fitness benefit of risky\nstrategies to be more favorable than that of cautious strategies, even if the majority of those\nexhibiting risky strategies have detrimental outcomes (Wilson and Daly 1997). This would\nmaintain higher male tendencies for risk taking, even if it results in drastic consequences\nfor many men.\nWe suggest that the degree of economic variability and uncertainly over time also\nimpacts the sex difference in mortality rates. The area under the M:F MR curve, especially\nthe area in early life that results largely from external causes, may prove to be a useful\nindicator that reflects some systematic characteristics of cultures, such as the severity of\nmale-male competition, levels of political instability, or degree of inequality in social status\nand control of resources. Central and Eastern European nations undergoing the transition in\nthe 1990s from centrally planned economies and one-party political systems to democratic\nmarket economies provide an excellent opportunity to examine this hypothesis, and high\nquality national level mortality data is readily available for many of these countries.\nAlthough many in the West may have seen the fall of the \"Iron Curtain\" as an\noverwhelmingly positive event accompanied by increases in freedom and opportunity, it\nwas traumatic economically and socially for the populations undergoing transition. The\ncollapse of the Soviet Union led to increased inflation, unemployment, and lower wages\n(Little, 1998), and the life expectancy for men dropped by six years between 1991 and\n1994 (Cockerham, 1997). Physical hardships, social disruption, and social distress\nassociated with the 44% decline in Russia's GDP is believed to have caused 3.4 million\npre-mature deaths (Rosefielde, 2001). The increase in mortality rates was more pronounced\nfor men than for women (Little, 1998). East Germany (the German Democratic Republic,\nGDR) had the advantage of support from West Germany (the Federal Republic of\nGermany, FRG), resulting in a dramatic increase in wages and a higher standard of living\nthan all other Central and Eastern European transforming countries (Seliger, 2001c).\nHowever, despite the input of nearly three trillion Deutschmarks by 2001 as well as\ntechnical and managerial assistance, unemployment rates were twice as high in the former\nEvolution, economics, and mortality\nOpen competition with more technologically advanced and efficient western firms,\nas well as the purchase and elimination of eastern firms by western firms, resulted in a\ndramatic decline in the GDR's industrial output (Seliger, 2001b). Prior to the transition,\ninefficient firms with deficits were subsidized and bankruptcy was unknown (Seliger,\n2001a). Wages and prices were fixed for long periods of time and did not reflect scarcities.\nCentralized economic plans were distorted by incorrect information and production outside\nthe plan (Seliger, 2001a, 2001b). Firms attempted to increase per worker productivity by\nreducing the workforce, resulting in shortages. Seliger estimates that approximately half of\nDuring the socialist period, social status and material wealth variation and skew\nwere relatively small for most of the population, and employment, although not freely\nchosen, was guaranteed. The relatively lower payoffs for aggressive competition should\nreduce the tendency for risky male behavioral strategies and decrease the rates of male\nmortality from behavioral causes. During and after the rapid transition to a market\neconomy, the variance and skew in social status and resources increased tremendously.\nGini coefficient is a measure of inequality of a distribution (Gini, 1921), it is\nfrequently used to measure the degree of income inequality in a population. Russia had a\nthe income of the richest 10% of the population to the poorest 10% of the population went\ninequality has coincided with large bonuses, systematic tax evasion, and substantial\nincomes from undeclared transactions amongst high-income earners (United Nations\nDevelopment Program, 1998). The uncertainty about the future and greater degree of\ncompetition was likely to lead to riskier male behavioral strategies and higher male\nmortality. This is not to say that the transition was not stressful to women as well, only that\nthe magnitude of the male to female mortality gap would widen according to predictions\nfrom our evolutionary framework.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe Male:Female Morality Ratio (M:F MR) is the ratio of the male mortality rate to\nthe female mortality rate in a specific population. We computed M:F MRs between 1985\nand 1999 for Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia,\nLithuania, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovenia, and the Ukraine with data from\nthe World Health Organization (http://www3.who.int/whosis/menu.cfm) and former\nGerman Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany) with data from the Human Mortality\nDatabase (www.mortality.org).

All other years of data were used to compute the M:F MRs by country for the\nperiods. We excluded data from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Croatia, and Moldova due to war\nand Georgia due to civil war in the period of interest.\nWe graphed the M:F MR for the total population of the 14 countries across the\nyears of economic transition with age in years on the x axis. We graphed the M:F MR\nacross age groups for the combined populations of Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech\nRepublic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, and\n(1995-1999) periods. We repeated this process for behavioral (including accidents,\nhomicides, and suicides) and internal causes (all other causes, e.g., cardiovascular disease,\nmalignant neoplasms (cancer), cerebrovascular disease, pneumonia and influenza, diabetes\nmellitus, congenital abnormalities, liver disease and cirrhosis, hypertension, and other\nforms of mortality not acutely caused by behavior). We calculated the ratio of East German\nMortality Database.\nResults\nAll 14 countries showed an increase in the M:F MR in the first five years of the\neconomic transition (See Figure 1), however the size of the increase varied considerably\nacross the nations. The M:F MR for Slovenia and the Czech Republic increased 1 and 2%,\nrespectively; Poland, Bulgaria, and Hungary increased 5-6%; Lithuania, Russian\nFederation, and Ukraine increased 8-10%; Belarus, East Germany, and Romania increased\nsmaller in the transition to post-transition period: The M:F MR for Latvia declined 5%;\nBulgaria declined 2%; Russian Federation, Albania, and Poland increased 1%; Czech\nRepublic, Hungary, and Ukraine increased 2%; Belarus and Slovenia increased 3%;\nRomania and Lithuania increased 4%; and Estonia increased 5%.

In\ncomparison, the overall M:F MR for 12 combined countries in Western Europe increased\n2.4% in the first five years of the Eastern European economic transition and declined 4.6%\nin the following five years.

After unification, the M:F MR in the GDR rose considerably\nrelative to that of the FRG. The difference in M:F MRs increased again in the period\nseveral years after unification.\nEvolution, economics, and mortality\nTable 1. Ratio of East German M:F MR to West German M:F MR across the economic\ntransition\n_________________________________________________________________________\nAlthough absolute mortality rates and Male:Female ratios differ substantially in\ndifferent countries, the form of the M:F MR curve for the combined population of 14\ncountries in economic transition (see Figure 2) are consistent with those of other nations\n(Kruger and Nesse, 2004). There is a dramatic increase in the M:F MR during young and\nThe M:F MR between ages 0 and 14 showed increase of less than 2%. The M:F MR for the\ndemonstrated the largest increase at 15%. The magnitude of the M:F MR increase declined\nrespectively. The M:F MR for the 75+ year age group actually declined by 1%.\nFigure 2. M:F MR Across the Lifespan During the Economic Transition for 14 Nations\n_______________________________________________________________________\nAge Group\nEvolution, economics, and mortality\nThe mortality ratio increased most evidently for those between 25 and 64 years of\nage. There was little change in age groups younger or older than this range. The M:F MR\nfor behavioral causes across the lifespan is similar to that of all causes of mortality (see\nFigure 3). The major differences are that the M:F MR for the 25 to 34 year age group\ndeclined in the post-transition period more so for behavioral causes than for total mortality,\nand the behavioral cause M:F MR in the 55 to 74 year age range showed a larger\ndivergence between the transition and post-transition periods, compared to total mortality.\nThe M:F MR for internal causes shows an inverted U-shaped pattern, peaking for the 35 to\n44 year age group (see Figure 4). The increase in the M:F MR for internal causes during the\neconomic transition occurred primarily between 25 and 64 years of age. The shape of the\ncurve in the post-transition period is quite similar, with slightly higher M:F MRs in some\nage groups.\nFigure 3.

Internal Cause M:F MR Across the Lifespan During the Economic Transition for\n_________________________________________________________________________\nAge Group\nMortality from external causes includes both accidents and intentional injuries. For\ncountries other than Slovenia, overall morality rates from intentional causes (homicides and\nother violence) increased across the economic transition. These increases ranged from 15%\nin Poland to 238% in Estonia; with an overall average increase of 109% across 12 countries\n(data were not available for Romania and East Germany). Overall morality rates from\nintentional causes declined by 59% in Slovenia. The M:F MR from intentional causes\n(homicides and other violence) increased for all Eastern European nations, with increases\nranging from 12% in Poland to 123% in Albania across the economic transition, with an\naverage increase of 39% across the 12 countries. The increases in mortality rates for\n= .002, were statistically significant.\nDiscussion\nThe changes in the M:F MR during the Eastern European transition from a centrally\nplanned socialist economy to a capitalist free market economy are consistent with\npredictions derived from an evolutionary understanding of how traits shaped by sexual\nselection interact with aspects of the current environment to influence sex differences in\nmortality. When the centrally planned economy was disrupted, the emerging market\neconomy (including the novel competition with firms in Western nations) triggered higher\ndegrees of uncertainty, instability, and inequality resulting in a shift toward riskier male\nEvolution, economics, and mortality\nstrategies. This is a likely explanation for the observed increase in male mortality, relative\nto female mortality. The comparison with Western Europe, which does not exhibit the same\nincrease, and between East Germany (GDR) and West Germany (FRG) further support our\npredictions. The dramatic increase in the M:F MR for intentional causes (e.g., homicide\nand other violence) further buttresses the argument for a shift towards riskier behavioral\nstrategies.\nThe variation in the magnitude of M:F MR increase probably relates to the\ncircumstances unique to each nation. The more central Eastern European nations have\nmade more substantial progress in implementing political and economical reforms and have\nhigher per-capita incomes than the states of the former Soviet Union (Fateyev, 2000; Sokol,\n2001), which may account for the smaller M:F MR increase in the former compared to the\nlatter. The economic transition in the Czech Republic was not marked by the high\nunemployment seen in other Eastern European nations; in fact, Czech unemployment was\nlower than the rate for major European economies and the United States (see Gitter and\nScheuer, 1998). This could help explain the small M:F MR increase in the Czech Republic,\ncompared to the other nations in transition. Slovenia may be an atypical case, as it is a\nformer Yugoslav country which experienced a remarkably painless transition and already\nhad many elements of a market economy.\nIt has been suggested that out-migration of the most educated and resourceful (and\npresumably the healthiest) individuals to western countries (see Anderson, 2002) was\nresponsible for increased mortality. However, out-migration continued in the post-\ntransition period and M:F MR levels did not exhibit the same magnitude of increase, some\ndeclined and only 3 increased more than 3%. Thus, out-migration may be responsible for\nsome, but not all, of the mortality increase. Changing gender roles and growth of smoking\nand alcohol consumption rates among young women in post-transition societies are\nimportant factors that will influence mortality differences, although the impact on mortality\nwill be delayed by at least two decades (see Lopez, 1998; Macfarlane, Macfarlane, and\nThe mortality ratio increased most evidently in early and mid-adulthood. There was\nlittle change in the ages outside of economic productivity, either during childhood or after\nretirement. The increase in the mortality ratio was also lower for the 15 to 24 year age\ngroup than for other age groups in the workforce. This suggests that the economic\ntransition had a greater impact on those who had already established careers than emerging\nworkers. These individuals may not have seen the transition as providing new opportunities\nas much as younger individuals did. If we look at sex differences in mortality from\nbehavioral causes, in addition to the increase in the mortality discrepancy, we see what\nlooks like a cohort effect. Younger individuals appear to have less change in risky\nbehaviors than older individuals, as the sex difference in mortality in the years after the\ntransition was lower than that before the transition for those up to the age of 34, whereas\nthe opposite is true for older age groups. The sex difference in mortality from internal\ncauses of death shows a similar increase across the ages of economic productivity, similar\nto that for behavioral causes of death. Note that all of these age groups show an effect of\nphysiological susceptibility to stress, although this does not occur for the 15 to 24 year age\ngroup until after the initial transition period.\nEvolution, economics, and mortality\nThe behavioral shift towards riskier strategies may correspond with evolved\nfacultative adaptations (i.e. responsive to the environment of a particular individual's\nago, climate change was quite rapid and dramatic ecological changes may have occurred\nwithin one generation (Ditlevsen, Svensmark, and Johnsen, 1996). This necessitated often\nrisky migrations into unknown areas in search of food, shelter, or better climate (see\nmembers of a group, other changes in social and/or ecological conditions may have more\nspecifically affected patterns of male social status and/or resource holdings.\nThe results of this study have several implications for understanding male\npsychology. Excess male mortality is a cross-cultural phenomenon and thus requires an\nexplanation that includes more than just cultural influences. We believe that male\npsychology has been shaped in part by the challenges faced by our distant ancestors. These\ninclude the challenges of gathering resources, securing social status, and successfully\nattracting and retaining mates. The mortality discrepancy is greatest in late adolescence and\nyoung adulthood, the ages men enter the mating market. Mortality in early adulthood is\npredominantly due to behavioral causes; accidents, homicides, and suicides (Kruger and\nNesse, 2004). This framework contrasts with traditional developmental models which see\ntendencies for risk-taking behaviors as a sign of psychological immaturity. Adolescents are\nexpected to outgrow their psychosocial vulnerability to risky behaviors that may impair\ntheir health despite their underlying good biological health. Although the greatest change in\nthe M:F MR is seen in early adulthood, the impact continues through retirement age. In\nmiddle to late adulthood, internal causes account for the majority of deaths and the\ndifference between male and female mortality rates (Kruger and Nesse, 2004). This study\ndemonstrates socio-economic changes affecting social status and economic potential\ninfluence both male tendencies for risky behavior and physiological susceptibility. It is\nnotable that little or no increase in the M:F MR occurs prior to sexual maturity or after\nretirement.\nWe are not implying that men consciously think that they are adjusting their\nbehavior because they see a threat to their reproductive success. From an evolutionary\nperspective, it is not necessary for the psychological mechanism to be this explicit. An\ninherent tendency towards an adaptive behavior will spread regardless of the subjective\nmental experience (or non-experience) of the individual, as long as the action reliably\noccurs. We also do not believe that the \"fittest\" male specimens are engaging\ndisproportionately in the risky activities. These tendencies developed because they\npromoted reproductive success in our ancestral environment. They are not necessarily\nrelated to reproductive success in the current environment, which is quite different from the\nenvironments experienced by our ancestors. For example, our desires for sweet and fatty\nfoods, which were previously scarce, are contributing to our modern obesity epidemic.\nThe results of this study suggest that the M:F MR may become a valuable\nquantitative psycho-social indicator that reflects the degree of male-male competition and\nskew of outcomes related to ancestral reproductive success in a culture. Our approach\nhighlights interactions between adaptations developed during human evolutionary history\nand current social and environmental factors. This integrative approach transcends the\nEvolution, economics, and mortality\nunproductive debates over the respective roles of biology and culture in shaping human\npsychology.\n"
