    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe participatory model of management for natural resources, particularly water, rapidly became a global phenomenon in\nthe early part of the 21st century. In many developing and transition countries, such as South Africa, expectations from it\nwere disproportionately ambitious, despite little evidence that better results in the form of sustainable outcomes would\nfollow. There is an urgent need for evaluations that assess what can and cannot be expected from participation. Empirically\nbased processes and outcome-orientated evaluations are likely to prove more balanced, although they are challenging and\nthus rarely attempted. This article proposes an evaluative framework that allows for comparison, and differentiates between\nprocesses and participatory governance and sustainable outcomes. Four South African vignettes of participatory initiatives,\noperating at different scales with varying degrees of stakeholder heterogeneity, are measured against the framework, and\nbroader lessons learnt about both participation and attempts to evaluate it.\n",

A new, conceptually attractive participatory\nmodel replaced it, promising better decisions and more sus-\ntainable outcomes. The participatory paradigm appeals to all\npolitical persuasions: left-wing radicals looking for grass-\nroots empowerment, and right-wing neoliberals for ways of\ncircumventing perceived ineffectual central governments\n(Mohan & Stokke, 2000). Ultimately, participation \"means\nThere are examples of successful participation in the lit-\nHowever, they tend to operate at the local scale, with clearly\ndefined and manageable goals--often with a focus on envi-\nronmental protection or managing an irrigation scheme, and\nwhere the stakeholders are relatively homogeneous in terms\nof power relations and levels of education. They are also\noften in areas with resource abundance, for example, plenty\nof water (Cook et al., 2013). Thus, any lessons learnt may not\nbe transferable to other contexts.\nDespite this, participation was embraced with precipitate\nhaste, scaled up and embedded into many developing coun-\ntries' national policies with massive transformatory and\nenvironmental protection expectations (Holmes & Scoones,\n2000). One of the most ambitious applications was in newly\ndemocratic South Africa, with its challenging history,\nextreme heterogeneity, and relative water scarcity (Muller,\n2009). There is scant evidence, however, that the participa-\ntory paradigm will deliver the ambitious goals of many het-\nerogeneous developing countries in reasonable time frames,\nand they may not be transferable to contexts of scarcity.\nThe participatory model was embraced very much as an\nact of faith and \"in opposition to previously dominant mod-\nels of development\" (Hickey & Mohan, 2004, p. 4). There is\ntherefore a strong case to be made for evaluating participa-\ntory approaches, and what has been achieved vis-\u00e0-vis top-\ndown non-participatory models, especially in view of the\nexpenditure and expectation vested in it. The World Bank\nonly acknowledged in 2005 a severe lack of research that\nevaluated its participatory programs (25% of its total portfo-\nConley and Moote (2003) suggest that evaluations of the\nright sort are urgently needed, but those that have been under-\ntaken are largely unsatisfactory for a number of reasons: There\nare those produced by enthusiasts of participation (Beierle &\nics of the approach (Coglianese, 1999; Cooke & Kothari,\n1University of Portsmouth, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nJulia Brown, Department of Geography, University of Portsmouth,\nBuckingham Building, Lion Terrace, Portsmouth PO1 3HE, UK.\nEmail: julia.brown@port.ac.uk\nEvaluating Participatory Initiatives\nin South Africa: Not Just Processes\nBut Outcomes Too\nJulia Brown1\n Keywords\nparticipation, evaluations, processes, outcomes, South Africa, water\n2 SAGE Open\n2001) to justify their position. The frameworks that these aca-\ndemics have used for their evaluations, and their measures of\nsuccess, are radically different. There is not a uniformly agreed\nframework for undertaking evaluations, and moreover, evalu-\nations may not be objective (Robson, 2002).\nWhat is needed is a balanced and rigorous type of evalua-\ntion, useful across different scales and contexts and empiri-\ncally grounded. To date, there is a dearth of evaluations that\nassess what can and cannot be expected from participatory\napproaches (Conley & Moote, 2003; Hickey & Mohan,\nThis article first proceeds with a review of the relevant\nliterature on evaluations and then offers a framework devised\nfor evaluating participatory initiatives. A series of four\nvignettes from the Inkomati region of north east South Africa\nare set out and assessed against the evaluative framework.\nLessons learnt about the nature of participation and attempts\nto evaluate it conclude the article.\nA Framework for Evaluating\nParticipatory Processes and Outcomes\nThe purpose of an evaluation is to show whether a new initia-\ntive is working toward the stated goals of the program\n(Robson, 2002). Clarity over the objective is crucial: Without\nit, measuring success is compromised. Baseline data must be\ncollected to gauge whether a program is having an impact;\nthis is often something that has been neglected with the roll-\ning out of participatory efforts (World Bank, 2005).\nOf huge significance is the context in which a particular\ninitiative is being undertaken: the scale, availability of the\nresource, economic status, and heterogeneity of stakeholders\n(Bellamy, McDonald, Syme, & Butterworth, 1999). Context\nis inextricably linked to the goals of many initiatives, for in\nthe literature it is clear that in developed countries, the\nemphasis of participatory efforts in natural resource manage-\nment tends to be conflict resolution and environmental pro-\ntection (Cook et al., 2013), whereas in developing countries,\nsocial, economic, and environmental sustainability are\nsought, a far more ambitious undertaking (Muller, 2009).\nThere are also important differences in the level of citizen\ncontrol being advocated in developed and developing coun-\ntries: In the former, it tends to be collaborative management,\nin the latter, participation is often coupled with devolution\n(the highest level of Arnstein, 1969 ladder). It is rarely, in\nevaluating participatory programs in developed and develop-\ning contexts, that like can be compared with like.\nIt is the business of evaluators to look at both the pro-\ncesses in setting up a participatory program and the outcomes\nthat are the result. Processes need to be considered fair, open,\ninclusive, and accountable to engender support for the deci-\nsions and potential products and outcomes that stem from\nthem (Parkins & Mitchell, 2005). It is also crucial that they\nare linked to real decision making and substantive changes\non the ground, that is, sustainable development outcomes.\nOtherwise, interest in participatory processes may be lost,\nand they may be seen as a mere \"talking shop\" (Tewdwr-\nbeen that evaluators tend to focus on either processes or out-\ncomes, with a particular bias to the former (Conley & Moote,\n2003). To understand this, it is necessary to look at the moti-\nvations for undertaking an evaluation and the perspective of\nevaluators. Deliberative democrats, heavily influenced by\nthe Habermasian (1984) ideal speech, view participation and\ndeliberative processes as an end in itself (Healey, 2003;\nInnes, 1996). This is largely at variance with the natural\nresource management literature (Bellamy, Walker,\nbeen a trend for participatory evaluations, that is, asking par-\nticipants what they thought of the process, often favored by\nthose who value processes and deliberation (Carr &\nexplanation is that focusing on processes is easier than out-\ncomes: The indicators (discussed shortly) are relatively\nstraightforward to assess, often more practical and certainly\nless tortuous. However, it is unsatisfactory to give undue\nweight to processes only--because it ignores whether\nimprovements in livelihoods or the environment are being\ndelivered. Focusing on outcomes only could mean that pro-\ning the intervening processes may determine the variables\nthat have affected the outcome and their causal links. There\nis therefore a strong case for an evaluative methodology that\nlooks at both processes and outcomes of participatory initia-\ntives: a \"daunting task that is rarely undertaken\" (Conley &\nBefore moving on to the proposed process and outcomes\nevaluative framework, which in the second half of the article\nis applied to four participatory initiatives in South Africa, it is\nhelpful to differentiate between processes, products of pro-\ncesses (interchangeable with outputs), and overall outcomes\nbecause these distinctions are not always clear in the literature.\nFigure 1 illustrates the stages based on South Africa's plans to\nestablish participatory Catchment Management Agencies\n(CMA) charged with the planning and management of water\nresources. Some clarification is required in the process and\nproduct category where the interpretation of success or failure\nmay be challenged. An output may be \"tangible,\" such as a\nnew representative institution (a CMA) or an agreement, or it\nmay be \"intangible,\" such as enhanced social and intellectual\ncapital and increased trust that may be difficult to measure\ngible category conventionally is regarded as a success, but as\nInnes and Booher (1999), deliberative democrats, put it,\n\"Conventional ideas . . . may lead one to see failure where\nthere is success and vice versa\" (p. 415). An agreement may\nlack durability, so is ultimately a failure; on the other hand, in\nthe context of South Africa's history, processes that work on\ncapacity building may prove to be important to the long-term\nsuccess and durability of participatory efforts. In sum, a lack\nof tangible products should not necessarily be viewed as fail-\nure. Another area of blurring of framework categories, again\nstemming from different academic backgrounds and perspec-\ntives, is where intangible process outputs and social sustain-\nability outcomes become indistinguishable. Innes and Booher\nand Mog (2004) would categorize the former as social sustain-\nability outcomes, whereas this author would argue that social\nsustainability is a reduction in inequalities. Thus, even decid-\ning on what is a process and what is an outcome is not straight-\nforward. It is argued that outcomes should be sub-divided into\nmid-term outcome--participatory governance--and the ulti-\nmate outcome--which is the result of this governance--sus-\ntainable management of the resource.\nIt is generally agreed that evaluative criteria--indicators\nagainst which to measure progress in an initiative--are of\ncrucial importance (Conley & Moote, 2003; Fraser, Dougill,\nvast and confusing body of literature that warns that too\nmany indicators can become unwieldy (Bell & Morse, 2003;\nKenny, 1999). All indicator lists are normative, but not all\nindicators themselves are subjective: for example, the num-\nber of members in an organization. Furthermore, what is\ndeemed a success or failure is a value judgment and therefore\nsubjective: thus, \"developing truly objective means of evalu-\nating collaborative efforts is impossible\" (Conley & Moote,\ntheir position and potential bias.\nProcess Evaluation\nThree broad categories of process indicators are identified in\nTable 1. The first category of indicators is \"acceptance\ncriteria,\" and is linked to the legitimacy and trust in the process\negory, \"process criteria,\" is related to more practical consider-\nations. The final category of indicator is products: Did the\nprocess result in desired \"tangible\" and \"intangible\" products?\nThese process indicators are fully explored and they are\napplied to the case studies presented in the fourth part of the\narticle.\nParticipatory Governance Outcome Evaluation\nThis is a category that the literature tends to overlook but it\nis important and discrete, and proposed indicators are pre-\nsented in Table 2.\nSustainable Development Outcome Evaluation\nWhat is the evidence that participatory and devolutionary\nprocesses have resulted in sustainable outcomes? There are\nno universally agreed on set of sustainability indicators, and\nalthough indicators have been developed (Fraser et al., 2006;\nMog, 2004), they are for a specific purpose and context, fre-\nquently weighted toward environmental sustainability and\nare not applicable for the present study. This takes us back to\nthe original three pillars of sustainability: economic, envi-\nronmental, and social (Baker, 2006). Within each aspect, a\nchoice of indicators is needed. Economic indicators could\ninclude a growing economy and gross domestic product\n(GDP) that is relatively straightforward to assess. Potential\nenvironmental sustainability indicators would include the\nmaintenance and enhancement of ecological integrity, which\nwould require adequate technical capacity to determine and\nProcesses Products\nTangible\nMid-term goal Ultimate Goal\nAcceptance Criteria - New representative\ninstitutions e.g CMA Participatory Governance Sustainable management of\nSouth Africa's water\nIntangible resources\ne.g\nPractical Considerations - Increased trust\n- Enhanced social and\nintellectual capital\nProcess and Outcome-orientated evaluation\nOutcomes\nProcess-orientated evaluation\nFigure 1.

For exam-\nple, its 1998 National Water Act aims to radically transform\nthe management of water through the establishment of par-\nticipatory CMAs and at the sub-catchment scale through the\ntransformation of White-dominated irrigation boards into\nmore inclusive Water User Associations (WUA; Republic of\nSouth Africa, 1998). Participation of stakeholders is also\nnow a legal requirement for all industrial proposals that\nrequire Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) following\nthe 1997 Environment Conservation Act (Republic of South\nThere now follow four vignettes of participatory initia-\ntives drawn from the Inkomati Water Management Area: The\nfirst is the establishment of South Africa's first CMA, the\nsecond looks at attempts to establish WUAs in the Inkomati,\nthe third explores the creation of the deliberative Crocodile\nForum, and the final vignette investigates public participa-\ntion in the EIA for Sappi Kraft paper mill's proposed expan-\nsion plans. The case studies exist at different scales: some are\nlegal requirements, others are voluntary initiatives; they\nencompass different levels of heterogeneity of stakeholders,\nand they were each established for different purposes.\nThe water-stressed Inkomati (deficit of 12% of total\nrequirement) constitutes three catchments, from north to\nsouth: Sabie/Sand, Crocodile, and the Komati, and includes\nportions of three different former Black homelands (see\npopulation of 1.4 million in 1995, the dominant users are still\nWhite-controlled commercial agriculture (57% total require-\nment), followed by commercial forestry and industry\n(Department of Water Affairs [DWA], 2004).\nMethod\nMuch of the data for the case studies come from primary\ninterview material generated from three visits to SouthAfrica\none interviews were conducted with the main stakeholder\ngroups both in the Inkomati and Pretoria, not all of whom\nwere participants in the participatory processes. Interviewees\nwere asked questions about their awareness of participatory\ninitiatives, their involvement in these initiatives (if at all),\nand reflections on the processes. Meetings of the Crocodile\nForum and CMA Advisory Committee were observed.\nGovernment reports and other studies were also consulted.\nAt this stage, it is important to declare that this\nresearcher has a tendency to weight outcomes over pro-\ncesses: Are participatory efforts resulting in real changes\non the ground, most notably in terms of redress for the\nrural Black population?\nVignette 1: Inkomati CMA\nA zealous Mpumalanga regional DWA official initiated par-\nticipatory efforts in July 1997 to develop CMA proposals in\nwhat is now the Inkomati Water Management Area prior to\nthe finalization of the 1998 Act and before the Water\nManagement Areas were determined--in 1999, by govern-\nment-appointed consultants. There was difficulty in identify-\ning and engaging Black interests, not traditionally organized\naround water, but eventually Black representatives joined\nalready established steering committees. Meetings were held\nin English. There was a lack of continuity in attendance, and\npoor relaying of information to their communities was an\nobstacle throughout. A single Inkomati Reference Group\nemerged from the committees, whose final proposal for a\nCMA Governing Board, submitted in October 2000, was\nalong geographical rather than sectoral lines, the result of\nexhaustive participatory endeavors. Lack of transparent\nwater use figures by the agricultural sector hindered proceed-\nings and clouded the implications of the proposal. In effect,\nthe Governing Board could have been dominated by existing\nusers, and DWA Pretoria officials recognized this. The pro-\nposal was put aside for 18 months pending efforts to garner\nstakeholder feedback. A period of inactivity followed during\nwhich the forums disintegrated and the regional champion\nrelocated. This was also a period of growing tensions between\nDWA Pretoria and DWA Mpumalanga who did not maintain\nthe forums, despite pressure from DWA Pretoria.\nFresh impetus came from impending elections in 2004\nbefore which the Minister wanted one CMA in place, and\nthis resulted in a rushed public relations (PR) exercise. In\nline with the Act, he appointed a committee to advice on the\nstructure of the CMA Governing Board. Observation of an\nAdvisory Committee meeting (March 2004) in a high-end\nhotel in Nelspruit emphasized knowledge asymmetries\nbetween Black and White attendees, and it was apparent that\nthe DWA-hired facilitator was actually leading the commit-\ntee to pre-determined recommendations. The original 2000\nproposal was discarded and sectoral representation adopted,\nwith a heavy slant toward Black interests. There were issues\nof participant continuity--some Black representatives were\nreplaced in the afternoon session, and the late arrival of two\nhighly vocal and educated White female NGO representa-\ntives caused some disruption (although they were supportive\nof the facilitator's position). The Black nominal Chairman of\nthe Advisory Committee conceded in March 2005 that he felt\n\"uncomfortable\" and \"lost\" during the process. At a later\nmeeting, a 14-seat Governing Board was recommended, in\neffect sidelining commercial farmers, the single largest water\nuser, and only granting forestry its own seat after lobbying\nthe Minister. Unsurprisingly, commercial farmers were\nunhappy at the outcome and in protest were withholding pay-\nment on the Water Resource Management Charge on which\nthe functioning on the CMA was to rest.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe formal launch of the CMA was in March 2004, to\ncoincide with Water Week, but difficulty finding nominees\nfor Historically Disadvantaged Groups held up proceedings\nuntil September 2005. Nominations were put up for each seat\nand the DWAMinister made the final choice of members. The\ndifferential education, skills, and experience of the Governing\nBoard members was highlighted by Brown (2011).\nThe Governing Board of the CMA is only \"nominally\nmost advanced in South Africa. It is now focusing its efforts\non a Catchment Management Strategy (Quinn, 2012). There\nwas high turnover of Governing Board members, and the\nCEO position remained vacant for some time. The decision\nto designate the Inkomati as an area for Compulsory\nLicensing effectively removes the power to reallocate water\naway from the CMA to the center, thus stifling the potential\nto achieve redress through a devolved and participatory\ninstitution.\nFollowing a review by DWA (2012) to reduce the number\nof Water Management Areas, and thus potential CMAs, from\n19 to 9, DWA plans to enlarge the Inkomati to incorporate\nthe adjacent the Mlhatuze-Usuthu Water Management Area.\nThis may compromise the future manageability of the CMA\nin the interests of supposed efficiency.\nVignette 2: The Transformation of Irrigation\nBoards Into WUA\nThe irrigation boards in the Inkomati, developed by the\nWhite commercial farming sector in former White-only\nFigure 2. Map of Inkomati water management area, South Africa.\nSouth Africa, are an example of sustainable participatory\ninstitutions managing water at the sub-catchment scale,\nalthough they were not racially representative. Members are\nhomogeneous with a shared vision of managing the river,\ndam, or canal to their benefit. They also enjoyed a high level\nof autonomy, particularly in the lower Komati subcatchment,\ndesignated a Government Water Control Area, making mem-\nbership of irrigation boards mandatory for all irrigators. The\nmembership composition of the Komati and Lomati irriga-\ntion boards was by the mid-1990s unique because the\nGovernment Water Control Area was expanded to include\nBlack small-scale farmers in the former homeland areas.\nThese were the recipients of a sugarcane development pro-\ngram and were incorporated into the existing irrigation\nboards. Discussions with Komati irrigation board Black rep-\nresentatives in February 2004, whose travel expenses were\npaid for, suggested that they do not participate in discussions\nand were merely passive listeners. The attendance of Black\nrepresentatives was thus not necessarily out of interest and\ncould only be guaranteed if their expenses were paid.\nThe 1998 Act stipulated that all irrigation boards were to\ntransform into more inclusive and representative WUAs\nwithin 6 months. The transformation proposals of all 27 irri-\ngation boards were rejected by DWA on the grounds that\nthey were not satisfied that the processes had been inclusive\nand participatory. Even the racially representative Komati\nand Lomati irrigation boards had their proposals rejected\nbecause they failed to incorporate non-farming interests.\nLocal municipal representatives felt the proposal they were\npresented with a fait accompli, and they felt that they were\ngiven minimal time to consider it.\nBy 2005, only two WUAs had been established--one\nwas the transformation of the Elands Valley irrigation\nboard, and this was only on the fourth attempt in March\n2005, after the Elands Valley irrigation board chairman\n(retired farmer) had invested considerable time and effort\nin consultation and ensured the proposal met the increas-\ningly strict representation criteria for race and gender\nset by DWA. The other WUA (Upper Komati, north of\nSawziland) was established in October 2004, in an area\nthat never had irrigation boards. This was therefore a new\ninstitution. As with the Elands Valley irrigation board, its\nformation was the result of personal efforts by a retired\nand reform-orientated former White councilor. Again, he\nreported the frustration of meeting DWA representation\ncriteria: \"The goals kept shifting.\" After 1,400 hours, and\n20,000 km of travel out of his own finances, he was able\nto demonstrate to DWA a representative WUA committee.\nEstablishing a WUA was no guarantee that it would func-\ntion, and regional DWA officials reported in March 2005\nthat the fledgling Upper Komati WUA was already\n\"struggling.\"\nUnhappy with their treatment and what they saw as unre-\nalistic expectations of DWA for the composition of WUAs,\nmany irrigation boards had drawn back from transforming,\nresulting in a standoff with DWA.\nVignette 3: Crocodile Catchment Forum\nThe Crocodile Forum constitutes an attempt to establish a\nmulti-sectoral deliberative forum to promote collaborative\nmanagement of the lower Crocodile catchment. This is the\nsort of endeavor encouraged by DWAPretoria and it is in line\nwith those who believed that forums developed to address\nlocally important issues are likely to be more durable than\nthose formed for a specific task whose raison d'\u00eatre disap-\npears when the project is completed.\nLow levels of water entering the Kruger National Park\n(KNP) were adversely affecting wildlife in this ecologically\nimportant area, and relations between the KNP and commer-\ncial farmers, the main water user, had soured on ecological\ngrounds over the halting of a proposed barrage across the\nriver by the KNP. A new KNP Water Manager was appointed\nin September 2003, a Ghanaian PhD with participatory expe-\nrience in another South African catchment. He took steps to\nreconcile opposing sides concerning the barrage and suc-\nceeded in easing long-standing tensions. Building on this\nprogress, he took the initiative to establish a forum uniting\nlocal stakeholders: Transvaal Suiker Beperk (TSB) sugar\nmiller and White commercial sugar farmers, tourist represen-\ntatives, municipal officials, elected Black councilors, and\ntribal authorities (representing the rural Black population)\nwere to discuss water management issues. These efforts were\nsupported but not led by DWAregional officials (interviewed\nFebruary 2005) who thought it a \"good thing\" that the initia-\ntive came from an affected party (KNP), giving it more legit-\nimacy and credibility: \"it is a people's forum.\"\nThe KNP Water Manager's time and personal effort gal-\nvanized support, and the inaugural meeting in a high-end\nlodge on the February 3, 2004, saw good attendance but was\nunrepresentative racially, to the extent that a Representivity\nTask Group was set up to investigate the racial skews. A\nFebruary 2005 meeting was attended by this researcher, at a\nfour star resort, with 35 to 40 attendees, but no Black repre-\nsentatives were present due to local animosities between\nelected councilors and tribal authorities. It seemed that the\nfarming and sugar sectors were present to keep abreast of\nwater reforms, elicit information about the CMA process,\nand voice concerns in general.\nThe local private water company (Greater Nelspruit\nUtility Company [GNUC]) supported the initiative for a\nyear, but by 2005 indicated it was a waste of time because \"it\nhas no teeth,\" that is, it has no regulatory powers. It was clear\nthat without the leadership of the KNP Water Manager, the\nforum would struggle. His efforts have been recognized as he\nwas, in March 2013, appointed the Inkomati CMA CEO.\nVignette 4: Sappi Kraft Paper Mill, Ngodwana--\nProposed Expansion and the Environmental\nResponse\nTwo participatory initiatives can be identified in this case\nstudy: first, the Sappi Forest Liaison Forum that was\n8 SAGE Open\nestablished in 2000 and second, participation in the EIA,\nrequired by law (Republic of South Africa, 1997), concern-\ning Sappi Kraft's proposed expansion to its Ngodwana mill.\nThe Sappi group--Sappi Forest is the supplier of raw materi-\nals for the mill's operations--is a multi-national company\nand an important source of local employment.\nThe concerns of stakeholders now have to be factored into\ndecision making, and the perceptions of local groups have\nassumed a much more important role. Under the 1997 Act, a\nfull EIA can be avoided if the delegated authority--in this\ncase, the provincial government's Environment Department,\nto whom decision-making power has been entrusted--is sat-\nisfied that \"sufficient information\" was presented during the\nScoping Phase of the EIA. This is what Sappi Kraft hoped\nTo this end, Sappi set up the Forestry Liaison Forum to try\nto dispel misconceptions about its environmental record and\nabout the stream reduction impact of eucalyptus. Behind all\nthis was the desire to pave the way for the impending EIA.\nThis \"public relations exercise,\" as it was perceived by com-\nmitted local environmentalists (interviewed March 2005),\nwas instrumental in bringing together aggrieved, highly\nvocal \"nature-loving\" individuals and local conservancy\ngroups and national NGOs--Geasphere, Environmental\nAction Link, and Wildlife and Environment Society of South\nAfrica. An alliance was thus formed with professional envi-\nronmental scientists who provided strong technical under-\nstanding and discredited Sappi's environmental record.\nNobel and Spoor of Nelspruit and the Legal Resources\nCentre, Pretoria, provided legal expertise.\nThe areas of discontent broadened from specific issues\nsuch as irrigating adjacent fields with chlorinated effluent\nfrom the mills' activities and river and air contamination, to\na more fundamental conflict over land use being played out\nover the extensive and growing use of alien plantation spe-\ncies (Golder and Associates, 2003). The well-organized,\ntechnically aware, and legally astute environmental lobby\nused the EIA process to convince the delegated authority\n(regional Environment Department) to demand a full EIA,\nwhich had considerable time and cost implications for Sappi\nvictory for voluntary environmental groups over powerful\nindustrial interests.\nCentral Government concern over the implications for the\neconomy, however, led to new EIA regulations (announced\nin April 2005 by the National Department of Environmental\nAffairs and Tourism) and criticism of current public partici-\npation processes as lacking \"proper guidance and often\nabused.\" Compulsory time frames aimed to speed up the pro-\ncesses, reduce costs, and \"facilitate out Accelerated and\nShared Growth Initiative,\" indicating that economic growth\nmay take precedence over environmental concerns. This\nproved to be the case. The final decision in favor of the\nApplication of the Evaluative\nFramework\nThis section now looks to evaluate the identified initiatives\nagainst indicators set out previously, as summarized in\nProcess-Orientated Evaluation\nAcceptance criteria.\nIndicators under acceptance criteria\n(refer to Table 1) have to do with procedural trust (Webler,\n1995) and are by their nature subjective.\nEarly involvement. The consensus is participants should be\ninvolved early on and in the creation of options--otherwise,\nthey may be viewed as rubber stamping exercises and a form\nof manipulation in Arnstein's (1969) ladder (Middendorf\n& Busch, 1997). This criterion is actually quite subjective:\nFor example, participation can start too early, that is, before\nclarification over the scope of the initiative (Chakraborty &\nFigure 3. Summary of evaluative framework and South African vignettes.\nIn the CMAcase study, involvement was begun before the\n1998 Act was passed or the boundaries of the Water\nManagement Areas clarified: Participants initially assumed,\nmistakenly, that there would be three separate CMAs, one for\neach of the catchments. Overall, the CMA proposal process\nfailed to engage representatives of all groups together at an\nearly stage--which affects feelings of ownership and legiti-\nmacy. Black representation was an issue from the outset and\nit was found to be necessary to convene special homeland\nmeetings in local languages before Black representatives\ncould join already formed steering committees 6 months late.\nAlready disadvantaged, they would feel handicapped vis-\u00e0-\nvis longer standing members. Late involvement does not\nautomatically disadvantage: At the CMA Advisory\nCommittee meeting, the White NGO latecomers were actu-\nally able to shape the direction of proceedings along with the\nfacilitator.\nAll 27 Inkomati irrigation boards had their WUA propos-\nals rejected on the grounds of inclusiveness. This meant wid-\nening their coverage that necessitated bringing in people at a\nlater stage. Municipal representatives, for example, felt they\nwere presented with a fait accompli so they were reluctant to\nengage.\nIn the case of the Crocodile Forum, extensive personal\nengagement with a range of stakeholders, including tribal\nauthorities and Black councilors, still did not result in atten-\ndance and thus involvement of any kind. Invitations do not\nguarantee attendance: Local animosities, travel expenses,\nand intimidating venues are all factors that determine whether\nor not an invited person will in fact attend. With the Sappi\nForest Forum, early engagement happened without recourse\nto special measures, as did the later EIA process.\nRepresentative and inclusive. There are differences between\ndeliberative democrats who emphasize \"inclusiveness,\" that\nis, everyone involved, and the natural resource management\nliterature that stresses \"representation\" of users (Blaikie,\n2006). Because everyone is a user of water, and given the\nscale of the Inkomati, representation was a practical solution\nto the CMA proposal process. However, in view of South\nAfrica's recent history, if significant groups are excluded,\nthen the legitimacy of such a process is threatened.\nIn the CMA proposal process, as noted, Black representa-\ntion was a problem and the DWA local champion encoun-\ntered great difficulty in identifying and engaging groups\noutside recognizable organizations (easily contactable).\nEarly involvement of all sectors was a challenge. An inter-\npretation of DWA's sidelining of the 2000 CMA proposal\nwas that there could have been an Inkomati Governing Board\nthat reinforced the dominance of existing users and was\nunrepresentative of the wider population.\nThe CMA Advisory Committee was inclusive and repre-\nsentative, both in terms of race and gender, but was engi-\nneered by DWA Pretoria. Black representation in the CMA\nprocess overall may have been greater than appeared because\nWhite NGOs and reform-orientated DWA officials upheld\ntheir interests. Without such intervention and representation,\nthe interest of a large and poor rural population could be ren-\ndered silent. However, in the long term, it may perpetuate\nBlack dependency.\nThe irrigation boards, failing representivity criteria of\nDWAfor WUAs, had their proposals rejected and were asked\nto enlarge their area of remit to incorporate non-agricultural\nusers. Consulted irrigation board representatives (six) felt the\nshared vision of their current members (for example, to man-\nage a canal) that made them sustainable would become lost\nas a result, hence, the reluctance of many irrigation boards to\nengage with the process following their initial rejection by\nDWA. It took the Elands Valley irrigation board 7 years to\nfinally achieve the level of representation that satisfied\nDWA. It is noteworthy that in the Komati and Lomati irriga-\ntion boards, the White commercial farmers represented\nthemselves individually (about 80 on the Komati irrigation\nboard) whereas the Black farmers sent irrigation scheme rep-\nresentatives and thus appeared a small presence at meetings,\nalthough in fact they outnumbered the commercial farmers 5\nto 1. It has been suggested that Black representatives tended\nto be the elderly rather than the most dynamic, a reflection of\na largely patriarchal system.\nOn the Crocodile Forum, despite the exertions of the KNP\nWater Manager, attendance was not racially representative\nbut it would most likely increase with successful land claims\nin the area, as irrigated agriculture was at that time not prac-\nticed by the Black population in the lower Crocodile.\nThe Forestry Forum was open to the public, but the Sappi\nEnvironmental Manager thought the meetings were domi-\nnated by a \"vocal minority\" not representative of the wider\nInkomati population. Similarly, the EIA Scoping Report\nexercise was disproportionately influenced by environmen-\ntalists. Evolving decision making to the local level and\nencouraging local representation may, as in this instance,\ngive greater \"voice\" to minority positions.\nContinuity in attendance. Ideally, the same representatives\nshould attend meetings to maximize the process, sustain\ndialogue (Leventhal, Karuzu, & Fry, 1980), and avoid time-\nwasting recaps. Lack of continuity by Black representatives\nwas an issue in the CMA proposal process, and observations\nof the CMA Advisory Committee illustrated how disruptive\nand patchy attendance proved to be with different attendees\nin the morning and afternoon. This erratic attendance affects\nthe quality of later feedback and accountability.\nWith the Crocodile Forum, there was less onus to attend\nwhen the purpose was not decision making but learning and\nimproved relations. Interest was beginning to wane among\nsome attendees, which also may affect later continuity. The\nWhite commercial farmers, in a potentially tenuous position\nin new South Africa, felt the need to keep abreast of develop-\nments that may affect them, and thus regularly attended.\nParticipation involves people's time, and loss of earnings and\ntravel expenses may affect willingness to attend. Paid offi-\ncials are in a different position altogether, and for the rela-\ntively wealthy farmers, meetings may represent a social\nevent.\nAble to voice opinions in a safe environment. Although legit-\nimacy for a process may be increased by the assurance of a\nrespectful hearing (Smith & McDonough, 2001; Webler &\nTuler, 2000), ground rules to prevent offensive statements or\nbehavior can have a negative/tyrannical aspect (Kelly, 2004).\nThe construction of a safe environment can hinder open and\nhonest discussion, and multi-racial encounters may have a\nfalseness about them, with a suppression of private views by\nboth Black and White speakers, thus inadvertently frustrat-\ning a process of real change. The Komati irrigation board\nchairman (February 2004) made it clear that anyone could\ncontribute to meetings, but those \"seeking to derail processes\nwould be excluded.\"\nPeople can be made uncomfortable by the choice of\nvenue: High-end tourist lodges and hotels were used by the\nCMA Advisory Committee and Crocodile Forum meetings.\nParticipants can be deterred from voicing opinions in larger\nmeetings, the lingua franca (English) is often no one's first\nlanguage, and the very technical topics under discussion can\noverawe attendees. In the early stages of the CMA process,\nthe DWA champion held meetings in local languages in the\nformer homeland areas to encourage willingness to talk.\nBlack attendees felt less comfortable on joining the larger\n\"invited\" CMA spaces. In the Sappi EIA Scoping Report,\nwritten submissions were encouraged, and this practice\nfavors the highly educated. Clearly, voice is relational to\nplace and context.\nInfluence on decision making.It is recognized that legiti-\nmacy is lessened for participatory processes not linked more\ndirectly to policy making, and participants can be made to\nfeel they were used to give an appearance of participation\nif they do not contribute to decision making: \"tokenism\" in\ndemocrat, recognizes that there has to be a link to decisions--\nwithout which they risk being labeled \"talking shops.\"\nThe White commercial farming sector took an active part\nin the CMA process and had some say in the 2000 proposal,\nalthough they felt \"bulldozed\" by the CMA champion, and\nwere not totally happy with it. However, they had no impact in\nthe direction the Advisory Committee followed nor in how it\nwas set up. This was engineered and manipulated with a DWA\nappointed facilitator in control. It is suggested that DWAinter-\nvened to make the process more legitimate in the eyes of mar-\nginal groups, fearing that the commercial farmers had\naltogether too much influence at the local level. In view of the\noutcome of the CMA, many from the commercial farming\nsector felt that the whole process was delegitimized once they\nrealized they, the largest water user, had only one seat, which\nmay have colored their reflections on earlier processes.\nRegarding the transformation of irrigation boards, DWA\nbecame increasingly prescriptive in adjusting representation\nrequirements. The efforts and expense of the irrigation\nboards resulted in little influence on decisions--an exclusion\nacutely felt by those members who were expected to fund the\nWUAs' and CMAs' operations. The forestry sector felt simi-\nlarly aggrieved as it struggled for a CMA seat despite paying\nwater use charges and attending CMA proposal meetings.\nThe Crocodile Forum was never about decision making\nbut was more about improved management through better\nunderstanding, but \"having no teeth\" resulted in loss of inter-\nest by the water service provider and Mbombela municipal-\nity. Similarly, the Forestry Liaison Forum saw interest\ndecline once the major issues had been covered. With the\nSappi EIA, legislation guaranteed response to concerns, and\ninfluence on decision making at a local level was a strong\nmotivator to environmental groups.\nTransparency.Procedural trust is more likely if a pro-\ncess is transparent and independent of bias (Conley &\nMoote, 2003). The CMA process was initially transpar-\nent but became increasingly DWA Pretoria-led rather than\nuser-led. The Advisory Committee was meant to be trans-\nparent, neutral, and independent, but this was not the case.\nThe facilitator led discussions in a particular direction, DWA\nPretoria officials undoubtedly influenced proceedings, and\nDWA regional officials later complained they were silenced.\nThe process increasingly became a \"closed\" space without\nobservers, and the final selection of the governing board\nmembers was made without wider stakeholder consultation.\nOverall, the CMA process lost legitimacy because of the way\nit was conducted in the later stages when it was the Minister\nwho decided which nominee would be given a seat on the\nCMA Governing Board.\nThe Crocodile Forum initiative was supported by DWA\nRegional officials who believed it had greater neutrality if it\nwas not DWA-led. However, because there was a likely bias\ntoward KNP interests, there was some resentment from the\nDepartment of Agriculture and Mpumalanga Parks Board\nofficials. There were no complaints from environmental\ngroups about the transparency of Golder Associates EIA\nScoping Report (consultants hired by Sappi Kraft).\nAccountable.The CMA Advisory Committee was not\naccountable to Inkomati stakeholders, many of whom were\nunknowns. Their recommendations were presented as a fait\naccompli without consultation, and the committee disbanded\nafter its recommendations and so could not be held account-\nable. Representation is unavoidable in large-scale initiatives\nsuch as the CMA, and success depends on two-way feed-\nback: from the representative to community, and from the\ncommunity back to the forums via their representative. Con-\ntinuity of attendance is thus desirable. Feedback appears to\nbe more of an issue with Black communities largely because\nof the scale of the Inkomati and access to the internet. Radio\nappears to have potential from the experiences of the Upper\nKomati WUA. It is unreasonable to expect representatives to\ntake responsibility without adequate compensation for dis-\nseminating information and collecting feedback from a large\nand dispersed rural population.\nProcess criteria. An important practical consideration for par-\nticipatory processes is access to a range of resources that\nfacilitate progress, and these are less subjective than \"accep-\ntance\" criteria.\nAccessible data and information. Not only is access to infor-\nmation needed for discussion, it also needs to be meaning-\nfully presented (Rowe & Frewer, 2000). There are issues in\nthe case study area. Socio-economic data are collected at the\nprovincial level, not co-terminous with the Inkomati Water\nManagement Area, and are often out of date. In the Inkomati\narea, transparent and reliable water use data have always\nbeen a concern to Department Water Affairs. The irrigation\nboards are effective custodians of these data, and opacity\nhas worked to their advantage and exacerbated knowledge\nasymmetries in the WUA transformation processes. This also\nhindered the CMA proposal process. The need to democra-\ntize data has led DWA to make available via its website the\nmost up to date figures on water availability and use that it\nhas accrued. However, the digital divide means that not all\nstakeholders are able to access this information, and even\nthen they may not understand the often technical language it\nis presented in.\nReferring to the CMA Advisory Committee, some Black\nmembers lacked awareness of even the most basic geogra-\nphy, and this had to be supplied in a rapid summary by the\nfacilitator. This lack of knowledge slowed down the process\nfor several months as it was realized that additional sessions\nwould be required.\nThe Sappi Kraft case study indicated that when two \"data-\nwise\" groups are on opposing sides of a conflict, data and\nscience can be used to prove contradictory arguments, for\ninstance, the water consumption of eucalyptus.\nHuman resources.As the CMA was an institutionalized\nprocess, ongoing capacity constraints within DWA (both in\ncaliber, number, and motivation) and staff turnover (often\nthe most experienced White officials move into the private\nconsultancy sector) interrupt the support function in the par-\nticipatory processes. Following the reallocation of the CMA\nregional champion, support from the regional DWA office\nwas not forthcoming, to the exasperation of DWA Pretoria.\nThere was also concern that staff shortages at the Mpuma-\nlanga Environmental Department would slow down the\nSappi EIA process.\nConsultants were increasingly being used to undertake\nwork for DWA, for example, the 1999 delineation of the\nWater Management Areas, to facilitate the Advisory\nCommittee, to assist the CMA Governing Board in the\ndrafting of a catchment management strategy, and in highly\ntechnical undertakings such as satellite verification of water\nuse. Many of these processes were not participatory, which\nraises the issue of accountability and transparency.\nMaterial resources. Visual aids are valuable for furthering\nunderstanding and were provided by the hotel venues used\nby the Crocodile Forum and the CMA Advisory Commit-\ntee. This category needs to be broadened to include financial\nassistance with travel costs to attend meetings. The Komati\nirrigation board did provide travel expenses for Black attend-\nees, as did the CMA proposal processes. There are mixed\nfeelings over this: There is a wariness of encouraging \"career\nrepresentatives\" who come merely to collect money, and the\nKNP Water Manager felt that pre-payment would not guar-\nantee attendance and input to the Crocodile Forum.\nAdequate time.Where previously disadvantaged people\nare involved, adequate time is needed to make informed and\nconsidered recommendations, and avoid the label of a fait\naccompli. The irrigation boards illustrate this: The 6-month\ntime frame of the 1998 Act to transform was unrealistic,\nespecially as ever wider inclusion was required. Nkomazi\nmunicipal representatives, included later in the Komati irri-\ngation board proposal process, understandably complained\nthey were not given enough time to consider the WUA pro-\nposal. The CMA proposal was the result of numerous meet-\nAdvisory Committee was hastily convened and became a\nscramble to meet a political deadline: a CMA to be in place\nWithout consultation, decisions can be swift--for example,\nthe 19 Water ManagementAreas were delineated in a month in\n1999. Deliberative processes can by their nature be protracted,\nbut the government recognized there was potential for abuse\nthat may harm the economy, as in the Sappi EIA delays. This\nis behind the drive to speed up the EIA processes.\nClear task and definition. There needs to be awareness of\nthe purpose and plan of an initiative; otherwise, expectations\nmay be unduly raised, time invested is wasted, and ultimately,\nthere is a loss of interest. Once the Water Management Area\nwas delineated, the CMA proposal process had clarity. The\nSappi EIA and the CMA Advisory Committee had a distinct\npurpose. However, once the raison d'\u00eatre disappears, for\nexample, when the CMA Reference Group had submitted its\nproposal, the pattern is that members disengage. The scope\nof the irrigation board transformation process was less clear,\nand irrigation board representatives complained of lack of\nclarity from DWA Pretoria.\nProducts of participation. \"Tangible\" or \"intangible\" products\nshould not be viewed as an end goal of participation, but as\nimportant components for Participatory Governance--itself\na mid-term outcome of participatory processes.\nTangible products. The 2000 Inkomati CMAproposal is an\nexample of a \"tangible\" product, the result of a participatory\nprocess. The CMA that was nominally launched in March\nconstitute a new representative organization, but it was the\nwork of the DWA-engineered representative Advisory Com-\nmittee: It did not build on the original participatory CMA\nproposal process. The Sappi EIA process resulted in the pro-\nduction of a Scoping Report that is in the public domain. All\n27 irrigation boards produced a WUAproposal--a product--\nand all were rejected. It took the Elands Valley irrigation\nboard 7 years and four attempts to get a proposal accepted.\nIntangible products. It is important to stress that for some\nparticipatory initiatives, their objectives lie in the realm of\nintangible products. Improved relations and learning were\nthe goals of the Crocodile and Forestry Liaison Forums.\nThrough the Crocodile Forum, the KNP Water Manager\nsucceeded in changing the perceptions of commercial farm-\ners about the KNP, hitherto seen as obstructive. Attendees\nwere already well informed, but co-operation and under-\nstanding resulted. The forum was not successful in engaging\nBlack representatives. The Forestry Liaison Forum did not\nachieve improved relations with environmentalists; rather, it\nstrengthened opposition resulting in a coordinated assault on\nthe Sappi Kraft expansion plan.\nIn the context of South Africa, any bringing together of\npreviously segregated groups is to be applauded. The CMA\nproposal process did bring Black representation to the steer-\ning committees after separate homeland preparatory meet-\nings had taken place. At these meetings, breakaway smaller\ngroup discussions were more successful in building social\ntrust than larger meetings.\nRegarding irrigation boards, only the Elands Valley irri-\ngation board chairman made a determined effort to engage\nwith outside groups, not the irrigation board as a whole.\nAlthough the Upper Komati WUA proposal was accepted, its\nformation did not physically unite Black and White farmers.\nRather, the champion met with the different groups in their\nown areas. The Black communities did speak but in their\nown language, and on their own ground. The White farmers,\nwho were not previously organized into irrigation boards,\ncame together, and that can be seen as progress. Other irriga-\ntion boards have made no progress with improving relations\nand have even antagonized municipalities, as was the case\nwith the Lomati and Komati irrigation boards in the lower\nKomati.\nThe Black representatives who attended the Komati and\nLomati meetings have learnt something of the CMA process\nand some management issues, especially as the Komati irri-\ngation board chairman ensured meetings were held in English\nand Siswati, and extra time was made available for educa-\ntional purposes. However, relations between the racial\ngroups in times of water stress became strained and partici-\npation has not created trust.\nProcesses, techniques, and their products/outputs are\nimportant. However, for many evaluators, this is where the\nevaluative effort draws to an end, and many of the intangible\nproducts touched on above are presented as evidence of sus-\ntainable outcomes. However, they are not, and the objective\nof this evaluation is to look whether, through participatory\ngovernance, substantive sustainable outcomes in terms of\nconditions on the ground are being delivered in the Inkomati.\nParticipatory Governance Outcome Evaluation\nThere are organs of participatory governance in place in the\nInkomati--the CMA and two WUAs--although whether\nthey are the product of participatory processes is a moot\npoint. The indicators from Table 2 are now applied to the\nvignettes.\nRepresentatives are active in discussions and make substantive\nand meaningful contributions. Deliberation lies at the heart of\nthe participatory paradigm, and ability to contribute is linked\nto capacity and social capital. Representation at meetings or\norganizations can be engineered, but mere presence does not\nguarantee substantive and meaningful contributions, that is,\nactive participation (Wilson & Perret, 2010).\nThe CMA Governing Board was heavily weighted toward\nBlack and environmental interests, which affects voting, but\nit cannot guarantee that there will be substantive inputs into\nhow water in the Inkomati should be managed. The differ-\nence in education and experience of water management\nbetween the commercial farming representative and other\nmembers on the Inkomati Governing Board is evident from\nCVs of members, summarized in Brown (2011).\nDiscussions in March 2007 with a U.K. Environment\nAgency manager, who was leading a capacity-building proj-\nect with the Inkomati CMA Board, suggested that the Board\nwas still in its infancy, and that capacity had to be built first.\nIt can be inferred from this that the Board was still some way\noff planning and managing the water resources together.\nReports indicate that by 2011, it was only nominally opera-\ntional and was focusing on developing its management strat-\negy with the aid of consultants.\nTurning to the two established WUAs, the DWA\nMpumalanga Deputy Director for Water Resource\nManagement, suggested (March 2005) that the establishment\nof WUAs was the easy part, and it is now that the \"work\nstarts.\" This seems to mirror the CMA--that once estab-\nlished they take considerable time to become fully opera-\ntional. Experience from the Upper Komati WUA proposal\nprocess indicated that Black attendees at proposal meetings\nwere active, but these were held in former homeland areas\nand in Siswati. How active will Black representatives be in\nmeetings held in English at venues likely to be outside their\nlocale? Observations of the multi-racial CMA Advisory\nCommittee indicated that contributions from the Black rep-\nresentatives, even the chairman, were minimal and even then\nonly at the direct prompting of the facilitator, and they\nappeared to just accede to the facilitator. There were substan-\ntive contributions from resourced stakeholders in both the\nSappi Kraft case study and the Crocodile Catchment Forum;\nhowever, the goal of the latter was improved relations, and\nthe initiatives were not racially representative.\nDiscussion and negotiation leads to consensus over planning and\nmanaging of resources.To plan and manage the resource,\nthere is a need through negotiation (which may oscillate\nbetween conflict and consensus) to reach a level of agree-\nment over possible options, and in a water-stressed area,\nsuch as the Inkomati, this will inevitably involve some con-\ncessions. The CMA is still in its infancy, so it is not possible\nto know today what kind of negotiations are taking place.\nHowever, it could be a matter for concern that it is based on\nsectoral representation, which can \"entrench difference and\nhinder cooperation\" (Tewdwr-Jones & Allmendinger, 1998),\nso making concessions may be seen as failing one's\nconstituents.\nHabermasian's (1984) ideas that consensus will ultimately\nresult from negotiations may not bear out in reality: It depends\non the range of stakeholders involved. For example, the\nKomati irrigation board meetings are more a case of Black\nrepresentatives ceding to commercial farmers because of\ntechnical complexity. Similarly, with the CMA Advisory\nCommittee. Forsyth (2003) suggests \"it seems reasonable to\nexpect that different social groupings have different environ-\nmental perceptions and framings\" (p. 83). Stakeholders may\nhold diametrically opposing views on man\u00adnature relations\nand how the environment should be managed: from an instru-\nmental view on nature, often associated with industrialists, to\nan eco-centric environmentalist perspective. Thus, with two\nequally resourced sets of stakeholders, with radically differ-\nent views of nature, consensus may never result from discus-\nsions because they share little common ground. The Sappi\nKraft case study exemplifies this. It is not an example of par-\nticipatory governance but is an out-and-out conflict between\nindustrialists trying to contain the EIA process and the coun-\nter-containing efforts of the environmentalists (Few, 2001).\nThe new representative organizations have the power to imple-\nment changes,and changes are made. What is of interest is the\nkinds of powers these new representative institutions have at\ntheir disposal to effect outcomes. Without powers, participa-\ntory spaces are in danger of being seen as \"talking shops\"\nand lack legitimacy (Tewdwr-Jones & Allmendinger, 1998).\nThe reallocation of water-use licenses is one of the most\nimportant powers and functions of a CMA. The Inkomati\nwas designated a compulsory licensing zone because it is so\nwater stressed. This once-only responsibility has been ceded\nto DWA Pretoria because the CMA is still in its infancy:\nThus, the most important power and tool for redress has been\nlost to the CMA.\nThe irrigation boards have actually enjoyed a high level\nof power in the day-to-day management of water at the micro\nlevel. Ironically, the 1998 Act is taking power away from the\nlocal level and vesting it at the Water ManagementArea level\nwith the CMA. Of concern also was the ambiguous volun-\ntary status of WUAs that may contravene one of Ostrom's\n(1990) \"design principles\" for sustainable institutions: If the\nmembership of institutions is not clearly defined or bounded,\nit is very difficult to impose sanctions.\nAccountable. Representative organizations need to be held\naccountable to their constituents (Agrawal & Ribot, 1999).\nThe CMA Governing Board was not directly elected, but\nthe Minister made the selections from nominations. They\nmay therefore feel more accountable to government than the\nsector they represent. The desirable downward accountabil-\nity is likely to pose problems for the Potential Agricultural\nWater Use representative on the CMA Governing Board,\nbecause their constituents are not yet water users, and thus\nnot organized around water nor are they members of WUAs.\nAccountability needs to be linked to practical considerations.\nWhen the potential users may come from a distant part of\nthe catchment, several hours' travel away and speak a differ-\nent African language, how is it practical to hold \"surgeries?\"\nThese arrangements rely on the assumption that there is one\nBlack population.\nSustainable Development Outcome Evaluation\nReferring back to Figure 1, the CMA and WUA case studies\nindicate that progress has stalled at the stage of establishing\nrepresentative organizations (products). These have taken a\nlong time to establish, and even now, the CMA has no real\npowers to effect redress and achieve social sustainability.\nThus, it is not possible to assess whether participatory initia-\ntives will result in more sustainable outcomes. However, this\nshould not deter attempts to put in place a framework for\nevaluation for a time when there are discernible changes.\nThe ultimate goal of the participatory initiative embodied\nin the 1998 Act was redress, and environmental protection\nas well as economic growth, so it seems reasonable to use\nthese three pillars of sustainability as a framework against\nwhich to measure achievement. All three are needed for bal-\nanced development (Baker, 2006). However, when the\nresource is in short supply, as it is in the Inkomati, and all\nthree aspects of sustainability can make legitimate demands\non it, tensions are inevitable. Redress in the Inkomati may\nonly be achieved if water is reallocated away from the (rela-\ntively) efficient commercial farming sector. In this context,\nthe price of social sustainability could be the upset of eco-\nnomic sustainability and goes some way to explain the pre-\nvarication of the government over redistribution. Similarly,\nthe economy may suffer if the vocal environmentalists are\nallowed to derail industrial expansion. What these instances\nsuggest is that there is a tendency in the South Africa\nGovernment to put economic sustainability first, which may\nultimately reinforce inequalities in this already highly ineq-\nuitable country.\nAny evaluation of progress is seriously hampered by an\nabsence of baseline data--an oversight we have noted with\nthe rolling out of participatory programs. It might be useful\nin South Africa to work on this forthwith, so there are statis-\ntics available at the appropriate scale for when outcomes\nstart to show. Too many indicators becomes unwieldy and\nimpractical to collect and analyze (Bell & Morse, 1999), and\ngiven the human resources situation in SouthAfrica, this also\nneeds to be borne in mind.\nKey Findings of the Evaluative Framework\nThe strength of the evaluative framework is that it allowed\nfor careful and methodical analysis of four different partici-\npatory initiatives in South Africa and for general conclusions\nto be drawn. The framework assists in answering the follow-\ning important question: If the rationale is that top-down mod-\nels failed, what is the evidence that participatory efforts will\nresult in more sustainable outcomes in South Africa? The\nframework also importantly clarifies the distinction between\nprocesses, products, and outcomes that has often become\nblurred in the literature, and thus allows researchers, practi-\ntioners, and decision makers to track progress toward the\nultimate goal of the initiative.\nTime emerges as an important factor from the vignettes\npresented. The CMA and WUA case studies illustrate how\nlong it takes to establish representative organs of governance.\nIndeed, the analysis demonstrates that progress has stalled at\nthe stage of establishing new representative institutions (the\nproduct of participatory processes). The rural Black popula-\ntion has yet to see any meaningful change, and it is unlikely\nthe CMA will be in a position to effect redistribution in the\nnear future. The CMA vignette suggests that decisions are\nmore expedient when they are not participatory--for exam-\nManagement Areas by consultants. The argument is that they\nare not transparent, but neither was the supposedly participa-\ntory Inkomati Advisory Committee, as the CMA vignette\ndemonstrated. The Sappi Kraft vignette also suggests that\nparticipatory efforts considerably slow down decision mak-\ning, which could have an impact on the economy. Moreover,\nparticipatory efforts have the potential to give undue power\nto a vocal minority at the expense of the majority and are\nopen to manipulation. In the case of the CMA vignette, the\ninterventions by DWA Pretoria officials to stave off elite cap-\nture of the CMA process, the ceding of Black representatives\nto more vocal White participants in heterogeneous meetings,\nand the dependence on White NGO representation, all under-\nline the need for a reduction in knowledge and power asym-\nmetries before meaningful participation can take place.\nHowever, given the legacy of educational disparities and\npetty discrimination resulting from apartheid policies, this\nrebalancing may take one or two generations to accomplish.\nIs this realistic or even fair given South Africa's history?\nWilliams (2004) suggests we now need to ask ourselves\n\"what longer term political value do participatory processes\nLeadership emerges from the analysis as being hugely\nimportant: Individuals with particular personal qualities are\nbehind the CMAproposal process, the two approved WUApro-\nposals, and the Crocodile Forum. It may not accord with notions\nof community action, but remove it, and initiatives flounder.\nThe need to evaluate both processes and outcomes is clear,\nbut Conley and Moote (2003) are right that it is a \"daunting\ntask\" (p. 374), and as one moves from processes toward out-\ncomes, the difficulties intensify. The vignettes also demon-\nstrate the real difficulty of measuring the outcomes of\nparticipatory efforts, which also partly explains the dearth of\nprocess- and outcome-orientated evaluations. A constraint\nof the framework has been the dearth of baseline data col-\nlected prior to the initiation of participatory efforts, which\ndoes compromise evaluations. This is in part due to the\nunwavering faith in the power of participation to yield results.\nUltimately, the evaluative framework (Figure 1) reminds\nus that sustainable outcomes and not stages along the way\nare the ultimate goal of the many participatory efforts, and\nthus the measure of their success. When applied to the CMA\nand WUA case studies, the evaluative framework demon-\nstrates that the initiatives have not progressed in a linear\nfashion from process criteria to sustainable outcomes:\nRather, their journey has been iterative, coming to a halt with\nparticipatory governance institutions, then turning back to\ntry to perfect approaches, particularly representation. Those\npractitioners with a dogged faith that participation will\ndeliver in the end see \"`getting the techniques right' [as] the\nprincipal way of ensuring the success of such approaches\"\nplified with the action of DWA Pretoria in both the establish-\nment of the CMA and approval of WUA proposals. It is thus\nunsurprising that many researchers have also focused on pro-\ncess evaluations because as this study illustrates, they are\neasier to undertake. Perfecting participatory processes lies in\nthe realms of the possible, and as Medawar (1967) reminds\nus \"[i]f politics is the art of the possible, research is surely the\nart of the soluble. Both are immensely practical-minded\naffairs\" (p. 7). Sustainability outcome evaluations take us\ninto uncomfortable and uncharted territory. Nonetheless, it is\nhoped that the evaluative framework and the lack of sustain-\nable outcomes they lay bare may force decision makers to\nacknowledge that the participatory experiment is flawed and\ninstead to consider policies that can yield redress and sus-\ntainable management in a more expedient fashion.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbernethy, C.
