To be \"caught\" playing as an adult therefore risks embarrassment.\nStill, many designers want to create enjoyable, nonembarrassing play experiences for\nadults. To address this need, this article reads instances of spontaneous adult play\nthrough the lens of Erving Goffman's theory of the interaction order to unpack\nconditions and strategies for nonembarrassing adult play. It identifies established\nframes, segregated audiences, scripts supporting smooth performance, managing\naudience awareness, role distancing, and, particularly, alibis for play: Adults routinely\nprovide alternative, adult-appropriate motives to account for their play, such as child\ncare, professional duties, creative expression, or health. Once legitimized, the norms\nand rules of play themselves then provide an alibi for behavior that would risk being\nembarrassing outside play.\n",

Rarely do we see adults\nin the street engage in a bout of free play. And when we do, children or dogs seem\nnecessarily involved. Why is that?\nAcross societies, in any given situation, adults are expected to competently and\nappropriately enact their social roles. Beyond direct sanctions, they are compelled to\ndo so by embarrassment, a social emotion that internalizes the imagined devaluation\nof one's self by others over incompetent or inappropriate acts (Goffman, 1967). Now\neven in societies less informed by a Protestant work ethic (Weber, 2010), play is\nconsidered the frivolous opposite of adult conduct (Sutton-Smith, 1997). Adults\ndon't play, it follows, because play would be role-inappropriate and therefore\nembarrassing. Indeed, there is ample evidence that feared embarrassment shies\nadults away from playing with toys (Heljakka, 2013), pervasive games and public\ninstallations (Wouters et al., 2016), even interactive museum exhibits (Scott,\nHinton-Smith, Ha\n\u00a8rma\nAnd yet, from Bingo halls to bowling nights and Adult Fans of Lego, adults do\nplay, regularly so, and often quite unashamedly. This contradicts the strict juxtapo-\nsition of play and adulthood but also raises the question when and how adults are\nable to engage in unembarrassed play. This question holds direct value to designers\nwho wish to reduce embarrassment as a hurdle to engagement or evoke embarrass-\nment in more experimental, aesthetic works (Deterding et al., 2015). While the\nliteratures on play (Henricks, 2015) and embarrassment (Miller, 1997) are rich and\ngrowing, there is as of yet little connection between the two, therefore little under-\nstanding of how embarrassment comes about in adult play--and thus, how designers\nmight intentionally address it. To fill this gap, this article presents a theoretical account\nof the relation of adulthood, play, and embarrassment, grounded in Erving Goffman's\nanalyses of face-to-face interaction. His work is particularly apt for the task, as it\nprovides a coherent theoretical framework of both play and embarrassment and is\nbroadly congruent with current empirical data (Deterding, 2014; Miller, 1997). Like\nGoffman's own accounts (Williams, 1988), the following analysis draws on everyday\ndata, existing studies, and thought experiments to inform and constrain theory and\nillustrate ramifications. It first presents Goffman's theory of the interaction order and\nembarrassment. It then unpacks how the social categories adulthood and play entail\nconflicting identity claims. From this, the article derives conditions and issues for\nnonembarrassing adult play as well as common techniques of deflecting embarrass-\nment. The conclusion discusses emergent observations and open ends.\nTheoretical Framework\nTo survive, humans have to maintain the affection, benevolence, and trust of their\nconspecifics. The functioning of society in turn depends on people behaving intel-\nligibly and reliably. The interaction order (Goffman, 1983) is the social machinery\nthat ensures both in everyday life, and social emotions are its fuel (Goffman,\n1967). The interaction order captures the social orderings that obtain in\nresponse\u00adpresent interaction: when two or more people act in mutual reflexive\nperception and awareness (Goffman, 1983). Central to it is the \"definition of the\nsituation\": People make sense of actions based on what kind of situation they\nbelieve to be in. This sense-making relies on a shared repertoire of frames, reoc-\ncurring types of situations such as \"going to the doctor\" or \"lecture\" (Goffman,\n1986). Framing is the usually taken-for-granted process by which actors constitute\na situation as the instantiation of a specific frame. Frames differ from group to\ngroup and change over time. \"Play\" and \"games\" are everyday labels for a family\nof frames that share important meanings and norms (such as autotelic enjoyment)\nbut also differ in many respects (Deterding, 2014).\nEvery frame entails a set of roles that can (and have to) be taken in by actors and\ndefines what conduct is expected and appropriate for each role. During socializa-\ntion, children internalize the frames and roles of their society--for example, how\nto be a proper \"guest\" when \"going to a restaurant.\" In the same process, they\nbecome aware of and construct their self from other's responses to them across\nsituations, become emotionally invested in this self, and adopt the values of their\ngroup regarding desirable self traits. In short, children start caring about face, \"an\nimage of self delineated in terms of approved social attributes\" (Goffman, 1967, p.\n5). Social emotions such as shame, pride, or embarrassment are the affective\ndimension of realizing or imagining how relevant others perceive and evaluate\nWhenever individuals interact, they implicitly or explicitly project certain\nidentity claims about their self: a competent cook, a kind nurse, or a polite passer-\nindividuals occupy in a given situational frame (the groom at the wedding), but\nidentity claims can obtain across situations: One doesn't stop being (and having\nto be) a policeman, a daughter, or a gay rights activist at a wedding.\nWhatever the specific roles and frames, the fundamental concern in any encoun-\nter is to maintain each other's face, chiefly by projecting and regarding valued and\nappropriate identities, fulfilling expectations connected to them, and keeping inter-\naction flowing smoothly. As a social event, embarrassment occurs when the valued\nidentity claims participants project in an encounter are somehow disconfirmed\nof interaction: It creates a pause where everyone is torn into self-conscious aware-\nness of the disruption with no ready script how to \"move swiftly on,\" restore lost face\nand get interaction going again. This in turn disconfirms every participant's basic\nvalued identity as a benign and skilled interactant: Adults should \"know not to\nembarrass each other\" and \"know what to say.\" As an internal process, embarrass-\nment is the sudden self-conscious awareness of such identity-disconfirming events,\ntogether with negative affect and arousal over seeing or imagining others who\ndisapprove of us as a result. This motivates us to avoid embarrassment-prone situa-\ntions and appease after an inappropriate action: blushing, apologies, and making\namends all signal that the embarrassment was unintentional, that we feel bad about\nit, and can therefore be trusted to act competently and considerate in the future\nism of social control.\nIn sum, embarrassment is overtly an event that publicly discredits active valued\nidentity claims of participants in an encounter. It discredits identities of the embar-\nrassed (e.g., being exposed in a white lie), the embarrasser (being exposed to be so\ninconsiderate as to let the truth slip), and possibly, all participants (being exposed as\nunskillful interactants not knowing how to get the conversation going again). Cov-\nertly, embarrassment is self-conscious awareness of and negative affect and arousal\nover the resultant (feared, imagined, and observed) devaluation of one's self by\npresent or imagined others.\nThe Identity Claims of Adulthood and Play\nGoffman's theory not only initiated sociological and psychological research on\nembarrassment: It is still in active use and congruent with current empirical data\n(Miller, 1997; Turner & Stets, 2006). Applying it to adult play immediately raises\nthe question what identity claims are entailed in adulthood and play.\nLike many cultural dualisms, adulthood is socially defined in contradistinction to\nchildhood (Jenkins, 2008, p. 257). Beyond biological maturity, it marks the social\nstatus of being a \"full\" member of society as a \"rational, objective, productive\nindividual\" (Moran, 1979, p. 24). According to contemporary (U.S. American) folk\nAdults are expected to fully and independently assess the ramifications of their\nactions against their own stable values and commitments, and self-regulate their\nconduct based on that. Second, adults are expected to be independently dependable.\nThey should develop the capacity to sustain themselves and a household of (inter)-\ndependent partners and children. Third, adults are expected to self-determinedly\ncomply with social norms, without sanction or reminder. In short, the identity claim\n\"adult\" entails showing stable internal values and commitments; capable self-\ngovernance based on those mindful of others and social norms; and a capacity and\nSutton-Smith, 1997)? Where adulthood stands for stable values, personality, and\nconduct, play signifies the Protean exploration of possible goals, selves, and beha-\nviors. Play submits adult self-governance to arbitrary outer rules and the\nspontaneous flow of events. Adulthood puts responsibility for collective survival\nfirst (via productive work and social care), while play follows the selfish pleasure\nprinciple, an \"occasion of pure waste\" (Caillois, 2001, p. 55) that temporarily abdi-\ncates concerns for instrumental outcomes. Where adulthood means reliable, norm-\nabiding conduct, play signifies the immoderate, spontaneous, norm-breaching,\nalways on the brink of dark play (Linderoth & Mortensen, 2015). Finally, the main\nsocially acknowledged function of play is to prepare for adulthood (Sutton-Smith,\n1997). Hence to be adult is to not be in need of play anymore. All this is not to deny\nthat there are abundant empirical instances of productive, regulated, and norm-\nabiding play. What matters here are the meanings ascribed to play in contemporary\nWestern societies and, thus, the identity projected by overt acts of play.\nConditions of Legitimate Adult Play\nAdulthood and play, then, claim fundamentally divergent identities. When we say\nthat play is childish, we mean that it is irresponsibly pleasure-driven, unproductive,\nand not mindful of social norms. Given this clash, how do we explain unembarrassed\nadult play in the wild? If identity-incongruent acts embarrass, play should not\nembarrass adults when it is identity-congruent: When to play is to be an adult,\npredictable, responsible, productive, norm-minding member of society. For\ninstance, it is the kindergarten teacher's adult job to play Patty Cake with children\nfor their edification; to not do so while on duty would be inappropriate, as would be\nplaying Patty Cake with adult strangers on a subway for fun. More generally, adult\nplay should not embarrass when it presents the smooth, unselfconscious perfor-\nmance of appropriate identities as part of established social frames and roles. Let\nus unpack these conditions.\nEstablished Frames\nFirst, we require an institutionalized frame within a particular social group: For\ninstance, a shared understanding of \"baseball\" being \"a thing,\" and a thing adults\ncan legitimately engage in. Else, one's behavior would be unintelligibly (and embar-\nrassingly) strange. Beyond basic frames, people can reframe or \"key\" a given strip of\nactivity, for example, do something ironically (Goffman, 1986, pp. 43\u00ad74). While\nplay itself may not be appropriate, its keying can be. Gambling is stigmatized, yet an\nactor can play a gambler in a theater production unspoilt--if she manages to signal\nsufficient difference between role and person.\nFrames legitimate play for particular persons in particular roles in particular\nsituations. Playing on your mobile phone to pass time is fine for a commuter on a\nsubway but not for a member of parliament during debate (Cresci, 2016). Continuing\nbiographical identity claims may clash or align with play across multiple situations.\nFor many, cross-dressing for a role in a school play embarrassingly disconfirms their\nvalued gender identity.\nOne broad family of legitimate adult play frames are professional and social\nresponsibilities. Parents, teachers, caretakers, therapists, trainers, game journalists\nall play in direct service of the well-being and education of others. For them, to play\nis to provide. Athletes and actors compete and perform for public edification and\nindividual gain. Game and toy designers and scholars play to test, improve, and\nunderstand play as a professional subject matter. Such legitimate instrumental key-\nA second family is leisurely recreation. The adult demands of constant self-\nregulation, role conformity, and self-provision are socially recognized to be taxing.\nTo cope, restore, and realize themselves as human beings, adults are allowed\n\"activity enclaves\" (Cohen & Taylor, 1976, p. 97) where they can temporarily cop\nout of the other-determined routines of everyday life, lower self-regulation, engage\nin hedonic pursuits, and express and explore alternate identities and practices not\nfitting their official roles. Common instances are hobbies, games, mass media con-\nGilchrist, 2009). Mardi Gras is a well-studied example where out-of-character sex-\nual behavior is framed as playful and accepted in public daylight (Redmon, 2003).\nNotably, such enclaves aren't any less socially regulated, only differently. Each of\nthese \"institutionalized escapes . . . has its time and its place\" (Cohen & Taylor,\n1976, p. 113): They are frames with particular normal (and normative) motives,\nsettings, objects, roles, scripts, and boundaries. Our escapes from the bounds of\nroutine and convention are themselves highly bounded, routine, and conventional\n(Cohen & Taylor, 1976, p. 97). Like all frames, they come with limits that can be\nresenting the holocaust in a game as inappropriately trivializing (Chapman & Lin-\nderoth, 2015). Importantly, adult leisurely play is expected to subordinate to work\nand social responsibilities. Leisurely gaming takes place during evenings, weekends,\nor holidays, when all other obligations are \"done for the day\" or in \"empty times\"\nlike a subway commute (Deterding, 2014). Two contributions in the present special\nissue directly testify to this subordination norm: Group sex events are scheduled in\nadvance to allow participating parents to arrange babysitters (Harviainen & Frank,\n2016, p. 10); board gaming parents fit their hobby into their parental duties by playing\nwith their children or shifting gameplay to times when the children are in bed (Roger-\nson & Gibbs, 2016). Being caught breaking these norms may induce embarrassment or\nshame. Failing to even acknowledge their existence harbors a worse fate--being\nconsidered insane (Goffman, 1983a), as the following statement by one of Rogerson\nand Gibbs (2016, p. 12) interviewees illustrates: she \"felt that her ex-husband's insis-\ntence on continuing to host and participate in game nights despite having a young baby\nwas a factor in their marriage breakdown. She saw this insistence as a symptom of her\nformer partner's mental health problems--`he just wouldn't grow up'.\"\nDifferent groups share different play frames and valuations of them. What\n\"official\" society considers inappropriate can be appreciated in subcultures and vice\nversa (Copes & Williams, 2007). Emotional distress that \"bleeds\" into postgame\nreality directly violates the norms of contemporary leisurely gaming frames (Deterd-\n20\u00ad28), which considers live action role-play (larp) a valid artistic medium for\ninsightful and transformative experiences, larps like Gang Rape are positively val-\nued for their ability to cause such \"bleeding\" distress (Montola, 2010).\nFinally, different forms or genres of play are differently valued for different\npersons. Sports and family board gaming are broadly acknowledged as \"valuable\"\npastime, while gambling carries stigma (King, 1990). Toy play is highly inappropriate\nfor adults, hence gets hidden or reframed as \"collecting\" (Heljakka, 2013). Outside\nrole-playing game communities, adult pretend play has to stay in the imagination,\ncued by fictional media or carnival props but not publicly acted out in extenso (Cohen\n& Taylor, 1976, p. 77). Even (or particularly) subcultural groups that hold adult play in\nhigh regard--such as fantasy/science fiction fandom and geekdom--maintain finely\ntuned and gendered status hierarchies of play genres, with writing commercial fiction\nat the top and Furry cosplay at the bottom (Busse, 2013).\nEffective Framing\nAn established frame is necessary but not sufficient for nonembarrassing adult play:\nframing a strip of events as an instantiation of such a frame requires necessary\nthough typically taken-for-granted work and resources. \"Baseball\" needs to be\npractically arranged (bats, gloves, balls, knowledgeable players, the works), but also\nsignaled. Embarrassment ensues where people engage in misframings (Goffman,\n1986, p. 302) such as mistaking a serious remark for a joke, or where framing\nremains ambiguous, for in such cases, observer and observed may feel to appear\nalternatively thick for \"not getting it\" or strange for doing something inscrutable.\nThe more institutionalized and conventionalized a play frame, and the more con-\nventional the materials and actions of the current strip, the more readily their framing.\nNovel play forms and unconventional instantiations therefore run higher risks of being\nperceived as improper or strange. Explicit framing indicators or \"brackets\" can reduce\nsuch risk (Goffman, 1986, p. 254). For instance, pervasive games (Montola, Stenros,\n& Waern, 2009) occur in public space commonly not used for play and are unknown\nto the broader population as a genre. \"Festival\" in contrast is a well-instituted frame\nfor temporary extraordinary behavior in public (Ravenscroft & Gilchrist, 2009).\nHence, pervasive games are commonly arranged as part of explicit festivals such as\nPlaypublik1 that employ brackets like police tape and signposts stating that a festival is\nin progress to help passers-by make sense of the unfolding events.\nSmooth Performance\nBy taking on the role of a player, people effectively claim to be reasonably apt ones.\nPublic performance frames such as sportive or creative contests raise the stakes of\nsuch skilled performance, as they explicitly invite onlookers to evaluate perfor-\nmers by it. Stepping up for a round of Karaoke effectively claims not just basic but\nperformance-worthy singing skills, which may be one reason many shy away from\nit. Taking on a player role also claims basic know-how for the play form in\nquestion--another reason why novel play forms are embarrassment-prone. Imag-\nine a subway conductor suddenly invited to a pervasive game in a subway. A\nsecond ago, she had expert knowledge regarding frame (subway ride) and role\n(conductor). Imposing play on her puts herself at risk: torn out of routine and with\nno knowledge of the game, exposed to a public that might find her breaking\nprofessional role by joining in. All she is left with is choosing between the embar-\nrassment of being a stiff spoilsport and the embarrassment of being a clumsy\nnovice and neglectful professional.\nThis also explains why improvisational or \"free,\" paidic play (Caillois, 2001)\ntriggers particular embarrassment fears. Games facilitate smooth interaction. At\nevery turn, a player can fall back on predefined, ready-to-hand goals, rules, and\nactions that are immediately intelligible to all thanks to their shared game knowl-\nedge. Improvisation offers no such scripts to follow or hide behind, making embar-\nrassing gaffes and pauses more likely (Lee, 2009), and every act can be read as direct\nexpressing one's personality, desires, and creative capacity. Professional improvi-\nsers like rappers therefore train \"canned resources\" (Lee, 2009) or prepared scripts to\nsave face and maintain the flow of interaction during inspirational blanks.\nUnselfconscious Involvement\nEvery frame and role hold norms how deeply to be visibly involved in a particular\nhigh-risk professions--are expected to maintain a certain \"cool\" poise and distance\nwhen play becomes so under- or overinvolving that participants can't hold back\ninappropriate involvement expressions (falling asleep and shouting in triumph);\nwhen outsiders peek in on the proceedings, thus actualizing adult role norms of cool\ncomposure; or when uninvolving activity releases awareness into self-conscious\nthought about one's public appearance. The flustering and blushing produced by\nthis may then cause further embarrassment by disrupting one's smooth and com-\nrare case where deep unselfconscious involvement is both socially expected and\nafforded by play objects and practices (Deterding, 2015b).\nStrategies of Embarrassment Deflection\nEven legitimate adult play may provoke embarrassment, be it that structural condi-\nparticipant identities and the particular play frame and genre is too strong (Goffman,\n15). Yet sometimes, individuals cannot or don't want to evade play. Instead, they\nwill look for strategies to reduce embarrassment (risk), something which profes-\nsional play practitioners should be especially aware of and adept at (Lee, 2009).\nWith no claim to comprehensiveness, four sets of strategies are worth highlighting:\nalibis, audience, awareness management, and role distancing.\nAlibis\nWhether an action disconfirms an identity depends on what meaning people ascribe\nto it: Was that elbow buff intentional or accidental? Hence, the accounts people offer\nfor actions are often as crucial as the actions themselves (Orbuch, 1997). A funda-\nmental norm of adult human conduct is to be reasonable. To not appear insane, our\nbehavior has to be intelligible as guided by reasons, ideally \"good\" ones (Goffman,\n1983a). Whenever others find our behavior questionable, they will likely hold us\naccountable: Asking us to provide an account why we did what we did. To maintain\nsocial standing and smooth interaction, we often have reason to give reasons for our\nactions different from the actual ones (Mills, 1940). In doing so, we can rely on (and\nought to limit ourselves to) \"motivational accounting systems\" (Ben-Yehuda, 1990),\nthe set of reasons accepted as normal for a particular activity.\nAdult play presents the interesting case where accounting not just has to render\nplay reasonable somehow but also in a way that neutralizes its tension with adult\nidentity. Autotelic enjoyment is widely recognized as the prime motivation of lei-\nsurely play (Boyle, Connolly, Hainey, & Boyle, 2012). And yet, \"pure\" autotelic\nenjoyment sits at odds with adult identity claims of responsibility, productivity, and\nself-regulation. When held accountable for their play, adults are therefore likely to\nfind themselves in need of an alibi.\nIn legal and everyday language, an alibi is \"a plea by a person accused of an act\nthat he or she was elsewhere when it took place\"; in a weaker and more colloquial\nsense, it means \"an excuse, pretext, or justification\" (OED Online, 2015; Olson &\nWells, 2004). In game scholarship, \"alibi\" has been used to denote how the rules of a\ngame and social contract of gaming give a pretext to engage in behaviors that would\nbe considered inappropriate out of game, such as touching people during a game of\nanalysis, one can theorize alibi more broadly as a motivational account that deflects\nnegative inference from displayed behavior to a person's identity. The account can\nbe factually true or not, explicit or implicit: What matters is that in the course of\nevents, it provides effectively implied plausible deniability. The fact that construct-\ning a model train with your child is \"quality family time\" and \"a great gift\" deflects\nthe inference that one might secretly still want to play with model trains.\nIrrespective of actual motivations, when adults are faced with an audience that may\nfind play at odds with their adult identity, they will be prone to account for their play\nwith such alibis. Gaming consoles are \"really\" bought because of the in-built DVD\nplayer (Thornham, 2009). Wargames train valuable cognitive faculties (Dunnigan,\nplaying nurtures creativity, self-development, and social skills (Bowman, 2010). Toys\nare smart investments in \"collections\" that accrue exchange value (Heljakka, 2013).\nPlaying is good for your health (Brown, 2009). Adult coloring books are \"Anti-Stress\nArt Therapy for Busy People\" (Farrarons, 2015); and so on. Lavenir's (2015) ethno-\ngraphy of a French video-gaming workshop for female seniors provides an instructive\nexample. Among themselves, these women admit and indeed insist that video gaming\nis an autotelic pleasure, not a means to a productive end like cognitive training--also\nto deflect the stigma that they would be so old as to need training. Yet outside the\nworkshop, they either hide that they play video games at all, or \"when confronted with\nsomeone coming from outside [ . . . ], fall back on a carefully crafted discourse on their\npractice and motivations\" (Lavenir, 2015, n.p.).\nAmateur gamblers peruse opposite alibis for the same reasons: They account for\ngambling as inconsequential leisure because the gambling stigma of addiction and\nfinancial folly far outstrips the mild disapproval stirred by \"frivolous fun\" (Smith &\nPreston, 1984). And like professional gamers, professional gamblers neutralize the\nstigma of gambling by accounting for it as routine, professional, and gainful labor\nThe same alibi logic operates in the ubiquitous discourses of game designers and\nscholars that frame games in terms of their economic import; educational and health\nbenefits; value as an artistic medium; or potential to drive collaboration, creativity, and\nproductivity. On the one hand, their profession provides them ready alibis for play. As\nthe half-joke among game scholars goes: \"This is all research.\" On the other, having\ntheirprofessional selvesinvested ina \"frivolous\" pastime stillexposes them topotential\ndisapproval in many circles. In stressing the \"serious\" positive social, economic, and\ncultural effects of play, game scholars and designers not only institute new alibis. They\neffectively operate as moral entrepreneurs who normalize and even valorize play--and\nwith it, their own professional identities (Best, 2003, pp. 38\u00ad43). Yet in doing so, they\nimplicitly reinforce the norm that \"just having fun\" is not reason enough for adult play,\nthat play and enjoyment ought to be subservient to productive and social rationales.\nA second source of embarrassment-deflecting alibis are keyings. One example\nare overt regroundings (Goffman, 1986, p. 74), \"the performance of an activity\n[ . . . .] for reasons or motives felt to be radically different from those that govern\nordinary actors\". Running through winter streets in speedos is strange; doing so for\ncharity as part of the \"Santa Speedo Run\"2 is not (Figure 1). The more excruciating\nthe embarrassment endured for a \"noble\" cause, the more positively it reflects on\nthe person. Another alibi-providing keying are humorous or ironic reversals. An\nembarrassment is an unintentional breach of normative expectations that is there-\nfore read as a direct, nonfabricated signal of a person's lacking skill, character, or\ngoodwill. Conversely, humor is a benign intentional breach of normative expec-\ntations (McGraw & Warren, 2010) that is therefore read as fabricated and thus not\nrevealing of a person's actual skill, character, or goodwill. If anything, it reveals\nthe benign intent of humoring others. Humor entails a risky identity claim itself, of\ncourse--few things are quite as embarrassing as a failing joke--but it is never-\ntheless a common saving strategy for embarrassment. By following up a faux-pas\nwith a witty remark that doubles down on it, we invite observers to retrospectively\nframe the mishap as part of an intentional attempt at humoring: \"It is natural, then,\nto find embarrassment and joking together, for both help in denying the same\nSuch humorous meaning reversals can also be employed preemptively. If tasked\nwith an action that is likely to discredit identity claims, people often make a point of\nmock performing, artificially exaggerating, or otherwise ironically keying the\naction. Afraid of embarrassing themselves at Karaoke, people might choose an\nintentionally campy song and sing ostentatiously false and with ostentatiously dra-\nmatic gestures to clarify that whatever expression they might produce, these are\nintended to be entertainingly bad, not due to lacking vocal or bodily grace.\nIn fact, once we successfully established an alibi for play (\"games are\neducational\"), the play framing itself provides an alibi of play for in-play activities.\nThe mad-lib rules and offensive cards of Cards Against Humanity \"provide[.] per-\nmission to tell jokes you don't dare by removing all sense of responsibility\" (Shut Up\n& Sit Down, 2015). On a positive note, people often actively seek out and play with\nFigure 1. Alibis for play: At the annual Santa Speedo Run, adults run in nothing but speedos\nand Santa hats through Boston's winter to raise money for children. The overt \"good cause\"\nreframes an otherwise embarrassingly strange, even criminal offence into ennobling care for\nothers. \"Santa Speedo Sprint 2008: The Bear Club for Men\" # by Tim Schapker, https://\nthe risk of embarrassing each other, and typically so in a play form like teasing: Few\nthings are quite as involving as other human beings putting their selves on the line\ntrust and levels status differences. The nonserious frame of play provides an alibi for\nmaking advances; showing off desirable traits like humility, composure, cool, and\nvances while saving face for everyone (Keltner, Capps, Kring, Young, & Heerey,\n2001). To desire or brag or reprimand openly would fully expose everyone to\npotential embarrassment; to do so playfully offers the plausible deniability that all\nwas meant in jest. In practice, alibis for and of play often readily fall together. We\ndidn't choose to play Twister, the host suggested it as an icebreaker, and we totally\ndon't enjoy being entangled right now, the rules demanded it: We're having fun\nwhile saving face (Figure 2).\nAudience Management\nIn the course of our lives, we have to claim multiple identities and satisfy multiple\nrole expectations with often conflicting demands. Likewise, we traverse groups with\ndifferent norms. What is normal to our geek friends is strange to our families at\nhome. Most everyday encounters luckily only demand the performance of select\nidentities before congruent audiences: a commanding dom at home, a nurturing\nteacher at kindergarten (Goffman, 1967, p. 108). However, certain situations\n\"collapse contexts\" (boyd, 2008) and with them, identities and audiences, making\nFacebook feed, or intercultural business meeting are ready examples. This makes\npublic play structurally embarrassment-prone. Public spaces expose us to diverse\nand usually not fully overseeable audiences, carrying the (perceived) danger of\ndoing something that breaks the norms of some incidental observer. Audience seg-\nregation is therefore a common strategy of deflecting embarrassment (Goffman,\n1967, p. 108). It is an elusive obvious fact that adult play typically takes place in\nprivate home spaces where one is literally shielded from the eyes and ears of\npotentially disapproving others (Deterding, 2015b). Embarrassing play activities\nlike Karaoke are staged in dedicated places not transparent to the outside world,\nand groups rent individual private cabins within them.\nJust like nonembarrassing play needs the absence of disapproving others, so it is\nfacilitated by present approving ones. The framing of a strip of events as legitimate\nplay requires response-present others to acknowledge its reality through joint enact-\nment or accepting inattention (\"nothing special to see here\"). To consider an activity\n\"normal,\" a sufficient number of others has to explicitly or implicitly signal that it is\nnormal (Goffman, 1972, p. 72). As threshold models of collective behavior like rioting\npredict, actors will engage in a behavior once the proportion of perceived others\nengaging in it tips the benefits minus costs of engaging over those of not engaging\n(Granovetter, 1978; Oliver, 1993). Given enough dancers on the dance floor, the risk\nof being seen wrongly claiming performance-worthy dancing skills becomes smaller\nthan the risk of being spotted as a spoilsport on the edge (leaving potential enjoyment\nbenefits of dancing aside for the moment). As individuals may have different thresh-\nolds, cascade dynamics become likely. The moment one very low-threshold dancer\n\"breaks the ice,\" their social proof may be enough to tip people with the next higher\nthresholds over the edge and so on. This dynamic is recognized as one aspect of the so-\ncalled honeypot effect (Wouters et al., 2016). Other people visibly engaging with a\npublic interface stimulate passers-by to likewise approach, observe, and engage with\nit. Put differently, audience aggregation is another relevant strategy for deflecting\nembarrassment. Festivals for instance aggregate a self-selecting group of people into\nspatiotemporal response-presence who feature highly approval of and low engage-\nment thresholds for the celebrated play activity. Surrounded by hundreds of other\ncosplayers in costume, we feel normal in our faux-troll second skin.\nAwareness Management\nPhysically removing audiences is one way of deflecting their perceived disapproval.\nAnother is to interrupt the mutual perception between actor and audience: Be it that\nthe audience is absent in the actor's awareness, be it that the actor is visibly absent in\nthe audience's. The latter is another embarrassment-reducing dynamic of large\nFigure 2. Alibis of play: Fulfilling the role expectations of being a considerate player requires\npeople to play by the rules. The norms of Twister thus temporarily replace the public\ninteraction norm not to touch strangers. In addition, touching another romantically always\ncarries the risk of embarrassing rejection.

The more people there are in a street game, the less the individual has to\nfear that disapproving eyes fall on her in particular. Dark rooms, costumes, masks,\npseudonyms, and avatars also serve this function. They make actors visible but not\nidentifiable. During the immersive theater productions of Punchdrunk, I observed\nmany uninhibited behaviors by mask-wearing audience members. Similarly, con-\ncerns for embarrassment recede when individuals become engrossed in an activity.\nIn personal observation, when adults try out VR gaming for the first time, they first\nshow high anxious awareness of how silly they must look wearing a headset and\nmaking strange gestures, but as goggles and headphones cut off perception of the\naudience and gameplay demands their full attention, this anxiety vanishes, only to\nreturn with shocked realization when they take headset and headphone of and\nperceive their (often laughing) audience.\nRole Distancing\nA final deflection strategy is role distancing, \"actions which effectively convey\nsome disdainful detachment of the performer from a role he is performing\" (Goff-\nshe asked two young adolescent boys to play the \"girl game\" The Sims 2, they\nimmediately managed the identity threat by keying into nonserious, parodist play,\ncreating the to-them-absurd characters of an overweight, Black homosexual couple.\nWith smiles, giggles, expletives, gesturing, and mimicking, they constantly signaled\nhow ridiculous and mock-offensive all this play is.\nConclusions and Elisions\nEmbarrassment arises when people become aware of imagined or real others per-\nceiving events disconfirming their valued identities. The social meanings of play--\nunruly, pleasure-driven, free, and unproductive--disconfirm the valued social iden-\ntity of being a self-regulated, norm-abiding, and productive adult. Hence, play risks\nembarrassing adults. And yet, there are instances when adults do play unembarras-\nsedly. To resolve this paradox, we unpacked conditions and strategies for unembar-\nrassed adult play. Unembarrassed play requires an established frame of legitimate\nplay; we found two families of such frames, professional responsibilities like play-\nas-child care and leisurely recreation like hobbies. It requires that valued identities\nand situational role expectations don't clash, which is facilitated by physically\nsegregating audiences with differing expectations or by enacting distance to a clash-\ning situationally demanded role. It requires clearly framing the given activity as an\ninstance of a legitimate frame, supported by physical framing signals and aggregat-\ning audiences that mutually signal the normalcy of play by joining in, cheering, or\nnot minding. It requires smooth performance of role expectations, made easier by\nclear scripts, rules, and fallback routines. It requires appropriately deep involvement\nin play and lowered self-consciousness of one's public appearance, aided by\nengrossing activities and masks, pseudonymous avatars, or hiding in a crowd, dis-\nrupting the response-presence of others.\nFinally, we found that the most obvious motivation for play--autotelic enjoy-\nment--also sits in most direct tension with adult identity. To account for their play,\nadults therefore regularly resort to alibis, motivational accounts that deflect negative\ninference from their play behavior to their character. Adults account for play as\nserving their adult responsibilities: be it that it is part of gainful labor or providing\nfor others; be it that it nurtures their health and productive faculties; be it that it\nserves communal cohesion or artistic expression; or be it that it is re-grounded as\ncharity or a joke. To play as an adult--legitimately, unembarrassed--is to play\nresponsibly. As one of the countless guidelines for \"responsible gambling\" puts it:\n\"Don't let gambling interfere with family, friends or work.\"3\nThis observation underlines the general methodological caveat that why people\ndo things and why they say they do things are often different (Briggs, 2007; Mills,\n1940)--a caveat rarely heeded in contemporary research on gameplay motivation\nBut it also highlights something distinct about play: While we routinely take the\nlegitimacy of activities like working or studying for granted, adult play today\nremains contested and precarious, subservient to productivity norms. Take the fol-\nlowing news story on a recent study by three economists. They observed that from\n2004 to 2014, a significant and growing portion of noncollege-educated young men\nin the United States chose to displace wage labor time with playing video games.\nGiven a lack of good job opportunities, this choice increased their life satisfaction.\nHowever, far from congratulating the young men on their economically rational\npreference maximization, the economists and reporting journalist paint this as a\nsocial problem: \"if a historically vibrant portion of the population doesn't feel as\nmuch desire to work, this could harm the economy's future and the ability of\ngovernment to use policy to create jobs\", or as one quoted economist put it: \"That's\na big chunk of labor that could be used for something, and we're not using it\"\n(Swanson, 2016). Labor, historically viewed as divine punishment or the means to\nleisure, here is the taken-for-granted end of adult life, while adult leisurely play\nremains ever suspicious and in need of justification. The Protestant work ethic seems\nMaybe for this reason, most frames of legitimate adult play incorporate the full\ngamut of conditions, strategies, and alibis. German carnival for instance provides a\nwell-established festival frame legitimized by tradition, huge play groups and lavish\ndecoration establishing a clear framing, easy-to-follow scripts reducing required\ncompetence, the alibi of collective obligatory participation and intoxication, and\nample awareness shields (masks, costumes, large crowds, loud music). It also\ndemonstrates another fact: To not participate in an ongoing encounter of legitimate\nadult play is itself an embarrassing norm breach. Those whose persisting biographi-\ncal identities clash with the identity of a carnival-goer but feel the social pressure to\nparticipate are easily recognizable by the most severe (and chagrined) acts of mock\ninvolvement, ironic meta-commentary, and role distancing. Or by leaving town for\nthe duration.\nSimilarly, our analysis suggests multiple reasons why games are more suited for\nunembarrassed adult play than free play. Games are highly institutionalized and\nconventionalized and as such easily signaled and recognized; they come prelegiti-\nmized with imputed motives of recreation, family quality time, and so on; they are\ndesigned to be highly absorbing, leaving little mental reserve to become self-\nconscious (compared to the many pauses and stops of free play); they are highly\nscripted, ensuring smooth interaction and requiring little spontaneous creativity; and\ntheir rules offer established alibis for in-game actions.\nNow nothing here is special. The conditions of embarrassment and means of\ndeflecting it that obtain in adult play obtain for any social frame. If anything, the\nboundedness of play lends itself nicely to develop general theories. \"Games seem to\ndisplay in a simple way the structure of real-life situations\" (Goffman, 1972, p. 32).\nThe present essay is very much an exercise in this spirit.\nAs a sociological account, it necessarily foregoes individual difference and\nchange. Psychology tells us that people have different degrees of embarrassability\nand that concern for how others perceive us can be unlearned (Miller, 1997).\nFurthermore, as a synchronic snapshot of one society, the present analysis is blind\nto cultural and historical differences and trajectories. How do \"our\" norms of legit-\nimate adult play compare to those of other cultures and centuries? To what extent are\nthe \"ludification of culture\" (Deterding, 2015a), the appearance of \"emergent\n\"infantilization\" (Bernadini, 2014) shifting the grounds of play and adulthood? To\nempirically trace the boundaries of embarrassment in adult play is to put such high-\nlevel descriptions of social change to the test. Just as Plato suggested that play\nreveals the natural dispositions of an individual, studying \"what categories of per-\nsons become embarrassed in what recurrent situations\" (Goffman, 1967, p. 109) may\ntell us much about the state of our societies.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of\nthis article: This work was conducted in the Digital Creativity Labs (digitalcreativity.ac.uk),\nNotes\n3. http://www.oregonlottery.org/ResponsibleGambling.aspx.
