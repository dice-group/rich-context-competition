Surgical resection is a\nmajor treatment for patients with early- and mid-\ndle-stage HCC that produces good results.\nHowever, the majority of patients are medically\ninoperable at the time of diagnosis, and few\nmeaningful therapeutic options are currently\navailable. Traditionally, radiotherapy (RT) was\ninfrequently used for treatment of HCC due to\nearly reports that the radiation tolerance of the\nliver was far less than the therapeutic radiation\ndose [Koo et al. 2010]. Since three-dimensional\nconformal RT (3DCRT) was introduced for the\ntreatment of HCC, it has achieved encouraging\nclinical outcomes [Sharma, 2014]. Due to its\nincreased benefits, RT has been recommended for\nthe treatment of all HCC tumours irrespective of\nMinimum absolute lymphocyte counts\nduring radiation are associated with\na worse prognosis in patients with\nunresectable hepatocellular carcinoma\nQianqian Zhao, Xiaoqing Xu, Jinbo Yue, Kunli Zhu, Rui Feng, Shumei Jiang,\nZhonghua Qi and Renben Wang\n Keywords: clinical outcomes, hepatocellular carcinoma, minimum absolute lymphocyte\ncounts, prognostic, radiotherapy\nCorrespondence to:\nRenben Wang, MD\nDepartment of Radiation\nOncology, Shandong\nCancer Hospital affiliated\nto Shandong University,\nHuaiyin District, Jinan\nCity, Shandong Province,\nPeople's Republic of China\nwangrenben@sina.cn\nQianqian Zhao, MD\nZhonghua Qi, MD\nSchool of Medicine and\nLife Sciences, University of\nJinan-Shandong Academy\nof Medical Sciences,\nJinan, Shandong Province,\nPeople's Republic of China\nDepartment of Radiation\nOncology, Shandong\nCancer Hospital affiliated\nto Shandong University,\nJinan, Shandong Province,\nPeople's Republic of China\nXiaoqing Xu, MD\nJinbo Yue, MD\nKunli Zhu, MD\nRui Feng, MD\nShumei Jiang, MD\nDepartment of Radiation\nOncology, Shandong\nCancer Hospital affiliated\nto Shandong University,\nJinan, Shandong Province,\nPeople's Republic of China\nOriginal Research\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(2)\ntheir location (National Comprehensive Cancer\nLymphocytes, which belong to a population of\nradiation sensitive cells, account for approxi-\nmately 30% of the normal human white blood\ncell population and play an important role in anti-\ntumour immunity [Topalian et al. 2011]. In a\nstudy by Nagai and colleagues, peritransplant\nlymphopenia was found to predict HCC recur-\nrence after liver transplantation [Nagai et al.\n2014]. A low absolute lymphocyte count (ALC)\nwas also used as an indicator of malnutrition and\npoor immune response in patients with chronic\nliver disease [Fernandez-Ruiz et al. 2009]. In\naddition, increasing evidence has shown that\nradiation-related lymphopenia is correlated with\ntumour progression and prognosis in several types\nof advanced cancers [Kitayama et al. 2011; Cho\nhypothesize that peripheral ALCs will decline\nduring RT, and the degree of decline may exhibit\nsome clinical significance. However, the relation-\nship between the minimum absolute lymphocyte\ncount (Min ALC) during RT and clinical out-\ncomes in patients with HCC has not been charac-\nterized. Therefore, the aim of this retrospective\nanalysis was to validate our hypotheses and to\ninvestigate the clinical significance of Min ALCs\nduring RT in HCC patients.\nMethods\nStudy populations\nThe study was conducted with the approval of the\nShandong Tumour Prevention and Control\nInstitutional Ethics Committee, Shandong Cancer\nHospital affiliated to Shandong University. Written\ninformed consent was obtained from the patients\nor their legal representatives. Data from patients\nwho were diagnosed with HCC based on pathology\nresults or who were diagnosed via the diagnostic\ncriteria of the American Association of the Study of\nLiver Guideline [Fitzmorris et al. 2015] at\nShandong Cancer Hospital affiliated to Shandong\nwere retrospectively analysed. The clinical data\nwere obtained from medical records. All patients\nsatisfied the following inclusion criteria: (i) 18\nyears of age; (ii) Eastern Cooperative Oncology\nGroup performance status of 0\u00ad1 [Gil-Alzugaray\net al. 2013]; (iii) received RT with a conventional\nfraction at our institution; (iv) available baseline\nclinical, laboratory and follow-up data; (v) the\nperipheral white blood cell counts were all above\n2000 cells/\u00b5l during RT treatment and didn't\nreceive any prophylactic or remedial treatment; and\n(vi) a survival time after RT of at least 3 months.\nPatients were excluded if they had a history of other\nmalignancies, failed to complete RT, had evidence\nof distant metastasis, had received surgical treat-\nment for HCC, had splenomegaly, a fever or an\nelevation of C-reactive protein during RT or had an\nHBV reactivation during RT that was attributed to\nHBV infection. A total of 69 patients with HCC\nwere finally included and evaluated. All patients\nhad undergone a standardized evaluation, includ-\ning abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan-\nning, chest X-ray or CT, brain magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) and bone radionuclide imaging,\nand the disease stage was identified according to\nthe Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system.\nRT was delivered via sliding window 3DCRT or\nintensity-modulated radiation therapy. A total dose\ngross tumour volume was delineated by CT accord-\ning to the primary lesion or the lipiodol deposit\nfrom transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and\nthe positive enlargement of retroperitoneal lymph\nnodes. All plans were completed using the Varian\nEclipse version 8.6.23 treatment planning system.\nAdditionally, treatment plans including RT dose,\nnumber of fractions and the start and the end date\nof RT were recorded for each patient.\nAssessment of absolute lymphocyte counts\nDetailed clinical and laboratory data that were\nobtained prior to the initiation of RT were col-\nlected from enrolled patients and included demo-\ngraphic data, tumour status, haematologic\nparameters, biochemical parameters and serum\nalpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. Blood samples\nwere obtained by venous puncture and were col-\nlected 0\u00ad3 days before the start of RT for the\nquantification of lymphocytes, as well as once a\nweek during RT and after RT. Changes in lym-\nphocyte counts during RT were evaluated.\nAdditionally, the Min ALCs and the days when\nMin ALCs were measured were analysed.\nFollow up and definition\nPatients underwent a standardized follow up after\nRT until the end of December 2015, their last visit\nto our hospital or death; the follow-up evaluations\nQ Zhao, X Xu et al.\nincluded physical examinations, peripheral blood\ncell counts, liver function tests, serum AFP meas-\nurements, HBV-deoxyribonucleic acid test results\n(HBV-DNA test), X-rays every 3 months for the\nfirst year and every 6 months thereafter and abdom-\ninal and pelvic CT or MRI every 6 months.\nRT-related toxicity was documented during and\nafter RT and was evaluated according to radiation\ntherapy oncology group criteria. Radiation-induced\nliver disease (RILD) was defined as either an anict-\neric elevation of alkaline phosphatase levels of at\nleast twofold and nonmalignant ascites (classic\nRILD) [Lawrence et al. 1995] or elevated transami-\nnases of at least fivefold of the upper limit of normal\nor of pretreatment levels (grade 3 or 4 hepatic tox-\nicity of the Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2.0\nby the National Cancer Institute), in the absence of\ndocumented progressive disease (nonclassic RILD)\n[Trotti et al. 2000]. Patients who experienced dis-\nease progression or recurrence were treated appro-\npriately with TACE, chemotherapy, or sorafenib.\nOverall survival (OS) was calculated from the time\nof the initiation date of RT to the date of death\nregardless of cause or the censored date of the last\ncontact for surviving patients.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS sta-\ntistical software (version 17, SPSS Inc., Chicago,\nIL, USA). Quantitative variables are presented as\nmedians and ranges and compared using the\nMann\u00adWhitney U test (nonparametric).\nQualitative variables are presented as frequencies\nand analysed using the Pearson chi-square test.\nCut-off values for laboratory data demonstrated\nthe maximum sensitivity and specificity for sur-\nvival based on the receiver-operating characteris-\ntic (ROC) curve [Budczies et al. 2012]. The\nprimary endpoint of this study was OS. Actuarial\nsurvival was obtained using the Kaplan\u00adMeier\nmethod and was compared with the results of the\nlog-rank test. We conducted univariate and mul-\ntivariate analyses using the Kaplan\u00adMeier method\nand the Cox proportional hazards model to assess\nfactors related to patients' survival. Potential risk\nfactors with a p value of <0.1 in the univariate\nanalysis were entered into a multivariate analysis\nto determine their independent effect. The sam-\nple size for the current study was not based on\npredetermined power calculations. The sample\nsize from our analyses (n = 69) had 96% power to\ndetect a hazard ratio (HR) for the effects of Min\nALC on OS. A value of p < 0.05 in the two-tailed\nanalysis was considered to indicate a statistically\nsignificant difference.\nResults\nBaseline characteristics of patients and clinical\noutcomes\npatients were diagnosed with HCC and received\nRT at the Shandong Cancer Hospital affiliated to\nShandong University.

As for\npostradiotherapy treatment, 65 patients received\nTACE (number of times were 2\u00ad5), two patients\nreceived chemotherapy and two patients received\nsorafenib as a result of distant metastasis.\nROC curve analysis was performed to determine\nthe threshold Min ALC for the prediction of OS\n[Budczies et al. 2012]. The most predictive Min\nALC was determined to be 450 cells/\u00b5l (sensitiv-\nity and specificity, 50% and 70.6%, respectively),\nand the area under the curve of the Min ALC was\n0.56. To evaluate the prognostic role of Min\nALCs, we divided the whole group into a lower\ncharacteristics of patients with respect to the cut-\noff Min ALC of 450 cells/\u00b5l are shown in Table 2.\nNo significant differences were observed between\nthe two groups for most baseline characteristics,\nexcept for the BCLC stage.

As expected, the\naverage circulating lymphocyte counts declined\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(2)\nand on the days when Min ALCs were measured\nare plotted in Figure 1(b).

Saroha and colleagues suggested\nthat a low ALC is associated with aggressive fea-\ntures and inferior survival in patients with clear\ncell renal cell carcinoma [Saroha et al. 2013].\nBalmanoukian and colleagues reported that lym-\nphopenia was an independent predictor\nfor survival in patients with resected pancreatic\nadenocarcinoma [Balmanoukian et al. 2012]. A\ndecline in peripheral lymphocyte counts after RT\nwas first described in the 1970s [Stratton et al.\n1975], but the clinical significance has not been\nwell studied. This retrospective analysis of HCC\npatients who received RT demonstrated that lym-\nphocyte counts declined after RT, and this obser-\nvation has also been found in other cancer types\nFigure 2. Survival curves according to the Kaplan\u00adMeier method in the patients who underwent radiotherapy.\n(a) Overall survival (OS) curve with a comparison of the survival rates in different Barcelona Clinic Liver\nCancer (BCLC) score; (b) OS curve with a comparison of the survival rates in the low- and high-alpha-\nfetoprotein (AFP) groups; (c) OS curve with a comparison of the survival rates in the low- and high neutrophil\u00ad\nlymphocyte ratio (NLR) groups; (d) OS curve with a comparison of the survival rates in the low- and high-\nabsolute lymphocyte count (ALC) groups; (e) OS curve with a comparison of the survival rates in the low- and\nhigh-minimum (Min) ALCs groups.\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(2)\nstudy, a multivariate analysis revealed that Min\nALCs were a predictor of OS that was independ-\nent of the BCLC score and the serum AFP level.\nPatients who developed lower lymphopenia (Min\nALCs  450 cells/\u00b5l) after RT had worse OS than\nthose who exhibited relatively higher Min ALCs\nperipheral lymphocyte counts would result in a\npoor prognosis for HCC patients. The mecha-\nnisms behind this finding are multifactorial and are\nnot yet completely understood. Some theories may\nexplain this association. First, some studies have\nsuggested that lymphopenia during RT might be\ncaused by the apoptosis of lymphocytes that are\ncaught in the radiation field [Yovino and\nGrossman, 2012]. Second, the correlation\nbetween the increasing infiltration of CD4+\nT lymphocytes at tumour margins and a better\nprognosis of HCC patients has been demonstrated\n[Ma et al. 2016]. Third, in vivo studies have shown\nthat tumour cells that are dead or dying due to RT\nwith or without chemotherapy can present as\ntumour-associated antigens to host immune cells\nand thereby activate antitumour immune responses\n[Apetoh et al. 2007]. Some clinical data have\nrevealed the presence of radiation-induced antitu-\nmour immunity in humans [Schaue et al. 2008].\nLymphocytes exert an antitumour effect in the\ntumour microenvironment and affect cancer devel-\nopment and progression [Fu et al. 2013]. HCC\npatients with severe lymphopenia have worse\nimmune system function and antitumour immu-\nnity. This association has also been verified in\nConsequently, a lower serum Min ALC during\nRT, as a reflection of the host immunity network,\nmay be used to predict the result of cancer treat-\nment. However, we cannot ignore the effect of\nvarious factors such as host nutrition and chronic\ninfection on the peripheral lymphocyte counts.\nHBV activation and other infections were not\ndetected in any patients in our study during the\ncourse of RT; therefore, we could state that this\nvalue reflects the overall condition of the host to\nfight the tumour. The Min ALC may be a good\nmarker of the host immune reaction to the tumour.\nIn the present study, we found that the ALC and\nNLR before RT were correlated with OS accord-\ning to the univariate analysis, similar to the results\nof previous studies [Templeton et al. 2014]. In\nfact, accumulated evidence has suggested that a\nhigher NLR is an independent prognostic factor\nin various solid tumours, including HCC [Kishi\n2011]. In addition, some studies have shown that\na high NLR may suggest an impaired host\nimmune response of HCC patients to the tumour\n[Zhong et al. 2006]. Taken together, these results\nindicated that an elevated NLR can indirectly\nreflect OS. Our results showed that patients with\nan NLR  3 exhibited significantly better OS\nHowever, the association between a high NLR\nand poor survival is likely complex and largely\nunclear. The increased number of neutrophils\nand the decreased number of lymphocytes could\nresult in a high NLR. Patients with lymphocyto-\npaenia have a weaker lymphocyte-mediated\nimmune response to the tumour as noted above.\nAs for patients with neutrophilia, Grivennikov\nand colleagues suggested that systemic and local\nFigure 3. Survival curves according to the Kaplan\u00adMeier method in the patients who underwent radiotherapy.\nThe graphs represent the assessment of the prognostic role of minimum absolute lymphocytes counts (Min\nALC) during RT according to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) score B (a) and BCLC score C (b).\nQ Zhao, X Xu et al.\ninflammatory responses to the tumour may play a\nrole in tumour invasion [Grivennikov et al. 2010].\nIn addition, neutrophils have been shown to be\ninvolved in angiogenesis, which affects tumour\ndevelopment and is associated with a poor prog-\nnosis in HCC patients [Zhong et al. 2006]. Taken\ntogether, these findings indicate that an elevated\nNLR can indirectly reflect the tumour burden,\ninvasion and OS. Therefore, in-depth research\ninto the mechanism of such an effect is warranted.\nA lower ALC and an elevated NLR before RT\nwere correlated with a poor prognosis, but were\nnot found to be independent predictors of OS\naccording to the multivariate analysis in our\nstudy, while a lower serum Min ALC (450 cells/\n\u00b5l) during RT was an independent predictor of\nOS. Therefore, a lower serum Min ALC during\nRT may be a more suitable and reliable long-term\nprognostic predictor for HCC patients.\nThe effect of the RT dose on the probability of\ntumour control and survival is well established\n[Ben-Josef et al. 2005]. Dawson and colleagues\nfound that patients who were treated with >70\nGy had an improved MST compared with those\nstudy, no correlation between RT dose and OS\nwas found. The radiation doses were all 39.60\u00ad\n63.48 Gy, and no patient received a radiation\ndose that was >70 Gy. Therefore, the RT dose\nthat patients received in our study was far less\nthan the lethal dose that obtained the maximum\nantitumour effect in HCC patients. The main\nbarrier to dose escalation is the presence of adja-\ncent critical structures, especially a normal liver\nparenchyma. The issue of how to maximize thera-\npeutic effects by escalating the radiation dose\nwhile simultaneously sparing the adjacent normal\nliver is a major subject of ongoing investigations.\nConsidering that RT-related lymphopenia\nappears to be common, severe and closely associ-\nated with a poor prognosis in HCC patients, pro-\nspective studies are needed to further discover\nand test treatment approaches that preserve or\nrestore immunologic function. With regard to\ncheckpoint inhibitors, such as antiprogrammed-\ndeath 1, programmed-death ligand 1 and cyto-\ntoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 therapies, clinical\ntrials have suggested that treatment with these\nagents could restore immunologic function\n[Hiniker, 2012] and that the levels of peripheral\nlymphocytes are predictive of efficacy [M\u00e9nard\net al. 2008]. The results could steer future treat-\nment approaches towards a reduction in the tox-\nicities of RT in lymphocytes and produce a\ndefinition of the proper timing and use of immu-\nnologic interventions.\nSome major limitations of this study should be\naddressed. First, the survival analysis was limited\nby the retrospective analysis and small number of\npatients. The data were collected over a long\nperiod, from a single centre, and most patients\nhad HBV-related diseases. Second, no data\nshowed that lymphocyte subsets (i.e. B, helper T\nand cytotoxic T cells) or the alterations of differ-\nent subsets during or after RT could predict sur-\nvival. Third, some patients received additional\ntreatments such as TACE or sorafenib after the\ncompletion of RT. We believe that these treat-\nments may also effect the outcomes. Clearly,\nthese results warrant a largescale meta-analysis or\nprospective studies to validate our findings.\nThe results of this retrospective analysis demon-\nstrated that in addition to BCLC stage and serum\nAFP levels before RT, Min ALCs during RT\nhave an independent predictive value for OS. The\nMin ALC during RT, which is an immunity-\nbased prognostic marker, may act as a prognostic\nfactor for HCC patients who are undergoing RT.\nIn addition, peripheral lymphocyte counts are\nsimple to measure in clinical practice and are rou-\ntinely assessed in patients during treatment.\nTherefore, examination of the dynamic changes\nin lymphocyte counts may be helpful in the design\nof individualized treatments for HCC patients.\n"
