In addition, it investigated\nwhether there was a chemotherapy-induced\nchange in the anti-HBs titres of vaccinated\npatients and in patients who had had previ-\nous exposure to HBV.\nPatients and methods\nPatient population\nThis retrospective study reviewed the med-\nical records of consecutive adult patients\nwith haematological malignancies or solid\ntumours who received immunosuppressive\nanticancer therapy at the Department of\nMedical Oncology and the Department\nof Haematology, School of Medicine,\nOndokuz Mayis University, Samsun,\npatient's age, sex, type of cancer and chemo-\ntherapy regimen, and HBV serum markers,\nincluding HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc,\nwas obtained from their medical records.\nThe patients that tested negative for HBsAg\nand positive for anti-HBs secondary to\nvaccination or HBV infection prior to the\ninitiation of the chemotherapy were evalu-\nated for the study. Anti-HBc positive\npatients were defined as those with resolved\nHBV infection and anti-HBc negative\npatients were defined as vaccinated\npatients.9 Those patients who received !3\ncourses of chemotherapy and those who had\nHBsAg and anti-HBs measurements after\nthe chemotherapy were enrolled in the\nstudy. Patients <15 years of age, those\nwho had undergone an allogeneic trans-\nplantation, and those with severe renal and\nliver insufficiency or hepatocellular carcin-\noma were excluded from the study. The\nstudy was approved by the Ondokuz Mayis\nUniversity Clinical Research Ethics\nAs this was a retrospective study that\nanalysed data from the medical records,\nthere was no need for informed patient\nconsent.\nSerum HBV marker data collection\nHepatitis B markers were measured from\nserum samples using an enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the\nresults were obtained from the medical\nrecords. All analyses were performed using\na cobas\u00d5 e 601 analyser (Roche Diagnostics,\nMannheim, Germany) following the manu-\nfacturer's instructions. The minimum\ndetectable concentrations were 2.0 IU/l for\nanti-HBs, 0.8 PEI U/mI for anti-HBc and\n0.1 IU/l for HBsAg. Intra- and interassay\ncoefficients of variation for all ELISAs\nwere <8% and <12%, respectively.\nPost-treatment changes in anti-HBs titres\nand a return to negative titres were evalu-\nated in the different patient subgroups (i.e.\nthose with haematological malignancies,\nsolid tumours, and those that had received\nrituximab-based therapy). As the upper\nlimit for anti-HBs titres was 100 mIU/ml in\nthe laboratory that undertook the analyses,\nthis was accepted as the cut-off level for the\npretreatment value when analysing the post-\ntreatment seronegativity rates in two sub-\ngroups based on this cut-off level. A post-\ntreatment titre of anti-HBs of !10 mIU/ml\nwas defined as positive and a titre of\n<10 mIU/ml was defined as negative.\nThe anti-HBc status of the subgroups was\nalso evaluated with the cut-off level\nof 1 IU/ml being defined as positive\nand > 1 IU/ml being defined as negative.\nThe HBsAg status was also evaluated with\nthe cut-off level of <1 IU/ml being defined as\nnegative and !1 IU/ml being defined as\npositive.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed\nusing the SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version\n21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. The Shapiro\u00adWilk test was used\nto analyse the variables that were normally\ndistributed. Variables that were not nor-\nmally distributed were analysed using the\nWilcoxon signed-rank test and Mann\u00ad\nWhitney U-test. Fisher's exact test was\nused for the evaluation of the categorical\nvariables. The results are presented as the\nmedian (min\u00admax) and n of patients (%). A\nP-value < 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nThis retrospective study examined the med-\npatients with haematological malignancies\nor solid tumours who received immunosup-\npressive anticancer therapy.

Furthermore, the median\nanti-HBs titres decreased significantly after\nrituximab-based therapy (P \u00bc 0.006).

Thirty-six of these patients had\nhaematological malignancies and 17 had\nsolid tumours. Among the haematological\nmalignancies, there were 22 patients with\nacute leukaemia and eight with lymphoma.\nThe most common solid tumours were\ngynaecological and breast cancers.\nOnly three patients with haematological\nmalignancies developed treatment-related\nHBV reactivation and their details are\nlisted in Table 4. In one of the patients, the\nHBV was reactivated after undergoing flu-\ndarabine plus cyclophosphamide treatment.\nThe virus was deactivated following treat-\nment with lamivudine, and the patient is still\nalive. A second patient remained in remis-\nsion regarding her malignant disease, but\nsubsequently died due to fulminant hepatitis\ndespite the administration of antiviral ther-\napy. The third patient had received vincris-\ntine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone\ntherapy for multiple myeloma, but when\nthis progressed, the patient was switched to\nbortezomib and then lenalidomide. Upon\ninitiation of the lenalidomide therapy, HBV\nreactivation occurred, and the lamivudine\ntherapy was continued for another 2 years.\nTenofovir was added to the therapy when\nthe patient developed resistance to lamivu-\ndine. However, the patient ultimately died\ndue to primary disease progression.\nDiscussion\nThe results of the present study suggest that\na low pretreatment level of anti-HBs is a risk\nfactor for becoming negative for anti-HBs,\nparticularly in patients with haematological\nmalignancies who have undergone immuno-\nsuppressive anticancer therapy.

For\nexample, the administration of immunosup-\npressive chemotherapy affects the balance\nbetween the host's immune system and viral\nreplication, thus suppressing normal\nimmunological responses and affecting cel-\nlular and humoral immune responses.19\u00ad21\nMoreover, the function of T lymphocytes\nmay also be suppressed and a deficient\nimmune response to viral antigens may\nlead to reactivation.19 Likewise, immuno-\nsuppressive chemotherapy, particularly\nrituximab-based chemotherapy, may sup-\npress antibody-producing B lymphocytes,\nthereby resulting in a decrease in the pro-\nduction of immunoglobulins and antibodies\nagainst HBV.19,21 Another possible mech-\nanism of HBV reactivation is the withdrawal\nof cytotoxic therapy.5,19 This leads to\nenhanced viral replication that can then\ninduce a rebound immune response (hyper-\nimmune response), which leads to the\nThere are a limited number of studies on\nthe anti-HBs status of patients with resolved\nHBV infections who received immunosup-\nthose studies that do exist, almost all have\nfocused on haematological malignancies,\nparticularly NHL, in patients who received\npatients who received rituximab plus cyclo-\nphosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and\nprednisolone (R-CHOP), and the anti-HBs\nwere negative before treatment in these five\npatients with HBV reactivation.11 In this\nstudy, anti-HBs titres were not considered\nquantitatively.11 Therefore, the absence of\nanti-HBs has been identified as a risk factor\nfor HBV reactivation, in addition to the use\nof rituximab.\nA previous study suggested that anti-HBs\ntitres significantly decreased after rituximab-\nbased therapy in B-cell lymphoma\npatients.22 The authors reported that anti-\nHBs titres were more likely to decline\n(<10 mIU/ml) in patients with pretreatment\nstudy, eight of 19 patients with pretreatment\nanti-HBs titres of <100 mIU/ml became\nnegative for anti-HBs titres, and HBV\nreactivation developed in only one of these\npatients with pretreatment anti-HBs\ntitres > 100 mIU/ml became negative for\nanti-HBs after rituximab-based therapy.22\nThe researchers concluded that a low pre-\ntreatment level of anti-HBs was an inde-\npendent risk factor for the loss of anti-HBs\nand HBV reactivation in patients with\nresolved HBV infection receiving rituxi-\nmab-based therapy.22\nThe impact of chemotherapy on anti-HBs\ntitres was studied in 75 patients with\nresolved HBV infections who had haemato-\nlogical malignancies.23 The study reported\nthat the anti-HBs titres significantly\ndecreased after chemotherapy, especially in\npatients with acute leukaemia, male\npatients, and patients receiving intensive\nchemotherapy.23 The findings of a prospect-\nive study conducted on patients with\nresolved HBV infections undergoing\nrituximab-based therapy, suggested that the\nrate of HBV reactivation was significantly\nhigher in anti-HBs negative patients when\ncompared with anti-HBs positive patients.16\nAnother study reported that although there\nwas an overall decrease in anti-HBs titres,\nnone of the titres of the 43 patients with\nhaematological malignancies who had\nresolved HBV infection became negative.24\nConsistent with these reports, the present\nstudy found that the anti-HBs titres of all\nthe patients were significantly decreased\nafter the therapy compared with before the\nrespectively; P < 0.001). The seronegativity\nrate of the anti-HBs titres post-treatment\nwas significantly higher in the patients with\npretreatment titres of <100 mIU/ml than in\nthose with pretreatment titres of !100 mIU/\nml (P < 0.001). The subgroup analysis of the\npatients revealed that the increase in post-\ntreatment anti-HBs seronegativity was\ngreatest in the group with haematological\nmalignancies. In contrast, it has been\nreported that HBV reactivation may occur\nin patients that are positive for anti-\nHBs.25,26 In a case report, a patient who\nhad received R-CHOP presented with high\ntitre levels that were positive for anti-HBs at\nthe time of a fatal reactivation of HBV.25\nAdditionally, in a prospective study con-\nducted on patients who had received\nimmunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapy,\none patient out of eight that had developed\na reactivation of HBV was positive for anti-\nHBs at the time of the reactivation of the\nissues were associated with mutations in the\nHBsAg coding region (escape mutation).\nVarious studies have reported that the\nrisk of HBV reactivation is increased in\nHBsAg positive patients undergoing cyto-\nOther studies have reported that the prophy-\nlactic use of antiviral agents prior to chemo-\ntherapy in these patients may reduce levels\nof reactivation-related morbidity and\nmortality.30\u00ad32 The clinical data regarding\nresolved HBV infection rates are insufficient.\nIn a French study that included both haem-\natological malignancies and solid tumours,\nHBV reactivation occurred in seven of 84\nHBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive\npatients, none of whom had solid tumours.33\nConsistent with the findings of that study,\nthe present data demonstrated that the\npatients with solid tumours who were\nHBsAg negative, regardless of their anti-\nHBs and anti-HBc status, did not have a\nhigh risk of HBV reactivation.\nIn the present study, HBV reactivation\noccurred in three patients, and all three had\nhaematological malignancies; chronic\nlymphocytic leukaemia, acute myeloblastic\nleukaemia-promyelocytic leukaemia, and\nmultiple myeloma. HBV reactivation did\nnot occur in any of the 22 patients that were\nadministered rituximab-based therapy or in\nany of the 126 patients with solid tumours.\nTwo patients had pretreatment anti-HBs of\n<100 mIU/ml, and one patient had a value\n!100 mIU/ml. Two of these three patients\nwere anti-HBc positive after the chemother-\napy treatment, and one patient who had been\nanti-HBc positive prior to chemotherapy was\nnegative after the treatment. One of the\npatients who had been HBsAg negative\nbefore the treatment was still negative after\nthe treatment, whereas the other two patients\nwere positive after the treatment. Despite the\nprompt treatment of all three patients, one of\nthem died while the other two patients\nrecovered in terms of HBV reactivation.\nAccording to the literature, the risk of reacti-\npresent study, two of the three patients with\nHBV reactivation were women.\nIn accordance with the current litera-\nchemotherapy decreased anti-HBs titres,\nparticularly in those patients with haemato-\nlogical malignancies and those that had\nreceived rituximab-based chemotherapy.\nThe present study investigated the\npost-chemotherapy changes in anti-HBs\ntitres not only in patients that had recovered\nfrom a previous HBV infection but also in\nthose that had acquired anti-HBs seroposi-\ntivity through vaccination. The present data\nshow that chemotherapy results in a\ndecrease in anti-HBs titres but that it\nincreases the risk of reactivation in patients\nwith haematological malignancies, espe-\ncially those with pretreatment anti-HBs of\n<100 mIU/ml. Furthermore, the chemother-\napy-induced decline in anti-HBs titres was\nmore significant in the patients with resolved\nhepatitis B infections (i.e. anti-HBc positive\npatients) compared with that of the vacci-\nnated patients (i.e. anti-HBc negative\npatients). These findings might be explained\nby possible pathophysiological differences\nbetween vaccination-induced versus HBV\ninfection-related immunity.\nThis present study had a number of\nstrengths and limitations. It included a\nlarge number of patients, demonstrated the\neffects of chemotherapy on anti-HBs titres in\nsolid and haematological malignancies, and\nevaluated the changes in antibody positivity\ndue to HBV vaccination and resolved HBV\ninfection. However, the limitations included\nthe retrospective nature of the study, the\nabsence of HBV DNA data in some\ninstances, and the heterogeneity of the\nchemotherapy regimens used to treat the\nmalignancies.\nIn conclusion, consistent with the current\nthe present study suggest that pretreatment\nlow-level positivity of anti-HBs is a risk\nfactor for becoming negative for anti-HBs,\nparticularly in patients with haematological\nmalignancies who have undergone immuno-\nsuppressive anticancer therapy. Moreover,\nhigh levels of anti-HBs may have a protect-\nive effect against the reactivation of HBV.\nWhen making a decision about prophylactic\nantiviral therapy, the patient's anti-HBs\nstatus and anti-HBs titre, together with\ntheir HBsAg and anti-HBc levels, should\nbe considered, particularly in high-risk\npatients such as HBV carriers, those who\nhave occult or resolved HBV infection and\npatients receiving immunosuppressive antic-\nancer therapy. However, further prospective\ntrials are needed to clarify this issue.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
