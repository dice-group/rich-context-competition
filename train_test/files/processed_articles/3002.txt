Kotchen, MD\nBackground: The impact of diet on blood pressure and\nthe age-related changes in blood pressure have been dif-\nficult to detect within one population. We designed this\nanalysis to study the association of major dietary factors\nwith blood pressure and with age-related changes in blood\npressure in a representative sample of the US population.\nMethods: Data were obtained on all individuals 20 years\nor older (n=17030) surveyed in the Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), includ-\ning demographic data, anthropometric data, dietary in-\ntake (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, protein,\nalcohol, and total energy) based on 24-hour recall, and\nblood pressure. Multivariate models relating diet to blood\npressure were constructed using stepwise regression, best\nsubset regression, and multiple regression.\nResults: Systolic blood pressure was positively associ-\nated with higher sodium, alcohol, and protein intakes\n(P.05) and negatively associated with potassium in-\ntake (P=.003). Diastolic blood pressure was negatively\nassociated with potassium and alcohol intakes (P.001).\nPulse pressure was positively associated with sodium, pro-\ntein, and alcohol intakes (P.001). A higher intake of\ncalcium (P=.01) was associated with a lower rate of rise\nin systolic blood pressure with age.\nConclusion: A diet low in sodium, alcohol, and protein\nis associated with lower systolic blood and pulse pres-\nsure. Potassium intake was associated with lower systolic\nand diastolic blood pressure, whereas alcohol intake\nwas associated with lower diastolic blood pressure. In ad-\ndition, the age-related changes in systolic blood pressure\nwere attenuated by higher calcium and protein intakes.\nMagnesium was not associated with any changes in blood\npressure.\nRESULTS OF the recently re-\nported Dietary Approaches\nto Stop Hypertension\n(DASH) trial document the\neffects of overall dietary\npatterns on blood pressure levels.1 Al-\nthough many specific dietary factors have\nbeen linked with changes in blood pres-\nsure, relatively strong evidence exists for\nonly a few of them. Higher blood pres-\nsure levels have been associated with high\nintakes of alcohol, sodium, and protein and\nlow intakes of potassium, calcium, and\nmagnesium.2-11 The effects of these nutri-\nents on blood pressure are more appar-\nent in studies among several popula-\ntions, as it is difficult to consistently detect\nthe impact of specific dietary factors on\nblood pressure or age-related changes in\nblood pressure within one population. For\nexample, although a relationship be-\ntween sodium consumption and blood\npressure has been demonstrated in across-\npopulation studies, at the time this ar-\nticle was written, this was not the case in\nwithin-population studies. An analysis of\nthe first National Health and Nutrition Ex-\namination Survey (NHANES I) data con-\ncluded that a high sodium intake was as-\nsociated with lower blood pressure.4 The\ndifficulty of accurately measuring nutri-\nent intakes and their limited range within\na single population contribute to the dif-\nficulty of assessing the relationship be-\ntween specific dietary factors and blood\nMoreover, few studies have in-\ncluded methodological approaches to ad-\njust for the effect of the high correlation\nandinteractionamongdifferentdietary fac-\ntors.13 These studies have usually as-\nsessed the association of isolated dietary\nfactors with blood pressure rather than as-\nsessing multiple factors taken together.14\nWe designed this analysis of NHANES III\nto study the associations between the\nmajor dietary factors and systolic (SBP)\nand diastolic (DBP) blood pressure and\npulse pressure (PP), as well as age-related\nchanges in blood pressure.\nFrom the Division of Geriatrics,\nDepartment of Medicine,\nUniversity of South\nCarolina/Palmetto Health\nAlliance, Columbia\n(Dr Hajjar), and the\nDepartments of Medicine\n(Drs Grim and Kotchen) and\nBiostatistics (Dr George),\nMedical College of Wisconsin,\nMilwaukee.\n\u00a92001 American Medical Association.

The ethnic breakdown was 42%\nother. The mean\u00b1SD BMI (calculated as weight in kilo-\ngrams divided by the square of height in meters) of the\nsample was 27.1\u00b10.2. The dietary intake of sodium in\nthe overall sample was high, whereas the daily potas-\nsium, calcium, and magnesium intakes were low in re-\nlation to the recommended dietary guidelines.24,25 Afri-\ncan Americans consumed more sodium than the other\nethnic groups, but less potassium, calcium, and magne-\nsium (P.001 for each dietary factor). Consumption of\nall dietary factors was higher in men than in women\nThere was a linear association between age and SBP\nand a curvilinear association between age and both DBP\nand PP (P.001 for all 3 associations) (Figure 1). In\nthe univariate analysis, after adjustments for age, sex, eth-\nnicity, and BMI, SBP was positively associated with the\nsodium-potassium ratio (P.001), alcohol consump-\nand negatively associated with potassium intake (P.001).\nSystolic blood pressure was not associated with the so-\ndium, magnesium, calcium, or protein intake. Diastolic\nblood pressure was negatively associated with calcium\nintake (P.001) and positively associated with alcohol\nconsumption (P.001). No other associations were de-\ntected, including total energy consumption. Pulse pres-\nsure was negatively associated with magnesium intake\n(P.001) and positively associated with alcohol con-\nsumption (P.001); no other associations were found.\nWhen the standardized daily intake per kilocalorie\nwas used to measure the dietary factors, different asso-\nciations were found. Lower SBP and DBP were associ-\nated with higher daily intakes of calcium, magnesium,\nand potassium per kilocalorie, whereas higher SBP and\nDBP were associated with a higher intake of alcohol per\nkilocalorie (P.001 for each association) (Table 2).\nIn the multivariate analysis, higher SBP was asso-\nciated with a higher daily intake of sodium, protein, and\ncohol) (Table 2). The associations of alcohol and pro-\ntein intake with SBP were less prominent in women than\nwomen). Calcium potentiated the effect of protein on SBP\n(P=.03; VIF, 9.4), while potassium blunted that effect\nated with a higher potassium intake (P=.003). Systolic\nblood pressure was not associated with any other di-\netary factors. In the final multivariate model for DBP, lower\nDBP was only associated with the higher consumption\nof potassium and alcohol (P.001 for both). In the final\nmultivariate model for PP, higher PP was associated with\nhigher sodium, protein, and alcohol intake (P<.001 for\nall 3) but not potassium, magnesium, or calcium intake\n(Table 2). The association between alcohol and PP was\nintake was associated with an attenuated rate of rise in\nMETHODS\nThe NHANES III is a stratified multistage probabil-\nity sample of the US population. The sampling meth-\nods and the survey protocols have been previously\ndescribed.15 Dietary information was obtained via a\n24-hour recall questionnaire, and standardized blood\npressure and anthropometric measurements were\ntaken by a trained observer. Of the 39695 partici-\npants in NHANES III, our analysis included only those\nOur data set included demographic informa-\ntion (age, sex, and ethnicity), anthropometric infor-\nmation (weight, height, and body mass index [BMI],\nas reported in the survey), and blood pressure (the\nmean of 3 readings of SBP and DBP). We selected di-\netary factors commonly thought to be associated with\nblood pressure, including sodium, potassium, cal-\ncium, magnesium, protein, alcohol, and total en-\nergy consumed per day. We excluded the other mac-\nronutrients (fat and carbohydrates) because they\nlacked evidence suggesting an association. Pulse pres-\nsure was calculated by subtracting the DBP from the\nSBP for each participant.\nIntakes of the different dietary factors evaluated\nwere highly correlated with each other. A conse-\nquence of this intercorrelation (or multicollinearity)\namong dietary factors was the inability to attribute an\nindependenteffectofanysinglenutrientonbloodpres-\nsure.16,17 Standardization of individual dietary factors\nusing density measures (either as an energy ratio ob-\ntained by dividing the amount consumed by total en-\nergy per day or a mass ratio obtained by dividing the\namount consumed by the BMI of each participant) de-\ncreased this degree of intercorrelation. We elected to\nuse the density measure for our statistical analysis.\nUnivariate and multivariate analyses relating con-\nsumption of dietary factors to blood pressure were\nperformed. For the univariate analysis, weighted lin-\near and polynomial regression models were used.18\nAdjustments were made for demographic variables\nand BMI. To develop the multivariate model, a ran-\ndom subsample (n=8529) was selected from the to-\ntal sample and used to choose the best set of vari-\nables to be included in the final models. These\nvariables included the demographic variables, BMI,\ndietary factors using density measures, and dietary\nfactor interaction variables. Standard stepwise re-\nused to select these variables. A principal compo-\nnent analysis was also performed.16,17 These meth-\nods minimize the effect of intercorrelation on the\nmodel developed.17 The model was then tested on the\nremainder subsample (n=8501) using a multiple-\nweighted regression model.18 The variable inflation\nfactor (VIF) was also calculated for each variable to\nmeasure the effect of intercorrelation in the final\nof intercorrelation and, hence, more reliable re-\nsults.17 The final model developed was applied to the\nware (Minitab Inc, State College, Pa) was used for\nstatistical analysis.\n\u00a92001 American Medical Association.

Age alone contributed\nabout 35.3% and diet about 2% of the SBP variability.\nAbout 6% of the DBP variability was explained by age\nand 3% by diet, whereas about 39% of the PP variability\nwas explained by age and 2% by diet.\nCOMMENT\nThe statistical approach of this analysis, specifically, the\nmultistep multivariate analysis and the standardization to\nthe individual's total energy intake, led to more valid re-\nsults than those previously reported, and the models in\nthis analysis were more stable. Consistent with previous\nresults in other populations,13 we found a high degree of\nmulticollinearity among the different dietary factors evalu-\nated in NHANES III. Our approach was able to detect and\ncorrect for this prevalent but unnoticed phenomenon of\nmulticollinearity. By including multiple factors together,\nevaluating their interactions, and adjusting for their high\ndegree of interdependence, we were able to develop mod-\nels that allowed us to detect specific associations between\ndietary factors and blood pressure in addition to identi-\nfying patterns of dietary associations with blood pres-\nsure. In particular, we were able to study the impact of diet\non age-related changes in blood pressure by including age\nand diet interaction measures in our models.\nOur analysis of NHANES III documents that higher\nsodium, protein, and alcohol intakes are associated with\nhigher SBP and PP. These associations with sodium and\nprotein intake were apparent only in the multivariate\nmodel, whereas the associations of alcohol intake with\nSBP and PP were observed in both the univariate and mul-\ntivariate models. Our finding of an association between\nsodium intake and SBP is in accordance with animal mod-\nels, across-population surveys, and intervention tri-\nthe association between protein intake and SBP,30-32 while\nour analysis demonstrates a positive association. This as-\nsociation is blunted by a higher potassium intake and mag-\nnified by a higher calcium intake. Our analysis also adds\nevidence for a positive association between alcohol in-\nin the univariate analysis, highlighting the importance\nof adjusting for covariates. The associations of higher PP\nand lower DBP with higher alcohol intake have not been\ndescribed previously. Furthermore, our analysis sug-\ngests that the associations between alcohol intake and SBP\nTable 1.

Simi-\nlarly, the Belgian Interuniversity study showed that al-\ncohol consumption is associated with higher SBP only\nserved that higher potassium consumption was associ-\nated with lower SBP and DBP. Our study shows the im-\nportance of potassium intake for blood pressure levels\nin the population.\nUntil the present study, no relationship between di-\netary factors and PP has been reported.

Higher calcium and pro-\ntein intakes attenuated the age-related rise in SBP, whereas\nhigher sodium, alcohol, and protein intakes increased the\nrate of the age-related change in DBP. These observa-\ntions remain to be confirmed using longitudinal data.\nConsistent with previous studies,11,37 blood pres-\nsure and dietary factors in our sample were associated\nTable 2.

Despite this smaller effect, the impact of diet\nin the general population is significant, since smallchanges\nin blood pressure in a large population would have a sig-\nnificant effect. In addition, this magnitude of the effect\nof specific nutrients on blood pressure within the gen-\neral population is not dissimilar from results of clinical\nIn summary, this is one of the largest analyses to in-\nvestigate the association of diet and blood pressure within\na population, especially within older age groups. The re-\nsults have important clinical and public health implica-\ntions. Since dietary habits are potentially modifiable, the\nmanipulation of diet could have a significant impact not\nonly on blood pressure levels but also on the rise in blood\npressure with age. More specifically, our results suggest\nthat a diet low in sodium, protein, and alcohol and rich\nin potassium and calcium would affect the blood pres-\nsure levels in the general population, including PP. Fur-\nthermore, our study shows that, since the impact of an\nindividual nutrient on blood pressure is modified by the\nintake of other nutrients, it is important to assess the over-\nall diet rather than any single nutrient in isolation when\nmeasuring the impact of diet on blood pressure.\nCorresponding author: Ihab M.
