Supine hypertension (SH)\nis defined as systolic blood pressure ! 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ! 90 mmHg.\nSubjects were assigned to either the SH group (1275 cases) or the non-SH group (1169 cases).\nResults: The levels of ALBU, baPWV, and IMT, as well as the percentage of participants with\nALBU > 30 mg/L, baPWV ! 1400 cm/s, and IMT ! 1 mm, were significantly higher in the SH group\nthan in the non-SH group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that SH was an\nindependent risk factor for baPWV and IMT, but the relationship with ALBU was not statistically\nsignificant after correction for confounding factors.\nConclusions: SH is a risk factor for target organ damage, as expressed by the indices baPWV and\nIMT. The association of SH with kidney damage requires further study.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/imr\n1Sixth Hospital of Peking University, Beijing, China\n2North China University of Science and Technology,\nTangshan, China\n3Renal Division, Department of Medicine, Peking\nUniversity First Hospital, Peking University Institute of\nNephrology, Beijing, China\n4Medical Informatics Center, Peking University, Beijing,\nChina\n5Cardiology Department of Hebei United University,\nAffiliated Kailuan General Hospital, Tangshan, China\nCorresponding authors:\nJing Wang, Medical Informatics Center, Peking University,\nUnited University, Affiliated Kailuan General Hospital,\nRegistration URL: http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.\nsagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

The same group of employees under-\nmedical staff as at the first examination, at\nthe same locations, and with the same time\nsequence, questionnaire, and anthropomet-\nric and biochemical analysis methods as in\nthe first health examination.\nDuring the third health examination,\nretired employees of Kailuan Group\n( ! 60 years old) who underwent their exam-\ninations at Kailuan General Hospital,\nKailuan Linxi Hospital, or Kailuan\nZhaogezhuang Hospital were selected as\nstudy candidates by cluster sampling, with\n25% of the population being selected at\nrandom. The study subjects underwent\nphysical examinations and, with their\nconsent, rescheduled a new appointment\n(the third \u00fe health examination) for blood\npressure measurement in different positions,\nultrasound examination of cervical blood\nvessels, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure\nmonitoring, pulse wave velocity examin-\nation, and urinary microprotein detection.\nThe study was approved by the ethics com-\nmittees of Kailuan Group Hospital.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria: 1. retired workers ! 60\nyears of age who underwent their health\nexaminations at the Kailuan General\nHospital, Kailuan Linxi Hospital, or\nKailuan Zhaogezhuang Hospital; 2. subjects\nwithout severe disabilities who could stand\nand walk in examinations by themselves; 3.\nsubjects without defects in cognitive ability\nwho could complete the questionnaire;\nand 4. subjects who agreed to participate\nin the study and provided signed informed\nconsent.\nExclusion criteria: 1. valvular heart dis-\nease or cardiomyopathy; 2. frequent prema-\nture beats (all types of beats > 6 times/min);\n3. atrial fibrillation, or atrioventricular\nor intraventricular conduction block; and\n4. exposure to antipsychotic drugs, anti-\nParkinson drugs, antidepressants, or seda-\ntive drugs within the previous 2 weeks.\nData collection\nThe content of the epidemiological survey,\nanthropometric indicators, and biochemical\ntesting methods used in the current study can\nbe found in our previous study.16 Smoking\nwas defined as at least one cigarette per day\non average for at least 1 year; drinking was\ndefined as drinking at least 100 mL of liquor\n(>50% alcohol content) per day on average\nfor at least 1 year; and exercise was defined as\naerobic activities (e.g., walking, jogging, ball\ngames, swimming) at least three times a week\nfor at least 30 minutes.\nSitting and supine blood pressure\nmeasurements\nDuring the third \u00fe health examination,\nblood pressure was measured after subjects\nhad been sitting calmly for 15 min and had\nrefrained from smoking or consuming tea or\ncoffee for 30 min before measurement.\nA calibrated mercury sphygmomanometer\n(Yuwell, Yuyue, Jiangsu, China) was used to\nmeasure blood pressure in the right brachial\nartery, with systolic SBP readings taken at\nthe first and DBP readings at the fifth\nKorotkoff sound. Blood pressure was mea-\nsured three consecutive times at intervals of\n1\u00ad2 min, and the average value was\nrecorded. Subjects were then asked to\nadopt the supine position, and the right\nbrachial pressure was measured by trained\nand certified observers after 5 min. Blood\npressure measurements were obtained\naccording to a standard protocol recom-\nmended by the American Heart\nAssociation.29 The diagnostic criteria for\nsitting hypertension were SBP ! 140 mmHg\nand/or DBP! 90 mmHg, a history of hyper-\ntension, or a diagnosis of hypertension and\nthe taking of related medication. The diag-\nnostic criteria for SH were SBP ! 140 mmHg\nand/or DBP ! 90 mmHg.\nLaboratory testing\nOn the morning of the third examination,\nafter fasting for 8 h, 5 mL of venous blood\nwas collected from each subject into a\nvacuum tube and centrifuged at 3000 g for\nupper serum collected for measurement\nwithin 4 h. Clinical laboratories measured\nserum creatinine levels by the colourimetric\nmethod using a liquid double dosage form\ncreatinine assay kit manufactured by\nBeikong Biotechnology Co., Ltd (produc-\ncoefficient < 5%; Changping, China).\nAnalysis of other biochemical parameters,\nincluding fasting blood glucose (FBG), low-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),\nand high-sensitivity C-reactive protein\n(hsCRP), was conducted on a Hitachi auto-\nmatic analyser (7600 Automatic Analyzer;\nHitachi, Tokyo, Japan). From the\nthird \u00fe physical examination onwards,\nALBU was measured using the Uppergold\nU2 quantitative reader manufactured by\n(Shanghai Upper Bio-Tech Pharmaceutical\nCo. Ltd., Shanghai, China). In this study,\nincreased ALBU was defined as\nBrachial\u00adankle pulse wave velocity\nFrom the third \u00fe physical examination\nonwards, baPWV was measured using a BP-\ndevice (Omron Healthcare Co. Ltd, Tokyo,\nJapan). The data were read directly via net-\nwork connections. The examination room\ntemperature was maintained in the range\n22\u00ad25 C. The participant was requested not\nto smoke prior to the examination and had\nrested for at least 5 min. The pillow was\nremoved to ensure a supine posture, with\npalms facing up and placed at the sides of the\nbody. Sphygmomanometer cuffs were\nwrapped around the upper arms and the\nlower ankles. The label of the upper arm cuff\nwas alignedwith the brachial arteries, with the\nlower edge of the cuff 2\u00ad3 cm from the cubital\nfossa strips. The label of the lower limb cuff\nwas positioned on the medial side of the leg,\nwiththeloweredgeof the cuff 1\u00ad2 cmfrom the\nmalleolus. A phonocardiography transducer\nwas placed over the precordium.\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes were\nclipped to the left and the right wrists. Two\nmeasurementsweretakenperparticipant,and\nthe second measurement was used as the final\nresult. This study used the greater of the\nbaPWV values of the left and right sides for\nCarotid artery intima\u00admedia thickness\nFrom the third \u00fe physical examination\nonwards, test participants were examined by\nphysicians with more than 5 years of clinical\nexperience in ultrasonography and who had\nundergone the standard training. A Philips\nHD-15 colour ultrasound diagnostic\napparatus (Koninklijke Philips Electronics,\nAmsterdam, Netherlands) with a 5\u00ad12MHz\nhigh-frequency probe was used for the\nmeasurement. The test participant assumed\nthe supine position with the head turned\ntoward the contralateral side from the exam-\nination. In the 1\u00ad2 cm segment at the end of\nthe left and the right common carotid artery,\nIMT was measured in the longitudinal section\nof the rear wall (to avoid plaque). One person\noperated the apparatus and the other rec-\norded the results. After the two physicians\nhad confirmed their observations, detailed\nresults were recorded. In accordance with the\nmethod of Hedblad et al.,19 the larger of the\nvalues for the left and the right common\ncarotid artery was used for analyses. A\ncommon carotid IMT ! 1.00mm was defined\nas an increase in IMT.\nStatistical analyses\nThe annual physical examination data from\n2011 were obtained from the hospitals that\nperformed the examinations. These data were\nuploaded via network to the Kailuan General\nHospital server room and stored in an Oracle\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for\nthe statistical analyses. Normally distributed\ndata were expressed as mean\u00c6 standard\ndeviation. The t-test was used to compare\ndata between two groups. Measurement data\nthat formed a skewed distribution were\nanalysed by t-test after logarithmic conver-\nsion. Count data were presented as n (%) and\ndifferences between groups were evaluated\nusing the 2 test. Rank-correlation analysis\nwas used to test for correlations between SBP\nand ALBU, baPWV, and IMT. Multivariate\nlogistic regression was used to analyse the\ninfluence of SH on ALBU, baPWV, and\nIMT. P < 0.05 (bilateral) was considered\nstatistically significant throughout.\nResults\nyears, and retired), accounting for 52.67%\nof total retirees aged ! 60 years who had\nthree physical examinations in Kailuan\nGroup, underwent physical examinations\nat the three aforementioned hospitals.

Nonconditional logistic\nregression analysis was carried out to deter-\nmine the effect of SH on ALBU, baPWV,\nand IMT. The results indicated that SH was\na risk factor for ALBU, baPWV, and\nincreased IMT. Model 2 was based on\nModel 1, with corrections for age and sex\n(male/female). The results showed that SH\nwas a risk factor for ALBU, baPWV, and\nincreased IMT. Model 3 was based on\nModel 2, with corrections for sitting SBP,\nsitting DBP, supine heart rate, BMI, FBG,\nLDL-C, TG, hsCRP, smoking, alcohol con-\nsumption, exercise, and use of antihyperten-\nsive medications. The findings indicated that\nSH was a risk factor for baPWV and\nincreased IMT (P < 0.05), but the correlation\nbetween SH and ALBU after correction for\nassociated factors was not statistically sig-\nnificant. The odds ratios (OR) were 5.15\nively (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nWe demonstrated an association between\nSH and the indices of target organ damage\nALBU, baPWV, and IMT in a large sample\nof subjects aged over 60 years. During\nthe measurement of supine blood pressure,\nindividuals are relatively relaxed, which\nmay largely reflect real blood pressures.\nIn addition, the reduced venous return and\nrelatively stable hormone levels observed in\nvivo in the supine position can lead to more\naccurate blood pressure measurements.30\nGarland et al.14 studied 65 cases of elderly\npatients with autonomic failure and found\nTable 4.

Univariate regression analysis was carried out. Model 2 was based on Model 1, with correction for age\nand sex. Model 3 was based on Model 2, with correction for sitting SBP (<140 mmHg assigned 0, ! 140 mmHg assigned 1),\n(<2 mg/L assigned 0, ! 2 mg/L assigned 1), smoking (No/Yes), alcohol consumption (No/Yes), exercise (No/Yes), and use of\nantihypertensive medication (No/Yes).\nthat SH was related to reduced glomerular\nuntreated hypertension patients, among\nwhom the number with left ventricular\nhypertrophy was three times greater in the\nnighttime SH group than in the group with\nnormal nighttime blood pressure. However,\nthese studies of the relationship between SH\nand target organ damage involved relatively\nsmall populations.\nIn the present study, the occurrence rate\nof target organ damage and the average\nvalues of ALBU, baPWV, and IMT were\nhigher in the SH group than in the non-SH\ngroup, while supine SBP was positively\ncorrelated with ALBU, baPWV, and IMT.\nTo date, most studies have focused on\nnighttime blood pressure in 24-h ambula-\ntory blood pressure monitoring in relation\nsupine blood pressure affecting target organ\ndamage has been largely overlooked.\nCuspidi et al.20 found evidence that night-\ntime supine SBP in 343 hypertensive patients\nwas positively correlated with IMT\na positive linear correlation between night-\nP < 0.01) in elderly hypertensive patients.\nThese results confirmed the strong correl-\nation between supine SBP and target organ\ndamage.\nIn addition, in the present study, multi-\nvariate logistic regression analysis showed\nthat SH was a risk factor for target organ\ndamage, as reflected by various indices.\nSharabi et al.22 observed that, in patients\nwith autonomic failure, SH increased the\nrisk of chronic renal failure, while de la\nSierra et al.23 reported that nighttime SH\nwas a risk factor for positive urinary protein\nof untreated hypertensive patients and\nfound that patients in the SH group had a\nhigher average carotid\u00adfemoral pulse wave\nvelocity (cfPWV) value and greater IMT\ncompared with patients in the non-SH group\nstudied 319 hypertensive patients and found\nthat nighttime SH was strongly associated\nwith target organ damage (cfPWV, IMT,\nand left ventricular hypertrophy). These\nresults suggest that SH and target organ\ndamage are closely related. Our study dem-\nonstrates that SH is closely associated with\nvascular function and structural changes,\nalthough the relationship between SH and\nrenal damage remains to be further studied.\nOther studies have indicated that SH is a\nrisk factor for kidney damage, left ventricu-\nlar hypertrophy, and other target organ\nhealthy individuals over 10.8 years old and\nfound that nighttime supine blood pressure\nwas a better predictor of cardiovascular dis-\nease mortality than daytime blood pressure.\nOur study has added to the evidence that\nSH has a relationship with the risk for target\norgan damage, given that sitting hyperten-\nsion has previously been shown to be a risk\nfactor for target organ damage. With an\naging population and increased incidence of\nstroke in China,31 our results can be used for\nevaluating the health of patients lying in\nbed. Because of the cross-sectional design of\nour study, we could not establish a causal\nrelationship between SH and target organ\ndamage. However, based on previous stu-\ndies, we can infer that as supine blood\npressure increases, hormone levels also\nchange.27 Hence, the sympathetic nervous\nsystem is stimulated, which leads to elevated\nlevels of vasoconstrictor substances such as\ncatecholamines, and vascular resistance\nincreases in turn.14 Consequently, glomerular\nperfusion decreases, renal dysfunction is\naggravated, and the resulting abnormal leak-\nage of protein may result in increased ALBU.\nFurthermore, SH often occurs in patients\nwith autonomic failure.3,14 Previous stu-\ndies14 showed that, in these patients, the\ntension of the postganglionic sympathetic\nnerve increases, the regulatory function of\nthe pressure sensor decreases significantly,\nand the arterial structure could also change.\nChanges in arterial structure are often pre-\nsented as an increase in the wall-to-lumen\nratio. Atrial wall thickening results in\nincreased arterial stiffness, which can lead\nto increased baPWV and IMT. The inverse\nrelationship should also be considered.\nALBU is an independent risk factor for\nvascular damage,28 and an increase in\nALBU leads to increased arterial stiffness.\nIncreases in baPWV and IMT also suggest\nincreased arterial stiffness. As arterial stiff-\nness increases, the regulatory function of the\npressure sensors inside the artery wall will\nbe affected, which in turn increases supine\nblood pressure.\nLimitations\nThis study has some limitations. First, it was\na cross-sectional study, so it could not\nestablish a causal relationship between SH\nand target organ damage. However, very\nfew previous studies have investigated the\nassociation between supine blood pressure\nand target organ damage in a large sample\nof the late middle-aged population. Second,\nour participants were predominantly male,\nwhich might have had an impact on our\nresults. In addition, our results apply only to\nsubjects over 60 years old. Further investi-\ngation will be required to determine whether\nour results can be extended to other popu-\nlation groups. Nevertheless, this study is\ninstructive with respect to blood pressure\nmanagement and the prevention of subclin-\nical target organ damage in subjects over\nConclusions\nOur study demonstrates that SH is a risk\nfactor for target organ damage, as deter-\nmined by the indices baPWV and IMT, in\nsubjects over 60 years old. The association\nof SH with ALBU and kidney damage\nrequires further study. While adding to our\nknowledge of the relationship between\nblood pressure and target organ damage,\nthe study also underlines the importance of\nsupine blood pressure in evaluating and\npossibly reducing subclinical target organ\ndamage. However, further studies will be\nrequired to confirm the replicability of our\nresults and to determine whether they can be\nextrapolated to a wider population.\n"
