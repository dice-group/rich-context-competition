Furthermore, the microbial func-\ntions of our gut may also have significant influence on\nmore profound disorders, such as autism (Mayer et\nal.,\n2014). Since much of the research is found in the biological\nand medical literature, published work can prove to be\nquite cumbersome to digest and apply for those trained in\nthe behavioral sciences. The purpose of this article can be\ndescribed in three parts. One, regardless of training or theo-\nretical orientation, the information provided here will hope-\nfully inform all mental health practitioners that a previously\nuntapped domain may better assist in understanding and\ntreating patients. Second, some general information per-\ntaining to gut health is provided. Along with this informa-\ntion, it must be understood that individual dietary treatments\nare best provided by professionals who are adequately\ntrained in such areas. Third, since most of the literature in\nthis area can feel quite foreign and overwhelming for clini-\ncians, this topic will be succinctly broached from a stance\nthat is more user-friendly to clinicians not directly trained\nin biology or medicine.\nThe conventional practice in therapy has been to focus on\nthe more established variables known to underlie mental\nhealth--childhood experiences, relationships with significant\nothers, our individual history of learning, and nervous system\nfunctioning.The process of psychotherapy most often focuses\non two aspects. From a psychological approach, we work\nwith clients through listening, reflecting, acknowledging\nThe third tier in treatment: Attending\nto the growing connection between gut\nhealth and emotional well-being\nJoseph Verdino\n Keywords\ngastrointestinal microbiome, mental health, microbiota, probiotics, psychotherapy\nKingsborough Community College, USA\nCorresponding author:\nJoseph Verdino, Department of Behavioral Sciences and Human\nServices, Kingsborough Community College, 2001 Oriental Boulevard,\nEmail: joseph.verdino@kbcc.cuny.edu\nTheoretical Contribution/Commentary\n2 Health Psychology Open \ninsights, trying to address their past and understand current\nthoughts and behaviors. Although the work of therapy can\nvary greatly based on the theoretical orientation of the thera-\npist, all can be viewed as a form of \"talk therapy,\" where vari-\nous aspects of the psychological domain are understood as the\ncause for distress. It is this traditional focus on behavioral and\npsychological variables that can be understood as the first tier\nin treatment.\nThe second area that is often addressed in mental health\ncomes from biology and the medical sciences. Psychiatrists\nhave provided us invaluable science and medication to\nunderstand and assist patients who are in need of treatment.\nThe strength of the medical world is so great--that the notion\nof chemical connections in the brain--and its relation to a\npatient's emotional state and behavior is often addressed\neven by practitioners who are not specifically trained in med-\nicine. Antidepressants, anxiolytic medication, and other\npowerful psychotropic medications are widely accepted by\npractitioners, patients, and the public as an important factor\nin treatment. Building on the traditional aspects of therapy\naforementioned, use of psychotropic intervention would be\nconsidered the second tier in the healing process.\nHowever, in addition to the psychological and neuro-\nchemical variables that contribute to our emotional state\nand behavior, there is mounting evidence that the state of\nour digestive system--our gut--may be a key factor sig-\nnificantly influencing our mental health (Cryan and Dinan,\ndomain is providing powerful indications that a new piece\nof the puzzle must be added as the third tier toward a more\ncomprehensive understanding and treatment of patients.\nA bit of biology\nOur body is not uniquely human. It is estimated that the\nnumber of uniquely human cells in one person ranges from\ntrillion cells (Bianconi etal.,\ntrillion \"foreign\" cells reside in and\nCollectively, these organisms, predominantly classified as\nbacteria and largely residing in our gut, are referred to as a\nmicrobiome (DeSalle and Perkins, 2015). By definition, a\nmicrobiome is the entirety of microscopic organisms and\ntheir genetic material that inhabit a particular environment\n(Lynch and Pedersen, 2016). Rather than comparing the\nnumber of human versus non-human cells in and on a per-\nson, differences in genetic material may be compared.\nHumans have an estimated 20,000 different genes. This\npales in comparison with the additional eight million differ-\nent genes that comprise our microbiome (National Institutes\nof Health (NIH), 2012). Thus, we are harboring within us\nover 360 times more genetic material than is our own.\nThe organisms of our microbiome, having co-evolved\nwith us for millennia, interact with our body in intricate and\nbalanced ways, to powerfully assist and influence our met-\nabolic, immune, behavioral, and numerous other functions\n(DeSalle and Perkins, 2015). In turn, we provide them a\nhome to survive, reproduce, and evolve. The relationship\nbetween \"us\" and \"them\" is predominantly balanced, pro-\nviding countless commensal and mutualistic exchanges\n(Wang and Kasper, 2014). Health problems arise when dys-\nbiosis, an unhealthy imbalance of such bacteria, occurs.\nIllnesses, a course of antibiotics, a change in location, poor\ndiet, and various other factors can cause the natural state of\nour microbiome to become imbalanced (Collen, 2015).\nAlthough dysbiosis can be corrected over time, research\nsuggests that chronic states of dysbiosis may be a key factor\nleading to many serious ailments, including obesity, aller-\ngies, psychiatric, and behavioral problems (Chutkan, 2015;\nPutting our microbiome aside for a moment, how does\ncommunication between two seemingly separate parts of\nthe body occur? The vagus nerve is the main communica-\ntion link between the brain and the gut. What is most\ninteresting, even when the vagus nerve is severed, and the\nlink is broken, the gut continues to function. This is due to\nthe fact the human gut is the only organ that has a nervous\nsystem that is functionally separate from the autonomic\nnervous system. Biologically classified as the enteric\nnervous system (ENS), consisting of nearly 100\nmillion\nneuronal connections, and the ability to function indepen-\ndently, it is often referred to as the second brain (Carpenter,\n2012). Adding the trillions of actions and interactions of\nthe gut bacteria back into the communication network,\nevidence is supporting the existence of a powerful and\nthree-factor link known as the microbiota\u00adgut\u00adbrain axis,\nworking in complex ways to affect a host of behaviors,\nemotional experiences, and disease (Cryan and O'Mahony,\nal.,\nmicrobiota\u00adgut\u00adbrain axis is in the production and use of\nserotonin, a neurotransmitter whose imbalance is strongly\ncorrelated with depression. Although serotonin is com-\nmonly associated with location in the central nervous sys-\ntem (CNS), it is found not only in the brain but is also\ncreated in the gut. Strikingly, about 95percent of our sero-\ntonin is synthesized by bacteria in the gut! (Carpenter,\n2012). Thus, complex communication pathways involv-\ning production and adequate levels of serotonin, the ENS,\nthe vagus nerve, and CNS serve to provide solid basis to\ninfer that the microbiome of our gut should act as a critical\nvariable concerning depression. Although no studies to\ndate have specifically investigated the effect of chronic\ndysbiosis on serotonin synthesis in the human gut, based\non what we know regarding this three-factor link, it can be\nhypothesized that a state of microbial imbalance in the gut\nmay have a direct adverse effect on the functions of both\nthe ENS and CNS and subsequent experience of depres-\nProbiotics and prebiotics\nA discussion about the impact of our gut health on our\nbehavior and emotional well-being cannot occur without\naddressing two very important players: probiotics and\nprebiotics. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2002)\ndefines probiotics as \"live microorganisms which when\nadministered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit\non the host\" (p. 8). Dietary supplements aside, probiotics\nare found in fermented foods, such as yogurt, kefir, and cer-\ntain fermented vegetables to name a few (Chutkan, 2015).\nSome of these microorganisms, many of which reside in\nour gut, were initially obtained moments after birth (Collen,\nfrom contact with people, animals, and objects in our envi-\nronment and have set up a home inside and on us over the\ncourse of our lifetime (DeSalle and Perkins, 2015).\nHowever, the details of specific strains of bacteria and their\npotential effects on our body are beyond the scope of this\narticle. This omission is intentional, as one aim of this arti-\ncle is to serve as a contribution for clinicians to become\nbetter aware of this growing area of therapeutic potential.\nHowever, it should not be inappropriately or prematurely\nused as a treatment tool for patients. As stated earlier, refer-\nrals should be made to GI and nutritional professionals for\npatients who may benefit from the emerging science.\nPrebiotics are the nutritional substances that probiotics\nrequire in order to survive, reproduce, and thrive. Simply\nstated, prebiotics can be understood as the food upon which\nprobiotic microbes feast. Without proper nutrition, no organ-\nism great or small can thrive. The same holds for the micro-\norganisms that reside in and on the human body. Prebiotics\nthat are naturally occurring in our diet are simply special\nforms of indigestible fiber that are obtained from food such\nas bananas, asparagus, onions, and many others (Chutkan,\n2015). A critical problem is that the modern Western diet, of\nwhich most Americans have become accustomed, fails in its\nability to provide prebiotics and adequately nourish the\nThe irony lies in the fact that we are eating more than ever at\nany point in history. However, the foods we are consuming\nare potentially starving and destroying the microbiome that\nis crucial to our physical and mental health. Thus, compre-\nhensive understanding of the vitality of the human microbi-\nome and its effect on measures of health would have proper\nnutrition at its core.\nImplications for practice and research\nThe emerging evidence indicating that the state our gut can\nhave a significant impact on our behavior and emotion is\nsomething that should be received and evaluated with serious\nconsideration for those providing mental health treatment.\nTraditionally, the field of psychology has separated the mind\nfrom the body. However, the strong bi-directional impacts\nthat our body and mind have on one another are becoming\never increasingly clear. For example, we know that a stressful\nevent, such as an interview, an exam, or an argument, can\noften lead to a whole host of physiological effects in the gut,\nranging from \"butterflies\" to nausea, and bouts of diarrhea, in\ncases of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Furthermore, the\nstressed states of our mind may even be able to adversely\nimpact the composition of our vital gut microbiome.\nO'Mahony etal. (2009) examined the effects of daily mater-\nnal separation--a commonly accepted operationalization of\nstress--in rats. Rats that experienced separation compared to\na control group demonstrated numerous stress-related out-\ncomes. One of the most notable outcomes was a reduction in\nthe diversity of the GI microbiome among rats in the experi-\nmental group, compared to those in the control condition.\nConversely, as the mounting research is uncovering, commu-\nnication is also occurring from the bottom up, with the gut\nmicrobiome \"talking to\" the brain, consequently affecting\nbehavior. In a groundbreaking study, Sudo etal. (2004) pro-\nvided evidence that germ-free mice have an exaggerated\nphysiological response to a stressful stimulus, as evidenced\nby abnormal functioning of the hypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00adadre-\nnal axis. Once such mice were colonized with a particular\nstrain of bacteria that is commonly found in the GI tracts of\ninfants, as well as in many fermented milk products, the stress\nresponse was reversed. Moreover, results from this study\npoint to the important influence that the gut microbiome has\non appropriate stress responses. Bercik etal. (2011) also dem-\nonstrated the powerful effects of gut microbes on exploratory\nbehavior as a measure of anxiety, in two strains of germ-free\nmice. BaggAlbino/c (BALB/c) mice are naturally more timid\nand inhibited, compared to NIH Swiss mice, which are much\nmore exploratory in nature. Under controlled conditions, each\ngroup of mice were bred germ-free and subsequently colo-\nnized with microbiota from their counterparts. Results indi-\ncated that after the microbial transplants from NIH Swiss\nmice, BALB mice demonstrated behaviors much more char-\nacteristic of their Swiss peers, including greater exploratory\nbehavior as well as an increase in the expression of brain-\nderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. In\ncontrast, Swiss mice demonstrated a behavioral profile simi-\nlar to their anxious donors, as evidenced by an inhibition in\nexploratory behavior. It is of note that the changes were not\npermanent in nature but clearly demonstrated how alterations\nin gut microbiota directly affect brain and behavioral func-\ntioning. It is evident that with studies such as these, the com-\nbined efforts of biology, neuroscience, nutrition, psychology,\nand psychiatry will undoubtedly provide a more profound\nunderstanding of communication between our \"first\" and\n\"second\" brain.\nNearly all clinicians will work with patients suffering\nfrom some form of anxiety or depression during their career.\nIt is not uncommon for both patients and clinicians to feel\nfrustrated during the therapeutic process when nearly every\npsychotropic option has been exhausted, and psychological\n4 Health Psychology Open \nareas of exploration appear to no longer provide valuable\ninsight and change. We now know there is real possibility\nthat something as simple as a patient's diet, history of GI ill-\nness, or chronic use of antibiotics may have significantly\nimbalanced an intricate system, with direct influence on\nemotion and behavior. Building on psychotherapy, and phar-\nmacotherapy, this third domain to treatment, involving pre-\ncise nutritional evaluation and therapy may prove to be an\nadditional, powerful, and natural tool to help us better under-\nstand and aid in the healing process of patients. Dinan etal.\n(2013) discuss the potential for the development of a specific\nnovel class of probiotics, known as psychobiotics. They sug-\ngest that these live organisms, when properly administered,\nhave the ability to act upon the gut\u00adbrain axis through the\nproduction of substances that are strongly correlated with\ndepression and anxiety, thus aiding patients with psychiatric\nconditions. Neef and Sanz (2013), as well as Bravo etal.\n(2012), further support the notion that targeted food and pro-\nbiotic supplement usage are important areas for future clini-\ncal application. The promise of psychobiotic and specialized\nnutritional prescriptions may strongly resonate for clinicians\nas an innovative and important aspect to treatment. However,\nit is important to note that such substances and interventions\nare still in the early stages of development and are not readily\navailable for clinical use as of yet. Undoubtedly, this area\ncould prove to be of great utility, as it would affect biological\nprocesses, but without the sometimes severe and chronic\nside- effects of traditional psychotropic medication.\nAlthough not specifically employed as a psychobiotic,\nMessaoudi etal. (2011) examined the effects of a probiotic\nformula on several measures of behavioral and psychologi-\ncal functioning, in both rat and human samples. The pre-\nclinical trial demonstrated reduced anxiety-like behavior,\namong rats after a 2-week ingestion of the probiotic for-\nmula. However, what is more striking are the results of the\nclinical trial, involving 66 human participants. In the dou-\nble-blind, placebo-controlled trial, subjects were given a\nfruit bar that either contained the probiotic formula or a\ndays. Both the experimental and control\nbars tasted the same. Results indicated that those in the\nexperimental condition reported significantly lower levels\nof anxiety, anger, depression, and somatization, on a num-\nber of self-report measures. Lower levels of cortisol were\nalso evident in the experimental condition compared to the\ncontrol group. Tillisch etal. (2013) also demonstrated the\neffect of a fermented milk product containing probiotics,\nwith significant impact on brain activity in regions control-\nling emotional and sensory processing, in healthy women.\nAlthough researchers used a placebo-controlled design,\nsample size of each condition was relatively small.\nThe work of Messaoudi etal. (2011), as well as Tillisch\netal. (2013), should be lauded for its inclusion of human, as\nopposed to solely animal subjects, as most research in this\narea lacks such a design. However, it is crucial not to over-\nsimplify the idea that nutritional intervention and a healthy\ngut will be the panacea for profound psychological difficul-\nties. Severe mood and paralyzing anxiety disorders are not\ngoing to be cured with probiotic yogurt and prebiotic fiber,\nalone. Additional, well-controlled, double-blind, studies are\nneeded to investigate what particular strains of bacteria might\ndirectly confer mental health benefits, which strains of bacte-\nria are directly related to specific emotional problems, and\nhow to best nourish our gut as a means to creating holistic\ntreatment plans for different disorders. Furthermore, as a way\nto strengthen the generalizability of future findings, research\ndesigns employing human participants will be crucial.\nConclusion\nThe brain\u00adgut connection is no longer an abstract concept.\nNeurobiological research has demonstrated a strong, bi-\ndirectional communication pathway whereby two seemingly\nindependent organs influence each other in profound ways.\nEvidence from medical science has strongly supported the\nnotion that unchecked stress levels exacerbate GI illnesses,\nsuch as IBS and other digestive disorders. What is becoming\nincreasingly clear is that a third factor--the microbiome of\nour gut--is playing a powerful role in this connection.\nMounting evidence supporting the notion of a microbiome\u00ad\ngut\u00adbrain axis is not only helping us better understand the\ncomplex underpinnings of GI illnesses, allergies, metabolic\nfunctioning, and obesity but also providing additional clues\ninto untangling multifaceted psychological problems such as\ndepression, anxiety-based illnesses, and autistic disorders.\nAs both interest and technology advance, we are well on our\nway to developing innovative research designs that will\npotentially lead to nutritionally based and psychobiotic treat-\nments, in addition to traditional psychological and psycho-\ntropic intervention. It is important to note that pure research\nalone will not be enough to advance this newly discovered\nterritory. Practitioners must embrace the burgeoning science\nnot simply as an adjunct to the healing process but as a vital\nthird tier to the treatment they provide.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nBercik P, Denou E, Collins J, etal.
