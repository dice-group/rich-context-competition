Understanding the experience of\ndementia from the perspectives of those diagnosed with the condition and measuring the\nneeds of their carers is of increasing concern to healthcare providers and policy makers\nAlongside deterioration in cognitive functioning, many difficult behavioural and\npsychological changes may occur, including aggression, anxiety, hallucinations and\nculturally inappropriate behaviours. Taken together, the physiological changes and the\nsocial correlates threaten quality of life for the patient and relatives (Hurt, 2008; Jones &\n1995; Zarit, Reever, & Bach-Peterson, 1980). Carers, even when highly motivated, can find it\nhard to establish their role and fulfil their capability as a carer without training and support.\nFamily carer stress is directly correlated with behavioural and psychological symptoms of\ndementia (Bradshaw, Goldberg, Schneider, & Harwood, 2013; Finkel, Costa e Silva, Cohen,\nThe limited benefit of pharmacological interventions for behavioural symptoms in\ndementia (O'Neil, Freeman, & Portland, 2011) presents a potential role for non-\npharmacological interventions which have been advocated and developed for people with\ndementia (Gitlin, Kales, & Lyketsos, 2012). Such therapies include reality orientation,\nvalidation, reminiscence, art, occupational therapy, complementary and multi-sensory\napproaches as well as interventions that utilise expressive and receptive music as therapy\n(Douglas, James, & Ballard, 2004). O'Neil et al. (2011) state that although the body of\nevidence to support these non-pharmacological interventions is somewhat limited, some\nbeneficial effects have been seen warranting further research into these methods for the\nmanagement of dementia.\nMusic and dementia\nMusic as therapy refers to the impact of music upon the psychological aspect of an\nindividual; it can be used to improve mood, regulate emotion and relieve stress (Clair &\nMemmott, 2008). Sacks (2008) states that the aims of music therapy are `to address the\nemotions, cognitive powers, thoughts and memories, the surviving ``self'' of the patient, to\nstimulate these and bring them to the fore. It aims to enrich existence, to give freedom,\nstability, organisation, and focus' (p. 336). Music can arouse and provide pleasure\n(Matarasso, 2014). Emerging before evidence supports the benefits of music for people\nwith dementia (Aldridge, 2000). Indeed, music therapy is now a valid treatment option\nWatson, 2012). Music activities also appear to have promising beneficial effects for carers.\nGotell, Brown, and Ekman (2000) concluded that music events for people with dementia in\nwhich the carers provided assistance are a way to improve the relationship between the\nperson with dementia and carer, and hence ease carer burden.\nWhile formal music therapy is applied by professionals with the appropriate qualifications\nwho work within a largely medical paradigm, alternative approaches to music in dementia care\nare also of increasing interest, for example the film `Alive Inside' about the use of music\ndelivered by iPods in nursing homes was premiered at the 2014 Sundance film festival (Murray,\n2014). Such approaches emphasise the intrinsic value of music and its `in the moment' benefits\nand may have wide applicability although there is a limited body of research to support them.\nA review by Hulme, Wright, Crocker, Oluboyede, and House (2010) concluded that\nalthough many studies had weak designs or small sample sizes, the therapeutic application\nof music does seem to be effective in reducing the behavioural and psychological symptoms\nassociated with dementia. A Cochrane review of this type of intervention suggested\ninconclusively that `there is no substantial evidence to support, nor discourage the use\nof music therapy in the care of older people with dementia' (Vink, Bruinsma, & Scholten,\n2003, p. 2). This was based largely upon poor study designs which made it difficult to\nobtain useful evidence. Since then, new studies have been carried out that add to\nA recent report by Cameron and Sosinowicz (2014) suggests that music has multiple\nbenefits; for people with dementia, their carers, staff working with them and for the\nmusicians involved.\nMusic appears to benefit individuals through the nuanced, yet significant connection\nbetween brain, ear and instrument. These links produce a positive effect on all of those\ninvolved in the care, management or experience of dementia (Wall & Duffy, 2010).\nSinging, as one aspect of music, combines language, music and instinctive human\nbehaviour to enhance neurological stimulation (Jeffries, Fritz, & Braun, 2003). Group\nmusic interventions may help to improve social interaction between people with dementia,\npromoting relaxation and reducing levels of agitation (Lin et al., 2011).\nThe current study aims to explore the experiences of people with dementia and their carers\nattending a group singing activity.\nMethod\nDesign\nA qualitative study with semi-structured interviews was used to gather in-depth information\nabout the experiences of people with dementia and their carers.\nSinging for the BrainTM\nSinging for the Brain (SftB) was established by The Alzheimer's Society in 2003. Its\ncharacteristics were described by Montgomery-Smith (2006), and Bannan and\nMontgomery-Smith (2008) undertook a pilot study which suggested that the activity\nencouraged participation and facilitated the learning of new songs. It combines aspects of\nreminiscence therapy and music. SftB is a standardised service that follows a specific model\nthat is adhered to across the UK. It aims to incorporate social interaction, peer support,\nengagement and active participation to improve quality of life, communication and social\nengagement and to enhance the relationship between the person with dementia and the\ncaregiver. The group activity involves a musician, people with dementia and their\ncaregivers. During a session, carer\u00adpatient pairs gather in a large circle and follow\ninstruction from the musician. The session starts with warm-up exercises for voice and\nbody before moving on to singing familiar songs that follow a different theme each week\nfor example `the weather' or `places'. Attendees are provided with song sheets including the\nlyrics for each song. Songs are sung in unison accompanied by the musician or in rounds\nwith harmonies. Depending on access to equipment, attendees can use percussive\ninstruments during the session. At the beginning and end of each session, there is an\nopportunity for refreshments and time to socialise.\nParticipants\nThe participants were recruited in the East Midlands area of the UK. Participants were\npatient\u00adcarer pairs attending at least two sessions of SftB in this region. A total of 10\npatient\u00adcarer pairs were recruited and interviewed (20 participants in total). There were\nthree mother\u00addaughter couples and seven husband\u00adwife pairs. In the marital pairs, five\nwere men with dementia cared for by their wives and two were women with dementia cared\nfor by their husbands. Two carers were male and the rest female. No other demographic data\nwere collected about participants. One of the participants `Linda' may be considered a key\ninformant, as she was particularly knowledgeable about the SftB group (Mays & Pope, 1995).\nEthical issues\nEthical approval for the study was granted by the University of Nottingham Medical School\nwas not required, as participants were recruited via a non-clinical community setting.\nAll participants were given information about the study and invited to participate at an\ninitial session of the SftB group. Capacity to take part was not formally assessed; however,\nparticipation was entirely voluntary, and two versions of the information sheet were\nprepared: one for participants with dementia and another for carers. Written consent was\nprovided by participants prior to interviews taking place.\nInterviews\nInterviews were semi-structured and included topics identified from the literature and in\ndiscussion with the research team. The topics included the experience of attending and\nparticipating in the group, impact on communication and relationships, and changes in\nhealth and behaviour during and after the sessions. Interviews ranged from 37 to\n85 minutes in length and took place in the home of the carer and the participant with\ndementia during a two-month period in which they were attending SftB sessions.\nInterviews were digitally recorded and transcribed by the lead author. The lead author\nparticipated in the SftB sessions prior to and throughout the data collection period which\nensured that she was familiar with interviewees (Shenton, 2004). Every effort was taken to\nengage both parties in each interview, as this has been reported as beneficial, particularly for\nthose with dementia who may be excluded from research (Clark & Keady, 2002).\nAnalysis\nTranscripts were subjected to thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) which involves\nexamining the text in detail to identify recurring patterns (open coding) which are refined\ninto `themes'. Thematic analysis facilitates production of both inductive and deductive\nfindings. That is, those that arise directly from the data and those which relate to theory\nand previous findings, respectively. The process was undertaken iteratively, with open codes\nidentified by the lead author and ongoing discussion between all authors throughout analysis\nto ensure reliability of the findings.\nResults\nThe following six themes were identified from the data:\n(1) Social inclusion and support\n(2) A shared experience\n(3) Positive impact on relationships\n(4) Positive impact on memory\n(5) Lifting the spirits\n(6) Acceptance of the diagnosis\nSocial inclusion and support\nSftB supports social inclusiveness, as it enables all participants to get involved, regardless of\nthe stage of dementia.\nI see people there that are very, very `far gone', and yet I see them participating, which I think is\nwonderful. (Robert, Carer)\nThat is the greatness about the group, it doesn't matter what stage you're at, you can enjoy\nit . . . and as I say the delight I get in seeing them doing things, there's one guy there and I know\nhe's really bad and I know, you can see him, normally he would go to sleep but he's there, he's\nawake and you can see that he's enjoying it. (Ellen, Carer)\nAs noted, loss of function and the deterioration associated with dementia can cause great\nanxiety for the people affected. Even when many daily activities are no longer possible for\npeople with dementia, the interviews show that participating in SftB appears to be something\nthat remains achievable and enjoyable. If the person with dementia experiences apathy, this\ncan lead to deterioration in their relationships (De Vugt et al., 2003); therefore, SftB has the\npotential to stimulate physical and emotional participation that appear to have beneficial\neffects for both the person with dementia and the carer.\nPeople attending the sessions felt that SftB allowed them to form bonds with people to\nwhom they could relate thus nurturing supportive networks.\nI have appreciated that the whole concept of Singing for the Brain . . . Wherever you go and\nwhatever group of people you're in singing seems to break down barriers and to open up sort of,\nnot only companionship, but a sense of belonging, and that's great. (George, PWD)\nBeing a carer is very lonely because you've got a social life but it's not the social life you thought\nyou were going to have when you're first retiring, it's totally different, and it is a very lonely\nexistence, and it's nice to have all these people that you meet to talk to who are going through\nthe same thing so . . . it's much better. (Julia, Carer)\nThe importance of feeling part of a group is particularly salient in dementia care because\nof the negative impact of isolation which compounds disease burden. The burden of\ncaregiving on carers means they often become socially isolated (Taylor et al., 1998). A\npaper by Haley, Levine, Brown, and Bartolucci (1987) reported that those caregivers with\na larger number of friends and social contacts, as well as those carers who attended more\nsocial activities with friends had an increased overall life satisfaction. A more recent study\nconducted by Daly, McCarron, Higgins, and McCallion (2013) demonstrates how informal\ncarers use social networks as a way to manage and sustain their changing role as carer.\nIt was suggested that SftB was an opportunity for carers to share information and form\nsupportive networks. Beard and Fox (2008) note that groups such as these nurture a sense of\nsolidarity and collectivity.\nFrom a carer's point of view I think it is fantastic, it is really, that they can get together and\nunderstand the varying stages of dementia, you get to know an awful lot you know, mixing\ntogether, of what is available for you, more so than someone coming along and trying to give\nyou a talk, you know, you get to know from other people that have experienced it . . . people\nrelax and mix, we are joined together and help one another, and you get to know these people,\nand as you go along the line you help them you know, and I think that's the beauty of something\nlike this, is being there for one another you know. (Ellen, Carer)\nSftB is a service where carers can discuss topics of concern in a relaxed, informal environment.\nStudies have shown that lower levels of informal support are linked to increased carer burden\nand increased depression (Coen, O'Boyle, Swanwick, & Coakley, 1999; Coen, Swanwick,\nO'Boyle, & Coakley, 1997; Gold et al., 1995). Increased social support is related to positive\ncarer outcomes (Shaw et al., 1997). Despite the obvious solution to reduce this aspect of carer\nburden, it can be difficult for carers to interact in a social environment for example due to time\nconstraints (Haley et al., 1995). SftB provides a platform for these interactions to take place.\nThe fact that people can share information and support one another at these sessions may\nmean that less support is required from health and social care services.\nA shared experience\nSftB provides a mutual, shared, enjoyable experience for the person with dementia and their\ncarer.\nThis is one of the great sadnesses and I get quite emotional about this, there is so much we can't\nshare anymore and this, I should say that this, the Singing for the Brain is one thing that has\nbenefitted me because it's one thing that we can do together for an hour or two and get equal\npleasure from and equal meaning. (Robert, Carer)\nIf activities that were done together in the past become no longer possible, it can contribute\nto a sense of loss for both parties (Purves & Phinney, 2013). This seems to be especially\nimportant in marital pairs (De Vugt et al., 2003; Wright, 1991). Issues such as less intimacy,\nreduced enjoyment of companionship and less reciprocity may result in a reduced quality of\nthe martial relationship (Wright, 1991). SftB provides a mutually enjoyable activity that\nshould have a positive impact on care and well-being for the person with dementia and\ntheir carer, in keeping with reports about other psychosocial interventions (e.g. Melunsky\net al., 2013). This can be seen as an antidote to the sense of loss experienced in many spousal\nrelationships when one partner has dementia.\nPositive impact on relationships\nSftB has a positive impact on the relationship between the person with dementia and\ncarer, and their relationship with others. The activity is seen as an enjoyable topic of\nconversation, as a way to improve relationships and adds another dimension to the\nrelationship.\nWe've talked about that as an extra kind of thing . . . and it's given something for you (refers\nto PWD) and dad to talk about . . . you've had much more to talk about with Dad. (Linda,\nCarer)\nThe importance of a meaningful interaction between the person with dementia and their\ncarer that was not focussed on the clinical aspects of care; one that allows communication\nand connection at a different level, is especially important in the care of those with dementia\nwhere communication has deteriorated and has been advocated (e.g. Basting, 2009).\nWell like I said when I turn round and see you (PWD) smiling as you're singing and there's\ndefinitely, I mean it's pure pleasure for me but it's nice for us to look at each other while we're\nsinging . . . it's like we understand what we're both experiencing you know, so you don't need to\nsay it, it's just there . . . and that's lovely isn't it, really lovely. (Linda, Carer)\nThe nature of dementia means that, for those with the condition, the benefit of the sessions is\nsomewhat short-lived as the activity is forgotten in some cases; therefore, the intrinsic value\nof the sessions becomes most important. Studies by Bruer, Spitznagel, and Cloninger (2007)\nand Svansdottir and Snaedal (2006) support this, as does work by Basting (2005).\nHowever, longer lasting benefits were reported by carers, who indicate that the sessions\nhave an enduring positive effect on their sense of well-being and their capacity to\nprovide care.\nSftB acts as a platform to stimulate memories and reminiscence. The songs that are sung\nat the session provide topics on which to reminisce.\nIt was nice doing some of those old ones you haven't heard for a long time, and often you find\nyourselves singing them, and `oh this is great'. And does it make you think about things from\nyears and years ago. (Linda, Carer)\nI think it reminds you of some songs that you've not sung for a while so it sort of brings back\nthings. (Mark, PWD)\nIt is also beneficial for the person with dementia to realise that some aspects of their memory\nare still intact as they remember the lyrics to some of the familiar songs. For the person with\ndementia, the realisation that their ability to remember remains helps to give them a feeling\nof hope and positivity. Such benefits support Kitwood's (1997) theory of person-centred\ncare, by promoting agency and reducing `malignant social psychology', and concur with\nreviews of similar interventions, e.g. Beard (2012). The positive impact of reminiscence on\npsychological well-being has been backed up in a meta-analysis conducted by Bohlmeijer,\nI was looking at you when you were singing and you didn't have to look at the lyrics for a lot of\nit cause you remembered it, and that's great isn't it, cause it's nice to actually remember\nsomething. (Linda, Carer)\nA study by El Haj, Fasotti, and Allain (2012) proposed that music has the ability to enhance\nautobiographical memory-recall in Alzheimer's patients. It was found that, compared to\nmemories evoked in `silence', those memories evoked in the presence of music were more\nspecific, with more emotional substance and were recalled faster. However, the direct\nmechanism by which this is achieved remains unclear. It may be that the familiar music\nutilised at SftB somehow unlocks these memories in the participants. The music acts as a cue\nto stimulate involuntary autobiographical memories (Johannessen & Berntsen, 2010).\nWhen presented with sung versus spoken lyrics, it was found that patients with\nAlzheimer's disease had increased accuracy for remembering sung lyrics, whereas healthy\nadults showed no significant difference. By observing these differences, it was suggested that\nthe music-processing areas of the brain may be spared in Alzheimer's disease and also that\nmusic enhances arousal, and therefore better attention and improved memory (Simmons-\nStern, Budson, & Ally, 2010). These findings support the observations that were made\nduring a SftB session, namely that lyrics of songs can be recalled when many other\nmemories cannot.\nLifting the spirits\nAttendance at SftB was reported to have a positive impact on mood and well-being.\nTo go to something you enjoy you overcome what is wrong with you. I mean I know George\nwasn't feeling well on Tuesday but we came and we enjoyed it and we were rejoicing thinking,\nman weren't that wonderful. (Karen, Carer)\nI feel better when I come home, I mean I enjoy going. (Mary, PWD)\nRespondents suggest that SftB makes them feel better. It offers an enjoyable activity that\nhelps improve people's sense of well-being that can have a lasting effect on some.\nI've certainly noticed a huge difference in mum since she's been coming . . . You're brighter, more\nalert, more like your old self. (Diana, Carer)\nYou can feel quite low, quite sad and then we've sat there and we've been singing and I've turned\nround and looked at you and you've had this big smile on your face and that's what's been the\nlovely thing for me, to see this difference and this weight being lifted just for that little bit of time\nand then it just seems to keep you going for a little bit afterwards. (Linda, Carer)\nMusic has been found to stimulate and regulate emotions, provide enjoyment and relieve\nstress (Juslin & Laukka, 2005). It induces emotions that can lead to changes in heart rate,\nrespiration, skin temperature and hormone secretion, including endorphins (Khalfa, Dalla\nBella, Roy, Peretz, & Lupien, 2003; Lundqvist, Carlson, Hilmersson, & Juslin, 2009; Suda,\nMorimoto, Obata, Koizumi, & Maki, 2008). These effects are likely to contribute to the\nenhanced mood reported by attendees at SftB.\nThe point is that I think that music, irrespective of what you may be suffering from, is uplifting\nfor just everybody really. (Roger, Carer)\nEverybody has just got so much pleasure on their faces, and that's uplifting in itself, when you\nsee other people really enjoying something. (Linda, Carer)\nAcceptance of the diagnosis\nAnother reported benefit of SftB was in helping people come to terms with the diagnosis of\ndementia.\nIt can be very frightening, when they tell you you've got it, it can be very frightening . . . I think in\na nutshell, I think those meetings up there are good for everybody . . . whether you have got the\nAlzheimer's or whether you're just a supporter, I think it's good for everybody, to come to terms\nand accept it . . . and try and continue on as long as you can. (Gary, PWD)\nThe impact of diagnosis on patient\u00adcarer couples has been discussed in many papers (e.g.\nKeady & Nolan, 2003; Nolan, Lundh, Keady, & Grant, 2003; Robinson, Clare, & Evans,\n2005; Searson, Hendry, Ramachandran, Burns, & Purandare, 2008.) Finding ways to cope\nor finding acceptance of the diagnosis will help people adjust to their life-changing situation.\nThe development of ways to cope with the diagnosis on the part of the person with dementia\nand the carer is crucial to finding a sense of well-being and minimising excess disability\ncouples who understood and accepted the diagnosis were better able to adapt to their\nchanged circumstances.\nSftB is a targeted activity that can be incorporated into the routine of those living with\ndementia. It thus indirectly acts as a means to help with the acceptance of the diagnosis and\nfacilitates contact with individuals in a similar situation with whom they can identify.\nConclusions\nThe findings add to a growing literature on the utility of arts-based interventions in the care\nof people with dementia. The qualitative approach generated in-depth accounts of people's\nopinions and feelings related to the activity. This study supports the now well-documented\nclaims that the perspectives of people with dementia can and should be included in research\n(Alzheimer Europe, 2012) and contributes to the burgeoning body of literature that focuses\non meaning \u00ad rather than outcome-based programmes by demonstrating the intrinsic value\nof music for people with dementia and their carers alike.\nAlthough participant numbers were relatively low, this is acceptable in qualitative\nresearch which focuses on in-depth understanding from a homogenous group selected for\ntheir knowledge and experience of a particular phenomenon. Despite rich and detailed\naccounts of the activity from both the perspective of the carer and the person with\ndementia, in some instances the participant with dementia was unable to recall the SftB\nsessions and therefore carers tended to dominate the discussion.\nThe positive response to SftB from people with dementia and carers suggests that the\nprogramme has potential to be offered to a wider range of people. Since 2003, access to the\nservice across the UK has grown and there are currently 101 SftB services available, many of\nwhich have long waiting lists. As a growing service for which there is has been relatively little\nresearch, this study has generated evidence for its value in this population. As it is a\nstandardised service model, it can easily be replicated. SftB is a relatively low-cost activity\nand does not require specialist resources aside from the musician leading the sessions. Its\npotential cost effectiveness should therefore be explored in detail in future studies.\nFuture studies could look in more detail at the improvements reported in the sessions, for\nexample enhanced memory could be measured using standardised tests. The SftB sessions\nwere led by one musician. It is therefore important to look at SftB sessions led by different\nmusicians to see whether this affects the results. The way in which music interventions are\ndelivered has been noted to be important (Vella-Burrows, 2012). As all participants in the\nstudy were White British it is important for the activity to be evaluated in different regions to\ncapture a more diverse population.\nA musical activity such as SftB has multiple health and well-being benefits for people with\ndementia and their carers. In addition, the group setting facilitates a sense of belonging and\nprovides much needed social support. As well as improvements in mood which outlast the\nsessions, and enhanced relationships, the activity facilitated acceptance of the diagnosis of\ndementia which may help promote longer term well-being for people with dementia and their\ncarers and enable earlier access to appropriate support. The ability of singing to stimulate\nmemory and its mutually beneficial impact on people with dementia and carers are unique\nfeatures of this activity but support promising findings from studies using other modalities,\nfor example visual art (Camic, Tischler, & Pearman, 2014; MacPherson, Bird, Anderson,\nDavis, & Blair, 2009) and thus should be the subject of further research.\n"
