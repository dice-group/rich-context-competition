This move to innova-\ntion adoption and new income streams has been more pronounced for new private and\nforeign banks, while there appears to have been certain hesitation on the part of public\nsector and old private banks. This article studies the impact of the move to new income\nstreams and the consequent rising diversification on performance (as measured by prof-\nitability and stability of income) for Indian banks.\nA comparative analysis of income generated from these income streams for different\nbank groups in India shows that new private banks and foreign banks in India have\nbeen more successful than public sector banks in generating a greater proportion of\ntheir income from non-interest and fee-based sources. However, this increasing diver-\nsification cannot be linked to better risk-adjusted performance in the Indian context.\nUsing multiple regression analysis, the impact of diversification and increasing share\nof fee-based income on profitability and risk-adjusted profitability is questioned for all\nThe article finds that the rising share of fee-based income and non-interest income in\ntotal income and diversification has a positive impact on profitability, but the impact\non risk-adjusted performance and hence stability is not statistically significant. While\nthe results show a positive impact of diversification on profitability, the article under-\nlines that the impact direction of diversification measures may be negative, which is\nin agreement to what many studies have shown in the US, European, Australian and\nIndian contexts.\nThis article considers the impact of diversification in non-interest income separately\nfrom diversification in total income. This diversification score helps to know if the banks\nare generating their non-interest income from only fee income or only their own invest-\nments or have they diversified the non-interest income generation by focusing on both.\nImportantly, there is a positive impact of increasing share of `fee income' in both total\nincome and non-interest income on profitability as well as risk-adjusted measures. The\nresults underscore that while public sector banks need to generate more income from\nfee-based activities, it would be imperative to choose sources of fee-based income that\nremain stable and have a positive impact on risk-adjusted measures.\nVIKALPA\nThe Journal for Decision Makers\nManagement, Ahmedabad\nSAGE Publications\nsagepub.in/home.nav\nhttp://vik.sagepub.com\nExecutive\nSummary\nInnovation, one of the key drivers of growth, has\nbeen defined by the Oxford Dictionaries,1 simply,\nas a new method, idea, product, etc. Innovation\nis a long process depending critically on recogni-\ntion of new, external information, assimilating it and\napplying it to commercial ends (Cohen & Levinthal,\n1990). Along this process, several of the new concepts\nmay get waylaid even in the gestation period and be\nforced to exit. There are coherent patterns in the stimuli\nfor innovation, types of innovation, and in barriers to\ninnovation, including economic barriers (Utterback\n& Abernathy, 1975). Economic barriers to innovation\ncan include the need to create necessary incentives for\nadoption and for destabilization of incumbents (see,\nThis appears to be especially relevant while discussing\ninnovative bank income streams in the Indian context.\nInnovation in banking has encapsulated new tech-\nnology and channels, new products and services, new\nmarkets and institutions and new business models.\nThis has led the banks to diversify into new income\nstreams comprising non-interest income, of which\nfee income is a crucial component. This article asks\nwhether the move to innovation in income streams\nand the consequent rising diversification in income\nhas impacted profitability and stability of income posi-\ntively for Indian banks. While banks have adopted\nnew income streams owing to an overriding concern\nto reduce dependence of profitability on fund-based\nsources and diversify the income generation, the conse-\nquences in terms of stability of earnings seems unclear.\nWhile some studies (see, for example, Busch & Kick,\n2003) point to a positive impact of diversification on\nfinancial performance and risk profile, others show a\nnegative impact of the move into fee-based activities\non risk-adjusted performance of banks (De Young &\nthe Indian context, RBI's former Deputy Governor,\nGopinath (2011) indicated that fee-based income may\nnot be less risky than traditional lending activities and\nthere is a need to understand the underlying risks and\neffectively monitor the provision of such services.\n  has been more pronounced for banks in\nthe United States and Europe. De Young and Rice (2001)\nincome in the US commercial banking system increased\nbanking industry assets, and increased from 20.31 per\ncent to 42.20 per cent of the aggregate banking industry\noperating income. For developed countries, Kaufman\nand Larry (1994) showed an increase in the share of\nnon-interest income to total income in the banking\nsectors of most developed countries between 1982 and\ncredit unions diversified their activities in the 1990s to\nreduce their reliance on interest revenue which took\nthree primary forms: (i) a change in pricing policy with\ntransaction fees on loans and deposits; (ii) new finan-\ncial services including insurance, funds management\nand off-balance sheet activities that generated commis-\nsions and facility fees; and (iii) shift in the portfolio mix\nof assets away from personal loans and advances into\nresidential lending.\nImportantly, Feldman and Schmidt (1999) pointed\nout that the composition of non-interest income had\nbeen changing for the US economy with fee income\nbecoming the dominant source of non-interest income\nreceived by banks made possible by technological and\nregulatory changes opening up new sources of non-\ninterest income.\nGamra and Plihon (2011) suggested that emerging\nmarket banks are required to innovate in services and\nproducts, to differentiate strategies, and fundamen-\ntally transform their business into a much wider array\nof non-traditional services. This article shows that from\ninterest income as a share of net operating revenue\nbiggest increase of non-interest income being in trading.\nThe shift towards non-interest income has been\nsignificant for Indian banking. Umakrishnan and\nBandopadhyay (2005) compared the difference in\nincome composition for new generation private sector\nbanks, foreign banks, public sector and cooperative\nof interest income in total income had been declining\nover the years. The RBI Report on International Trade\nin Banking Services (2010) showed that foreign bank\nbranches operating in India had been more successful in\ngenerating income from fee-based services than Indian\nbanks' branches operating outside India. Interestingly,\nthe report also pointed out that while for foreign banks\noperating in India, derivative, stock, securities, foreign\nexchange trading services' and `financial consultancy\nand advisory services' were the major source of fee\nincome, for Indian banks operating abroad, the largest\nproportion of fee income came from `credit-related\nservices' and `trade\u00adfinance related services'. Uppal\n(2010) showed that for banks in India, interest income\nwas continuously decreasing on account of deregu-\nlation in interest rates and non-interest income was\nrising. Sahoo and Mishra (2012) related greater extent\nof operational diversification in banks with greater\nfluctuations in financial performance.\nMuch of such shift in the Indian context has been\ncontributed by the private sector and the foreign sector.\nPrivate sector banks and foreign banks in India have\nbeen successful in generating a greater proportion of\ntheir income from fee-based sources, while public sector\nbanks in India have lagged behind in this context. In the\nrecent years, there have been increasing efforts by public\nsector banks to reduce dependence on fund-based\nsources majorly through sale of third party products.\nHowever, as Table 1 shows, the proportion of non-in-\nterest income in total income has not changed much\nfor public sector banks, implying a full-fledged resist-\nance in adoption of non-interest streams. The economic\nexplanation of such behaviour could be that banks are\nunsure of the strategic implications of such a shift.\nTable 1: Fee-based Income as % of Total Income (SH\nFEE\n)\nPublic sector\nbanks\nPrivate sector\nbanks (new)\nPrivate sector\nbanks (old)\nSource: RBI database, CMIE database, and ACE Equity database.\nThe primary role of a bank is to accept deposits and\nmake loans, profit being the difference between the costs\nof deposits and the earnings from lending. However,\nin the last two decades, the environment facing banks\nhave changed drastically, with banks' income no longer\nconfined to lending and income generated from its\nown funds. Fee-based income or income earned from\nsources that do not involve exposure to bank's own\nfunds is globally becoming more and more important\nfor the bank's income statement.\nFollowing the methodology of diversification scores\ndeveloped by Stiroh and Rumble (2006), this article\nuses such diversification scores generated for a\ncomparative analysis of bank groups in India. Using\nmultiple regression analysis, it questions the impact\nof diversification and increasing share of fee-based\nincome on profitability and risk-adjusted profitability\nmeasures for all banks in India over the period 2005\u00ad\n2012. The article thus tries to delve into the diversi-\nfication brought about by the move to innovative\nincome sources and its impact on bank profitability\nand income stability.\nThe primary role of banks as intermediaries chan-\nnelizing savings into investments is underlined by\ndeposit-taking and lending activities. Smith et al. (2003)\npointed out that while the basic functions of banks and\nother financial service companies remained relatively\nconstant over time, these functions are now being\nprovided through different products and services.\nEconomic forces have led to financial innovations, in\nturn fostering competition and diminished to an extent\nof cost advantage. Traditional banking, as a result, has\nlost profitability, with banks diversifying into new\nactivities that may bring higher returns.\nThe shift of banks towards new business lines and\nfee-based income has been more prominent in devel-\noped countries and therefore much of such litera-\nture has emanated from the banking industries of\nEurope and the US. De Young and Rice (2004b) docu-\nmented that for the US economy, a part of increases\nin non-interest income flow was coming from new\nlines of business made possible by deregulations\nintroduced since 1990s while a part stemmed from\nproducing traditional banking services with new\nproduction processes that were made possible by\nadvances in information technology, communications\nchannels and financial processes.\nIn this context, a vital question being raised in economic\nliterature is whether the growth in income from\nfee-based activities has contributed to greater stability\nin bank income. Davis and Tuori (2000) showed that\nbanks obtained diversification benefits in increasing\nnon-interest income, which in turn helped to smooth\nprofitability. Smith et al. (2003) examined the varia-\nbility of interest and non-interest income and their\ncorrelation for banking systems of EU countries for the\nimportance of non-interest income for most bank cate-\ngories have stabilized profits in the European banking\nsystem in the given years. However, it does not estab-\nlish that non-interest income is invariably more stable\nthan interest income.\nChiorazzo, Milani and Salvini (2008) found that\nincome diversification increased risk-adjusted returns\nand Kick (2009), studying the impact of growth of\nnon-interest income on the financial performance and\nfound evidence that risk-adjusted returns on equity\nand total assets had both been positively affected\nby higher fee income activities for German universal\nbanks. They also found that savings and commer-\ncial banks having a greater share of fee-based income\ncharged lower interest margins, implying subsidization\nbetween interest and fee business.\nInaba and Hattori (2007) showed that Japanese commer-\ncial banks had also been expanding their fee-based\nbusiness and found a positive correlation between\nJapanese commercial banks' fee business income and\nnet interest income in the second half of the 1990s. They\npointed out that this relationship led to an increase in\nthe variability of their Return on Assets (ROA) but did\nnot affect their management stability over that period.\nwas not clearly observed.\nUmakrishnan and Bandopadhyay (2005) indicated that\ndiversifying to fee-based income was a more viable\noption for banks in the long run and needed constant\nfeel of the market requirement, innovation and skill\nupgradation. Arora and Kaur (2009) examined the\ninternal determinants for diversification of banks in\nIndia using aggregate bank level data for foreign sector\nbanks, nationalized banks, private banks and the SBI\ngroup. They found that risk, cost of production, regu-\nlatory cost and technological change were very signif-\nicant for bringing variation in the income structure of\nthe banks.\nHowever, many studies pointed to a greater depend-\nence on non-interest income contributing to increased\nvolatility in bank income. De Young and Roland (2001)\nand Stiroh (2004) found this to hold for the US firms.\nDe Young and Roland (2001), analysing the quarterly\nmovements in revenues and profits at 472 large and\nthat earning volatility increased with greater share\nof revenue coming from fee-based activities. They\npointed out three reasons why fee-based income may\nnot be more stable than traditional banking activities.\nFirst, banks may have qualitatively different relation-\nships with their fee-based customers as opposed to\ntheir traditional banking customers, the relationship\nwith the latter tending to be stronger. For example,\nduring a downturn, the fall in revenue from fee-based\nincome like mutual fund sales may be sharp while\ninterest earnings from lending activities is not likely\nto fluctuate much. Second, expanding production\nof fee-based activities requires much greater fixed\ncosts than increasing production of lending activities.\nThird, as fee-based activities do not require banks to\nhold capital against them, banks can take advantage\nof this to raise return to equity. This creates incen-\ntives for banks to arbitrage risk-based capital regu-\nlations by transforming on-balance sheet risk from\ninterest-based activities to off-balance sheet risk from\nfee-based activities.\nDe Young and Rice (2003) showed that large banks\ntended to generate relatively more non-interest income.\nThe article also found that well-managed banks relied\nless heavily on non-interest income while relation-\nship banking tended to generate non-interest income.\nFurther, some technological advances (e.g., cash-\nless transactions, mutual funds) are associated with\nincreased non-interest income while other technolog-\nical advances (e.g., loan securitization) are associated\nwith reduced non-interest income at banks.\nStiroh (2004), examining the link between risk-ad-\njusted bank performance and diversification for\nhigher non-interest income was negatively linked with\nrisk-adjusted performance. Esho et al. (2004) pointed\nout, in their study spanning 198 Australian credit\nunions, that increased reliance on fee income gener-\nating activities was associated with increased risk.\nStiroh and Rumble (2006) showed that diversification\nbenefits were more than offset by increased exposure\nto non-interest activities. These non-interest activi-\nties were volatile but not more profitable than lending\nactivities. Stiroh and Rumble (2006) decomposed\nthe impact of the move to greater fee-based activities\ninto a `direct exposure effect' (coming from a greater\ndependence on new activities) and an `indirect diver-\nsification effect' (coming from the resultant change in\nrevenue concentration). Analysing the performance of\nthe US financial holding companies (FHCs) from 1997\nto 2002, this article showed that while FHCs adopted\n`cross-selling' for diversifying revenue and lowering\ncosts, this actually meant exposure to multiple income\nstreams with similar shocks and the greater correlation\nacross revenue streams significantly hampered diversi-\nfication benefits.\nVallascas, Crepi and Hagendorff (2011), analysing the\nimpact of income diversification on the performance of\nItalian banks during the recent financial crisis, showed\nthat institutions which were diversified before the\ncrisis experienced the largest decline in performance\nduring the financial crisis.\nIn the Indian context, Sahoo and Mishra (2012) found\nthat the banks with greater extent of operational\ndiversification suffered from the problem of greater\nfluctuations in financial performance and a larger\nasset base did not necessarily help a bank to bring\nin stability in its financial performance. Moreover,\ngreater efforts by the banks towards creating entry\nbarrier or image advantage raised fluctuations in their\nfinancial performance.\nWhile banks in India have recognized the impor-\ntance of raising income from fee-based income activ-\nities and thereby reducing the dependence on fund-\nbased income, there are many challenges in the way\nof moving to more fee-based activities and sustaining\nthem, especially for public sector banks. It may be that,\nbanks face certain barriers to adopting the orientation\nrelevant to such new business lines, recognizing that\nfee-based income may not contribute to stable income\nand that the right choice of activities for income diver-\nsification are unclear.\nThe empirical analysis uses data on revenue sources and\nperformance measures of banks in India for the period\nand the importance of these variables is discussed in\nthe context of the study.\nVariables Definitions\n  Scores\nFollowing methodological construct of Stiroh and\nRumble (2006), diversification scores are built for the\nbanks. In this article, `two' diversification ratios are\nconsidered. The first considers the diversification in\nbank income into interest and non-interest income and\nthe second considers the diversification of non-interest\nincome into `commission, exchange and brokerage\nincome' and other components. `Other Income' for\nbanks in India comprises of `commission, exchange and\nbrokerage', net profit (loss) on sale of investments, net\nprofit (loss) on revaluation of investments, net profit\n(loss) on sale of land and other assets, net profit (loss)\non exchange transactions, and miscellaneous income.\nIn the study, the income from `commission, exchange\nand brokerage' is denoted as `fee income'.2\nThis methodologically improves upon the existing\nliterature by introducing a diversification score for\nnon-interest income which will help to underline\n`how' banks are generating their non-interest income.\nThe components of non-interest income other than fee\nincome are largely income generated from the bank's\nown investment. This diversification score thus helps\nto know if the banks are generating their non-interest\nincome from only fee income or only their own invest-\nments or they have diversified the non-interest income\ngeneration by focusing on both.\nFurther, this refinement in methodology also helps to\nfind the impact of such diversification of non-interest\nincome on bank performance. This is important in the\nface of many studies showing that trading/invest-\nment income tends to be volatile and generates lower\nrisk-adjusted returns (Gamra & Plihon, 2011; Stiroh\n& Rumble, 2006; Umakrishnan & Bandopadhyay,\n2005). Importantly, it is `commission, exchange, and\nbrokerage' which `encapsulates income being gener-\nated from provision of new services and products\nby banks in the recent years'. Considering a sepa-\nrate diversification score for this component implies\nthat focus can be on the impact of diversification of\nnon-interest income on profitability and stability of\nincome for banks. The first diversification score simply\nsees the impact of diversified income on bank perfor-\nmance. However, the second diversification score goes\nbeyond that to underline the impact of the banks'\nmovement into `newer income streams' (which had\nthe most profound impact on `fee income' in the years\nunder study) on bank performance.\nIt helps to analyse whether with banks focusing on\ngenerating non-interest income, the movement to\nnewer income streams (which will raise `fee income')\nshould bring in better performance or should the banks\nfocus more on income from their own investments to\npositively impact profitability and stability. Further,\nthe focus can also be on the `distribution' of non-in-\nterest income into fee-based and other components of\nnon-interest income.\nFurther, along with studying the impact of the share\nof fee income in total income (SH\nFEE\n), and the share of\nnon-interest income in total income (SH\nNON\n) on bank\nperformance, the article also considers the impact of the\nshare of fee-income in non-interest income (SH\nFOT\n) on\nbank performance. It becomes crucial to consider sepa-\nrately the income generated from `fee income', along\nwith `other or non-interest income' to see the implica-\ntion of both the increasing share of non-interest income\nand the increasing `fee-income' in non-interest income\non bank profitability and stability.\nThus, diversification scores are generated from these\ntwo different indicators. Following methodological\nconstruct of Stiroh and Rumble (2006), diversification\nscores are defined as follows:\nNON\nIN\nFOT\nOT\nwhere,\nSH\nIN\n= Share on interest income in total income\nSH\nNON\n= Share of non-interest income or other income\nin total income\nSH\nFOT\n= Share of `fee-income' in non-interest/other\nincome\nSH\nOT\n= Share of `other components'3 in non-interest/\nother income\nDIV 1 measures the degree of diversification in the\nbank's revenue and a higher score reflects a greater\ndegree of revenue diversification for the bank. A score\nof zero would suggest that all of the bank's revenue is\ncoming from fee-based or fund-based sources, while\na score of 0.5 would mean a complete diversification.\nAgain DIV 2 reflects the diversification in non-in-\nterest income. Thus, a score of zero would suggest\nthat the bank is generating all its non-interest income\nfrom either `fee-income' or `other components' and a\nscore of 0.5 would suggest that the bank is generating\nnon-interest income equally from both the components.\nThe diversification scores are calculated from interest\nincome, other income and `fee income' averaged over\nin Stiroh and Rumble (2006) where diversification\nscores for each period were averaged.\nRisk-adjusted Measures of Performance\nRisk-adjusted returns on equality (RAROE) and\nrisk-adjusted returns on assets (RAROA) (see, for\nare constructed as below:\nwhere, ROA is the average Return on Assets for the\naverage Return on Equity for the individual bank over\nROA\nand \nROE\nrepresent standard\ndeviation of ROA and ROE. It may be seen that RAROA\nand RAROE are `Sharpe ratios' defined by the average\nprofits divided by the standard deviation of profits and\nrepresent profits per unit of risk.\nA third measurement of risk-adjusted performance is\nalso introduced following Stiroh and Rumble (2006),\nthe `Z' score defined as:\n= +\n[ / ]/ (5)\nwhere, E/A is the mean equity to asset ratio; the Z score\nthus shows risk-adjusted performance, with a higher\nscore denoting a better performance.\nMethodological Construct\n1. A comparative study of the share of income coming\nfrom fee-based activities for public sector banks4\nvis-\u00e0-vis private sector banks (old and new) and\nforeign banks5 is done.\n2. The Z scores are compared with the diversification\nratios for banks groups.\n3. For analysing the impact of diversification on\nrisk-adjusted performance, two basic empirical\nspecifications are used:\ni i NON i i i i\n= + + + + +\n     \n( )\n\ni i NON i i i i\n= + + + + +\n     \ni i FOT i i i i\n= + + + + +\n     \n( )\n\ni i FOT i i i i\n= + + + + +\n     \ni i FEE i i i i\n= + + + + +\n     \n( )\n\ni i FEE i i i i\n= + + + + +\n     \nwhere, the dependent variable X\ni\nis ROA , ROE ,\nRAROA , RAROE and Z Score respectively of the\nthe predictor or independent variables are DIV (1),\nDIV (2), SH\nNON\n, SH\nFEE\nand SH\nFOT\n. DIV (1) and DIV\n(2) are diversification scores defined earlier in equa-\nNON\nand SH\nFEE\nare Share of `fee-in-\ncome' and non-interest income and other income\nin total income respectively. The first specifica-\ntion is denoted as Model 1, second specification as\nModel 2 and the third specification as Model 3. It\nmay be underlined that Model 1 sees the impact\nof non-interest income share and diversification of\ntotal income on dependent variables, while Model\n2 assesses the impact of `share of fee-income' in\nnon-interest income and diversification of non-in-\nterest income on dependent variables. Model 3 sees\nthe impact of `share of fee-income' in total income\nand diversification of non-interest income on\ndependent variables.\nFor independent variables, both average diversifica-\ntion ratios and average SH\nFEE\nand SH\nNON\nare consid-\nered. This is to ascertain that the impact of increasing\nincome being derived from non-interest/fee-based\nsources is clearly understood. Control variables Log\n(Assets) [LASS], Log (Capital) [LCAP], Ratio of Net\nNon-Performing Assets to net Advances [RNPA] are\nalso introduced (see, for example, De Young & Rice,\nData Source\nData on income, expenditure, assets, liabilities and\nimportant ratios for banks in India over the period\nProwess database, and ACE Equity database. Data is\nobtained on 81 banks in total as banks not in operation\nin 2011 are not considered in the sample. Z scores cannot\nbe computed for all banks in the sample due to unavail-\nability of data on total capital for some banks in the\ngroup. Data of the cross-sectional sample of 81 banks\nin India is thus obtained, providing one observation\nwhich have data for the last year, 2011, are included.\nThis means that a bank incorporated in any year from\nincluded in the sample.\nThe article considers the share of income generated\nfrom fee-based and non-fee based sources for banks\na comparative analysis of income generated from\nfee and non-fee income for different bank groups in\nIndia. Using diversification ratios, DIV 1 and DIV 2,\nit further compares the diversification in portfolio for\nbanks groups in India and uses Z scores to compare\nthe risk-adjusted performance between different bank\ngroups. Additionally, the impact of diversification in\nincome and rising share of fee-based income in other\nincome on risk-adjusted performance for banks in India\nis examined using regression analysis.\nDistribution and   of Total Income\nFor public sector banks, the proportion of fee-based\nan average 6.25 per cent, while for new private sector\nper cent respectively. Table 1 shows the percentage of\nincome coming from fee-based activities for the three\ngroups of banks considered in this study. As shown in\nTable 1, the percentage of fee-based income (commis-\nsion, exchange, and brokerage) in total income for\npublic sector banks has fallen marginally from 6.67\nBoth private sector banks (new) and foreign banks have\nbeen active in generating a considerable amount of\ntheir income from fee-based services.

For foreign banks, percentage of fee-based income\n(commission, exchange and brokerage) in total income\nTable 2 gives the percentage of `interest income' and\n`other income' in total income for the three groups of\nbanks considered for the study. As seen from the table,\nthe percentage of non-interest income in total income\nfor public sector banks has increased from 13.71 per\nbanks (old), there has been a rise from 10.53 per cent in\nthe percentage of non-interest income in total income\ncent in 2011. For foreign banks, share of non-interest\nEvidently, while for all banks, the share of non-interest\nincome in the total income has increased over this\nperiod, the same cannot be said about the proportion of\nfee-income in total income which has increased mark-\nedly only for new private and foreign banks. Table 3\nshows the share of fee income in non-interest income\nand diversification in non-interest income for different\nbank groups, and Table 4 gives the diversification scores\nfor the different groups and their Z scores. It may be\nseen that diversification of total income for public sector\nbanks stand at around 0.23 (DIV1) suggesting a moder-\nately diversified portfolio with low variability in diver-\nsification between banks in this group. The diversifica-\ntion of total income for private banks (new) is slightly\nbetter at 0.3, and while for foreign banks, it is around\n0.34 (DIV1), the variability in diversification between\nbanks in this group is much higher. Private banks (old)\nhave a moderately diversified portfolio again (DIV1 at\n0.22) with higher variability in diversification compared\nto public sector and new private sector banks. Z scores\ngiving risk-adjusted performance are the highest for\npublic sector banks (6.98) though with high variability\nbetween banks in the group. While foreign banks have\nlow Z scores at 1.54, the variability of risk-adjusted\nperformance is also lower than for other bank groups.\nIt may also be seen from Table 5 that for the Indian\nbanking industry as a whole, the share of non-interest\nincome in the total income (SH\nNON\ncent with a maximum of 51 per cent. Again the share\nof fee income in total income (SH\nFEE\n) is 9 per cent for\nthe industry.\nDistribution and   of Non-interest\nIncome\nIt is also observed that the share of `fee income' in\nnon-interest income stands at an average of 46 per\ncent for the Indian banking industry (Table 3). This\nimplies that the distribution of non-interest income\nis in favour of an increasing share of fee income, also\ncorroborated for the different bank groups as seen in\nTable 5. The diversification in total income stands at\n0.27 implying a moderately diversified portfolio for\nthe Indian banks. However, diversification in non-in-\nterest income is quite high at 0.39, implying a greater\ndiversification of non-interest income compared to\ntotal income (Table 3). Looking once again at Table\n5, it is observed that public sector banks not only\ngenerate much of their non-interest income from `fee\nTable 2: `Interest Income' as % of Total Income (SH\nIN\n) and `Other Income' as % of Total Income (SH\nNON\n)\nPublic sector banks\nSH\nIN\nSH\nNON\nPrivate sector banks (new)\nSH\nIN\nSH\nNON\nPrivate sector banks (old)\nSH\nIN\nSH\nNON\nForeign banks\nSH\nIN\nSH\nNON\nSource: RBI database, CMIE database, and ACE Equity database.\nTable 3: Descriptives of Predictor and Control Variables\nVariable N Mean Standard Deviation Minimum Maximum\nPredictor Variables\nSH\nNON\nSH\nFEE\nSH\nFOT\nControl Variables\nTable 4:   Scores and Z Scores for Different\nBank Groups\nBank Group DIV 1 DIV 2 Z SCORE\nPublic sector banks\nPrivate sector banks (new)\nPrivate sector banks (old)\nForeign banks\nsenting a moderately diversified portfolio for the banks\nin India.   in non-interest income stands\nThe share of income coming from commission, exchange\nand brokerage activities averages around 9 per cent for\nbanks in India while the share of income contributed by\nnon-fund based activities together averages around 11\nper cent for Indian banks (Table 3).

There are\ntwo distinct ways in which this article tries to add\nto the existing body of literature. First, it tries to see\nthe impact of diversification in non-interest income\nseparately from diversification in total income. The\nrationale behind this is the fact that the major compo-\nnents of non-interest income in recent years have come\nfrom innovative income streams and gestation of new\nproducts and services which have all contributed to\nincreasing `fee income' and consequent diversifica-\ntion of non-interest income. This is in keeping with\nglobal and Indian studies that have focused sepa-\nrately on fee-income based diversification and other\nnon-interest income based diversification strategies\nSecond, while the results show a positive impact of\ndiversification for profitability, the article underlines\nthat the impact direction of diversification in total\nincome on risk-adjusted measures clearly suggests the\nneed to choose stable sources of fee-income for future.\nMoreover, the diversification in non-interest income\nmay not impact profitability and risk-adjusted income\npositively as discussed.\nEvidently, for foreign and private sector banks (new)\na greater proportion of income comes from fee-based\nactivities, compared to public sector banks. However,\nas seen in the empirical results, while diversification\nand increasing share of fee-income in total income\npositively impact ROA, the impact on ROE or other\nrisk-adjusted performance measures is not statistically\nsignificant. Moreover, the impact direction of diversi-\nfication measures may be negative, which is in agree-\nment to what many studies have shown in the US,\nEuropean, Australian and Indian context (De Young &\n2006). The results suggest that while public sector banks\nneed to generate more income from fee-based activities,\nit would be imperative to choose sources of fee-based\nincome that remain stable and have a positive impact\non risk-adjusted measures.\nThe choice of income streams from which non-interest\nincome can be generated under these circumstances\nbecomes relevant. Encouragingly, greater proportion\nof `fee-income' in non-interest income impacts posi-\ntively both profitability and risk-adjusted performance\nmeasures. However, diversification of non-interest\nincome may, in fact, negatively impact profitability or\nstability of income. Economic literature points out that\nthe impact of fee-based income and other components\nof non-interest income, especially trading income, will\nbe different on stability of income. Gamra and Plihon\n(2011), for example, show that fee income can generate\nsome improvement in the risk-adjusted measures,\nwhile trading income imply lower performance as\nmeasured by risk-adjusted returns. Stiroh and Rumble\n(2006) point to trading income as the most volatile\npart of the non-interest income. Again, for fee-based\nincome, the choice of new products or streams can\ndetermine the likely stability of income. Umakrishnan\nand Bandopadhyay (2005) also point out in the Indian\ncontext that investment income is the most volatile\nacross all ownership groups.\nCONCLUSION\nThe article looks at the impact of new business lines and\nincome streams on banks' profitability and stability. It is\nclear that adoption of innovations leading to new busi-\nness lines confront certain barriers even as these evolve\nfrom gestation to implementation. Globally, the impact\nof adoption of these income streams and the consequent\ndiversification, on profitability and stability of income\nfor banks has not been clear.\nIn Indian banking, the move to innovation adoptions\nand new income streams has been more pronounced\nfor new private and foreign banks, while there appears\nto have been certain hesitation on the part of public\nsector and old private banks. The study points out that\nwhile the impact of diversification of both total income\nand `non-interest' income (encapsulating newer income\nstreams) on profitability is positive and significant, the\nother impact on stability is not. However, profitability\nmay not have become a driving force behind strategic\nshifts in business orientation of banks, particularly in\nrespect of adoption of innovations. In such regards,\nconcerns over the stability of income from non-interest\nincome sources may be a significant economic barrier\nto innovation adoption. The implications of the study\nmay be that banks adopting new income streams\nmust choose those that are likely to enhance stability\nof income. As seen in the article, the distribution of\nnon-interest income can significantly impact stability\nof income as increasing `fee-income' in non-interest\nincome may have a positive impact on risk-adjusted\nperformance. Trading income, an important compo-\nnent of non-interest income, seems to be more volatile\nwhile core service income or the fee, commision and\nbrokerage income generated from provision of new\nproducts and services may lead to greater stability in\nincome. Future research needs to delve deeper into\nthese aspects of innovation led businesses that banks\nmay consider for adoption.\nDIRECTION\nThe study has confined itself to finding the impact of\nincreasing diversification on performance for banks in\nIndia, and has not delved into the impact separately\nfor different bank groups. This could be an important\ndirection of research in future. Further, on acccount of\ndata being unavailable on the various components of\nnon-interest and fee income, the impact of increasing\nshare of various components of fee-based income on\nprofitabiltiy and stability could not be analysed, which\nneeds to be looked into in future. This will help in\nunderstanding which components of fee-income can\ncontribute to profitability and stabiltiy for banks.\nNOTES\n1 Oxford Dictionaries (innovation).Accessed on 10 February\n2013 through oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/\ninnovation\n2 The incomes included in `commission, exchange and\nbrokerage' include trade finance related services; payment\nand money transmission services; fund management\nservices; financial consultancy and advisory services;\nunderwriting services; clearing and settlement services;\nderivative, stock, securities, foreign exchange trading\n3 Net profit (loss) on sale of investments; Net profit (loss) on\nrevaluation of investments; Net profit (loss) on sale of land\nand other asset; Net profit (loss) on exchange transactions\nand miscellaneous income.\n4 IBAcategorizes nationalized banks and State Bank of India\nand its Associates together as public sector banks.\n5 RBI data classifies Scheduled Commercial Banks in India\ninto five different groups according to their ownership\nand/or nature of operation, as under: (i) State Bank of\nIndia and its Associates, (ii) Nationalized Banks, (iii)\nPrivate Sector Banks, (iv) Foreign Banks and (v) Regional\nRural Banks.
