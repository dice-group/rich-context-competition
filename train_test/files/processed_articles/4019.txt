Modification of these\nrisk factors has been shown to reduce car-\ndiovascular morbidity and mortality.\nGlucose control, especially in patients\nwith T2DM, is associated with decreased\ncardiovascular morbidity and mortality.1\nAlthough some large randomized con-\ntrolled studies have shown that intensive\nblood glucose control does not improve car-\ndiovascular mortality in patients with long-\nterm diabetes and cardiovascular risks,\nextended studies have shown some benefit\nin cardiovascular events with intensive con-\ntrol.2\u00ad4 Specifically, early intensive glucose\ncontrol in patients with newly diagnosed di-\nabetes resulted in cardiovascular benefits\nthat continued after 10 years in the United\nKingdom Prospective Diabetes Study\n(UKPDS).5 Thus, intensive glucose control\nfrom the early stage of diabetes is very im-\nportant to prevent vascular complications.\nHowever, the exact mechanisms of how to\nreduce the incidence of cardiovascular dis-\nease by intensive control of hyperglycemia\nremain unknown.\nArterial stiffness, the pulse wave velocity\n(PWV), and central blood pressure are pre-\ndictors of cardiovascular morbidity and\nmortality.6 T2DM is one factor that\nincreases arterial stiffness. A study in\nChina showed a positive association be-\ntween glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and\narterial stiffness in patients with T2DM.7\nAnother study showed that patients with\nT2DM and hypertension have greater arte-\nrial stiffness than patients with either\nT2DM or hypertension.8 However, whether\nglycemic control in patients with T2DM\nimproves arterial stiffness has not been de-\ntermined. The purpose of the present study\nwas to evaluate the change in arterial stiff-\nness with glucose control and identify\nchanges in inflammation and oxidative\nstress markers that may be influenced by\narterial stiffness. Thus, we attempted to de-\ntermine the direct effect of glucose control\non arterial stiffness as an indicator of car-\ndiovascular disease.\nMethods\nStudy design and patients\nThis study was performed at St. Paul's\nHospital Diabetes Center at the Catholic\nUniversity of Korea (Seoul, Korea). The\ninclusion criteria were the presence of\nT2DM, a diabetes duration of <10 years,\nhypertensive medication. Patients who re-\nceived medications that influenced their\nblood glucose level (e.g., steroids) and\nthose with a serum creatinine level of\n>1.5 mg/dL, anemia, hepatic disease, ische-\nmic heart disease, congestive heart failure\n(New York Heart Association class 2), or\nsevere diabetic complications were exclud-\ned. Written informed consent was obtained\nfrom all patients before they participated in\nthe study. The consent form and study pro-\ntocol were approved by the hospital's ethi-\ncal review committee.\nPatients with uncontrolled blood glucose\nlevels (HbA1c > 9%) received insulin, oral\nhypoglycemic agents (metformin, sulfonyl-\nurea, alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, or dipep-\ntidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor), or combined\ninsulin and oral agents for 3 months.\nAfter the 3-month blood glucose-lowering\nintervention, the patients were divided into\ntwo groups according to their HbA1c level\nat 12 weeks: the well-controlled group\n(HbA1c < 7%) and the uncontrolled group\n(HbA1c ! 7%). We compared the arterial\nstiffness index, PWV, central blood pres-\nsure, and markers of inflammation and ox-\nidative stress between the two groups before\nand after improvement in glycemic control.\nMeasurements\nAll patients underwent a standard physical\nexamination and routine clinical laboratory\ntests. Arterial blood pressure was measured\ntwice in the right arm using a mercury\nsphygmomanometer in the morning when\npatients were resting, and the mean systolic\nand diastolic pressures were calculated.\nThe body mass index was calculated as\nbody weight divided by the square of the\nheight (kg/m2).\nArterial stiffness\nArterial stiffness was measured using an\napplanation tonometer (SphygmoCor;\nAtCor Medical Inc., Sydney, Australia).\nOne examiner measured the PWV, augmen-\ntation index, and central blood pressure\nbefore and after the 3-month glucose-\nlowering intervention.\nLaboratory measurements\nAfter an overnight fast, venous blood sam-\nples were obtained from each patient. The\nfasting glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol,\ntriglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol levels were measured using stan-\ndard techniques.\nAdiponectin, interleukin-6, C-reactive\nprotein, and plasminogen activator\ninhibitor-1\nMorning blood samples were collected from\neach patient before and after the study fol-\nlowing overnight fasting. Serum samples\nwere immediately frozen and stored at\n\u00c070C until analysis.\nAdiponectin was measured by enzyme-\nlinked immune assay (ELISA) (R&D\nSystems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) accord-\ning to the manufacturer's instructions. The\nlevels of interleukin (IL)-6 (Cayman\nChemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI,\nUSA), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein\n(hs-CRP) (Abnova, Taipei City, Taiwan),\nand plasminogen activator inhibitor\n(PAI)-1 (R&D Systems) were measured\nusing an ELISA kit.\nUrinary 8-hydroxy-20-deoxyguanosine\nAfter an overnight fast, morning urine sam-\nples were collected from each patient before\nand after the study. Urine samples were\nstored at \u00c070C until analysis. Urinary 8-\nhydroxy-20-deoxyguanosine (8-OHDG) was\nmeasured using a commercial ELISA kit\n(Cayman Chemical Company).\nStatistical analysis\nBaseline clinical characteristics were com-\npared between the two groups.\nContinuous variables are expressed as\nmean \u00c6 standard deviation. Univariate sta-\ntistical analysis was performed using the\nMann\u00adWhitney U test for continuous inde-\npendent samples and the chi-square test for\ncategorical variables. Repeated-measures\nanalysis of variance using a hierarchical\nlinear model was performed to analyze\nchanges in the central hemodynamic\nparameters, PWV, and markers of oxidative\nstress and inflammation in each group.\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS for Windows, version 11.0 (SPSS\nInc., Chicago, IL, USA). A P value of\n<0.05 was considered to indicate a statisti-\ncally significant difference with a 95% con-\nfidence interval.\nResults\nEighty patients were enrolled. Sixteen\npatients were excluded because they were\nlost to follow-up or withdrew consent.\nSixty-four patients completed the study.\nThe patients' baseline characteristics are\nsummarized in Table 1. The mean age was\nlevel was 11.7%. Twenty-eight patients\n(44%) were included in the well-controlled\nuncontrolled group according to the\nHbA1c level at 12 weeks. The blood pres-\nsure levels were not different between the\ntwo groups. However, the mean\nduration of T2DM was significantly shorter\nin the well-controlled than uncontrolled\nBaseline measurements of the PWV, aug-\nmentation index, and other arterial stiffness\nmarkers were not different except for the\ncentral aortic pulse pressure and augmenta-\ntion pressure. The pulse pressure and aug-\nmentation pressure were significantly lower\nin the well-controlled than uncontrolled\nly) (Table 2). There were also no differences\nin the baseline levels of inflammation\nmarkers (hs-CRP and IL-6), adiponectin,\nPAI-1, and urinary 8-OHDG between the\ntwo groups.\nAfter 12 weeks, the mean HbA1c level\nwas 6.1% in the well-controlled group and\n9.0% in the uncontrolled group. Table 3\nshows the changes in the arterial stiffness\nindexes between the two groups. There\nwere no between-group differences in the\nchanges in the arterial stiffness indexes\nexcept for the central aortic pulse pressure\nand augmentation pressure, which were\nmaintained at a lower level in the well-\ncontrolled than uncontrolled group\nThere were no significant changes in the\nPWV or aortic augmentation index.\nThe markers of oxidative stress and\ninflammation, including the urinary\n8-OHDG, hs-CRP, IL-6, PAI-1, and adipo-\nnectin levels, did not improve in the\nTable 1.

In addition, the markers of inflam-\nmation and oxidative stress did not change\naccording to the patients' post-treatment\nglycemic status after treatment.\nSome studies have reported an associa-\ntion between arterial stiffness and glycemic\nchanges. Yamamoto et al.9 reported that a\n2-week admission program in patients with\nT2DM improved the brachial-ankle PWV\n(baPWV) and metabolic status. In particu-\nlar, the baPWV was significantly associated\nwith the systolic blood pressure and fasting\nglucose level. Tomiyama et al.10 conducted\na 3-year observational study of a middle-\naged Japanese male cohort and reported\nsynergistic acceleration of the baPWV in\nsubjects with both a raised blood pressure\nand raised plasma glucose level compared\nwith subjects with either a raised blood\npressure or plasma glucose level alone.\nHowever, these studies did not directly eval-\nuate whether glucose control improved the\narterial stiffness indexes. Additionally, they\nmeasured peripheral artery indexes, not\ncentral artery indexes.\nIn the present study, no change was ob-\nserved in the central arterial stiffness index-\nes according to the patients' glucose control\nstatus for 12 weeks. Although arterial stiff-\nness is an outcome of chronic progressive\ndiabetes, we established a 12-week treat-\nment period because the above-mentioned\nstudy by Yamamoto et al.9 showed im-\nprovement of the baPWV and metabolic\nstatus within a shorter period of intensive\ntreatment (2 weeks). However, 12 weeks of\nglucose control may be insufficient for ob-\nserving a change in arterial stiffness. In the\nUKPDS, the cardiovascular benefit of in-\ntensive glucose control became apparent\nthat intensive blood glucose control re-\nduced cardiovascular events after a mean\nfollow-up of 5.6 years.12 Thus, short-term\nglycemic control might be insufficient for\nchanging the cardiovascular indexes.\nHowever, T2DM was independently\nTable 4.

This finding\nmay have been significant if the duration of\nthe well-controlled state had been longer.\nSchnell et al.16 conducted a cluster-\nrandomized study in the primary care\nsetting and reported that a reduction in\nthe hs-CRP level by 12 months was associ-\nated with a reduction in the HbA1c level.\nThe other inflammation markers, IL-6 and\nPAI-1, were also not different between the\ngroups. Diabetes-associated hyperglycemia\npromotes oxidative stress mediated by reac-\ntive oxygen formation and the carbonyl\ngroup.17 However, the levels of urinary\n8-OHDG and oxidative stress markers in\nthe well-controlled group also did not\ndiffer from those in the uncontrolled\ngroup after treatment. Another reason for\nthe lack of differences between the groups is\nthat all patients received glucose-lowering\ntreatment. Therefore, the HbA1c levels of\nthe two groups were significantly lower\nthan those at baseline. This may have\nmade it difficult to detect differences be-\ntween the two groups.\nIn the comparison of the parameters be-\ntween baseline and 12 weeks, the data of\nboth groups had deteriorated after 12\nweeks of treatment. With the exception of\nthe hs-CRP level, this finding is inconsistent\nwith previous studies. Regardless of the\nsubstantial improvement in the HbA1c\nlevel in the well-controlled group, the in-\nflammatory and oxidative stress markers\ntended to deteriorate. However, these\nchanges were not significant. We considered\nthat these results might have been caused by\nthe small number of patients and the fact\nthat 12 weeks was too short for correction\nof the insulin resistance. Additionally, the\ndifferent treatment modalities (various anti-\ndiabetic drugs, various antihypertensive\ndrugs, and insulin injection) might have\ninfluenced the patients' insulin resistance.\nThe central pulse pressure is a predictive\nrisk factor for cardiovascular morbidity be-\ncause it reflects systolic afterload.18,19 The\naugmentation pressure also predicts major\ncardiovascular events and death indepen-\ndently of the pulse pressure.20 At baseline,\nthe well-controlled group had a shorter di-\nabetic duration and lower pulse pressure\nand augmentation pressure than the uncon-\ntrolled group. The pulse pressure and aug-\nmentation pressure were still lower than\nthose in the uncontrolled group after treat-\nment. These findings are plausible because\nearly glucose control helps to delay cardio-\nvascular morbidity.\nConclusion\nThis study showed a significant difference\nnot in arterial stiffness according to the\nchange in the HbA1c level but in the dia-\nbetic duration between the well-controlled\ngroup and uncontrolled group. There are\ntwo major limitations of this study. The\nfirst is the short follow-up period used for\nevaluation of the arterial stiffness, which is\na known outcome of chronic progressive\ndiabetes. Thus, the results are not\napplicable to patients with long-term glyce-\nmic control. The second limitation is the\nsmall number of patients in whom the dif-\nferences in the change in arterial stiffness\nwere observed. The minor limitation is a\nresult of the indiscriminate use of various\noral hypoglycemic agents to correct the hy-\nperglycemia. Some drugs (e.g., dipeptidyl\npeptidase-4 inhibitors) may influence arteri-\nal stiffness by improving endothelial dys-\nfunction. However, the results of this\nstudy may suggest that intensive treatment\nto ensure good glycemic control from the\nearly diabetic stage is important to improve\nthe increased cardiovascular risk in patients\nwith T2DM.\nAuthors' contributions\nSA Chang and JM Lee designed the study; JH\nKim, SA Chang, TS Sohn, and JM Lee per-\nformed the research; SA Chang and HS Son an-\nalyzed the data; and SA Change wrote the paper.\nAll authors read and approved the final\nmanuscript.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by an unrestricted\ngrant from Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Korea.\nNo other potential conflicts of interest rele-\nvant to this article were reported.\nReferences\n1.
