J., and N. B. Bliss, Changes in population and agricultural land in conterminous United States counties, 1790\n1. Introduction\n[2] The conversion of forests and grasslands for agricul-\ntural uses has stimulated the release of carbon from soils to\nthe atmosphere. Subsequent abandonment of cropland,\nallowing it to revert to forest or grassland, may enhance\nthe sequestration of carbon in the soil. A detailed under-\nstanding of the effects of land conversion on carbon\nsequestration is needed to understand the historical pattern\nof human influences on the global carbon cycle. A more\ncomplete understanding of the global carbon budget, based\non an understanding of the physical, biological, and human\nprocesses that are involved, is essential for developing\nappropriate carbon management strategies and policies.\nOne way to achieve greater precision is to perform analyses\nof land conversion that cover large areas with smaller spatial\nunits and incorporate data at additional points in time.\n[3] The data set presented in this paper shows changes in\npopulation and agricultural land for the conterminous United\nStates at the county level. Previous compilations were based\non state-level data and have less spatial detail. There have\nbeen many changes in county boundaries through time, and\nwe attached census statistics to the appropriate county\nboundaries for each census year. We focused on data for\npopulation and area of cropland because they are most\nrelevant to our study of the impact of land conversion on\nthe carbon cycle. The land-use patterns reflected in these\ndata should be useful to physical and biological scientists.\nThe database linkages may be useful to social scientists who\nare interested in attaching additional socioeconomic data\nfrom the census to the spatial framework.\n[4] A disturbance of the soil such as plowing, breaks up\nthe original soil structure, exposes the soil to oxygen, and\ncauses a decrease in the organic carbon content of the soil.\nDecreases of 20 to 40% of the soil organic carbon may\noccur following cultivation, with most of the decrease\noccurring in the first 20 years [Davidson and Ackerman,\ncarbon were most likely due to poor agricultural practices\nthat did not maintain soil fertility and did not prevent\nerosion. When the consequences of poor agricultural prac-\ntices became evident, farmers began to retain plant residue,\nuse fertilizers, and prevent erosion. In some areas, these\nimproved practices have maintained the inputs from net\nprimary production at high enough levels to allow some\nrecovery of soil carbon on agricultural lands. A complete\nmodel of the impacts of land conversion on soil carbon will\nrequire information from field studies of historical trends of\nsoil organic carbon.\nThis paper is not subject to U.S. copyright.\nPublished in 2002 by the American Geophysical Union.\n[5] To get a full understanding of the influence of these\nchanges on levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, it is also\nnecessary to have an understanding of the spatial extent of\nthe land in cropland. The data set presented here provides a\nnew level of spatial detail for the history of agricultural land\nuse in the conterminous United States. Taken together, the\nfield-based process studies that give site-specific histories of\nthe amounts of soil carbon and the spatial databases that\nshow the timing of conversion to cropland will allow\ndetailed modeling of the influences of land-use change on\natmospheric CO2\n. This will contribute to the requirement\nidentified by the National Research Council Committee on\nGlobal Change Research [1999], which stated, ``An histor-\nical record from the beginning of the industrial era is needed\nto assess the effects of land-use change on climate and the\ncarbon cycle.''\n[6] Recent estimates of the global carbon budget show\nthat terrestrial ecosystems appear to have been a net source\nto the atmosphere during the period from 1850 to\natmosphere from fossil fuel burning and cement production,\nand 136 (\u00b155) Pg C was released from land-use change,\nprimarily deforestation. The atmosphere retained 176 (\u00b110)\nPg C removed from the atmosphere is estimated to be\nevenly split between the oceans and terrestrial ecosystems\n[Watson et al., 2000]. Over the period, terrestrial systems\nthey absorbed.\n[7] Several databases have been developed that are useful\nfor analyzing relationships between land-cover change and\nthe global carbon cycle. Previous work in constructing land-\nuse histories for global change studies [Houghton and\newijk, 2001] have used state-level data sources. The county-\nlevel data set presented in this paper provides a capability for\nmore detailed analysis than is possible using state-level data.\nstocks and fluxes, including analysis of cropland change,\nfor nine continental-scale regions. Houghton and Hackler\n[2000b] have also used a cohort model to evaluate carbon\nuptake and release from agriculture and forestry in the\nconterminous United States. The model calculated the total\nwhich they attributed 29 Pg C to a decrease in the area of\nforests and woodlands. Their analysis of CO2\nfluxes due to\nland-use change was sensitive to the level of spatial dis-\naggregation, and they were more confident in their results\nwhen they used seven regions rather than considering the\nentire United States as one region. They concluded that\nknowing the spatial distribution of historical land-use\nchange is important for extrapolating the results of site-\nspecific CO2\nmeasurements to larger regions.\n[9] Ramankutty and Foley [1999] reconstructed a crop-\nset with a spatial resolution of 5 min of latitude and\nlongitude. They also modeled areas of grasslands and\nabandoned lands. For the United States portion, they used\nstate-level census data on improved farmland and cropland\nderived from remotely sensed sources, as well as a data set\nof potential vegetation to represent conditions prior to\nhuman settlement. They used a simple land-cover change\nmodel to extrapolate backwards from the 1992 land cover to\nthe potential vegetation, constrained by the historical crop\ndata for each political unit. For the United States, they made\nadjustments for the change in definition between plowable\npasture and cropland used for pasture by applying ratios\ncomputed from data in the 1940s back through time to\n1850. The effect was to develop a smoothed time series with\na definition of total cropland that included a component for\n``cropland used for pasture,'' rather than the more broadly\ndefined ``plowable pasture'' category.\n[10] The History Database of the Global Environment\n(HYDE, version 2.0) includes historical cropland maps,\nrepresented on a grid with a resolution of 0.5\u00b0 longitude\nand latitude [Klein Goldewijk, 2001]. The maps were\nformed by allocating national and subnational cropland\nand pastureland statistics to the grid using global data sets\nof historical population and land cover. The methods use\ndifferent data sets for current and historical land cover than\nused by Ramankutty and Foley [1999], and the allocation\nfrom political units to grid cells is based on population\nrather than land cover. For the United States portion, the\nstate-level historical cropland statistics were obtained by\npersonal communication from Ramankutty. Klein Goldewijk\n[2001] recognized some of the limitations of using popula-\ntion data as a basis for allocating land-use statistics from\npolitical units onto a uniform grid and concluded with a\ncomment that the scientific community ``could clearly\nbenefit from the translation of more historical statistical\ninformation into a digital (spatial) format.''\n[11] The work reported in this paper was undertaken as a\npart of the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Mississippi\nBasin Carbon Project (MBCP). The focus of the MBCP is\nto investigate the impacts of erosion and sedimentation on\nthe balance between carbon in the soil and in the atmos-\nand in a specific time period, carbon sequestration occurs if\nthere is a net storage of atmospheric carbon in the ecosys-\ntem, particularly the soil. Conversely, changes in land\nmanagement may cause a release of soil carbon to the\natmosphere. The carbon transfers are often in the form of\ncarbon dioxide or methane, which are greenhouse gases,\nand thus relevant to the analysis of factors contributing to\nglobal climate change. Measurements and modeling being\nconducted in MBCP studies address the hypothesis that part\nof this reduction may be due to a direct transfer of CO2\nto\nthe atmosphere as the soil carbon is oxidized by microbial\nprocesses, and another part may be moved by erosion and\nredeposited lower on the landscape. The environment in\ndepositional areas may result in a lower rate of microbial\nrespiration than would have occurred in the undisturbed\necosystem, so that the release rates to the atmosphere are not\nas large as would have occurred if erosion and deposition\nwere ignored. If the hypothesis is correct, then previous\nestimates may have overestimated the contribution of land-\nuse change to the buildup of carbon in the atmosphere.\n[12] Carbon sequestration and release can only be calcu-\nlated for defined periods in time. An adequate understand-\ning of the processes requires a historical view, in which a\nsequence of time periods is evaluated [Sundquist, 1993]. To\nevaluate the timing of land conversion into agriculture, we\nhave brought together the census data and the related\ncounty-boundary data. Additional processing of the time\nseries presented here will be needed to construct interpola-\ntions and extrapolations into more detailed categories of\nland disturbance. We will use the timing of land-use con-\nversions as input to a model of ecosystem carbon dynamics\nthat is able to account for erosion and deposition. The model\nis able to replicate the decline or recovery of soil carbon\nwith land-use change and account for the impacts of soil\nerosion and deposition on the simulated carbon content of\nsoil through time [S. Liu, personal communication, 2001].\nThe data on the timing of land conversion will contribute to\nmodeling historic erosion rates; these erosion rates and land-\nuse change can then be used as inputs to modeling historical\ncarbon cycling.\n[13] In the conterminous United States, a census of\ninformation on agricultural land use has been collected\nstatistics have been published for each county for these\ntime periods. A county is a subdivision of a state, and the\nstates subdivide the country. Land areas that were annexed\noften became territories before becoming states. The terri-\ntory, state, and county boundaries changed through time as\nthe country expanded and developed. Boundary changes\nwere frequent in the early years, with shifts, mergers, and\nsplits, but the boundaries became more stable about 1920.\nmeridian typically being smaller than those to the west. We\nhave obtained digital data for the historical county bounda-\nries and for the census attributes related to agricultural land\nareas. The data were edited for consistency with original\nsources, spatial data were linked to tabular data, and\nintegrated data sets and maps were produced, resulting in\na spatial-temporal database.\n2. Data Sources\n2.1. Spatial Data Sources\n2.1.1. Louisiana State University Historic County\nBoundary Files\n[14] Data on historic county boundaries were purchased\nfrom Louisiana State University (LSU) [Earle and Cao,\ngraphic information system. The level of accuracy was\ndescribed as being ``excellent at the national level and good\nat the regional level.'' The LSU boundaries were used with\n2.1.2. USGS County Boundary File\n[15] A USGS county boundary data set (CTY2M here-\nUSGS data set because it included a better definition of\ncoastlines. The data include the Federal Information Pro-\ncessing Standards (FIPS) code, a five-digit state and\ncounty code that was first assigned in 1972. A FIPS code\nconsists of a numeric state code (two digits) and county\ncode (three digits).\n2.2. Tabular Data Sources\nchased from the Inter-university Consortium for Political\nand Social Research (ICPSR) [1999]. The county-level\ndecadal data used from this source were as follows:\ncategories of agricultural area by county.\n[17] This data set did not include population or agricul-\ntural area counts for areas that had not achieved statehood\nby the given census date, such as territories and Indian\nreservations. We coded these numbers when they were\npublished by the census as tables, text, or footnotes.\n2.2.2. Economic Research Service\n[18] A data set with county agricultural land area for\nfrom the National Archives [Economic Research Service,\n2.2.3. Census of Agriculture and National Agriculture\nStatistical Service\nstarting in 1997 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,\nNational Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA) [1999].\nData for the previous years in the time series are often\nincluded in the later releases. Because corrections may be\nincluded, we used the most recent source possible in\npreference to the original year of publication.\n[U.S. Census, 1946]. We keyed three pasture variables for\nand 1990 were extracted from a commercial source [Geo-\n3. Methods\n[21] The data were processed using the Arc/Info geo-\ngraphic information system software [ESRI, 2000]. We\ndeveloped a routine in the Arc/Edit subsystem that made\nit possible to load the LSU files into Arc/Info. For each\ndecade, the files of county-level data for each state were\njoined into a single spatial data set for the conterminous\nUnited States. Boundary discrepancies, such as overlaps and\nundershoots, were eliminated by selecting a single arc to\nboundary discrepancies of less than 5 km2 were resolved.\nWith the addition of the larger counties in the west after\nwere run for label errors and topology errors, such as\nunclosed polygons.\n[22] The LSU files contain state and county names. The\nstates had a county named Washington. A unique identifier\nwas formed with the state abbreviation and county name\nfields appended together, all uppercase (for example,\n3.1.2. Editing the Modern County Boundary Data\n[23] Most of the county boundary changes occurred\nbefore 1930, but a few counties dissolved, split, or changed\nafter that date. The FIPS code was used as the primary\nidentifier for relating the spatial data to the census data.\nAppendix A.\n[24] The census data for Virginia cities and Washington,\nD. C. are sometimes lumped into the surrounding counties.\nThe appropriate edits were made to the LSU and CTY2M\ndata sets for each decade or 5-year interval.\n[25] There can be multiple spatial polygons for each\ncounty, often owing to islands. For each time period, geo-\ngraphic information system tools were used to build a new\nrelational table, called a region table, with only one record\nper county. The census data were attached to the region\ntable. For making maps, the population or farmland was\nassumed to be uniformly distributed across a county.\n[26] Population and agricultural data from the three sour-\nces were extracted from the source files and loaded into\nArc/Info. State abbreviations were appended to county\nnames to make a unique identifier for matching with the\nspatial data.\n[27] The ICPSR data set sometimes used compound\nhistorical names, such as Orange/Mosquito County in\nFlorida, which was simply Orange County in the census\nvolumes. A new data field was defined to contain the name\nof the county as given in the original census volumes.\n3.2.2. Economic Research Service\n[28] The Economic Research Service data were in a single\nService, 1999]. The data were extracted and loaded into\nArc/Info using an array structure. In a data recovery at the\nNational Archives, 225 records had been lost. Comparison\nwith the ICPSR agricultural data showed that only data for\nClarke County, Alabama (FIPS code 01025), were missing,\nand we keyed these data from original census volumes [U.S.\nCensus of Agriculture CD-ROM [U.S. Census, 1991]. This\nCD-ROM contained preliminary data for 1987, which we\nfrom a National Agricultural Statistics Service CD-ROM\n[USDA, 1999]. In some cases, county data were not pub-\nlished if they would have disclosed information on the\noperations of an individual farm.\ncategory defined a consistent time series. In 1925 and later\nyears, the term improved land in farms was no longer used\nand the term ``cropland'' was introduced. The category\n``total cropland'' included the subcategories of harvested\ncropland, crop failure, idle cropland, cropland in summer\nfallow, and plowable pasture. We use the term ``improved\nfarmland'' to refer to the combined time series of improved\nland in farms and total cropland.\nand then the term ``cropland used for pasture'' was used. A\ndescribes the change: ``The 1940 figures are not strictly\nland used only for pasture, which has been plowed within 7\nyears. The 1940 figures include land pastured, which could\nhave been plowed and used for crops without additional\nclearing, drainage, or irrigation. This land may not have\n[32] A recent report from the Economic Research Service\n[USDA, 2000] notes, ``Cropland pasture and permanent\ngrassland pasture have not always been clearly distin-\nguished in agricultural surveys.'' Differences in definitions\nused by the census over time and geographic boundary\nchanges that may influence the interpretation of the maps\nare given in Appendix B. Many of the details of boundary\nchanges were based on the descriptions by Thorndale and\n3.3. Matching Tabular Data and Maps\n[33] The tabular data from census sources were matched\nwith the spatial data using the common identifier, consisting\nof the state abbreviation and county name in the earlier years,\nor the FIPS code in the later years. Fields for the common\nidentifier were added to both the census and the spatial\nsources. There were often discrepancies in the county names\nbetween the spatial and tabular data sources, requiring us to\ndevelop iterative procedures to match the data sets with each\nother. Discrepancies were resolved by using the names in the\noriginal census documents. Problems in the matching proc-\ness sometimes identified the need for additions or deletions\nof boundary lines in the spatial data.\n[34] The LSU delineations were used for the decades\nalso linked to the LSU spatial data. The agricultural data for\npresent were linked to the CTY2M spatial data using the\nFIPS code.\n[35] The printed census volumes were considered the\nprimary authority for tabular data. The primary authority\nfor many edits to the spatial data was the map guide to the\n[36] The match of the spatial data to the tabular data was\ntested from both directions. When records did not match,\nsome problems were identified beyond issues of spelling.\nCensus data sets sometimes include separate statistics for\nindependent cities, such as Virginia cities, Washington,\nD. C., and Baltimore. When separate data for cities were\npresent in the census data, delineations for the cities were\nincluded in the spatial data for that decade. If separate data\nfor cities were not provided because the counts were\nincluded with the surrounding counties, the city boundaries\nwere deleted.\n[37] After the iterative matching process was completed,\nthe census data were joined to the region table. Census\nenumerations that were reported in acres were converted to\nsquare meters. Ratios of the area of each land-use type, such\nas ``improved land in farms'' or ``harvested cropland,'' and\npopulation densities were calculated by dividing by the total\narea of a county. Although some census records provided a\ntotal area for a county, the area computed by the geographic\ninformation system was used as the basis for deriving ratios.\n[38] Population and agricultural land density maps were\ncreated for each variable for each census date to provide a\nvisual check on the matching process and the census\nnumbers. Anomalies were traced and previous steps\nrepeated as needed. If the land in farms for a county\nexceeded 120% of the county area, the boundary delinea-\ntions were verified and re-digitized. If a discrepancy was not\ncaused by digitizing, the acreage was verified.\n[39] Farms on the edges of counties frequently overlap\nwith one or more other counties. The Bureau of the Census\ncounted all the acres of a farm or ranch in the county of its\nheadquarters. In most areas of the country, the undercounts\nand overcounts recorded for a given county were most\nlikely equivalent. However, there were extreme cases in\nwhich the area in farms exceeded the area of the county. A\nnoticeable example occurs in Texas, where starting in 1900\nthere are more than 20 counties with large ranches that\nextend into adjacent counties. This condition also occurs in\nGrant County, Nebraska, starting in 1920. This agriculture\nand population database has not been tested for ``under-\ncounts,'' which could only be done by proof-reading the\ndata purchased from three sources. Blanks and zeros that\nseemed anomalous were verified with the census volumes.\n4. Results\n[40] The trend for population over time is given in Table 1\nand mapped in Figure 1. Population has increased over the\nperiod of the study, with 10-year rates of increase of\nnous United States are shown in Figure 2. Only some of the\ndata shown in Figure 2 are from the county-level time\nseries; other data are from national summaries. The time\nseries of total land in farms in Figure 2 shows a peak in\n1949, followed by a decline. The total area in farmland may\nbe sensitive to definitional changes relating to the inclusion\nof woodlands and rangeland. Specifically, federal land that\nis used for grazing by a permit is included in non-farm\ngrazing land, and federal land that is under the control of an\noperator through a lease is included in ``other pasture,'' a\npart of ``land in farms'' [U.S. Census, 1943b].\n[41] An indication of disturbance due to plowing, grazing,\nclearing, and other activities is provided by the record of\nimproved farmland, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 2, as well\nas the sets of maps in Figures 3 and 4 and the regional analysis\nTable 1.

A value of 1.00000 is a perfect match.\nFigure 1. Maps of population density (people per square kilometer) by county, 1790 to 1997, for the\nconterminous United States.\nin Figure 5. Figure 3 shows the county-level detail for 1850.\nIn Figure 4, the data are also at the county level, but county\nboundaries are not drawn. Areas of improved land, in farms\nafter), by state for selected years, are given in Table 2.\n4.1. Verification of the Time Series\n[42] Additional census volumes were used to verify\nindividual entries where there were apparent discrepancies\n[43] The population, farmland, improved farmland, and\ncropland national totals summed from the spatial data set\nwere compared with the published totals from the United\nStates Census, and representative results are shown in\ntotals were compared with the totals given by Dodd [1993]\nfor areas of improved farmland. The areas of total farm-\nland were compared with a census volume [U.S. Census,\nareas of total farmland and cropland were compared with\ncensus summary volumes for census years between 1974\nDuring the years since 1978, the area of total cropland\nsummed from the county data is less than the area reported\nin national totals by more than 1%. This difference may be\ndue to the impact of disclosure rules, in which the census\ndoes not report county values that could identify individual\nfarm operators. As farms become larger, more counties\nmay be affected by these disclosure rules.\n4.2. Regional Trends\n[44] Figure 5 shows the improved farmland or cropland\ntime series for the conterminous United States and for\nthree subregions, chosen to capture regional differences\nin the timing and intensity of agricultural development.\nThe subregions were defined for the Northeast, the\nSoutheast, and the Midwest-Great Plains, as shown in\nthe inset map in Figure 5. The trend shown in Figures 2\nFigure 2. Patterns of land use in the conterminous United States, 1850 to 1997 (cumulative area, km2).\nto 1997. Total land in farms has also been recorded since 1850. The categories shown, from bottom to\ntop, are 1: harvested cropland; 2: crop failure; 3: cropland idle; 4: cropland in cover crops; 5: cropland in\ncultivated summer fallow; 6: plowable pasture (1940 and before) or cropland used for pasture (1945 and\nafter); 7: other pasture; 8: farm woodland pastured; 9: farm woodland not pastured; 10: farm, special uses\nand other; 11: non-farm grazing on grassland; 12: non-farm grazing on forest land; 13: non-farm forest\nland not used for grazing; and 14: non-farm special uses and other. The line labeled ``improved farmland''\nis the cumulation of categories 1 through 6 representing cropland and plowable pasture, and is illustrated\nin the maps in Figures 3 and 4. The line labeled ``land in farms'' is the cumulation of the first 10\ncategories, and ``land area of the conterminous United States'' represents the cumulation of all categories.\nMultiple U.S. Census sources were used, and not all data are represented by our county-level time series.\nThe non-farm values were derived from U.S. Census [1989c] and Economic Research Service [USDA,\n2000]. Some values are interpolated or computed by subtraction.\nFigure 3. Map of the proportion of improved farmland by county, 1850, for the conterminous United States. See\nFigure 4 for the legend.\nFigure 4. Maps of the proportion of improved farmland by county for census years 1860 to 1997 for the\nconterminous United States.\nand 5 for the conterminous United States generally illus-\ntrates an increase in improved farmland and cropland from\nregional basis, the trend in the Northeast is a stronger\nincrease until a peak in 1880, and then a stronger decline\nthan in the other regions.

Data Availability\n[45] A time series for population and the combined time\nseries for improved land in farms and cropland are available\nfor download from the EROS Data Center. They have been\nspatially interpolated into the modern county boundaries.\nSome restrictions may apply to some of the original spatial\nand tabular data that would require users to obtain permis-\nsions from other sources.\n5. Discussion\n5.1. Economic and Technological Forces of Change\n[46] The patterns of agricultural development and decline\nthat are reflected in Figures 2\u00ad5 are the result of complex\ninteractions between the capabilities of the land, climate,\npopulation growth and migration, energy sources, trans-\nportation, general economic conditions, agricultural tech-\nnologies, and agricultural policy.\n[47] A useful framework for grouping the driving forces is\n[48] The migration of Europeans into port cities and the\ndiffusion of agriculture by conversion of Eastern forests to\ncropland were dominant in the early years. A forced migra-\ntion of slaves from Africa also contributed to population\ngrowth and the expansion of plantation agriculture in the\nSouth. The Appalachian Mountains were generally unsuit-\nable for agriculture and represented a physical barrier to\nwestern expansion. The development of canals and inland\nFigure 4. (continued)\ndeveloped west of the Appalachians to serve markets in\nthe East, with steamboats becoming important after 1830\n[Meinig, 1993]. Railroads began to surpass waterways for\ntransport in the 1860s and railroad ton-miles peaked between\nanthracite to bituminous coal [Borchert, 1967]. The propor-\ntion of improved farmland in the farm-dominated counties of\nthe Northeast region peaked in 1880 (Figure 5) as the\ntransportation system allowed the Eastern markets to be\nserved by agriculture on the better soils of the Ohio Valley\nand areas west of the Appalachians [Meyer, 1987]. The\ndevelopment of tile drainage allowed wetland areas near\nthe Great Lakes and in Iowa, Minnesota, and the Mississippi\nThe proportion of improved farmland in the Midwest and\nGreat Plains reached a high level in 1910 and remained fairly\nsteady through its peak in 1940, after which it stabilized with\na slight decline through 1997 (Figure 5). Major droughts\ninfluenced these patterns. The proportion of improved farm-\nland or cropland developed more slowly in the Southeast\ncompared to the nation as a whole, with a peak in 1920 being\nrepeated in 1940, after which the proportion declined sharply\n(Figure 5). The boll weevil had decimated the cotton crop\ndrawal had depleted the soils [Hart, 1967]. Many of the\nsouthern croplands were abandoned following the disinte-\ngration of the post-bellum sharecropping system, and often\ntractors, automobiles, rural electricity, and the development\nof federal highways influenced farming practices. Improve-\nments in yields resulted from fertilization, pesticides, and\ncrop genetics, guided by research funded by state and federal\ngovernments through the land grant universities [Edmond,\n1978]. The federal government also attempted to stabilize\neconomic cycles through controls on production linked to\nvided agricultural agencies [Lewis, 1987], and stimulated the\ndevelopment of irrigation in the western states [Meyer,\n1995]. Some variations in the time series may be due to\nother governmental policies, such as international agree-\nments for foreign agricultural trade, embargoes restricting\ntrade, and the introduction of the Conservation Reserve\nProgram and Wetland Reserve Program.\n5.2. Consistency of the Time Series\n[49] Our primary purpose was to assess disturbances on\nthe landscape that would affect the carbon content of soils.\nThe most consistent time series from these data are the\nbe influenced by definition and terminology changes in the\ncensus data. For example, land in the plowable pasture\ncategory may have never been plowed, whereas the ``crop-\nland used for pasture'' category implies that plowing had\nbeen previously done. These data cannot be used to con-\nsistently identify the portions of these pasture categories that\nwere actually plowed prior to a given census year.\n[50] The definition of a farm has changed nine times since\n1850 and, although this can affect whether a particular\nFigure 5. Proportion of improved farmland or cropland, 1850 to 1997, for the conterminous United\nStates and three subregions.\ncropland parcel is counted, in most cases this most likely has\nonly a small influence on the national results. For example,\nstarting in 1978, the threshold for defining a farm increased\ndefined as ``any place with less than ten acres from which\n$250 or more of agricultural products were sold or normally\nwould have been sold during the census year, or any place of\nten acres or more from which $50 or more of agricultural\nproducts were sold or normally would have been sold during\nthe census year'' [Hallberg, 2001]. This definitional change\nwould result in a reduction in the number of farms enum-\nerated by the census and would also tend to reduce the area\nof land in farms enumerated by the census. Yet, between\nfarms, so that the impact of the definitional changes seems to\nbe masked by the changes in land management.\n[51] Short-term disturbances occurring between census\nyears may not be reflected in these data. The census focused\non farmlands, but there are no comparable county-level data\non lands that are not in farms.\nTable 2. Area of Improved Land in Farms (for Years 1920 and Earlier) or Total Cropland (for Years 1925 and Later)a\nState\naBy state for selected dates.\n[52] Corrections to census data for a given year may be\nincluded in tables published with later censuses. Dodd [1993]\nstates that the published counts are most accurate when\nfarthest away from the decade of the count. We used the\nmost recent source when we keyed data, but did not verify if\nthis was consistently done in existing digital data sources.\n[53] Independent cities in Virginia are sometimes in-\ncluded in census data and sometimes not included, depend-\ning on the decade and the source. We matched the spatial\ndata with the census source for each census year, but the\nresult is not a smooth time series for some of these areas.\n6. Conclusions\n[54] We developed a database of changes in population and\nagricultural land, primarily from digital sources, to which we\nadded some revisions and corrections. The county-level data\nprovide more spatial detail than was previously available. For\nthe conterminous United States, the area in total cropland\npeaked in 1940, but this is a synthesis of underlying regional\ntrends. The total cropland area in the Northeast peaked in\n1880, after which transportation of agricultural goods from\nthe better soils of the Midwest and Great Plains became\ncompetitive. The Midwest and Great Plains total cropland\ndeveloped on many areas that were formerly cropland.\n[55] Although the database was developed to meet the\nneeds of our carbon modeling work, we expect that it may\nbe useful for other disciplines too. For the physical sciences,\nthe data may be useful for studies of hydrology, biogeog-\nraphy, and climate. For the social sciences, it may be useful\nfor studies of patterns of settlement, migration, and the\ninteractions of humans and the environment. Many other\ncensus attributes could be attached to the spatial data for\nstudies of ethnicity, religion, and demographics.\n[56] Future work in the MBCP will use these data to\nmodel the carbon dynamics on the landscape as influenced\nby land-use change. Although a full land-use history at the\ncounty level would be highly desirable, including forests,\ngrasslands, wetlands, and urban areas, its development will\nrequire sources of data other than the census.\n[57] Copies of the CTY2M data set were created, and minor\nedits were made to account for changes in county boundaries\nor names. This resulted in the following four spatial data sets,\ndesigned to match the census data for each period:\nwithout modification from the National Atlas source.\n2. In 1983, La Paz County, Arizona, was established from\npart of Yuma County. For the 1982 data set, the boundary\nwas removed, and the entire area was labeled Yuma.\n3. In 1979, the FIPS code for Sainte Genevieve, Missouri,\nwas changed. In 1981, Cibola County, New Mexico, was\nestablished from part of Valencia County. For the 1978 data\nset, the Cibola boundary was removed, and the entire area\nwas labeled Valencia.\n4. In the mid-1970s, Washabaugh County, South Dakota,\nwas merged into Jackson County, and Nansemond County,\ndata set, a boundary delineation was added to provide for\nWashabaugh County, South Dakota.\nAppendix B: Geographic and Definitional\nChanges\n[58] Changes in geographic boundaries and census defi-\nnitions that influence data interpretation are given here by\ndecade.\n[59] The United States consisted of the 13 original states\nplus the Southwest Territory (now Tennessee), the North-\nwest Territory (now Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan,\nWisconsin, and part of Minnesota), and the districts of\nKentucky, Maine, and Vermont. Some data exist for the\nSouthwest Territory, but none for the Northwest Territory.\nGeorgia covers what is now a three-state area, but there are\ndata for the eastern part only. South Carolina contains two\ncounties with no data (Cheraws and Orangeburg), and North\nCarolina also contains a parcel of Indian land with no data.\nSlaves were enumerated as whole persons.\n[60] Georgia included most of modern-day Mississippi\nand Alabama. There was also a Mississippi Territory in the\nsouthern part of Mississippi and Alabama, with population\nrecorded in three counties. Florida and the coastline of the\nGulf of Mexico belonged to Spain, as did the entire western\npart of mid-America. The Indiana Territory surrounded the\nwestern Great Lakes, and the Northwest Territory covered\nthe eastern half of the current Michigan and all of what is\nnow Ohio.\nwere included in the 1810 census only for the parts of the\narea that had been organized into territories. The census did\nnot include the coastal parts of the present states of Mis-\nsissippi and Alabama, which were claimed by both Spain\nand the United States and were known as ``Spanish West\nFlorida.'' Florida was also under Spanish jurisdiction.\nso it still belonged to Spain at the time of the 1820 census.\n[63] The Northwestern states were jointly occupied by the\nUnited States and Britain. Both countries also claimed parts\nof Vermont, Maine, and an area north of Maine in what is\nnow Canada. Florida was included in the census of 1830 as\na territory.\n[64] The census included inventories of farm animals and\ncrop production but not agricultural land areas.\n[65] For the first time, ``acres of land in farms'' were\nrecorded. The census included a category for improved\nland, defined as ``cleared and used for grazing, grass, or\ntillage, or which is now fallow, connected with or belonging\nto the farm.'' The ``unimproved land'' was defined as [U.S.\nCensus, 1853] ``. . .land connected with the farm. It is not\nnecessary that it should be contiguous to the improved land;\nbut may be a wood lot, or other land at some distance, but\nowned in connexion (sic) with the farm, the timber or range\nof which is used for farm purpose.'' We summed the areas\nof improved and unimproved land in farms to calculate the\ntotal farm area.\n[66] Modern-day Oklahoma was ``Indian Territory,'' and\nno census was taken there. The census taken in 1860\nincluded improved and unimproved land in farms, as in\n[67] The state of West Virginia was created from the\nnorthwestern part of Virginia in 1863. In the aftermath of\nthe Civil War, the 1870 census was underfunded and\ndisorganized. The data are probably less reliable than those\nfor prior and subsequent censuses. For example, ``a correct\nacres'' for land in farms in the region including Pennsylva-\nnia, New Jersey, and states to the north and east [U.S.\nimproved land, unimproved woodland, other unimproved\nland, and population.\n[68] The regular census omitted Indians not taxed, and\ntherefore Indian reservations in all of Oklahoma and parts of\nthe Dakota Territory show zero values for population and\nfarmland. Dodd [1993, p. xviii] refers to ``special Indian\nthe locations of the tribes are not well documented by the\ncensus. Much additional research would be required to\nproperly account for American Indian population and agri-\nculture. In Texas, Kansas, South Dakota, and North Dakota,\nenumerators reported ``no population'' in some counties.\nTable B1 shows the categories of farmlands, which were\ninventoried in acres.\nnia, New Jersey, and states to the north and east exceeded\nthose of the surrounding decades.

The improved acreage includes\nentire land once cultivated, unless afterward abandoned, and\nall permanent meadows and pastures'' [U.S Census, 1896].\n[71] Population counts of Native Americans were avail-\nable for most counties and reservations. We keyed data for\nterritories and Indian populations that were included in\ncensus tables for minor civil divisions and other documents\ncounty census tables or the ICPSR data set. In the 1890 and\n1900 timeframe, some of the Indian reservations were being\nmoved, and it was not always clear how to associate\nreservation names to counties. The low counts for area of\nfarmland on some reservations could be due either to an\nundercount or to a lack of farming.\n[72] The census counted total farm acres and improved\nfarm acres. We calculated the unimproved farmland area by\nsubtracting improved acres from total farm acres.\n[73] The county census tables accounted for more than\nhalf of the Native American population and agricultural\n19]. Additional data were found in another census chapter,\nAgriculture on Indian Reservations [U.S. Census, 1902, pp.\nreservations and tribes by county or counties. We substi-\ntuted the data from this chapter for the original county data\nonly when the numbers were larger, because it was some-\ntimes unclear whether the Native American numbers were\nincluded with the county data.\n[74] In approximately 20 Texas counties, the unimproved\nfarmland acreage exceeded by 20% of the total county area\ncalculated by the geographic information system, which we\nattribute to enumerating the area of multicounty ranches in\nthe county of the ranch headquarters.\ninformation for Native American populations and agricul-\ntural lands.\n[76] Inventories of farmland were split by ownership, so\nwe summed the land in farms for owners, tenants, and\nmanagers to calculate total land in farms. Similarly, the\nimproved lands were summed over the ownership categories.\n[77] Large Texas ranches were again counted in the\ncounty of the headquarters, although acreage was included\nfor land in unnamed adjacent counties. This causes the acres\nof farmland (for seven counties) and unimproved land (for\nAggregate Level Land Use Variable\n1 land in farms\n2 improved land in farms\n3 tilled, including fallow and grass in rotation\n(whether pasture or meadow)\n3 permanent meadows, permanent pastures, orchards,\nand vineyards in improved meadows, pastures\n2 unimproved land in farms\n3 unimproved woodland and forest\n3 other unimproved, including ``old fields'' not\ngrowing wood\naAggregation level 1 represents the total area under consideration.\nElements of aggregation level n sum to the preceding level n \u00c0 1 for n > 1.\nsix counties) to exceed the area calculated by the geographic\ninformation system.\n[78] The census inventoried the following: approximate\nland area; total land in farms; improved land in farms;\nwoodland in farms; and other unimproved land in farms.
