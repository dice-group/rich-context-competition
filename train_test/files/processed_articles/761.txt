    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe association between childhood family structure and first union formation has been\nexplained by two hypotheses. A socialization hypothesis maintains that those who lived in\nno-father families in early childhood delay marriage because of insufficient internalization of\ntraditional sex roles and norms. A stress hypothesis argues that the transition to one-parent\nfamily and/or stepfamily force children and adolescents out of their families into a premature\nassumption of adult roles. This study examines these hypotheses using data from National\nSurvey of Families and Households and Cox regression models. Overall, my findings support\nboth hypotheses. Due to interaction effects between family structure variables and birth\ncohorts, however, the validity of these hypotheses depends on the cohort of sample to be\nanalyzed. The socialization hypothesis accounts for the marital timing of baby boom cohort\nand cohabitation timing of baby bust cohort. On the other hand, the stress hypothesis\naccounts for the marital timing of baby boom cohort, and cohabitaton timing of both baby\nboom and baby bust cohorts. The sources of these interaction effects can be found in the\nrelationships between family structure variables and macro variables such as cohort size and\ndivorce rate.\n",
