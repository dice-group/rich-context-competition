    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Recent studies have revealed the associations between insulin resistance (IR) and geriatric\nconditions such as frailty and cognitive impairment. However, little is known about the relation of IR to\nphysical impairment and limitation in the aging process, eg. slow gait speed and poor muscle strength. The\naim of this study is to determine the effect of IR in performance-based physical function, specifically gait\nspeed and leg strength, among nondiabetic older adults.\nMethods: Cross-sectional data were from the population-based National Health and Nutrition\nin fasting measures of insulin and glucose, habitual gait speed (HGS), and leg strength were analyzed. IR\nwas assessed by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), whereas HGS and peak leg strength by the\n20-foot timed walk test and an isokinetic dynamometer, respectively. We used multiple linear regression\nto examine the association between IR and performance-based physical function.\nResults: IR was inversely associated with gait speed among the men. After adjusting demographics, body\nmass index, alcohol consumption, smoking status, chronic co-morbidities, and markers of nutrition and\ncardiovascular risk, each increment of 1 standard deviation in the HOMA-IR level was associated with a\n0.04 m/sec decrease (p = 0.003) in the HGS in men. We did not find such association among the women.\nThe IR-HGS association was not changed after further adjustment of leg strength. Last, HOMA-IR was not\ndemonstrated in association with peak leg strength.\nConclusion: IR is inversely associated with HGS among older men without diabetes. The results suggest\nthat IR, an important indicator of gait function among men, could be further investigated as an intervenable\ntarget to prevent walking limitation.\n\u00a9 2009 Kuo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBackground\nRecently, increasing research effort has been focused on\nthe role of IR in age-related conditions or geriatric syn-\ndromes. The Italian InCHIANTI study, by examining com-\nmunity-dwelling elderly population, suggested that IR is\nassociated with cognitive impairment as evidenced by\npoor performance in Trail Making Test and Mini-Mental\ndwelling adults for 10 years, Barzilay and colleagues from\nthe Cardiovascular Health Study demonstrated that IR is\nassociated with incident frailty [3], a composite outcome\nconsisting of involuntary weight loss, exhaustion, low\nphysical activity, slowness, and weakness. With life\nexpectancy reaching its historic pinnacle, decline in phys-\nical performance and the resultant late-life disability have\nbecome common features in an aging society [4-9]. How-\never, data examining the association between IR and phys-\nical function are relatively sparse. We hypothesized that IR\nis inversely associated with physical function in commu-\nnity-dwelling elders. We sought to test the hypotheses by\nMethods\nStudy Design and Population\nThe NHANES, a population-based survey, used a strati-\nfied, multistage, and cluster sampling design to obtain a\nrepresentative sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S.\ncivilian population. NHANES consists of a detailed home\ninterview and a health examination conducted in a\nmobile examination center (MEC). Datasets, Survey\nOperations Manuals, Consent Documents, and Brochures\nwere randomly assigned to a morning session and had\ncomplete information of fasting plasma glucose and\nserum insulin. Individuals who had diabetes (physician-\ndiagnosed history, fasting plasma glucose  126 mg/dL, or\ncurrent use of diabetes medication; n = 434) or with miss-\ning values in the timed walking and isokinetic leg strength\ntests because of safety concerns (recent chest or abdomi-\nnal surgery; heart attack in the past 6 weeks; brain aneu-\nrysm or stroke; current neck or back pain; difficulty in\nbending or straightening right knee; or right knee or right\nhip replacement) or any administrative, communicative,\nor technical problems (n = 450) were excluded from the\nanalysis, leaving 1168 participants as the analytic sample.\nAmong the final sample, median values of C-reactive pro-\nmissing values for these variables, all of which were used\nin the analysis.\nMeasures of IR\nA blood sample was collected following an overnight fast\n( 8 h) in participants who were assigned to a physical\nexamination during a morning session. Plasma glucose\nlevel was measured with a hexokinase enzymatic reference\nmethod (COBRAS MIRA; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapo-\nlis, IN) and serum insulin level by a radio-immunoassay\n(Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden). Homeostasis\nmodel assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), an estimate of IR\ncommonly applied in large epidemiological studies, was\nused to evaluate IR using the following formula: fasting\nserum insulin (U/mL) \u00d7 fasting plasma glucose (mmol/\nMeasures of habitual gait speed and isokinetic leg strength\nHabitual gait speed (HGS) was measured in the MEC\naccording to the NHANES standardized protocol. A 20\nfeet long test tract area was set up in a corridor of the MEC.\nThe 20-foot walk was timed using a hand-held stopwatch.\nThe 20-foot timed walk test was performed at the partici-\npant's usual pace. Use of a walker or cane was allowed if\nneeded. HGS was calculated as walking distance (20 feet =\n6.15 m) divided by time (second). Maximal right knee\nextensor force (Newton) was measured at an angular\nvelocity of 60 degree/second by a Kinetic Communicator\nisokinetic dynamometer (Chattecx Corp., Chattanooga,\nTN).\nCovariates\nAge, gender, and race/ethnicity were obtained by self-\nreport. Co-morbidities including heart disease (defined as\na history of myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease,\ncongestive heart failure or angina), chronic lung disease\n(defined as chronic bronchitis or emphysema), and arthri-\ntis were ascertained by self-report questionnaires. Alcohol\nintake was determined by the questionnaire \"In any one\nyear, have you had at least 12 drinks of any type of alcohol\nbeverage?\" and was dichotomized. Exposure to tobacco\nsmoke increases the concentration of nicotine in the\nblood, and nicotine is highly specific for such exposure.\nCotinine is a major metabolite of nicotine. Using their\nserum cotinine concentrations (ng/mL), we classified\nsmoking status of participants in four groups: nonsmoker\nblood pressure (BP) determinations were taken using a\nmercury sphygmomanometer by a NHANES physician.\nBP was measured in the right arm unless specific condi-\ntions prohibit the use of the right arm. Averaged systolic\nand diastolic BPs were obtained. The presence of hyper-\ntension was defined by a self-report doctor's diagnosis, the\nuse of anti-hypertensive medications, or averaged blood\npressure greater than 140/90 mmHg. Body mass index\n(BMI), calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the\nsquare of height in meters, was categorized according to\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nthe National Institutes of Health obesity standards: <18.5\noverweight, and >30 = obese [14]. C-Reactive protein\n(CRP) was quantified by utilizing latex-enhanced neph-\nelometry with a Behring Nephelometer Analyzer System\n(Behring Diagnostics, Frankfurt, Germany). Plasma\nhomocysteine was measured by the Abbott homocysteine\nassay (Abbott Park, IL, USA), a fully automated fluores-\ncence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) method.\nAnalysis\nData were analyzed using Stata 9.0 (Stata, College Station,\nTX) specialized for complex survey data. We used stratum\nand primary sampling unit (PSU) variables required for\nvariance estimation. In order to account for clustering and\nstratification of the multi-stage NHANES sampling\ndesign, we incorporated appropriate sampling weight in\nall analyses in order to obtain point estimates and stand-\nard errors (SEs) applicable to the U.S. population. In the\ncreated to reflect the additional stage of sampling and the\nadditional nonresponse for the subsample of fasting par-\nticipants assigned to the morning session. These 4-year\nfasting weights were used for data analysis.\nCharacteristics of the study population, including means\nand SEs values for continuous variables and percentages\nfor categorical variables, were calculated with correction\nfor the survey design in both men and women. Stratified\nby sex, weighted linear regression analysis was used to\nexamine the relation of HOMA-IR to performance-based\nphysical measures, namely leg strength and HGS. The dis-\ntributions of HOMA-IR in both men and women were\nright-skewed. Therefore, we used natural-log-transformed\nvalues, which provided the best-fitting model for analysis\nin which the HOMA-IR were treated as a continuous vari-\nable. For men, standard-deviation scores of HOMA-IR\nwere obtained from the formula (Xi\n-Xm\n) \u00f7 SD, where Xi\nwas the natural-log-transformed HOMA-IR in the individ-\nual male subject, Xm\nthe mean natural-log-transformed\nHOMA-IR in the male subjects, and SD the standard devi-\nation of the natural-log-transformed HOMA-IR in the\nmale subjects. The standard-deviation scores of HOMA-IR\nin women were obtained from the same formula. This cal-\nculation allowed us to determine the change in the gait\nspeed and leg strength for each increment of 1SD in the\nnatural-log-transformed HOMA-IR. The relations of\nHOMA-IR to leg strength and gait speed were also evalu-\nated with a quartile-based analysis by dividing HOMA-IR\nlevels into quartiles with subjects in the lowest quartile as\nthe reference group. We used an extended-model\napproach for covariates adjustments: Model 1 = age, race,\nBMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and use of\nwalking device; Model 2 = Model 1 + chronic diseases\n(hypertension, chronic lung disease, heart diseases, and\narthritis); Model 3 = Model 2 + markers of nutrition and\ncardiovascular risk (natural-log-transformed levels of\n, total cholesterol, homocysteine and\nCRP). Given the fact that muscle strength has been shown\nto be an important correlate for walking speed among\ncommunity-dwelling older adults [15], we additionally\ncontrolled for leg strength in the association between\nHOMA-IR and HGS (Model 4) in order to observe possi-\nble change of association.\nResults\nTable 1 lists the characteristics of the participants accord-\nmen had higher fasting plasma glucose, serum insulin,\nHOMA-IR, peak leg strength, as well as a higher preva-\nlence of heart disease compared to women. The presence\nof hypertension, chronic lung disease, and arthritis was\nmore common in women than in men. The men smoked\nmore than the women and consumed more alcohol. The\ncut-off values for HOMA-IR quartiles among the men\nwere comparable to women in terms of age, BMI, race,\nand HGS.\nHOMA-IR levels were inversely associated with HGS\namong the men. After adjustment for age, race, BMI cate-\ngories, alcohol consumption, and use of walking devices,\neach increment of 1SD in the HOMA-IR level was associ-\n(Table 2). Additional adjustment of covariates including\nchronic co-morbidities and markers of nutrition/cardio-\nvascular risk (folate, vitamin B12, total cholesterol, homo-\ncysteine, and CRP) did not change the association among\nmen (Model 2 and Model 3). In the full-adjusted model\nwhere peak leg strength was additionally adjusted (Model\n4), the negative association between HOMA-IR and HGS\nWe did not find any association between HOMA-IR and\nHGS among the women. We subsequently divided\nHOMA-IR levels into quartiles and showed that HGS for\nmen in the highest HOMA-IR quartile were 0.066 m/sec\nless than that for men in the lowest quartile after adjust-\nment for Model 1 covariates (significant trend across\nHOMA-IR quartiles with p = 0.035). Likewise, supple-\nmentary adjustment for additional covariates (Models 2\nto Model 4) did not change the inverse association\nbetween HOMA-IR and HGS among the men in the quar-\ntile-based analyses. We did not find a clear trend between\nHOMA-IR quartiles and HGS among the women.

Additionally,\nthe population-based Sacramento Area Latino Study on\nAging (SALSA) reinforced the fact that metabolic syn-\ndrome was associated with progressive limitations in\nmobility and strength by following 1606 Mexican Ameri-\ncans older adults for 3 years[17]. Okoro and colleagues,\ncross-sectionally examining the NHANES cohort, sug-\ngested that selected components of metabolic syndrome,\nspecifically low HDL cholesterol and abdominal obesity,\nwere associated with gait impairment[18]. Nevertheless,\nthese studies may have weakness in internal validity\nbecause such important confounding factors as chronic\nand nutritional status [16-18] were not considered. Fur-\nthermore, the reports of functional impairment are self-\nreported in Blazer et al[16] and Blaum et al[17], thus\nimposing potential bias in outcome ascertainment.\nAlthough metabolic syndrome, a composite outcome\ndefined by expert panel[19], has recently attracted\nresearch interest, the usefulness of metabolic syndrome as\nan actual pathophysiological basis of functional decline\nhas been questioned[20]. On the other hand, IR has been\nproposed as a principal factor in initiating and perpetuat-\ning the pathologic manifestations of the metabolic syn-\ndrome[21]. Unfortunately, none of the above studies\nscrutinize the role of IR in functional status. The cross-\nsectional relation of IR to muscle strength has been\nevaluated in two population-based studies of commu-\nnity dwellers that highlighted an inverse association\nbetween IR and muscle strength [22-24]. However, such\nstudies used different confounding variables in their\nstatistical models and one of the studies consisted of a\ncohort entirely made up of men[22]which may explain\nthe discrepancies from our findings. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first report to describe the association between\nIR and performance-based physical function among older\nmen and women by using a large group of geographically\ndispersed and ethnically diverse national population-\nbased sample. Potential confounders were comprehen-\nsively considered and the role of leg strength in the asso-\nciation between IR and gait speed was assessed.\nBy acting as a cardiovascular risk factor, IR may cause cer-\nebral atherosclerotic changes in the cerebral circulation\n[25], thus contributing to the development of cerebral\nmicro-angiopathy (ie, leukoaraiosis or cerebral small\nvessel disease). The lesions may disrupt the integrity of\nfrontal-subcortical circuits, thus compromising gait\nfunction. Cerebrovascular lesions thus provide a conceiv-\nable mechanism between IR and slow gait speed. Since the\nassociation between IR and gait speed varies across gen-\nder, there may be an effect modification of sex in the asso-\nciation. The fact that men had a greater baseline\nprevalence of cardiovascular risk (such as heart disease\nand smoking) than women may justify why an inverse\nassociation between IR and gait speed is seen in men\nbut not in women. Further research efforts are needed to\ninvestigate possible mediating factors, such as differential\ncoordinating processes in brain neural circuiting or sex\nhormones[26], in mediating the effect of IR on gait speed.\nOur results have clinical implications. IR, in addition to\nits metabolic and cardiovascular implications, may serve\nas an important indicator of walking function among\nolder man. As such, IR may be a promising target for inter-\nvention to prevent decline of walking function in late life.\nSecondly, pharmaceutical interventions such as met-\nformin and thiazolidinedione [27], as well as additional\nknown strategies to effectively lower IR- healthy dietary\npattern [28], regular exercise [29], or weight reduction\n[30]- may additionally improve walking function and\nprevent functional decline, especially for high-risk sub-\njects.\nOur study has potential limitations deserving comments.\nFirst, due to the cross-sectional design, causal relationship\nbetween IR and gait speed can not be established. The\nassociation between IR and gait speed could simply be\nepiphenomenon of aging and the association should be\nprospectively explored. Second, although we have com-\nprehensively adjusted for such confounders as chronic co-\nmorbidities, markers of nutrition, inflammation, and car-\ndiovascular risk, as well as leg strength in the association\nof IR and gait speed, other important measures such as\ncognitive ability, symptoms of depression, markers of\nendothelial dysfunction, or evidence of cerebral small ves-\nsel disease are absent or incomplete in the NHANES 1999-\nIn conclusion, a higher level of IR was associated with a\nslower gait speed among non-diabetic older men. The\nassociation does not exist in the women. We provided\nnew information for the association between IR and gait\nspeed among community-dwelling older adults where\ndata currently do not exist.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAll authors critically reviewed the manuscript, read and\napproved the final manuscript.\nAcknowledgements\nThe study was sponsored by the National Health and Research Institutes,\nTaipei, Taiwan.\nReferences\n1.
