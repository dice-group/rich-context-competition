The ubiquity of CMC invites\ninteresting debate on the phenomenon of meaning making or\nsuccess of communication in the digital environment. As a\nbeen investing considerable time to investigate the emergence\nof digital meaning. This scenario seems to be shaping if not\ndetermining many aspects of our real life, as has been argued\nassert that the Internet mirrors co-construction of the self in\nan ad hoc manner. The transformation of \"the self\" from real\nto virtual began with the invention of electronically mediated\ncommunication, such as through the telegram, telephone, fax,\nand so on, phenomenon that is almost a century and half old.\nHowever, the virtual self has attracted much attention only in\nrecent years. This transformation manifests an evolution of\nmeaning-making self, which is expressed through such medi-\nated communication.\nOne assumes that there is a good reason to believe that the\nexpression of meaning is fundamental to language. The pres-\nent study hypothesizes that certain mechanisms, primarily\nmorphemic and syntactic reduction, are one of the ways used\nto achieve this end. We also claim that the use of such mini-\nmal mechanisms, more obviously in the context of CMC, is\nnot random, but rather, it is necessitated by the expression of\nmeaning under the special circumstances in question. It may\nsound as though we hold deterministic attitude toward the\nrelationship between form and meaning, but our intension is\nsimply to claim the priority of meaning over form.\nMuch work by the researchers of CMC (Danet & Herring,\nas well as those referred previously) shows a split approach,\neither taking formal reduction or minimization to be an act of\nlinguistic transgression or considering this kind of variation\nto be an inherent property of language, as had always been\nevident in the nature of historically older forms of reduced\nlanguage, for instance, diary register (Weir, 2012, and the\nreferences cited therein). Crystal (2006) asserts that CMC\nheralds novel manifestations of this property mirroring lin-\nguistic behavior, in ways primarily different, from the tradi-\ntional modes of communication as has been noted by\nstates that Internet users are habitually and increasingly cus-\ntomizing language to capture their experiences and to express\ntheir e-identity through various linguistic innovations.\nWhile discussing grammatical features of English, Ko\n(1996) finds that electronically governed communication\ntypically involves relatively short or shortened words. While\n1University of Management and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan\nCorresponding Author:\nMuhammad Shaban Rafi, University of Management and Technology, C-II,\nEmail: shabanrafi@hotmail.com\nMeaning Making Through Minimal\nLinguistic Forms in Computer-Mediated\nCommunication\nMuhammad Shaban Rafi1\n Keywords\ncomputer-mediated communication, meaning, morphemic reduction, syntactic reduction, mood\n2 SAGE Open\nexplaining these features, he shows that the use of present\ntense, coordinations, adverbials, demonstrating pronouns,\nand intensifiers is used more frequently in real-time or online\ncommunication than in any other type of discourse. However,\ngrammatical forms such as prepositional phrases, relative\nclauses, and perhaps subordinate clause in general are com-\nparatively infrequent in CMC discourse. Furthermore, he\nclaims that discourse markers and hedges are, likewise, less\ncommon and the patterns of turn taking are far from neat and\norderly. He also mentions this proportionately the huge role\nassert that repetition of punctuation and letters indicates the\nstretching of a word, emulating a stretched out syllable like\nin spoken conversation. Furthermore, they explain that these\nrepetitions tend to communicate tempo, pitch, prosody, and\nother paralinguistic elements for achieving visual emphasis.\nReporting similar results, Herring (2011) additionally points\nout the prevalence of \"nonstandard\" typography and orthog-\nraphy practices. Danet and Herring (2007) note that research\non other languages has exhibited similar tendencies.\nProbably, it is no longer the case that the Internet com-\nmunication is predominantly in English. Bodomo (2009)\nasserts that bilingualism/multilingualism has now become\nthe norm in CMC. As the Internet has been increasingly\nbecoming multilingual, researchers have explored new pat-\nterns of use and language combination in bilingualism/multi-\nlingualism communities (e.g., Androutsopoulos, 2007;\nken in Pakistan, largely adopting the linguistic ecology of\nEnglish (Rafi, 2013), is case in point. Thus, the use of Urdu\non the Internet is always embedded within a larger\nAnglophone context. Not infrequently involving switches\nbetween the two languages or substitution in writing of an\nEnglish letter like b for the whole corresponding semi-\nhomophonous Urdu word more specifically  /b  i:/\nwhich means \"also.\" The substitution noted above does not\nlead to any change in meaning; it does, though, just help the\nusers make meaning by means of minimal linguistic forms.\nIn general, the present study intends to investigate forms\nthat are reduced or have unique configurations, and which\nare exploited to project the same range of meaning as corre-\nsponding full forms. In section \"Method,\" the methodology\nand theoretical as well as the linguistic backgrounds are out-\nlined. The remaining sections except the concluding one\npresent an analysis of the data.\nMethod\nMuch like researchers dealing with any kind of data,\nresearchers who deal with digital data are often confronted\nwith a variety of non-trivial questions. Most of them relate to\nthe size and representativeness of data samples, data process-\ning techniques, limitations of genres, kind and amount of\nnecessary contextual information, and ethical issues, such as\nanonymity and privacy protection. Keeping such questions\nin mind, this section describes the procedures of data collec-\ntion, ethical considerations of collecting and handling data,\ndata analysis, and the theoretical underpinnings.\nData Collection\nThe first stage of data collection consisted of the selection of\na sample of appropriate participants. The sample included\nboth male and female students who were between 18 and 24\nyears of age and were registered in the Bachelor of Science\n(BS) program in five different universities situated in Lahore,\nPakistan. A pilot study suggested that this cohort was indeed\nsuitable for the investigation under discussion (see, for\nage group almost anywhere in the world.\nAccording to Grinter and Eldridge (2001), young people\nbring with them to college a well-developed practice of\ne-styles. As social networks found relatively young people\nits potential users, the present study assumes that they know\nhow to accommodate and appropriate the English language\nargues that youth can take language in their own possession\nand typically active in generating more general language\nPeuronen, 2008) assert that there is always association\nbetween being young and using new patterns of English\nalong with the native language.\nFacebook being popular forum for conversations among\nyoung people was assumed to be a good source of the data\n2012). The data collection was confined to Facebook wall,\nwhich gives easy access to enormous subject pool, without\nviolating anyone's privacy. Furthermore, it is characterized\nby the use of a broad range of traits at the very informal end\nof the linguistic spectrum like in a natural setting, which is\nthe primary focus of the present study.\nSample. The sample was drawn from the five private (by and\nlarge not funded by the State) institutions of higher learning\nlisted in Table 1. The reason to choose these institutions was\nto make the sample as representative of BS students as pos-\nsible. In terms of academic, linguistic, and cultural back-\nground, the sample was homogeneous. All the participants\nwere from BS program but strictly speaking in different disci-\nplines (e.g., Business of Administration, Engineering, Com-\nputer Sciences, and English) and academic years (e.g.,\ncovering first year to fourth year). As the participants were\nbetween 18 and 24 years of age, they might be considered\nyoung people. Youth is defined here as a chronological age--\nnumber of years since birth (cf. Lepp\u00e4nen, 2007). Also, com-\nmunication on Facebook was more or less within the same\ngroup. Notwithstanding the possibility of this forum to\nconnect people from different linguistic backgrounds, the\nparticipants in this study were evidently Urdu/English bilin-\nguals. It should be added that, strictly speaking, the first lan-\nguage of most of them was Punjabi but Urdu was their\nprimary language of communication, both at home and else-\nwhere, and English was their most important academic lan-\nguage and the most prestigious second language. They\nacquired Punjabi, however, through informal contact with, for\nexample, lower or middle lower working class--who speaks\nit maybe to mark solidarity and identity. They used to meet\nwith each other both in offline and online contexts. Moreover,\ntheir communication was not only limited to Pakistani con-\ntexts but it could be referred to international settings also. The\nparticipants linked and shared activities covering information\nexchange, debate, problem solving, exchanging picture,\njokes, and video related to varying themes, such as greeting,\npolitics, showbiz, sports, and sex. Peuronen (2008) argues\nthat these activities \"best describe their being\" (p. 104). Their\ncommunication in online context comprised new creative\nways. Importantly, they identified themselves mostly either\nthrough Urdu or English or both. The data were mainly in\nRomanized Urdu, English, or a mixture of Urdu and English.\nThe corpus used was simply in multiple languages, all written\nin the same (Roman) script. Tone used in the message threads\nwas typically informal; however, a number of snippets\nseemed to be formal too. A lot of words that the participants\nused were clearly from their specific academic context.\nFive volunteers who were also students at these institu-\ntions were engaged for help during the process of data col-\nlection. Each one of them coordinated the data gathering\nprocess for one of the five institutions. The researcher\nshared with them the purpose and ethical boundaries of the\nstudy. Each of them managed to add on average 375 stu-\ndents over a period of 2 months. Thus, the researcher had\naccess to all the students through these volunteers. The data\nfrom only 50 participants from each institution were ana-\nlyzed on the basis of the quantity of their posting output.\nTable 1 shows the distribution of the sample over the five\ninstitutions. The study investigated linguistic postings of\neach participant transmitted over the period of a week. The\nlogic behind collecting the whole week's data was to\nobserve most of the linguistic features that the participants\nused in their communication. Each posting consisted of\nusually more than one utterance. Thus, the data collected\nwere naturalistic and observational, with minimum inter-\nference from the researcher. However, the participants were\nasked questions to seek clarifications where it was abso-\nlutely necessary.\nNature of the data.As shown in Table 2, the data were col-\nlected from 200 participants whose average age was 21\nyears. The data indicate that each participant spends on aver-\nfollowers, thus creating the likelihood of feedback on his or\nings are a blend of both Urdu and English. This shows an\nincreasing trend of English along with mixed Urdu and Eng-\nlish in digital discourse. As is evident from Table 2, the par-\nticipants have shown less and marginal need for Urdu as a\nmedium of communication. The most plausible reason behind\nthe marginal use of Urdu is perhaps the importance given to\nEnglish in academia. Importantly, English is their most pres-\ntigious second language. They come across relatively fewer\nopportunities to use written Urdu in their academic context,\nfor example, examination, project, assignment, and so on.\nOn average, each posting consisted of 137 words ranging\nwords are accumulated for the analysis.\nMuch like face-to-face conversation, communication\nbetween the participants reflected physical approximation.\nThe illustrations in [1] confirm that the distant or even near\nfuture marking system is marginal in the context of CMC.\nOverall, the data included the postings, which demonstrated\nparticipants' relationships regarding how close they were\nwith their followers.\na. <tum kahn gum ho bhai . . . ?> (Where are you brother?)\nTable 1.

Interactivity is a defining characteris-\ntics of CMC, which is organized around topics or threads.\nBarnes (2003) defines that \"a thread is a chain of interre-\nlated messages that respond to each other\" (p. 20). A lin-\nguistic posting on the wall can be generally described as\nfragments, phrases, and clauses. The postings on the wall\nevolved in a coherent whole around topics of varying\nthemes. Mostly, a topic was initiated by a single person fol-\nlowed by his or her followers' comments, which was either\nclosed with words of thanks or reflection from the origina-\ntor or left without proper closing. The exchanges on the\nwall can be classified into a three-part structure of Initia-\ntion, Response, and Reflection (IRR). This IRR structure\ncan be seen in the following example:\nA: <newly made my own pic>\nB: <its awsome bro>\nA: <thanks>\nUnlike IRR structure, instances of dialogue structures,\ntwo-part adjacency pairs (e.g., question\u00adanswer), and non-\nlinear flow of conversation were also prevalent. The dia-\nlogue structure and adjacency pair can be seen in [3] and\n[4]. The postings in the data were extrovert in nature and\neach provided a framework within which the next was\nformulated.\nA: <sick of formatting now . . .

Thurlow and Poff (2013)\nargue that with the convergence of new (and old) media,\ntechnological boundaries and generic distinctiveness of\ninstant messaging, texting, and emailing are becoming\nblurred. Notable examples of this are found in micro-blog-\nging (e.g., Twitter and status updates on Facebook), the\nmulti-functionality of smart-phones (e.g., BlackBerry) and\nto some extent, Apple's iPhone. This study assumes that\ndividing Facebook conversations on the wall between syn-\nchronous and asynchronous modes may be misleading\nbecause the speed of communication mostly inhibits us to\ndraw a clear line between synchronous and asynchronous\ncommunication. As there is a range of possibilities, we may\nconsider the participants' conversation on the wall as falling\nbetween synchronous and asynchronous modes. But strictly\nspeaking, this study considered Facebook communication\non the wall analogous to asynchronous communication.\nThe participants used to grid a kind of coherent discourse\nbecause most of their postings were in response to a single\nindividual's reflections. It was found that communication on\nthe wall usually occurred between one-to-one or one-\nto-many--a kind of interpersonal communication. Barnes\n(2003) reinforces the fact that the Internet can be used to\ndistribute messages in any number of directions, that is, one-\nto-one or one-to-many.\nEthical considerations. Ensuring that pre-existing ethical stan-\ndards were properly met was crucial. In this study, we\nadhered to guidelines suggested by Mann and Stewart (2000)\nwhile collecting data.\nThe participants were informed about the nature of the\nstudy. They were given assurances regarding confidentiality,\nsecurity of information, and unauthorized eavesdropping;\nthat is, information that might identify the participants,\nplaces, institutions, and times was never to be disclosed. The\nparticipants were identified by means of cryptonyms in\nreporting research. Access to the database was restricted to\nthe participants and the researcher. However, the researcher\ncould not forbid the use of racist and sexist language, and\nother contentious and provocative material. Mann and\nStewart (2000) argue that Internet research does not have to\nconform to these restrictions.\nData Analysis\nTo attempt the research question, minimal linguistic forms\nand what they communicate in terms of mood were ana-\nlyzed. J\u00f8rgensen, Karreb\u00e6k, Madsen, and M\u00f8ller (2011)\nremark that linguistic features are best suited as the basis for\nthe analysis of language in polylanguaging context. These\nforms were classified into lexical and syntactic tiers. Word\nreduction was further subclassified into abbreviations (e.g.,\ngf for \"girlfriend\"), clippings (e.g., pic for \"picture\"), and\nlogograms (e.g., some1 for \"someone\"). For clarity, logo-\ngrams were further subclassified into phonetic spelling (u\nfor \"you\"), lexo-numeric (gr8 for great for \"great\"), digito-\nlexeme (2morow for \"tomorrow\"), and digit word semi-\nhomophone (4 for \"for\").The purpose of these classifications\nand subclassifications was to tabulate precisely the lexical\nfeatures for measure of frequency. Frequency was calcu-\nlated to gauge how many times a particular feature occurred\nand to suggest its permanence in CMC. The frequency of\noccurrence was determined if at least a word was repeated\ntwice within a conversation and a minimum of 5 times in the\nwhole data.\nWhat CMC-unique structures are, and how they uncover\nfunctional roles, I examined (a) types of structures, (b)\ndeletion of grammatical features, and (c) syntactic expres-\nsion of mood. Types of structures were further classified\ninto fragmented structure, simple structure, compound\nstructure, and complex structure. To analyze whether or not\nthe proportions of structure type are different across the\nlanguages, I calculated chi-square test of independence. As\nthe characteristic of linguistic reduction was assumed as\none of the key features across the corpus, grammatical\nproperties, which were commonly deleted, were measured.\nThis measure provided us with further insight to assess how\nfar the participants compromised on structural rules when\ncommunicating in digital environment. Furthermore, a\ncareful analysis of structures constituting mood (e.g.,\ndeclarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory)\nwas examined to uncover functional roles and negotiation\ncommon to Facebook.\nIn addition to analysis of quantitative data, I also drew\non the message threads to elaborate and support my verdict\nconcerning the research questions, which helped bring tri-\nangulation to increase the credibility and validity of the\nresults. These snippets were in English, Romanized Urdu,\nand mixed English and Urdu. They were demonstrated\nwithin mathematical symbols (such as < >) along with their\ntransliteration in the parentheses. In relation to paralinguis-\ntic features, I considered their visual aspects only as a\nmeaning-making resource in a message thread. Thus, the\nanalysis was backed up by a large corpus covering both\nquantitative and qualitative data sets, which assisted in\nattempting the research questions with more extensive\nanalysis, with far more participants and more rigorous sam-\npling procedures.\nTheoretical underpinning. The procedure for analysis was con-\nceived within much related theoretical work on text analysis.\njudgments are particularly untrustworthy with respect to fre-\nquency and distribution of different forms and meanings of\nwords, and to the interaction of lexis, grammar, and meaning.\nIn the present study, against the reliance on invented data,\nexample utterances were explicitly taken from the data. The\naccountability to data was thus taken into account. Unlike\ncontemporary studies, which are based on a small data set, a\nlarge corpus based study was planned to address the underly-\ning research question. The actual language text duly recorded\nwas the main concern in the present study. In addition, inter-\npretation of cyber-linguistic features was based on the whole\ndata rather than relying consistently on a few examples.\nThere is reason to believe that a few linguistic features of\na text are distributed evenly throughout. To encompass the\nwhole data, the study recorded the frequency of commonly\noccurring minimal lexical as well as syntactic features\nacross the corpus to draw emerging patterns. One of the\nmain uses of the corpus is to identify what is central and\ntypical in the language (Sinclair, 1991, as cited in Stubbs,\n1996). Thus, linguistic patterns that reside in a language can\nbest be judged when they are studied comparatively across\nthe text corpora.\nAs noted above, the data were accumulated from five\ngroups. The purpose behind the selection of different cohorts\nwas to have a comparative standpoint whether linguistic fea-\ntures were spread across the board or concentrated in a par-\nticular cohort. Overall, the data were organized into lexical\nand syntactic tiers. Stubbs (1996) argues that the most pow-\nerful interpretation emerges if comparisons of texts across\ncorpora are combined with the analysis of the organization of\nindividual texts. Another approach would have been to view\nlinguistic features in several different media genres (e.g.,\nemail, social networking, and text messaging), though com-\npatible with this principle, seems to motivate relatively dif-\nferent linguistic choices (see, for example, Baron, 2008;\nor informal end of the linguistic spectrum. Whereas the pri-\nmary focus of this study was to collect naturalistic and obser-\nvational data that were limited to Facebook communication\non the wall.\nEvery language is governed by linguistic selections and\nrestrictions. For example, both Urdu and English pursue lin-\nguistic conventions to transform and transmit a structure. We\ncan, of course, say how are you? or Ap ka kia hal hai? But we\nmay not say you are how or Ap hai kia hal ka. Hence, gram-\nmatical structure restricts the lexis that occurs in it, and con-\nversely any lexical item can be specified in terms of the\nstructures (Stubbs, 1996). The study presupposed that the\nlinguistic flexibility that young people exercised in the medi-\nated communication was based on the system of language\nmore or less; however, it was the meaning that governed their\napparently peculiar linguistic choices.\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 3.

As Firth (1957, as cited in\nStubbs, 1996) puts it, \"You shall know a word by the company\nit keeps\" (p. 11). Firth's notion of form and meaning in context\nsystemic linguistics. Systemic linguistics adopts a descriptive\napproach to language investigation that answers the questions:\nWhat is language? and How does language work? In the same\nway, the present study gives importance to the description of\nthe characteristics of cyber-linguistic features. It may sound as\nthough we hold deterministic attitude toward the relationship\nbetween form and meaning, but our intension is simply to\nclaim the priority of meaning over form.\nMinimal Linguistic Forms\nWord Reduction\nLinguistic reduction was the most common feature in the\ndata. The participants mostly reduced linguistic forms from\nUrdu and English. However, it was English which acquired\nthe impact of linguistic reduction the most. They minimized,\nseemingly either through conscious or subconscious efforts,\nwords by compounding a number and lexeme or morpheme,\nfor example, some1 for someone, gr8 for great, b4 for before,\nand so on. Words that are composed of two syllables in which\none syllable is substituted with a digit and the other remains\nconstant may be called lexo-numeric. Conversely, the par-\nticipants also customized words, may be labeled digito-\nlexeme, by substituting segment or segments of a word with\na digit at the onset, for example, 2morow for tomorrow, 4get\nfor forget, and so on. Among other categories of reduction,\ndigit word homophones were prevalent, which were formed\nby replacing a full word with a digit, for example, 1 for\n\"one,\" 2 for \"to\" or \"too,\" 4 for \"for,\" and so on. As many as\n1,106 words were tabulated in these categories, which can be\ngrouped under the basic term, namely, logogram. Thus, the\nlogograms, in many ways, were the most frequently occur-\nring features in cyber-communication of young Pakistani\nstudents.\nThe initial ambiguity that might have been as a result of\nminimal linguistic forms was seemingly compensated, if not\naltogether but mostly, through extralinguistic features. Apart\nfrom this, linguistic reduction can further be explained within\nthe system of language. Furthermore, segmental reduction in\nEnglish and Urdu is systematic, which indicates supposedly\nuniform patterns for the success of communication.\nReduction in the segments of English words can be charac-\nterized by phonological and morphological properties. As\nshown in Table 3, the derived forms conform to fixed phono-\nlogical patterns, which are characterized by templates in which\n\"C\" stands for consonant sound and \"V\" represents vowel\nsound. Moreover, bold letters, for example, \"C\" stands for the\nsound that was picked up while committing the reduction in\nthe original word. As is evident from the given template,\nvowel sound or vowel-like sound is more susceptible to reduc-\ntion. Vowel sounds seem to behave like the fillers in consonant\nsounds. We may speculate that English words can be read\nwithout vowels exerting a little effort. Conversely, there is no\ninstance of reduction in consonant sounds; however, the con-\nsonant sounds which were reduced are primarily from conso-\nnant clusters. Hence, the consonant sound was used to cover\nthe rest of the segment in a word. Moreover, diphthongs and\nweak vowel sounds, especially // to show a sound occurring\nat various segmental positions in a word, were occasionally\ntruncated.As highlighted in the given template, it is the conso-\nnant sound in a word which the primary carrier of a meaning\nis. This can be compared with early Semitic languages such as\nArabic and Hebrew in which the words' roots were isolated\nsets of consonants, for example, inArabic the root word mean-\ning \"write\" had the form k\u00adt\u00adb. It signifies that the part of lin-\nguistic principles have always been recycling since the first\nutterance was articulated as has been supported by Napoli and\nLee-Schoenfeld (2010) who assert that our speech contains\narchaism--a little fossil from the past.\nAs noted above, the participants mostly reduced English\nforms; however, they simply substituted bi-syllabic Urdu\nwords with the whole corresponding mono-syllabic English\nhomophones or semi-homophones--may be considered a\ncreative way of reducing morphemic properties of Urdu pri-\nmarily in Romanized script. While substituting Urdu forms\nwith its English counterparts, the overextended sound had no\nor less homophonous correspondence in some instances. It is\nevident that the substitution does not cover aspirated sound\nbecause this requires use of superscript [  ] that the partici-\npants simply avoided.\n[b], pronounced as /bi/ is a semi-homophone of \nwhich means \"also\"\n[c], pronounced as /si/ is a homophone of  which\nmeans \"also\" or \"like\" or \"of\" or \"for\"\n[i], pronounced as /ai/ is a homophone of  which\nmeans \"coming\"\n[g], pronounced as /di/ is a homophone of  which\nmeans \"yes\"\n[k], pronounced as /ke/ is a homophone of  which\nmeans \"that\"\n[q], pronounced as /kju/ is a homophone  which\nmeans \"why\"\nThe logic behind these substitutions is that all the above-\nmentioned Urdu bi-syllabic words have the same or nearly\nthe same sound in English alphabets. It seems as a matter of\nease the participants replaced bi-syllabic forms with their\nmono-syllabic counterparts in their conversations. Similarly,\nthey also substituted the following English words with their\ncounterparts in Urdu.\nTable 4 shows that another very interesting phenom-\nenon, may be called reduction, is the substitution of Urdu\nTable 4. Substitution of Urdu Alphabets with Corresponding\nEnglish Phoneme.\nUrdu alphabets English phoneme\n /a/\n   /s/\n  /d/\n  /r/\n    /z/\n   /t/\n  /k/or/q/\n  /g/\n  /h/\n[a], is pronounced as /// is a\nhomophone of  which means\n\"come\"\n[may], is pronounced as /me/\nis a homophone of  which\nmeans \"in\"\n[gay], is pronounced as /ge/ is\na homophone of  which\n\"went\" or \"past forms of will\n(would)\"\n[or], is pronounced as /:(r)/\nis a homophone of  which\nmeans \"more\")\n[he/hi], is pronounced as /hi:/ is\na homophone of  which is\n\"intensifier\"\n[pass], is pronounced as /p\u00e6s/\nis a homophone of  which\nmeans \"near\"\n[her], is pronounced as /h:(r)/\nis a homophone of  which\nmeans \"every\"\n[pay], is pronounced as /pe/\nis a homophone of  which\nmeans \"on\"\n[key], is pronounced as /ki:/ is a\nhomophone of  which means\n\"what\"\n[say], is pronounced as /se/\nis a homophone of  which\nmeans \"from\"\n[log], is pronounced as /lg/ is\na homophone of  which\nmeans \"people\"\n[such], is pronounced as /st/\nis a homophone of  which\nmeans \"true\"\ngraphemes with English phonemes as has been noted by Rafi\nin Romanized Urdu 66% of them are reduced to 24%.Around\n58% of Urdu alphabets find seemingly semi-homophonous\ncorresponding letters in English. Mostly involved substitu-\ntions, between Urdu alphabets, for example, / /, / \n/,/  /,//, and / / and English phoneme, for example,\n/a/, /d/, /r/, /k or q/, and /g/, respectively. However, switches\nbetween two languages in writing Urdu letters, for example,\nand / / for the whole\nsemi-homophonous English phoneme, for example, /s/, /z/,\n/t/, and /h/, respectively, were not infrequent. Surprisingly, the\nparticipants usually reduced English vowel sounds; however,\nwhen Romanizing Urdu, they preferred to minimize mostly\nif not always Urdu consonant sounds. More or less, these\ninstances seem to be a reflection of linguistic accommoda-\ntion, which can be used to support the verdict that CMC is\na new discourse. Trudgill (2003) defines accommodation as\n\"the process whereby participants in a conversation (usu-\nally face-to-face interaction) converge their accent, dialect,\nor other language characteristics according to the language\nof other participant(s)\" (p. 3). Although convergence of\nUrdu graphemes with their English counterparts is appar-\nently due to Roman transliteration of the Urdu language,\nthis leads us to reveal that Urdu alphabets are reduced\nmore or less to the size of English which are supposedly\ncompensated with normal key stocks--to avoid complex\napplication (shift, alt, and shift & alt) that these graphemes\nmight have required. There is a fair chance that this trend\nmay continue and consolidate with the present keyboard\nfeatures (see, for example, Sperlich, 2005). Investigation\nof technological limitations and their impact on languages\nhave access to Internet can be an interesting study to gauge\nhow widespread the phenomenon is! However, investiga-\ntion of this dimension is beyond the scope of the present\nstudy.\nThe second most noticeable lexical feature is the reduc-\ntion of words to their initial letters. They are known as abbre-\nviations. Abbreviations are commonly used and an accepted\ntrend of writing the initials of words to make a new word that\nis not essentially pronounceable. However, there are\ninstances of abbreviations, which obey phonetic property, for\nexample, AFAP for as far as possible, SOB for son of bitch,\nYo for your own, and so on. Abbreviations are usually spelled\nin capital letters; however, there are cases where the strings\nof words were abbreviated in lower case letters also. Like\nreduction in the base forms, abbreviations also involve loss\nof material. The principle of orthography is, however, of cen-\ntral importance in abbreviations, for example, dp for digital\npicture, gf for girlfriend, np no problem, and so on. As men-\ntioned above, in limited cases, phonetic properties were also\napplied to derive abbreviations known as acronyms, for\nexample, asap for as soon as possible, lol for lot of laughter,\nafap for as far as possible, and so on.\n/  /, /   /, /  / and / /\n8 SAGE Open\nThere are words that were derived from the first part of\nthe base word. This process is labeled as clipping. Clippings\nappear as a mixed bag of forms reduced from base forms,\nwhich express familiarity with the denotation of the deriva-\ntive. Thus, pic was used typically by the participants to refer\nto digital image and bro was part of their vocabulary to show\nprobably an intimate relationship. There are clippings, for\nexample, add/addy for address, cos for because, fav for\nfavorite, grats for congratulations, del for delete, dif for dif-\nferent, jus for just, moro for tomorrow, rehi for hello again,\nuni for university, and web for website, which are character-\nistic features of cyber-communication.\nAnother unique way of segmental reduction is \"g\" omis-\nsion in words ending with \"g.\" Perhaps, the participants\nthought it an additional sound while texting words ending\nwith \"g.\" In native-English especially in some parts of the\nUnited Kingdom, for example, Norwich, Cardiff, and else-\nwhere, \"g\" dropping in colloquial speech is pervasive, as if\nthere is simply an [n] on the end. This is indicative of some\ninteresting facts such as migration of \"g\" dropping in the\nconversation of the participant that can be used as a corre-\nlate of foreign culture. This seems to explain that the so-\ncalled linguistic borders are melting down and spreading\nlinguistic forms of the dominant language, which is English\nin our case, through new media communication.\nTypes of Structures\nThe participants used typically fragments and sentences (i.e.,\nsimple, compound, and complex) to carry out their conversa-\ntion. Fragment can be referred to a segment of a sentence that\nmay contain a single word or a string of words. The examples\n[4a-4k] indicate fragments consisting of a single word and a\nstring of words. Three dots on either sides of the structure\nindicate a range of missing syntactic elements, for example,\nhead word, verb (especially auxiliary verb), and complement.\nHowever, a sentence can be classified into a simple sentence\n(that contains a subject and a predicate, and it expresses a\ncomplete thought), a compound sentence (that contains two\nindependent clauses joined by a coordinator), and a complex\nsentence (which consists of an independent clause joined by\none or more dependent clauses). The snippets [4l-4n] show\nsimple structures consisting of a subject and a predicate. The\nexample [4o and 4p] highlights types of compound and com-\nplex structures present in the corpus. Table 5 shows that the\nuse of fragmented and simple structures is common. The data\nshow 45% use of fragments followed by 44% use of simple\nstructure across the corpus; however, compound and complex\nstructures constituted relatively a low percentage. Chi-square\ntest of independence shows p value (.03), which is less than\n.05; we can reject the null hypothesis, and say that types of\nstructures and languages are related. I have further explained\nthe association between types of structures and languages in\nthe following section.\na. < . . . nice . . . >\nb. < . . . Vry nice . . . > (Very nice.)\nc. < . . . really nice . . . >\nd. < . . . enjoyed . . . >\ne. < . . . movie day . . . >\nf. < . . . so sad . . . >\ng. <i wil . . . :P> (I will . . . )\nh. <will have more fun . . . >\ni. < . . . definitely will do . . . >\nj. < . . . tired and sick . . . >\nk. < . . . breathless moments . . . hooooh>\nl. < . . . buss copy paste mera hai . . . :-p> ( . . . just have\ndone copy and paste . . . )\nm. <Baray log late aatey hain :p> (The prestigious people\nget late.)\nn. <U r in my bradri too . . . hahaha> (You are my caste-\nfellow too . . . hahaha)\no <I think its first time that Pakistan and UK are celebrat-\ning Eid on same day>\np. <yeh dnt get me started on Morroco that and Tunisa is\nconfusing!>\nSyntactic Reduction\nAs discussed above, structural properties of English were\nfound to be more susceptible to deletion. Nevertheless, the\nparticipants were relatively diligent about structural proper-\nties of Urdu. Figure 1 indicates syntactic constituents, which\nwere regularly deleted. The structural properties of English,\nfor example, pronoun and verb, were more frequently deleted\nthan article, preposition, and inflection. Deletion of pronomi-\nnal especially first person \"I\" was common. The participants\nfrequently deleted \"I\" where it was preceded by an auxiliary\n\"am.\" They occasionally truncated \"I am\" to \"am\" or \"m\" or\nsimply omitted \"I,\" for example, . . . will do asap . . . m hav-\ning my exams!! . . . hope u understand!! . . . love you\nmwaaaah. Insertion of three dots signifies deletion of pro-\nnoun \"I.\" Similarly, they omitted auxiliary verbs, such as is,\nare, am, was, and were in their conversations. Given the\nstructural deletion, there was omission of capitalization in\nthe beginning of an utterance or in the case of proper nouns\nand addition of toggle case. As noted above, only a few\nTable 5. Frequency/Percentage of Types of Structures.\nLanguage Fragment Simple Compound Complex\nMixed Urdu and\nEnglish\nNote. Chi-square test of independence (p = .03 < .05).\ninstances of cohesive ties were found across the corpus. As a\nresult of this, communication was more a reflection of short\nstructures then supported by linguistic nexuses. The omis-\nsion of linguistic features shows that the participants might\nhave used their pragmatic knowledge to presuppose that the\nreceiver would know how to map out deleted expressions in\ntheir utterances.\nThe snippets in [5] show that utterances, even though\nshortened, are coherent and meaningful. Apart from obliga-\ntory words, the participants omitted optional words by\nassuming that obligatory words might be sufficient to express\nmeanings. However, the English language resists omission\nof obligatory strings of words because they hold meaning\nand omission may damage intelligibility. In my observation,\nthe deictic expressions, main verb, and attributive forms\nseem sufficient for the projection of deleted string of words.\nThere is reason to believe that even though their communica-\ntion was not structurally rich, concurrent exchanges revealed\nsomehow that the participants might have inferred the deleted\nstring of words for the success of communication. It is logi-\ncal to argue that instead of structure, meaning was assumed\nto be a primary source of carrying a message. How minimal\nlinguistic forms construe syntactic expression of mood and\noverall relevant to the theory of meaning making is exam-\nined in the next section.\na. <yea I wid U> (Yes, I . . . with you.)\nb. <examz over . . . > (Exams . . . over . . . )\nc. <i think paper little bit short> (I think . . . . . . . . . short\npaper.)\nd. <you so qute> (You . . . so cute.)\ne. <lyf goin gr8> (Life . . . going great.)\nf. <me cooking food for u> ( . . . . . . cooking food for you.)\ng. <me playing> ( . . . . . . playing.)\nh. <one of my favorite songs!> (. . . . . . one of my favorite\nsongs!)\ni. <awesome lyrics!!> (. . . . . . awesome lyrics!)\nj. <sometimes nothing to say> (Sometime . . . . . . nothing\nto say.)\nk. <more options?> (. . . . . . more options.)\nl. <Sorry network problem> (. . . . . . . . . . . . network\nproblem.)\nm. <now feeLing bettEr after> (Now . . . . . . feeling\nbetter.)\nn. <not geTTing sleEp . . . :(> (. . . . . . not feeling asleep.)\no <BoRINg LIFeeeE . . . !!!!! :(just siTting alone . . . :( :( :(\n:( :( :( :( :( :(> (. . . . . . boring life . . . . . . . . . . . . just\nsitting alone.)\np. < . . . really missing u :-(:-(:-(> (. . . . . . really missing\nyou.)\nq. <this iz make by me> (This is make (past participle) by\nme.)\nr. <she like it> (She like (inflectional \"s\") it.)\ns. <Please not disturb> (Please . . . not disturb.)\nt. <u not understand my prob . . . > (You . . . not understand\nmy problem . . .)\nFigure 2 reflects a classification of commonly deleted\nsyntactic forms in the linguistic repertoire of Urdu/English\nbilinguals. The sign {\u00d8} in the figure nuances for the\nabsence of a feature. As noted above, we did not find dele-\ntion in grammatical features of the Urdu language apart\nfrom superficial realization of Urdu graphemes. As shown\nin the figure, it is the English language that seems to give\nprovision to deleting structural properties in digital dis-\ncourse. It seems that the participants might have presup-\nposed, of course to a certain extent, linguistic expressions\nwhich were deleted regularly. There is a fair reason to\nbelieve that the structural nativization of English is now\nread in the local context as supported by Michael (1993). In\nthe next section, we will be concerned with the communi-\ncative intention of the types of structures that we have\ndescribed in this section.\nSyntactic Expression of Mood\nIn attempting to express themselves, the participants did not\nonly exchange utterances containing the set of rules, they also\nperformed structural moods. In many ways, they juxtaposed\nlinguistic features for the success of communication. For\ninstance, in [6a], imperative structure was used along with the\ninsertion of exclamatory tone to enquire. Similarly in [6b and\n6c], declarative structure was used to enquire. In [6c], use of a\nNoun Verb Article Preposition Inflection\nFigure 1. Frequency/percentage of structural properties\ndeletion in the mediated communication of Urdu/English\nbilinguals.\nFigure 2. The network representation of structural deletion in\nthe linguistic repertoire of Urdu/English bilinguals.\nquestion mark at the boundary indicates that the participant\nhad intention to enquire. In [6d], the structure is interrogative\nbut the exclamation mark and comma seem to indicate the\nintention. Thus, the structure alone may not be sufficient to\nperceive the communicative function in digital discourse. The\nsubsequent discursive practices they carried out uncover a\nsuccess of their communication. They juxtaposed various lin-\nguistic and extralinguistic features to choose functional roles\nand to resolve a kind of ambiguity that may emerge as a result\nof apparently a flexible relationship between structure and\nfunction, for example, a statement can be read as a question or\nvice versa (see, for example, Sinclair & Coulthard, 1978).\na. <Tell me abt it!> (Tell me about it!)\nb.<Mje call pe btana Kal paper hai mera.> (Let me know\non phone . . . I have exam tomorrow.)\nc. <Kal match on?> (. . . . . . game on tomorrow?)\nd. <Phr kon dayta hay apko, clases,,?!> (Then, who does\nteach you?)\nConclusion\nThis study pursued a descriptive approach to analyze the lin-\nguistic repertoire of Urdu/English bilinguals to explain how\nCMC works. The findings reveal that the participants are prone\nto minimizing forms, apparently presupposed, in English and\nUrdu. The data indicate that they tend to delete optional words\nand segments more or less, which do not hide the base forms\nfor the projection of missing elements. While mapping out\nminimal linguistic forms, we found unique configurations\nwhich were equally rich in their semantic manifestation.\nDespite the fact that the participants committed structural\nirregularities in their communication, they adhered to gram-\nmatical rules and conversation principles to the extent that\ntheir communication was intelligible. The elements which\nwere missed or omitted can be guessed at or perceived\nbecause, while communicating, they were not only con-\ncerned with just the structure of their message but with the\nmeaning and context surrounding the message, as supported\nby Spears, Lea, and Postmes (2001). Perhaps meanings,\nmore than receiver or mode, directed their linguistic choices\nas to how far they could manipulate the structure of English\nand Urdu. They marked moods with the types of structures\nwe have discussed. Although we generally construe a mood\nboth through the transformation of a structure along with\ninsertion of punctuation marks, they did this simply by\ninserting punctuation marks and avoiding structural transfor-\nmation. Apart from structure, the discourse roles the partici-\npants technically assumed tend to contribute to the theory of\nmeaning in digital environment.\nUnlike previous studies, which have revealed the ambiva-\nlent, if not weird, nature of cyber-linguistic features, this study\nhelps define a broader classification of them, which suppos-\nedly project some unique configurations. The study reveals\nthat even though Urdu and English are subject to morphologi-\ncal and syntactic reduction, their structural manipulation in the\ncontext of CMC does not obscure meaning. The study moti-\nvates future researchers to investigate linguistic reduction to\nreveal linguistic variation and change in the languages used\nfor the Internet communication. This would further provide us\nwith a foreground, so we can understand more about the lin-\nguistic behavior and social identity of e-communities.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAhmad, R.
