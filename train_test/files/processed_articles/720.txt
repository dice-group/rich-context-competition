Glass, PhD1\nSubstantial discordance can be observed be-\ntween the level of functioning older persons are ca-\npable of (based on self-reports), and how actively\nand independently they function in the \"real\"\nworld. Recognition of this discordance has given\nrise to the distinction between pathology, impair-\nment, disability, and handicap featured in the World\nHealth Organization's taxonomy of functioning, the\nInternational Classification of Impairments, Disabil-\nity, and Handicap (ICIDH) (World Health Organ-\nization, 1980). This article argues that the WHO dis-\ntinction has not gone far enough in sensitizing\ngerontologists to the complexity of late life func-\ntioning. This has resulted in a gap in conceptualiza-\ntion and research due to the failure to differentiate\namong three \"tenses\" of functioning (hypothetical,\nexperimental, and enacted). This article presents a\nmodel to elucidate the distinctions among these\ntenses in an effort to fill this gap. Empirical evidence\nof the existence of this phenomenon will also be\nprovided through a report on a data set which asks\nquestions of high-functioning elderly persons from\nthe perspective of more than one tense.\nThe Dominance of the Disability Model\nFor the past several decades, the predominant\nThe author would like to thank Drs.

An indication of the im-\nportance of this model is the fact that the term dis-\nability has become nearly synonymous with the con-\ncept of functioning or functional status (McDowell\n& Newell, 1987). The disability model grew out of the\nNagi, 1991) and Katz and others in medicine (Katz et\nbeyond the narrow focus on the presence or absence\nof disease. Katz developed the activities of daily liv-\ning (ADL) index to measure both the effectiveness of\ntreatments and the underlying mortality risk in frail\nelderly populations. That the ADL index would be-\ncome synonymous with functioning was foretold in\nthe subtitle of Katz's first article, \"The index of ADL:\nA standardized measure of biological and psychoso-\ncial function\" (Katz et al., 1963). Today more than\nfifty ADL scales have been developed and most, in-\ncluding the Katz and the Barthel Indices, were\nspecifically intended to measure functioning among\ninstitutionalized patients (Mahoney & Barthel, 1965).\nThe disability model, as exemplified by the ICIDH,\nis pictured as a linear pathway leading from disease\nto handicap (in Nagi's framework) (see Appendix,\nInstrinsic\npathology or\ndisorder.\nAny loss or\nabnormality of\npsychological,\nphysiological or\nanatomical\nstructure or\nfunction.\nAny restriction or\nlack of ability to\nperform an\nactivity in the\nmanner or in the\nrange considered\nnormal for a\nhuman being.\nA disadvantage\nresulting from an\nimpairment or a\ndisability that limits\nor prevents the\nfulfilment of a\nnomal role\n(depending on age,\nsex, and social, and\ncultural factors) for\nindividuals.\nFigure 1. World Health Organization Typology of Health and Functioning: International Classification of Impairment, Disability, and\nHandicap (ICIDH).\nNote 1). The emphasis is on the probabilistic rather\nthan deterministic nature of those transitions (Fig-\nure 1). The model begins with disease (pathology),\nwhich predisposes to impairment (loss of structure\nor function), which predisposes to disability (re-\nstriction or lack of ability), and finally to handicap\n(disadvantage). Research which is informed by the\ndisability model shares the idea that functioning\nshould be understood in terms of functional capa-\nbilities in relation to the constraints placed on the\nindividual by the outside world. In both its concepts\nand its measures, this model reflects an emphasis\non functional ability as a hypothetical construct,\nrather than actual performance in daily life. As an\nexample, in a recent test of the disability model\nusing data from the Longitudinal Study of Aging,\nLawrence and Jette (1996) excluded subjects who\nreported that they did not engage in ADL activities\nbecause \"it was not possible to determine if they\nwere abled or disable.\" This tendency to emphasize\nfunctional capability and to ignore functional per-\nformance reflects the history of the disability model\nas grounded in studies of functional status among\nolder patients in hospitals and nursing homes, far\nremoved from the real-world constraints which both\nenable and dampen functional performance out-\nside of the institutional setting.\nWhile the disability model continues to predomi-\nnate the research and policy arenas, several impor-\ntant criticisms of this model have emerged. Among\nthese concerns is that it remains focused on a nar-\nrow band of functioning, too closely linked to phys-\nical function and the presence of disease. Numerous\nresearchers have sought to broaden the definition\nof functioning beyond the limited scope of self-care\n(ADLs). First among the revisions was instrumental\nactivities of daily living (IADL), developed in the\n1970s, which were designed to better capture do-\nmains of functioning among persons living in the\ncommunity through the addition of domestic main-\ntenance tasks (Lawton & Brody, 1969; Lawton, Moss,\nMotivated primarily by concerns over measure-\nment problems, another group of researchers have\nargued for performance-based measures of func-\ntioning (Curalnik, Branch, Cummings, & Curb, 1989;\nmeasures have sought to minimize the difficulties\narising from the use of self-reports, and are an\nattempt to move beyond the assessment of the hy-\npothetical tense to which most standard self-\nreported ADL scales are limited. Yet, while the shift\nto performance-based assessments has been an im-\nportant extension into the experimental tense, this\nhas not lead to a generalized interest in perfor-\nmance outside the laboratory.\nStill others have called for a broadening of our\nconcepts of function toward social functioning\nJette (1994) have recently called for the inclusion of\nhigher-level activities including social and leisure\nactivity, trips, child care, and recreation. Other inves-\ntigators have begun to examine productive activity\nas one dimension of higher-level functioning (Butler\n& Gleason, 1985; Class, Seeman, Herzog, Kahn, &\nA second area of criticism of the disability model\nhas been that the emphasis on capabilities and diffi-\nculties has the unintended effect of removing the in-\ndividual from the social and physical context in which\nfunctioning actually takes place. In this way, the mea-\nsurement of functional status has resulted in a de-\ncontextualized view of functioning in older adults. As\na result, there has been a tendency to de-emphasize\ncompensatory strategies, work-arounds, and the vari-\nous coping strategies employed by persons in their\nhome settings. Feinstein, Josephy, and Well (1996) re-\nviewed forty three indices of functional disability\nconcluding that \"... the most striking omission in in-\ndexes of disability is the absence of attention to the\ncollaborative role of the patient.... With uncommon\nexception, the roles of personal effort and external\nsupport are constantly overlooked ...\" (p. 414).\nConjugating the Tenses of Function:\nEnacted Function Explained\nAccording to Webster's dictionary, to conjugate a\nverb is to \"recite or display all or some subsets of\nthe inflected forms of a verb in a fixed order.\" The\nconjugation of a verb describes the different forms\nof action as they relate to the temporal context of\nuse. In linguistics, distinctions are drawn between\npast, present, and future forms of verbs. For the\npurpose of this article, a different type of conjuga-\ntion is proposed in order to elucidate the meaning\nof functioning for the field of aging. For the pur-\nposes of this discussion, the idea of conjugation is\nnot used in its temporal meaning (past, present, and\nfuture). Rather, the idea of conjugation refers to\ndifferent aspects of what might be termed \"action\npotential.\" The three tenses described below may\neach exist in past, present, and future forms.\nFigure 2 provides a typology of how the concept\nof functioning might be conjugated in this manner.\nTraditional measures of functional status, as a con-\nsequence in part of the disability model, are primar-\nily examples of the hypothetical tense. Subjects are\nasked a range of questions about whether they are\nable to perform tasks, how difficult those tasks\nmight be, and whether they require help from peo-\nple or from assistive technologies. In each case, the\nresulting answer is the product of the respondent's\nabstract calculus based, presumably, on that sub-\nject's ability to average across situations and con-\ntexts. This calculation is most often unmeasured\nand unobserved.\nThe second tense might be called the experimen-\ntal tense in that instead of asking hypothetical ques-\ntions about presumed ability, respondents are\nasked to demonstrate functional capability in a clin-\nical (or experimental) setting. In the experimental\ntense, respondents are asked to simulate activities\nthat are thought to be representative of true func-\ntioning. As has been observed, this approach has\nthe advantage of offering direct observation of the\nsubject's ability and avoids some of the problems of\nself-reports. However, while this tense may ade-\nquately describe what a person is able to do under\nthe inspection of the clinical examiner, it tells us lit-\ntle about the reality of that respondent's function-\ning at home. The experimental tense refers, then, to\nthe demonstrated performance of what is hypothet-\nically possible, albeit subject to the conditions and\nlimitations of the experimental setting.\nA third tense, referred to here as the enacted\ntense, refers neither to hypothetical ability nor to\nwhat the individual is able to perform under special\nand circumscribed conditions. Instead, enacted func-\ntion refers to the functional performance realized\nby an individual within the home context. Enacted\nfunction, whether physical, cognitive, emotional or\nsocial, refers to the end result of the confluence of\nsituational and ecological factors which shape the\nmoment to moment performance of functional tasks\nin the real world. As such, enacted function is a lower\nlevel of abstraction. It requires no abstract calculus\nof what is possible, but requires instead the accurate\nrecollection of what has been or is now.\nThe central argument of this article is that within\nthe field of aging, the study of functioning has fo-\ncused almost exclusively on just one tense. We\nhave conceptualized functioning in terms of the in-\ndividual's capacity in the abstract, rather than what\nthat individual is doing now or has actually done in\nthe past. Researchers have constructed tests which\nassess the capability or difficulty of certain actions,\nHypothetical\n'Can do...\nI\nDefinition: capacity\nContext: none\nMeasures:\nSelf-report (or\nproxy)\n\"Are you able to...\"\n\"Any difficulty....\"\n\"Do you require\nassistance...\"\n\"How difficult is it\nto....\"\nQ.O.L. items\nExperimental Enacted\n'Could do... 'Do do...\nDefinition: capability\nContext: labratory\nDefinition: performance\nContext: home\nMeasures:\nPerformance-based\ntesting (or\nobservation)\nTimed performance\nQualitative\nassessment\nTask completion\nStandardized test\nscores\nMeasures:\nSelf-report, proxy, or\nobservation\nFrequency/duration\nof activity/role/task\nProductive output\nCalories expended\nPhysiological\nmarkers\nOccupational status\nFigure 2. Conceptual scheme for conjugating the tenses of functioning.\nbut exclude the question of whether those actions\nare actually performed. In short, a conceptual frame-\nwork has emerged within gerontology based on the\nhypothetical rather than the enacted tense of func-\ntion. Further, the predominant measurement tools\nin common use in the field reflect and are driven by\nthis framework.\nThe usefulness of this approach to conceptualiz-\ning function is not to argue that any one perspec-\ntive is inherently superior to the others. In fact, the\nvery quality that makes one tense better suited to\none application may be its weakness in another. For\nexample, Guralnik and colleagues (1989) correctly\nassert that one advantage of performance-based\nmeasures (experimental tense) over ADL scales (hy-\npothetical tense) is that the former are less influ-\nenced by \"cognition, culture, language, and educa-\ntion.\" However, in another research context, these\nsame factors may be of primary interest. If an inves-\ntigator wishes to research how factors such as lan-\nguage, culture, education, cognition, social support,\nor other host characteristics impact levels of func-\ntional performance, measures based on either the\nhypothetical or the experimental tense may be insuf-\nficient. All three tenses may represent different and\nindependent ways in which individuals think about\nfunctioning. If that is true, gerontologists need to\ndevelop parallel and complementary measurement\ntools to accommodate those perspectives.\nTo a large extent, these alternatives already exist.\nAny standard textbook on questionnaire design will\ninclude a discussion of how question construction\nimpacts the resulting data that is generated (this\nwas pointed out by an anonymous reviewer of an\nearlier draft of this paper). Research on functioning,\nas well as public policy, however, continues to rely\nalmost exclusively on the hypothetical tense. Only\nrecently have attempts to further elucidate the ex-\nperimental tense become widespread. Rarely has\nthis led to extensive investigation of the enacted\ntense. The purpose of this article, moreover, is to\ndraw out the importance of the distinction among\nthe three, and to make a case for the importance of\nthe enacted tense.\nEmphasis on the hypothetical tense has produced\nconsiderable progress in the field. The ADL disabil-\nity scales were designed to capture gross depar-\ntures from optimal functioning for purposes of pre-\ndicting those at increased risk for nursing home\nadmission or death (Applegate, Blass, & Williams,\n1990). Most of these scales, including Katz, the\nBarthel index, and the original PULSES scales were\ndeveloped for use among hospitalized patients\n(Wagner, 1987). In the hospital setting, the hypo-\nthetical nature of these instruments is clearly more\nappropriate; although as several commentators have\nnoted, the emphasis ought to shift to actual perfor-\nmance of functional tasks as the patient moves from\nthe hospital to home (Fuhrer, 1987). As a predictor,\nrather than as an outcome, the disability indices are\nwell suited to this task.\nTraditional disability scales also have advantages\nfor public policy because they allow for the identifi-\ncation of environmental barriers and impediments\nmore easily. As a basis for deciding who is eligible\nfor health or social services, it may be best to ex-\nclude the contingencies of the home environment,\nor at least to minimize their influence as a way of\nensuring equity in resource allocation. In this sense,\nasking subjects if they are able to perform a task in\nthe hypothetical allows us to separate, or to hold\nconstant, the complexity which arises from the in-\ntroduction of the social, physical, and cultural con-\ntexts that shape and modify actual performance.\nA Graphical Representation of Two Tenses\nTo further illustrate the importance of this distinc-\ntion, Figure 3 depicts a simple 2-by-2 table which\ncontrasts the hypothetical tense (functional capac-\nity), as measured by most commonly used ADL\nscales, with the enacted tense. Enacted function\nrefers to the extent and quality of functional perfor-\nmance realized by an individual within a particular\nsocio-physical context. Individuals who fall on the\ndiagonal (Types I and IV) may be said to be concor-\ndant between the hypothetical and enacted tenses\nof functioning. For these individuals, ADL scales\nwould be valid and reliable measures of both func-\ntional capability and actual performance. The term\nactual performance here refers to functional perfor-\nmance within a naturalistic social setting, as con-\ntrasted to performance achieved in a clinical setting\nor under experimental conditions.\nTypes II and III, on the other hand, represent a\nsubstantial measurement challenge that has seldom\nbeen explicitly addressed in aging research. Type II\nindividuals enact high levels of functional perfor-\nmance despite significant difficulty, disability, or di-\nminished capacity. The reasons for this discordance\nare many, and are not well understood. These indi-\nviduals might be thought of as \"over-achievers\" in\nthe sense that within the context of their home envi-\nronment, they are functioning at a higher level than\nthat which they are presumed to be capable. Type III\nindividuals, on the other hand, actually function at\nFunctional performance at home\n(Enacted \"tense\")\nLow High\nType I\nLow\nfunctioning\nType III\nUnder-\nachievers\nType II\nOver-\nachievers\nType IV\nHigh\nfunctioning\nLow\nFunctional capacity\n(Hypothetical \"tense\")\nHigh\nFigure 3. Cross-classification of \"hypothetical\" and \"enacted'\ntenses of functioning.\nlower levels than would be predicted by ADL scales.\nDespite the absence of limiting factors such as dis-\nease, impairments, or disability, these individuals do\nnot actually perform the tasks about which they are\nbeing asked. These \"under-achievers\" may lead sed-\nentary, immobile lives, and potentially are quite de-\npendent on others. Again, the reasons for this dis-\ncordance are numerous.\nEvidence from Previous Research\nWhile a general awareness of this issue can be\nseen throughout the literature on functioning, very\nfew investigators have studied the problem directly.\nThis author's own interest in this phenomenon was\ncatalyzed during qualitative interviews with surviving\nmembers of the New Haven EPESE cohort. Among\nthem was a gentleman in his late 80s who reported a\nhigh level of ADL impairment, yet spent most of his\ndays sailing his boat up and down the Connecticut\nriver. When asked about how he maintained the\nboat, he demonstrated how he would use duct-tape\nto affix a paint brush to his cane to apply a new coat\nof paint to his boat every Spring. Equally common\nwas the story of a woman in her 70s who reported\nthat she was able to do everything for herself, while\nmaintaining that all she really did was watch televi-\nsion all day while her 60 year old son with conges-\ntive heart failure \"waited on her hand-and-foot.\"\nDuring these interviews, it became increasingly\nclear that it is an error to assume that functional ca-\npacity and performance are the same.\nSeveral commentators have noted the lack of\nstudies which investigate the reliability and validity\nof functional disability measures in general (Mc-\nDowell & Newell, 1987). Beyond these general criti-\ncisms, a number of researchers have noted a differ-\nence between functional capacity and performance\nD'Agostino, & Odell, 1992; Patrick, Darby, Green,\nHorton, Locker, & Wiggins, 1981; Verbrugge & Jette,\nexample, some evidence suggests that those who re-\nport impaired capacity in one or more domains are\nsimultaneously quite active and high-functioning in\nother domains which are assumed to require high\ndegrees of capacity. In a study of religious participa-\ntion among members of the New Haven EPESE co-\nhort, Idler (1987) concludes that \"... functional dis-\nability does not entirely determine behavior: 98 of\nthe sample's 358 severely disabled women (who re-\nported that they needed assistance in crossing a\nroom, feeding themselves, bathing, etc.) also report\na frequency of attendance at services of once a\nweek or more often.\" Miner, Logan, & Spitz (1993)\nalso found that functional disability is unrelated to\nfrequency of attending senior centers. Findings from\nthe Health Insurance Study (HIS) have shown that\nsome subjects who report limitations in physical\nactivity report no corresponding limitations in role\nactivities (Stewart, Ware, & Brook, 1981). In each\ncase, these findings were seen as anomalies, and\nwere not interpreted as signs of the weakness of a\nmore general model of functioning.\nIn their influential study of the correlation among\nself-reported, interviewer-administered, and perfor-\nmance-based testing of functional abilities, Reuben\net al. (1995) found the relationships to be \"inconsis-\ntent and weak, suggesting that these instruments\nare not measuring the same construct.\" It is pos-\nsible that differences between self-reports, inter-\nviews, and performance testing reflect more than\nmeasurement error. They may also reflect differ-\nences in the meanings of different questions asked\nin various ways. Several investigators have shown\nthat subjects will tend to interpret questions about\nfunctioning in ways that are often different than\nwhat researchers intend (Keller, Kovar, Jobe, &\nBranch, 1993), and that the same subjects within the\nsame disease group, who are given different disabil-\nity questionnaires, will evidence substantially differ-\nent levels of disability (Ziebland et al., 1993). These\ndiscrepancies may also reflect the inherent unrelia-\nbility of asking questions in the hypothetical tense\n(Anderson, Bush, & Berry, 1989). They also reflect, in\npart, differences in the \"tacit models\" (Ziebland et\nal., 1993) which underlie the construction of disabil-\nity instruments.\nThe few studies that have examined multiple\ntenses suggest that reduced function in the enacted\ntense may be more prevalent than is observed in\nthe hypothetical tense (Type III discordance). In a\nrecent study, Kelly-Hayes et al. (1992) used Nagi's\ndistinction between functional limitation (capacity)\nand disability (closest to enacted) to look at data\nfrom the Framingham study. Their findings suggest\nsubstantial discrepancies between the two and, in\nmost cases in which differences were observed, re-\nspondents reported a disability (enacted tense) and\nnot a functional limitation (hypothetical tense). In\naddition, they found that psychosocial factors were\nmore strongly associated with disabilities than they\nwere with limitations. This last finding is important\nbecause it suggests that the impact of psychosocial\nfactors may be greater in determining the enacted\nrather than hypothetical tense of function. This ob-\nservation is supported by Mendes de Leon et al.\n(1996) who studied both the experimental tense\n(physical performance) and the hypothetical tense\n(ADL questions) over time and found the relation-\nship to be mediated by self-efficacy.\nIn another study, Patrick et al. (1981) looked at\ndata from two community surveys of a London bor-\nough and found considerable differences across the\ntwo waves based on what they termed \"capacity\nwording\" versus \"performance wording\" of their\ndisability questions. In the study that used the per-\nformance wording (enacted tense), investigators\nfound as much as a two-fold increase in the preva-\nlence of disability, leading the authors to suggest\nthat studies based on capacity wording may sub-\nstantially under-estimate the true prevalence of dis-\nability in populations. A similar conclusion was\nreached by Anderson et al. (1989) who found that\n\"capacity wording\" of questions produced an under-\nreporting of dysfunction of at least 10%. Based on\nthe studies by Patrick, Kelly-Hayes, Anderson, and\nothers, it is likely that discrepancies between the\ntwo tenses of function may be substantial, and that\nreliance exclusively on instruments which assess\nonly the hypothetical tense may lead to biased esti-\nmates of disability rates as well as an underestima-\ntion of the importance of psychosocial factors in\nlate-life functioning.\nThree Examples of Discordance: Data From\nthe MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging\nWe now turn to an empirical example that illus-\ntrates the importance of what has been argued so far.\nIn order to estimate the magnitude of discordance\nbetween reported capacity and actual functional per-\nformance, we would ideally choose data that were\ndrawn from a randomly chosen and community-\nbased study of the elderly. We would hope to have\nindicators of functional capacity and enacted func-\ntioning that would be sensitive to higher-level activ-\nities as well as gross impairments and disability in\nthe physical domains. And, we would hope for mea-\nsures of both capacity and actual performance that\nwere directly observed or performance based (on\nboth counts) rather than self-reports alone. Data\nthat meet all of these criteria are currently unavail-\nable. However, for the purpose of illustration, data\nfrom the MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging\nhave several important advantages. First, although\nnot intentional, the MacArthur battery asked two\nsets of questions about several domains of function\nin both the hypothetical and enacted tenses. First,\ntraditional functional disability questions were\nasked about the extent to which the respondent\nfeels that they are able to accomplish a task. Then,\nmuch later in the interview, under items which are\npart of a battery of productive activity questions,\nsubjects were asked whether and how often those\nsame tasks were actually performed. These data\nthen afford the opportunity to explore the extent of\ndiscordance between the hypothetical and the en-\nacted tenses of functioning. It should be stressed\nthat while these data offer a rich opportunity to esti-\nmate the magnitude of concordance or discor-\ndance, the MacArthur study was not designed to\ninvestigate this question and there are several no-\ntable limitations associated with these data. For ex-\nample, both sets of questions are self-reports and\nare therefore subject to the problems associated\ntherewith.\nAging researchers have begun to study produc-\ntive activities -- or those activities which generate\ngoods and services of economic value -- as a marker\nof \"successful\" aging (Cutler & Danigelis, 1993;\nClass et al., 1995; Herzog, Antonucci, Jackson, Kahn,\n& Morgan, 1987). For the purpose of this study,\nquestions about productive activity are good indica-\ntors of enacted functioning because they ask the\nfrequency and duration of routine activities as they\nwere actually performed. Productive activity is also\nan ideal indicator of global enacted functioning be-\ncause it represents high-level functioning which re-\nquires performance in the social, physical, and cog-\nnitive domains.\nMethods\nSubjects\nThe data used in these analyses are from the\nMacArthur Research Network on Successful Aging\nField Study, a longitudinal study of high func-\ntioning men and women aged 70-79. Details of the\nstudy design are available elsewhere (Berkman,\nSeeman, Blazer, Kahn, Mohs, Finch, Schneider, Cot-\nman, McClearn, Nesselroade, Featherman, Gar-\nmezy, McKhann, Brim, Pragar, & Rowe, 1993). Sub-\njects were drawn from three sites of the Established\nPopulations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the El-\nderly (EPESE): Durham, NC; East Boston, MA; and\nNew Haven, CT. Men and women aged 70-79 were\nselected on the basis of physical and cognitive func-\ntion at the time of their 1988 EPESE interview. Age-\neligible men and women (N = 4,030) were screened\non the basis of six criteria to identify a relatively\n\"high functioning\" cohort, representing approxi-\nmately the top third of their age peers in terms of\nphysical and cognitive function. Of the 1,313 sub-\nparticipate and provided informed consent. Base-\nline data collection was completed between May\nminute, face-to-face interview covering detailed as-\nsessments of physical and cognitive performance as\nwell as information regarding health status. A three\nyear follow-up interview was conducted in 1991.\nHowever, this study uses only data from the base-\nline interview.\nFor comparison purposes, a smaller subsample of\nsubjects was interviewed at baseline (n = 163) who\nwere chosen to represent the middle and low ter-\ntiles of functioning using the same criteria. This\ngroup was chosen to permit comparisons with the\nhigh functioning subjects in order to determine\nthose physical and psychosocial factors that dis-\ncriminate \"successful\" from \"usual\" patterns of\naging. The medium and low functioning groups\nwere not re-interviewed at follow-up.\nMeasures\nFeatures of the data collection and sampling stra-\ntegies for the EPESE studies have been well de-\nscribed regarding sociodemographic characteristics\n(Cornoni-Huntley, Ostfeld, Taylor, Wallace, Blazer,\nBerkman, Evans, Kohout, Lemke, Scherr, & Korper,\n1993). Variables used in these analyses include age,\nsex, race, and marital status. Age was recorded as of\nthe date of the subject's 1988 MacArthur interview,\nmarried at baseline, 0 if not).\nOur objective in this study was to cross-classify\nindicators of functioning across two distinct tenses.\nTo accomplish this goal within the limitations of the\nMacArthur data, three comparisons were made\nusing data from questions both about hypothetical\nand enacted tenses. Functional disability scales in-\ncluded in the MacArthur battery include a 7-item\nmeasure of limitations in activities of daily living as\ndeveloped by Katz et al. (1970), a measure of gross\nmobility based on the work of Nagi (1976), and\na self-reported measure of physical performance\n(Rosow & Breslau, 1966), all of which use wording\nthat reflects the hypothetical tense. Among high-\nfunctioning respondents, there was no variance on\nthe Katz ADL index, and only limited variance on\nthe Nagi and Rosow-Breslau scales (see Appendix,\nFirst, we focused on two items from the Rosow-\nBreslau index which include: 1) \"Are you able to do\nheavy housework like washing windows, walls, or\nfloors without help?\" [coded yes, no, or refused];\nand 2) \"Are you able to walk 1/2 mile without help?\"\n[coded yes, no, and refused]. For the third compari-\nson, summary indices of potential versus enacted\ntenses were used, including self-reported limita-\ntions in ability to function in either the Nagi and the\nRosow-Breslau scales and a summary index of pro-\nductive activities (enacted tense).\nTo measure enacted function, or the level of\nfunctional performance as realized by each subject\nin their home, 18 items from the productive activi-\nties battery developed by the MacArthur Successful\nAging network in conjunction with colleagues from\nthe Americans Changing Lives study (Herzog, Kahn,\nMorgan, Jackson, & Antonucci, 1989). For our first\ntwo comparisons, individual items from the produc-\ntive activity battery which paralleled items from the\nRosow-Breslau scale were used, including questions\nwhich asked \"Do you currently do any heavy house-\nwork?\" and \"Do you walk at least 1/2 city block per\nday?\" [both items coded yes, no, refuses, don't\nknow]. For the third comparison, a summary index\nof productive activities developed in an earlier\nstudy was used (Glass et al., 1995). This scale com-\nbines information on five dimensions of productive\nactivity chosen to represent the activities commonly\nengaged in by older people which produce eco-\nnomic goods or services including: 1) housework, 2)\nyard work, 3) child care, 4) paid work, and 5) volun-\nteer work. In the present study, the summary index\nwas divided into tertiles for the high-functioning\ngroup, as well as the medium- to low-fuctioning\ncomparison group.\npothetical and enacted function are presented in\nTables 2, 3, and 4. In Table 2, the ability to perform\nheavy housework is cross-tabulated with the actual\nperformance of heavy housework. Note that the\ndata are presented for the high-functioning group\n(HF) and the medium- to low-functioning group\n(MLF) separately. Only 6% of the HF group say they\nare not able to do heavy housework. Of that group,\nTable 1.

In comparing the high-functioning\nsample (labeled successful agers in the MacArthur\nstudy) to the medium- to low-functioning group\n(usual agers), the high-functioning group, as ex-\npected, is younger, less likely to be of minority de-\nscent and less cognitively impaired. With the ex-\nception of a difference in education among women,\nthe two groups are not notably different in educa-\ntion or income. Among the high-functioning group,\nwomen were more likely to be married. In both\ngroups, just over half (55%) of the sample is female.\nThe results of the three comparisons between hy-\nTable 2.

Similarly, among those with no limi-\ntations, 30% are in the lowest tertile of productivity.\nAmong medium- to low-functioning respondents,\n31% are in the highest tertile of productivity despite\nreporting three or more functional limitations. Fi-\nnally, 28% of those with no limitations are among\nthe least productive subjects.\nTable 4.

Among the MLF\ngroup, just over half say they are not able to do\nheavy housework, while 38% of that group reports\nthat they do heavy housework. Conversely, among\nthose who said that they were able to do heavy\nhousework, 7% of the HF group and 23% of the MLF\ngroup reported that they, in fact, did not do any\nheavy housework.\nTable 3 presents results of a similar analysis for\nwalking. In this case, the wording of the two ques-\ntions was not exactly the same. Here we contrast\nthose who said they were or were not able to walk\none-half mile without help, with those who walk at\nleast one-half city block per day. Among the HF\ngroup, only 3% said they were not able to walk one-\nhalf mile without help. Among that group of 37 re-\nspondents, 65% said they walk one-half city block\nper day. Among the MLF group, 40% of those who\nsaid they are not able to walk one-half mile, re-\nported that they did walk at least one-half city block\neach day. Among those who said they are able to\nwalk one-half mile, nearly one-quarter walk less\nthan one-half city block per day.\nFinally, Table 4 presents a similar analysis which\nlooks at any self-reported impairment in the hypo-\nthetical tense with a summary index of enacted\nfunction. We contrast those who report 0 versus 1-2\nversus 3 or more functional limitations (Nagi or\nRosow-Breslau), with the index of productive activi-\nties broken into tertiles. In first looking at the diago-\nnal cells of the Table, a consistent pattern is visible.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of presenting these data has been to\ncall attention to the possibility of substantial dis-\ncordance between answers to questions about func-\ntional capacity and actual performance in the home\ncontext. A thorough and comprehensive examina-\ntion of this discordance is beyond the scope of these\ndata and this study. These data are clearly not with-\nout limits. However, although others have pointed\nout the importance of question design in studies of\nfunctional status (Anderson, Bush, & Berry, 1989;\n1992), few investigators have taken seriously the idea\nthat functional performance may be as important as\nfunctional capacity. In the absence of better data,\nthese analyses suggest a relatively consistent picture.\nAcross multiple comparisons, the degree of discor-\ndance between hypothetical and enacted tenses of\nfunction appears to be between the range of 25%\nand 35%. That is, many older persons appear to be\nboth overachieving and underachieving in their\nfunctional performance relative to self-reports of\nfunctional capacity as measured by standard in-\ndices. This discordance appears to be relatively\nsymmetrical in that the magnitude of overachieving\nroughly matches the magnitude of underachieving.\nThis suggests that failure to include separate assess-\nments of performance may lead to considerable\nmisclassification and measurement error.\nWhy Does This Matter?\nIs the distinction between hypothetical, experi-\nmental, and enacted tenses simply a linguistic trick,\nor are the implications of this argument important?\nIs there anything here beyond simple measurement\nerror? In the remainder of this discussion, eight rea-\nsons for the significance and importance of this\nphenomenon are presented.\nMissing Information. -- Social and behavioral sci-\nentists have increasingly moved toward a broader\nand richer conception of aging. The new themes\nhave been heterogeneity, fluidity, adaptation, modi-\nfiability, and \"successful aging\" (Berkman, 1988;\nepidemiological data sets, much has been learned\nabout the plasticity of human aging. Old notions of\naging as an inevitable process of decline and loss\nof capacity are being replaced. Many of these ideas\nconfirm and reiterate the conventional wisdom that\nas we age, the mind matters. Regrettably, the devel-\nopment of new multidimensional instruments for\nthe assessment of global functioning in all its facets\nhas lagged behind. Instead, aging researchers have\nrelied on measures designed in the 1960s largely for\nclinical purposes, which are based almost exclu-\nsively on the hypothetical tense. Designed to cap-\nture the physiological substrata underlying func-\ntional status, these instruments have been less\nsuccessful at capturing how elderly people are actu-\nally functioning in their daily lives. As a result, a rig-\norous assessment and subsequent investigation of\nthe contribution of psychosocial factors to function-\ning has been lacking. A new sensitivity to the impor-\ntance of multiple tenses of functioning is needed as\nwell as new and innovative tools for disaggregating\nthose tenses.\nWill the Real Disability Please Stand Up? - It is\nwidely recognized that the definition and measure-\nment of disability has a profound impact on the\nrates of disability observed in a given population.\nFor example, Jette (1994) shows that wording based\non \"difficulty\" as opposed to the need for \"human\nassistance\" resulted in disability estimates that were\n1.2 to 5 times greater. Given the importance of\nwording, it may be especially important to measure\nactual performance of self-care tasks independently\nof difficulties and help, both human and non-human.\nAnd while some studies clearly focus appropriately\non the identification of impairments at the hypo-\nthetical tense, it may be equally important to begin\nto recognize that what really matters most, both in\nrelation to quality of life, and as a true marker of un-\nderlying risk of poor outcome, is not what people\ncan do, but what they do do.\nEvaluation of Interventions: A Better Mousetrap.\n-- The main goal of health interventions is the opti-\nmization or restoration of the actual, functional per-\nformance of life activities. As Kane and Kane (1987)\nobserve, \"If long-term care is directed at improving\nor maintaining functioning, then its success can be\nmeasured by functional outcomes\" (p. 107). Yet, our\nevaluation tools often pertain only to whether help\nis needed, not whether it is received; whether diffi-\nculties are encountered, not whether they are over-\ncome; and whether performance is possible, not\nwhether it is achieved. By definition, outcome mea-\nsures which tap into performance will be more ap-\npropriate and definitive than those that ask only\nabout the hypothetical ability to function. The re-\nverse is also true. As observed by Anderson et al.\n(1989), \"Treatment programs should not take credit\n(and resources) for restoring function that does not\nexist.\" (p. 15). Interventions which do not translate\nreductions in capacity into corresponding incre-\nments in performance are clearly less effective than\nthose that do.\nIn addition, interventions targeted at the enacted\ntense may require different strategies and ap-\nproaches. As the work of Mendes de Leon and others\nhave shown (Mendes de Leon, Fillenbaum, Williams,\nBrock, Beckett, & Berkman, 1995), attention to issues\nsuch as self-efficacy may be necessary in order to\ntranslate the benefits of increased capacity into the\nultimate goal of increased function as realized in the\nresidential context.\nThe Underestimation of Life-Context -- In addi-\ntion to the survey data shown here, this research is\nbased on in-depth interviews conducted by the au-\nthor in an effort to determine the meanings of vari-\nous types of questions about functioning and their\nrelation to quality of life in late life. As a conse-\nquence of this qualitative work, it became increas-\ningly clear that functional performance is substan-\ntially shaped by the social and cultural context of\nthe home-world and that functioning cannot be un-\nderstood in the absence of that context (Class, 1991;\nhas relied so heavily on large-scale survey studies\nthat include little information about that social con-\ntext data, it is perhaps not surprising that the field\nhas tended to underestimate its importance (Kasl,\n1995). By integrating qualitative data collected in\nnaturalistic settings with large scale survey data, a\nlevel of richness and insight can be achieved which\nis lacking when either type of data is examined\nalone. In many interviews, subjects answered ques-\ntions about the hypothetical tense, then gave much\ndifferent answers when asked to describe what they\nactually did. There exists a need for more qualitative\nstudies of functioning in the real world which ex-\nplore explicitly the different tenses of function and\nhow discrepancies are understood as meaningful by\nolder persons.\nCompensatory Strategies. -- Aging specialists have\nlong recognized that older persons cope differ-\nently, and vary in their use of compensatory strate-\ngies and technologies in dealing with the challenges\nof late life. The concept of compensation is particu-\nlarly important for identifying factors which help\ndisabled persons overcome those challenges and\navoid the handicaps that can result. Forms of com-\npensation might include substitution of goals, slower\ntimetables, help from equipment or from others,\nenvironmental modification, avoidance of hazard,\nor even greater effort. The concept of compensa-\ntion is appealing if for no other reason than it casts\nthe disabled person in a heroic light. However, to\nthe extent that enacted function is not measured in-\ndependently of the hypothetical tense, it becomes\nnearly impossible to fully explore the impact of these\ncompensatory strategies. It may be argued that the\ndiscordance observed in these data represents little\nmore than the effects of these various strategies\n(i.e., help from people or specialized equipment).\nCertainly the need to perform productive activities\ndepends on more than the ability to do so, but also\non the need to produce as dictated by one's socioe-\nconomic resources. It is possible that the failure to\nmeasure the two tenses separately has led to a sys-\ntematic myopia, whereby the real importance and\nsignificance of those types of help may be substan-\ntially underestimated.\nDeterminants of Under and Over Achievement. --\nIt is not a novel observation that some elders seem\nto overcome seemingly extraordinary challenges,\nwhile others appear to be devastated by only minor\ndisabilities (Hickey, 1980). This observation should be\nobvious and compelling to clinicians, as it is to any-\none who has known a \"super\" grandparent. How-\never, the disability model, which ends with handicap,\nleaves off prior to the endpoint of actual perfor-\nmance within broad fuctional domains. As such, we\ncurrently lack the tools, both methodologically and\nconceptually, to study those factors most closely as-\nsociated with these two discordant types. What are\nthe factors that are associated with overcoming im-\npairments among those living in the community?\nWhat are the factors which are associated with low\nlevels of enacted function, despite the relative ab-\nsence of disease or disability? This may be an espe-\ncially important risk group as is indicated by studies\nshowing the deleterious consequences of inactivity\n(Hartley, 1985; Kannel, Belanger, D'Agostino, & Israel,\nWing, & Hsieh, 1986; Simonsick, Lafferty, Phillips,\nMendes, Kasl, Seeman, Fillenbaum, Hebert, & Lemke,\n1993). By developing new tools for the assessment of\nenacted function, the capability to address these\nquestions will be substantially enhanced.\nDifferential Discordance Across Age Categories.\n-- There is evidence that the discrepancies between\nhypothetical and enacted tenses may be greater in\nolder people than in younger people. That is, mea-\nsures based on the hypothetical tense alone may\nbe especially poor markers of actual functioning in\nolder populations, therefore leading to unwarranted\nconclusions about the prevalence of dysfunction. For\nexample, in a study of stroke recovery Ferrucci and\nhis colleagues (Ferrucci, Bandinelli, Guralnik, Lam-\nponi, Berttini, Falchini, & Baroni, 1993) looked at the\nrelation between motor impairment (an index of\nfunctional capability as it relates to the stroke's sever-\nity) and functional performance (measured using the\nBarthel Index of ADL). Their findings, based on a\nprospective study of 50 first-time stroke survivors,\nshow that motor impairment predicts most of the\nrecovery that is observed among younger people\n(<65), while older subjects were \"more likely to em-\nploy compensatory strategies to overcome some of\nthe neural impairment that remains after stroke\" (p.\n200). Older persons kept pace with the recovery of\nyounger persons in terms of enacted function, de-\nspite demonstrating significantly less improvement\nat the motor level. Studies such as this one suggest\nthat the need to look at enacted and hypothetical\nfunction independently may be more acute among\nthe oldest old.\nA Strategy for Measuring Successful Aging. -- Re-\nsearch in aging over the last decade has emphasized\npopulation heterogeneity and a widening of the\nscope of factors thought to determine functioning\ncessful,\" \"normal,\" and \"pathological\" patterns of\naging is now widely recognized (Baltes & Baltes, 1990;\nsuccessful aging has not been fully translated into\noperational measures and testable hypotheses, with\nsome notable exceptions. The distinction between\nhypothetical and enacted function may be a key to\nfurther specifying (and measuring) the mechanisms\nunderlying successful aging. In this study, discrep-\nancies were observed between what respondents\nsay they are able to do, and how they actually per-\nform. The observation of these discrepancies is\nespecially important among a cohort of older sub-\njects who were selected to be homogeneous and\nhigh-functioning. Many of the psychosocial factors\nthat have been linked with successful aging includ-\ning social networks and supports, resiliency, per-\nsonality characteristics, motivation, and self-efficacy\nmay be more closely associated with enacted func-\ntion than with its more hypothetical forms. A new\nmethod of measuring enacted function will create\nadditional avenues for the empirical study of suc-\ncessful aging beyond what has yet been achieved.\nConclusions and Implications\nThis article has proposed a conceptual model to\ndescribe and understand differences between func-\ntional capacity and actual functional performance in\nthe home. Although the importance of the wording\nof survey questions is commonly recognized, the\ndevelopment and implementation of new measures\nof enacted function have lagged. Cerontological re-\nsearch has remained focused on standard measures\nof function which are limited to the assessment of\ncapability (hypothetical tense). The absence of inde-\npendent measurement of the separate tenses of\nfunction may lead to misclassification of risk, mea-\nsurement error, and a gap in research on the im-\nportance of psychosocial factors and compensatory\nstrategies. It has been argued that the distinction\namong hypothetical, experimental and enacted func-\ntion is more than semantic, and more than a techni-\ncal detail of question design, but addresses the\nways in which the field of aging has tended to con-\nceptualize functioning and how the history of the\nfield informs our understanding of that conceptual-\nization. Several empirical examples were provided\nfrom the MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging\nwhich suggest a consistent pattern of substantial\ndiscordance between the hypothetical and enacted\ntenses of functioning. The full extent of, and expla-\nnations for, these discrepancies remain poorly un-\nderstood and, in large part, masked by the concepts\nand measures currently in wide use.\nThe implications of this argument for researchers,\ninterventionists, and policy makers are potentially\nfar-reaching. Research is needed to compare inde-\npendent assessments of the three tenses of function.\nThis will require the development of additional mea-\nsurement tools specifically designed to capture en-\nacted function to complement established methods\nfor the assessment of disability (hypothetical tense)\nand physical performance (experimental tense).\nMeasures of enacted function could be developed in\nboth self-report and observer-rated formats. In ei-\nther case, these new measures must be designed to\ncapture functional performance in the home setting,\nand must be sensitive to both the frequency and du-\nration of functional performance. These new mea-\nsures may be quite useful for designers of interven-\ntions. As an outcome, enacted function can be used\nto assess the efficacy of interventions more precisely\nbecause in tapping actual performance, rather than\njust capability, they capture the complex influences\nof the social and physical milieu, all of which are rel-\nevant to the ultimate efficacy of any intervention. In\nthe policy domain, many programs utilize standard\nADL scales to determine eligibility, despite evidence\nwhich suggests that \"capacity wording\" leads to un-\nderestimation of the true extent of functional diffi-\nculties (Anderson, Bush, & Berry, 1989; Kelly-Hayes et\nmeasures of enacted function would allow for more\nvalid and reliable estimation of true disability in pop-\nulations, and would lead to the identification of\nunder-served groups. Finally, dual assessments of\nhypothetical and enacted function will identify the\nprevalence of discrepant patterns II and III (over-\nand under-achieving) which constitute, in one case,\nan important new category of risk and, in the other\ncase, an important new phenomenon for study. In\nshort, much can be learned from those individuals\nfor whom assessments of how they might function\nand how they do function do not coincide.\nReferences\nAnderson, J. P., Bush, J.

There are minor differences in the language used by\ndifferent authors in the disability tradition. Where Nagi\nuses the terms \"disability\" and \"handicap\" (Nagi, 1965),\nVerbrugge and Jette use instead the terms \"functional\nlimitations\" and \"disability\" (Verbrugge & Jette, 1994).\n2. Subjects were considered to be high-functioning if\nthey met several criteria including a) no disability on\nthe Katz ADL scale, b) not more than one disability\nitem on either the Rosow-Breslau or Nagi scales of\ngross mobility and physical performance, and c) a\nscore of 6 or higher on the 9-item test of cognitive per-\nformance developed by Pfieffer."
