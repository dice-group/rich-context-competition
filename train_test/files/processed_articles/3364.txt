Over the last decade, the night-time economy (NTE)\nand its regulation, management and policing has emerged as a key focus\nfor urban public policy, reflecting the changing character of urban sites,\nparticularly the rise of a new alcohol-fuelled, consumption-driven, night-time\nof many urban centres has been remarkable, with the commercial and\ncivic remnants of past economic eras having morphed into `themed' pubs\nand `designer' bars and clubs, thus mirroring the ubiquitous chain stores,\ndesigner boutiques and franchised coffee shops of daylight consumption.\nThese licensed premises are often clustered into easily identifiable zones,\nnotable for their youth-orientation and focus upon alcohol consumption as\nkey social activity, economic driver, and cultural motif.\nAs a result of these environmental characteristics, nightlife zones are\ncontested spaces. Social disorders, such as public drunkenness--observable\nas stable patterns of socially proscribed behaviour amongst the street\npopulation--elicit very different perceptions and emotions among different\ndirect experience, or vicariously through local gossip and media filtration,\nthese dramas of intoxication signal fun and adventure for some, and\ndanger, stress and anxiety for others (Thomas and Bromley, 2000). Given\nthe perennial attractions of being `where the action is' (Goffman, 1967),\nBritain's major nightlife areas routinely entice up to 100,000 revellers, a\ntransient population whose footfall places severe stresses on extant modes\nof governance within these sites of consumption.\nIn response to the pressures associated with the NTE, novel attempts to\ndevelop and sustain `partnership' working are emerging from an increasingly\nvariegated mix of agencies including police, local authorities, health trusts, the\nlicensed trade, security companies, residents groups, and charitable/voluntary\nagencies. Since November 2005, these activities have been orchestrated\npartly in accordance with the four statutory objectives of the Licensing Act\n2003: the prevention of crime and disorder, the promotion of public safety,\nthe prevention of public nuisance and the protection of children from harm.\nThe importance of this legislation cannot be underestimated as it has inserted\nthe control of alcohol into the heart of urban governance (see, for example,\nThe pairing of situational crime prevention technologies with various\nforms of spatially-targeted powers that threaten restrictions on the presence,\nbehaviour, and movement of individuals and groups, is now ubiquitous\nin British towns and cities, as in other cultural contexts and jurisdictions\n(Hadfield, 2009a). This intense activity has been informed by the realization\nthat private security governance, as performed by pubs and clubs, is\nnecessary, but insufficient to tackle the problems of (dis)order generated\nHadfield et al.--Policing and regulating the night-time economy 467\nwithin these social milieux (Hadfield, 2008).

Various civil/criminal and public/private mechanisms for\nregulating public and quasi-public space are then described and analysed on\nthe basis of the findings of a recent qualitative research project on local and\nnational alcohol policy.\nControlling the night: A decade of grip tightening\nToward the end of the 1990s, pronounced rises in recorded violence and\ncriminal damage were correlated with temporal and spatial patterns of\neconomic development within the NTE (Hobbs et al., 2003; Home Office,\nto the licensing laws, introduced through the implementation of the 2003\nAct, a highly politicized context emerged in which public, media and prof-\nessional concerns regarding alcohol-related crime and disorder (and the\nhealth implications of national drinking patterns) conspired to create a crisis\nof legitimacy for the British state. As a consequence, numerous concessions\nin the form of new powers and funding for police and local authorities\nwere made to counterbalance or reconfigure what had been a thoroughly\nneo-liberal policy agenda in which the alcohol industry appeared to have\nSubsequently, a series of Home Office funded enforcement campaigns were\nMisuse Enforcement Campaign (AMEC), the Tackling Underage Sales of\nAlcohol Campaign (TUSAC) and the Responsible Alcohol Sales Campaign\n(RASC) to tackle alcohol-related disorder. These police-led campaigns\nwere augmented by a significant `ramping up' of formal police powers and\n(administrative) regulatory options, which provided the authorities with\nmore diverse methods and sanctions aimed at regulating the (mis)conduct of\nindividuals but also the `risky' operational practices of businesses profiting\nfrom the sale of alcohol (both at on and off-licensed premises), for example,\nthe selling of alcohol to underage drinkers or those already drunk. Hence\nthe regulatory drive was aimed at those on both the demand-side and the\nsupply-side of the market in alcohol sales, with the latter being held\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 9(4)\nculpable for the often intoxicated and sometimes disorderly behaviour of\nthe former.\nTable 1 variously categorizes the main interventions into one of three\nforms: those focusing on specific persons, specific places (the subject of which\nmay be individuals or groups occupying particular locations, or businesses\noperating within such locations), or individual licensed venues. Many of\nthe powers are notable for their risk-based preventative logic that functions\nthrough processes of surveillance, identification, categorization, and ex-\nclusion. For example, the (licensing) powers to close premises temporarily\nin order to tackle disorder can be both reactive and anticipatory. Further\ncivil injunctions are, of course, available to local authorities in relation to\nnoise nuisance. Whilst these powers overlap, to some degree, with those\nintended to address alcohol-related disorder, they remain beyond the scope\nof this article.\nResearch design\nIn exploring the implications of the powers within this list, this article draws\non the findings of a two-year research project which combined an intensive\ntwin-site case study with broader explorations of the national dimensions\nof alcohol policy formulation and delivery. Local contexts and actions\nwere explored in a 715,000 population city in the North East of England\nand a geographically dispersed, 335,000 population, metropolitan district\ncomprising several small to medium sized towns, in the North West of\nEngland. Fifty in-depth interviews were conducted in these sites (25 in each)\nparticipating in a focus group at the latter location. The locations were\nselected in order to compare different local contexts and to explore elements\nof their specificities or convergences of approach in response to central\ngovernment dicta. Interviewees were selected purposively to encompass\nrepresentatives of all the major and more minor regulatory players: Crime\nand Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs), police, council licensing\ndepartments, social services, health and treatment services (statutory and\nvoluntary), education and young peoples' services, government regional\noffices, Chambers of Commerce, drinks retailers, residents' groups and\nvoluntary sector associations.\nTo encompass the national policy arena and its interplays with the local,\na further 20 interviews were conducted with prominent figures in central\nand local government, the police, health care, the legal system, the drinks\nand leisure industries, and a range of professional and non-government\norganizations, including charities and pressure groups. Interviews were\nsemi-structured around established and emergent themes and sought to\nexplore the views of those who shape various facets of national alcohol\npolicy and its interconnections with local policy development and delivery.\nA range of stakeholders in the research sites and nationally were asked to\nHadfield et al.--Policing and regulating the night-time economy 469\nTable 1.

Some\nof the views expressed related to powers already implemented, while other,\nyet-to-be introduced measures, were judged in prospect.\nA new era of nightlife governance\nThe various new or enhanced powers shown in Table 1--all introduced\nsince 1998--have intensified but also re-orientated the nature of state\ncontrol within the NTE, drawing together webs of actors as regulator\nand regulated deploying different levers of control and compliance. Until\nNew Labour's first term of office in 1997, long-established governmental\nstructures and responses prevailed in which police, licensing magistrates,\nlocal authorities, and leisure businesses played distinct and largely non-\nintegrated roles. Public policing methods were predominately characterized\nby the `fire brigade' model of reactive vehicle-based response and the\n`swarming' of crime scenes (Hobbs et al., 2003), while licensing operated\nas a largely distinct administrative technology for regulating alcohol sales\n(through the magistracy) and public entertainment in the form of `music\nand dancing' (through local authorities). The Licensing Act 2003 served to\nintertwine these governmental fields, bringing both activities into the remit\nof a single licensing instrument (the Premises Licence) and single jurisdiction\n(the local authority licensing committee). Urban security governance thus\nbecame explicitly linked to control over the availability of alcohol and its\nconditions of sale, and to a tacit censorial role in the regulation of associated\ncultural activities (Hadfield and Measham, 2009).\nAs local authorities also hold jurisdiction over land use planning for leisure\nvenues they are, in principle, able to control the NTE in both form and content\n(trading hours, physical design and capacity, managerial methods, licensable\nactivities, spatial distribution). Yet the various mechanisms of procedural\njustice, de-regulatory checks and balances, appeal and precedent built into\nthe planning and licensing systems significantly restrain local government\naction, establishing more equitable power relations between regulator and\nrather than local authorities, have arguably gained the greater leverage\nover the governance of the night in recent years. The Licensing Act 2003\nallocated police a key role as `responsible authorities' within the licensing\nprocess, with the power to make `representations' to the licensing committee\nregarding licence applications, to instigate reviews, and propose mandatory\nconditions. It is an oft-overlooked fact that in the absence of representations\nfrom responsible authorities or interested parties licensing committees are\nnot at liberty to deny new Premise Licence or licence variation applications.\nThus Cumulative Impact Policies, for example, become operable only upon\nreceipt of such representations, with responsible authorities (primarily\npolice) also prominent in providing much of the evidential bases (local crime\nand public nuisance data) for their initial development.\nHadfield et al.--Policing and regulating the night-time economy 471\nControlling space/controlling persons\nThe recent growth of highly discretionary police powers was widely\nwelcomed by practitioners concerned with securing order and safety in\nthe NTE. While these powers were seen to provide the police with greater\noptions and flexibility when asserting authority among night-time denizens,\ntheir use appears to be inconsistent owing to concerns over implementation\ndifficulties, but also the extent to which they address in any meaningful\nway the nature of the problematic behaviour. A case in point were Penalty\nNotices for Disorder (PNDs), which can be issued for a variety of offences\nthat may arise in nightlife areas, from being disorderly whilst drunk in a\nhighway, other public place, or licensed premises, to buying or attempting\nto buy alcohol for consumption by a person under 18 in licensed premises,\nor urinating in a public place. Although known as `on-the-spot-fines' and\ndesigned inter alia to reduce police bureaucracy by enabling the police to\nissue a swift, summary punishment (see Young, 2008), they were regarded\nby police at one of our sites as strictly a case disposal option for the custody\nsuite following arrest, and often only after the `offender' had spent a night\nin the cells to sober up. This approach was adopted in light of official\nguidance issued to the police that suggested initial aspirations for rapid,\nstreet-based disposal may be unworkable as `a penalty notice will not be\nappropriate where the suspect is unable to understand what is being offered\nto them, for example ... where the suspect is drunk or under the influence of\nOrder and `drunk and disorderly' offences account for 60 per cent of all\nPNDs (Ministry of Justice, 2008), their use in the NTE is at least partially\nconstrained by other concurrent demands on the custody suite as well as\nstreet policing, more broadly.\nSpatially-focused, person-directed approaches raised similar concerns,\nspecifically surrounding the intoxication and hence mental incapacity/\nvulnerability of the target groups. For example, what might happen to a\ndrunken person if they were ordered by the police to leave an area and\npossibly their friends? Likewise, as Crawford and Lister (2007) discuss\nin relation to dispersal orders, there were also concerns that place-based\npowers may merely displace disorder, particularly owing to the recidivist\nnature of many `problem drinkers':\nyou can confiscate alcohol from people all day long, but if you don't address\nthe issues around that, then you're just gonna be doing it every day...unless\nyou actually try and look at ways of preventing them re-offending, you're not\ngonna solve your problem. (Police Sergeant)\nConcerns over the failure of such interventions to address the underlying\ncauses of alcohol-related crime and disorder were aggravated by a lack of\ndata sharing associated with discretionary and summary disposals, which\nprevented offenders' details from being matched against those held by\npartner agencies. This constraint was regarded as unhelpful in preventing\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 9(4)\nthe identification of patterns of offending, the engagement of alcohol arrest\nreferral schemes and other support and treatment services.\nInterestingly and perhaps--as will become apparent later--significantly,\nDrinking Banning Orders (DBOs) were more positively received. Our\ninterviewees regarded them as an important aid in supporting the civil powers\nof exclusion invested in licensees who are more directly and proximately\nresponsible for governance within the publicly accessible, but privately\nowned spaces of pubs, bars and nightclubs. Partnership mechanisms such as\nthe local trade-led `Pubwatch' forums--in which licensees and police share\ninformationandcooperateincrimepreventioninitiatives--wereinstrumental\nin this respect. Acting as `knowledge brokers' (Ericson and Haggerty, 1997),\npolice circulated photographs of known offenders to all Pubwatch members\nwhich were then recorded in albums and displayed on montages behind the\nbar. Registered under the Data Protection Act, Pubwatch members were also\nable to generate their own intelligence for distribution among their network\nand with the police. In one area, the local Pubwatch had authorized the\npolice to issue a banning order which excluded alcohol-related offenders\nfrom all their members' licensed premises. Although secondary to formal\npenalties, the imposition of this extra-legal sanction was reported to have\nhad a strong deterrent effect in that the resultant deprivations spoke directly\nto the focal concerns of offenders, thwarting their ability to inhabit those\nsocial milieux from which the seductions of violence first emanated (Winlow\nThey're [the banning orders] effective...because people are starting to say,\nnot, `how much am I gonna be fined, how long am I going to prison?' It's\n`am I going to be banned from the pub?' And there's more of an issue over\nnot being able to get the drink down your local than there is about the other\nconsequences ... It has a big social impact on those individuals that it affects.\n(Police Sergeant)\nControlling space/steering commerce\nWhile the effectiveness of banning orders and the Pubwatch schemes that\nsupport them relies upon voluntary co-operation and co-dependency with\nthe licensed trade, premises-directed powers represent clear attempts by the\nstate to `govern at a distance' by `responsibilizing' licence holders for the\ncontrol of crime and disorder in, and increasingly around (e.g. any pave-\nment, beer garden and smoking area) their venues (see Department for\nCulture Media and Sport, 2007: para. 1.26). Police and licensing authorities\nexpect that licencees and their staff should be held responsible not only for\nthe `responsible' sale of alcohol, but also for complying with many other\nstatutory requirements and regulations (such as specific sets of licensing\nconditions) relating to the running of their premises, which may cover a\nmyriad of issues, including substantial emphases on `security' and `good\nneighbourliness'. Much of the police and trading standards enforcement\nHadfield et al.--Policing and regulating the night-time economy 473\nactivity that has taken place in recent years has sought to underline such\nexpectations, wherein complying with imposed licensing conditions is seen\nas a means of minimizing the risks of disorder. The levers of compliance\nhere are largely instrumental. Sanctions for non-compliance threaten the\ncommercial viability of licensed premises, whether in the form of fines, or\nthe financial costs borne from being required by licensing authorities to\nintroduce (costly) crime prevention technologies, changes to profitable and\nestablished operating practices, or ultimately to close down (temporarily or\notherwise) a venue.\nEnforcement activity in respect of breaches of statutory requirements and\nlicensing conditions is a matter for council officers, both from licensing and\nenvironmental departments. These officers are in regular contact with each\nother and with police and sometimes make `multi-agency' inspection visits\nto premises in order, as one council licensing officer put it, `to advise and\ninform licence holders what their responsibilities are'. In both areas, data\nwithin and between agencies was collated, risks evaluated and premises\ncategorized in the form of a `problem premises register'. Premises raising\nconcerns across a spectrum of community safety issues, from high levels\nof drunkenness and violence, to noise escape, glass injuries, and customers\nslipping over on wet floors which had not been properly cleaned, were\nclassified as `poorly operated'. In accordance with the principles of effective\nenforcement described in the Hampton Report (2005), once graded into\ncategories of risk, those premises identified as `underperforming' (i.e. as\npresenting a high risk of hosting crime and disorder) were then selected for\nfurther proactive surveillance, inspection and enforcement operations.\nOur findings suggest that regulators are more inclined to gently steer\nbusinesses towards compliance with licensing conditions than threaten\nthem directly, or proceed with coercive action. There was much evidence of\nrestraint and even reticence in applying the range of powers and sanctions at\ntheir disposal. For example, the number of PNDs issued for selling alcohol\n(Ministry of Justice, 2008), despite the Home Office placing this offence\nto the fore within its Responsible Alcohol Sales Campaign of 2007 (Slade,\n2007). Tellingly, within one of our sites, Pubwatch members were, in many\ninstances, warned of the timing of such blanket enforcement operations as\na `reward' for their cooperation in other matters. This conciliatory position\nwas explained in terms of the fear of driving a wedge between interlocutors\nwho had little choice but to work together, often on long-term bases.\nThus, the real utility of premises-directed powers was to provide regulators\nwith a position of strength from which to enter a process of dialogue with\nlicensees and thereby negotiate graduated outcomes in the shadow of the\nsurround the drafting of non-contractual `memoranda of agreement'\nbetween the police and licensees concerning a suite of preventative security\nmeasures to be adopted. Review proceedings were regarded as a breakdown\nin the usual functioning of these informal, compliance-based mechanisms,\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 9(4)\noccurring only where licensed operators were judged recalcitrant, recidivist\n(incapable of resolving serious and recurrent problems), or more rarely,\nopenly defiant of police authority. As one police licensing officer explained,\nthe introduction of a sliding scale of regulation was regarded as having\npermitted the authorities greater leverage over the actions of operators:\nThe Review process is really really good. Now before I used to have licensed\npremises taking the mick. The only thing I could do if they didn't respond to\npartnership activity was go down the revocation route, which was like the\nnuclear option. And of course, they would fight [it] because this was their\nbusiness. Well under the Review process, we can call them in, have their\nlicence looked at, and potentially just add conditions rather than completely\nclose them down ... It's a far more measured approach.\nThe previous licensing system, under the Licensing Act 1964, therefore, is\npresented as one in which licensing justices were understandably reluctant\nto countenance the imposition of a loss of livelihood upon licensees, save\nin the gravest of circumstances. This lack of flexibility had the effect of\nrestricting enforcement options, allowing low-level miscreants to operate\nwith relative impunity, as recalled by the same licensing officer: `I remember\nthe frustration of it. All we ever really used to do was put an entry in the\nlicensing register ... nothing ever seemed to change'. The threat of Review\nnow acts as a key determinate in achieving compliance:\nObviously they're scared to death, the licensed trade doesn't want to go to\nReview and neither do we, this is the thing, neither do we. But we will if we\nhave to ... And every now and again, there are serious incidents that we have\nto just go straight for the stick. But we won't do so out of choice. (Police\nInspector)\nIt is now possible, many felt, to improve operating standards in `problem'\npremises without undertaking the detailed case work involved in Review and\nthe protracted legal and quasi-legal wrangling elicited by any subsequent\nengagement with the appeal process. Chinks in the armour of enforcement\ncontinued to exist and it was typically through the trade's engagement of\nspecialist licensing lawyers that these might be exposed. The simple action\nof requesting an appeal against the licensing authority's decision often\nfrustrated police intentions, leading as it typically did to significant periods\nof delay (up to two years) awaiting a hearing date in the Magistrates' Court.\nDuring such time, the appellants remained free to trade `as usual' without\nhaving to comply with the licensing authority's judgments.\nThe Guidance to the 2003 Act makes it clear that, `Licensing authorities\nshould only impose conditions which are necessary and proportionate for the\npromotion for the licensing objectives' (Department of Culture Media and\nremains a grey area, but one which can raise the stakes, making appeals\nmore likely. For example, in granting a licence variation to permit trading\nafter midnight, a condition might be imposed that the premises employ at\nHadfield et al.--Policing and regulating the night-time economy 475\nleast three door supervisors during this time period. This additional cost\nmight outweigh the commercial value of the extended trading period, thus\nresulting in the business choosing not to use the hours it had obtained.\nThere were also concerns from residents' representatives that the Review\nand appeals processes, lauded by government as major contributors to local\ndemocracy, still discouraged participation by members of the public due to\nlapses in the system of notification and the need to present oral evidence\nbefore a council chamber, or court of law, which many people found inti-\nmidating (Hadfield, 2006). Moreover, there were concerns that public sector\nprofessionals were often dismissive of residential complaints, especially\nif this threatened established understandings, or working relationships\nwith the trade. Licensees seen to be cooperating with regulators through\nPubwatch, for example, were suspected as having significant bargaining\npower over the treatment they received from licensing authorities, while\nthere was no guarantee that residents could call upon police to support their\nrepresentations, for example, against a Pubwatch member's application\nto extend the hours of his or her licence. More broadly, our focus group\nwith residents revealed deep-seated concerns over the extent to which their\nviews on local licensing issues were taken into account by the authorities,\nparticularly the police. Despite possessing formal statutory rights as\n`interested parties', residents expressed frustration over the ways in which\nthe informal instrumental relationships and bureaucratic imperatives which\ncharacterized local governance over the night tended to thwart opportunities\nfor community mobilization.\nStrategic governance of the night-time city\nStrategic area-based approaches are intended to ensure that while\nresponses to alcohol-related crime and disorder may be strong in dealing\nwith events, they do not remain weak in dealing with processes. Under\nthe Guidance to the 2003 Act `cumulative impact' refers to the effects of\na significant number of licensed premises concentrated in one area where\nthere is evidence that the environmental impacts of all these premises, taken\ntogether, is undermining the licensing objectives. In zones designated for\nCumulative Impact Policies (CIPs), the burden of proof for new Premises\nLicence or licence variation applications is reversed and applicants must\naddress the licensing authorities' concerns in their proposed Operating\nSchedules. More specifically, the applicant must show that the proposed\noperation is in some way `exceptional' and will not therefore add to the\nproblems which necessitated the policy. Given that this tier of regulation\nserved to establish a barrier to market entry for new businesses, existing\nlicensees in the designated zones were, it was widely suggested, content\nfor CIPs to remain unchallenged. Local authorities, however, were coming\nunder political pressure from residents to create new CIPs, or to extend\nthe spatial and temporal reach of existing ones. These demands were not\ntypically viewed by CDRP practitioners as local democracy in action, but\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 9(4)\nrather as unwelcome and unwarranted external pressure which threatened\nto disrupt carefully constructed strategies, alliances and ways of working.\nThe following quotation is illustrative:\nMy battle at the moment is with people who want the CIPs extended ...\nStrangely enough, I get no pressure from the trade to drop them and I think\nthat's because, although their lawyers want the business, the trade are\nquite happy with the hours they've got. I mean, it's also interesting that it's\nimproved the value of their licences. (Council licensing officer)\nProfessional reticence concerning `untutored' lay demands for CIPs emerged\npartly in response to the need for robust and legally defensive policies that,\nin accord, required painstaking development both of their wording and the\nevidential bases (containing quantitative and qualitative data) underpinning\nthem. Moreover, there needed to be strong political will to maintain the\nlegal momentum required to defend them:\nwhen it goes to appeal, the magistrates find themselves saying `well the\nresidents want 11 o'clock and the stress area policy says 11 o'clock, but the\napplicants are saying one o'clock, so we'll give them midnight as a sort of\ncompromise'. In one city, I'm talking with a council that doesn't even act if\na representation comes in support of its own stress area policy. So it's [the\nCIP] hardly worth the paper it's written on. (National civic amenity group\nactivist)\nSome CIPs were worded in such a way as to discourage applications only\nfrom certain `types' of licensed premises that are commonly associated\nwith greater risk of disorder, such as the `high volume vertical drinking\nestablishment'. As understandings of what might constitute such premises\nremain ill-defined, the city's CIP could easily be sidestepped:\nIf they come up with all the crime prevention measures I want, I don't object\nto them. So you haven't effectively stopped these areas from getting new\npremises ... I think if it comes to it, they'll remove the furniture and they'll\npack people in. Then, if they start to cause us problems we'll take them to\nReview. But once they've got the Premises Licence, it's too late effectively ...\nthe cumulative impact thing is by the by. (Police licensing officer)\nThe above reflections illustrate the challenge regulators face in attempting to\naddress issues of `criminogenic process' through legal mechanisms designed\nto preserve individual rights, such that each application must be judged on\nmerit.\nWhile CIPs were generally regarded as a useful tool for what one council\nofficer described as `freezing the situation'; that is, preventing further\nenvironmental degradation, other mechanisms were seen as more suitable\nfor reducing existing problems. ADZs provide a further strategic tool for\ngoverning nightlife settings, like CIPs, being based upon the view that it\nHadfield et al.--Policing and regulating the night-time economy 477\nis not always possible to identify a clear relationship between crime and\ndisorder occurring in the public realm and specific licensed premises, as\noffenders may have visited several premises in the course of an evening.\nADZs aim to generate `improvements' on an area-wide basis through the\nplacing of a mandatory levy on licensed operators for the costs of CDRP-\ninitiated crime control measures; levies are to be calculated individually for\neach premise within the designated zone in accordance with their rateable\nvalue and hours of operation.\nAlthough operational in law for almost a year, no area has so far (as\nof June 2009) seen fit to impose an ADZ. This may be due, in part, to the\naccompanying guidance (Home Office, 2008) which frames the creation of\nan ADZ as an action of `last resort' to be used only where other remedies\nhave failed. It may also have to do with the instrumental fear of robust legal\nchallenge from the national bar chains. Accordingly, in our research sites,\nADZs were discussed with limited enthusiasm by interviewees from all sides\nof the alcohol policy debate. Much of this reluctance stemmed from the\nexpressive qualities of the policy, specifically the assumed symbolic power\nof the label to define an area in terms of its high crime rate. Identifying\na drinking circuit, or an entire town centre, as a hot-spot for disorder\nwas thought to convey clear messages about the nature of risk and social\nrelations within such places. This, it was feared, might deter `law-abiding'\npeople from visiting the area who may otherwise have contributed to\nenhanced levels of informal social control--an assumption supported by\nresearch concerning the socially mediated perceptual bases of ecological\nclassifications and spatial difference (Sampson, 2009). While making the\narea less attractive to the legitimate visitor, it was thought likely to have the\nfurther effect of drawing in a disreputable contingent intent on adding to the\narea's existing problems.\nBefore initiating an ADZ, Home Office guidance encourages CDRPs to\nworkwithlicenseesindraftinganarea-wide`actionplan'whichmightinvolve\nasking for voluntary financial contributions towards initiatives such as taxi\nmarshals and patrols by uniformed council `street ambassadors'. However,\nif the broader governmental objective is to lever resources from the private\nsector to fund additional services (policing or otherwise) within nightlife\nareas then their emergence seems likely to be usurped by the introduction\nof Business Improvement Districts (BIDs). The Local Government Act 2003\nand the Business Improvement Districts (England) Regulations 2004 permit\nthe development of private sector-led partnership initiatives in the form of\nBIDs, which are financed by a levy upon businesses and aspire to create\na `safer trading environment'. BIDs differ from ADZs in that it is the fee\npayers, rather than the regulatory authorities, who establish and control\nthe initiative. In November 2007, Nottingham city centre became the first\narea in the UK to create a BID scheme committed solely to the needs and\npriorities of the night-time economy.\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 9(4)\nDiscussion\nIt was clear from our interviews that premises-directed regulatory and\nenforcement activity was regarded as an interactive process in which the\nauthorities entered into negotiation with the regulated and with interested\nparties. Powers--and especially, strategic area-directed powers--were used\nsparingly, their main utility being as levers or incentives for change, which\nencouraged compliance even if rarely directly applied with force (Braithwaite,\n2002). Notions of the `attitude test' in relation to the application of coercive\npowers were as pertinent here as in classic portrayals of the street policing\nencounter (Van Maanen, 1978). In dealing with licensed premises, especially\nthe national chains, CDRPs thus applied a form of `smart power', involving\na judicious combination of hard (coercive) and soft (co-optive) elements\nInterviewees within CDRPs referred to the communicative properties of\n`tough laws' and `clampdowns' in demonstrating to the public that `some-\nthing was being done', yet were skeptical of centrally-driven enforcement\ncampaigns due to the time-limited nature of the prioritization and additional\nresources. Several interviewees referred to parental ambivalence over\nalcohol, for instance, parents sending mixed-messages around their own\ndrinking practices and the expectations they placed upon their children.\nPractitioners were conscious of their incapacity to deal with the issue of\nalcohol's availability within the home and of the need to work with parents\nto discourage the purchase of drinks for their children. One informant\nreferred to the development of local action to formalize such interventions\nthrough the use of Parenting Contracts, or Parenting Orders.\nIn relation to individual offenders--primarily, the disorderly `binge\ndrinker'--the inability of punitive, generalized and spatially-oriented anti-\nsocial behaviour powers to nurture pro-social protective behaviours emerged\nas a major theme. The chronic necessity for police to focus on crowd\ncontrol, public order maintenance and visible reassurance in nightlife zones\nat peak times resulted in limited capacities for arrest and routine proactive\nvisits to licensed premises. Thus, notions of effectiveness were linked to\nthe degree to which enforcement actions could be sustained and combined\nwith other forms of targeted action in the long-term. Recent Home Office-\ninstigated `crackdowns' utilizing such powers were widely seen as `sticking\nplaster' approaches (Crawford and Lister, 2007), most effective in tending\nthe symptoms of a distempered social order, but ill-equipped to promote\nits systemic recovery. Our interviewees saw aspects of youth culture and\nwider societal attitudes to alcohol as providing positive endorsement for\nhedonistic, sometimes aggressive, drunken comportment; thus presenting\nstubborn root causes. Images of `urban grit' (Talbot, 2007), the spectacle of\nto stoke the fires of the NTE's perennial appeal. These euphoric, almost\ncelebratory elements of youthful nightlife culture are perfectly captured in\nthe lyrical street poetry of Sheffield rock band, The Arctic Monkeys. Noting\nHadfield et al.--Policing and regulating the night-time economy 479\nthe desired and recreational elements of violence in which some of the\nnight's denizens `secretly ... want it all to kick off, they want arms flying\neverywhere and bottles as well' the band (in their late-teens at the time the\nsong was written) highlight a crucial dichotomy in the framing of social\ninteraction that is typical of everyday distinctions between night and day:\n`This town's a different town today. This town's a different town to what it\nwas last night. You couldn't have done that on a Sunday' (The Ritz to the\nRubble).\nThe ambiguous and hyper-vigilant (in some cases, arguably hypocritical)\npublic and political sensibilities around alcohol being as they are, one\nproblem faced by regulatory authorities was that of trying to reduce\nalcohol-related harms associated with the NTE without being drawn into\nthe stigmatizing rhetoric within which much debate about young peoples'\ndrinking was framed. Tensions were heightened in local communities as a\nresult of the normative aspects of the alcohol policy agenda and the clash of\nlifestyle, values and meaning attribution which constituted the contestation\nof urban space. The following views, expressed within our local residents'\nfocus group, are illustrative of such tensions:\nThey don't think that people are sleeping, they don't care that people are\nsleeping, and nobody is controlling that particular bit of garden. So they\nthink, `hey, we're free, we can do what we like'. And they do because they're\nyoung people who are drunk.\nWorking with the licensed trade to limit `irresponsible' supply was therefore\nregarded as necessary, but not sufficient. Some powers such as the ASBO\nwere distinct in their emphasis on future conduct and an expansion in the use\nof contract and conditionality. Consumers could be taught `care of the self'\n(Foucault, 1986) through health risk-focused and social norms education,\nthus stemming their demand for alcohol. Yet, summary disposals such as\nthe PND provided little scope for engagement with the welfarist/disciplinary\naspects of the criminal justice system, wherein `conditional cautioning' and\n`alcohol arrest referral' schemes acted as gateways into treatment services\ndesigned to help people `straighten out their lives'. Some respondents\ncautioned, however, that anti-social behaviour powers and premises-focused\naction must remain to the fore in providing rapid response to the distinct\npressures that arose in locations where visitor numbers vastly outstripped\nthose of the residential population toward which any longer term educative\napproaches might be directed.\nDifferent social groups had varying capacities for choice and negotiation\nof the sometimes complex relations of inclusion and exclusion that operated\nhad both formal and informal constituents, the former notably including\nthe work of door staff and the expansion of surveillance technologies such\nas Identity Scanners at venue entrances, whilst the former related to the\nwidely divergent identities, lifestyles and socio-economic status of co-present\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 9(4)\nindividuals and groups (Hadfield and Measham, 2009a). Thus, problems of\norder in night-time public spaces were generated, in part, by the fact that\nnot all of those attracted by the `bright lights' of the city found a welcome\nfrom licensed premises, not all of those welcomed by licensed premises\nfound a welcome from the police or local residents, while relations between\ndifferent groups of visitors could themselves be fraught or antagonistic.\nPlace-based powers sought to respond to such governmental challenges as\nkey components of a new `toolkit' of urban control which favoured pre-\nemptive action, socio-spatial demarcation, and the embedding of proscribed\nconsumption patterns and behavioural norms (Crawford, in press). This was\nnot, however, simply the latest instalment of efforts to control the socially\nexcluded `dangerous classes'. Temporality mattered, not only in relation\nto the unruly life of night but as a result of its political economy: drunken\ncomportment was fuelled by the bonus and giro cheque alike, both provid-\ning the lifeblood of an important and established leisure economy.\nIn highlighting the attempt to remove disorder from key day-time citadels\nof consumption (notably, the shopping centre) liberal urbanist scholars have\nfailed to account for the increasing centrality of such night-time consumer\nlocales. Here one sees a gulf between the cultural norms of the night-time\nhigh street's core constituency (and thus, the `included', as well as the `the\nexcluded') and those of control agents. Any notions of the purification of\nurban public space and police potency in relation to such settings, should, we\nargue, be regarded as mythical. To assume that powers are applied and laws\nenforced, simply because they exist, is to grossly oversimplify the field of\nurban security governance. Empirical investigation reveals such governance\nto be characterized by subtle organizational and interpersonal power-plays\nwhich result directly, in the case of the NTE, from the contested nature\nof the field (Dennis and Martin, 2005). The state and its local `statutory\nauthorities' do not hold all the cards in the regulatory game, nor could\nthey ever hope to do so given the social and economic complexities of the\ncontemporary nightscape.\nNotwithstanding the above, current levels of public, media, and political\nconcern about alcohol continue to create a highly sensitized policy arena in\nwhich new powers are allocated to local statutory partnerships such that\nthey may mould nightlife as never before. Controls are applied differentially,\nnot only across areas, but also according to types of venue and social scene,\nas variously manifested in substance use preferences, consumer behaviours/\nexpectations, and commercial business models (Graham and Homel, 2009;\npromoting and facilitating certain forms of leisure/cultural activity, while\nat the same time adjusting, restraining or banishing others. Examples of\nthe latter include the City of Westminster's `lighter touch' approach to\nthe licensing of restaurants, while the former is exemplified by Devon and\nCornwall Constabulary's use of s.160 Closure Orders to prevent the hosting\nof outdoor music festivals.\nHadfield et al.--Policing and regulating the night-time economy 481\nDevelopments on the horizon include the Policing and Crime Bill 2009\n(currently in Lord's Committee Stage) which proposes the introduction of\na set of national `mandatory licensing conditions' for licensed premises and\n`discretionary local licensing conditions' that can be applied to groups of\ntwo or more premises in any given area (Home Office, 2009). The Bill also\nseeks to amend police powers to deal with young people drinking alcohol\nin public. If passed, it will create a new offence of `persistently possessing\nalcohol in a public place'. Young people under 18 can be prosecuted for this\noffence if they are caught with alcohol in a public place three times within a\n12 month period. The maximum punishment for this will be a level-two fine\n(currently \u00a3500). In addition, the Bill proposes that lap-dancing venues--\nrarely associated with disorder--are to be legally re-classified (subject to\nlicensing authority designation), bringing them under the remit of the more\nstringent laws governing Sex Encounter Establishments (Hadfield and\nConcerns arise in relation to ways in which the skewing of crime policy\ntowards the most visible manifestations of Britain's `alcohol problem' may\nbe permitting a more general expansion of control over the actions of those\nwho occupy the public realm across a range of social settings and contexts.\nAs in other areas of anti-social behaviour policy, the heaviest price in terms\nof criminalization is exacted upon those who have the least ability to resist\nthe label: young people who procure public spaces for informal assembly,\ndrinking and socializing and are ripe for repression in this respect, in Britain,\nCrawford (2007) notes, regulation is much more likely to prove `responsive'\nto the needs and wishes of the regulated in the case of big business, much\nless so when dealing with individuals. Yet, outcomes vary. Despite central\ngovernment attempts to steer and standardize their use, anti-social behaviour\npowers and their accompanying guidance are filtered and reinterpreted by\nlocal criminal justice practitioners and administrative bodies for whom there\nhave been significant consequences in terms of resources, capacity building\nand professional skills development. Responses to crime and disorder are\nthus multi-faceted, diffuse, and differentiated, often involving significant\ndegrees of locally-directed responsibilization and third-party enrolment\nThe joys and ills of contemporary nightlife raise key questions about the\nconditions necessary to achieve civil and diverse urban spaces; put differ-\nently, where are we to find the `social' in the debate on anti-social behaviour\nin our towns and cities after dark when it proves so difficult to even achieve\nthe co-presence of different generations and communities? Have the optim-\nistic visions of a more convivial NTE so characteristic of public debate a\ndecade hence now evaporated into grim cynicism concerning a nation's\nproblematic relationship with alcohol? The post-2003 Licensing Act context\nis a complex one in which the art of urban security governance involves\nattempts to balance the seductions of the market, consumer freedoms and\ncivil liberties, with surveillance, securitization and repression. Whilst the\nCriminology & Criminal Justice 9(4)\nrelative power of the various stakeholders may ebb and flow, it seems likely\nto remain ever thus.\n"
