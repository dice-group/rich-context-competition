The speed of dietary and activity pattern shifts is great,\nparticularly in the developing world, resulting in major shifts in obesity on a worldwide basis. Data limitations force us to\nexamine data on obesity trends in adults to provide a broader sense of changes in obesity over time, and then to examine the\nrelatively fewer studies on youth. Specifically, this work provides a sense of change both in the United States, Europe, and the\nlower- and middle-income countries of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.\nCONCLUSION: The paper shows that changes are occurring at great speed and at earlier stages of the economic and social\ndevelopment of each country. The burden of obesity is shifting towards the poor.\nKeywords: youth obesity; nutrition transition; obesity trend\nIntroduction\nOver the past 15 y, there has been increasing evidence that\nthe structure of dietary intakes and the prevalence of obesity\naround the developing world have been changing at an\nincreasingly rapid pace.1 In many ways, these shifts are a\ncontinuation of large-scale changes that have occurred\nrepeatedly over time; however, we will assert and show that\nthe changes facing low- and moderate-income countries\nappear to be very rapid. While initially these shifts were felt\nto be limited to higher-income urban populations, it is\nincreasingly clear that these are much broader trends\naffecting all segments of society.\nTwo historic processes of change occur simultaneously\nwith, or precede, the `nutrition transition'. One is the\ndemographic transitionFthe shift from a pattern of high\nfertility and mortality to one of low fertility and mortality\n(typical of modern industrialized countries). The second is\nthe epidemiological transition, first described by Omran:2\nthe shift from a pattern of high prevalence of infectious\ndiseaseFassociated with malnutrition, periodic famine, and\npoor environmental sanitationFto one of high prevalence\nof chronic and degenerative diseaseFassociated with urban\u00ad\nindustrial lifestyles.3\nThe nutrition transition is closely related to the demo-\ngraphic and epidemiologic transitions. Large shifts have\noccurred in diet and in physical activity patterns, particularly\nin the last one or two decades of the 20th century. Modern\nsocieties seem to be converging on a diet high in saturated\nfats, sugar, and refined foods but low in fiberFoften termed\nthe `Western diet'Fand on lifestyles characterized by lower\nlevels of activity. These changes are reflected in nutritional\noutcomes, such as changes in average stature, body composi-\ntion, and morbidity.\n*Correspondence: Professor BM Popkin, Carolina Population Center, CB\n&hash; 8120 University Square, University of North Carolina at Chapel\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nThe last three stages of the nutrition transition are\ndescribed in more detail in Figure 1. In Stage 3, famine\nbegins to recede as income rises. In Stage 4, changes in diet\nand activity pattern lead to the emergence of new disease\nproblems and increased disability. In Stage 5, behavioral\nchange begins to reverse the negative tendencies and make\npossible a process of `successful aging'.4,5 The changes are all\ndriven by a range of factors, including urbanization,\neconomic growth, technical change, and culture. For con-\nvenience, the patterns can be thought of as historical\ndevelopments; however, `earlier' patterns are not restricted\nto the periods in which they first arose, but continue to\ncharacterize certain geographic and socioeconomic (SES)\nsubpopulations. Elsewhere we have laid out the full set of\nnutrition transition stages in more detail.6,7\nOn a global basis, there are several themes related to\nobesity that we will summarize. The first is the general shift\ntoward obesity that represents a global problem rather than\none centered in a few high-income countries. The second is\nthe rapid increase in obesity found in lower- and middle-\nincome developing countriesFa rate of change that appears\nto be greater than that found in higher-income countries.\nThe third is the shift in the burden of obesity toward the\npoor on a worldwide basis. We present the limited compar-\nable data on trends in adolescent obesity across the globe,\nwith specific attention to the link between obesity and\neconomic and social development.\nDietary changes around the world are rapid!\nThe diets of the developing world are shifting rapidly,\nparticularly with respect to fat, caloric sweeteners, and\nanimal source foods (ASF).1,8\nEdible oil\nElsewhere we have provided evidence of the rapid increases\nin edible oil at the national and household level throughout\nthe developing world. In many developing countries,\ndietary change has begun with major increases in\ndomestic production and imports of oilseeds and vegetable\noilsFrather than animal source products or caloric sweet-\nproduction of vegetable fats and oils rose from 60 to 71\nmillion metric tons.9 In contrast, the production of visible\nanimal fats (butter and tallow) has remained steady at\napproximately 12 million metric tons. Principal vegetable\noils include soybean, sunflower, rapeseed, palm, and ground-\nnut oil. With the exception of groundnut oil, global\navailability of each has approximately tripled between 1961\nand 1990. While the broader macroeconomic shifts that\naffected this increase in edible vegetable fat intakeFnamely,\nedible vegetable fat prices, supply, and consumptionFis\nunique because it affected rich and poor countries equally,\nthe net impact is relatively much greater on low-income\nCaloric sweeteners\nSugar is the world's predominant sweetener. It is not\nclear exactly when sugar became the world's principal\nsweetenerFmost likely in the 17th or 18th centuryFas\nthe New World began producing large quantities of sugar\nat reduced prices.12,13 We use the term caloric sweetener\ninstead of added sugar, as there is such a range of nonsugar\nproducts used today. High-fructose corn syrup is a\nprime example, as it is the sweetener used in all US soft\ndrinks. The name `sweeteners' includes products used for\nUrbanization, economic growth, technological changes for work, leisure,\n& food processing, mass media growth\nReceding Famine\nSlow mortality decline\n\u00b7 increased fat, sugar,\nprocessed foods\n\u00b7 shift in technology of\nwork and leisure\nDegenerative Disease\nAccelerated life expectancy,\nshift to increased DR-NCD,\nincreased disability period\n\u00b7 reduced fat, increased\nfruit, veg,CHO,fiber\n\u00b7 replace sedentarianism\nwith purposeful changes\nin recreation, other activity\nBehavioral Change\nExtended health aging,\nreduced DR-NCD\nMCH deficiencies,\nweaning disease,\nstunting\n\u00b7 starchy, low variety,\nlow fat,high fiber\n\u00b7 labor-intensive\nwork/leisure\nobesity emerges,\nbone density problems\nreduced body fatness,\nimproved bone health\nFigure 1 Stages of the nutrition transition.\nWorldwide obesity dynamics and their determinants\nBM Popkin and P Gordon-Larsen\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nsweetening derived either from sugar crops, cereals, fruits,\nmilk, or produced by insects. This category includes a wide\nvariety of monosaccharides (glucose and fructose) and\ndisaccharides (sucrose and saccharose), which exist either\nin a crystallized state as sugar or in thick liquid form as\nsyrups. Included in sweeteners are maple sugar and syrups,\ncaramel, golden syrup, artificial and natural honey, maltose,\nglucose, dextrose, glucose (also known as high-fructose corn\nsyrup), other types of fructose, sugar confectionery, and\nlactose.\nIn the last several decades, increasingly larger quantities\nof cereals (primarily maize) have been used to produce\nsweeteners derived from starch. The overall trends show\n306 kcal were consumed per person per day, about a third\nmore than in 1962; caloric sweeteners also accounted for a\nlarger share of both total energy and total carbohydrates\nconsumed. Not surprisingly, we have shown that all\nmeasures of caloric sweetener increase significantly as gross\nnational product (GNP) per capita of the country and\nurbanization increase. However, the interaction between\nincome growth and urbanization is important. Figure 2\nshows the relationship between the proportion of energy\nfrom different food sources and GNP, for two different\nlevels of urbanization; see Drewnoswski and Popkin10\nfor a description of the analysis. In the less urbanized\ncase (panel A), the share of sweeteners increases sharply\nwith income, from about 5% to about 15%. In the more\nurbanized case (panel B), the share (over 15%) is much\nhigher at lower income and decreases with income. The\nanalysis confirms previous observations that diets of people\nliving in urban areas are distinct from those of their rural\nAnimal source foods\nThe revolution in ASF refers to the increase in demand and\nproduction of meat, fish, and milk in low-income develop-\ning countries. Delgado at International Food Policy Research\nInstitutes (IFPRIs) has studied this issue extensively in a\nnumber of seminal reports and papers16,17 Most of the\nworld's growth in production and consumption of these\nfoods comes from the developing countries; thus, develop-\ning countries will produce 63% of meat and 50% of milk in\n2020. It is a global food activity, transforming the grain\nmarkets for animal feed. It also leads to resource degradation,\nrapid increases in feed grain imports, rapid concentration of\nproduction and consumption, and social change.\nChina provides an example of the shift in intake of ASF.\nThe results are presented in depth elsewhere.8 In the past\n50 y, using the per capita data from the nationally represen-\ntative household survey series in China, we find that annual\nconsumption of animal foods more than tripledFfrom a\nprior to 1979, but thereafter, the rate of increase was much\nmeat and meat products increased from 8.4 to 20.3 kg,\nand eggs from 2.0 to 7.8 kg per capita, per year.

In the United\nStates, daily caloric intake appears to be increasingFprima-\nrily from energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and an increase\nin snacks.18\u00ad23 More meals are being consumed away from\nincreases in salty snacks, fast foods,18\u00ad20 and added caloric\nsweeteners.14,25 Fast foods generally are more energy dense,\nbut lack many critical nutrients,26,27 and might be linked\nwith obesity.28\u00ad33 Fruit and vegetable consumption remains\nPhysical activity changes appear to be changing\nrapidly!\nThere are several linked changes in physical activity\noccurring jointly. One is a shift away from the high-energy\nexpenditure activities such as farming, mining, and forestry\ntowards the service sector. Elsewhere we have shown this\nlarge effect.34 Reduced energy expenditures in the same\noccupation are a second change. Other major changes relate\nto the modes of transportation and activity patterns during\nleisure hours. China again provides interesting illustrations.\nTable 1 shows that the proportion of urban adults (male and\nfemale) working in occupations where they participate in\nvigorous activity patterns has decreased. In rural areas,\nhowever, there has been a shift for some towards increased\nphysical activity linked to holding multiple jobs and more\nintensive effort. For rural women, there is a shift towards a\nlarger proportion engaged in more energy-intensive work,\nbut there are also sections where light effort is increasing. In\ncontrast, for rural men there is a small decrease in the\nproportion engaged in light work effort.\nIn China, 14% of households acquired a motorized vehicle\nodds of being obese were 80% higher (Po0.05) in house-\nholds for men and women who owned a motorized vehicle\ncompared to those who did not own a vehicle.35\nTelevision ownership has skyrocketed in China, leading to\ngreater inactivity during leisure time.11 Among youth in the\nUnited States and Mexico, TV viewing is quite extensive but\nit is much lower in China, Russia, and the Philippines. The\naverage child in the United States today spends more than\n3 h a day watching television or playing video games and\nanother 3 h with other forms of media such as movies and\nprerecorded music.36 So far, children in China spend\nsignificantly less time than their US counterparts with such\nsedentary media, but if US patterns prevail, we should expect\nthat Chinese children will spend more time attending to the\nmedia in the future. Similarly, CHNS data for 1997 found\nthat children aged 6\u00ad12 y watched TV at an average of 0.77 h\nper day, with slightly lower levels, 0.52 h per day, in children\naged 13\u00ad18 y; overall, about 9% reporting watching TV for\ntwo or more hours per day. The overall physical activity\npattern data are more limited among the youth. We have\ndescribed physical activity patterns of youth in Russia,\nChina, and the Philippines in a series of papers. In each\ncase, we have found that walking to school is a major source\nof overall physical activity.37\u00ad40 We have also found quite\nmeaningful differences between countries. For instance, in\nthe Philippines, youth of all ages are actively engaged in\nactivities such as cleaning, washing, and other measures of\nhome production, while in China, children are essentially\nexcluded from such activities and study much more.40\nObesity patterns and trends\nIt is important to first present a few key issues related to\nadults, allowing us to provide a full picture of obesity in\nchildren, as there is limited data on children available.\nShifts in adult obesity are occurring across the globe\nWe have shown elsewhere that the current levels of over-\nweight in countries as diverse as Mexico, Egypt, and South\nAfrica are shown to be equal or greater than those in the\nUnited States.7 Moreover, the rate of change in obesity in\nlower- and middle-income countries is shown to be much\ngreater than in higher-income countries; see Popkin7 for an\noverview. The survey data sets used are nationally represen-\ntative comparable data for a number of countries for current\nlevels of overweight and obesity prevalence and their rates of\nchange. Figure 3 (panel A) presents the level of obesity and\nTable 1 Force distribution among Chinese adults, aged 20\u00ad45 y (China\nLight (%) Vigorous (%)\nWorldwide obesity dynamics and their determinants\nBM Popkin and P Gordon-Larsen\nInternational Journal of Obesity\noverweight in several illustrative countries (Brazil, Mexico,\nEgypt and Morocco, South Africa, Thailand, and China).\nMost interesting is the fact that many of these countries with\nquite high overweight levels are very low-income. Moreover,\nit probably surprises many people that the levels of obesity of\nseveral countriesFall with much lower income levels than\nthe United StatesFare so high.\nThere is enormous heterogeneity in the patterns, trends,\nand timing of obesity among developing countries. Many\ncountries in Latin America began their transition earlier in\nthe past century and certainly entered the nutrition-related\nnoncommunicable disease (NR-NCD) stage of the transition\nfar earlier than did other regions. However, there is\nenormous heterogeneity in countries, such as Haiti, and\nsubpopulations in Central America are still in the receding\nfamine period. Moreover, some countries, such as Mexico,\nreally experienced an accelerated transition in the 1990s.41\nThe Middle East, North Africa, and Asia appear to have\nbegun their transition at a much later date as have most\nother countries in the developing world except for the\nWestern Pacific nations.\nChanges in the developing world are faster than in\nhigher-income countries!\nFigure 3 (panel B) shows how quickly overweight and obesity\nstatus have emerged as a major public health problem in\nsome of these countries. Compared with the United States\nand European countries, where the annual increase in the\nprevalence of overweight and obesity among adult men and\nwomen is about 0.25 for each, the rates of change are very\nhigh in Asia, North Africa, and Latin AmericaFtwo to five\ntimes greater than in the United States.\nThe burden of obesity has shifted to the poor!\nElsewhere we have shown that a large number of low- and\nmoderate-income countries already have a greater likelihood\nthat adults residing in lower-income or lower-educated\nhouseholds are overweight and obese, relative to adults in\nhigher-income or higher-educated households.42,43 Both\npapers used 37 nationally representative surveys of women\naged 20\u00ad50 y. One showed that countries with a GNP per\ncapita over about $2500 are likely to have a burden of obesity\ngreater among the poor. Belonging to the lower-SES group\nconfers strong protection against obesity in low-income\neconomies, can reduce or increase obesity in lower-middle\nincome economies and is a systematic risk factor for obesity\nin upper-middle income developing economies. A multilevel\nlogistic modelFincluding an interaction term between the\ncountry's GNP and each woman's SESFindicates that\nobesity starts to fuel health inequities in the developing\nworld when the GNP reaches a value of about US$2500 per\ncapita. Examples of countries above the US$2500 per capita\nincome levelFthose upper-middle income developing\neconomies with higher obesity among the lower-SES groups\ninclude Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa.\nChild and youth obesity prevalence and trends\nA study of adolescent obesity dynamics was undertaken\nacross four longitudinal studies.44 Nationally representative\nand 1997) were used.

The burden of nutritional problems is shifting\nfrom energy imbalance deficiency to excess among older\nchildren and adolescents in Brazil and China. These changes\nand differences may relate to changes and differences in key\nenvironmental factors across countries. For example, the\nGDP tripled in the United States and Brazil, but increased by\ngreater than 10-fold in China during this time.44 Conversely,\nRussia saw a worsening of the economy and a decline in\nliving standards (eg decline of living standards, including a\ndecrease of food consumption and production). Over the\npast three decades, the percentage of older children and\nadolescents who were overweight tripled in Brazil and\nalmost doubled in the United States. We found that the\noverweight prevalence was considerably higher in children\nthan in adolescents in Russia, Brazil, and China but not in\nthe United States.44 The far greater proportion of adolescent\noverweight prevalence in the United States stands out. It is\npossible that this relates partly to our use of the IOTF\nreference, but these differences may be far too great to be\nexplained by the use of this reference.\nSimilar to adults, the changes in youth obesity in these\nfour countries vary across levels of household income. Over\nthe past two decades, the prevalence of overweight in Brazil\nincreased most quickly in high-SES groups, but in the United\nStates the increase was greatest in low-SES groups.44 In\naddition, the prevalence of overweight was much higher in\nurban areas than in rural areas in Russia and the United\nStates.\nChildhood and adolescent obesity patterns across\nEurope\nA recent comparative study conducted across Europe,\npresented in depth in other studies, also utilized the IOTF\ncutoff criteria for overweight.45,46 These are not nationally\nrepresentative studies, but all use BMIs based on anthropo-\nmetric measuresFnot self-reported weight and heightFthat\nare representative samples of the general population of\neither the country or a region of it. Four surveys (those for\nBelgium, Croatia, the Netherlands, and Switzerland) did not\nprovide estimates of overweight using the IOTF criteria and\nthe authors used other methods to estimate the proportion\nof the sample that would exceed the IOTF cutoff points. This\nstudy, as well as others, has shown that the prevalence of\nobesity has risen dramatically in many countries across\ndiffers across Europe from France (19%), the United King-\nand Northern Europe to Russia (10%) and Poland (18%) in\nthe Eastern bloc and to Spain (34%), Italy (36%), and Malta\nweight is similar, with particularly high levels in the United\nKingdom (21%) and Southern Europe (Spain (21%), Greece\nmany reasons for these variations.

Studies\nof both dietary and body composition trends seem to\nindicate an increase in rates of change across the world.\nThis has been found in studies of income and price changes\non the structure of the Chinese diets as well as with obesity\ntrends in the United States. In China, two studies have\nshown that shifts towards intake of higher fat foods and\nhigher fat diets have accelerated changes in income.48,49 In\neach case, longitudinal analysis was used to show a\nsignificant increase in the impact of income on diet.\nIn a longitudinal study in which over 9000 US young\ntimes over the span of two decades, it was found that more\nwas highest among black females, moderate in Hispanic\nfemales, and lowest in white females, while among males the\nhighest onset was seen for Hispanic males. In addition,\nMcTigue et al50 found a large secular weight trend: people\nborn in later calendar years tended to have larger age-specific\nBMI. In every case in which the same age was sampled for\nboth birth cohorts, the 1957-born group had a lower mean\nBMI than the 1964-born group. The intermediate birth\ncohorts had intermediate-range mean BMI values.\nUnited States case studyFinsights into current\ndynamics in the higher-income world\nGordon-Larsen et al51 sought to examine patterns of change\nin obesity among US white, black, Hispanic, and Asian teens\nas they transition from adolescence to young adulthood. At\nbaseline (1996) obesity prevalence (using IOTF cut points)\nwas 10.9%. After 5 y, a substantial proportion of the\nadolescents nonobese at baseline had become obese (12.7%\nincidence) and remained obese (9.4% obesity maintenance),\nwith a small proportion moving from obese to nonobese\n(1.6% reversal). Obesity incidence was especially high among\nrelative to white females (12.5%), as was obesity main-\nrelative to white females (8.5%). Importantly, these data\nschoolchildren. Thus, in the 5-y study period more than 1.9\nmillion US adolescents became obese, more than 1.3 million\nadolescents remained obese, while only approximately one-\nquarter of a million adolescents became nonobese.\nConclusion\nWe have summarized the profound global shift in obesity.\nThe high obesity prevalence in adolescents is shown to be\npersistent into adulthood with high incidence in the\ntransition to adulthood. We see from the US case that the\nincrease in obesity from adolescence to adulthood is\ntremendous. Other countries following this trajectory are\nlikely to see substantial adult obesity and its associated\ncomorbidities if this trajectory is not curbed.\nIn addition, current data indicate that the levels of adult\nobesity far exceed those of children across all regions of the\nworld. In addition, it seems that rapid increases in child and\nadolescent obesity have emerged in recent years, but they\nstill do not equal the rate of increase found among adults.\nWe have briefly summarized some of the broader trends in\ndiet in the developing and developed world with a focus on\ncase studies from China and the United States. Underlying\nthese trends are the major and rapid shifts in diets of the\ndeveloping world, particularly with respect to greater intake\nof fat, caloric sweeteners, and ASF. In addition, declines in\nphysical activity in leisure, transportation, and work asso-\nciated with modernization play a substantial role. Greater\namounts of sedentary behavior time associated with the\nworldwide use of mass media compound these effects.\nReferences\n1 Popkin BM.
