Exclusion\ncriteria were: cerebral infarction (CI) asso-\nciated with cardiac arrhythmia, arteritis,\ntrauma, haematopathy, medication,\ntumour, cerebrovascular malformation or\naneurysm; haemorrhagic infarct; liver or\nkidney dysfunction; autoimmune disease;\npregnancy; CI of indeterminate cause.\nIntima\u00admedia thickness and plaques were\nassessed by high-resolution B-mode ultra-\nsonography using a Voluson\u00d5 730 (GE\nHealthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) with a\n6\u00ad12 MHz linear-array transducer. Bilateral\ncarotid bifurcations, and internal and\ncommon carotid arteries, were examined.\nThe presence of carotid atherosclerotic\nplaque was defined as an area of focal wall\nthickening more than 50% greater than\nThe control population included age- and\nsex-matched unrelated subjects undergoing\nroutine health screening at Xiangya\nHospital during the same period. Exclusion\ncriteria were: carotid plaque disclosed by\nultrasonography; atherosclerotic retinop-\nathy disclosed by ophthalmoscopy; history\nof cerebrovascular or cardiovascular dis-\nease; family history of stroke; cardiac\narrhythmia; haematological disease; endo-\ncrine or metabolic disorders; pregnancy.\nFor all participants, total serum cholesterol,\ntriglyceride, low-density lipoprotein choles-\nterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol (HDL-C) were quantified\naccording to standard procedures.\nThe study was approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of Central South University and\nwritten informed consent was obtained from\nall participants.\nGenetic analyses\nPeripheral blood (5 ml) was collected in\nsterile tubes containing disodium ethylene-\ndiaminetetra-acetic acid and stored at\n\u00c020C until analysis. Genomic DNA was\nextracted using a DNA blood kit (Qiagen,\nVenlo, Netherlands) according to the manu-\nfacturer's instructions. Allele-specific\nTaqMan\u00d5 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,\nCA, USA) probes and primers were used\nfor the allelic discrimination of specific SNP.\nPrimer and probe sequences are shown in\nTables 1 and 2 (Shanghai Gene Core Bio\nTechnologies Company, Shanghai, China).\nTaqMan\u00d5 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nTable 1.
