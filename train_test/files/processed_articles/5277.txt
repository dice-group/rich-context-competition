Digital literacy and its development in a\ncountry depend on its use by the citizens of a country. In India, they have recently made strides in using digital technology due to\nfast development in the Internet technology. The recent \"World Report on Disability\" by World Health Organization (WHO) puts\nthe disabled populations in the world at 15%. There are 26.81 million Indians who suffer from some form of disability. This research\nstudy critically probes the two determinants of the digital divide: (a) the accessibility of websites of banks and (b) the accessibility\nof financial and banking information on their websites. United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities\n(UNCRPD) guidelines has been ratified by Government of India in 2007. The websites of 103 BFIs in India were used for the study.\nThe research study work started on December 3, 2013; it being the World Day of the Disabled. The study aimed for evaluating the\nwebsites in terms of media tool for communication, information, services, accessibility, design, and interactive participatory features\nfor persons with disabilities. The study showed that 26% of the websites under study and 5% International BFIs in India offered\ninformation in vernacular medium, while only seven websites of the BFIs in India passed markup validation test.\n",

Banking sector in India has made\nstrides in using digital technology. Due to fast development in\nthe Internet technology in higher income group economies,\nunder developed and developing countries will be automati-\ncally marginalized thereby creating digital divide. And, it will\naffect automatically more to a person with disability.\nThe size of the financially excluded population in the world\nis enormous: Around 3 billion people in the world have less\naccess and opportunity for formal financial services. Websites\narethefaceofinstitutions,whichhaveaglobalreach.According\nto Gerry McGovern (2006), \"website reflects true face of an\norganization as never before\" (December 5, 2013). Website\ncreates a direct link between the organization and the customer.\nBFIs in India offer people help in investments, loans to increase\ntheir business, income, and worth. Persons with Disabilities\n(PWDs) are also consumers of products and programs of finan-\ncial institutions. Many PWDs access banks through websites.\nThey are used by BFIs in India, as an Information and\nCommunication Technology (ICT) medium. They use their\nwebsites for financial transactions, services, and dissemination\nof information. According to Gerry McGovern (2006), \"a\nwebsite is increasingly the place where customers get that vital\nfirst impression\" (December 5, 2013). Accessibility of these\nwebsites to PWDs will be the test of their global reach. All the\nBFIs in India offer people help in investments, loans to increase\ntheir business, income, and worth guided and monitored by\nReserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations.\nThe History of Indian Banking and\nFinance Institutions\nThe Indian Central government had a strong control over the\nbanking system in India.

J. Mathew Martin1,2,3 and Manukonda Rabindranath4\n Keywords\nBanking and Financial Institutions in India, accessibility, information, dissemination, digital convergence, websites, media,\npersons with disabilities\n2 SAGE Open\nIn the beginning days after Independence banking system\nwas operated by the private banking system.\nThe Indian government thought that they should have a\nstrong influence over the strong banking sector. As a result,\nthere is a decline in productivity and a rise in nonperforming\nassets. After that the government thought of appointing\nombudsmen to look into the problem of the organizations.\nThe RBI and Regulations\nRBI Act, 1934, gave the provision to establish RBI on April\n1, 1935, to take precautionary measures and keep a tab on the\nbanking and finance sectors. It is an autonomous body to\ntake decisions and for day-to-day governance. RBI will print\nnew currency notes of different denominations depending\nabout the requirements and keep some reserve finances of\nthe banking sectors as security deposits for the customers in\ncase of some eventualities or huge loss for a particular bank.\n\"Digital inclusion tends to be solely associated with tech-\nThe Internet facilitates the creation of websites.According\nto Karandikar (2011), \"in India the internet is arguably the\nmost convergent medium of communication today\" (pp.\n32-37). Websites are a convergent medium enabling the\nfinancial institutions in India to interact and communicate\nwith the prospective consumers and the public. Hence, acces-\nsible websites have great significance in reaching out finan-\ncial programs, products, and information about financial\ninstitutions of higher standing in economics.\nThe National Policy on Universal Electronic\nAccessibility\nThe objective of the policy is to provide PWDs equal access to\nelectronic and information and communication technology and\nservices.This policy expands on the United Nations Convention\non the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) which\nIndia has ratified. The Union Cabinet on October 3, 2013\napproved the national policy on universal electronic accessibil-\nity that recognizes the need to eliminate discrimination on the\nbasis of disabilities as well as to facilitate equal access to elec-\ntronics and ICTs. The policy will facilitate equal and unhindered\naccess to electronics and ICT products and services by differ-\nently abled persons (both physically and mentally challenged)\nand to facilitate local language support for the same. This shall\nbe achieved through universal access to electronics and ICT\nproducts and services to synchronize with barrier-free environ-\nment and preferably usable without adaptation. Differently\nabled persons all over the country will benefit from this policy\n(Press Information Bureau, Government of India, 2013).\nThe following strategies are envisaged for the implemen-\ntation of the policy:\n1. Creating awareness on design and accessibility of\nuniversal electronics.\n2. Capacity building and infrastructure development.\n3. Setting up of model electronics and ICT centers for\nproviding training and demonstration to special edu-\ncators of/and physically as well as mentally chal-\nlenged persons.\n4. Conducting research and development, use of inno-\nvation, ideas, technology, and so on, whether indige-\nnous or outsourced from abroad.\n5. Developing programs and schemes with greater\nemphasis for differently abled persons.\n6. Developing procurement guidelines for electronics\nand ICTs for accessibility and assistive needs.\nThe Growth of ICT in India\nThere is an exponential growth in Information Technology (IT)\nin India. Personal computer (PC) penetration in India is 18 per\n1,000aspertheannualreportoftheManufacturer'sAssociation\nof Information Technology (MAIT), published in July 2006.\nInternet users. This is according to the I-Cube (Internet in\nIndia) study released and conducted annually by Indian\nMarket Research Bureau (IMRB) International and Internet\nand Mobile Association of India (IAMAI).\nThis emphasizes the need for such cost-effective technol-\nogy with global reach. Thus, it validates the use of websites\nto bridge the gap and reaching out to PWDs.\nUses and Gratification Theory (UGT)\nThe current study draws its theoretical base from the UGT of\nElihu Katz (1959), which encourages audience-centered\napproach in mass communication (pp. 1-6). This theory\nhelps us to understand why and how persons using ICT gain\nin terms of information and education. As a positivistic the-\nory of communication, unlike other media effect theories,\nUGT is based on sociopsychological need of the audience.\nPWDs being part of the society uses ICT to satiate their\nneeds, which includes financial and banking needs.\nIn this research study, PWDs are those, as per the PWD\n(Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full\nParticipation) Act, 1995, who are affected with blindness,\nlow vision, leprosy-cured, hearing impairment, loco motor\ndisability, mental retardation, and mental illness. According\nto this act, in India, \"PWD\" means a person suffering from\nnot less than 40% of any disability as certified by a medical\nauthority (Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs\nAccessibility Rights of PWDs\nIn India, there are 26.81 million Indians who suffer from\nsome form of disability. The estimated population with bank-\ning or financial transaction needs in India, among the\nMathew Martin and Rabindranath 3\npopulation in the age group of 19 and above). It is a large\nnumber of the population who cannot be denied their rights\nto banking and financial inclusion. Quite often, nonaccessi-\nbility of the websites of these banking and BFIs in India\nbecome one of the reasons for this financial inclusion by\nBFIs (Table 1).\nArticle 9.2 (g) and (h) of UNCRPD especially lays down\nthat states should facilitate access for PWDs to new informa-\ntion and communication technologies, especially the Internet.\nIn fact, their report on \"making mobile phones and services\naccessible to persons with disabilities\" published by the\nInternational Telecommunication Union (ITU) in coopera-\ntion with global initiative for inclusive ICTs (ITU & G3ict,\nn.d.), Nirmita Narasimhan and Axel Leblois (2012) state that\nthe Article 9 makes provisions for promoting assistive tech-\nnologies and information in alternative formats (2013,\nDecember 21). In addition, Article 9.2 (f) states that signato-\nries must promote forms of help and support to PWDs to\nensure their access to information (Narasimhan & Leblois,\nlines the mandate to ensure access to \"new information and\ncommunications technologies and systems including the\nThe ITC Act, 2000, of India was entirely silent on the sub-\nject of web accessibility. Since then efforts were made by\nvarious advocacy groups to increase accessibility of ICT. This\nresulted in the union cabinet of India passing the national\npolicy on universal electronic accessibility. They are provided\nin the \"guidelines for Indian Government websites, an inte-\ngral part of central secretariat manual of office procedure\"\n(Verma, Joshi, & Kalra, 2009, p. 4) prepared by National\nInformatics Center (NIC) and adopted by Department of\nAdministrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG).\nCommon man and PWDs communicate through websites\nof BFIs with minimum expenditure. BFIs in India cannot\nignore the large consumer base with the Internet penetration\nincreasing at the rate of about 16% every year.\nMaking Website for PWDs\nIf the parameters of a website's communication capabilities are\nmet by BFIs in India, like W3C compliance under markup lan-\nguage, then we may consider a website as \"good website for\ndisability communication.\" There are various parameters to\ntest a website's communication capabilities. For this research,\nthe parameters used to study the websites of BFIs in India are\naccessibility, design, and interactive and participatory features.\nConsidering equal opportunities provided under the PWD Act,\n1995, this research also looks into the equalization and normal-\nization theories with respect to the Internet.1\nObjectives\nThe main objective of the short research study was to assess\nand demonstrate the qualities of websites designed by BFIs\nin India, in terms of information dissemination, accessibility,\ndesign, and interactive and participatory features. The study\nalso aimed for measuring these features in all the websites\nselected for the study, using online validation methods\nalready available on the Internet.\nResearch Questions\nDoes the BFI website have information dissemination\nfeatures?\n1. Does the BFI website follow the guidelines of\nUNCRPD with reference to accessibility, access to\ninformation?\n2. Are the BFIs websites designed to meet the require-\nments of students with disabilities, such as availabil-\nity of screen reader, font size increase, color change,\nalternate texts, and Indian Sign Language?\n3. Do the websites of BFIs in India conform to the\naccessible design features such as \"F\" pattern (Does\nthe website have the shape of letter \"F\" in their design\nand layout) for fast viewing of a website?\n4. Are the websites of BFIs in India more interactive or\nparticipatory in nature for PWDs?\nMethod\nThis study aimed at requirements and qualities of a website\ndesigned by BFIs in India in terms of design, formal and\naccessible features, necessary precautions were taken to\nselect the websites available on the list of BFIs as per RBI\nreport 2013 published by the Department of Economic and\nand measure accessibility features. The specific day\nDecember 3, 2013, being \"World Disability Day\" was\nselected for studying the accessibility features of these web-\nsites, considering the maximum significance of the day in a\nyear for PWDs in India.\nIn total, 103 websites of various BFIs in India were care-\nfully studied. These BFIs were RBI accredited as per the list\ndisplayed in the website of RBI. Screenshots of the websites\nwere also used as part of the sample. In this study, the\nresearcher has tested 103 websites of BFIs in India for W3C\ncompliance and assessed them. The assessment was based on\nthe several parameters like interactivity, accessibility, and\ninformation inputs.\nSame was done using the inventory of the websites and\nthe structural analysis for tabulation of the data. As the\nTable 1. Disabled Population by Sex and Residence.\nResidence Persons Males Females\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 2. Classification of BFIs in India.\nType of BFIs n (%)\nNote. BFI = Banking and Financial Institution.\nwebsites followed no single standard, there was a need to\nstandardize the website area. The screenshots of every home\npage of the 103 websites of BFIs in India were captured and\nprinted.\nContent analysis of the website in terms of accessibility\nwas done online, using the web-based validator tools for\naccessibility. The Universal Resource Locator (URL) of the\nwebsite of the BFIs in India to be tested was typed in the\naddress slot and tested for its validation online. The results of\nthe test were considered as data for analysis. The online free\ntest tools provided by W3C were used for accessibility in this\nstudy. This includes validator tools for \"markup validation,\"\n\"cascading style sheets validator,\" \"mobile validator,\" \"link\ncheck validator,\" and \"unicorn validator.\"\nSampling\nThe present research is a survey with purposive sampling.\nThe list of all BFIs was obtained from the annual report on\nthe profile of banks published by the DEPR, RBI in the year\nper the above report are selected as sample for the study.\nInitially, each selected website was browsed in search of\nvarious aspects of the website in terms of design, formal,\nfunctional, and accessible features. Later, they were classi-\nfied into three groups: (a) those features that belonged to pri-\nvate sector banks (PSBs), (b) public sector banks, and (3)\nforeign banks (FBs) so that each accessible feature of the\nwebsite collected would fall into these three groups, and a\ncomparative study was done.\nLimitations\n1. Only 103 websites of BFIs in India were studied.\nThis included 43 websites belonging to FBs, 40 web-\nsites belonging to PSBs, and 20 belonging to PSBs.\n2. The websites of financial institutions which are\nundertakings of Government of India, including that\nof RBI, have been included in the PSBs.\n3. Websites selected for the study included those BFIs\nwhich were obtained from annual report on the pro-\nfile of banks published by the DEPR, RBI in the year\n4. The websites have been downloaded, assessed, and\nDay). No updates were studied.\n5. The accessibility of electronic documents linked with\nwebpage is not included.\n6. Websites in English language are selected for the\nstudy.\nAnalysis and Discussion\nTo achieve the objectives of the research of BFIs operating in\nIndia, data collected using the online research tools provided\nwere gathered and the same were analyzed using SPSS.\nDuring the study, it was observed that all the websites of BFIs\nin India could be opened using the URL provided in the list of\nHowever, the URL of one BFI, namely, \"Shipping Credit\nInvestment Company of India\" (SCIC) showed that it was a\ndormant website and could not be further assessed. Some of\nthe websites had basic features of accessibility such as screen\nreader, font size or color change, alternative text for the visuals\nfor the blind, and use of captions for the video or Sign\nLanguage for the Deaf (capital \"D\" to indicate culturally deaf).\nIn Figure 1 and Table 2, it may be observed that maximum\nnumber of websites of BFIs of India (43) belonged to FB\ncategory (42%). However, there were only 20 BFIs belong-\ning to PSBs, whose websites were also part of the study.\nWebsites of BFIs and the W3C\nValidation Results\nTo test hypothesis and answer the research questions related\nto W3C guidelines followed by BFIs in India, the data gath-\nered using the online research tools provided by W3C were\nanalyzed using SPSS. During the study, analysis in terms of\nthe link of the website design of the BFIs with other search\nengines and websites, markup language, Cascading Style\nSheets (CSS) validation, and accessibility tests were done.\nThe result of the same is depicted in Table 3.\nTable 3 shows that majority of the websites (69.9%) of the\nBFIs in India had website link errors, thus causing problems\nin the links to search engines and other website links for the\nusers. In fact, only a few (6.7%) of the BFIs in India had\nFigure 1. Classification of BFIs in India.\nNote. BFI = Banking and Financial Institution.\nMathew Martin and Rabindranath 5\nwebsites without markup errors, resulting in making the\nwebsites extremely difficult to maintain, apply style or lay-\nout, consistently across platforms.\nThe BFI websites were tested in terms of CSS. It was\nfound that majority (74.75%) of the websites had errors mak-\ning browsing of web pages through all the Internet and mobile\nphone platforms difficult to the customers, thus decreasing\nthe use. The result of the professional website accessibility\ntest using \"A Checker\" showed that only 14.5% of Indian\nBFIs websites passed the test, thus proving that most of the\nwebsites of BFIs are inaccessible to PWDs. However, eight\nBFIs belonging to public sector had passed the test ensuring\nthe financial inclusion through their website.\nAccessibility Features as Depicted in\nthe Websites of BFIs in India\nTo test hypothesis and answer the research questions related\nto accessibility of the websites of BFIs in India, data col-\nlected using the online research tools provided were gathered\nand the same were analyzed using SPSS. During the study, as\nper the objective to demonstrate the design of the websites,\nan analysis in terms of the website design with \"F\" pattern,\nmobile phone compatibility, vernacular language choice,\nonline savings bank account opening facility, mobile and the\nInternet banking facility, disability-specific graphics and\nalternative text for image, W3C compliance was done. The\nresult of the same is depicted in Table 4.\nThe researcher has concentrated on the \"F\"-shaped read-\ning pattern while studying design (Nielsen, 2006). For this,\nthe researcher has captured a screenshot of the home page of\nevery website and overlaid \"F\" shape on top of it, just below\nthe masthead of the website. However, the reading patterns\nof the PWDs are also being considered. Eye-tracking visual-\nization shows that user of a website gaze at \"F\"-shaped pat-\ntern: two horizontal stripes followed by a vertical stripe, \"F\"\nfor fast. That is how users read the website content. Their\neyes move at amazing speeds in a few seconds across the\nwebsite's word, in a pattern that is very different from what\none learned in school. However, website reading pattern of\nPWDs is a matter for research. This research study has not\nmade an attempt in this direction. In Table 4, it may be\nobserved that majority of the websites (66%) of the BFIs in\nIndia had \"F\" pattern, enabling easy reading for the users.\nHowever, only few (17%) of the BFIs in India had mobile\nphone compatibility, resulting in losing out a huge popula-\ntion unable to use the mobile phone in viewing the banking\nwebsite and its facilities. Even though majority (60%) of the\nBFIs operating in India belonged to the public and private\nsector, vernacular language facility was offered by only 28%\nof the BFIs. Thus, losing out on rural banking customers,\nwho might understand only the vernacular language. The\ndisability-specific graphics or alternative text to images in\nthe website was offered only by 9.7% of the BFIs in India,\nthus limiting the use of the website by visually challenged\ncustomers. Among the 103 websites of BFIs in India, only 11\nwebsite had full compliance as per the norms of W3C.\nInteractive and Participative Features\nDepicted in the Website of BFIs in\nIndia\nIf website is the face of an organization in the new medium,\nits global reachability can be only assessed based on its\naccessibility. W3C compliance remains the qualification for\nany website that can be easily accessible by banking custom-\ners. During the research study, as per the objective, the\nresearchers made exclusive study of the interactive and par-\nticipative features of the websites of BFIs in India.\nIn Table 5, it is found that online insurance facility was\nprovided only by few (20%) BFIs in India. This is another\narea for further research. Web accessibility for a BFI in India\nmeans those customers with disabilities can perceive, under-\nstand, navigate, and interact with the websites. Majority\n(71%) of the BFIs in India provided social media links to\ntheir websites increasing their reach and presence.\nOne of the good features of a website is to provide forms for\nvisitors to contact, complaint, or to give feedback. Provision of\nlist of ATMs (automated teller machines) and branches, online\ncomplaint redresses system, and search engine in the websites\nof BFIs makes it an interactive and participatory platform. This\nmeans PWDs could access the website and need not waste their\ntime and energy travelling in search of the nearest BFIs for\ntheir financial needs solutions and transactions.\nTable 3.

It begins at\nthe developer level during production and then finally ends at\nthe user level. During the process there are various compo-\nnents that take care of the continuous relationship between\ndevelopers. It includes authoring tools, evaluation tools, con-\ntent, browsers, media players, and assisting technologies.\nThis relationship can be explained through Figure 2\nHence, it is imperative that each component is taken care to\nkeep the relationship while designing the website. Developer\nshould always keep in mind the end user of the website while\ndesigning the same. In the case of websites developed by BFIs\nin India, accessibility should be one of the main components\nwhich needs to be taken care to ensure financial inclusion for\nall. To enable accessibility, assistive technologies come to the\nrescue of the developer and the user of the website. In fact,\naccording to Jane Seale (2010) digital inclusion is broadly\nunderstood as \"a phenomenon whereby PWDs are able to\naccess and meaningfully participate in the same financial,\nemployment, social and citizenship activities as others.\"\nConclusion\nEven though there is a lot yet to be done by BFIs in India in\nincreasing web accessibility, some laudable efforts have\nbeen made to use this new medium with global and local\nreach for financial inclusion. A good website of BFIs in\nIndia, to promote financial inclusion for PWDs, would\ninclude all possible features of accessibility, participation,\ninformation, and networking. These BFIs cannot afford to\nignore the large population of the Internet users among\nPWDs. The website of Bank of India (BOI; http://www.\nbankofindia.co.in), one of largest public sector banks, ranks\nhighest in terms of several accessible features available fol-\nlowed by the website of https://www.sc.com/.\nThe most surprising finding from the quantitative part of\nthe study is that majority of the content in the website of\nthese organizations was about information regarding the\nfinancial instruments aspects, instead of services for custom-\ners of BFIs. The front page of most of websites of BFIs in\nIndia is organizational centric. The most glaring aspect in\nthis study is the lack of vernacular/local language version of\nthe websites of BFIs in India. In this study, it is demonstrated\nthat very few of the websites have the links to new interac-\ntive and social communication tools like social media links,\nguest books, and Really Simple Syndicate (RSS) feeds.\nMajority of them (63.1%) do not even have feedback or com-\nplaint form details (Table 5). Some websites of the BFIs in\nIndia are not convergent in nature. It needs mentioning that\nthe BFIs should have a continuous interactive website with\naccessibility, participation, information, and networking\ninstead of the more common \"brochure\" or information sites.\nHowever, it is encouraging to note that on \"World\nDisability Day,\" that is, December 3, 2013, some of the web-\nsites of BFIs in India had accessible features. The details of\nthe analysis and results are given in Annexure 1. The acces-\nsible features decreased the digital divide between the PWDs\nand the BFIs offering banking and financial services in India.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNote\n1.
