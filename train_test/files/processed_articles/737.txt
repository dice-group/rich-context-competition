Data for alcohol consump-\ntion pertains to gallons of beer, wine, or spirits divided by the\npopulation over age 14 and come from the National Institute\non Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\nBivariate associations are presented as simple correlation\ncoefficients. Multivariate models use ordinary least squares,\nusing two tailed t tests for statistical significance.\nRESULTS\nAcross the nine regions, the suicide rate, averaged from 1988\u00ad\n18.0 in the Mountain region. Table 1 provides the regional\nrates of suicide, firearm suicide and non-firearm suicide, the\nlifetime prevalence of major depression and suicidal thoughts,\nand the average rates of household handgun ownership over\nthe 10 year period. Seventeen percent (17%) of respondents on\nthe NCS study reported ever having a major depression; resi-\ndents of the Pacific region had the highest prevalence. Over\n13% of respondents reported ever having serious suicidal\nthoughts; the Mountain region had the highest prevalence.\nRates of household handgun ownership range from 12% in the\nMid-Atlantic region to 38% in the East South Central region.\nAcross the nine regions, household handgun ownership\nrates are highly positively correlated with the suicide rate (r =\n0.59), and the firearm suicide rate (r = 0.83), and negatively\ncorrelated with the non-firearm suicide rate (r = -0.57) (table\n2). Household handgun ownership rates are not correlated\nwith either the prevalence of major depression (r = -0.10) or\nsuicidal thoughts (r = -0.01).\nThe prevalence of major depression and prevalence of\nsuicidal thoughts are positively correlated, but the prevalence\nof major depression is not correlated with the suicide rate\n(r = 0.00), while the prevalence of suicidal thoughts is corre-\nlated with the suicide rate (r = 0.68) (table 2). Figure 1\nprovides a graphical representation of regional suicide rates\nwith household handgun ownership, prevalence of major\ndepression, and suicidal thoughts across the nine regions.\nTable 1 Regional rates of suicide, mental illness, and handgun ownership\n(NE)\n(MA)\n(SA)\n(MT)\nENC, East North Central; ESC, East South Central; MA, Mid-Atlantic; MT, Mountain; NE, Northeast; PAC, Pacific; SA, South Atlantic; WNC, West North\nCentral; WSC, West South Central.\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nIn multivariate regression (n = 9), with household\nhandgun ownership, major depression and suicidal thoughts\nas the three independent variables, handgun ownership levels\nare positively associated with the firearm suicide rate\n(p<0.01), negatively associated with the non-firearm suicide\nrate (p <0.01), and positively associated with the overall sui-\ncide rate (p <0.05) (not shown). Suicidal thoughts are\npositively associated with all three suicide rates (p <0.01),\nwhile major depression is not associated with any of the three\nsuicide rates.\nThe Mountain region has the lowest population, and the\nhighest rate of suicide. As a sensitivity analysis we eliminated\nthat region from the regression (n = 8). In multivariate\nanalysis, the association of household handgun ownership\nlevels with firearm, non-firearm and total suicide rates is\nunaffected, major depression remains non-significantly corre-\nlated with the suicide rates, but suicidal thoughts are no\nlonger significantly correlated with any of the suicide rates\n(not shown). The simple correlation between suicidal\nthoughts and overall suicide falls dramatically (r = -0.11),\nwhile the correlation between major depression and suicidal\nthoughts rises to r = 0.93 (not shown).\nWhen any one of the additional variables (the percent of the\npopulation living in metropolitan areas, the percent with at\nleast some college, the percent unemployed, or the per capita\nalcohol consumption) are added as a fourth explanatory vari-\nable, the relationship between the regional prevalence of\nhousehold handgun ownership and the regional suicide rate\nremains similar, statistically and in magnitude, as does the\nrelationship between lifetime suicidal thoughts and the\nregional suicide rate (not shown).\nDISCUSSION\nAcross United States regions, where there are more handguns\nthere are higher rates of firearm suicide, lower rates of\nnon-firearm suicide, but higher levels of overall suicide. This\narticle shows that regional levels of handgun ownership are\nnot correlated with regional lifetime rates of major depression\nor suicidal thoughts. The association between rates of\nhandgun ownership and suicide remains strong at the\nregional level even after accounting for the lifetime prevalence\nof major depression and suicidal thoughts.\nThe association between household handgun ownership\nrates and the total suicide rate is robust. The handgun-suicide\nconnection holds when we use the 1992 rates of suicide rather\nownership rather than just handgun ownership are used as an\nindependent variable (though the association between gun\nownership levels and suicide is not quite so strong) (not\nshown). In addition, our results hold when any one of four\nadditional control variables are added to the analyses (urbani-\nzation, education, unemployment, or alcohol consumption).\nThis study has various limitations. First, as in any ecological\nstudy, a concern is that the association found at the aggregate\nlevel does not exist at the individual level. For example, from\nour data, even if there is a regional level association between\nalcohol and suicide, we do not know if the individuals who are\nalcohol consumers are the ones more likely to commit suicide.\nHowever, from other studies we know that guns are the prime\nmethod of suicide in the United States, most people who use\nguns to commit suicide use family guns, and a gun in the\nhome is a risk factor for firearm suicide.8 We thus have some-\nwhat less reason to be concerned about the \"ecological\nfallacy\" with respect to the gun prevalence-suicide connec-\ntion.\nSecond, there is uncertainty associated with our\nmeasures--particularly our explanatory variables that come\nfrom self report surveys--that may bias the estimated\nrelationships. Third, regional groupings undoubtedly mask\nconsiderable variation in the prevalence of both handgun\nownership levels and mental health problems. Because we\nhave representative mental health data only at the regional\nlevel, we have only nine observations. Fourth, we use only two\nmeasures of mental health--lifetime prevalence of major\ndepression and of serious suicidal thoughts. Other mental\nhealth and socioeconomic factors undoubtedly influence the\nsuicide rate.\nWe did not find any association between lifetime prevalence\nof major depression and suicide. Using data on current (30\nday) prevalence of major depression might provide a better\nmeasure of susceptibility to suicide than lifetime prevalence.\nThe NCS found a prevalence of current depression of less than\n5%, putting into question the precision of estimates for the\nleast populous of the nine census regions, if we use that\nmeasure. Dividing the country in four regions, the prevalence\nof current depression was highest in the South (where gun\nprevalence and suicide rates are highest) but second highest in\nthe Northeast (where gun prevalence and suicide rates are\nTable 2 Correlation coefficients: rates of suicide, firearm suicide, non-firearm\nsuicide, lifetime major depression, lifetime suicidal thoughts and firearm ownership,\nUS census regions\nSuicide rate\nFirearm\nsuicide rate\nNon-firearm\nsuicide rate\nMajor\ndepression\nSuicidal\nthoughts\nRates of suicide, firearm suicide, and non-firearm suicide come from the National Center for Health Statistics.\nPsychiatric disorder prevalence estimates by census region, 1991\u00ad92, come from the National Co-morbidity\nStudy.

Our main results are\nconsistent with case-control studies that find that a handgun\nor other firearm in the home is a risk factor for suicide, even\nafter accounting for various measures of mental health.14\u00ad18 We\nfind that in regions with higher levels of household handgun\nownership, there are higher rates of firearm suicide, lower\nrates of non-firearm suicide (suggesting substitution of meth-\nods), and higher rates of overall suicide. This positive\nassociation between handgun prevalence and overall suicide\nacross regions cannot be explained by differences in levels of\ntwo indicators of mental health problems--lifetime preva-\nlence of major depression or suicidal thoughts.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis research was supported in part by the Joyce Foundation, Robert\nWood Johnson Foundation, and the Open Society Institute.

This study investigates whether the\nassociation can be explained by differences in levels of mental health.\nMethods: The relationship between household handgun ownership and overall suicide rates across\nUnited States regions after accounting for two mental health variables--lifetime prevalence of major\ndepression and serious suicidal thoughts--were examined. Analyses also add another control variable\n(urbanization, education, unemployment, or alcohol consumption). Data on mental health variables\ncome from the National Comorbidity Study, conducted in the early 1990s. Data on household hand-\ngun ownership come from the General Social Surveys.\nResults: Across the nine regions for the early 1990s (n = 9), household handgun ownership rates are\npositively correlated with the suicide rate (r = 0.59) and are not correlated with either the lifetime\nprevalence of major depression or suicidal thoughts. After controlling for major depression and suicidal\nthoughts (and any of the four additional control variables), handgun ownership rates remain\nsignificantly associated with the overall suicide rate.\nConclusions: In United States regions with higher levels of household handgun ownership, there are\nhigher suicide rates. This relationship cannot be explained by differences in the prevalence of two\nmental health indicators--lifetime rates of either major depression or suicidal thoughts.\nCross sectional studies in the United States, across\nregions,1 2 states,3\u00ad5 and urban counties or cities,6 7 often\nfind a significant association between rates of house-\nhold firearm ownership and suicide rates.8 Control variables\nhave included urbanicity, education, unemployment and alco-\nhol problems, but no ecological study we know of has control-\nled for possible mental health confounders.\nIn this article we use data from the National Comorbidity\nSurvey (NCS) to investigate the regional relationship of hand-\ngun ownership levels and two psychological measures--\nlifetime prevalence of major depression and serious suicidal\nthoughts--with rates of suicide.\nOur primary aim is to begin to investigate whether the\nassociation between firearm prevalence and suicide can be\nexplained by differences in levels of mental health.\nMETHODS\nThis study focuses on three related dependent variables: the\ntotal suicide rate, the firearm suicide rate, and the non-firearm\nsuicide rate across the nine census regions. We begin with\nthree explanatory variables, which are included in all\nanalyses: rates of household handgun ownership, lifetime\nprevalence of major depression, and lifetime prevalence of\nserious suicidal thoughts. We also add a fourth explanatory\nvariable--which is (1) the percent of the population living in\nmetropolitan areas, or (2) the percent with at least some col-\nlege, or (3) the percent unemployed, or (4) the per capita alco-\nhol consumption. These four control variables are added, one\nat a time, to regressions that include (as independent\nvariables) the prevalence of household handgun ownership,\nlifetime suicidal thoughts, and lifetime major depression (that\nis, these regressions have four rather than three independent\nvariables).\nFor suicides, we use average regional rates for a 10 year\nsuicides, and non-firearm suicides as well as yearly population\nfigures come from the National Center for Health Statistics\nMortality Files.9 Deaths from firearm of undetermined inten-\ntion constitute less than 3% of all firearm deaths and are\nexcluded from the analysis. Region specific population and\nmortality data are derived by aggregating the corresponding\nstate based data. The suicide rate within each region is very\nstable over the 10 year study period; the largest absolute (and\npercentage) variation in the rate of suicide within a region\noccurred in region 3, where the suicide rate averaged over the\n100 000). This within-region variation is far smaller than the\ntwofold variation across regions. Using the rate for any year, or\nthe average over the 10 years, yields similar results.\nData for the percentage of households with handguns in\neach region come from published survey based estimates from\nthe General Social Surveys (GSS). The GSS, conducted by the\nNational Opinion Research Center most years from 1972 to\nnational surveys of gun ownership. In its current form, the\nGSS is conducted in person with a national area probability\nsample of 3000 non-institutionalized adults. The sample is\nchosen to be representative of each of the nine census regions.\nWe use regional handgun ownership data averaged over the\nBecause the stock of guns in the United States is so high\n(over 200 million guns in civilian hands) and because guns are\nhighly durable goods, year-to-year variations in survey\nestimates of firearm ownership rates are as likely to reflect\nmeasurement error rather than actual fluctuations in firearm\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAbbreviations: GSS, General Social Surveys; NCS, National\nComorbidity Survey\nSee end of article for\nauthors' affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCorrespondence to:\nDr David Hemenway,\nHarvard School of Public\nAvenue, Boston, MA\nhemenway@\nhsph.harvard.edu\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nownership levels. Handgun ownership data are, therefore,\naveraged over the 10 year study period to obtain more reliable\nestimates of regional handgun ownership rates.\nData on mental health variables come from the NCS, a\nnationally representative household survey of people aged\n15\u00ad54 years old. The NCS was conducted between September\ndistribution, correlates, and consequences of psychiatric\ndisorders in the United States. The final sample consisted of\n8098 participants for a response rate of over 82%. The survey\nprovides representative samples of the nine census regions.\nVerbal informed consent was obtained from all respondents\nand from the parents of minors before the interviews began.\nDetailed descriptions of the methods employed by the NCS\nhave been published elsewhere.11\nMental health variables come from a survey of 15\u00ad54 year\nolds, whereas the suicide data pertain to all ages. Since rates of\ndepression and suicide may be higher in more elderly groups,\nanalyses might be biased if regional age distributions materi-\nally differ. However, across the nine regions, the percent of the\npopulation that is 15\u00ad54 years old varies little: from 70% to\n73% with a mean of 72%. Moreover, the correlation coefficient\nacross the nine regions between the suicide rate for all\nsurprisingly, results are virtually identical whether the\ndependent variable is the regional suicide rate for all individu-\nals or the regional suicide rates for individuals aged 15\u00ad54 year\nolds.\nThe NCS provides information concerning the prevalence of\na multitude of psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders\n(depression, dysthymia, mania), anxiety disorders (agorapho-\nbia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic, social phobia, simple\nphobia, post-traumatic stress disorders), and substance use\ndisorders (alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, drug abuse,\ndrug dependence).\nAll respondents who screened positive for a lifetime preva-\nlence of any disorder and a random subsample of other\nrespondents were administered a part II interview (5877\nrespondents). The data for these respondents were weighted\nto correct for differential probabilities of selection into part II\nas well as for differential probabilities of within-household\nselection and non-response. Questions on three aspects of sui-\ncidality were included in the part II interview (suicidal\nthoughts, plans, attempts).\nSince the number of observations in our study is very small\n(n = 9 regions), we decided to investigate only a small number\nof disorders. The criteria for selection were a strong expected\nrelationship between the disorder and suicide based on the\npsychological literature, and a large enough prevalence of the\ndisorder in the population so the attributable risk would be\nsufficient to discover an effect and there would be an adequate\ncell size to ensure precision of the regional estimates. For the\nsecond criteria, we decided that the weighted national preva-\nlence of the disorder had to be great enough to ensure that, if\nthe least populous region had an average prevalence, there\nwould be a minimum of 40 respondents from that region\nreporting the disorder. Two disorders met our criteria: lifetime\nprevalence of major depression and of serious suicidal\nthoughts.\nThe question on suicide thoughts asked: \"Have you ever\nseriously thought about committing suicide?\" The prevalence,\ndistribution, and risk factors for lifetime prevalence of ever\nhaving serious suicidal thoughts is described in detail\nMajor depression is the prevalence of people having a\nlifetime major depressive episode, based on responses to a\nmodified version of the Composite International Diagnostic\nInterview.
