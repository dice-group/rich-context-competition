Conclusions Increased co-occurrence of victimization types put adolescents at\ngreater risks for poorer physical and psychological outcomes.\nKey words cyber victimization; latent class analysis; physical and psychological problems; victimization.\nIntroduction\nPeer victimization has been recognized as a significant\nproblem among children and adolescents because of its\nnegative influence on physical and psychosocial function-\nSubstantial research indicates that victims of bullying are\nat higher risks for health-related problems such as in-\ncreased medicine use (Due, Hansen, Merlo, Andersen, &\nHolstein, 2007) and injuries (Engstrom, Hallqvist, Moller,\n& Laflamme, 2005), as well as social and emotional prob-\nlems such as anxiety and depression (Menesini, Modena,\nSeveral types of peer victimization have been identified\nin previous studies, including physical attack, verbal ha-\nrassment, social exclusion, spreading rumors, and cyber\nand verbal harassment are generally considered a direct\nform of confrontation, whereas social exclusion and\nspreading rumors are often considered an indirect\n(Bjorkqvist, 1994) or relational (Crick & Grotpeter,\n1995) form of bullying. Cyber victimization refers to vic-\ntimization through the use of computers and cell phones.\nIt is a new type of victimization that has received growing\ninterests from researchers (Slonje et al., 2008; Williams\net al., 2007). Previous studies have shown that prevalence\nof verbal and relational victimization are higher than that of\nphysical and cyber victimization (e.g., Wang, Iannotti, &\nEmpirical evidence thus far suggests that different\ntypes of victimization are highly correlated and that the\nsame individuals may be victimized in multiple ways. For\ninstance, Nylund and colleagues (Nylund, Nishina,\nBellmore, & Graham, 2007) conducted a latent class\nJournal of Pediatric Psychology vol. 35 no. 10 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Pediatric Psychology 2010.\nanalysis (LCA) approach to explore how different types of\nvictimization were related. Specifically, they included six\ndichotomous items measuring physical, verbal and rumor\ntypes of peer victimization. Based on their observed re-\nsponses, the adolescents were classified into three ordered\nlatent classes, including a ``victimized class,'' a ``sometimes\nvictimized class,'' and a ``nonvictimized class.'' Their study\nsuggested the existence of a group who may be the targets\nof multiple types of bullying. Even though this study was\nlimited in their inclusion of traditional forms of victimiza-\ntion only, as well as their use of a local middle school\nsample, it demonstrated promise for using a LCA approach\nto study the co-occurrence of various types of\nvictimization.\nWith the increasing popularity in use of internet and\ncell phones among children and adolescents, cyber bully-\ning has emerged as a new type of victimization. Recent\nstudies have demonstrated that being a traditional victim\nincreases the risk of cyber victimization (Li, 2007;\nto the potential existence of a distinct group that is the\ntarget of both traditional and cyber bullying. However, as\nmost of the studies analyzing the association between tra-\nditional and cyber victimization quantified traditional vic-\ntimization using a global measure, it remains unclear how\ncyber victimization and specific types of traditional victim-\nization are associated and might co-occur in the same\nperson. One possible reason for the lack of research ad-\ndressing this question is that common statistical\napproaches assessing relations between categorical vari-\nables (e.g., chi-square statistics) are restricted to including\ntwo to three variables only. To address this gap in research,\nthe first purpose of our study was to examine the\nco-occurrence of victimization from four main types of tra-\nditional bullying (physical, verbal, social exclusion, and\nspreading rumors) and from cyber bullying through a\nseries of LCA models. LCA is a person-based latent variable\napproach in which latent classes can be identified based on\nparticipants' observed response to multiple categorical or\ncontinuous variables. A previous study has shown the ad-\nvantages to use LCA models to explore relationships\namong involvement in several subtypes of victimization\n(Nylund, Nishina et al., 2007). For instance, it is a\nmodel based on probabilities, so the model can be repli-\ncated with an independent sample. The current study ex-\ntends previous studies by examining cyber victimization\nand most common types of traditional victimization in a\nnationally representative sample.\nNumerous studies suggest that victimization may\noccur among certain groups of adolescents more than\nothers depending on gender, grade, and race/ethnicity.\nFor instance, male adolescents are more likely than\nfemale adolescents to experience physical and verbal vic-\ntimization, whereas female adolescents are more likely to\nexperience relational victimization (Bjorkqvist, 1994;\nTortolero, & Markham, 2006). Previous research indicates\nthat the prevalence of victimization decreases with age\n(Carlyle & Steinman, 2007), and may be lower in African\nAmericans and Hispanics (Juvonen, Graham, & Schuster,\nHaynie, 2007). Given potential variations by gender,\ngrade, and race/ethnicity, the second purpose of our\nstudy was to identify the targets of multiple types of vic-\ntimization based on adolescents' demographic\ncharacteristics.\nPrevious studies have consistently suggested that ex-\nperience with peer victimization increases the risk of a va-\nriety of adverse physical and psychological outcomes\n(Menesini et al., 2009). However, it is not known if victim-\nization from multiple types of bullying would place adoles-\ncents at even greater risk for adverse health outcomes. In\ntheir latent class analysis, Nylund and colleagues (Nylund,\nNishina et al., 2007) presented depression scores across\nthe three latent classes and found that the classification of\nLCA was superior in terms of predictive validity compared\nto other methods such as using cutoffs on the composite\nraw scores. To validate the latent classification obtained in\nthe current study, four health-related outcomes were com-\npared across the extracted latent classes, including depres-\nsion, medically attended injuries, and medicine use for\nsleeplessness and nervousness.\nThe present study applied a series of LCA models with\nthree main purposes: (a) to examine the co-occurrence of\nfive subtypes of victimization, including cyber victimization\nand four traditional types of victimization; (b) to explore\ndemographic characteristics across the latent classes; and\n(c) to compare physical and psychological outcomes across\nthe latent classes.\nMethods\nParticipants and Procedure\nData were obtained from the Health Behavior in\nin the United States. The U.S. HBSC is conducted in col-\nlaboration with the World Health Organization\ncross-national study (Currie, Nic Gabhainn, Godeau, &\nInternational HBSC Network Coordinating Committee,\n2009), which collects information about adolescents'\nhealth behaviors and their social contexts. The U.S.\nsample was selected through a complex survey design,\nincluding stratification (i.e., census regions and grades as\nstrata), clustering (i.e., school districts as primary sampling\nunits), and weighting (i.e., controlling for nonresponse and\noversampling of African American and Hispanic minority\ngroups). The software used for the current study, Mplus\n\u00b4n & Muthe\nsampling design in the analyses by its complex survey\ndata features, including stratification, clustering, and un-\nequal probabilities of selection.\nData were collected through anonymous self-report\nquestionnaires distributed in the classroom, with a student\nresponse rate of 85%. Youth assent and parental consent\nwere obtained as required by the participating school dis-\ntricts. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by\nthe Institutional Review Board of the Eunice Kennedy\nShriver National Institute of Child Health and Human\nDevelopment.\nMeasures\nDemographic Variables\nDemographic variables included gender, grade (6 though\n10), and race/ethnicity (Caucasian, African-American,\nHispanic, and other).\nPeer Victimization\nExperience of victimization was measured by the victim\nitems from the Revised Olweus Bully/Victim\nQuestionnaire (Olweus, 1996). The reliability and validity\nof this questionnaire have been demonstrated in previous\nstudies and the items used in the present study were de-\nscribed in detail elsewhere (Olweus, 1996; Solberg &\nOlweus, 2003). The participants were asked how often\nthey were bullied in the past couple of months. Physical\nvictimization was measured by one item--``being hit,\nkicked, pushed, shoved around, or locked indoors.''\nVerbal victimization was measured by three items--\n``being called mean names, made fun of, or teased in a\nhurtful way;'' ``being called mean names and comments\nabout race or color;'' and ``being called mean names and\ncomments about religion.'' Victimization through socially\nexclusion was measured by one item--``being left out of\nthings on purpose, excluded from their group of friends, or\ncompletely ignored.'' Victimization by rumor spreading\nwas measured with one item--``being the target of other\nstudents' lies or false rumors.'' Cyber victimization was\nmeasured by two items--``being bullied by others using\ncomputers, e-mail messages, and pictures'' and ``being bul-\nlied by others using cell phones.'' Response options were\n``I have not been bullied in this way in the past couple of\nmonths,'' ``only once or twice,'' ``2 or 3 times a month,''\n``about once a week,'' and ``several times a week.'' Based\non these items, five dichotomous victimization variables\n(physical, verbal, social exclusion, rumor spreading, and\ncyber victimization) were created with two categories for\neach variable: involved and noninvolved with uninvolved\nindicating ``never'' in the last couple of months. These five\nvariables were included in the LCA models.\nDepression\nSix items were used to measure depressive feelings and\nbehaviors, which were previously validated with this age\ngroup (Dahlberg, Toal, Swahn, & Behrens, 2005;\nOrpinas, 1993). Participants were asked how often in the\npast 30 days they: (a) were very sad; (b) were grouchy or\nirritable, or in a bad mood; (c) felt hopeless about the\nfuture; (d) felt like not eating or eating more than usual;\n(e) slept a lot more or a lot less than usual; and (f) had\ndifficulty concentrating on their school work. Responses\nwere coded one to five: ``never,'' ``seldom,'' ``sometimes,''\n``often,'' and ``always.'' This scale showed desirable reli-\nability (Cronbach's a \u00bc .80). The mean of items was used\nwith a higher score indicating higher level of depressive\ntendencies.\nMedically Attended Injuries\nStudents were asked how many times during the last\n12 months they had been injured and had to be treated\nby a doctor or nurse. Responses options were coded 1\u00ad5:\n``I was not injured in the past 12 months,'' ``1 time,''\n``2 times,'' ``3 times,'' and ``4 times or more.''\nMedicine Use for Sleeping Problems and for\nNervousness\nStudents in grades 7\u00ad10 were asked about their medicine\nuse during the past month for (a) difficulties in getting to\nsleep, and (b) nervousness. The response options were\n``no,'' ``yes, once,'' and ``yes, several times.'' The each\nitem was dichotomized into yes and no, and percentage\nof ``yes'' was compared across latent classes.\nStatistical Analysis\nA series of latent class models were used and all analyses\nwere conducted using Mplus version 5 (Muthe\n\u00b4n &\nMuthe\n\u00b4n, 1998). The first step was to choose the optimal\nnumber of classes by specifying separate LCA models with\nvarious numbers of classes. Model solutions on choosing\nthe appropriate number of classes were evaluated based on\na comparison between several statistical criteria, including\nAkaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information\ncriterion (BIC), sample-size-adjusted Bayesian information\ncriterion (ABIC), bivariate residuals (i.e., residuals >1.96),\nand entropy. Suggested by a recent simulation study, we\ngave the most weight to the BIC as it may provide the most\nreliable indicator of true number of classes (Nylund,\nAsparouhov, & Muthe\nwere different classes or different number of classes ex-\ntracted from male and female populations, the analyses\nwere initially conducted separately by gender. After the\noptimal number of classes was chosen, grade, gender,\nand race/ethnicity were included as covariates. With class\nmembership as outcome and demographic variables as in-\ndicators, the model is analogous to a logistic regression or\nmultinomial logistic regression model. In the same model\nof LCA with covariates, the AUXILIARY option with the\ne-setting was used to test the equality of the means of\nthe four outcome variables across classes (Muthe\n\u00b4n &\nMuthe\n\u00b4n, 1998). The posterior probability-based multiple\nimputations were used to conduct paired mean compari-\nsons. For binary variables such as the two medicine\nuse variables, proportions were computed and compared\nacross latent classes. As the medicine use variables\nwere only included in the survey for grades 7 through\n10, youth in grade 6 were treated as missing in these\ncomparisons.\nResults\nSample Characteristic\nAmong the 7,508 adolescents who completed the survey\nwith the victimization items, 33 were excluded due to\nmissing information on demographic variables, resulting\nin an analytic sample of 7,475. The sample consisted of\nAfrican-Americans, and 26.4% Hispanic Americans.\nThe mean age of the sample was 14.2 years, with a SD\nDescriptive Statistics: Prevalence Rates and\nCo-occurrence of Any Two Forms of\nVictimization\nThe prevalence rates of involvement in the five types of\ncyber form. Among the victims of each type, the percent-\nages of involvement in other types of victimization are re-\nported in Table I. The descriptive statistics of\nco-occurrence of traditional and cyber victimization\nshowed that among victims of traditional bullying (i.e., if\none was bullied by at least one type of traditional bullying),\n17.8% also reported experience with cyber victimization\nvictims, 95.1% were also traditional victims (male:\nLatent Classes Indicating Patterns of\nVictimization Bullying Forms\nLCAs were conducted on the five victimization variables\nwith two, three and four classes specified. The model fit\nstatistics are reported in Table II, which includes AIC, BIC,\nABIC, number of significant bivariate residuals, and entro-\npy. The best fitting models, as indicated by the BIC, were\nthe three-class models, both for all individuals and for sub-\ngroup analyses by gender. Other criteria such as ABIC and\nentropy values for the three-class models were also\nacceptable.\nThe prevalence of each class and the item probabilities\nfor the three-class models are shown in Figure 1. For each\nclass, the item probability indicates the probability of an\nindividual being victimized by the specific bullying behav-\nior. The following three classes were extracted: Class 1:\nall-types victims--a class of individuals with high probabil-\nities of being victimized by the four traditional bullying\nbehaviors and a moderately high probability of being\nvictimized by cyber bullying; Class 2: verbal/relational\nvictims--a class of individuals with a moderately\nhigh probability of verbal, social exclusion, and rumor\nspreading type of victimization and relatively low probabil-\nities of physical and cyber victimization; and Class 3:\nNon-victims--a class of individuals with minimal probabil-\nities of being victimized by any bullying behavior.\nFigure 1 shows that the overall pattern of involvement\nin the five types of victimization was same across gender in\neach latent class. For both genders, the three latent classes\nwere ordered classes (Nylund, Asparouhov et al., 2007), in\nthat the probabilities for all of the items were highest for\nClass 1, followed by Class 2 and Class 3. The group of\nall-types victims, i.e., Class 1, were more likely to be targets\nof all five bullying behaviors, including verbal/relational,\nthan the Class 2 verbal/relational victims, while the Class\n1 group had the lowest probability across all bullying\nbehaviors.\nDemographic Characteristics of Each Latent\nClass\nThe results of the 3-class LCA with demographic covariates\nare reported in Table III, with model fit statistics reported\nin Table II. In the model for all individuals, covariates in-\ncluded gender (male as referent), grade (grade 10 as refer-\nent), and race/ethnicity (Caucasian as referent). In the\nmodel for males and females separately, covariates includ-\ned grade and race/ethnicity. As there were a total of three\nclasses, the model was analogous to a multinomial logistic\nregression of latent classes on demographic variables. Class\n3, the category of non-victims, was set as the reference\ngroup.\nGender\nCompared to females, males were more likely to be\nall-types victims (Class 1). There was a trend for higher\nproportion of Class 2 compared to Class 3 among females,\nbut the gender difference only approached significance\nGrade\nCompared to adolescents in grade 10, students in grade\n6 through 8 were more likely to be in Class 1 than Class 3.\nSimilar results were found for males and females except\nthat the difference between 10th and 9th grade was also\nsignificant in males. There was no grade difference in\nClass 2 between grade 10 and any other grade for all\nindividuals. However, gender differences were found\nwhen males and females were analyzed separately.\nSpecifically, males in grade 6 though 8 and females in\ngrade 6 were more likely to be in Class 2 compared to\nRace/Ethnicity\nNo racial/ethnic differences were found with the only ex-\nception that Hispanic adolescents were less likely to be in\nClass 2 compared to Class 3 when males and females were\nanalyzed together.\nHealth-related Outcomes\nThe means of the four health outcome variables for the\nthree latent classes are plotted in Figure 2. For each vari-\nable, three mean or percentage paired comparisons were\nconducted: the comparison of nonvictims (Class 3) with\nverbal/relational victims (Class 2); comparison of\nnon-victims (Class 3) with all-types victims (Class 1); and\ncomparison of verbal/relational victims (Class 2) with\nall-types victims (Class 1).\nDepression\nFor both males and females, all three paired mean compar-\nisons showed strong evidence of significant differences in\nTable I.

Furthermore, the comparison between\nfemale verbal/relational victims and female nonvictims\nalso lead to significant difference.\nMedicine Use for Nervousness\nSimilar results were found for medicine use for nervous-\nness. All three comparisons showed significant differences\nexcept for the comparison of verbal/relational victims and\nnon-victims for males.\nDiscussion\nThe current study is the first study to examine the\nco-occurrence of five subtypes of victimization, including\ncyber victimization and four traditional victimization sub-\ntypes in a nationally representative sample of US adoles-\ncents. We found that different types of victimization do\nco-occur among certain individuals and these patterns\ncould be best described by a three-class model, with one\nclass of adolescents who were targets of all five bullying\nbehaviors (Class 1), another class who were marked by\nverbal/relational victimization (Class 2), and a final class\nthat had minimal experience of any victimization (Class 3).\nThe demographic characteristics of each latent class were\ndescribed accordingly. As a validation of the classification,\nlevel of depression, frequency of medically attended inju-\nries, medicine use for sleeping problems, and medicine use\nfor nervousness were compared across the three latent clas-\nses. In general, the all-types victims reported higher depres-\nsion, more injuries, and more medicine use for sleeping\nproblems and nervousness than the verbal/relational vic-\ntims, followed by the nonvictims.\nClass 1 adolescents were more likely to be victimized\nby all five bullying behaviors, thus they can be considered\nas ``all-types victims.'' The proportion of Class 1 was 9.7%\nfor males and 6.2% for females. Further results of LCA with\ndemographic covariates showed that males were more\nlikely to be all-types victims than females.

For both\ngenders, the overall age trend was a decrease from grade\n6 to 10, which was consistent with previous studies\n(Carlyle & Steinman, 2007). No racial/ethnic differences\nwere found in involvement of victimization in Class 1.\nClass 2 adolescents had moderately high probability of\nbeing victimized by verbal, social exclusion or rumor\nspreading types of behaviors and low probability of phys-\nical or cyber victimization, thus they can be considered as\n``verbal/relational victims.'' When males and females were\nwere classified as verbal/relational victims. Compared to\n10th-grade males, males in grades 6, 7, and 8 had a\nhigher relative proportion of Class 2 than Class 3 males.\nAmong females, on the other hand, only females in grade 6\nhad a significantly higher relative proportion of Class 2 to\nClass 3 females compared to females in grade 10. Only one\nracial/ethnic difference was found in involvement of vic-\ntimization in Class 2 where Hispanics were less likely than\nCaucasians to be verbal/relational victims.\nResults of paired comparisons on four physical and\npsychological outcomes were consistent with previous\nstudies showing that experience with victimization was as-\nsociated with higher level of depression, increased injuries\nMenesini et al., 2009). More important, our results suggest\nthat the more types of victimization the adolescents expe-\nrienced, the poorer physical and psychological distress they\nmay demonstrate, especially for girls (Figure 2). For both\ngenders, there was strong evidence that the all-types vic-\ntims reported higher depression than the verbal/relational\nvictims, followed by the nonvictims. Strikingly, 24.1% of\nall-types male victims and 30.0% of all-types female victims\nreported using medicines for sleeping problems, which was\nmuch higher than the other two latent classes. Similar re-\nsults were also found for medicine use for nervousness.\nThese results suggest the severe effects of experiencing vic-\ntimization from multiple types of bullying.\nThe classification observed suggest three patterns of\nrelationship with regard to cyber victimization and the\nfour types of traditional victimization. First, involvement\nin any two different types of victimization are correlated,\ngiven the existence of Class 1, a group that is the target of\nall types of bullying behaviors. Second, the associations\namong verbal and relational types of victimization are\nFigure 2. Comparisons on health-related outcomes across class. Note. Class 1, all-types victims; Class 2, verbal/relational victims; Class 3, nonvic-\ntims; categories with different letters in the superscript were significantly different at a of .05.\nhighly correlated, given the high or moderately high item\nprobabilities for verbal and relational victimization in both\nClass 1 and Class 2. As verbal victimization (measured by\nname calling in the current study), social exclusion and\nrumor spreading types of victimization are not mutually\nexclusive, the results suggest that many verbal types of\nbullying such as being called names and teased may be\nexperienced by victims who are socially excluded from a\ngroup. Third, our results suggest that if a student is vic-\ntimized by physical or cyber bullying (either in Class 1 or\nClass 2), it is very likely that s/he is also victimized by\nverbal and relational bullying. However, a student may ex-\nperience verbal and relational bullying without being sub-\njected to physical or cyber bullying.\nIt is important to note several limitations in this study.\nFirst, due to the cross-sectional nature of the survey, we\ncannot make causal inferences on the associations between\nthe classification of the three groups and the health-related\noutcomes. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine in-\nvolvement in latent classes over time and to determine the\ntemporal sequence of the classification and their correlates.\nSecond, we assessed injuries due to all causes, not speci-\nfically bullying; future studies should differentiate the\ncauses of injuries. Finally, we only examined latent classes\nof victimization in the current study. Left unanswered is\nwhether there are groups of individuals (latent classes) that\ndifferentially participate in particular types of both bullying\nperpetration and victimization and, if so, the characteristics\nof individuals in these groups. Future studies should ex-\namine the co-occurrence of different types of bullying per-\npetration and victimization.\nThe three-class results of the LCA models found in this\nstudy provides a different but complimentary view to that\nobtained by Nylund, Asparouhov et al. (2007), which iden-\ntified a victimized class, a sometimes victimized class and a\nnonvictimized class based on physical, verbal and rumor\ntypes of victimization. The current study contributes to the\nliterature and extends previous studies in at least four\nways. First, we examined the co-occurrence of victimiza-\ntion in five different types, including four main types of\ntraditional victimization, and a relatively new form, i.e.,\ncyber victimization. Second, we used a large-scale nation-\nally representative sample with sufficient representation\nfrom multiple age and racial/ethnic groups. The sample\nallowed us to analyze demographic variability in extracted\nlatent classes and plot the proportion of each class by de-\nmographic characteristics. Third, the LCA analytical strat-\negy applied in the current study is a person-centered\nanalysis, which is well suitable for examining patterns of\nrelations among involvement in a set of behaviors. Fourth,\nwe compared a variety of physical and psychological\noutcomes across the latent classes. The result of graded\nassociation demonstrates the predictive validity of the clas-\nsification in the current study.\nConclusions\nDifferent types of bullying victimization appear to co-occur\namong US adolescents. The patterns of involvement in vic-\ntimization can be best represented by a three-class model,\nwith one class of all-types victims, a class of verbal/rela-\ntional victims, and a class of non-victims. Victimization\nfrom all types of bullying (Class 1) was more common in\nyounger and male adolescents and decreased with age in\nboth males and females. Developmental patterns for vic-\ntimization from verbal/relational bullying (Class 2) differed\nacross gender and there was only marginal significance for\ngender differences. Given the positive association between\ninvolvement in types of victimization and physical and psy-\nchological problems, intervention efforts should address\nvarious symptoms among victims of bullying and especially\nthose who suffer from multiple types of victimization.\nFunding\nThe US HBSC was supported by the Intramural Research\nProgram of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of\nChild Health and Human Development, and the Maternal\nand Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and\nServices Administration with the second author (R.J.I.) as\nprincipal investigator.\nConflict of interest: None declared.\nReferences\nBjorkqvist, K.
