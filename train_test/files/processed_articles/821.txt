However, limited data exist documenting its reliability and validity. The KPS is used in the\nNational Hospice Study (NHS) as both a study eligibility criterion and an outcome measure. As part\nof intensive training, interviewers were instructed in and tested on guidelines for determining the KPS\nlevels of patients. After 4 months of field experience, interviewers were again tested based on narrative\npatient descriptions. The interraterreliability of 47 NHS interviewerswas found to be 0.97. The construct\nvalidity of the KPS was analyzed, and the K P S was found to be strongly related (P < 0.001) to two\nother independent measures of patient functioning. Finally, the relationship of the KPS to longevity (r\n= 0.30) in a population of terminal cancer patients documents its predictive validity. These findings\nsuggest the utility of the KPS as a valuable research tool when employed by trained observers.\nFto complement medical information to characterize\nthe impact of disease on the patient.

At this initial contact, the interviewer spends\napproximately 1 hour with the patient and the patient's\nfamily, gathering information on pain, symptoms, sat-\nisfactionwith care,satisfactionwith life,and servicesbeing\nutilized. During this period, the interviewer has the o p\nportunity to observe the patient's subtle dependencies\nand interactions within the existing support networks to\namve at a KPS assessment based on that single visit.\nAdditional selected functional assessment information is\ngathered either independently by hospice clinical staff at\nthe time of the patient's admission or from the patient's\nfamily at the initial contact. The interviewer continues\nto visit the patient and the patient's family regularlyuntil\nthe patient's death.\nTraining\nThe NHS interviewers were selected primarily on the\nbasis of their prior interviewing and research experience.\nConsideration was also given to their familiarity with\nmedical and insurance/billing terminology. There were\n9 nurses among the 47 interviewers; the remaining 81%\nhad very limited clinical experience in a medical setting.\nPrior to the training period, as a general background\nthe interviewerswere asked to become familiar with ter-\nminology contained in a medical glossarywhich had been\nprepared by NHS staff. Formal training began with an\norientation to the basic principles of cancer biology,\nsymptoms, epidemiology, and therapy. Led by a clinical\noncologistand an oncologic nurse, this 3-hourorientation\nincluded practical exercises in which the interviewers\ndemonstrated their ability to abstract selected items of\ninformation from the medical records of terminal cancer\npatients.\nFollowing this orientation, the interviewers took part\nin a 2-hour trainingsessionconductedby the sameclinical\nteam. The KPS index used by the NHS interviewers is\nshown in Table I. Operational specifications were de-\nveloped to provide objective guidelines for nonclinical\nstaff in the use of this judgement rating scale. The goal\nof the training was to enable interviewers to rate and\ncompare patient profiles at subtly different performance\nlevels,generalizingthis experienceto include all types of\npatients.\nFollowingtheir introduction to the overall rating pro-\ncess,interviewerswere tested with aseriesof brief narrative\ndescriptions of patients and their respective KPS scores\nuntil there was thorough agreement on the basis for each\nparticular rating.\nResults\nReliability\nAs noted above, although the Kps is widely used by\nclinicians,recent evidencesuggeststhat ratings frequently\nare not comparable.\" In research applications, however,\nraters using the KPS have been found to achieve at least\na moderate level of interrater agreement.I I Reliability re-\nfers to the extent to which objects (patients) can be cat-\negorized,scored, or ordered in the same way by different\nTABLE\n2.

To test whether consensus among interviewers\nwas achieved,a written quiz similar to that given during\nthe trainingprocess was administeredto interviewersafter\n4 months of field work. Forty-seven interviewers were\nasked to rate 17 narrative examples of patients at widely\nvaryingKPS levels.The results of this quiz were analyzed\nto determine interrater reliability. Interviewers' ratings\nwerecompared usingCronbach'scoefficientalpha, which\ntreatsjudges asitemsin a scaleand the narrative scenarios\nas observations. This approach was supplemented by a\nvariant of the intraclasscorrelationsuggestedby Winer.\n'*\nBoth approaches yielded interrater reliability coefficients\ntically significant beyond the 0.001 probability level.\nConstruct Validity\nThe KPS is a complex, syntheticmeasure of a patient's\nactivity levels. It isa multidimensionalconstruct reduced\nto a unidimensional scale. One of the reasons for the\npopularity of the KPS is precisely its concise approach\nto classifyingand ranking patients whose individualclin-\nical status is far more complicated. By comparing the\nKPS with other discrete observable variables which con-\nceptually or theoretically tap the same measurement do-\nmain, its construct validity can be e~a1uated.l~\nIn the NHS, a series of independent physical func-\ntioning measures is available with which to test the con-\nstruct validity of the Karnofsky Performance Index. At\nthe time of intake, hospice staff complete a series of de-\ntailed functional assessments on the subjects based on\nthe general model of the Katz ADL Index.14The patient's\nprimary care person completes an overall physical QL\n(quality of life) assessment at the initial and each sub-\nsequent interview contact. While the three sets of as-\nsessments are not identical in content or intent, they do\nmeasure facetsof the same underlyingphenomenon, pa-\ntient performance.Consequently,there shouldbe a strong\nrelationship between these other two sets of functional\nmeasures and the KPS. The descriptors of the various\nKPS levels suggest not only a physical performance di-\nmension but also medical care needs. Symptompresence\nand extent of disease,therefore, should conceptually cor-\nrelate with the KPS. Data regarding the presence and\nseverity of symptoms, including pain, are obtained from\nthe patient during the initial interview. The patient's\nmedical record was used to record the locationand num-\nber of metastases.\nThe performance level for activities of daily living for\npatients at different KPS scoresis shown in Table 2. The\nchi-square tests for all categoriesindicatethat differences\nin performance level for each KPS score are significant\nfpatients able to func-\ntion independentlyincreasingas the patients'KPS scores\nincrease. As the KPS scores decrease, the proportion of\npatientsunable to perform these activitieswith or without\nassistance increasesdrastically, indicating a severely dis-\nabled population at a KPS of <30.\nA severity index was constructed from the functional\nvariables listed in Table 2. For each variable, a score of\n0 was assigned if the patient could perform the activity\nindependently,a scoreof 1 was assigned if assistancewas\nnecessary, and a 2 was assigned if the patient was unable\nto perform the activity. The scores range from 0 (most\nfunctional)to 14 (least functional) and have been distri-\nbutionallycategorized.Table 3 presents the severityindex\nforpatientsat eachKPSlevel.Thechi-squaretestindicates\nsignificantdifferences among categories(P-=0.001) and\na very strongrelationshipbetween increasingKPS scores\nand higher functional status (contingency coefficient\n= 0.49). Over 50% of the cases in the two worst KPS\nlevelsare in the worst severitycategory,while 40% of the\npatients with a KPS of 50 are in the \"most functional\"\nseverity category.\nThe relationship between the KPS and the physical\nQL is given in Table 4. There are significantdifferences\nPERFORMANCE\nSTATUS\nSCALE\n- Mor e\n(P< 0.001)between the KPS levels in the proportion of\npersons with low physical QL values-the lower the KPS\nvalues, the higher the proportion of persons with poor\nphysical QL. The relationships between these two mea-\nsures are very strong, as can be seen by the Kendall'stau\nstatistic(0.35).Thus, both the interviewerand the patient's\nprimary care person (usually the spouse or a child) tend\nto rate the patients similarly with respect to the physical\ndimensions of performance status.\nIn addition to these functional variables, the degree of\npain reported by patients at various Kps scoreswas mea-\nsured using a modified version of Melzack's pain ques-\nti~nnaire.'~\nNo significant relationship to the patient's\nKPS rating was found. Similarly,there was no significant\nrelationship between the KPS score and other physical\nsymptoms reported by the patients. Although not sig-\nnificant, shortnessof breath showeda strongerrelationship\nto performance status than either nausea, dry mouth,\nconstipation, dizziness, or fever. Patients' experience of\npain and symptoms should logically limit their ability\nand willingness to perform normal daily activities. How-\never, for the extremely debilitated terminal patients rep\nresented in this sample, symptoms are not a relevant\nfactor in reduced performance status. The absence of\npatients in the upper ranges of the KPS may detract from\nwhat would othenvise be a positive association between\nreported symptoms and KPS in a population of patients\nwith metastatic disease. Additionally, over 30% of the\n500 patients in the sample able to respond to the pain\nquestion reported experiencingno pain at all. While most\npatients reported at least one of the six symptoms, the\nnumber of reported symptoms was also not related to\nKPS. Clearly, for this sample of patients, reduced KPS\nis not attributable to the experienceof the more common\nsymptoms associated with cancer patients. The low KPS\nis apparently associated with a systemic disease which\nhas reduced the patient's vitality.\nPrimary cancer site as well asthe location and number\nof metastaticsiteswas ascertained from patients'medical\nrecords. None of these factorswas significantlyrelated to\nthe KPS score. Lung and brain metastatic involvement,\nwhich logically should have the greatest debilitatingeffect\non functioning, were only moderately associated with a\nlower KPS. This pattern of findings suggeststhat disease\ncharacteristicscan vary substantiallyamong personswith\nthe same KPS. At earlier stages in the advance of met-\nastatic disease, the location of the metastases and the\nnumber of metastatic sites might be associated with the\nrate of decline in KPS.\nPredictive Validity\nSince impairment among cancer patients suggestssys-\ntemic breakdown attributable to pathophysiologic and\nTABLE\n3. Severity Index by Karnofsky Performance Status\nKarnofsky Performance Status (7%)\nSeverity\n.\n.\npsychological causes(notwithstandingother complicating\nfactors),the more impaired the cancer patient, the more\nadvanced the systemic involvement and consequently,\nthe closer the patient is to death. Thus the KPS, as a\nmeasure of the degree of impairment, should be able to\npredict the length of survival of terminal cancer patients.\nAn analysis of variance (ANOVA) with KPS as the\nindependent variable and survival in days as the depen-\ndent variable was performed. The results presented in\nTable 5 show a direct monotonic relationship between\nKPSand survivalwhich issignificantat beyond the 0.00I\nprobabilitylevel. Nine percent of the variance in survival\nis accounted for by the KPS as seen by the \"eta squared\"\nwhich is comparable to the standard R2emerging from\nregression analyses. However, as can be seen from the\nstandard deviation in longevityassociatedwith each Kps\nlevel, there is considerable overlap in the longevity dis-\ntributionsof the variousKPSlevels.The median longevity\nassociatedwith each KPS level (uniformly lowerthan the\naverage) suggests very skewed distributions.\nTABLE\n4.

The purpose of\nthisanalysiswas to furtherexaminethe predictivequalities\nof the KPS. Confirming the ANOVA approach, a zero\norder correlation of 0.30 was obtained, signifyingan R2\nEach increase in one KPS level, e.g., 20 to 30, yields an\nincreaseof approximately 15daysof survival.Regression\nanalysesalso revealthat a higher proportion of prediction\nerrors (standardized residuals greater than\noccur among patients with KPS levels of 40 and above;\nover 6%of caseswith KPSscoresof 40 or 50were \"errors,\"\nwhereas only 4% of KPS level 30 and 2% of KPS level\n20 were errors. Furthermore, significant errors of pre-\ndiction were uniformly in the direction of longer lives.\nThis is largely a function of the skewed longevity distri-\nbution for this sample seen in the median being lower\nthan the mean.\nIn view of these findings,a categoric form of longevity\nwas constructed. The proportion of \"short-lived\" and\n\"long-lived\" patients at each KPS level was examined.\nThree longevitygroups were created: (1) 18days or less;\nare presented in Table 6. As can be seen, the majority\ndays of hospice admission, while most (70.4%) of those\nTABLE\n6.

Kendall's\ntau associated with this table is 0.30, which is significant\nbeyond the 0.001 level. Interestingly, the proportion of\npatients at each KPS level found in the mid-range lon-\ngevity group is fairly comparable.\nThese analyses substantiate the predictive validity of\nthe KPS when applied to a sample of terminal cancer\npatients. While the relationship is highly significant, its\npredictive accuracy and therefore case-specific clinical\napplicability is limited. Clearly, however, the lower KPS\nlevels are much more likely to be \"death-imminent.\"\nDiscussion\nThe wide use of the KPS among physicians and par-\nticularly oncologists suggests it is a meaningful measure\nof a patient's functional status. However, for this or any\nsimilarmeasureto be meaningful,it isessentialthat those\nusing it be systematically trained to assure a common\nperspective.The training module designedforthe current\nevaluation could be readily adapted by other researchers\nand by cliniciansworking in a practiceor researchsetting.\nOur finding of high levels of interrater reliability among\nnoncliniciansfollowingexposureto training attests to the\nfeasibility of using the KPS in systematicresearch efforts.\nThe functional variables adapted from Katz ADL In-\ndex14and used to test the construct validity of the KPS\nare objective and quantifiable. Thus, the strong relation-\nship between these variables and the KPS as shown in\nTable 2 suggests that although the KPS is a subjective\nrating, it is based on objective factors. The strong rela-\ntionship obtained between the KPS and a single item\nphysical QL judgement made by patients' primary care\npersonsindicatesthe consistencywith which the construct\nof performance status can be measured. This construct\nvalidity, therefore, supports the view that the KPS is a\nreliable measure of functional status.\nPerhaps most important is the findingthat the KPS is\na predictor of length of survival in terminally ill cancer\npatients. The predictive relationship that emerged, while\naccounting for only 9% of the variation in longevity, is\nconsistent with other researchers' efforts to predict lon-\ngevity in chronically ill and aged population^.^^-^' The\nmore limited relationship to survival reported by Yates\nand associates\" was presumably due to greater hetero-\ngeneity in his sample. By limiting the sample to patients\nwith confirmed metastaticdiseasewith an acknowledgedly\npoor outcome, the relationshipbetween performance sta-\ntus and longevity becomes apparent. However, even in\nthis population, the predictive accuracy attained is in-\nsufficientto guide clinical practice and decision-making.\nPerhapsthe most effectiveuse ofthe KPSwhen reliably\nappliedisasa stratifyingmeasurein research, particularly\nin clinical trials in which patient survival constitutes an\nPERFORMANCE\nSTATUS\noutcome of interest or is related to other outcomes of\ninterest. In view of the strong relationship between KPS\nand survival, even randomized clinical trials could gain\nconsiderable power by using the KPS asa study eligibility\ncriterion and as a stratifying variable during analyses. On\nthe basis of the high short-term mortality among patients\nin the lowest KPS groups, it might be reasonable to ex-\nclude them from studies requiring some minimal exposure\ntime. The widespread use,ease ofmeasurement, and gen-\neral acceptance of the measure make the KPSa reasonable\ncandidate as a stratifying variable as long as the reliability\nof the raters is assured.\nFuture investigations into the predictors of survival\ntime among terminal cancer patients will explore other\nfactors, i.e.,concurrent disabling diseases, prior treatment\npatterns, etc., that, together with the KPS,can refine such\npredictions.\nREFERENCES\nI.
