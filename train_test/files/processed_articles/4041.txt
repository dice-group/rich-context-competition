We\nhypothesized that Ang-(1\u00ad7) could inhibit sympathetic nerve remodeling in a canine model of chronic atrial tachycardia.\nMaterials and methods: Eighteen dogs were randomly assigned to sham group, pacing group and Ang-(1\u00ad7) group. Rapid\natrial pacing was maintained for 14 days in the pacing and Ang-(1\u00ad7) groups. Ang-(1\u00ad7) was administered intravenously\nin the Ang-(1\u00ad7) group. The atrial effective refractory period and atrial fibrillation inducibility level were measured at\nbaseline and under sympathetic nerve stimulation after 14 days of measurement. The atrial sympathetic nerves labeled\nwith tyrosine hydroxylase were detected using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, and tyrosine hydroxylase\nand nerve growth factor mRNA levels were measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\nResults: Pacing shortened the atrial effective refractory period and increased the atrial fibrillation inducibility level\nat baseline and under sympathetic nerve stimulation. Ang-(1\u00ad7) treatment attenuated the shortening of the atrial\neffective refractory period and the increase in the atrial fibrillation inducibility level. Immunohistochemistry and Western\nblotting showed sympathetic nerve hyperinnervation in the pacing group, while Ang-(1\u00ad7) attenuated sympathetic nerve\nproliferation. Ang-(1\u00ad7) alleviated the pacing-induced increases in tyrosine hydroxylase and nerve growth factor mRNA\nexpression levels.\nConclusion: Ang-(1\u00ad7) can attenuate pacing-induced atrial sympathetic hyperinnervation.\n",

The pur-\npose of this study was to investigate whether Ang-(1\u00ad7)\nAngiotensin-(1\u00ad7) attenuates atrial\ntachycardia-induced sympathetic\nnerve remodeling\nWenfeng Shangguan, Wen Shi, Guangping Li,\nYuanyuan Wang, Jian Li and Xuewen Wang\n Keywords\nAngiotensin-(1\u00ad7), chronic atrial pacing, sympathetic nerve remodeling, atrial fibrillation, tyrosine hydroxylase\nTianjin Key Laboratory of Ionic-Molecular Function of Cardiovascular\nDisease, Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Institute of Cardiology,\nSecond Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, China\nCorresponding author:\nXuewen Wang, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Ionic-Molecular Function of\nCardiovascular Disease, Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Institute\nof Cardiology, Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nhad a protective effect on sympathetic nerve remodeling in\nchronic atrial tachycardia in dogs. We labeled the sympa-\nthetic nerve with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as previously\nMaterials and methods\nPreparation of the canine model\nAll animal studies were approved by the experimental ani-\nmal administration committee of Tianjin Medical\nUniversity and Tianjin Municipal Commission for\nExperimental Animal Control. Eighteen mongrel dogs of\neither sex weighing between 12 and 14 kg were included\nin this study. All dogs were anesthetized with intravenous\npentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg) and ventilated with room\nair. Under sterile conditions, a modified unipolar J-shaped\npacing lead (St. Jude Medical) was inserted through the\nright jugular vein and the distal end of the lead was posi-\ntioned in the right atrium, as described in a previous\nstudy.14 Initial atrial capture was verified using an external\nstimulator (ALC-V8, Shanghai Alcott Biotech CO. LTD,\nand China). The proximal end of the pacing lead was then\nconnected to a programmable pacemaker (made in\nShanghai Fudan University, China), which was inserted\ninto a subcutaneous pocket in the neck. The dogs in the\npacing and Ang-(1\u00ad7) groups were paced at 500 beats/min\nfor a period of 14 days. The dogs in the sham group\nreceived a pacemaker implant but did not undergo pacing.\nDuring the pacing, Ang-(1\u00ad7) (6 g/kg per h) (Bachem\nAG, Bubendorf, Switzerland) was given intravenously\nthrough a jugular vein catheter by an ALZET\u00ae osmotic\npump (DURECT Corporation, Cupertino, CA, USA) con-\ntinuously during pacing for 14 days. The surface electro-\ncardiogram was verified to ensure continuous 1:1 atrial\ncapture every other day. Direct systolic blood pressure was\nmeasured during anesthesia before and after 14 days' pac-\ning by a multichannel physiological recorder (TOP 2001,\nHongtong Inc., China).\nTwo weeks after the pacemaker implant, all dogs were\nintubated and mechanically ventilated with room air.\nUnder sterile conditions, a median sternotomy was per-\nformed. Six pairs of electrodes (diameter: 1.5 mm; dis-\ntance between poles: 1.5 mm) were stitched onto the left\nand right atrial epicardia. The corresponding sites were in\nthe high left atrium, low left atrium, and left atrial\nappendage (HLA, LLA, and LAA, respectively), and in\nthe same sites of the right atrium (HRA, LRA, and RAA,\nrespectively).\nMeasurement of atrial effective refractory\nperiod and atrial fibrillation inducibility\nThe atrial effective refractory period (AERP) at each site\nwas measured by programmed pacing from the\nmulti-channel electrophysiology recorder (TOP 2001,\nHongtong Inc., China). There were eight sequential stimuli\n(S1-S1, cycle length 250 ms) followed by one premature\nstimulus (S2) with a doubling pacing threshold. The S1\u00adS2\ninterval progressively decreased by 10 ms and, subse-\nquently, 2 ms near the refractory value to ensure accurate\nrecording. AERPs were the longest coupling interval that\nfailed to capture the atrium.\nAtrial fibrillation was defined as P-wave disappearance\nand rapid atrial activation with irregular ventricular\nresponse and a duration of more than 1 s. Atrial fibrillation\nwas induced at the above six atrial sites with a 5-s continu-\nous burst stimulation, at 10 Hz with four thresholds and\n0.5-ms duration pulses. The burst stimulation was repeated\nthree times at each site and was recorded whenever atrial\nfibrillation was successfully induced. If the atrial fibrilla-\ntion duration time was longer than 60 s, rapid atrial pacing\nor electrical conversion was used to reverse atrial fibrilla-\ntion to sinus rhythm, since a prolonged period of atrial\nfibrillation may induce transient atrial remodeling, pro-\nvoke longer episodes of atrial fibrillation and affect subse-\nquent measurements.\nAfter basic electrophysiological examination, the\nAERPs and atrial fibrillation inducibility level were meas-\nured under sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS). The\nbilateral stellate ganglia were carefully isolated from the\nsurrounding tissue. Two insulated bipolar electrodes were\nattached to the dorsal and ventral ansae of both stellate\nganglia, which were then stimulated continuously with\npulses of 5 V for a duration of 0.5 ms and a frequency of\n10 Hz. The stimulus intensity was adjusted by the heart\nrate (HR), such that a HR increase of at least 30% was\nmaintained when compared with the basal sinus rhythm\nrate throughout the measurement of AERPs and atrial\nfibrillation inducibility level.\nImmunohistochemistry study\nAfter completing the electrophysiological measurement,\nthe left atrial (LA) and right atrial (RA) tissues were imme-\ndiately cut off and washed with cold 0.9% sodium chlo-\nride, while part of the tissue was fixed in formaldehyde\nand used in immunohistochemistry studies. The remaining\ntissue was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored sep-\narately at -80\u00b0C for molecular biological studies.\nImmunohistochemistry was performed to examine the\ndensity and distribution of the sympathetic nerves\n(TH-positive) in the atria. Five-micrometer (\u00b5m) sections\nwere cut from paraffin blocks of the LA and RA free walls,\nwhich were then stained with TH to label the sympathetic\nnerves. In brief, six sections from the LA and the RA were\nused to analyze the sympathetic nerve density per canine.\nWe determined the fibrosis area using a computer-assisted\nimage analysis system (Image-Pro Plus 7.0, Media\nCybernetics, USA). The labels of all slides were covered,\nShangguan et al. 3\nso that the investigator who counted the nerves was blinded\nto the dog identification at the time of the nerve count.\nEach slide was examined under a microscope, and six\nfields with the highest density of sympathetic nerves were\nselected by the investigator. The computer automatically\ndetected the stained nerves in these fields by their brown\ncolor, and automatically calculated the area occupied by\nthe nerves in the field. The nerve density was the nerve-\npositive stained area divided by the total area examined\n(\u00b5m2/mm2). The mean nerve density in these six selected\nfields was used to represent the nerve density of that slide.\nWestern blotting\nLA and RA tissues from each group were prepared for\nWestern blotting analysis. Protein was extracted with total\nprotein extraction buffer. An equal amount of protein was\nloaded onto a 6% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) denatur-\ning polyacrylamide gel, separated by electrophoresis,\ntransferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane\n(Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and incubated\nwith a specific primary antibody at 4\u00b0C overnight. The\nmembranes were then washed and subsequently incubated\nwith the secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish\nperoxidase. Proteins were visualized using enhanced\nchemiluminescence. Protein levels of TH were expressed\nas a ratio against the levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate\ndehydrogenase (GAPDH). Antibody to TH (ab93291) was\npurchased from Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, UK) and anti-\nrabbit IgG HRP conjugate (W4011) was purchased from\nPromega, Inc. (Madison, USA).\nReverse transcription polymerase chain reaction\nOne aliquot of each tissue sample was used to investigate\nthe mRNA expression of TH and nerve growth factor\n(NGF). In brief, 100 mg of tissue was homogenized in 1 ml\nof TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). RNA was then\nextracted with chloroform, precipitated in isopropyl alco-\nhol and subsequently dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-\ntreated water. The integrity of each sample was confirmed\nby analysis on a denaturing agarose gel. The concentration\nof total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically at a\nwavelength of 260 nm, and the RNA was stored at -80\u00b0C\nfor later analysis. Specific oligonucleotide primer pairs\nused for the amplification of GAPDH, TH and NGF were\ndesigned according to the sequences obtained from\nGeneBank. The primers specific (forward/reverse) for\neach protein were: 5-GGCGTGAACCATGAGAAG TAT-\n(NGF). A 200 ng quantity of total RNA was converted to\ncDNA and subjected to reverse transcription polymerase\nchain reaction (RT-PCR) using a commercially available\nkit (TaKaRa, China). PCR was performed using the SYBR-\nGreenPCRkitasdescribedbythemanufacturer(TransGen,\nBeijing, China). The PCR consisted of 44 cycles of 95\u00b0C\nmRNA expression levels were normalized to the GAPDH\ngene according to the 2-Ct method. All the PCR experi-\nments were carried out in triplicate within each experi-\nment, and the experiments were replicated at least three\ntimes.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical compari-\nsons among groups were performed with one-way analy-\nses of variance (ANOVA). Subsequently, if significant\neffects were indicated by ANOVA, all significant data\nwere analyzed with a t-test to evaluate the differences\nbetween individual mean values. The inducible rate of\natrial fibrillation was analyzed with the exact probability\ntest. A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nHR and blood pressure\nThere was no significant difference in HR and systolic\nblood pressure between the three groups at baseline\n(p>0.05), and the HR and systolic blood pressure were not\nchanged by atrial pacing in any of the groups (p>0.05;\nTwo weeks of chronic atrial pacing markedly shortened\nthe AERPs in the pacing group compared with the sham\ngroup (p<0.05).

Our find-\nings are consistent with those of previous studies that dem-\nonstrated that cardiac sympathetic innervation plays a\ncritical role in the dynamics of atrial fibrillation initiation\nand maintenance.10 The catecholamines released by the\nproliferation sympathetic nerve endings were found to\nincrease the heterogeneity of the AERPs and elevate the\natrial fibrillation inducibility level.18,19 Sympathetic\nhyperinnervation in the pulmonary vein provides a sub-\nstrate for the trigger of rapid focal sources, thereby induc-\ning some atrial fibrillation episodes.20 Heterogeneous\nsympathetic innervation also facilitates sustained atrial\nfibrillation.8 These findings indicate that sympathetic\nhyperinnervation may play an important role in the genera-\ntion and maintenance of atrial fibrillation.\nRAS-induced atrial sympathetic\nhyperinnervation\nThe RAS is widely distributed in the sympathetic nerve sys-\ntem and throughout the central nervous system, the periph-\neral nerve ganglia and even sympathetic nerve endings.21\u00ad26\nActivation of the RAS can directly affect the brain and sym-\npathetic nerve ganglia, thereby increasing sympathetic out-\nflow and causing excessive sympathoexcitation.27\u00ad29 NGF is\nthe main factor that stimulates the growth of sympathetic\nnerves,30 and the RAS stimulates the synthesis of NGF,31\nthereby promoting the growth of sympathetic nerves and\nresulting in sympathetic nerve hyperinnervation. In the pre-\nsent study, significantly increased NGF mRNA expression\nlevels were observed. During atrial fibrillation, the RAS\nhas been shown to increase the mechanical stretch of atrial\nmyocardial cells, resulting in the increased growth of\nsympathetic neurocytes.32 Thus, the RAS plays an important\nrole in the pathogenesis of sympathetic nerve sprouting and\nhyperinnervation.\nAng-(1\u00ad7) attenuates sympathetic nerve\nremodeling\nAng-(1\u00ad7) inhibits the RAS and attenuates sympathetic\nnerve remodeling. Gironacci et al.33 demonstrated that\nAng-(1\u00ad7) significantly decreased potassium-induced\nnorepinephrine release in the hypothalamus by stimulat-\ning the Ang II receptor. Moreover, Ang-(1\u00ad7) was\nreported to inhibit the evoked release of norepinephrine\nfrom the hypothalamus.34 Byku35 also showed that Ang-\n(1\u00ad7) modulates sympathetic neurotransmitter overflow\nin a manner that might oppose the effects of Ang II on\nsympathetic neurotransmission. Ang II receptor blockers\nhave been shown to inhibit the RAS and abolish the\nstretch-induced increase in NGF expression, thereby pre-\nventing stretch-induced neural growth.36 Furthermore,\nAng-(1\u00ad7) might abolish stretch-induced NGF expres-\nsion and inhibit sympathetic nerve growth by counterbal-\nancing the effects of Ang II. In the present study, we\nfound that Ang-(1\u00ad7) inhibits the activity of the sympa-\nthetic nerves and attenuates both SNS-induced shorten-\ning of the AERPs and the increased atrial fibrillation\ninducibility level.\nOur study showed, for the first time, that Ang-(1\u00ad7)\ncould significantly attenuate atrial sympathetic hyperin-\nnervation in a chronic atrial paced canine atrial fibrillation\nmodel.

Unfortunately, we were unable to\nobtain specific canine NGF antibodies that could be used\nto measure the changes in NGF protein expression levels.\nConclusion\nAng-(1\u00ad7) significantly attenuated atrial sympathetic\nhyperinnervation in a chronic atrial pacing-induced canine\natrial fibrillation model. These results might help to eluci-\ndate the relationship between the RAS and atrial\nfibrillation.\n"
