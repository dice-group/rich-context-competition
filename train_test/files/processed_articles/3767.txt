However,\nit has been shown that elementary school chairs in Indonesia are too heavy for children aged 6 to 9 to easily lift and carry.\nThe present study aimed to investigate children's methods of carrying chairs as well as lifting and turning them onto desks.\nthe study. The experiment used three elementary school chairs (one Indonesian, two Japanese) and two desk types (standard\nand tall). The most popular method for carrying a chair was to carry it in front of the body with the chair in a lateral position\n(75%). In all carrying methods, participants showed a preference for grasping two particular points to hold the chair. Children\nlifted and turned chairs most successfully when they used this popular grasping pattern. The carrying method and the popular\ngrasping pattern for carrying, lifting, and turning chairs need to be considered when redesigning heavy Indonesian elementary\nschool chairs to improve the ease of transport without decreasing the weight.\n",

This requires students to\nbe active in class, such as by speaking, observing, performing\ntasks, and collaborating with friends. Classroom layouts\nshould be arranged appropriately based on the teaching pur-\nWannarka & Ruhl, 2008), and it can significantly affect\nimprovements in the learning process as well as learning out-\nKimonen & Nevalainen, 2005; Pardjono, Groves, & Gough,\nWeltman & Whiteside, 2010). For example, students will\nmore actively ask questions within a row and column arrange-\nment, and to improve social interaction among students, fur-\nniture should be arranged in a semicircle (Marx et al., 1999).\nAs in the active learning principle, students should be active\nmentally and physically to construct knowledge (Dewey,\nhaving children arrange furniture themselves may encourage\nthe learning process. Therefore, to encourage furniture\narrangement by children for active learning purposes, furni-\nture should be easy for them to transport, which also would\nreduce the time required to arrange the classroom layout.\nHowever, not all elementary schools in the world, espe-\ncially in developing countries, have adapted accordingly.\nOur previous study (Purwaningrum et al., 2015) found that\nchairs in Indonesian elementary schools were too heavy for\nchildren aged 6 to 9 to easily carry and lift. In that study, it\ntook significantly longer for children to complete a carrying\ntask with the Indonesian chair (weight: 5.0 kg) than with the\ntwo Japanese chairs (weight: 3.2 kg and 3.9 kg).

In lifting and turning chairs onto standard and tall\ndesks, the Indonesian chair had a lower success rate (around\n20%); with 6-year-olds showing especially low success rates.\nThus, according to (Purwaningrum et al., 2015), the weight\nof Indonesian elementary school chairs was not appropriate\nfor children of a certain age, and decreasing the weight of\nchairs was therefore recommended to encourage dynamic\nclassroom activities.\nIn developed countries, decreasing chair weight to accom-\nmodate children using light, strong, and durable materials\nand constructions through a qualified manufacturer might be\nrather easy to execute. In developing countries such as\nIndonesia, however, there are problems with manufacturing.\nA simple solution for developing countries might be to pro-\nduce two types of elementary school chairs--one for ages 6\nto 9 and another for ages 10 to 12. However, school furniture\nproducers that use conventional woodworking will face pro-\nduction obstacles, such as difficulties establishing standard-\nized manufacturing processes with strong quality controls\nand effective management. Moreover, it will require increas-\ning the price of furniture that is too expensive for developing\ncountries. Therefore, if developing countries produce chairs\nusing the same product used in developed countries but in\nlower price, they might be frail.\nFocusing on how elementary school children as a user\ncarry, lift, and turn chairs in common class activities can pro-\nvide alternative strategies for modifying Indonesian elemen-\ntary school chairs without decreasing their weight. Due to\nindividual differences in age, physique, knowledge, and so\non, children use various carrying methods to complete the\nsame tasks. Previous studies have focused on the effects of\ncarrying methods on anterior load carrying capability. It was\nfound that carrying a load at hand height had better carrying\ncapacity than carrying at elbow height (Mital & Okolie,\nmethods could indicate that it might be easier for children to\nperform tasks using their preferred methods.\nThus, the second factor (after weight) in investigating\nIndonesian elementary school chairs is the parts of chair\nmost popularly used for grasping. Some parts of these chairs\nare too thick for children to grasp. Moreover, there are sharp\ncorners, making them unsafe. The shapes of these chairs sug-\ngest they were not designed to be easily moved. Without\nimprovements, such poorly designed chairs can create haz-\nardous situations and possibly result in injuries. Thus, in\nredesigning chairs without decreasing their weight for\nimproved ease of transport, parts popularly used for grasping\nshould be suitably shaped to facilitate effective methods of\nlifting, carrying, and turning.\nTo obtain useful basic data for redesigning Indonesian\nelementary school chairs to be easily carried, lifted, and\nturned by children aged 6 to 9, this study investigated the\nmethods children aged 6 to 9 used to carry chairs, and to lift\nand turn them onto desks. First, we examined chair-carrying\nmethods, including direction and sequence. Second, we\ninvestigated which parts of chairs were most commonly\ngrasped while performing tasks.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe participants were 42 right-handed children (aged 6-9),\nJapanese (12 boys and 13 girls). The mean \u00b1 standard devi-\nations (SD) for the anthropometric data of all participants\nAs Indonesia is the main target of this study, Indonesian\nchildren were involved in the experiment. This study also\ninvolved children and chair of Japanese nationality as a com-\nparison. Generally, given user that using the product in daily\nlife are familiar, and perform better. Japanese children use\ntheir furniture, and Indonesian children use their furniture.\nTherefore, including both Japanese and Indonesian children\nin this study are fair to avoid a bias.\nHowever, the sex of Indonesian and Japanese children in\nthis study was mixed up as previous studies about the designs\nof elementary school furniture regarded that sex is not a fac-\ntor that determines the dimensions of school furniture\nFurthermore, the Japanese and Indonesian children were\nmixed up according to the anthropological database of\nJapanese and Indonesians (Ministry of Education, 2014;\nMinistry of Internal Affairs and Communications Statistics\nBureau of Japan, 2013; Purwaningrum, Aryani, Mulyadi, &\nYassierlie, 2011; Rosyidi, Susmartini, Purwaningrum, &\nMuraki, 2014), which showed that the heights and weights of\nchildren aged 6 to 9 are similar.\nThe ethics committee of the Faculty of Design, Kyushu\nUniversity, Japan, approved the experiment of this study\n(Approval Number: 125), and participants' parents signed\ninformed consent forms before the study.\nExperimental Instruments\nChairs.To compare the effects of three dimensions and\nweight conditions on the carrying, lifting, and turning a chair\nmethod, this experiment examined two Japanese (Chairs A\nand B) and one Indonesian (Chair C) elementary school chair.\nrespectively. The dimensions of Chairs A and B were appro-\npriate for children aged 6 to 9 (International Organization for\nPurwaningrum et al. 3\nchair (Chair C) was produced in Indonesia; it was made\nentirely of wood with a seat height of 420 mm, a width of 385\nmm, a depth of 385 mm, and a weight of 5.0 kg. This chair\ntype is widely used in Indonesia's public elementary schools\nweight of Chair C fell within the lowest weight range based\non a pilot survey of 11 public elementary schools in Indonesia\n(Rosyidi et al., 2014). The dimension of the chair was the\nsame as the dimension of the chairs generally used that are\nsame for all grade in Indonesian elementary schools (Purwan-\nDesks. In this study, desks were only used in the experiment\nfor lifting and turning chairs. Two desk height conditions\nwere used. The first was a Japanese elementary school desk\nwas the same as the first, but a box was placed under the desk\nfor additional height (100 mm). The new height simulated\nthe average typical height of Indonesian elementary school\net al., 2014). As the study compared the effects of height dif-\nferences between Indonesian and Japanese desks on lifting\nand turning chairs, this simulation was sufficient for the task.\nExperimental Tasks, Conditions, and Procedures\nTwo tasks--(a) carrying a chair and (b) lifting and turning a\nchair onto a desk--were performed in an appropriate experi-\nmental space. First, participants were briefed on the proce-\ndures for completing each task. They could say \"stop\" to\nmove on to the next task if they felt the present task was too\ndifficult or impossible to finish. Moreover, a stop instruction\nwould be issued immediately if it appeared to the researcher\nthat it would be impossible or dangerous to continue the task.\nFor safety, participants wore nonslip work gloves and shoes,\nand an adult guard stood beside the participants. To prevent\ninjury, fear, and so on, and allow participants to easily judge\nwhether they could perform the next task, tasks were\nsequenced from lighter (smaller) to heavier (larger) furni-\nture. After each task, the participant's condition was checked\n(e.g., indications of pain, fatigue, lack of motivation, etc.) to\ndetermine whether he or she should continue to the next task.\nIn the task of carrying a chair, each chair (A, B, and C)\nwas brought from the start to finish line. The distance\nbetween lines was 3 m. First, participants sat on the chair\nwhich was placed sideways behind the start line. Second,\nafter start command, participants stood up and carried the\nchair toward the finish line. Finally, the chair was put down\non the floor beyond the finish line. In this task, some proce-\ndures must be followed by participants: (a) any part of the\nchair could be hold; (b) the chair should not push or slide on\nthe floor; (c) walking speed during the task should be at an\nordinary.\nIn the task of lifting and turning a chair, each chair (A, B,\nand C) was turned upside down and put on two desk heights\nBefore start command, the participant sat on the chair that\nwas placed in front of the desk. Then, the participant stood\nup from the chair, turned the chair upside down, and put it on\ntop of the desk after the start command. In this task, any part\nof the chair could be held. The chair could be rotated on the\nfloor if it is necessary.\nMeasurement\nEach participant's movement was recorded by a digital\nframes per second. To record tasks in detail, the camera\nwas operated freely by hand (i.e., not mounted, as on a\ntripod), following participants' movements step by step,\nsuch as their methods for carrying chairs and their grasp-\ning positions on the chairs.\nGrasping parts of the chairs.Before conducting the experi-\nments, 18 parts of the chairs were coded A-R as the possible\npoints that might be grasped by participants (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Codes for the chair parts.\n4 SAGE Open\nCriteria for success in lifting and turning chairs. Success criteria\nwere established before performing the experiment involv-\ning lifting and turning chairs onto desks. The task was judged\nsuccessful if the participant executed it smoothly, that is if\nthey could complete lifting and turning the chair without\ndropping the chair or stopping, and if there were no indica-\ntions of danger. Danger was indicated if the grasp was unsta-\nble, that is, grasping the chair so that it tended to fall to the\nfloor. The task was judged unsuccessful if the participant\nfailed to smoothly lift and turn the chair onto the desk.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe SPSS statistical package (IBM SPSS version 21.0 for\nWindows, Chicago, USA) was used to analyze the data.\ncalculated to analyze the effects of chair type on the suc-\ncess rate.\nResults\nCarrying Chairs\nThe methods for carrying chairs were categorized based on\nthe chair's direction, its orientation, and how many hands the\nchild used. Figure 2 shows the four carrying methods.\nCarrying Method 1: The chair was carried in front of the\nchild's body with two hands on two parts of the chair, and\nthe chair's orientation was lateral.\nCarrying Method 2: The chair was carried in front of the\nchild's body with two hands on two parts of the chair, and\nthe chair's direction was either forward or backward.\nCarrying Method 3: The chair was carried in front of the\nchild's body with one hand in one position.\nCarrying Method 4: The chair was carried in front or at\nthe side of the child's body with two hands on one part of\nthe chair.\nDuring the task of carrying a chair, an inconsistent proce-\ndure was shown by one participant. To obtain a reliable find-\ning, even though he could complete the task, his result was\nomitted in the analysis. Thus, the number of participants in\nthe carrying a chair task became 41. Figure 3 shows the per-\ncentages of carrying methods used by participants for each\nchair type in the experiment. Even though the dimension and\nthe weight of three chair types, and design between Japanese\nand Indonesian chair were different, the percentages of each\ncarrying method for all chair types were similar. Method 1\nexact chi-square test indicated there was no significant effect\nof chair type on carrying method.\nThe participants employed various grasping patterns,\nusing one or two hands to grasp certain parts of the chairs.\nTable 1 shows nine grasping patterns used by participants:AJ,\nBJ, DJ, GJ, HI, OO, BB, O, and B. AJ, for example, means\nthe chair was grasped by two hands with the right or left hand\non Part A and the other hand on Part J. In Patterns B and O,\nthe chair was grasped using only the left or right hand.\nFigure 2. Four methods for carrying chairs.\nFigure 3. Percentages of carrying methods used for all chair\ntypes.\nTable 1. Frequency of Each Carrying Method and Grasping\nPattern by Chair Type.\nMethod of carrying\nthe chair\nGrasping\npattern\nFrequency for each chair type\nChair A Chair B Chair C\nPurwaningrum et al. 5\nEach carrying method had specific grasping patterns. For\nexample, Method 1 showed patterns AJ, BJ, DJ, and GJ;\nMethod 2 showed patterns HI and OO; Method 3 showed\npatterns BB and O; and Method 4 showed patterns B and\nOO. Pattern OO, observed in Methods 2 and 4, was a special\ncase. Using Figure 2, those conditions could be illustrated:\nMethod 1 indicates grasping pattern AJ; Method 2 indicates\ngrasping pattern HI; Method 3 indicates grasping pattern O;\nMethod 4 indicates grasping pattern OO. Table 2 shows the\npercentages of grasping patterns used for each chair type.\nParts J, A, and B showed a higher frequency than the other\nparts. Meanwhile, Parts C, E, F, K, L, M, and N were not\nused by any participants.\nLifting and Turning Chairs Onto Desks\nPopular grasping patterns. Participants lifted and turned chairs\nonto desks using various grasping patterns on different parts\nof the chairs. They completed the task in steps using different\ngrasping patterns. Grasping patterns were categorized\naccording to the child's first step in grasping the chair. Forty\nsecond-step grasping patterns were identified for all chairs\nand desks. Participants primarily used seven grasping pat-\nterns, with AJ/JA and BJ/BA as the most popular. The 33\nother patterns were less popular. Table 3 shows the distribu-\ntion of the popular grasping patterns.\nPopular grasping patterns and success rates.Figure 4 shows\neffect of chair type and popular/unpopular grasping patterns\non success rates for lifting and turning three types of chairs\nonto standard and tall desks. For both desk types, the popular\ngrasping patterns had higher success rates than the unpopular\nones with each chair type (Figure 4). The success rates for\nboth popular and unpopular grasping patterns decreased\ngradually from Chairs A to C with both desks. The highest\nsuccess rate (90%) was achieved with Chair A and the stan-\ndard desk. The lowest success rates, or unpopular grasping\npatterns, occurred with Chair C with the tall (12%) and stan-\nFigure 5 shows effect of popular/unpopular grasping pat-\ntern on success rates for lifting and turning all chair types\nwith both standard and tall desks. The exact chi-square test\nshowed a significant effect of popular and unpopular patterns\non success rate among chair types at taller desk (p < .05) but\nnot at standard desks. Interestingly, for both standard and\ntaller desks, the popular pattern had a higher success rate\nthan the unpopular patterns, with taller desk with tall desks\nand 50%, respectively).\nThe most popular of first-step grasping patterns (AJ/JA\nand BJ/BA) were followed by the second-step grasping pat-\nterns. The most popular of them were NL/LN and MK/KM.\nAs NL/LN and MK/KM are the same (left and right of the\nchair's feet), they were categorized into the same group\n(Table 4).\nDiscussion\nCarrying Chairs\nThis study considered how children carry chairs to redesign\nthem for easier transport. Carrying Method 1 (Figure 2), in\nwhich the chair was carried in a lateral orientation in front of\nthe child's body with two hands on two parts of the chair,\nwas the most popular. Understanding how humans use a\nproduct is an important factor in product development (Green\n2002). The preferred carrying method in this study was sup-\nported by previous research showing that a user's pleasur-\nable feelings in choosing a product or tool correlate to\npsychological rather than physical or usability factors (\nJordan, 2002). Furthermore, in the material-handling field,\nJordan (2002) and Kuijt-Evers, Twisk, Groenesteijn, De\nLooze, and Vink (2005) found that an object's appearance\naffected comfort and preference during handling. In the pres-\nent study, the shape (appearance) of the chair led children to\nuse carrying Method 1. This was because the position of the\nhands on the chair tended to balance and stabilize the direc-\ntion of the chair mass so that it seemed easy and comfortable.\nFuture research should investigate whether Method 1 is\nindeed the easiest and safest way for children to carry chairs.\nThis study showed that chair-carrying methods involved the\nchild's preference for grasping certain parts of the chair. The\nmost popular grasping patterns in M 1 were AJ and BJ (Table\n1)--that is, PartsAand B on the top and bottom of the chair's\nTable 2. Grasping Frequency of Each Part for All Chair Types.\nPart\ncode\nFrequency\n(percentage)\nPart\ncode\nFrequency\n(percentage)\nPart\ncode\nFrequency\n(percentage)\nTable 3.

The\nIndonesian chair's features were too large for the anthropom-\nRosyidi et al., 2014). Specifically, the distance between Parts\nA and B for the right hand and Part J for the left was too\nlarge. In addition, its heavy weight (Purwaningrum, Funatsu,\nXiong, Rosyidi, & Muraki, 2015) and sharp shape could\nincrease the difficulty of carrying it with a balanced posture\nand potentially cause injury. Therefore, to improve the ease\nof transporting Indonesian elementary school chairs without\ndecreasing their weight, the parts children prefer to grasp\nshould be considered.\nLifting and Turning Chairs\nThe results for lifting and turning chairs onto desks also pro-\nvide guidelines for redesigning chairs based on grasping pat-\nterns. The main considerations were the AJ/JA and BJ/JB\npatterns, which were used most often in the first step for each\ntype of chair and desk (Table 3; Figure 6). Furthermore, AJ/JA\nand BJ/JB had higher success rates than the less popular grasp-\ning patterns for each type of chair and desk (Figures 4 and 5).\nThus, AJ/JA and BJ/JB are the ideal grasping patterns for chil-\ndren to easily lift and turn both Indonesian and Japanese chairs.\nThe secondary considerations were the NL/LN and MN/\nNM patterns, which were used most often in the second step\nFigure 4. Success rates of popular and unpopular grasping patterns in lifting and turning three types of chairs onto standard and tall\ndesks.\nFigure 5. Success rates for popular and unpopular grasping patterns in lifting and turning the three types of chairs on standard and tall\ndesks.\nTable 4. Frequency of Popular Second-Step Grasping Patterns\nFollowing the Popular First-Step Patterns by Chair Type.\nGrasping pattern\nFrequency for three chairs on two desks\nStandard desk Tall desk\nChair A Chair B Chair C Chair A Chair B Chair C\nPurwaningrum et al. 7\nfollowing the most popular grasping patterns in the first step\n(Table 4, Figure 6). Further, NL/LN is equivalent to MK/\nKM, and MN/NM is equivalent to KL/LK. Therefore, pat-\nterns MK/KM, MN/NM, and KL/LK should be considered\nsecondarily after AJ/JA and BJ/JB to improve the ease of lift-\ning and turning chairs.\nThe popular patterns (AJ/JA, BJ/JB) nevertheless had\nlow success rates with Chair C and both desks (Figure 4),\nindicating that lifting and turning the Indonesian chair was\ndifficult. Meanwhile, the popular patterns' high success\nrates with Chair A showed that Japanese chairs could be eas-\nily lifted and turned. In addition, the exact chi-square test\nfound that the popular patterns' success rates were signifi-\ncantly higher than the unpopular ones only with the tall\nIndonesian desk. Therefore, grasping patterns must be con-\nsidered in redesigning Indonesian chairs to make the task of\nlifting and turning chairs onto tall Indonesian desks easier.\nThe results for both tasks (carrying and lifting/turning\nchairs) showed that Parts A, B, and J were used most by chil-\ndren. Those parts were designed more safely on the Japanese\nchair than the Indonesian chair. The rounded corners and\nproper sizes of the Japanese chair parts make it easy for chil-\ndren to grasp and carry the chairs. However, those parts are\ndangerous on Indonesian chairs, making them difficult for\nchildren to carry, lift, and turn. The parts are large, there is no\nconvenient place for children to grasp them, and the sharp cor-\nners could cause injuries. Moreover, the chair's dimensions\nare unsuitable for children, especially for children aged 6 to 8\nward shapes, weights, and dimensions could cause them to\ndrop the chair. Therefore, considering grasping patterns for\nredesigning chairs promotes safety in addition to easy lifting.\nConclusion\nThis study utilized how preference of user to carry, lift and\nturn a chair easily. The furniture which is easy to transport\nshould be provided due to the proper layout arrangement are\nrequired for a teaching purpose (Haghighi & Jusan, 2012;\ning to improve quality of education. The problem with\nIndonesian furniture was not only improper dimension\nweight was too heavy to transport for children, especially for\nobservation found a key point, and an alternative solution\nshould be considered for redesigning and modifying the heavy\nIndonesian elementary school chairs without decreasing their\nweight. Moreover, to decrease the weight of Indonesian school\nfurniture will face a manufacturing problem. To our knowl-\nedge, using grasping patterns as a criterion for designing ele-\nmentary school chairs for easy lifting and turning is new in this\nresearch area. The investigations in this area should factor in\ntwo aspects: the methods of carrying chairs and the most pop-\nular grasping patterns for carrying, lifting, and turning them. It\nwould be interesting for future investigations to evaluate the\neffectiveness of such modified Indonesian elementary school\nchairs so that encourage the active learning in a classroom.\n"
