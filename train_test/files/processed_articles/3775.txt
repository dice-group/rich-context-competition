    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe current study examined how first responders and the general population described the concept of resilience. Categories\nof resilience were coded a priori using Stemler's content analysis. For the general population, positive coping was the\nmost frequently occurring category followed by social support and adaptability. The next most frequently occurring terms\nwere societal resources and personal competence. Consistent with the general population, first responders described\nresilience most frequently with positive coping. Social support was the next most frequently occurring category, followed\nby personal competence, perseverance, emotional regulation, and physical fitness. Although both the general population and\nfirst responder participants highlighted the importance of having a support network, first responders suggested that dealing\nwith traumatic experiences was more of an individual process, and seeking professional help was not common practice.\nImplications for mental health professionals and future directions for research are offered.\n",

Resilience has been viewed as\nboth a process and an outcome (Zellars, Justice, & Beck,\n2011), and research linking resilience to a number of positive\npersonal outcomes, such as improved mental and physical\nhealth, increased longevity, and decreased heart disease\nBarrett, 2004) as well as professional outcomes (e.g.,\nimproved overall employee well-being, job satisfaction, and\njob performance; Avey, Luthans, Smith, & Palmer, 2010;\nLuthans, Avolio, Avey, & Norman, 2007; Luthans, Avolio,\nestablished the construct as an important area of study.\nOne particular occupation that has gained attention in the\nscholarly literature related to resilience is first responders\n(Kronenberg et al., 2008; Meadows, Shreffler, & Mullins-\nSweatt, 2011;).First responders, or professionals who deal\nwith emergencies, natural disasters, and other traumatic\nevents include police officers, firefighters, and emergency\nmedical technicians (EMTs) (Meadows et al., 2011). The\nnature of these events requires that professionals perform\ncritical tasks, which may affect mental and physical well-\nbeing. Along with the traumatic experiences that are inherent\nto the work, other stressors such as long and irregular shifts,\novernight hours, dangerous environments, and physical\ndemands contribute additional stressors (Meadows et al.,\n2011). Scholars have posited that some first responders\nstruggle with mental health concerns including depression\n(Benedek, Fullerton, & Ursano, 2007), posttraumatic stress\ndisorder (PTSD; Benedek et al., 2007), and alcoholism\nthe work. Physical health injuries that result from workplace\nresponsibilities can be an additional source of stress (Szubert\nGiven all this information, it seems clear that first respond-\ners have unique work stressors that might require them to\nseek support from professionals to cope with the demands\nthey are experiencing as a professional; however, research\nhas suggested that first responders struggle with seeking for-\nmal assistance for mental health concerns (Crowe, Glass,\n1East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nAllison Crowe, East Carolina University, 225 Ragsdale Hall, Mailstop 121,\nEmail: crowea@ecu.edu\nA Content Analysis of Psychological\nResilience Among First Responders\nand the General Population\nAllison Crowe1, J.

Waggy1\n Keywords\nfirst responders, psychological resilience, law enforcement, fire and rescue, coping\n2 SAGE Open\nIn fact, seeking formal help for a mental health concern is\ncounter to the nature of the first responder culture, as the job\nof a responder involves training in emotional and physical\ntoughness and control (Crowe et al., 2015; Royle, Keenan, &\nThus, scholars have started to explore how first respond-\ners stay resilient to cope and perform successfully. Although\nthere is an emergent body of literature on the topic of how\nfirst responders cope with job-related stress and remain resil-\nient, helping professionals, in particular, might benefit from\na deeper understanding of how first responders compare with\nthe general population in their definition of the concept of\nresilience and how they believe it affects their ability to\neffectively perform on the job. Such information can better\nassist mental health workers in preparing suitable approaches\naimed at helping first responders to effectively deal with the\ntraumatic experiences they encounter as a result of their\noccupational choice. This study was developed as a means to\nbetter inform helping professionals about first responder per-\nceptions of resilience, and how those perceptions affect this\npopulation.\nThe Current Study\nIn an effort to understand how first responders define and\nunderstand resilience as it affects them personally and pro-\nfessionally, the authors conducted a qualitative investigation\nof the perceptions of first responders related to the definition\nof resilience. They also investigated whether and how resil-\nience can be increased or decreased over time, as well as how\nthe concept relates to the work of first responders. This study\nallowed for in-depth responses from participants and a\ndeeper understanding of resilience and the first responder\npopulation. Certainly, the profession of first responders lends\nitself to experiences that shape resilience among this group,\nbecause it is well known that the job itself is uniquely ori-\nented to crisis, natural disasters, and dangerousness. Knowing\nhow this group of professionals define and understand resil-\nience, as compared with those in professions not as closely\nassociated with these factors, will add to the scholarly under-\nstanding of the concept of resilience. To the authors' knowl-\nedge, this research is the first of its kind to examine how\nthese two samples'perceptions of resilience might be similar\nor different.\nMethod\nThe authors conducted a total of four focus groups with\nmembers of two populations of interest, first responders and\nthe general population. Two group meetings were held with\nparticipants from law enforcement, emergency services, and\nfire departments. General population participants attended\ntwo groups that included university staff members from a\nuniversity located in the Southeastern United States. The\nfocus groups were primarily qualitative in nature, with the\nexception of a few questions regarding demographics and\nmental health history of each participant. Prior to participant\nrecruitment and data collection, the Institutional Review\nBoard of the authors' university approved the study\nParticipants\nFirst responders. A total of seven emergency personnel work-\ners participated in the first responder focus groups. There\nwere four men and three women. Participant age ranged\n8.72 years). Six participants reported being Caucasian and\none reported being African American. The majority of par-\nticipants reported being married (n = 6), with the one remain-\ning participant reporting being single, never married.\nParticipants reported having received either a 4-year (n = 4)\nor a 2-year (n = 3) college degree. Occupations included fire\nand rescue, paramedic firefighter, and police officer.\nThe majority of participants indicated that they had previ-\nously sought treatment for a mental health concern (n = 4),\nand all those same participants indicated that the treatment\nthey received was helpful. Reasons for seeking treatment\nincluded alcohol addiction, anxiety, life coaching, and post-\npartum depression. Three participants reported that a family\nmember had a mental illness, including addiction, anxiety,\nand depression. The majority of participants also indicated\nthat they would seek mental health treatment in the future\nshould they begin to suffer from any symptoms (n = 5).\nGeneral population.A total of 10 full-time employees at a\nsoutheastern university participated in the general population\nfocus groups. There were four men and six women. Partici-\npant age ranged from 27 to 65 years, with an average age of\nsian and one reported being African American. Exactly half\n(n = 5) were single, never married, with the other half (n = 5)\nreporting being currently married. Half the participants (n =\n5) indicated that they had received a master's degree, with\nthe remaining participants indicating that they had received\neither a 4-year (n = 2) or a 2-year (n = 3) college degree.\nOccupations included administrative assistant, archivist, lab\ncompliance coordinator, library technician, student affairs\nadministration, and maintenance technician, to name a few.\nParticipants also answered a few mental health history\nquestions on a mental health history form designed specifi-\ncally for this study. The majority of participants indicated\nthat they had previously sought treatment for a mental health\nconcern (n = 7), and all those same participants indicated that\nthe treatment they received was helpful. Reasons for seeking\ntreatment included anxiety, bipolar disorder, past trauma\nexperience, depression, family concerns, and relationship\nissues. The majority of the group also indicated that they had\na family member with a mental illness (n = 7). These family\nCrowe et al. 3\nillnesses included alcoholism, depression, anxiety, bipolar\ndisorder, dementia, and schizophrenia. The majority of par-\nticipants also indicated that they would seek mental health\ntreatment in the future should they begin to suffer from any\nsymptoms (n = 7).\nProcedures\nParticipants were recruited from an email listserv.\nParticipation was voluntary and no incentives were provided.\nThe authors conducted initial phone screenings to verify that\nall participants met the required criteria for inclusion.\nParticipants were asked whether they were at least 18 years\nof age and felt comfortable discussing attitudes toward men-\ntal health. Participants who answered yes to these questions\nwere eligible to participate. Focus groups were conducted in\na conference room located at a researcher's office building.\nAll participants completed an informed consent before par-\nticipating in the research. Next, each participant completed a\nshort demographic form and a mental health history ques-\ntionnaire prior to the start of discussion. Focus groups lasted\nanywhere from 60 to 90 min and all were directed by use of\na predesigned question script. Discussions were audio\nrecorded and later transcribed for ease of analysis.\nDemographic information included age, gender, ethnic back-\nground, relationship status, level of education, and current\noccupation. For mental health history, sample questions\nincluded, \"Have you ever sought treatment for a mental\nhealth concern?\" \"Was the treatment you received helpful?\"\n\"What did you seek treatment for?\" and \"Do you have some-\none in your family with a mental illness?\" First responders\nalso answered questions such as \"Can you describe the types\nof stressors that you face on the job?\" and \"What types of\nemergency situations have you dealt with in your job?\"\nFocus group discussion concentrated on psychological\nresilience. Topics covered included the definition of resil-\nience and what it means for a person to be resilient, where\nresilience originates, how and if it can be developed, and\nwhere resilience might be tested. Sample questions included,\n\"In your own words, what do you think it means for someone\nto be resilient?\" and \"What experiences or situations may\ncause someone to become less resilient?\"\nResults\nData Analysis\nKey study questions included (a) how first responders and the\ngeneral population define resilience, (b) how first responders\nand the general population understand innate and learned\nresilience, (c) how first responders and the general population\ndescribe life experiences that cause more or less resilience,\n(d) what first responders and the general population describe\nas protective and risk factors for resilience, (e) how first\nresponders believe the term applies to their profession, and (f)\nhow first responders describe the relationship between\nincreasing resilience and coping with stressful or traumatic\nevents.\nTranscribed versions of the focus group discussions were\nused to analyze the data. All statements made by participants\nduring the discussions were used as unique quotes. The\nauthors followed Stemler's (2001) content analysis proce-\ndures using an a priori coding strategy. Through this\napproach, the authors began with a preestablished set of cod-\ning categories that were based on previously published\nresearch and theoretical descriptions of resilience. The initial\nset of codes was revised following the preliminary rounds of\ndata analysis (Stemler, 2001). Three members of the research\nteam coded each statement as representative of one factor of\nresilience. These potential factors were based on an a priori\nreview of the literature regarding known factors of resilience.\nThis list was finalized following a pilot test round where all\nmembers of the research team coded a subset of data.\nThe following 10 factors were used to code the data: posi-\ntive coping (Meredith et al., 2011), optimism (conceptual-\nized from positive thinking and positive affect; Meredith\net al., 2011), social support (reflected in The Resilience Scale\nfor Adults; conceptualized from emotional ties, communica-\ntion, support, closeness, nurturing, and connectedness;\nMeredith et al., 2011; definition via Lin, Simeone, Ensel, &\npetence (Friborg, Hjemdal, Rosenvinge, & Martinussen,\nadaptability (Meredith et al., 2011), Perseverance (n.d.,\nMerriam-WebsterDictionary),societalresources(Donenfeld,\nWhen all three coders agreed on a factor, the agreed-upon\ncode became the final code. When only two coders agreed on\na factor, the final code was the one on which both agreed.\nStatements that resulted in disagreement between all three\nreviewers resulted in the statement being coded into the\n\"other/no code\" category. A total of 141 statements were\ncoded by each coder, resulting in a total of 423 coded state-\nments. The authors calculated the interrater reliability for\nthese coded statements, which resulted in an overall percent-\nage of agreement of 85.8% and a Fleiss' kappa statistic of\nResilience and general population results.Within the general\npopulation sample, 133 statements were coded according to\nresilience categories. The most common category of resil-\nience expressed by participants was positive coping. A total\nof 34 statements were coded in this category. This factor\nincluded active/pragmatic, problem-focused, and spiritual\napproaches to coping, and was defined by the researchers as\nthe process of managing taxing circumstances, expending\neffort to solve personal and interpersonal problems, and\nseeking help to reduce or tolerate stress or conflict (Meredith\net al., 2011). A statement that describes the concept of\n4 SAGE Open\npositive coping was as follows: \"Integrating or teaching the\nskills to people to integrate support structures helps to build\na stronger framework to assist in their resilience . . . from\nbetter nutrition to decreased stress, ways of coping with\nstress . . . .\" General population participants mentioned cop-\ning skills directly, as well as things that help individuals cope\nsuch as faith, pets, and other outlets. Positive coping was also\ndiscussed when participants were asked about being born\nresilient. One individual stated, \"I see it having a lot to do\nwith nurture. In some ways, you would be taught different\nways to cope and work through things.\"\nThe next most commonly occurring categories of resil-\nience were social support and adaptability.Atotal of 22 state-\nments were coded in each of these categories. Social support\nwas defined as support accessible to an individual through\nsocial ties to other individuals, groups, and the larger com-\nmunity (Lin et al., 1979). Participants commented on per-\nsonal experiences of social support including, \"I think that\nthere is a support network . . . you show them the resources\nthey have and then the next time they are able to do that on\ntheir own\" and \"a safety net . . . where parents or teachers or\nvery understanding bosses can create a context where . . .\nfailure can be used to give strength to push forward.\" These\nsocial support experiences were mainly discussed when par-\nticipants were asked about what causes people to become\nmore or less resilient over time.\nAdaptability, defined as positive adaptation to life\nchanges, was described in statements such as, \". . . you can\nbe restored to this previous position rather quickly\" and \". . .\nrestore oneself to a position of balance, whatever that bal-\nance was before the episode or incident.\" Finally, many par-\nticipants used the term flexible when describing resilience.\nThe term societal resources was the next most frequently\noccurring, with 13 statements coded as such. For the purposes\nof this research, the factor was defined as access to resources\nthat are out of the immediate control of the individual. Most\ndiscussion involving this factor was around a lack of societal\nresources, which subsequently placed strain on an individual\nand tested resilience. One participant stated, \"Resilience is\nrelated to the resources you have around you . . . and you wear\nthose resources out. Emotional, financial, whatever resources\nare worn out, you can't bounce back anymore.\" In addition,\nsocietal resources were attributed to risk factors of resilience,\nspecifically, \" . . . the lack of resources, or the lack of the abil-\nity to connect to resources . . . \" as well as protective factors\nsuch as, \"socioeconomic factors, like level of education, edu-\ncation attainment of parents, level of income in your house-\nhold . . . .\" Furthermore, affluence was seen as both a potential\nprotective and risk factor for resilience. One participant\nattested the following, \"higher income . . . my guess would be\nthat in general that leads to people dealing with trauma better\n. . .\" whereas another participant stated, \". . . if someone has\nbeen raised affluent . . . they've been coddled their whole life\n. . . they completely fall apart. They've been protected, they\nhave not actually had to deal . . . .\"\nEleven statements were coded as personal competence,\nwhich includes self-esteem, self-efficacy, self-liking, deter-\nmination and a realistic orientation to life (Friborg, Hjemdal,\nRosenvinge, & Martinussen, 2003). This factor was cited as\na characteristic of being resilient and most often associated\nwith being \"strong.\" For example, one participant stated that\ntrainees over time, if given tools and models and examples and\n(being) incrementally exposed to increasing amounts of stress . . .\nbegin to build confidence and see that what they once thought\nwere insurmountable obstacles can be overcome and actually\ncan be turned to a positive experience to build your inner\nstrengths and capabilities to better prepare you for future events.\nNine statements were coded as perseverance, defined as\ncontinued effort to do or achieve something despite difficul-\nties, failure, or opposition. Multiple participants discussed\nthe lack of this factor with regard to a cause for being less\nresilient. For example, \"You could be knocked down how\nmany times before you learn to stay down.\"\nSeven statements were coded in each of the following cat-\negories: optimism, emotional regulation, and physical fit-\nness. The researchers defined optimism as feeling\nenthusiastic, active, and alert, including positive emotions,\nhope, and flexibility about change. It also includes informa-\ntion processing through positive reframing, making sense out\nof a situation and refocusing with a positive outlook and\nexpectations. One participant discussed being born resilient\nin the following way: \"I'm thinking of some people that I\nknow who are very upbeat all the time and they seem to han-\ndle things pretty well.\"\nEmotional regulation includes attempts to influence the\ntypes of emotions experienced, and when and how they are\nexpressed and experienced. It may involve changes in the\nquality or intensity of emotional experiences, as well as the\nregulation or maintenance of affective experiences (Tugade\n& Fredrickson, 2004). For instance, one participant stated,\nI know people who are very emotionally stable, but who are very\npassionate about their work and it's just when something bad\nhappens, they don't flip out. They just go, okay, something bad\nhappened, I'm going to go and deal with it and get this out of the\nway and go on.\nThe researchers conceptualized physical fitness as a state\nof health and well-being including exercise, nutrition,\nhygiene, and rest (Meredith et al., 2011). It may include spe-\ncific abilities to perform aspects of an occupation (i.e., car-\ndiovascular fitness, flexibility, muscular endurance). This\nfactor was mentioned mainly in the context of helping build\nor diminish resilience. For example, with regard to making\none become less resilient, a participant mentioned that, \". . .\nillness in general. I think part of that is mental health as well.\nYou could become depressed and then have trouble, and you\nwouldn't be quite as resilient . . . .\" Another participant said,\n\". . . sleep deprivation and health can degrade your resilience\nCrowe et al. 5\nbecause it affects your ability to put things into that\nperspective.\"\nThe belongingness factor included only one statement.\nThis concept was defined as cohesion, friendships, group\nmembership, including participation in spiritual/faith-based\norganizations, ceremonies, social services, and schools\n(Meredith et al., 2011). This factor was discussed similarly to\na support group in a faith-based organization as follows:\nOur church has a group called grief share . . . (including) widows\nand widowers recently that are trying to cope with a very\ndifficult situation and there are people at different stages in that\nprocess, but by coming together not unlike many other support\ngroup situations, like situations with . . . people that have walked\nthat path before . . . .\nResilience and first responders results. For the sample of first\nresponders, a total of 82 statements were coded according to\nresilience categories. The largest portion of participants'\nstatements was categorized as positive coping. Specifically,\n16 statements were coded in this category. In general, this\nfactor represented the process of applying beneficial prac-\ntices, such as problem-focused coping (Meredith et al., 2011)\nto resolve feelings of stress or conflict. Furthermore, positive\ncoping was considered to be a process utilized by resilient\nindividuals. The following statement provided by one of the\nfirst responder participants illustrates the concept of positive\ncoping:\nIf a person is wanting to get better, they need to pick a certain\ntime in their life that just stands out in their mind where they\nwere either really happy or really successful at something and\nhave it as a positive motivator in their head. I can get back to\nthis, I can do this, I can get there.\nIn addition, first responder participants provided succinct\ndescriptors of positive coping such as \"avenues for relief\"\nand made statements such as \"humor is a huge one,\" when\nreferencing specific types of positive coping. Finally, when\nasked to describe what it means to be resilient, one partici-\npant noted positive coping's relationship with resilience by\nstating, \"the ability to cope with life's ups and downs . . .\nincluding the professional and personal life.\"\nThe next most frequently occurring category of resilience\nwas social support. Thirteen statements were coded as social\nsupport including,\na positive, loving environment at home. Kids will thrive when\nthey are loved and feel love and are shown love and they\nreciprocate love . . . that kind of healthy environment will help\nthem grow and develop as opposed to the opposite.\nFurthermore, comments highlighting the benefit of a positive\nhome life suggested that resilience was fostered through\nsocial support. Such comments included,\nWhen you have that person that you can go home to . . . hang up\nthe coat, so to speak, and be able to let your guard down and be\nin a condition where you have that moment to relax and let\nsomebody care for you.\nFinally, other participants mentioned the importance of hav-\ning \"a support system\" and \"positive role models,\" when\ndescribing social support's role in resilience.\nPersonal competence was the next most frequently used\ncategory of resilience, including 12 statements. Personal\ncompetence was defined as having personal feelings of self-\nesteem, self-efficacy, and possessing a realistic orientation\ntoward life (Friborg, 2003). A statement that demonstrates\npersonal competence includes, \"Being able to withstand\npressure. When you are put under pressure, some people\nfocus and some people fold, and I think (people) who last\nlong and do well are those that can focus.\" Another example\nof personal competence includes, \"I always had a certain\namount of confidence that kind of helped me get over what-\never it was.\"\nFollowing, perseverance was the next most frequently\nused category of resilience, including 11 statements. A state-\nment that illustrates the category of perseverance includes,\n\"You are going to have highs and lows and you're going to\nhave situations, but with all the craziness . . . kind of keep a\nbase and continue to go. Stamina is a good word.\"\nFurthermore, when speaking about resilient individuals, one\nparticipant stated, \"A certain percentage (of individuals), no\nmatter what you do to them, they will always continue.\"\nFinally, some words and phrases that were used by partici-\npants that were categorized as perseverance included, \"sur-\nvival,\" \"tough,\" and \"bounce back.\"\nEight statements were categorized in both emotional reg-\nulation and physical fitness categories. Emotional regulation\nwas defined as an individual's ability to modify various\naspects of emotional experience (Tugade & Fredrickson,\n2004). An example of a statement regarding emotional regu-\nlation includes,\nA lot of times we see resilience equals emotionless and so what\nhappens is you never know how to turn it back on . . . in order to\nbe resilient, in order to deal, is to turn off completely in every\naspect of your life just to make sure you get through. In my\nmind, resiliency is not that, it's being able to actually deal with\nthe situation and be able to process, learn something from it, and\nmove on.\nAn example of a statement regarding physical fitness\nincludes,\nThere are people that are more physically fit, that are less shaky,\nare less nervous, or at least able to control it better. Everyone\ngets tunnel vision, but those who have more physical fitness\ntend to breathe and open that (tunnel vision) back up at a better\nrate than somebody who is not as physically fit.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe next most frequently occurring categories were\nadaptability and belongingness, with seven and six state-\nments in each category, respectively. Regarding adaptability,\nwhen discussing resilience as a learned characteristic, one\nparticipant stated,\nSome things are instinctive. The will to survive might be\ninstinctive but then you can learn how to, maybe by modeling,\nsomething an adult would model, or your environment would\nallow you to model, how to adapt and adjust. I think you can\nlearn and sharpen those skills.\nIn addition, the following statement illustrated the concept of\nbelongingness:\nI think that many of us in our job rely on that. We crave it. That's\none of the reasons that we got into this job to begin with . . . we\nreally love the camaraderie and the brotherhood that we try to\nmake. We have each other to rely on and that makes us a lot\nstronger than individuals.\nFinally, a single statement was categorized as optimism.\nOptimism was defined by feelings of enthusiasm, hopeful-\nness, and alertness. The statement that was best categorized\nas optimism included,\nA positive mindset. My instruction and expertise has always\nbeen in the tactical realm . . . and mindset is what we train for as\nmuch as anything else. The no quit attitude . . . the roof is caving\nin on me from the fire perspective and I'm not going to let that\nstop me, I'm going to get out and get my team out. That's a form\nof resiliency.\nDiscussion\nPolice officers, firefighters, and EMTs perform a variety of\ntasks that can greatly affect their mental and physical well-\nbeing. Given that first responders operate in environments\nthat inherently are stressful, it is important to examine how\nthese professionals stay resilient to gain a better understand-\ning of how they are able to effectively cope with various situ-\nations and perform successfully. For persons in helping\nprofessions, the data gathered through these focus groups\ngive a glimpse into the perceptions of first responders, as\nwell as the general population as they relate to resilience and\nsurviving in the workplace.\nThere were a number of commonalities between first\nresponders and the general population in the way that they\ndescribed resilience. Positive coping, or using strategies to\nreduce stress and solve problems, was the most frequently\noccurring factor in both samples. This seems to suggest that\nregardless of occupation, there is a belief that one can cope\nwith adversity with internal or external strategies mecha-\nnisms to be resilient. Both groups also believed that social\nsupport, or social ties such as friends and family can affect\nresilience. Personal competence or belief in oneself also was\nmentioned by both groups. For mental health professionals\nwho might work with people to increase resilience, discus-\nsion about positive ways of coping, building or maintaining\na support network, and raising self-efficacy might assist with\nincreasing resilience.\nIn addition to the commonalities, there were a number of\ninteresting distinctions in how the two samples understood\nthe term resilience. One important point of discussion is that\nthe characteristics identified by first responders did not\ninclude the desire to process these traumatic events with a\nhelping professional. It is important for mental health profes-\nsionals to recognize the unique nature of first responder\noccupations and approach working with this population with\nan appreciation for the occupational hazards that are com-\nmon with this group. This uniqueness separates these work-\ners from those in the general population, and the difference\nin the way the two groups perceive resiliency is an important\ndistinction to keep in mind.\nThrough the study, it became clear that first responders\nbelieved that positive coping is a process that resilient indi-\nviduals use to deal with occupational stressors. The partici-\npants identified a variety of ways that stress can be dealt with\nincluding humor and positive thinking. As a group, first\nresponders suggested that dealing with work stressors is sim-\nply something that persons in their positions must learn to\ndo. The assumption then is that first responders believe that\ntraumatic events and work stress should be dealt with indi-\nvidually, and that to survive in the job, they must learn inter-\nnal coping mechanisms. When asked about dealing with\nthese traumatic events, the participants did not readily iden-\ntify counseling or professional helping relationships as an\neffective way of working through such issues.\nFirst responders also highlighted the importance of hav-\ning a support system to help with resilience. A common\ntheme that was evident through this study's focus groups is\nthat first responders understand the value of having a posi-\ntive, supportive environment outside of work. This is not to\nsuggest that having a support system at work is not benefi-\ncial; however, participants specifically discussed the home\nenvironment as a place where they could \"let their guard\ndown\" and have the opportunity to relax. Specifically, allow-\ning another person to care for them was helpful after so much\nof their work time was focused on helping others in various\nlevels of need. However, the first responders in our study did\nnot identify talking about their specific stressors, or process-\ning their traumatic experiences as being important to stay\nresilient. In fact, first responders highlighted the ability to\nremain emotionless in the face of trauma as being an effec-\ntive way to deal with work experiences.\nAlthough both first responders and the general population\ndiscussed the importance of social support in relation to\nresilience, their notions of social support was vastly differ-\nent. Those in the general population referred to social sup-\nport as a way to share resources so that people are able to\nlearn from each other. This implies a sharing of information\nCrowe et al. 7\nand a discussion of some personal information. While first\nresponders also highlighted the importance of social support,\nthey tended to view that as a place to feel accepted and relax,\nbut did not imply that there was any discussion regarding the\ntraumatic events at work. It would seem that first responders\nappreciate a supportive environment where they can detach\nfrom the world of work, but not necessarily have to deal with\nany of the horrors they may face through their jobs. This\nfinding might demonstrate that first responders struggle with\nsharing their reactions to these events as a way to cope or that\nthis style of coping is simply a means of avoiding stressors\nwithout effectively dealing with any of them. If this is the\ncase, then it would seem likely that at some point, the stress-\nors would increase and perhaps lead to greater mental health\nor psychosomatic health concerns. It is also interesting to\nnote that the general population referred to societal resources\na number of times, however this term was not found in the\nfocus groups with first responders. This suggests that the\ngeneral population understands the value of accessing\nresources that are out of the immediate control of the indi-\nvidual. However, first responders did not mention societal\nresources implying that this population believes the develop-\nment of resilience is more of personal process, and that the\nutilization of outside resources is either not needed, or not\nviewed as a positive within that community.\nLimitations\nA few limitations are noteworthy related to this study. Many\nparticipants (both first responder as well as those who were\nin the general population subgroup) had some experience\nrelated to mental health concerns, either personally or with\nsomeone in their family. This could affect attitudes as well as\nresilience. Some of our participants also indicated that they\nhad sought professional support for a mental health concern,\nor stressor related to work or personal life and that they had\nfelt positively about this experience. Perhaps resilience lev-\nels and perceptions of the concept of resilience are different\nfor those who have been touched in some way with a mental\nhealth concern, and affected by seeking professional help. In\naddition, this study used a focus group design, which lends\nitself to gathering a large amount of data in a short amount of\ntime; however, participant responses can be affected by what\nis being shared by others in the focus group. Although the\nfocus group leader made every effort to allow each partici-\npant to share his or her unique perceptions, the very nature of\nfocus group design includes this threat.\nImplications for Future Research\nThis research explored perceptions of general population\nmembers as well as first responders as they related to the\nnotion of resilience. The qualitative design allowed for the\nresearch team to unveil attitudes and uncover content related\nto how these two groups defined the concept and related it to\npersonal and professional experiences. Future scholars might\ncontinue this line of inquiry with large-scale, quantitative\ninvestigations so that group differences can be explored.\nWhen looking at the ways that the two samples (first respond-\ners and general population) defined the concept of resilience,\nthere were noteworthy differences in addition to some simi-\nlarities. For the general population, positive coping was the\nmost frequently occurring category followed by social sup-\nport and adaptability. Consistent with the general population,\nfirst responders described resilience most frequently with\npositive coping. Social support was the next most frequently\noccurring category, followed by personal competence, perse-\nverance, emotional regulation, and physical fitness.Although\nboth the general population and first responder participants\nhighlighted the importance of having a support network, first\nresponders suggested that dealing with traumatic experi-\nences was more of an individual process, and seeking profes-\nsional help was not common practice. Future studies can\ncontinue to explore how first responders cope with the nature\nof their work, so that professionals as well as those in their\npersonal networks can best support them.\nConclusion\nFirst responders are tasked with difficult jobs that often\nrequire an individual to work and perform in the face of tre-\nmendous stressors and traumatic events. It would seem that\neveryone would benefit from having such individuals be as\nresilient as possible, so that they are able to perform effec-\ntively while maintaining a healthy mental and physical bal-\nance in their lives outside of work. As helping professionals,\nit is important to keep in mind the unique characteristics of\nthese occupations as we seek to provide these individuals\nwith quality care. Mental health professionals have the\npotential to reach this population, educate them on the ben-\nefits of seeking counseling, and help them better understand\nthe positives that can be found through utilizing such ser-\nvices. Furthermore, mental health professionals must also\nunderstand the unique culture of the profession to understand\nhow to effectively work with this client population. This\nstudy highlighted differences as well as similarities in the\nperceptions of resilience among first responders and the gen-\neral population. Positive coping, social support, and personal\ncompetence were mentioned in both samples as part of what\ncomprises resilience. A noteworthy difference was that first\nresponders seemed to conceptualize resilience as an individ-\nual characteristic not necessarily requiring the use of outside\nresources. Until strides are made to change these percep-\ntions, it seems unlikely that first responders will take the step\nto seek professional support, further isolating these persons\nto deal with these stressors alone. In turn, it is clear that help-\ning professionals must begin to reach out to such populations\nto both educate and care for our first responders, who persis-\ntently care for and protect the population at large, despite\nconstant threats to their personal well-being.\n8 SAGE Open\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAvey, J., Luthans, F., Smith, R., & Palmer, N.
