    "abstract": "Abstract\nIntercountry adoption (ICA) is a relatively common practice. Since its contemporary conception during the Second World\nWar, approximately one million children have been adopted internationally. Controversy surrounding ICA includes ideas\nabout human rights and notions of child rescue in the context of major reform to prevent child sales and abduction under\nthe Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption. Social work, as a discipline, is a central player in ICA practices, and at least,\none historian asserts that social work academic literature is scant on the topic of problematic practice and reforms.A review\nof the social work literature was conducted, and four thematic areas emerged in the 87 manuscripts reviewed: (a) social\npolicy; (b) exploitation, social justice, ethics, and human rights; (c) clinical perspectives to include identity, child development,\nand family transition; and (d) child welfare practices. Results indicate a small but robust body of social work literature, and\nhighlights are presented as well as analysis indicating methodical trends.\n",
    "reduced_content": "http://sgo.sagepub.com\nThis review of social work's contribution to the literature on\nintercountry adoption (ICA) was originally developed for the\n2010 Ontario Adoption Summit, which brought together a\nmultidisciplinary group of scholars, practitioners, and other\nstakeholders to focus on the future of ICA, including the\n\"need to reduce corruption and human trafficking while\nmaximizing the best interests of children who are abandoned\nor relinquished\" (Adoption Summit, n.d.). Each discipline\npresented on the current state of knowledge, and this litera-\nture review was conducted for the social work panel. To give\nsome structure to this literature review, we defer to Masson's\n(2001) exploration of ICA and her questioning the practice\nas a \"global problem or global solution?\" Masson identifies\ntypologies of value-positions or perspectives on ICA: aboli-\ntionists, pragmatists, and promoters.\nApplying these perspectives, Rotabi and Gibbons (2009)\nfind that there is diversity across the disciplines actively\ninvolved in researching ICAwith the majority voicing a prag-\nmatic view (Gibbons & Rotabi, in press). Historian Dubinsky\n(2010), on examination of adoption ethics and the history of\nadoption from and within theAmericas, asserts, \"Professional\nconcerns about adoption practice are voiced in relative obscu-\nrity of social work journals\" (p. 100). We collate social work\ncontributions on the subject of ICA and reform, indicating a\nsmall but strong body of work providing critical discourse\nabout the \"concerns\" and recommendations for change. We\nbegin with exploration of the concept of the best interests of\nthe child as well as the usage of the term orphan across the\nbroad and multidisciplinary literature to provide a context\nand illustrate the challenges. Then, we review ICA themes\nin social work literature.\nBeginning With an Important\nConcept: The Best Interests\nof the Child Defined\nThe best interest of the child is one of the four principles of\nthe U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and,\nmore specifically, is mentioned in Article 21 of the CRC as\nthe paramount consideration when considering ICA (United\nNations Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989; Vit\u00e9 &\nof the 1993 Hague Convention on Protection of Children\nand the Cooperation in Relation to Intercountry Adoption\n(henceforth referred to as the Hague Convention or simply\nthe HCIA; The Hague Conference on Private International\nLaw, 1993). Therefore, it is an overarching principle in ICA\npolicy and practice. However, as important as this principle\n1Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, USA\n2Independent Consultant\nCorresponding Author:\nKaren Smith Rotabi,Virginia Commonwealth University, 1001 West\nEmail: ksrotabi@vcu.edu\nIn an Era of Reform:A Review of Social\nWork Literature on Intercountry Adoption\nKaren Smith Rotabi1 and Kelley McCreery Bunkers2\n Keywords\ncultural studies, international migration, social structure, social work, sociology of race and ethnicity\n2 SAGE Open\nis to ICA, interpretation is the problem, as understanding\nand implementation of this principle are greatly influenced\nby cultural and contextual factors (Alston, 1994).\nThe inherent challenges related to defining the best inter-\nests of the child principle have been explored by academics\nof all related professional disciplines. Human rights' expert\nPhillip Alston (1994) underscores how the principle acts as a\nbridge or a mediator between cultural beliefs and children's\nrights. Legal scholars especially have called on the best\ninterest of the child principle to support and challenge ICA\nas an intervention (Bartholet & Smolin, in press; Dillon,\nwork researchers have asserted that protecting the best inter-\nests of children within the ICA must be based on a systems\napproach to ensure universally implemented ethical and\nlack a formalized definition of the best interests principle as\nit relates to ICA--one that is empirically tested and agreed\non universally--and it is necessary to truly ensure that safe-\nguards for children and families are in place.\nGiven that the CRC and the Hague Convention fail to pro-\nvide precise requirements on what must be considered when\ndetermining the best interest of the child in ICA, social work\nprofessionals can look toward common values shared by\nsocial work, the CRC, and the Hague Convention, including\nensuring that domestic care options are explored prior to\nplacement in ICA, preserving information about the child's\nhistory and family of origin, soliciting and taking into account\nthe views of the child, and providing professional services by\npeople who place the child's well-being at the center of all\ndecisions (The Hague Conference on Private International\nbalanced determination of a child's best interests must be tai-\nlored to each child and his or her unique family system's\nstrengths and needs, including empirical evidence when\nmaking social service recommendations and selecting inter-\nventions. Zermatten, a leading child rights scholar and the\nrecently elected chairperson of the U.N. CRC, acknowledges\nthe need for more empirical evidence to help better inform\ndecision makers about the best interest principle (Zermatten,\n2010). This is, in part, due to the misunderstanding of which\nchildren are truly orphaned and which children have intact\nfamily and kinship systems in need of support rather than\nICA as an intervention.\nDefining \"Orphan\"\nOne of the troubling trends in the general literature and the\npractice community is the use, misuse, and even occasional\nabuse of the term orphan. Recognizing the dangers and\npotential pitfalls of this term is important if social work as a\nprofession aims to improve ICA services. The term orphan\nhas returned to common lexicon in the past decade with the\nonset of HIV and AIDS and is especially prevalent in the\nAfrican context (Roby & Shaw, 2006), as it has become a\nmajor priority for international aid agencies (Ennew, 2005).\nAbebe (2009) points out, in the midst of this prioritization,\nthat the term orphan has become extremely politicized, espe-\ncially by the donor community and mass media, with orphan\nbeing defined by different parties and for different reasons,\nsome of those not always in the best interests of children\nSimilar to the best interest of the child principle, the con-\ncept of orphan is not necessarily understood by all cultures or\nby all professions the same way. Orphanhood may be defined\nby death of one or both birth parents, by age of the child, and\neven by the reasons for parental death, as is the case of AIDS.\nThere are \"double orphans\" who have lost both parents to\ndeath or some other permanent separation, and there are \"sin-\ngle orphans\" (Abebe, 2009). This latter group would be called\nchildren of single parents in industrialized nations; however,\nin low-resource countries, they are often counted as orphans,\nillustrating differences of word usages across cultures and\neconomic contexts.\nDefining the child as an orphan is frequently done by peo-\nple who have a vested interest in the final outcome. For exam-\nple, by referring to the UNICEF statistic of 143 million\norphans globally, proponents of ICA may use this statistic to\npromote their ICA position or perspective (e.g., Bartholet,\nber does not at all reflect the true and much smaller number of\nchildren in need of and appropriate for ICA as a final place-\nment option (see Bartholet & Smolin, in press; UNAIDS,\nSocial orphans are those children who may be living in an\ninstitution--placed there by parents or close relatives--as a\nplacement option where proper nutrition and education are\nconsistently accessible and are living in a low-resource nation\n(Roby & Maskew, in press). This was found to be true for\nmost of the children living in institutions in Haiti at the time\nof the January 2010 earthquake (Balsari, Lemery, Williams,\n& Nelson, 2010; Selman, in press). Brazil is another nation\nwith many social orphans living as street children in addition\nto adolescents living in institutions. Of the latter, sometimes\ninstitutions are used as a response to juvenile delinquency\n(Garcia & Fernandez, 2009). These \"orphans\" have family\nsystems, some more intact than others, and supporting these\nfamily resources in an effort to reunify families and deinstitu-\ntionalize children is critically important. In these cases, ICA\nis most likely not the appropriate solution.\nBailey (2009b) discusses the limited attention paid to the\nissue of orphans in English social work literature. The scar-\ncity of information available leaves practitioners, policy\nmakers, and academics with a very limited view of the issues\nfacing children and social work practitioners outside the bor-\nders of high-resource countries (Bailey, 2009b). This limited\ninformation allows for common misinterpretations. Ensuring\nthat a commonly understood and appropriate definition of\nRotabi and Bunkers 3\nthe term orphan is identified and agreed on by social work\nprofessionals is an important step in promoting a better under-\nstanding of family group structure and the need for social\nintervention.\nSocial Work as a Discipline:A\nLargely PragmaticVoice Prevails\nGenerally speaking, when reviewing social work literature,\nthe majority voice is pragmatic, and this is logical given social\nwork's long-standing commitment to child welfare policy\nand practice. Literature addressing the social work role is\ngiven attention in this review, and because there is a limited\nliterature from social workers in low-resource nations, when-\never possible, that literature is included. Also, literature from\nunderrepresented countries and regions is given additional\nattention. While we emphasize peer-reviewed literature,\nhowever, when appropriate, we occasionally include \"gray\nliterature\" because they are often written by social workers\nand child rights advocates in child-sending nations (Banks,\nreports are early literature indicating poor practice and adop-\ntion fraud. When such reports begin to emerge, they are\noften treated as rumor without enough \"evidence\" or\nresearch rigor to publish in refereed journals, but later, they\nare cited historically.\nAs Bailey (2009b) points out, social work literature in the\nmajority of academic journals has been dominated by the per-\nspectives of North American and Western European scholars.\nKnowledge about social work practice in low- or middle-\nincome countries or global practice in general is inadequate,\nand it reminds us of repeated commentaries or even chal-\nlenges for greater global understanding in the profession\ntackle the challenge of human rights, ethics, and human\nresponsibilities, including exploration of praxis from multiple\nperspectives. This is particularly relevant to ICA practice\ngiven the transactional nature of child welfare extending\nacross geographic borders and the interface of social care sys-\ntems--social workers and other disciplines like pediatricians\nand psychologists collaborating on child placement between\nlow- and high-resource nations.\nIdentifying Social Work Literature\nandThemes in ICA\nTo explore existing literature for this review, standard search\nengines were used, including Academic Search Complete\nand PsychINFO. Social work authors who have been par-\nticularly active in the field were given special consideration,\nusing Google Scholar Internet searches in addition to a\nreview of curriculum vita\u00e9s. Also, journals dedicated to\ninternational social work, child welfare, and adoption (e.g.,\nAdoption Quarterly) were searched specifically in addition\nto using Social Work Abstracts for a discipline-specific\nsearch. Literature reviewed spans from the late 1970s until\n2010, with the exception of adding manuscripts identified as\n\"in press.\" Authors were confirmed to be social workers and\nwhen there were multiple authors, it was confirmed that at\nleast one of the contributors was a social worker.\nWhile this is a summary of highlights of social work lit-\nerature with a theme of ICA reform or having implications\nfor human service improvement and/or reform, it is not abso-\nlutely exhaustive. Summarized are the contributions of 87\nmanuscripts with 70 being peer reviewed. By and large, the\nearliest social work reform literature dates back to the late\nwere being posed about Korean adoptees (e.g., Kim, 1977).\nThen the early 1990s marked an era of rapid globalization,\nwhich eventually emerges into what we call the era of\nreform. Romanian adoptions were largely the focus in the\nearliest stages of literature in the era of globalization with a\ntransition to other nations and application of global social\npolicy, practice, and value dilemmas in the era of reform\n(e.g., Vonk, Simms, & Nackerud, 1999, on China).\nThe vast majority of publications had a common theme of\n(a) social policy; (b) exploitation, social justice, ethics, and\nhuman rights; (c) clinical perspectives to include identity,\nchild development, and family transition; and (d) child wel-\nfare practices. Although all of these areas overlap, the litera-\nture review will be reported in this bounded order. We\nemphasize literature that discusses the role of the social\nworker in orphan and vulnerable child care and/or ICA prac-\ntices. Also, literature that is particularly important conceptu-\nally and/or should be noted due to empirical rigor also\nreceives greater attention.\nSocial Policy\nSocial policy analysis and discussion are prominent in much\nof the social work literature with examples and/or case stud-\nies that are often presented to underscore issues (e.g., Altstein\nwork practitioner who was involved in early ICA work,\nincluding the Vietnam Babylift, wrote about child rescue\nefforts. As a promoter, Ryan states that \"when increasing\nnumbers of children are confined to refugee camps . . . in\nmany cases intercountry adoption is their best hope for a\nchance in life, and for life itself\" (p. 49). Her discussion\nconcludes with 10 recommendations, including not only\ngovernment funding for research but also the need for an\n\"international coordinating agency which could set standards\nfor intercountry adoption\" (p. 58) in addition to the need\nfor home study authority in the placement state as well as\nthe general development of good policy.\nTen years later, the 1993 Hague Convention was devel-\noped and set forth requirements for governance at a central\nauthority level, thereby meeting Ryan's (1983) suggestion\nof a coordination approach. Today more than 80 nations are\n4 SAGE Open\nparty to the agreement set forth to promote the best interests\nof the child and prevent child sales, abduction, and child traf-\nficking while providing a framework for ethical adoption\nand interstate cooperation (The Hague Conference on Private\nRotabi (2008), Rotabi and Gibbons (in press), Triseliotis\n(2000), and others as they consider issues of commodifica-\ntion of children and social work concerns ranging from social\njustice to policy and practice at the agency level. A watershed\nmoment for signature countries, the agreement requires that\nnations meet international child welfare standards not just for\nICA as a single practice area but also to provide a range of\ncare and family support that should occur prior to any ratify-\ning nation's approval of a child for ICA. This continuum of\nchild welfare placement options is based on the subsidiarity\nprinciple of the HCIA, which is that biological families\nshould first be supported before alternative care becomes a\nplan for children. Then, if necessary, children have a right to be\nplaced within a family system (e.g., kinship care/guardianship)\nand when possible, remain in their country of origin.\nOnce kinship and other appropriate local care approaches\nare explored, including foster care and/or domestic adoption,\nthen the child or sibling group may be deemed appropriate\nfor consideration of placement into ICA (Rotabi, 2008).\nMoreover, although social work scholars have long consid-\nered the best interests of children and the continuum of child\nwelfare intervention, including adoption, currently there is a\nlack of empirical literature on the subject as it relates to ICA.\nThis is especially true in regards to the subsidiarity principle\nof the HCIA and the care practices of orphaned and vulner-\nable children (Abebe, 2009), specifically interventions that\nhonor subsidiarity rather than fast-tracking desirable children\ninto ICA (Rotabi & Gibbons, in press).\nBergquist's (2009, in press) policy analysis of the HCIA\nfocuses on its application to disaster and war. Reviewing the\nhistory of the Vietnam Babylift and child abduction attempts\nelsewhere, Bergquist makes important points about the\nremoval of children in the context of emergency and war,\nincluding contemporary discourse on child \"rescue.\" An\nimportant consideration is child status either being \"orphans\"\nor \"refugees.\" Bergquist recognizes the HCIAas an important\nstep forward but ultimately concludes that it is inadequate in\nthe context of war and disaster.\nThis analytical thread of limited HCIAguidance is carried\non in the case of disaster by Rotabi and Bergquist (2010),\nfocusing on a U.S. based faith group's attempt to abduct chil-\ndren for adoption in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in\nHaiti. In this case, the crime and then the lack of will to ulti-\nmately prosecute the individuals involved with attempted\nchild trafficking for adoption were explored. This reality\nunderscores, in real terms, the limited consequences for child\nabduction for adoption. In the case of Haiti, the HCIAdid not\napply because Haiti was not a party to the agreement at\nthat time. As a result, the capacity to prosecute for human\ntrafficking was ultimately inadequate under legal codes (see\nBromfield & Rotabi, in press).\nRotabi and Bergquist (2010) explore the best interests of\nthe child, the differences of opinion, and the ethical dilem-\nmas that arise when making broad generalizations about\norphans and extreme poverty, especially when ICA is pro-\nmoted as a dominant child welfare intervention. ICA in\nGuatemala became the epicenter of this debate, and there has\nbeen a small body of research on the postconflict context and\nchild welfare system of this particularly significant sending\nBunkers, Groza, and Lauer (2009) and Bunkers and\nGroza (in press) present a historical and policy analysis of\nGuatemala's ICAtrends, illustrating how the practice became\na multimillion-dollar industry. These authors argue that\nICA and the financial pressures ultimately undermined the\nGuatemalan State's interest in developing a domestic child\nwelfare system and rather relied on ICAas the main response.\nThis supplanted child welfare efforts across a continuum of\ncare ultimately yielding to ICA because of the powerful\nfinancial influences at all levels of the system. Among\ntheir observations were birth mother payments. The authors\nasserted that this form of child sales became routine within\nGuatemalan adoption practices. Gresham, Nackerud, and\nRisler (2004) also considered this issue and captured the wor-\nrisome human rights violations that were documented by the\nUnited Nations Economic and Social Council Commission\non Human Rights (2000). An important gray report devel-\noped by a large group of human rights defenders, lawyers,\nand social workers titled \"Adoptions in Guatemala: Protection\nor Business?\" (Alianza et al., 2007) identified a clear mar-\nket dynamic with at least 90% of the children departing\nGuatemala being ages 0 to 2 years and mainly bound to the\nUnited States. In an effort to assess the context and problems\nof Guatemalan adoptions within an ecological perspective,\nRotabi, Morris, and Weil (2008) present postconflict social\nindicators with observations about the role of social workers\nengaged in a nation notorious for extreme violence against\nwomen, including child abduction (Rotabi, 2009). These\nauthors also pose questions about the conception of \"client\"\nand the professional role of social workers and others repre-\nsenting the interests of international adoption agencies--\nfrequently distorting the realities of orphaned and vulnerable\nchildren to serve the private adoption model. Changes in the\nGuatemalan system and radical decline in ICA (Bunkers &\nGroza, in press; Rotabi & Bunkers, 2008) have resulted in\nshifts to other nations, most notably Ethiopia (Selman, 2009).\nBunkers, Rotabi, and Mezmur (in press) focus on emerg-\ning concerns and problems in Ethiopia, including legal codes\nand processes that undermine the best interests of the child.\nThis includes Ethiopia's failure to sign and accede to the\nHCIA thus far, leaving the nation vulnerable to unscrupulous\nentrepreneurs who are not bound by international standards--\nit is feared that some of the most unethical adoption agencies\nRotabi and Bunkers 5\nhave shifted from Guatemala to Ethiopia as a new frontier.\nSome of the troubling activities include adoptive-birth fam-\nily visits in villages and gift exchanges (Rotabi, 2010), inter-\nsecting with traditional child care models. This includes\nGudifecha, a centuries-old practice in which family and kin\narrange informal adoption for orphaned and vulnerable chil-\ndren (Bunkers et al., in press).\nIncluding Ethiopia as a significant country of origin,\nButterfield and Alemu (2006) as well as Roby and Shaw\n(2006) explore some of the issues and opportunities of child\nadoption in their analysis of the larger African region. In this\nlatter analysis, the authors bring the ICA discourse back to\nlocal concerns for adoption of African American children\nfrom the public child welfare system in the United States,\nthereby highlighting some of the challenges and contradic-\ntions of ICA. Finally, it should be noted that limited infor-\nmation and analysis are also found in the gray literature\nspecifically addressing adoption trends and concerns in\nthe African continent as a whole (United Nations, 2009).\nHowever, this is likely to change given the increasing focus\non and practice of adoption in this region.\nOther countries have contributed significantly to ICA,\nmost notably China. British authors Dowling and Brown\n(2009) discuss ICA changes in China in the context of global-\nization such as the shift toward special needs children, also\nbriefly discussing the nation's efforts toward domestic foster\ncare and adoption. From China itself, Meng and Kai (2009)\npresent a historical perspective, including differing defini-\ntions of \"orphan\" and the one-child policy, children orphaned\nby AIDS, and children socially orphaned due to parental\nimprisonment. While noting a huge discrepancy between\nand UNICEF's estimates of 21 million children, authors inte-\ngrate economic realities, including a discussion of privileged\nversus marginalized groups. These authors mention ICA\nbriefly as an intervention, but ultimately, their focal point is\ndifferent domestic care models, including orphanages, fos-\nter care, and kinship care. New and emerging roles of social\nworkers are discussed with the challenges related to the pro-\njected increase in children orphaned by HIV/AIDS.\nAfrican scholar Maundeni (2009) outlines the definition\nof \"orphans\" and their care in Botswana, also considering\nchildren orphaned by HIV/AIDS and challenges for social\nworkers. Poverty-reduction programs, social development\nissues, and a brief discussion of the laws that govern the\npractice of child care are presented. The subject of child\nrights frames the discussion, including different forms of\nassistance to children and their families without any men-\ntion of ICA. The author observes that social workers are\noverwhelmed partly because of inadequate training, specifi-\ncally in child welfare, as well as their daily function of serv-\ning multiple villages in a community development approach.\nThe capacity to care for the needs of individual children or to\nfocus on family support of specific or at-risk families is lack-\ning in this mode of intervention. The importance of kinship\ncare in this traditional society is discussed, and Maundeni\npoints out that 95% of orphans are absorbed in such structures\nwithin communities--without social service intervention.\nKinship care problems are outlined, such as the separation of\norphan siblings across the kin-group for economic reasons or\na lack of self-determination on the part of some children for\ntheir own care planning. Formalized interventions include\nfostering and adoption, and these forms of alternative care are\nfound in the Botswana 2008 legal code, but the state has not\nyet implemented these programs. The family-care approach\nto institutional care, with house parents, is used in small-scale\nprograms. The author points out that these homes are not like\nstereotypical inhumane institutions, as this smaller scale\napproach enables tailored care to address the unique needs of\nchildren.\nFrom the Australian perspective, Fronek (2006) offers a\ntheoretical framework for understanding the \"emergence, dif-\nfusion, and continuance of South Korean intercountry adop-\ntion\" (p. 22), which is largely based on policy and the global\ncontext of both the sending country (South Korea) and receiv-\ning countries. Drawing on previous literature on the subject,\ncited is Sarri, Baik, and Bombyk's (1998) important observa-\ntion that South Korea has experienced goal displacement\nbecause of the nation's failure to establish adequate adoption\nservices on a domestic level and deferring to ICA as the inter-\nvention of choice for orphaned and vulnerable children.\nHowever, Fronek points to inadequate domestic adoption\nsystems as only one factor in the ICA equation in the Asian\nnation that has been a relatively active country of origin,\nalthough declining in recent history. Applying the Actor\nNetwork Theory, Fronek develops a framework capturing the\ncomplexity of ICAwith multiple interactions in the context of\nglobalization. More recently, Fronek and Tilse (2010) carry\nforth this earlier research into an Australian\u00adKorean case\nstudy, exploring the complexities of policy and international\npractice between two country systems, including a discussion\nof the use of the Internet in ICA.\nFrom the United States, Roby and Matsumura's (2002)\nresearch provides some insight into historical problems and\nbirth mother issues in another Pacific nation, the Marshall\nwas learned that most of the mothers had other children. The\nreasons for relinquishment were found to be financial, spe-\ncifically no means of support to care for the child. Also, when\nthe role of grandmothers was explored, it was found that they\nwere often helping with child care, and ultimately, they were\na part of the pressure for birth mother relinquishment. Also,\nin a high birthrate community where abortion was not a legal\noption for unwanted pregnancy, the problems were further\ncomplicated by the fact that temporary child care assistance\nor services were not available as a government service. Roby\nand Matsumura also make important observations about\ncultural ideas related to the continuity of the parent\u00adchild\nrelationship and that the conception of adoption does not\nterminate the relationship. Informal care in the Marshall\n6 SAGE Open\nIslands existed to meet the needs of orphaned and vulnerable\nchildren within the extended family and kin group. Authors\nfound that the child was viewed as a link or bridge between\ntwo families, or a child could be given as a gift to the new\nfamily. In turn, this would provide for and help the birth fam-\nily and kinship group of the child, a particularly complicated\nethical dilemma when this concept is applied to ICA.\nIn Roby, Wyatt, and Pettys' (2005) follow-up with a sur-\nvey research study of open adoptions surveying U.S. families\nwho have adopted from the Marshall Islands, results include\nmotivations to adopt, willingness for openness, and insights\ngained from their experiences. The results suggest that those\nsurveyed embraced openness but recognized that contact\nwith birth parents is difficult.\nRoby and Maskew (in press) present a timely analysis and\ndiscussion of child welfare and adoption systems reform in\nthe Marshall Islands as well as Cambodia. Applying the\nhuman rights perspective, a historical overview of the\ndevel\nopment of regulatory controls is useful when consid-\nering early stages of reform. This particular analysis further\ncaptures the nature of small and impoverished nations and\ntheir adoption transactions with far more powerful nations,\nparticularly the United States and Western Europe. Also\nresponding to the need for innovative interventions to support\nfamilies, Rotabi, Pennell, Roby, and Bunkers (in press) con-\nsider Family Group Conferencing (FGC) as a culturally\nadaptable intervention that has been codified into Marshall\nIslands law and suggest its application in Guatemala. This\nparticular contribution to the literature exemplifies bridging\nfrom social policy analysis to social intervention.\nBritish scholar Dickens (2009), a social policy and child\nwelfare expert, lays out a framework of three ideological and\npolicy approaches of social services and ICA in receiving\nnations: (a) liberal or neoliberal, (b) conservative corporatist,\nand (c) social democratic, which he aligns to political phi-\nlosophies of libertarianism, utilitarianism, and egalitarianism,\nrespectively. The first approach is exemplified by the United\nStates and its private ICA system that has a service for a\npurchase system within a free-market approach. In this sys-\ntem, the state takes a minimal role in regulation and protec-\ntion of the most vulnerable.\nIn keeping with the market-place ideology, there is an\nemphasis on choice: prospective adopters and birth\nparent(s) would be free to choose which agency to use,\nand even to select one another. This leads to a highly\ncompetitive market for healthy babies, exemplified by\non-line profiles of prospective adopters (effectively\nadvertisements) hoping that a birth parent will choose\nThis leads to inevitable problems and market dynamics\nin the private U.S. system and has been discussed by a num-\nber of social work scholars (e.g., Carstens & Juli\u00e1, 1995;\nIn this same discourse about social policy and underlying\nvalues, Dickens (1999), who worked for more than 3 years\nin Romania (Gibbons & Rotabi, in press), presents a case\nexample with historical analysis of the self-imposed morato-\nrium that was a result of multiple factors, including adoption\nfraud and issues of goal displacement (Sarri et al., 1998) as\nwell as the nation's entry into the European Union (EU). This\nparticular discourse is important as it highlights the contex-\ntual and political nature of ICA policy, illustrating underly-\ning values as well as how international pressure from the\nEU affected country-specific child care policy, particularly\nan ICA moratorium.\nDickens (1999) also writes about the emergence of social\nworkers in Romania and some of the challenges, especially in\na child welfare system that still heavily relied on both insti-\ntutional care and ICA. Social workers were often drawn to\ndetermine ICA as an appropriate care option because provid-\ning family support work and keeping children in their bio-\nlogical families were not valued or prioritized, especially\nbecause it frequently involved working closely with the\nRoma population, which was seen as degrading (Dickens,\n1999). Therefore, Dickens argues that social workers could\nfocus on ICA as a way to avoid the discomfort or \"low level\"\nwork that typifies family support work (Dickens, 1999).\nReferring a child to be adopted by a foreign family was a task\nthat was clearly defined and easy, and the social worker could\nfeel good about it. In some cases, the social worker could also\nreceive some kind of financial inducement for the referral in\na country where the average social worker's salary was\napproximately US$55 to US$100 per month at the time.\nDickens (2009) shows how this was an understandable choice\nfor the individual social workers involved but was also\nthe \"wider result in the weakening of domestic services\"\n(p. 601). Eventually, social workers became more recognized\nin the child welfare system, and as other alternative means of\ncare such as foster care and domestic adoption became stron-\nger, the legal framework changed to prioritize domestic care\noptions, resulting in social work practice that is more focused\non family support and other care options within the contin-\nuum. More recently, Nedelcu and Groza (in press) explore the\nhistory of ICA and reform in Romania, shedding light on the\nsignificant gains in domestic adoptions and other forms of\nalternative care, such as foster care, in that nation. In sum,\nthe literature focused on Romania provides invaluable insight\non legal reform, institutions, foster care, and ICA dating back\nto the earliest days of concern (Johnson, Edwards, & Puwak,\n1993) to later literature that captures changes across a social\ndevelopment continuum.\nFocusing on outside social work influence including their\nown, Dickens and Groza's (2004) historical review of child\n\"rescue\" in Romania poses important considerations for prac-\ntice and empowerment. These authors present four \"short-\ncomings\" and \"difficulties\" (p. 471) in the response to the\norphan crisis in that nation dating back to the early 1990s,\nas follows: (a) a lack of coordination of voluntary\nRotabi and Bunkers 7\nand international aid \"helping\" activities with Romanian\nauthorities; (b) displacement of Romanian child care/institu-\ntional workers with programming developed by outsiders and\nstaffed with volunteers--often passing critical judgment on\nthe Romanian women who had dedicated their careers to work-\ning in the institutions; (c) a failure of international organiza-\ntions to recognize that institutions actually \"magnified the\ngeneral poverty of their local communities\" (p. 472), and the\nproblem of Romanian staff becoming resentful of resource\ndonation to \"orphans\" when their own children and families\nwere without basic necessities (which reportedly led to staff\ntheft of medicines and other donated supplies); and (d) lim-\nited training of Romanian institutional staff--much of\nwhich was targeted to bilingual staff and ultimately created\ntensions and an inadequate sustainability plan. These prob-\nlems contributed to the collapse of the child welfare system,\nand with changes in the government and EU intervention,\nnew laws were developed--including profoster care legisla-\ntion for deinstitutionalization of children. This reflective\npiece is a summary of experiences that considers chal-\nlenges and ethical issues of power and change with out-\nsider or \"expert\" influence, concluding with \"What is to be\nthe proper place of international agencies, in particular those\ninvolved in inter-country adoption; and what are the respec-\ntive roles and responsibilities of central and local govern-\nExploitation, Ethics, Social Justice,\nand Human Rights\nAltstein and Simon's (1991) contributions to discourse in\nsocial work about adoption practices and ethics were par-\nticularly important to beginning critical thinking from mul-\ntiple and global perspectives. Herrmann and Kasper (1992)\nsound one of the earliest and most alarming warnings in\nsocial work peer review literature about the imbalance of\npower between sending and receiving nations, focusing on\nthe exploitation of women and families in impoverished\nenvironments. Also, in early discourse about morality and\nethics, Ngabonziza (1991) of International Social Service\nobserves that ICA\nhas developed because of modern means of commu-\nnication, it is north-south and west-east oriented and\nbetween rich and poor countries; provides children\nfrom a surplus to a deficit area; in many instances\nfunctions like a market and according to the laws of a\nmarket; and takes place between members of an\nadvanced and well organized society with plenty of\nsocial and legal institutions on the one hand and, on\nthe other, ad hoc institutions and or isolated individu-\nals such as lawyers, magistrates, social workers, who\nact as intermediaries, often motivated only by the\nIn Ngabonziza's (1991) discussion of global context, cul-\ntural points are considered such as Islamic Shari'ah law that\ndoes not recognize adoption and only allows for guardianship\n(called Kefala)--a form of kinship care that is essentially\nabsent in social work research and literature (an exception is\nJaffe, 1991). Ngabonziza discusses \"unbearable pressure\nfrom adoptive parents and agencies\" (p. 78), \"child traffick-\ning\" (p. 80), and a \"lack of social work tradition\" (p. 79) in\ncountries of origin. Combining the multiple underlying prob-\nlems of countries of origin, Ngabonziza uses an admonishing\nvoice of a true abolitionist when he concludes\nGiven the magnitude of problems facing relinquishing\ncountries, intercountry adoption, even properly con-\nducted, is meaningless. It presents an idealized life for\nsmall numbers of children as an alternative for global\npolicy. This is a duty for international cooperation and\ncannot be solved by intercountry adoption. (p. 80)\nFrom the United States, Hollingsworth (2003) writes\nabout the inherent social justice and exploitation issues, pre-\nsenting six distinct areas of concern:\n(1) International adoption may exploit family poverty\nin developing countries, (2) international adoption\nmay exploit social sanctions directed against disenfran-\nchised children, (3) gender oppression and discrimina-\ntion may be exploited for the purpose of adopting, (4)\nchildren's rights to knowledge of and access to their\nbirth family may be placed at risk, (5) children's identi-\nfication with their racial, ethnic, or national group may\nbe interrupted, and (6) children may be secured in ways\nthat involve abduction, sale, or trafficking. (p. 211)\nHollingsworth's (2003) view of ICA appears abolitionist\nin approach; however, she pragmatically presents alternative\nperspectives and acknowledges that ICA is not bad or\nexploitative for all children and biological families. Also,\nHollingsworth notes that there is an alternative view of ICA\nas an act of social justice itself--saving a child from extreme\npoverty and life in an institution. It should be noted that this\nview is shared by many who are promoters of ICA as a social\nintervention and as promoters of the practice. Hollingsworth\n(2008) again pragmatically follows up on these ideas in a\nlater commentary on the HCIA and its implications for cul-\ntural identity, posing critical questions about just how protec-\ntive the agreement can be for this important human rights\nconsideration.\nFrom Britain, Triseliotis (2000), a prolific contributor to\nadoption literature in general, challenges the conceptions\nof ICA as a humanitarian good with his discussion titled\n\"Intercountry Adoption: Global Trade or Global Gift?\"\nExploring the problematic dimensions of ICA, he ultimately\noffers pragmatic and regulatory recommendations about\n8 SAGE Open\nhow to \"achieve greater legitimacy\" (p. 45). Following are\nfive ways in which illegitimacy is manifested:\n(1) a disregard for children's rights as set forth in the\nUN Convention; (2) the absence of legality; (3) lack of\nchoice for birth parents; (4) disregard of empirically\nbased knowledge of what is known to be the best for\nchildren; and (5) absence of an ethical base. (Triseliotis,\nTriseliotis (2000) states that, in this period of the late\nin the interests of adults . . . and the trafficking in chil-\ndren that is a characteristic part of it, has set back the\nclock for the rights of children and has been a bad\nprecedent for countries still struggling to develop\nchild-centered legislation. (p. 49)\nTriseliotis (2000) identifies three ways in which ICA can\nachieve legitimacy: (a) a rights-based approach to children,\n(b) full international regulation, and (c) the practice of adop-\ntion as a global gift. Regulatory controls such as the removal\nof financial incentives are discussed, and in conclusion\nTriseliotis critiques the HCIA as it \"seems to have had little\nimpact . . . in stemming the trafficking in children . . . because\nits articles are insufficient or weak or both\" (p. 53).\nTurning to the idea of an \"ethical base\" of practice as dis-\ncussed by Triseliotis (2000), one cannot begin a discussion\nabout adoption ethics and social work without consideration\nof Madeleine Freundlich's important and seminal contribu-\ntions, including conceptions of supply and demand, benefi-\nbook Adoption and Ethics: The Market Forces in Adoption\nwas the most comprehensive social work summary of the\nissues at hand, making a multidimensional analysis of the\nsupply and demand market model--posing critical questions\nabout rights and responsibilities.\nDrawing on ethics and human rights, including Freundlich's\ncontributions, Roby and White's (2010) call for regulation of\nadoption activities on the Internet, highlighting examples of\nadoption fraud and technology applied to domestic and for-\neign adoptions. This is an important contribution as it high-\nlights the use of technology for global transactions in the ICA\nequation, including use of the Internet as a medium for mar-\nketing of services and children, some of which crosses the\nline into unethical and fraudulent practices.\nRoby is a prolific contributor to the literature as it relates\nto legal issues, ethics, and applied knowledge for reform.\nHer 2007 article \"From Rhetoric to Best Practice: Children's\nRights in Intercountry Adoption\" pulls together many con-\ncepts in this critically important analysis of the human rights\ndimensions of ICA, providing a holistic overview of the con-\ntinuum of rights with ICA as an important intervention. This\nincludes conceptions of rights prior to adoption such as the\nright to a determination of adoptability and a child's right to\nbe placed with a family that has received appropriate pre-\nplacement training and preparation. Also, full family mem-\nbership is presented as an adoptee's right of social acceptance\nin addition to the rights of access to birth and identity records.\nImportantly, Roby also discusses the child's right not to\nbecome a commodity while being mindful of conditions of\npoverty and birth family rights, including adoption into the\nextended family and/or nonrelative adoption within the nation.\nRoby's analysis is consistent with the Hague Convention and\nconcepts of the best interests of the child. This discourse is\ncontinued in Roby and Ife's (2009) consideration of human\nrights and reform and their presentation of a bottom-up\napproach to change that includes birth family input.\nPerspectives on Identity Formation, Family\nTransition, and Child Development\nSocial work has made considerable contributions to research\nabout adoptees, identity, and race (Simon & Altstein, 2001;\nSimon & Roorda, 2000). Important investigations include\nidentity development of Korean adoptees and family life\nin press; Yoon, 2004), including the rarely researched topic\nof openness in ICA (Hayes & Kim, 2007). Also, there are\nimportant research results in the literature related to child\ntransition from country of origin to the new adopted home\nand child development, including the institutional experience,\nespecially in Romania (e.g., Gavrilovici & Groza, 2007;\nS. D. Ryan & Groza, 2004). Transracial socialization and\ncultural competence have also received consideration (e.g.,\nments for transracial adoption parenting (Massatti, Vonk,\n& Gregoire, 2004) and ethnic socialization of adoptees\n(Mohanty, 2010). Later, adult adaptation of adoptees has also\nbeen explored (Altstein et al., 1994), and adoptive parental\nperceptions and satisfaction have been investigated (Bergquist\nable literature provides an interesting look into the way that\nresearch and recommendations of social workers have\nevolved as ICA became more prominent. It is impossible to\ntruly give a full overview of all the social work literature in\nthis particularly robust area; however, the selected highlights\nfocused on reform are provided within the following sub-\nthemes of cultural identity and child development concerns\nand caregiving strategies.\nCultural identity. Westhues and Cohen (1998) explore\ntrends in Canada and how changing attitudes have affected\nadoption-related policy. The authors use ICA as a way to\nexplore the challenges of promoting a national-level policy\nof multiculturalism and the balance required for accepting\nRotabi and Bunkers 9\nthe ethnicity and culture of the adopted child while recogniz-\ning and respecting the nonminority racial members of the\nfamily and community as well.

Research highlighted that U.S. adoptive families\nwho visited the child's country of origin prior to the adoption\ndemonstrated ethno-racial awareness that was positively cor-\nrelated with the adopted child's sense of security and ethno-\ncultural awareness. The authors strongly recommend that\nU.S. adoption agencies should \"encourage, support and\nfacilitate a visit to the adoptee's country of origin\" as a means\nof promoting an ethno-racial awareness of the child's\nbirth country by members of the adoptive family as well as\n\"encouraging strong ethnic identity formation in adopted\nchil\ntion is also promoted in Hollingsworth's (2008) exploration\nof the HCIA and issues of cultural identity. Social workers\ninvolved in adoption work are encouraged to share infor-\nmation, research, and interventions related to cultural iden-\ntity in an effort to support and promote knowledge about\nidentity development among adoptive parents (Holling-\nChild development concerns and caregiving strategies.Agreat\ndeal of social work literature highlighting child development\nconcerns in ICA (e.g., attachment issues) has focused pri-\nmarily on children being placed into ICAfrom Romania. The\nseverity of institutional care the majority of Romanian chil-\ndren experienced pre-ICA provided fertile ground for explor-\ning lasting effects of institutionalization. Several studies\nexplore the link between parent\u00adchild relationship satisfac-\ntion and consistent predictors of child emotional and behav-\nioral strength (Pearlmutter et al., 2008).\nRoberson (2006) in her literature review on attachment\nand caregiving behavior systems in ICA explores what kind\nof caregiver strategies supported successful adjustment of the\nadopted child into the family and encouraged secure attach-\nment. Issues related to institutional care prior to placement\nare explored, and several longitudinal studies on the effect of\nthis type of care on long-term social and health issues are\nidentified (Roberson, 2006). Responsive and flexible parent-\ning is related to attachment security. Roberson recommends\nthat the identification of and knowledge about key protective\nfactors are important for social workers practicing ICA.\nThis strengths-based perspective is consistently found in\nGroza's scholarship, a prolific body of ICA research. For\nexample, Groza and colleagues (Pearlmutter et al., 2008)\nfound that the relationship that adoptive children have with\ntheir adoptive parents is the greatest key to understanding\nparental perception of the current level of executive func-\ntioning. The ability to identify these potential strengths in\nthe adoptive family as well as to prepare and support par-\nents regarding their own expectations of the adopted child\nis an essential trait for social workers to have (Groza, Ryan\nresearch on Romanian adoptees, explored by S. D. Ryan and\nGroza (2004), found that although children being placed\nfrom institutional care might be traumatized and suffer notice-\nable developmental and cognitive delays, the strength of the\nparent\u00adchild relationship can positively alter these effects (S.\nD. Ryan & Groza, 2004). Providing information, helping par-\nents develop strategies to manage and decrease behavior\nissues or problem areas, and recognizing unrealistic expecta-\ntions are issues that social workers must address in the home\nstudy and preparation phases of adoption.
