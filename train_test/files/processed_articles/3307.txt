Although\nsharing data is considered a best practice, the barriers to doing so are considerable and there is a need for guidance and\nexamples. To that end, the authors of this article reviewed the articles in this special issue to identify challenges common\nto the five countries and to offer some practical advice to assist researchers in navigating this \"uncharted territory,\" as\nsome termed it. Concerns around informed consent, data management, data dissemination, and validation of research\ncontributions were cited frequently as particularly challenging areas, so the authors focused on these four topics with the\ngoal of providing specific resources to consult as well as examples of successful projects attempting to solve many of the\nproblems raised.\n",

But data sharing is not yet firmly established in all\ndisciplines and countries, and it can be especially challeng-\ning for research conducted in middle- and low-income\ncountries where the culture of data sharing is just beginning\nto gain traction. The articles in this issue discuss attitudes\ntoward data sharing in Kenya, India, Vietnam, South Africa,\nand Thailand and serve to highlight the salient challenges\nsurrounding data sharing in countries with limited resources.\nAt the same time the articles touch on the potential ben-\nefits of making data available for reuse. Widely acknowl-\nedged benefits cited in the articles include the generation of\nevidence that might lead to positive interventions for the\nlocal populations, increased transparency and accountabil-\nity, avoidance of duplication of effort, and encouragement\nof learning (Hate et al., 2015). The opportunity for reputa-\ntional benefits to accrue to the researcher and research\ngroup was another impetus for sharing data (Cheah et al.,\nAlthough these benefits were seen as compelling by the\nstakeholders interviewed, the complications involved in\nsharing data openly and actually putting transparency prin-\nciples into practice often appeared daunting and seemed to\noutweigh the advantages. Some common themes emerged\nas communities wrestled with data sharing requirements.\nMost of the authors acknowledged the potential for exploi-\ntation of the local population and other forms of harm that\nmight affect research participants, including loss of privacy.\nMost also cited issues around informed consent, including\nquestions about the rights of research subjects and potential\nbenefits to the local community (Denny, Silaigwana,\net al., 2015). Other barriers included the time and effort it\ntakes to make data ready for sharing, and the lack of per-\nceived validation and recognition for researchers and the\nresearch team for their efforts. All mentioned the need for\npolicies, frameworks, and examples related to data sharing\nas clear paths to follow were often lacking.\nFortunately, as a result of recent open access mandates,\nthe global research community is devoting substantial\nthought to guidance in the area of data sharing, and we are\nseeing some positive examples of data sharing practices and\nprocedures that can be emulated. One such example,\ndescribed in this issue of the Journal of Empirical Research\non Human Research Ethics, is the International Network for\nthe Demographic Evaluation of Populations and Their\n1Institute for Social Research, Inter-university Consortium for Political\nand Social Research (ICPSR), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMary Vardigan, Institute for Social Research, Inter-university Consortium\nfor Political and Social Research (ICPSR), University of Michigan, P.O.\nEmail: vardigan@umich.edu\nAddressing Global Data Sharing Challenges\nGeorge C. Alter1 and Mary Vardigan1\n Keywords\ndata sharing, informed consent, open science, privacy of human subjects, data repositories\n318 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 10(3)\nHealth (INDEPTH), a global network of research centers in\nAfrica, Asia, and Oceania that has established a data reposi-\ntory to enable sharing of fully documented, high-quality\ndata sets (Herbst et al., 2015). The INDEPTH approach pro-\nvides solutions to some of the widely encountered barriers\nto data sharing.\nOur organization, the Inter-University Consortium for\nPolitical and Social Research (ICPSR), has addressed many\nof these challenges over the course of its 50+ year history,\nand in providing access to social and behavioral science\ndata to researchers and instructors around the world, we\nhave learned what works and what does not and which\ntypes of resources are the most helpful to promote data\nsharing. Although we cannot say we have solved all of the\nproblems raised in this issue, we have achieved some good\noutcomes and seek to share that experience to support oth-\ners in moving forward with data sharing. We believe that\nopenness and data sharing ultimately lead to better science,\nand thus our observations are oriented toward providing\naccess as widely as possible.\nIn this article, we take up some of the barriers noted by the\nauthors in this issue, in order of their occurrence in the\nresearch data life cycle: informed consent, data management,\ndata dissemination, and validation of contributions. We pro-\nvide comments and suggestions which we hope are of value\nto colleagues in low- and middle-income countries as they\naddress the challenges during these phases of the work. We\nclose with sections on best practices and educational implica-\ntions and offer relevant resources for further review.\nInformed Consent\nIssues around the consenting process arose in all of the arti-\ncles, and indeed, this is a critical component of health\nresearch with many associated ethical dimensions. The\nCouncil for International Organizations of Medical Sciences\n(CIOMS), in collaboration with the World Health\nOrganization, provides a published set of International\nEthical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving\nHuman Subjects, which are recognized as universally appli-\ncable. These 21 guidelines, developed and revised over sev-\neral decades, constitute an excellent foundational resource\nfor researchers in low-resourced countries. According to the\nguidelines, informed consent processes involve three key\nfeatures: (a) disclosing to potential research subjects infor-\nmation needed to make an informed decision; (b) facilitat-\ning the understanding of what has been disclosed; and (c)\npromoting the voluntariness of the decision about whether\nor not to participate in the research. Ensuring that the\ninformed consent process fulfills these requirements can go\na long way toward mitigating problems that arise, but the\nneed for sufficient detail in addressing each component of\nthe process is paramount. With respect to the third feature,\nfor example, what if a participant opts into the study but\nwants to retract data later? Prospective research participants\nneed a clear explanation of when in the course of the study\nthey can opt out. The consent statement must include suffi-\ncient detail to engender trust in the process.\nSimilarly, several of the articles indicated the need for\nclarity around benefits to the community from whom data\nwere collected: How will the community benefit from the\nresearch? Will specific interventions be implemented as a\nresult of the research? Clarity around the purpose and likely\noutcome of the data collection is essential. To this point, the\n[I]n general, the research project should leave low-resource\ncountries or communities better off than previously or, at least,\nno worse off. It should be responsive to their health needs and\npriorities in that any product developed is made reasonably\navailable to them, and as far as possible leave the population in\na better position to obtain effective health care and protect its\nown health.\nSome research is undertaken with the express goal of ben-\nefiting a community. Phillips, Nyonator, Jones, and\nRavikumar (2008) describe how research programs in Ghana\nand Bangladesh produced results that were scaled up to\nnational public health interventions. Communities in research\nprojects may receive greater attention from medical person-\nnel and earlier implementation of life-saving technologies,\nand they may benefit in indirect ways as well, such as gaining\na sense of usefulness. In general, making the data as open as\npossible encourages more science and provides more oppor-\ntunities for communities to learn about themselves.\nAnother important point to keep in mind when develop-\ning the consent process is making sure that the agreement\npermits data sharing after the data are collected. ICPSR has\ndeveloped specific guidance on this topic to help research-\ners with language that protects and respects the confidenti-\nality of participants and yet allows for sharing of the\nresulting data with the broader scientific community\n(ICPSR, n.d.-a).\nCommercialization of research findings is often seen as\na threat to research participants who believe they should\nshare in any financial gain, and this was touched on in the\narticles. There is a tension between academically oriented\nscience, which rewards researchers for openness, publica-\ntion and priority of discovery, and commercially oriented\nR&D, which views information as proprietary (David,\n2014). However, the boundary between academic and com-\nmercial research is often blurred, and private firms often\nfinance vital studies. Participants in research studies have a\nright to know whether the data that they provide will be\nopen or limited for commercial reasons. Again, researchers\nshould be clear about how and with whom data will be\nshared and the likely outcomes of the study at the time of\nconsent.\nData Management\nAuthors of the articles emphasize the amount of time and\nwork that is required to make data ready for deposit and\nsharing, including the effort involved in preparing com-\nprehensive documentation. This work is critical because\na data set should be documented well enough for a poten-\ntial analyst to understand and interpret it effectively\nwithout consulting the original data collector. At ICPSR,\nwe have found that if data are managed well from the\nstart of the project and active data curation and documen-\ntation take place as the data set comes into existence, the\nneed for intensive work just before sharing is greatly\ndecreased.\nThe case of the INDEPTH program is also instructive\nhere. INDEPTH is making great strides in equipping data\nmanagers with resources to manage and document data\nacross the data life cycle. The resources include the\nNesstar Publisher (n.d.) software, a metadata markup\ntool that creates structured documentation according to\nthe Data Documentation Initiative (DDI; n.d.) standard.\nUsing Nesstar Publisher, one can document data at both\nthe study and variable levels efficiently, and because the\nmarkup is standardized, interoperability is enabled. The\nactual data set production for INDEPTH takes place dur-\ning joint data management workshops attended by data\nmanagers and analysts from the participating INDEPTH\nsites where common data processing procedures are\napplied and data quality metrics are calculated. Data are\nalso evaluated for disclosure risk during these sessions.\nThis kind of collaborative work leads to higher data\nquality.\nThis attention to metadata is the result of a concerted\nINDEPTH policy, which was necessary because many\nprojects in low- and middle-income countries have diffi-\nculty managing and documenting the data that they col-\nlect. Data management and documentation are actually\nuniversal challenges, and support for these activities has\ntraditionally been difficult to secure. Indeed, many\nrespondents in the studies on data sharing asked how they\ncould access resources to enable them to manage data\nappropriately.\nWe believe strongly that sponsors should pay for good\ndata management from the beginning and not just for the\ncost of collecting the data, as the INDEPTH example dem-\nonstrates. Sponsors need to be cognizant that if data are not\nadequately stewarded and curated, they may not be share-\nable, and the potential for further research to benefit the\ncommunity as well as their initial investment in the data\nwill be lost. Research sponsors should be more assertive\nabout requiring data management plans that include\nresources for documenting, preserving, and sharing the data\nthat they are funding. Active curation is the best way to\nmaximize sponsors' investment in the data.\nData Dissemination\nAuthors of the articles in this issue indicate that some\nresearch participants feared that their data would end up in\nthe wrong hands and harm would come to them as a result.\nThis is understandable as data sharing is not yet common-\nplace and trust in such processes is established slowly. The\ninformed consent pledge can address some of this trepida-\ntion by providing assurance that investigators will take\nevery effort to protect individual identities. In addition,\nmost of the authors recommended some type of controlled\naccess to the final data rather than completely open access.\nICPSR takes the risk of disclosure of individual identities\nin data very seriously, and the organization has developed a\nsignificant strength in this area. In particular, we have\ndefined procedures for de-identifying/anonymizing data to\ncreate public-use files for wide access (ICPSR, 2012). These\nprocedures generally involve data masking and recoding,\nwhich are undertaken in consultation with the original inves-\ntigator. When it is not possible to create a public-use file\nbecause the analytic potential of the data set will be compro-\nmised, ICPSR has developed alternative means of providing\naccess to the data. These include a spectrum of solutions\nfrom secure data download with a legal agreement on data\nuse to analysis in a virtual data enclave to highly restricted\naccess in an on-site physical data enclave at ICPSR. The\nimportant thing is for the level of data sensitivity to be\nmatched with the appropriate dissemination mechanism\n(ICPSR, n.d.-b). These sorts of controlled-access solutions\nmay be of interest for research programs in middle- and low-\nincome countries, and we provide a range of options below.\nOpen Access\nExcept for attribution of origin, no conditions or prior reg-\nistration are applicable to the use of the data. At ICPSR,\nmany government-funded studies are available without\nregistration.\nLicensed Access\nData repositories often require users to register and agree to\nterms of use, which may prohibit re-identification of sub-\njects and redistribution of the data.\nRestricted Licensed Access\nWhen the risk of disclosing confidential information is\nsmall but not negligible, data repositories often require data\nuse agreements with additional safeguards. Prospective\ndata users must submit data security plans and agree not to\npublish tables or statistics that might disclose confidential\ninformation. The data are transferred to the user in a secure\nway after agreements have been approved and signed.\n320 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 10(3)\nSecure Remote Access\nWhen data are highly sensitive or individually identifiable,\ndata repositories now use technologies to limit the risk of\ndata disclosure. Remote execution systems allow researchers\nto submit program code, which is run by staff at the reposi-\ntory. Virtual data enclaves allow users to work on a computer\nat the repository using secure remote access technologies. In\nboth cases, the repository staff reviews output before it is sent\nto the user, and the data never leave the repository.\nData Enclaves\nThe most sensitive data are available to prospective users\nonly through controlled on-site access at an approved data\ncenter.\nAlthough access restrictions are applied to protect confi-\ndential data, metadata describing sensitive data are nor-\nmally available online to allow researchers to discover the\ndata. Documentation rarely poses a risk to subjects, and the\nICPSR online catalog (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsr-\nweb/ICPSR/index.jsp) includes study descriptions and vari-\nable information describing restricted data. Sometimes\ndocumentation includes copyrighted instruments, such as\nbatteries of questions, and care must be taken to protect\nthose rights.\nValidation of Research Contributions\nConcerns were expressed in the articles that researchers\nmight not receive appropriate recognition for their work,\neither because data sets were not considered of the same aca-\ndemic caliber as research articles or because researchers who\nshared their data might be \"scooped\" by others who could\npublish first on a given topic. Fortunately, while treating data\nsets as first-class intellectual objects, akin to articles in peer-\nreviewed journals, is a relatively new idea, it has gathered\nmomentum quickly over the past few years. Increasingly,\nthere is a call for data to be part of the promotion and tenure\nprocess as well, on a par with peer-reviewed articles.\nThe key to providing recognition to data producers is\ncitation. Journals should cite data in a consistent manner\nidentifying the data producer and the location where the\ndata are accessible. This requires cooperation of a number\nof parties. Data producers should put their data in reposito-\nries that provide curation and preservation services.\nRepositories should assign and display a recommended\ncitation for the data. Journals should require authors to cite\ndata and provide guidelines with examples of appropriate\nformats. Authors should include data citations that conform\nto journal guidelines.\nAn important step toward data citation was the establish-\nment in 2010 of an international organization called DataCite\n(n.d.), which has encouraged the citation of data and has\ndeveloped a system of registering persistent identifiers for\ndata.1 Another international organization called Force11\n(n.d.) has developed a set of eight Data Citation Principles\nthat have been endorsed by more than 90 organizations.\nRecently, a meeting organized by the Berkeley Initiative for\nTransparency in the Social Sciences, SCIENCE Magazine,\nand the Center for Open Science produced \"Guidelines for\nTransparency and Openness Promotion in Journal Policies\nand Practices\" (Center for Open Science, 2015). The first\nsection of the guidelines provides advice to journals on data\ncitation standards.\nAs journals move to new requirements for access to data\nused in publications, there is general agreement that\nresearchers who create new data have a legitimate expecta-\ntion to publish before the data are shared. Most journals and\nprofessional associations require that data are accessible at\nthe time of publication, but some allow an \"embargo\"\nperiod of up to a year. Data repositories, such as ICPSR, are\nwilling to delay the release of data for a reasonable amount\nof time.\nBest Practice Examples\nWe are now seeing significant and rapid transformations of\nthe research data landscape, prompting the need to share\nknowledge and resources globally to support our common\nendeavor. We provide here two examples related to promot-\ning data sharing in low- and middle-income countries.\nInternational Household Survey Network (IHSN)\nThe IHSN (n.d.) is an informal network of international\nagencies that operates solely on the basis of voluntary con-\ntributions from its members. The IHSN seeks to develop\nand disseminate guidelines, standards, and best practices\nrelated to all stages of survey implementation: survey plan-\nning and integration, survey methods and assessments, data\ncuration, survey cataloguing, and microdata dissemination.\nA virtual secretariat, comprised of members of the World\nBank, Development Data Group (WB-DECDG), and\nPARIS21 Consortium Secretariat, coordinates the IHSN\nand is responsible for the day-to-day management and\nadministration of the IHSN work program.\nThe IHSN does not provide technical or financial sup-\nport, but coordinates its activities with the Accelerated Data\nProgram (ADP; n.d.), which supports the implementation\nof international best practices of survey design and data\narchiving in low- and middle-income countries. The ADP\nwas launched in 2006 as a recommendation of the Marrakech\nAction Plan for Statistics (MAPS) to undertake urgent\nimprovements in survey programs for monitoring the\nMillennium Development Goals. The ADP supports data\nproducers and users in developing countries by helping\nthem make better use of existing data and aligning survey\nprograms and statistical outputs to priority data needs. The\nADP concentrates on sample household surveys, which\nprovide estimates of many key outcome indicators, as well\nas data needed for research and impact evaluation. TheADP\nis increasingly focusing on other types of unit-level data,\nincluding censuses and administrative data. The ADP takes\nadvantage of tools and guidelines developed or provided by\nthe IHSN and is currently supporting agencies in more than\n60 countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America,\nand the Caribbean. The IHSN provides a portal to useful\nguidelines related to all stages of survey implementation.\nAn ICPSR Partnership for Data Archiving\nICPSR is exploring ways to support colleagues in less well-\nresourced countries in promoting data sharing. Recently, we\nworked with the Centre for Data Archiving, Management,\nAnalysis and Advocacy (C-DAMAA) at the University of\nCape Coast (UCC) in Ghana. With funding from the\nUniversity of Michigan'sAfrican Social Research Initiative,\nICPSR partnered with DataFirst (n.d.), a data service at the\nUniversity of Cape Town in South Africa, to advise and\ntrain staff at C-DAMAA. University of Michigan funding\nmade it possible for SamuelAnnim, Director of C-DAMAA,\nto attend workshops at ICPSR in the summer of 2014 and to\nwork with ICPSR staff on archiving data sets produced by\nUCC faculty, which are available in a C-DAMAA series\n(http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/346)\nin the ICPSR data catalog. During the winter of 2015,\nICPSR sent a staff person to UCC to train C-DAMAA staff\nto use ICPSR systems for data curation. Lynn Woolfrey,\nmanager of DataFirst, was particularly helpful in advising\nC-DAMAA about establishing productive relationships\nwith government administrative and statistical agencies.\nICPSR staff are currently developing a resource guide to\nhelp new data centers to understand the policies and pro-\ncesses needed for a data archive. This guide will be avail-\nable in Fall 2015 in the form of an online presentation with\na rich set of links to useful resources.\nSustaining Data Repositories\nAs noted above, the best way to increase the benefits from\ndata collection is to make data and thorough documentation\navailable to other researchers. Trusted data repositories play\na critical role in assuring that data remain accessible and\navailable for future generations of scholars. A key challenge\nhere is the cost of archiving data and the lack of sustainable\nbusiness models for this activity. Sponsors and journals are\nincreasingly requiring data sharing, but funding to ensure\nthat data are adequately managed and preserved is often\nlacking. Some countries devote national funding for this\npurpose, but in others data repositories are left to fend for\nthemselves often at the mercy of grant funding cycles,\nwhich do not assure sustained funding. There is concern in\nbiomedical circles that some valuable databases have\nalready been lost because funding ended.\nSeveral groups--including the Research Data Alliance,\nthe Center for Open Science, and professional associations,\nto name a few--are grappling with this issue, but many dis-\nciplines and communities do not have strategies for keeping\ndata available. Recently, with support from the Alfred P.\nSloan Foundation, ICPSR convened a meeting of 25 domain\nrepositories to discuss the pressing need for innovative\nfunding models for repositories. The group issued a Call for\nChange (ICPSR, 2013) and a white paper \"Sustaining\nDomain Repositories for Digital Data\" (Ember & Hanisch,\n2013) to focus attention on sustaining repositories. We\ninvite our colleagues from around the world to endorse the\nCall for Change to make sure that data resources are not\nlost.\nEducational Implications\nThis article highlights the need for education and training in\nvarious aspects of data stewardship. There is also a need for\ncomplementary capacity building as groups begin to put\ntheir knowledge into practice. Training should be available\nin a variety of formats and venues to ensure the widest dis-\npersion of knowledge.\nICPSR provides a series of Webinars, many of which\nrelate to data management and stewardship, and we main-\ntain a YouTube channel for on-demand access to the\nWebinars. There are other online training resources avail-\nable, including DataONE's Education Modules (https://\nwww.dataone.org/education-modules) and the University\nof Edinburgh's MANTRA training tool (http://datalib.\nedina.ac.uk/mantra/). Online training can be offered rela-\ntively cheaply, and Webinars can be recorded for later\nviewing.\nAs part of its Summer Program in Quantitative Methods\nof Social Research, ICPSR offers week-long courses on\ndata management for reuse. ICPSR's sister archives in\nEurope, which belong to the Consortium of European Social\nScience Data Archives, also offer such training. But we\nneed more programs such as INDEPTH and IHSN to pro-\nvide training where data are being collected.\nConclusion\nWhile global health inequalities make data sharing espe-\ncially challenging, at heart the concerns raised by research-\ners and community members in low- and middle-income\ncountries are very familiar. We encounter the same ques-\ntions when we speak to research communities in the United\nStates and other countries. Data archives have policies, pro-\ncedures, and technologies responding to these concerns,\n322 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 10(3)\nand we are committed to sharing what we have learned.\nWhen research projects plan for data sharing, they can\ndesign their plans with respect for research subjects and\nwith appropriate protections for the confidential informa-\ntion entrusted to them. After more than 50 years as a data\narchive, we at ICPSR are fully convinced that data sharing\nis one of the most effective ways to advance scientific\nresearch and to assure that the benefits derived from\nresearch data are realized as widely as possible.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nNote\n1. Persistent identifiers, such as Digital Object Identifiers\n(DOIs), connect data with the articles and other research prod-\nucts based on the data. Unlike URLs, which often become\nobsolete as computer systems evolve, persistent identifiers\npoint to registries, such as DataCite, that are updated as URLs\nchange. Thus, a DataCite DOI will continue to function even\nwhen the data are moved to a new location.\nReferences\nAccelerated Data Program. (n.d.).
