    "abstract": "Abstract\nLow-income preseniors represent a vulnerable, often overlooked population facing multiple challenges related to finding\nand sustaining employment, limited financial resources, mental and physical health challenges, mobility issues, and ineligibility\nfor pensions and benefits for seniors. These issues make finding suitable, affordable housing particularly challenging when\ncompounded with limited affordable housing stock, thus increasing this population's risk for housing insecurity/homelessness.\nThis qualitative, exploratory study examined subsidized housing issues for low-income preseniors from the perspective of\nsubsidized housing providers (n = 16). Barriers for this population occurred within individual (limited financial resources;\ncomplex health, mental health, and disability issues; current unsafe/inadequate housing; and new immigrant status) and\nstructural (strict age cutoffs, inadequate safe/affordable housing supply, lack of information about the housing and service\nneeds of the population, and ineffective collaboration within the sector) domains. Policy changes at the provincial and federal\nlevels related to income support, availability of affordable housing supports, and immigration are recommended.\n",

Social\ndeterminants of health are the economic, social, and political\nconditions that affect health outcomes and are the underlying,\ncontributing factors of health inequities (World Health\nOrganization [WHO], 2008). Populations in need of subsi-\ndized housing are considered vulnerable as a consequence of\npoverty. Low-income preseniors, defined as those between 55\nand 64 years of age, represent a vulnerable and often over-\nlooked subpopulation at the interface between adult and older\nadult populations. Risk factors for low-income preseniors\ninclude multiple challenges related to finding and sustaining\nemployment, limited financial resources, mental and physical\nhealth challenges, mobility issues, and ineligibility for pen-\nsions and benefits for those aged 65 and older (McDonald,\nPloeg, Hayward, Woodward, & Johnston, 2008). These issues\nmake finding suitable, affordable housing particularly chal-\nlenging when compounded with limited affordable housing\nstock. The presence of individual complex risk factors com-\nbined with structural factors such as the lack of affordable\nhousing leave many in this age group vulnerable to housing\ninsecurity or homelessness (McDonald, Dergal, & Cleghorn,\n2007). Research from other subpopulations experiencing\nhomelessness (e.g., families) suggests subsidized housing as a\nprotective factor against future episodes of homelessness\nWeitzman, Shinn, Labay, & Williams, 1999). These factors\ncreate a strong impetus for exploring subsidized housing as a\nsuitable community housing option for this age group.\nAs a consequence of population aging, the Center for\nHousing Policy in the United States predicts an increase in\nthose most vulnerable, including people with a disability,\nwomen living alone, and minorities (Lipman, Lubell, &\nSalomon, 2012). They propose that a greater number of\n1University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada\n2Kerby Centre of Excellence, Calgary, Alberta, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nChristine A.

The Canada Mortgage and Housing\nCorporation (2000) noted that the demand for community\nhousing options rather than institutional care will increase as\na consequence of the aging population. The desire of many\nolder people to remain housed in independent living arrange-\nments in residential areas as long as they are able also high-\nlights the importance of community housing options.\nSubsidized housing with supports holds potential to prevent\nhomelessness, early nursing home admissions, or unneces-\nsary residential care for those aged 55 to 64.\nThere is a limited body of Canadian literature examining this\nissue; we identified five Canadian studies that focus on the\nhousing experiences of those aged 55 to 64 (Furlotte, Schwartz,\ndefinition of older adults in the literature is inconsistent and may\ntice challenges for examining the risk factors and needs of this\npopulation. This population, referred to as \"the gap,\" experi-\nences a unique form of ageism given their positioning between\nservices for adults and seniors (McDonald et al., 2006).\nComplex Risk Factors\nPreseniors experience multiple challenges in terms of hous-\nyears of age and older in Calgary and Toronto, collecting\ndata from a nonrandom survey of older adults in supportive\nhousing (n = 237), in-depth qualitative interviews with for-\nmerly homeless older adults (n = 53), and focus groups with\nservice providers formerly homeless older adults living in\nsupportive housing (n = 69). Participants reported that secur-\ning housing was critical in supporting health and wellness,\nbut more than housing was required to enhance health, well-\nbeing, and social inclusion. Identified barriers included lim-\nited housing options, ageism specific to the \"gap\" (age\n50-64), and insufficient financial/employment supports.\nInformants noted a need for integrated service delivery and a\nrange of support options. The study recommended increased\naccess to age appropriate, affordable housing options with\nthe necessary social and health supports, as an important fac-\ntor in improving health and well-being outcomes.\nIn a large urban city located in Southwestern Ontario, Ploeg\net al. (2008) evaluated a Homeless Intervention Program\n(HIP) that targeted persons of low-income, homeless individu-\nals or those vulnerable to housing instability aged 54 and older.\nThey examined HIP records of clients (n = 129); conducted\nthree focus groups with service users (n = 5), housing provid-\ners (n = 8), and program providers and administrators (n = 4);\nand completed individual interviews with funders (n = 3), pro-\ngram providers and administrators (n = 6), and service admin-\nistrators (n = 4). Forty-seven percent of participants aged 54 to\n64 noted a lack of employment, ineligibility for old age\nbenefits, and inability to work or participate in \"employment\nrelated welfare initiatives\" due to substance use or poor health\nneeds related to health, mental health, and housing among\nolder adults with histories of homelessness or housing\ninsecurity.\nLack of Affordable Housing\nInsufficient availability of affordable and subsidized housing\nhas been identified as a core policy issue (Calgary Homeless\nFoundation Community Action Committee, 2010). The dire\nshortage of affordable and supportive housing is recognized as a\nstructural factor in homelessness for older adults (Aubry,\net al., 2008). In addition, as those younger than age 65 are at the\ninterface of two subsidized housing groups, they face the lim-\nited subsidized housing available across the adult age spectrum.\nPloeg and colleagues (2008) noted that community housing for\nolder adults is in short supply and only a minority of older adults\nwho need housing are eligible. With limited housing options\navailable, they reported that older adults end up on lengthy wait-\ning lists where priority is given to certain subgroups of older\nadults (e.g., those living on the street or with histories of abuse).\nFurthermore, researchers emphasized the need for increased\naffordable housing that is age appropriate (Furlotte et al., 2012;\nolder adults (aged 52-67) with HIV/AIDS seeking housing in\nOttawa. Participants identified significant concerns related\nto food and housing insecurity, medical costs, stigma and\nacceptance within retirement homes or nursing homes related\nto sexual orientation, or use of alternative therapies (use of\nmarijuana for pain control) and the heightened risk to health\nas a consequence of being exposed to germs and illnesses\nwithin homeless shelters.\nDrawn from a national Canadian sample, McLeod and\nWalsh (2014) examined the shelter experiences of women\n(n = 8) who became homeless for the first time after age 50\nliving in shelters in Vancouver, Calgary, Montreal, and\nHalifax. Widowhood, family breakdown, substance use,\nrapid deterioration of health, interpersonal conflict, and\nfinancial issues were among the causes of homelessness\nidentified by older women in the study. The authors highlight\nthe importance of gender-specific preventive measures to\nkeep older women housed, as more women become home-\nless in later life than men and their trajectories into home-\nlessness differ from their male counterparts.\nVulnerable to Housing Instability or\nHomelessness\nThe definition of \"homeless\" varies among studies and may\ndiffer from participants' perspectives on what it means to be\nhomeless. In Calgary, those aged 45 to 64 comprised a\nWalsh et al. 3\nsignificant proportion (35%) of the homeless population,\n42% of whom resided in emergency shelters, 27% in short-\nterm supportive housing, 10% system homeless, and 38%\nrough sleepers (Calgary Homeless Foundation [CHF], 2012).\nDifferent levels of support are required to maintain inde-\npendent living for older adults based on a number of factors\nincluding their history of homelessness or housing insecurity\nattention to older persons experiencing homelessness is nec-\nessary due to their susceptibility to abuse, greater rates of\nmental and physical illness, and ineligibility for seniors' pro-\ngrams or benefits. Gonyea, Mills-Dick, and Bachman (2010)\nsuggested that older adults with histories of homelessness\nmay be functionally older than their chronological age.\nWhile attention to older adult homelessness is increasing,\nlittle research on outreach or supportive housing programs\nfor this population exists (Gonyea et al., 2010). Due to the\ncomplex risk factors, lack of affordable housing, and the\neffects of homelessness on this age group, knowledge about\nthe accessibility of subsidized housing for preseniors is\nnecessary.\nConcern about adequate subsidized housing for the popu-\nlation of preseniors was initially identified by frontline staff\nof a housing office of a large center for adults aged older\nthan 50 in Calgary. Over a 2-year period, frontline staff doc-\numented a high number of inquiries from low-income adults\nbetween 50 and 64 years of age. Anecdotally, they reported\nthat callers identified substantial difficulty finding afford-\nable or subsidized housing and often expressed great\ndesperation in seeking support and resources. Although pre-\nliminary tracking data from the housing office suggested a\nrelatively high proportion of preseniors were experiencing\ndifficulty finding subsidized housing in Calgary, little infor-\nmation was available to ascertain their specific housing and\nassociated service needs, and the practice of the subsidized\nhousing sector related to servicing this population was not\nwell understood.\nAs a first step in addressing this issue, the center for older\nadults hosted a meeting for managers from the subsidized\nhousing sector to explore issues related to older adults during\nwhich concern about the subsidized housing situation for\npreseniors in Calgary was identified. In addition, the extent\nto which existing housing practices and policies were able to\naddress the specific, multiple, and complex needs of this\ngroup and the resultant potential for heightened risk of hous-\ning insecurity and homelessness among this population were\nnoted as problematic. Participants identified the need for fur-\nther research to explore the specific needs of low-income\npreseniors who they viewed as at heightened risk for \"falling\nthrough the cracks\" in terms of access to subsidized housing\nand related supportive services.\nUnderstanding subsidized housing experiences for this age\ngroup is a challenging undertaking requiring insights from a\nvariety of stakeholders, including housing managers; front-\nline staff handling requests, intake, and referrals; decision\nmakers; and importantly older adults seeking housing. In this\nstudy, we sought to explore subsidized housing issues for\nlow-income preseniors from the perspective of subsidized\nhousing providers to provide a foundation for subsequent\nresearch that would include perspectives of other relevant\nstakeholders. The objectives of the study were to obtain per-\nspectives of subsidized housing representatives related to\nhousing issues, current policies and practices, challenges and\ngaps in accessibility, recommendations for change, and col-\nlaboration opportunities.\nThe following research questions were developed based\non knowledge gaps identified at the housing sector meeting:\nResearch Question 1: What are the demographic charac-\nteristics of people requesting housing but not placed?\nResearch Question 2: What is policy with regard to\naccepting those aged 55 to 64 in seniors' subsidized\nhousing?\nResearch Question 2a: How many management compa-\nnies accept requests for housing from preseniors?\nResearch Question 2b: Which management companies\naccept preseniors on the waitlist? If so, how many are on\nwaitlists and for what length of time?\nResearch Question 3: What are the challenges and gaps\nmanagement companies are facing in addressing the\nneeds of this population and what are recommendations\nfor practice and policy change?\nResearch Question 4: To what extent is this sector col-\nlaborating to address subsidized housing for this\npopulation?\nIt was anticipated that by exploring the context of prese-\nniors housing issues and engaging the sector in discussions\nabout these issues, the unique housing challenges faced by\nthis group could be identified, and policy and practice rec-\nommendations made toward mitigating the risk of homeless-\nness for this vulnerable population.\nMethod\nThe study used a multiple-method qualitative, exploratory\napproach to investigate the subsidized housing issues for\nlow-income preseniors from the perspective of subsidized\nhousing providers. The institutional research ethics board\napproved the study research protocol and all participants\nwere volunteers who provided written informed consent.\nData Collection\nThree data collection methods were used: qualitative inter-\nviews, tracking of housing requests, and a focus group.\nInterviews.The purpose of the qualitative interviews was to\ninvestigate the process of macro practice and policy issues\nrelated to housing low-income preseniors in their specific\n4 SAGE Open\norganizational context. A directory of subsidized housing for\nseniors (aged 60 and older) and other resources identifying\nsubsidized housing sites were used to develop the sampling\nframe that ultimately comprised 21 managers representing 14\nsubsidized housing providers, 62 sites, and three individuals\nfrom the subsidized housing sector. All identified representa-\ntives were invited to an information session hosted by the\nKerby Center in January 2012 to introduce the project and\nsolicit participation; 16 representatives from the sector attended\nthe session. Subsequently, all representatives identified in the\nsampling frame were contacted by telephone and/or email to\ninvite them to participate in the study. Twelve managers and\nfour intake workers agreed to participate in the study represent-\ning 12 of the 14 identified subsidized housing providers.\nAn 11-item semistructured field guide that included ques-\ntions related to the nature of requests received for placement,\nformal and informal organizational policies and procedures\nregarding placing this population, challenges and gaps expe-\nrienced in addressing the subsidized housing needs of low-\nincome preseniors, and recommendations for practice and\npolicy change was used for the interview.\nInterviews, lasting between 30 and 60 min, were con-\nducted in subsidized housing providers' offices between\nJanuary and April 2012. Interviews were audio recorded and\ntranscribed verbatim, with the electronic responses of one\nparticipant who preferred to respond to the questions elec-\ntronically, added to the data set.\nTracking.Interview participants were asked to provide a\nsummary of housing requests from low-income preseniors\nover a 2-month time frame to provide statistical estimates of\nthe housing need. Information was requested about the type\nof contact (e.g., telephone or walk-in), demographic profiles\nof those requesting housing (e.g., marital status, age, and\nincome), type of accommodation required, reason for seek-\ning housing, outcome of the contact (e.g., placement or refer-\nral details), and comments. As only five summaries were\nreceived, these data were not included in the analysis.\nFocus group. In June 2012, once the preliminary analysis was\ncompleted, all participants were invited to a focus group the\npurpose of which was to (a) review and discuss the prelimi-\nnary study findings, highlight priority areas, and identify any\nmissing details; (b) explore implications of the findings for\npractice and policy related to subsidized housing for low-\nincome preseniors; and (c) codevelop practice and policy\nrecommendations with a focus on collaborative actionable\nitems. Prior to the session, participants were provided with\nan electronic copy of the preliminary results of the study.\nFour participants representing four different housing provid-\ners attended the focus group.\nData Analysis\nQualitative data analysis and grounded theory techniques were\nused to analyze the interview and focus group transcripts\n(Strauss & Corbin, 1990). The analyzed process consisted of\n(a) open coding--breaking down, examining, comparing,\nconceptualizing, and categorizing data; (b) axial coding--\nassembling data in new ways by making connections between\ncategories; and (c) selective coding--selecting the core cate-\ngory in relation to other categories according to the objectives\nof the study (Bryman & Burgess, 1993). We used investigator\ntriangulation, with several members of the research team\ninvolved in the analysis process independently to check for\naccuracy in coding and consistency and in identifying themes,\nand methodological triangulation, through reviewing prelimi-\nnary interview findings during the focus group (Patton, 2002)\nFindings\nStudy findings produced one overarching theme--barriers\nfor low-income preseniors in accessing suitable housing.\nThis occurred within individual and structural domains. The\nindividual- and structural-level factors were each comprised\nof several subthemes. The following section describes each\ntheme and subtheme with illustrative quotes drawn from the\ntranscripts. While these barriers are presented as unique,\nindependent contributors to housing insecurity for low-\nincome preseniors on either the micro- or macro-spheres,\nthey are inextricably interrelated, often exacerbating the vul-\nnerability of this population to housing insecurity and other\nadversity. For example, the individual factor describing the\ncomplex needs of this population in terms of health, mental\nhealth, and disability is entwined within limited housing\noptions available to meet these specific needs.\nIndividual-Level Barriers\nIn terms of individual- or micro-level barriers, this popula-\ntion had limited financial resources, with often complex\nhealth, mental health, and disability issues, heightened vul-\nnerability related to their current unsafe and inadequate\nhousing, and new immigrant populations were noted at\ngreater risk.\nThe most commonly identified barrier for this population\nin accessing suitable housing was their extremely limited\nfinancial resources. The impoverishment of this population\ndirectly affected the housing that preseniors can obtain and\nmaintain, according to study respondents. \"They are paying\nway more than they can afford to. For example, they might\nbe onAISH [Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped],\nand they are paying Can$800 a month for rent,\" noted one\ninformant. Income is a requirement for subsidized housing\nand as one participant shared, \"people would say things like,\nit is hard for me because of my age, I am not on OAS [Old\nAge Security] yet, so I don't have stable money, and nobody\nwants me.\" While identified as an individual factor, the role\nof the government in providing adequate financial resources\nfor this age group was also noted among all study respon-\ndents. As one participant articulated, \"more financial support\nWalsh et al. 5\nfrom the government and/or different programs that can help\nthese seniors gain some financial support.\"\nPreseniors' low-income status was often complicated by\nother adverse circumstances related to mental and physical\nhealth issues and addictions. This, in turn, affected their abil-\nity to find suitable and affordable housing. As one respon-\ndent explained,\nA lot of them seem to have medical issues, they have got mental\nhealth issues; they have got substance abuse issues. Not all of\nthem, but obviously sometimes when you have those problems\nthat prevent you from being able to work it . . . limits your\nincome.\nSmoking also disqualified this population from accessing\nsubsidized housing; \"we don't have any smoking on our\nproperty as of July this year; so we have to do that just for the\nsafety of everyone.\"\nFurthermore, the multiple and complex support needs of\npreseniors necessary to sustain a successful housing place-\nment was typically beyond the mandate of housing manag-\ners. As one participant identified, \"they are coming to us\nolder, more frail, needing more health care supports . . . too\nmany complex issues without support systems.\"\nAs a consequence of their complex needs and the lack of\nappropriate housing to meet these needs, low-income prese-\nniors were frequently living in unsafe housing. Study partici-\npants noted that housing for this population presented\nphysical barriers, as one respondent described, \"Some of\nthem are downstairs and they can't do stairs . . . they are\ntrapped. I even had a guy in a wheelchair . . . in the base-\nment.\" Other informants described preseniors living in situa-\ntions where they felt unsafe or vulnerable: \"I don't like living\nwith lots people and that's the only way we can afford it and\nthat is a safety factor for me.\" Living in situations within\nwhich preseniors experienced physical, verbal, emotional, or\nfinancial abuse was described by participants as becoming\nincreasingly common.\nImmigrant preseniors were noted to be at particular risk\nfor housing insecurity if they do not meet Canadian resi-\ndency requirements of 10 years to be eligible for subsidized\nhousing or income support and are thus largely dependent on\nsponsors for support (Canadian Council for Refugees, 2013).\nThis dependency heightened older immigrants' vulnerabil-\nity: \"they feel they are mistreated, they feel they are not\nrespected, they have to ask for everything, they have to ask\nmoney for medications, they have to ask money and permis-\nsion for everything.\" In rare cases, exceptions are made to\nthe residency requirement when, for example, sponsorship\nbreakdown occurs.\nStructural-Level Barriers\nStructural- or macro-level factors played a critical role in the\nhousing insecurity low-income preseniors faced. Structural\nbarriers included strict age cutoffs, inadequate safe and\naffordable housing supply, dearth of information about this\npopulation and specifically regarding their housing and sup-\nport needs, and a lack of effective collaboration within the\nsector.\nThe primary structural barrier low-income preseniors\nfaced in accessing subsidized housing was the application of\nstrict age cutoffs to determine housing eligibility for seniors'\nhousing. Respondents noted that this resulted in this popula-\ntion being assigned a low priority in being accepted or wait-\nlisted for housing. In particular, age restrictions in seniors'\nsubsidized housing limited the ability of low-income prese-\nniors to secure housing in this setting. Preseniors are typi-\ncally turned away because of their age, as one participant\nelaborated, \"We do get a lot of calls from the late 50 age\nrange, and we just have to tell them, `unfortunately, no.'\"\nAnother concurred, \"We are pretty rigid. They need to be 65\nin order to qualify.\"\nParticipants identified some rare instances where individ-\nuals aged younger than 65 were placed in housing, primarily\nas a result of availability. As one participant explained,\nPreference [for subsidized housing] of course is given to 65\nplus. There are some other companies out there that will make\nan exception if they don't have a wait list. But that is not the case\nhere. We are pretty much always full. It doesn't take us long to\nturn over our suites when they come up . . . because we have a\nwait list, we do abide by that 65 plus.\nSimilar to this respondent, the majority of the subsidized\nhousing providers in the study identified that they typically\nhad waitlists comprised of seniors, which effectively elimi-\nnated preseniors from being considered. Subsidized housing\nproviders use a point system based on an assessment of need\nto determine waitlist and placement priority, with the major\ncontributor to the points being age--aged older than 60 or\n65. Respondents also noted that low-income preseniors were\neligible to apply for other subsidized housing not specifically\ndesignated for seniors; however, as this population is typi-\ncally without dependents, they are assigned a low priority on\nthese waitlists, as well.\nOthers noted that approval from the government was nec-\nessary before making any changes to existing policies, such\nas a change to the eligibility criteria. \"We wouldn't have the\nauthority to implement these changes. The changes have to\ncome from the government level.\" Another concurred, stat-\ning, \"if our management board wanted to go down to as low\nas [age] 50, I guarantee you we would have to provide some\nwritten information on how that is necessary with Alberta\nHousing before we got the go ahead.\"\nLack of appropriate and affordable housing was a major\nfactor implicated in the ability of low-income preseniors to\naccess and maintain housing. Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween income and availability of housing for preseniors\nwas identified as a major gap in service provision. As one\nrespondent commented, \"There is just no housing for them.\nThere is just nothing.\"\n6 SAGE Open\nFunding for additional housing was noted by informants\nas falling outside their mandate and within the auspices of\nthe provincial government. As one participant explained,\nThey need a tax base for the Province, so there we go with our\nCatch-22. As a mayor, I could come up with all sorts of practices\nthat are acceptable for 55 to 64, but if I am not given money\nfrom the Province, what am I going to do?\nTogether with the overall lack of housing for this popula-\ntion, participants recognized that even the limited options for\nsubsidized housing do not afford applicants personal choice\nabout what area of the city they would like to live. As an\nexemplar, an informant offered, \"There is not much subsi-\ndized housing in the South area. Many seniors would like to\nstay close to their kids and not many options are given.\"\nStudy participants identified a general lack of knowledge\nregarding the housing and associated service needs of this\npopulation. Although some participants noted that there\nappeared to be an emerging awareness of the issues faced by\npreseniors, it was recommended that more research was nec-\nessary to understand the specific housing needs of low-\nincome preseniors. As one housing representative described,\nPeople are waking up to the problem, being aware. This is\nsomething we need to deal with. It's getting out of control. The\nneed, the spark, the desire--it's all there. So, it's starting to\ncome together. I think there is still a lot more work to be done\nbut I think people are in a good place to do the work. Like right\nnow we are researching ideas to find out exactly what this\npopulation is experiencing.\nThe final structural barrier identified by the housing sec-\ntor managers was the lack of effective collaboration within\nthe sector. Study participants identified an overall lack of\ncollaboration within the housing sector. When asked about\nthe degree of collaboration, for example, one respondent\nstated, \"the housing sector? They are not\" and another simi-\nlarly advised, \"they're not . . . I just don't see any. This has\nbeen a problem for years and I just don't see any work being\nmade to bridge that gap.\" Another participant elaborated,\n\"We don't have contact with the other management groups.\nWe are all independent now. We meet informally, so I really\ndon't know what the policies and procedures are of the other\nmanagement groups.\"\nOthers expressed a lack of knowledge of any collabora-\ntive efforts, making comments such as, \"I don't really know\nmuch about what the sector is doing to collaborate,\" \"I don't\nknow. I really don't know,\" and \"I am not familiar with much\nthat is being done.\"\nRespondents articulated the need for collaboration within\nthe sector to, for example, \"come up with some kind of solu-\ntion.\" Similarly, another key informant suggested,\nAs a sector, there needs to be more planning together as a\nnetwork; more ways that we can find to connect the web. There\nneeds to be some discussion around the policies about what is\nfunded and what is not funded and re-visit all of that.\nIt was recommended that collaborative efforts should not\nbe limited solely to the housing sector and that the sector\nresponsible for seniors should be involved.\nParticipants identified that collaboration required \"fund-\ning for collaboration, funding for staff, more opportunity to\ninterface, more infrastructures that don't put the pressure on\nthe front and instead put it on the system for us to be able to\nwork more cohesively.\" Another impediment to collabora-\ntion related to the staff who were described as already over-\nworked and that collaboration \"takes time and nurturing and\nan allowance of space within their day to day.\"\nA few participants provided examples of existing collabo-\nrations, including \"front line really does a superb job given\nthe time and the limited resources and the limited [number\nof] people.\" Another participant noted,\nPeople are trying to come together. It's not fully integrated yet--\nit's not far. But people are waking up to the problem, being\naware. I think there is still a lot more work to be done but I think\npeople are in a good place to do the work.\nFinally, one participant suggested that, although limited,\nsome service providers and housing organizations were mobi-\nlizing to address the housing needs of preseniors in general,\nand specifically immigrant preseniors.\nDiscussion\nParticipants in the study portrayed how low-income prese-\nniors are falling through the cracks in accessing affordable,\nsafe, subsidized housing as a consequence of individual- and\nstructural-level barriers. In this study, the social determinants\nof health approach revealed how structural factors including\neconomic, social, and political conditions (WHO, 2008) of\nlow-income preseniors influence and interact with individual-\nlevel factors, such as mental health, physical health, substance\nuse, disability, and ethnicity, to shape individuals' needs and\nexperiences. These findings are consistent with those from\nsimilar studies in other Canadian cities (Furlotte et al., 2012;\nlevel barriers this subpopulation encounters enhance their\nvulnerabilities and intensify their risk for adversity in terms of\npoverty and homelessness. Study findings suggest individual\nand systemic barriers must be addressed to increase access to\nsubsidized housing for those in this age group as an important\nsocial determinant of health.\nIn this study, low income and impoverishment had severe\nramifications for preseniors. It made them ineligible for subsi-\ndized housing based on policies. In their study, Ploeg et al.\n(2008) also found the low-income levels of clients created a\nbarrier to securing the identified housing. Similarly, McDonald\nWalsh et al. 7\net al. (2006) described how the lack of affordable housing,\nlimited income levels, minimal employment supports, and the\ninfluence of homelessness and aging combined to create sig-\nnificant barriers for this population to successfully transition\ninto housing.\nMentalhealth,physicalhealth,substanceuse,ordisability-\nrelated needs of those requesting housing from this age group\noften exceeded the capacity of the supports available in their\nsubsidized housing units. The high level of needs combined\nwith the lack of existing support made it difficult for the\nmanagers to accept them into housing. McDonald et al.\n(2007) also noted that the health and social needs of this age\ngroup experiencing homelessness often exceed existing\nservices.\nFindings from this study support literature identifying\nthe multiple and complex health and social service needs of\nthis population in the context of considerable social\nvulnerability.\nThe Calgary Homeless Foundation Community Action\nCommittee's (2010) Seniors and Special Needs in Calgary\nreport identifies vulnerability within this population introduced\nby factors such as cultural diversity, physical and mental health,\nand disability. In a review of literature,Are\u00e1n et al. (2010) con-\ncluded that targeting interventions toward broader forms of\nsocial adversity such as poverty and homelessness was neces-\nsary to treat depression in older low-income adults. Crane and\nWarnes (2010) described the influence of inadequate nutrition,\nage, lack of health care, social isolation, and living environ-\nment on older adults'physical and mental health.\nThis study identifies new immigrants as at particular risk\nfor housing insecurity. While this relationship has been iden-\ntified in recent studies (see, for example, Walsh, Hanley, Ives,\n& Hordyl, 2015), the housing and service needs among older\nimmigrant adults have not been established. The Canadian\nrequirements of 10-year residency was also noted as com-\nplicit in the relationship between family sponsorship require-\nments of family-class immigrants and low income and\nhousing insecurity faced by older immigrants (Kaida & Boyd,\n2011). In addition, policy changes enacted at the provincial\nand federal levels related to income support, availability of\naffordable housing and supports, and immigration policies\naffecting low-income preseniors are warranted.\nIncreased communication and collaboration among the\nhousing and senior sector, and the necessary supports, is also\nindicated. In addition, facilitating access to appropriate hous-\ning for this population will require increased and effective\ncollaboration between general subsidized housing providers\nand seniors' subsidized housing providers with the end goal\nof streamlining services and application processes (e.g.,\nshared waitlist or central database) and establishing consis-\ntent and transparent evaluation strategies for prioritizing\napplicants.\nHousing older adults is more complex than housing\nyounger adults (Crane & Warnes, 2010; Gonyea et al.,\n2010) as older adults frequently require additional supports\nrelated to their high rates of mental and physical health\nproblems, substance dependence, or permanent disability.\nSupportive living environments are thus recommended\n(Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 2000;\nPloeg et al. (2008) identified the importance of continuity\nof service when working with older adults, meaning the\nsame service provider works to address housing and sup-\nport needs. In this study and others (e.g., McDonald et al.,\n2006), service providers emphasized the potential for con-\nflict in housing environments where diverse ages, needs,\nand rental arrangements exist, specifically residents who\nreceive services may be in conflict with residents who do\nnot receive services. In addition, other studies have articu-\nlated the specific housing requirements for populations\nwith HIV/AIDS (Furlotte et al., 2012). To this end, in the\nshort term, the seniors' subsidized housing sector should\nexplore options for providing or strengthening existing sup-\nports in existing subsidized housing units through commu-\nnity partnerships (e.g., social work, health or mental health\noutreach teams, community partnerships) to better support\nthe needs of this age group.\nGiven the limited body of literature on the housing and\nsupportive needs of this vulnerable subpopulation, low-\nincome preseniors, this study makes an important contribu-\ntion to knowledge building on this topic. Study findings and\nrecommendations may help to engage practitioners, decision\nmakers, policy makers, preseniors, and other stakeholders in\nconnecting, conversing, and collaborating about strategies\nrelated to addressing the subsidized housing needs of low-\nincome preseniors. Finally, the study directs us to further\nresearch and specifically research that examines the housing\nand supportive needs of low-income preseniors from their\nown perspective.\nLimitations\nThis study is limited to the opinions of a relatively small\nsample of housing service providers in one city in Western\nCanada, which precludes generalization to other settings. In\naddition, we were unable to gather a statistical profile of low-\nincome preseniors requesting access to subsidized housing,\nthus limiting our understanding of the characteristics of this\npopulation to the perspectives of the subsidized housing pro-\nviders. Nevertheless, we were able to interview at least one\nrepresentative from the majority of subsidized housing pro-\nviders in the city (12/14) and to verify the preliminary find-\nings and preliminary recommendations among a small group\nof subsidized seniors' housing service providers.\nWhile this study focused on the perspectives of subsidized\nhousing managers, it was limited to housing companies that\nprimarily housed seniors. As such, the perspectives of hous-\ning managers serving the general adult population were not\nincluded. Furthermore, the perspective of low-income prese-\nniors is of critical importance to understand this issue more\n8 SAGE Open\nfully. In the next phase of this research, we engage this popu-\nlation, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding\nof subsidized housing challenges and opportunities for this\ngroup of vulnerable adults.\nThe findings of this study can contribute to informing\npolicy development, supporting sector plans to end home-\nlessness, increasing awareness of the unique needs and chal-\nlenges faced by low-income preseniors, and potentially\nplaying a role in creating greater access to subsidized hous-\ning for this vulnerable population.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nThis study was funded by the Alberta Homeless Research\nConsortium.\nReferences\nAre\u00e1n, P., Mackin, S., Vargas-Dwyer, E., Raue, P., Sirey, J.,\nKanellopolos, D., & Alexopoulos, G.
