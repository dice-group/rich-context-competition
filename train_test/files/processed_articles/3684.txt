One aspect of this fear response is the automatic direction of visuospatial\nattention to the location of potential threat. Threatening facial expressions are important\nbiological indicators of danger that enhance spatial attention both in unrestricted (Pourtois,\nGrandjean, Sander, and Vuilleumier, 2004; Pourtois, Schwartz, Seghier, Lazeyras, and\nMasked threat modulates spatial attention\nBradley, 1999) processing conditions. However, facial stimuli are not the only significant\nsignals of threat in the environment. For example, poisonous and predatory animals such\nas snakes, spiders, and sharks can inflict bodily harm and are commonly feared or avoided.\nRestricted processing of threat images of this nature have been shown to enhance skin\nresponses. In unrestricted processing conditions these types of threat stimuli modulate\nspatial attention (Blanchette, 2006; \u00d6hman, Flykt, and Esteves, 2001). Yet, it is unclear if\nvisual threat related stimuli, other than facial expressions, elicit enhancements in spatial\nattention under restricted processing conditions, such as backward masking.\nBackward masking is a method in which the processing of visual threat stimuli can\nbe restricted. Previous research has demonstrated that fearful faces that are presented for 33\nms (or less) and immediately followed by a mask (neutral face) result in increased activity\nin the amygdala, superior colliculus, and thalamic pulvinar (Liddell et al., 2005; Morris et\nActivity in this same pathway has been observed in cortically blind patients (who do not\nexperience \"conscious vision\") while viewing unmasked fearful faces (Morris, DeGelder,\nWeiskrantz, and Dolan, 2001) suggesting this subcortical pathway supports crude visual\nfear processing. Additionally, research has shown that backward masked snakes and\nspiders enhance skin conductance responses (\u00d6hman and Soares, 1993, 1994) and elicit\namygdala (Carlsson et al., 2004) responses relative to neutral stimuli in snake or spider\nphobic individuals, respectively. Based on participants' objective and subjective behavioral\nmeasures, some studies have reported that stimuli presented in this manner are not\nconsciously processed (Glascher and Adolphs, 2003; Whalen et al., 1998). However, other\nfindings indicate that the degree of awareness varies across individuals (Pessoa, Japee, and\nUngerleider, 2005) and an individual's level of awareness modulates the amygdala\nresponse to fearful faces (Pessoa, Japee, Sturman, and Ungerleider, 2006). Therefore,\nwhile the degree to which backward masked stimuli are processed subliminally is still\ndebated, backward masking does restrict the amount of relative visual information\ncompared to unmasked visual stimuli.\nSeveral psychological theories argue for an evolutionarily prepared fear module,\nwhich is involved in automatically orienting attention to threat stimuli (LeDoux, 1996;\n\u00d6hman, Flykt, and Esteves, 2001; \u00d6hman and Mineka, 2001). Evidence for this model\ncomes from conditioning experiments that suggest phylogenetic or evolutionary relevant\nfear stimuli are more sensitive to fear conditioning and are more robust to extinction effects\n(\u00d6hman and Mineka, 2001). Several studies that have directly compared the spatial\nattention grabbing effects of unmasked phylogenetically and ontogenetically fear-relevant\nstimuli indicate that fear-relevant stimuli in general facilitate spatial attention (Blanchette,\nbackward masked fear-conditioned snakes and spiders have been shown to grab spatial\nattention (Beaver, Mogg, and Bradley, 2005). However, these phylogenetically relevant\nthreats were not compared to ontogenetically fear-relevant stimuli and it is unclear what\neffect evolutionary relevant fear stimuli not presented in a conditioning paradigm would\nhave on spatial attention. While \u00d6hman's (2001) evolutionary based theory allows for fear\nlearning and behavioral studies have shown conditioning-related spatial attention effects to\npreviously neutral stimuli (Koster, Crombez, Van Damme, Verschuere, and De Houwer,\n2005) and evolutionary relevant fear stimuli (Armony and Dolan, 2002; Beaver et al.,,\nMasked threat modulates spatial attention\n2005) it might be expected that under limited and restricted processing conditions that the\nevolutionary relevancy of a stimulus is more salient. That is, if backward masked fear\nstimuli are processed through an evolutionarily older subcortical route, one might expect a\npreference for phylogenetically, compared to ontogenetically, relevant threats under\nrestricted processing conditions. Indeed, this \"older\" subcortical amygdala, pulvinar, and\nsuperior collicular network is hypothesized to specifically have evolved for the rapid\nprocessing of and response to venomous snakes (Isbell, 2006). Therefore, it may be\nexpected that crude representations of phylogenetically and ontogenetically fear-relevant\nstimuli would differentially influence behavior under the restricted processing conditions of\nbackward masking.\nWhile fearful faces have been shown to enhance spatial attention under restricted\nprocessing conditions (Carlson and Reinke, 2008; Fox, 2002), it is unclear if this threat\nrelated facilitation of spatial attention extends to other types of visually threatening stimuli,\nsuch as snakes, spiders, guns, and knives. Furthermore, it is unclear as to whether fear\nmodulated spatial attention in restricted processing conditions is sensitive to the\nevolutionary relevancy of threatening stimuli. The purpose of the current experiment was to\naddress these issues by using evolutionary relevant and irrelevant threat images in the dot-\nprobe paradigm (see Figure 1). Each trial of the task consisted of two images (one\nthreatening and one neutral) simultaneously presented (33 ms) to the left and right of\nfixation and immediately masked by neutral images (100 ms). Participants then responded\nto a target dot appearing either on the left or right side of the screen, which could either be\nspatially congruent or incongruent with the threat image. It was predicted that threatening\ncompared to neutral images would modulate spatial attention. Specifically, reaction times\nwere predicted to be faster on congruent (target and threat image located at the same spatial\nlocation) compared to incongruent (target and threat image located on opposite sides of the\nscreen) trials. Additionally, given the theorized evolutionarily adaptive basis of this\nattentional response (LeDoux, 1996; \u00d6hman and Mineka, 2001), it was predicted that\nevolutionary relevant fear stimuli would enhance spatial attention to a greater degree than\nevolutionary irrelevant fear stimuli. That is, the facilitation of reaction times for congruent\ncompared to incongruent trials should be larger when the threat image is evolutionary\nrelevant rather than evolutionary irrelevant.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nThirty-two introductory psychology students from Southern Illinois University at\nCarbondale with normal or corrected to normal vision completed a dot-probe task for\npartial course credit. Participants were provided with informed consent and treated\naccording to the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board. Two participants were\nexcluded from data analysis for having poor overall task performance ( 86% correct).\nOverall accuracy scores for these participants were lower than two standard deviations (SD\n= 4%) from the group mean accuracy score (96% correct), which suggests that these\nparticipants were less compliant with task instructions. As noted in the results section the\nexclusion of these 2 participants did not influence the results. The final sample included 30\nparticipants (16 female, 14 male). Of these participants, three reported being left handed,\nwhile the remaining 27 participants reported that they were right handed.\nMasked threat modulates spatial attention\nStimuli and Material\nneutral from both evolutionary relevant (e.g., mushrooms and trees) and irrelevant (e.g.,\nfrom the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang, 1999) were used in the\ncurrent study. Comparisons between the normative valence and arousal ratings of the\nIAPS images validate our threatening (M valence = 3.18, M arousal = 5.89) vs. neutral (M\nvalence = 5.89, M arousal = 3.25) image categorization (ps < .05). Evolutionary relevant\nand irrelevant fear stimuli did not differ (ps > .10) in their overall arousal ratings (M\nirrelevant = 76.44). Examples of presumably evolutionary relevant fear stimuli consist of\nsnakes, spiders, and bugs, whereas knives, syringes, and guns are examples of evolutionary\nirrelevant fear stimuli. Sixteen additional neutral stimuli were chosen as masks from both\nevolutionary relevant (e.g., birds, bunny, trees, and shells) and irrelevant (e.g., basket, fan,\nwas programmed with E-Prime and displayed on a 60 Hz 16\" Dell computer monitor.\nResponses were made with an Electrical Geodesics Inc (EGI) response pad.\nFigure 1. Each trial of the dot-probe task began with a fixation cue in the center of the\nscreen for 1000 ms and was immediately followed by two images presented for 33 ms.\nThese images were masked with a neutral image for 100 ms.

The initial images were\nimmediately masked by a separate sample of neutral IAPS images for 100 ms (the same\nneutral image mask was presented on each side of the screen to prevent potential\nMasked threat modulates spatial attention\nasymmetrical mask biases). We do not claim that these backward masking procedures\nrendered the initial image subliminal or nonconscious per se, but did restrict the processing\nof the initial image (relative to unmasked images). Finally, the target dot appeared either on\nthe left or the right side of the screen and participants indicated as quickly as possible the\nlocation of the target dot, which remained on the screen until the participant responded.\nParticipants used their right index finger to indicate when the target appeared on the left\nside of the screen and right middle finger to indicate the target appeared on the right side of\nthe screen. Half of the initial threat images were spatially congruent with the target dot,\nwhile the other half were spatially incongruent (in this instance the neutral image precedes\nthe target). If the initial threat image automatically captures spatial attention (relative to the\ncompeting initial neutral image) then threat congruent trials should produce faster reaction\ntimes than incongruent trials. During each trial, the fixation cue remained in the center of\nthe screen throughout the entirety of the trial and participants were instructed to always\nfixate on this cue. The experiment began with a brief (15 trial) practice block followed by\nfive experimental blocks of 64 trials.\nResults\ncorrect responses between 100 and 750 ms were included in the analysis of reaction time\ndata, which therefore excluded incorrect (4%), premature (0.3%), and delayed responses\n(0.7%), respectively. Reaction time analyses were performed on the remaining 95% of the\ndata. An Evolutionary Relevancy (relevant vs. irrelevant) by Congruency (congruent vs.\nincongruent) by Visual Field (left vs. right) repeated measures analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) was conducted on participants' reaction time data. There was a significant effect\n2 = .15) where there were faster reaction times\nremained significant when the reaction time data for facial cues (angry and neutral) were\nincongruent: 345.6 ms. This suggests that threat stimuli other than faces capture spatial\nattention in restricted processing conditions. When poor performers were included in the\nanalysis the overall congruency effect still remained significant, F (1, 31) = 4.51, p < .05,\np\n2 = .13. The Evolutionary Relevancy by Congruency interaction failed to reach\n2 = .04). However, given our a priori hypothesis\nof a stronger congruency effect for evolutionary relevant threats, we performed follow up t-\ntests to further explore this effect. Evolutionary relevant threats resulted in significantly\nfaster reaction times on congruent compared to incongruent trials (p < .05). While a similar\npattern was found for evolutionary irrelevant threats, this difference did not reach\nsignificance (p > .05, see Table 1 for mean reaction times). The Congruency by Visual\nEvolutionary Relevancy by Visual Field and the Evolutionary Relevancy by Visual Field\nby Congruency interactions (F's (1, 29) < 1). These results suggest that backward masked\nthreatening images modulate spatial attention.\nMasked threat modulates spatial attention\nTable 1.

These results extend previous findings of enhanced\nspatial attention to masked threatening faces in highly trait anxious (Fox, 2002; Mogg and\nthis behavior is not solely associated with facial cues of threat, but includes other types of\nvisual threat as well. These attention effects were not influenced by evolutionary relevancy\nin the current study. That is, both evolutionary relevant (i.e., snake) and irrelevant (i.e.,\ngun) backward masked visual threat stimuli enhanced spatial attention.\nAlthough evolutionary relevancy did not influence spatial attention, certain images\nsuch as the striking snake and the aimed gun were more attention grabbing than others (see\nTable 2). Interestingly, both of these threats were directed towards (as opposed to away\nfrom) the observer. Previous research has revealed larger SCRs for backward masked\nimages of snakes and guns directed towards participants (Flykt, Esteves, and \u00d6hman,\n2007). Thus, observer directed threats may be more efficient in automatically eliciting\nspatial attention under restricted processing conditions. This is possibly due to the\nrelatively more immediate nature of directed threats, where a rapid automatic fear response\nwould greatly enhance an organism's likelihood of surviving such a threat. Given that the\nMasked threat modulates spatial attention\npresent study was not explicitly designed to address this issue, future research should\nexplore the role of crude directed vs. undirected threat on spatial attention.\nWe provide evidence that in addition to facial expressions other backward masked\nthreat-related visual stimuli are capable of eliciting enhancements in visuospatial attention.\nOur data provide a behavioral complement to physiological research revealing enhanced\nthese types of visual threat. Backward masked fearful faces appear to be processed through\na subcortical superior collicular, thalamic pulvinar, amygdala system (Liddell et al., 2005;\nenhance spatial attention through a neural network consisting of the amygdala, anterior\ncingulate, and visual cortex (Carlson, Reinke, and Habib, 2009). It is unclear whether these\nsame systems mediate the processing and facilitation of spatial attention to other types of\nbackward masked threat stimuli. Backward masked snakes and spiders have been found to\nelicit amygdala responses (Carlsson et al., 2004) and evolutionary theories claim that the\namygdala-pulvinar system specifically evolved in response to our ancestors' interactions\nwith venomous snakes (Isbell, 2006). It is believed that this system allows for rapid\ndetection and response to visual threats. However, future research is needed to determine\nthe complete neural system involved in mediating the spatial attention response to\nbackward masked non-face threat stimuli.\nEmotion processing theories claim rapid fear responses, based on little to no\nconscious knowledge of the eliciting stimulus, are evolutionarily advantageous, and\nenhance an organism's likelihood of survival (LeDoux, 1996; \u00d6hman and Mineka, 2001).\nHowever, in the current experiment both evolutionary relevant and irrelevant threats\nenhanced spatial attention, which suggests that while organisms may have an innate or\nbiological predisposition to direct attention towards crude representations of threatening\nstimuli, the types of stimuli that elicit this response can be evolutionarily or culturally\nrelevant. A rapid attentional response to culturally learned fear stimuli is consistent with the\nhuman amygdala's known role in fear conditioning or learning (Knight, Nguyen, and\nevolutionarily determined triggers of the fear response. However, it is also important, in our\never-changing world, to be able to learn or acquire culturally relevant fear triggers. While\nculturally relevant fear associations appear to be acquired through the amygdala (Knight et\nal., 2005), it is unclear whether crude representations of these types of fear stimuli would\ninteract with the spatial attention network. Our research suggests that learned triggers may\ninvolve the same spatial attention network given that backward masking, which results in\nlimited visual processing, did not differentially affect behavior for evolutionary or cultural\nfear stimuli.\nHowever, while in the current experiment there was not an evolutionary relevancy\nby congruency interaction, it is inappropriate to make strong conclusions from null results.\nMore research is needed in this area to better characterize the role of evolutionary\nrelevancy in automatic threat-elicited spatial attention. Additionally, the size of the threat-\nelicited attention effect in the current experiment was rather small. The 100 ms gap (mask\nduration) between the initial threat image and the target could partially account for this\nrelatively small overall congruency effect. That is, after 100ms the initial orienting of\nattention to the threat image may begin to be released or weakened. However, masked\nfearful face dot-probe studies with similar threat-to-target onset differences have revealed\nMasked threat modulates spatial attention\nlarger attention effects (e.g., Carlson and Reinke, 2008). Future research could use a\nmethodology where the target is included in the mask that immediately follows the cue and\nthus provide an immediate sampling of threat-elicited spatial attention.\nIn sum, we found that backward masked threatening visual stimuli such as snakes\nand guns modulate spatial attention. It appears that the evolutionary relevancy of these\nthreat stimuli did not influence their attention grabbing efficacy. Other potential factors,\nsuch as the direction of threat, may play an important role in whether or not degraded non-\nface threat images elicit enhancements in spatial attention.\nReferences\nArmony, J.
