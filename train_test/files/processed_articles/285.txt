There has been a decline in mortality\nfrom stroke among persons 65 and over in recent decades in the US. It is not clear, however, how this process has\naffected incidence of various dementias.\nMethods--We evaluated over time changes in stroke admission rates and survival, and in rates of newly diagnosed\ndementias (Alzheimer disease, senile, and cerebrovascular disease\u00adrelated dementia) in persons with and without stroke\naged 65 and over, using Medicare inpatient records, 1984 to 2001, linked to the National Long-Term Care Survey (about\npatients the rate rose from 0.043 to 0.080. The relative increase in risk was largest for cerebrovascular disease\u00adrelated\ndementia (3.68). For senile dementia, the increase was small and not significant. Rates of dementia among persons\nwithout stroke rose mainly attributable to Alzheimer disease.\nConclusions--Mortality from stroke declined mainly because of declining stroke case-fatality. In parallel, the rate of\ndiagnosed dementia increased. The increase was larger for persons with stroke compared with stroke-free population.\nImproved survival from stroke may contribute to this trend. Other contributing factors may include better diagnostics,\nan increased propensity to make the diagnosis, and increasing dementia risk attributable to factors other than stroke.\nKey Words: Alzheimer disease  dementia  epidemiology  stroke  survival\nStroke is associated with an excess risk of dementia.\nEpidemiological studies suggest a several-fold increased\npersons in the US experienced a new or recurrent stroke\nduring 2002.5 The large number of strokes, taken in combi-\nnation with the association of stroke and dementia onset, implies\nthat stroke-related dementia is a major public health issue.\nSince the 1980s, there has been an almost 2-fold decline in\nmortality from stroke among persons aged 65 and older in the\nUS.6 This decline could have occurred from a decline in\nstroke incidence, or case-fatality rates, or both. Only a few\nstudies have documented changes over time in stroke inci-\ndence and patients' survival, and recent trends are not quite\nclear. A decline in stroke incidence rate has been recorded in\nseveral European countries.7\u00ad10 There are limited data dem-\nonstrating a similar decline among Americans aged 70 years\nrate from stroke declined from 12% to 7% to 8% in the US,\nduring in-hospital stay among patients aged 65 and over\nMedicare hospital claim records.14 Some European studies\nhave recorded declining case-fatality rates for stroke (at least\nin women).10,15 In several other European studies, case-\nfatality did not change significantly over time, so that authors\nhave attributed the decline in stroke mortality to a reduction\nin the incidence rather than in the case-fatality rate.9,11\nAlthough decreasing stroke incidence per se should reduce\nthe number of new cases of dementia, the effect of improved\nsurvival from stroke is less clear. On the one hand, some\nfactors associated with improved survival (eg, better differ-\nential diagnostics of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke or\nbetter treatment of stroke consequences) could potentially\nreduce the risk of poststroke dementia. On the other hand,\nimproved survival from stroke could increase the proportion\nof stroke survivors with more severe brain injury (who would\nhave died previously), which might cause an increase in\ndementia risks after stroke.\nIn this article, we examine the age patterns and time trends\nFrom the Duke University Center for Demographic Studies (S.U., K.A., A.Y.), Durham, NC; and the Duke University Center for Health Policy (F.S.),\nLaw and Management, Duke University, Durham, NC.\nCorrespondence to Svetlana Ukraintseva, PhD, Duke University Center for Demographic Studies, Duke University, 2117 Campus Drive, Durham,\n27708 NC.

We address\nthe following question: How did the declining trend in\nmortality from stroke affect rates of various diagnosed\ndementias in the US elderly in recent decades?\nMaterials and Methods\nSubjects\nThe NLTCS is a survey designed to measure health status, functional\nlimitations, disability, and the use of long-term care among the\nelderly Americans. It contains longitudinal and cross-sectional data\non a nationally representative sample of 41 947 US elderly persons\n(from Medicare enrollees) who were aged 65 years at enrollment.\nthe time of each new survey, a cohort sample of about 5000 persons\npassing their 65th birthday in the prior 5 years was added to the\nsurviving sample to replace the deaths occurring since the prior\nsurvey and to ensure that the new sample was representative of the\nentire elderly population aged 65 and over in the respective year. In\nin all 5 waves of the NLTCS.\nEach NLTCS participant is linked to Medicare records, containing\ninformation on Part A and B claims. Part A refers to the Medicare\ninsurance program that covers inpatient hospital care, posthospital\nskilled nursing care, home health services, and hospice care for aged\nand disabled individuals who meet the eligibility requirements. Part\nB pays for physicians' services, outpatient hospital care, durable\nmedical equipment, and some medical services that are not covered\nby Part A (for more information see: http://www.medicare.gov/;\nhttp://www.cms.hhs.gov/). Diagnostic information was not available\non Part B records until 1991. The quality of information for Part A\ninpatient (IP) claims was sufficient for the entire study period\ncontained the missing data in the other years. Hence, in our study we\nonly used IP claims to obtain the information on diagnoses assigned\nto the NLTCS participants during hospital stay. In total, about\n380 000 person-years were represented in our data (supplemental\nTables I and II, available online at http://stroke.ahajournals.org).\nWe did not use sample weights in our analyses. The weights were\nthe weights were not available for the years between the surveys. In\nour study, we had to calculate the rates of Medicare diagnoses for\nnot use sample weights and calculated nonweighted rates for each\nstudy year.\nDiagnoses of Stroke and Dementia\nWe used the ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes (downloaded from ftp://\nftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Publications/ICD9-CM/\n2003). The history of changes in ICD-9-CM codes was tracked to\nevaluate possible influences on the analyses of data using \"Conver-\nsion Table of New ICD-9-CM Codes, October 2004\" (downloaded\nfrom http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/icd9/icdcnv05.pdf). There was\nonly 1 change in ICD-9-CM codes that could affect our analyses.\nThe code 438.0 (Cerebrovascular disease\u00adrelated cognitive deficit)\nThey were counted as diagnosed with cerebrovascular disease\u00adrelated\ndementia (CBVD) and were included in calculations of respective rates.\nThe stroke sample consisted of persons with a principal ICD-\nor iatrogenic cerebrovascular infarction or hemorrhage/postoperative\nstroke (997.02). We considered 3 groups of individuals with newly\ndiagnosed dementia, according to the ICD-9-CM codes: (1) Alzhei-\ndementia) codes; (2) CBVD-290.4 (Vascular dementia: multi-\ninfarct, arteriosclerotic dementia) or 438.0 (cerebrovascular disease\u00ad\nrelated cognitive deficit) codes; and (3) Senile Dementia-290.0,\nrepresents various cases of senility with mental deterioration. We\ncomputed dementia rates for these groups defining them to be\nmutually exclusive diagnoses. That is, if the person had an AD, she\nor he was assigned to the AD group, regardless of possible presence\nof other dementia diagnoses. Individuals diagnosed with both CBVD\nand senile dementias were classified as having CBVD. Finally,\npersons diagnosed with senile dementia alone (ie, without AD or\nCBVD) were placed in the senile dementia category. Thus, in\nrespective calculations of dementia rates, a person was counted only\nonce. We separated diagnoses of AD and CBVD from the rest of\ndementias (\"senile\") aiming to reduce the heterogeneity in the AD\nand CBVD groups rather than to specify senile dementias as a\nhomogeneous diagnosis.\nStatistical Analyses\nWe evaluated rates of occurrence of first stroke and newly\ndiagnosed dementia after stroke--by beneficiary age, and\nsurvival after stroke--by duration since the stroke onset. The\ndate of a disease onset was the first date after the admission\nfor which an IP claim was found. Rates of dementia after\nstroke were calculated for 1 year after the first admission\nfor stroke. Persons with dementia diagnosis assigned before\nstroke event were excluded from the analyses of dementia\nrisks after the stroke. We also calculated rates of dementia per\nyear for persons without stroke. Confidence intervals for the\nrates and significance of differences between the rates at\ndifferent ages were evaluated using standard asymptotic\nformulae for the binomial probabilities. To compute age-\npopulation stratified by age in 5-year intervals and by gender\nfrom the US Bureau of the Census data, (http://www.census.\nResults\nThere was slight increase in age-adjusted rates of stroke\nFigure 1. Age-specific rate (SE) of first stroke diagnosis at dif-\nferent years.\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nFigure 1. Survival at 1 year after first diagnosed stroke\nsurvival accounted for almost all the improvement in survival\nthrough 5 years after stroke. Mortality among stroke survi-\nyears after admission for stroke, about 65% had died. Note\nbecause we needed 5-year follow-up after the stroke onset to\ncalculate these functions.\nAge-adjusted rates of newly diagnosed dementia in the\nstandardized) rates for different types of dementia increased\nover time in the entire sample as well (Figure 3). The most\nsubstantial absolute increase in the rates was observed for AD\n(Figure 3a). Increases in CBVD and senile dementia were less\npronounced (Figure 3b and 3c).\nOverall risk of dementia was much higher (up to 10 times)\nduring 1 year after stroke as compared with stroke-free\npopulation (Table; Figure 4). This excess in risk was statis-\nAge-adjusted rates of poststroke dementia increased from\n(Table). The greatest (almost 4-fold) relative increase was\nobserved for CBVD developing after stroke (95% CI [1.83,\n7.41]; Table 1). For persons who did not have a stroke, the\noverall rate of dementia has also increased (from 0.0061 in\nthe relative increase was less substantial than for stroke\npatients (1.38 and 1.87, respectively; Table). Rates of demen-\ntia among the elderly without stroke rose largely attributable\nto increases in rates of AD (Table). There were comparable\nrelative increases in the rates of AD among stroke patients\nand in stroke-free population during the study period (1.64\nand 1.55, respectively). For senile dementia alone, the in-\nand statistically not significantly different in individuals with\nand without stroke (the relative increase was 1.1 and 1.19,\nrespectively; Table).\nDiscussion\nOur study demonstrated that stroke rates did not change\nsignificantly over time, whereas the risk of dementia after\nstroke substantially increased. The CBVD accounted for\nalmost all the relative increase in dementia risks among\nindividuals with stroke (Table). The improved survival from\nstroke might contribute to this trend. The improved survival\nFigure 2.

Such persons might be more predisposed to dementia.\nThe small relative increase in rates of senile dementia over\ntime (Table) suggests that no major environmental changes\noccurred that might have affected rates of dementia for this\ngroup (representing mixed cases of elderly mental deteriora-\ntion that are not AD or CBVD). Expanding use of brain\nprotective medications among the elderly during recent de-\ncades suggests that there may even be protective factors\nagainst dementia in population.16,17 Relevant studies are,\nhowever, limited and do not allow to draw reliable conclu-\nsions about this potential influence.\nThe similarity of the relative increases in rates of AD\namong persons with and without stroke (Table) suggests that\nfactors other than survival from stroke contributed to the\nchange in rates of AD over time. Possible factors include\nimproved diagnostic procedures for AD, increasing popular-\nity of the diagnosis, and an increase in AD risk in elderly\nindividuals in an association with some other disorders.\nRelative contributions of these factors in increased rates of\nAD are, however, not clear.\nComparisons With Other Studies\nComparing our findings with those of previous studies is\ncomplicated by differences in follow-up periods, variations\namong countries, and in observational periods. Our analyses\nshow that the chances of an elderly person being admitted for\nbroader list of ICD-9-CM codes that included chronic cere-\nbrovascular disorders as well. Survival after stroke based on\naccordance with our data. Similar to others,1\u00ad4 our study\nshowed substantial (several-fold) excess in risk of dementia\namong stroke patients compared with stroke-free population.\nThe general increase in diagnosed AD has been reported\npreviously,18 and it is also shown in present study. Because\nthe higher rates of AD onset were not limited to persons after\nstroke in our study, there are clearly general factors account-\ning for the increased rates of the diagnosis.\nStrengths and Limitations\nOur study has several strengths. Time trends for different\nkinds of dementia after stroke were evaluated for the first\ntime and compared with the trends in dementia onset in a\nnonstroke population. This allowed us to evaluate the relative\ncontribution of the different kinds of mental impairment to\nthe increased risk of overall dementia and suggest factors\nresponsible for observed trends. Another important strength is\nFigure 4. Age-specific rates (SE) of newly diagnosed dementia\n(all kinds) in entire sample and in persons with stroke (during a\nyear after the diagnosis).\nFigure 3. Age-specific rates (SE) of various kinds\nof newly diagnosed dementia by age: a, AD;\nb, senile dementia (not CBVD and not AD);\nc, CBVD (not AD).\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nthe study's national scope of the data, which is representative\nof the US elderly.\nWe also acknowledge several study limitations. First, we\nmeasured rates of dementia from diagnoses reported in\nMedicare claims. There is likely to be variation in the criteria\nand clinical evidence used by physicians to make a dementia\ndiagnosis which affects clinical decision making, eg, treat-\nment of acute myocardial infarction and personal health care\nexpenditures more generally.19\u00ad23 Second, limiting the study\nto Medicare Part A inpatient claims plausibly led to an\nunderestimate of rates of diagnosed dementia. However, the\nstudy objective was to measure time trends in the rates of\ndiagnosed dementia rather than to estimate \"true\" incidence.\nTo determine the trends reliably, we limited our analysis to\nthe IP records. Third, all study participants were Medicare\nbeneficiaries, and a selection bias could have arisen because\nof the differential access to the Medicare system according to\nrace, socio-economic status, education, and income. Finally,\nthere may have also been differential underreporting (eg,\nsevere stroke patients are more likely to be readmitted and\nthus could more likely be identified as having dementia than\nthose with milder strokes).\nSummary\nMortality from stroke declined mainly because of declining\nstroke case-fatality. At the same time, rates of diagnosed\n2000. The relative increase was larger for persons with stroke\ncompared with stroke-free population (Table). Improved\nsurvival from stroke might contribute to this difference in\ntrends. The increase in risk of dementia in stroke-free\npopulation was largely attributable to AD (Table).\nThe increasing trend in dementia recorded in Medicare\nclaims data may have occurred for several reasons, including\na true increase in underlying risk or an increase in case\nidentification or diagnosis popularity. More studies are\nneeded to identify actual reasons for the increasing rates of\ndiagnosed dementia in the US elderly.\n"
