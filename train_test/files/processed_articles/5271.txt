This\nresearch began in earnest when Faris and Dunham (1939)\nreported a per capita linear decrease in rates of severe mental\nillness from densely populated, disorganized, inner-city\nregions, to affluent, residential areas on the outskirts. More\nrecent research supports Faris and Dunham's finding with\none meta-analysis showing that urban environments confer a\n2.37 times greater risk of schizophrenia than rural environ-\nments (Vassos, Pederson, Murray, Collier, & Lewis, 2012).\nWhile there has been some attempt to explain the relation-\nship between psychosis and urban living in terms of down-\nward social drift (Murali & Oyebode, 2004), dose-response\nevidence suggests that there is a more fundamental, causal\nrelationship between urban living and psychosis\n(Krabbendam & Van Os, 2005; Pedersen & Mortensen,\nsmaller, urban environments have been shown to increase\nrisk of major depression and anxiety (Lederbogen et al.,\nanalyses have used population density to define urbanity, and\nsome researchers have commented that this tight epidemio-\nlogical research focus limits our understanding of the spe-\ncific effects of physical and social contexts on mental health\n(Weich, Twigg, & Lewis, 2006). These authors suggest a\nneed to widen the focus of research into the urbanicity effect\nand to develop methods that enable the objective study of\nhow people respond to different living environments.\nThe Physical and Socioeconomic Urban Context\nIn the United Kingdom, 98% of the most deprived areas are\nfound in cities, tending to be areas where urban regeneration\ninitiatives are focused (Department of Communities and\nLocal Government [DCLG], 2011). However, research has\ncontinued to find urbanicity effects even when controlling\nfor indices of deprivation (McKenzie, Murray, & Booth,\n2013). Such findings indicate that some of the urbanicity\neffect may be attributed to the psychosocial stress associated\nwith living in physical and social environments perceived to\n1University of Liverpool, UK\n2Prosocial Place, Liverpool, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nRhiannon Corcoran, Institute of Psychology Health and Society, and\nHeseltine Institute for Public Policy and Practice, Muspratt Building,\nUniversity of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GJ, UK.\nEmail: rhiannon.corcoran@liverpool.ac.uk\nPlaces Change Minds: Exploring the\nPsychology of Urbanicity Using a Brief\nContemplation Method\nRhiannon Corcoran1, Rosie Mansfield1, Trina Giokas1,\nAmy Hawkins1, Lauren Bamford1, and Graham Marshall1,2\n Keywords\nurban/rural, desirable neighborhoods, psychological mechanisms, mental health and well-being\n2 SAGE Open\nbe impoverished (Ellaway, Macintyre, & Kearns, 2001;\nEllaway et al., 2009; Kirkbride, Jones, Ullrich, & Coid,\ntial psychological and social mechanisms, Evans (2003) has\nproposed that the physical characteristics of place impact on\nmental health and well-being by influencing sense of control\nwith aspects such as lack of community cohesion, perceived\nrisk of crime, and sense of belonging all associated with\nworse mental health outcomes (Ellaway et al., 2001; Romans,\nThe potential of certain transdiagnostic psychological mech-\nanisms to explain the urbanicity effect is particularly\ncompelling.\nPsychological Mechanisms and Urbanicity\nIn terms of underlying information processing, depression,\nanxiety, and paranoia have much in common, including a\nheightened external locus of control (LoC), heightened antic-\nipation and avoidance of social threat, and an underestima-\ntion of the likelihood of future positive events (Bird, Mansell,\nsame psychological profiles are found, at attenuated levels,\nin nonclinical populations as shown in research adopting a\nmental health continuum approach (Freeman et al., 2008;\nVerdoux & Van Os, 2002). LoC refers to the extent to which\nan individual believes that his/her life course is determined\nby themselves or by external forces such as luck or \"power-\nful others\" (Rotter, 1966). Robustly linked to depression,\nanxiety, and paranoia in both clinical and nonclinical sam-\nples, an external LoC has also been reported in association\nwith more individualistic cultures and with ethnic minority\nstatus (Cheng, Cheung, Chio, & Chan, 2013; Harrow,\nHansford, Astrachan-Fletcher, 2009; Johnson & Sarason,\nTwenge, Zhang, & Im, 2004; Van Dijk, Dijkshoorn, Van\nA heightened attention to threat has been demonstrated in\na number of ways, including attentional bias to negative and\nthreatening stimuli and a tendency to overestimate the likeli-\nhood of future threatening events with findings associated\nwith depression, anxiety, and paranoia (Bennett & Corcoran,\nAs well as LoC and threat focus, low mental well-being is\ncharacterized by future orientation biases and deficits (Drake,\nDuncan, Sutherland, Abernethy, & Henry, 2008). Cognitive\nmodels of depression, anxiety, and paranoia all emphasize\nnegative views about the future (Abler, Erk, Herwig, &\n& Adler, 2009). More generally, the extent to which people\nconsider and plan for their futures (consideration of future\nconsequences [CFC]) broadly predicts behavior, health, and\nwell-being (Pepper & Nettle, 2014; Strathman, Gleicher,\nBoninger, & Edwards, 1994). Individuals with an attenuated\nfuture orientation are more focused on maximizing immedi-\nate benefits and therefore consideration of one's future nega-\ntively correlates with impulsivity, a robust transdiagnostic\nfeature of mental health and well-being (Whiteside & Lynam,\nLived experiences of victimization, discrimination, and\npowerlessness, linked to inner-city living, serve to confirm\nthe beliefs associated with these mental health symptoms\nSchreier et al., 2009). Thus, the psychological processing\nstyles and beliefs associated with depression, anxiety, and\nparanoid feelings are also associated with living in impover-\nished neighborhoods (Chen & Paterson, 2006; Ross &\n(2015) found that neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES)\npredicted individual levels of behavioral inhibition, a charac-\nteristic invariably associated with impulsive traits and future\ndiscounting. Furthermore, and directly relevant to the para-\ndigm employed in this study, Liu, Feng, Suo, Lee, and Li\n(2012) explored how brief exposure to cues of poverty or\naffluence influenced the intertemporal choices made by their\nparticipants. These authors found that exposure to the images\nof poverty tended to increase participants' impulsivity, mak-\ning them prefer smaller immediate over larger future-based\nrewards. Thus, Liu et al.'s findings are indicative of a reduced\nconsideration of the future in response to visual cues of\npoverty.\nThe Effects of Brief Exposure to Inner-City Areas\non Mental Health and Well-Being\nRecent research by Ellett, Freeman, and Garety (2008) has\nsuggested that an \"urbanicity effect\" is measurable in non-\nresidents after a brief exposure to a deprived urban neighbor-\nhood. In a study in which individuals with persecutory\ndelusions were briefly exposed to a deprived urban neighbor-\nhood during a walk, these authors reported that participants\nshowed increased anxiety and paranoia alongside increased\nnegative beliefs about others. Nettle, Pepper, Jobling, and\nSchroeder (2014) found similar results when students were\nexposed to an unfamiliar deprived urban neighborhood.\nThese authors demonstrated that student visitors reported\nsimilar levels of paranoia and trust to that of the neighbor-\nhood residents after just brief exposure to the area.\nThe Current Research\nThe studies reported here extend the paradigm of Liu et al.\n(2012) to explore the effects on LoC, anticipation of threat\n(AoT), and CFC of a very brief, remote consideration of\nplace photographs. We chose this method because a strong\nCorcoran et al. 3\ncase can be made about the effects of sustained exposure to\ncertain kinds of urban environments on mental health and\nwell-being if changes to psychological variables can be dem-\nonstrated to follow very brief and indirect exposure to the\nsame kinds of places.\nAs well as exploring the difference between perceived\nquality of areas, we aimed to assess the extent to which a so-\ncalled biophilic predisposition (Wilson, 1984,) may account\nfor the urbanicity effect. The biophilic hypothesis is becom-\ning increasingly influential in public health and urban plan-\nHowever, a criticism of many studies reporting the positive\neffects of green space on health and well-being is that neigh-\nborhoods with green spaces are typically considered to be of\ngenerally higher desirability. We attempt to explore this criti-\ncism here using a methodology that can dissociate between\nthe \"green-ness\" and the perceived desirability of residential\nplaces.\nAims and Hypotheses\nThis pair of studies aimed to explore whether very brief con-\ntemplation of place images can elicit changes in the self-\nreported psychological mechanisms associated with mental\nhealth and well-being. The images selected differed in degree\nof (a) urbanity (rural or urban) or (b) subjective desirability\n(rated high or low on the question, \"How nice is this place?\").\nIt was anticipated that scores on measures of LoC, AoT,\nand CFC would change in response to the active contempla-\ntion of place images and that these changes would be related\nto the perceived urbanity (lack of green-ness) of the environ-\nments as well as their perceived desirability. Specifically:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 In support of the biophilic hypothesis, we expected\nthat the contemplation of urban but not rural images\nwould lead to increased external LoC, enhanced AoT,\nand a reduction in CFC.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 In support of suggestions that the urbanicity effect is\nassociated with the quality of living environments, we\nexpected that the contemplation of less desirable but\nnot more desirable places would lead to increased\nexternal LoC, enhanced AoT, and a reduction in CFC.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 We expected that any changes to LoC, AoT, and CFC\nrelated to contemplating the place images would be\nassociated with elevated feelings of depression, anxi-\nety, and/or paranoia.\nMethod\nPilot Studies: Image Selection\nStudy A: Urban versus rural. Ten aerial and 10 street view pho-\ntographs of typical urban and rural neighborhoods, none\nshowing people, were sourced from across the United King-\ndom.

The photos were selected to show\nresidential areas and a similar numbers vehicles.\nrural each with five aerial and five street view) on the extent\nto which they considered the neighborhoods as urban (0 =\nnot urban, 100 = very urban) and the extent to which they\nconsidered the neighborhoods as rural (0 = not rural, 100 =\nvery rural).\nThe participants were also asked to rate the photographs\nfor perceived desirability using the question \"How nice is\nthis place?\" rated using 0 to 100 scale. To control for any dif-\nferences in perceived desirability of the places, only the pho-\ntos with overall mean scores falling within the central\nthis place?\" were considered for inclusion in the main study.\nEight images clearly regarded as urban (four images, two\naerial and two street view) or rural (four images, two aerial\nand two street view) were selected for use as stimuli in the\nmain study. An independent samples \"t\" test comparing the\naverage urbanity ratings of the selected urban and rural pho-\ntos confirmed that the selected urban images were rated sig-\nnificantly higher than the selected rural images for urbanity\nStudy B: Desirable versus undesirable. A set of 24 photographs\nrepresenting typical residential neighborhoods in the United\nKingdom were collected. Some were the teams' own photo-\ngraphs and others were found on the Internet. None of the\ncollected photographs showed extremely impoverished, run\ndown, or derelict places. The images were selected to be\nsimilar in terms of amount of green space and vehicles shown\nand none included people. All images were street as opposed\nto aerial view to better capture the \"desirability\" of the resi-\ndential area.Asample of 21 participants (10 male, 11 female)\nrespond to the following questions to rate the desirability of\nHow \"nice\" is this place?\" And \"How much would you like to\nlive in this place?\nTo select the most and least desirable urban residential pho-\ntographs from the set of 24, a mean response score for each\nparticipant was calculated for the above questions. The top\nfive highest and lowest ranked images were used in the main\nstudy as the more desirable and less desirable place images.\nAn independent samples t test comparing the average desir-\nability ratings of the five more desirable and five less desir-\nable images confirmed that the more desirable images were\nrated significantly higher than the less desirable images\n(one-tailed).\n4 SAGE Open\nParticipants\nData were provided by first-year undergraduate psychology\nstudents completing research studies in exchange for course\ncredits.\nStudy A: Urban versus rural.A total of 173 participants com-\npleted the online survey that included the four urban photo-\ngraphs while a different sample of 183 completed the survey\nthat included the four rural photographs.

After fil-\ntering for incomplete data and excluding any participants\nwho requested that their data be deleted, the final complete\ndesirable: n = 157). Table 1 provides more detail of the par-\nticipant demographics.\nThe majority of participants in both studies were female\naged between 18 and 24 years with each participant contrib-\nuting data to only one of the four surveys. The sex ratio and\nage reflect the student population studying undergraduate\npsychology in the United Kingdom. It was very unlikely that\nparticipants knew the depicted neighborhoods as the photo-\ngraphs were of diverse UK areas.\nThe Online Survey Measures\nThe measures that made up the four surveys were presented\nin the fixed order below.\n1. The Persecution and Deservedness Scale (PaDS per-\nsecution only; Melo, Corcoran, Shryane, & Bentall,\ndesigned for use in both nonclinical and clinical sam-\nples. Statements refer to direct or indirect intentional\nharm from others, and respondents are asked to rate\nthe extent to which they agree with each statement on\na 5-point scale. The scale has been shown to have\nhigh internal consistency in a nonclinical, student\n2. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS 21;\nscale used to measure the severity of symptoms relat-\ning to depression, anxiety, and stress on a 4-point\nscale. Compared with other validated measures,\nnant validity in a nonclinical adult sample.\n3. Locus of Control Scale (LoC; Rotter, 1966) is used\nto measure perceived control over one's life. For\neach of 13 paired statements, respondents are asked\nto indicate which alternative best describes their\nattitude. A high score is indicative of a more exter-\nnal LoC. As LoC needed to be assessed before and\nafter photo contemplation, the scale was split in half\nby randomly allocating the items to either pre- or\npoststimuli order. To equate the number of items pre\nand post, the paired statements \"the idea that teach-\ners are unfair to students is nonsense\" and \"most\nstudents don't realize the extent to which their\ngrades are influenced by accidental happenings\"\nwere removed. This pair was chosen for exclusion\nbecause it was felt that responses may be skewed in\nthe student sample.\n4. Anticipation of Threat (AoT; Corcoran et al., 2006) is\na seven-item self-report scale, with acceptable inter-\nnal reliability ( = 0.78) measuring the extent to\nwhich respondents anticipate encountering certain\nthreatening acts over the next week using a 7-point\nscale. As AoT needed to be assessed before and after\nphoto contemplation, the scale was split in half by\nrandomly allocating the items to either pre- or post-\nstimuli order. To equate the number of items pre and\npost photo contemplation, the item \"Your mail is read\nwithout your permission\" was removed.\n5. Consideration of Future Consequences Scale (CFC;\nmeasure the extent to which people regard immediate\nversus distant consequences of their behavior as more\nimportant. A high score indicates less consideration\nof the future. Respondents rate how characteristic of\nthem each statement is using a 5-point scale. The\nauthors report internal reliability ranging from  =\nand after photo contemplation, it was split in half by\nrandomly allocating the items to either pre- or post-\nstimuli order.\nPhoto Contemplation Questions\nThe photograph contemplation task was undertaken after\nparticipants had completed the first half of the LoC, AoT,\nand CFC measures. Participants were asked to respond using\nTable 1. Participant Demographics.\nn\nUrban Rural Desirable Undesirable\nCorcoran et al. 5\n6-point Likert-type scales to the following five contempla-\ntion questions:\n1. How \"nice\" is this place?\n2. How much would you like to live in this place?\n3. How much would you say that people who live in this\nplace mix with each other on friendly terms?\n4. How much antisocial behavior (e.g., smashed bus\nshelters, fly tipping, burnt out cars) would you expect\nto see in this area?\n5. How poor or rich do you think the people who live in\nthis place are?\nAnalysis Strategy\nIn both studies, the following three-step approach to data\nanalysis was taken:\n1. Pearson's correlations were used to explore the rela-\ntionship between the measures of paranoid ideation,\ndepression, and anxiety (PaDS and DASS) and the\npre-stimuli measures of LoC, AoT, and CFC to deter-\nmine their level of association in these samples.\n2. Paired samples t tests were used to compare pre- and\npostcontemplation levels of self-reported LoC, AoT,\nand CFC regardless of image type. For each of these\nmeasures, a pre\u00adpost stimuli difference score was\ncomputed. These new variables were subjected to\nindependent samples t tests to establish whether con-\ntemplation of the different images was associated\nwith greater or lesser difference scores.\n3. Finally, depending on the outcome of Step 2, hierar-\nchical regression would explore the extent to which\nthe change in psychological mechanisms following\nthe contemplation of images was independently\nrelated to DASS and PaDS scores and image type.\nResults\nStudy A: Urban Versus Rural Places\nThe relationship between DASS and PaDS scores and prestimuli\nLoC, AoT, and CFC.Confirming the established findings of\nprevious literature, Table 2 shows the statistically significant\ncorrelations between the measures of paranoia, depression,\nand anxiety with prestimuli LoC, AoT, and CFC.\nPhotograph Contemplation Effects\nTable 3 shows the means (\u00b1SD) for the urban and rural\nimages for pre- and poststimuli LoC, AoT, and CFC.

Table 4 provides full details of the\nhierarchical regression including individual beta values for\neach independent variable included stepwise.\nDiscussion\nThe research reported above agrees with the findings of stud-\nby showing that even very brief exposure to particular places\nis associated with changes to psychology that could underpin\nthe urbanicity effect. Furthermore, it strengthens the argu-\nment about the rapidity of this psychological response by\nusing the approach of Liu et al.(2012) where only photo-\ngraphs were used to elicit the effects of place contemplation\non psychological mechanisms. StudyAaimed to explore bio-\nphilic explanations of the urbanicity effect by examining\nwhether very brief contemplation of neighborhoods per-\nceived to be urban produced changes in LoC, AoT, and CFC\nwhile neighborhoods perceived to be rural did not.\nUnexpectedly, the results indicated that significant change to\nall the mechanisms occurred after contemplating both the\nrural and urban photographs with participants feeling signifi-\ncantly less in control of their lives, anticipating significantly\nmore threat and reporting less consideration of the future.\nHowever, when comparing pre- and postcontemplation dif-\nference scores by photo type, no significant differences were\nfound. These findings indicate that post-contemplation\nchanges to these psychological mechanisms cannot be\nexplained by the perceived urbanity of places and so are not\nconsistent with biophilic interpretations of the urbanicity\neffect.\nIn Study B, we explored whether very brief contempla-\ntion of residential neighborhoods considered to be relatively\nundesirable would produce changes in LoC, AoT, and CFC\nwhile residential places considered to be relatively desirable\nwould not. Replicating the urban versus rural findings, we\nfound that all psychological mechanisms changed signifi-\ncantly following the contemplation of place images\nirrespective of type, with participants feeling significantly\nless in control of their lives, anticipating significantly more\nthreat and considering the future significantly less. Of the\nthree psychological mechanisms considered, only the change\nto AoT was significantly associated with the contemplation\nof less desirable places. Furthermore, in a hierarchical regres-\nsion, image type was found to be a significant independent\npredictor of post-contemplation AoT after controlling for the\nother influential independent variables (i.e., pre-contempla-\ntion AoT, DASS, and PaDS scores). Thus, while the hypoth-\nesis that brief contemplation of urban photos would be\nassociated with changes to self-reported psychological\nmechanisms to a greater extent than the contemplation of\nrural images was not supported, the hypothesis that brief\ncontemplation of less desirable residential neighborhoods\nwould be associated with changes in psychological mecha-\nnisms more than contemplation of more desirable residential\nneighborhoods was partially supported. Specifically, brief\ncontemplation of relatively undesirable neighborhoods\nenhanced a sense of threat to the self in the future. Therefore,\nfindings using this paradigm suggest that the perceived desir-\nability of place is a better potential explanation of the urban-\nicity effect than the perceived urbanity of place.\nWe also predicted that the extent of post-contemplation\nchanges to psychology would be related to higher self-\nreported levels of depression/anxiety and paranoid ideation.\nFull support for this hypothesis was found in relation to AoT\nin Study B. Consistent with previous literature showing that\nsymptoms of depression, anxiety,, and paranoia are associ-\nated with the anticipation of more negative and threatening\nfound that higher levels of depression, anxiety, and paranoia\npredicted more change in AoT after image contemplation.\nHowever, it is important to stress that image type accounted\nfor additional variance in post-contemplation AoT beyond\nTable 4.

While unex-\npected, these general place contemplation findings might be\nexplained by the effects of uncontrolled variables, such as\nSES and/or generic aspects of the study design. For example,\nit has been found that people with lower SES perceive more\nthreat and less control generally (Chen & Paterson, 2006).\nAlthough it is unlikely to account for the findings in this\nstudy involving university students, future research should\ncertainly take into account self-reported SES and area of\nresidence to address criticisms premised upon \"mere expo-\nsure\" effects (Zajonc, 1968). In terms of generic aspects of\nstudy design, it is possible that the contemplation changes\nfound across all photo types resulted from unavoidable order\neffects associated with measuring variables pre and post\nstimuli. However, we consider that the most likely explana-\ntion for this generic finding is related to the type of questions\nused to prompt active contemplation. These focused on spe-\ncific judgments about the nature of the people who may live\nin these places. As such, these social-psychological prompts\nmay have elicited negative changes in social self-perspec-\ntive. Even so, the augmented contemplation effect of AoT\nassociated with the less desirable residential images existed\nover and above these general place contemplation effects.\nAlthough we consider the active contemplation aspect of this\nresearch design to be a positive feature as it is likely to mimic\nan everyday consideration of places, future research could\nexplore the overall explanatory role of the prompted contem-\nplation by presenting the photographs without the questions\nin a pure priming methodology.\nThe educational status, age, sex, and ethnicity bias of our\nsample limits the generalizability of these findings. Most\nimportantly, the predominantly undergraduate samples are\nlikely to be socioeconomically skewed. The fact that females\nhave been found to be more vulnerable to urbanicity effects\n(Sundquist et al., 2004) is also important to note but the hier-\narchical analyses conducted here did not find sex to be a sig-\nnificant predictor of postcontemplation AoT (see Table 4).\nWhile this study is important because it demonstrates that\neven a brief simulated immersion in place can result in\nsignificant changes in self-reflection, the ecological validity\nof a lab-based study using static photographs of place is low.\nFuture research could build ecological validity by tracking\nparticipant's responses as they move through contrasting\nurban environments.\nThese studies have demonstrated that brief, simulated\ncontemplation of place photographs can change the way we\nthink about ourselves within the social world. Furthermore,\nit has shown that levels of mental health and well-being are\nrelated to specific psychological responses to different envi-\nronments thus helping us to understand the urbanicity effect.\nThis kind of research has potential to add an important\ndimension to the evidence base that informs the future devel-\nopment of our cities and neighborhoods with the aim of mak-\ning them better living environments.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nProfessor Rhiannon Corcoran is part funded by the National\nInstitute of Health Research Collaborative Leadership in Applied\nHealth Research and Care North West Coast (NIHR CLAHRC\nNWC).
