This article considers responses to this question\nand the debate regarding possibilities of a red/green coalition through examination of four green theorists who represent\npositions of theoretical and historical significance: first, the argument that an enlightened reinterpretation of Marx reveals him\nto be an inherently ecological thinker; second, the belief that Marxist thought holds significant value for environmental theory\nbut that crucial weaknesses demand essential revision; third, the rejection of Marx and his political theory as antagonistic to\nenvironmental protection; and, finally, social ecology's use of dialectical naturalism to transcend Marx's failings.\n",
    "reduced_content": "sgo.sagepub.com\nArticle\nThe environmental movement has used a range of theoretical\nand activist challenges: protests against industrial practices\nleading to climate change, defiance of consumer culture,\nobjections to local and global cases of environmental injus-\ntice, disobedience of laws deemed to be environmentally\nunfriendly. Resistance has been only part of the green move-\nment's story; environmentalists, like proponents of any\nsocial movement, must argue for new habits and institutions\nat the same time they work to defeat the old. Still, not sur-\nprisingly, green thinkers have devoted a large proportion of\ntheir energy to confrontations with orthodox theories and\npractices.\nAs a result, a series of ongoing challenges to the Western\ncanon of political theory constituted a significant part of that\nadversarial project during the rise and consolidation of the\n20th-century environmental movement. Old masters came\nunder scrutiny according to a new set of standards: Were\nPlato and Aristotle early greens (Westra & Robinson, 1997)?\nWas Heidegger a forerunner of deep ecology (Zimmerman,\n1993)? Is it time to pull environmental thinkers, such as\nThoreau, to the forefront of political theory (Bennett, 1994)?\nOf these early critical reconsiderations, dominant under-\nstandings of Karl Marx prompted one of the most volumi-\nnous and vociferous sets of arguments from the mainstream\nenvironmental and radical ecology movements. Backers and\nattackers, proponents and protesters published a profuse lit-\nerature of books and journal articles on the urgent need for--\nor impossibilities of--a red/green coalition. This article is\ndesigned to summarize, explain, and evaluate key aspects of\nthis literature through an examination of several significant\ntheoretical analyses of Marx's environmental theory.\nSince the 1970s, provocative critiques of Marxist thought\nby mainstream environmentalists, biocentrists, survivalists,\nand other factions of the ecological spectrum have demanded\nreconsiderations of Marx and his theory of the relationship\nbetween humans and their environment. This analysis has\nbeen reciprocal rather than one-sided; many veteran leftists\nresponded to these challenges by taking Marx back to the\ntheoretical drawing board and examining the environmental\nimplications of Marx's writings on capitalism, alienation,\nand technology. Furthermore, while some Marxists wholly\nrejected the relevance of the environmental movement and\nsome greens summarily rejected Marx as a theoretical source,\nmany on each side saw themselves as engaged in an inter-\nlinked project of Marxist ecology, eco-Marxism, ecosocial-\nism, or red/green-left/green politics, depending on one's\nfavored term. From the red side of the potential coalition,\nMarxist thinkers generally fell into three categories when\nthey were challenged to integrate Marx and environmental\ntheory, as described by Reiner Grundmann (1991b): the first\ngroup included adherents of Marxist orthodoxy who spurned\nefforts to construct an environmental coalition; the second\nincluded Marxist dissidents who claimed that central princi-\nples of Marx's theory were ecologically untenable and then\nmoved to the green side of the debate; the third group\nincluded thinkers who embraced the environmental project\nbut found all necessary answers readily available within\nMarxist thought. This last position, Grundmann (1991a)\nnoted, \"amounts to wishful thinking\" (p. 103).

Again, several general camps\nemerged regarding Marx's affinity to green theory. Some\nanalysts found Marx to be a seminal environmentalist whose\ntheories of historical materialism, commodification, and\nalienation provide what is needed to analyze contemporary\necological problems. According to these writers, the solu-\ntions could be found through a new, more accurate under-\nstanding of Marx through enlightened reinterpretation\n1988). Not surprisingly, these defenders of Marxist ecology\ntended to concentrate on Marx's earlier writings, which took\na more interdependent view of humans' relationship with\nnature. A second group was much tougher on Marx, arguing\nthat although his political economy was crucial in certain\nways, it also contained significant flaws by way of cultural\nbias, theoretical omissions, or logical errors. This group,\nwhich yielded a large output of astute and articulate writing\nhigher level of theory and practice through ecological revi-\nsion. However, members of a third class of green theorists\njudged these first two groups as remaining dangerously\nmired within the modern Promethean mission of controlling\nnature--a mission, they argued, in which Marx was still\nthoroughly engaged. These writers, who tended to focus their\ncritiques on Marx's later works, insisted that he could not\nstand as an environmental defender and must be rejected\nrather than revised or reinterpreted (Eckersley, 1992;\nthe environmental movement must pursue a new theoretical\nfoundation rather than a red/green coalition or eco-Marxist\nrectification. A fourth position, held by Murray Bookchin\nfor a dialectical naturalism that adopts, disowns, and tran-\nscends various aspects of Marx's theory.\nThe literature for these positions within green political\nthought has been rich and the debate remains unsettled. As a\nmeans of identifying and explaining the core arguments\nwithin each of these responses, this article provides a primer\nof green approaches through examination of four landmark\ncontributors who set the stage for ecological considerations of\nMarx. Howard L. Parson's (1977) book Marx and Engels on\nEcology laid out the representative arguments for an enlight-\nened reinterpretation, Ted Benton's (1989) Marxism and\nNatural Limits voiced the call for revision, and Val Routley\n(later Plumwood) argued that Marxist thought must be\nrejected by environmental theorists in her oft-cited article in\nEnvironmental Ethics (Routley, 1981). Murray Bookchin's\ncritical response to Marx demands additional attention. His\ndialectical approach within the project of social ecology\nwould appear to bring him close to Marxist theory, yet his\ngoal of libertarian municipalism and focus on hierarchical\nsocial relations as the root of ecological problems also yielded\na strident critique of Marx's broader mission. Bookchin\npointed to social ecology's philosophy of dialectical natural-\nism as an \"ecologized\" approach that transcended Marx's\nmethodical and theoretical errors, rejected capitalism's instru-\nmental reasoning, and shunned \"sloppy\" ecologists' turn to\nanti-rationalism and mysticism. Following a survey of diver-\ngent ecological analyses by Parsons, Benton, and Plumwood,\ntherefore, I turn to an examination of Bookchin's response to\nMarx through the process of dialectical naturalism.\nReinterpreting Marx: Parsons and Marx\nand Engels on Ecology\nFor Howard L. Parsons, an investigation into the writings of\nMarx and Engels in search of ecological meaning was any-\nthing but \"a trivial form of scholarship and an example of\nspecial pleading.\" On the contrary, as he wrote in his influen-\ntial volume of original analysis and compilations from those\nworks, \"Marx and Engels had an understanding of\nan approach to ecology before the German zoologist,\nErnst Haeckel, coined the term Oekologie in 1869, and long\nbefore the current `ecological crisis' and `energy crisis'\"\n(Parsons, 1977, p. xi). Parsons clearly did not see himself as\na Marxist in ecological masquerade who was attempting to\ndeflect a new set of annoying criticisms. Instead, he pre-\nsented himself as a full-fledged environmental thinker who\nregarded the ecological movement as a crucial and integral\npart of the socialist struggle.\nIt was no accident, Parsons (1977) wrote, that the modern\nconception of nature based on dialectics and ecology arose\nduring Marx's era, responding to the scientific and historical\nunveiling of \"the interactive, evolutionary, and transforma-\ntive character of nature and society\" (p. 4). Once we under-\nstand the dialectical method, according to Parsons, we also\nwill know the inherent link between ecological and dialecti-\ncal thought:\n[E]cology as a specific science of ecosystems displays the\nprinciples of the general science of nature, or dialectics. For\ndialectics as a science of systems generally is concerned with the\ninteractions of two or more living or nonliving systems with one\nanother and with their environment. Ecology is the application of\ndialectics to living systems, and dialectics is the generalization of\nthe method of ecology from living systems to all systems. (p. 7)\nAs a result, Parsons (1977) argued, a new understanding\nof Marx's works quickly reveals a \"dialectical, ecological\nstandpoint.\" Humans' physical and spiritual lives are insepa-\nrable from nature (man's \"inorganic body\") because nature\ncannot be separated from itself and because humans are part\nof nature, as Marx wrote in The Economic and Philosophic\nManuscripts of 1844. With no doubt as to his intended\nanswer, Parsons rhetorically asked, \"Has there been a better,\nmore succinct, ecological statement of man's place in nature\nthan this?\" (p. 10). Marx's sensitivity to ecological laws and\nour violation of those laws is evident, he wrote, citing pas-\nsages in Capital Vol. 3 regarding waste and squandering of\nthe soil. Through these writings, according to Parsons, \"the\ntrue humanist turns out to be the true naturalist, and the true\nradical to be the true conservative\" (p. 19).\nAn extensive part of Parsons' (1977) project was an\nunsuccessful attempt to turn aside four common criticisms\nfrom ecologists who were less sympathetic to green readings\nof Marx and Engels. First, he argued, Marx did not pit man\nagainst nature as alleged. Dialectical materialism affirms\nboth opposition and unity of humans and nature, according\nto Parsons, and any opposition to nature in the sense of eco-\nlogical destructiveness \"is by definition impossible in true\nMarxism\" (p. 43). On this count, he wrote, Marx stands well\nahead of those ecologists who paradoxically claim to love\nnature but hate humanity: \"It was not that Marx and Engels\ndid not love nature; it was that they loved both it and man-\nkind\" (p. 41). Parsons then took on the charge that Marx was\nanthropocentric and thus denied the values of nonhuman\nnature. Here Parsons returned to the inseparability of humans\nand nature and again embraced a departure from those green\ntheorists who had purveyed the \"unrealistic\" argument that\nconcerns about nature can be addressed independently of\nconcerns about humans. Marx, quite rightly, rejected this\nunrealism and emphasized human needs, so \"if the assump-\ntion of the criticism is that Marxism has this emphasis, the\nassumption is correct\" (p. 45). This does not make Marx\nunecological, Parsons maintained, but \"at the very worst,\"\nmay leave some open questions regarding the issue of values\nin nature: \"In my own reading of these writings there is noth-\ning that finally forecloses the issue, in spite of what defend-\ners or attackers of Marx and Engels may say\" (p. 50).\nIn similar fashion, Parsons (1977) sought ways to refute a\nthird criticism alleging that Marx had overemphasized con-\nflicts in nature and overlooked the presence of harmony. This\ncharge cannot be upheld, Parsons argued, as cooperation is\ninherent in Marx's conception of nature. Because humans\nand nature are inextricably linked, humans cannot be changed\nor fulfilled without also changing and fulfilling nature.\nHumans therefore share needs with other peoples and other\nnonhuman animals, and \"if man is a human animal, as\nMarxism maintains, man's needs require the full support of\nboth society and nature\" (p. 57). Finally, a fourth criticism\noffered by ecologists came under Parsons' scrutiny.\nAccording to Parsons, it is untrue that Marx denied basic\nhuman values, but instead he worked to liberate humanity\nfrom alienation within society and nature--itself an\necological movement. \"The inevitable pathway to this new\necological system is the transformation of capitalism into\nsocialism under the leadership of a proletarian political\nThrough this ecological interpretation of Marx's writings,\nParsons engaged in twin projects. First, he hoped to refute\nthe critiques offered by both Marxists and non-Marxists and\nallow Marxist theory to claim the primary analytic window\nfor the ecological movement. Second, Parsons relentlessly\nworked toward a conclusion he hoped was inescapable: that\nMarxist theory not only is ecologically friendly in the sense\nthat it can be turned toward environmental issues but,\nmore importantly, that it inherently and unavoidably leads to\nthe verdict that ecological problems are inseparable from\nissues of political economy and class. The urgent need facing\nthe environmental movement was not rejection of Marxist\ntheory and adoption of a new political philosophy, according\nto Parsons, but rather recapture of the comprehensive under-\nstanding of ecological issues contained within Marx's dialec-\ntical materialism.\nHis call for this recapturing of Marx did not go unheard;\nreflections of Parsons' sympathetic reinterpretation of Marx\nare found in more recent analyses, particularly in the work of\nJohn Bellamy Foster (Foster et al., 2010) and Paul Burkett\n(2006). Ultimately, however, Parsons' presentation of Marx\nfailed in its attempt to revitalize Marx as an early green\nthinker and, instead, has been viewed as \"anachronistic in the\nworst sense\" through Parsons' ploy of reinvention\nRevising Marx: Benton and Marxism\nand Natural Limits\nMany other writers have been considerably less willing than\nParsons to give Marx credit for an ecological vision. These\ntheorists, including both Marxists and non-Marxists, have\nregarded Marx's work as a valuable and, for some, a crucial\npart of the ecological quest for solutions, but they have\nargued for much more than a selective and ecologically sym-\npathetic reinterpretation. Instead, they have proposed critical\nrevisions of Marx's writings to reconstruct historical materi-\nalism on an ecological level. One influential revisionist is\nMarxist theory as it stands is unable to conceptualize the eco-\nlogical limits of humans' relation with nature. Because Marx\nfeared an opening for the conservative natural-limits argu-\nment of Thomas Robert Malthus, according to Benton, he\nprovided an unfinished critique of classical political econ-\nomy, resulting in \"a series of related conflations, impreci-\nsions and lacunae.\" The resolution of this problem is not\navoidance or rejection of Marx, Benton (1989) wrote, but\nrather a project of correction, as \"there is much in the corpus\nof Marxist historical materialism which is readily compatible\nwith an ecological perspective\" (p. 63). Along with others,\nBenton (1996) has sought \"to build from a critical revision of\n4 SAGE Open\nthe Marxist classics towards an ecologically informed his-\ntorical materialism\" (p. 103).\nFor Benton, this project of correction must produce, first,\na retheorization of the concept of labor process, which Marx\ndefined as the eternal condition of human existence as\nimposed by our natural environment, and second, the con-\ncept of mode of production. In his writings, Marx viewed the\nlabor process as transformative, consisting of a raw material\nturned into a use value through human labor and the utiliza-\ntion of other raw materials and instruments of labor. Benton\nwas unwilling to accept this definition, however, arguing that\nMarx thus overgeneralizes all labor processes as fitting the\nproductive model. Some practices, such as raising crops or\nlivestock, cannot be incorporated within that model, he\nargued, and the transformative aspect of these \"eco-regula-\ntory\" practices is achieved not through human labor but by\nnature's organic mechanisms. Rather than transforming,\nhuman labor in eco-regulatory practices works to sustain,\nregulate, and reproduce, in Benton's view, and the Marxist\n\"subject of labor\" is not the raw material (i.e., the wheat seed\nor calf) but the ecological conditions in which that material\ngrows and matures. Human labor cannot be regarded as the\ntransformative tool for this category of practice, according to\nBenton (1989), due to the range of elements that are \"rela-\ntively impervious to intentional manipulation, and in some\nrespects they are absolutely non-manipulable\" (p. 68).\nFurthermore, Benton (1989) argued, Marx's account of\nthe labor process failed with respect to labor processes that\ncan be assimilated within the productive model. Even here,\nMarx's conception \"is shown to exaggerate their potentially\ntransformative character, whilst under-theorizing or occlud-\ning the various respects in which they are subject to naturally\ngiven and/or relatively non-manipulable conditions and lim-\nits\" (p. 73). Such weaknesses in Marx's theory are not merely\ndiscrete errors, according to Benton, but \"are coherent with\nsignificant strands in the wider theoretical perspectives of\nMarx and Engels, and they have a certain plausibility given\nthe historical location of their thinking\" (p. 74). Marx also\nheld an optimistic view about the emancipation of man by\nbecoming master of both his social organization and nature,\nBenton argued, suggesting \"an underlying antagonism\nbetween human purposes and nature: either we control\nnature, or it controls us! No room, apparently, for symbiosis,\npeaceful co-existence, mutual indifference or other imagin-\nable metaphors for this relationship\" (p. 75).\nIf Marx is indeed a purveyor of a Promethean project of\nnature's dominion, contrary to Parsons' vision of Marx as an\nearly ecologist, must we then reject Marxist theory altogether?\nCertainly not, Benton (1989) argued, for \"now we have\nreached the point in the argument where we can begin to see\nthe potential fruitfulness of Marx's critical account of capital-\nist accumulation, once defects in his concept of the labour-\nprocess are corrected\" (p. 77, italics in original). We must find\nthe path that \"avoids both the Scylla of epistemic conservatism\nand the Charybdis of `social-constructionist' utopianism,\" he\nwarned, and offered three means by which to do so. First,\nthrough a re-conceptualization of the labor processes, we must\nrecognize that the interrelations between humans and nature\nenable as well as limit. While \"naturally given processes,\nmechanisms and conditions make possible human need-meet-\ning practices which otherwise could not occur,\" that power of\npossibility, \"conferred on human agents by a specific social\nrelation to a natural condition or mechanism, will also be\nbounded in its scope by that self-same relation\" (p. 78, italics\nin original). Second, in contrast to Malthusian natural-limits\nconservatism, we must recognize that limits are contextual\nwithin specific relations between society and nature; \"what\nconstitutes a genuine natural limit for one such form of nature/\nsociety articulation may not constitute a limit for another\"\n(p. 79, italics in original). Limits to growth thus should not be\nseen as either social-limits or natural-limits simpliciter, Benton\n(1992) argued, but rather as effects of particular combinations\nof social and natural forces (p. 58). For Benton, recognition of\nthese contextual and interdependent limits through retheoriza-\ntion of the labor process returns Marxist theory to a central\nposition in the analysis of society/nature (and therefore eco-\nlogical) relations and furthers arguments for the need for trans-\nforming existing relations.\nIn contrast to the comparatively short-lived influence of\nParsons'reinterpretation model, Benton's call for a revision of\nMarx has demonstrated significant staying power. In a volume\nof essays in his honor (Moog & Stones, 2009), Sandra Moog\nprovides a testament to Benton's leading role within ecoso-\ncialist theory when she compares Benton's analysis of culture/\nnature dualism to other approaches, such as those of radical\ncludes that Benton has provided \"a fundamentally more coher-\nent approach to practical ecological politics\" (p. 40).\nRejecting Marx: Routley/Plumwood and\n\"On Karl Marx as an environmental\nhero\"\nBoth Marx's concept of transformation and the need to rec-\nognizenaturallimitsalsoplaycentralrolesinValPlumwood's\nassessment of Marx, but this green theorist was far less ame-\nnable than Benton to correcting flaws and retaining the rest.\nPlumwood, writing under her earlier surname of Routley\n(1981), set out to scrutinize characterizations of Marx as \"an\nenvironmental hero\" and quickly found him falling irrepara-\nbly short of the mark. The article in which she presented her\narguments was relatively brief, in response to a revisionist\npresentation by Donald C. Lee (1980), but during this period,\nPlumwood presented the most significant challenges to Marx\nfrom the ecocentric end of the spectrum of environmental\ntheory. She found no fault with Marx's anti-capitalist stand\nnor with Lee's extrapolation that capitalism is largely respon-\nsible for contemporary ecological crises, but she argued that\nthe project is not merely one of manipulating Marxist prin-\nciples to fit new ecological ideas:\n[I]t would be unfortunate if the attempt to work out an alternative\nnature ethic for a non-capitalist society had to take the form of\nrevamping Marx and of merely reinterpreting the radically\nunsatisfactory material he provides. Those who work for an\nenvironmentally conscious non-capitalist society need to go\nbeyond Marx and draw on a broader range of philosophical,\nethical, and socialist traditions (including the ethical traditions\nof some of the \"primitive\" societies Marxists tend to see as so\nbackward), for Marx's views on nature, and associated central\nparts of this theory, belong to the past, and are far too close to\nthose which lie at the root of many of our troubles. (p. 244)\nThe foundational problem, according to Plumwood, lies\nin Marx's concept of the relationship between humans and\nnature. Marx's declaration of unity between humans and\nnature, so applauded by Parsons and seen as theoretically\nsalvageable by Benton, is no more than a declaration of man\ncreating nature through transformation that destroys what is\nnonhuman or \"the other\" and replaces it with a humanized\nversion, Plumwood argued. Unity and harmony are achieved\nonly because nature no longer has an independent identity,\nmeaning that Marx's concept of nature as man's \"inorganic\nbody\" has not satisfied a central criterion of dialectical syn-\nthesis (p. 238). Attempts by Marxist eco-revisionists have\nfailed, and will continue to fail, Plumwood charged, due to\nthe logical impossibility of presenting Marxist theory in an\necological light. If Marx is portrayed as ecologically friendly,\npresentation of his doctrines must be obscure; if his doctrines\nare presented clearly, the portrayal must be ecologically\nPlumwood went on to delineate several specific ways in\nwhich Marx had gone wrong. First, she pointed out, Marx\nousted God from Hegel's system of order and gave humans\nthat role of creation and expression, a move that put Marxist\ntheory \"on a head-on collision course with any attempt to\ndevelop a genuine and deep environmental consciousness\"\n(p. 241). As a result, the ecology movement must dedicate\nitself to rejecting this transposition:\nThe development of environmental consciousness is in large\npart a process of discarding this Enlightenment legacy, of\nupsetting the human hubris which resulted from it and restoring\na sense of the limitation of human powers and human ability to\nunderstand, interfere with, and manipulate a larger natural order.\nIn addition, Plumwood argued, Marx's view of capitalism\nas a necessary stage in human development collapses once\nwe reject his argument that we must dominate nature to\nbecome fully human. Our need to acquire power over nature\nplayed a central role in Marx's theory of history, explaining\nthe development of classes and the final abolition of classes\nthrough technological progress, but when the principle of\nnature-transformation has been cast off, so is much of the\nrest of Marxist theory (p. 241). Plumwood also argued that\nMarx's ill-founded view of animals as inferior to humans\nmust give way to research indicating that many animals have\nconsciousness and are capable of activities that humans can-\nnot reproduce. Finally, according to Plumwood, Marx's posi-\ntion on energy use and minimization of life-sustaining labor\nwas neither plausible nor appealing in ecological terms, and\nhis acquiescence to centralization and technology cannot be\naccepted by ecologists working for decentralization and\nalternative technologies.\nAccording to Plumwood's critique, an ecologist hoping\nfor firm Marxist ground on which to take a position instead\nquickly sinks into quicksand. Rather than reinterpret Marx or\nengage in obscure attempts at reconstruction, Plumwood\nargued, the ecology movement must set aside Marx's homo-\ncentric transformation of nature and look for solid ground\ninstead. Her contention gained widespread notice at the time\nand was cited frequently within the literature surrounding the\nsearch for a red/green coalition, along with the lengthier and\nmore developed critique of Marx that Eckersley (1992) pro-\nvided a decade later. However, Plumwood's legacy as an\necological thinker arose primarily from her ecofeminist writ-\nings (e.g., Plumwood, 1993), rather than her attempt to\ndethrone Marx from his status as an ecological hero.\nTranscending Marx: Bookchin, Social\nEcology, and Dialectical Naturalism\nIn this search for solid ground, Bookchin was one green the-\norist who believed he had found it in both objective and ethi-\ncal terms. As a lifelong leftist who had moved from Marxism\nto Trotskyism to libertarian anarchism to a position he called\nlibertarian municipalism, Bookchin saw his project as one of\nusing \"the dialectical approach of Marx in order to transcend\nMarxism itself dialectically,\" in the words of his collaborator\nstream environmental movement, Bookchin argued that\nenvironmental problems are caused by institutionalized\ndomination of humans by other humans. Unlike many radi-\ncal ecologists such as Plumwood, he rejected biocentric\nmoral standing, and unlike eco-Marxists such as Parsons, he\nturned his attention beyond capitalist modes of production\nand class structures.\nIn an odd way, Bookchin's distinctive approach, called\nsocial ecology, has been at once all-encompassing and yet\npeculiarly restrictive. Even while his half century of pub-\nlished writing took on all of human history and his ideas have\nconstituted one of the most extensively developed and influ-\nential theories within the North American ecological move-\nment, social ecology as a body of work has continued to be\nidentified almost exclusively with him alone. He earned a\ndeserved reputation for brutal (but highly quotable) polemics\nagainst deep ecologists, ecofeminists, and other members of\nthe green movement who had practiced, in his view, anti-\nrational mysticism, sentimentalism, and misanthropy with\ntendencies toward eco-fascism (Bookchin, 1988). As one\n6 SAGE Open\nexample, he characterized deep ecology as \"spawned among\nwell-to-do people who have been raised on a spiritual diet of\nEastern cults mixed with Hollywood and Disneyland fanta-\nbut equally pitiless in--his attacks on theoretical colleagues\nand associates who moved too far from his own stand. Some\necological theorists became so concerned about this increas-\ning isolation and its portents that an edited volume was\ndevoted to the question of whether social ecology had a\nfuture beyond Bookchin (Light, 1998). The answer so far is\nuncertain. Since his death in 2006, new volumes continue to\nexamine and \"recover\" Bookchin's work (Price, 2012;\nWhite, 2008) and the Institute for Social Ecology, which he\nfounded, maintains momentum. However, despite the broad\nuse of the phrase \"social ecology\" in the causal analysis of\ncrime, disease, and other social ills, social ecology as a form\nof environmental political theory continues to be associated\nalmost entirely with Bookchin's work.\nWhether Bookchin's version of social ecology was able to\ndevelop through interaction with other leftist and ecological\ntraditions or stood apart in isolation, there is no doubt that his\ntheories deserve critical and constructive debate. As a liber-\ntarian anarchist/municipalist focused on questions of liberty,\nhe argued that a free society also must be an ecological soci-\nety, a foundational conclusion based on an evolutionary\napproach he called dialectical naturalism. Nature is not sim-\nply all that exists (the \"real\"), according to Bookchin (1996),\nbut an organic evolutionary development of the rational real-\nization of the potential (the \"actual\"; p. 125). From a purely\nbiological world, which he called the \"first nature,\" this pro-\ncess of potentialities moves from the inanimate to the ani-\nmate, from the simple to the complex and differentiated, from\nthe subatomic to the sentient and social human world, or the\n\"second nature.\" In The Ecology of Freedom (1991),\nBookchin traced a logical and anthropological history of soci-\nety from \"organic\" preliterate groups operating on egalitarian\nprinciples through the emergence of hierarchies based on fac-\ntors such as age, shamanism, gender, chiefdom, and eventu-\nally, classes and nation-states. Institutionalized hierarchy is\ntherefore found only among humans, as animal communities\nare not social, Bookchin argued, and the results have been\ncatastrophic. These \"organized systems of command and obe-\ndience\" sabotage the realization of the evolutionary potential\nin the second nature, through domination of humans by other\nhumans, as well as in the first nature, through domination and\ndestruction of nonhuman life and ecosystems.\nIn Bookchin's (1996) view, freedom is impossible unless\ndomination in all of its complexity is exposed and elimi-\nnated, and \"the resolution of this social crisis can only be\nachieved by reorganizing society along rational lines, imbued\nwith an ecological philosophy and sensitivity\" (p. 120). As a\nresult, his consideration of evolutionary development did not\nstop at the second nature: Dialectical naturalism\nis eductive rather than merely deductive, mediated rather than\nmerely processual, and cumulative rather than merely\ncontinuous. Its objectivity begins with the existence of the\npotential, not with the mere facticity of the real; hence its ethics\nseeks the \"what-should-be\" as a realm of objective possibilities.\nWhat should be, according to Bookchin, is an ecological\nsociety of \"free nature\" that, as synthesis, would transcend\nboth the first and second nature while maintaining their\nintegrity and specificity (p. 136).\nThis blend of ecological anarchism and dialectical reason-\ning shuns the anti-rational, misanthropic sentimentality of\nbiocentric greens, according to Bookchin, as well as consti-\ntuting a foundational critique of Marxist thought. Dialectical\nnaturalism challenges not only the reductionism of domina-\ntion introduced by feminism and mystical ecologism, he\ncharged, \"but also brings into question the one-sided econo-\nmistic simplifications that are rooted in traditional Marxian\nclass analyses.\" The importance of class should not be\nignored in ecological considerations, he cautioned, but \"class\nrule must be placed in the much larger context of hierarchy\nand domination as a whole\" (Bookchin, 1991, p. xxvi, italics\nin original).\nBookchin, like Benton, found much room for challenge in\nMarx's writings and he regularly voiced his cantankerous\ncontempt. In addition to the exclusivity of class analysis,\nMarx must be faulted for purveying the \"myth\" of the prole-\ntariat and party, in Bookchin's view. As an anarchist,\nBookchin expressed deep antagonism to Marx's vision of a\ncentralized state and, like Plumwood, he rejected the authori-\ntarian regimes that ruled in Marx's name in the 20th century.\nWhile revolutionary anarchists stressed choice, Bookchin\n(1990) wrote, Marxism focused on \"the inexorability of\nsocial laws.\" As a tragic result, \"Marxism virtually silenced\nall earlier revolutionary voices for more than a century and\nheld history itself in the icy grip of a remarkably bourgeois\ntheory of development based on the domination of nature\nIn addition, Bookchin repudiated a view that, he argued,\nMarx shared with many 19th-century philosophers: the con-\ncept of nature as a stingy provider with whom humans must\nwrestle to maintain life. This vision of natural scarcity meant\nthat liberation must be achieved, at least in part, through\ntechnological innovations that allow human command of the\nforces of nature. Without scientific and industrial know-how,\naccording to Marx, nature always holds the upper hand.\nWithout technology, surpluses are nonexistent, just enough\nto support elite rulers or, if distributed equally, a means of\nequal poverty. Liberation can be achieved only after technol-\nogy spurs development of the productive forces to a point at\nwhich humans are freed from material want and \"bread\nlabor.\" The abolition of a class system, therefore, presup-\nposes extensive technological progress. Marx's belief in\nnatural scarcity and mandatory technological development,\naccording to Bookchin's critique, thus led Marx to affirm the\nrole of domination as an inevitable part of our need to control\nthe natural world. The implications of this approach were\ndevastating, Bookchin argued. Marx believed that to conquer\nnature and its grudging provisions,\n[p]eople become instruments of production, just like the tools\nand machines they create. They, in turn, are subject to the same\nforms of coordination, rationalization, and control that society\ntries to impose on nature and inanimate technical instruments.\nLabor is both the medium whereby humanity forges its own self-\nformation and the object of social manipulation. (Bookchin,\nBookchin unfavorably compared this view to Greek polit-\nical thought, which saw men fulfilling their humanity by\nmeans of rational life within a polis. In contrast, Marx's argu-\nment that men are defined by their mode of production turned\ndomination into a technical question, not an ethical one.\nMarx's \"incredibly reductionist framework\" asked us to\njudge issues of domination in terms of technical criteria,\n\"however distasteful such a criterion might have seemed to\nMarx himself, had he faced it in all its brute clarity\" (Biehl,\nMarx not only offered a simplistic view of the revolution-\nary path to economic liberty, Bookchin argued, but provided\na stunning defense for domination itself. Marx saw classes'\nreason for existence, once they had arisen, in the pursuit of\nthe ultimate goal of the \"good life\" through domination of\nnature, which, in turn, demanded the manipulation of labor\nby an elite class of bosses. For Marx, the exploitation of\nhumans as tools of production was simply a step toward mas-\ntery of nature by humans in their pursuit of liberation under\ncommunism. His goal may have been a valuable one,\nBookchin (1991) wrote, but \"no more plausible apologia for\nthe existence of class or state rule has ever appeared over the\ncourse of history, and few have provided better excuses for\ndomination than this one\" (p. xxvii).\nDisastrously, in Bookchin's view, the conclusion to Marx's\nconcept of natural scarcity and surplus achieved through tech-\nnology was an acquiescent \"fatalism\" that saw liberation\nintrinsically tied to domination of man by man because of the\nneed to dominate nature, thus placing \"the onus for domina-\ntion primarily on the demanding forces of nature.\" That was a\nconclusion Bookchin (1996) vigorously disallowed:\nMy own writings radically reverse this very traditional view of\nthe relationship between society and nature. I argue that the idea\nof dominating nature first arose within society as part of its\ninstitutionalization into gerontocracies that placed the young in\nvarying degrees of servitude to the old and in patriarchies that\nplaced women in varying degrees of servitude to men--not in\nany endeavor to \"control\" nature or natural forces . . . Hence,\ndomination can be definitively removed only by resolving\nproblematics that have their origins in hierarchy and status, not in\nclass and the technological control of nature alone. (p. 142, n. 2)\nWhile Bookchin's critique of Marx was broad and some-\ntimes harsh, he cannot easily be placed with Plumwood as\none who called for rejection of Marxist theory; he granted\napplause to Marx's theory of commodification and many\nparts of his theory of capitalist development. Most impor-\ntantly, in terms of social ecology, Bookchin recognized his\nallegiance to Marx in two roles: first, Bookchin was a pur-\nveyor of the tradition of dialectical reasoning \"that Marx had\ninherited from Hegel and that Bookchin himself inherited\nthrough the Marxist tradition of the Enlightenment's com-\nmitment to humanism and rationalism. By remaining com-\nmitted to these parts of the Marxist inheritance, Bookchin\nbelieved, social ecology could fight the urgent battle against\ndangerous intellectual sloppiness within the ecological\nmovement. These elements, he worried, may be spurned by\n\"eco-faddists\" who \"either ignore muscularity of thought as\ntoo `heavy' or else . . . condemn it as intellectually `linear'\n\"ecologizing the dialectic\" allowed his theory to address the\ndifferentiation and potentialities of nature as well as the com-\nplex forms of social domination, thus ensuring, in his view,\nthat social ecology transcends Marx.\nConclusion\nIs Marxist theory conducive to political ecology? Answers to\nthis question clearly are not built on consensus. The Marxist\nportfolio is massive, sometimes inconsistent, and character-\nized by ambiguity, and vehement arguments in the debate\nover whether Marxist theory is ecologically sensitive have\nranged from an absolute \"yes\" to an irrevocable \"no\" to a\ngreat many versions of \"not exactly, but . . .\" Parsons'\nresponse provided a model of those Marxist defenders who\nviewed the environmental project as wholly in tune with the\nsocialist project and Marx's writings as the most appropriate\nsource of environmental theory. Benton, in contrast, repre-\nsents the large body of work that has been at once sympa-\nthetic to foundational elements of Marxist theory yet\ncognizant of the historical and theoretical weaknesses that\ndemand revision. Serving as the illustration of environmental\npolitical theorists who have found no promising basis within\nMarxist thought, Plumwood (writing as Routley) called for\nthe rejection of Marx and the construction of ecological the-\nory from other sources. Finally, working from a dialectical\nunderstanding of nature that both recognizes and undermines\nMarx, Bookchin offered a complex critique in his project of\ntranscending Marxist theory.\nfour theorists set the stage for continued, divisive, and valu-\nable analyses of ecological and Marxist theory. Their dis-\nagreements, defenses, and arguments promoted a deeper and\nmore critical understanding of Marxist theory, turning us\ntoward a crucial avenue of interrogation of Marx's under-\nstanding of humans, nature, and the environment. The debate\nremains both vigorous and contentious more than a decade\nlater, as signaled by the longevity of the neo-Marxist journal\n8 SAGE Open\nCapitalism, Nature, and Socialism and demonstrated by the\nincreasingly sophisticated analyses of Marxist theory within\nthe interdisciplinary project of political ecology and the\ngrowing subfield of environmental political thought.\nAuthors' Note\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency in\nthe public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nBennett, J.
