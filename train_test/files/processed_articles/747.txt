Increasing evidence indicates\nthat COPD may be caused partly by oxidative damage\ncoupled with a failure of antioxidants to protect lung\ntissue (3, 4). These findings suggest that antioxidant\nnutrients such as vitamin C, vitamin E, P-carotene, and\nselenium may protect against the risk of developing\nCOPD. Several published studies have reported that in\nthe general population, a higher dietary intake of vita-\nmin C and vitamin E was positively associated with\nlung function, an indicator of COPD risk (5-8).

Included were standardized respiratory\nsymptom questions and questions about smoking\n(years of smoking, current number of cigarettes\nsmoked per day, years since quitting, etc.) and vitamin\nsupplement use history (use of any vitamin supplement\nin the month prior to the interview). Further measure-\nments were taken at mobile examination centers,\nwhere subjects completed medical examinations and\nprovided blood samples for biochemical assays. All\nsubjects were asked to provide a 24-hour dietary recall\nthat was recorded by using the Dietary Data Collection\nsystem (9). Food intake data were merged with the US\nDepartment of Agriculture's survey nutrient database\nto calculate nutrient intake. Serum samples were ana-\nlyzed for total vitamin C by using high-performance\nliquid chromatography with an electrochemical detec-\ntor, and serum levels of vitamin E (a-tocopherol) and\nP-carotene were measured by using isocratic high-\nperformance liquid chromatography with detection at\ntwo different wavelengths (10).

An attached computer was pro-\ngrammed to analyze the expiratory curves, calculate\nthe key pulmonary parameters, and determine the\nacceptability of the tests. Subjects were excluded from\ntesting if they had had chest or abdominal surgery\nwithin the past 3 weeks or if they had a history of\nmyocardial infarction. Each eligible subject performed\nabout five trials, and reproducibility was checked\naccording to the recommended American Thoracic\nSociety standards. FEV, was recorded as the highest\nvalue obtained from all acceptable maneuvers.\nStatistical analysis\nThe relation of dietary or serum antioxidant nutri-\nents to FEV, was explored by using regression meth-\nods. Because of the complex, multistage probability\nsample design of NHANES HI, variance estimates in\nwhich simple random sampling is assumed are known\nto be biased (9). Thus, unbiased variance estimates for\nall regression coefficients were computed by using\nSUDAAN software (Research Triangle Institute,\nResearch Triangle Park, North Carolina). The\nNHANES HI study population was oversampled in\ncertain age groups and race groups, necessitating the\nuse of weighting variables to compute descriptive\ninformation representative of the general US popula-\ntion (9). The objective of this study was to explore bio-\nlogic relations across all major strata of the population;\nthus, the use of weighting variables was less critical.\nNevertheless, subgroup analyses were explored to\nensure that the relation between diet and lung function\nwas approximately similar across strata defined by age\nand race groups. Further analyses determined whether\nthe use of weighting variables in regression influenced\nthe results.\nPreliminary analyses determined the optimal adjust-\nment for sex, age, and height, the three most important\ndeterminants of FEV]. The height-squared propor-\ntional model (FEVi/height2 = sex + age + age2) was\noptimal when residuals and explained variance in\nFEVj (^?2) were considered. This model remained opti-\nmal when race, body mass index (weight in kilograms\ndivided by height in meters squared), and income\nindex were added.\nA second preliminary step was to find the best rep-\nresentation of cigarette smoking. Smoking is associ-\nated with both dietary and serum antioxidant levels,\nand it has well-known effects on FEV]. Thus, cigarette\nsmoking is an important confounding variable when\nassessing the association of dietary or serum antioxi-\ndants with FEV,. The number of cigarettes currently\nsmoked per day was used to assess current smoking\nexposure. Cumulative smoking exposure was assessed\nby determining pack-years (the product of the number\nof packs smoked per day and the number of years of\nsmoking), smoking duration (the number of years of\nsmoking), and the number of years since quitting (for\nformer smokers). Model development considered non-\nlinear terms for each variable, nonlinear calculation of\npack-years (e.g., the square of the number of packs\nsmoked per day multiplied by the number of years of\nsmoking), and dummy variable coding to represent\ncurrent smoking and former smoking. The final repre-\nsentation of cigarette smoking was chosen to maxi-\nmize the variance in FEV, explained by smoking.\nThe relation of each dietary antioxidant or each\nserum antioxidant to FEV] was examined separately\nand then simultaneously, but dietary and serum mea-\nsurements were always considered in separate models.\nAntioxidant Nutrients and Lung Function 977\nGiven prior interest in whether the effect of antioxi-\ndant nutrients on lung function differs according to\nsmoking status, the relation of each antioxidant to lung\nfunction also was examined by stratifying on smoking\nstatus.\nRESULTS\nThe average age of subjects included in the analysis\nSubjects excluded because of missing lung function\ndata were, on average, older and more likely to have a\nprevalent respiratory condition. Excluded subjects\nwere also more likely to be former smokers and to use\nvitamin supplements, behaviors that may partly be\nexplained by age. While such exclusions may have\nreduced the representativeness of the sample, they did\nnot affect the internal validity of the findings.\nThe baseline height-squared proportional regression\nmodel included the covariates sex, age, age2, race,\nbody mass index, and income, as well as several smok-\ning variables. The associations of these variables with\nFEV, (data not shown) were consistent with previous\nreports (12). Antioxidant nutrient status was assessed\nin two ways, by using a 24-hour dietary recall and by\nbioassay of serum samples. The dietary recall may best\nreflect short-term intake and may be subject to mis-\nclassification caused by day-to-day variation in intake\nand by other sources of measurement error (13). The\nserum nutrient level is more likely to reflect long-term\nnutrient status and nutrient bioavailability, but it may\nbe subject to physiologic homeostatic regulation.\nDietary antloxidants\nThe first series of models was used to consider each\ndietary antioxidant nutrient separately while adjusting\nfor total caloric intake (table 2). Vitamin C, vitamin E,\nand total carotene all were positively associated with\nFEVj. Dietary fat intake also was adjusted in models\nin which vitamin E was considered, because fat intake\nis related to both vitamin E intake and lung function;\ntherefore, it is a potentially confounding variable. The\nincrease in FEV, (given a height of 1.70 m) for one\nstandard deviation increase in dietary vitamin C, vita-\ntively. When all three dietary antioxidants were con-\nsidered simultaneously, the increase in FEV, for one\nstandard deviation increase in all three antioxidants\nwas 24.6 ml. Thus, the combined effect was higher\nthan the effect of any single dietary component con-\nsidered alone but was not as high as the simple sum of\nthe separate effects. In this analysis, a standard devia-\ntion increase in vitamin C, vitamin E, and carotene\nintake referred to an increase of 111 mg/day (e.g.,\nabout one and one-half cups (355 ml) of orange juice\nTABLE 1.

The associ-\nation of each nutrient with FEV] was found to vary\nsomewhat based on smoking status, but these differ-\nences were generally not statistically significant. For\ncarotene, the association of dietary intake with FEV!\nvaried by smoking status (p = 0.07 for the addition of\nthe interaction term to the regression model). Among\ncurrent smokers, the relation of carotene intake to\nFEV, was weaker when compared with the relation\namong nonsmokers and former smokers (table 2).\nSerum antioxidants\nSerum antioxidant status was considered in regres-\nsion models that examined each antioxidant separately\n(vitamin C, vitamin E, (3-carotene, and selenium) and\nthen all antioxidants simultaneously (table 3).

For a person 1.7 m tall, an\nincrease of one standard deviation in serum vitamin C,\nvitamin E, p-carotene, and selenium was associated\nFEV,, respectively. In a single model that considered\nthe simultaneous effect of all four serum antioxidants,\nall four constituents retained an independent associa-\ntion with lung function (table 3). An increase of one\nstandard deviation in all four components was associ-\nated with an increase of 93.7 ml in FEV,. The joint\neffect of 93.7 ml was slightly less than a simple addi-\ntive effect (expected 128.5 ml) because of shared vari-\nance among the serum measurements of antioxidant\nstatus. The simple correlations among serum measures\nranged from 0.3 to 0.4 for vitamins C and E and for P-\n0.01 for selenium with vitamin C, vitamin E, and p-\ncarotene, respectively). A 94 ml difference in FEV, is\nabout equivalent to the difference between people\napproximately 4 years apart in age (given that with\neach year of aging, FEV, declines by about 24 ml).\nThe potential modification of these effects by ciga-\nrette smoking was explored. While the association of\nserum vitamin C with FEV, was about the same\nacross smoking strata, the association of serum vita-\nmin E was weaker for former smokers (p -- 0.01). The\nassociation of P-carotene was weaker (p -- 0.03) and\nthat of selenium was stronger (p = 0.01) for current\nsmokers compared with nonsmokers and former\nsmokers (table 3). Current smokers were further clas-\nsified as light or heavy smokers, and the association\nof P-carotene and selenium with FEV, was examined.\nThe association of serum P-carotene decreased as the\namount of smoking increased. An increase of one\nstandard deviation in serum P-carotene was associated\nwith an increase in FEV, of 17.6 and 2.9 ml, respec-\ntively, for light and heavy current smokers. The asso-\nciation of serum selenium with lung function showed\nlittle or no difference according to current smoking\ndose. An increase of one standard deviation in serum\nselenium was associated with an increase in FEVj of\ncurrent smokers (table 3).\nThirty-six percent of the study population reported\nusing some form of vitamin supplement in the month\nbefore the study. There was little or no difference in\nFEV, between subjects who used supplements and\nthose who did not. Further analysis of the effect of spe-\ncific vitamin supplements was not possible because of\na lack of information on the specific kind of vitamin\nused and the dose taken.\nAll results shown in this paper were derived from\nregression models in which SUDAAN software was\nused to compute correct variance estimates. The\nresults were robust and were essentially unchanged in\nmodels that included the weighting variables or in\nmixed models (PROC MIXED software; SAS\nInstitute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) that included a\nrandom effect for place (primary sampling unit and\nstrata combine to yield 98 \"places\" sampled in\nDISCUSSION\nThis study examined the association of all major\nantioxidants, measured by dietary intake and by serum\nlevel, with lung function in a representative sample of\nthe US population. Each serum antioxidant was inde-\npendently associated with lung function when the four\nconstituents were considered jointly. The joint effect of\nthe dietary intake of the antioxidants was higher than\nwhen any single component was considered separately,\nalthough dietary intake of only carotene remained sta-\ntistically significant. Dietary intake of vitamin C, vita-\nmin E, and carotene was highly correlated in part\nbecause some of the food sources of the antioxidants\nare similar. This fact, coupled with the greater potential\nfor measurement error in the dietary assessment, may\nexplain the lack of an independent association when the\ndietary components were considered simultaneously.\nA strength of this study was the availability of bio-\nmarkers of nutritional status. Some nutrients, notably\nselenium, are not well assessed by dietary intake meth-\nods that use food composition tables that rely on a con-\nstant quantity of the nutrient in foods (13). In addition,\na single 24-hour recall provides inadequate information\nabout usual intake (13), and the biomarkers of nutri-\ntional status comprise exposure data that are somewhat\nmore time integrated although also subject to limita-\ntions depending on the nutrient under consideration.\nDifferent antioxidants may have different pathophys-\niologic ways of protecting lung tissue against oxidant-\ninduced damage. While vitamin C is responsible for\nmaintaining the antioxidant capacity in the aqueous\nphase of the cell, such as cytoplasm (15), vitamin E is\na major scavenger of free radicals in the lipid phase,\nsuch as in cell membranes (16). The antioxidant prop-\nerty of p-carotene depends on the oxygen pressure in\nthe microenvironment of the cell (17). Selenium is a\ncofactor for glutathione peroxidase, an important\nantioxidant enzyme (18).\nSince the antioxidants may operate via different\nmechanisms, it follows that the antioxidants consid-\nered here may exhibit different effects across cate-\ngories of smoking. The magnitude of the association of\nserum vitamin C with FEV, was about the same in the\nthree smoking groups. The magnitude of the associa-\ntion of P-carotene with lung function was weaker\namong current smokers and weaker still as the smok-\ning dose increased, and this finding was consistent\nacross dietary and serum data. The association of sele-\nnium with lung function was stronger among current\nsmokers compared with former smokers and non-\nsmokers but did not vary according to smoking dose.\nWhy does the association of a particular antioxidant\nvary by smoking status? Each antioxidant is purported\nto be positively associated with lung function because\nof its ability to neutralize oxidants that would other-\nwise damage tissue. Nonsmokers have some body bur-\nden of oxidants, which might be described as general\noxidants. Smokers have a body burden of oxidants\ncomprised of these same general oxidants and oxidants\nin cigarette smoke. At least two scenarios might exist\nthat would be consistent with the findings reported\nhere. First, some antioxidants may be more efficient\nthan others in neutralizing general versus cigarette\nsmoke oxidants. Second, the efficiency of an antioxi-\ndant may vary depending on the level of oxidant bur-\nden; that is, some antioxidants may have a stronger\neffect when the burden of oxidants is high. Either of\nthese scenarios is consistent with the finding that the\nstrength of the association of an antioxidant with lung\nfunction varies across smoking categories.\nSerum P-carotene had less of a positive association\nwith lung function among current smokers, and the\npositive effect decreased further as smoking dose\nincreased. Thus, the effect of p-carotene may decrease\nas the total quantity of oxidants increases, p-carotene\nmay be less efficient in neutralizing cigarette smoke\nversus general oxidants, or both. A recent study\nreported that rather than protecting cigarette smokers\nfrom developing lung cancer, P-carotene increased the\nrisk (19). Similarly, P-carotene and/or a-tocopherol\nsupplementation has been found to have little or no\nassociation with the incidence or recurrence of respira-\ntory symptoms in cigarette smokers (20). While the\nassociation of serum selenium with FEVf\nwas stronger\namong current smokers, there was no evidence of a\ndose-response relation. Thus, selenium may be more\nefficient in neutralizing cigarette smoke than general\noxidants, but its efficiency may not depend on the\namount of oxidant exposure.\nThe association of P-carotene and selenium with\nFEV, among former smokers was similar to that\namong nonsmokers rather than intermediate between\ncurrent smokers and nonsmokers. This finding might\nhave occurred because the average number of years\nsince quitting was about 15, making former smokers\nfar more similar to nonsmokers than to smokers, hi\naddition, current antioxidant status might not have\nbeen a good reflection of antioxidant status when for-\nmer smokers did smoke; thus, a differential effect of\nantioxidant status on lung function would not have\nbeen observed.\nThe results of the present study confirm and extend\nseveral previous reports suggesting that antioxidant\nnutrients are related to lung function. In NHANES I, a\nhigher intake of vitamin C was associated with\nincreased FEV! (6). In NHANES H, self-reported\nchronic respiratory symptoms were associated with\nlower dietary vitamin C intake and with lower serum\nselected adult subjects in Great Britain, higher dietary\nintakes of vitamin C and vitamin E were related to\nhigher FEV,; when vitamin C and vitamin E were con-\nsidered simultaneously, only vitamin C retained an\nindependent association (7). In a small study of elderly\nE was positively associated with FEV, (8). In a study\nyears), dietary vitamin C intake estimated by house-\nhold food record was positively associated with FEV,\nNHANES HI data are cross-sectional, and antioxi-\ndant status was assessed at a single point in time and\nwas measured at the same time as lung function. The\nhypothesis that antioxidants are related to better lung\nhealth posits an association of long-term antioxidant\nnutrient level with lung function, although the exact\ntiming of dietary pattern in relation to lung function\nhas not been well specified. Therefore, the relevance\nof the present analysis to the hypothesis is based on the\nassumption that current antioxidant levels represent\nusual long-term, average levels.\nNHANES III contains extensive data to characterize\nsmoking, an important confounding variable in these\nanalyses since it may be related to lower intake of\nantioxidants, differences in the metabolism of antioxi-\ndants, and clearly to lower levels of lung function. In\nmodels that did not adjust for smoking, the crude pre-\ndicted difference in FEV, associated with one standard\ndeviation increase in serum vitamin C, vitamin E, P-\nml, respectively. Thus, adjustment for smoking was a\ncritical component of these analyses, and while resid-\nual confounding by smoking cannot be ruled out, eight\nvariables were used to capture the variation in FEV,\nexplained by smoking. It is important to note that the\nconsistent associations found for nonsmokers could\nnot be explained by residual confounding by smoking.\nIn analyses limited to smokers, residual confounding\nby qualitative aspects of smoking (e.g., dose, depth of\ninhalation, and other smoking behaviors) may be pres-\nent. While residual confounding cannot explain the\nAntioxidant Nutrients and Lung Function 981\nfinding that the association of (3-carotene was weaker\nfor current smokers, we cannot exclude the possibility\nthat for current smokers, the stronger association\nobserved between selenium and FEVj was caused by\nresidual confounding. Residual confounding by other\nfactors, such as socioeconomic status, is not likely to\nhave been important since analyses with and without\nadjustment for these factors (data not shown) showed\nlittle or no differences in the coefficients for the rela-\ntion of nutrients to lung function.\nThe findings reported here are probably unique in\nthat four of the major dietary antioxidants were con-\nsidered, antioxidant status was measured by using both\ndietary assessment and bioassay of serum samples, and\nall antioxidants were associated with FEVl\nafter\nadjustment for smoking and other covariates. The\nstudy provides evidence to support the hypothesis that\nseveral antioxidants are associated with better lung\nfunction, but the cross-sectional design of NHANES\nHI precludes causal inference. It also provides evi-\ndence that the positive association of antioxidants with\nlung function differs according to smoking status, and\nthese findings merit further investigation in prospec-\ntive studies of lung disease.\n"
