Arguments regarding the Internet and its\neffects on social inclusion are reflected in the \"digital divide\" discourse, with the\npremise being that Internet access provides benefits and that not having access to the\nInternet has negative consequences. With Internet connection rates reaching high lev-\nels, a great deal of attention in digital divide research has moved away from indicators\nrelated to having an Internet connection (referred to as the first-level digital divide) to\nindicators of the second-level digital divide (Hargittai, 2002), namely, Internet skills\nand usage. More recently, attention on the outcomes of Internet use or tangible benefits\nhas increased, referred to as the third-level digital divide (Van Deursen and Helsper,\nBecause of the shift from the first-level digital divide in countries where fixed and\nmobile broadband are nearly ubiquitous, there is the potential that new technology char-\nacteristics are being ignored (Sylvester et al., 2017). The first-level digital divide still\nrequires attention because, besides having or not having an Internet connection, differ-\nences in material access must be considered (Gonzales, 2016; Van Dijk, 2005). Material\naccess includes the means required to maintain the use of the Internet over time, such as\ncomputer devices (e.g. desktops, tablets, Smart TVs), software (subscriptions), and\nperipheral equipment (e.g. printers, additional hard drives). New material divides appear\nas a result of rapidly changing technology, the large variety of devices available to the\ngeneral public, and the reality that not all of the materials provide the same online\nopportunities.\nThe current contribution empirically investigates various factors related to material\naccess in a large-scale representative sample of the Dutch population. First, we consider\nthe devices used to access the Internet and the ownership of peripherals that make the use\nof the Internet more convenient, such as additional screens and docking stations. To\nobtain a general idea of who is using the various devices and peripherals, we link these\nto important personal and positional categories and resources.\nSecond, we focus on specific aspects of material access, namely, device opportunity,\ndevice and peripheral diversity, and maintenance expenses. Device opportunity relates to\nthe replacement of devices. For example, we consider those who only use smartphones\nor tablets. Diversity relates to the total number of devices and total number of peripherals\nused. Maintenance expenses are important to sustain the level of subscriptions and\ndevices (Gonzales et al., 2016). Accordingly, we examine whether these three aspects\ndiffer among various segments of the populations.\nFinally, we focus on the role of the three material access aspects in relation to the\nsecond- and third-level digital divides. We are interested in whether they relate to\nInternet skills, to the things people do online, and to the outcomes they achieve from\nInternet use.\nThe following research questions are addressed:\n1. What factors explain the differences in the specific devices and peripherals used?\n2. What factors explain device opportunity, device diversity, and maintenance\nexpense?\n3. To what extent do device opportunity, device diversity, and maintenance expense\naffect the diversity of Internet use and its outcomes?\nvan Deursen and van Dijk 3\nBackground\nMaterial access in resources and appropriation theory\nResources and appropriation theory (Van Dijk, 2005) argues that categorical inequalities\nin society produce an unequal distribution of resources and that an unequal distribution\nof resources causes unequal access to the Internet. Access to the Internet is defined as a\nprocess of appropriation that starts with general attitudes toward the Internet and\nadvances to having physical and material access. The process of appropriation is influ-\nenced by the social and technological context of Internet use. The social context consists\nof personal and positional inequalities among users. Personal categorical inequalities\nsuch as age and gender are frequently observed in digital divide research. This is also\ntrue for the positional categorical inequalities such as job position, level of educational\nattainment, and household size. Personal and positional inequalities, according to the\ntheory, produce different resources. For example, resources that are frequently consid-\nered in digital divide research, albeit under other labels such as economic, social, and\ncultural capital, include possession, income, and access to a social network (for a review\nof inequalities between persons, positions, and resources, see Scheerder et al., 2017).\nAccording to the theory, the differences in Internet access that resources produce, rein-\nforce inequalities of participation in society and this effect therefore reflects on greater\ninequalities between persons, positions, and resources.\nAt the core of the resources and appropriation theory are the types of access to digital\ntechnology. Accordingly, material access is part of the second phase, which extends the\nbasic physical access to computers and the Internet. It is this phase that is the focus of the\ncurrent study, and thus, it will be further elaborated upon, and the resources and personal\nand positional categories will be linked to this phase. In the final section, the material\naccess phases are linked to the subsequent phases of Internet skills and Internet use and\nto the tangible benefits that are derived from this enhanced access, such as the improve-\nment of one's position in society.\nMaterial access\nTo study the material access divide in the Netherlands, we must first understand who is\nusing some specific materials. For example, the typical devices used for accessing the\nInternet and going online are desktop and laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones.\nOther devices that are increasingly used to access the Internet are game consoles and\nSmart TVs. Furthermore, there is a large variety of peripheral equipment available,\namong which the most common are printers, scanners, additional screens and hard\ndrives, and docking stations. Each of these additions support the user by offering a more\ngratifying online experience.\nThree aspects are important when focusing on material access inequalities, namely,\n(1) differences in device opportunities, or the use replacement of a device by other\ndevices with different technical capacities; (2) differences in the diversity of devices and\nperipherals; and (3) differences in the maintenance costs of devices and peripherals. All\nthree aspects are dependent on technical characteristics. The most studied differences in\ntechnical capacities are the use of desktops and laptop computers versus smartphones\nand tablets. Although the latter have advantages such as their mobility, convenience,\nprice, more continuous Internet use (Mossberger et al., 2012), and increasingly provide\nadditional possibilities besides location services, game playing, and video streaming,\nthey are not a substitute for desktop or laptop computers. They offer lower memory, stor-\nage capacity, and speed; less advanced applications (Akiyoshi and Ono, 2008; Mossberger\net al., 2012); and limited content availability (Napoli and Obar, 2014). Smartphones and\ntablets also offer less control over Internet use as specific platforms embedded in closed\nsystems are used in which manufacturers have high levels of control (Napoli and Obar,\n2014). They also provide less support as the platforms are often less compatible with\nprotocols and standards (Murphy et al., 2016). Their smaller screen sizes, greater scroll-\ning requirements, and reduced functionality when typing result in an increased cognitive\nimpact behavioral patterns and tendencies, and a broad array of Internet outcomes\n(Napoli and Obar, 2014). Overall, Internet access on smartphones and tablets contributes\nto diminished levels of user engagement, content creation, and information seeking\n(Napoli and Obar, 2014). Desktop and laptop computers allow users to participate in a\ngreater breadth of activities (Davison and Cotton, 2003; Mossberger et al., 2012; Zickuhr\nand Smith, 2012). Smartphones and tablets are used relatively often for leisure purposes\n(gaming and social networking) and personal safety, and desktop and laptop computers\nare more task- or work-based (Murphy et al., 2016; Pearce and Rice, 2013; Zillien and\nHargittai, 2009). Information seeking, for example, is more superficial when using a\nsmartphone or tablet, whereas searches on a desktop are much more immersive\nFollowing the above reasoning, when considering differences in device opportunity,\nsome combinations of devices are less likely to be beneficial than others in providing a\nwider variety of Internet uses and outcomes. Using only desktop or laptop computers\nresults in relatively few opportunities for continuous communication, entertainment, and\nlocation-based activities, while smartphone and tablet users will only miss out on more\nimmersive Internet work in a relative sense, even as mobile devices further increase in\nfunctionality. However, a common trend among younger generations and minority\ngroups is the replacement of desktops and laptops with tablets and smartphones. In terms\nof digital inequality, these replacements may have fewer potential uses (Napoli and Obar,\n2017), while the combination of desktops or laptops with smartphones or tablets offers a\nbroad range of opportunities. For this reason, those who only use smartphones or tablets\nare referred to as a \"mobile underclass\" (Napoli and Obar, 2014).\nThe technical characteristics are also important when considering differences in\ndevice and peripheral diversity. The use of more devices offers opportunities for a better\nand more diverse Internet experience (Donner et al., 2011). The same is true with respect\nto peripheral equipment in that the use of a greater variety of peripherals will lead to a\nmore satisfying Internet experience. Being able to print materials found online at home,\nscan files to be uploaded, use an additional screen for multitasking and have access to an\nadditional hard drive for storing downloaded or created multimedia all provide specific\nadvantages.\nThe final aspect to consider is the maintenance expenses of devices and peripher-\nvan Deursen and van Dijk 5\nbecome unstable, breakdown, or require software updates. Accordingly, the actual\npurchase price of a device is only a small part of the total cost of ownership, as one\nmust consider the additional expenses associated with the hardware such as devices\nand peripherals, repair costs, and software licensing costs. Even though the vast\nmajority of people in western countries are now able to access the Internet, these\nnumbers do not accurately reflect the ability to reliably maintain that access\nResources as a cause for differences in material access\nFor material access, economic resources are likely to play an important role, specifically,\nthe income required to acquire and sustain Internet use. We expect that people with high\nincomes own a multitude of (the best) devices and peripherals. They own more desktop\nand laptop computers, as well as more game consoles compared to those with lower\nincomes (e.g. Jansen, 2010). People with low incomes are more likely to own second-\nhand devices and to experience malfunctioning hardware and software. Although most\nof the lower economic groups now use Internet technology, access is unstable and char-\nacterized by frequent periods of disconnection (Gonzales, 2016). Similar situations may\noccur in relation to Internet subscriptions, which are likely to be better and more expen-\nsive among those with higher incomes. Those with lower income are more likely to only\nhave Internet access on their smartphone, whereas those with higher incomes have\nInternet access on smartphones and other devices such as laptops and desktops (Tsetsi\nand Hains, 2017). We hypothesize the following:\nH1a. Income contributes positively to device opportunity, device diversity, peripheral\ndiversity, and device maintenance.\nIn addition to income, we expect social resources to play a role in material access.\nSocial support is a general indication of social capital--the accumulated sum of\nmutual acquaintances--that due to its durability, is a structural resource embodied\nby one's social network (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992). When devices or peripher-\nals are purchased, social resources enable the receipt of support and maintenance in\nthe event of a malfunction. People with access to other Internet users in their own\nhousehold are also in a better position to share devices, peripherals, and subscrip-\ntions. In this respect, a lack of social support can have a negative impact on the adop-\ntion and purchase of devices and peripherals. Hence, the availability of support\n(quantity) and the level of satisfaction with the support received (quality) are depend-\nent on the available resources (Helsper and Van Deursen, 2017). We hypothesize the\nfollowing:\nH1b. Support quantity contributes positively to device opportunity, device diversity,\nperipheral diversity, and device maintenance.\nH1c. Support quality contributes positively to device opportunity, device diversity,\nperipheral diversity, and device maintenance.\nPersonal and positional inequalities as causes for differences in material\naccess\nDigital divide research suggests that the most-observed personal categories affecting\nInternet access are gender, age, and ethnicity (Scheerder et al., 2017). In the developed\nworld, the use of the Internet by both men and women continually increases as they are\nfaced with the same digital technology at work, at school, and at home (Van Dijk, 2005).\nNonetheless, gender remains a significant factor impacting Internet use over time in\ncountries with high Internet penetration (Helsper and Reisdorf, 2017). Gender-based ste-\nreotypes suggest that women are less technologically competent (Dholakia and Chiang,\n2003). Furthermore, while it has been argued that women are at a natural disadvantage\nbecause they purportedly lack technological skills and are more technophobic, there is\nalso the argument that the technology itself does not meet women's needs (Hilbert,\n2011). Research demonstrates that while both males and females access the Internet and\nmobile devices, substantive differences exist in the particular devices they use (Odaci\nand Kalkan, 2010). We hypothesize the following:\nH2a. Men are more likely than women to have more access to device opportunities,\ndevice diversity, peripheral diversity, and device maintenance.\nWith respect to age, young people have more and earlier access to all types of devices\nthat are used to connect to the Internet. For example, mobile communication is now a\ncondition in the everyday lives of young people (Ling, 2012), and as a result, they such\nas new inventions and innovations and are far more likely to experiment with new\ndevices and peripherals. Accordingly, seniors remain the section of the population that is\nthe least likely to have access to the Internet, despite the benefits that such access affords\nthem (Baker, 2013). Think of transcending social and spatial barriers, maintaining and\nenhancing social networks, and providing a greater sense of connection to the world\n(Winstead et al., 2013). Unfortunately, a lack of interest, high costs, ergonomic impedi-\nments, complexity (Carpenter and Buday, 2007), knowledge (Gitlow, 2014), and anxiety\nabout new technologies and low technology self-efficacy (Lam and Lee, 2006; Vroman\net al., 2015) are all important barriers that interfere with the willingness of seniors to\nadopt new technology. We hypothesize the following:\nH2b. Age contributes negatively to device opportunity, device diversity, peripheral\ndiversity, and device maintenance.\nIn countries populated by minorities born in other countries (parents or children),\nthere are often significant gaps in Internet access between the majority population and\nthese minority groups. Related research on ethnicity, though not equivalent to immigra-\ntion status, suggests that they are very active mobile device users, in contrast with the\nrelatively low levels of desktop and laptop ownership among minority groups (Cotton,\nH2c. Majorities are more likely than minorities to have access to device opportunity,\ndevice diversity, peripheral diversity, and device maintenance.\nvan Deursen and van Dijk 7\nFactors driving the distribution of resources and Internet access are positional categories,\nthe first of which fall under work and education. Physical access hinges on several resources\nthat include education and employment (Gonzales, 2016). Those who are more highly edu-\ncated and who are employed are more digitally engaged, and benefit more from technology\nin their everyday lives (Clayton and Macdonald, 2013). We hypothesize the following:\nH2d. Those who are employed are more likely to have access to device opportunity,\ndevice diversity, peripheral diversity, and device maintenance expenses than those\nwho are not employed.\nH2e. Educational level of attainment contributes positively to device opportunity,\ndevice diversity, peripheral diversity, and device maintenance.\nLower levels of social isolation (e.g. not living alone or being in a relationship)\nimprove one's chances of engaging with the Internet (e.g. Van Deursen and Helsper,\n2015). Marital status and household composition are often considered in digital divide\nresearch. We expect that the presence of children affects material access, as they often\nhave their own devices for tasks such as school work. We hypothesize the following:\nH2f. Married people or households with two or more adults are more likely than those\nwho are single, divorced, widowed, or living alone to have access to device opportu-\nnity, device diversity, peripheral diversity, and device maintenance.\nH2g. Having children in the household contributes positively to device opportunity,\ndevice diversity, peripheral diversity, and device maintenance.\nInternet attitudes as a cause for inequalities in material access\nThe core of resource and appropriation theory describes the process of Internet appro-\npriation in which having material access is a second phase. The first phase is having\nmotivational access. Van Dijk's (2005) notion of motivational access is primarily shaped\nby attitudes toward technology, which are crucial to using it (Venkatesh et al., 2003).\nNegative attitudes such as computer anxiety, decrease the likelihood that an individual\nwill access the Internet (Dutton and Reisdorf, 2017; Reisdorf and Groselj, 2017; Van\nDijk, 2005). Internet anxiety is characterized by avoidance, by the expression of negative\ncomments about the Internet and its effects on society, and by attempts to minimize the\ntime spent using the Internet (Durndell and Haag, 2002; Rockwell and Singleton, 2002).\nThus, we hypothesize the following:\nH3. Internet attitude is positively correlated with device opportunity, device diversity,\nperipheral diversity, and device maintenance.\nMaterial access as a cause for differences in skills, uses, and outcomes\nThe final objective is to test the role of the three aspects of material access in the total\nprocess of appropriating digital technology. Prior research revealed that the quality of\ncomputer equipment, the age of the computer used, and Internet pricing affect the\nquality of Internet use at home (Zillien and Hargittai, 2009). Technology appropria-\ntion is a process with four successive phases or access types. After adopting a favora-\nble attitude toward the Internet and acquiring physical and material access, one must\npossess Internet skills (Van Dijk, 2005). Internet skills are known to vary considerable\namong segments of the population (e.g. Hargittai et al., 2018; Van Deursen and Van\nDijk, 2011). In addition to Internet skills, Internet usage is part of the second-level\ndigital divide and can be defined in terms of frequency and the type of activities per-\nformed, both of which have their own grounds of determination (e.g. Blank and\nGroselj, 2014; Van Deursen and Van Dijk, 2014). The process of Internet access even-\ntually affects the outcomes of Internet use (Helsper, 2012; Van Dijk, 2005). We add\nthree types of material access to the discussed resources and positional and personal\ndeterminants to predict the subsequent phases of Internet access--skills, uses, and\noutcomes. The goal is to establish the independent effect of material access aspects on\nthe second- and third-level digital divide. We hypothesize the following:\nH4. (a) Device opportunity, (b) device diversity, (c) peripheral diversity, and (d)\ndevice maintenance contribute positively to Internet skills, Internet use diversity,\nInternet use frequency, and Internet outcomes.\nMethod\nSample\nThe present study uses an online survey and draws on a sample collected in the\nNetherlands. To obtain a representative sample of the Dutch population, we used\nPanelclix, a professional organization for market research to provide a panel of approx-\nimately 110,000 people. Members of the panel receive a small incentive for every\nsurvey they complete. In the Netherlands, 98% of the population uses the Internet;\ntherefore, the user population is very representative of the general population in terms\nof its sociodemographic makeup. The panel includes novice and advanced Internet\nusers. In total, we aimed to obtain a dataset with approximately 1600 respondents over\nthe age of 18. Eventually, this resulted in the collection of 1698 responses over a\n2-week period in February 2018. During the data collection period, amendments to the\nsampling frame were made to ensure the representativity of the Dutch population.\nAccordingly, the analyses revealed that the gender, age, and formal education of our\nrespondents largely matched official census data. As a result, only a small post hoc\ncorrection was needed. The sample had the following composition: gender: 49.1%\n(e.g. high school) 39%, high (e.g. college and university) 29%; occupation: employed\nethnicity: born in the Netherlands 95%, born outside the Netherlands 5%.\nThe online survey used software that checked for missing responses and then\nprompted users to respond. The survey was pilot tested with 10 Internet users over two\nrounds. Amendments were made based on the feedback provided. No major comments\nvan Deursen and van Dijk 9\nwere provided in the second round. The average time required to complete the survey\nMeasures\nTo answer the first research question, the first set of dependent variables are the specific\ndevices and peripherals used. We included desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, Smart\nTV, and game console. All are coded as dichotomous variables, indicating \"no use\" or\n\"use.\" The same is done for the peripheral equipment used. We considered printer, scan-\nner, additional screen, additional hard drive, and docking station.\nTo study device opportunity, we considered two conditions that both provide a limited\nset of opportunities. The first condition consists of only using a desktop and/or laptop\n(13%), and the second condition of only using a tablet and/or smartphone (6%).\nTo account for the diversity of devices and peripherals, we considered the total num-\nber of devices used to connect to the Internet (M=2.94, SD=1.35) and the total number\nThe final dependent variable considered maintenance expenses and was measured by\nthe annual amount spent in euros on hardware and software (categorized as<50, 51 to\nMaterial resources were incorporated as income and were measured by using the total\nfamily income over the last 12months, assessed on an 8-point scale. Based on the census\ndata, three categories were created--low, middle, and high income.\nSocial resources were represented by support quantity and was measured by asking\nrespondents how many people in the home use the Internet (M=2.31, SD=1.16). The\nhome or household is the most proximate context for support. Other contexts include\nwork, social networks, neighbors, and so on. The survey offered no data regarding these\ncontexts. Support quality was measured by asking the respondent to think about the last\ntime they asked for help when using the Internet, followed by the question \"How much\nconfidence do you have that you can now solve the same problem yourself?\" A 5-point\nscale was used that ranged from \"no confidence at all\" to \"high confidence\" (M=2.31,\nThe first personal indicator considered was age. This was computed by subtracting\nthe reported year of birth from the survey year. Age was subsequently divided into four\n(M/F), as was majority (born in the Netherlands) or minority (born outside the\nNetherlands) status.\nSeveral positional categories were considered. First, employment statuses were coded\nas dummy variables, specifically, employed, retired, disabled, househusbands/wives,\nunemployed, and students. Education was collected by degree as 1 of 10 categories and\nfollowed the Dutch educational system classification. These data were subsequently\ndivided into groups of low, middle, and high educational level.\nInternet attitude was measured by four items adapted from the digital motivation\nscale of Helsper, Smirnova and Robinson (2017). All items are balanced for the direction\nof response (5-point scale, M=3.88, SD=0.76). A sample statement included the follow-\ning: `Technologies such as the Internet and mobile phones make life easier'.\nInternet skills were measured using the Internet Skills Scale (Van Deursen et al., 2016).\nThis 20-item instrument covers operational, information navigation, social, and creative\ncomponents and is used in this study as a single skill set. All items were scored on a\n5-point scale that ranged from \"Not at all true of me\" to \"Very true of me\" and exhibited\nhigh internal consistency (=.89; M=3.66; SD=0.73). Examples of items are \"I know\nhow to open downloaded files,\" `I find it hard to decide what the best keywords are to use\nfor online searches', and `I know which information I should and shouldn't share online'.\nInternet use diversity was adapted from Van Deursen et al. (2017), and covers a range\nof 36 different uses including economic (savings, earnings, employment, finances, and\ndegrees), cultural (identity and belonging), social (political and civic participation, and\nbridging and bonding ties), and personal (health, leisure, and self-actualization) domains.\nRespondents were asked to indicate how often they conducted each specific activity. A\n\"No use\" answer was coded as a 0, and all other frequencies as 1. A composite measure\nof Internet use diversity was created by summing the items (M=18.82; SD=5.94).\nInternet use frequency was measured by asking respondents how often they use the\nInternet, using a 5-point scale ranging from \"less than monthly\" to \"multiple times a\nInternet outcomes was adapted from Van Deursen et al. (2017) and covers a range of\n26 different outcomes related to the same domains as considered for Internet usage.\nRespondents were asked, for each outcome, to what extent they agreed that they had\nachieved or received that outcome (5-point scale). Agreeing and fully agreeing were\ncoded as 1, and all other options as 0. A composite measure was created by summing the\nitems (M=5.91; SD=4.42). Examples of items are \"I save money by buying products\nonline', `I have a better relationship with my friends and family because I use the\nInternet', and \"Online entertainment made me feel happier.\"\nAnalysis\nRegarding the first research question, we used logistic regression analyses to identify the\nsignificant predictors of the separate devices and peripherals considered. For the second\nresearch question, we used linear regression analysis to analyze the contributors to device\ndiversity, peripheral diversity, and device maintenance expenses. Logistic regression was\nused to analyze the contributors to the two conditions of device opportunity. In all analy-\nses, we added the independent personal and positional variables, the resources, and\nInternet attitude. For the final research question, we conducted linear regression analyses\nwhere device opportunity, device diversity, and peripheral diversity were added to the\nlist as independent variables. Dependent variables included Internet skills, Internet use,\nand Internet outcomes.\nResults\nDifferences in devices and peripherals used\nAmong the Dutch population, the following devices are used to go online: desktop\nvan Deursen and van Dijk 11\nconsole (12%). Table 1 indicates that those between 18 and 36years are less likely to use\ndesktops compared to the older age groups and are also less likely to use tablets com-\npared to those between 36 and 65years old. Furthermore, those between 18 and 36years\nare more likely to use smartphones, Smart TVs, and game consoles. In addition, Table 1\nreveals that men are more likely to use desktop computers, Smart TVs and game con-\nsoles to go online, while women are more inclined to use tablets. Majorities are more\nlikely to use tablets and smartphones than minorities.\nTable 1 indicates that compared to those who are employed, those who are unem-\nployed are less likely to use laptops and tablets; those who are disabled are less likely to\nuse a desktop or tablet computer, and househusbands/wives are less likely to use\nTable 1.

The\nlevel of educational attainment affects the use of laptops, which is higher for highly edu-\ncated individuals than it is for those with lower levels of education, whereas the use of\ngame consoles to access the Internet is more common among those who are somewhat\n(mid-level) educated compared to those who have a low level of education. Those with\nchildren in the household are less likely to use a laptop than those without children, and\nwidowers and divorced people are more likely to use a smartphone than those who are\nmarried. The latter are less likely to use a tablet.\nIncome positively affects the use of tablets, smartphones, and Smart TVs. Support\nquantity positively contributes to the use of smartphones, and support quality is posi-\ntively related to the use of laptops, smartphones, and game consoles. Finally, Internet\nattitude positively affects the use of laptops, tablets, smartphones, and Smart TVs for\nonline access.\nThe following peripherals are used: printer (89%), scanner (50%), additional screen\n(10%), hard drive (37%), and docking station (6%). Table 2 indicates that personal ine-\nqualities emerge for gender, age, and majority status. Men are more likely to use addi-\ntional screens. Compared to those aged 16\u00ad35, older age groups are more likely to use\nprinters and scanners. Those aged over 65 are less likely to use additional screens, and\nthose aged over 50 are less likely to use additional hard drives. Minorities are less likely\nto use additional screens and hard drives.\nCompared to those who are employed, those who report a disability are less likely to\nuse additional screens, and students are more likely to use scanners. Those with higher\nlevels of education are more likely to use scanners, additional screens, or docking sta-\ntions compared to those who have lower educational qualifications, while those who are\nsomewhat well-educated are more inclined to use additional screens.\nFinally, income positively contributes to the use of additional hard drives and docking\nstations, while support quantity affects the use of printers and additional hard drives.\nSupport quality positively impacts the use of scanners, additional screens, and additional\nhard drives. Similarly, Internet attitude positively affects the use of scanners, additional\nscreens, and additional hard drives.\nDevice opportunity. With respect to device opportunity, on one hand, we considered people\nwho only use desktop and/or laptop computers, and on the other hand, people who only\nuse a tablet and/or smartphone. Both situations result in a limited variety of uses, and thus\nprovide fewer opportunities compared to situations in which desktop and/or laptop com-\nputers are combined with smartphones and/or tablets. Table 3 reveals that people aged\nover 50 are more likely to only use desktop and/or laptop computers, while the youngest\nage group is more likely to only use a smartphone and/or tablet. People in the Dutch\nmajority, lower income, less access to support, and higher levels of Internet attitude groups\nare less likely to only use desktop and/or laptops. Internet attitude also contributes nega-\ntively to only using smartphone and/or tablets. Finally, compared to employed people,\nthose who report a disability are more likely to suffer from lower device opportunity.\nDevice and peripheral diversity. With respect to the diversity of devices used to access\nthe Internet, users on average connect to the Internet with 2.94 devices (SD=1.35),\nvan Deursen and van Dijk 13\nand they use 1.93 peripherals (SD=0.98). Columns two and three in Table 4 indicate\nthe predictors of device and peripheral diversity. Whereas both device diversity and\nperipheral diversity are higher among men, age is a negative contributor in device\ndiversity but a positive factor in peripherals diversity. Furthermore, both device and\nperipheral diversity are greater among citizens of the Dutch majority. Compared to\nthe employed, househusbands/wives use fewer devices to connect to the Internet, and\nstudents use more peripherals. Those with higher levels of education have higher\ndevice and peripheral diversity than those with low levels of education, and married\npeople exhibit greater peripheral diversity than do widowers and people with no chil-\ndren in the household. Finally, income, support quality, support quantity, and Internet\nattitude contribute positively to both device and peripheral diversity.\nTable 2.

For example, the table indicates that men have higher mainte-\nnance expenses than women (which might relate to the fact they are more likely to own\ndesktops, game consoles, and Smart TVs) and that employed people have more mainte-\nnance expenses than do unemployed and disabled individuals. Similarly, widowers have\nhigher expenses than married individuals and those in relationships. Finally, income,\nsupport quantity and quality, and Internet attitude have positive effects on annual main-\ntenance expenses.\nOverview of the hypotheses test results (Table 5).\nEffect of material access on skills, usage, and outcome diversity\nTable 6 indicates that for Internet skills, in addition to the significant contributions of age,\nemployment, education, support quantity, support quality, and Internet attitude, there are\nTable 3.

The next step is Internet usage, which entails both diversity and\nfrequency of use. With respect to diversity, besides the added Internet skills, it has also been\ndetermined that device, device opportunity (smartphone/laptop only), device diversity, and\nmaintenance expenses contribute as expected. Furthermore, device opportunity (smart-\nphone/laptop only) and maintenance expenses are positively related to use frequency. While\nInternet skills and Internet use diversity are important contributors to gaining Internet out-\ncomes, device diversity was found to make a positive, independent contribution.\nTable 7 provides an overview of the hypotheses test results.\nDiscussion\nMain findings\nAcommon opinion among policy-makers is that the digital divide problem is solved when\na country's Internet connection rate reaches saturation. However, scholars of the second-\nlevel digital divide have concluded that the divides in Internet skills and type of use con-\ntinue to expand even after physical access is universal. Furthermore, several studies have\nhighlighted the continued importance of attitude and material dimensions (e.g. Gonzales,\nstudy confirms the importance of both dimensions in the Netherlands, a rich and techno-\nlogically advanced country where 98% of the population now has home Internet access.\nMore specifically, in the current study, material access was conceptualized as device\nopportunity, device and peripheral diversity, and maintenance expenses, which are all\nimportant dimensions that differ among segments of the population.\nIn light of the first two research questions, age, gender, majority status, employment,\neducation level, and household composition, as well as material resources (income),\nsocial resources (quantity and quality of support), and Internet attitudes are all related\nto unequal ownership of devices and peripherals. Furthermore, there are systematic dif-\nferences in the material access dimensions, as these are strongly associated with Internet\nDevice\nopportunity\nDevice\ndiversity\nPeripheral\ndiversity\nMaintenance\nexpenses\n\nH2d Employment\n(employed vs rest)\n- - Ns - Partially supported\nH2e Education Ns + + Ns Partially supported\nH2f Marital status\n(married vs rest)\n- Ns - - Partially supported\nH2g Children\nat home (n/y)\n- Ns - Ns Rejected\nH3.

Furthermore, males, majorities,\nand the employed, well-educated, and married people benefit most in terms of material\naccess. In most cases, this is also true for younger people. However, we also found that\nyounger people are more likely to only use a tablet or smartphone (while the overall\npercentage is low), confirming the existence of an age-related \"mobile underclass\"\n(Napoli and Obar, 2014) in the Netherlands. While mobile devices rapidly increase in\nfunctionality, they should not be considered equal to desktop and laptop computers.\nBoth offer their own specific advantages, suggesting that using only mobile or nonmo-\nbile devices limits the potential range of Internet activities and outcomes. Overall, the\nfindings suggest that common digital divide indicators appear in our conceptualization\nof material access, suggesting that attention to the first-level digital divide remains\nimportant.\nThis becomes even more apparent in light of the third research question, which was\nposed to better understand what these differences in material access imply for Internet\nskills, use, and outcomes. The findings show that device opportunity is related to Internet\nskills and Internet-use frequency and diversity. Using a higher diversity of devices is\nrelated to a higher diversity of Internet use and more Internet outcomes. Furthermore,\nhaving more maintenance expenses contributes to Internet skills, and Internet-use fre-\nquency and diversity. Thus, the first-level divides accounted for in the current study\ncontribute to second- and third-level divides. By extending basic physical access com-\nbined with material access, the study finds that the opportunities these devices offer,\ndiversity in the access to devices and peripherals, and ongoing expenses required to\nmaintain the hardware, software, and subscriptions all relate to inequalities in Internet\nskills, uses, and outcomes.\nNoteworthy is the role of Internet attitude, which is not only important for all mate-\nrial access variables but also for Internet skills and uses. This confirms that Internet\nattitudes are stronger than many socioeconomic variables and that they are very impor-\ntant at the beginning of the process of Internet appropriation (Van Dijk, 2005). Internet\nattitude should also be considered as part of the first-level digital divide--the psycho-\nlogical part. Apparently, attitudes toward the Internet are still as important as they were\ntwo decades ago (see also Helsper and Reisdorf, 2017; Reisdorf and Groselj, 2017).\nThis study confirms that the digital divide is a reality that is here to stay, not only in\nterms of attitude, skills, type of use, and Internet outcomes but also in terms of material\naccess. Accordingly, this also applies to rich and connected countries in the world.\nPolicy-makers who aim to reduce the digital divide must not neglect or forget about the\nfirst level.\nTable 7.

Although the considered aspects provide a comprehensive view of material\naccess, we did not account for the quality of the devices under investigation. For exam-\nple, processor speeds differ between laptops. Future studies may account for more tech-\nnical details regarding the devices under investigation, as it is likely that differences\nbetween tablet use, for example, are greater among population categories when the tech-\nnical capacities of tablets are considered. Furthermore, given the rapid changes in smart-\nphone capabilities, it is important to revisit questions of the digital divide with respect to\nmobile technology (Hargittai and Kim, 2010). In this case, differences in device oppor-\ntunity might decrease between devices. However, it could also mean that inequality in\nthe technical potential of devices is growing.\nIn this study, we have revealed that inequalities in material access are present in the\nNetherlands. Structural differences appear when particular segments of the population\nsystematically and over longer periods of time take advantage of better devices and\nperipherals, while others use devices that enable fewer opportunities. Future research\nshould determine whether there is growth or reduction in the multiple material access\ngaps identified in this article, from a longitudinal perspective.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nReferences\nAkiyoshi M and Ono H (2008) The diffusion of mobile Internet in Japan.
