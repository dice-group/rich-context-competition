In Study 1, participants viewed\nposters from a breastfeeding campaign; many anticipated negative reaction to the campaign. In Study 2, participants\nviewed novel infant-feeding posters; breastfeeding posters were viewed for less time than bottle-feeding posters,\nregardless of the task assigned. In Study 3, participants were asked to rate their comfort level viewing infant-feeding\nimages; greater discomfort was reported for breastfeeding images. Taken together, we argue that many young adults\nexpect, and experience, discomfort viewing breastfeeding, but it is important to continue using breastfeeding images in\npromotion efforts.\n",

In a\nfocus group of mothers who chose to formula feed their\ninfants, most mothers felt that formula was \"just as good as\nor better than breast milk\" (Bonia et al., 2013: 4), and that\nit was more convenient because feedings could be shared\nwith others (e.g. partners could participate in feeding), giv-\ning the mother her independence. Mothers also reported\nbeing uncomfortable about the idea of breastfeeding in\npublic; the view that one would have to breastfeed in\nprivate or cover up while breastfeeding also contributed to\nthe perception that formula feeding was more convenient.\nUsing breastfeeding images to promote\nbreastfeeding among young adults\nErin L Austen, Joey Dignam and Petra Hauf\n Keywords\nbreastfeeding, health promotion, memory, perception, students\nSt. Francis Xavier University, Canada\nCorresponding author:\nErin L Austen, Department of Psychology, St. Francis Xavier University,\nEmail: eausten@stfx.ca\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nGiven the many barriers to breastfeeding, the appeal of\nformula, and the many factors that positively influence\nwhether a mother breastfeeds, the WHO's goal of increas-\ning the breastfeeding duration rate will require a myriad of\nsolutions and approaches (e.g. reducing inequalities and\nensuring access to care, improving breastfeeding supports\nat all levels, and increasing the scope of breastfeeding\npromotion efforts). Expanding the scope of breastfeeding\npromotion is the focus of this research.\nBreastfeeding promotion through\nthe lens of the Theory of Planned\nBehavior\nThe Theory of Planned Behavior (e.g. Ajzen, 1991) sug-\ngests that whether an individual engages in a behavior (e.g.\nbreastfeeding), depends on factors such as their intention to\nengage in the behavior, their attitudes toward the behavior,\nand the subjective norms for that behavior (e.g. do people\nsupport the behavior, is there pressure to engage in the\nbehavior?). In the context of breastfeeding, for example,\nmothers who report the intent to breastfeed are more likely\nto initiate breastfeeding, and breastfeeding duration is\ngreater among those with higher intentions (e.g. Donnan\nwho reported an intention to breastfeed for 12\nmonths or\nmore were less likely to discontinue early (DiGirolamo\net al., 2005). Breastfeeding intentions are higher among\nthose individuals who believe that they can breastfeed suc-\ncessfully, have a positive attitude toward breastfeeding,\nwho believe that breastfeeding is socially acceptable, and\nwho believe that others support the decision to breastfeed\nthat an intention to engage in mixed-feeding (a combina-\ntion of bottle-feeding and breastfeeding) was predicted by\nthe reported perception of bottle-feeding or mixed feeding\nas the social norm.\nUnfortunately, negative media coverage of breastfeed-\ning can become an obstacle for improving breastfeeding\nrates since it can influence perceptions of subjective norms\nfor the behavior. Research suggests that when breastfeed-\ning is represented in film or television programming, for\nexample, it is often presented as being problematic relative\nPotter et al., 2000). Similarly, many news articles that refer-\nence breastfeeding tend to highlight individual cases where\nbreastfeeding mothers were asked to cover up or to leave a\npublic location, suggesting that breastfeeding in public is\nthere is uncertainty about how others will respond to seeing\nbreastfeeding, or where bottle-feeding is perceived as the\nsocial norm, breastfeeding initiation and duration rates suf-\nGiven that young adults are frequent consumers of mass\nmedia content (e.g. Lenhart, 2015), a negative media por-\ntrayal of breastfeeding could negatively impact this demo-\ngraphic's views on breastfeeding. Ensuring that this\ndemographic sees positive examples of breastfeeding is\nparticularly important since decisions about whether to\nbreastfeed are made early on, even before individuals have\nchildren (e.g. Fairbrother and Stanger-Ross, 2010;\n2007). Furthermore, exposure to breastfeeding is linked to\nmore positive attitudes toward breastfeeding (including\npublic breastfeeding) and a greater intent to breastfeed\none's own child (e.g. Goulet et al., 2003; Marrone et al.,\ndate, however, little is known about how young adults react\nwhen they are exposed to breastfeeding. While using\nbreastfeeding images to promote breastfeeding may be one\nway to help counteract any negative media coverage of\nbreastfeeding and to positively influence the perceived\nsocial norms around breastfeeding (see Giles et al., 2014),\nthe impact of these efforts could be weakened if viewers\nrespond negatively to seeing breastfeeding. Thus, it is\nimportant to assess young adults'reactions to being exposed\nto breastfeeding or breastfeeding images.\nYoung adults' reactions to\nbreastfeeding\nMuch of what we know about how young adults react to\nseeing breastfeeding is through survey data assessing opin-\nions about breastfeeding in public, and from responses to\nSpurles and Babineau, 2011). From such data, it is clear that\nanticipated reactions to seeing breastfeeding are largely\nnegative among young adults. In a sample of university stu-\ndents from the Southeast United States, for example,\n67.8percent of those surveyed reported that breastfeeding in\npublic was unacceptable behavior, and 77.7percent reported\nthat it should only be done in private because it was an act\nof intimacy (Spear, 2007). Close to half of a sample of stu-\ndents surveyed from a Nursing program within the same\nregion felt that women should not breastfeed in public\npercent of female and\n47.7percent of male undergraduate students, sampled from\nthe University of Tennessee, indicated that public breast-\nfeeding is embarrassing and unacceptable (Kavanagh et al.,\n2012). The majority of university-educated focus group par-\nticipants in Eastern Canada also shared the view that public\nbreastfeeding had to be done discreetly, or in designated\nareas, for it to be acceptable (Spurles and Babineau, 2011).\nIn a Midwestern university-based sample, both younger\n(students) and older (faculty, staff, and administration) par-\nticipants expressed neutral rather than positive attitudes\nAusten et al. 3\nabout the appropriateness of breastfeeding in public loca-\ntions (Vari et al., 2013). Taken together, existing survey and\nfocus group results indicate that young adults tend to disap-\nprove of public breastfeeding even though they report being\nsupportive of breastfeeding and are knowledgeable about\nthe benefits of breastfeeding (Forrester et al., 1997;\nOne of the few studies to look at how young adults react\nto viewing a photograph of a breastfeeding mother was a\nstudy published by Acker (2009). In this study, a large sam-\nple of university students and older adults were presented\nwith a set of nine photographs and had to answer six ques-\ntions about the individual in the photo. The key manipula-\ntion was that one of the photographs depicted a mother\nbreastfeeding her infant; half of the participants viewed a\npicture of a mother breastfeeding in private, while the\nremaining participants saw a picture of a mother breast-\nfeeding in public. Evaluations were significantly more pos-\nitive for the mother who breastfed in private than in public,\nwhich suggest more negative attitudes about the latter\nbreastfeeding scenario. This interpretation is certainly con-\nsistent with the survey data reviewed above. Since there\nwas no bottle-feeding photograph comparison, however, it\nis difficult to know how reactions to seeing a picture of a\nbreastfeeding mother compare to those of seeing a bottle-\nfeeding mother.\nFairbrother and Stanger-Ross (2010) at least partially\naddressed this issue in a study comparing female university\nstudents' reactions to pictures of breastfeeding versus bottle-\nfeeding by having the participants evaluate an infant-feeding\npicture as part of a larger study. Half of the participants\nviewed a picture of a woman breastfeeding her infant while\nthe other half viewed a picture of the same woman bottle-\nfeeding her infant. Participants were given a list of positive-\nvalence and negative-valence adjectives with which to rate\nthe picture. Participants who viewed the breastfeeding pic-\nture assigned higher ratings on the positive-valence adjec-\ntives than those who viewed the bottle-feeding picture. They\nalso, however, reported less positive attitudes toward public\nbreastfeeding than public formula feeding, suggesting limi-\ntations to their support for breastfeeding.\nMore recently, Vieth et al. (2015) tested the effective-\nness of viewing a breastfeeding poster campaign to\nimprove comfort levels with breastfeeding. They recruited\na convenience sample of participants from a local shop-\nping mall in two rural communities in Newfoundland\nand Labrador, a region with low breastfeeding rates.\nParticipants completed a short survey to assess their com-\nfort levels with breastfeeding in public venues, and to\nassess awareness of the campaign. Participants who\nreported not being aware of the campaign were then shown\nthe breastfeeding posters2 and asked to study them for a\nbrief time period. These participants then completed a\nfollow-up survey to assess whether viewing the posters\nchanged their reported comfort levels. The researchers\nreported a small improvement in comfort level after seeing\nthe posters. Although this is promising data, the interven-\ntion was brief and may have encouraged a change in\nresponse by asking participants to immediately reassess\ntheir comfort levels after viewing the posters. Additionally,\nthe study did not focus specifically on young adults, who\nmade up only a small proportion of the participants.\nThe present research\nGiven the limited number of studies that directly assess how\nyoung adults react to seeing breastfeeding, many questions\nremain unanswered. First, since participants in these studies\nwere not asked how they think others would respond to see-\ning breastfeeding, it is not easy to assess their perception of\nthe subjective norms around breastfeeding; this will be the\nfocus of Study 1. Second, the studies look at minor manipu-\nlations of a single photo or poster rather than reactions to a\nrange of breastfeeding and bottle-feeding photos, so there is\na limit to the conclusions that can be drawn from these stud-\nies. Finally, although it is important to assess explicit reac-\ntions to breastfeeding and breastfeeding pictures (e.g. survey\nresponses), the outcome of this type of assessment may be\ninfluenced by a social desirability bias, that is, a bias to\nrespond in a socially acceptable way (Van de Mortel, 2008).\nThus, it is equally important to assess reactions to both\nbreastfeeding and bottle-feeding pictures using implicit\nmeasures such as memory tests and eye movements. Both of\nthese latter two questions will be addressed using different\nmethodologies in Study 2 (implicit measures of eye move-\nments, memory tests) and Study 3 (explicit reaction to a\nrange of infant-feeding pictures). Thus, the aim of all three\nstudies reported here is to assess young adults' reactions to\nseeing images of breastfeeding.\nIn Study 1, we first assessed the breastfeeding intentions of\na sample of young adults attending university in\nNortheastern Nova Scotia, a region of the province where\nbreastfeeding rates are low (e.g. Brown et al., 2013). In this\nstudy, we also assessed participants' reactions to a former\nprovincial breastfeeding poster campaign. Doing so\nallowed us to establish a clear picture of the perception of\nsocial norms around breastfeeding.\nMethods\nRecruitment approach and measures. All undergraduate stu-\ndents who were enrolled in an Introductory Psychology\ncourse (approximately 750 students) at the researchers'\ninstitution were invited to complete a large paper and pen-\ncil survey package during class time. Participation was\n4 Health Psychology Open \nvoluntary. Participants received partial course credit for\ncompleting the surveys. This larger survey package\nincluded a survey of basic demographic information and\nthe two key survey measures of interest. The first key\nmeasure was a forced-choice measure of breastfeeding\nintentions that required participants to indicate whether\nthey wanted their own child to be breastfed. The other\nmeasure involved showing participants a single image of a\nformer breastfeeding promotion poster series used in Nova\nScotia. The size of the image made it possible for partici-\npants to clearly see the breastfeeding images used, as well\nas the title of the poster series \"Nova Scotia promotes, pro-\ntects, and supports breastfeeding!,\" although the remainder\nof the poster text was not legible. Participants were asked to\nprovide a written response to this poster campaign to indi-\ncate how they anticipated others would react to seeing the\nposters.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria. The initial inclusion criterion\nused was that participants had to be enrolled in Introduc-\ntory Psychology and to be present in class on the day that\nthe larger survey package was distributed. A total of 612\nundergraduate Psychology students (463 females) com-\npleted the larger survey package in exchange for partial\ncourse credit. Ages of participants ranged from 17 to\nSince the focus of this study was on young adults, and the\nmajority (98%) of participants were between the ages of 17\nyears, responses from participants outside of this\nage range were excluded from the analysis.\nthe criteria for inclusion. The majority of participants\n(84.8%) were in their first year of university, and over half\nof them originated from Nova Scotia (58.8%). Ethnicity was\nnot particularly diverse; 63.1\npercent of the sample was\nEuro-Canadian, 1.9percent African-Canadian, 1.2percent\nAboriginal, .5\npercent selected\n\"Other,\"3 while .3percent did not provide a response.\nProcedure.Psychology course instructors informed poten-\ntial participants in advance that they would have the oppor-\ntunity to complete a package of surveys from various\nresearchers within the Psychology Department and that the\nsurvey packages would be completed during a specified\nclass period early in the academic year. Upper-level psy-\nchology students assisted with the distribution of the sur-\nveys in class and also collected the surveys as participants\nreturned them. Course instructors were not in the classroom\nwhen the surveys were being completed.As noted above, in\naddition to basic demographic information, participants\ncompleted the two measures of interest for this particular\nstudy. The Breastfeeding Intentions question asked \"Would\nyou want your own child to be breastfed?\" Participants\ncould select either a \"yes\" or \"no\" response to this question.\nThe Breastfeeding Social Norms questionnaire involved\nshowing participants a single image of a former breastfeed-\ning promotion poster series used in the province. The par-\nticipants were given a brief preamble about the purpose of\nthe poster campaign (i.e. to promote breastfeeding) and\nthen they were asked the following open-ended key ques-\ntion: \"How do you think people will react to these posters?\"\nParticipants were given space on the survey to record their\nresponse.\nResults and discussion\nIn response to the Breastfeeding Intentions question,\npercent of respondents indicated that \"yes\" they\nwould want their own child to be breastfed, while only\npercent said \"no,\" and 2.7\npercent did not provide a\nresponse. Thus, intentions to breastfeed reported within\nthis group were very high. This measure, taken on its own,\nsuggests that messages around breastfeeding promotion\nmust be reaching this sample on some level. Furthermore,\nit indicates that attitudes toward breastfeeding must be\ngenerally positive since the majority of respondents plan to\nbreastfeed. These findings are promising, given that breast-\nfeeding intentions predict behavior (e.g. Donnan et al.,\never, do not guarantee initiation or continued breastfeeding\nfollowing initiation. One's perception of social norms\naround breastfeeding and the perceived social acceptabil-\nity of breastfeeding, among other factors, also play a role\nWith respect to the Breastfeeding Social Norms ques-\ntionnaire, which assessed anticipation of the reaction that\nmembers of the general public would have to the provincial\npants did not provide any response to this question. It is\ndifficult to interpret what this non-response means. It may\nbe that these participants did not feel that the questionnaire\nwas relevant to them because it depicted breastfeeding, or it\ncould be that they were uncomfortable seeing the breast-\nfeeding image and chose to skip this particular survey. A\ncontent analysis was conducted on the remaining 500 par-\nticipant responses. Because the goal of this study was to\ncapture how participants' felt others would react to seeing\nthe breastfeeding poster campaign, two different raters\nindependently coded the overall valence of each response;\nresponses were coded as being generally positive, negative\nor mixed. By coding responses, it was possible to assess the\nperceived social norms around breastfeeding among this\ngroup of participants. Cohen's k was computed to assess the\nlevel of agreement in the categorization of responses across\nthe two raters. Agreement between the raters was almost\n<\nraters typically involved use of the \"negative\" versus\n\"mixed\" categories. After independently rating participant\nresponses, the reviewers met to discuss and resolve any\nAusten et al. 5\ndiscrepancies in their ratings. The means reported below\nare based on these adjusted ratings.\nPositive comments were those where the participant\nclearly anticipated a positive response to the poster cam-\npaign or general acceptance of the campaign. For example,\none participant said, \"I think people will react normally to\nthese posters because breastfeeding is important to new-\nborn babies and is natural among pregnant/new mothers.\"\nLikewise, another participant said, \"I don't think people\n[will] mind these posters, it's a part of life.\" Negative com-\nments were those where participants clearly anticipated a\nnegative public response to the poster, or a response of dis-\napproval. One participant said, \"Not well, people are going\nto think they are obscene and inappropriate,\" while another\nparticipant wrote,\nI think people will write nasty words like \"slut or tramp\" on the\nposter and will not take the idea the poster is trying to portray\nseriously, because the girl breastfeeding her child looks very\nyoung--like 15! Also, boys are immature and if they see a\nyoung woman (or an old woman) with her breast almost fully\nexposed, they will take the poster the wrong way and only\nfocus on the body part not the message. People will react to\nthese posters but not in the way they want them to react.\nMixed responses were those that indicated either that\nsome people would react positively, while others would\nreact negatively, or responses that indicated that people\nwould respond positively to one aspect of the campaign\n(e.g. breastfeeding promotion), but not to other aspects\n(e.g. breast exposure). One participant remarked, \"Some\npeople may take offense to the posters, especially if they\ncan't breastfeed, but mothers who have, they will be very\nsupportive of the campaign.\" Another participant wrote, \"I\nthink for the most part they will be accepted, but some peo-\nple will find faults, like too much boob or if the moms look\nyoung, they will say teen pregnancy is encouraged.\"\nOf the 500 responses provided, the majority of responses\nmore than twice as many responses were categorized as\nbeing negative (n\n=\n(n\n=\n58; 11.6%). To gain further insight into these ratings,\nwe assessed how often the sight of the breast (i.e. breast\nexposure) was provided as a reason for the anticipated neg-\native or mixed response. Interestingly, breast exposure was\nfrequently cited (i.e. cited within 248 or 56.1% of the nega-\ntive and mixed comments) as being one reason for the neg-\native response to the campaign.\nThe results from this study paint an interesting picture.\nFirst, the majority of respondents indicated that they want\ntheir future child(ren) to be breastfed, which suggests that\nbreastfeeding intentions are high. When asked how the\npublic would respond to seeing a breastfeeding poster cam-\npaign that depicted breastfeeding, however, the majority of\nrespondents anticipated a negative or mixed response to the\ncampaign. This indicates that there is still a perception of\nnegative social norms around breastfeeding. Perceptions\nsuch as these pose a potential barrier for any increase in\nbreastfeeding duration rates. Considering that almost half\nof the negative or mixed comments included a reference to\nbreast exposure, this strongly suggests that breastfeeding in\npublic is perceived as an issue and furthermore that hyper-\nsexualization of the breast might be the underlying reason\nAnticipated discomfort seeing breastfeeding is a barrier\nthat needs to be addressed in future efforts to promote\nbreastfeeding. Given that, within the media, breastfeeding\nis often represented as being problematic relative to bottle-\nshould be made to ensure that positive examples of breast-\nfeeding are prominent in the media, and that the public has\nample opportunity to be exposed to breastfeeding (e.g. pro-\nmote breastfeeding friendly spaces to encourage breast-\nfeeding anytime and anywhere).\nIn this study, young adults were asked how they thought\nothers would respond to seeing the breastfeeding promo-\ntion poster; the response clearly indicated the anticipation\nof a negative reaction from others. If young adults were\nasked how they would react to seeing the poster themselves,\nhowever, the response is likely to be more positive, but it\nwould be difficult to tease apart whether they actually felt\ncomfortable viewing the breastfeeding poster or whether\nthey were responding in a socially desirable way. One way\naround this issue is to use an alternate measure of response\nto the poster. That is, rather than ask participants to describe\nhow they would react to seeing the poster, it is possible to\nuse a less conscious and controllable measure to assess\nreaction, in this case, looking behavior and reaction time.\nIt is possible that a negative perception of social norms\naround breastfeeding, and limited opportunities to see\nbreastfeeding, could impact how young adults look at and\nprocess any poster aimed at promoting breastfeeding. To\nassess reactions to seeing breastfeeding, it would be ideal to\nuse a measure that is minimally susceptible to response\nbias. In Study 2, we used eye-tracking technology to record\nlooking behavior, while participants viewed novel infant-\nfeeding posters designed specifically for this study. The\nposters included an infant-feeding picture paired with a\nbrief feeding-relevant slogan. The posters were presented\nin random order to participants. Measuring eye movements\nprovided an implicit measure on which to compare how\nyoung adults view breastfeeding versus bottle-feeding; dif-\nferences in looking times could be compared across the two\npicture types. Based on past eye movement research (e.g.\nknown about anticipated reactions to seeing breastfeeding\n6 Health Psychology Open \nBabineau, 2011), it was predicted that looking times would\nbe shorter for breastfeeding posters than for bottle-feeding\nposters since the former would be more likely to elicit\ndiscomfort.4\nParticipants were assigned to complete one of three\ntimed categorization tasks designed to focus attention on\nthe infant-feeding picture, the slogan, or both. Using dif-\nferent types of tasks helped to vary the degree to which\nparticipants were required to focus on the breastfeeding\nand bottle-feeding images. We predicted that participants\nwould be faster to complete categorization tasks that\nrequired them to look at the image versus the slogan, and\nfaster when the poster they were looking at included a\nbreastfeeding image. Following the categorization task,\nparticipants were given a surprise slogan recall and recog-\nnition task to assess memory for the slogans. The unex-\npected memory test allowed us to determine whether the\nability to recall or recognize written information that was\npaired with the image depended on the type of image\nviewed. We predicted that recall and recognition of the\nslogans would be worse for slogans that were paired with\nbreastfeeding images.\nMethod\nRecruitment approach.\nUpper-level psychology student\nresearcher and second author (J.D.) visited the classrooms\nof Introductory Psychology courses at the researchers'\ninstitution to recruit potential participants for this study.\nAfter providing each class with a short verbal description\nof the research project and what it entailed as a participant,\na sign-up sheet was circulated around the classroom for\ninterested participants.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria.All students enrolled in\nIntroductory Psychology were eligible to participate in this\nmen) visited the lab to participate in the study. Since the\nmain aim of this study was to determine whether there are\ndifferences in how young adults view breastfeeding versus\nbottle-feeding posters, and whether the type of poster\nviewed can influence memory for the accompanying slo-\ngans, it was critical to have looking data for each partici-\npant. Thus, participants were excluded from the study if eye\nmovement data could not be collected, and/or if there was\nan issue with the categorization data (e.g. not following\ntask instructions). Using these exclusion criteria, 27 partici-\npants were excluded from the analysis; this was due to\nunexpected technical issues (n\n=\n1), confusion with task\ninstructions (n\n=\n3), and incomplete or insufficient eye\nParticipants.In total, data were analyzed from 72 partici-\ncategorization task (12 participants for each possible\nresponse mapping). Participants received partial course\ncredit for their participation.\nProcedure. Participants were randomly assigned to complete\none of three timed categorization tasks involving infant-\nfeeding posters presented on an eye-tracker. Posters con-\nsisted of a breastfeeding or bottle-feeding image paired with\na slogan. The same posters were used for each task. In the\nPicture Assessment task, participants decided whether the\npicture depicted breastfeeding or bottle-feeding. In the Slo-\ngan Assessment task, participants decided whether the tone\nof the slogan was positive or negative. And, in the Slogan-\nPicture Appropriateness task, participants decided whether\nthe slogan was appropriate for the picture with which it was\npaired. As soon as participants made a decision, they\nresponded by pressing one of two assigned computer keys.\nResponse times (RTs) were recorded for each task, as well\nas looking time (as assessed through dwell times using the\neye-tracking equipment) within two defined poster areas, in\nthis case, the slogan versus the picture. Following the com-\npletion of the categorization task, participants were asked to\ncomplete two memory tests: slogan recall and slogan recog-\nnition. Since participants were not told about these memory\ntests at the outset of the study, the tests were unexpected,\nand served as a way to assess passive intake of the slogans.\nAccuracy for the memory tasks was recorded.\nParticipants were seated approximately 60\ncm from a\nTobii Eye-Tracking Device XL (60\nHz sample rate), on\nwhich the infant-feeding posters were presented. Posters\nms (observation\nperiod)andremainedondisplayuntilparticipantsresponded.6\nOf the 40 posters, half included breastfeeding images and the\nother half included bottle-feeding images. Images were\nselected from those available on the Internet via search\nengines, using the criteria that the breastfeeding and bottle-\nfeeding images were comparable to one another, the images\ncould be resized to one of two common sizes without distor-\ntion, and that the racial diversity of moms and babies por-\ntrayed in the images roughly matched the diversity of our\npotential sample. All of these criteria helped to maximize the\ngeneralizability of the results of this study. Of the 20 breast-\nfeeding images selected, seven showed a close-up of the\nbaby on the breast with the mother being only partially visi-\nble, while the remaining images showed both the mother and\nbaby in complete view. In 10 of the 20 breastfeeding images,\nthe mother's breast was partially visible. Of the 20 bottle-\nfeeding images selected, seven showed a close-up of the\nbaby being bottle-fed with the view of the mother obscured,\nwhile the remaining images showed both the mother and\nbaby in complete view. Some images naturally had a more\nhorizontal orientation (measuring 15.1\u00d78.6degrees of visual\nangle) than others (measuring 11.6\n\u00d7\ndegrees of visual\nangle). Below each image was a slogan typed in white Times\nNew Roman font and presented on a black background. A\nAusten et al. 7\ntotal of 20 unique slogans were used, where each slogan was\npaired with two different infant-feeding images (either two\ndifferent breastfeeding images or two different bottle-feed-\ning images). Some slogans were positively framed (e.g. Off\nto the best start, Healthy eating for a healthy mind), while\nothers were negatively framed (e.g. Reduce the risks, Proper\nfeeding reduces illness). Slogans were positioned approxi-\ndegrees of visual angle below the image, and\nranged from three to six words in length.\nBefore the experiment began, participants underwent an\neye movement calibration to ensure that the device was able\nto detect the participant's eyes and track them as they\nmoved. Successful calibration was followed by the\nCategorization Task, which involved the presentation of the\ninfant-feeding posters in random order. Response mappings\nfor each of the categorization tasks were counterbalanced\nacross participants. For example, half of the participants in\nthe Picture Assessment task used one response mapping (\"z\"\nfor breastfeeding pictures, \"/\" for bottle-feeding pictures)\nwhile the other half used the opposite response mapping.\nAfter viewing all 40 picture-slogan pairs and making\nforced-choice decisions regarding each pair, the partici-\npants were presented with a surprise Slogan Recall Task,\nwhich required them to use the keyboard to type as many\nslogans as they could recall. Following the completion of\nthis task, participants were then presented with a surprise\nSlogan Recognition Task. In this task, old and new slogans\nwere presented one at a time and participants were asked to\ndecide whether the slogan was previously presented in the\nCategorization Task (i.e. old) or whether it was never\nshown before (i.e. new). Responses were made by pressing\none of two computer keys (e.g. \"z\" for old or \"/\" for new).\nAccuracy for both memory tasks was recorded.\nResults and discussion\nCategorization RTs (in ms).Categorization RT data were\nsubjected to analyses of variance (ANOVAs) using the\nwithin-subjects factors of Picture Type (Breast or Bottle),\nbetween-subjects factors of Categorization Task (Picture\nAssessment, Slogan Assessment, and Slogan-Picture\nAppropriateness), and Response Mapping (A or B).

The percentage of slogans that were\nrecalled did not significantly differ based on whether a\nwas present; in other words, there was no main effect of\nPicture Type, F<1; see Figure 5. Slogan recall was simi-\nlarly low across both poster types. The reasons for this\nare not yet clear and will require further study, but would\nbe expected to improve if participants were given advance\nnotice of the memory test. Slogan recall, however, did\nvary across task (i.e. significant main effect of Task\nlower (p's\n<\n.01) in the Picture Assessment task (7.6%)\nthan in either the Slogan Assessment task (19.0%) or the\nSlogan-Picture Appropriateness task (17.5%), which\nwere statistically similar. This finding likely reflects the\nfact that the slogan was not relevant for the completion of\nthe Picture Assessment task, but was relevant to the other\ntwo tasks. No other main effects or interactions reached\nsignificance.\nAusten et al. 9\nSlogan recognition (%).Slogan recognition data (% cor-\nrect) were subjected to ANOVAs using the within-\nsubjects factors of Picture Pairing (Breast, Bottle, or\nNone), between-subjects factors of Categorization Task\n(Picture Assessment, Slogan Assessment, and Slogan-\nPicture Appropriateness), and Response Mapping (A or\nB). Overall, accuracy on the slogan recognition test was\nsimilar whether the slogan was new (82.3%), that is, not\npreviously paired with a picture, or paired with a breast-\nfeeding picture (83.8%), or bottle-feeding picture\ntrast to the hypothesized outcomes.

No main effects or other\ninteractions reached significance.\nTask assessment measures (%).Because each Categoriza-\ntion Task involved a different measure (% correct for the\nPicture Assessment task, percent positive for the Slogan\nAssessment task, and percent appropriate for the Slogan-\nPicture Assessment task), measures were analyzed sepa-\nrately. Each analysis involved an ANOVA using the\nwithin-subjects factor of Picture Type (Breast, Bottle),\nbetween-subjects factors of Categorization Task (Picture\nAssessment, Slogan Assessment, Slogan-Picture Appropri-\nateness), and Response Mapping (A or B):\nPicture Assessment Task. Participants in this task were\nequally accurate at categorizing breastfeeding pictures\n(99% correct) and bottle-feeding pictures (98%\nsignificant.\nSlogan Assessment Task.

More of the slo-\ngans that were paired with breastfeeding pictures were\ncategorized as appropriate (80% appropriate) compared\nto the slogans paired with bottle-feeding pictures (44%\n<\n.01. No other effects\nwere significant.\nThe results from this study suggest that regardless of the\ntask, participants were faster to make their categorization\ndecisions in the presence of a breastfeeding image versus a\nbottle-feeding image. This was the case even when the\nimage was irrelevant to the task, as in the SloganAssessment\nTask. Additionally, participants tended to look at the breast-\nfeeding images for a significantly shorter period of time\nthan the bottle-feeding images. Taken together, these results\nsuggest that participants reacted differently to breastfeeding\nand bottle-feeding images. One possible interpretation for\nthese differences in looking times is that participants may\nhave experienced discomfort when looking at the breast-\nfeeding images. This interpretation is entirely consistent\nwith the results from existing survey and focus group data\nsuggesting that individuals are embarrassed to see breast-\nfeeding, particularly in a public setting (Forrester et al.,\n2007). This interpretation also aligns with the results from\nStudy 1, where the majority of participants expected others\nto have a negative or mixed reaction to a breastfeeding\nposter campaign that depicted breastfeeding. It is entirely\npossible that young adults not only expect others to be\nuncomfortable to see breastfeeding but also experience dis-\ncomfort when exposed to breastfeeding images. Given that\npeople tend to have more experience with seeing bottle-\nfeeding than seeing breastfeeding, it would make sense that\nthey are less comfortable seeing the latter. This again points\nto the importance of exposure.\nIt was interesting that this quantitatively different\nresponse to breastfeeding versus bottle-feeding images did\nnot lead to poorer recall and recognition of the slogans\npaired with the breastfeeding images. Slogan recall and\nrecognition varied across tasks (i.e. lowest overall in the\nPicture Assessment Task), but did not depend on image\npairing (i.e. breastfeeding versus bottle-feeding). This find-\ning is good news for the promotion of breastfeeding; it sug-\ngests that even if people tend to minimize how long they\nlook at breastfeeding posters (whether because of discom-\nfort, or not), this decreased looking time is likely to have\nFigure 6.

Even though this\nstudy provides clear evidence that people made faster deci-\nsions about breastfeeding versus bottle-feeding posters, and\nthat they looked at breastfeeding pictures for shorter dura-\ntions, it remains to be seen whether these findings can be\nattributed to discomfort.\nIn Study 3, we wanted to determine whether discomfort\nviewing breastfeeding images could account for the\nshorter viewing times of the breastfeeding versus bottle-\nfeeding posters in Study 2. We recruited a new group of\nparticipants for this study for three main reasons. One,\nexposure to breastfeeding images has the potential to pos-\nitively influence how comfortable one is to see breast-\nfeeding, so we wanted a group of participants who would\nsee these images for the first time, just like the original\nparticipants in Study 2. If we tested the same group of\nparticipants, the pictures would have been familiar and\nmay not elicit the same level of discomfort the second\ntime around. Two, although the breastfeeding and bottle-\nfeeding pictures used in Study 2 were comparable, they\nwere selected from those available on the Internet, which\nmeant that there were inevitable variations in the photos\nfrom the two sets. Thus, it would be helpful to know\nwhether this same photo set elicits discomfort in a new\ngroup of participants. Three, by testing a new group of\nparticipants, it was possible to assess discomfort within a\nlarger sample of participants, which would ensure greater\ngeneralizability of the results. We predicted that partici-\npants would be significantly more uncomfortable viewing\nbreastfeeding images.\nMethod\nRecruitment approach.Undergraduate students enrolled in\nIntroductory Psychology classes at the researchers' institu-\ntion were invited, by email and/or through short in-class\npresentations, to participate in a large online survey pack-\nage. Participation was voluntary and surveys were com-\npleted outside of class time.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria. To be included in the study,\nstudents had to be enrolled in Introductory Psychology, and\nthey had to complete the large online survey package. A\ntotal of 440 undergraduate psychology students partici-\npated and received partial course credit. Participants were\nexcluded from this study if they did not complete the sur-\nvey of interest, the Picture Rating survey; six participants\nwere excluded for this reason. Again, since the focus of the\nstudy was on young adults, we limited our analysis to those\nyears; this criterion excluded an\nadditional four participants.\nfemales, 92 males, and 2 undisclosed) who were included\nin this study. The average age of participants was 18years\nold. The majority (87.9%) of students were in their first\nyear of university. Within the sample, 87\npercent were\nEuro-Canadian, .9percent African-Canadian, .9percent\nAsian, .5percentAboriginal, and 7percent selected \"Other.\"\nProcedure. The introductory text included with the Picture\nRating survey informed participants that they would be\nlooking at images that depicted infant feeding and that\nwere being considered for use in educational materials.\nThey were asked to indicate how comfortable they felt\nviewing each image. Comfort ratings were made using a\n7-point Likert scale (1\n=\nvery uncomfortable and 7\n=\nvery\ntle-feeding) used in Study 2 were presented in random\norder to each participant. Ratings for each image were\nrecorded electronically. In order to compare ratings for\nbreastfeeding images where the mother's breast was par-\ntially visible to those where the breast was not visible, rat-\nings were averaged across the 10 pictures in these two\nsubgroups. To compare ratings of breastfeeding and bottle-\nfeeding images, ratings were averaged across all 20 pic-\ntures within each picture type to provide an average\nbreastfeeding comfort rating and an average bottle-feeding\ncomfort rating for each participant.\nResults and discussion\nTo confirm that there was internal consistency across rat-\nings for the 20 breastfeeding images and across ratings for\nthe 20 bottle-feeding images, a reliability analysis was con-\nducted for each image set. Cronbach's alpha for comfort\nlevel ratings of breastfeeding images was .98, suggesting\nhigh internal consistency. Similarly, Cronbach's alpha for\nratings of bottle-feeding images was also .98, which sug-\ngests high internal consistency for that image set as well.\nAverage comfort ratings were computed for each picture in\nthe two picture sets. Average comfort ratings for each of the\n20 breastfeeding images ranged from a low of 3.60 to a\nhigh of 5.89. Average comfort ratings for each of the 20\nbottle-feeding images ranged from a low of 5.95 to a high\nof 6.49. It is interesting to note that the average comfort\nratings at the top range for breastfeeding images was lower\nthan the average ratings at the bottom range for bottle-feed-\ning images. Given these differences in the range of comfort\nratings, it is obvious that participants were uncomfortable\nviewing the breastfeeding images and that they responded\nvery differently to these images than they did to the bottle-\nfeeding images.\nA dependent samples t-test was conducted to compare\naverage comfort ratings for breastfeeding versus bottle-\nfeeding pictures. Participants rated being significantly less\ncomfortable looking at breastfeeding pictures (4.90) than\nThis finding is consistent with \"discomfort\" seeing breast-\nfeeding images as a possible explanation for the shorter\nlooking times for breastfeeding versus bottle-feeding post-\ners in Study 2.\nA dependent samples t-test was also conducted to com-\npare average comfort ratings for the 10 breastfeeding images\nwhere the mother's breast was partially exposed to the 10\nimages where the breast was not exposed. Ratings were sig-\nnificantly lower when the mother's breast was visible (4.26)\np<.001. This difference in ratings indicates that participants\nare significantly less comfortable viewing breastfeeding\nimages where the mother's breast is visible than where the\nbreast is concealed in some way. Again, these results are\nalso consistent with the \"discomfort\" hypothesis that was\nproposed as an explanation for the shorter looking times on\nbreastfeeding posters compared to bottle-feeding posters in\nStudy 2. These findings are also consistent with the existing\nliterature suggesting people tend to be uncomfortable seeing\na woman breastfeeding her baby (e.g. Meng et al., 2013;\nStewart-Knox et al., 2003) and believe that mothers should\ncover up and be discreet if they are to breastfeed in public\nGeneral discussion\nThe aim of this research was to assess both implicitly and\nexplicitly how young adults react to seeing breastfeeding.\nIn Study 1, participants were asked to look at a breastfeed-\ning promotion poster and indicate how others might react to\nseeing the poster; many participants believed that public\nresponse to seeing breastfeeding is one of discomfort and\ndisgust. This negative perception of the social norms\naround breastfeeding has the potential to keep future breast-\nfeeding rates low. Despite this perception, we found that\nmost young adults intend to breastfeed their child(ren).\nAlthough the intent to breastfeed is high in this sample of\nyoung adults, and is promising for breastfeeding in the\nfuture, social norms could negatively impact the duration\nof breastfeeding. One way to improve the perception of\nsocial norms is through positive exposure to breastfeeding\nand breastfeeding images (e.g. Giles et al., 2014). For\nexample, it is now well established that previous exposure\nto breastfeeding is linked to positive attitudes about breast-\nfeeding and one's intent to breastfeed (Greene et al., 2003;\nDodgson, 2007). Increased opportunity for exposure to\nbreastfeeding is particularly important in geographic areas\nwhere it is still relatively uncommon to see breastfeeding.\nOne relatively easy way to increase exposure to breast-\nfeeding in geographic regions where breastfeeding rates are\nlow is through poster campaigns where breastfeeding images\nare visible on the posters. We asked in Study 2 how young\nadults would react to seeing breastfeeding posters and\nwhether the presence of the breastfeeding image would\nimpact their memory for the accompanying slogan. We\nfound that when young adults were presented with infant-\nfeeding posters, they looked at the breastfeeding posters for\nsignificantly less time than the bottle-feeding posters, regard-\nless of the task that they were assigned. Even though we are\nnot able to say with certainty why this is, we know from the\nrecognition memory test that memory for the slogans used in\nthese posters was comparable across both poster types, sug-\ngesting that shorter looking times on breastfeeding posters\ndid not jeopardize intake of the accompanying message.\nIn Study 3, we explicitly asked participants to rate their\ncomfort level viewing the same breastfeeding and bottle-\nfeeding images used in Study 2. The comfort ratings\nassigned to breastfeeding images were unquestionably\nlower than those assigned to the bottle-feeding images,\nindicating that participants experienced discomfort when\nseeing breastfeeding. Based on these results, it seems likely\nthat the shorter looking times for breastfeeding posters in\nStudy 2 also reflect discomfort, especially since looking\ntimes were short across all tasks.\nUsing breastfeeding images to promote breastfeeding\nmight help to normalize images of the functional or nurtur-\ning breast, and in the long run, could both reduce the embar-\nrassment of seeing breastfeeding and the embarrassment of\nbeing the one to breastfeed in public. This is important\ngiven evidence suggesting that intent to breastfeed and sub-\nsequent breastfeeding behavior is lower for women who\nexpress embarrassment about breastfeeding (Bonia et al.,\nbreastfeed in public\" was cited as being an important rea-\nson for discontinuing breastfeeding in a large survey sam-\nple of US mothers (Li et al., 2008). Breastfeeding initiation\nis higher among women exposed to breastfeeding through\ntelevision or video compared to those with no exposure to\nbreastfeeding (e.g. Hoddinott et al., 2010). Thus, showing\npositive images of breastfeeding in various contexts, such\nas poster campaigns, may be one way of increasing expo-\nsure and improving comfort level and attitudes over time.\nLimitations\nThis research provides some promising, albeit preliminary,\ndata to suggest that using breastfeeding images to promote\nbreastfeeding can be done without jeopardizing the intake\nof the accompanying message, even if the viewer might be\nuncomfortable seeing the breastfeeding images. Future\nresearch can confirm that individuals who self identify as\nbeing uncomfortable seeing breastfeeding images still pro-\ncess any written messages that accompany those images.\nIt was somewhat surprising that slogan recall was low\noverall for both poster types. It is possible that since the\nposters were randomly presented such that breastfeeding\nposters were intermixed with bottle-feeding posters, the\n12 Health Psychology Open \npresence of breastfeeding posters impacted how the bottle-\nfeeding posters were processed. Further study is needed to\nsee if this is the case. For example, if presentation of poster\ntypes is blocked, will slogan recall improve for bottle-feed-\ning posters? Another possibility is that since participants\nwere not explicitly asked to remember the slogans (the\nmemory test was a surprise), maybe they only minimally\nprocessed the slogans. This is an interesting possibility that\nhas implications for how posters are processed in general.\nFinally, the slogans varied across posters. This is different\nfrom typical poster campaigns where only a few different\nslogans are used. Perhaps the slogans would have been\nmore memorable and recalled more easily if there were\nfewer slogans, and if the same slogans were used consist-\nently across posters. These are all possibilities to be\nexplored in future research. Future research is also needed\nto confirm whether the results of this study extend to slo-\ngans that are longer in length, and slogans that tend to be\nmore novel (less catchy) or that seem less familiar.\nConclusion\nDespite high intentions to breastfeed, our sample of young\nadults reported mixed or negative perceptions of public\nreaction to seeing breastfeeding images. This discrepancy\nis concerning for two reasons. One, although young adults\nmay see the value in breastfeeding and may want to breast-\nfeed, uncertainty in how others will react may hamper this\nbehavior. Two, these results suggest that young adults are\nstill getting mixed messages about breastfeeding; breast-\nfeeding is something to be done but not something to be\nseen. Positive exposure to breastfeeding could help ensure\nthat the messaging around breastfeeding is more uniform\nand consistent. This research should alleviate concerns\nthat using breastfeeding images to promote breastfeeding\nmight come at a cost to message processing. Our results\nsuggest that even if viewing time is limited, it is still pos-\nsible to take in the messaging paired with breastfeeding\nimages. We know from past research that exposure to\nbreastfeeding is linked to intent to breastfeed and positive\nattitudes toward breastfeeding (Hoddinott et al., 2010;\nTarrant and Dodgson, 2007), so using breastfeeding images\nwithin promotional campaigns will likely be far more ben-\neficial than it is risky. Not only should increased exposure\nto breastfeeding improve overall comfort levels, but it may\nalso help to narrow the gap that is growing between the\nacceptability of bottle-feeding in public and the accepta-\nbility of breastfeeding in public.\n"
