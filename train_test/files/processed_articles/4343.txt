A\nprospective study of the risk of thrombosis\nin outpatients undergoing chemotherapy\npresented a simple assessment scale for\nrisk of thrombosis, but investigated central\nvenous catheters and subjects of multiple\nethnicities.9 Body mass index (BMI)\n>35 kg/m2 was identified as a thrombotic\nrisk factor,9 but this BMI is rare in Asian\npopulations (including Chinese, Indian,\nJapanese and Korean subjects).10 The aim\nof the present prospective study, therefore,\nwas to determine thrombotic risk factors in\nChinese patients undergoing chemotherapy\nvia PICC.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study prospectively recruited all con-\nsecutive patients undergoing PICC chemo-\ntherapy in the Department of Surgical\nOncology, Second Affiliated Hospital of\nZhejiang University, Hangzhou, China,\nThe study was approved by the Institutional\nEthics Committee of Second Affiliated\nHospital of Zhejiang University. All patients\nprovided written informed consent prior to\nenrolment.\nAssessment scales\nPatients were evaluated using six thrombotic\nrisk assessment scales prior to PICC:\nchemotherapy-associated venous thrombo-\nembolism (VTE);9 Davidson\u00adCaprini Risk-\nData including age, sex, BMI, disease cat-\negory, haemoglobin (Hb) level, platelet\ncount, white blood cell (WBC) count, fasting\nblood sugar, medical history (including\nthrombus, other relevant diseases, smoking,\ndiarrhoea17 and family history of thrombus)\nwere collected from each patient.\nAssessments also included the condition of\nthe general venous system (varicose veins or\nvenous pain) and sites of catheterized vein\nand catheterized limb. DVT was diagnosed\nby colour Doppler ultrasonography (sensi-\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as n (%). Univariate 2\nanalysis was performed, with thrombosis as\nthe dependent variable and various risk\nfactors as independent variables. Logistic\nregression analysis was performed on statis-\ntically significant variables to identify the\nmajor risk factors for thrombosis. All stat-\nistical analyses were performed using SPSS\u00d5\nversion 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)\nfor Windows\u00d5, with P-value <0.05 con-\nsidered as being statistically significant.\nResults\nThe study included 188 consecutive patients\n6.38%), and was located in the subclavian,\njugular, axillary, or upper limb vein of the\ncatheterized side in 10/12 patients, and the\nfemoral vein in two of 12 patients.\nThrombosis occurred within 2 weeks of\nwithin 1 month of PICC in two of 12\nboses (75.0%) occurred before the end of the\nsecond course of chemotherapy.\nDemographic and clinical characteristics\nof the patient population, stratified accord-\ning to the presence or absence of venous\nthrombosis, are given in Table 1. There were\nstatistically significant associations between\nvenous thrombosis and age >60 years,\nmale sex, BMI >25 kg/m2, breast cancer,\nHb <100 g/l or use of red blood-cell growth\ntension, history of smoking and left upper\nlimb catheterization (P < 0.05 for each com-\nparison, Table 1). Limb swelling was also\nsignificantly associated with venous throm-\nbosis (P < 0.001), but this was considered a\nsymptom rather than a risk factor.\nLogistic regression analysis (Table 2)\nindicated that age >60 years, BMI > 25 kg/\nfactors for thrombosis in patients undergo-\ning PICC chemotherapy. The incidence of\nthrombosis in patients with one or more of\npatients with two or more risk factors the\nincidence was 55.6% (five of nine patients).\nDiscussion\nThe incidence of venous thrombosis was\n6.38% in the present study of PICC,\napproximately three times that reported in\na study of central venous catheters.9 In\naccordance with the findings of others,14\nthere was a significant correlation between\nthrombosis and age >60 years in the present\nstudy. It is thought that vascular endothelial\ncells produce increasingly high levels of\nprocoagulants (such as von Willebrand\nfactor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-\n1) with advancing age,20 resulting in hyper-\ncoagulation. Changes in gonadotropins also\npredispose elderly people to thrombosis.20\nAge >60 years is a risk factor in the\nrisk assessment scales.15\nWe identified a significant correlation\nbetween thrombosis and BMI > 25 kg/m2.\nBMI values in thrombosis risk assessment\nhigher,21,9 but the highest BMI value in the\npresent study was 27 kg/m2. BMI varies\ngreatly according to ethnic group.10\nObesity is a known risk factor for VTE11,12;\nadipocytokines such as leptin and adiponec-\ntin can enhance the activity of the coagula-\ntion system and decrease fibrinolytic activity\nby interfering with blood fat and sugar\nIn accordance with the findings of\nwas identified as a significant risk factor\nfor thrombosis in the present study. WBC-\nderived tissue factor (TF) has a role in\npathological thrombosis,9,25 and large num-\nbers of TF-containing microparticles can be\ndetected in the blood of patients with severe\ninfection, metastatic cancer or DVT.26,27\nFemale patients are known to have an\nincreased risk of thrombosis,28 and both\nchemotherapy and estrin treatment can\nincrease the risk of thrombosis in patients\nwith breast cancer.29 TF is involved in\nactivity is related to hyperlipidaemia, smok-\ning and platelet count.32 It has been sug-\ngested that hypertension can cause extensive\ndamage to vascular endothelial cells, leading\nto excessive TF release that starts the cas-\ncade reaction of extrinsic coagulation.33\nLogistic regression analysis in the present\nstudy revealed no significant associations\nbetween thrombosis risk and sex, breast\ncancer, history of smoking, platelet count\nor hypertension. Both a personal and a\nfamily history of thrombosis are risk-assess-\nment items in some scales,13,15 but there was\nno significant relationship between throm-\nbosis risk and these parameters in the cur-\nrent study.\nTable 1.

These data\nindicate that thrombosis is often a conse-\nquence of multiple risk factors, but the\nactual number of risk factors is not a specific\npredictor of thrombosis.\nCommon acquired thrombotic risk fac-\ntors include trauma, surgery, malignant\ntumours and the presence of antiphospholi-\npid antibodies.36 These factors are closely\nassociated with venous thrombosis in hyper-\ntension, coronary heart disease, heart fail-\nure, diabetes mellitus, cerebral infarction\nand smoking.37,38 Major genetic risk factors\ninclude mutations in coagulation factor V\ndefects in protein C and protein S.42\nThrombosis is thus a combined consequence\nof acquired and hereditary thrombotic risk\nfactors.\nThe present study included only Chinese\npatients undergoing PICC chemotherapy;\nit is not possible to determine whether\nthe findings are applicable to the wider\npopulation. Although we identified three\nrisk factors for thrombosis in patients\nundergoing PICC chemotherapy, we believe\nthat comprehensive assessment of throm-\nbosis risk is necessary.\nIn conclusion, this study identified age\nin Chinese patients undergoing PICC\nchemotherapy. These patients are already\nat high risk of VTE due to the presence of\nthree major risk factors (tumour, chemo-\ntherapy and PICC). Careful attention\nshould therefore be paid to patients with\none or more risk factors, including thorough\nchecking for signs and symptoms of DVT\nand early symptoms of pulmonary embol-\nism. B-mode ultrasonography and pulmon-\nary angiography should be promptly\nperformed and low-dose or low-molecular-\nweight heparin should be given to prevent\nDVT when indicated.43\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts\nof interest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Education\nDepartment of Zhejiang Province, China\nTechnology Department of Zhejiang Province,\nReferences\n1.
