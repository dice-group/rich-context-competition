It is found in corn and corn-based food products\nconsumed by humans and in animal feeds (Dutton, 1996). Fumonisin B1 is\nhighly toxic to horses (Kellerman et al., 1990) and pigs (Haschek et al., 1992),\nis carcinogenic in rodents (Gelderblom et al., 1992), and may be linked to\nesophageal cancer in humans (Marasas et al., 1988). A 2-year bioassay with\nrats and mice was conducted at the National Center for Toxicological Re-\nsearch under the National Toxicology Program (NTP, 1999) to characterize\nthe risk of toxicity and carcinogenicity from consumption of food containing\nAddress correspondence to Ralph L.

To enable the investigation of toxic mechanisms, the bioassay\nincluded ancillary studies of cell proliferation and apoptosis and of sphin-\ngolipid metabolism in the two target organs, liver and kidney. These ancil-\nlary studies were prompted by the presumed carcinogenic mechanism in\nrodents, that is, the promotion of initiated cells to tumors through continual\ninduction of apoptosis and subsequent cellular regeneration (NTP, 1999).\nThis nongenotoxic mechanism is believed to begin with the interruption of\nsphingolipid synthesis in cells due to the inhibition of ceramide synthase by\nfumonisin B1 (Riley et al., 1998). The resulting increased intracellular levels\nof sphinganine are associated with increased apoptosis (Tolleson et al., 1996;\npensatory proliferation of cells in response to increased apoptosis puts more\ncells at risk of mutation to malignancy, hence increasing the risk of cancer.\nThe nongenotoxic mechanism of carcinogenic action for fumonisin B1\nhas fairly strong support among scientists engaged in assessing the toxicity\nand carcinogenicity of fumonisins (Cohen et al., 2000). For this reason, the\npresent authors and their colleagues previously adopted that mechanism in\ndeveloping a mechanistic mathematical model to predict the risk of liver tu-\nmors in the mice that were exposed through diet to fumonisin B1 in the NTP\ntion document on the safety evaluation of mycotoxins in food (WHO, 2001),\nthe model was able to produce reasonably well the observed tumor rates in\nboth female and male mice, predicting substantially increased rates above\nbackground only in females at the highest doses of fumonisin B1.\nThis paper will briefly review the modeling that was done by Kodell et al.\n(2001) to point out key characteristics of the model's representation of the\nhypothesized nongenotoxic mechanism for liver cancer. The reader will need\nto refer to Kodell et al. (2001) for complete details. The degree to which the\nlow-dose nonlinearity of the model was reflective of the observed lower-than-\nbackground liver tumor proportions at low doses will be discussed in the\ncontext of possible hormesis. The relatively high fumonisin guidance levels\nset by the FDA (2001), which are supported by the low-dose nonlinearity\nof the mechanistic model, will be contrasted with the much lower guidance\nlevels that would have resulted had linear extrapolation been employed to\nderive such exposure levels.\nKey Characteristics of the Model\nKodell et al. (2001) implemented a two-stage, clonal-expansion model\nof liver tumor risk in mice based on the hypothesis that fumonisin B1 causes\ncancer through the disruption of sphingolipid metabolism, which leads to an\nincrease in apoptosis, in response to which cells proliferate to compensate for\nLow-Dose Nonlinearity of Fumonisin B1 Liver Tumor Risk 37\nFIGURE 1 Schema of the two-stage, clonal-expansion model of carcinogenesis implemented by Kodell\net al. (2001) for fumonisin B1 risk prediction: N(t) is the number of normal liver cells at time t,\nN (t) and P(t) are birth rates of normal and preneoplastic cells, N (t) and P(t) are death rates of\nnormal and preneoplastic cells, and \u00b51 and \u00b52 are mutation rates of normal and preneoplastic cells,\nrespectively.\nreduced tissue mass. A schematic diagram of the model is given in Figure 1.\nIt is especially noteworthy that if the assumed apoptotic effect of fumonisin\nB1 was modeled on both normal cells and pre-neoplastic cells (i.e., through\nboth N (t) and P(t) in Figure 1), then inadequate predictions of liver tumor\nrisk were obtained. When the apoptotic effect of fumonisin B1 was assumed\nto act only on the pre-neoplastic cells (i.e., only on P(t) in Figure 1) the pre-\ndictions of tumor risk matched the observed tumor proportions reasonably\nwell. This is consistent with observations using other stimulators of apopto-\nsis in liver (e.g., caloric restriction) that cells with markers for pre-neoplasia\nare more sensitive to the stimulus than are normal cells (Muskhelishvili et al.,\n1996). Hence, it is the differential increase in the number of pre-neoplastic cells at\nrisk of mutation during cell division, due to the increase in P(t) in Figure 1\nto compensate for the increase in P(t), that leads to the predicted increase\nin the incidence of tumors. In Figures 2 and 3, predictions of the 2-year liver\ntumor incidences by the model developed from the aforementioned mecha-\nnistic data are overlaid with the actual 2-year observed incidences (Figure 2:\nfemale mice; Figure 3: male mice). The predictions are in line with the tumor\ndata, indicating no risk for females at low doses and high risk at high doses\n(with a possible hormetic effect), as well as the absence of a dose response\nfor males (with perhaps a hormetic effect there, also).\nIs the Nonlinearity Evidence of Hormesis?\nThe 2-year unadjusted liver tumor proportions (hepatocellular adeno-\nmas and carcinomas combined) observed in females at 0, 5, and 15 ppm\nwas below the 0-ppm rate and the 15-ppm rate was below the 5-ppm rate\nin both sexes suggests the strong possibility of a hormetic effect. The only\nstatistically significant \"reduction\" in tumors below the background rate oc-\ncurred at 15 ppm in females, where a one-sided chi-squared test at the 5%\n38 R. L. Kodell and A. Turturro\nFIGURE 2 Survival-adjusted, observed 2-year liver tumor incidences in female mice at 0, 5, 15, 50, and\nlevel indicated a significant difference between the 0- and 15-ppm tumor\nrates (p < 0.044). (With Fisher's exact test, however, this difference was not\nstatistically significant at the 5% level (p = 0.097)).\nFor estimating risk at the experimental doses of fumonisin B1, survival-\nadjusted rates (NTP, 1999) rather than raw observed tumor rates were used,\nbut there was little difference between the unadjusted and adjusted rates\nbecause of comparable survival rates in the low-dose groups. Although the\nmodel does predict slightly less-than-background risk at 5 ppm in females\nand 15 ppm in males, it does not reproduce the full degree of reduction\nin tumor rates below the background rate that is actually observed at both\n5 and 15 ppm in both sexes. The model's prediction of slightly less-than-\nbackground risk in female mice at 5 ppm (Figure 2) coincides with a slightly\nlower average level of sphinganine in the liver at that dose (Kodell et al., 2001).\nHowever, at 15 ppm the average tissue level of sphinganine was higher than\nthat at 0 ppm. In fact, the tissue sphinganine data showed a high degree of\nLow-Dose Nonlinearity of Fumonisin B1 Liver Tumor Risk 39\nFIGURE 3 Survival-adjusted, observed 2-year liver tumor incidences in male mice at 0, 5, 15, 80, and\nvariability (Kodell et al., 2001: Figure 10), with average liver concentrations\npossible with these data to argue that tumor risk will be below background\nwhenever tissue sphinganine is below that of controls and vice versa. An alter-\nnative explanation of the low-dose nonlinearity might be that the effect on\ncell death has a \"threshold\" for tissue regeneration. That is, it could be that\nat very low doses the effect of increased apoptosis actually reduces the risk\nof cancer because of the reduced population of pre-neoplastic cells and that\nonly after a certain level of apoptosis is reached is compensatory cell prolifera-\ntion triggered. However, the estimated rates of apoptosis and proliferation at\nWith the present model and data, it is not possible to resolve whether the\napparent hormetic effect reflected in the observed liver tumor proportions\nat low doses is real. However, the mechanistically derived model is decidedly\nnonlinear at low doses and gives strong evidence against low-dose linearity\n40 R. L. Kodell and A. Turturro\n(Figures 2 and 3). This has important implications for risk assessment and\nfor the setting of acceptable exposures.\nImplications for Risk/Safety Assessment\nThe FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and its Center\nfor Veterinary Medicine recently published guidance levels for industry to\ncontrol total fumonisins (fumonisins B1, B2, and B3) in various corn-based\nhuman food products and animal feeds (FDA, 2001). These (nonbinding)\nguidance levels represent maximum total fumonisin levels that the FDA con-\nsiders adequate to protect human and animal health and that are achievable\nin human foods and animal feeds with the use of good agricultural and good\nmanufacturing practices. For example, the concentration of total fumon-\nisins in degermed dry-milled corn products (e.g., flaking grits, corn grits,\ncorn meal) should not exceed 2 ppm. For cleaned corn intended for pop-\ncorn, the guidance level is 3 ppm. In animal feeds intended for poultry being\nraised for slaughter, the maximum concentration of total fumonisins should\nnot exceed 100 ppm (no more than 50% of diet), whereas for horses and\nmost pet animals the guidance level is 10 ppm (no more than 50% of diet).\nIt is noteworthy how close the guidance levels for human foods are to the\nexperimental doses of the NTP rodent study. It is quite unusual for regulatory\nagencies to set levels this high relative to experimental levels. In the regu-\nlation of chemicals, often the absence of sufficient information to rule out\nlow-dose linearity leads to much lower allowable levels that are determined\nby linear extrapolation from the experimental dose range down to doses ex-\npected to correspond to negligible public health risks (e.g., 10-4 to 10-6).\nThe mathematical model's prediction of no increase in risk at low doses in\nmice based on a generally accepted nongenotoxic cancer mechanism for\nfumonisin B1 provides strong support for the FDA's deviation from linear\nextrapolation in its comprehensive safety assessment to set guidance levels\nfor fumonisins.\nTo gain additional perspective, suppose that linear extrapolation via the\nmultistage model had been used to determine acceptable exposure levels. Al-\nthough the data for female mice are decidedly nonlinear (actually U-shaped),\na multistage model can be fitted that is not rejected by a goodness-of-fit test\n(Figure 4). Figure 5 shows the background-subtracted best-fitting multistage\nmodel and the (linear) upper 95% confidence limit on excess (added) risk\nabove background in the extreme low-dose region. Note that the upper con-\nfidence limit on excess risk at 5 ppm, the lowest dose in the mouse studies, is\n10-2, which is several orders of magnitude above what most regulatory agen-\ncies consider acceptable public health risk. To assure an excess risk of no\n(500 ppt; Figure 5). This suggests that much lower guidance levels than those\nactually set by the FDA might have resulted had there not been a generally\nLow-Dose Nonlinearity of Fumonisin B1 Liver Tumor Risk 41\nat d = 0, 5, 15, 50, 80 ppm) overlaid with predicted values from the best-fitting multistage model:\naccepted nongenotoxic mechanism for fumonisin B1 with mechanistic data\nto support it.\nDISCUSSION\nThe availability of mechanistic data on the purported nongenotoxic\nmechanism of carcinogenic action of fumonisin B1 provided an opportunity\nto develop a mathematical dose-response model (Kodell et al., 2001) whose\nlow-dose predicted tumor risks in mice could be compared to the nonlinear\n(less-than-background) tumor rates actually observed in the experimental\nanimals (NTP, 1999). Although the model was developed primarily from an-\ncillary mechanistic data, the predictions matched the observed tumor data\nreasonably well, indicating no increased risk of liver tumors at low doses in\nfemales and significantly increased risk at high doses. The model's success-\nful predictions of tumor risk in female mice were validated by its prediction\nof no increased risk in males throughout the whole experimental range, in\nagreement with the observed data.\n42 R. L. Kodell and A. Turturro\nFIGURE 5 Background-corrected best-fitting multistage model overlaid with 95% upper bound on\nexcess risk at low doses.\nAlthough the mechanistic data and model are not strong enough to\ndemonstrate conclusively a hormetic effect in the tumor response at low doses\nas suggested by the 2-year tumor proportions, they are sufficiently strong to\nrule out low-dose linearity, which has immediate consequences for regulat-\ning exposures to fumonisin B1. In this regard, the model's results provide\nscientific support and justification for the FDA's low-ppm guidance levels in\ncorn products for both humans and animals (FDA, 2001). Those levels are\nsignificantly higher than would be obtained using linear extrapolation, the\nmethod most often used to regulate purported genotoxic carcinogens and\nother carcinogens for which low-dose linearity cannot be ruled out.\nIn its characterization of fumonisin B1's dose-response relationship for\ncancer, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives included\nan extensive discussion of the implementation by Kodell et al. (2001) of\nlying heavily on the observed threshold-like kidney tumor response in the\nexperimental rats from the same NTP study. The case of fumonisin B1 pro-\nvides an example of the impact that credible data and models relevant to a\nhypothesized mechanism of action can have on exposure levels that are set\nby public health agencies.\nLow-Dose Nonlinearity of Fumonisin B1 Liver Tumor Risk 43\nREFERENCES\nCohen SM, Bidlack WR, Dragan Y, Goldsworthy T, Hard G, Howard PC, Riley R, Voss K. 2000.
