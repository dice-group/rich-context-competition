Population disparities in exposure to these chemicals have\nnot been fully characterized.\nMethods: We analyzed data from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Using\nmultivariable linear regression we examined the association between urinary concentrations of BPA, serum\nconcentrations of four PFCs, and multiple measures of socioeconomic position (SEP): family income, education,\noccupation, and food security. We also examined associations with race/ethnicity.\nResults: All four PFCs were positively associated with family income, whereas BPA was inversely associated with\nfamily income. BPA concentrations were higher in people who reported very low food security and received\nemergency food assistance than in those who did not. This association was particularly strong in children: 6-11\nyear-olds whose families received emergency food had BPA levels 54% higher (95% CI, 13 to 112%) than children\nof families who did not. For BPA and PFCs we saw smaller and less consistent associations with education and\noccupation. Mexican Americans had the lowest concentrations of any racial/ethnic group of both types of\nchemicals; for PFCs, Mexican Americans not born in the U.S. had much lower levels than those born in the U.S.\nConclusions: People with lower incomes had higher body burdens of BPA; the reverse was true for PFCs. Family\nincome with adjustment for family size was the strongest predictor of chemical concentrations among the\ndifferent measures of SEP we studied. Income, education, occupation, and food security appear to capture different\naspects of SEP that may be related to exposure to BPA and PFCs and are not necessarily interchangeable as\nmeasures of SEP in environmental epidemiology studies. Differences by race/ethnicity were independent of SEP.\n",

Several comprehensive\nreviews of health outcomes associated with BPA have\nbeen published in the last five years [3-7]. PFCs are a\nclass of chemicals used widely in consumer products to\nimpart stain, oil, and water resistance. In particular they\nare used in food packaging and carpeting and textile\ntreatments [8]. Laboratory studies have found tumors in\ncertain organs and developmental delays in animals\nexposed to PFCs [9,10], and recent preliminary research\nin humans reported associations with birth weight, cho-\nThough BPA and PFCs are ubiquitous in peoples'\nurine and blood, with U.S. studies detecting them in\npathways of human exposure are not well understood.\nFor both chemicals, diet is thought to account for the\nmajority of exposure for most people. In the case of\nBPA, estimates for adults put the dietary contribution\nthe chemical from food cans and PC food containers\ninto food may account for most of this, though less-\nunderstood exposure routes may also contribute. For\nPFCs, studies have estimated the dietary contribution as\nHowever, the studies used to develop these estimates\nare limited in how fully they are able to assess overall\nhuman exposure. Recent studies suggest a contribution\nof indoor air and/or dust to PFC body burdens [21,22].\nBPA and PFCs behave very differently once taken into\nthe human body. BPA is rapidly metabolized via glucur-\nonidation, with an estimated urinary elimination half-life\nin humans of 5.4 hours [23]. A recent study suggests\nthat more accumulation may be occurring than pre-\nviously assumed, though the half-life is thought to be on\nthe order of days at the most [24]. PFCs, on the other\nhand, are poorly metabolized, with half-lives of greater\nthan two years in human serum [25,26]. They are\nthought to bind to proteins in the blood and tissues\nrather than to lipids, unlike most other persistent\norganic chemicals [27].\nPrevious studies have found socioeconomic and\nracial/ethnic differences in urine and serum levels of\nBPA and PFCs in a representative sample of the U.S.\nthe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES), Calafat et al. found that urinary BPA con-\ncentrations were highest among the lower income\ngroup (household incomes less than $20,000), and low-\nest among Mexican Americans compared to Non-His-\npanic Blacks and Non-Hispanic Whites [15]. In\ncontrast, PFC serum concentrations were lower in peo-\nple with less education (did not graduate from high\nschool), while Mexican Americans had lower levels\nthan other racial/ethnic groups [14]. Differences by\nSEP and race/ethnicity were not the focus of these stu-\ndies, and neither included detailed consideration of\nfactors that may explain the disparities.\nSEP and race/ethnicity, in and of themselves, are not\nlikely to explain the differential body burdens of these\nchemicals; rather, they serve as surrogates for activities,\nbehaviors, or circumstances that may actually contribute\nto differences. SEP has been defined as \"structural loca-\ntions within society that are powerful determinants of\nthe likelihood of health-damaging exposures and the\npossession of health-enhancing resources\" [28]. Figure 1\npresents a framework for conceptualizing these relation-\nships: through several pathways, SEP and race/ethnicity\nmay influence behaviors such as diet and use of consu-\nmer products which are sources of exposure to BPA\nand PFCs. Race/ethnicity is often associated with SEP,\nand may also be an independent determinant of dietary\nand other consumer behaviors.\nThere are numerous ways to characterize SEP; the\nmost commonly used measures are income, education,\nand occupation. While correlated with one another,\neach \"emphasizes a particular aspect of social stratifica-\ntion\" that, in this case, may be more or less relevant to\nthe pathways by which people are exposed to BPA and\nOur study builds on the previous work by Calafat et\nal. that found opposite associations between measures of\nSEP and body burdens of BPA and PFCs; one study\nreported differences by income and the other by educa-\ntion [14,15]. We further investigate these apparent\nopposite trends by examining relationships between\nboth chemicals and a common set of SEP measures:\nfamily income (categorized in four ways), education,\noccupation, and food security (measured in two ways).\nOccupation and food security have not been studied\nbefore in the general population in relation to both BPA\nand PFC levels. We also consider the complex relation-\nship between SEP and race/ethnicity, and expand the\ninvestigation to an additional NHANES cycle, 2005-\n2006. This study provides insights into social disparities\nin exposure to these two types of chemicals, and sheds\nlight on hypothesized sources of exposure.\nMethods\nStudy population\nWe used data from NHANES, an ongoing survey of the\ncivilian non-institutionalized U.S. population conducted\nby the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC). NHANES uses a complex multistage probability\nsampling design to select participants, and certain\nracial/ethnic, income, and age groups are oversampled\nparticipants per year are enrolled, and data are released\nin two-year cycles. Our study used data from two cycles,\nParticipants came to a mobile examination center for\na physical examination and to provide blood and urine\nsamples, and numerous questionnaires were adminis-\ntered by trained interviewers [30]. Random one-third\nsubsamples of participants had their urine and serum\nanalyzed for environmental chemicals by the National\nCenter for Environmental Health. BPA was measured in\nurine of participants aged six and older, and PFCs in\nserum of participants aged 12 and older. The subsam-\nples of participants did not overlap for the chemical\nanalyses. NHANES obtained informed consent from all\nparticipants.\nBiomonitoring measurements\nTotal BPA concentration was measured in urine, and\nincludes BPA parent compound and conjugated metabo-\nlites [15]. Measurements were made using solid phase\nextraction coupled online to high performance liquid\nchromatography and tandem mass spectroscopy [15].\nPFCs were measured in serum using solid phase extrac-\ntion coupled to high performance liquid chromatogra-\nphy-turbo ion spray ionization and tandem mass\nspectrometry [14]. The same laboratory techniques were\nused in both cycles, though limits of detection (LODs)\nfor certain chemicals varied slightly between years.\nTwelve PFCs were measured in serum. We examined\nthe four PFCs detected in greater than 98% of partici-\npants: perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluor-\nooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA),\nand perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS). Values\nbelow the LOD were reported by NHANES as the LOD\ndivided by the square root of two.\nMeasures of SEP and race/ethnicity\nNumerous measures of self-reported SEP were available\nfor participants, assessed through interviews conducted\nin-person by trained interviewers [31]. We used\nresponses from the following questionnaires: demo-\nParticipants reported their annual family income in\n$5000 increments, with a top category of greater than\n$75,000. If they refused to answer at this level of detail,\nthey were asked whether their income was less or\ngreater than $20,000. We categorized annual family\ntwo groups, with a $20,000 cut point, a measure often\nused in NHANES studies because it maximizes sample\nsize. We also considered the poverty-income ratio (PIR),\na ratio of the midpoint of the family income category to\nthe official U.S. poverty threshold as determined by the\nU.S. Census Bureau, adjusted for family size [35]. A PIR\nof 1 means that family income is equal to the poverty\nthreshold [37]. We used the following categories: less\nthan 1 (i.e. below the poverty threshold), 1-3, and\ngreater than 3. Finally, we looked at family income\nadjusted by the square root [38] of family size (available\nEducational attainment was assessed for those aged 20\nand older. We used the following categories: less than\nhigh school, high school graduate, some college/associ-\nate's degree, and college graduate or above.\nand for those over age 16.

This hybrid classification system has been\nemployed in previous studies using NHANES data [39];\ndetail on categories is available in Additional file 1. In\nour analysis we used information on longest-held\noccupation.\nFood security was measured by NHANES using the U.\nS. Food Security Survey Module that assesses whether\nparticipants and others in their family had adequate\nfood over the last 12 months [32]. Questions included,\n\"were you ever hungry but didn't eat because you\ncouldn't afford enough food?\" and \"did your child ever\nskip meals because there wasn't enough money for\nhouseholds with incomes over 4 times the poverty\nthreshold were screened out [32,34]. Responses to the\nindividual food security questions were summed by\nNHANES into an overall food security status variable,\nand reported as full, marginal, low, and very low. In\naddition, we looked at whether the participant or a\nmember of their household received emergency food\n(from a church, food pantry, food bank, or soup kitchen)\nin the last 12 months.\nNHANES assessed race/ethnicity through a series of\nquestions [35]. The participant was first asked whether\nthey consider themselves Hispanic/Latino. They were\nthen asked, \"What race do you consider yourself to\nbe?\" and could select one or more from a list of fif-\nteen options, including \"White,\" \"Black/African Amer-\nican,\" and \"Some other race.\" Finally, they were asked\nto choose the one group that best represents their\nrace, with the possible option, \"I cannot choose one\nrace.\" The variable released by NHANES combines\nthese questions and groups people into one of five\ncategories: Mexican American, Other Hispanic, Non-\nHispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, and Other\nincluding Multiracial. We also examined whether\nthere were differences among Mexican Americans\naccording to country of birth, since a previous study\nof polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) found\nimportant differences in serum concentration by coun-\nCovariates\nWe included a small group of covariates in our analyses\na priori based on known associations with urine/blood\nconcentrations of BPA and PFCs: age (in categories: 6-\nof BPA, urinary creatinine, a measure of urinary dilution\n(continuous variable, mg/dL of urine). We included\ncreatinine as a term in the model rather than using\ncreatinine-adjusted BPA concentrations; creatinine is\nknown to vary by age, gender, and race/ethnicity [41].\nAs previous studies have reported changes in BPA and\nPFC body burdens over time, we also controlled for\nWe tested to see whether additional variables were\nacting as confounders; these included time of exam ses-\nsion and total cholesterol (TC, in PFC models only).\nParticipants over age 12 were randomly assigned to\neither the morning or afternoon/evening exam sessions;\nthose attending the morning session were asked to fast\nfor 9.5 hours, and the latter two for 6 hours [31]. An\nexamination of urinary BPA and reported fasting time\nconcentrations with reported fasting time [24]. Although\nparticipants were randomly assigned to exam session\ntime, it is possible that there could be differences in\nattendance or fasting adherence. TC has been shown to\nbe associated with PFCs in this data set and is likely\nassociated with SEP as well [13].\nStatistical analysis\nWe compared the different measures of SEP by examin-\ning frequency tables of education, occupation, and food\nsecurity by quartiles of adjusted family income. We ana-\nlyzed associations between chemical concentrations and\nSEP and race/ethnicity using multivariable linear regres-\nsion. Both BPA and PFC concentrations were approxi-\nmately log-normally distributed; while most individuals\nhad detectable concentrations, the great majority of\nvalues were on the low end of the distribution. We thus\nanalyzed both as natural log-transformed continuous\nvariables. We first examined associations with SEP mea-\nsures separately, controlling for race/ethnicity and the\npreviously-mentioned covariates. Because we wanted to\ncompare different SEP measures, the final study popula-\ntion in the income and food security models consisted\nof participants who had complete data on all income\nand food security variables. The sample sizes were smal-\nler for the education and occupation analyses due to the\nmore limited population for which these variables were\navailable (Additional file 2). In this subset of participants\nwe also examined associations with income and food\nsecurity.\nTo determine if certain SEP variables were more\nimportant predictors than others, we next included mul-\ntiple SEP variables in the same model. We studied the\nrelationship between SEP and race/ethnicity by compar-\ning results of models with race/ethnicity alone to those\nthat included SEP measures to assess whether this chan-\nged the race/ethnicity results. We also considered, sepa-\nrately, interaction by age and gender by including age-\nand gender-by-SEP terms in the models, and by using\nstratification.\nAll regression analyses were performed using the SAS\n9.1 Proc SURVEYREG procedure, which takes into\naccount possible correlation between the strata and\nclusters by which NHANES samples the population. As\nour intent was to investigate these relationships in a\ndefined population, models were adjusted for relevant\ncovariates instead of using NHANES sampling weights.\nThis adjustment is regarded as a good compromise\nbetween efficiency and bias [42].\nWe present effect estimates for levels of SEP variables\nand racial/ethnic groups, which represent the percent\ndifference in BPA and PFC concentration for each cate-\ngory compared to the reference group, and their corre-\nsponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Effect\nestimates were calculated by exponentiating the natural\nlog-transformed regression coefficients. We assessed sta-\ntistical significant at the alpha = 0.05 level.\nResults\npants had BPA measurements and 4214 had PFC mea-\nsurements; the difference in numbers is due to the fact\nthat PFCs were not measured in 6-11 year-olds. For\nincome and food security measures of SEP, which were\navailable for all age groups, our final sample size was\nwith missing data for the variables of interest (see Addi-\ntional file 2). The different income measures we studied\nhad different numbers of participants with missing data:\nfamily income categorized as less or greater than\nadjusted family income and PIR had the most (5%). The\nfinal sample sizes for the education analyses were\nrestricted to those older than 20, and for occupation to\nTable 1 displays unadjusted median concentrations of\nBPA (creatinine-corrected) and PFCs by covariates, the\nSEP measures studied, and racial/ethnic groups. Median\nurinary BPA was highest in children, women, partici-\npants in the earlier NHANES cycle, and those with\nlower incomes. Of the PFCs, PFOS had the highest\nserum concentrations; median levels were an order of\nmagnitude greater than PFOA, PFHxS, and PFNA. PFCs\noverall were higher in men than women, and PFOS was\nhighest in the oldest age group and in the earlier\nNHANES cycle. Differences by income and race/ethni-\ncity were most apparent for PFOS and PFOA, with the\nhighest levels seen in higher income groups and non-\nHispanic Whites.\nThe different SEP measures were related to one\nanother in a predictable fashion: of those who graduated\nfrom college, 67% were in the top adjusted family\nincome quartile; 43% of participants who never worked\nwere in the bottom quartile; and 53% and 57% of those\nwith very low food security or who received emergency\nfood, respectively, were in the bottom quartile (Addi-\ntional file 3). However, there was some discordance\nacross SEP variables. For example, almost 30% of parti-\ncipants with less than a high school education were in\nthe top two income quartiles; the distribution of the\noccupational categories, particularly the \"blue collar,\nhigh skill\" group, was fairly evenly distributed across\nincome quartiles; and close to 40% of those reporting\nfull food security were in the bottom two quartiles.\nSocioeconomic position\nIn adjusted regression analyses, urinary concentrations\nof BPA were inversely related to all four measures of\nincome (Table 2). For example, those in the lowest\nquartile of adjusted family income had BPA concentra-\nhighest income quartile. Though the four family income\nvariables revealed similar patterns, the magnitude of the\ndifference was decreased with the two-category variable.\nWe also saw higher concentrations in those with very\nlow food security, and those who received emergency\nfood. Though we did not see an inverse trend with edu-\ncational attainment, college graduates had the lowest\nBPA levels. Results for occupation did not reveal a con-\nsistent pattern, though the \"blue collar, high skill\" group\n(including vehicle mechanics, construction workers, and\nmembers of the armed forces) had higher BPA concen-\ntrations. In these and all other models, controlling for\nexam session did not change the observed associations\nwith SEP or race/ethnicity.\nResults for PFCs revealed an opposite relationship\nthan that for BPA; all four PFCs had strong positive\nassociations with income (Table 2). For PFOA, those in\nthe lowest quartile of adjusted family income had PFC\nthan those in the highest quartile. As in the BPA analy-\nsis, using the two-category income variable attenuated\nthe association, and income measures adjusted for\nhousehold size resulted in stronger associations with\nPFC levels. Those who received emergency food had\nlower concentrations of PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA, as did\nthose with low food security (although we did not see\nthe same strong association with very low food security).\nTable 1 Distribution of variables and BPA and PFC concentrations by population characteristics\nn (%) median (g/ g\ncreatinine)\nn (%) PFOA median\n(g/L)\nPFOS median\n(g/L)\nPFNA median\n(g/L)\nPFHxS median\n(g/L)\nAge\nGender\nNHANES cycle\nFamily income\nPoverty income ratio\nAdjusted family incomea\nFood security status\nAssociations between education and occupation and\nPFC level were weaker than for income, though PFNA\nconcentrations were lower in those who had never\nworked. When restricted to the subset with information\non education and occupation, relationships for income,\nfood security, and emergency food assistance were\nslightly stronger than in the population overall (data not\nshown). Similar to exam session, controlling for TC in\nthese and all other PFC models did not affect results.\nWhen multiple SEP measures were included in the\nsame model, adjusted family income remained the pre-\ndictor of the greatest magnitude and strength for both\nBPA and PFCs (Table 3). Effect estimates for food\nsecurity status and use of emergency food decreased\nwhen income was added, though, for BPA, regression\ncoefficients remained elevated in the same pattern (but\nwithout statistical significance).\nModification by age and gender\nWe found some evidence for different effects by age in\nthe results for adjusted family income and food security.\nOverall, the effect estimates for family income were\nmost consistent in 20-59 year-olds, with a clear trend\nfor BPA and all four PFCs (Additional file 4). For BPA,\nincome was only associated with urinary levels in the\nyounger three age groups; there was no association in\nthe oldest age group. The strong association between\nBPA concentrations and food security (both very low\nfood security and use of emergency food) was markedly\nstronger in 6-11 year-olds. Children who received\nTable 1 Distribution of variables and BPA and PFC concentrations by population characteristics (Continued)\nEmergency food\nEducationb\nSome college/AA\ndegree\nLongest occupationb\nWhite collar, semi-\nroutine\nWhite collar &\nprofessional\nRace/Ethnicity\nMexican American US\nborn\nMexican American\nForeign born\na Quartiles of adjusted family income were calculated in the overall 2003-2006 population, so the numbers within the PFC and BPA subsets are unequal\nto 112%) than children who did not.

For PFCs, the inverse associations by\nincome and food security were most apparent in 20-59\nyear-olds except for PFHxS, where associations were\nalso strong in those over 60.\nWe observed fewer differences by gender (data not\nshown). Very low food security and receipt of emer-\ngency food were more strongly associated with BPA\nconcentrations in women than in men. For PFCs,\nTable 2 Percent change in BPA and PFC concentrations by different SEP measuresa\nFamily income\nFamily income\nPoverty income ratio\nPIR > 3 ref ref Ref ref ref\nAdjusted family income\nQuartile 4 ref ref Ref ref ref\nFood security status\nFull ref ref Ref ref ref\nEmergency food\nNo ref ref Ref ref ref\nEducationb\nCollege grad or above ref ref Ref ref ref\nLongest occupationb\nWhite collar & professional ref ref Ref ref ref\na Models adjusted for NHANES cycle, age, gender, race/ethnicity, creatinine (BPA).

In models unadjusted for a measure of\nSEP, BPA concentrations were lower in Mexican Ameri-\ncans compared to Non-Hispanic Whites (Table 4). The\nrelationship was stronger in Mexican Americans born in\nthe U.S. than in those born elsewhere (Table 5).

Non-Hispanic Blacks had lower\nPFOA concentrations compared to Non-Hispanic\nWhites, but higher PFNA and, to a lesser extent, PFOS\nlevels. These positive associations increased with control\nfor income.\nDiscussion\nOur findings show that people with lower incomes, who\nmay be more likely to suffer from other disparities in\nhealth and exposures, have a greater burden of exposure\nto BPA. The results for children are especially troubling.\nChildren overall had higher urinary BPA concentrations\nthan teenagers or adults, but children whose food\nsecurity was very low or who received emergency food\nassistance - in other words, the most vulnerable children\n- had the highest levels of any demographic group.\nTheir urinary BPA levels were twice as high as adults\nwho did not receive emergency food assistance. Con-\ncerns about health effects from BPA exposure are stron-\ngest for young children and neonates because they are\nstill undergoing development [3]. Results for BPA by\nrace/ethnicity, adjusting for income, revealed that Non-\nHispanic Whites and Blacks had similar urinary levels,\nand being Mexican American appeared to be highly\nprotective.\nFindings for PFCs revealed differences by socioeco-\nnomic position in the opposite direction.

We did not see the same vulnerability in\nyounger age groups as with BPA; associations with\nincome were strongest in adults. However, NHANES\ndid not measure PFCs in 6-11 year-olds. While there\nwas some variation by race/ethnicity, Non-Hispanic\nWhites had the highest levels for two of the four PFCs\nand being Mexican American again appeared to be\nprotective.\nThe possible pathways by which SEP is associated with\ndifferential exposures to BPA and PFCs may be eluci-\ndated by comparing results for the individual SEP vari-\nables. Family income was by far the most consistent and\nimportant predictor of concentrations; it had a clear\ndose-response pattern for all chemicals, and remained\nthe strongest when included in models with other SEP\nvariables simultaneously. Conceptually, income reflects\naccess to material goods; a family's current household\nincome is the most specific measure of their immediate\nfinancial resources [28]. Thus, income may affect expo-\nsure to BPA and PFCs via types of foods consumed or\nvia other consumer products used (or not used) in the\nhome. Past studies that have examined the effect of\nincome, education, and occupation on diet quality have\nconsistently found that income is the most important\nand strongest predictor of diet [43,44]. Given that diet is\nassumed to be a major pathway of exposure to these\nchemicals, differences in food purchasing patterns by\nincome seems one likely explanation for the observed\ndifferences.\nThe literature on specific differences in diet by mea-\nsures of SEP is large; a review offers this summary of\nsocioeconomic status (SES) and dietary intake: \"available\nevidence suggests that consumption of whole grains,\nlean meats, fish, low-fat dairy products, and fresh vege-\ntables and fruit was consistently associated with higher\nSES groups, whereas the consumption of fatty meats,\nrefined grains, and added fats was associated with lower\nSES groups\" [45]. Cost of food is a compelling hypoth-\nesis for why this differential exists, as foods with higher\nenergy density are cheaper per amount of energy, but\nalso tend to be nutrient-poor [45]. This is thought to be\nan important reason why consumption of fresh fruits\nand vegetables in particular is lower in people with\nlower incomes. Income is also a strong determinant of\nwhere a person lives, and there is a growing body of lit-\nerature on the lack of access to large supermarkets and\nample fresh fruits and vegetables in lower income neigh-\nThis is the first study to examine the relationship\nbetween body burdens of BPA and PFCs and two mea-\nsures of food security as possible proxies for SEP. We\nconceptualized these variables as representing the inter-\nsection of income and dietary behavior, and assumed\nthat those with very low food security, or those who\nreceived emergency food, were an especially vulnerable\npopulation in terms of accessible dietary options. Parti-\ncularly in regards to BPA exposure, we hypothesized\nthat they would be more likely to eat canned foods.\nRecent research indicates that eating canned and pack-\naged foods can contribute to BPA body burdens [47].\nWe did see associations in the hypothesized direction\nbetween BPA and the food security measures; there was\na particularly strong signal with very low food security\ncompared to low and marginal food security, and an\nassociation of slightly lower magnitude in those who\nreceived emergency food. These associations were atte-\nnuated when controlling for income, though coefficients\nremained positive. More striking were the associations\nbetween BPA and food security in 6-11 year-olds, which\nwere of the greatest magnitude of any age group. This\ncould be due to greater consumption of foods contain-\ning BPA, or the fact that children consume more food\nper body weight than adults. Though use of emergency\nfood was also associated with PFCs, food security status\nwas not as important a predictor for these compounds.\nWe saw fewer and less consistent associations between\neducation and concentrations of BPA and PFCs, particu-\nlarly PFCs. Education is a long-term indicator of SEP,\nand embodies the transition in SEP from childhood to\nadulthood [28,44]. In terms of the specific ways in\nwhich education may impact exposure to chemicals, it is\nthought to represent the ability to access and interpret\nhealth-related information [28]. With exposure to BPA\nand PFCs, however, this type of knowledge may not be\nuseful in reducing exposures, as consumers most often\ndo not know that they are being exposed to these che-\nmicals, nor how exposure is occurring. The recent flurry\nof media and political action around BPA in baby bot-\ntles and PC water bottles may be changing this dynamic\nfor BPA, and may explain the slightly stronger associa-\ntions we observed with education, but increased atten-\ntion began only in the last few years and is not relevant\nfor the bulk of the study period [48]. Similar to previous\nstudies, we found some discordance between education\nand current income [44,49]. For BPA, which has a very\nshort half-life, we would be more interested in current\nand not long-term income, since the foods and products\na person purchased in the very recent past directly con-\ntribute to urinary levels.\nThere appeared to be little association between BPA\nand PFCs and occupation; however, our ability to draw\nconclusions about these relationships is limited by the\nfact that we had smaller numbers as data were only\nmany associations between the compounds and occupa-\ntion classified into five skill- and work relations-based\ncategories. It seems unlikely that work-related\npsychosocial stress would affect exposure, though the\nphysical conditions of a workplace could contribute to\nexposures. Examples include working in an office with\nnew carpeting or furniture that contains PFC precursors\n[21] or a job in retail that involves handling credit card\nreceipts that contain BPA [50].\nThe weaker associations observed for education and\noccupation may also be partly related to the fact that\nboth are measured on the level of the individual,\nwhereas family income and food security are family-\nlevel measures [44]. The latter two variables may be\nmore accurate measures of SEP insofar as family pur-\nchasing patterns are concerned. This distinction could\nbe important for food purchasing behavior, as it is not\nclear who in the family (i.e. the participant or some\nother family member) makes the food shopping\ndecisions.\nOur results clearly show differences in BPA and PFC\nbody burdens by measures of SEP that were not\nexplained by race/ethnicity, and vice versa. It is likely\nthat cultural behaviors and patterns are associated with\nrace/ethnicity independent of SEP. The strikingly lower\nconcentrations of both chemicals in Mexican Americans,\neven after controlling for income, was the most notable\nresult regarding race/ethnicity. This is particularly unex-\npected for BPA, where Mexican Americans do not fit\nwith the observed pattern of lower income groups hav-\ning higher urinary concentrations. Mexican Americans\nand Hispanics have been shown to have higher intake of\nfruits and vegetables compared to Non-Hispanic Blacks\nand Whites in different population-based surveys,\nHealth Interview Survey [52]. Eating more fresh fruits\nand vegetables is likely to be associated with eating less\ncanned foods, which may explain the lower urinary BPA\nlevels seen in Mexican Americans compared to other\ngroups.\nIn addition, we observed that foreign-born Mexican\nAmericans had markedly lower serum concentrations of\nPFCs than U.S.-born Mexican Americans, except for\nPFNA. This is consistent with the fact that PFCs have\nlong half-lives, and exposure from many years past (i.e.\nwhen living in Mexico, where exposures may be lower)\ncould impact current serum levels. Similar patterns have\nbeen seen for some other persistent lipophilic chemicals\n[40,53]. For BPA, foreign- and U.S.-born Mexican\nAmericans had similar levels, which makes sense given\nthat BPA has a short half-life, and lower exposures from\nyears past would not matter.\nA final aspect of SEP and its relationship with race/\nethnicity that must be mentioned is wealth. Wealth can\nbe thought of as the \"accumulated assets\" of an indivi-\ndual or family, usually in the form of savings, real estate,\nand inherited items, and represents economic security\n[54]. While there are no direct measures of wealth in\nNHANES, differences in wealth by race/ethnicity are\nreported to be much larger than differences by income;\nfor the same income, the amount of wealth for African\nAmericans and Hispanics has been shown to be much\nlower than for Whites [28]. Thus, adjusting for income\nalone may underestimate the real effect of SEP [28], and\ndifferences by race/ethnicity may suffer from residual\nconfounding due to inability to adjust for wealth.\nOur findings have various practical implications for\nenvironmental epidemiology. It is standard in environ-\nmental epidemiology studies to include some measure\nof SEP as a covariate in models. But, it is rare to see a\ndiscussion of the rationale for the choice of SEP vari-\nable. In many instances, there seems to be an assump-\ntion that different measures, particularly income and\neducation, serve as surrogates for the same underlying\nphenomenon, and that they can be used interchange-\nably. Our study finds that, for urine and serum concen-\ntrations of BPA and PFCs, this is not the case; the SEP\nmeasures we studied do not overlap entirely with one\nanother, and had different estimates of effect in our\nregression models. We conclude that, in the context of\nthis study, income, education, occupation, and food\nsecurity do not represent the same socioeconomic con-\nstructs, but rather seem to capture different aspects of\nhow SEP may be related to exposure to BPA and PFCs.\nWhile constraints regarding data availability and the\nneed to maximize sample size will always be an issue,\nthe question of which SEP measure to use is an impor-\ntant methodologic concern, and merits more considera-\ntion by researchers in the field.\nAs discussed, family income was the most important\nSEP predictor in our investigation. We found that ade-\nquate gradations must be used, however, to see the full\nextent of the effect. When modeled as a dichotomous\nvariable with a cut point of $20,000, which is tempting\nto do in NHANES as there are fewer missing partici-\npants, the full effect of SEP was underestimated. There\nwas also some indication that income measures that\nadjusted for household size, such as adjusted family\nincome and PIR, were stronger predictors. Regarding\neducation, we found that using a dichotomous variable\nwith a cut point of high school graduation did not fully\ncapture the SEP difference. Participants with some col-\nlege or an associate's degree were more similar to high\nschool graduates than college graduates. A disadvantage\nof using education as a measure of SEP is that it is not\na useful measure for children, a concern that also\napplies to occupation. In addition, our findings related\nto occupation are limited due to the smaller sample\nsize, but it may be the case that a different approach to\ncategorizing occupation, such as one based on type of\nindustry, would be more closely related to the outcomes\nof interest. Food security, though not as commonly used\nto assess SEP, revealed important information about a\nvulnerable population - children whose families have\nvery low food security or receive emergency food aid -\ninformation that other SEP measures failed to provide.\nRegarding the measurement of race and ethnicity in\nstudies such as these, our findings show that useful\ninformation can be gleaned from considering country of\norigin, particularly for Mexican Americans. This follows\nInherent in our study are a number of limitations.\nOne concern is possible confounding by geography,\nwhich we cannot assess with publicly-available NHANES\ndata. Regional and local populations vary in measures of\nSEP and race/ethnicity; if BPA and PFC exposures also\ndiffer with geography, there could be confounding. This\ngeographic variation in chemical exposures could occur\nthrough differences in environmental contamination-\nlocalized contamination with certain PFCs has been\nreported in the USA (e.g., Hoffman et al. [55])- or in\nconsumption patterns of foods and other products that\nlead to exposure. In particular, the striking findings for\nMexican Americans must be taken with caution. Zota et\nal. [40] received permission to access state-level geo-\nand showed that, because Californians overall had\nhigher serum concentrations of PBDEs and a large pro-\nportion of Mexican Americans sampled by NHANES\nlived in California, residence in California confounded\nresults for Mexican Americans. Further investigation of\ngeographical differences in body burdens would be\ngreatly aided by the public release of NHANES data\nindicating region of the USA, something that would\nappear unlikely to threaten confidentiality.\nWe relied on a single biomonitoring measurement of\nthe chemicals of interest. This is less of an issue for\nPFCs, which have long half-lives and we would not\nexpect concentrations to vary significantly within an\nindividual. For BPA, however, this is more of a concern.\nMahalingaiah et al. [56] showed a single spot urine sam-\nple to be predictive of exposure over weeks to months,\ndespite within person variability. However, they assessed\na single sample's ability to classify participants into ter-\ntiles, which is not how we modeled our data. And, they\nconcluded that a second sample offered improvements\nin classifying individuals.\nFor both compounds, there are complications involved\nin interpreting results from biomonitoring data. While\nbiomonitoring measurements provide a useful estimate\nof internal dose, there is likely inter- and intra-indivi-\ndual variation in measurements as a result of various\nfactors that influence the chemical's pharmacokinetics, i.\ne. its distribution among compartments of the body,\nmetabolism, and excretion [57]. These factors include\ngenetics, biological characteristics such as gender, body\nfatness, and liver function, and environmental factors\nsuch as diet, all of which may affect a chemical's phar-\nmacokinetics. Though these concerns may be particu-\nlarly relevant for BPA, which is measured as a urinary\nmetabolite, many questions remain about the pharmaco-\nkinetic behavior of both BPA and PFCs in the body.\nThe measures of SEP we studied are all based on self-\nreported data. Getting participants to report personal\nincome in particular is notoriously difficult [28]. How-\never, the NHANES approach of asking people to report\nin income categories seemed to work reasonably well, as\nless than 4% of participants were missing family income\ndata. A limitation in our assessment of SEP was the\navailability of only two years of data for occupation.\nOur study has several strengths, including a large sam-\nple size, unrivalled in studies of this nature that involve\ncostly biomonitoring measurements. The NHANES\nsampling methodology of oversampling certain racial/\nethnic, income, and age groups was critical in providing\nan excellent distribution of participants across different\ncategories. Thus, we had ample power to detect associa-\ntions between different SEP and racial/ethnic groups,\nand were able to consider modification by age and gen-\nder. Another key advantage was the availability of robust\ndata on a variety of SEP measures. This enabled us to\ncompare different SEP-related variables.\nThis paper has primarily explored associations\nbetween body burdens and measures of SEP and race/\nethnicity. More research is needed on the specific\naspects of diet, consumer products, and other activities\nor circumstances that provide the links between SEP/\nrace/ethnicity and body burdens (Figure 1). This ques-\ntion might be approached using dietary intake data,\nmeasures of indoor exposure, and other techniques.\nConclusions\nCharacterizing social disparities in exposure to poten-\ntially harmful chemicals is an important responsibility of\nenvironmental health. The juxtaposition of BPA and\nPFCs together reveals a striking opposite pattern of\nassociations with measures of SEP, particularly income.\nBPA levels were inversely associated and PFC levels\npositively associated with family income. Differences by\nrace/ethnicity - most notably, markedly lower concen-\ntrations in Mexican Americans for both BPA and PFCs\n- were independent of SEP. We conclude that income,\neducation, occupation, and food security represent dis-\ntinct facets of social stratification and are not necessarily\ninterchangeable as measures of SEP in environmental\nepidemiology studies. In these data, family income with\nadjustment for family size was the strongest predictor of\nBPA and PFC levels among the different measures of\nSEP we studied. Examining differences in body burden\nby a range of SEP measures can provide useful insights\nabout the conceptual basis for the choice of SEP mea-\nsure and about vulnerable populations, and can raise\nhypotheses about possible sources of exposure.\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: Categories of longest-held occupation.\nAdditional file 2: Determination of final sample size for analyses.\nAdditional file 3: Relationship of different SEP measures to adjusted\nfamily income.\nAdditional file 4: Percent change in BPA and PFC concentrations by\nincome and food security, stratified by age.\nAbbreviations\nBPA: Bisphenol A; CDC: Centers for disease control and prevention; CI:\nConfidence interval; EDC: Endocrine disrupting chemical; LOD: Limit of\ndetection; NHANES: National health and nutrition examination survey; PBDE:\nPolybrominated diphenyl ether; PC: Polycarbonate plastic; PFC:\nPolyfluoroalkyl chemical; PFHxS: Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid; PFNA:\nPerfluorononanoic acid; PFOA: Perfluorooctanoic acid; PFOS: Perfluorooctane\nsulfonic acid; SEP: Socioeconomic position; SES: Socioeconomic status; TC:\nTotal cholesterol.\n"
