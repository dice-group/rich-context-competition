To understand declines in chronic disability prevalence in the U.S. elderly population, we examined cohort\nchanges in active life expectancy, a health measure relating population disability and longevity dynamics.\nMethods. We computed active life expectancy and life expectancy using the six National Long-Term Care Surveys\ndone from 1982 to 2004 and linked to continuous-time Medicare service data for the same time period by using\na stochastic process model based on disability scores calculated using grade of membership analyses. We simultaneously\nestimated continuous-time disability dynamic and mortality functions to calculate life tables for specific disability states\nand for temporally changing mixtures of disability states.\nResults. Disability dynamics, measured as changes in grade of membership scores, showed significant variation across\ntwo birth cohorts followed for 24 years. Disability dynamics and disability-specific hazard functions were significantly\nDiscussion. Our results, supporting the hypothesis of morbidity compression, indicate that younger cohorts of elderly\npersons are living longer in better health. The methods describe individual disability transitions and mortality and other\nfactors associated with disability changes, making it possible to better evaluate interventions to promote future declines in\ndisability.\nKey Words: Active life expectancy--Disability dynamics--Grade of membership--Fokker-Planck.\nACTIVE life expectancy (ALE) is often used to measure\nthe person-year burden of functional disability both in the\nU.S. elderly population and for international comparisons of\ndeveloped countries with relatively high life expectancies and\naging populations (Robine & Michel, 2004; Robine, Romieu, &\nMichel, 2003). The World Health Organization recommends\nALE as an important health measure for comparing developed\ncountries with aging populations because this measure better\nreflects health status and quality-of-life issues that, in those\ncountries, may vary more than total life expectancy (LE).\nOften ALE is calculated by using cross-sectional life table\nmethods (Sullivan, 1971) applied to demographic data on\nmortality (e.g., national life tables) and age-specific disability\nprevalence rates calculated from national health surveys. Cross-\nsectional estimates of ALE calculated at several points in time\ncan be used to track changes in the overall performance of the\nU.S. health care delivery system because they reflect the health\nand functional status of the entire U.S. elderly population at\neach date (e.g., Manton, Gu, & Lamb, 2006b; Mathers &\nstatus other than disability can also be used to refine the\ndecomposition of total LE. For example, chronic morbidity and\nacute health service use have been used as health state\nidentifiers, as have various types of institutional and long-\nterm care service use (Ogawa, 1982). Assuming the shape of\nthe population age trajectories of survival and disability\nintensity remain similar over time, period changes in LE and\nALE may carry useful information about cohort health changes\nAnother important issue in calculating ALE is how the health\nor functional state (here defined in terms of loss of various self-\nmaintenance functions) is defined. Many analysts have used\nsimple disability measures (e.g., activities of daily living\n[ADLs], instrumental ADLs [IADLs] based on counts of\ndisabilities made at specific points in time; Manton et al.,\n2006b). Others have used various interview and subjective\nexpert elicitation procedures to determine the perceived utility\nof being in a specific health-impaired state defined across\na 0 (death) to 1 (healthy) scale. Such procedures have been used\nto calculate quality-adjusted life years, disability-adjusted life\nyears, and health-adjusted life years (e.g., A\n\u00a8 ija\n\u00a8nseppa\n\u00a8 et al.,\nMuch of the interest in ALE in the United States is\nattributable to recent changes in adult LE. From 1954 to\n1968, male LE in the United States declined due to increases in\ncardiovascular disease (CVD) risks. After 1968, male LE began\nto increase due to declines in male CVD mortality. By 1980 it\nbecame clear that the male LE increase was not a fluke--it was\ndue to persistent declines in both heart disease and stroke\nmortality.\nA general acceptance that disability declines were occurring\nin the U.S. elderly population did not occur until data from the\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2008 by The Gerontological Society of America\n1994 National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) became\navailable and were analyzed (Freedman & Soldo, 1994;\nScientific acceptance that disability declines were occurring\ninternationally came even later (e.g., Robine et al., 2003). In\n1983, a strategy was implemented to increase the normal\nretirement age for Social Security from age 65, starting in 2003,\nnormal retirement age might be raised even further, for example\ncurrent survival conditions). Manton, Lowrimore, Ullian,\nXiLiang, and Tolley (2007) estimated the effect of extending\nthe Social Security eligibility age coupled with the decline in\ndisability on workforce participation.\nThough lacking detailed longitudinal health data in 1982,\nsome authors nonetheless argued that the health problems of\nmodern industrial societies at the third stage of the epidemi-\nological transition would be dominated by chronic degenerative\ndiseases (Omran, 1971) and a failure of medicine to effectively\ntreat chronic disease (McKinlay & McKinlay, 1977). Other\ninvestigators suggested that the fundamental processes of\nchronic disease were not being altered--only LE in disabled\ncontrast, Fries (1980) suggested that ALE was increasing more\nrapidly than total LE, producing ``morbidity compression.''\nManton (1989) argued that morbidity and disability declines\nand longevity increases were all processes positively correlated\nin individuals so that there would be a dynamic (over time and\nage) equilibrium of morbidity- and disability-free life span with\ntotal longevity.\nUnfortunately, nationally representative longitudinal data on\nU.S. morbidity and disability in the elderly population only\nempirical longitudinal tests of the different models could not be\nestimates of ALE for Canada. Others who made ALE estimates\nfor the United States using other data, including longitudinal\ndata from local studies, include Crimmins and Saito (2001),\nGuralnik, Land, Blazer, Fillenbaum, and Branch (1993), and\nManton and Land (2000) calculated ALE measures by using\nvariants of the stochastic process procedures employed herein\n(Manton, Stallard, & Liu, 1993; Manton, Stallard, & Singer,\ndid not explicitly deal with cross-cohort variation, because the\nlongitudinal follow-up to make meaningful cross-cohort\ncomparisons. In general, those longitudinal results did point\nto morbidity compression occurring in the U.S. elderly\npopulation--a conclusion also strongly suggested by long-\nNLTCS (Manton et al., 2006b). Selected studies showed\nincreases in ALE in other countries (Robine et al., 2003). For\nexample, in a 15-year study of morbidity compression,\nmorbidity expansion, and dynamic equilibrium in New\nZealand, the evidence supported the more general dynamic\nequilibrium model (Graham, Blakely, Davis, Sporle, & Pearce,\nevidence suggesting the potential for significant future\nmorbidity compression.\nindividual mortality experience to 2006) here to estimate\ncohort-specific changes in ALE and LE to determine whether\npart of the decline in chronic disability prevalence (Manton &\ncohort differences as opposed to period effects due to, for\nexample, revisions of Medicare benefits. This makes the\nlinkage of NLTCS to individual continuous-time Medicare\nexpenditure and service use records important, both method-\nologically (e.g., the exact dates of death to be used in the\nALE calculations at advanced ages taken from Medicare\nrecords are believed to be more accurate than the ages of\ndeath from death certificates; Kestenbaum, 1992; Manton &\nGu, 2007) and because Medicare records (e.g., International\nClassification of Diseases\u00ad9 diagnoses) contain significant\nadditional health and health service use information recorded\non a continuous-time basis to supplement the NLTCS\nhealth data and to explicate the relation of changes in\nMedicare and Medicaid use to ALE changes. For example,\nMedicare records contain the exact dates of use of skilled\nnursing facilities. Dates of diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease\nand other dementing illnesses have been recorded in detail\nMany benefit changes occurred in the Medicare and\na Medicare prospective payment system was introduced to\nreimburse acute hospital stays; in 1989, Medicare regulations\nregarding home health and skilled nursing facility use were\nrelaxed (e.g., Duggan v. Brown, 1988). In the Balanced Budget\nMedicare reimbursement of home health agency and skilled\nnursing facility benefits (e.g., a skilled nursing facility\nprospective payment system was instituted that emphasized\nthe provision of rehabilitation services based on Resource\nUtilization Groups, Version 3). In 2003, the Medicare\nModernization Act was passed, which set the stage for\npayment for performance provisions and Medicare Part D--\npayment for outpatient drug use. Because these benefit changes\ntarget groups with different health states, the model must be\ncapable of describing temporal interactions in its dynamic\ncomponents.\nAdditionally, many health improvements occurred due to\nperiod-specific public health interventions (e.g., the health\neffects of reductions in smoking, initially stimulated by the\nattributed much of the recent decline in chronic disability to\nthe diffusion of medical advances in the treatment of major\ncirculatory diseases. Lichtenberg (2007) suggested that\nadvances in chemotherapy have contributed to recent (e.g.,\npost-1990) declines in cancer mortality.\nBy determining cross-cohort differences in the disability and\nmortality dynamics used to calculate ALE, experts can use\nthose differences in parameters to improve long-range forecasts\nand projections and to better identify shift points in the\nprocesses. By assessing cohort-specific contributions to dis-\nability, researchers will have a stronger empirical base on which\nto examine the health mechanisms associated with recent U.S.\ndisability declines and to improve intervention strategies\nDATA\nThe NLTCS is a large, nationally representative longitudinal\nsurvey started in 1982. It was conducted again 2 years later in\ntwo stages. In 1982, a sample large enough to identify about\nscreened. In subsequent survey years, the sample was\nmaintained at roughly 20,000 persons. In later NLTCS, only\npersons in the sample who had not previously expressed\nchronic disability, or who were newly sampled, were screened.\nAll persons who had evidenced chronic disability in a prior\nNLTCS, or who were in institutional residence, were\nautomatically ``screened in'' at all subsequent waves starting\nin 1984; hence, both positive and negative changes in disability\ncan be assessed. For all persons identified as chronically\ndisabled, and for persons identified as being in a special\nnondisabled sample drawn from persons who screened out as\na detailed community residential or institutional interview was\nconducted.\nIn each NLTCS from 1984 on, a supplementary sample was\ndrawn of Medicare enrollees who had passed age 65 and\nbecome Medicare-eligible since the prior NLTCS. This\n69 roughly maintained the cross-sectional sample size of about\n20,000 persons in the next NLTCS by ``replacing'' the loss of\na similar number of deaths at all ages occurring since the prior\nwave. This also ensured that the entire Medicare elderly (65\u00fe)\npopulation was represented in each NLTCS. Starting in 1994,\noversamples of persons aged 95\u00fe were drawn (i.e., N \u00bc 540 in\nprecision of disability and mortality estimates at extreme ages\nfor which there were relatively few data on health transitions\nand individual mortality risks but for which chronic disability\nchanges may play an important role in long-term (75-year)\nforecasts of Medicare and Medicaid expenditures (Manton,\nThe NLTCS screener and community interview sections on\ndisability measures and health conditions have been preserved\nsample structure of the NLTCS has been maintained (i.e., the\nprimary sampling units defined for the Current Population\nSurvey were used for all NLTCS). For those 173 primary\nsampling units, a list sample of elderly Medicare enrollees\nwas drawn. Thus, 100% of persons drawn for any NLTCS\nare linked to a continuous-time history of Medicare costs\nand service use and, since 1991, International Classification\nof Diseases\u00ad9 diagnoses on both Part A and Part B.\nScreener response rates remained high (\u00fe95%) across all\nto 91% due to difficulty tracking persons aged 65 to 74 with\nlow levels of Medicare service use. To deal with possible\nresponse rate bias in longitudinal disability rate estimates, the\nMedicare service use and expenditure files, which are available\nfor 100% of the NLTCS sample (both respondents and non-\nrespondents) in all waves, were used to adjust for temporally\nemergent bias in disability prevalence rate estimates. The\ncorrelation of the increased 2004 nonresponse rate with\nMedicare service use in 2004 is informative about the direction\nof age-specific bias in disability prevalence estimates and can\nbe used to reduce such bias. The Medicare service use and cost\ndata adjustments were applied not only in 2004, but to all prior\nwaves of the survey to consistently adjust for bias in disability\nrate estimates over time (Manton, et al., 2006a). We computed\nthe weights used for this analysis with the adjusted data.\nMETHODS\nThe NLTCS makes 27 measures of impairment in ADLs\n(Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, & Jaffe, 1963), IADLs\n(Lawton & Brody, 1969), physical performance measures\n(Nagi, 1976), and sensory function (vision). For each ADL and\nIADL, a battery of ancillary traits is assessed. To track changes\nin these measures, we used a multivariate procedure to identify\nthe K disability dimensions represented by those 27 variables\n2004). This procedure reduces the effects of measurement error\nby using the correlations (redundancy) of a relatively large\nnumber of measures (dimensions) to define a smaller number of\nmore reliable dimensions.\nWe did this by using grade of membership (GoM)\nStallard, & Woodbury, 1991; Manton, Woodbury, & Tolley,\n(i.e., scores constrained to the range of 0\u00ad1 and to sum to 1 for\neach person) were estimated for each of the K dimensions\n(profiles or pure types) underlying the 27 measures. The\nlongitudinal (for the six NLTCS) GoM model equations (i.e.,\nthe cross-temporal measurement models) are as follows:\nProb\u00f0xij\n\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc l\u00de \u00bc\nX\nK\n\u00f0gik\n\u00f0t\u00de \u00c1 kkjl\nwhere \u00c6K\ngik\n(t) 1 at each measurement\ntime t (t \u00bc 1, . . ., 6), \u00c6Lj\nkkjl\n\u00f0\u00c1\u00de \u00bc 1 over all times of measure-\nment, and xij\n(t)is the observed response vector.\n(\u00c1)] set of\ndisability dimensions was estimated using data from all six\nNLTCS, within which the cross-time variation of the vector of\nK functional scores g\n~i\n(t) for individuals was tracked (Abonyi,\nBabuska, & Szeifert, 2001). The number of dimensions, K, was\ndetermined by examining the difference in the likelihood\nTable 1.

Their estimation\nwas by Bayesian techniques; ours was by a frequency\napproach. As they stated, ours is a continuous mixture rather\nthan a discrete mixture model. Because class membership in\nour model is permitted to be partial, it is more parsimonious.\nTable 2.

One is\nresidence type, where a person can be a resident in a group\ndwelling. The second variable describes the disability state of\nthe person. Thus, a resident of an assisted living facility (ALF;\nwhich emerged in large numbers in 1999) can be (a) in an\nindependent living situation and not disabled, (b) in an\nindependent living situation and disabled, (c) in a nursing\nhome bed (i.e., with health care available on a 24-hr basis). In\nTable 1 we present the distribution of the population in these\nThe proportion of people in ALFs in nursing home beds\ntroduction of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997). It grew\nmillion cases). The proportion of ALF cases in nursing home\nof care in ALFs was increasing. Thus, the definition of the\n(nursing home bed) institutional population defined for Type 7,\nby using two traits, was adjusted to reflect the rapid growth of\nThe substance of the six community disability dimensions is\ndescribed by comparing values of the kkjl\nrelative to the cross-\nNLTCS average probability for each of the 27 disability\nmeasures (see, e.g., Berkman et al., 1989). In Table 2, estimates\nof kkjl\nare presented for each of six disability profiles, with\na short characterization of each presented as column headings.\nIn Table 2, many of the k coefficients estimated from the 1982\nto 2004 data exactly match the results of the GoM analyses of\nTable 2 we present coefficients (in parentheses) for only those k\nestimates in Manton and Land that are not identical to the 1982\nto 2004 results. There are very few substantial differences,\nemphasizing the temporal stability of the GoM k estimates in\naddition to their dimensional stability. This stability is con-\nsistent with large-scale simulation studies of the ability of GoM\nto accurately extract parametric structures from ``noisy'' high-\ndimensional categorical data (Kovtun, Akushevich, Manton, &\nTolley, 2007). This is likely due to the simple structure\nconstraints (kkjl\nset to convex space boundaries) imposed--\nespecially on the binary ADL and IADL variables.\nPersons exactly like the first disability profile are not\nchronically disabled and have no physical limitations (i.e., the\nkkjl\nin Table 2 indicates not needing help with any ADL or\nIADL and no difficulty with any of the eight physical\nactivities).\nThe second and third disability profiles show little ADL or\nIADL disability but manifest modest amounts of physical\nimpairment. The second profile has slightly less impairment\nthan the third. The fourth profile manifests primarily IADL\nlimitations, showing significant physical impairment only with\nclimbing stairs and holding a 10-lb. package. Profiles 5 and 6\nshow significant ADL impairment in addition to difficulty with\nphysical performance measures (Nagi, 1976), with the sixth\nprofile being the most frail. The sixth profile is the community\ngroup most similar to institutional residents (seventh profile).\nThough each of these profiles is substantively meaningful,\nand can be viewed as quantitatively defined by a profile of\nspecific traits, the estimates of the mixing coefficients, the gik\n,\nTable 3.

Because the gik\ns are bounded by 0 or 1, the disability\nspace defined by the kkjl\ndescribes the boundaries of a convex\nspace as opposed to, for example, a cluster analysis, where the\nkkjl\ns define the centroids of groups with cases being both within\nand external to the space bounded by the centroids. In cluster,\nor latent class, analyses (Lazarsfeld & Henry, 1968), the\nprobabilities of being in a group are based on the distance of the\ncase to the centroid in the J-variable measurement space, where\nthe distances to the centroids on the measurements are normed\nrelative to the dispersion (and correlation) of the variables (e.g.,\nMahalanobis D2 statistic). In GoM, the convexity constraints\nrequire the gik\nto reconstruct the observed traits of the case as\na weighted sum of the profiles defining the convex space\nboundaries. By defining a ``bounding'' convex space, the kkjl\ns\nhave greater stability because a simpler parametric structure\n(more kkjl\ns are 0 or 1) is defined and gik\n(t)s are strictly\nconstrained to the interior of the convex space.\nThe gik\n(t)s, estimated by using maximum likelihood\nprocedures, can be used in extended Fokker-Planck equations\nability dynamic and mortality parameters necessary for cohort\nALE calculations (Manton et al., 1992). The Fokker-Planck\nequation describes changes with time of the population dis-\ntribution of scores on the K disability profiles, where the\ndistribution changes as a function of fixed (e.g., age and elapsed\ntime) and stochastic (e.g., prior disability state and age- and\ndisability-specific mortality) effects. Fuzzy set scores are fre-\nquently used as state variables in nonlinear stochastic process\nmodels in engineering studies of complex, nonlinear systems.\nThe properties of the process in the original measurement\nspace can be shown to be preserved by the ancillary process\ndefined over the reduced dimension, filtered fuzzy state space\nTo estimate the parameters of the Fokker-Planck equation we\nuse a generalization of the likelihood function in Manton and\nStallard (1988) that describes changes over time in the gik\n(t)\nestimated using the GoM model, where changes in the\ndistribution of the gik\n(t) are also caused by systematic mortality\nselection (i.e., the risk of loss of a given case due to mortality is\na systematic function of the gik\n(t), time, and age). The data on\nexact times to death are provided in the linked Medicare\nrecords.\nIn the simplest case (i.e., for a Gaussian Markov process), the\nlikelihood function can be decomposed into three terms that\ncan be independently estimated (i.e., the ``initial'' fuzzy state\ndistribution, the auto-regressive process of the gik\n(t), and\na quadratic mortality function). In the case of a process over the\nconvex space of GoM disability scores, interaction terms must\nbe added to the diffusion term (i.e., the process is no longer\nMarkovian, but is semi-Markovian; Frank, 2005; Manton et al.,\n1992), with the diffusion process no longer Gaussian (i.e., it is\n``anomalous'' with higher order moments and cumulants due to\nTable 5. h Difference Between Disability Dynamic and h Only (Gompertz) Models by Cohort and Gender\nWomen Men\nh Difference Between\nh Difference Between\nTwo Cohorts t\nTable 6.

The hazard matrix, Qm\n,\nreflects the dependence of an individual's mortality risk on the\nseven disability scores evaluated at time m for an individual\nusing Equation 2b. Because the first profile represents healthy\npersons with no disabilities, it can be interpreted as the origin of\nthe K-dimensional disability space in Equations 2b and 3.\nStatistical estimates of the parameters in Equations 2b and 3\n(i.e., Q, D, and \u00c6) were used to calculate disability state-\nspecific life table parameters by successively (for each life table\nage interval) calculating the five equations that define a cohort\nlife table whose parameters are conditioned on disability-\nspecific mortality selection and disability dynamics (Manton\n(m)distributions\ncan be estimated for the total population--or for an individual\nexactly starting in a given disability state at a selected age.\nRESULTS\nTo estimate the cohort model and calculate disability-specific\nlife tables, one must organize the NLTCS and Medicare data on\na cohort basis; Table 3 illustrates this.\nEach row in Table 3 represents a 5-year birth cohort with the\nage of persons in the cohort at each survey. These 5-year\ncohorts can be further aggregated to provide sufficient data for\na cohort to estimate the dynamics and mortality coefficients for\nthe disability\u00admortality process for which we calculated life\ntables. We use the 5-year grouping in Table 3 for convenience\nin presentation. One can see that, by 2004, the N for the group\nanalyses to have better parameter estimates for advanced ages.\nUsing the average experience of all NLTCS cohorts born\nestimates in Table 4 using the life table model with disability\ndynamics and an age-dependent specific hazard function. Those\nestimates were close to the Social Security cohort LE estimated\nthe NLTCS cohort model had an LE of 15.01 years compared\nto 14.91 years for the Social Security life tables. The Social\nSecurity period life table estimate for 1982, as expected, was\nlower (i.e., 14.23 years). Thus, the NLTCS sample and linked\nMedicare mortality data reproduced well official Social\nSecurity Administration survival estimates for both men and\nwomen.\nTo calculate LE for a cohort, one needs estimates of the age-\ndependence parameter, h, and of the disability-dependent\ncohort mortality function, Q. We estimated these parameters\n(see Table 5) by using two different model specifications. First,\nin Table 5 we estimated the value of h with no individual\nTable 7. 2-Year Transition Coefficients (D[24m]) Between\nSeven Profiles Evaluated at Age 75 for\nTwo Male and Female Cohorts\nMen\nWomen\nNote: PT \u00bc pure type.\nvariation in the gik\n(m) represented. This was equivalent to\nestimating a simple Gompertz function. Second, we estimated\na more complex model in which we generated the dynamics of\ndisability by using the transition equations in Equation 2b (i.e.,\nthe representation of disability as a constant [Gompertz\nproportionality] factor was replaced by estimation of a disability\ndynamic hazard matrix where the matrix of risk factor values at\neach age for each individual was generated by a K-dimensional\ndisability dynamic model).\nThe addition of the disability dynamics (the set of K gik\n(m)\nestimated on a monthly basis) in the hazard function reduced\nthe unexplained variation in mortality due to age (h) for women\neffects of disability on the age trajectory of cohort mortality\nwere smaller (1.49 and 1.50) but still highly significant (ts \u00bc\n13.3 and 7.1). Comparisons can be made across cohorts for men\nand women both before and after adjusting for disability\ndynamics. The h differences for both male and female cohorts\nmen) whether disability dynamics were adjusted or not and\nwere both highly significant. This suggests the effects of\ndisability on mortality independent of age are robust (i.e.,\nreductions in h are large because much of the variation due to\nage is accounted for by the dynamics of disability).\nTo describe disability-dependent mortality, it is also\nnecessary to examine the age-independent relation of the\ngik\n(m) to mortality (i.e., the matrix of risk coefficients Q driven\nby disability dynamics). These are in Table 6.\nFor nondisabled men and women (i.e., Type 1, persons with\n1 on the first nondisabled profile), the mortality coefficients\nwere the same for both cohorts (to the number of decimal places\npresented), although the cohort-specific age-dependence pa-\nrameter, h (in Table 5), with disability dynamics was modestly\nincreases faster with age in both cohorts. For disabled women\n(i.e., those with nonzero scores on Profiles 2 to 7), mortality, in\nboth cohorts, was generally lower than for men.\nTo complete the description of the linked (simultaneously\nestimated) disability dynamic mortality processes, we need\nestimates of the dynamic matrix, D (Equation 2b), to produce\ndisability-dependent cohort life tables. In Table 7 are male and\nfemale 2-year (24-month) disability dynamic estimates (matrix\nTable 8. Life Tables for Male and Female Cohorts in 1982 With Age- and Profile-Specific Mean Disability Scores\nAverage gik\n(m)\nMen\nWomen\nNote: Lx \u00bc number living to age x; Ex \u00bc expected life remaining at age x; PT \u00bc pure type; INST \u00bc Institutional.\nequations were evaluated (for numerical convenience) as 2-year\ndisability transition (changes in the K scores) rates from age 75\nto 77. The lower diagonal elements of the matrices represent an\naverage increase in a healthier state (i.e., state with a lower\nindex than the diagonal) at age 77; upper diagonal elements\nrepresent loss of function by age 77.\nThe elements in the upper and lower triangular components\nof the transition matrix can each be summed within cohorts to\nget the net quantitative disability changes for these seven\ndisability profile scores. For the 65- to 74-year-old male cohort,\nthe average score of nondisabled men (Type 1) on the frail\nprofile (Type 6) increased 0.01 in 2 years, whereas the average\nscore of frail men (Type 6) on the nondisabled profile (Type 1)\ncohort, the score for the frail (Type 6) profile increased 0.03,\nwhereas the score of frail men on the nondisabled profile\ncohort, the average score on the frail profile increased 0.02,\nwhereas the ``frail women'' score on the nondisabled profile\nincreased 0.28. The imbalance favoring transitions to less\ndisabled states is, in part, due to the high mortality in the frail\nstates among persons who do not rapidly improve their\ndisability--especially at advanced ages (see Table 6 hazard\ncoefficients).\nThe diagonal values indicate the stability of each person's\nstate-specific score for ages 75 to 77 (e.g., the nondisabled\nyears). This can be compared to the much less stable 0.57 for\nfrail men. For the 75- to 84-year-old male cohort, the score on\nthe frail profile remained 0.58. Nondisabled men maintained an\naverage score of 0.87 over 2 years (i.e., the older cohort had\na smaller [6.5%] chance of retaining good functional capacity).\nFor women, the score on the nondisabled profile was 0.90 for\n2 years, whereas the score for frail women was 0.27.\nPersistence in intermediate disability states was roughly the\nsame for men and women in the 65 to 74 cohort. Men in the age\n75 to 84 cohort had a higher persistence. Said differently,\nfemale disability dynamics in the age 75 to 84 cohort were\ngreater than those for either the male cohort or for the age 65 to\n74 female cohort. In the transition score estimates (the average\nproportion of a specific disability state retained by an\nindividual--not the proportion of individuals in a homogenous\nstate), there is a greater chance of increasing the score on\nnondisabled states and a lower persistence of residence in\ninstitutions, net of mortality.\nWith the disability dynamics (D) and mortality (h and Q)\nparameter estimates we calculated the cohort-specific life tables\nfor men and women in Table 8.\nIn Table 8 we present gender- and cohort-specific life tables,\nstarting at age 75 (in Table 9 the youngest cohort is first\nobserved at age 75 when the oldest cohorts are age 65) with the\naverage gik\n(m) for each of the K profiles. For men the score on\nType 1 was always higher for the youngest cohort. For women\nthe Type 1 score at age 75 was higher for the older cohort and\nthen, at all later ages, was higher for the younger cohort. This is\ndue to the decline in institutional use by women in the younger\ncohort. For Type 6 and Type 7 the youngest cohort had lower\ngik\n(m) scores (less severe disability) than the older cohort--for\nmen and for all women but those aged 75.\nIn Table 9 we present the LE for persons in each of the K\npure types. This differs from Table 8 in that, instead of\npresenting the average gik\n(m) at a specific age, we present the\nintegral of the survival curve in a given pure type K (gik\nfor persons in that disability state for all ages after age X.\nOverall LE after age 75 was roughly three quarters of\na year greater for both the younger male and female cohorts.\nMost of the differences between cohorts result from a longer\nLE for the younger cohort in Type 1 (e.g., 1.03 years for men\nand women).\nA further comparison can be made with the life table\ncalculations by, for the same age, starting the population in\na given type (e.g., Type 1) and seeing how the LE and disability\ndistribution evolves after that age given the interaction over\ntime of age-specific disability dynamics diffusion and system-\natic mortality selection. This reflects a disability state de-\ncomposition of the stochastic interactions of cohort disability\nand mortality dynamics. This is shown in Table 10 for both\nTable 9.

The\ncohort comparisons show that, for men and women who were\ninitially nondisabled, the younger cohort had higher LE and\na greater likelihood of staying nondisabled.\nFor persons starting in Type 7, we found a different pattern in\nTable 11 for men, with the older cohort having a higher\nproportion found in institutions after age 85. The older male\ncohort had a longer LE at age 75, but the younger cohort had\nlonger LE at older ages.\nIn Table 10, the fraction of the younger surviving male\ndependence of disability-specific mortality. For the older\ncohort, the corresponding numbers were both lower (i.e.,\nwomen, the older cohort had a longer LE at age 75 for those\nstarting in Type 7 and a greater likelihood of remaining in Type\n7. This likely reflects changes in the use of nursing homes at\nlater ages due to factors such as the 1997 Balanced Budget Act.\nAs for men, the younger cohort had longer LE past age 80.\nTo visualize the relative age-specific cohort changes in ALE,\ndisabled LE, and total LE, we present in Figures 1, 2, and 3\nchanges in the proportion of life after age X expected to be lived\nin three specific groups of disability states.\nIn Figure 1 (scores are summed) we show how the proportion\nof LE at a specific age that is expected to be ALE (here defined\nas the sum of the Type 1, 2, and 3 disability scores) changes for\npairs of male and female cohorts. For both genders, the\nproportion of LE that is ALE is higher for the younger cohort.\nAlso noticeable is the improvement in the proportion of ALE at\nages 85 and older. This implies that there is (a) more morbidity\ncompression in the younger cohort with (b) a higher rate of\nmorbidity compression occurring at advanced ages in the\nyounger cohort. Thus, this model does not require assuming the\nproportionality of either age- or cohort-specific mortality rates.\nThis is a very important result in evaluating the continuation of\nchronic disability declines over the long run.\nIn Figure 2 we present the age-specific proportion of LE\nexpected to be lived in intermediate disability states (Types 4\nand 5). For both younger male and female cohorts, this declines\nafter age 85. There is a greater tendency to enter extreme\ndisability states in the younger cohorts. This implies that the\ndynamics of disability are changing in a fundamental way, with\na greater ability for rehabilitation of functional loss in persons\nTable 10. Life Tables (Starting in PT1 at Age 75) for Two Male and Female Cohorts\nMen\nWomen\nNote: Lx \u00bc number living to age x; Ex \u00bc expected life remaining at age x; PT \u00bc pure type; INST \u00bc institutional.\nwith many chronic diseases. This dynamic is operating more\nvigorously at later ages, suggesting increased capacity for\nreducing prevalence within the age ranges currently well\nmonitored. The older male cohort does not exhibit this\nbehavior.\nIn Figure 3 we examine how much of LE at a given age is\nspent in highly impaired states (Types 6 and 7). This declines\ndramatically for the younger female cohort.\nThese statistics can be used to determine if morbidity\ncompression is manifesting itself across cohorts--and across\nage within cohorts. We examine these statistics in Table 12.\nMorbidity compression is occurring across cohorts for males\nand females at both ages 75 and 85. Morbidity compression is\nevidenced by a ratio less than 1.0, is occurring across cohorts\nfor both male and females, and is occurring more rapidly at\nlater ages. The faster decline in morbidity compression at late\nages is also surprising, given that other authors argued that most\ndisability declines were at lower levels of impairment (IADLs).\nThe model can detect these nonlinear changes because it can\nmonitor the interaction of disability-specific mortality and\nnonlinear (convexly constrained) disability dynamics.\nDISCUSSION\nALE measures based on the Sullivan (1971) method are\nuseful in examining how health and function change in relation\nto LE in a population. In Manton and colleagues (2006b), we\nmade to 2080. To examine disability trajectories for individuals\nin specific birth cohorts, however, requires different computa-\ntions. In those calculations, birth cohorts are defined and\ndisability transitions are estimated simultaneously with age-\ndependent mortality functions for individuals. With a cohort\nmodel, it is possible to determine which biological and\nsocioeconomic mechanisms may be involved in forming\ntrajectories by relating the disability score distribution in\ncohorts to other covariates for individuals (e.g., biomarkers,\nMen\nWomen\nNote: Lx \u00bc number living to age x; Ex \u00bc expected life remaining at age x; PT \u00bc pure type; INST \u00bc institutional.\nFigure 1. Percent active life expectancy (ALE) age distributions by\ncohort group.\neducation, and income; Manton & Gu, 2007). It is then possible\nto discuss which factors covary with disability over time. This\nalso provides the necessary elements for examining the\nbehavior of the more general dynamic equilibrium models of\nWe found several consistent findings in our cohort analyses.\nFirst, it is clear, for both men and women, that the younger\ncohort has greater longevity and can expect a greater proportion\nof the life span to be spent in a nondisabled state. Second, the\nlongevity cohort difference is on the order of 0.7 to 1.0 years--\neven when the effects of cohort differences in disability\ndynamics are taken into account. Third, the shape of the within-\ncohort hazard function differs between cohorts. Thus, there\nappears to be a particular dynamic equilibrium across these two\ncohorts where ALE increases faster than morbidity dependence,\nwith the rate of improvement declining (faster) at higher levels\nof disability and at later ages. Though the 24 years of observa-\ntion is limited in making cohort comparisons over broad elderly\nage groups, there is sufficient information to suggest strong\ncohort effects being manifest in this model of dynamic\nequilibrium. Roughly 10 years of additional cohort follow-up\nwould be necessary to evaluate arguments that increased\nobesity prevalence in World War II baby boom cohorts could\nreverse the disability declines of the past 24 years. Such cohort\nstudies will be crucial to understanding what the aging of baby\nboom cohorts will do to the long-term fiscal stability of the\nMedicare and Medicaid systems due to cohort changes in health\nand function (Manton, Lamb, et al., 2007).\n"
