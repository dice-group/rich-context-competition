Although reports of\nthese trends have painted an increasingly optimistic picture\nof health at older ages, research also demonstrates that not\nall older adults are postponing significant morbidity and\ndisability. Indeed, people with lower socioeconomic status\n(SES) have worse health in all adult age groups, including\nat older ages (House et al., 1994; House, Lantz, & Herd,\n2005). Research reports and media attention that summa-\nrize only overall or mean trends in improved health among\nolder adults mask important SES disparities in health that\npersist at older ages.\nAlthough research has documented socioeconomic\ndisparities in various measures of morbidity and mortal-\nity, there has been little attention paid to the socioeco-\nnomic stratification of health-related quality of life\n(HRQoL). However, \"preference-based\" HRQoL mea-\nsures are increasingly used in both clinical studies and\ncost-effectiveness studies, nationally and internationally,\nthough they have only recently appeared in population-\nbased studies that examine health disparities in the\nUnited States (Fryback et al., 2007). Preference-based\nHRQoL measures were originally created to measure\noverall health states and were weighted by an average com-\nmunity or societal valuation of how good or bad it would\nbe to have given health states. If there is great socioeco-\nnomic stratification in HRQoL, as there is with other\nmeasures of morbidity and mortality, it would suggest\nthat future research on HRQoL in clinical, cost-effec-\ntiveness, and population studies should attend to not only\nexamining mean levels of HRQoL but also disparities in\nThe current study uses a recent, large national data set to\ndescribe how SES is related to HRQoL and how this rela-\ntionship varies by age among U.S. adults.

We examine whether multiple health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures are stratified by socioeco-\nnomic status (SES) and age in the United States.\nMethods. Data are from the 2005/2006 National Health Measurement Study, a telephone survey of a nationally repre-\nsentative sample of U.S. adults. We plot mean HRQoL scores by SES within age groups. Regression analyses test whether\neducation, income, and assets each have independent associations with three \"preference-based\" HRQoL measures and\nself-rated health (SRH). We test whether these associations vary by age.\nResults. There are SES disparities in HRQoL and SRH among adults in the United States at all age groups. Income\ndifferentials in HRQoL are strong across current adult age cohorts, except the 75\u00ad89 age cohort. Education and assets\nhave statistically significant but weaker associations with HRQoL. All three SES measures are associated with SRH (net\nof each other) at every age group. Those in the lowest income and education groups in the 35\u00ad44 age cohort have worse\nHRQoL and SRH than those in higher SES groups in the 65+ age cohort.\nDiscussion. Significant improvements in HRQoL at the population level will only be possible if we improve the\nHRQoL of people at the lowest end of the socioeconomic distribution.\nKey Words: Health disparities--Health-related quality of life--Health status--Socioeconomic status.\nseparately and simultaneously. Third, we include three\npreference-based HRQoL measures, along with the\ncommonly used self-rated health (SRH) item, to examine\nsimilarities and differences in patterns of stratification\nacross these measures.\nBackground\nStratification of Health by SES and Age\nOur research is informed by social stratification and life\ncourse theories. One contemporary social stratification the-\nory, the \"fundamental cause theory\" (Link & Phelan, 1995),\naims to address why there are strong, consistent associa-\ntions between SES and health in the United States (Adler &\nRehkopf, 2008), why these associations persist across time\nand measure, and why these associations persist despite at-\ntempts to improve health in the United States. Fundamental\ncause theory suggests that SES shapes exposures to a vari-\nety of psychosocial and material conditions that more\ndirectly impact health (House et al., 2005; Link & Phelan).\nThis theory emphasizes, however, that SES-related re-\nsources, such as knowledge, money, power, and prestige,\nare flexible resources that allow people to avoid risks and\nadopt protective strategies no matter which psychosocial\nand material risk and protective factors are closely aligned\nwith health at a given time (House et al., 2005; Link &\nPhelan). Therefore, addressing the particular risk and pro-\ntective factors that currently link SES to health will not\neliminate the association between SES and health because\nthose at the top of the socioeconomic hierarchy will find\nnew ways to use their flexible resources to gain advantages\nthat result in better relative health status.\nLife course theories have been combined with social strat-\nification theories in a variety of ways to conceptualize how\nrelationships between SES and health vary, change, and ac-\ncumulate over time. Cumulative advantage/disadvantage hy-\npotheses would predict that we should see larger SES\ndisparities in health at older than at younger ages. Consistent\nwith a fundamental cause theory, this hypothesis suggests\nthat experiences of advantage/disadvantage shape both short-\nand long-term health, and the accumulation of advantage/\ndisadvantage over the life course ultimately leads to increas-\ning heterogeneity at older ages (Dannefer, 2003; Hatch,\nIn contrast, the \"age-as-leveler\" hypothesis suggests that\nthe relationship between SES and health should look smaller\nat older ages. This hypothesis reflects a number of both\ntheoretically and methodologically based ideas. From a\ntheoretical standpoint, House and colleagues (1994) de-\nscribe a theory of social stratification of aging and health\nthat posits that social and biological factors affect both ex-\nposure to and impact of material and psychosocial condi-\ntions over the life course. Consistent with a fundamental\ncause theory, socioeconomic differences in exposure to risk\nfactors may increase through adulthood and accumulate to\naffect health particularly through middle and older ages.\nHowever, in later older ages, biological frailty may become\nstrong enough to level the playing field. Age-associated bio-\nlogical frailty may make older adults particularly vulnerable\nto exposure to risk factors, reducing socioeconomic differ-\nentiation in health in later old age. Data consistent with the\nage-as-leveler hypothesis show that SES disparities in health\nare smallest at younger ages, widest at middle and early\nolder ages, and smaller again at later old ages in national\nsurveys conducted in the mid 1980s (Deaton & Paxson,\nIn a recent study, Dupre (2007) combined the cumulative\nadvantage/disadvantage hypothesis and the age-as-leveler\nhypothesis, suggesting that they are not contradictory. Al-\nthough cumulative advantage/disadvantage processes on an\nindividual level produce disparate onset and survival over\ntime, this individual process ultimately results in aggregate-\nlevel findings of smaller SES disparities in health at later\nold ages. Accumulated disadvantage over the life course\nproduces selective mortality, leaving many robust low SES\nsurvivors in the population at later old ages. The age-as-\nleveler phenomenon also may be partly due to improved\nsocial, economic, and health policies at older ages that buf-\nfer the effects of low SES on health (House et al., 2005).\nMoreover, methodological explanations may contribute to\nthe age-as-leveler phenomenon because of weak measure-\nment of SES and health (Robert & House, 1996) or the ex-\nclusion of nursing home residents from surveys, which\nessentially exclude the sickest and lowest SES older adults.\nUnderstanding the relationships between SES and health\nover the life course is further complicated by the fact that\ndifferent dimensions of SES are theorized to affect health in\nboth overlapping and separate ways and at different points in\nthe life course (Luo & Waite, 2005). In adulthood, one's own\neducation and income are theorized to have both joint and\nseparate effects on health. Although one of the pathways\nlinking education to health is through its impact on income,\neducation also has independent effects on health through\nshaping knowledge of health behaviors, sense of control, and\ngreater preferences for health (Grossman, 1972; Ross & Wu,\n1996). Education may be most important in affecting the on-\nset of disease and disability (Herd, Goesling, & House, 2007;\nHouse et al., 2005; Melzer, Izmirlian, Leveille, & Guralnik,\naffect the progression of disease (Feinglass et al., 2007; Herd\nMost U.S. research examines income and education as\nseparate measures of SES but does not address wealth\n(Pollack et al., 2007), despite the potential importance of\nevidence that it may be strongly associated with health\namong older adults (Robert & House, 1996). Indeed,\nwealth may be a good marker for cumulative advantage\nover the life course. People making it into older age with\nhigh levels of wealth likely had (a) a trajectory of financial\naccumulation positively associated with health throughout\nadulthood and (b) no major health or economic shock that\nsignificantly depleted assets (Kim & Lee, 2006; Lee &\nThe current study describes associations among multiple\nmeasures of SES and HRQoL and examines how these rela-\ntionships vary by age group in the United States. From a fun-\ndamental causes perspective, we expect to see that multiple\nmeasures of SES are associated with HRQoL, just as they\nhave been shown to be associated with unidimensional mea-\nsures of health. We also expect that SES will be associated\nwith HRQoL at all ages but that the size of this association\nmay vary by age. Although we do not have the longitudinal\ndata to test cumulative advantage/disadvantage versus age-\nas-leveler hypotheses, we will examine whether there is more\nsupport for one hypothesis over the other. Prior research has\nnot looked at how preference-based HRQoL measures are\nstratified by both age and SES in the United States, so it is\nimportant to see if these patterns look similar or different\nfrom patterns noted using unidimensional health measures.\nMost of the social gerontology literature, and indeed\nmost of the research on social stratification and health in the\nUnited States more generally, have not used multidimen-\nsional measures of health (Alwin & Wray, 2005), let alone\npreference-based HRQoL measures. Therefore, one goal of\nthis study is to more generally introduce preference-based\nHRQoL measures to a readership that has not extensively\nemployed these measures. We believe that social gerontolo-\ngists need to contribute to important discourse over strengths\nand weaknesses of employing preference-based HRQoL\nmeasures in future clinical, cost-effectiveness, and popula-\ntion-based studies. Therefore, we first provide a general in-\ntroduction to preference-based HRQoL measures before\ndescribing our study.\nBackground of Preference-Based HRQoL Measures\nHealth is a complex concept to define and measure. Al-\nthough there are various separate measures of disease states\nand disability, HRQoL measures were originally established\nto quantify overall health by combining observations of\nvarious domains of health (e.g., pain, physical function, so-\ncial function, and mental health) into one summary index.\nHowever, this is a difficult task, as it is hard to determine\nhow to weight different health domains in relation to each\nother because individuals have different preferences regard-\ning trade-offs among health domains. For example, who\nshould be considered worse off--someone with a functional\ndisability and significant pain or someone with depression\nand inability to perform social roles? Therefore, preference-\nbased HRQoL measures were originally created to go\nbeyond existing HRQoL measures. Preference-based\nHRQoL measures not only capture multiple domains of\nhealth, but also take the next step to combine them in an\nindex that weights more heavily some domains over others,\nas measured by community or societal valuation of health\ndomain trade-offs.\nCreating preference-based HRQoL measures is a three-\ndata are gathered to identify important functional (e.g.,\nphysical function, mobility, social function) and experien-\ntial (e.g., pain) domains and to create categorical scales for\neach domain ranging from extremely bad health to full\nhealth. A specific combination of one level from each mea-\nsured domain defines a health state. The second step is to\ncreate a scoring system for health states such that full or\nperfect health is scored at 1.0, and states judged equivalent\nto being dead are scored at 0.0. This is done by having a\nrepresentative sample of people evaluate and rate a selected\nset of unique health states and then using econometric mod-\nels to derive a scoring function that represents the sample's\naverage valuations of these health states. Once this scoring\nfunction is established, the third step is to collect data from\nindividuals to determine their health states and then to as-\nsign them each a preference-based HRQoL score that\nweights their health states by the scoring function. Prefer-\nence-based HRQoL measures provide a summary score an-\nchored at 0 (as bad as being dead) and 1 (perfect health)\n(Feeny et al.; Fryback et al.).\nOne strength of preference-based HRQoL measures is\nthat they can be used both in clinical studies to track health\noutcomes and in large, population-based surveys to track\ntrends in the HRQoL of populations. This includes the abil-\nity to track not just poor health but exceptionally good health\nas well (Kaplan et al., 2008). Moreover, preference-based\nHRQoL measures are the outcome measure of choice for\ncost-effectiveness analyses in clinical and policy-based studies\n(e.g., McHorney, 1999; Miller, Robinson, & Lawrence,\n2006). Given their increased use, we need to understand\nhow HRQoL varies for subgroups of the population, such as\nby age and SES.\nIn the United States, research has shown that preference-\nbased HRQoL scores are lower in older versus younger age\ngroups (e.g., Hanmer, Lawrence, Anderson, Kaplan, &\nsearch also shows that higher SES is associated with higher\nHRQoL in the United States (Lubetkin et al.). However, we\nknow of no population-based U.S. research that has exam-\nined the stratification of HRQoL by both SES and age. In\none Canadian study, education, income, and occupation\nwere associated with one measure of HRQoL, and this as-\nsociation was larger at late middle ages than at either younger\nor older ages (Roberge, Berthelot, & Wolfson, 1995). We\nextend this work by using a national rather than regional\nsample, a U.S. sample, and multiple measures of HRQoL.\nOur study examines age variations in the relationships\namong multiple measures of SES and three commonly\nused preference-based HRQoL measures: the SF-6D\n(Brazier, Roberts, & Deverill, 2002), the European Qual-\nity of Life (EuroQol) 5-domain survey (EQ-5D) (Johnson,\nHorsman, Furlong, Feeny, & Torrance, 2003). Although\nthe three preference-based HRQoL indexes are each de-\nsigned to measure the value of a given health state, re-\nsearch has found that these measures vary somewhat in\nthe same population (Fryback et al., 2007). Therefore, we\nuse and compare three measures of preference-based\nHRQoL as well as the traditional SRH item (Idler, Rus-\nsell, & Davis, 2000) so that (a) we can examine consis-\ntency of patterns and (b) our results can be compared with\nfuture research using other data sets that may have only\none of these measures.\nStudy Aims\nOur first aim is to examine whether multiple HRQoL\nmeasures are stratified by SES among adults in the United\nStates. We also examine whether the relationship between\nSES and HRQoL varies by measure of SES and whether\nmultiple measures of SES each contribute independently to\nexplaining variation in HRQoL. Our second aim is to exam-\nine whether there are age variations in the relationship be-\ntween SES and HRQoL and whether such patterns are\nconsistent with cumulative advantage/disadvantage versus\nage-as-leveler hypotheses.\nMethods\nData\nData are from the National Health Measurement Study, a\nrandom-digit\u00addial telephone survey of a nationally repre-\nsentative sample of 3,844 noninstitutionalized U.S. adults\nsamples of telephone exchanges with high percentages of Af-\nrican Americans and of people older than 65 years (Fryback\nwas asked early in the survey, followed by randomly or-\ndered questionnaire sets used to compute scores for differ-\nent preference-based HRQoL measures. Sampling weights\nwere computed based on the sample selection algorithm\nand adjusted by poststratification to reflect the targeted 2000\nCensus population by age, gender, and race. We excluded\nfrom analyses 181 respondents (4.7%) reporting their race\nas neither White nor Black (people reporting Hispanic eth-\nnicity were included if their race was reported as White or\nBlack). The weighted results are generalizable to the U.S.\nnoninstitutionalized adult population aged 35\u00ad89 years in\nthe 48 contiguous states for people reporting their race as\nWhite or Black.\nMeasures\neither Caucasian/White (White) or Black/African American\n(Black). Income reflects household income over the previ-\nous year and was grouped into four categories: <$20,000,\nEducation was grouped into four categories: less than high\nschool, high school graduate, some postsecondary educa-\ntion, and a college degree or higher. Our measure of wealth\nis referred to as household assets, measured by asking peo-\nple: \"Suppose you needed money quickly, and you (and\nyour spouse) cashed in all of your checking and savings ac-\ncounts, any stocks and bonds, and real estate other than your\nhome. If you added up what you got, would this be . . . (pro-\nvided dollar ranges)?\" We coded household assets as\nthough this is a crude measure of assets, there are no addi-\ntional wealth variables available, and we argue that having\nsome measure of wealth (or virtual lack of any wealth) is im-\nportant to examine. Similar crude assets measures have dem-\nonstrated associations with health in prior studies (Robert &\nHouse, 1996), but we will be cautious about interpretations\nusing this measure. Table 1 describes the sample and inde-\npendent variables.\nThe EQ-5D is a widely used measure of HRQoL (Kind,\n2007), particularly in Europe, but increasingly in the United\nStates (Johnson et al., 2005). The EQ-5D instrument in-\nvolves five questions about respondent's health today in five\nTable 1.

The SF-6D comes from a subset of\net al., 2002). The SF-6D includes six domains (physical\nfunction, role limitation, social function, pain, mental\nhealth, and vitality), each having between four and six lev-\nels, resulting in a total of 18,000 unique health states. The\nscoring algorithm for the summary score comes from a U.K.\npopulation sample, as distributed by the SF-36v2 vendor,\nThe HUI3 is a preference-based HRQoL measure that\nhas been widely used as an outcome measure in clinical\nstudies and population health surveys and in economic eval-\ninterviewer-administered version involves 40 questions re-\ngarding respondents' health over the last week in eight do-\nmains: vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity,\nemotion, cognition, and pain.

This measure has been in-\ncluded in a number of large national surveys, and despite\nthis question's simplicity, it is usually a robust predictor of\nlater health outcomes (Idler et al., 2000), including disabil-\nity and mortality (Idler & Benyamini, 1997; Idler & Kasl,\n1995; Kaplan, Berthelot, Feeny, McFarland, & Khan,\nAnalyses\nIn order to examine age variations in the relationship be-\ntween SES and HRQoL, we first graphed mean values of\neach of the HRQoL and SRH variables within SES and age\ngroups. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were performed to\ntest SES differences in HRQoL and SRH scores, both for\nthe full sample and within each age group, with no control\nvariables. Analyses were performed using SAS System for\nWindows (Version 9.1) procedures that incorporate survey\nWe conducted multivariate weighted least squares (WLS)\nregressions to examine the associations between each SES\nand HRQoL variable (and SRH), first net of gender, age,\nand race and subsequently net of the other SES variables as\nwell. Partial F-tests were conducted to test whether each\nSES variable significantly explained variation in HRQoL or\nSRH. We also tested age-by-SES interaction terms, added\nto the WLS models that included all the SES variables si-\nmultaneously (testing one interaction at a time).\nThere were missing data on seven items (percent missing\nin parentheses): education (0.5%), income (8.3%), assets\nSRH (0.5%). We therefore conducted multiple imputation,\ncreating five multiply imputed data sets. Results across the\nfive imputed data sets demonstrated little variation. The par-\ntial F-tests and ANOVAs were performed with the first im-\nputed data set. All other analyses were performed by\ncombining all five data sets via PROC MIANALYZE.\nResults\nHRQoL Stratification by SES\nWe first examine whether multiple measures of SES (in-\ncome, education, and assets) are separately and simultane-\nously associated with multiple measures of HRQoL and\nSRH. Table 2 summarizes results of regressing each of the\nthree HRQoL and SRH measures on each of the SES mea-\nsures separately, controlling for age, race, and gender. Table\n2 demonstrates that each measure of SES is associated with\nall HRQoL and SRH measures. At each lower level com-\npared with the highest level of education, income, and as-\nsets, people report worse HRQoL and SRH. Partial F-tests\nconfirm that each SES measure significantly contributes to\nexplaining variance in every HRQoL and SRH measure.\nIn Table 3, we present results of regressing each HRQoL\nand SRH measure on the three SES measures simultane-\nously, controlling for age, race, and gender. Partial F-tests\n(not shown) indicated that each SES variable (each block of\nSES dummy variables) is significantly associated with each\nHRQoL and SRH measure (p<.05), while controlling for\ngender, age, race, and other SES variables. This means that\nalthough some of the coefficients representing pairwise\ncomparisons between the highest versus lower SES groups\nare not statistically significant in Table 3, each overall mea-\nsure of SES does contribute as a whole to HRQoL and SRH,\nnet of other SES variables.\nSummarizing the results from Table 3 by SES measure\nand focusing first on the three preference-based HRQoL\nmeasures, we note that education has statistically signifi-\ncant pairwise comparisons between lower and highest edu-\ncation categories with two of the preference-based HRQoL\nmeasures. In terms of the magnitude of the associations, us-\ning the cutoff of 0.03 as a coefficient size that is commonly\nconsidered substantively important for preference-based\nHRQoL measures (Lubetkin et al., 2005; Sullivan, Law-\nthat education has both statistically significant and substan-\ntively important differences between lowest and highest\neducation categories predicting EQ-5D and HUI3 scores.\nFor example, those with less than a high school education\nthan those with a college degree or greater. Although those\nwith some post\u00adhigh school education have worse EQ-5D\nscores (-0.025) than those with a college degree, this coef-\nficient is statistically significant but not of sufficient magni-\ntude (because the coefficient is <0.03) to be considered\nsubstantively significant.\nIncome consistently shows statistically and substantively\nsignificant associations with all three preference-based\nHRQoL measures. Level of assets has only one substan-\ntively significant association for the SF-6D when compar-\ning respondents with the lowest and highest asset levels.\nAnalyses regarding multicollinearity (not shown) suggest\nthat although the SES measures are related, there is not a\nsubstantial multicollinearity problem with these additive\nanalyses.\nWe cannot directly compare the regression coefficients\nfor SRH (scaled from 1 to 5) with those for the three prefer-\nence-based HRQoL indexes because the scales differ nu-\nmericallyandininterpretation.Thoseinthelowesteducation\ngroup have, on average, a 0.60 worse SRH score (over one\nhalf a category) than those in the highest education group.\nThose in the lowest income group have a 0.64 worse SRH\nscore than those in the highest income group. Finally, those\nwith the lowest asset levels have a 0.35 lower SRH score\nthan those with the highest asset levels.\nAmong the SES variables, income has the strongest and\nmost consistent association with the HRQoL and SRH mea-\nsures. Education makes modest additional contributions to\nexplaining variation in HRQoL, and the assets measure does\nnot consistently contribute much. However, all three SES\nmeasures have independent associations with SRH. In sum,\nthese results demonstrate that all three SES measures have\nindependent associations with both HRQoL and SRH.\nHRQoL Stratification by SES and Age\nOur second aim is to examine whether there are age vari-\nations in the relationship between SES and HRQoL. We be-\ngin by plotting simple means of the three HRQoL and SRH\nmeasures within age groups and by SES categories. Figures\n1\u00ad3 show the unadjusted means of the HRQoL and SRH\nmeasures within age groups and by income, education, and\nassets categories, respectively. The three preference-based\nHRQoL indexes can be compared with each other, as they\nhave similar scales anchored at 0 and 1. Although the SRH\nmeasure is not on the same metric, we can at least observe\nsimilarities and differences in general patterns.\nFigure 1 shows that income is associated with all mea-\nsures of HRQoL and SRH. ANOVAs (not shown) confirm\nthat income has a statistically significant association (p<.05)\nwith all four HRQoL measures within each age group. Peo-\nple in the lowest income group (<$20,000) have worse\nHRQoL than those with greater income at every age group.\nTable 2.

Income disparities appear wider\nfor the HUI3 measure than for either the SF-6D or EQ-5D.\nIncome disparities in SRH appear wide as well. Income dis-\nparities appear widest at ages 45\u00ad54 years, and although\nthey are smaller at ages 75\u00ad89 years, they are still statisti-\ncally significant at this age group. F-tests of age-by-income\ninteractions with no other controls (results not shown) con-\nfirm statistically significant (p<.01) age variations in the\nassociations between income and all three preference-based\nHRQoL and SRH measures.\nFigure 2 shows that education disparities in HRQoL and\nSRH are fairly consistent across age groups (confirmed by\nstatistically nonsignificant [p>.05] age-by-education inter-\nactions).

Of note is that the average HRQoL is\nslightly higher at later old ages than at middle ages for the\ngroups with the lowest income and assets, which we address\nin the Discussion section.\nAs results in Figures 1\u00ad3 do not adjust for other vari-\nables, we also performed WLS regressions including blocks\nof age-by-SES interaction terms to the models in Table 3 to\nexamine whether age-by-SES interactions were statistically\nsignificant once other SES variables were controlled. These\nresults (not shown) confirm that the association between\neducation and HRQoL and SRH does not vary by age group.\nIn addition, income disparities in HRQoL and SRH no lon-\nger vary by age group in multivariate models. There were\nstatistically significant interactions between age and assets\nfor both the SF-6D and HUI3 indicating that having\n<$25,000 in assets is particularly associated with worse\n64 years, net of all other SES variables and race and gender.\nIn additional sensitivity analyses, age-specific analyses\nwere also conducted (not shown) and demonstrated general\nconsistency with the results reported here.\nTable 3.

Income, education, and assets are each associated\nwith multiple preference-based HRQoL measures and SRH,\nwith income being the strongest, most consistent predictor.\nWe also show that although there is some age variation in the\nsize of the relationship between SES and HRQoL, SES dis-\nparities in HRQoL exist at all adult age groups--even at older\nages. In particular, we find that those at the bottom of the\nsocioeconomic distribution (with the lowest income, educa-\ntion, and assets) have much worse HRQoL and SRH than\nthose with higher levels of SES. Indeed, those in the lowest\nincome and education groups currently have worse HRQoL\nat ages 35\u00ad44 years than do those in the current 65+ age co-\nhort in any of the higher income and education groups. Our\nresults of persisting SES disparities at older ages are consis-\ntent with a recent Canadian prospective study that similarly\nfound strong income differences in older adults' ability to\nmaintain exceptional health over a 10-year follow-up period\n(using the HUI3 HRQoL measure) (Kaplan et al., 2008).\nOne of the goals of our research was to introduce several\npreference-based HRQoL measures to the literature on so-\ncioeconomic and age stratification and health. Our results\nare relatively consistent with previous work focusing on age\ndifferences in SES disparities in unidimensional measures\nof health. For example, our results show that income dif-\nferentials in HRQoL and SRH exist at all ages, but the wid-\nest differentials are noted at about ages 45\u00ad54 years and the\nsmallest at later old age. These results are generally consis-\nwho found similar age patterns in the relationship between\nincome and functional health and chronic conditions in a\nnational study in the 1980s. Our multivariate results demon-\nstrated that among all SES variables, income is the strongest\npredictor of HRQoL and SRH, with income strongly associ-\nated with HRQoL and SRH at all ages except at 75\u00ad89\nyears, net of other SES variables.\nOur results indicated that education disparities in HRQoL\nand SRH are fairly constant across all current age cohorts,\nconsistent with research demonstrating that education\nmatters to health throughout the life course (Lynch, 2006),\nincluding at older ages (Martin et al., 2007; Schoeni,\nMartin, Andreski, & Freedman, 2005). However, education\nwas a weaker predictor than income and indeed appeared\nto be particularly weak at later old age (75\u00ad89 years). This\nFigure 1. Income-by-age interactions for each health-related quality of life measure.\nis consistent with research suggesting that education may\nbe more important earlier in life (affecting the onset of\ndisease), whereas income may be more important in later\nlife (affecting the progression of disease) (Herd et al., 2007;\nOur results suggest that asset differentials in HRQoL exist\nnet of other measures of SES for some HRQoL measures,\nparticularly in middle age, consistent with previous research\nfocusing on specific measures of morbidity (Robert &\nHouse, 1996). However, our measure of assets was crude\nand likely underestimated asset effects--further research\nshould employ more detailed measures of wealth.\nOur analyses were cross-sectional, and therefore we did\nnot aim to rigorously test cumulative advantage/disadvantage\nversus age-as-leveler hypotheses. However, our results are\nnot consistent with a cumulative advantage/disadvantage hy-\npothesis. Because the relationship between SES and health is\ngenerally much smaller at older ages in these data, our re-\nsults are more consistent with an age-as-leveler hypothesis.\nIn fact, our bivariate figures showed that those with the low-\nest income and asset levels actually had higher mean\nHRQoL in the later old age cohort than did those in the\nmiddle age cohorts. These results may be due to method-\nological issues (sampling and response bias), or they may\nbe real and due to either age or cohort effects and/or avail-\nability of Medicare-supported health care to those older\nAs this research is based on a community sample, we do\nnot have data on people who are most likely to be the sick-\nest--those in nursing homes or other institutions. Therefore,\nit may be that our sample reflects the hardy survivors who\nlived to older ages who are physically and mentally healthy\nenough to participate in a phone survey. Indeed, Kaplan and\ncolleagues (2008) found that baseline income was strongly\nlinked to maintaining exceptionally good health more than\n10 years among Canadian elders, particularly when these\n\"thrivers\" were compared with older adults who were in\ninstitutions after 10 years. Future U.S. research needs to ex-\namine the health of all older adults, no matter where they\nreside, in order to fully understand age variations in health,\nand particularly if we want to well test cumulative advan-\ntage/disadvantage versus age-as-leveler hypotheses.\nFigure 2. Education-by-age interactions for each health-related quality of life measure.\nWhen comparing the results for the three preference-based\nHRQoL measures with the single SRH measure, we found\nthat SRH appeared most strongly associated with or sensi-\ntive to SES.Whereas the preference-based HRQoL measures\nembody self-reported health status valued using community\npreferences, SRH embodies self-reported health implicitly\nvalued by an individual's own rating. Perhaps lower SES\nindividuals experiencing poor health are more likely to eval-\nuate this health state much lower than the valuation of the\ngeneral public. Our results suggest that this simple SRH\nmeasure remains useful in research aimed at understanding\nSES and health, particularly because it is much easier to\nmeasure than the preference-based HRQoL measures. How-\never, because the preference-based HRQoL measures may\nincreasingly be used in clinical, cost-effectiveness, and\npopulation-based studies, gerontologists should contribute\nto the discourse both over the use of these measures more\ngenerally (whether or when they are appropriate/inappropri-\nate) and about the importance of examining their stratifica-\ntion by SES and age when they are used.\nFor researchers interested primarily in HRQoL, our results\ndemonstrate whether and how social stratification by SES\nand age needs to be considered in future research and pro-\nvides estimates across three common HRQoL measures that\ncan be used for comparative purposes. Comparing the three\npreference-based HRQoL measures, we note larger SES\ndisparities for the HUI3 than for the SF-6D and the EQ-5D\nin both bivariate and multivariate analyses. The HUI3 indi-\ncates much lower levels of HRQoL among those in the low-\nest income group in particular. It might be that the HUI3 is\nmore able to discriminate among severe poor health states,\nas it includes eight attributes with five or six levels each.\nAlternately, it may be that these results reflect the fact that\nthe preference values assigned to the same poor health states\nare given lower value weights in the HUI3. Future research\nshould examine whether the HUI3 indeed captures more nu-\nanced aspects of poor health that are more likely to be seen\namong low SES groups or whether differences in the as-\nsigned preference values are solely responsible for the dif-\nferent results. In any case, researchers with data without\nmultiple measures of HRQoL should be aware that the val-\nues for lower SES groups may differ by HRQoL measure.\nAnother limitation to this study is that we excluded 4.7%\nof respondents reporting their race as neither White nor\nFigure 3. Assets-by-age interactions for each health-related quality of life measure.\nBlack, meaning that our results are generalizable only to\nU.S. community-residing adults who report their race as ei-\nther White or Black. Future research will need to examine\nthe relationship between race and HRQoL more closely, in-\ncluding how it may vary by hard-to-reach racial subgroups\nof the population. Strengths of this study include that we\nuse a recent national study on health among U.S. adults, us-\ning multiple preference-based measures of HRQoL and an\nSRH measure, and examine three SES measures (education,\nincome, and assets). Our results provide an excellent basis\nof comparison for future studies that have more limited data\non either SES or HRQoL measures.\nIn conclusion, given that people in the highest SES groups\nalready have very high HRQoL and SRH in all age groups,\nwe cannot expect overall mean population health to signifi-\ncantly improve in the United States unless it improves for\npeople who currently have the lowest SES levels and the\nlowest HRQoL and SRH. Moreover, although the overall\neconomic status of older adults has improved in recent de-\ncades, it has not improved for all older adults. Our results\nshow that these SES disparities are associated with HRQoL\nand SRH disparities among all adult age groups. Policy and\nprogram efforts to improve population health might most\neffectively focus on those at the bottom of the SES distribu-\ntion. Although this might involve efforts to buffer the health\neffects of having low SES, a fundamental cause theory\nwould suggest that a more efficient policy effort might be to\naddress educational attainment and income and asset secu-\nrity directly rather than to temporarily buffer their effects.\nFunding\nThis study was funded by a grant from the National Institute on Aging\n"
