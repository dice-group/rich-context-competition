Henrich,1 PHD, Kathryn A. Brookmeyer,1 MA, Lydia A. Shrier,2 MD, MPH,\nand Golan Shahar,3 PHD\n1Georgia State University, 2Harvard University, and 3Yale University\nObjective To examine the longitudinal associations between supportive relationships\nwith friends and parents and sexual risk behavior in adolescence based on an ecological\u00ad\ntransactional perspective. Methods Analyses were conducted on 2,652 sexually active\nadolescents from the first two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\n(Add Health). Results African-American adolescents had lower risk for sexual risk behavior.\nSupportive friendships and parent connectedness interacted in predicting decreased likelihood\nof sexual risk behavior. Mother\u00adchild communication about sex contributed to decreased like-\nlihood of sexual risk only for girls. There were also small reciprocal effects of sexual risk behavior\non decreased relationship quality over time. Conclusion To better understand the parents'\nrole in adolescent sexual risk behavior, multiple facets of parenting, the social contexts of\nparenting and adolescents' peers, and the effects of adolescents' behavior on these relationships\nshould be taken into consideration.\nKey words adolescence; friends; HIV/AIDS; parents; sexual risk behavior.\nIn the United States, AIDS is the leading cause of death\nfor adults between the ages of 25 and 44 (Center for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention, 2002). Owing to the long\nincubation period of HIV (Center for Disease Control,\n2001), it is likely that many of these adults were infected\nwith HIV during adolescence. In fact, according to the\nCenter for Disease Control and Prevention (2003a), in\n1999 at least half of all new HIV infections were among\npeople under the age of 25. These alarmingly high rates\nof youth HIV infection are linked to adolescents' engage-\nment in sexual risk behaviors. Of all youth AIDS cases in\nthrough sexual intercourse (Center for Disease Control\nschool students nationwide, 37% reported that neither\nthey nor their partner had used a condom during last\nsexual intercourse (Center for Disease Control and Pre-\nused alcohol or drugs during their last sexual encounter\n(Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2004).\nSince the early 1990s, the Center for Disease Control\nand Prevention (2003a) has documented both racial and\ngender shifts in the populations affected by the HIV epi-\ndemic, and the shifts are most marked among adoles-\ncents. Although females over 25 years of age make up a\nthird of all those infected with HIV, females under 25\nmake up 51% of HIV infections among youth (Center for\nDisease Control and Prevention, 2003b). Additionally,\nAfrican-Americans represent more than half of all new\nHIV infections (Center for Disease Control, 2000). These\nstatistics point to the importance of investigating sexual\nbehaviors associated with risk of acquiring HIV infection\nduring adolescence as well as how best to protect adoles-\ncents from these risk behaviors, especially those groups\nincreasingly affected by the epidemic. Efforts to explicate\nthe processes associated with sexual risk behavior in ado-\nlescence have the ability to affect youth social contexts,\nincrease the visibility of adolescence susceptibility to HIV\ninfection, and inform youth intervention and prevention\nefforts (e.g., Dittus, Miller, Kotchick, & Forehand, 2004).\nAll correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Christopher C. Henrich, Department of Psychology,\nSupportive Relationships and Sexual Risk 287\nThis study, espousing an ecological\u00adtransactional\ntheoretical approach, investigates the role of supportive\nrelationships with parents and friends as potential\nprotective factors against the development of adolescent\nsexual risk behavior. According to this approach,\nunderstanding adolescent behavioral risk and protec-\ntive factors requires the consideration of ecological\neffects, that is the social contexts in which the risk and\nprotection occurs (Bronfenbrenner, 1977; Cicchetti &\nLynch, 1993), as well as transactional effects, that is the\nreciprocal nature of the relationship between adoles-\ncents' behavior and their social contexts (e.g., Cicchetti,\nSameroff, 1995). The ecological/transactional approach\nemphasizes that the most proximal influences, such\nas family and friends, may have the greatest effects\non developmental outcomes (Cicchetti et al., 2000;\nSameroff, 1995). Guided by this approach, researchers\nexamine the ways in which risk and protective factors\ninteract with one another across and within proximal\nsocial contexts and their reciprocal patterns of the\nassociation with adolescent sexual risk behavior over\ntime.\nFindings from previous research demonstrate that\nquality of the parent\u00adchild relationship, parent\u00adchild\ncommunication, and peer support represent interacting\nsocial systems that are related to adolescent sexual risk\nbehavior. The role of support within the family has been\nwidely examined in relation to adolescent sexual risk.\nAdolescents who report higher levels of connectedness\nwith parents have lower rates of unprotected sexual\nintercourse (Crosby et al., 2001; Hutchinson, Jemmott,\nJemmott, Braverman, & Fong, 2003), engage in sexual\nintercourse with fewer partners (Crosby et al., 2001;\nVoisin, 2002) are older at first sexual intercourse (Miller,\nNorton, Fan, & Christopherson, 1998) and make safer\nsexual decisions overall (Perrino, Gonzalez-Soldevilla,\nCommunication with adolescents about sex appears\nto be another important aspect of the parent\u00adchild\nrelationship pertaining to adolescent sexual risk taking\nand is a research area that has received much attention.\nFor example, parent\u00adadolescent communication about\nsex is related to adolescents asking their partners about\nsexually transmitted diseases as well as number of inti-\nmate partners (Hutchinson & Cooney, 1998). Female\nadolescents' decision-making about sex appears to be\nparticularly influenced by parent communication about\nsex (Werner-Wilson, 1998), although less communica-\ntion has been also linked to more conservative female\nattitudes about sex (Somers & Paulson, 2000).\nThe pattern of adolescent risk becomes even more\ncomplex once the effects of the peer group on risk\nbehaviors are considered. Peers become important\nbehavioral referents in adolescence, and much research\nhas documented the similarities in levels of risk behav-\nior within peer groups (e.g., Boyer, Tschann, & Shafer,\n1999; Henrich, Kuperminc, Sack, Blatt, & Leadbeater,\nents and peers are interactively related as demonstrated\nby research findings that adolescents' sexual behaviors are\nmore closely aligned with peer norms if adolescents\nhave not discussed sex or condoms with their parents\nAlthough supportive friendships have been associ-\nated with fewer sexual partners (Rotherbaum-Borus,\nReid, & Rosario, 1994), research on another facet of\nadolescent risk, substance use, suggests that support\nfrom friends may operate differentially depending on\nsocial context. Supportive friendships have been related\nto elevated levels of adolescent substance use, especially\nwhen peers exhibit high levels of substance use (Wills &\nally, supportive friendships were more strongly related to\nhigher levels of substance among adolescents who reported\nlow levels of parent support (Wills & Vaughan, 1989).\nSuch interactions between the parent and peer\ncontexts suggest that examining only one proximal\nsource of supportive relationships may not elucidate the\nwhole story of social influences on adolescent risk behavior.\nExamining the family\u00adpeer mesosystem [i.e., the devel-\nopment of behavior across two or more social contexts\n(Bronfenbrenner & Crouter, 1983)] may be a more\npowerful way to measure supportive relationships' influ-\nences on adolescent risk behavior. It is also important to\ninvestigate the dynamics of social contexts over time to\ntease apart effects of stability and change within the family\u00ad\npeer mesosystem (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 1998). This\nstudy draws on the ecological literature by examining the\ninteractive effects of supportive relationships with par-\nents and friends on sexual risk behavior in adolescence.\nThe transactional perspective emphasizes the influ-\nence that children exert on their social contexts as part\nof the cycle leading to the development of problem\nbehaviors (Sameroff, 1995). For example, children with\nbehavior problems can negatively influence their par-\nents' parenting styles to be more punitive and coercive,\nthus contributing to a vicious cycle of dysfunction\n(Petit, Laird, Dodge, Bates, & Criss, 2001). To our\nknowledge, no one has investigated transactional effects\nof sexual risk behavior in adolescence. However, a key\ncomponent of understanding cycles of risk and protection\n288 Henrich, Brookmeyer, Shrier, and Shahar\nin adolescents' sexual decision-making is to examine\nhow adolescents' sexual risk behavior is associated with\nchange in parent\u00adchild relationship quality. Much of the\nextant research on adolescent sexual risk behavior and\nsocial relationships, although offering promising begin-\nnings, is based on cross-sectional data and cannot reveal\nthe ecological and transactional nature of the develop-\nmental processes through which risk and protective\ninfluences are associated with adolescent risk behaviors\nis a need for more sophisticated methodology utilizing\nlongitudinal modeling of complex multivariate designs\nto allow for the estimation of bidirectional effects\nbetween supportive relationships and adolescents' sexual\nrisk as well as the exploration of interactions between\nstability and change within a mesosystem. Further,\nunderstanding how baseline sexual risk interacts with\nstability and change in the family\u00adpeer mesosystem\nenhances interpretability of the sexual risk outcome as\nbeing either onset of risk behavior, termination of risk\nbehavior, or sustained risk behavior (Joiner, 1994).\nThis study addresses these issues by investigating\nthe potential protective influences of adolescents' sup-\nportive relationships with parents and friends on change\nin sexual risk behavior over time. In addition, the study\nexamines the influence that adolescents engaging in risk\nbehavior may exert on their relationships with parents\nand friends. Longitudinal analyses were conducted by\nusing data from sexually active adolescents who partici-\npated in the first 2 years of the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to address two\nsets of main research questions: First, do differing levels\nof relationship quality (a) within the family\u00adpeer mesos-\nystem and (b) among different facets of the parent\u00adchild\nrelationship interact in their patterns of association with\nsexual risk behavior? Second, with the understanding\nfrom a transactional perspective that adolescents' behav-\nior may have an impact on their social relationships, to\nwhat extent are the study's findings reciprocal in that\nsexual risk behavior has effects on decreased relation-\nship quality? Moderation by gender and race is included\nin the analyses investigating these research questions to\nexplore whether protective processes operate differentially\nfor groups experiencing increased risk for contracting HIV.\nMethod\nParticipants\nData for this study were taken from the first two waves\nof the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\n(Add Health), a study of 20,745 adolescents. This sam-\nple included a nationally representative core sample of\nthe study. Add Health was designed with the under-\nstanding that families, friends, schools, and communi-\nties play important roles in the lives of adolescents. To\nfacilitate such analyses, researchers used a clustered\nsampling design based around 132 schools to recruit the\nnationally representative sample. This sample from 80\nschools and 52 middle schools from the United States\nwas selected with unequal probability of selection.\nIncorporating systematic sampling methods and implicit\nstratification in the Add Health study design ensured\nthis sample was representative of US schools with\nrespect to region of country, urbanicity, school type,\nethnicity, and school size (Bearman, Jones, & Udry, 1997).\nThis study used a subsample of 2,655 adolescents\n(all but three of whom had complete data on all\nmeasures) in the core sample who met the criteria of\n(a) participating in both waves, (b) reporting sexual\nactivity at Wave 1, and (c) being at least 15 years old at\nWave 1 because many sexual questions were asked only\nto participants age 15 and older. The median age of the\nsubsample was 17 years. It was split roughly equally by\ngender (49% female) and 12% of the sample reported\nbeing of Hispanic ethnicity. The sample was 64.1%\nWhite (including Hispanic), 28.1% African-American,\n2.8% Asian, and 4% American Indian.\nMeasures and Procedure\nIn 1995 (Wave 1), adolescents were administered an\nextensive survey during in-home interviews, and their\nparents completed a questionnaire. In 1996 (Wave 2),\nadolescents were administered the in-home survey a sec-\nond time. In the interview, adolescents were asked about\ntheir relationships with family and friends, and they\nwere asked about their participation in an array of sex-\nual risk behaviors. For questions about sensitive and\nillegal behaviors, adolescents directly entered their\nresponses into interviewers' laptops, with the screen facing\naway from the interviewer (Blum, Ireland, & Blum, 2003).\nParent\u00adChild Relationship\nAdd Health includes an 11-item parent connectedness\nscale (Sieving et al., 2001) for which adolescents\nreported on the quality of their relationships with their\nparents and the extent to which their parents care about\nand support them. Sample items include, \"how close do\nyou feel to your mother/father?\" and \"most of the time\nyour mother/father is warm and loving toward you.\"\nAdolescents responded to items on a 5-point scales from\n\"not at all\" to \"very much,\" and from \"strongly disagree\"\nSupportive Relationships and Sexual Risk 289\nto \"strongly agree.\" Items were averaged into a scale\nwith good internal consistency,  = .87, in both waves.\nMother\u00adChild Communication About Sex\nreport data available from the first wave of the Add\nHealth study. [The subsample of adolescents with parent\nreport reported higher levels of supportive relationship\nparent questionnaire included six items tapping the\nextent to which parents discussed sex with their ado-\nlescent. Items including talking about birth control, sex,\nthe negative things that would happen if the adolescent\ngot/got somebody pregnant, the dangers of getting a sex-\nually transmitted disease, the negative impact on the\nadolescent's social life from losing the respect of others,\nand the moral issues of not having sex. Parents\nanswered each question on a 4-point scale from 1, \"not\nat all,\" to 4, \"a great deal.\" These items were averaged in\nan internally consistent scale of parent\u00adchild communi-\ncation about sex,  = .89. Ninety-six percent of parents\ncompleting the questionnaire were mothers (91% = bio-\nlogical, step, or foster mothers) or other female caregiv-\ners (4%; e.g., grandmother or aunt). The remaining 4%\nwere fathers or other male relatives. Because of the vast\nmajority of respondents being mothers or other female\ncaregivers, the 4% of male respondents were excluded\nfrom the analyses, and the scale was named mother\u00adchild\ncommunication about sex.\nSupportive Friendships\nAdolescents reported on five items assessing the frequency\nwith which they had spent time, talked, and discussed\ntheir problems with their closest male and female\nfriends. Adolescents indicated whether they had\nengaged in each of these activities with each friend in\nthe past 7 days. Measures derived from these items have\nbeen found to be related to adolescent academic adjust-\nment (Crosnoe & Elder, 2004). When the five items for\nclosest male friend and the five items for closest female\nfriend were averaged (and then multiplied by 5 to be on\nthe same metric as parent connectedness), they formed a\n10-item scale assessing frequency of support from clos-\nest friends with borderline internal consistency ( = .68\nSexual Risk Behavior\nFive behaviors considered sexual risks at each wave of\nmeasurement were summed to form a sexual risk behav-\nior index for each wave. The five risks at Wave 1 were\nnever used a condom (10%), drinking during either first\nor most recent sex (15.5%), using drugs during either\nfirst or most recent sex (7.9%), ever has sex for drugs or\nmoney (2.5%), and early onset of sexual activity [<13\nyears old, 11.6% (age from the Center for Disease\nControl and Prevention's Youth Risk Behavior Survey,\nBrener et al., 2002)]. The five risks at Wave 2 were have\nnot used a condom in past year (4.3%), drinking during\nmost recent sex (10.7%), using drugs during most\nrecent sex (7.4%), sex for drugs or money (3.5%), and\nple reported no sexual risk behaviors, 28.2% reported\none risk, and 8.7% reported multiple risks. At Wave 2,\none risk, and 7.5% reported multiple risks. Because most\nadolescents reported no sexual risk behaviors in both\nwaves and a very few reported multiple risks, sexual risk\nbehavior was treated as a binary variable in the analyses\n(0, \"no risks\"; 1, \"at least one risk\").\nResults\nRepresentativeness of Sample\nInitial analyses were conducted to compare our sample\nof 2,755 adolescents who reported sexual activity with\nall adolescents age 15 years and older in Add Health's\nracial or ethnic differences between the sexually active\nsample and the core sample. Because of differences in\nage, gender, and race, these demographic variables were\ncontrolled for in all analyses. Moderation by gender and\nrace was also included in the analyses (Steinberg &\nDescriptive Statistics\nMeans, standard deviations, and correlations among\nvariables are presented in Table I. Parent connectedness\nand supportive friendships were not correlated with one\nanother at either wave, nor were they correlated across\nwaves. Parent connectedness was negatively correlated\nwith sexual risk at both waves. Supportive friendships at\nWave 2 were slightly negatively correlated with sexual\nrisk at Wave 1. There were also many gender differ-\nences. Girls reported slightly more supportive friend-\nships and less parent connectedness than did boys at\nboth waves of measurement. More boys reported engag-\ning in sexual risk behavior at Wave 1, but there were no\ngender differences in sexual risk at Wave 2. There were\n290 Henrich, Brookmeyer, Shrier, and Shahar\nalso some racial differences. African-American adoles-\ncents in the sample were younger, reported less supportive\nfriendships at both waves of measurement, reported\nhigher levels of parent connectedness at both waves of\nmeasurement, and were less likely to engage in sexual\nrisk behavior at Wave 2.\nRegression Analyses\nHierarchical regression analyses were used to test this\nstudy's ecological and transactional hypothesis. In all\nanalyses, missing data were dealt with through list-wise\ndeletion. The ecological analyses employed logistic\nregression because sexual risk behavior was operational-\nized as a binary outcome. In the first step of these analyses,\nWave 1 sexual risk, age, gender, and a race dummy code\n(1, \"African-American\") were entered. In the second step,\nWave 1 parent connectedness and supportive friendships\nwere entered. Thus, this step represents the traditional\nway to test direct effects in longitudinal analyses (Davis,\n1985). In the third step, Wave 2 parent connectedness\nand supportive friendships were entered. Thus, in this\nstep, Wave 2 supportive relationships can be interpreted\nas change in relationship supportiveness over time,\nwhereas the Wave 1 variables become stable in supportive\nrelationships over time.\nIn subsequent steps, interactions between supportive\nrelationships and baseline risk and among the relation-\nship variables were examined. This comparative analysis\nof interaction effects between two social contexts (par-\nent connectedness and supportive friendships) is an\nestablished way to operationalize Bronfenbrenner's\nconceptualization of the mesosystem (Bronfenbrenner,\nsion of supportive relationship data from both waves of\nmeasurement allows for the assessment of stability\nversus change within the family\u00adpeer mesosystem\n(Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 1998). The fifth step\nincluded the following two\u00adway interactions: Wave 1\nsupportive friendships \u00d7 Wave 1 parent connectedness\n(i.e., mesosytem stability); Wave 2 supportive friendship\n\u00d7 Wave 2 parent connectedness (i.e., mesosytem\nchange); Wave 1 supportive friendship \u00d7 Wave 2 parent\nconnectedness and Wave 1 parent connectedness \u00d7\nWave 2 supportive friendships (i.e., interactions among\nstability and change in the mesosystem); and Wave 1\nsexual risk \u00d7 Wave 1 parent connectedness, Wave 1 sex-\nual risk \u00d7 Wave 2 parent connectedness, Wave 1 sexual\nrisk \u00d7 Wave 1 supportive friendships, and Wave 1 sexual\nrisk \u00d7 Wave 2 supportive friendships [i.e., interactions\nwith baseline risk to clarify the interpretation of the out-\ncome effects (Joiner, 1994)]. In the sixth step, two-way\nsupportive relationships \u00d7 gender and relationships\u00adrace\ninteractions were entered to explore for gender and racial\ndifferences. The final step in the model consisted of two\nthree\u00adway interactions designed to test whether relation-\nship quality in one context further moderated any interac-\ntions between sexual risk at Wave 1 and change over time\nin relationship quality in the other context. These two\ninteractions were sexual risk at Wave 1 \u00d7 supportive\nfriendships at Wave 1 \u00d7 parent connectedness at Wave 2\nand sexual risk at Wave 1 \u00d7 parent connectedness at\nWave 1 \u00d7 supportive friendships at Wave 2.\nTable II summarizes the estimates from the final\nmodel, which includes the interaction terms. In the\npresence of interaction terms, main effects become diffi-\ncult to interpret (Aiken & West, 1991), so in the text,\nthe main effect estimates are presented from the first\nthree steps when they were first entered into the model,\nnoting whether each was maintained in the presence of\nthe subsequently entered interaction terms.\nIn the first step, adolescents who reported sexual\nrisk behavior at Wave 1 had higher odds reporting sex-\nTable I. Correlations Among Measured Variables and Descriptive Statistics (N = 2,652)\nFor gender, male = 0 and female = 1.\nSupportive Relationships and Sexual Risk 291\nhigher odds of reporting sexual risk behavior at Wave 2,\nAmericans had lower odds of reporting sexual risk\nratio = 0.74. There was no main effect of gender. As can\nbe seen in Table II, these effects were maintained in the\nfinal step of the hierarchical regression, which included\ninteraction terms.\nAt initial entry in step 2, adolescents reporting\nhigher levels of parent connectedness at Wave 1 were\nless likely to engage in sexual risk behavior at Wave 2,\nwas no effect of supportive friendships. As can be seen\nin Table II, the main effect of parent connectedness at\nWave 1 was not maintained in the presence of the inter-\naction terms, suggesting that it was conditional upon the\nlevels of other independent variables. At initial entry in\nstep 3, adolescents who reported increased levels of par-\nent connectedness over time were less likely to engage in\nthe main effect of parent connectedness at Wave 1 was\nnot maintained in the presence of the interaction terms,\nsuggesting that its effects were conditional upon the lev-\nels of other independent variables.\nOf the block of two\u00adway interactions between sup-\nportive relations within and across time and between\nWave 1 sexual risk and each supportive relationship, the\nWave 1 supportive friendships \u00d7 Wave 2 parent con-\nnectedness interaction was significant. The results from\nthis step are presented in Table II. None of the gender or\nor either of the two three\u00adway interactions added in step\ntwo steps were deleted from the analyses presented in\nTable II.\nTo probe the two-way Wave 1 supportive friendships \u00d7\nWave 2 parent connectedness interaction, two sets of\nanalyses were conducted. The first examined the effects\nof change in parent connectedness after controlling for\nWave 1 risk, age, gender, and race, separately for adoles-\ncents who reported low versus highly supportive friend-\nships at Wave 1 (based on a median split). Increases in\nparent support at Wave 2 were only associated with\nWave 2 sexual risk for adolescents who also reported\nhighly supportive friendships at Wave 1, B = \u00ad0.45,\nwho reported low supportive friendships at Wave 1,\nthere was no effect of increases in parent support on sex-\nchange in parent connectedness in turn moderated the\neffects of supportive friendships in this interaction,\nresearchers subdivided the sample based on whether\nadolescents reported increased or decreased parent con-\nnectedness over time. There were no effects of Wave 1\nsupportive friendship under either condition.\nParent Connectedness and Mother\u00adChild\nCommunication\nDescriptives\nThe mother\u00adchild communication about sex scale had a\nTable II.

Wave 2 sexual risk was\nregressed on Wave 1 sexual risk, age, gender, and race in\nthe first step. The main effects of Wave 1 parent con-\nnectedness and Wave 1 mother\u00adchild communication\nabout sex were added in the second step. The third step\nincluded the two\u00adway interactions of: parent connected-\nness \u00d7 sexual risk, mother\u00adchild communication \u00d7 sexual\nrisk, and parent connectedness \u00d7 mother\u00adchild commu-\nnication, plus parent connectedness \u00d7 gender, parent\nconnectedness \u00d7 race, mother\u00adchild communication \u00d7\ngender, and mother\u00adchild communication \u00d7 race. The\nfinal step included a three\u00adway interaction between\nsexual risk behavior, parent connectedness, and\nmother\u00adchild communication. In this set of analyses,\nonly Wave 1 predictors were considered because par-\nent\u00adchild communication was not assessed in Wave 2 of\nAdd Health. As with the previous set of regressions,\nestimates from the final step are presented in Table III,\nwhereas main effect estimates from step of initial entry\nare presented in the text.\nThere were no initial main effects of parent connect-\nwas no interaction between the two variables (Table III).\nHowever, there were interactions of each of the parent\nvariables with gender (Table III). To probe these gender\ninteractions, analyses were run separately for boys and\ngirls. Among girls, both parent connectedness and\nmother\u00adchild communication at Wave 1 were associated\nwith reduced odds of sexual risk behavior at Wave 2 (for\nther parent variable was associated with Wave 2 sexual\ncommunication). None of the other two\u00adway interaction\nterms was significant. The three\u00adway interaction was\nnot included in Table III.\nExamination of Transactional Effects\nThe final set of analyses tested the extent to which the\nlongitudinal associations between supportive relation-\nships and sexual risk behavior were reciprocal such that\nsexual risk behavior has effects on decreased relation-\nship quality. Hierarchical linear regressions were con-\nducted in which each social relationship variable at\nWave 2 (parent connectedness and supportive friend-\nships) was regressed on its Wave 1 levels, age, gender,\nrace, and Wave 1 sexual risk in the first step. Wave 2\nsexual risk was entered in the second step. The third\nstep included two\u00adway interactions: Wave 1 sexual risk \u00d7\nWave 1 relationship and Wave 2 sexual risk \u00d7 Wave 1\nrelationship, plus exploratory interactions of gender and\nTable III.

Additionally, African-American\nadolescents reported a statistically significant decrease\nIn step 2, sexual risk at Wave 2 had a negative effect on\nWave 2 parent connectedness, above and beyond the\neffects of sexual risk at Wave 1 (Table IV). There was no\neffect of sexual risk at Wave 2 on supportive friendships.\nThere were no interactive effects of sexual risk on parent\nnot included in Table IV.\nDiscussion\nThis study examined protective processes associated\nwith sexual risk behavior within the family\u00adpeer mesos-\nystem and over time transactionally. Our findings\nunderscore one of the ecological perspective's main\ntenets, which is that in psychological research, interac-\ntions are often more telling than are main effects\n(Bronfenbrenner, 1977). Findings revealed interactions\nwithin the family\u00adpeer mesosystem as well as transac-\ntional effects of sexual risk on levels of supportive rela-\ntionships, suggesting that supportive relationships and\nsexual risk behavior in adolescence are dynamically\ninterwoven.\nParent connectedness and supportive friendships\ninteracted to predict reduced likelihood of sexual risk\nbehavior. Increased parent connectedness over the\ncourse of the study was only associated with low sexual\nrisk for adolescents who also reported stable, highly\nsupportive friendships over the two waves. For these\nadolescents, increases in parent connectedness were\nassociated with a sizable decrease in the odds of adoles-\ncents engaging in sexual risk behavior over time. Thus,\nalthough supportive friendships had no main effects on\nsexual risk, they assisted in decreasing risk by enhancing\nthe protective effects of increased parent connectedness.\nThis finding adds to other recent research documenting\nthe importance of supportive relationships within the\nfamily\u00adpeer mesosystem as protective factors for adoles-\ncent adjustment (Crosnoe & Elder, 2004; Scholte, van\nLieshout, & van Aken, 2001). Additionally, in the sub-\nsample with mother-report data, girls with high initial\nlevels of both parent connectedness and mother\u00adchild\ncommunication were less likely to engage in sexual risk\nbehavior over time. These effects did not hold for boys.\nHowever, these gender differences may be because the\nsubsample was limited to parent-report data, suggesting\nthat, in those households, mothers may have been the\nprimary caregivers. Previous literature has found that\nmother\u00addaughter communication around sexual prac-\ntices is linked to females' safer sexual decision-making\n(Werner-Wilson, 1998), including greater lifetime\ncondom use (Miller, Levin, Whitaker, & Xu, 1998).\nImplications of these findings are that parents play\nan important role in whether their adolescents engage in\nsexual risk behavior (Dittus et al., 2004), but that to\nfully understand this role, multiple facets of parenting\nand the social contexts of parenting in conjunction with\ngender and adolescents' peers must be taken into con-\nsideration. Further, the association between sexual risk\nbehavior and supportive relationships in adolescence\nhas transactional elements. Adolescents who reported\nengaging in sexual risk behavior at the onset of the study\nreported small decreases in the quality of their relation-\nships with parents and friends over the course of the\nTable IV.

This finding is consistent with Action Theory for-\nmulations (Brandtstadter & Lerner, 1999), as well as\nempirical research (e.g., Lopez & Little, 1996; Shahar,\nHenrich, Blatt, Ryan, & Little, 2003) indicating that\nchildren and adolescents can play a role in generating\nthe very social conditions that play a role in their\nadverse developmental outcomes.\nAnother implication of this study is that the interac-\ntive effects of parent connectedness and supportive\nfriendships appeared to be equally useful for both the\nprevention and reduction of risk. Additionally, no mod-\neration by race was found for the effects of parents and\nfriends. Further, the African-American adolescents in\nthe sample reported higher feelings of parental connect-\nedness (although lower levels of supportive friendships)\nand were at lower risk of engagement in sexual risk\nbehavior. So, even though African-American adolescents\nwere more likely to report being sexually active, they\nwere also more likely to engage in safe sexual practices.\nThe transactional model (Sameroff, 1995) further\nelucidates numerous points of intervention within the\nparent\u00adchild relationship to reduce sexual risk. For\noptimal effectiveness, interventions should take into\naccount children's effects on parents, as well as parents'\neffects on their children. For example, an intervention\ncan directly target remediation efforts at adolescent\nbehavior (e.g., sexual risk taking) and parental interpre-\ntations of this behavior (e.g., that the adolescent is a\n\"bad kid\" because his/her behavior defies parental val-\nues) in addition to parents' behavior itself. Such multifo-\ncused interventions may have more power to reduce\nadolescent sexual risk behavior.\nAlthough our findings underscore the importance of\ntaking an ecological\u00adtransactional approach in studying\nsupportive relationships and sexual risk behavior in\nadolescence, they only begin to illuminate the full power\nof such an approach. From an ecological standpoint, a\nhost of other contexts, including socioeconomic status,\nneighborhood collective efficacy, school outreach, and\ncommunity health policies, could potentially interact\nwith the effects of parents and peers in relation to ado-\nlescent sexual risk and are the focus of continuing\nresearch. Further, because AIDS is a worldwide pandemic,\ncultural and policy level influences [i.e., Bronfenbrenner's\n(1977) macrosystem] may also be critical in understand-\ning how families can help prevent sexual risk behavior\namong adolescents.\nThe study's ability to make conclusions about the\ntransactional nature of causality is limited by its correla-\ntional design and two time points of measurement.\nMultiple waves of measurement are necessary to more\ncompletely and reliably characterize transactional develop-\ngiven the cross-sectional nature of much of the extant lit-\nerature in the field, this study's longitudinal design repre-\nsents an important step toward more fully transactional\nmodels. Another avenue for future research is an increased\nunderstanding of the mechanisms through which support-\nive relationships are associated with reduced sexual risk.\nPossible mediators include adolescent attitudes, self-\nesteem, and education pertaining to sex as well as their\ngeneral psychosocial adjustment (Dittus et al., 2004).\nFinally, our conclusions are tempered by limitations\nin the Add Health measures. All constructs in this study,\nexcept gender and parent\u00adchild communication, are\nadolescent self-report, which can be biased on items\npertaining to sensitive and illegal behavior, in spite of\nthe privacy precautions taken by interviewers. Also, the\nparent and friendship questions in Add Health are not\nbased on established measures, to our knowledge. How-\never, they have been validated in prior research with the\nFurther, most parent respondents were mothers, so it\nwas not possible to compare the gender differences\nfound pertaining to mother\u00adchild communication with\nthose of father\u00adchild communication about sex, which\nmay be more important for boys and is another potential\navenue for further research.\nDespite these limitations, this study demonstrates\nhow supportive parenting and supportive friendships\ncan interact to prevent and mitigate adolescent sexual\nrisk behavior. HIV infection is a widespread, persistent,\nand deadly threat to the health of youths and adults\nworldwide. Continuing basic and applied research draw-\ning from theoretical approaches that appreciate the com-\nplexities of human development is imperative to stem\nyouth contraction of HIV/AIDS.\n"
