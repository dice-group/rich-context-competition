An additional 8 million Americans reported\nhaving been told twice by a health professional that they have\nHBP, but their BP was 140/90 mm Hg at the NHANES III\nexamination.2\u00ad4 This subgroup, termed \"twice told,\" in-\ncreased the hypertension prevalence estimate to 50 million\nmillion among US adults.4 There were an additional 6 million\npersons twice told, yielding a total estimate of 65 million\nSince the 1960s, national examination surveys (including\nNHANES) conducted by the National Center for Health\nStatistics have been the principal means to track progress in\npreventing, treating, and controlling hypertension and have\nbeen benchmarks for the National High Blood Pressure\nEducation Program and related health objectives for the\nnation.5,6 These data have generally indicated favorable\ntrends, ie, improvements in hypertension prevalence, aware-\nness, treatment, and control rates.

A\nrecent publication by Gu et al10 investigated data through\n2004 but was focused primarily on hypertension treatment\npatterns. This current report adds to these previous findings\nto trends in prevalence; trends in awareness, treatment, and\ncontrol; evaluation of the role of changes in body mass index\n(BMI) in the changes in hypertension prevalence; and anal-\nysis of changes in the mean values and distributions of BP\nvalues.\nMethods\nData from the NHANES are used to assess the health and nutritional\nstatus of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. A nation-\nally representative sample is obtained using a complex, stratified,\nmultistage probability cluster sampling design. Selected subpopula-\ntions are oversampled, thereby providing a larger subsample size to\nyield more reliable estimates for these groups. The data used in this\n2004. Informed consent was obtained from all of the participants,\nand the protocol was approved by the institutional review board of\nthe National Center for Health Statistics.\nNHANES data were collected through a standardized household\ninterview with additional interviewing and a physical examination in\na mobile examination center. Respondents who were pregnant or for\nwhom no BP data were available were excluded from the analysis.\nBecause of coding changes, pregnant women could not be excluded\nthis has an insignificant effect and would alter the prevalence of\nhypertension by approximately one tenth of a percent. In both\nsurveys, the protocol called for 3 BP measurements at the mobile\nexamination center by a physician using a mercury sphygmoma-\nnometer after a 5-minute rest. For NHANES III, 99% of the study\nrespondents for NHANES III and 14 430 respondents for NHANES\nNHANES methodology and BP measurement is available\nRespondents were defined as having hypertension if their average\nsystolic BP was 140 mm Hg, their average diastolic BP was\n90 mm Hg, or they reported current use of antihypertensive\nmedication. Awareness was defined as hypertensive respondents\nhaving been told at least once by a health professional that they had\nhypertension. Hypertensive adults were included in the treatment\ncategory if they reported the use of a prescribed medicine for\nhypertension. Among hypertensive persons, control was defined as a\nsystolic BP 140 mm Hg and a diastolic BP 90 mm Hg.\nBMI was defined as measured weight in kilograms divided by\nsquared height in meters. There were 3 BMI categories: under-\nkg/m2; and obese, 30 kg/m2. Respondents were grouped into 6 age\nof age. Respondents were categorized into 4 racial/ethnic groups\naccording to self-reported race and ethnicity: non-Hispanic white\n(NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB), Mexican American (MA), and\nother. Because the \"other racial/ethnic\" category is a diverse group,\nseparate results for this group are not shown.\nSAS for Windows14 (SAS Institute, Inc) and SUDAAN15 (Re-\nsearch Triangle Institute) were used for data management and\nstatistical analysis. All of the estimates were weighted according to\nthe inverse probability of being sampled for the examination.\nSampling weights provided with the data were also adjusted for\nperson-level nonresponse and a poststratification adjustment to the\nestimated US population.16 Age standardization was done using the\nComparisons of the differences in means and percentages between\nthe 2 surveys were performed using linear contrasts in the SUDAAN\ndescript procedure. Differences between surveys for population\ndistributions among BP categories as defined in the Seventh Report\nof the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evalua-\ntion, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure were evaluated using 2\ntests. P values 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To\nexamine the effect of BMI on the trends in hypertension, logistic\nregression models were examined within each racial/ethnic gender\nsubgroup. Each model included age as a continuous variable and the\nical variable. Two sets of models were compared, first without and\nthen with BMI (as a continuous variable). Adjusted odds ratios were\ncalculated using the logistic procedure in SUDAAN. Odds ratios of\nwhich the 95% CI did not include unity were considered significant.\nResults\nage-standardized prevalence rate of hypertension increased\n(Table 1). Although there were increases in age-standardized\nprevalence rates in all of the racial/ethnic-by-gender sub-\ngroups, increases were greater for women, and the changes in\nNHW and MA men were not statistically significant. Non-\nHispanic white and black women experienced absolute in-\ncreases of 5%. These represent relative increases of 24% in\nNHW women and 14% in NHB women. The absolute\nincreases in NHW and NHB men and MA women were\nTable 1.

Similarly, in both NHB men\nand women, age-specific prevalence rates increased the most\nin those 60 years of age. In general, age-specific prevalence\nrates did not increase significantly in MA men and women.\nIt is important to evaluate the relationship of increased\nhypertension prevalence rates to the increasing prevalence of\noverweight/obesity in the US population. The Figure presents\nage-standardized prevalence rates by racial/ethnic gender\nsubgroups within categories of BMI for the 2 time periods.\nAlthough the statistically significant increases between the 2\ntime periods are predominantly among women with BMI 30\nkg/m2, there is an observed increase within every BMI strata for\nall 3 of the racial/ethnic subgroups of women and NHB men.\nAlthough the Figure shows a graphical representation of\nthe changes in hypertension prevalence after stratification for\nlevels of BMI, an evaluation using statistical modeling is\npresented in Table 2. A comparison is made of the relative\nincrease in hypertension between the 2 periods, first adjusting\nfor age, which is analogous to comparing age-standardized\nprevalence rates in Table 1. Note that the age-adjusted ratios\nin Tables 1 and 2 are not exactly the same, because they\nperform age-adjustment using different methodology, and\nTable 2 shows odds ratios and Table 1 shows a ratio of\nprevalence rates. Table 1 also shows the relative increase\nbetween the 2 periods modeled as if there had been no\nincrease in BMI (ie, adjusted for both age and BMI). The\nrelative increase is measured by an odds ratio, because the\nlogistic model is used. For men, the relative increase (odds\nratio) in the recent NHANES compared with the earlier was\nAfter adjustment for BMI, there was no statistically signifi-\nrespectively, for the same groups), indicating that the increase\nin BMI accounted for nearly all of the increase in hyperten-\nsion in men. For women, there were much larger relative\nincreases in the prevalence of hypertension in the recent\nwomen, respectively). However, equivalent to results from\nthe Figure, after adjustment for BMI there continued to be\nlarge relative increases in the prevalence of hypertension\nthe increases in hypertension in women were attributable to\nfactors other than their increases in BMI in the recent\nNHANES period.\nNon Hispanic White Non Hispanic Black Mexican American\nPrevalence (%)\nA\nNon Hispanic White Non Hispanic Black Mexican Americans\nPrevalence (%)\nB\nFigure.

This distribution change did not occur\nin the MA group. The distribution change also did not occur\nin those in the top 2 BMI categories but did occur in the\nlowest BMI group.\nTable 4 indicates that, overall, there has been some\nimprovement in awareness of hypertension, from 68.5% to\n71.8%. However, this is most clear in NHW men (from 63%\nto 70%). Overall, awareness in NHB persons has increased as\nwell, from 71% to 76% between the 2 time periods, mainly\namong the middle-aged group. Awareness rates have not\nimproved for MA or NHW women and remain only 45% in\nTreatment rates tended to improve in all of the race-gender\nsubgroups, significantly in NHW and NHB men (P0.001\nfor each) and in NHB women (P0.05), although only\napproximately half as much as in NHB men. Increases in\nmen, except NHW men, were largest in the middle-aged\ngroup, whereas improvements in women were largest over\nage 70 years. MA men continued to have the lowest treatment\nrates, 40% overall, and only 25% in young men.\nControl rates improved overall and tended to improve in all\nracial/ethnic-gender groups--more among men than women.\nNHB and NHW men experienced the largest increases\nbetween the 2 time periods, and the highest control rate in\nincrease from 22% to 39%. NHB men experienced a relative\nment in control rates in women overall was not been\nobserved, although middle-aged NHB women and older MA\nwomen experienced clear increases (each 12% absolute\nchange). NHW women had the highest control rate among the\nrience a significant increase. MA men and women continued\nto experience low control rates, especially among young men\nTable 5 presents the net results of the changes in terms of\nmean BP levels. Age-standardized mean systolic BP in-\ncreased in women, by 3 mm Hg overall, whereas there were\nsignificant increases only in nonhypertensive men. In con-\ntrast, age-standardized mean diastolic BPs were lower in men\nin almost all of the subgroups, with an overall decrease of\n3 mm Hg. Mean diastolic BP in women remained essentially\nunchanged between the 2 time periods except in the treated\nhypertension group.\nWhen the definition of hypertension is expanded to ac-\ncount for those persons possibly obtaining BP reduction from\nnonpharmacological means (ie, adding those persons with\nnormal BP but twice told that they have hypertension), the\nage-adjusted prevalence of hypertension becomes 28.8% in\nhigher for each time period than found in Table 1. The crude\nthe components of the definition being 18.8% defined by\nelevated BP, 10.2% defined by control of BP from medica-\ntions, and 3.0% defined by control of BP from other means.\nUsing this expanded definition, of all persons with hyperten-\n(56% by medications and 9% by other means), and 41% had\ntheir HBP under control (32% by medication and 9% by other\nmeans).\nDiscussion\nThis article updates hypertension-related trends using recent\nNHANES data for the adult US population. The major\nobservations are as follows: (1) age-standardized hyperten-\nsion prevalence rates are increasing in general, and there is no\nsubgroup in which they are declining, suggesting that pre-\nvention efforts have not been strongly successful; (2) part but\nnot all of the increase in prevalence can be explained by\nincreasing overweight/obesity; (3) awareness, treatment, and\ncontrol rates continue to improve, so that they are higher than\never reported; (4) among untreated persons, there is a de-\ncrease in the proportion with normal BPs and an increase in\nthe prehypertension category; (5) among each race/ethnic\ngroup, 1 of the foregoing trends are more favorable in men\nthan in women, and the differentials are particularly striking\namong NHW persons; and (6) although there have been\napparent gains in treatment and control among MA persons,\ntheir rates (including awareness) remain substantially lower\nthan for other race/ethnic groups.\nSex and Adjustment Factors\nAdjusted Odds Ratio (95% CI)\nMen\nWomen\nLogistic regression model has age and BMI as continuous independent variables; survey (NHANES III vs 1999\u00ad2004\nNHANES) as a binary independent variable; and hypertension as a binary dependent variable.\nhttp://hyper.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nHow to directly measure interventions to prevent chronic\ndiseases continues to be difficult.18 Effective prevention of the\ndevelopment of hypertension in the US population would be\nevidenced by a left shift in the BP population distribution curve\nover time in nonhypertensive persons.2,5,19\u00ad21 The rising preva-\nlence of adults with excess weight over the study time\nperiod partly explains why prevention of hypertension\namong the US adult population has not improved.22,23 An\nadults are getting heavier.24 The presence of obesity is strongly\nassociated with the development of hypertension.25 The achieve-\nment and maintenance of a more optimal standardized weight\nusing a healthful dietary plan, recommended levels of regular\nphysical activity, and other behavioral approaches are associated\nwith a significant reduction in BP.6,26\nThe presence of a similar positive relationship between\nBMI and hypertension prevalence for each gender/racial/\nethnic subpopulation as observed for both time periods of this\nstudy is consistent with results of other reports.27,28 In the\npresent study, increases in BMI accounted for some but not\nall of the observed increases in hypertension prevalence\namong adults: inclusion of BMI in the logistic regression\nmodel reduced odds ratios associated with the survey period\nby more than half in NHW and NHB men but much less in\nNHW and MA but greater among NHB women than men.29\nTable 3.

Among hypertensive NHB persons, both men\n(by 14%) and women (by 7%) showed significant improve-\nments in treatment rates (33% and 11% in relative terms,\nrespectively). Whether these outcomes reflect the impact of\ngender/racial/ethnic-focused efforts or are the result of other\nfactors remains to be determined.38 Although there was a\nnonsignificant improvement in the treatment and control rates\namong MA men, their very low awareness, treatment, and\ncontrol rates demonstrate the need for and use of additional\nfocused efforts in this subpopulation.39\nThe ultimate clinical practice objective for the manage-\nment of hypertensive individuals and a very important public\nhealth target is the achievement of BP control.40 Estimated\nrelative increase of 34.5% for the overall US adult popula-\ntion. The overall gender difference in improvement of control\nrates over the study period is striking and may represent the\nresults of targeted efforts. The 50% relative improvement in\nthe control rate for MAs was significant and consistent with\nobservations for treatment rates, but the persisting low rates\nunderscore the need for additional attention.\nThe new findings show that men had higher systolic and\ndiastolic BP than women, but the differences were signifi-\nobserved 2-mm Hg increase in mean systolic BP among the\noverall US adult population over the study period is primarily\nattributable to the SBP increase among women. Conversely,\nmean diastolic BP fell by 1 mm Hg overall because of a\nstatistically significant 3-mm Hg decline in men, whereas\nthere was no significant change in women. The basis for the\nmore favorable overall BP trends for men compared with\nwomen may be attributable to the increased percentage who\nare aware, treated, and controlled in men but not in women.\nQualifications and Limitations\nHypertension prevalence rates reported in this study are for\nthe overall nonpregnant, noninstitutionalized, nonmilitary US\npopulation. Accordingly, a potential underestimation bias\nmay exist in view of the fact that a relatively high proportion\nof adults in nursing homes, hospices, chronic disease hospi-\ntals, and other chronic care facilities have hypertension.\nAlthough this effect is offset by exclusion of adults likely to\nhave normal BP (eg, many military personnel), the extent of\nthe offset was not estimated.\nEstimates are provided that both exclude and briefly\ninclude a subpopulation that has been traditionally over-\nlooked: those who were nonhypertensive at the time of the\nsurvey but who have been told at least twice that they have\nhypertension. Exclusion of this subpopulation permits a more\ndirect comparison with previous studies that only evaluated\nadults who were hypertensive by direct measurement or\nreported use of antihypertensive medication. Inclusion of this\nsubpopulation who reported previously confirmed hyperten-\nsion but whose BP was controlled by means other than\nantihypertensive medication (eg, nonpharmacologic therapy\nor diminished left ventricular function) is more representative\nEach data collection period occurred over 6 years. This\napproach ensures a large enough sample size and represents a\nstrength of this study. However, trends occurring within each\n6-year period were not evaluated in these analyses.\nAlthough the sample size for the MA subpopulation was\nsmaller than for the other racial/ethnic groups in NHANES\nIII, it was actually larger than for the NHB subpopulation in\nTable 5.

For example, hypertension\nthat there is still much that needs to be accomplished to\nfurther improve hypertension control rates for the US\nwomen. This is contrary to the Healthy People 2010 objective\nthat set as a goal to reduce the percentage of hypertension to\nan overall age-standardized prevalence in adults of 14%.45\nThe fact that rates are rising in the context of progressive rise\nin age and BMI of the overall population is of particular\nconcern from a public health policy, as well as a medical care\nperspective. There are important unanswered questions about\nwhy the proportion of women with hypertension is rising 2\ntimes faster than for men.\nAlthough important progress continues to be made in the\narea of awareness, treatment, and control, the need continues\nto be high for interventions that will ultimately halt and\nreverse this rising tide of hypertension prevalence. The rapid\nimprovements in BP control in some groups does suggest that\nunder control may have a chance of succeeding, eg, in NHW\nmen. However, the very low control rates in some groups,\nsuch as 21% in MA men, indicate continued critical dispar-\nities in health care access and implementation. A better\nunderstanding of what is impeding further progress in the\ntreatment of hypertension in women, especially NHW\nwomen, is needed. To the extent that it reflects a lack of\nappreciation of the importance of cardiovascular disease in\nwomen, progress may be stimulated by campaigns launched\nsince 2003 by the federal government, voluntary agencies,\nand advocacy groups focusing on raising public and clinician\nawareness regarding the importance of preventing, detecting,\nand treating heart disease in women.\n"
