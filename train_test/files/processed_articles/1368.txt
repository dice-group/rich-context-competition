The number of cases that\nare found in one single study are insufficient to identify and estimate the risks, causal\nfactors and sequelae. One method of studying a large number of cases is to analyze\nreports of cases of awareness that have been published in scientific journals.\nMETHODS: We conducted an electronic search of the literature in the National\nLibrary of Medicine's PubMed database for case reports on \"Awareness\" and\nmanually searched references cited in these reports and in other articles on\nawareness. We used two surgical control groups for comparative purposes. The\nfirst group in a study by Sebel et al. consisted of patients who did not experience\nawareness. The second group, from the 1996 data from the National Survey of\nAmbulatory Surgery included patients who received general anesthesia. We also\nused data from the National Center for Health Statistics to compare weight and\nBody Mass Index.\nRESULTS: We compared the data of 271 cases of awareness with 19,504 patients who\ndid not suffer it. Aware patients were more likely to be females (P  0.05), younger\nreported the awareness episode during the stay in the recovery room. They\nreceived fewer anesthetic drugs (P  0.0001), and were more likely to exhibit\nepisodes of tachycardia and hypertension during surgery (P  0.0001). A much\nlarger percentage of these patients (52%, P  0.0001) voiced postoperative\ncomplaints related to awareness. Inability to move and feelings such as helpless-\nness, sensation of weakness, and hearing noises and voices were related to the\npersistence of complaints such as sleep disturbances and fear about future\npsychological symptoms.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our review suggested light anesthesia and a history of awareness as\nrisk factors. Obesity and avoidance of nitrous oxide use did not seem to increase the\nrisk. Light anesthesia was the most common cause. Our findings suggest preven-\ntive procedures that may lead to a decrease in the incidence of awareness.\nThe term \"awareness\" during anesthesia, as used in\nthe anesthesia literature, implies that during a period\nof intended general anesthesia, the brain is aroused by\nstimuli that are stored in memory for future explicit\nrecall. Patients who experience awareness will recall\nsuch experiences during a state of inadequate anesthe-\nsia.1 Awareness is an uncommon phenomenon, occur-\nring in about 0.1% to 0.2% of cases.2 A recent study,\nusing the data from hospitals' quality improvement\nsystems, reported an incidence of 0.007%.3 Prospective\nstudies have been used to study the incidence of the\nevent. However, the number of cases that are reported\nis insufficient to identify and estimate the risks, causal\nfactors and sequelae, which need to be known in order\nto develop effective preventive measures. In an effort\nto recruit more cases, advertising, referral from other\nphysicians and closed claims analysis have been used.\nMyles et al.4 recruited patients undergoing specific\ntypes of surgery, e.g., cardiac and obstetric, which\nhave an increased incidence of awareness. These\nmethods still do not provide enough cases and lead to\nselection bias, e.g., excessive recruitment of \"com-\nplainers\" and those with financial motives or incen-\ntives and restriction to specific types of surgery and\npatients. For the alleged victims of awareness who are\nidentified by these methods, with the exception of\nthose of the prospective study of Myles et al.,4 remem-\nbering the past is not merely a matter of activating or\nawakening a dormant trace or picture in mind, but\nFrom the Department of Anesthesia, University of Iowa, Iowa\nCity, Iowa.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Mohamed M.\nGhoneim, MD, Department of Anesthesia, University of Iowa\nHospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA 52242.

Biases and suggestive tech-\nniques tilt the balance among these contributors, so\nthat present influences may play a larger role in\ndetermining what is remembered than what actually\nhappened.5\nOne method of studying a large number of aware-\nness cases, much larger than has been done so far, is to\nstudy reports of awareness that have been published\nin scientific journals. Case reports have sometimes had\na greater impact on science and clinical practice than\nmost prospective randomized investigations.6 The re-\nidentified as HM, began the modern study of memory\nstorage by localizing memory to a specific site in the\nbrain and provided the first evidence of implicit\nmemory storage.

The description by Albright9 of cardiac\ndeaths after bupivacaine administration alerted the\nanesthesia community to the dangerous cardiovascu-\nlar toxicity of the drug. There are many other ex-\namples. The American Society of Anesthesiologists\n(ASA) recognized very recently the value of case\nreports and, in March, 2007, opened an electronic\nawareness registry to recruit cases,* with the declared\ngoal of \"gathering detailed and relevant information\nwith the aim of increasing our knowledge about\nintraoperative awareness and its risk factors.\" Our\nreview of published cases shares the same goals.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted an electronic search of the literature\nin the National Library of Medicine's PubMed data-\nbase for case reports on \"Awareness\" and \"Anesthe-\nsia\" for the time period between 1950 (when the first\ncase report was published) through August, 2005. We\nalso manually searched references cited in these re-\nports and in various articles on awareness. All the\nretrieved articles were limited to the English language\nand peer-reviewed publications. We excluded publi-\ncations devoted to pediatric cases, cases in which a\nlarge part of the data that we wanted to collect were\nmissing, cases caused by administration of muscle\nrelaxants in error to an awake patient, cases reporting\nonly out-of-body experiences (a patient sees his or her\nbody from a location outside the physical body),\ndreams and cases which could only be categorized as\npossible as opposed to definite or probable. We col-\nThe data extracted for each case were the article\nauthors' names, title, name of the journal, publication\ndates, age, gender, race, weight, height, Body Mass\nIndex (BMI), ASA classification, history of awareness,\nhistory of drug use, premedication, drugs for induction\nof anesthesia, difficulty and duration of laryngoscopy\nand intubation, drugs for maintenance of anesthesia,\nmonitors used, autonomic changes during anesthesia,\npatient movement, time of awareness, time of report\nof awareness, type of operation, patients' complaints\nand postoperative sequelae, management of the report\nof awareness by the anesthesiologists, and possible\ncause of awareness. The materials for each case were\nsearched by two of the authors (MG and either MH or\nMM) to ensure accuracy of the data summary.\nWe used two surgical control groups for compara-\ntive purposes. The first group consisted of 19,504\npatients who did not experience awareness in the\nstudy by Sebel et al.,2 which investigated the incidence\nof awareness. The data compared for this group\nincluded the patient's age, gender, ASA classification,\npremedication, drugs used for induction and mainte-\nnance of anesthesia, intraoperative hypertension and/or\ntachycardia, type of surgery, and postoperative se-\nquelae. Because these data were recent and the aware-\nness case reports spanned many years, we also used,\nfor comparative purposes, age and gender of patients\nwho received general anesthesia in the 1996 data from\nthe National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery (similar\ndata are not readily available for hospitalized pa-\nfrom the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey of the United States household population.\nFrequency distributions of qualitative characteris-\ntics and means of quantitative characteristics were\nderived from the 271 awareness case reports that were\nidentified. The frequency distribution for each char-\nacteristic was based on all cases that provided\ninformation concerning that characteristic, regardless\nof whether they lacked data concerning other charac-\nteristics. The frequency of missing data for each char-\nacteristic was tabulated separately. 2 tests were used\nto examine associations of complaints during episodes\nof awareness during anesthesia with postoperative\nsequelae. Negative binomial regression was used to\nexamine whether the average numbers of case reports\nper year changed over different time periods. From\nthe fitted model, estimates of the number of cases per\nyear for each time period were obtained and pairwise\nwith each of the earlier time periods were per-\nformed. The level of significance used was   0.05.\nThe analyses were done with SAS 9.1 for Windows\nsoftware.\nNational Center for Health Statistics.

For these comparisons,\nindividuals younger than 20-yr-old were excluded;\nthere were only two such individuals (1%) among\nthe awareness case reports. Data from the National\nSurvey of Ambulatory Surgery and the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey were\ntreated as population values, and, when compared\nwith the awareness case reports, were matched for\ngender when comparing age and for age when com-\nparing gender, weight, and BMI. Raw data were used\nfor the National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery. Pub-\nlished means were used for the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey; separately for men and\nwomen, we obtained population means for weight\nand BMI from this published information by taking\nweighted averages of the means over the different age\ncategories, with the weights corresponding to the\npercent distribution by age of the reported cases of\nawareness. Because of the time frames of these sources\nand the possibility of changes over the years in some\nof the characteristics that were compared, e.g., weight,\nthese comparisons were done both excluding and\nincluding the older awareness case reports, i.e., those\npublished prior to 1984. The results were not mean-\ningfully affected by including the older awareness\ncase reports, so only the comparisons excluding them\nare reported.\nRESULTS\nJournals and Time Periods of Publication\nThe tabulation of percentages of case reports of\nawareness during anesthesia that were published in\ndifferent journals (Table 1) indicates that four journals\n(Anesthesia & Analgesia, Anesthesiology, British Journal of\nAnesthesia, and The Lancet) accounted for about two-\nthirds of the cases. The percentages of case reports\npublished in different time periods from 1950 through\nincrease in case reports since 1990, with more than\n75% of case reports published since then. The average\nnumbers of case reports per year were larger for\ndecades, with significance ranging from P  0.04 to\nExclusions\nWe excluded the characteristics for which more\nthan 60% of the data were missing. These were the\nASA classification of patients (identified only in 31%\nof the reports) and postoperative management (iden-\ntified only in 30% of the reports).\nQuantitative Characteristics\nQuantitative characteristics of patients who experi-\nenced awareness during anesthesia that were exam-\nined were age, weight, and BMI (Table 3). The patients\ndescribed in the awareness case reports were younger\nthan the patients who did not experience awareness in\nthe study of the incidence of awareness during anes-\nthesia by Sebel et al.2 (P  0.001), but did not differ in\nage from the patients in the National Survey of\nAmbulatory Surgery (P  0.69). The patients de-\nscribed in the awareness case reports did not differ in\nweight or BMI from subjects in the National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (P  0.39 or\nlarger). Based on categories of BMI,\u00a7 the percentages\nof patients described in the awareness case reports\nwho were underweight, normal weight, preobese or\nQualitative Characteristics\nThere were also some qualitative characteristics of\npatients and procedures described in the awareness\ncase reports that could be compared to those of\npatients who did not experience awareness in the\nstudy by Sebel et al.2 Table 4 provides information\nabout five such characteristics for which data were\navailable for almost all patients in Sebel et al.'s study.\nFor one of these characteristics, gender, the awareness\ncase reports could also be compared with patients in\nthe National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery.

A good number\nof cases, 37%, were reported after more than a week\npostoperatively.\nComplaints Caused by Awareness and its Sequelae\nTable 6 provides frequencies of complaints and\npostoperative sequelae. Sebel et al.'s2 control pa-\ntients voiced these complaints infrequently (10%),\nwhile a larger percentage of the awareness case\nTable 7 shows significant associations of patients'\ncomplaints during episodes of awareness with se-\nquelae. Inability to move and feelings of helpless-\nness, anxiety, panic, impending death or catastrophe\nwere each associated with four of the five sequelae\nthat were tabulated. Sensation of weakness or pa-\nralysis, noises that were identified, hearing voices\nand other complaints were each associated with one\nof the five sequelae. Pain was not associated with\nany of the sequelae.\nRisk Factors and Causes of Awareness\nA history of awareness was present in 1.6% of cases\nand a difficult and prolonged laryngoscopy and intu-\nbation in 4.5%. The most frequent cause of awareness\nwas overly light anesthesia (Table 8). Increased anes-\nthetic requirement was assigned as the cause when the\nanesthetic was considered as adequate for the patient\nand the surgery and when malfunction or misuse of\nthe anesthetic machine could be excluded.\nDISCUSSION\nThe adoption of randomized controlled designs to\nanswer important questions about awareness is pre-\nvented by its low incidence, ethical concerns about\nexposing patients to potential risk factors, e.g., very\nlight anesthesia and inability to randomize clinical\nsituations and practices, e.g., difficult and prolonged\nlaryngoscopy and intubation (which is often unantici-\npated and has a low rate of occurrence)10 and complete\nmuscle paralysis during maintenance of anesthesia\n(which is undesirable, but may be required by surgical\nconditions). Therefore, a major part of the literature\nconcerning the causative and risk factors, autonomic\nand motor changes during the episodes, the nature of\npatients' complaints in the postoperative period and\nthe sequelae, is derived from anecdotal experiences\nand personal beliefs. We chose to analyze reported\nTable 5.

Winterbot-\nduring which awareness was ignored as far as publi-\ncations were concerned. Then, there followed a pro-\ngressive increase that reached its peak from the 1990s\nonward. This increase may be partly explained by the\ntrend toward publication of multiple reports in a\nsingle article, but equally important is the increased\nprominence of the subject. There is a heightened\ninterest in the subject by anesthesia providers, as\nevidenced by studies of the effect of anesthetics and\nsedative-hypnotics on explicit and implicit memories,\nintroduction of monitors that assess the depth of\nanesthesia, studies of the psychological and medico-\nlegal consequences of awareness, review articles, book\nchapters, and a book. The public news media and\nentertainment industry also became interested in the\nsubject and, through them, the patients.\nFemales were over-represented relative to males in\nthe reported cases of awareness when compared to the\ncontrol sample in Sebel et al.'s study. This is consistent\nwith the results of other studies.11\u00ad14 Women recover\nmore rapidly from anesthesia than men, which may\nsuggest that they may be less sensitive to the effects of\ngested11,17 that there may be a higher incidence of\nawareness in obese patients for several reasons, in-\ncluding the often prolonged time for endotracheal\nintubation, the use of higher concentrations of oxygen\nin nitrous oxide-oxygen mixtures and the difficulty of\ngiving appropriate doses of drugs without causing\npostoperative respiratory depression. Our survey\ndoes not corroborate this supposed risk. The prepon-\nderance of cardiac and obstetric procedures in the\nawareness reports compared to the nonawareness\nsample is to be expected, because of the tendency to\nuse light anesthesia in these cases.11 Our findings\nregarding the time of reporting of awareness corrobo-\nrate the current practice of interviewing patients more\nthan once, including the recovery room.11\nThe anesthetic regimens that were reported in\nawareness cases used less premedicants, induction\nand maintenance anesthetics and less opioids as com-\npared with the control sample.

These signs, as\nwell as the use of smaller amounts of anesthetic drugs\nand their adjuvants, are correlates of overly light\nanesthesia, which was the most common cause of\nawareness. An alternative explanation for the higher\nincidence of hypertension and tachycardia in the\nawareness sample is the attention, over approximately\nthe last decade, to strict control of arterial blood\npressure and heart rate during anesthesia, which\ncould be displayed more in the control sample. There\nwere no differences between the frequency of use of\nnitrous oxide and neuromuscular blockers in the\nawareness and nonawareness samples. There are no\nstudies that rigorously assessed the risk of avoidance\nof nitrous oxide on the incidence of awareness. In a\nmeta-analysis of the effect of omitting nitrous oxide in\ngeneral anesthesia on postoperative emesis,18 an inci-\ndental finding was that omitting nitrous oxide in-\ncreased the incidence of awareness. However, the\nrepresentativeness of this finding is debatable, as only\n29% of the trials that were analyzed included aware-\nness as an outcome measure, the search strategy did\nnot indicate that awareness was intended as an out-\ncome, and the increased incidence of awareness when\nnitrous oxide was omitted was derived in large part\nfrom a single study19 in which the results were not\nsignificant. It was also clear that the total anesthetic\ndose, as defined by minimum alveolar anesthetic\nconcentration multiples, was larger in the group given\nnitrous oxide.\nOur finding of the absence of differences in the use\nof neuromuscular blockers between the experimental\nand control samples is not surprising. It does not\ncontradict the reasoning that awareness is, to a large\ndegree, an iatrogenic mishap caused by the use of\nmuscle relaxants. The use of neuromuscular blockers\nhas been ubiquitous since their introduction in 1942.\nIndeed, the first case report of awareness involved the\nuse of curare.8 As opposed to the paralyzed but\ninadequately anesthetized patient who may regain\nconsciousness while remaining motionless, a nonpara-\nlyzed patient will usually (but not invariably) commu-\nnicate his or her wakefulness by movement, which\nalerts the anesthesia provider to deepen the anesthetic\nand thus lessens the incidence of recall. It is sound\npreventive advice to avoid muscle paralysis unless it\nis needed and even then to avoid total paralysis.\nMany patients who become aware during surgery\nreport a variety of complaints that are associated with\nconsiderable dissatisfaction with their anesthesia\ncare.20 The most common complaint in this study was\nauditory perception (voices in 66% and noises in 17%\nof cases), followed by loss of motor function (inability\nto move in 34%, and sensation of weakness or paraly-\nsis in 17% of cases), pain (38%), and feelings of\nhelplessness, anxiety, panic, impending death or ca-\ntastrophe (34%). In a recent study by Samuelsson et al.,21\nauditory and tactile perceptions were the most com-\nmon (70% and 72% respectively), followed by feelings\nof helplessness, acute fear, and panic (56%, 58%, and\n43% respectively). Pain was experienced by 46% of the\npatients.\nAwareness may lead to postoperative sequelae that\nmay persist for varying durations. Sleep problems\nwere common (sleep disturbances in 19% and night-\nmares in 21% of patients). Fear of future anesthetics\nwas reported in 20% of patients and daytime anxiety\nin 17%. Late psychological symptoms, which may lead\nto a severe and debilitating illness (posttraumatic\nstress disorder), were first described by Meyer and\nour patients. In the Samuelsson et al. study,21 there\nwas a 33% incidence. In our review, inability to move\nand feelings such as helplessness, anxiety and panic\nwere significantly related to the persistence of late\npsychological symptoms. Wang,23 based on his stud-\nies of victims of awareness in his practice, has sug-\ngested that frequently the inability to move during\nsurgery raises the patient's misconception that the\nstate is irreversible, causing acute psychological\ntrauma that may persist if it is not explained. Some\nauthors have expressed their belief (without evidence)\nthat pain would be a precipitating cause of prolonged\npsychological effects.1,24 Yet, pain and hearing voices\nor noises were not related to the late psychological\nsymptoms in our review. These results are also corrobo-\nrated by those of Samuelsson et al.21 and Guerra.25 It is\ninteresting that Blacher26 has claimed earlier that\npatients who are wide awake, although they may\nsuffer greatly during the procedure, may have fewer\ntraumatic symptoms afterward than those who are in\nan obtunded state, perhaps because while awake what\nhappens is not in doubt. Perhaps patients who com-\nplain initially of inability to move and experience\nfeelings of helplessness, anxiety, panic, impending\ndeath or catastrophe should be paid particular atten-\ntion and be referred early for psychiatric help.\nGuerra25 has suggested that the response to awareness\nmay also depend on the patient's personality and\npsychiatric history. Other factors, e.g., failure of the\nsurgery to cure the patient, or the emergence of\nserious postoperative complications, may also play a\nThis review suggested two risk factors for aware-\nness during anesthesia. The first is the use of light\nanesthesia. The second is the presence of a history of\nawareness. The late Professor Utting28 warned anes-\nthesiologists in 1975 that \"a history of awareness\nshould always be treated seriously and the anesthetic\nshould be given with scrupulous care by a consultant\nanesthetist if medico-legal trouble is to be avoided.\" It\nseems that this advice has not always been followed.\nDifficult and prolonged laryngoscopy and intuba-\ntion were associated with awareness in only 4.5% of\nthe cases. Considering that the overall incidence of\nnot found to play a major role as a risk factor.\nAdministration of supplemental doses of induction\nhypnotics should prevent the patients from regaining\nconsciousness when this problem arises.\nThe major cause of awareness was overly light\nanesthesia at the time of the episode. Anesthetic\nmachine malfunction or misuse and increased anesthetic\nrequirement were much less frequent. The end-tidal\nanesthetic gas concentrations that prevent awareness\nare unknown. In a recent study by Avidan et al.,29\nthere were sustained periods during surgery when\nthese concentrations were under 0.7 minimum alveo-\ntheless did not experience awareness. In cases where\nlight anesthesia is deemed necessary, the use of even\nsmall doses of amnesic drugs, e.g., scopolamine, mi-\ndazolam, subanesthetic doses of ketamine, or inhaled\nanesthetics and/or regional anesthesia, should be con-\nsidered.1 The use of a cerebral function monitor may\nreduce the incidence of awareness.3\nProper maintenance of anesthesia equipment,\ncheckout protocols before administration of an anes-\nthetic, gas analyzers sampling the inspired and end-\ntidal concentrations of the inhaled anesthetics, setting\nof alarms when vaporizers become empty and using\ntotal IV anesthesia only when the anesthesia providers\nhave continuous access to the entire anesthetic delivery\nsystem can reduce the incidence of machine malfunc-\ntion or misuse. Variability in response to anesthetics is\ncommon in everyday practice. It is possible that\nchronic use of alcohol, opioids and sedative hypnotics\nmay increase the anesthetic dose needed to produce\nand maintain unconsciousness.1 Unfortunately, there\nwas not enough information in our data about the use\nor abuse of these substances. Increased anesthetic\nrequirement of some patients may be detected by the\nuse of brain function monitoring.\nThe main strength of the present study is the large\nnumber of cases that were reviewed, increasing the\nconfidence in our results and conclusions. However,\nissues relating to bias pose several challenges. Publi-\ncation of case reports depends on voluntary efforts by\nthe authors and acceptance by the editors of scientific\njournals. Another source of bias is the inability to\nprecisely match the reported cases of awareness with\ncontrol groups coming from the same time period.\nAlthough the majority of the cases were published in\nfrom an earlier period. Therefore, comparisons be-\ntween data sets may have been influenced by changes\nover the years in certain characteristics, e.g., obesity of\nthe general population or use of -blockers in the\nperioperative period, which could affect the inci-\ndences of tachycardia and hypertension. Other differ-\nences in characteristics between the reported cases of\nawareness and the patients of Sebel at al.2 may have\ninfluenced the comparisons, and it was not feasible to\ncontrol these, e.g., by analysis of covariance. A third\nsource of bias relates to the lack of data in some\nreports concerning factors such as race, use of recre-\national drugs and others that may be relevant to the\nphenomenon of awareness. The high rates of missing\ndata for some of the characteristics that we examined\nalso limit confidence in the conclusions that can be\nreached concerning these characteristics. We do not\nknow whether the individuals for whom information\nconcerning a characteristic was not reported had the\nsame distribution on that characteristic as the indi-\nviduals for whom information was reported. Al-\nthough we omitted any characteristic with more than\n60% missing data from consideration, our conclusions\nmay be regarded as tentative, pending independent\nconfirmation.\nIn conclusion, we reviewed 271 cases of awareness\nand compared their data with those for patients who\ndid not suffer from awareness. Despite the steady\ndecline in the incidence of awareness since the 1960s\nand 1970s, an opposite trend in the number of reports\nwas found. A preponderance of females was equivo-\ncal, and obesity did not seem to increase the incidence.\nAbout one-quarter of the aware patients received no\nvolatile anesthetic or propofol during maintenance of\nanesthesia and there was less frequent use of premedi-\ncants and induction and maintenance drugs, except\nneuromuscular blockers, in this group. The use of\nnitrous oxide did not make a difference in the inci-\ndence of awareness. There was an over-representation\nof cardiac and obstetric procedures. Patients' move-\nments, tachycardia and hypertension were relatively\ncommon during surgery. Only 35% of patients re-\nported the awareness episode during their stay in the\nrecovery room. The most common complaints of pa-\ntients were auditory perception and loss of motor\npower. Awareness may lead to both immediate and\nlate psychological problems. Inability to move and\nfeelings such as helplessness, anxiety and panic were\nsignificantly related to the persistence of late psycho-\nlogical symptoms. We suggest light anesthesia and a\nhistory of awareness, as risk factors; light anesthesia\nwas the most common cause. We discussed our find-\nings in light of the existing literature and suggest\nmeasures to decrease the incidence.\n"
