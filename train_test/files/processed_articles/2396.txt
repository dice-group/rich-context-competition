Adept PM has been linked to a variety of\npositive behavioral and health outcomes (e.g., see Dishion and\nTipsord 2011). Specific potential benefits of adept monitoring\ninclude lower levels of affiliation with rule-breaking peers\nwell as lower incidence rates and risks of becoming a newly\nincident user of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs (ATOD;\nlower likelihood of progression to heavier drinking or other\nThis well-substantiated knowledge base about adept mon-\nitoring and its positive outcomes already has become a foun-\ndation for randomized clinical intervention and prevention\ntrials intended to strengthen families through parental educa-\ntion.

In this manner, assessment of intervention effects\ncan be fragile when parents fail to attend the sessions as\nplanned. Nonetheless, even with unfaithful attendance, posi-\ntive outcomes have been found (e.g., see Dishion and An-\nthe importance of research on variability of monitoring\nbehaviors and their effectiveness. More evidence is need-\ned to make intervention and prevention efforts more adap-\ntive and customizable to individualized or subgroup-\nspecific needs of families.\nAdolescent Age and Sex Differences in Parental Monitoring\nAdolescent age and sex differences are seen for PM overall,\nand in estimates of PM influence on health behaviors. In\nseveral studies, older adolescents typically are supervised less\nclosely and have more experiences outside the family struc-\nture (Patterson and Stouthamer-Loeber 1984; Larson et al.\n1996), concurrent with increased adolescent autonomy and\nbids for independence (Steinberg 1990), as well as affiliation\nwith norm-violating peers (e.g., see Lloyd and Anthony\n2003). Monitoring older adolescents can also be more chal-\nlenging. This fact might help to increase salience of adolescent\ndisclosure regarding \"where they are going, what they will be\ndoing, and whom they will be with\" (Kerr et al. 2010, p. 39).\nEvidence for variable PM trajectories is clear. In some\nstudies, there is a steady decrease in monitoring over time\nOther studies show relative stability in PM levels during\nmiddle-late childhood and early adolescent years (e.g., see\nEven so, Dishion et al. (2004) draw attention to a possibility\nthat precocious child or adolescent independence or autonomy\nmight be a marker of excess risk of negative behavioral\noutcomes and can disrupt otherwise adept monitoring.\nPerhaps with PM levels or facets as causal determinants,\nmale-female differences also can be seen in various domains\nof adolescent externalizing behavior, conduct problems, and\nother hazard-laden experiences, with greater occurrence\namong males for some of these behaviors and experiences\n(e.g., marijuana smoking, getting into physical fights, and not\nwearing a seat belt in a car driven by someone else), and with\ngreater occurrence among females for other behaviors and\nexperiences (e.g., forced to have sexual intercourse, and riding\nwith a driver who had been drinking alcohol; Eaton et al.\n2006). Nonetheless, in terms of parental monitoring generally,\nprevious findings indicate that PM levels for girls generally\nare higher than PM levels for boys in childhood and during\nadolescence (e.g., see Bumpus et al. 2001; Reboussin and\nAnthony 2003). Variations in monitoring of boys versus girls\nmight be related to a male-female double standard in terms of\nsocietal influences, attitudes, and expectations related to court-\nship and family formation (Axinn et al. 2011). The Axinn\nresearch team offers empirical evidence of a parental \"tenden-\ncy to hold significantly more permissive attitudes toward a\nfuture son's courtship experiences than a future daughter's\ncourtship experiences\" (p. 429).\nInvestigating Specific Facets of Parental Monitoring\nPM has multiple facets, some of which might be anticipated to\nexert differential effects on adolescent behaviors, with poten-\ntial implications for prevention science, along the lines of\nmechanism-informing substudies and micro-trials advocated\nby Howe et al. (2010). These discrete facets include specific\nparent behaviors (e.g., limiting behaviors and soliciting infor-\nmation, and encouraging adolescent disclosure), each of\nwhich might serve as indicators of monitoring, or that might\nhave effects with PM levels held constant. In a recent calibra-\ntion investigation intended to stimulate new prevention re-\nsearch, we investigated the possibility that drug prevention\neffects of specific parenting practices, in the specific form of\nsetting limits on time with friends, might be large enough to\nhave clinical or public health significance. We chose the \"limit\ntime with friends\" (LTF) facet of PM because it represents an\nimportant indicator of parental behavior designed to monitor\nand possibly influence peer relationships and prevent \"hang-\ning out with the wrong crowd\"--that is, LTF might be used to\ncontrol or regulate otherwise unregulated and generally ubiq-\nuitous peer influences. Implications for prevention of health-\nrelated behaviors such as extra-medical use of internationally\nregulated drugs become clear when the issue of limiting time\nwith friends surfaces. One especially robust predictor of ado-\nlescent drug involvement is whether adolescents have friends\nwho are also drug users, and the LTF facet of parenting might\nhave a direct influence on affiliation with drug-using or oth-\nerwise deviant peers (e.g., see Dishion et al. 2004). In theory,\nthe LTF facet of parenting can be quite malleable and amena-\nble to change via brief interventions with parents--perhaps\nmore readily changed than other PM facets, particularly if an\nintervention session is followed by \"boosters\" as might be\nprovided via automated SMS text messaging to a parent's\nmobile phone, a topic to which we will return in this paper's\nDiscussion section.\nThat is, as an attempt to substantiate the potential impact\nand importance of research on the LTF facet of parenting, our\ncalibration investigation sought to learn whether LTF-\nassociated differences in estimated incidence of adolescent\ndrug use might approach the size of observed male-female\nincidence differences--with knowledge that these male-\nfemale differences are considered to be of clinical and public\nhealth significance, sufficient to foster a National Institute on\nPrev Sci\nDrug Abuse initiative on sex and gender differences in drug\ntaking. In our already published work on LTF, we found that\nthe estimated LTF effect on incidence of drug might be\nas large as or larger than recently observed male-female\ndifferences in risk of becoming a drug user (Seedall and\nPurpose of This Study\nBuilding upon these recent findings, we set out to probe the\nLTF facet of PM in an effort to build a stronger empirical\nfoundation for potential future use in a targeted micro-trial or\nother trials of interventions designed to enhance PM. With\nrespect to LTF, we expected no male-female difference in the\nlevel of the LTF facet of parenting in early adolescence, but\nwe thought that the LTF disparity would arise during the\nmiddle years of adolescence, with LTF levels for females\nbecoming larger than those for males in later adolescence,\nwhen courtship and unwanted pregnancies become more sa-\nlient as parenting concerns in relation to daughters relative to\nIn addition, the PM knowledge base requires renewal from\ntime to time due to possible secular or cohort changes in\nparenting practices. As a result, we designed this study to\nprovide an initial exploration, via a novel \"mutoscope\" ap-\nproach as described below, of twenty-first century patterns of\nthe overall PM construct while also working toward our\nprimary aim of seeking information regarding potential age\nand male-female differences in the intensity of the LTF facet\nof monitoring and supervision.\nThis report describes some a priori expectations with\nrespect to our specific interest in the LTF facet of parenting,\nwith overall PM levels as a background issue. As already\nmentioned, we thought that there might be no LTF differences\nin male-female contrasts as childhood ends and adolescence\nbegins (i.e., at age 12 years), with overall PM levels held\nconstant. Thinking developmentally, we expected to see emer-\ngence of a specific male-female LTF difference once issues of\nworry about precocious sexual activity and pregnancy became\nmore salient during the adolescent years, especially by age\n17 years, still with overall PM levels held constant. Concep-\ntual models depicting the main steps in our analysis plan are\ndisplayed in Fig. 1a\u00adc.\nAn important methodological limitation of this exploratory\nstudy, to which we will return in later sections of the paper,\ninvolves measurement equivalence and assumptions that have\nto be made about the metric of the overall PM latent variable.\nUnder the models fit here, for our primary hypothesis about\nthe LTF facet of the PM construct, we use the standard\nregression approach to hold constant overall PM levels while\nestimating this male-female difference in LTF values as ob-\nserved. Because we have 12 subgroups under study (boys and\ngirls in each of six age-year substrata), we have not tried to\nestablish PM measurement equivalence as might allow us to\ndraw more definitive conclusions about how the PM levels\nvary across these subgroups, which would require much larger\nsamples of each age-sex subgroup than are now available. We\ncan offer preliminary estimates for male-female and age dif-\nferences based on an untested assumption about PM measure-\nment equivalence, but our primary focus is on estimation of\nmale-female variation in the LTF facet, which does not require\nmeasurement equivalence for the overall PM construct. Sta-\ntistically informed readers may appreciate the context in rela-\ntion to the concept of statistical power to detect differences.\nOnce we subdivide these samples into age-sex strata, the\nnumber of individual participants in each subgroup stratum\nbecomes so small that there is a quite constrained statistical\npower to detect a departure from measurement equivalence.\nInstead, we estimate the possibility of an LTF difference\nemerging as this nationally representative sample of a birth\ncohort of males and females ages from 12 to 17 years, with\nPM level held constant, and we leave the issue of male-female\ndifferences in PM level as a topic for future and more defin-\nitive research to confirm PM measurement equivalence across\nthe age-sex strata under study.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy Population, Sampling, and Assessment Procedures\n(NSDUH) represent examples of sustained epidemiological\nsurveillance, with non-overlapping samples drawn each year\nfrom national probability sampling frames designed to include\nnon-institutionalized US citizens, age 12 years and older. The\nNSDUH research team takes special care to ensure nationally\nrepresentativeness of the samples via multi-stage area proba-\nbility sampling and recruitment protocols.

A new non-\noverlapping sample of that same original cohort was drawn,\nrecruited, and assessed in exactly the same manner, each year\nPrev Sci\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing\nMale\nLevel of\nMonitoring by\nParents\nCheck homework\nLimit Time with\nFriends\nTV\nChores\nHomework help\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing\nMale\nLevel of\nMonitoring by\nParents\nCheck homework\nLimit Time with\nFriends\nTV\nChores\nHomework help\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing\nMale*\nLevel of\nMonitoring by\nParents\nCheck homework\nLimit Time with\nFriends\nTV\nChores\nHomework help\nMale-female differences at age 12\n**\n*\nNote: The reference category for this\nmodel is 12 year-olds (male and female)\na\nb\nc The original model included calendar year\nterms with no product-terms, as would be the\ncase if a single slope might be sufficient to\nsummarize data on the primary direct path\nthat leads from being male to the `Limit Time\nWith Friends' facet of parental monitoring.\nBut the mutoscope approach disclosed\nevidence that a single slope was not\nsufficient, and this discovery motivated the\ninclusion of all covariate terms shown here.\nFig. 1 a Model to depict\nhypothesized male-female\ndifferences in `limit time with\nfriends' with overall parental\nmonitoring level held constant\nunder the model. b Model to\ndepict hypothesized male-female\ndifferences in `limit time with\nfriends' with overall parental\nmonitoring level and age\nsubgroup membership held\nconstant under the model. c\nModel to depict hypothesized\nmale-female differences in `limit\ntime with friends' with overall\nparental monitoring level held\nconstant under the model, with an\nallowance for male-female\ndifferences to vary across age\nsubgroups\nPrev Sci\nand so on. The intent is for no individual to be assessed more\nthan once (i.e., sampling without replacement). Arising from\nsuccessive nationally representative sample surveys, the large\nnumbers of boys and girls at each age enhance statistically\nprecise and generalizable study estimates.\nTo conceptualize this research approach, consider an anal-\nogy using inventor Herman Casler's early twentieth century\nmutoscope, which involved taking a series of single assess-\nment cross-sectional snapshots of an object in motion, arrang-\ning the snapshots on cards, and then flipping the photos in\nsuccession so that the cascading imagery of cross-sectional\nsnapshots might be converted into a primitive movie of the\nobject in motion (http://www.flipbook.info/viewers.php, last\ninvolves arranging each set of data from each re-sampling of\nthe nationally representative cohort in relation to strata or\nsubgroups defined by the age at assessment, the year of\nassessment, and sex (male vs female). The 12-year-old boys\nin the nationally representative sample of 2004 form one\nstratum and the 12-year-old girls of 2004 form another stratum,\nallowing direct comparison of PM practices, such as the LTF\nfacet. Then, the 13-year-old boys sampled and assessed for the\nfirst time in 2005 provide a snapshot view of PM practices\nwhen that same cohort had passed the 13th birthday, and the\n13-year-old girls sampled and assessed for the first time in\n2005 provide a snapshot view of PM when they had passed the\n13th birthday (i.e., with a new sample of cohort members). The\nremaining strata of boys and girls are formed in a similar\nfashion, age by age, and year by year, through to 2009, when\nThis mutoscope approach to repeated \"panel study\"\ndata yields a trace of cross-sectional single assessment\nsnapshots of a cohort's experience from one age to the\nnext, with each member of the sample assessed once and\nonly once. As such, this research approach to understand-\ning PM stability and change reduces all sample attrition\nproblems faced when trying to track down and re-assess a\ncohort sampled just one time, and also brings potential\nmeasurement reactivity and interdependence to a mini-\nmum (see Anthony 2010). This approach constrains inter-\ndependence of observations in repeated measures re-\nsearch--i.e., interdependence such that an individual's\nmeasured values of PM at time t+1 might be found to\ndepend upon his or her measured values of PM at a prior\ntime t. Overall, this approach creates a novel way to test\ndevelopmental hypotheses about male-female differences\nin PM practices as the cohort makes transitions into and\nthrough the adolescent years, somewhat conceptually sim-\nilar to but fundamentally different from an accelerated\nlongitudinal cohort study design.\nMeasures\nThe multi-module ACASI assessment included five different\nitems pertinent to adept monitoring and supervision by par-\nents, each of which was included in the PM construct used in\nthis study as a discrete categorical indicator variable with four-\npoint Likert scale levels from 1 (never) to 4 (always). These\nitems tapped how often in the past year parents had limited\nparticular strength of these items is that they are all malleable\nand modifiable aspects of parenting, at least theoretically\namenable to parent education and interventions.\nAnalysis Plan\nWe chose to integrate the description of our analysis/\nestimation steps with presentation of results in order to\ndescribe the steps and their results with greater clarity.\nThe analysis/estimation strategy was preceded by Tukey-\nstyle exploratory data analysis (EDA) to illuminate mar-\nginal distributions of these study variables. Model-fitting\nsteps are depicted in cartoon-like Fig. 1a\u00adc, as described\nin the Results section. Anonymous reviewers and the\njournal's methods editorial staff suggested some of the\npost-estimation exploratory data analysis steps described\nbelow.

As outlined recently by Asparouhov and\nMuthen (2009), ESEM allows for greater model flexibility\nthan confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) while it also includes\nmore pre-defined information than exploratory factor analysis\n(EFA). In addition, although the MIMIC model has been most\noften used within item response theory to detect item bias in\nthe form of differential item functioning (DIF), we used it in\nthe context of this study to test our specific substantive hy-\npotheses about selective male-female LTF differences (see\ning within an ESEM framework made it possible for us to\nexplore associations between age, sex, and PM, and also to\nshed light on inter-relationships linking age, sex, and LTF\nwhile holding constant levels of the general PM construct, as\ndescribed in our introductory overview of the research ap-\nproach. In these analyses, the metric of the latent PM construct\nis uncertain, and we do not claim that the metric for boys is\nexactly the same as the metric for girls. In this initial explor-\natory study with the mutoscope approach, we decided not to\nconfirm measurement equivalence for the 12 subgroups under\nstudy (boys vs girls across each of six age-year strata), as\nwould be required to draw more definitive inferences about\nlevels of the latent PM construct. For this reason, our descrip-\ntion of estimates gives emphasis to the slope estimates for the\npaths leading directly toward the LTF indicator, which is\nanchored in the observed item response categories from 1\nto 4 (i.e., not necessarily ordinal, but at least ordered\ncategory values).\nPreliminary Modeling Step 1: Male-Female Differences\nGenerally\nIn an initial estimation step, we fit to the data a parsimonious\nregression model for complex survey sample data that is based\non the possibly over-simplified assumptions that age and year\nmake no difference. The resulting \"common regression slope\"\nestimate of the male-female difference in PM levels borrows\ninformation across all years and age groups. We then elabo-\nrated that model to allow for the possibility of a male-female\ndifference in the LTF facet of monitoring, also summarized in\nthe form of a common regression slope based on all ages and\nall years, and on the over-simplified assumptions. Figure 1a\nshows the conceptual model with the direct effect path from\nthe sex variable to the LTF indicator, as well as the indirect\npath via the PM construct.\nThe parsimonious regression model used to estimate male-\nfemale differences across all years and age groups was based\nupon an assumption that PM and LTF might not vary for males\nand females across year or age group. This model fits the data\n(CI)=0.07; 0.08). A table is not needed to summarize the two\nslope estimates from this model. The primary estimate\ndisclosed similarly robust male-female differences in relation\nto the LTF variable (estimated slope, b=-0.145; standard error,\nlax in their limits set for boys' time with friends, with PM level\nheld constant under this model. The exploratory slope estimate\nof secondary importance indexes possible male-female differ-\nences in PM level, has a positive sign, and is statistically robust\nassumption of measurement equivalence, this secondary slope\nsuggests that parents might be monitoring boys at higher levels\nthan girls across all age cohorts. We will return to this interest-\ning topic in our Discussion section.\nPreliminary Modeling Step 2: Age Differences\nIn the next estimation step, we posited a model that was a\nmore realistic portrayal of our expectations for age-related\nvariations, allowing for the possibility that an age adjustment\nmight lead to a change in the estimated direct path being used\nto estimate male-female differences in the LTF facet of PM.\nThis modeling goal was accomplished by adding dummy-\ncoded variables that represent the cohort as sampled at each\nage (Fig. 1b). For example, the first age variable in the series\nothers coded 0, the second age variable (a5) coded 13-\nand so on.\nWith the model re-specified with these age terms, the fit\n0.053). With PM level held constant under this model, the\nslope to estimate male-female differences in LTF did not\nchange appreciably from the b=-0.145 value found in step\nwas an incrementally positive slope for LTF from the 12-year-\nold cohort sample onward. LTF slope estimates for age co-\nhorts 13\u00ad17 were observed as tangibly larger than values\nobserved for the 12-year-old cohort, but Wald tests of param-\neter constraints designed to test for differences revealed that\nthe incremental differences age by age were not appreciably\nPrev Sci\ndifferent from one another relative to conventional standards\nWith respect to our exploratory estimation of slopes lead-\ning toward the latent PM construct, there was an inverse slope\nestimate year by year, when looking across the samples of the\ncohort, from 12-year-olds sampled in 2004 to counterparts in\nassumption of measurement equivalence, the inverse slopes\nthis assumption, an inverse slope estimate also was seen\nacross the span of time as the 12-year-old cohort observed in\n2004 moved forward across later age and time strata (data not\nshown in a table).\nPrimary Estimation Step: Variations Across Sex-Age\nSubgroups\nIn this primary estimation step, we posited a model that more\ncompletely expressed our expectation that with overall PM\nlevel held constant via the regression model, the parents might\nrelax LTF differentially for boys as we look across the strata\nthis might not be the case for girls. Here, the approach in-\nvolved forming dummy-coded variables with product terms\nfor the sex-age subgroups from age 13 to age 17 (Fig. 1c). The\nresulting model yielded the following model fit statistics: 2\nMost central to our primary hypothesis about male-\nfemale differences in LTF values under this model, there\nwas no male-female difference in the 2004 contrast of\n0.89, upper left cell of Table 3). Even so, as can be seen\nby following the diagonal trace downward and to the\nright, the hypothesized male-female difference in the\nLTF facet of parenting was seen to emerge and to be\nstatistically robust in the other contrasts (i.e., in mid-\nlater adolescence). For each age cohort across the adoles-\ncent age range from 13 to 17 years, boys' time with\nfriends was restricted at lower levels as compared to girls\nof the same age (p<0.05; Table 3 diagonal trace). These\nresults serve as evidentiary support in favor of our prima-\nry LTF-related hypothesis that there might be no differ-\nence in LTF for pre-teen boys versus girls but that LTF\ndifferences might be substantial for the 16- and 17-year-\nolds in this cohort, with PM level held constant under the\nmodel. We also note a similar male-female difference in\nLTF for the 13\u00ad15-year-olds in this cohort.\nSubject to the untested measurement equivalence assump-\ntion, we looked for evidence of systematic variation in overall\nPM levels. Under this model, there was no statistically robust\nTable 2 Estimated differences in the overall level of parental monitoring (PM), contrasting males versus females (highlighted diagonal trace), within-\nmale age differences (upper right cells), and within-female age differences (lower left cells)\nhigher PM levels for boys versus girls, age by age, with age 12 years as an exception (no appreciable male-female difference in PM at age 12 years).

Namely, if\nindeed the measurement metric is equivalent, the ob-\nserved overall parental monitoring levels seem to be\nhigher for boys than for girls from ages 13 to 17 years\n(see Table 2, diagonal trace).\nIf one were to assume PM measurement equivalence across\nall 12 subgroups, the evidence shown in Table 2 (above\ndiagonal trace) would be consistent with generally hypothe-\nsized expectations about age and PM levels. Estimates in the\nabove diagonal (upper right) cells of Table 2 are for boys.\nThese exploratory estimates suggest an age-associated decline\nin overall PM levels for boys contrasted from one age to the\nnext, beginning with contrasts between 13- and 15-year-olds\nmight have increased slightly between the ages of 12 and\n13 years before beginning to decrease. Estimates for girls, as\nshown in the lower left below diagonal cells of Table 2,\ndisclose a roughly similar pattern. To illustrate (again with\nan assumption of measurement equivalence across sub-\ngroups), the girls at age 12 years in 2004 were found to have\nhigher PM levels under this model as compared to girls at each\nolder age. Table 2 (lower left below diagonal) shows evidence\nsuggesting PM levels at statistically significant lower values\nfor girls across the independent samples drawn 1 year after the\np<0.001). If confirmed in future research, these findings\nwould tend to support maturational model, possibly with\ngeneral PM construct levels decreasing over time for boys\nand girls.\nDiscussion\nBrief Summary of Findings\nIn this study, we investigated hypothesized age-specific male-\nfemale differences in the limit time with friends facet of parental\nmonitoring with PM held constant (as measured by the LTF item\nas well as items on limiting time watching television, checking\nhomework, helping with homework, and assigning work or\nchores). Our main hypothesis concerned the LTF facet of the\nPM construct, and the findings confirm our initial expectation of\nTable 3 Estimated differences in the limiting time with friends (LTF)\nfacet of parental monitoring, contrasting males versus females (highlight-\ned diagonal trace), within-male age differences (upper right cells), and\nwithin-female age differences (lower left cells), under the multivariate\nresponse model that holds constant overall level of parental monitoring\nLTF levels for boys versus girls, age by age, with age 12 years as an exception (no appreciable male-female difference in LTF at age 12 years).

The successive cross-\nsectional snapshots from early-late adolescence showed evi-\ndence of more permissive parenting with respect to allowing\nsons to spend time with friends as compared to daughters\nspending time with friends, but not at age 12 years, in models\nholding constant overall PM levels age by age. This evidence,\ncoupled with findings from our previous study that LTF risk\ndifferences for newly incident drug use were at least as large\nas male-female differences in newly incident drug use, may\nhelp support and provide a rationale for a specific focus\non the LTF facet in parenting interventions and in future\ndrug use prevention trials (Seedall and Anthony, 2013).\nIn our more exploratory findings on overall PM levels, we\ndid not place emphasis on the possibility of male-female\ndifferences, due to unresolved measurement equivalence is-\nsues. The evidence is consistent with developmental or\nmaturation-related variations such that the levels of overall\nmonitoring might generally decrease across successive ages,\nfor both males and females in adolescence, but more work on\nthe overall PM measurement equivalence assumption is need-\ned before firm conclusions should be drawn.\nLimitations\nBefore a more detailed discussion of these results and their\nimplications, several of the more important of this study's\nlimitations merit attention. One limitation worth noting is the\nstudy's cross-sectional sample in each year, which provides a\npopulation-averaged snapshot but not a subject-specific view\nof an individual's change over time. It has been necessary to\nuse the population-averaged mutoscope approach and to yoke\nthe successive snapshots in sequence in order to gain a longi-\ntudinal view of the 12-year-old cohort sampled and measured\nIn relation to limitations, we also are reminded of an issue\nraised by Gault-Sherman (2012)--namely, the bidirectionality\nof parent\u00adoffspring relationships that cannot be fully illumi-\nnated in any cross-sectional research project. Nonetheless,\nhere, in this study, we are quite confident that PM and LTF\nvalues have not altered the values of the male-female sex\nvariable, nor the age variable.\nAgainst this background information on limitations, we\nnote that a counterbalanced strength is in these annual surveys\nthat seek nationally representative samples of each age cohort\nunder study in the USA. As a result, although the 12-year-olds\nin the 2004 survey are never re-sampled or re-assessed in\nsuccessive years, each year's sample is nationally representa-\ntive of the nation's children and adolescents, year by year. Via\ninspection of year-to-year progress of each age cohort, it is\npossible to surmount disadvantages faced in longitudinal re-\nsearch, including differentially selective attrition, as well as\npotential reactivity in assessments, both of which sometimes\nlimit interpretation in longitudinal samples (Anthony 2010).\nOf course, despite strengths of this type, we acknowledge that\nevidence from longitudinal research projects provides more\ninformation about within-individual differences, which al-\nways will serve as useful complements to epidemiological\ninvestigations of this type.\nWe also would like to highlight two other issues related to\nthe research approach used in the NSDUH to assess PM. One\naspect of research approach involves an interpretation of what\nis being measured. From one perspective, the important con-\nstructs under study are adept parental monitoring and super-\nvision, and limit setting about time with friends, which are\nbeing measured by what the sons and daughters report. From\nanother perspective, we can view the boys' and girls' re-\nsponses to the survey assessments as a measure of what they\nperceive about how and how well they are being monitored by\nThat is, in this formulation, the construct might be said to\nbe \"perceived level of parental monitoring\" or \"perceived\nLTF,\" as opposed to actual \"levels of PM and LTF.\" We\nsurmise that each reader of this research report might choose\nto adopt one perspective versus another, with corresponding\nconstraints on the interpretation of the findings, and with\nallowance for the possibility that it is the reporting of PM\nand LTF that varies from one age to the next, as opposed to our\nown interpretation that it is the actual PM and LTF values that\nvary from one age to the next. Deliberately designed experi-\nments will be required to tease apart whether the important\nvariables are \"what is perceived,\" versus \"what is disclosed,\"\nversus \"what actually was experienced.\"\nWe also have noted that all of the five PM items used in the\nNSDUH assessment represent parental behaviors than can be\nreadily modified, and this is an important feature of the\nNSDUH assessment from the standpoint of future public\nhealth interventions. Nonetheless, it also is important to ac-\nknowledge that these five items do not necessarily capture all\nfacets of adept parental monitoring. In this regard, we concur\nthat PM might be cast in future research as a multi-\ndimensional construct based upon mutually influencing parent\nand child behaviors, with an allowance that a PM level as\nperceived and reported by a child (or by a parent) might be\ndifferent from a PM level measured via an externally verifi-\nable measurement device (Kerr et al. 2010). Whereas the\npresent nationally representative NSDUH sample survey\nhas remarkable strengths in relation to external generaliz-\nability and the sample space, a research project focused\nmore specifically on parenting of adolescents almost cer-\ntainly would have a more comprehensive PM and LTF\nassessment, making it possible to probe the PM and LTF\nissues in more depth than has been possible in this\nPrev Sci\nnationally representative sample survey context. We ac-\nknowledge that the overall PM levels for girls might be\nfound to be greater than the overall PM levels for boys, if\nthe NSDUH had employed a more comprehensive PM\nsurvey module, and if measurement equivalence can be\nsubstantiated.\nOverall Implications\nNotwithstanding limitations such as these, the study findings\nare of interest for a variety of reasons, including external\ngeneralizability of the evidence, traced back to a nationally\nrepresentative study sample of adolescents in the community,\nas well as the strengths of a standardized assessment plan\nacross the multiple survey years and the size of the samples\nunder study. As for implications, we have chosen to concen-\ntrate our attention on the possibility that the LTF facet of\nparental monitoring might deserve more careful attention in\nclinical and public health population\u00adoriented outcomes re-\nsearch, perhaps with greater attention to the LTF facet specif-\nically within the context of preventive interventions that seek\nto improve overall PM in a more general way. We speculate\nthat the LTF facet might be a crucial component of PM and\nparental supervision in general, with an important functional\ninterdependence--i.e., interdependent with and perhaps de-\nterminative of the age at which sons and daughters are first\nexposed to a chance to try alcohol or tobacco or to experiment\nwith cannabis, opioids, or other internationally regulated\ndrugs. This is a research question to which our attention now\nwill turn, given supportive evidence of LTF variations by sex\nand by age, as discovered in this new look at parental moni-\ntoring and supervision of adolescents.\nIt is in the context of tobacco and other drug prevention\nresearch that the value of an LTF focus might be seen. To\nillustrate, we hope that trialists will consider our previously\nmentioned \"micro-trials\" approach to assess whether PM in-\ntervention impact on these drug outcomes might be strength-\nened when a random subset of participating parents is chosen\nfor SMS text messaging or other interventions specifically\ndirected to the LTF facet. That is, consistent with a micro-\ntrials probe into the potential mechanisms of intervention\neffect, there could be an overall randomization to the PM\nintervention (e.g., parent education sessions and DVDs) and\nto the control condition, and then a more individualized SMS\nmessaging about LTF might be assigned at random to those\nreceiving the PM intervention. In this way, the specific utility\nof LTF might be seen in trial outcomes such as a delayed first\nchance to smoke tobacco or try other drugs, reduced levels of\naffiliation with drug-using peers, and delayed or reduced onset\nof underage smoking or other precocious drug use, as\ngauged against any potentially salubrious background ef-\nfects of an intervention directed toward increasing the\nmore general PM levels.\nConclusion\nOverall, this study sheds light on potentially important male-\nfemale differences in parenting behaviors that might foster\nnew and more probing research into the LTF facet of\nmonitoring and supervision during late childhood and early\nadolescence. Our findings provide additional evidence for\nwhat Axinn et al. (2011) call a double standard, with girls\nbeing limited more on issues relating to courtship or family\nformation. It was beyond the scope of our current study to\naddress whether these male-female differences are associated\nwith more positive or negative outcomes (such as involvement\nwith alcohol, tobacco, or the internationally regulated drugs).\nNonetheless, we are hopeful that the results from this study\nwill foster new research on the potential public health signif-\nicance of the observed variations, including prevention trials\nwith interventions that have a strengthened focus upon specific\nPM facets, such as limiting time with friends. Through new\nprevention experiments of this type, it should become possible\nto estimate the degree to which it is LTF per se that conveys the\neffect of parenting interventions, or whether these effects are\nmediated entirely by what the adolescent is willing to disclose\nto parents, or what the adolescent perceives about parental\nmonitoring. In this way, the prevention research on parenting\ncan be used to shed light on fundamental issues of adolescent\ndevelopment, including the male-female differences observed\nhere.\n"
