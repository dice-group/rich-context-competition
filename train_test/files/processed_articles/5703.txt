Specifically, the aim was to determine\nwhether current OC use was associated with lower extra-pair and higher in-pair sexual interest\nand behavior, because OC use suppresses cyclical shifts in mating psychology that occur in\nnormally cycling women. Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression and negative binomial models\nwere used to test associations between OC use and these sexual measures, controlling for other\nrelevant predictors (e.g., age, parity, in-pair sexual satisfaction, relationship length). The overall\nincidence of having had an extra-pair partner or one-night stand in the previous year was not\nrelated to current OC use (the majority of the sample had not). However, among the women who\nhad engaged in extra-pair sexual behavior, OC users had fewer one-night stands than non-users,\nand tended to have fewer partners, than non-users. OC users also had more frequent dyadic\nintercourse than non-users, potentially indicating higher commitment to their current\nrelationship. These results suggest that suppression of fertility through OC use may alter\nimportant aspects of female sexual behavior, with potential implications for relationship\nfunctioning and stability.\nKeywords: hormonal contraceptives, extra-pair behavior, mate-retention, menstrual cycle, mate\nchoice, sexual desire\nCurrent hormonal contraceptive use predicts dyadic sexual behavior\nIntroduction\nOral contraceptives (OCs) are the most commonly used form of reversible hormonal\ncontraception worldwide (Leridon, 2006). Broadly speaking, they can be classed into two\ngroups: those containing progesterone only, and those comprised of both synthetic estrogen and\nprogesterone. Both types of OCs function to prevent pregnancy by inhibiting natural hormone\nproduction through interfering with the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian feedback loop. This\nresults in the maintenance of high levels of progesterone (and estrogen in combined methods),\nwhich subsequently prevents the release of gonadotropins (LH and FSH), limits follicular\ndevelopment, and inhibits ovulation (Frye, 2006). A range of medical effects of OC use on\nfactors such as physical health (for review see ESHRE, 2005), mood (e.g., Ott, Shew, Ofner, Tu,\nand Fortenberry, 2008), well-being (e.g., Sanders, Graham, Bass, and Bancroft, 2001) and sexual\nfunctioning (for reviews, see Schaffir, 2006; Stuckey, 2008) have been well-documented.\nHowever, emerging evidence from evolutionarily framed studies suggests that OCs may\nhave additional, less explored effects on female sexual interest and mating psychology (reviewed\nin Alvergne and Lummaa, 2010; Cobey and Buunk, 2013; Roberts, Gosling, Carter, and Petrie,\n2008; Roberts et al., 2012). These effects are thought to be associated with the suppression of\nnaturally occurring shifts in female sexual behaviors and preferences which co-vary with\nhormonal fluctuation during the regular menstrual cycle. For example, several studies have\nshown cycle-contingent shifts in sexual behaviour, such that during the fertile phase, when\nconception risk is high, women show greater levels of interest in potential mates (e.g., Haselton\nand Gangestad, 2006), greater receptivity to explicit courtship solicitations (Gu\u00e9guen, 2009), and\nhigher levels of sexual arousal while observing sexually explicit materials (e.g., Slob, Bax, Hop,\nRowland, and van der Werff ten Bosch, 1996). Research examining partnered women's\nbehaviour across the cycle has likewise shown that the prevalence of extra-pair sexual desire\n(Pillsworth, Haselton, and Buss, 2004), extra-pair attention (Gangestad, Thornhill, and Garver,\nincreases during cycle phases associated with high conception risk. Furthermore, women paired\nwith men low in attractiveness are less satisfied with their partners, and show greater fertile\nphase shifts in extra-pair desire and mating behaviors, than women with more attractive partners\n(e.g., Garver-Apgar, Gangestad, Thornhill, Miller, and Olp, 2006; Larson, Haselton, Gildersleeve\nand Pillsworth, 2013; Pillsworth and Haselton, 2006). These findings support the idea that\nincreased attraction to men other than the primary partner during the fertile phase may serve as a\nstrategy to aid partnered women in increasing the genetic quality of potential offspring (Scheib,\nBased on the fact that women using OCs do not experience fertile cycle phases, it may be\nthat OC use reduces or nullifies these cycle-contingent sexual changes. Research conducted to\ntest this premise has shown that OC users pay less attention to both sexually relevant stimuli\n(Laeng and Falkenberg, 2007) and to courtship language (Rosen and Lop\u00e9z, 2009) than normally\ncycling women do. Furthermore, women using OCs do not display cyclical shifts in preference\nfor traits like masculinity and symmetry, which are known to occur in regularly cycling women,\nand are thought to provide an index of physical quality (e.g., faces and masculinity: Little, Jones,\nPenton-Voak, Burt, and Perrett, 2002; voices and masculinity: Feinberg, DeBruine, Jones, and\nLittle, 2008; odor and symmetry: Thornhill and Gangestad, 1999). Studies which have directly\nassessed hormonal levels across the menstrual cycle indicate that the follicular peak in estrogen\nlevels is positively related to fluctuation in sexual desire (Roney and Simmons, 2013), sexual\nCurrent hormonal contraceptive use predicts dyadic sexual behavior\nIn addition to changes in sexual behaviors, women who use OCs have been shown to\nreport higher overall levels of jealousy in studies using both cross-sectional (Geary, DeSoto,\nHoard, Sheldon, and Cooper, 2001) and longitudinal designs (Cobey et al., 2012). Interestingly,\nthe effect of OC use on jealousy also appears to be positively related to synthetic estrogen levels\nfound in OCs (Cobey, Pollet, Roberts, and Buunk, 2011). Welling, Puts, Roberts, Little, and\nBurriss (2012) similarly showed that OC use and dose is associated with a higher prevalence of\nfemale mate-retention behavior (e.g., intersexual manipulation). Given the possibility for both\nendogenic and exogenic hormonal effects in OC users, an important step in future research will\nbe to clearly distinguish between these possible effects. To date, existing research suggests that\nestrogen levels are a likely proximate factor which may underpin many of the aforementioned\neffects. Nonetheless, it remains to be tested how other hormones, or interactions between\nhormones, contribute to these changes. Other correlational work, for example, suggests that\nrelatively high progesterone levels are associated with attraction to male cues of direct benefits\nof mate choice, such as paternal investment, and, in partnered women, with higher long-term\nrelationship commitment (Jones, Little, et al., 2005; Jones, Perrett, et al., 2005). Progesterone\nhas also been associated with higher affiliative motivation and social closeness in general (e.g.,\nBrown et al., 2009). Indeed, OC users maintain preferences for male traits such as financial\nsuccess and intelligence to a greater extent than naturally cycling women (Gangestad, Garver-\nAims and hypothesis\nHere, through use of a representative sample from the Czech Republic, we aimed to test\nfor differences in sexual desire and dyadic sexual activity among coupled OC users and non-\nusers (NU) of reproductive age.\nGiven that OC use eliminates cyclical shifts in estrogen, and that the hormonal profile of\nOC users corresponds most closely with phases of low fertility, it is plausible that reductions in\nattention to sexually significant stimuli and extra-pair sexual desire known to occur at that cycle\nstage are similarly evident in OC users (Pillsworth et al., 2004). Therefore, we predicted that\ncurrent OC use would be associated with lower extra-pair interest and behavior in coupled OC\nusers. To our knowledge, this idea has not yet been tested. Specifically, we predicted that OC\nusers would report a lower number of extra-pair sexual partners within the preceding year.\nFurthermore, since female mate retention behavior is associated with OC use (Welling et al.,\n2012), and since within-pair sex could be viewed as a form of mate-retention behavior, it was\nadditionally predicted that the frequency of dyadic sexual activity would be positively associated\nwith OC use.\nMaterials and Methods\nSampling procedure\nData were obtained from four rounds of the Czech National Survey of Sexual Behavior\ncollected by the socio-demographic agency DEMA using quota sampling (Moser and Kalton,\n1971) in which representative sub-groups of the total Czech population (Czech National Office,\n1991, 2001) were established according to age, economic status, place of residence, and\nCurrent hormonal contraceptive use predicts dyadic sexual behavior\neducational attainment. Project research assistants were then instructed to distribute\nquestionnaires to respondents who satisfied stringent quota criteria within their focus area.\nRespondents were asked to complete the questionnaire alone and to return it to the assistant in a\nsealed envelope. Overall, data were collected from 3,858 women in four rounds of the survey;\nnone of the respondents were tested more than once. Table 1 provides a detailed description of\nthe prevalence of OC use in the Czech population in women of reproductive age (18 - 51 years)\nwithin each of the survey rounds. The mean rate of OC use in the population of coupled Czech\nwomen of reproductive age across all years was 34.4% (see Table 1).\nTable 1.

The sexuality items covered a variety of topics, ranging from\nfrequency of sexual activity to sexual experience, knowledge, and attitudes; here, only items\ncorresponding to our predictions were selected. For the purpose of this study, current extra-pair\nbehavior was operationalized as the \"number of one night stands during the last year\" and the\n\"number of extra-pair sexual partners during the last year,\" and the overall sociosexual\nrestrictiveness of a participant as the \"overall number of sexual partners across the lifetime.\"\nSimilarly, dyadic sexual behavior was defined using the \"frequency of dyadic sexual activities\nper month\" item, whereas sexual desire was defined using the item \"ideal frequency of overall\nCurrent hormonal contraceptive use predicts dyadic sexual behavior\nsexual activity per month\" (therefore it includes desire for solitary and extra-pair sex, as well as\ndyadic sexual activities). Information pertaining to other meaningful predictors of female extra-\npair behavior, such as education (Treas and Giesen, 2000), sexual satisfaction and overall\nsociosexual restrictiveness (Mark, Janssen, and Milhausen, 2011), and the frequency of dyadic\nsexual activities [e.g., age (years), parity, duration of relationship (months), sexual desire, and\nsexual satisfaction of women (for a review see Schneidewind-Skibbe, Hayes, Koochaki, Meyer,\nand Dennerstein, 2008)] were also available and were therefore considered (alongside specific\npredictions) within the statistical models.\nCharacteristics of the sample\nThe data of respondents from the Czech National Survey were only included in analyses\nif they satisfied a number of criteria. Firstly, participants were excluded if they were not of\nreproductive age. Reproductive age was classed as beginning at adulthood (age 18) as defined\nlegally in the Czech Republic (the romantic relationships of younger women are quite specific,\ne.g., they often live with their parents). The upper age limit (age 51) reflects the mean age at\nmenopause across European countries (50.9: Palacios, Henderson, Siseles, Tan, and Villaseca,\n2010). Respondents were also excluded if they had a history of hormonal or reproductive\nproblems (e.g., sterilized, previously underwent hormonal therapy) or if they were not in a\nrelationship of at least 12 months (this restriction afforded comparison of the frequency of one-\nnight stands per year as a measure of extra-pair sexual activity). The sample comprised two focus\ngroups of women: those who were using OC and those who were normally cycling and not using\n(NU) any form of hormonal contraception. Women who a) reported having hormonal problems,\nb) were using some other form of hormonal contraception, but not OCs (e.g., hormonal\nintrauterine device or injections), c) stated they were casual OC users, or d) did not report their\ncontraception details, were also excluded from the sample. After these exclusions, the final\nStatistical analysis\nInitially, chi-square and ANOVA tests were used to determine whether there was a\ndifference between OC and NU respondents with regard to sample characteristics (i.e., age,\nrelationship length and parity) and sexual life history (i.e., age of first sexual intercourse and\nnumber of sexual partners). In further analyses, several measures of female sexual behavior were\ntested using Poisson regression with binomial predictors including contraception use (0 = NU, 1\n= OC), sexual satisfaction (0 = Not satisfied, 1 = Satisfied) and parity (0 = No children, 1 =\nChildren), in addition to continuous predictors (current relationship length in months, age in\nyears).\nPoisson regression (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989) is an extension of the general linear\nmodel used to predict count responses. A restrictive assumption of a Poisson model is that the\nmean count must approximately equal the variance. However, the observed count often exceeds\nthe variability predicted by the Poisson distribution, thus indicating over-dispersion (Cameron\nand Trivedi, 1986). In such cases, a negative binomial model was used (see Hausman, Hall, and\nGriliches, 1984; Sturman, 1999). However, over-dispersion can also be caused by an excess of\nzero responses. In such cases a Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression was employed (see\nLambert, 1992). While accommodating over-dispersion, ZIP regression also deals with the\nexcess of zeros. First, logistic regression is used to predict the binary response \"zero\" or \"non-\nzero\" group membership and in addition Poisson regression is used to predict counts of one or\nCurrent hormonal contraceptive use predicts dyadic sexual behavior\nmore (Lambert, 1992). The regression models here were fitted using the pscl package (Jackman,\n2012) in R (R Development Core Team, 2008). Comparisons between Poisson regression and\nnegative binomial or ZIP models were analyzed using the Vuong test (Vuong, 1989). Model fit\nwas determined against an intercept only model (null model) using AIC and 2.

Finally, there were no significant differences between NU and OC groups\nin the number of lifetime sexual partners (p = .47) or one-night stands (p = .24). All analyses\ncontrolled for the respondents' age (the covariate \"age\" significantly predicted the dependent\nvariable in all cases) because a) number of sexual partners accumulates with age, and b) since\n1989 (when the communist regime in the Czech Republic ended) there has been significant\ncultural change, including in sexual and family behavior of Czech citizens (e.g., age of first\nmarriage has significantly increased, more young people attend university, etc.). Individuals who\nstarted their sexual life in the post-communist era therefore differ in various aspects of attitude\nand behavior (e.g., Diamond, Jozifkova, and Weiss, 2011; Raboch, Raboch, and Sindl\u00e1r, 1996).\nNumber of extra-pair partners and one-night stands per last year\nExtra-pair sexual behavior was operationalized by the reported number of sexual partners\nduring last year minus 1 (the female's current partner). Eighteen respondents were excluded\nbecause they were not yet sexually active; 160 did not answer this item. The data were shown to\nhave an excess of zero responses, because only 13.4 % of women who answered the question\nreported having one or more extra-pair sexual partners in the previous year (n = 178; median = 1,\nM = 1.79, SD = 2.09). The ZIP regression model was shown to be a significant improvement (V\n= -2.80, p = .002) over the Poisson regression.

No significant difference was found between coupled\nOC users and NU in several aspects of their sexual life-history, indicating that the two groups\nwere similar in sociosexual restrictiveness. It was first hypothesized that a link would be found\nbetween current OC use and both low incidence and frequency of extra-pair sexual behavior in\nthe previous year. However, only partial support was found for this, as the incidence of having\nhad a recent extra-pair partner or one-night stand was not significantly predicted by OC use.\nRegression models also indicated that these variables were more closely associated with other\nrelationship-related variables such as sexual satisfaction, parity, and relationship length.\nHowever, in women who reported at least one extra-pair partner, OC users had fewer one night\nCurrent hormonal contraceptive use predicts dyadic sexual behavior\nstands (and tended to have fewer extra-pair sexual partners) in the previous year than non-users\n(independent of the influence of age, relationship length, parity and sexual satisfaction).\nFurthermore, in line with predictions, OC users reported a higher frequency of dyadic intercourse\nthan non-users, although sexual desire was not significantly predicted by the use of OCs. This\nstudy also confirmed that age, relationship length, parity, and sexual satisfaction influence self-\nreported female sexuality data.\nBasic demographic characteristics and sexuality-related life history\nOC users in the sample were on average younger, had shorter relationships, and were less\nlikely to have children than NU. OCs are the most commonly-used form of hormonal\ncontraceptives used by Czech adolescents (Weiss and Zvina, 2003), and they are often the first-\nchoice form of contraception recommended to younger age groups by Czech gynecologists.\nHowever, after controlling for participant age, there was no significant difference between OC\nusers and NUs in the age at which women had sex for the first time.\nFurther, in the representative sample of coupled women, no support was found for the\nassumption that current OC use is connected with higher sociosexual restrictiveness, although it\nshould be acknowledged that restrictiveness was inferred rather than measured directly. Current\nOC users did not report higher numbers of sexual partners or one-night stands across their\nreproductive lifespan compared with NU, and analysis with respect to other variables potentially\nassociated with sexual restrictiveness and sexual responsibility (i.e., prevalence of sexually\ntransmitted diseases; results not shown) did not reveal between-group differences. It could be\nsuggested that the connection between sociosexual restrictiveness and the choice of OCs may\nrather be limited to the population of pubertal and adolescent women where concerns about\nunwanted pregnancy with a casual partner is the main motivation for contraceptive use (Bartz,\nShew, Ofner, and Fortenberry, 2007). In coupled women, the choice of contraceptive type may\nbe related to other variables. For example, factors such as plans for conception, preferences for\nthe method of application (e.g., a relatively high percentage of parous women in our sample used\nnon-hormonal IUD), and individual tolerance of various OC types (Fait, 2011) could determine\nthe choice of contraceptive method.\nNumber of extra-pair sexual partners in the previous year\nContrary to predictions, OC use was not found to be a significant predictor of having an\nextra-pair sexual partner or one-night stand in the last year. As in previous studies, the incidence\nof any extra-pair sexual contact was predicted mainly by relationship-related variables (e.g.,\nHavlicek, Husarova, Rezacova, and Klapilova, 2011); in this case, perceived sexual\ndissatisfaction, relationship length, and parity were significant predictors, which suggests that\nrelationship and commitment-related variables are more important influences on the incidence of\nextra-pair sex in women than demographic characteristics (e.g., age) or current OC use. The\nimportance of relationship satisfaction, and particularly of sexual satisfaction (both are highly\ncorrelated in women, e.g., Byers, 2002, Roberts et al., 2012) as motivators of female extra-pair\nsex was therefore replicated (for a review, see Blow and Hartnett, 2005). In their extensive study\nof various predictors of extra-pair sex, Mark et al. (2011) also concluded that women who are not\nsexually and generally satisfied in their current relationship may be more inclined to seek\nfeelings of closeness and connection elsewhere, and that in women (in contrast to men),\ninfidelity is less sexually motivated. This suggests that, for women, extra-pair sex may more\nCurrent hormonal contraceptive use predicts dyadic sexual behavior\noften be part of a process of switching into a new long-term relationship (Blow and Hartnett,\nBesides relationship-related variables, a woman's likelihood of having an extra-pair\nsexual partner is associated with various attitudes towards infidelity and previous experiences of\ninfidelity (Blow and Hartnett, 2005). Thus women whose attitudes towards infidelity are more\nliberal are more likely to engage in extra-pair sex (Solstad and Mucic, 1999) and women who\nhad extra-pair sex in the past are more likely to do so again (Glass and Wright, 1992). This\nindicates that the likelihood of engaging in extra-pair sex is related to relatively stable individual\ndifferences, particularly in sociosexual orientation, defined as individual differences in the\nwillingness to have casual uncommitted relationships (Penke and Asendorpf, 2008; Simpson and\nGangestad, 1991). Among the other sexuality-related personality traits, additional factors linked\nto sexual risk-taking behavior have also been found to predict sexual infidelity, such as lower\npropensity for sexual inhibition due to performance consequences and higher propensity for\nsexual inhibition due to performance failure (Mark et al., 2011). Although it was not possible to\ndirectly control for such variables in this sample, the absence of a between-group difference in\nsociosexual restrictiveness (i.e., overall number of sexual partners) indicates that the other\nvariables are not different between OC users and non-users.\nA similar argument might be made with respect to the model predicting incidence of one-\nnight stands in the previous year. The only predictor in the zero-inflated part of the model was\nrelationship length, which was associated with a marginally lower probability of having a one-\nnight stand in the previous year. Neither OC use nor relationship-related variables predicted the\nlikelihood of one-night stands in the previous year. Previous research has found that\npsychosocial factors (e.g., attachment styles, alcohol use, attitudes about hooking up, sociosexual\nrestrictiveness) primarily predicted engagement in casual sexual contact (e.g., Owen, Rhoades,\nStanley, and Fincham, 2010). Taken together, the results indicate that there seems to be other\ncrucial variables connected with relationship functioning and personal factors that mitigate\nagainst sexual behavior outside the primary relationship, and that more of the variance may be\nexplained by this trait than the impact of women's hormonal state (menstrual cycling versus OC\nuse). The fact that OC use did not explain the incidence of having had extra-pair sex suggests\nthat shifts in sexual behavior across the cycle do not explain the majority of variance in the\nlikelihood of cheating on one's partner.\nHowever, the count portion of the ZIP model (i.e., including women who reported at least\nsome extra-pair behavior) revealed an additional effect. Here, OC use was the strongest predictor\nof the number of one-night stands. OC users reported fewer one night stands than NUs, although\nthe association with number of extra-pair sexual partners did not quite reach statistical\nsignificance. Such a trend, however, could be explained by cyclical increases in extra-pair sexual\ndesire among NUs during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle: Such an interpretation is in\nline with previous findings about extra-pair attention and behavior during the menstrual cycle. It\nis well documented that female preferences and behavior vary as a function of conception risk.\nConcentration on short-term mating is thought to peak during the fertile phase, whereas\npreference for long-term mating occurs in the non-fertile phase of the menstrual cycle\n(Gangestad and Thornhill, 2008). Specifically, the high fertility phase of the cycle is associated\nwith increased tendencies to engage in opportunistic mating (Durante and Li, 2009), higher\nextra-pair sexual desire (Pillsworth et al., 2004), increased receptivity to a courtship solicitation\nCurrent hormonal contraceptive use predicts dyadic sexual behavior\nSexual behavior and desire\nIn line with predictions, the frequency of dyadic intercourse was higher among OC users\nthan it was within NU, even after controlling for relationship length, women's age, and parity.\nHigher dyadic sexual activity in coupled OC users might be interpreted as an effort to retain the\ninterest of the long-term partner (Buss, 1988), because sexual contact contributes to higher\noverall satisfaction in the relationship (Brody and Costa, 2009). Indeed, the suggestion that OC\nuse is related to higher prevalence of female mate retention behavior was recently documented\n(Welling et al., 2012). We speculate that OC users might therefore be more willing to actively\nengage in sexual activity with their partner, but, unfortunately, the data in relation to the\nfrequency of intercourse did not include the direction of initiation. This is an area for future\nresearch which would help to disentangle this relationship more explicitly.\nAlternatively, it could be that OC users are less concerned about the risk of conceiving\nunintentionally and are thus both more sexually active and satisfied (Oddens, 1999). Indeed,\nsexual satisfaction of women strongly predicts the frequency of dyadic sexual intercourse, but\nthe effect of OC use here was additional to and independent of this. Furthermore, one might\nexpect that enhanced overall sexual desire under the influence of OCs should lead to the higher\nfrequency of dyadic intercourse. Overall, sexual desire was indeed a predictor of frequency of\ndyadic intercourse (as was relationship length and age, for a review see Schneidewind-Skibbe et\nal., 2008), but the model that focused on prediction of overall sexual desire did not support an\nassociation with OC use. In other words, we found no support for the idea that enhanced\nfrequency of dyadic intercourse associated with OC use is mediated through a shift in female\nsexual desire.\nLimitations and areas of future research\nThe research questions and aims of this study were not the main goals of the Czech\nNational Survey of Sexual Behavior; therefore, several relevant questions concerning OC use\ndetails (e.g., length of use, OC brand and hormonal concentrations) were not collected. The same\napplies to some of the sexuality-related measures. For instance, it would be interesting to be able\nto parse desire for the respondent's partner, solitary desire, and extra-pair related sexual desire\n(Roberts, Cobey, Klapilov\u00e1, and Havl\u00edcek, 2013). Furthermore, more detailed data concerning\nfemale sociosexual restrictiveness and relationship-related variables (e.g., level of commitment, a\nmore precise measure of relationship and sexual satisfaction) would provide more sensitive tests\nof our predictions. Moreover, questions on extra-pair behavioral tendencies rather than self-\nreported extra-pair behavior would be preferable, as behavior may be influenced by various\nfactors such as attitudes, social pressure or partners' mate retention behavior, which may not\nhave been accurately gauged through questionnaire responses.\nFinally, the current study is based on cross-sectional and correlational data. Given that\nparticipants self-selected to use or not use OC, the causal inferences we can draw are rather\nlimited. In future research, use of a randomized double-blind design, as is more common in\nmedical research on OC effects, would get around this issue. A study that incorporates repeated\nmeasures, specifically addressing mate preferences and the direction of sexual initiation between\nprimary partners, as well as extra-pair partners, also remains necessary. As it stands, given self-\nselection of OC use in this sample, there may be inferential problems associated with our\nfindings and therefore they must be treated cautiously until they are replicated. Future research\nshould also seek to control for the cycle stage of the sample of the non-users. This may allow for\na more nuanced understanding of the impact of OC use relative to specific regions of the cycle.\nCurrent hormonal contraceptive use predicts dyadic sexual behavior\nDespite these limitations, the use of large representative sampling is relatively uncommon\nwithin the relevant literature. The use of this cross-national survey data demonstrates the\npotential for using the paradigm of evolutionary psychological theory to extend existing\nknowledge and explanations for socially and medically relevant problems.\n"
