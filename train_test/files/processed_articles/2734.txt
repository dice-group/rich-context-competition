Background\nThe harmful effects of discrimination on the mental health of Black populations are well\nestablished [1\u00ad3]. However, less is known about the same effects in Black youth. The current study aims\nto examine the effect of discrimination on suicidal ideation in Black youth. This study also examines\nethnicity and gender differences in the association between discrimination and suicidal ideation.\nDiscrimination is defined as differential and unjust treatment of individuals because of particular\nidentities such as race, ethnicity, age, gender [4]. In the United States, Blacks experience high levels of\ndiscrimination, which increases the risk of undesired mental health outcomes such as psychological\nsymptoms [5\u00ad10] and categorical psychiatric disorders [11]. A recent meta-analysis suggested that\nexposure to racial discrimination increases poor mental health outcomes for Blacks [11]. Similar to\nother stressors, the context in which discrimination happens has an important role in changing the\nAlthough the negative effect of discrimination on the mental health of adults is well\ndocumented [2,11,14,15], fewer studies have focused on the negative influence of discrimination\non the mental health of Black youth [16\u00ad19]. In Black youth, discrimination is linked to stress [19],\nlow self-esteem [18,19], and psychiatric disorders [20]. Discrimination is also associated with\ndepressive symptoms [18,19] as well as clinical depression [17].\nBlack youth may become more aware of their identities during their transition to adolescence and\nadulthood, and therefore may be sensitive to discriminatory experiences that relate to their racial and\ngeneral identities [21,22]. As a result, discrimination experiences may become extremely important\nfor the mental health and well-being of adolescents [23,24]. The negative impact of exposure to\ndiscrimination on the mental health of Blacks persists over time [17,25]. Cheng et al. [26] showed that\ndiscrimination in adolescence predicts future depression among Black youth. Sellers and Shelton have\ndiscussed how discrimination and identities interact among Black youth [27].\nGibbons et al. [28] showed that nine out of 10 Black adolescents report having had at least\none experience of racial discrimination. Black adolescents experience discrimination across settings,\nincluding but not limited to school [29,30]. Although a wide range of mental health outcomes has been\nlinked to discrimination, less is known about the effect of discrimination on suicide and Black youth.\nDiscrimination, however, may not have similar effects across all groups of Blacks.\nHudson et al. [31] have shown that high discrimination may have stronger effects in the presence of\nhigh socioeconomic status (SES). Racial identity may also alter the effects of discrimination on mental\nhealth [32]. A number [27,33,34] but not all [10] studies have also shown that discrimination may have\nstronger effects for males than females, particularly in the presence of high masculine ideologies [35].\nAn interaction between ethnicity and gender has also been shown to alter these effects [3,10].\n2. The Current Study\nThis study investigated the effects of discrimination, ethnicity, gender, and SES on suicidal\nideation in a national sample of Black youth. We also tested gender and ethnic differences in this\nregard. We hypothesized that discrimination will be associated with more suicidal ideation for all\ngroups of Black youth.\n3.1. Design and Setting\nThis is a cross-sectional study. We used data from the National Survey of American\nLife-Adolescent Supplement (NSAL-A), 2003 [9,36]. The NSAL was conducted as a part of the\nCollaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) [37]. The NSAL-A is one of the largest\nnational mental health surveys of Black youth in the United States [38].\nThe University of Michigan Institute Review Board approved the NSAL study. Adolescents'\nlegal guardians provided informed written consent. All adolescents provided assent themselves.\nRespondents received $50 as financial compensation. The study was funded by the National Institute\nof Mental Health (NIMH) and was conducted by the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.\nBlacks. Participating youth ranged in age from 13 to 17 years. At the time of the study, all participants\nresided in the United States. More detailed information on the sampling strategy is available\nThe NSAL-Adolescent sample was drawn from the NSAL, a national probability sample of adult\nBlacks in the United States. The NSAL-adult sample was screened for African American and Caribbean\nBlack households with eligible adolescents living in the households. Adolescents living in households\nwere randomly selected for participation. If more than one eligible adolescent lived in a household,\ntwo adolescents were selected based on the gender of the first eligible adolescent. This strategy resulted\nin non-independence for adolescent samples. In response to this lack of independence, the adolescent\nsupplement data were weighted to adjust for non-independence of the selection probabilities and\nnon-response at the household and individual levels. The weighted data were then post-stratified to\nrepresent national estimates based on gender, age, and ethnicity [9,10].\nAll interviews were conducted in English. Interviews lasted 100 minutes on average. The overall\nresponse rate was 80.6%. The response rate was slightly higher for Caribbean Black youth (83.5%) than\nfor African American youth (80.4%).\nFor the majority (82%) of the interviews, data collection occurred during in-person interviews\nconducted in the adolescents' homes. The remaining 18% of interviews were conducted entirely or\npartially by telephone. All in-person interviews used computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPIs).\nWith CAPI, computers are used by trained interviewers to conduct the interviews. CAPI is the\npreferred method of interviewing for long and complex questionnaires.\n4. Measures\nSociodemographics: The study included demographic factors, such as age, gender, and ethnicity.\nSocioeconomic status (SES) was also measured. For SES, we used the poverty index, defined as the\nincome-to-needs ratio from the 2001 United States Census. The poverty index was calculated by\ndividing household income by the poverty threshold [39]. Higher scores on the poverty index indicate\nhigher SES.\nEthnicity: Ethnicity was the self-identified ethnicity of the family household in which the\nadolescent lived. Participants self-identified as either African Americans or Caribbean Blacks.\nAfrican American was defined as Black without having ancestral ties to the Caribbean. Caribbean Black\nwas defined as Black having ancestral ties to a country included on a list of Caribbean countries\nprovided by the interviewer, or that the particpant's parents or grandparents were born in a\nCaribbean country. Caribbean countries included Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahamas,\nCuba, Dominican Republic, Dominica, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\nTrinidad and Tobago, Saint Lucia, and Saint Kitts and Nevis.\nDiscrimination: NSAL-A used a 13-item modified version of the Everyday Discrimination Scale\n(EDS) to measure discrimination. These items assess chronic, routine, and less overt discriminatory\nexperiences that have occurred over the past year [40]. Although the original measure includes\n10 items, NSAL-A has added three additional items that reflect perceived teacher discrimination.\nAlthough this measure was originally developed and normalized among adults, it also operates\nwell for adolescents [9,40,41]. Respondents were asked: \"In your day-to-day life, how often have\nany of the following things happened to you?\" Sample items include: \"being followed around in\nstores\", \"people acting as if they think you are dishonest\", \"receiving poorer service than other\npeople at restaurants\", and \"being called names or insulted\". The Likert response scale ranged from 1\n(never) to 6 (almost every day). A sum score was calculated, reflecting the frequency of exposure to\ndiscriminatory events over the past year ( = 0.86).\nSuicidal ideation: Lifetime serious suicidal ideation was asked using the following single-item\nmeasure: Did the following experience ever happen to you? \"You seriously thought about killing\nyourself\". Single-item measures of suicidal ideation have been frequently used in large-scale national\nepidemiological studies [34,42\u00ad44]. Only 11.3% of participants that endorse a single-item suicide\nattempt engage in behavior that would not meet the standard definition of a suicide attempt. Similarly,\nonly 8.8% of individuals who endorse a single-item measure of suicidal ideation endorse thoughts that\nwould not meet standard definitions of suicidal ideation. These are indicative of an acceptable validity\nof a single-item measure of suicidal ideation [45].\n5. Statistical Analysis\nTo accommodate the complex design of the NSAL-A, Stata 13.0 (Stata Corp., College Station,\nTX, USA) was used for data analysis. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals\nwere reported.\nWe used the Taylor expansion approximation technique to re-calculate the complex design-based\nestimates of variance. Standard errors reflect the weights due to the complex sampling design.\nAll percentages reported in this study are weighted. As the Caribbean Black sample is more clustered\nthan the African American sample, the standard errors are systematically larger for Caribbean Black\nthan that for African American youth. As a result, findings are more conservative for Caribbean\nBlack youth.\nWe used survey logistic regression for multivariable analysis. In our model, discrimination was\nthe main predictor, lifetime suicidal ideation was the main outcome, and age, gender, ethnicity,\nand the poverty index were covariates. We fit multiple logistic regression models to determine\nthe role of discrimination on suicidal ideation in the pooled sample as the subgroups. In the first\nstep, the association of interest was estimated in the pooled sample. In the next step, we added the\ninteraction terms (between discrimination and ethnicity or gender) to the model. Finally, we ran\nmodels specific to ethnicity and gender.\nFrom logistic regressions, we reported Odds Ratios (ORs) and associated 95% Confidence Intervals\n(CIs). p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Missing data was not imputed.\nWe used complete case analysis for our regression models.\n6. Results\n6.1. Descriptive Statistics\nage of the participants was 15 years (SD = 1.42).

Discussion\nThe current study found an association between discrimination and suicidal ideation in a national\nsample of Black youth. Discrimination was a universal risk factor for suicidal ideation among Black\nyouth, regardless of their ethnicity or gender.\nThe effect of discrimination as a risk factor for suicidal ideation among Black youth is in line\nwith research showing that discrimination jeopardizes a wide range of mental health outcomes for\nadolescents [11] as well as adults [40,41]. In a recent study, we found that discrimination predicted the\ndeterioration of the mental health of Blacks decades later [46].\nWe did not find gender differences in the association between discrimination and suicidal ideation\nof Black youth. At least three previous studies have shown the stronger effects of discrimination on\nundesired mental health outcomes for males than females [27,46,47]. Discrimination was particularly\ndetrimental for Black males who had high SES [31,48] or high masculinity ideologies [35].\nThe differences observed between the results of this study and previous research on\ngender differences in the link between discrimination and suicide may be in part due to\nsampling (national datasets versus local sample), study setting (clinical versus community studies),\nor developmental age (early, mid, late adolescents, and emerging adults). It is not clear whether\ngender differences in suicidal ideation become more significant during emerging adulthood or not.\nIt is also likely that gender differences are more pronounced for mental health outcomes rather than\nsuicidal ideation.\nOur study showed gender differences in exposure to discrimination, with males reporting more\ndiscrimination than females. There are other studies showing that among Blacks, males report\nhigher rates of perceived discrimination compared to females [49,50]. Such gender differences in\ndiscrimination may be due to measurement or due to salience of dominance and hierarchy for\nmales [51]. Discrimination may be more common among Black men [52] as they also experience mass\nincarceration and police brutality [53]. In addition, Black men may be more prone to its effects [51].\nIn a recent study of Black men, discrimination fully mediated the effect of incarceration history on\npoor mental health outcomes [16].\nThe current study did not find any ethnic differences in the effects of discrimination on suicidal\nideation among Black male and female youth. These results are different from the previous studies\nthat have shown ethnic differences in mental health effects of discrimination among Blacks. In the first\nstudy, Seaton et al. [9] reported a three-way interaction between ethnicity, gender, and discrimination\non the mental health outcomes of Black youth. Specifically, the effects of perceived discrimination on\ndepressive symptoms and life satisfaction were stronger for Caribbean Black females compared to\nAfrican American males. In the second study using a national sample of Black adults, Assari, Watkins,\nand Caldwell [3] found a three-way interaction between gender, ethnicity, and race attribution on\nclinical depression. The study showed the strongest effect of discrimination on depression among\nCaribbean Black males who did not see race as a major barrier against upward social mobility.\nEthnicity may alter susceptibility to discrimination through ethnic identity [32], social class [31],\nand expectations [54].\nAlthough we found that females reported more suicidal ideation than males and males reported\nmore discrimination than females in the current study, we did not find the same ethnicity by gender\ndifferences in the effects of discrimination on suicidal ideation as other studies with different mental\nhealth outcomes. This finding suggests that the nature of suicidal ideation in the face of discrimination\nis equally harmful for all groups of Black youth.\n8. Limitations\nThis study had a few limitations. First, given the cross-sectional design of the study,\nthe associations reported here should not be interpreted as causation. Second, the sample size was\nnot identical across gender and ethnic groups. Third, the main outcome was evaluated using a\nsingle-item measure. Although this is a common approach in studying suicidal ideation in large-scale\nnational studies [34,42\u00ad44], more comprehensive measures provide results with higher validity [55].\nFourth, a wide range of unmeasured factors such as negative life events, history of trauma and\nabuse, family support, psychiatric disorders, and access to healthcare may confound the results.\nReligious involvement, family support, ethnic identity, race-related attitudes, and attribution system\nmay all alter the mental health consequences of discrimination.\n9. Future Directions\nFuture research might delineate ways to focus on protective factors as well as effective\ninterventions that can undo racism and discrimination. Additional research is needed with a more\ncomprehensive set of control variables. A host of variables may contribute to the observed association\nbetween experiences of discrimination and suicidal ideation. For example, negative affectivity,\nneuroticism, or vigilance could be third variables that contribute to both perceived discrimination\nand suicidal ideation. There is also a need for studies that delve into mechanisms that link perceived\ndiscrimination to suicidal ideation. Furthermore, there is a need to study higher levels and structural\nfactors that shape the mental health of Black youth. Research should also test whether interventions\nare similarly effective for different gender and ethnic groups.\nIn summary, in line with the literature that shows that discrimination jeopardizes other mental\nhealth outcomes, we found that discrimination was associated with suicidal ideation in Black youth.\nThis association was found to be universal regardless of the ethnicity or gender of the youth.\n"
