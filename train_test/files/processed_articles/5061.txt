Practitioners can monitor various\nantecedents that have a direct and positive influ-\nence upon these desired measures of performance.\nSimilarly, there can be several drivers that engender\ndesired employee job attitudes, which in turn can then\ntrigger customers' positive experience and their loyalty.\nThe literature supports the idea that the way employees\ndefine their roles or make modifications in the already\nassigned job role, known as job crafting, has a direct\nbearing on their decisions to behave at the workplace and\ntheir consequent performance. Based on this idea, the\npresent study attempts to identify the root of customers'\npositive experience and their loyalty around the construct\nof job crafting of service employees in a retail banking\nservice setting. However, work engagement is consid-\nered as a connecting link between job crafting and the\nfinal outcome, that is, customers' positive experience and\ntheir loyalty as considered in the present study.\nThe significance of customer loyalty as a measure of\nperformance draws sufficient support from the liter-\nature as it is the only viable and profitable option in\ntimes of hyper competition (Verma, 2001). Any lapse on\nthe part of the service manager on this front will surely\nprompt customers to exit the relationship with the\nservice provider, thus affecting the profitability. Apart\nfrom the pressure of market competition, firms other-\nwise also have to be concerned for customer loyalty\ninasmuch as it brings benefits to the firms. The most\ncommon advantage is the firm's ability to retain most\nprofitable customers (e.g., Heskett, Jones, Loveman,\nSassar, & Schlesinger, 1994) and remain effective both\nat the operational and strategic levels (Robert & Mark,\n2011). Owing to continuously dealing with the same\ngroup of customers over a long period, the firms are\nbetter able to understand the specific requirements of\ntheir customers that help them attain efficiency and\neffectiveness. This, in turn, proves loyal customers\nas more profitable (Dawkins & Reichheld, 1990; Paul\n& Earl, 2011). Furthermore, it costs five times more to\nattract new customers than to maintain the relationship\nwith the existing customers (Clancy & Schulman, 1994).\nResearch also suggests that an improvement of 5 per\ncent in customer retention results in an improvement\nCountless studies in the past have indicated customer\nloyalty as a direct function of customer satisfaction\nmarketers should primarily be concerned about all\nthose aspects that maintain and improve customer\nsatisfaction to ensure other desired customer outcomes\nincluding customer loyalty.\nThe quality of service employees is the direct reflection\nof the quality of the whole organization and the conse-\nquent service experience of the customer. Therefore, all\nthe aspects having bearing on the service employee job\nattitudes and their overall quality need to be looked at\nmore professionally by service marketers to monitor\ncustomers' satisfaction and consequently their loyalty.\nService marketers may find several factors that shape\nthe desired service employee attitudes at the work-\nplace. However, this study focuses on work engage-\nment and job crafting of service employees.\nThe term work engagement was first coined by Kahn\n(1990), who referred to it as workers' positive attitude\nat their workplace. Accordingly, apart from psycho-\nlogical presence, the workers expressed themselves\nphysically, cognitively and emotionally at their work-\nplaces. In his pioneering work, Kahn also referred to\nit as workers' `self-in-role', whereby they put their self\nin their work roles, thus making themselves feel atten-\ntive, connected, integrated and focused in their work\nexplained that work engagement was a function of\nthree important factors. First, the purpose workers\nattached to their work role. Second, the psycholog-\nical safety workers enjoyed to ensure that their work\nwould not result in any undesired reward. Finally, the\naccessibility and availability of job resources that were\nrequired to perform one's required role.\n`a distinct and unique construct consisting of cognitive,\nemotional and behavioural components ... associated\nwith individual role performance'. Conceptualizing\nwork engagement as a construct that includes long-\nterm emotional involvement with the work role, Saks\n(2006) emphasized its consequential side. Accordingly,\nit exerts its positive influence on workers' motivation\nand several positive organizational outcomes (Wagner\n& Harter, 2006). More recently, work engagement has\nbeen referred to as workers' psychological immersion,\nstriving, absorption, focus and involvement in their\nwork roles (Bakker, 2011; Macey, Schneider, Barbera, &\nMany researchers believe that the work done by\nSchaufeli, Salanova, Gonza\u00b4lez-Roma\u00b4, and Bakker,\n(2002) was a major breakthrough in this area. Schaufeli\nand his associates conceptualized work engagement\nas a three-dimensional construct that included dimen-\nsions such as vigour, dedication and absorption. The\nauthors defined work engagement as `a positive,\nfulfilling, work-related state of mind characterized by\nvigour, dedication, and absorption'. Schaufeli et al.\n(2002) referred to `vigour' as the workers' state of mind\ncharacterized by feeling energetic, willing to put higher\nwork efforts in one's work and the feeling of continuing\nto work in spite of difficulties. `Dedication' is indicated\nas worker's enthusiasm triggered by sensing work as\nmeaningful, challenging as well as inspiring. Finally,\n`absorption' is worker's engrossment in work role to\nsuch an extent that s/he feels as if time passes very fast\nand does not feel like withdrawing from the workplace.\nA different perspective of looking at the construct of\nwork engagement is to consider it as something oppo-\nsite of workers' burnout (Gonzalez, Schaufeli, Bakker,\ngeneral argument of these burnout scholars is that\nwork engagement comprises attitudes such as energy,\ninvolvement and efficacy. These are the direct oppo-\nsites of the three dimensions, namely, exhaustion, cyni-\ncism and inefficacy, or all that constitute the construct\nof burnout.\nManagement generally endeavours for desired\nemployee job attitudes for they are vital for organi-\nzational performance. Among these, organizational\ncitizenship behaviour (Saks, 2006; Schaufeli & Bakker,\n2004), employee enthusiasm and sense of belonging-\nness to organization (Buckingham & Coffman, 1999),\njob satisfaction (Richman, 2006), lower employee turn-\nover intentions (e.g., Hakanen, Bakker, & Schaufeli,\nbetter health and work performance (Sonnentag,\n2003) are some of the significant attitudes that have\nbeen indicated as a function of work engagement in\nthe past. More recently, some studies have revealed\nthat engaged employees are able to develop warm,\ntrusting relationships with their workmates and tend\nto develop and grow as a person (Diener et al., 2010).\nFurthermore, organizational performance variables\nsuch as business returns (Davenport & Harding, 2012;\nRichman, 2006; Xanthopoulou, Bakker, Demerouti,\n& Schaufeli, 2009), employee productivity and job\nperformance (Bakker & Bal, 2010; Halbesleben &\nWheeler, 2008) and customer positive experience\nalso been associated with work engagement.\nThus, work engagement is one of the crucial areas\nthat the service managers cannot afford to overlook.\nHowever, what is more important is to look for all\nthose aspects that engender work engagement among\nemployees to reap its possible benefits as discussed\nearlier. Drawing from the literature, the service prac-\ntitioners can find several factors that could drive work\nengagement amongst their employees. The present\nstudy focuses on job crafting of service employees that\nis assumed to promote work engagement and ensure\nits consequent benefits to service organizations.\nThe concept of job crafting was first introduced by\nWrzesniewski and Dutton (2001) as an extension\nof the concept of job design that is considered as a\ntop-down function of managers to formally design\njobs of their subordinates. It is referred to as the\nprocess by which managers decide individual job\ntasks and the required authority for their subordi-\nnates (Gibson, Ivancevich, & Donnelly, 1994; Greg\ndrew attention towards the significance of employees\nin making modifications to the already designed jobs\nby the management. The authors referred to it as a\nbottom-top approach, whereby employees altered the\nboundaries of their jobs as per their interests, tastes,\npreferences and qualifications on their own initia-\ntive. Such modifications in jobs could be in the form\nof performing tasks differently than others or making\nadditions or reductions in the number of tasks (phys-\nical crafting). The modifications could also include\nchanging the relational boundaries at the workplace\n(Berg, Wrzesniewski, & Dutton, 2010), that is, the\nemployees decide about the frequency and the quality\nwith which they may interact with others at the work-\nplace (relational crafting). Finally, the employees\ncould have their own way of perceiving different\ntasks and relationships between those tasks (cognitive\ncrafting) that could result into a job as a whole (Leana,\nTims, Bakker, & Derks, 2012; Wrzesniewski & Dutton,\nThe job alterations initiated by employees according\nto Tims et al. (2012) are mainly done to maintain a\nbalance between job demands and job resources\nso perceived by the employees in their work\nenvironment. Thus, conceptualizing job crafting as\nemployee-initiated changes with an aim to evade the\nkind of mismatch, Tims et al. (2012) argued that these\njob alterations carried out by employees could be\nmainly of four categories.\n\u00b7 Increasing structural job resources: In order to\nimprove the performance both at the employee\nand the organizational levels, employees may\nstrive to enhance the structural resources such\nas demanding variety in their resources, more\nautonomy, responsibility improving job know-how\nfrom their employers to attain self-development\nand seeking more opportunity for their growth and\nadvancement.\n\u00b7 Decreasing hindering job demands: Employees may\nreducethenumberoftasksbydoingawaywithsome\nof the tasks they feel both physically and psycholog-\nically uncomfortable with or they may consciously\navoid engagements that make their overall job over-\nwhelming. Avoiding working for long hours, taking\ncomplicated decisions or ignoring people who can\naffect them emotionally are some of the instances of\nthis kind of crafting.\n\u00b7 Increasing social job resources: In the interest of\nimprovement in performance, employees may seek\nguidance, opinions and feedback from superiors,\nsubordinates and peers, and, thus, can build up a\ndesiredsocialsupportintheworkenvironment.This\nsocial support has bearing on their job performance.\n\u00b7 Increasing challenging job demands: In order to\nmaintain interest and avoid boredom in one's job,\nemployees may attempt to broaden the scope of their\njob or mix and remix the tasks of the job to make it\nmore challenging. Taking on extra responsibilities\nand exhibiting interest in new job developments\nand assignments are some job crafting initiatives by\nemployees.\nResearchers purport several desired outcomes from job\ncrafting in the organizational context. These outcomes\ninclude better performance (Worline, Wrzesniewski, &\nRafaeli, 2002), employee commitment, job effectiveness\nand lower absenteeism (Ghitulescu, 2006); employee\ninitiative, persistence and action (Crant, 1995); job satis-\nfaction (Berg, Dutton, & Wrzesniewski, 2008; Warr &\nInceoglu, 2012); cultivating employee work identity\nand meaning (Wrzesniewski et al., 2012); employee\nretention (Kristof-Brown, Zimmerman, & Johnson,\nperson\u00adenvironment fit and consequent lower stress\n(Sulsky & Smith, 2005); and colleague ratings of in-role\nperformance (Bakker, Tims, & Derks, 2012).\n  as a Result of  \nThe job demands\u00adresources (JD-R) model (Demerouti,\nBakker, Nachreiner, & Schaufeli, 2001) has classified\nwork environment, irrespective of occupations, mainly\ninto two categories. First, job demands that refer to\nphysical, psychological and social aspects of the job.\nThese require cognitive or emotional efforts on the\npart of employee. The presence of these demands acti-\nvates a process of exhaustion characterized by high\nlevels of demands in the work environment. This, in\nturn, reduces both mental and physical energy, and\nconsequently increases fatigue, burnout and health\ncomplaints of employees (Schaufeli, Leiter, & Maslach,\n2009). Second, job resources are physical, psycholog-\nical and social aspects of the job that not only facili-\ntate employee performance but also help them grow\nat the individual level. The instances of job resources\nare autonomy, skill variety, feedback, task significance,\nopportunities for growth, job security, rewards and\nsocial relations (Bakker, Demerouti, & Verbeke, 2004).\nThese resources activate the motivational process, char-\nacterized by higher levels of employee willingness to\nspend energy, better performance and work engage-\nJob crafters make alterations in their jobs mainly\nto reduce job demands and increase job resources.\nConsequently, their fatigue, burnout and other\nassociated ill effects of the first process of motivation\nas discussed above are expected to be checked by\ndecreasing job demands via job crafting. Again\nthe second process, characterized by higher levels\nof employee willingness to spend energy, better\nperformance and work engagement, is also expected\nto be activated by increasing job resources. Specifically,\nTims et al. (2012) referred to job crafting as employee\nattitude aimed at increasing structural job resources,\ndecreasing hindering job demands, increasing social\njob resources and increasing challenging job demands\nby an employee. These efforts on the part of employees\nare actually job alterations mainly carried out either\nto increase job resources or decrease job demands.\nConsidering the above discussion about the two\nmotivational processes as a reason of job demands and\njob resources, it is arguable that job crafting may not\nonly offset the de-motivating effects (by decreasing\njob demands) but also set the process of motivation\nin action (by increasing job resources). Therefore,\njob crafting is expected to positively affect employee\nmotivation, dedication, effort level, commitment and,\nhence, their engagement (Crawford, Lepine, & Rich,\nreferred to work engagement as the crucial variable\nin the motivational process. Accordingly, the first\nhypothesis of the study is proposed as:\nH1: Greaterthelevelofjobcraftingofserviceemployees,\ngreater will be their work engagement.\n  as a Result of Work\nEngagement\nThe engaged employees generally invest considerable\namount of their work effort into behaviours that are\nappropriate for performing their work roles inasmuch\nas work engagement is employees' attitude character-\nized by vigour, dedication and absorption at their work-\nplace (Schaufeli et al., 2002). Work effort is significant in\nterms of the process and mechanism that convert moti-\nvation into an accomplished task (Walker, Churchill,\n& Ford, 1977). Thus, those who are engaged are more\nlikely to perform better as a result of higher motivation\nfor work (Bakker & Demerouti, 2008). Furthermore,\nengagement also influences customers' positive expe-\nrience indirectly through employee job satisfaction.\nEmployees who put considerable effort into their roles\nare able to improve their sense of efficacy, self-determi-\nnation and consequently trigger motivation (e.g., Saks,\n2006). Consequently, they prove to be more resourceful\nfor customers to understand their emotions, require-\nments and expectations during the service interaction.\nEngaged workers feel attentive, connected, integrated\nand focused at their job places (Kahn, 1992), emotion-\nally committed in the long run to their organization\n(Buckingham & Coffman, 1999; Wagner & Harter,\n2006). These attitudes improve the sense of connect-\nedness, mutual support, freedom of expression and\ngenuine caring for each other within the work group\nand consequently help in rendering better customer\nservice. In view of these arguments, it sounds reason-\nable to propose the following:\nGreater the service employee work engagement,\ngreater will be the customer outcomes.\n  as a Result of  \nJob crafting has positive motivational effects on\nemployees. When employees are offered the scope to\ncraft their jobs as per their tastes, preferences, experi-\nence and qualifications, it makes them feel authorized.\nThis kind of feeling or what has been referred to as\n`self-perceived decision-making authority' is a driving\nforce for the customer orientation of service employees\n(COSE) and consequent customer satisfaction (Brown,\nSiddiqi, 2009). Furthermore, both the self-perceived\ndecision-making authority and consequent perceived\nbetter performance make employees feel that their jobs\nare more worthwhile, meaningful or something they\nshould take pride in. Thus, it increases their job satis-\nfaction, sense of self-respect, self-identification and\nbelongingness to their roles. Scholars of identity theory\n(e.g., Loscocco, 1989) and those of job satisfaction (e.g.,\nDaan Van, 2000; Mackenzie, Podsakoff, & Ahearne,\nthese positive feelings as significant for efficient service\ndelivery and consequent desired customer outcomes.\nFinally, on enjoying the latitude of making alterations\nin their jobs and the consequent satisfaction (Carsten,\nSchermuly, & Schermuly, 2011), job crafters, in turn,\nare expected to find ways to reciprocate and benefit\ntheir organizations. This is aligned with the view of\nthe theorists (Shore & Shore, 1995) of social exchange\ntheory and the rule of reciprocity. In the service context,\noffering the best possible customer service and satisfac-\ntion to firm's customers is the most appropriate way for\nthese job crafters to reciprocate and express their posi-\ntive feelings.\nResearch studies in the past have advocated customer\nsatisfaction as one of the most significant drivers of\ncustomer loyalty with the existing firm (Christopher,\ncally true that customers will prefer to continue with\nthe existing firm rather than unnecessarily switching to\nany other firm if their expectations are duly fulfilled by\nthe existing service provider (Crosby, Evans, & Cowles,\nthe above discussion that establishes a link between\njob crafting of service employees and customer satis-\nfaction also supports the relevance of job crafting to\ncustomer loyalty. Accordingly, the following assump-\ntion is proposed:\nH3: The greater the job crafting of service employee, the\ngreater will be the customer outcomes (customer\nsatisfaction and customer loyalty in this study).\nThe discussion and the pertinent literature above\nhave clarified not only the concepts under reference\nbut also the basis for several assumptions. These\nassumptions have prompted the author to propose\nseveral hypotheses of the study (H1\u00adH3). Drawing\non the past literature, the author assumes job crafting\nto influence work engagement that, in turn, is related\nto customer outcomes. In such circumstances, work\nengagement happens to be both dependent and\nindependent variables in between job crafting and\ncustomer outcomes. Additionally, job crafting is also\nassumed as a direct predictor of customer outcomes (see\nFigure 1). In such a situation, there appears an ample\nscope of testing mediation effects of work engagement,\nan expected intermediating variable in the causal\nrelationships. Thus, the following assumption also\nseems to be reasonable:\nEmployees' work engagement mediates the rela-\ntionship between service employees' job crafting\nand customer outcomes.\nFigure 1: Impact of   and   on  \nIncreasing Structural\nJob Resources (ISJR-1)\nDecreasing Hindering\nJob Demands (DHJD)\nIncreasing Social Job\nResources (ISJR-2)\nIncreasing Challenging\nJob Demands (ICJD)\n \n(WE)\n  (CL)\n  (CS)\n  (JC)   (WE)  \nSource: Author's compilation.\nTheliteratureonworkengagementhasmostlyemerged\neither from the practitioner literature or consulting\nfirms and not so much from the academic literature\n(Robinson, Perryman, & Hayday, 2004). Similarly,\nwhile complementing the concept of job design, the\nterm `job crafting' was recently coined by Wrzesniewski\nand Dutton (2001) as a bottom-top view of job design.\nTherefore, the concept of job crafting is yet to receive\nits due attention from scholars in organizational\nstudies (Wrzesniewski & Dutton, 2001). Although a\nfew empirical studies (e.g., Ghitulescu, 2006; Leana et\nal., 2009) have been conducted, their focus, neverthe-\nless, has been either on education or manufacturing.\nFurthermore, these studies are generally found to be\ntheoretical or qualitative in nature (Tims et al., 2012).\nThe research around the construct of job crafting is in\nits infancy so much so that scholars report a lack of\nestablished scales for measuring job crafting (Tims &\ncome in the way of making advances in understanding\nthe concept of job crafting and making additions to this\nline of research (Tims et al., 2012). Therefore, realizing\nthe above gaps, and specifically, responding to the\nnumber of research calls whereby job crafting behav-\niours could be empirically related to various desired\nconsequences at the employee and organizational\nlevels (e.g., Tims et al., 2012), the present study seems\nto be the need of the hour. Additionally, ascertaining\nboth the direct and indirect effects of job crafting atti-\ntudes on the part of service employee on customer\noutcomes would be a step forward in this direction.\nThis is more so in the Asian region where there is no\npublished work that links job crafting with perfor-\nmance in the service context to the best of the authors'\nknowledge and belief.\nFollowing the liberalization of economies, there\nhas been an increasing trend of multi-national\ncompanies opening business units in the Asian region.\nCountless service providers approach the same\ncustomers simultaneously. This has made the job of\nAsian corporate to retain their existing customers\nin the services sector more challenging. Therefore,\nthe studies highlighting how service providers can\nimprove customer experience and the consequent\ncommitments to their existing service firms are highly\njustified. Additionally, the diffusion of the concept of\nwork engagement and job crafting among the service\nmanagers and highlighting its relevance to services\nwould be a worthwhile attempt.\nMETHODOLOGY\nTo ascertain the connections between service employee\nwork engagement, job crafting, customer satisfaction\nand loyalty, primary data were collected from service\nemployees and customers of several branches of\nfour prestigious banks. It included public, private\nand foreign banks operating in some of the states in\nnorthern-most parts of the country such as Delhi,\nPunjab, J&K and Haryana. A proportionate stratified\nsampling procedure was adopted to include all the\npossible categories such as rural, semi-rural, urban and\nmetropolitan in the sample.\nTheserviceemployeeswererequestedtoreacttoasurvey\ninstrument to share their perspective about various\ndimensions of job crafting and work engagement. The\ncustomers were requested to reveal their satisfaction\nand loyalty again by reacting to a different survey instru-\nment. Each service employee was requested to respond\nto one employee survey instrument and collect four\ncustomer survey instruments completed by any four\ncustomers of his/her choice. A common identification\nnumber was allotted to the employee and those of four\ncustomers' survey instruments facilitated the matching\nprocess. The aggregated mean scores of customer\nresponses were then matched with those of the service\nemployee as recommended by several researchers in the\ninstruments were distributed, out of which, as many as\nas 540 (54%) customer survey instruments were received\nand found usable for the final analysis. The average\nresponse of the number of customers per employee\nResearch Instruments and Scale Purification\nLickert's 5-point scale that offers the scope of ascer-\ntaining respondents' agreement or disagreement level\n(ranging from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree)\nwith the statements was used.

The\npurpose of the purification process among other objec-\ntives ensured that all scale items were statistically signif-\nicant and all scales showed unidimensionality in terms\nof model fit indices and face validity.\nTo capture the notion of the employees' level of work\nengagement, a 17-item Utrecht   Scale\n(UWES) originally developed by Schaufeli et al.

Finally, the total effects exerted by several\ndimensions of job crafting of service employees either\ndirectly on customer outcomes or indirectly through\nemployee work engagement were measured with the\nhelp of path analysis. The estimation of both direct\nand indirect effects made it possible to measure the\nextent of mediation by intermediating variable (work\nengagement in this study). However, the author\nestimated a measurement model prior to examining\nthe relationships through path analysis.

Similarly, in the case of customer loyalty, both\nincreasing challenging job demands and decreasing\nhindering job demands exert significant and substan-\ntial indirect effects (around half of the total effect) on\ncustomer loyalty, thereby indicating again a partial\nmediation of the mediating variable. The impor-\ntant observation is the most substantial and signifi-\ncant indirect effect (above 86% of the total effect) of\nincreasing challenging job demands on the customer\nsatisfaction. This suggests a full mediation of inter-\nmediating variables here. However, increasing social\njob resources exert only marginal indirect effect\n(around 10%) both in the case of customer satisfaction\nand customer loyalty, thus suggesting not so signifi-\ncant intermediating role of the intermediating vari-\nable. Overall, the indirect effects also contribute to a\nconsiderable extent in shaping the desired customer\noutcomes in the present analysis and, accordingly, it\nis safe to accept H4--that employees' work engage-\nment mediates the relationship between service\nemployee job crafting and customer outcomes.\nTable 3: Decomposed Direct, Indirect and Total Effects of Dimensions of   on  \nDependent Variables\nDimensions of     (CS)   (CL)\nIndependent Variables\nDirect effect Indirect effect Total effect Direct effect Indirect effect Total effect\nSource: Author's compilation.\nNotes: *Significant at p < 0.01; ** significant at p < 0.05.\n\nISJR-1: increasing structural job resources; DHJD: decreasing hindering job demands; ISJR-2: increasing social job resources; ICJD:\nincreasing challenging job demands.\nFigure 2: Impact of   and   on  \nIncreasing Structural\nJob Resources (ISJR-1)\nDecreasing Hindering\nJob Demands (DHJD)\nIncreasing Social Job\nResources (ISJR-2)\nIncreasing Challenging\nJob Demands (ICJD)\nCustomer\nSatisfaction and\n \n  (WE)\nSource: Author's compilation.\nNotes: Significance range from p < 0.001 to p < 0.05; Direct effect: ; Indirect effect: Coefficients reflecting magnitude of effects on\ncustomer loyalty are indicated in ovals and those on customer satisfaction are indicated without ovals on the arrow lines.\nIMPLICATIONS\nIn view of the significance of customer satisfaction and\nloyalty with the service firms, the present study was\nconducted to highlight the factors that caused these\noutcomes. The study also attempted to diffuse the\nunderstanding as to how these factors were related\nto the positive customer experiences and their loyalty\nto service firms. With the help of both the literature\nand the present empirical findings, the study estab-\nlishes that job crafting attitude of service employees\nresult in service employee work engagement and\ndesired customer outcomes (customer satisfaction and\ncustomer loyalty in the present study). In addition\nto the direct positive impact of various employee job\ncrafting attitudes on work engagement and customer\noutcomes, the study also indicates its indirect impact\non customer outcomes through service employee work\nengagement. Thus, it also draws our attention towards\nthe intermediating role of service employee work\nengagement in the causal relationship. These causal\nrelationships among the constructs such as service\nemployee crafting attitudes, work engagement and\ndesired customer outcomes, both in the direct and indi-\nrect forms, emphasize the relevance of these constructs\nin the service context. Additionally, the present study\nshows the construct of job crafting to be as much impor-\ntant as had been proved in the non-service context in\nthe past.\nThe causal relationships so ascertained in the present\nstudy corroborate the basic philosophy of internal\nmarketing advocating spillover effects of internal\ncustomer satisfaction on external customer satisfaction\n(e.g., George, 1990). This is true insofar as work engage-\nment reflecting the satisfaction of service employee\n(internal customers) in this study gets reflected in\ncustomer (external customer) satisfaction and loyalty.\nAll the predictions are supported by the results. The\nfour-dimensional job crafting construct explains the\nvariation of as much as 38 per cent in service employee\nwork engagement. All the components reflecting\nvarious job crafting attitudes of service employees\nare found effective antecedents to both the service\nemployee work engagement and the desired customer\noutcomes. The least substantial yet significant indirect\ninfluence of increasing social job resources contributing\nonly 9 and 11 per cent of the total effect on customer\nsatisfaction and customer loyalty, respectively, is the\nonly causal relationship that does not strongly support\nthe hypotheses. However, the direct effect of this\ncrafting attitude is stronger on the customer outcomes,\nthereby justifying more attention from practitioners.\nIn order to improve the customer outcomes as\nconsidered in this study, the management and moni-\ntoring of the crafting attitude and engagement levels\namongst service employees is one of the significant\nimplications of this study. Using survey instruments,\nmanagers can measure each dimension of job crafting\nand work engagement in their organizations, and they\ncan accordingly take corrective measures to improve\nupon. Management can fix reasonable standards for\njob crafting attitudes and work engagement levels to\ncompare the performance of their employees against\nsuch standards at an individual, divisional or busi-\nness-unit level. The comparison can, in turn, become\nthe basis for taking decisions related to employee\ncompensation.\nThe relevant literature on job crafting suggests that\nemployees do not only look for but they also seize\nwhatever possible opportunity they find in their\nway to craft their jobs (Berg et al., 2010). Therefore,\nservice managers must offer all the possible latitude\nto their employees to craft their jobs that suit their\nrequirements, tastes and preferences. Considering\nthe relevant literature and empirical findings of the\nstudy that highlight the importance of job crafting and\nwork engagement, service managers need to develop\nan understanding of the emerging relevance of these\nconcepts to their area of management.\nThe reward system is one of the influential factors that\ntransform employee attitude from the undesired to the\ndesired one. As job crafting includes bringing about\ndesired changes in the relational and task boundaries\nof the job, the management can devise a reward system\nthat encourages desired job crafting and discourages\nundesired job crafting. Furthermore, superiors can\ndesign the job itself in a way that encourages employees\nto craft their jobs as per the desires of the manage-\nment and in a way that suits the customers' require-\nments. Similarly, desired crafting attitudes should\nbe given due importance in performance appraisals\nto encourage beneficial job crafting in the organiza-\ntion. However, care must be taken to see that it finally\nresults in a job that matches employee tastes, aspira-\ntions, experience and interests. The psychological\nsafety to employees that their efforts may not lead them\nto any punitive action or criticism by the management\nshould also be taken care of. Accessibility and availa-\nbility of all required job resources for the desired job\ncrafting and consequent desired work engagement are\nalso crucial. Finally, fair treatment to employees, trust\nin management and in immediate supervisors, appro-\npriate rewards to managers, who encourage crafting\nand engagement culture, and adequate autonomy and\nfeedback to employees are some of the measures advo-\ncated by engagement scholars (e.g., Macey et al., 2009).\nJob crafting scholars have argued that, although the\nconcept is very simple in general, job crafting that\nproves to be beneficial in attaining organizational\nresults is not that simple (Berg et al., 2010). Job crafting\nthat suits employee aspirations but does not bring\ndesired organizational results can be detrimental.\nTherefore, employee education and training to facilitate\nbeneficial crafting is a prerequisite to reap the benefits\nof the crafting. Furthermore, encouraging upward\ncommunication at all levels in the organizations can go\na long way in encouraging job crafting and consequent\nwork engagement. This is on account of the fact that\njob crafting is essentially a bottom-top approach of\njob design, where subordinates are to be encouraged\nto make alterations in their jobs and voice the same\ninformally. Finally, employees may not take active\npart in job crafting unless and until they have trust in\nthe management to feel safe to face any kind of risk\nassociated with the possible failures in job crafting\nAlthough job crafting is proved to have influence on\nemployees' positive job attitudes and their performance\nin the present study, the arrangement of job resources\nas a triggering factor for desired work engagement and\nperformance is another important implication of the\nstudy. Accordingly, the identification of job resources\nspecific to retail banking is very critical for improving\nits performance. For instance, top officials of the bank\ncan personally visit branches and sit together with\nfrontline staff to identify required supervisory support\nand aspirations of employees at the branch level.\nRecognition and feedback to employees is considered\nas significant job resources that facilitate them to work\nbetter and improve upon. In order to ensure their effi-\ncacy, service managers should avoid giving nega-\ntive feedback to frontline employees in front of their\ncustomers; positive feedback in front of customers can\nactually trigger desired employee cooperation and\nmorale. Appropriate rewards and incentives to rein-\nforce employees' desired behaviour are other prom-\nising job resources.\nClarity in communication reduces employee role ambi-\nguity and develops a clear understanding among\nemployees as to what is expected of them by both the\nmanagement and the customers. Regular staff meetings\nrepresenting different layers, departments or divisions\nof the branch can provide employees with an ample\nopportunity to interact and participate, whereby they\nshould be encouraged to identify areas of improve-\nment and to make suggestions for the same. This will\nalso make employees aware about what is happening\nin other departments and help them understand how\ntheir role needs to be integrated with the activities\ntaking place in other divisions.\nThe knowledge of different banking products and\nhow to sell them are the basic required skills for bank\nemployees. These are the technical or motor skills\nwithout which employees cannot perform their jobs\neffectively or respond appropriately to customer needs\nduring service encounters. Therefore, apart from\nusual supervisory coaching and training, seminars,\nworkshops and conferences should be regular features\nof banking organizations, whereby customers,\nmanagement representatives and frontline employees\ncan jointly discuss work-related issues to improve the\noverall operations in their branches. These training\nprogrammes along with other skills must also aim at\nimproving employees' interpersonal communication,\nlistening and cognitive skills, thus enabling them to\nunderstand customers' feeling properly during the\nservice encounter. Furthermore, better opportunities\nfor employee growth and advancement can also\nmotivate employees to improve their knowledge,\nskills and abilities. Adequate empowerment is another\njob resource without which employees cannot use\ntheir skills effectively. They keep customers waiting\nand serve only when they get approval from their\nhigher ups. Additionally, the proper arrangement of\ntechnology and its maintenance should always be\nmanagement's priority both at the headquarter and\nbranch levels to ensure unflinching technological\nsupport to employees.\nEmployee growth and opportunity for advancement\nis another significant job resource. A well-planned\nand spelt-out career-development programme for\nemployees' growth and advancement gives positive\nsignals of support and care to the employees. Senior\nmanagement in consultation with employee represent-\natives can jointly chalk out such plans and decide about\nrequired qualifications and credentials. Management\nshould arrange programmes for their counselling in\naccordance with these progressive stages to facilitate\ntheir growth.\nRESEARCH\nAs with any other investigation, the present work\nalso has some limitations. First, while examining the\nconsequences of job crafting of service employees,\nthis study used four dimensions: increasing struc-\ntural job resources, decreasing hindering job demands,\nincreasing social job resources, and increasing chal-\nlenging job demands as originally suggested by Tims\net al. (2012). Future research work can adopt different\ndimensions of the construct, say, task crafting, rela-\ntional crafting and cognitive crafting (Wrzesniewski &\nDutton, 2001). These dimensions are briefly discussed\nin the earlier part of this paper. Similarly, while using\nthe construct of work engagement, the present study\nconsidered dimensions such as vigour, dedication\nand absorption in the literature review, administra-\ntion of survey instrument and final analysis. However,\nthe analysis examined the overall effects of work\nengagement rather than ascertaining the effects of these\ndimensions separately in the causal relationships.\nSecond, although the present study highlighted the\nsignificance of job crafting in a service context, it did\nnot include the factors that played the causal role\nin encouraging job crafting of service employees.\nSimilarly, while examining the consequences of job\ncrafting of service employees, work engagement was\nthe only mediating variable used in the causal relation-\nships. Future studies, apart from work engagement,\ncan also include several other employee job attitudes\nsuch as their service effort level, commitment, organ-\nizational citizenship behaviour, satisfaction, esprit de\ncorps, involvement, innovative work behaviour, etc.\nAgain customer satisfaction and loyalty were the two\noutcome variables in the present causal relationships.\nVarious other performance measures such as market\nshare, cost of producing services, customer complaints,\ncustomer service quality perception, adaptability, ROI,\ncorporate image and service failure recovery can also\nbe considered.\nThird, the author is concerned about the bias that must\nhave gone into the reaction of customers as the service\nemployees had to distribute and collect the survey\ninstruments from their customers themselves. This is\nwhy the mean scores of four customers reflecting the\nresponse were arithmetically averaged to minimize the\npossible bias. Investigators in future can personally\ndistribute and collect the responses from customers to\navoid this kind of error.\nFinally, management may find it hard in general\nto arrange all the job resources that facilitate both\njob crafting attitudes and consequent work engage-\nment on account of the scarcity of these resources.\nConsequently, they would be interested to know\nspecific variables that trigger the employee crafting\nattitudes and work engagement that best suit their\nspecific work environment. Needless to mention, all\nthe crafting attitudes may not be equally beneficial\nacross industries, sectors and cultures. Thus, future\nresearch studies that can identify the significance of\nvarious crafting attitudes in relation to varying work\nenvironments and required job resources for the same\nmay be a valuable contribution. Furthermore, the find-\nings of the present study in general and with refer-\nence to the magnitude of direct and indirect effects in\nparticular cannot be generalized unless replicated in\nother sectors, cultures, and areas.\nREFERENCES\nBakker, A.
