Civic\neducation without intercultural education risks to ignore an\nimportant part of society, to simplify the reality, and fails to\naddress issues related to the specificities of various groups, as\nwell as the challenges and opportunities of diversity.\nIntercultural education without civic education may run into\ntwo biases: either the approach in which diversity has to be\n\"dealt with\" or the approach in which the intercultural aspects\nare taken into account, but only on the surface, without in-\ndepth analysis of social and political context and without sig-\nnificantcontributiontosocialtransformation.Thisperspective\ndemands us first of all to recognize that reality is plural, com-\nplex, and dynamic, and that interaction is an integral part of\nall lives and cultures. It leads to ensuring mutual respect and\ndevelopment of communities that support each other and to\neliminating relationships based on domination and rejection.\nIn the words of Peter Lauritzen, it sounds like this:\nHe who reduces political language to difference only will come\nout as an individualist and social Darwinist, he who does the\nsame with regard to equality will end up as collectivist. It is only\nby keeping the concepts of difference and equality in balance\nthat one can speak of a fair and just society. (Ohana &\nDiversity is not a new phenomenon, but the perspectives\non diversity, the interpretations, and practices in this area\nrepresent a continuous challenge. Diversity as a concept is\nwidely used in daily life and political discourses. The current\nperspective on diversity shifted from celebration, apprecia-\ntion, or management of diversity to inclusion and develop-\nment of an intercultural society. This perspective moves\nbeyond celebration of diversity and organization of \"folk-\nloric events\" to the creation of sustainable frameworks for\naffirming cultural identity in all aspects of life, as well as\nequal opportunities for personal development and contribu-\ntion to the society in its entirety.\nThere is still a widespread tendency to use culture in polit-\nical discourses for the purpose of exclusion policies (Titley\n& Lentin, 2008). Stereotypes, prejudices, and hate speech are\nbeing used and promoted in the media, in schools, and other\npublic institutions. They act as a filter of information. They\naffect not only the victim of the bias but also every individual\nwho witnesses the bias as well as the perpetrator (Rivers,\n1Intercultural Institute of Timisoara, Romania\nCorresponding Author:\nOanaNestianSandu, Intercultural Institute of Timisoara, str. 16 Decembrie\nEmail: oana.nestian@gmail.com\nCivic and Intercultural Education:\nA Means for Community Development\nand Attitude Change\nOana Nestian Sandu1\n Keywords\ncivic education, intercultural education, Roma, stereotypes, acculturation orientations\n2 SAGE Open\nHaslam and Dovidio (2010) analyzed the researches in the\narea and identified the main factors that enhance and maintain\nbias: personality and individual differences, intergroup con-\nflict, social categorization, and social identity. Education and\nlearning about the subject of the stereotypes or prejudices\nfacilitates the development of acceptance of differences and\ncontributes to social cohesion (Plant & Devine, 2009).\nPeople often resist change due to the cognitive dissonance\nrelated to their previous beliefs and behaviors (Tausch &\nHewstone, 2010). Conscious effort and perseverance are\nneeded for real change to take place. Educational programs\nshould take into account this aspect and should focus not\nonly on giving participants the opportunity to learn about the\nchanges they need to make but also to reflect and to act upon\nthem.\nA real impact of civic and intercultural education implies\n\"moving away from a focus on individual (identity)\ndifference/s towards a focus on finding, through principled\nintercultural discourse, consensus for social action to redress\ninjustice and inequality in the multicultural society\" (Ohana\nIntercultural education offers an alternative to multicul-\n2008). The intercultural approach facilitates the dialogue\nbetween different sociocultural groups, addresses power\nrelations, and encourages positive relation in the society.\nIntercultural education aims to ensure a balance between\nfreedom of expression and respect for cultural diversity,\nacknowledging and respecting diverse practices and\nworldviews.\nThe approach and methods of intercultural education need\nto be oriented toward focusing on \"social action,\" to develop\nparticipants' competences to act for social change that they\nidentified as necessary (Ohana & Otten, 2012) and to take a\nstand against discrimination, racism, and other forms of\nintolerance and social injustice.\nUnderstanding how stereotypes and prejudices affect the\nself, the others, and the human relations is at the forefront of\ndeveloping attitudes and behaviors that promote positive\nsocial change, prevent social injustices, and enhance positive\nrelations. For this reason, there is a need for qualitative and\nquantitative studies that aim at understanding the means\nthrough which intercultural attitudes, abilities, and knowl-\nedge can be developed (Perry & Southwell, 2011).\nThe Intercultural Institute of Timisoara1 has piloted over\nthe years a series of methods aiming at developing teachers'\nand students' intercultural competence and motivation for\nparticipation in local decision-making processes, as well as\nthe development of a nuanced and fair understanding of\nRoma issues and contribution to their social development.\nRoma minority is 1 of the 20 recognized national minorities\nin Romania, one of the most disadvantaged and discrimi-\nnated against. Romania is the European country with the big-\ngest Roma population and a wide diversity of communities,\nsome maintaining a traditional lifestyle, others being almost\ncompletely assimilated, some having a socioeconomic status\nsimilar to that of the majority population, while most of them\nare living in extreme poverty (Rus, 2008).\nA series of public policies are implemented in different\nareas of life, to ensure equal access of Roma people to educa-\ntion and employment, but very little is done to change the\nnegative attitudes of the majority population toward Roma.\nRecent sociological studies confirm the persistence of high\nlevels of negative attitudes toward Roma, even if there are\nsome improvements over the years (Paunescu, 2011;\nA Civic and Intercultural Education\nProgram\nThis study makes an analysis of the impact of a civic and\nintercultural education methodology requiring students to\nanalyze the situation of the Roma community at local revel\nand formulate a public policy proposal related to an issue\naffecting members of Roma communities.\nschools, finalized with a public presentation at the Romanian\nParliament, and at county level in 2012 in 9 schools. The aim\nof the program is to promote competent and responsible par-\nticipation with government at all levels. The program helps\nparticipants learn how to monitor and influence public policy\nwhile developing support for democratic values and princi-\nples. The program takes place over a 3-month period in which\nteachers attend a training course and implement a project with\ntheir students. It is based on a methodology developed at\ninternational level in the CIVITAS Network1, adapted to\nRomanian realities and developed by the Intercultural\nInstitute of Timisoara to include the intercultural dimension.\nThis method offers students a framework to develop a\nthorough understanding of the situation of Roma communi-\nties and to overcome stereotypes and prejudices. It addresses,\nat the same time, the need to stimulate the civic engagement\nand constructive attitudes based on democracy and human\nrights.\nThe main activities implemented in the program by the\nstudents, under the coordination of their teacher, are as fol-\nlows: (a) analysis of the problems of the local Roma com-\nmunity; (b) selection of a problem for in-depth study by the\nclass, a problem that can be solved through local public poli-\ncies; (c) collecting information about the problem from vari-\nous sources, including members of the Roma community,\npublic institutions, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs),\nspecialists, and analysis of possible solutions; (d) drafting a\npublic policy that could solve the problem; (e) developing an\naction plan to influence public authorities to adopt the public\npolicy proposed by the students; (f) organizing a showcase in\nwhich students present their projects; and (g) reflecting on\nthe learning experience. Classes involved in the program are\nthen invited to present their projects in a public event attended\nby public authorities and the media.\n1http://www.civiced.org/programs/civitas\nPrior to the implementation of the activities with students,\nteachers attend a blended learning training course, which has\nthe following objectives:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 understanding of the way in which public institutions\nfunction, the decision-making procedures, and the\nrole of citizens in a democratic society;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 development of intercultural sensitivity to understand\nthe benefits and challenges of diversity, especially\nrelated to the fact that:\n|\n|\nignoring cultural differences is not a solution,\n|\n|\nimposing an ethnocultural belonging on someone\nis unacceptable,\n|\n|\ndifferent ethnocultural belongings do not neces-\nsarily imply visible differences,\n|\n|\ncommon ethnocultural belongings do not neces-\nsarily imply homogeneity, and\n|\n|\nnot all cultural practices are acceptable in a human\nrights framework;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 in-depth understanding of the situation of Roma com-\nmunities in Romania; and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 learning to implement the program's specific civic\nand intercultural methodology with students.\nAs part of the program, the students learn about their Roma\npeople living in their neighborhood. Most often people rely\non stereotypes when interacting with the Roma, and usually\navoid getting to know their Roma neighbors. The students\nare guided through a process in which the output is a public\npolicy solution to one of the problems of the Roma commu-\nnity. This program offers them the opportunity to interact\nwith members of the Roma community, to learn about the\nproblems they are struggling with, and to view them as equal\ncitizens. Students find out that some of the problems the\nRoma are facing are very similar to the ones the rest of the\nsociety is facing, while others are very different, often due to\nthe cultural specificities and usually the poor living\nconditions.\nThe impact of the program is evaluated both at teachers'\nlevel, as well as at students' level. Through a pretest\u00adposttest\nmethodology, the teachers' and students' stereotypes and\nattitudes toward the culturally different (respectively, Roma\nminority) are being assessed before and after they are\ninvolved in the program.\nAttitudes Toward Roma Minority\nMethod and Sample\nThis study uses a pretest\u00adposttest design to measure the\nchanges in teachers' and students' orientations of acculturation\nand stereotypes toward Roma and Romanians. A group of 33\nteachers and 250 students, from 20 schools, belonging mainly\nto the majority population participated in this study. About half\nof them participated in the civic and intercultural education\nprogram (experimental group), while the other half participated\nin a civic education program using a similar methodology but\nwithout intercultural component (control group).\nInstruments\nDrawing on previous research by Berry, Bourhis, Moise,\nPerreault, and Sen\u00e9cal (1997) proposed the following accul-\nturation orientations of majority members--integrationism,\nindividualism, assimilationism, segregationism, and exclu-\nsionism--and developed a scale to measure these accultura-\ntionorientations.Basically,theseorientationsofacculturation\nrepresent the combination of possible answers to the follow-\ning two questions: (a) How acceptable it is for the majority\npopulation that the minority (Roma, in our case) maintain\ntheir culture? and (b) How acceptable it is for the majority\npopulation that the minority (Roma, in our case) adopt the\nculture of the majority population? (see Figure 1).\nIntegrationism refers to the valorization of maintenance\nof certain aspects of minority identity and willingness to\nmodify own institutional practices and certain aspects of\nmajority culture to facilitate integration of minority groups.\nAssimilationism refers to desire to have minorities give up\ntheir cultural/identity characteristics to adopt the cultural/\nidentity characteristics of majority. Segregationism repre-\nsents tolerance for the minority culture/identity as long as\nthey live separately, in specific neighborhoods or regions, and\ndo not mix with the majority population. Exclusionism means\nno tolerance for the minorities'culture/identity and belief that\ncertain groups can never assimilate within majority commu-\nnity. There is also another acculturation orientation that com-\npletely ignores cultural, religious, and linguistic belonging\nwhile focusing on personal characteristics--individualism.\nThe scale developed based on this model by Bourhis and\nMontreuil (2005) is not intended to categorize individuals as\nHow acceptable it is for the majority population that the minority (Roma, in\nour case) maintain their culture?\nHow acceptable it is for the majority\npopulation that the minority (Roma,\nin our case) adopt the culture of the\nmajority population?\nYES Integrationism Assimilationism\nNO Segregrationism Exclusionism\nFigure 1. Acculturation orientations of majority population toward Roma.\n4 SAGE Open\nbeing integrationist, individualist, assimilationist, segrega-\ntionist, or exclusionist. This scale is intended to assess the\nextent to which individuals endorse each of the acculturation\norientations, depending on the specific group being consid-\nered. The teachers' acculturation orientations are measured\nwith regard to six areas of life: culture, customs, work,\nendogamy/exogamy, language, and neighborhood. The stu-\ndents' acculturation orientations are measured with regard to\nfive areas of life: customs, educational activities, friends,\nlanguage, and neighborhood.\nTaking into account the potential of social desirability of\nthe Host Community Acculturation Scale, another instru-\nment was used to have a more nuanced perspective of the\nteachers' and students' attitudes toward Roma. A list of attri-\nbutes was used to measure the stereotypes of students and\nteachers toward Roma and Romanians.\nThe data collected were analyzed in SPSS using the\npaired-samples t test.\nResults\nThe analysis of the results in the pretest samples of teachers\nand students shows a medium level of exclusionism (1.74/5),\nslightly higher results on individualism (4.15/5) and integra-\ntionism (3.88/5). There were no significant differences\nbetween the experimental group and the control group in the\npretest phase. At first sight, these results can be slightly\nencouraging, with pretty high level of integrationism and\nquite low level of exclusionism. However, the analysis of the\nresults regarding the stereotypes shows that the entire sample\nassociates significantly more negative attributes with Roma\n(4 attributes associated significantly more with Roma than\nwith Romanians) and more positive attributes with\nRomanians (11 attributes associated significantly more with\nRomanians than with Roma). There was no negative attri-\nbute associated more with Romanians than with Roma and\nthere was only 1 positive attribute associated more with\nRoma than Romanians--musicians. These results are com-\nparable with the results of various studies done at national\nlevel which show that the majority population has mainly\nnegative attitudes toward Roma (Rus, 2008), validating\ntherefore the sample used in this study.\nThe participation in the civic and intercultural program\ngenerated significant changes in the acculturation orienta-\ntions of teachers and students after their participation in the\nprogram, both compared with the pretest phase and with the\ncontrol group.\nRegarding changes in the orientations of acculturation,\nafter the implementation of the civic and intercultural pro-\nThe fact that teachers have lower scores on assimilationist\norientation shows they understood the importance of main-\ntaining and affirming cultural identity and expect much less\nfrom the Roma people to give up their cultural identity to\nadopt the cultural identity of the majority community. This\nattitudinal change of teachers could have contributed to the\nattitudinal change of students. Not only are students less\nindividualist but there are also significant changes in relation\nto specific areas of life.\nStudents have, after the implementation of the program,\nhigher scores on the segregationist orientation regarding\nschool activities and friends. They are also less exclusionist\nmeans they are less inclined to consider that Roma should\nnot attend the same school as them, and less integrationist,\nconsider them full members of the school community. Most\nof the statistical significant changes regarding students'\nacculturation orientations are related to the domain of school\nactivities, which means that their participation in the project\nand activities of the program had a direct impact on this\ndimension, without being extrapolated to the other dimen-\nsions. The fact that the teachers have lower levels of assimi-\nlationism shows they understood the importance of cultural\nidentity and focused on it. At the same time, students under-\nstood the importance of culture but failed to understand the\nimportance of dialogue--which is shown in their higher lev-\nels of segregationism.\nThere were no significant changes generated by the partici-\npation in the program of the control group in general, just on\nspecific domains of life. These changes are in the sense of\nhigher scores regarding segregationism and assimilationism in\ncertain domains of life. For example, the teachers were more\nTherefore, even if the results show fewer changes in the\nacculturation orientations than initially expected, the fact\nthat in the control group the changes were in the other direc-\ntion (more segregationists and more assimilationists) leads to\nthe conclusion that the course had an important contribution\nto the development of more positive attitudes of the majority\ncommunity toward Roma community and that the need for\nthis type of programs is even greater. It appears that without\norganized educational processes, the tendency is to develop\nhigher levels of assimilationism and segregationism.\nThere are also significant changes regarding the stereo-\ntypes of teachers and students toward Roma and Romanians.\nA comparative analysis was made between teachers'and stu-\ndents' stereotypes of Roma and Romanians before and after\nthe course. Before the course, teachers associated mainly\npositive attributes with Romanians (11 attributes associated\nstatistically significant more with Romanians than with\nRoma) and mainly negative attributes with Roma (4 attri-\nbutes associated statistically significant more with Roma\nthan with Romanians). After the course, they still associate\npositive attributes more with Romanians than with Roma (10\nattributes associated statistically significant more with\nRomanians than with Roma), but they associate just 1 nega-\ntive attribute statistically significant more with Roma than\nwith Romanians.At the same time, the teachers in the control\ngroup continue to associate negative attributes with Roma\neven after the participation in the program (7 attributes asso-\nciated statistically significant more with Roma than with\nRomanians). The changes in the students' stereotypes were\nnot so significant.\nWe also made a comparative analysis of the students' and\nteachers' stereotypes toward Roma before and after the\ncourse, to have a more nuanced image of the results pre-\nsented above. This analysis shows that there are changes in\nstudents'stereotypes in the sense of associating certain nega-\ntive attributes to a smaller extent with Roma after the course\nthan before the course (there are statistically significant dif-\nferences on three negative attributes) and certain positive\nattributes to a larger extent (there are statistically significant\ndifferences on three positive attributes). Even if there were\nnot many significant differences in the Roma\u00adRomanian\ncomparison, there are differences between the degree to\nwhich students associate attributes to Roma before and after\nthe course. And this difference is in the sense of associating\nless negative and more positive attributes with Roma.\nTherefore, we can state that participation in a training\ncourse and implementation of a civic intercultural program\ncontribute to diminishing teachers' and students' negative\nattitudes toward Roma. These changes represent important\nsteps in the process of Roma inclusion and in diminishing the\nnegative perception of the majority population toward Roma.\nConclusion\nThe results are consistent with the results of a previous study\ncarried on by the Intercultural Institute, using qualitative\nmethods in a project involving cooperation between Roma\nand non-Roma young people. In that study, after their partici-\npation in the program, non-Roma participants did not have\nnecessarily an overall better attitude about Roma, but they\nhad a more nuanced understanding of the situation and of the\nrelationships between Roma and the rest of the society and\nwere able to overcome certain stereotypes (Jivan, Rus, &\nThis research proves, once again, that attitudinal changes\nare difficult to obtain and even more difficult to measure.\nByram underlines the challenges related to the evaluation of\nattitudes and values--While abilities and knowledge can be\nadequately measured, the evaluation of attitudes and values\ncreates a series of technical and moral difficulties (Bandura,\n2003). The instruments need to take into account, on one\nhand, the social desirability and, on the other hand, the con-\ntext and the purpose for which they are applied. This perspec-\ntive was taken into account in the design and implementation\nof the study, as well as in the analysis of the results. For this\nreason, the conclusions are cautiously presented.\nThe results of this study show that punctual interventions\naiming at increasing intercultural competence may have a\npositive impact but a rather limited impact. To have a better\nunderstanding of the way in which acculturation orientations\nare changing through educational activities, it would be neces-\nsary to compare the impact of various types of interventions.\nOne of the limits of the study is the fact that the relation\nbetween the attitudes of teachers and those of students was\nnot analyzed. We believe that it is important to study this\nrelation in future research to identify whether sole imple-\nmentation of educational practices, regardless of teachers'\npersonal attitudes, can contribute to the development of posi-\ntive attitudes of students toward diversity or whether it is\nabsolutely necessary that teachers attitudes be positive. In\nthe first case, educational policies should focus on equipping\nteachers with educational tools to ensure an integrationist\napproach in education, whereas in the second case, the main\nactivities need to aim at the development of teachers' inter-\ncultural competence.\nAnother limit of the study is the fact that teachers have\nvoluntarily applied to participate in the program, having\ntherefore an intrinsic motivation to participate and interest in\nthe subject. Thus, we do not know to what extent the same\nresults could be obtained with a group of teachers who are\nnot interested in the subject. Students' participation, how-\never, was not voluntary, as the activities of the project were\npart of the school curriculum.\nThe results of this research can offer relevant information\nfor decision-making bodies regarding public policies in the\nfield of education. For example, practices like the inclusion\nof information about Roma in the history manuals can not\nonly lead to a decrease of exclusionism but could also lead to\nan increase of segregationism, and it is therefore important\nthat they are accompanied by activities focused on dialogue,\ninteraction, and human rights\u00adbased approaches.\nThe European Commission and other national and inter-\nnational bodies finance various programs in the field of civic\nand intercultural education for community development. As\nmuch as there is a need for these programs, there is also a\nneed for extended research to measure the impact of these\nprograms and to identify best practices of coherent, flexible,\nand sustainable approaches in education.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNote\n1.
