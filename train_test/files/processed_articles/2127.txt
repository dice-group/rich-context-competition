Practice-based approaches are needed in\naddition to public health interventions based on effec-\ntive alcohol and tobacco prevention programs during the\nearlier adolescent years.\nclinicians who pre-\nscribe (eg, dentists),\nand public health pro-\nfessionals know about\nrecent increasing trends of prescribing\npain relievers.1 Concurrent evidence\ndemonstrates increased use of these com-\npounds to get high or for other unap-\nproved indications outside the boundar-\nies set by prescribing clinicians (ie,\nextramedical use), including evidence of\nfirst use in late childhood and early\nadolescence.1-4 Rates of hazards, such as\noverdose deaths, also have increased.1\nCoverage of these topics in most me-\ndia outlets, press releases, journal ar-\nticles, and government reports focuses at-\ntention on high school seniors and youth\nin the post\u00adsecondary school years. Nev-\nertheless, the risk of hazardous conse-\nquences may be greatest when extramedi-\ncal use of prescription pain relievers starts\nduring early adolescence.3-5\nIn the present study of recent experi-\nyears in the United States, we sought to\nidentify when youth are most likely to start\nusing prescription pain relievers to get high\nor for other unapproved indications. Based\non epidemiological estimates previously\npublished,6,7 we anticipated a peak risk late\nin high school or soon thereafter but made\nallowances for discovery of a peak risk in\nMETHODS\nSurvey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) pub-\nlic use files. The NSDUH uses a cross-sectional\ndesign to select a different nationally represen-\ntative random sample of the US civilian nonin-\nstitutionalized population each year.

Participation levels\ntend to be acceptable, often at 70% or better during the years un-\nder study after parental consent and adolescent assent were se-\ncured.8 TheNSDUHparticipantscompletedastandardizedaudio-\nenhancedcomputer-assistedself-interview(meanduration,about\n60 minutes) at a private location within or near the home after\ninformed consent processes approved by institutional review\nboards for protection of human participants.\nOne audio-enhanced computer-assisted self-interview mod-\nule asked about using prescription pain relievers for the \"ex-\nperience or feelings\" they caused or if \"not prescribed for you\"\n(ie, to get high or for other unapproved indications outside the\nboundaries of what the prescribing clinician might intend). Spe-\ncific NSDUH modules and items are available online (http://oas\n.samhsa.gov/nsduh/methods.cfm). The eAppendix (http://www\n.archpediatrics.com) lists the standardized survey items, question\nprompts, and names of compounds covered.8\nself-report assessment indicated that they had never engaged\nin extramedical use of prescription pain relievers before the year\nin which they were assessed for the NSDUH; 18 852 partici-\npants (13.6%) did not contribute to the study estimates for in-\ncidence of use because they had already initiated such use be-\nfore the year in which they were surveyed. As of the date of\nassessment, participants in the estimation sample were never\nusers (who were at risk of starting use in a later year) or were\nnewly incident users (who had just started to use). Stratum-\nspecific estimates of the cumulative incidence proportion can\nbe calculated as a ratio of the number of newly incident users\ndivided by the sum of the number of never users plus the num-\nber of newly incident users. With age as a marker of cohort mem-\nbership, the result is a set of risk estimates, year by year and\nage by age, which makes it possible to trace the experience of\nindividual cohorts over time without a repeated-measures sur-\nvey design.10 For example, the youngest cohort sampled was\nin 2006. The eTable gives unweighted numbers for each nu-\nmerator and denominator for each age and year cell. The eAp-\npendix describes in detail the approach used to identify newly\nincident users, past-onset users, and never users.\nNote that these are independently drawn nationally repre-\nsentative samples, year by year. A new sampling process oc-\ncurs each year. As such, this project is not a longitudinal study\nof specific individuals with successive assessments over time,\nwhich might introduce sample attrition during the follow-up\nperiod, as well as problems such as measurement reactivity.11\nInstead, the resulting cumulative incidence proportions con-\nvey the risk estimate of starting extramedical use of prescrip-\ntion pain relievers based on the epidemiological record of a medi-\ncal outcome combined with information about the denominators\nat risk (such as Frost11 used in his classic epidemiological re-\nsearch to estimate age-specific and cohort-specific risk of tu-\nberculosis mortality on the basis of death certificate records).\nA summary of other features of this research approach based\non survey data has been previously published.12\nStatistical analysis and an estimation approach appropriate\nfor complex survey designs and sampling weights (represent-\ning an estimate of the total number in the target population)\nused commercially available software (STATA, version 11; Stata-\nCorp LP), with a subpopulation approach appropriate for the\nstratification of newly incident users, past-onset users, and never\nusers.8 The meta-analysis summary estimates reported are not\nsimple means; they were calculated using a random-effects meta-\nanalysis software program (STATA, version 11) that weights\neach year by the inverse of its variance. Standard errors for the\nestimates are small because of the large NSDUH samples.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 summarizes the study sample. The main study\nestimates are given in Table 2, including tracing of in-\ndividual cohorts and age-specific patterns.

Nonetheless, the peak risk is concentrated at about\nextramedical use (meta-analysis summary estimate,\nyears and for age 19 to 21 years, as seen in the Figure,\nconfirmed by tracing the experience of individual\ncohorts across the survey years under study (ie, diago-\nnally in Table 2).\nBeforeanydetaileddiscussionorspeculationaboutthese\nfindings, several limitations must be acknowledged, in-\ncludingtheself-reportcharacterofthenationalsamplesur-\nvey data.

None-\ntheless, we tried to constrain this source of error by fo-\ncusing attention on youth who are just starting to use,\nmost of whom do not develop dependence problems or\nbecome disengaged from their family or from society at\nIn addition, a counterbalanced strength is that this sur-\nvey is not restricted to youth who attend school; its sample\nis based on probability sampling of dwelling unit resi-\ndents within each sampled community, as required for\nnational representation of all youth. Each survey's sam-\npling frame has included youth irrespective of whether\nthey maintain student status, have dropped out of school,\nare employed in the labor force, or are unemployed.\nNotwithstanding such limitations, the NSDUH esti-\nmates seem strong relative to available alternatives, but in\ntheory useful comparative estimates might be extracted\nfrom data gathered in surveys of youth who attend school.\nFor example, as many as 80% of youth aged 16 years in\nthe United States have not dropped out and continue to\nattend secondary schools (NSDUH data not shown). As\nan example of other estimates of this type, the US Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention conducts a Na-\ntional Youth Risk Behavior Survey, with survey ques-\ntions about pain relievers introduced for the first time in\ndrug without a physician's prescription.14 However, the ob-\nserved major increase from 15% to 26% across these sec-\nondary school years cannot be ascribed specifically to pre-\nscriptionpainrelieversbecausethesurvey'ssinglequestion\non this topic does not distinguish prescription pain re-\nlievers from other prescribed psychoactive medicines, such\nas alprazolam and methylphenidate.14\nBy comparison, the US Monitoring the Future study9\nis more informative because it asked 8th, 10th, and 12th\ngraders about the use of narcotics other than heroin, with\nan explicit list that named methadone hydrochloride, co-\ndeine, pantazocine lactate (Talwin), morphine sulfate,\nopium, meperidine hydrochloride (Demerol), lauda-\nnum, and paregoric until 2002, when the list was ex-\npanded to include other compounds such as oxycodone\n(OxyContin), acetaminophen-hydrocodone (Vicodin), ac-\netaminophen\u00adoxycodone hydrochloride (Percocet or Per-\ncodan), and hydromorphone hydrochloride (Dilaudid),\nas well as (unlisted) narcotics other than heroin.\nUsing school survey data, we aimed to trace recent ex-\nperience of individual cohorts for prescription pain re-\nlievers (eg, comparing use by 8th graders in 2004 with\nwith age was found)15 and in recently published work on\ncannabis.16 However, we learned that the data for 8th and\n10th graders and estimates on these compounds have not\nbeen released in the survey publications; the only data\navailable to researchers outside the survey team are from\nhigh school seniors. The survey team acknowledges po-\ntential biases in their estimates on these topics, includ-\ning the fact that the data are retrospective from 12th grade\nbackward over time (and past onset of use might have\noccurred as early as the 6th grade), in addition to biases\nassociated with absenteeism (estimated to be roughly 20%\non the days of survey completion) and school dropout\n(estimated to be an additional 15%).9 Notwithstanding\nsuch limitations, the published data based on retrospec-\ntive reports of high school seniors seems to be congru-\nent with the evidence seen in the Figure and Table 2\nherein. Specifically, in the school survey estimates from\ngrade is not a marker of the peak risk. Rather, evaluated\nretrospectively over these years, more high school se-\nniors had started to use narcotics other than heroin be-\ntween 9th grade and 10th grade and between 10th grade\nand 11th grade than had been true for the transition year\nSome prior national community sample reports,10 in-\ncluding an important article4 based on participants aged\ndence peak might exist in early midadolescence: 13.3 years\nwas the estimated mean age at onset of use for youth aged\n12 to 17 years who had used pain relievers during the\nyear before NSDUH assessment.4 In contrast to research\non youth aged 12 to 17 years, for whom the latest pos-\nsible age at onset is 17 years, the community sample for\nour project included youth aged 18 to 21 years and youth\naged 12 to 17 years, allowing for later onset. Perhaps most\nimportant, our project's focus was on newly incident ex-\ntramedical users of prescription pain relievers (ie, youth\nwho had just started to use these compounds during the\nyear in which they were surveyed). When an analysis is\nbased on all persons with a lifetime history of drug use\nor on all recently active users (eg, those with any use in\nthe year before the assessment), the resulting estimates\nare based on the aggregate of experience across multiple\ncohorts and years, including the experience of drug us-\ners who have been using for many years (and who may\nnot have a clear memory of the exact age at first use).\nOne advantage of focusing on newly incident users is a\nconstrained reliance on long-term memory about age at\nonset many years ago. In this project, the elapsed time\nfrom the initial use to the date of the interview was al-\nways constrained to be less than 12 months.\nConsistent with our focus on newly incident use, we\nexcluded 13.6% of the NSDUH participants aged 12 to\nmulative incidence because they had engaged in extra-\nmedical use of prescription pain relievers during the years\nbefore the year in which they were surveyed (and were\nno longer considered at risk of newly incident use). This\nexcluded group of lifetime extramedical users of pre-\nscription pain relievers represents roughly 1 in 7 of the\nyouth in this nationally representative sample (not in-\ncluding newly incident users). While such lifetime use\nestimates can be important indicators of the magnitude\nof a problem, patterns of newly incident use more clearly\nhighlight when the most effective time might be to pre-\nvent first use or to intervene during the earliest stages of\nAppreciating that recent school survey data provide\nmodest external confirmation of this project's nation-\nally representative sample evidence, we draw attention\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association.

With the peak risk at age 16 years\nand a notable acceleration in risk between ages 13 and\n14 years, any strict focus on college students or 12th grad-\ners might be an example of too little too late in the clini-\ncal practice sector and in public health work. There is\nreason to strengthen earlier school-based prevention pro-\ngrams and early outreach along the lines of effective\nschool-based alcohol and tobacco public health initia-\ntives. Even so, with as many as 15% of youth not attend-\ning school during the observed midadolescence peak risk,\nthere also is reason to design coordinated practice-\nbased efforts by pediatricians, dentists, and other pre-\nscribing clinicians in the patient care and public health\nsectors. Via coordination of school-based and practice-\nbased initiatives, it may be possible to reduce the risks\nassociated with youth starting to use prescription pain\nrelievers to get high or for other unapproved indica-\ntions outside the boundaries of what a prescribing cli-\nnician has intended. Of course, because an estimated 20%\nto 40% of high school students say that narcotics other\nthan heroin are fairly easy or very easy to get,9,23 it is im-\nportant to consider not only underuse and overuse of pre-\nscription pain relievers but also mechanisms of diver-\nsion as might be controlled in a manner that will reduce\nassociated public health hazards.\nCorrespondence: James C.
