Small proportions of minority elders in\neach sample have limited our understanding of service use by minorities. This research sought to determine (1) the\nextent to which minorities have restricted use of community long-term care services as a result of socioeconomic\nstatus,family structure, and health status, and (2) the replicability and validity of results across three national surveys:\nSupplement on Aging, National Long-Term Care, and National Medical Expenditure. Results indicate no bivariate or\nmultivariate differences between African American, Hispanic, or Whitefrail olderpersons in use of community long-\nterm services. Living arrangements, Medicaid use, and overall health andfunctional status wereprimary predictors of\nservice use. Taking methodological limitations into account, the results suggest similarity in processes influencing use\nof community long-term care servicesfor African American and White older persons.\nTHE policy dilemma of maintaining fiscal constraints in\nthe face of growing long-term care needs requires ade-\nquate data on the social and health characteristics of all older\npersons. The underrepresentation of minority persons in\nnational surveys of the elderly seriously limits our under-\nstanding of how minorities use informal and formal care\nservices. These groups are a major public policy interest\nbecause they contain high proportions of economically dis-\nadvantaged persons who rely on publicly financed services\n(Chen, 1991). Public financing has traditionally supported\ninstitution-based services, but the appropriateness of this\nemphasis is under debate. Home- and community-based\nservices have expanded as a result of rising costs of nursing\nhome care, shifts in Medicare and Medicaid policies, and\nindividuals' desires to remain in the community as long as\npossible.\nA series of national surveys since 1982 have examined the\nhealth and welfare needs of older persons. Yet, the propor-\ntion of minority elders included within each sample is\nrelatively small, limiting development of service-use\nmodels. We address this limitation by developing compara-\ntive models for multiple data sets that examine two research\nobjectives:\n1. To determine the effect of socioeconomic status, family\nstructure, and health status on long-term care service use\nby minority groups.\n2. To determine the replicability and validity of results\nacross three national data sets: Supplement on Aging\n(SOA), the National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTC),\nand the National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES).\nAfter a review of the prevalence and predictors of use of\ncommunity long-term care services, we discuss the advan-\ntages of using multiple data sets to replicate results. We\npresent the results of logistic regressions of determinants of\nuse of in-home services, senior centers, and any community-\nbased long-term care service by data set. Because of insuf-\nficient data, these results are limited to comparisons between\nAfrican Americans and White older persons. We then pool\nthe results across data sets to include comparisons with\nHispanics.\nPrevalence of Use of Community Long-Term Care Services\nA review of available data about use of long-term care\nservices illustrates the lack of adequate minority compari-\nsons. As is well known, 70-80 percent of the care of\nnoninstitutionalized frail older persons is provided by family\nmembers, friends, and other informal supports, with supple-\nmentary assistance from formal services (Horowitz, 1985;\nStone, Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987). This pattern applies to\nracial/ethnic groups as well, although there are race and\nethnic variations in the composition of the informal support\nstructure (Cantor, 1979; Mindel, Wright, Jr., and Starrett,\nton, 1990). Depending on definition of population at risk and\nservices counted, national estimates of formal service use\nhowever, rely exclusively on formal helpers. Estimates based\non statewide surveys or local populations tend to be higher,\nreflecting in part differences in sampling, service definitions,\nand geographical variability in service availability (Coward\nDetailed prevalence data by type of service confirm the\nrelatively low use of formal services by all frail older\npersons. The 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey\nprovided the most comprehensive national estimates of types\nof services used by persons ages 65 and older with any\nfunctional difficulties (Short and Leon, 1990). Home care\n(i.e., homemaker services, home health aides, and other in-\nhome medical services) was the most commonly used ser-\nvice (19.7%), with less than 10 percent using senior centers,\ncongregate meals, home meal preparation, phone checks, or\ntransportation. The most frequent users were 85 years or\nolder, were female, lived alone, had difficulty in several\nactivities of daily living, and were likely to be covered by\nMedicaid. Over 50 percent of those who had difficulty in\nthree or more ADLs did not receive any formal services\n(Short and Leon, 1990). Their report, however, did not\nanalyze racial/ethnic group differences.\nNational prevalence estimates of service use among el-\nderly African Americans are available from the SOA and\nNLTC surveys. Kart (1991) used a broad definition of long-\nterm care services that included help from relatives, friends,\npaid professionals, or community services. Approximately\n15 percent of aged African Americans received help with\nspecial meals, used senior centers or transportation services;\n25 percent received help with heavy work, shopping, or\nhomemaker services; and less than 5 percent used home\nchronically disabled older persons, 17 percent of African\nAmericans and 18 percent of Whites had informal and\nformal sources of assistance with ADL and IADL tasks.\nAbout 4 percent of both races used only formal services for\nassistance (Miller, McFall, and Campbell, 1994).\nLittle consistent national information is available about\ncommunity long-term care service use by Hispanic elders.\nEstimates of use vary. Some studies suggest no difference in\nuse of formal services between Hispanic older persons and\nnon-Hispanic Whites (Hing and Bloom, 1990), and others\nidentify less use by Hispanic elders (Kemper, 1992). Defini-\ntional problems exist as a result of the internal heterogeneity\nand geographical clustering of the major subgroups within\nthe Hispanic culture (Giachello, Bell, and Aday, 1983;\nMarkides, Coreil, and Rogers, 1989). Significant differ-\nences in use of long-term care services among Mexican\nAmericans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans were noted in two\nnational surveys of Hispanic older persons (Lacayo, 1980;\nCommunity-based studies of race differences in service\nuse also produce inconsistent results. A review of behavioral\nstudies of a variety of health and long-term care services\nprovided little evidence that race or ethnicity had a main\neffect on use of health care services in the multivariate\nOther studies reported that non-Whites were more likely to\nuse home care services than Whites (Bass and Noelker,\nStarrett, 1986). Thus, there is little evidence of unequal\naccess by race to community long-term care services.\nPredictors of Long-Term Care Service Use\nThe decision to use formal services is complex. It presup-\nposes definition of need of help, knowledge of sources of\nhelp, and subjective cost/benefit ratios of use by frail older\npersons and their family caregivers. Many empirical studies\nof service use draw on the conceptual framework of the\nAndersen behavioral model (Andersen and Aday, 1978; An-\ndersen and Newman, 1973). This framework views use of\nhealth care services as a function of predisposing, enabling,\nand need characteristics. The most consistent results of stud-\nies using this model are that: (a) need for service because of\nhealth and functional status largely drives use of medical\nservices and, to a slightly smaller extent, use of long-term\nand (b) once need for service has been taken into account,\nage, marital status, living arrangements, and income tend to\nbe the most significant predictors of use of formal services\n(Soldo, Agree, and Wolf, 1989). Summaries discussing the\nmajor predictors of long-term care services in specific mi-\nnority groups also reveal inconsistent patterns of use (e.g.,\nAfrican American elderly: Jackson, 1988b; Taylor et al.,\nCuriel, 1988; comparative summaries: Stanford and Torres-\nGil, 1991; Minority Elders: Longevity, Economics, and\nWe focus on three classes of predictors from the behav-\nioral model: (1) family composition and household structure\n(predisposing); (2) income and insurance (enabling); and (3)\nhealth and functional status (need). Minority groups tend to\nhave larger extended families and more multigenerational\ncontacts, although variations exist within and between so-\ncioeconomic levels within groups (Markides and Mindel,\nDeimling, and Barresi, 1988). Older Whites and African\nAmericans are more likely to live alone (approximately\n32%) compared to 22 percent of elderly Mexican Americans\nand other Hispanics, and 17 percent of Puerto Ricans (Angel\nOlder African American and Hispanic adults compared to\ntheir White counterparts have greater poverty and less edu-\npoor; the rate for Whites was 10.1 percent, for African\n(Chen, 1991). Sources of income also vary by race/\nethnicity. For example, Whites and African Americans are\nmore likely to receive Social Security than Hispanics. About\n5 percent of elderly Whites receive public assistance, com-\npared to over 25 percent of African Americans and 22\npercent of Hispanics (Chen, 1991). By most measures, the\nhealth of older African Americans and Hispanics is poorer\nthan that of older Whites (Manuel, 1988; Jackson, J. J.,\nences indicate the need for long-term care and the availabil-\nity of informal support within each racial/ethnic group.\nBecause the three national data sets analyzed in this study\ncontain detailed measures of household composition, family\nstructure, economic status, and health status, we will be able\nto address the important question of how community long-\nterm care choices made by African American and Hispanic\nfrail older persons are influenced by their economic well-\nbeing and by family structure.\nAdvantages of Multiple Data Sets\nExamination of results across national studies in compara-\ntive individual analyses and in pooled analyses provides\nverification of similarities and differences in patterns of\nservice use. Pooling data allows for examination of popula-\ntions insufficiently represented in an individual data set.\nDespite differences in sampling frames and question design,\nthere are real gains to be realized from the use of multiple\ndata sources. If findings replicate within reasonable limits\nacross surveys with design and mechanical differences, we\ncan have more confidence in the results. Although differ-\nences in question wording are known to have effects upon\nestimates of rates (Wiener et al., 1990), the extent to which\nthese differences affect estimates of associations and causal\neffects is less clear. For example, research on status attain-\nment, in which the basic model has been replicated across\nmany different kinds of sampling and measurement\nschemes, shows that the results are amazingly robust (Camp-\nbell, 1983). If similar results can be shown in the present\ncase, confidence in their reliability will be enhanced. Even\nmore importantly, if results are not similar, our ability to\nbase policy directions on these data may be suspect.\nMETHOD\nSample\nWe selected subsamples of cases from each data set,\nguided by the goal of ensuring as much comparability in\nsample definition as possible. Our analytic sample consisted\nof individuals aged 70 and older who had at least one\nlimitation in ADL or IADL. In this way, we matched the age\nrestriction in SOA and the sampling frames defined by frailty\nused by the NLTC and the long-term care supplement of the\nNMES. Since community long-term care services are most\nheavily used by older and frailer persons, these restrictions\nare appropriate. The comparative analyses within data set\nare restricted to African Americans and Whites because of\nthe relatively few Hispanics in the SOA in = 87) and NMES\nsamples (n = 34) and no defined Hispanics in the NLTC (see\nTable 1). A power analysis indicated that relevant compari-\nsons could be made between African American and White\nsubsamples in all three data sets. Because we did not have\nsufficient numbers of Hispanics in any data set for compara-\ntive analysis, we combined data from all three data sets to\nexamine Hispanic/African American/White differences.\nSOA. -- The Supplement on Aging (SOA), a supplement\nto the 1984 annual Health Interview Survey (HIS),\ntelephone-surveyed community-dwelling individuals aged\n55 years or older. The SOA followed up those persons aged\nFitti and Kovar, 1987, for details on the SOA sample design\nand procedures). In this report, we used weighted data based\ndrew on the parent Health Interview Survey for our measures\nof health self-report and income to minimize missing data\nand proxy reports. The SOA analytic subsample included\nWhite (unweighted n = 2,465) and African American (un-\nweighted n = 260) respondents.\nNLTC. -- The National Long-Term Care survey (NLTC)\ninvestigated the demographic characteristics, health and\nfunctioning, and patterns of assistance of a national sample\nof noninstitutionalized frail persons 65 years of age or older.\nA random sample of approximately 36,000 persons drawn\nfrom Medicare enrollment files was screened in 1982 to\nidentify persons with functional limitations, defined as the\ninability to perform at least one activity of personal care\n(ADL) or management of daily affairs (IADL) for a period of\n3 months or more. Over 6,400 persons were identified, and\n95.3 percent were interviewed. This sample was foliowed-\nnondisabled-community residents identified in 1982 and\nThe NLTC analytic subsample consisted of White (n =\naged 70 and older. There was no significant difference by\nrace in the exclusion of those aged 65 to 69 years.

After screening, the sample contained approxi-\nto permit unbiased national estimates for the noninstitutiona-\nlized population as well as separate estimates for elderly,\npoor, and near poor; African Americans and Hispanics; and\npersons with functional limitations.

Four rounds of personal and telephone\ninterviews occurred at 4-month intervals for the study refer-\nence year of 1987.

Only those older persons\nwho reported at least one limitation in ADLs or IADLs or\nwalking received the long-term care supplement (see Cohen,\nShort and Leon, 1990, for detailed discussions of NMES\nmethodology).

Selection effects remain a plausible alterna-\ntive explanation for any differences found between the data\nsets (Nesselroade, 1988). First, the definitions of frailty used\nin the SOA and NMES do not include the restriction to\nchronicity (defined as 3 months limitation or more) used in\nthe NLTC. Second, there is a 3-year difference between the\ndata collection for the SOA and NLTC, on the one hand, and\nthe NMES on the other.\nMeasures\nTable 2 describes how concepts were operationalized in\neach data set.

NMES did not include any measures for\nnumber of children. Family income, education, and self-\nhealth ratings had sufficient missing data to warrant imputa-\ntion of missing data. The missing values for education\nage- and race-specific means. Missing data for income\n(SOA, 17.8%; NLTC, 9.7%) were imputed to mean values\nby level of education and race. Missing cases of self-health\nratings (SOA, 0.7%; NLTC, 7.7%) were assigned the global\nmean value. Missing values in income and self-health rat-\nings in NMES were imputed prior to data tape release.\nOur choice of measures was guided by two principles:\nreliability of the SES, family structure, and health measures;\nand availability and comparability of measures across data\nsets. As a result of the latter criteria, variables required\nmeasurement at their broadest level, minimizing differences\nin detail that may have been present in one of the data sets.\nFor example, because there were no asset data available in\nSOA, asset data from NLTC and NMES could not be\nincluded in our measures of economic status. Similarly,\nSOA had more detailed information about household struc-\nture than was available in the NLTC or NMES data. (See\nWolinsky, 1994, for a discussion of other measurement\nlimitations.)\nLimitations were apparent in measurement of our depen-\ndent variables. Each survey asked about different sets of\ncommunity long-term care services and used different time\nreferent periods for use (see below for details). We therefore\nselected the minimum service cluster that could be identified\nin each data set for separate analysis. We are not sure of the\neffect of different referent time periods on results. We can\nexpect that the proportion using a service in the past year\nwould differ from the proportion using that service the\nprevious month. It is not clear, however, if the patterns of\npredictors of use would vary by referent time period across\ndata sets.\nAll three surveys included indicators of selected home\nbased services. The SOA asked about in-home health ser-\nvices during the past 12 months, identifying users of visiting\nnurse services (8.4%), health aide (5.0%), homemaker\n(3.9%), and home-delivered meals (5.2%). The NLTC asked\nonly about home nursing services during the past month\n(8.7% use). In NMES, 6 percent used home-delivered meals\nand 13.1 percent had a home health aide on a regular basis.\nUse of senior centers on a regular basis was measured in the\nSOA, NLTC, and NMES. In NMES, however, the number\nusing senior centers was too small for individual data set\nanalysis. We also created a catch-all dichotomous variable to\nrepresent use of any service mentioned in the data set. The\ndefinition and number of services varied by data set. For\nexample, in SOA and NLTC, use of transportation was\nrestricted to travel to senior centers; in NMES, use of\ntransportation included travel to senior centers, day care\ncenters, and special transportation. The proportions using\neach of the nonitemized services were low, less than 3\npercent each.\nComparison of Samples by Race Across Data Sets\nTable 3 describes the distribution of sample variables by\nrace by data set.

Whites have similar distribu-\ntions in all the data sets on age, gender, education, region,\nliving arrangements, and number of children. White older\npersons in the SOA are slightly more likely to have private\ninsurance and less likely to be on Medicaid than their\ncounterparts in the NLTC. Frail older White persons in\nNMES are similar to those in NLTC in age, education,\npercent female, region, percent receiving Medicaid, and\nmean number of IADL limitations. But those in the NMES\nsurvey are more likely to have private insurance, have higher\nincomes, and live alone with higher mean number of related\nhousehold members than their counterparts in the NLTC.\nAfrican Americans in SOA and NLTC have similar distri-\nbutions on age, education, region, proxy status, living\nalone, number in household, and number of children. Afri-\ncan Americans in the SOA are somewhat more likely to be\nfemale, more likely to have private insurance, and less likely\nto be on Medicaid than their counterparts in NLTC. African\nAmericans in NMES appear to be more highly educated,\nwith higher incomes and private insurance and larger family\nsize than the NLTC sample. African Americans and Whites\nin SOA report slightly fewer limitations in ADL, IADL, and\nphysical performance abilities, but similar self-health ratings\nthan those in NLTC. The lower mean number of ADL\nlimitations in NMES is a result of fewer ADLs being\ncounted.\nWithin each survey, race differences in sociodemographic\nvariables are similar to those noted in other studies. Thus,\ngiven the accumulation of lifetime differentials in social and\neconomic resources, Whites have higher education levels,\nhigher income, greater likelihood of private insurance, and\nless likelihood of Medicaid than African Americans or\nHispanics. African Americans are more likely than Whites\nto reside in Southern states. Household arrangement differ-\nentials between Whites and African Americans are similar in\nall data sets, i.e., African Americans are less likely to be\nmarried or live alone. The average number of children does\nnot differ by race. Health status differentials are minimal\nacross the data sets.\nAnalytic Strategy\nAs Wolinsky et al. (1990) note, analyses which seek to\nassign variance to race and/or ethnicity are not particularly\ninformative for two reasons: First, one wants to know why\nthere are differences. Race and ethnicity in and of them-\nselves are not explanatory variables. Second, one wants to\nunderstand how a process differs across groups. Both ques-\ntions require one to specify a set of intervening variables\nbetween race/ethnicity on the one hand and the outcome of\ninterest on the other. If the coefficients on dummy variables\nrepresenting racial and ethnic groups go to zero after the\ninclusion of intervening variables, then we argue (assuming\ncorrect specification of the model) that we have explained\nthe group differences. Similarly, if we can show that coef-\nficients of a presumed causal model differ across race/ethnic\ngroups, then, in a different sense, we have explained group\ndifferences. If the race variable remains significant after\nentering the other model variables, we can conclude that\nother explanatory variables are needed to interpret how race/\nethnicity affects use of services.\nBecause of the dichotomous nature of the dependent\nvariables, we used logistic regression as our primary analytic\nmethod. All three data sets had complex multistage sample\ndesigns with some degree of clustering. Thus, standard\nerrors based on simple random sampling assumptions will be\ntoo small. All estimates were computed taking sample de-\nsign into account, using the Research Triangle Institute's\nOur general strategy was to begin with a simple bivariate\nmodel examining race differences only, and then to intro-\nduce sequentially \"intervening variables\" intending to ac-\ncount for those differences. Each model contained all the\nvariables in the preceding model. The order of \"intervening\nvariable models\" was (1) Race only; (2) Sociodemographic:\ngender, age, education, region, rural/urban, and proxy re-\nspondent; (3) Economic: income, private insurance, and\nMedicaid; (4) Family structure: living arrangement, number\nin household, number of children; (5) Health status: ADLs\nand IADLs, self-reported health, and physical performance\nlimitations.\nThis hierarchical order modified the usual causal sequence\nimplied by the Andersen behavioral framework of service\nuse (Andersen and Newman, 1973; Wolinsky and Johnson,\n1991). First, because of our recognition that race is a marker\nvariable that represents many complex societal processes,\nwe introduced race alone to determine its global effect before\npartialling out compositional differences. Social and demo-\ngraphic characteristics of gender, race, and education in-\nfluence the distribution of personal resources. Service avail-\nability varies by geographic region. Thus, this block of\nvariables was entered next. Because the socioeconomic\ninterpretation of race differences is dominant in social sci-\nence literature, we introduced income as an implied causal\nstep prior to the predisposing variables of household compo-\nsition and informal network characteristics. Prior research\nhas shown conclusively that need, i.e., health and functional\nstatus, is the major determinant of use of services by older\npersons. By introducing these variables last, we have the\nopportunity to examine more closely the ways in which\nsocial factors explicate the meaning of race. Since this is\ncross-sectional data, any causal implications implied by this\norder are suggestive only.\nOur final step was to determine if the process influencing\nthe use of each long-term care service cluster differed by\nrace. We created multiplicative interaction terms of race by\nsignificant predictors of service use and tested these glob-\nally. If the global test on the set of interaction terms was sig-\nnificant, we looked at individual product terms.\nRESULTS\nPrevalence of Use of Community Long-Term Care Services\nTable 4 presents the percentage of use of community long-\nterm care services by race. These data are presented for\ndescriptive purposes only. Because of subtle differences in\nnumber and type of service included within the measurement\nof each summary service type, the proportions are not\ndirectly comparable. Thus, the lower proportions using\nservices, regardless of race in NLTC, are a result of restric-\ntions and differential time referents of our operational defini-\ntions. The relatively limited use of community long-term\ncare services leads to potentially unstable estimates of ser-\nvice use by minority group within data set. Essentially,\nhowever, there were no differences by race in use of home-\nbased services, senior centers, or any service.\nAfrican American and White Differences by Data Set\nAlthough race differences were not found at the bivariate\nlevel, the possibility of differential effects in the multivariate\ncontext remains. We ran five hierarchical models for each of\nthe three dependent variables of service use. As noted\nearlier, we began with a model containing race differences,\nthen added sets of variables thought to influence the relation-\nship between race and service use. The odds ratio may be\ninterpreted as the odds of using a service of one category of a\nparticular independent variable compared to the odds of\nusing the same service for a different category of the inde-\npendent variable. Values greater than 1 indicate higher\nlikelihood of use, and values less than 1 indicate lower\nlikelihood of use (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 1989).\nOne final note is required regarding the income variable.\nWe tested for both linear and nonlinear effects of income. In\nTable 4. Percent Using Community Long-Term Care Services by Race and Data Set\nAfrican American\nWhite\nTotal\nSOA\nHome-Based Services\nNLTO\nNMES\nSOA\nSenior Centers\nNLTC\nNMES\nSOA\nAny Services\nNLTC\nNMES\n\u00b7Probability of chi-square < .05.\nSOA and NMES, the effect of income on the odds of use of\nhome-based services and any services was nonlinear and\nquadratic. Thus, service use was higher at very low levels\nand at high levels of income, and lower in the middle levels.\nWe assume that this occurs because low-income respondents\nare eligible for free services, and high-income respondents\ncan afford private services (Stoller and Cutler, 1993).\nTable 5 summarizes the odds ratios of each type of service\nuse for African Americans compared to White older persons.\nThere were no significant race differences in any of the\nmodels in any of the data sets for any service use variable.\nFurthermore, the variations in odds ratios by models seem\nrelatively random with one exception. Within NMES, as\nmore variables are entered into the regression of home-based\nservices, the relative odds of African Americans using\nhome-based services compared to Whites declined. This\npattern did not occur in the other two data sets. This decline\nmay lack statistical significance because of the relatively\nsmall sample size of frail older persons in this survey.\nTable 6 summarizes the final models of predictors of\ncommunity long-term care service use. The only consistent\npredictors of home-based services across the three data sets\nwere education, use of Medicaid, and number of IADL\nlimitations. A subset of predictors was significant in the\nSOA and the NLTC surveys: age, self-health rating, and\nnumber of ADL limitations. Living alone was a significant\nTable 5.

In summary, home-based services\nwere used primarily by those with poorer health who re-\nceived Medicaid and lived alone. Other influences on use of\nhome-based services were significant in only one data set.\nLiving in a rural community and number of ADL limita-\ntions were consistent predictors of use of senior centers in\nthe SOA and NLTC. Those with fewer limitations were\nmore likely to participate in senior center programs. The\neffect of living in a rural community, however, varied by\ndata set. Those living in rural communities in the SOA show\na relatively- greater likelihood of use of senior centers com-\npared to urbanized areas, wherein those sampled in NMES\nshow a relatively smaller likelihood of use. Since the defini-\ntion of urban/rural varies by data set (see Table 2), any\nconclusions about the association between rural setting and\nsenior center use remain tentative.\nIn SOA, greater likelihood of using senior centers oc-\ncurred among those living in Western regions compared to\nthe Midwest, rural areas, those living alone but having more\nchildren, and with fewer ADL and IADL limitations. In the\nNLTC, greater likelihood of use of senior centers occurred\namong women, more populated communities, private insur-\nance, and in better health with fewer ADL limitations. The\npredictors converge in providing a picture of senior center\nparticipants that represents the healthier end of the older\nperson spectrum.\nThe pattern of predictors of use of any services was\ninconsistent across the data sets. These results may reflect\nthe varied type and number of services included in each\nstudy. Those who live in the South were least likely to use\nservices. The most consistently significant predictors across\ndata sets were use of Medicaid, living alone, and number of\nfunctional limitations.\nThe final models were tested for interaction between race\nand the other predictors to explore if the process influencing\nservice use varied by race. No significant interactions by\nrace were identified. We thus conclude that African Ameri-\ncans and Whites exhibit more similarities than differences in\nthe processes influencing use of community long-term care\nservices.\nHispanic Use of Community Long-Term Care Services\nData were pooled from the three data sets to create a\nsufficient number of Hispanic respondents for analysis. The\nnumber of Hispanic older persons, however, remained small\nwith insufficient power for detecting small differences be-\ntween Hispanics and Whites or African Americans. We\ninclude the results for illustrative purposes and as a further\ncheck on consistency of results across data sets.\nThe pooled data represent a different sample than those\ndefining the individual data sets. We recalculated the num-\nber of ADL and IADL limitations to include only identical\nitems in the summary scales. The sample definition of the\npooled data is older people who have any ADL/IADL\nlimitation on the new list of 11 potential limitations. The\n(87.3%) White. The data were not weighted because of the\ndiffering survey distributions. The inclusion of race, age,\ngender, and region in the analysis minimizes sampling\ndesign effects. Because we could not use the SUDAAN\nsoftware (Shah et al., 1991) for the pooled data, we verified\nthe significance levels through bootstrapping models (details\nFor comparability we redefined selected variables. We\nchanged the dependent variables to represent (a) combined\nuse of visiting nurse and health aide services, and (b) senior\ncenters. We omitted the following variables because of\nvariations in definitions: urban/rural/SMSA, number of chil-\ndren, and number of household members. We restricted the\nscale of physical performance to three items. Dummy vari-\nables controlling for the effect of data set differences were\nadded to the model.\nTable 7 presents the results of the pooled logistic regres-\nsions. Whites were the omitted reference group for race. No\nrace or ethnic differences in service use were found. The\nresults in the pooled analysis were similar to those identified\nin the individual data set analyses, net of differences in data\nset characteristics. Older, more highly educated persons\nwho lived outside the South or West, had private insurance\nor Medicaid, were living alone, and in poorer physical\nhealth were relatively more likely to use visiting nurse/\nhome health services. Senior center participation was more\nlikely found among those who did not live in the South, had\nMedicaid, were living alone, and were in better health. Yet,\nthe methodological artifact of differences in data set meth-\nodology and sample size also had a significant effect. Thus,\nall else being equal, respondents in NMES had a 3 times\nhigher relative odds of use of visiting nurse and health aide\nTable 7.

Respon-\ndents in SOA reported significantly higher relative odds of\nsenior center use.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study examined the relationship between race/\nethnicity and use of community long-term care services in\nthree national data sets. No race/ethnicity differences in use\nat the bivariate and multivariate level between African\nAmericans, Hispanics, and Whites were identified. Thus,\nfrom the national policy perspective of fostering equal ac-\ncess to community services for the elderly, little overt\ndiscrimination or restricted access by race is apparent. One\nof the advantages of testing similar models across data sets is\nthat the consistency of predictors provides greater con-\nfidence in the robustness of findings. Our results confirm\npredictors of community long-term care use identified in\nother studies, e.g., living arrangement, health status, re-\ngion, and insurance/income status (Soldo, Agree, and Wolf,\n1989). The results also confirm the relatively low levels of\nuse of community long-term care services among the popu-\nlation defined most at risk, i.e., those deficient in at least one\ninstrumental or physical activity of daily living.\nThe replication of our findings across the national data sets\nand in the pooled analysis increases our confidence in their\nvalidity. Yet, certain methodological limitations must be\nnoted. First, as national sample surveys, decisions made in\nthe data collection process may influence the results. Re-\ncruitment of minorities into national samples is more likely\nto occur in higher density minority areas, especially in urban\ncommunities to minimize sampling costs (Jackson, 1988a).\nSuch areas may also contain a higher density of service\navailability, an unmeasured but crucial factor in understand-\ning service use. Thus, estimates of use of services by\nminorities may remain somewhat biased.\nA second selection factor involves the restriction of our\nstudy samples to those age 70 and over. Because of differen-\ntial morbidity and mortality at earlier ages, proportionally\nfewer minorities are alive at age 70 compared to their White\ncounterparts. The association between age and health and\nfunctional status is linear among Whites, but nonlinear\namong Blacks (Gibson and Jackson, 1992). Thus, our sam-\nples may represent hardier minority older persons compared\nto a wider range of health status among older Whites.\nA third limitation of these findings is inconsistency in\ndefinitions of services and predictors across data sets. For\nexample, the categories of home-based services or use of any\nservice include service units that vary by amount of worker\ntraining, source of payment, profit/non-profit status, etc.\nInformation about the service use process, such as knowl-\nedge of services, access and eligibility issues, and availabil-\nity at the local level, is not included. Lack of information\nabout these matters may mask elements that are important in\nassessing differences in question meaning and perception of\nservices by minority older persons. The lack of agreement in\nservice listings in these data sets also reflects not only\ndifferent decisions by survey designers, but also fragmenta-\ntion in service delivery systems in the aging network.\nA fourth methodological limitation is the different time\nreferents of use of service and the 3-year difference in data\ncollection time between the 1984 SOA and NLTC and the\n1987 NMES. The difference in time referents suggests\npotential for measurement error in respondent estimates, but\nwe do not believe these cognitive processes would vary by\nrace. The primary implication of difference in year of data\ncollection may be a change in the age distribution of the\npopulation, but major shifts are unlikely in only 3 years.\nAlso, our models mix measures of current status with mea-\nsures of service use at a prior time, leading to further\nconfusions in interpretation. Changes in Medicaid waiver\nplans by states were occurring during this time.\nThe most important limitation of this and similar studies is\nconceptual. Using race per se as a marker variable to repre-\nsent unmeasured biological, social, cultural, and economic\ncharacteristics is recognizably simplistic. As LaViest (1994)\nnotes, a race dummy variable measures only skin color and\ndoes not capture within-group cultural and socioeconomic\nheterogeneity or the societal health risk exposure and health/\nillness behaviors that may influence service use. This re-\nsearch included direct measures of socioeconomic status,\nfamily structure, and selected health conditions. Selected\nindicators of these risks had direct effects on service use, but\nthere was no evidence of race/risk interactions.\nResearchers differ in interpreting race effects as indicative\nof socioeconomic status, cultural context, or patterned dis-\ncrimination (Belgrave, Wykle, and Choi, 1993; Mutran,\ncultural or discriminatory dimensions of race in these data\nsets. There were, however, indicators of socioeconomic\nstatus included in our models and evidence that government\nand insurance programs linked to income were linked to\nservice use.\nThe most consistent socioeconomic predictor of higher\nuse of any type of service was Medicaid status. Medicaid is a\nmeans-tested program for those living in poverty. Federally\nand state funded but administered by the states, eligibility\nstandards, allocations, and coverage vary greatly, covering\nonly about one-half of those living in poverty (Estes, 1989).\nReflecting their lower income levels, older African Ameri-\ncans were significantly more likely to be Medicaid recipients\nthan Whites and significantly less likely to have private\ninsurance coverage. To the extent that Medicaid status\nindicates awareness of community services, this status may\nfacilitate higher use of services by African Americans that\nbalances the higher ability of many Whites to purchase\nservice directly (Stoller and Cutler, 1993).\nLack of economic resources as reflected in Medicaid status\nmay affect race differences in use in another way. Our results\nclearly show that the amount of functional limitations was a\nprimary predictor of service use. As noted, from a policy\nperspective, it appears that community long-term services are\nengaging their target populations as intended. Yet, given the\nhigher mean levels of disability reported by African Ameri-\ncans and the predictive importance of level of impairment on\nuse of long-term care services, we might legitimately expect\nhigher use by African Americans than Whites, notjust similar\nrates. Medicaid status may contribute to this potential ineq-\nuity. For example, Medicaid provides lower rates than private\ninsurance in most areas. Nursing homes, therefore, may be\nmore likely to discriminate against admitting Medicaid appli-\ncants, contributing in part to the lower rates of nursing home\nplacement of older African Americans (Harrington Meyer,\n1994). Medicaid recipients in the community may be espe-\ncially frail and have more obvious service needs than those in\ninstitutions, contributing to higher use of services among\nAfrican Americans.\nIn sum, the results of this study contribute to the debate\nabout adequacy of service accessibility for minority older\npersons in two ways. First, we confirm the results of other\nstudies that race differences in service use are not apparent at\nthe national level. To the extent that access to services is\nfinancially driven, the financial benefits of Social Security,\nMedicare, and Medicaid appear to be accomplishing the goal\nof increasing the ability of all older persons to use commu-\nnity long-term care services. Clearly, any changes in these\nprograms or others that weaken the financial stability of\nolder minority adults or tighten service eligibility require-\nments will have negative consequences for minority use of\ncommunity long-term care.\nSecond, we illustrate the advantages and limitations of the\nuse of comparable models across national data sets. Analyz-\ning models across data sets provides a form of meta-analysis\nin which the effect of predisposing, enabling, and need\nfactors on service use can be quantified and replicated. The\ndemonstrated consistency of findings increases our con-\nfidence in their validity.\nOur experience, however, leads us to question whether\nanalysis of national data sets is the appropriate level for\nstudying social policies relating to community-based long-\nterm service use. One likelihood is that important local\ngeographical differences in service use by minorities are\ncancelled out in the aggregation to national data. Service use\nis only one aspect of a complex process of interaction be-\ntween individuals' definition/search for help and service\navailability and accessibility. This process is embedded in\nlocal and regional service delivery systems that are affected\nby policy decisions made at each level. These issues may be\ninvestigated more appropriately in community-based studies\nthat encompass individual and service delivery system char-\nacteristics embedded in local cultural contexts (e.g., Logan\ndetermining policy implications from analysis of national\ndata sets is limited without more adequate knowledge of\nindividual, family, and community decision-making pro-\ncesses and availability of services. Our research program is\ncurrently engaged in cognitive laboratory exercises of focus\ngroups and think-aloud sessions with minority older persons\nto examine the cultural and linguistic meaning of selected\nlong-term care constructs. In this way, we hope to determine\nadditional and more culturally appropriate concepts of service\nuse to incorporate into future surveys of long-term care use.\n"
