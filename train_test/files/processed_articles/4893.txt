    "abstract": "Abstract\nTraditional Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), which is widely used to treat pain and urolithiasis, is a promising therapy for\nurinary stone prevention. This study investigated the clinical efficacy of a popular CHM, Wu-Ling-San (WLS), in Taiwan for\nthe prophylaxis of recurrent nephrolithiasis as assessed by surgical stone treatment via a nationwide population-based cohort\nstudy. The National Health Insurance Research Database, 2000\u00ad2010, which included one million patient records. All patients\ndiagnosed with stone disease at the beginning of the study. The matched controls (4-fold the number of WLS patients) were\nstone patients who did not take WLS. Data analysis included the stone surgeries following the first treatment. We enrolled\n900 patients with stone disease, and the incidence of stone patients in this database was 1.19%. The prevalence of\ncomorbidities such as benign prostate hyperplasia, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and urinary tract infection, but\nnot hypertension, was significantly higher in WLS users. Several patients in both groups were prescribed potassium citrate.\nThe stone treatment rate was significantly higher in WLS users (17.85%) than in the non-WLS users (14.47%). WLS users\nwith an associated comorbidity had a higher treatment rate than the non-WLS users: 21.05% versus 16.70%, respectively.\nThe surgery rate for upper urinary tract stones was higher in WLS users than in the non-WLS users (adjusted hazard ratio,\nused a very high amount of WLS (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.02; 95% confidence interval, 2.30-3.98). Stone patients using a high\namount of WLS use had a high stone surgical rate. Long-term therapy with WLS did not have a preventive effect on stone\nsurgical treatment. Long-term potassium citrate therapy as a preventive measure appeared to be underutilized in this study.\n",

In a small short-term randomized control\ntrial, WLS increased urine output without serious adverse\neffects in comparison with a control group.18-20 However,\nlong-term clinical experience with WLS use as a preventive\nformula is lacking.21 The effectiveness of WLS should be\nfurther confirmed in a large population in a long-term clini-\ncal study. Recently, a nationwide population-based study that\nenrolled a large population of patients was conducted in\nTaiwan for stone disease, and this study enabled us to per-\nform a survey to investigate the clinical usage of the WLS\nformula to prevent recurrent stone as assessed by stone sur-\ngery in Taiwan.14 By utilizing these nationwide data, we\nwere able to elucidate the clinical effect of the WLS formula\nin the prevention of stone recurrence.\nMethods\nDatabase\nClaimed data from the National Health Insurance Research\nDatabase (NHIRD) were used in this study. The data were\nobtained from the health care information of > 96% of all\nmedical claims in Taiwan since 1996. The medical services\nprovided by the NHI program included both Western and tra-\nditional medicine as well as outpatient care, inpatient care,\nphysical therapy, dental services, prescription drugs, medical\ninstitution services, and registration files with scrambled\nidentifications.\ndomly obtained from the claims dataset of a sample of 1 mil-\nlion enrolled from the entire insured population in the NHI\nprogram base (Database, LHID2000). The diagnosis codes\nfrom the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth\nRevision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) were used in the\ndatabase. The NHIRD was previously described in detail.22\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of\nStudy Sample\nFor the study cohort, we selected patients newly diagnosed\nwere excluded. In this case-control study, the case group\npatients received WLS and the treatment date was defined as\nthe index date. In the control group, 4 controls each are fre-\nquency matched with each individual case patient according to\nage (every 5 years), gender, study-year, and index-year.\nFinally, we identified a total of 11900 patients with stone dis-\nease. Patients who took WLS were further divided into low\n(44 g/y) users to compare the dose effect. Furthermore, we\nevaluated comorbidities (might affect the incidence of urethral\nstones) such as hypertension,23 benign prostate hyperplasia,24\ngout, chronic kidney disease, urinary tract infection, and dia-\nbetes mellitus25 as well as patients who took potassium citrate\nas a preventive treatment in both groups.\nSurgery following stone disease was defined as any sur-\ngery for a stone 180 days after the first diagnosis of stone\n(Table 1).

Person-\nyears of follow-up duration were calculated for each indi-\nvidual until the end of the database period. A Poisson\nregression model was used to examine the incidence of fol-\nlowing stone treatment, and the 95% confidence interval (CI)\nof stone treatment with categorical variables was calculated\nfor each cohort. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard mod-\nels were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI\nfor factors associated with comorbidity such as age, gender,\nhypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), gout, chronic kidney\ndisease (CKD), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and uri-\nnary tract infection (UTI).

Therefore, the incidence\nof stone patients in this database was 1.19%\nWLS users and the non-WLS users revealed no significant\ndifference in gender and age. The mean age was 49.1 years\nin both groups. The WLS-user group comprised 1213 men\nmen and 4672 women. The ratios of the following comor-\nbidities were significantly higher in WLS users: benign\nprostate hyperplasia, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mel-\nlitus, and urinary tract infection (P < .0001). Urinary tract\ninfection was the most common comorbidity in the WLS\ngroup, occurring in 1031 patients. The comorbidity of\nhypertension was not significantly different between the 2\ngroups (Table 2). Few stone patients were prescribed\npotassium citrate in both groups. Although WLS users had\na higher ratio of potassium citrate use than the non-WLS\nusers, only 1.22% potassium citrate users were identified\nin the population.\nThe incidence of stone treatments used in both groups\nduring the follow-up period is shown in Table 3. Overall,\nthe incidence of stone treatment was higher in WLS users\n.05). Men had a higher stone treatment rate than women,\nStone surgery was higher in patients with a comorbidity\noverall in both groups.

A weak association of increasing stone treatment in\nstone patients who used WLS was observed in the age dis-\ntribution. Surgery for upper urinary tract stones was higher\nin WLS users than in the non-WLS users (adjusted HR,\nhad a lower incidence of operations when the stone was\ntively). However, the number of cases was limited to 474 in\nWLS users (Table 4).\nAs shown in Table 5, patients in the very high WLS group\nhad a significantly higher stone treatment rate (52.79%;\nDiscussion\nThe comparison between WLS users and non-WLS users\nrevealed that long-term WLS use in stone patients did not\nhave a preventive effect on subsequent stone surgery in this\nstudy. No difference was observed between WLS users and\nthe non-WLS users among stone patients without comor-\nbidities. Increased stone treatment was observed in stone\npatients who used WLS compared with non-users, but this\ndifference was not significant if the WLS user took less than\n43 g of WLS per year. The stone treatment rate was notably\nincreased in very high WLS users regardless of the clinical\nTable 2.

Patients with comorbidities such\nas hypertension, gout, benign prostate hyperplasia, chronic\nkidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and urinary tract infection\nwere enrolled. Overall, the ratio of stone patients with\ncomorbidities was significantly higher in WLS users (22.7%)\nthan in the non-WLS users.

However, no\nstatistically significant difference in the rate of further stone\ntreatment was observed between the 2 groups without comor-\nbidities. Therefore, WLS might not have a preventive effect\nin patients without comorbidity.\nThe WLS formula is mainly used to treat uremia and\ndropsy and to promote urination in traditional Chinese medi-\ncine. According to the first recorded use of WLS \"Shang Han\nLun\" (Treatise of Cold-induced Disorders), written by\nZhong-Jing Zhang, WLS was commonly used for the treat-\nment of urinary tract disorders. Therefore, it is understand-\nable that we found a high rate of this comorbidity in the\ngroup of WLS users. Based on this information, we presume\nthat the original use of WLS was not for the treatment of\nstone disease. The first recorded use of WLS to treat stone\ndisease was found in the book of \"Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng\"\n(Standards of Patterns and Treatment), written by Ken-Tang\nWang in the Ming Dynasty (later 16th century). However, we\ncould not elucidate the number of WLS users who were pre-\nscribed this agent for the treatment of stone disease in the\ncurrent database.\nRecently, Siener et al26 investigated oxalate content in\nherbal remedies and dietary supplements based on plant\nextracts. Urinary oxalate excretion is directly related to the\namount of oral intake and intestinal absorption rate of oxa-\nlate. They evaluated the possibility of increasing oxalate\ningestion, which could lead to secondary hyperoxaluria,\nassociated with the intake of herbal remedies and dietary\nsupplements containing plant extracts. Their results showed\nremarkable differences in oxalate contents of the extracts.\nThe selected herbal remedies and dietary supplements con-\ntaining plant extracts represent only a low risk for calcium\noxalate stone formers, if the recommended daily dose is not\nexceeded.\nAnumber of herbal extracts and remedies have been tested\nin vitro or in preclinical in vivo models to assess their activity\nas chemolytic agents, or as agents preventing new stone for-\nmation. A number of clinical studies have also been per-\nformed to investigate the efficacy of various herbal remedies\nin the primary/secondary management of urolithiasis. More\nrecently, Monti et al analyzed the clinical evidence on the\nefficacy of phytotherapy in the treatment of calculi in the uri-\nnary tract. They found that citrate is more effective than phy-\ntotherapy in decreasing the size of existing calculi in the\nurinary tract and in decreasing the urinary excretion rate of\nuric acid.27 We previously conducted a pilot study on the use\nof WLS for calcium oxalate stone prevention.20 The urine\namount was increased slightly in this study, which included a\nsmall number of cases with short-term follow-up. However,\nthese results could not predict its long-term effect on stone\nrecurrence.\nThe incidence of stone patients in this case-control study\nreported in a previous population-based study by Huang\net al.14 Our value might have been lower than that of the pre-\nvious study because of our exclusion criteria. We excluded\npatients who were less than 20 years of age, who had previ-\nously used WLS, and who had a malignancy, whereas Huang\net al did not exclude any comorbidity. Therefore, this may\nexplain the differences in the incidence between these 2\nstudies.\nPotassium citrate has a well-known and documented role\nas a major preventive drug.28-30 In a retrospective cohort study\nof long-term potassium citrate use in stone patients by\nRobinson et al,30 the stone formation rate was significantly\n(93%) decreased after the initiation of potassium citrate ther-\napy. Potassium citrate may produce a short-term high citratu-\nric state and a long-term change in urinary metabolic\nprofiles.31,32 These authors confirmed that potassium citrate\ntherapy for as long as 14 years was useful in patients with\nrecurrent nephrolithiasis. However, few patients took potas-\nsium citrate as a preventive measure against stone recurrence\nin both groups in this study. In addition, the finding of\nincreased medical demands in the analysis of Huang et al14\nindicated that stone recurrence was increased in their ana-\nlyzed patients. Therefore, medical treatments for stone recur-\nrence were not decreased in their report. The long-term use of\noral drugs is inconvenient for patients and carries the risk of\npotential side effects. Therefore, recurrence of stone disease\nTable 5.

First, the information\nregarding risk factors for recurrence was not clear for the\npatients in this study. The recurrence rate may be higher for\npatients with risks factors such as metabolic disorders, posi-\ntive family history, or hyperuricosuria and hypercalcemia.36,37\nTherefore, patients with a higher recurrent rate may have a\nstronger desire to seek preventive treatment than would\npatients with a lower recurrent rate. Second, we studied the\ncode only for invasive treatment of stone patients as a sur-\nrogate for stone recurrence. Third, our results disagree with\nprevious in vitro and in vivo studies for WLS. The explana-\ntions for these differences include the use of different spe-\ncies in various studies, the difference between the\nwell-controlled atmosphere of the laboratory versus a pop-\nulation-based study, the fact that this was a short-term trial\nthat excluded other systemic disorders, the fact that nation-\nwide data are obtained from various doctors ranging from\nmedical centers to local clinics, and the fact that patients\nmay have been treated with WLS for other chronic illness\nsuch as chronic kidney disease and lower urinary tract\nsymptoms rather than for stones. Fourth, we were not able\nto assess whether the long-term use of WLS has a preven-\ntive effect on stone recurrence because we had a small num-\nber of cases and this was a short-term randomized control\ntrial. Finally, the stone expulsion effect of WLS was not\nconsidered in this study.\nConclusions\nIn traditional CHM, the WLS formula is widely used to treat\nseveral disorders such as stone disease, hypertension, gout,\nchronic kidney disease, urinary tract infection, and diabetes\nmellitus. The stone surgical rate was high in stone patients\nwho used a high amount of WLS. No statistical difference\nwas observed between WLS users and the non-WLS users in\nstone patients without comorbidities. Nevertheless, long-\nterm therapy with WLS did not have a preventive effect on\nthe stone surgical treatment in stone patients. A large-scale\nclinical study of WLS is warranted to elucidate the con-\nfounding factors.\nAuthors' Note\nThe design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analy-\nsis, and interpretation of the data; and preparation, review, and\napproval of the manuscript were the sole responsibility of the authors\nlisted and were not influenced by the research's sponsor.
