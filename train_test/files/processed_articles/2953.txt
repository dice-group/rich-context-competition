Of all direct payment transactions, cash accounts\nfor an astounding 82% in terms of number, and for 58% in terms of value. With a new and\nunique dataset that combines transaction information with survey data on payment behaviour\nof German consumers, we shed light on how individuals choose payment instruments and\nwhy cash remains so important. We propose a two-stage empirical framework which jointly\nexplains credit card ownership and the use of cash. Our results indicate that the pattern of cash\nusage is compatible with systematic economic decision making. Consumers decide upon the\nadoption of payment cards and then use available payment media according to their transac-\ntion and personal characteristics, the relative costs of cash and card usage, and their assess-\nment of payment instruments' characteristics. Whereas older consumers use significantly\nmore cash, the comparison with younger consumers shows that the difference in payment\nbehaviour is not explained by age as such but to a large extent by differences in the charac-\nteristics of these two groups. It is interesting that the possession of a credit card, especially\nalongside a debit card, does not significantly affect the use of cash in Germany.\n",

The conference was\norganised around two major topics: first, the economic and regulatory implications of a more integrated retail payments\nmarket and, second, the strands of innovation and modernisation in the retail payments business. To make innovations\nsuccessful, expectations and requirements of retail payment users have to be taken seriously. The conference has shown\nthat these expectations and requirements are strongly influenced by the growing demand for alternative banking\nsolutions, the increasing international mobility of individuals and companies, a loss of trust in the banking industry and\nmajor social trends such as the ageing population in developed countries. There are signs that customers see a need for\nmore innovative payment solutions. Overall, the conference led to valuable findings which will further stimulate our\nefforts to foster the economic underpinnings of innovation and integration in retail banking and payments.\nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank all participants in the conference.

Introduction\n\nThe diffusion of non-cash payment instruments has proliferated widely and payment tech-\nnologies have been advancing rapidly in recent years and decades. Around 91% of German\nconsumers currently hold debit cards and 27% credit cards. The options for cashless payments\nhave also been increasing in recent years, in particular since more and more retailers have\nintroduced point-of-sale (POS) terminals. However, cash payments in Germany seem far from\nfading out: cash still accounts for an astounding 82% of the volume (number of transactions)\nand for 58% of the value of all direct payment transactions.1 These figures imply that cash is\nstill being used in many payment transactions for which cashless payments at low costs for\nconsumers would have also been possible.\nThe enduringly high and stable intensity of cash usage may simply be a remnant of the past,\nwhere cash was the sole means of payment to carry out retail transactions. If the current situa-\ntion could be best described in terms of incomplete adjustment, then a massive shift away\nfrom cash could be expected for the near future, as consumers adjust to the new economic and\ntechnological environment. Evidently, such a shift would affect monetary policy transmission,\nthe aggregate cost of the payment system and seigniorage revenues.\nWe investigate the fundamentals of cash usage in several dimensions. We develop a choice\nmodel and assess its performance. While this model is not built up from first principles, the\nselection of variables reflect the implications of rational behaviour as laid out in the literature.\nThus a rejection of the model would cast in doubt the validity of a rational choice framework.\nIn turn, if this model performs well, it is demonstrated that consumers do not just cling blindly\nto their past behaviour. If choice follows systematic patterns, predetermined behaviour is\nruled out.\n\n We are grateful for comments by Denise C\u00f4t\u00e9, Stefan Gerlach, Heinz Herrmann, Thomas Laubach, Cyril\nMonnet, Dimitris Georgarakos, Alexander Wolman, and many participants at presentations at the\nOesterreichische Nationalbank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, the conference on \"retail payments: integration and\ninnovation\" in Frankfurt, organised by the ECB and the Dutch National Bank, the 2009 meeting of the Austrian\nEconomic Association in Linz, the 2009 meeting of the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik in Magdeburg, the Canadian\nEconomic Association 2009 annual conference in Toronto, and the 2009 annual meeting of EEA and ESEM in\nBarcelona.\n1 Bundesbank survey \"Payment habits in Germany\", cf. Section 3. The figures are very similar to results for\nAustria, where cash payments accounted for 86% of all direct payment transactions in 2005 (Mooslechner, Stix\nECB\nOn the basis of our empirical framework, we can do more to address this question. Consumers\ntell us how important long term acquaintance is for their choice of payment media, and we are\nable to test the economic significance of these preferences directly. Finally, we perform a\npowerful indirect test . Our survey results show that the prevalence of cash usage is especially\nstrong among the elderly: those aged 58 or older carry out 74% of the value of their payments\nwith cash while the share is 59% for those younger than 582. In the diffusion of innovations, it\nis quite typical that elderly people are \"laggards\", adopting the innovation late or never. Thus\nthe differential behaviour may well point to a state of incomplete diffusion. But average char-\nacteristics of elderly people \u00ad their education, income, consumption patterns etc. \u00ad also differ\nfrom those of younger people, making a deviating behaviour explicable in terms of economic\nchoice. We investigate the influence of age once all other characteristics are controlled for, in\norder to gauge the \"pure\" effect of age on payment behaviour.\nWe employ a survey data set which provides rich information. The data set comprises trans-\naction records from a payment diary as well as detailed information on various more general\naspects of respondents' payment behaviour, including self-assessed payment routines at vari-\nous spending places. We estimate a model of payment behaviour which embraces both the\ndecision on the personal payment infrastructure (\"card adoption decision\") and then \u00ad for a\ngiven infrastructure \u00ad the share of cash payments (\"intensity decision\").3 Variants of this\nmodel are estimated for observed (short-run) transactions data as well as for the self-assessed\n(longer-run) payment behaviour.\nOur results suggest that individuals seem to base their choice of payment instruments and\nhence their use of cash on systematic decisions: payment behaviour can be explained by vari-\nables describing the nature of transactions, the characteristics of payment instruments and\nindividuals. The behavioural functions for young and old consumers are rather similar, and\nmost of the age-related differences in payment behaviour can be explained by differences in\ncharacteristics of younger and older individuals. This makes it unlikely that the observed high\nprevalence of cash payments observed for Germany is predominantly the result of habit per-\nsistence. Ceteris paribus, i.e. with current technology and given the other factors in individual\ndecisions, the share of cash in total transactions is unlikely to erode much further. This may\n2 The choice of an age of 58 as the dividing line between old and young is based on statistical tests indicating\nthat the cash shares for the first seven age deciles (57 and younger) are similar. See Table A2 in the appendix.\n3 Note that we treat the technical payment infrastructure, such as the number of card payment terminals, as given.\nFor example, Markose & Loke (2003) or Rysman (2006) focus on both the demand and the supply side.\nchange with further technological or behavioural shifts or with changes in the strategies of\nmerchants and network providers.. Finally, we find that owning a credit card (in addition to a\ndebit card) does not significantly affect the use of cash in Germany. This indicates that credit\ncards are substitutes for other non-cash payment media rather than for cash. Given that credit\ncards are mainly used as payment devices in Germany and not because of their credit func-\ntion, this result is not surprising4.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Chapter 2 describes the distinguishing features of our study\nwith regard to the literature. Chapter 3 develops the analytical framework upon which our\nempirical model is built. The data on payment behaviour in Germany is presented in Chapter\n4. Estimation results are presented in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 concludes.\n2. Background and contribution\nFollowing the literature, we propose a comprehensive empirical approach, where both the\nadoption decision and the intensity decision are modelled as depending on (i) transaction and\npersonal characteristics, including the transaction structure (cf. Santomero & Seater 1996;\nWhitesell 1992 or Shy & Tarkka 2002) (ii) the relative cost of cash and card usage. (Attana-\nerences for certain characteristics of payment media, e.g. the desire for anonymity or expen-\napproach allows us to evaluate the explanatory power of a payment choice model and thus to\nassess whether the high cash intensity can be explained in economic terms or whether it pre-\ndominantly reflects habit persistence.\nOur paper contributes to this literature in several respects. First, we provide evidence about\nwhich factors (including ownership of a credit card) determine the total cash share of a given\nconsumer's total payments. The paper is thus positioned between the newer empirical litera-\n4 In Germany overdraft credit lines of checking accounts are widespread, and people can access them using their\ndebit card. Almost everybody pays off credit card balances in full at the end of the month in Germany, i.e. credit\ncards are typically used as payment devices and not to get credit. According to the ECB Blue Book as of\nMio. credit cards are only providing delayed debit functionality.\n5 Some of these hypotheses are competing. For example, Markose & Loke (2003) argue that cash and card\npayments are perfect substitutes while Drehmann, Goodhart & Krueger (2002) maintain that cash and payment\ncards are not perfect substitutes because cash has the distinctive feature of preserving anonymity.\nECB\nture on the demand for currency (Attanasio, Guiso & Jappelli 2002, Alvarez & Lippi 2009,\nLippi & Secchi 2009, Stix 2004) and the rich literature on the choice of payment instruments (\ne.g. Borzekowski, Kiser & Ahmed, 2008; Zinman, 2009) . These two strands of the literature\nhave been rather separate but share many similarities; our paper contributes to recent attempts\nto bridge this gap (Klee 2008). Our approach differs from the former by not only focusing on\nthe importance of the withdrawal technology (ATM usage) but also on the impact of available\npayment options (card ownership).6 Furthermore, our interest is in the scale of cash transac-\ntions, while this literature has typically studied how ATM usage affects cash demand, taking\nthe scale of cash transactions as given. A notable difference from the literature on the choice\nof payment instruments is that we analyze both the extent and the likelihood of cash-card sub-\nstitution, while many papers typically model just the latter. Also, the focus on the cash share\nimproves upon some previous papers which, due to data limitations, base their measure of the\nusage intensity of payment instruments on usage frequency alone (e.g. debit card usage fre-\nquency) without scaling for the total number of transactions (e.g. Borzekowski, Kiser &\nAhmed 2008). A distinctive feature of our approach is that we calculate the cash share by\nexcluding those transactions that can be carried out only using cash or cards, respectively.\nHence, our model conditions on the existence of a true choice among payment instruments.\nSecond, we also analyze the payment behaviour of consumers for different transaction types\nor spending categories (e.g. daily retail expenditures versus gas stations). This accounts for\nthe robust finding in the literature that the payment behaviour differs across these categories\nor types.7 Our model explicitly accounts for the simultaneity of the decision to adopt a pay-\nment card and the decision on how available payment media are used, building upon results\nfrom the demand for currency literature (e.g. Attanasio, Guiso & Jappelli 2002).\nThird, related previous studies that use microdata have often been confined to studying only a\nrelatively limited set of explanatory factors. For example, among the studies that analyze\ncash-card substitution at the level of individuals, one strand of the literature emphasizes the\nrelative costs of cash and card usage, often proxied by socio-demographic variables (e.g. Stix\n2004), while another strand also takes account of the role of preferences or payment attributes\n(e.g. Borzekowski & Kiser 2008, Mantel 2000a). Relatively few papers explicitly account for\n6 For example, Lippi & Secchi (2009) assume that the existence of payment cards does not affect the parameters\nof cash demand.\n7 In contrast to Bounie & Francois (2006) and Hayashi & Klee (2003), for example, we do not have information\non the physical characteristics of the point of sale (e.g. the absence of a cashier or the availability of self-service).\ntransaction characteristics, though these have been shown to be of significant importance\ndirect survey information about each group of potentially important factors \u00ad transaction and\npersonal characteristics, proxy variables for the relative costs of cash and card usage, and as-\nsessments of given payment medium characteristics. This, in turn, allows us to focus on the\nsignificance of interpersonal differences, and to measure the extent of explained and unex-\nplained differences in the behaviour of older and younger consumers \u00ad which might be of\ncentral importance for predicting the future of cash. To our knowledge, this issue has not been\naddressed in detail in the literature.8\n3. Analytical Framework\nIn order to fix ideas, we will first outline the individual's decision problem in a transaction\ncost model. Individual i chooses a payment structure to minimize transaction costs. A pay-\nment structure is a vector\nc\n   t      \nK j\ni i i i i\np p ... p p j { ... K}\np\nHere, j\ni\np is the sum of transactions using payment instrument j carried out by individual i.\nMore specifically, let the first entry, 0\ni\np , refer to cash transactions and the other entries,\ni i\np ... p\n  , to transactions associated with various non-cash payment instruments. The ex-\npected total transaction volume, i\nT , is given, as are the characteristics of the individual,\ni\nx .\nTransaction costs are given as a function of the payment structure and various individual\ncharacteristics, including the planned structure of expenditure. For example, the relative costs\nof using cash or credit cards will depend on whether a person likes to dine out or whether this\nperson orders over the internet. We assume that it is possible to pay cash in every situation\nand that the marginal transaction costs of cash are constant. They are normalized to 1. Mar-\nginal costs of other payment alternatives depend on the individual's characteristics. The costs\nof using a given medium of payment vary across transaction types \u00ad it is easy to pay cash in a\n8 Borzekowski & Kiser (2008) are the only example we are aware of. In particular, in a counterfactual exercise\nthe population is \"aged\" and the authors analyze how this affects market shares of various payment instruments\nin the U.S. In contrast to our approach, however, these market shares are only hypothetical, not accounting for\nthe transaction intensity.\nECB\nretail market, yet many retail markets will only reluctantly accept credit cards. Similarly, time\ncosts differ (Klee, 2008). Ex post, we may always order transactions by the ease with which\nthey can be carried out using a given payment instrument. Therefore, by definition, the mar-\nginal costs of using this payment instrument as opposed to cash will increase. In order to ex-\npose the general structure of the problem, we may assume the following (quadratic) transac-\ntion costs function:\n( ) ( )\nK\nk k k k\ni i i i i i i\nk\nc c p p p\n   \n\u00a6\nx p x\nThis leads to simple first order conditions and can be seen as a second order approximation to\nany more complicated cost function. Here, k\ni\nE\nx gives the costs of the first (and cheapest)\ntransactions using the means of payment k. The coefficient k\nJ governs the ascent of the costs,\nas an increasing share of i\nT is carried out using k. It is clear that not all elements of\ni\np will\nbe positive for all households. If\nE t\nk\ni\nx ,\nit will not be worthwhile to use payment instrument k at all, because even the first transaction\nwill be more expensive than cash. If the inequality does not hold (and cash is used at all), then\na positive number of payments will be made using k .\nThus, the decision is the outcome of a cost minimization problem subject to non-negativity\nconstraints regarding the elements of\ni\np and the constraint that the sum of payments adds up\nto the individual's specific transaction volume:\nError! Objects cannot be created from editing field codes.\nsuch that\nk\ni\np k { ... K}\nt       and\nK\nk\ni\ni\nk\np T \n\u00a6\nAs it stands, this is a corner solution model, one of the ways the general censored regression\nmodel can be interpreted (see Wooldridge 2002, pp. 517). The solution yields a range of ac-\ntively used payment instruments, together with the quantities for those in active use. Adoption\nand the choice of intensity are really just different aspects of the same decision.\nIn a more complex reality, however, there may also be fixed costs for the use of certain pay-\nment media, such as credit card fees, paperwork, learning costs or other restrictions such as\ncredit constraints (cf. Zinman 2009). Furthermore, unobserved variables may influence the\nadoption and intensity decisions in different yet correlated ways. We therefore choose to\nmodel the decisions on adoption and intensity in a less integrated way, using limited informa-\ntion estimators (probit estimations for the adoption decision and instrumental variable regres-\nsions for intensity) as well as full information maximum likelihood estimators (multivariate\nprobit estimation for payment instrument adoption and self-assessed payment instrument use\nfor different transaction types).\nIn our dataset, we observe the adoption decisions (ownership) for a variety of payment media.\nHowever, not owning a debit card is a rare exception in Germany, and non-cash payment me-\ndia other than debit and credit cards are either not widespread or used rather infrequently.\nTherefore, we will focus on cash, debit cards and credit cards.\nWe have two different sources for measuring payment instrument usage: the payment diary\nyields transaction data for a short period of time (one week), and the interviews give us self-\nassessments for the use of cash and a variety of non-cash payment media, by type of transac-\ntion. When using the payment diary transaction data, we estimate structural relationships for\nthe share of cash in total payments:\ni\ni j\ni\nj\np\ns\np\n\u00a6 ,\ntogether with the empirically most important adoption decision, namely the acquisition of a\ncredit card. In a first set of estimates, a linear model for\ni\ns is chosen, where credit card\nownership\ni\ncc figures as an endogenous regressor,\n' J\n \ni i i i\ns \u00df cc u\nThis is complemented by a standard probit model for credit card adoption:\ni i i\ncc U K\n !\nwhere\ni\ncc assumes a value of 1 if the individual owns a credit card and zero otherwise. For\nthe model to be identified, some exclusion restrictions of U and E need to be imposed.\nECB\nOur short-run transaction data is rather noisy, as we follow individuals for only one week.\nFurthermore, payment behaviour is likely to depend very much on the type of transaction.\nTherefore a second set of estimations combines, in a series of multivariate probits, the credit\ncard adoption decision with the prevalence of cash payments for two different types of trans-\nactions, namely payment behaviour in daily retail transactions and at gas stations. In the two\npayment behaviour equations, the LHS variable j\ni\npv (prevalence) assumes a value of 1 if the\nindividual generally and exclusively uses cash for transaction type j (daily retail or gas sta-\ntion).\n^ `\ni i i\nj j j\ni i i i\ncc\npv cc j\n !\n  ! \nx\nx\nAgain, appropriate identifying exclusion restrictions have to be imposed on\nE and\nj\nE . The\nerror terms of all equations are allowed to be correlated. This is a recursive simultaneous\nequation model of the adoption decision and transaction type specific intensities, both meas-\napplication.9\nIn modelling the payment decision, we make a distinct effort to take due account of individu-\nals' heterogeneity by conditioning on their assessment of the characteristics of payment in-\nstruments and the structure of expenditure. Regarding certain characteristics of payment in-\nstruments, like convenience or anonymity, we use direct measures, as they will be evaluated\nby different individuals in different ways. In addition, we include measures of the frequency,\nof transaction types, as there may be supply constraints that induce a propensity to use a pay-\nment instrument in one context more than in the other.\n4. The Dataset\nThe data for this study are drawn from \"Payment Habits in Germany\", a representative survey\nof individuals aged 18 years or older living in Germany. The survey was conducted by Ipsos\non behalf of the Deutsche Bundesbank in April, May and June 2008. Based on a random sam-\n9 In our estimations, we calculate a simulated likelihood on the basis of pseudo-random variates using the\nGeweke-Hajivassiliou-Keene (GHK) simulator with 2000 draws.\nL\u00e4nder.10 The interviews were conducted face-to-face using a programmed questionnaire tool\n(CAPI). A special feature of the survey is that the face-to-face interviews were supplemented\nwith a drop-off payment diary which was to be completed by the interviewed person in the\nseven days following the interview (2,227 persons returned the drop-off diary).\nThe payment diary collects information on all individual transactions the interviewed person\nconducts during a one-week period (in total, more than 25,500 transactions were recorded)11.\nThese include the euro amount of each transaction, the type of location where the transaction\ntook place (shop, restaurant, internet, etc.) and the payment medium used to settle it (cash and\na list of ten cashless payment methods, e.g. debit cards, credit cards, internet payment ser-\nvices, mobile phone payments, fingerprint payment). The persons keeping the diary were\nfurthermore asked to indicate whether they would have been able to settle a given transaction\nin cash in the event that they had paid with a non-cash instrument and vice versa.\nThe CAPI interviews supplement this information by providing data on various aspects of a\nperson's payment behaviour, like ownership of payment cards, assessments of certain features\nof payment methods (anonymity, convenience, expenditure control, etc.) and on cash with-\ndrawal behaviour. Additionally, the survey contains questions on factors that may influence\nan individual's decision to pay cash or use alternative methods of payment, such as demo-\ngraphic characteristics and income.\nThe next two subsections give an overview of how the data from the survey are used to con-\nstruct both the dependent and the explanatory variables. Table A1 in the appendix contains\nfurther details.\n4.1. Dependent Variables\nThe first stage of our empirical analysis is directed towards the decision to adopt a credit card.\nGiven the analytical framework and data characteristics, we restrict our sample to persons\nThe sampling technique comprised three stages. In the first stage, regions were selected (\"sample points\"),\nwhich were used to define starting points/addresses for the second stage, in which interviewers contacted\nhouseholds based on a random route procedure. Finally, an eligible person in each contacted household was\nrandomly selected.\n11 We only collect information on direct payment transactions in the analysis, i.e. all transactions apart from\nrecurrent transactions, which are typically settled by direct debit or by bank transfers (e.g. rent, insurance fees,\ntelephone bills, utility bills).\nECB\nwho own a debit card (\"Maestro\", \"`EC' card\", \"girocard\").12 This restriction takes account of\nthe fact that almost all (adult) respondents own a debit card and hardly anybody owns a credit\ncard without also owning a debit card. The lack of variation renders it difficult to implement a\nmeaningful econometric model of the debit card adoption decision.\nFor the second stage, the intensity decision, we focus on two types of dependent variables,\nboth of which measure the intensity of cash usage of an individual. These variables differ in\nseveral respects and allow us to address different aspects of the payment behaviour.\n(i) For our first dependent variable, we use the individual transaction record and calculate\nfor each person the volume share of cash expenditures\ni\ns , i.e. the share based on the\nnumber of transactions. Importantly, the cash share is calculated only for those trans-\nactions for which the respondent was actually confronted with a choice, i.e. we ex-\nclude those cash or card transactions where no other medium of payment was accepted\nby the merchant.\n(ii) The second set of dependent variables focuses on the payment behaviour for particular\nexpenditure types (e.g. daily retail transactions and gas stations). In particular, during\nthe CAPI interviews respondents were asked to indicate how they usually pay at vari-\nous spending locations, choosing among one or more payment media from a given list\n(e.g. \"cash\", \"debit card\", \"credit card\"). Using this information, we construct a binary\nvariable which takes a value of one if an individual pays generally or exclusively cash\nand zero if an individual either partly or exclusively uses non-cash media of payments\nfor the given type of transaction. In the empirical model, we consider this binary vari-\nable to be the observed counterpart to the latent variable which measures the share of\nnon-cash expenditures. As regards the choice of expenditure types, we select those\ntypes for which we observe the highest total expenditure during the one-week diary\nperiod (grossed up over all persons): daily retail expenditure and gas stations.13\n12 Persons not owning any cards (165 obs.) will \u00ad by definition \u00ad not be able to make any POS transactions by\nmedia other than cash (their cash intensity is 100%). They are therefore excluded from our analysis. We also\nexclude those stating that they use a debit card but do not hold an account (23 obs.).\n13 In principle, the information about the cash share for different expenditure types could also be extracted from\nthe short-run payment diary data. However, most of the transactions recorded in the diary are retail transactions\n(44 %) and no other spending place reaches more than 10% of total transactions recorded. Thus, there is only a\nvery small number of transactions other than retail. Given that we also exclude transactions where no alternative\nmedia of payment was accepted, the number would be even lower. Therefore, we resort to the long-run payment\nbehaviour as described by the CAPI data.\nDescriptive statistics for the dependent variables are summarized in Table 1. The table reports\nsummary statistics for value shares and volume shares (numbers of transactions), both for all\npayments and the subset that excludes those cash payments where no alternative payment\nmedia were accepted. Furthermore, the binary variables reporting self-assessed payment be-\nhaviour in retail shops and at gas stations are described. Subsequently, we will refer to the two\ntypes of payment data as short-run (payment diary) and long-run (CAPI). It should be borne\nin mind that the two sets of variables differ by their time horizon, their content (actual behav-\niour versus self-assessed behaviour) and their source (transaction records vs. personal inter-\nview). Evidently, they also differ by their scope (observed overall share of cash expenditures,\na continuous variable, versus a latent variable for the share of cash expenditures for particular\ntypes of expenditure), such that different estimation techniques are required. In light of these\nsubstantial differences, we are convinced that considering the results for both sets of variables\nwill constitute a rather solid basis for making judgments on the robustness of our findings.\n4.2. Explanatory variables\nIn selecting the independent variables we follow the literature. Our model includes measures\nof income, consumption patterns, the user cost of cash, assessments of specific characteristics\nof payment instruments, a network density measure as well as several socio-demographic\nvariables. As the list of potentially relevant independent variables is quite long, we will\nbriefly describe the most relevant variables and their expected effects on the adoption and\nintensity decision. Summary statistics are shown in Table 2.\nIncome is mainly important for the adoption decision where it plays a dual role. First, house-\nhold income (HH_INCOME) measures the scale of transaction or the composition of expen-\nditures and should be positively correlated with the utility from card ownership. Second, in-\ncome affects the willingness of banks to grant credit cards to costumers. As a monitoring de-\nvice, banks observe income which is transferred onto a given account. Therefore, we con-\nstruct a variable that measures the net income of a person if this person has an account\n(ACCOUNT_INC). If a person does not own an account but nevertheless has access to an\naccount (e.g. joint account with a partner) this variable takes on the value of the household\nECB\nincome. In both cases, the variable proxies the financial situation of the respondent as ob-\nserved by banks. The willingness of banks to approve credit cards is also related to the type of\nbanks where respondents have their account. In particular, direct banks do not have branches\nand supposedly are more inclined to issue payment cards than banks with a dense network of\nbranches or ATMs (DIRECTBANK).\nEven when accounting for income, heterogeneity in the composition of consumption expen-\nditure can be substantial. For example, those conducting internet transactions will have a\nhigher non-cash share of expenditure than those who do not make such transactions. The\ntransaction data from the diary cover a period of only one week, and the recorded transactions\nare rather heterogeneous with respect to both their type and their size. Controlling for the\nstructure of the recorded transactions is therefore essential. Therefore, we control for both of\nthese effects. Regarding transaction types, we use the frequencies of expenditure relating to\n(1) durable goods, (2) gas stations, (3) restaurants, hotels and cafes, (4) services (at home and\noutside home), (5) drugstores, vending machines and leisure, and (6) other, with daily retail\nbeing the reference category. In addition, we include the average value of transactions\n(AVG_VAL_TRANS), as the relative costs of using cash or card (by transaction) can be ex-\npected to vary strongly with the size of payments.\nThe costs of cash and card usage should both affect the adoption and the intensity decision.\nOur dataset allows us to consider three types of cash-related costs. First, we include the time\n(in minutes) it takes the respondent to get to the location where cash is usually withdrawn (a\nbank or an ATM, whichever is closer \u00ad DIST_WITHDR). The second type of cash-related\ncost arises from the subjective risk of being robbed or pick-pocketed (RISK_THEFT). We\nalso include a variable for measuring the availability of payment cards at the POS. In particu-\nlar, we have constructed a dummy variable which measures whether respondents are frequent\nusers of ATMs (ATM_USER) \u00ad as the payment function and the withdrawal function are\nusually integrated on the same card. The availability of this card in the wallet eases its use for\npayments, thereby reducing the cost of card usage relative to cash usage.\nThe density of the POS terminal network differs regionally \u00ad a higher POS terminal density\nshould reduce the net costs of card adoption and, evidently, should decrease the share of cash\nexpenditures. We generate a measure for POS density from the survey data. For all transac-\ntions recorded in the payment diary, respondents register whether payment can be carried out\nusing cards. The survey sample is regionally clustered, and we calculate \u00ad region by region \u00ad\nthe share of points-of-sale that allow cashless payments (POS_DENSITY). The value thus\nobtained is region-specific.\nWe also consider assessments of certain payment instruments' characteristics. In particular,\nrespondents were questioned about what characteristics they consider important for a payment\ninstrument. Among our conditioning variables is information on whether the following char-\nacteristics are of high importance for the value of a payment instrument: protection of pri-\nvacy/anonymity (P_ANONYMITY), the possibility to make payments abroad (P_ABROAD),\nthe possibility to make payments on the internet (P_INTERNET), long-lasting experience\nwith a payment instrument (P_HABIT), the time needed for effecting payments (P_TIME)\nand the facilitation of expenditure control (P_EXPCONTR).14 In general, these indicators are\nequal to 1 if the respondent assesses the respective characteristic as \"indispensable\" and 0\notherwise. The other options were \"rather important\" and \"unimportant\". When constructing\nP_ABROAD and P_INTERNET, we code the indicator as 1 if the respective quality is re-\ngarded as \"indispensable\" or \"rather important\", due to the small number of respondents\nchoosing the highest ranking.\nFinally, we include a set of socio-demographic characteristics: gender (MALE), levels of edu-\ncation (EDU_MEDIUM, EDU_HIGH, EDU_UNI), as well as dummies for labour market\nstatus (e.g. EMPLOYED). Depending on the context (adoption or intensity), some of these\nvariables control for opportunity costs of time (education, employment status) or for credit-\nworthiness (banks are less likely to grant access to credit cards to unemployed persons). Age,\ntoo, might exert an effect via different channels: e.g. the shadow value of time or the propen-\nsity to adapt to new technologies or the composition of expenditures. Most variables are inter-\nacted with a dummy indicating an age of 58 and above (\"_o\" appended to the name of the\nrespective variable).\nAs discussed, our empirical framework accounts for the endogeneity of the credit card vari-\nable. Identification of the instrumental variable approach requires finding variables that are\ncorrelated with the credit card adoption decision but uncorrelated with the error term in the\nintensity decision equation. In our estimations, we choose the following three variables as\ninstruments: DIRECTBANK, ACCOUNT_INC and JOINT_ACCOUNT, the last taking a\nvalue of 1 if the respondent does not own a bank account, while still having access to one.\n14 The formulation of this question is such that it refers to payment instruments in general and not to a particular\npayment instrument.\nECB\nThe variables referring to accounts are proxies for information that banks can observe and use\nwhen deciding whether or not to grant access to a credit card.\n5. Results\nEstimation results are summarized in Table 3. The adoption equation, estimated by univariate\nprobit, is depicted in column I. Column II summarizes OLS estimates for the share of cash\npayments, and column III estimates obtained by an instrumental variable (IV) approach, ac-\ncounting for the endogeneity of credit card ownership.15 The multivariate probit estimates are\ngrouped in column IV. The estimated system contains equations explaining the prevalence of\n(exclusive) cash payments in daily retail and gas stations and again the credit card adoption\ndecision. The results for the credit card adoption those from those reported in column I for\ntwo reasons. First, the system estimate enhances efficiency by taking the correlation of error\nterms into account. Second, the system equations can be estimated only for those respondents\nwho report both retail transactions and transactions at gas stations, effectively excluding peo-\nple who do not own a motorized vehicle.\nWe begin the discussion of our findings with a short overview of the main results and then\nmove on to a discussion of some detailed results regarding specific groups of explanatory\nvariables.\nOur main question is whether a model based on economic choice is able to account for ob-\nserved payment patterns. With a view on the high share of cash in Germany, a plausible alter-\nnative could be habit persistence. Regarding this question, we want to concentrate on the\nequations explaining credit card ownership and long-run payment habits (column IV). The\nsigns of the estimated coefficients are consistent with rational behaviour. The high predictive\npower of the choice equations \u00ad 78% of cases are correctly classified in the adoption decision,\n15 As noted above, the LHS variable is the share based on the volume of transactions. The results for the share\nbased on the value of transactions are very similar, qualitatively.\nand 70% and 74% in the two equations describing payment patterns \u00ad indicates that the vari-\nables explain a significant part of the variation in payment behaviour. At the same time, we\nobserve that our direct measure for habit persistence (PREF_HABIT) is insignificant in all our\nequations explaining cash shares or cash prevalence. Both results provide evidence against the\npredominance of habit persistence.\nAnother very important clue comes from analysing young and old consumers separately. The\nobserved payment patterns of these two groups clearly differ. If habit persistence were im-\nportant, we would expect that a large share of this age differential could be attributed to dif-\nferences in estimated coefficients and not to differences in characteristics. The results of a\ndecomposition show that most of the age gap can be attributed to differences in measured\ncharacteristics and not to age as such. In other words, older consumers use more cash than\nyounger consumers mainly because they have different characteristics (e.g. lower income,\nmore time, etc.) and not because they are old.\nWe obtain important results on the role of credit card ownership in the intensity decision. Es-\ntimating the intensity decision equation by OLS, i.e. treating the credit card variable as ex-\nogenous, yields a negative and significant coefficient of credit card ownership. However, if\ncredit card ownership is treated as endogenous, the variable becomes insignificant. This result\nis very robust, holding for long-term and short-term payment behaviour alike as well as for\ndifferent sets of instruments. After controlling for the fact that the adoption and the intensity\ndecision are driven by largely the same set of variables, exogenous variations in credit card\nownership do not seem to influence the cash share in transactions. We will discuss the impli-\ncations of this finding in the conclusions.\nMore generally we learn that the choice and the use of payment instruments constitute a deci-\nsion problem, for which many factors are relevant (cf. with Zinman, 2009). It is therefore es-\nsential to jointly analyze several groups of potentially important variables \u00adthe \"broader pic-\nture\"\u00ad in order to understand the payment behaviour of individuals.\nIn the next sections we will discuss the details of our findings with respect to groups of vari-\nables included in our empirical model \u00ad transaction characteristics, relative costs of cash and\ncard usage, assessments of characteristics of payment instruments, demographics and credit\ncard ownership.\nECB\n5.2 Transaction characteristics\nFor the OLS and IV estimations of the cash share equation using transaction data (columns II\nand III), most of our choice-based variables turn out to be of limited importance. Estimates\nare clearly dominated by the technical characteristics of transactions. In particular, the aver-\nage value and the type of transaction are highly relevant for the observed share of cash in\ntransactions, whereas the other variables turn out to be mostly insignificant (two notable ex-\nceptions being ATM_USER and P_INTERNET). The high importance of the average value of\ntransactions corresponds well with the theoretical (Whitesell 1992) and the empirical litera-\nimportance of technical characteristics of payments does not run counter to an explanation in\nterms of rational choice. Transaction value is certainly linked to relative costs, as is the type\nof transaction. However, the result that the choice of payment instruments strongly depends\non the type of transaction could also be the result of entrenched behavioural patterns, related\nto framing.\nFrom this first set of estimates we learn two things. First, payment behaviour varies greatly by\ntype of transaction. It does not appear to be meaningful to aggregate across all types of\nspending, and more can be learnt by analyzing transaction types separately. Second, the deci-\nsion to acquire a credit card is endogenous and can lead to important biases if this is ignored.\nAccounting for this endogeneity shows that credit card ownership does not significantly affect\nthe use of cash.\nOur second set of estimates draws the practical conclusions from these lessons, as they are\nconditional on type of transaction and credit card ownership. As a reminder, the latter is\ntreated in a simultaneous equation framework (multivariate probit estimation) with cash\nprevalence (column IV). In the subsections that follow, we focus mainly on these results.\nOverall, we find that all groups of explanatory variables (demographics, expenditure struc-\nture, the relative price of cash usage and preference for certain media of payment characteris-\ntics) are important.\nOur findings suggest that the relative costs of cash and card usage are important determinants\nfor cash use. We show that individuals using ATMs frequently tend to use less cash for their\ntransactions than other individuals, both in the regressions for cash share in transactions and\nin the multivariate probit modelling long-run payment behaviour. This may seem surprising,\nbecause for these people withdrawing cash is cheap, which should favour its use in transac-\ntions. However, frequent ATM users also have their debit cards at hand most of the time,\nsince they need them in order to be able to withdraw money. They are also familiar with using\ntheir cards and punching their PIN code into an electronic machine. The familiarity and per-\nmanent availability of non-cash payment instruments seem to drive their behaviour, rather\nthan the low cost of withdrawing money. A positive effect of ATM card ownership on debit\ncard use is also reported in Zinman (2009) for the US.\nWe were surprised to see that our risk of theft variable exerts a significant and numerically\nstrong positive effect on the propensity to use cash in daily transactions. It is conceivable that\nfeelings of vulnerability are correlated over means of payment, and that people who feel un-\neasy with large amounts of cash are even more afraid of defraud associated with card pay-\nhood of credit card adoption. This seems plausible, given that a high POS density implies that\ndebit card transactions are possible almost everywhere and credit cards, if solely used because\nof their payment function, are redundant. This result may well be specific for Germany, where\nthe number of shops accepting credit cards used to be relatively small.16\n5.4 Assessments of characteristics of payment instruments\nStated preferences for certain characteristics payment instruments are closely linked to the\ncredit card adoption decision, as expected. The results for the probit estimation of the adop-\ntion equation indicate that individuals having a specific need for credit card services, e.g. to\nconduct transactions on the internet or abroad, have a higher likelihood of credit card owner-\nship. Surprisingly, a preference towards long-lasting experience regarding the use of payment\ninstruments is associated with a higher rate of credit card ownership, at least for people under\nthe age of 58. For the prevalence of cash, this variable is unimportant. An interesting finding\nfrom this block of variables is that consumers for whom the ability to use a payment instru-\nment on the internet or abroad is important pay cash less frequently at retailers and gas sta-\n16 Currently, electronic point-of-sale terminals used by merchants have the technology to process both debit\ncards and credit cards. However, there are transaction types, such as in grocery stores, where debit card\npayments are allowed but not credit card payments. Given the technical infrastructure, the opposite is less likely,\nas purely paper-based credit card payments are about to vanish. This could imply that the coefficient for the POS\ndensity could actually reflect past rather than current POS densities, when the technology gap between debit and\ncredit card payments was larger.\nment. They may wish to keep control. POS_DENSITY exerts a negative effect on the likeli-\nECB\ntion, a result which has previously also been reported by Hayashi and Klee (2003) and, for\ndebit card use, by Zinman (2009). This may be due to correlated individual-specific \"technical\ninclination\" effects on several dimensions of behaviour, but learning effects are possible too:\nthe experience gained with electronic payments online and abroad may be transferred to other\nspending locations.\n5.5 Age and other demographic factors\nDemographic factors are a third group of explanatory variables which play an important role\nfor adoption and intensity. The coefficients we obtain in the adoption equation are in line with\nour expectations and previous findings in the literature. Relatively high household income and\nhigh levels of education increase the probability of credit card ownership significantly.\nDemographic characteristics also have a strong influence on the long-term payment behaviour\nat retailers and gas stations.\nBy interacting all major variables17 with a dummy for old age, we put special emphasis on the\neffect of age. As can be seen from the descriptive statistics in Table 1, cash prevalence, the\nshare of cash transactions and the level of credit card ownership are all clearly lower for older\npeople. However, older people and younger people differ in more respects than just age. They\nalso differ e.g. in employment status, income, risk aversion, etc, as is detailed in the supple-\nmentary statistics in Table 2. It is of interest to assess the effect of age on cash usage that can-\nnot be attributed to differences in average age-related characteristics.\nActually, the effect of age as such seems to be of limited importance. First, despite the large\ndifferences in average payment behaviour, the shift dummy variable for old age (\"OLD\") is\ninsignificant in all estimates. In the single equation probit estimation for credit card ownership\ndepicted in column I, only the habit variable has a significant different effect for older people.\nUnlike younger people, credit card use by older people is negatively associated with a high\npreference for dealing with familiar payment media. The multivariate probit equation detects\na further, equally intuitive difference: older consumers tend to dislike credit cards if they have\na high preference for quick handling of payments, unlike younger people.\nIt is not enough, though, to only look at differences with respect to the significance of coeffi-\n17 Not interacted are the gender variable, the three indicators for education status and the frequencies of\nexpenditure for given transaction types included in the OLS and IV regressions.\ncients. The insignificant differences might \u00ad taken together \u00ad generate a sizeable variation in\npredicted values. We therefore analyze how much of the difference in mean predicted values\nfor young and old individuals can be explained by differences in characteristics, assuming that\nthe coefficients for young consumers also apply for old consumers (i.e. setting the old age\ninteraction terms equal to zero). This is done both for the estimate of the cash share and the\nthree multivariate probit equations.18\nFor the OLS estimates, 58% of the between age-group differences in the average cash share of\nexpenditures are explained by differences in characteristics. The remaining gap is not only\ndue to differences in coefficients, but can also partly be attributed to a second-order decompo-\nsition effect (multiplicative effect of differences in characteristics and coefficients). For the\nmultivariate probit model, the explanatory power of our model is much greater. Here, it is\n84% of the differences in retail cash prevalence, and 83% of the differences in gas station\ncash prevalence that are purely due to between age-group differences in characteristics. The\nfact that a large extent of the between-age group difference can be accounted for by observed\nvariables speaks for the validity of our model. For credit card ownership, differential charac-\nteristics actually account for 139% of the observed differences in ownership. This \"over-ex-\nplanation\" can be attributed to the fact that credit card ownership for older people is the result\nof a decision made in the past, when important characteristics like employment or household\nincome may have been similar to today's younger consumers.\n18 For the share of cash payments, we use OLS estimates or this decomposition, as OLS is the best linear\npredictor.\nECB\n5.6 Robustness Checks\nTo assess the reliability of our findings, we conducted several robustness test. A first group of\ntests concerns the estimation method. We run a series of bivariate probit models (with only\none transaction type and credit card as the independent variables) taking endogeneity into\nseeds for the multivariate probit. We also use different simulation methods (GHK, Halton\ndraws).\nAnother group of robustness checks concerns the independent variables. The OLS and IV\nresults presented here relate to the share of cash in the volume of transactions, and \u00ad as ex-\nplained above \u00ad in calculating this share we eliminate those transactions where dealers did not\naccept anything but cash. However, we also run estimates for the share of cash in the value of\ntransactions, and we dropped the restriction on transactions included. By and large the main\nresults qualitatively hold for all these different specifications.\n6. Conclusions and scope for further research\nWe have analyzed the determinants of the cash share of German consumers' expenditure, fo-\ncusing on the average payment behaviour over time. Our findings show that the choice and\nthe use of payment instruments follow multi-stage and multi-layered patterns. First, adoption\nand use of payment media are influenced to a great extent by the same variables, hence ren-\ndering joint modelling essential. In fact, neglecting this simultaneity would result in biased\nestimates, and the conclusions on the effect of payment card ownership on cash usage would\nbe misleading. Second, we find that transaction and personal characteristics, the relative costs\nof cash and card usage, and individuals' assessments of characteristics of payment instru-\nments' are important determinants of cash usage. This finding implies that the use of cash\nfollows predictable patterns consistent with rational economic behaviour.19 This is evidence\nagainst habit persistence as a predominant explanation of the enduringly high share of cash.\nThird, our analysis confirms the finding of the literature that payment behaviour differs across\nspending categories. Fourth, we find some differences in the behavioural equations of\nyounger and older consumers. However, these are not overly important in terms of explaining\nthe differences in observed behaviour. Most of the higher prevalence of cash payments among\n19 Zinman (2009) draws a similar conlusion for the use of debit and credit cards.\nolder consumers can be explained by differences in their personal characteristics, including a\nnumber of variables measuring assessments of certain characteristics of payment instruments.\nTherefore, an interpretation in terms of incomplete diffusion is not supported.\nThe stability of coefficient over age groups shows that, in principle, the aggregate cash use\ncan be forecasted, conditional on assumptions on the evolution of characteristics for young\ncohorts in their old age. For a stable (ergodic) distribution of characteristics for old and young\npeople and their population shares, a stable cash share would result. That means that, as far as\ntomorrow's old consumers will be like old consumers today, there is no shift pre-programmed\nby a demographic \"changing of the guard\". Even if this stability of characteristics will cer-\ntainly not bear out, eg concerning education, income or preferences, cash does not seem on\nthe verge of disappearance. From what we have seen, it seems that the high cash share in\nGermany is unlikely to erode much in the near future, meaning that seigniorage revenues and\nthe cost of maintaining the cash payment system can be expected to remain relatively stable.\nAn important feature of our results is that, once endogeneity has been accounted for, credit\ncard ownership has no effect on the share of cash transactions. This result would be consistent\nwith the view that the decisions on adoption and intensity are hierarchical: the share of cash\npayments is decided first, and it is left to other variables to affect the decision with which of\nthe available payment instruments the non-cash share is effected. The variation of costs be-\ntween cash and the group of all non-cash payment instruments seems to dominate the varia-\ntion within the group of non-cash payment media. In other words: the relative costs of non-\ncash instruments vis-\u00e0-vis cash may be highly correlated. In any given decision context, there\ndoes not seem to be a big difference between the costs of \u00ador the utility consumers derive\nfrom\u00ad using debit and credit cards. We view this result as a direct consequence of the institu-\ntional frame of credit card usage in many European countries: overdraft credit lines of check-\ning accounts are widespread, and people can access them using their debit card. On the other\nhand, almost everybody pays off credit card balances in full at the end of the month, i.e. credit\ncards are typically used as payment devices. In this situation, it does not matter much for con-\nsumer which of the two payment instruments they use for domestic payments). Interestingly\nenough, the Economist reported that debit- and prepaid-card spending on Visa cards are ex-\npected to be higher in the U.S. this year than credit card purchases, as a result of recently\nwithdrawn credit lines (Economist, 2009).\nThis result suggests that the two competing systems of non-cash payments are close substi-\nECB\ntutes, at least with respect to their domestic payment functionality. This could imply that only\none of them or a combination of both may survive in the long run. However, as credit cards\nhave some distinctive features which debit cards currently do not have, like travel insurance\ncoverage or the possibility to make payments abroad, it is unlikely that credit cards will dis-\nappear.\nOur comprehensive empirical model has demonstrated that payment behaviour is rather com-\nplex. Clearly, more theoretical and empirical work is needed to fully understand the choices\nconsumers make. In this paper, we have concentrated on the overall cash share of a person. A\ndifferent topic of interest is the decision for each single transaction. The significant relation-\nship between the average value of transactions and the non-cash share as well as the different\ncoefficients in equations for different types of transaction already indicate that the specific\ntransaction characteristics have an influence on the choice of payment media for an individual\ntransaction. Another promising field for future research is to further study the role of intrinsic\ncharacteristics of cash and cards, e.g. expenditure control features or anonymity considera-\ntions \u00ad an issue we have only touched upon in this paper. Furthermore, our model explains\ninterpersonal differences, i.e. deviations from mean behaviour, but not the mean itself. In\nother words, although we were able to exclude habit persistence as a dominant explanation, it\nis still open why the cash share is in Germany is as high as it is. International comparisons\ninvolving characteristics of households and their behaviour are called for to answer this ques-\ntion. Ultimately, it would be interesting to study how the usage intensity of non-cash payment\ninstruments interacts with the demand for currency.\nReferences\nAlvarez, F. E. & Lippi, F. (2009).
