The purpose of this study\nwas to evaluate the relationship between elevated serum transferrin saturation\nand mortality.\nMETHODS This cohort study was conducted using data from the First Health and\npriate weights to make population estimates for the adult US population (aged 25 to\n74 years at baseline). All-cause mortality was evaluated in relation to serum transferrin\nsaturation of greater than 45%, greater than 50%, greater than 55%, and greater\nthan 60% using Cox proportional hazards regression.\nRESULTS In a Cox proportional hazards model controlling for potential confound-\ners, including comorbid diseases, smoking, and cholesterol, all-cause mortality\nis significantly greater for persons with a serum transferrin saturation of more\nthan 55%, compared with those with saturations below this cutoff (hazards ratio\nhemochromatosis as any of the 20 listed causes of death. Many of the underlying\ncauses of death for persons with serum transferrin saturation levels of more than\n55% are common causes of death in the general population, although these per-\nsons were more likely to have died of cirrhosis and diabetes, a finding consistent\nwith iron overload.\nCONCLUSIONS In this nationally representative cohort of adults, those with elevat-\ned serum transferrin saturation, more than 2% of the adult US population, were\nat increased risk for all-cause mortality.\nINTRODUCTION\nExcess iron and iron overload can facilitate the occurrence of a variety\nof diseases, including cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and\ncancer.1-4 Pathologic iron accumulation affects many organs, such\nas the liver, pancreas, and heart, among others.5 Hereditary iron overload\nis characterized by excessive intestinal absorption and cellular deposition\nof iron and is found in several conditions, including hemochromatosis,\nAfrican iron overload, and iron-loading anemias.2,4,6 Hemochromatosis is\namong the most common inherited metabolic abnormalities, particularly\namong those of Northern European origin.7-11\nSerum transferrin saturation is a commonly used indicator for a predis-\nposition of iron overload, and its measurement is a frequent first step in\nscreening protocols for hereditary hemochromatosis.5 A substantial propor-\ntion of adults in the United States have elevated transferrin saturation lev-\nels, although few have a diagnosed iron overload condition.9 Whereas iron\noverload facilitates certain disease processes, it is unclear whether elevated\ntransferrin saturation is a risk factor for mortality.\nElevated Serum Transferrin Saturation\nand Mortality\nArch G.

Several cross-sectional\nstudies have attempted to examine the mortality risk\nof being homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the\nHFE gene by investigating whether homozygotes were\nunderrepresented in older age-groups.12,13 These stud-\nies found that homozygotes were not underrepresented\nand argued that life-threatening disease might not occur\nin many C282Y homozygotes. These studies, however,\nwere not cohort studies assessing survival time or mortal-\nity risk, and they defined their population based on a\ngenetic marker rather than a clinical indicator (eg, trans-\nferring saturation). Other studies have been based on\npatients with a diagnosis of hemochromatosis.14,15 These\nadditional studies are based on patients with advanced\ndisease as evidenced by baseline rates of 68% for cirrho-\nsis. Because few patients with elevated serum transferrin\nsaturation levels ever have hemochromatosis diagnosed,\nestimating risk based on this advanced disease popula-\ntion might not indicate the true risk of iron overload or\nelevated transferrin saturation.16\nIt is unclear whether elevated serum transferrin\nsaturation has an unrecognized deleterious affect on\nsurvival.16,17 The purpose of this study, therefore, was\nto examine the mortality risk among a nationally rep-\nresentative cohort of persons who have elevated serum\ntransferrin saturation levels.\nMETHODS\nThe design of this study is a retrospective cohort\nstudy of persons aged 25 to 74 years at the time of the\nindex interview. The data sources used in this study are\nthe First Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I\nI Epidemiologic Followup Study (1992) (NHEFS).\nNHANES I was multistage, stratified probability\nsurvey designed to collect extensive demographic,\nmedical history, nutritional, clinical, and laboratory\ndata representative of the noninstitutionalized civilian\nUS population.\nThe NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study is\na national longitudinal study designed to investigate\nthe relationships between clinical, nutritional, and\nbehavioral factors assessed at baseline NHANES I and\nsubsequent morbidity, mortality, and institutionaliza-\ntion. The NHEFS initial population includes the 14,407\nparticipants who were 25 to 74 years of age when first\nexamined in NHANES I. More than 98% of those in\nthe initial NHANES I cohort were traced and supplied\ndata in the NHEFS.\nThe follow-up information was gathered in 1 of 3\nways. Subjects were interviewed who could be con-\ntacted and could participate. Surviving subjects were\nalways administered the subject questionnaire. If the\nsubject was alive but incapacitated, a slightly modified\nversion of the subject questionnaire was administered\nto a proxy respondent. A separate proxy questionnaire\nwas used only when the person had died. Finally, for\nthose who had died during the period between the\nNHANES I index interview and the follow-up inter-\nview, information from a death certificate was recorded.\nTransferrin Saturation\nIn the original NHANES I, serum transferrin saturation\nwas measured. We defined elevated serum transfer-\nrin saturation as greater than 45%, greater than 50%,\ngreater than 55%, and greater than 60%. All of these\ncutoff values had previously been proposed or used in\npopulation-based studies of elevated serum transferrin\nsaturation.18,19 The serum transferrin saturation percent-\nage was calculated by dividing the serum iron level by\ntotal iron-binding capacity.\nMortality\nMortality was measured as all-cause mortality. It has\nbeen contended that all-cause mortality is an endpoint\nmore unbiased than disease-specific mortality.20 The\nmortality variable was assessed using death certificates.\nThe cause of death was measured as the underlying\ncause of death.\nControl Variables\nWe attempted to examine the independent relation-\nship between elevated serum transferrin saturation and\nmortality while controlling for potential confounders.\nControl variables that were available in the NHANES I\nbaseline data set were age, sex, race, poverty status, and\neducation. Insurance was not available in this data set,\nbut poverty status, which is an index based on income\nand number of household members, was. Comorbidities\nwere controlled for at baseline by positive responses to\nquestions regarding whether a physician ever told the\npatient that he or she had any of 42 different condi-\ntions (eg, diabetes, high blood pressure, hepatitis). The\nCharlson Comorbidity Index was calculated from the\nresponses to these questions.21 We also included total\nserum cholesterol and smoking status at baseline as\ncontrol variables for mortality risk.\nData Analysis\nFor the analysis of the NHEFS we used sampling\nweights to calculate prevalence estimates for the civil-\nian noninstitutionalized US population aged 25 to 74\ndesign of the survey, we performed all analyses with\nSUDAAN.22 Our cohort for analysis was limited to\nthose with data in both the baseline and follow-up data\nsets and who had their serum transferrin saturation\nWe examined the relationship between elevated\nserum transferrin saturation and proportion of the\ncohort surviving throughout the follow-up period. We\ncomputed Kaplan-Meier curves for mortality and time\nin years since the baseline examination for elevated\nserum transferrin saturation at 55%, because this level\nhas been suggested as an action point for further inves-\ntigation of iron overload.23 Results provided unadjusted\nestimates of the all-cause mortality rate for those with\nand without elevated serum transferrin saturation.\nFinally, we performed Cox regressions with survival\ntime for serum transferrin saturation levels in 3 differ-\nent models. The first model defined the population into\nseveral categories of transferrin saturation at baseline\n60%) controlling for age, sex, race, poverty status, edu-\nmmol/L] or higher or less than 200 mg/dL), current\nsmoking status, and comorbidities. The second and\nthird models were computed examining the population\nas individuals having elevated or normal transferrin\nsaturation percentage, defining elevated transferrin sat-\nuration as greater than 55% in one model and greater\nthan 60% in another. These models were computed for\nall-cause mortality. In these models, survival time was a\ncontinuous variable measured in 1-year increments.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 displays the characteristics of the population.\nThe proportion of the population with elevated serum\ntransferrin saturation was 6.8% at more than 45%\ntion. As displayed in Table 1, those with transferrin\nsaturation levels of greater than 55% are more likely to\nbe male, white, and college educated, compared with\nthe overall population.\nFigure 1 shows the cumulative, unadjusted all-cause\nmortality with time for persons who had elevated trans-\nferrin saturations at 55%. After controlling for con-\nfounding variables in a Cox proportional hazards model\n(Table 2), all-cause mortality risk is significantly greater\nfor those with a transferrin saturation of 60% compared\nwith those who had a transferrin saturation of 45% or\nless. When the entire population is dichotomized into\nelevated or not elevated transferrin saturation levels at\n55%, however, persons with elevated transferrin satura-\ntion levels have a significantly increased mortality risk\n(hazards ratio [HR] 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI],\nfor those with a transferrin saturation of greater than\n60%, compared with those at less than this cutoff.\nNo one in the cohort who died had hemochromato-\nsis as any of the 20 listed causes of death. Table 3 shows\nthe top 10 causes of death for those with a transferrin\nsaturation of more than 55%. Compared with those who\nhad a transferrin saturation of 55% or less, both groups\nhave 5 of the 10 causes of death in common. Consistent\nwith the descriptions of iron overload, however, cirrhosis\nand diabetes were more common underlying causes of\ndeath among the elevated transferrin saturation cohort.\nDISCUSSION\nThe current study indicates that persons with a serum\ntransferrin saturation greater than 55% are at increased\nrisk of all-cause mortality. Elevated serum transferrin levels\nare associated with decreased survival, even after control-\nling for factors such as comorbid conditions (eg, hyper-\ntension, diabetes, cancer), smoking, and elevated choles-\nTable 1.

Historically, the morbidity and mortality of\niron overload diseases has been associated with cirrhosis\nand other liver diseases, diabetes mellitus, and cardiomy-\nopathy. These findings provide new information on the\nimpact of elevated serum transferrin saturation.\nApproximately 2% of the adult US population has\ntransferrin saturation levels greater than 55%. Accord-\nmillion US adults have an elevated transferrin saturation\naccording to this criteria.16 This risk factor for mortality\nis essentially unrecognized in a substantial proportion of\nadults. To provide some context, the prevalence of dia-\nbetes, both diagnosed and undiagnosed, is estimated at\napproximately 8% of the population.24\nAlthough the current study has found an association\nbetween elevated transferrin saturation and mortality,\nthe underlying pathophysiologic mechanism associ-\nated with the increased risk is unclear. Consistent with\nthe pathophysiologic mechanism of hereditary hemo-\nchromatosis and African iron overload, an elevation\nin serum transferrin saturation might represent an iron\noverload state with accumulation of iron in vital organs.\nThe findings of this study indicating a relatively\nunderinvestigated risk factor for mortality have simi-\nlarities to those of recent investigations focusing on\nC-reactive protein (CRP). C-reactive protein was first\nassociated with cardiovascular disease when it was\nnoticed that CRP was increased after an acute myo-\ncardial infarction.25 It was unclear what this marker\nrepresented as an acute-phase reactant, even though\nit had a consistent relationship with cardiovascular\nFigure 1.

Further, the results are\nbased on elevated serum transferrin saturation rather\nthan on a specific diagnosis, such as hemochromatosis.\nBecause hemochromatosis is so rarely diagnosed, popu-\nlation level estimates of morbidity or mortality using\npersons with hemochromatosis might represent impli-\ncations only for those with advanced disease manifest-\ning a classic presentation.\nSeveral limitations to these results should be noted.\nFirst, the estimate from the NHANES I was based on\nelevated serum transferrin saturation measurements, an\nappropriate first step in determining a predisposition\nto iron overload. Serum transferrin saturation can be\nconsidered a phenotypic marker of homozygosity for\nhemochromatosis but by itself does not indicate the\npresence or absence of iron overload. Thus, a single\nelevated transferrin saturation level might have resulted\nin overestimates of the prevalence of those who will\nprogress to iron overload in the study population.\nIn conclusion, elevated serum transferrin satura-\ntion has implications for increased mortality risk. The\nadditional mortality associated with elevated serum\ntransferrin saturation would appear to affect many\nmore persons than previously thought. A substantial\nproportion of the US adult population appears to\nshare this risk.\nTo read commentaries or to post a response to this article, see the\nonline version at http://www.annfammed/cgi/content/full/2/2/133.\nFinancial support: This study was funded in part through grant\nand from a contract from the Delaware Department of Health and Social\nServices.\nAcknowledgments: Special thanks to William Pearson, MHA, and Mark\nGeesey, MS, for their help with data analysis.\n",
