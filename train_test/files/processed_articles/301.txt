A sample of 100 adults with schizophrenia\nand 100 with major mood disorder were recruited from ran-\ndomly selected outpatients who were receiving community-\nbased psychiatric treatment. Participants were surveyed\nabout health indicators using items from the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Study III and the Na-\ntional Health Interview Survey. Their responses were com-\npared with those of matched samples from the general\npopulation surveys. A total of 1% of persons with serious\nmental illness, compared with 10% from the general pop-\nulation sample, met criteria for all 5 of selected health\nindicators: nonsmoker, exercise that meets recommended\nstandards, good dentition, absence of obesity, and absence\nof serious medical co-occurring illness. Within the mentally\nill group, educational level, but not a diagnosis of schizo-\nphrenia versus mood disorder, was independently associ-\nated with a composite measure of health behaviors.

However, poor health status\nand mortality risk are determined by the combination of\nseveral factors that operate synergistically.5 Therefore, it\nis important to examine multiple health indicators that\ntogether determine overall health. Applied at the popu-\nlation level, a multidimensional perspective facilitates the\ncomparison of overall health among populations and the\ntracking of changes in the overall health of a population\nover time.6\u00ad8 The analysis of multiple health indicators\nmay also help to better identify predictors of health\ncare costs.9 To our knowledge, a multidimensional per-\nspective has not been applied to the study of the health\nof persons with serious mental illness.\nThis study examines the health status of persons with\nserious mental illness in community-based psychiatric\ntreatment and compares their health status with that\nof matched individuals from the general population. In\naddition, within the psychiatric sample we examined\nthe correlates of composite measures of health status\nand the association between health indicators.\nMethods\nSample and Procedures\nParticipants were selected from outpatients aged 18\u00ad65\nwho were receiving psychiatric care at 2 centers in the\nBaltimore, Maryland, area: the Department of Psychia-\ntry at the University of Maryland at Baltimore and the\nSheppard Pratt Health System in Baltimore and Howard\nCounties. Participants were selected in order to obtain\na total of 100 individuals with schizophrenia, half with\nschizophrenia, excluding schizoaffective disorder, and\nhalf with schizoaffective disorder, and 100 individuals\nwith affective disorder, half with major depression\nand half with bipolar disorder.13 The sample was also\nselected so that half of participants were from the urban\nUniversity of Maryland center and half from the subur-\nban Sheppard Pratt center; within the latter sample,\npatients were drawn equally from 2 suburban sites.\nAt each site, lists of patients categorized by diagnosis\nwere obtained from the medical information system.\n1To whom correspondence should be addressed;\ne-mail: fdickerson@sheppardpratt.org.\n\u00d3 The Author 2006.

Within each diagnostic\ngroup, patients were selected in random order until\nthe predetermined number of consenting patients was\nobtained.\nA total of 281 individuals were identified as eligible; of\nthese 6 were not included for clinical reasons on the ad-\nvice of the treating clinician. Of the remaining 275 eligible\nindividuals, 200 (73%) consented to participate and com-\npleted the study. Individuals declined to participate for\nthe following reasons: not interested (n = 60); too busy\n(n = 9); other (n = 6). Consenters did not significantly dif-\nfer from decliners in terms of their age, gender, level of\neducation, or diagnosis. A higher percentage of consent-\ners were from the urban than the suburban center (81%\n200 individuals who provided written informed consent\nand were interviewed using an instrument that includes\nitems from the National Health Interview Survey\n(NHIS)10 and the National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nination Survey III (NHANES III).11\nWe focused on survey items that are consistent with the\nleading health indicators for the US population as iden-\ntified by the Healthy People 2010 program of the Centers\nfor Disease Control12: (1) self-report of not smoking a cig-\narette in the previous 30 days; (2) frequency of leisure\nphysical activity, which was used to calculate whether ex-\nercise met recommended standards (defined as $ 20 times\nper month)13; (3) self-report of height and weight from\nwhich the body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was calculated\nand categorized as obese if BMI $ 30; (4) absence of\nco-occurring lifetime serious medical illness from the\nfollowing chronic conditions: arthritis, asthma, chronic\nbronchitis, emphysema, diabetes, congestive heart fail-\nure, hypertension, stroke, cancer; (5) self-report of teeth\nin good, very good, or excellent condition; and (6) ab-\nsence of injury requiring medical treatment in the previ-\nous 90 days. Items 1\u00ad5 were from the NHANES III, and\nitem 6 from the NHIS.\nWe created several composite measures with the items\nthat were drawn from the NHANES III: whether the per-\nson met criteria for 2 important health behaviors (non-\nsmoker and exercise, items 1 and 2); and whether the\nperson met criteria for 3 important health outcomes\n(no obesity or co-occurring medical illness and good den-\ntition, items 3, 4, and 5). We selected these composites in\norder to separate indicators that reflected more lifestyle\nchoices (eg, behaviors) from those that are intermediate\nhealth outcomes. The third summary measure was\nwhether the person met the criteria for all 5 items used\nin the composites. We operationally defined an individual\nas in the unhealthy category when any one of the com-\nposite constituent health items was rated as unhealthy,\neven if 1 or more of the constituent items was missing.\nThe institutional review boards of the participating insti-\ntutions approved the study.\nThe mean age of the psychiatric sample was 44.0 (SD =\nwere Caucasian. Among the non-Caucasians, 71 of 88\nor Pacific Islanders; 5 of 88 (6%) were Native American;\nand 6 of 88 (7%) identified themselves as ``other.'' The\nmean years of education was 12.7 (SD = 3.0). By design,\nhalf of the sample had a chart diagnosis of schizophrenia\nand the other half a major mood disorder. The mood dis-\norder group was on average older than the schizophrenia\nTo compare responses of our sample with the general\nUS population, we randomly selected respondents from\nthe NHANES III and NHIS datasets who were matched\nto study participants by gender, age (within 3 years), and\nrace. Asian individuals and Pacific Islanders in our sam-\nple (6 of 200) were excluded from comparisons of\nNHANES III items because Asian/Pacific Islanders\ncould not be identified from NHANES III ethnicity\ndata. The Native Americans in the study sample (5 of\n200) were also not included in the analyses because there\nwere few match candidates. The matched datasets in-\nfor a few cases, there were 15 matches from the NHANES\nIII and the NHIS per study participant.

We also computed 95% con-\nfidence interval for the difference between the 2 groups.\nTo control error across multiple significance tests, we\ncontrolled the ``false discovery'' rate at 0.05 (5%) using\na recently developed method.16\nWithin the psychiatric sample, bivariate analyses were\nperformed between each of the composite health status\nmeasures in which more than 10% of the sample was cat-\negorized as healthy and demographic variables of age,\ngender, education (high school graduate or not), race\n(Caucasian vs. non-Caucasian), and diagnosis (schizo-\nphrenia vs. mood disorder). A t-test was used for the\n \nage variable to compare those who met the composite cri-\nteria with those who did not, and continuity adjusted chi-\nsquare analysis was used for the dichotomous variables.\nWe then performed logistic regression analyses on each\ncomposite health status measure, including age and gen-\nder and those variables that were significantly associated\nwith the dependent variable in bivariate analyses.\nTo quantify the association between health status items\nwithin the group with serious mental illness, we calcu-\nlated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals between\neach unique pair of dichotomous health status items\nand between the 2 composite indicators.\nResults\nCompared with the matched comparison group from the\ngeneral population, the sample of persons with serious\nmental illness had a significantly lower proportion of\nindividuals who were nonsmokers, had teeth that were\nin at least good condition, had a BMI that was in the non-\nobese range, were free of injury in the past 90 days, and\ndid not have a serious medical comorbidity, as shown\nin Table 1. The groups did not differ significantly in the\nproportion that exercised at recommended levels. The\nmentally ill and the general population group differed\nsignificantly on the 3 composite health measures.

Bivariate analyses\nwere not performed between the overall health com-\nposite measure and demographic variables because less\nthan 10% of the sample was categorized as healthy on\nthis measure.\nAs shown in Table 2, there was a significant association\nbetween nonsmoking status and good dentition; persons\nwho were nonsmokers were almost twice as likely, in rel-\native odds terms, to have good dentition as were smokers\nsence of obesity was also positively associated with the\nabsence of a co-occurring serious medical illness; persons\nwho were not obese were more than twice as likely, in\nrelative odds terms, not to have a co-occurring medical\nillness than those who were obese (odds ration = 2.27,\nalso associated with the absence of a co-occurring med-\nical illness; persons with teeth in at least good condition\nwere almost 2 1/2 times as likely, in relative odds terms,\nnot to have a co-occurring medical illness than those with\n4.50, p <.01).

Problems of smoking, obesity, and co-\noccurring medical problems have been previously docu-\nmented among persons with serious mental illness.1\u00ad4\nPhysical injuries have also been noted to be prevalent\namong persons with serious mental illness and a cause\nof excess mortality in this group.1,17,18 Our data do\nnot define the types of physical injury among persons\nin our sample or how they relate to mortality risk;\nthese remain important topics for further investigation.\nA very low percentage, 1%, of our psychiatric sample,\nmet the criteria for the composite measure of 5 health\nitems. Of note, while the comparison group from the gen-\neral population had a higher percentage that met this\ncomposite's criteria, only a small minority, 10 %, were\ncategorized as healthy. These results are consistent\nwith 2 recent studies that assessed a composite of 4\nhealthy lifestyle factors among persons in the general\nUS population: BMI < 25; nonsmoker; consumption\nof at least 5 fruits and vegetables daily; and moderate\nor vigorous physical exercise. A strikingly low percentage\nof persons in each study was adherent to all 4 indica-\ntors: 3% in one7 and 6.8% in the other8 study. The health\nitems in these studies were similar to those that we\nused, although our BMI cutoff of 30 was more liberal\nTable 2.

Also,\nwe included items about co-occurring medical illnesses\nand about dentition that the other studies did not. The\nrecent general population studies show a much lower\nrate of smoking than found in our sample of persons\nwith mental illness; however, adherence to recommended\nexercise is poor across all groups, and fewer than half of\nthe general population samples in these studies had\na body mass index that was in the healthy range.\nThus, it appears that the overall health of persons with\nserious mental illness falls below an already suboptimal\nlevel of overall health in the general population. The use\nof composite indicators highlights the extent to which de-\nviance from standards of health is a pervasive problem,\none that is amplified further among persons with serious\nmental illness.\nThe reasons that persons with serious mental illness\nhave poorer health status than persons in the general\npopulation are not known with certainty but likely in-\nclude several interrelated factors. Psychotropic medica-\ntions, such as some second-generation antipsychotic\nagents, have been associated with weight gain, incident\ndiabetes, and other side effects that may adversely affect\nhealth status.19 Psychiatric disorders themselves, apart\nfrom medication treatment, may predispose individuals\nto glucose intolerance20 and to cigarette smoking.21 In\naddition, persons with serious mental illness often have\nsymptoms of depression and emotional withdrawal,\nwhich may which contribute to their limited motivation\nfor positive health behaviors and attention to health\nproblems. Finally, the reduced socioeconomic status of\nmany persons with serious mental illness may reduce\ntheir access to medical care and resources such as those\nrelated to dental treatment and physical fitness.22,23\nWithin the psychiatric sample, we found that educa-\ntional level was associated with the composite item mea-\nsuring health behaviors; significantly more high school\ngraduates than those who did not graduate from high\nschool were classified as healthy on this measure. Our\nresults are consistent with studies of persons in the pop-\nulation at large in which a higher educational level has\nalso been associated with lifestyle choices of not smoking\nand of participating in exercise.7,24,25 Education was not\nassociated with the health outcomes composite, suggest-\ning some specificity to the impact of education on health\nmeasures in this population.\nLimitations of our study include the fact that our\nsample was from only 1 geographic region, while the\nNHANES III and NHIS comparison groups were nation-\nwide. However, estimates of the prevalence of persons\nwho meet basic health indicators do not differ markedly\nbetween individuals in Maryland and individuals nation-\nwide, based on data from the Behavioral Risk Factor\nSurveillance System.26 Another limitation of our study\nwas that it was based on self-report data. Also, we were\nunable to include all health behaviors that are important\nto overall health status, such as nutritional intake of\nfruits and vegetables. At the current time, there is not\nconsensus about the items that should be in included in\na composite health measure. The components of such\na composite indicator may be interrelated, although the\nextent of overlap is dependent on the specific factors\nthat are included. In studies of the general population,\nthe magnitude of the relationship among these factors\nis not large,7 but this issue has not been systematically\ninvestigated in previous studies of persons with serious\nmental illness.\nIn our own sample we found that only 3 of 12 pairwise\nassociations between health status items were significant\nand positive, indicating that individuals' health status on\ndifferent indicators is relatively independent. This finding\nargues for examining multiple health indicators in order\nto assess overall health status in persons with serious\nmental illness, as has been studied in the general popula-\ntion.7,8 An examination of multiple health indicators may\nalso lead to more accurate measures of overall health se-\nverity in persons with mental illness. This issue is an ur-\ngent one given the consistently higher rate of premature\ndeath found among persons with serious mental illness,\na phenomenon that is likely related to a combination of\nhealth risks.1 Measures that take into account multiple\nindicators might also be used to calculate risk adjustment\nfor modeling health care costs in this population,\na method that has been used in non\u00admentally ill samples.9\nFinally, a clinical approach that is focused on a combi-\nnation of health indicators is consistent with a more\ncomprehensive strategy to promote better health among\npersons with serious mental illness. Our results under-\nscore the need to improve health services and to develop\nand finance services that promote health behaviors for\npersons with serious mental illness.\n"
