As expected, people preferred curved over angular\nstimuli, and people's degree of curvature preference correlated across the two sets of shapes.\nMultilevel models showed varying patterns of interaction between shape and individual differences.\nFor the irregular polygons, people higher in artistic expertise or openness to experience showed a\ngreater preference for curvature. This pattern was not evident for the arrays of circles and\nhexagons. We discuss the results in relation to the nature of the stimuli, and we conclude that\nindividual differences do play a role in moderating the preference for smooth curvature.\n",

This overall preference\nfor curvature is now firmly established (Go\n\u00b4 mez-Puerto, Munar, & Nadal, 2015; for its\nhistorical context, see Bertamini & Palumbo, 2015) but not well understood. In the present\nresearch, we sought to illuminate this effect by examining individual differences in curvature\npreferences. Whether people differ in their preferences for curvature has been explored in only\na handful of studies (e.g., Silvia & Barona, 2009), and the findings so far are inconsistent.\nExamining the role of individual differences in these preferences will thus extend research to\ndate and inform the broader question of why people prefer curved over angular objects.\nThe Robustness of Curvature Preferences\nThe notion that curved lines and objects are more pleasing has a long history in writings on\naesthetics (e.g., Hogarth, 1753) and in empirical research. In early studies, curved lines were\nseen as quiet and lazy (Lundholm, 1921; Poffenberger & Barrows, 1924) or graceful and\nplayful (Hevner, 1935), while angular lines were seen as agitating (Lundholm, 1921;\nPoffenberger & Barrows, 1924), harsh (Poffenberger & Barrows, 1924), or dignified\n(Hevner, 1935). Similar patterns were found when fonts were adjusted to be more rounded\nDuring the past decade, researchers have revisited this issue of angularity and preference\nand have consistently found that people prefer curved things. This holds true for lines\n(Bertamini, Palumbo, Gheorges, & Galatsidas, 2016; Salgado-Montejo, Tapia Leon, Elliot,\net al., 2012), car interiors (Leder & Carbon, 2005), and interior architectural environments\ninfants (Jadva, Hines, & Golombok, 2010; Quinn, Brown, & Streppa, 1997) and great apes\n(Munar, Go\n\u00b4 mez-Puerto, Call, & Nadal, 2015) demonstrate this preference. The effect appears\nto stem from an appealing quality of curved things that motivates approach (Bertamini et al.,\n2016; Palumbo, Ruta, & Bertamini, 2015) instead of a threatening quality of angular, sharp\nDespite consistent evidence pointing to a preference for smooth curvature, however, the\nhistory of art suggests that preference for shapes is a complex phenomenon. Hogarth (1753),\nin his treatise on beauty, pronounced a wavy line as the line of beauty, but culture and artistic\ncanons seem to matter as well. For instance, abstract plasticism is a style associated with Piet\nMondrian (1872\u00ad1944) and characterized by simple straight lines and a complete absence of\ncurves. This can be contrasted with abstract expressionism, associated with Jackson Pollock\n(1912\u00ad1956). In Pollock's case, the paintings include splatters of paints that have an organic\naspect and therefore include smooth curves reminiscent of those present in the natural\nenvironment (Taylor, Micolich, & Jonas, 1999; Taylor, Spehar, Van Donkelaar, &\nWhat Moderates Curvature Preferences?\nAspects of Stimuli and Tasks\nOn the one hand, the preference for curvature is solid and consistent, but on the other\nhand, it is necessary to study its boundary conditions, moderators, and mechanisms.\n2 i-Perception\nSeveral within-person factors--aspects of the stimuli themselves--affect these preferences.\nFor example, when semantic knowledge of the objects is relevant--such as curvy bombs and\npointy teddy bears (Leder, Tinio, & Bar, 2011)--it can wash out the effects of low-level\nfeatures like angularity. Likewise, cultural trends in product design can shape the\nbackground against which objects are evaluated (Carbon, 2010).\nOne factor worth examining is the kind of emotional response measured in studies of\ncurvature. To date, the overwhelming focus has been on preference: The positively\nvalenced appeal of curvy things, measured with self-report items associated with pleasing,\nlikeable, and positive and with behavioral measures of choice and approach. Aesthetics\nresearch, for good reason, focuses heavily on positive feelings of liking and preference\n(Silvia, 2012). Nevertheless, pleasure and interest are distinct responses, and many pleasing\nthings are not interesting (Graf & Landwehr, 2015). Many studies, from Berlyne's (1971)\nearly work to the present (Markovic\n\u00b4 , 2012; Silvia & Kashdan, in press), show that liking and\ninterest respond differently to low-level features like complexity and familiarity. It is possible\nthat angular objects are less pleasing but more interesting, consistent with greater interest in\nobjects that are complex, variable, and heterogeneous (Silvia, 2006).\nAspects of People\nAt the between-person level--factors that differ between participants--little is known about\nvariables that affect curvature preferences. Thus far, expertise in the arts has received the most\nattention. Compared with novices, people with training in the visual arts see, think about, and\nappreciate art differently (Parsons, 1987; Smith & Smith, 2006). In particular, a common finding\nis that experts are less affected by low-level, superficial features of a work (e.g., whether it depicts\nobjects and colors people like) and more sensitive to compositional and historical features (e.g.,\nSilvia, 2013). Because they think about art in deeper, more complex ways, art experts might\nbe less affected by low-level visual features that appeal to novices. In two studies, Silvia and\nBarona (2009) found puzzling effects of expertise. In one study, novices showed stronger\ncurvature preferences; in another, experts showed stronger curvature preferences.\nIndividual differences beyond expertise have not been explored. An obvious candidate is\nopenness to experience, a trait that pops up throughout the psychology of aesthetics and\ncreativity (Oleynick et al., 2017). People high in openness to experience are more engaged\nwith the arts: They are more likely to find the arts interesting and valuable, have much\nmore knowledge about art, and have formal or informal training in the fine and performing\narts (McCrae, 1996; Silvia, 2007). More generally, people high in openness to experience are\nmore imaginative, creative, unconventional, and sensitive to subtle emotions (Kaufman, 2013;\nMcCrae & Sutin, 2009). Unlike art expertise, which develops over many years and is positively\nskewed, openness to experience is apparent early in life. Personality traits like openness to\nexperience do develop, of course, but they are considered universal features of people (Nettle,\n2009) rather than domains of acquired knowledge that some people choose to pursue.\nThe Present Research\nThe present research delves deeper into preference for smooth curvature by exploring\nmoderators, with an emphasis on individual differences. Our primary aim was to examine\nwhether some people have stronger curvature preferences and to characterize the traits\nassociated with such preferences. Variation in curvature preferences is an intriguing issue\nthat, ideally, can inform theorizing about the basic mechanisms behind the preferences.\nCotter et al. 3\nIn the present study, a sample of young adults viewed and rated a set of randomly\ngenerated irregular polygons that varied in complexity (Bertamini et al., 2016). In\naddition, they also viewed and rated a set of arrays containing circles and hexagons that\nvaried in degree of balance within a frame (Silvia & Barona, 2009). This second set was used\nto replicate past work and to see if curvature preferences were consistent across the sets. If\npreference for curvature is partly due to stable between-person factors, they should be\nconsistent: People's degree of curvature preferences should correlate across the tasks.\nFinally, we collected ratings of both liking and interest and measured viewing times to see\nif curved objects are more pleasing but less interesting and if curvature predicts how long\npeople viewed an image. We expected, based on past work, to find an overall increase in\nliking for curved objects.\nWe included a wide range of measures of individual differences. Our approach was guided\nby past research on important factors in aesthetic judgment and preference. We focused on\nthree classes of factors. First, we measured art expertise, a major moderator of aesthetic\npreferences and processes that had inconsistent effects on curvature preference in past work\n(Silvia & Barona, 2009). Second, we measured openness to experience, another major trait\ninvolved in people's engagement with the arts and aesthetic preferences. We measured\nopenness to experience with a cluster of scales that emphasize its different aspects\n(Oleynick et al., 2017). Finally, we measured a cluster of traits associated with systematic\nor deliberate versus heuristic or intuitive processing styles, such as need for cognition\n(Cacioppo, Petty, & Feng, 1984) and types of intuitive thinking (Pretz et al., 2014). This\nfamily of traits has not been widely studied in arts and aesthetics research, so these scales\nwere included for essentially exploratory reasons.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were 132 undergraduate students enrolled in psychology classes who volunteered\nas part of a class research participation option. Thirteen people were excluded from the\nanalyses due to exceeding the cutoff for inattentive responses (more than two) on an\ninfrequency scale (see Maniaci & Rogge, 2014; McKibben & Silvia, in press, 2016). This\nresulted in a final sample size of 119 people, which is the basis of the following analyses. The\nfinal sample of 119 was primarily female (61%) and diverse in self-reported race and ethnicity\n(people could select more than one category): European American (48%), African-American\n(41%), Asian-American (10%), Hispanic (5%), and Native American (5%). On average,\nparticipants were 18.92 years old (SD \u00bc 1.28). The university has popular programs related\nto the fine and performing arts, and 12% of the participants had majors or minors in some\narea of the arts (primarily fine art, art history, dance, theatre, and music; see Silvia &\nProcedure\nParticipants completed the study in small groups in a lab setting. Once participants provided\ninformed consent, the researcher explained the broad purpose of the study. Participants then\nbegan the experiment, which was administered on individual computers using MediaLab. All\nparticipants viewed and rated the irregular polygons at the start of the study, followed by the\narrays of circles and hexagons. All measures of individual differences were taken afterward.\nThe study took around 45 minutes to complete.\n4 i-Perception\nMaterials\nIrregular polygons. Our stimulus set was a subset of randomly generated polygons created by\nBertamini et al. (2016) and Palumbo and Bertamini (2016). By design they had some degree\nof complexity (so that they differed visibly one from the other) but they did not resemble any\nfamiliar object, nor were they composed of simple geometric parts (i.e., they could not be\ndescribed, for instance, as two circles or a square and a hexagon). Figure 1 shows examples,\nand the full set is available on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/vrjyp/). The stimuli\nwere created by selecting locations along a circle, and by varying the length of the radius\n(between a minimum and a maximum value). This process created polygons with 10, 18, or 26\nvertices. Next, polygons were altered to generate curved variants. To do so, a smooth curve\nwas created by using a cubic spline applied to the original polygon. Complexity was also\nvaried by using two values of the range of the radius used (i.e., the difference between the\nminimum and the maximum radius values). There were two levels of range, and they\nproduced a difference in the amplitude of the indentations. The combination of factors\n(number of vertices \u00bc 3, range \u00bc 2, curvature \u00bc 2) gives 12 types of shapes. We used two\nsets for a total of 24 images. The images appeared in a random order. The participants\ncould view each image for as long as they wished, but the images stayed on screen for at\nleast 2 seconds. People clicked the mouse or space bar to advance to the ratings, and the\nviewing time was recorded by the software.\nAfter each image, participants gave ratings of pleasantness (How PLEASANT is this\nimage? 1 \u00bc Not at all pleasant, 7 \u00bc Very pleasant), interest (How INTERESTING is this\nimage? 1 \u00bc Not at all interesting, 7 \u00bc Very interesting), and complexity (How COMPLEX\nis this image? 1 \u00bc Not at all complex, 7 \u00bc Very complex). The ratings appeared in the same\nfixed order for all items and participants.\nPreference for Balance Test. The Preference for Balance Test (Wilson & Chatterjee, 2005) was\nincluded to attempt to replicate past research (Silvia & Barona, 2009) and to evaluate if\ncurvature preferences were consistent across different kinds of images. The Preference for\nBalance Test consists of arrays of circles (curved) and hexagons (angular). Eighteen images\nwere presented: nine containing circles and nine containing hexagons. For each set of nine\nimages, there were three images for each of three levels of imbalance (low, medium, and\nhigh). Sample stimuli are shown in Figure 2; all 18 images are available at Open Science\nFramework (https://osf.io/vrjyp/). This set was used in our past research (Silvia & Barona,\n2009, Study 1). The images appeared in a random order. People clicked the mouse or space\nbar to advance to the ratings, and the viewing time was recorded by the software.\nAfter each image, participants gave ratings of pleasantness (How PLEASANT is this\nimage? 1 \u00bc Not at all pleasant, 7 \u00bc Very pleasant) and interest (How INTERESTING is\nthis image? 1 \u00bc Not at all interesting, 7 \u00bc Very interesting). The ratings appeared in the\nsame fixed order for all items and participants.\nMeasures of Individual Differences\nAesthetic fluency scale. This scale was used to assess artistic expertise (Smith & Smith, 2006).\nTen people or ideas from art history (e.g., impressionism and fauvism) were presented, and\nthe participants rated how familiar they were with each one on a scale from 0 (I have never\nheard of this artist or term) to 4 (I can talk intelligently about this artist or idea in art).\nCotter et al. 5\nThis scale has been used in many past studies as a brief measure of people's knowledge of the\nHEXACO 100 Personality Inventory\u00adRevised. This inventory consisted of 100 items measuring six\ndomains of personality: Honesty-Humility, Emotionality (Neuroticism), eXtraversion,\nAgreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience (Lee & Ashton, 2004).\nEach item was rated on a scale of 1 (Strongly Agree) to 5 (Strongly Disagree). We were\nprimarily interested in openness to experience and its facets--aesthetic appreciation,\ninquisitiveness, creativity, and unconventionality--so only these scales were included in the\nanalyses.\nNEO-Five-Factor Inventory. This 60-item scale measures five domains of personality:\nNeuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness\n(Costa & McCrae, 1992). Each item was rated on a scale from 1 (Strongly Agree) to\nFigure 1. Examples of angular (top panel) and curved (bottom panel) irregular polygons. The polygons vary\nin the number of sides (three levels) and in their range (two levels).\n6 i-Perception\n5 (Strongly Disagree). As our interest was in openness to experience, we examined only this\ndomain in our analyses.\nBig Five Aspects Scale. We used the Openness or Intellect subscale of the Big Five Aspects Scale\n(BFAS; DeYoung, Quilty, & Peterson, 2007). This 20-item subscale measures two aspects of\nopenness to experience: Openness and Intellect. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (Strongly\nDisagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).\nNeed for Cognition. This 18-item questionnaire was used to assess how much people engage in\nand enjoy thinking (Cacioppo et al., 1984). Each statement was rated on a scale from 1\n(Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Sample items include ``I only think as hard as\nI have to'' and ``I feel relief rather than satisfaction after completing a task that required a lot\nof mental effort.''\nTypes of Intuition Scale. This scale was used to examine the ways in which people make\ndecisions and solve problems (Pretz et al., 2014). Twenty-three statements (e.g., ``I would\nrather think in terms of theories than facts''; ``There is a logical justification for most of\nmy intuitive judgments'') were rated on a scale from 1 (Definitely False) to 5 (Definitely\nTrue). These statements are grouped into four subscales: Holistic Abstract (thinking\nabout a problem in abstract terms), Holistic Big Picture (focusing on the entire problem\nrather than details of the situation), Inferential (making decisions based on automatic,\nanalytic processes), and Affective (making decisions by relying on emotional reactions to a\nsituation).\nFigure 2. Examples of stimuli from the Preference for Balance Test. The circle (top) and hexagon (bottom)\nstimuli had three levels of imbalance: low (left), medium (middle), and high imbalance (right).\nCotter et al. 7\nResults\nMultilevel Analysis\nThe design had both within-person factors (e.g., curved vs. angular images) as well as\nbetween-person factors (e.g., art expertise and openness to experience; see Table 1). The\ndata were thus analyzed with multilevel models, which can flexibly model such designs.\nThe analyses were run with maximum likelihood and robust standard errors in Mplus 7.4.\nThe slopes and intercepts were random.\nIn this design, individual differences were factors that varied between people (Level 2), and\naspects of the images (their curvature, complexity, and imbalance) were factors that varied\nwithin people (Level 1). For the irregular polygons, curvature was coded as 0 (angular) and 1\n(curved), number of sides was coded as 0 (low), 1 (medium), and 2 (high), and range was\ncoded as 0 (low) or 1 (high). Similarly, for the preference for balance arrays, curvature was\ncoded as 0 (hexagons) and 1 (circles), and imbalance was coded as 0 (low), 1 (medium),\nand 2 (high imbalance). The Level 2 predictors (e.g., scales measuring art expertise and\npersonality traits) were standardized, which centers them at 0 (the sample mean) and\nplaces them on the same standard deviation scale. Unless noted otherwise, all the\nregression coefficients are unstandardized. The intraclass correlations (ICCs) showed that\naround 40% of the variance in ratings of pleasantness (ICCs \u00bc .40 for the polygons, .47\nfor the circle or hexagon arrays) and interest (ICCs \u00bc .39 for the polygons, .42 for the\ncircle or hexagon arrays) was at Level 2.\nDid People Prefer Curved Objects?\nBased on past work, we expected that participants would prefer the curved objects more than\nthe angular ones (see Figure 3). For the irregular polygons, participants reported liking the\ncurved polygons more than the angular ones (b \u00bc .27, SE \u00bc .10, p \u00bc .005). Additionally,\npeople liked polygons with more sides (b \u00bc .11, SE \u00bc .05, p \u00bc .036), which replicates the\nclassic effect of complexity on preference (e.g., Berlyne, 1971).1\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics for the Individual Differences Variables (n \u00bc 119).\nVariable M Mdn SD Min., Max.\nBFAS \u00bc Big Five Aspects Scale; TIntS \u00bc Types of Intuition Scale.\n8 i-Perception\nFor the imbalanced arrays of circles and hexagons, people again showed a preference for\ncurvature. Ratings of pleasantness were higher for the arrays of curved circles than the\nangular hexagons (b \u00bc .19, SE \u00bc .10, p \u00bc .070), although the effect was weaker than for the\nirregular polygons. Neither the level of imbalance nor the interaction between curvature and\nimbalance significantly predicted liking.\nWas Curvature Preference Consistent?\nThere was an overall preference for curvature for both irregular polygons and arrays of\nsimple circles and hexagons. To see if there were individual differences in the tendency to\nprefer curved forms, we estimated the correlation between curvature preference for the\nirregular polygons and for the imbalanced arrays of circles and hexagons. For each set, a\ndifference score was computed that reflected the difference in liking between the curved and\nthe angular images. The correlation between curvature preference for the irregular polygons\nFigure 3. Main effects of curvature on pleasantness and interest ratings for the irregular polygons (top) and\ncircles and hexagons (bottom). Error bars represent standard errors.\nCotter et al. 9\nand for the circle and hexagon arrays was significant (r \u00bc .32 [.15, .50], p < .001) and medium\nIt thus appears that there were consistent between-person differences in curvature\npreference: People who preferred curved objects in one stimulus set were likely to prefer\nthe curved objects in the other stimulus set.\nWhat Moderated Preference for Curvature?\nThe remaining question is to explore predictors of these between-person differences in\npreferences for curvature. We thus conducted multilevel models that examined between-\nperson factors, such as personality traits and art expertise, to see if some factors predicted\nstronger curvature preferences. For simplicity, the irregular polygons and circle-hexagon\narrays were analyzed separately, and only the main effect of curvature was included in the\nmodel (i.e., imbalance, complexity, and range were omitted). Note that because the between-\nperson predictors are standardized, the coefficients represent the predicted change in the\ndifference between curved and angular images for each 1 SD change in the predictor.\nIrregular polygons. The first column of Table 2 shows the moderating effects of the between-\nperson variables on curvature preferences. Some of the traits did significantly moderate\npreference. First, art expertise significantly enhanced the curvature effect: People who had\nhigher scores on the aesthetic fluency scale showed a stronger preference for the curved over\nthe angular polygons (b \u00bc .21, SE\u00bc .09, p \u00bc .021). Second, several of the scales measuring\nopenness to experience showed similar effects. Curvature preferences were significantly greater\nfor people scoring higher on the NEO openness to experience scale (b \u00bc .25, SE\u00bc .08, p \u00bc .002)\nand the HEXACO unconventionality facet (b \u00bc .41, SE\u00bc .10, p < .001); the increase was\nTable 2. Preference for Curvature Moderated by Individual Differences.\nIrregular polygons Circles and hexagons\nb SE p b SE p\nNote. BFAS \u00bc Big Five Aspects Scale; TIntS \u00bc Types of Intuition Scale. The b values are unstandardized regression weights.\nBecause each trait is standardized, the coefficients for the same outcome are comparable to each other: They are the\npredicted change in the difference between curved and angular images (in raw scale units) for each 1 SD unit change in the\npredictor. Positive values indicate that curvature preferences increase as the trait increases.\nmarginal for the overall HEXACO Openness to Experience scale (b \u00bc .16, SE\u00bc .09, p \u00bc .083)\nand the BFAS Openness scale (b \u00bc .15, SE \u00bc .08, p \u00bc .077). Finally, the Holistic Abstract\nsubscale of the Types of Intuition Scale significantly moderated curvature preference: People\nwho like thinking in abstract terms preferred the curved polygons more (b \u00bc .21, SE\u00bc .08,\np \u00bc .008). None of the other individual differences we investigated was significant (see Table\n2). Overall, then, a consistent profile appeared for the irregular polygons.\nCircles and hexagons. For the arrays of circles and hexagons, however, only one moderator was\nsignificant and another was marginal. As scores on the BFAS Intellect (b \u00bc \u00c0.15, SE \u00bc .08,\ntended to prefer the angular hexagons relatively more than the round circles. Otherwise, the\neffects for art expertise and openness to experience that appeared for the irregular polygons\ndid not appear for the arrays (see Table 2).\nDoes Curvature Affect Interest?\nOur secondary aim was to investigate whether interest was influenced by curvature (see\nFigure 3). Angularity did not influence interest in the irregular polygon stimulus set\n(b \u00bc \u00c0.07, SE \u00bc .10, p \u00bc .463). Both the number of sides and range, however, affected\ninterest. Shapes with more sides (b \u00bc .56, SE \u00bc .06, p < .001) and a higher range (b \u00bc .33,\nSE \u00bc .09, p < .001) were associated with increased interest ratings, consistent with a large\nbody of work on complexity and interest (Silvia, 2006). The two-way interaction and the\nthree-way interaction were not significant.\nSimilarly, in the circle and hexagons stimulus set, interest was not influenced by curvature\n(b \u00bc \u00c0.14, SE \u00bc .11, p \u00bc .21). The level of imbalance and the two-way interaction did not\nsignificantly affect interest ratings. In short, curved objects were pleasing, but angular objects\ndid not appear to be more interesting.\nDid Curvature Affect Viewing Time?\nFinally, we explored how curvature affected viewing time. As noted earlier, people could view\neach image as long as they wished with a minimum of 2 seconds. On average, people viewed\nSD \u00bc 1.90 for the circles and hexagons).\nFor the irregular polygons, there was a significant main effect of curvature (b \u00bc \u00c0.30,\nSE \u00bc .10, p \u00bc .002): People spent more time looking at the angular polygons than the\nrounded ones. There was also a main effect of the number of sides (b \u00bc .13, SE \u00bc .07,\np \u00bc .048): Viewing time increased as the number of sides increased, a finding that replicates\nmany studies from the Berlyne tradition of experimental aesthetics (e.g., Berlyne, 1974).\nFinally, there was a significant interaction between curvature and range (b \u00bc .30, SE \u00bc .14,\np \u00bc .034): People spent more time viewing curved objects with a larger range.\nFor the arrays of circles and hexagons, there was no main effect of curvature on viewing\ntime (b \u00bc \u00c0.06, SE \u00bc .12, p \u00bc .640). The only significant effect was a main effect of imbalance\n(b \u00bc \u00c0.14, SE \u00bc .05, p \u00bc .009): People spent more time viewing the more balanced arrays.\nDiscussion\nAmong the many low-level features that affect aesthetic preference, curvature stands out as\nhaving an unusually strong evidence base. Preference for curved over angular forms has been\ndemonstrated across decades, age-groups, cultures, and species (see Go\n\u00b4 mez-Puerto et al.,\n2015). When a main effect has been firmly established, a natural next step is to explore\nmoderators. Marking the boundaries of an effect can illuminate its nature. Such\nillumination would be particularly welcome in the case of curvature preferences, which are\nrobust yet mysterious--the effect is clearly there, but it is not obvious why adults, babies, and\ngreat apes would prefer the curved to the angular.\nThe present research examined individual differences in relation to curvature preferences.\nFirst, a preference for curved objects was found in both a set of irregular polygons and in\narrays of circles and hexagons, replicating much past research. Second, we found evidence for\nindividual differences in curvature preference itself. People's liking for curved over angular\nshapes was consistent across the two stimulus sets, with a medium effect size. The consistency\nof people's preferences across the types of shapes suggests the presence of individual\ndifferences that influence how much people prefer curved over angular forms.\nThe evidence for moderating traits, however, was a bit vexing. For one stimulus set--\nthe irregular polygons generated and studied by Bertamini et al. (2016)--the evidence for\nmoderation was plentiful and consistent. People with more knowledge about the arts,\nmeasured with the aesthetic fluency scale, showed greater curvature preferences, as did people\nhigher in openness to experience, measured with the NEO, HEXACO, and BFAS. Thus, the\nparticipants who were more interested and knowledgeable showed a stronger relative preference\nfor curved over angular polygons. Unlike other low-level factors that appear largely among\nnovices, such as preferences for realistic over abstract images (Parsons, 1987), curvature\npreference was heightened among people with greater knowledge and interest in art, at least\nfor this set of images. But for the other stimulus set--the arrays of circles and hexagons\ndeveloped to study pictorial imbalance (Wilson & Chatterjee, 2005)--only a handful of\neffects appeared, and none were the same as in the set of irregular polygons.\nPreference for curvature has been reported before for abstract stimuli (Bertamini et al.,\n2016) and for circles and hexagons (Silvia & Barona, 2009). Our study shows that beyond\nthis similarity, the nature of the stimuli can be moderated differently by individual\ndifferences. For the irregular polygons, artistic expertise and openness to experience were\nsignificant predictors of preference for curvature. This was not visible for circles and\nhexagons. The irregular polygons were novel, whereas circles and hexagons are familiar\nobjects. For instance, people possess linguistic labels for circles and hexagons, which come\nwith a set of established semantic associations, such as between a circle and a ball, or\nbetween a hexagon and a beehive. It is likely that these stimuli already possess valence. It\nhas been shown that valence can take precedence over curvature, and that in such cases,\npreferences for smooth curvature may be secondary (Leder et al., 2011). We conclude that\nthere is a strong case for studying preference for shape properties using shapes that are\nnovel and unfamiliar and that vary from trial to trial (i.e., they have a range of shapes,\nrather than just two).\nViewing time, along with pleasingness and interestingness, is one of the classic outcomes in\nexperimental aesthetics research. To date, research on curvature has used a wide range of\n(Vartanian et al., 2013), or has used free viewing without recording viewing times (e.g.,\nBertamini et al., 2016; Silvia & Barona, 2009, Study 2). In the present study, viewing time\nwas influenced by some classic predictors, such as complexity and imbalance. In addition,\nfor the irregular polygons, people spent more time viewing the angular shapes. The reason for\nthis effect is unclear, but it does rule out a simple exposure explanation for the preference\nfor curved objects. People overall preferred curved objects but did not spend more time\nviewing them, so preference is not merely due to exposure time.\nFuture work could vary presentation times to clarify why art expertise and openness to\nexperience moderate people's preference for curved objects. It is surprising that people with\nmore expertise show greater curvature preferences because experts are often less affected by\nlow-level aesthetic factors and more affected by formal training and domain knowledge (e.g.,\nHaertel & Carbon, 2014; Parsons, 1987). It is possible that the free-viewing format allowed\ntime for the effects of past experience and conceptual knowledge to materialize, so it would be\nworth varying presentation times and evaluating if traits like art expertise moderate\npreferences only at long viewing intervals. In addition, it would be worth greatly\nexpanding the number of stimuli. We used relatively few in the current study to expand\nthe time available for two tasks and many self-report questionnaires. Increasing the\nnumber of images could increase power for within-person effects.\nA secondary question was whether curvature had different effects on liking and interest. It\nseemed possible that angular forms would seem more intriguing and interesting, given the\nlarge literature on how features associated with complexity, tension, and variety affect\ninterest (Berlyne, 1971; Silvia, 2006). No evidence was found for effects on interest. The\ncurved polygons and circle arrays were more pleasing, but the angular polygons and\nhexagon arrays were not any more or less interesting.\nIn sum, the present study found evidence for individual differences in curvature\npreferences. Some people showed stronger preference for curvature, and this preference\nwas consistent for two very different types of shapes. The degree to which individual-\ndifference factors moderated these preferences varied as a function of the type of shapes,\nsuggesting that the familiarity of the shapes may be an important moderator of curvature\npreferences to examine in future research.\nAuthor Note\nAn early version of this study was presented at a symposium on ``The Human Aesthetic (and Moral)\nNature: The Preference for Curvature'' at the University of the Balearic Islands.
