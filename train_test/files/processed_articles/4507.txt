Since microglia also express various\nglutamate receptors themselves, we were interested in the\npotential feedback of glutamate on this system. Several\nagonists of mGluRs (metabotropic glutamate receptors)\nwere applied to primary rat microglia, and the export of\nglutamate into their culture medium was evoked by LPS\n(lipopolysaccharide). Agonists of group-II and -III mGluR\nACPD [(1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid]\nand L-AP4 [L-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid] were\nboth capable of completely blocking the glutamate export\nwithout interfering with the production of NO (nitric oxide);\nthe group-I agonist tADA (trans-azetidine-2,4-dicarboxylic\nacid) was ineffective. Consistent with the possibility of\nfeedback, inhibition of mGluR by MSPG [(R,S)-a-2-methyl-\n4sulfonophenylglycine] potentiated glutamate export. As the\ngroup-II and -III mGluR are coupled to Gai\n-containing\nG-proteins and the inhibition of adenylate cyclase, we ex-\nplored the role of cAMP in this effect. Inhibition of cAMP-\ndependent protein kinase [also known as protein kinase A\n(PKA)] by H89 mimicked the effect of ACPD, and the mGluR\nagonist had its actions reversed by artificially sustaining\ncAMP through the PDE (phosphodiesterase) inhibitor IBMX\n(isobutylmethylxanthine) or the cAMP mimetic dbcAMP\n(dibutyryl cAMP). These data indicate that mGluR activation\nattenuates a potentially neurotoxic export of glutamate\nfrom activated microglia and implicate cAMP as a\ncontributor to this aspect of microglial action.\n",

When exhibiting\ntheir full repertoire of responses, microglia produce ROS\n(reactive oxygen species), proteases, cytokines, prostanoids\nand NO (nitric oxide). However, there is another mechanism of\ncytotoxicity in the CNS (central nervous system) that may\nexplain its greater vulnerability to inflammation-related events:\nexcitotoxicity. Evidence suggests that production of EAAs\n(excitatory amino acids) may be one of the critical determinants\nof microglial malactivation. Microglia can produce several\ndefined agonists of EAA receptors, including glutamate,\nquinolinate and D-serine (Barger, 2004). While astrocytes could\nbe expected to clear most of the glutamate exported by\nmicroglia under normal conditions, this function is compro-\nIn addition, many microglia can be found intimately abutting\nneuronal somata and arbors (Wekerle, 2005), and gluta-\nmate receptors at such extrasynaptic positions preferentially\ncontribute to excitotoxicity (Sattler et al., 2000). A role for\nEAAs in neurodegeneration during inflammation is evinced by\nthe protective actions of glutamate receptor antagonists in\nmany models of neuroinflammation (Espey et al., 1998;\nexperimental models, natural disease correlations also imply a\nlink between neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity; AD, HIV\nencephalitis, multiple sclerosis, cerebral ischaemia, traumatic\nbrain injury and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) all have\ninflammation\u00adexcitotoxicity intersections.\n1 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email bargerstevenw@uams.edu).\nAbbreviations: ACPD, (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid; AD, Alzheimer's disease; AMPA, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propanoic acid; CNS,\ncentral nervous system; dbcAMP, dibutyryl cAMP; DNQX, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione; EAA, excitatory amino acid; FBS, foetal bovine serum; IBMX,\nisobutylmethylxanthine; L-AP4, L-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MEM, minimal essential medium; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate\nreceptor; MSPG, (R,S)-a-2-methyl-4sulfonophenylglycine; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide; NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric oxide\nsynthase; PDE, phosphodiesterase; PKC, protein kinase C; PLC, phospholipase C; ROS, reactive oxygen species; tADA, trans-azetidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid.\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\nWe previously demonstrated that the vast majority of\nglutamate exported from activated microglia could be attrib-\nuted to the Xc2 exchange mechanism (Barger and Basile, 2001;\nThe Xc2 exchange relies on a glutamate/cystine antiporter that\nresides in the plasmalemma of most cells. This mechanism\nbecomes extremely active in microglia because it is the primary\nroute of internalizing cystine for the production of GSH. As\nactivated microglia produce abundant ROS, they place them-\nselves under severe oxidative stress. Although much of the\nsuperoxide produced by NADPHox (NADPH oxidase) is released\nfrom the cell, intracellular generation occurs as well (Kobayashi\net al., 2001). Thus, the microglial oxidative burst creates a GSH\nshortage that is alleviated by cystine influx through the Xc2\nantiporter, extruding glutamate in the balance (Barger et al.,\nMicroglia have been reported to have several types of\nglutamate receptor, including those of mGluR (metabotro-\npic glutamate receptor) and AMPA (a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-\nmethylisoxazole-4-propanoic acid) classes (D'Antoni et al.,\n2008). Metabotropic groups I, II and III are represented on\nmicroglia through expression of individual subunits of these\nmGluR from group I or III seem to inhibit microglial activation;\ngroup II agonists generally appear to evoke malactivation,\nalthough an agonist of mGluR3 \u00ad a member of group-II \u00ad\ninhibited the toxicity exhibited by microglia towards oligo-\ndendrocytes (Pinteaux-Jones et al., 2008). The individual\nmGluR groups are coupled to various G-proteins, activating\nPLC (phospholipase C; group I) or inhibiting adenylate cyclase\n(groups II and III). At least two antagonists of group-I mGluR\nhave been reported to inhibit the activity of the Xc2 system\n(Bridges et al., 2012), but inactivity of other group-I\nantagonists (Melendez et al., 2005) suggests that the effect\non Xc2 is not mediated by group-I mGluR. We have initiated a\nsurvey of the potential for glutamate to exert, via glutamate\nreceptors, feedback on its own export from microglia.\nMaterials\nAMPA; DNQX (6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione); ACPD\n[L-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid]; tADA (trans-aze-\ntidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid); and MSPG [(R,S)-a-2-methyl-\n4sulfonophenylglycine] were from Tocris.\nPrimary microglia\nMixed glial cultures were established from neonatal (P0\u00adP1)\nSprague\u00adDawley rats (Harlan) as described previously (Barger\nand Basile, 2001). This use of animals was reviewed and\napproved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nCultures were maintained in MEM (minimal essential medium;\nInvitrogen), Earle's salts supplemented to 10% with FBS (foetal\nbovine serum; Atlanta Biologicals) and 10 mg/ml gentamycin\n(Sigma). After approx. 16 days, the cultures were subjected to\nvigorous lavage to remove the microglia from the confluent\nastrocyte monolayer. The cell suspension was subjected to\ncentrifugation at 110 g, and the pellet was resuspended in the\ncomplete culture medium described above and plated at a\n2H-tetrazolium bromide] assays) or 35-mm plates [qRT\u00adPCR\n(quantitative reverse transcriptase\u00adPCR)]. After 20 min, the\nmedium was exchanged to remove most of the contaminating\nastrocytes. Experimental treatments were initiated within 24 h\nof plating, after changing the medium to serum-free MEM.\nGlutamate assays\nAccumulation of glutamate in the culture medium was assayed\nby monitoring the reaction catalysed by glutamate dehydro-\ngenase, using iodonitrotetrazolium chloride as a colorimetric\nindicator, all supplied as a kit (R-Biopharm). Conversion of the\niodonitrotetrazolium chloride into formazan was assessed as\nabsorbance at 490 nm using a spectrophotometric plate reader\n(Bio-Rad). Standard curves were generated from spectropho-\ntometer readings of reactions with known concentrations of\nglutamate in MEM. All other readings obtained were inter-\npolated in the standard curve to achieve the corresponding\nglutamate concentration.\nNitrite assays\nThe accumulation of nitrite was used as an index of NO\nproduction and inflammatory activation in general.

The RT reaction utilized 500 ng of RNA and\nTaqMan reverse transcription reagents (including random\nhexamers for priming). PCR was performed with the Power\nSYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI\n7900HT Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The\nxCT signal was quantified relative to that for 18S rRNA. Equal\namounts of RT\u00adPCR from each sample were pooled for use in\nstandard curve reactions with each primer set. A melting curve\nwas generated for both xCT and 18S rRNA to ensure that a\nsingle peak of the predicted Tm\nwas produced and no primer\u00ad\ndimer complexes were present. The relative standard curve\nmethod was used to calculate the amplification difference\nbetween the samples for each primer set. This is performed by\ncorrecting for signal concentration with the concentration of\n18S signal for each sample (signal conc./18S conc.). The xCT\nprimers used were as follows; forward: 59-CCC AGA TAT GCA\nTCG TCC TT; reverse: 59-ACA ACC ATG AAG AGG CAG GT. Primer\nsequences for 18S were forward: 59-TTC GAA CGT CTG CCC TAT\nStatistics\nAll data are representative of at least three replicated ex-\nperiments. Concentration\u00adresponse curves were analysed by\nANOVA and Scheffe post-hoc test. Pairwise comparisons were\nmade by Student's t-test. Values of P less than or equal to 0.05\nwere taken to be significant.\nRESULTS\nAs previously reported, LPS (lipopolysaccharide) treatment of\nmicroglia caused an increased accumulation of glutamate in\nthe culture medium. We were interested in exploring the\npotential consequences of feedback stimulation of glutamate\nreceptors on microglia. While AMPA receptors desensitize\nrapidly and thus produce only small currents in the absence\nof cyclothiazide (Noda et al., 2000), we have observed large\nincreases in intracellular calcium concentrations via AMPA\nreceptors in a subset of microglia (data not shown). Eun et al.\n(2004) observed gene expression changes in microglia\nresulting from AMPA treatments at 500 mM. However, co-\napplication of 30\u00ad300 mM AMPA had no appreciable effect\non the export of glutamate triggered by LPS (Figure 1A).\nIndeed, there appeared to be a trend towards inhibition when\nAMPA receptors were antagonized by DNQX; this may have\nresulted from toxicity of the latter, however, as indicated by\nMTT assays of cellular metabolism (Figure 1B). ACPD, an\nagonist of group-I and-II mGluR, inhibited the LPS-triggered\nglutamate export substantially and dosimetrically (Figure 1A)\nwithout toxicity. To assess whether this effect was specific to\nglutamate or indicated a generalized anti-inflammatory\neffect, we assayed nitrite accumulation as a surrogate marker\nof NO production. ACPD had no apparent effect on microglial\nFigure 1 Specific inhibition of the export of glutamate from microglia by\nan mGluR agonist\nRat primary microglia were treated with the indicated concentrations of\nAMPA (N), DNQX (&) or ACPD (m).

The values obtained in\nuntreated cultures are shown by the white bars (`con'), and the values\nobtained in cultures treated with LPS alone are shown by the black bars (`LPS\nalone').

These findings indicate that glutamate exported from\nactivated microglia may exert negative feedback on this\nevent through the activation of mGluR.\nThe mGluR receptors stimulated by ACPD are groups I and\nII. Group-I receptors are coupled to activation of PLC and a\nresultant activation of PKC (protein kinase C) and release of\nintracellular calcium stores. If activation of PKC mediated the\neffect of ACPD, it might be expected that glutamate export\nwould be similarly inhibited by direct activation of PKC or\nthat the effects of ACPD would be sensitive to inhibitors of\nPKC. However, the PKC activator phorbol myristic acid was\nnot able to mimic the effect of ACPD, and the PKC inhibitor\nbisindolylmaleimide I did not suppress the effect of ACPD\n(data not shown). Moreover, ACPD had no acute influence on\nintracellular calcium concentrations (data not shown). These\nfindings are not consistent with activation of PLC. Therefore,\nwe tested whether the effect of ACPD was mediated by\ngroup-II receptors, which are coupled with inhibition of\nadenylate cyclase via G-proteins containing the ai\nsubunit.\nUtilization of this signal-transduction pathway should thus\nrequire reduction in the levels of cAMP. This possibility was\ntested by examining the ability of ACPD to inhibit LPS-evoked\nglutamate export in the presence of IBMX (isobutylmethyl-\nxanthine), an inhibitor of the PDEs (phosphodiesterases)\nresponsible for degrading cAMP. The raw glutamate-export\ndata from these experiments produced an unusual concen-\ntration\u00adresponse curve over concentrations of IBMX\n(Figure 2A). MTT assays suggested substantial toxicity at the\ntwo highest concentrations of this agent. To examine the glu-\ntamate being exported from live, healthy cells, we reanalysed\nthe glutamate value of each culture well relative to the\ncellular metabolism (MTT value) for that well. This analysis\nremoved the effect of presumed IBMX toxicity, revealing a\nconcentration-dependent reversal of the ACPD effect by\nIBMX (Figure 2B). The dependency of ACPD's inhibition on\ncAMP modulation was further tested by the application of\ndbcAMP (dibutyryl cAMP). This agent had an effect similar to\nthat of IBMX without evidence of toxicity (Figure 2C). Most\neffects of cAMP are mediated through PKA; therefore we\ntested the effects of PKA inhibitor H89 on glutamate release.\nH89 concentration-dependently mimicked the effect of\nACPD, reducing the glutamate export triggered by LPS\n(Figure 3). Neither IBMX, dbcAMP nor H89 had any effect\non glutamate export on its own; dbcAMP and H89 had no\neffect on MTT assessments of viability (data not shown).\nThese results suggest that the depression of glutamate export\nby ACPD requires a reduction in the levels of cAMP, most\nprobably afforded by activation of Gai\nby group-II mGluR.\nACPD is an agonist of group-I and -II mGluR. To further\nexamine the role of Gai\n-coupled receptors in the attenuation of\nglutamate release, we tested agonists more specific to mGluR\nof groups I and III. Application of L-AP4, a type-III agonist,\nreproduced the effects of ACPD precisely (Figure 4A). However,\nthe type-I agonist tADA had no effect (Figure 4B).\nFigure 2 Inhibitory effect of ACPD reversed by agents sustaining cAMP\nRat primary microglia were treated with 100 mM ACPD and the indicated\nconcentrations of IBMX (A, B) or dbcAMP (C). LPS was then applied at 30 ng/\nml. After 20 h, the culture medium was assayed for glutamate, and the cells\nwere assayed for MTT reduction. Raw values for glutamate are reported in (A)\nand (C). In (B), the glutamate values are shown after factoring by a de-\nnominator based on the MTT value and hence report a value related to the\namount of glutamate exported per live cell. The values obtained in untreated\ncultures are shown by the white bars (`con'), and the values obtained\nin cultures treated with LPS alone are shown by the black bars (`LPS alone').\nValues represent the means\u00a1S.E.M. of quadruplicate determinations. Above\n10 mM, both IBMX and dbcAMP produced differences that were statistically\nsignificant.\nSM McMullan and others\n326 E 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nThe ability of group-II and -III agonists to inhibit glutamate\nexport demonstrates sufficiency in impacting this phenom-\nenon. If glutamate accumulating extracellularly actually has the\npotential to moderate its own export via activation of these\nreceptors, antagonists would be expected relieve this squelch-\ning effect and cause an even larger accumulation of glutamate\nextracellularly. To assess the impact of mGluR activation by\nambient glutamate, we measured glutamate accumulation in\nthe presence of MSPG, a group-II and -III antagonist (Jane et al.,\nof ACPD, confirming that the latter exerted its effect via mGluR\n(Figure 5A). When MSPG was applied in the face of glutamate\nexport elicited by a modest amount of LPS (2 ng/ml), there was\na trend towards amplification of glutamate levels in the con-\nditioned medium corresponding to MSPG concentration,\nculminating in a significant elevation at 300 mM MSPG\n(Figure 5B). While a trend towards greater glutamate release\nwas observed in response to MSPG alone, the trend remained\nbelow the level of significance.\nTogether, the above data indicate reductions in cellular\ncAMP inhibit glutamate export from microglia activated by a\npro-inflammatory stimulus. Such release was previously found\nto depend on the Xc2 exchange system, which reciprocally\ntransports cystine and glutamate (Barger et al., 2007).\nExpression of the unique subunit of this transporter, xCT, is\ndependent on a cAMP response element in the promoter of its\ngene. As an initial step, we analysed mRNA levels of xCT in\nresponse to manipulation of the cAMP system. Consistent with\nprevious findings, dbcAMP and IBMX elevated the expression\nof xCT (Figure 6A). ACPD was able to suppress the effect of\nIBMX, an effect that may owe to the low concentration\nof IBMX applied, necessary to avoid cytotoxicity. Next, we\ntested LPS and ACPD to determine if the effects of the latter\nmight involve suppression of xCT transcription via reduction\nin cAMP levels. LPS stimulated a considerable increase in ex-\npression, as demonstrated previously (Barger et al., 2007), but\nACPD was unable to suppress this response (Figure 6B).\nDISCUSSION\nWhen activated by pro-inflammatory stimuli, microglia\nexport substantial levels of glutamate.

A greater\nunderstanding of the mechanisms controlling the glutamate\nexport may lead to therapeutic alleviation of the neurode-\ngenerative effects of neuroinflammation in various condi-\ntions such as in multiple sclerosis, brain abscess, ischaemia,\ntraumatic brain injury and AD. Here, we have documented the\npotential for a feedback mechanism by which glutamate\nexported from microglia acts through group-II and -III\nmGluR. In the presence of ACPD (a group-I and -II agonist) or\nL-AP3 (a group-III agonist), the amount of glutamate\nexported in response to LPS was suppressed, while accu-\nmulation of nitrite was unaffected; also unaffected was the\ninduction of xCT expression in response to LPS. Antagonism\nof group-II and -III receptors by MSPG created conditions\npermissive for a super-induction of glutamate export in\nresponse to LPS. These data imply that glutamate, including\nthat exported by activated microglia themselves, can act on\nmGluR to suppress some facet of the glutamate export\nmechanism without having an impact on the fundamental\npro-inflammatory activation of microglia. This phenomenon\nmay influence the ultimate levels of glutamate that are\nexported from microglia.\nAdditional data suggest that the influence of mGluR\nactivations in this system occurs through modulation of the\nlevels of the intracellular second messenger cAMP. ACPD and\nL-AP4 both act on mGluR that activate Gai\nto inhibit\nadenylate cyclase. The effect of ACPD was reversed by IBMX\nand dbcAMP. IBMX inhibits PDEs and consequently stabilizes\nthe levels of cAMP, even after inhibition of adenylate cyclase\nby Gai\n; dbcAMP functionally replaces cAMP lost through such\ninhibition. Finally, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein\nkinase acted like ACPD and L-AP4 to suppress the glutamate\nrelease. We interpret our results as evidence that group-II and\ngroup-III mGluR inhibit glutamate export through a sup-\npression of cAMP levels. Although ACPD can also activate\ngroup-I mGluR, these receptors do not appear to be involved\nFigure 5 Blockade of mGluR accentuates glutamate export\nRat primary microglia were exposed to MSPG at the concentrations indicated\n(mM) and culture medium was assayed for glutamate after 20 h.

The lack of involvement\nof group-I mGluR contrasts somewhat with other evidence\nthat activation of these receptors attenuates the neurotoxi-\ncity exhibited by activated microglia (Byrnes et al., 2009b). On\nthe other hand, group-III mGluR have been reported to exert\na similar influence on microglial neurotoxicity (Taylor et al.,\nAt this point, it is not clear what dictates the role of cAMP in\nmicroglial activation. Clearly, this second messenger contri-\nbutes differentially in different paradigms. Elevations of cAMP\nhave been associated with both stimulatory (Sowa and\nand inhibitory (Peters-Golden, 2009) effects on macrophage\nactivation (Okado-Matsumoto et al., 2000). In microglia, there\nis ambivalent data as well. Bradykinin inhibits microglial\nrelease of TNF (tumour necrosis factor) and IL-1 b (interleukin-\n1b) in a cAMP-dependent manner, and this effect is mimicked\nby dbcAMP (Noda et al., 2007). More general inhibitions of\nmicroglial activation by cAMP-dependent mechanisms are well\nthat elevate or mimic cAMP have been shown to potentiate NO\nrelease stimulated by Ab (amyloid b-peptide) in microglia (Pyo\net al., 1999), and PKA or AC inhibitors reduced nitrite pro-\nduction in microglia stimulated with adrenaline (Dello Russo\nIt bears reiterating that the cAMP-dependent inhibition of\nglutamate export documented here was not accompanied by\ninhibition of LPS's ability to elevate xCT mRNA. As predicted\nby the findings of Gochenauer and Robinson (2001), agents\nthat elevate or mimic cAMP here boosted expression of xCT.\nACPD suppressed the effect of a modest concentration of\nIBMX in this regard (its effects against dbcAMP were not\ntested, as dbcAMP essentially bypasses adenylate cyclase, the\npoint of impact of mGluR agonism). However, ACPD did not\nsuppress the gene induction stimulated by LPS. This may\nindicate that LPS and cAMP enhance transcription of xCT via\ndistinct mechanisms, but it must also be considered that the\nstrength of stimulus was simply too large to overcome in\nthe case of LPS. Nevertheless, the data add to a growing body\nof evidence that Xc2 transport activity is not strictly co-\nrrelated with xCT expression. For instance, we previously\nshowed that inhibitors of macromolecular synthesis had little\neffect on the export of glutamate evoked by LPS (Barger\net al., 2007). Of course, xCT gene transcription is not\ntantamount to protein synthesis and trafficking to its site\nof action in the plasmalemma. There may exist additional\nmechanisms of regulation by post-translational modification\nof the transporter subunits, but we have also argued for\nconsideration of simple mass-action stimulation, predicated\non the depletion of GSH in activated microglia (Barger et al.,\nThe mGluR- and cAMP-dependent modulations of glutamate\nexport also failed to correlate with another response to pro-\ninflammatory activation: NO generation. NO has diverse effects\nin the CNS, but some evidence suggests that its production by\nNOS (nitric oxide synthase) \u00ad 2 largely in non-neuronal cells \u00ad\nhas a neuroprotective effect, perhaps in contrast with the NO\ngenerated within neurons by NOS-1 (Barger and Basile, 2001;\nColton et al., 2006 and references therein). Together, these\nfindings suggest that a reduction in cAMP levels might have a\nmodulatory effect on pro-inflammatory activation that is\nuniquely beneficial for the CNS, predicated on the unique\nimpacts of glutamate (i.e., neurotransmission and excitotoxi-\ncity) in this compartment. Perhaps, cAMP signalling represents\nan inroad that could be exploited to shift the microglial\nresponse to one that retains beneficial aspects of activation\nwhile attenuating the threat of glutamatergic toxicity.\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that activation of Gai\n-\ncoupled receptors, including group-II and group-III mGluRs,\nsuppresses the export of potentially neurotoxic glutamate\nfrom activated microglia. As the effect may be limited to the\nglutamate release, the findings behove an exploration of\nstrategies aimed at this modality in order to shift microglial\nresponses to those that retain beneficial aspects (e.g.,\nphagocytosis, production of neurotrophins) while attenuating\nthe maladaptive bent towards excitotoxicity. Development of\npharmacological strategies in this tack may benefit from\nmechanistic determination of the cAMP-dependent events in\nthis effect.\n"
