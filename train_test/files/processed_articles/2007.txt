Platz1,2,3\n Introduction\nThe vision of the recently released National Prevention\nStrategy is to move \". . .the nation from a focus on sickness\nand disease to one based on prevention and wellness (1).\"\nColorectal cancer, which cost an estimated 14 billion dol-\ntotal cost of cancer care (2), is a focus of health care reform.\nThe prevailing strategy to address colorectal cancer has been\nthrough secondary prevention. Screening average risk\nadults 50 years and older has accounted for a large propor-\ntion of an overall decline in colorectal cancer incidence and\nmortality over the past 3 decades (3). The Patient Protection\nand Affordable Care Act of 2010 will increase access to\ncolorectal cancer screening (4), and screening rates will be a\nkey indicator of the prevention strategy (1). Although the\nbenefit of screening is clear, there is also extensive evidence\nto support increased efforts for primary prevention through\nlifestyle modification.\nIn the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of\nCancer, it was estimated that increased screening in com-\nbination with a significant, but achievable, improvement in\nlifestyle risk factor prevalence from the rates in 2000 could\nreduce colorectal cancer mortality by as much as 50% in\n2020 (3). In addition, estimates from a large cohort of\nwomen found that while endoscopic screening can signif-\nicantly reduce risk of colorectal cancer, the magnitude of the\nrisk reduction is less than the reduction for lifestyle and\ndietary changes alone (5). In a cohort of men, it was\nestimated that as much as 71% of colon cancer risk could\nbe avoided through modification of a constellation of\nlifestyle factors (6). Collectively, this evidence suggests that\nthe most successful national strategy for colorectal cancer\nprevention will include complementary approaches of both\nscreening and lifestyle modification.\nFurthermore, in stark contrast to overall incidence, colo-\nrectal cancer incidence among adults under 50 years, and\nbelow the recommended screening age, has increased since\nAuthors' Affiliations: 1Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins\nBloomberg School of Public Health; 2James Buchanan Brady Urological\nInstitute; 3Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins\nMedical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland; 4Department of Biostatistics and\nComputational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; 5Department of\nBiostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts;\nand 6Department of Surgery and Alvin J.

This may be due, in part, to increases\nin the prevalence of lifestyle risk factors (7). The current\nscreening practice for average risk adults will not address\ncolorectal cancer in this age range; and there is not an\nevidence-base to support population-wide screening in\nthose younger than 50 (8). It is undetermined whether the\nhealth care system currently has the capacity to provide\nquality screening even to those 50 and over (9). Thus,\nprimary prevention of colorectal cancer through lifestyle\nmodification may be the most effective strategy among\nyounger adults.\nTo identify national opportunities for the primary pre-\nvention of colorectal cancer, and prioritize targets for pre-\nvention by sex, race/ethnicity, and age, we assessed the\nprevalence of modifiable lifestyle risk factors in the United\nStates. We evaluated the prevalence of the 5 \"convincing\"\nrisk factors as determined by the World Cancer Research\nFund (i.e., obesity, physical inactivity, and intake of red\nmeat, processed meat and alcohol; ref. 10), as well as\ncigarette smoking, which was classified a suggestive risk\nfactor in the Surgeon General's report (11), and has been\nconsistently associated with colorectal cancer risk in pro-\nspective studies (12).\nMethods\nStudy population\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES), conducted by the National Center for Health\nStatistics, is a nationally representative survey that uses a\nmultistage stratified, clustered probability sample of the\nU.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. Data is col-\nlected through household interviews and in-person exam-\nination at mobile examination centers. We estimated the\nnational prevalence of colorectal cancer risk factors in\nnon-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB),\nand Mexican-American (MA) men and nonpregnant\nRisk factors\nWe evaluated 6 colorectal cancer risk factors; obesity,\nphysical inactivity, and intake of red meat, processed\nmeat and alcohol, and cigarette smoking. During the\nhousehold interview, participants were asked about phys-\nical activity, cigarette smoking, and alcohol use. During\nthe examination, height and weight were measured, and a\n24-hour food recall was administered. All factors of\ninterest, except physical activity, were identically mea-\nsured in each cycle.\nWe calculated body mass index [BMI, (weight, kg)/\n(height, m2)] from height and weight measured at the\nexamination. When height and weight were missing\n(1.1% in all cycles), we used self-reported values from\nthe interview. Participants with a BMI  30.0 kg/m2 were\nclassified as obese.\nRed meat and processed meat intakes were assessed using\na 24-hour recall. One day of 24-hour diet recall was col-\ncollected. To be consistent, we used the first day 24-hour\nrecall in this study. Daily intake of items containing red\nsumed 2 oz or more were classified as regular red meat\nconsumers. Daily intake of items containing processed meat\n(e.g., frankfurters, sausages, lunchmeats, or meat spreads;\nwho consumed 2 oz or more were classified as regular\nprocessed meat consumers.\nParticipants were asked about their cigarette smoking\nstatus and usual alcohol intake. We classified smoking in\n2 ways: ever and current. Because smoking is thought to\ninfluence colorectal cancer risk after decades, rather than\nimmediately (12, 14), we classified participants who\nsmoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime as \"ever\"\nsmokers. However, because only current smoking behavior\ncan be modified, we also classified participants who smoked\ncigarettes on \"most\" or \"some\" days as \"current\" smokers.\nWe classified participants who consumed 2 or more alco-\nholic beverages on most days as regular alcohol consumers.\nParticipants were asked about their physical activity\nformly measured. Participants were asked to indicate (i)\nwhether they walked/bicycled for transportation, (ii)\nwhether they took part in household/yard tasks requiring\nat least moderate effort, (iii) all of their recreational activ-\nities, and (iv) the number of minutes and days they spent\ndoing all (transportation, household, and recreational)\nactivities. Participants were asked to describe their \"usual\ndaily activities\" as one of the following: \"sit during day and\ndo not walk very much,\" \"stand or walk about quite a lot\nduring day but do not have to carry or lift things very often,\"\n\"lift or carry light loads, or have to climb stairs or hills often\"\ncycle, the physical activity questionnaire was changed. As in\nthe previous cycles, participants were asked whether they\nwalked/bicycled for transportation, and the number of\nminutes and days they spent walking/bicycling. Participants\nalso reported whether they took part in moderate or vigor-\nous \"work\" activities (household and occupational activi-\nties), and the number of minutes and days they spent doing\n\"work\" activities. Rather than reporting all recreational\nactivities, participants reported whether they took part in\nmoderate or vigorous recreational activities, and the num-\nber of minutes and days they spent doing recreational\nactivities. For all NHANES cycles, we summed the total\nminutes of moderate and vigorous activities per week. Then,\n(15), we classified participants who completed 150 or more\nminutes of moderate or 75 or more minutes of vigorous\nactivity each week as physically active. Because occupational\nparticipants that selected \"do heavy work or carry heavy\nPrimary Prevention of Colorectal Cancer in the United States\nResearch.\ncancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\nloads\" to describe their usual day were also classified as\nphysically active.\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were done using SUDAAN 9.0\n(Research Triangle Park) and SAS v.9.1. Sampling weights\nof the smallest subsample (i.e., 24-hour food recall) were\napplied to account for the NHANES sampling design,\nincluding oversampling, nonresponse, and poststratifica-\ntion. The analyses included participants with complete\nFor each NHANES cycle, we estimated the prevalence of\neach risk factor(obesity, physical inactivity, ever and current\nsmoking, and red meat, processed meat, and alcohol\nintake) separately. The total number of risk factors was\ncalculated by summing the 6 risk factors; current smoking,\nrather than ever, was used in the total. We compared\ndifferences in the prevalence of the risk factors and the total\nnumber of risk factors by sex, race/ethnicity and age using\nthe x2 test. Because these factors often cooccur, we also\nestimated the joint distribution of the 6 modifiable risk\ncombinations (\"risk profiles\"), we report the 10 most\ncommon ones in the overall study population and in\nsubpopulations defined by sex, race/ethnicity, and age.\nWithin each population, at least 60% of the participants\nhad one of the 10 risk profiles. Given our objective to\nprioritize today's colorectal cancer prevention efforts, we\ncycle and describe changes in prevalence of the risk factors\nover time.\nResults\nThe study population was the estimated U.S. adult pop-\nblacks, and 9.8% Mexican Americans. When divided into\nPrevalence of colorectal cancer risk factors\nfactor overall (Table 1). Men were more likely to be both\never and current smokers than women. Non-Hispanic\nwhites were most likely to be ever smokers. Non-Hispanic\nblacks were most likely to be current smokers (P \u00bc 0.08).\nAlthough ever smoking was most prevalent among the\noldest age group (50\u00ad69 years), current smoking was most\nprevalent among the youngest age group (20\u00ad34 years).\nWhen considering current smoking rather than ever,\nobesity was the most common risk factor overall, followed\nclosely by physical inactivity. Women had higher preva-\nlences of obesity and physically inactivity than men; and\nnon-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans had higher\nprevalences of obesity and physical inactivity than non-\nHispanic whites. The prevalences of obesity and physical\ninactivity increased with age.\nAmong the dietary risk factors, intake of red meat was the\nmost common risk factor, followed by processed meat, and\nthen alcohol. Men were more likely to regularly consume all\n3 dietary risk factors than women. Across race/ethnicity\ngroups, red meat intake was similar, processed meat intake\nwas highest among non-Hispanic blacks, and alcohol\nintake was highest among non-Hispanic whites. Across age\ngroups, those 20 to 34 years were most likely to consume red\nmeat, but processed meat and alcohol intake did not differ\nby age.\nrelatively constant over time in the overall study population\nand by sex, race/ethnicity, and age (Fig. 1).

Men had more risk factors than women; approx-\nimately 20% of men had 3 or more risk factors as compared\nwith approximately 15% of women (P \u00bc 0.07). The distri-\nbution of number of risk factors differed significantly by\nrace/ethnicity and age groups: non-Hispanic blacks had the\nhighest prevalence of 3 or more risk factors (23%), fol-\nlowed by non-Hispanic whites(16%), and Mexican Amer-\nicans (13%).

The\nprevalence of 3 or more risk factors was consistent across\ncycles. However, in earlier cycles, the prevalence of having\nno risk factors was lower, and the prevalence of one risk\nfactor was higher, than in later cycles, particularly in men,\nnon-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans. This differ-\nence was likely due to the corresponding change in the\nprevalence of physical inactivity, which was most pro-\nnounced in these same subgroups.\nColorectal cancer risk factor profiles\nwe also identified the most common risk factor profiles.\nAmong those with 1 or more risk factor, the top 3 most\ncommon risk profiles were obesity only, physical inactivity\nonly, and both obesity and physical inactivity; these\nwere also the most common profiles among women,\nJoshu et al.\nCancer Prev Res; 5(1) January 2012 Cancer Prevention Research\nResearch.\ncancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\nTable 1.

In the Annual Report to the Nation, it was estimated\nthat screening, in combination with a considerable reduc-\ntion in the 2000 prevalence of lifestyle risk factors could\nhave a significant impact on colorectal cancer mortality (3).\nYet, we observed no notable improvement in the prevalence\nof a subset of those risk factors in the decade between 1999\nand 2008. The combination of suboptimal screening rates\nand a steady prevalence of lifestyle risk factors suggests that\ncolorectal cancer rates will not decrease to the extent pos-\nsible in the near future. The most prevalent modifiable risk\nfactors for colorectal cancer, like obesity, are not novel;\nthese are the same risk factors as for other chronic diseases,\nlike diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our findings do\nnot signify a need for specialized colorectal cancer lifestyle\ninterventions, but they do provide additional evidence for\nthe need for the early intervention and targeted prevention\nand wellness services to be developed as part of the Patient\nIn the clinical setting, the guidelines for colorectal cancer\nprevention focus on screening the average risk adult at age\n50 (16). However, our data indicate that the conversation\nabout colorectal cancer risk and prevention needs to start\nmuch earlier. We observed that more than 15% of those\nyounger than 50, and thus, not recommended for screening,\nhad 3 or more risk factors. In contrast to overall rates,\ncolorectal cancer incidence has increased in those younger\nthan 50 (7). Alerting younger adults about their colorectal\ncancer risk based on lifestyle factors provides an opportu-\nnity for change. Awareness of personal risk due to lifestyle\nrisk factors may also increase awareness of the importance\nof adherence to screening guidelines at the appropriate age.\nIndeed, a growing body of evidence supports the benefit of\nsimultaneously addressing multiple health behaviors in\nhealth care settings (17\u00ad19). Because colorectal cancer\nscreening is a complex behavior (20); more research is\nneeded to determine whether increased awareness of life-\nstyle risk factors among young adults would influence\nfuture screening behavior.\nOur findings also show that the population subgroups\nwith the highest burden of colorectal incidence and\nmortality also have the greatest opportunity for primary\nprevention through lifestyle modification. The total\nburden of colorectal cancer risk factors mirrored color-\nectal cancer incidence and mortality rates by sex and\nrace/ethnicity. Men had a higher total number of risk\nfactors than women; men also have higher colorectal\ncancer incidence and mortality rates than women (21).\nNon-Hispanic blacks had the highest total number of risk\nfactors among the race/ethnicity groups; and African\nAmericans have the highest colorectal cancer incidence\nand mortality (21). Providing access to resources that\nencourage appropriate lifestyle changes, and increasing\naccess to screening, may improve colorectal cancer rates\nin those with the highest burden.\nWe used nationally representative data to estimate the\nseparate and joint prevalences of risk factors, overall, and by\nTable 2.

Red meat and processed meat intakes were\nevaluated using the current state-of-art, 1-day, 24-hour diet\nrecall, using the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Automat-\ned Multiple Pass Method (23). We used a single 24-hour diet\nrecall because multiple days were not available for 2 of the 5\nNHANES cycles evaluated. Although multiple days of 24-\nhour diet recall are needed to assess individuals' usual\nintake, this single 24-hour recall is a robust method to\ndescribe the average dietary intake of a group (23).\nImproved clinical and community preventive services are\na major aspect of the National Prevention Strategy. Colo-\nrectal cancer is a disease with many opportunities for\nprevention. Increasing national screening rates is an impor-\ntant strategy for reducing the burden of colorectal cancer,\nbut it should not be the only strategy. We found that the vast\nmajority of American adults have at least one modifiable\ncolorectal cancer risk factor. Furthermore, a sizable propor-\ntion of those younger than 50 years have several colorectal\ncancer risk factors. When advising the public about risks\nassociated with factors like obesity and cigarette smoking,\ncolorectal cancer should be included in the discussion.\nIncreasing the public's awareness that these factors also\nimpact colorectal cancer risk may enhance efforts to modify\nlifestyle, and may further encourage adherence to screening\nguidelines. The most successful national strategy for colo-\nrectal cancer prevention will likely include complementary\napproaches of both screening and lifestyle modification.\nDisclosure of Potential Conflic of Interest\nNo potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.\nGrant Support\nThe content of this manuscript is solely the responsibility of the authors\nand does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Cancer\nInstitute or the NIH.\nC.E.
