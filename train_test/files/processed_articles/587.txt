A large body of literature con-\nfirms that women outlive men worldwide [4\u00ad6]. However, in Northern, Latin American and\nCaribbean countries [7\u00ad10], and in a few South Asian countries [11\u00ad12], women are more\nlikely than men to report self-rated worse health and higher prevalence and incidence of dis-\nability and chronic morbidity.\nDoes this gender gap hold for India, where gender plays a crucial role from birth to death,\nand from nutrition to health care service utilizations? The answer is of enormous policy rele-\nvance. The literature addressing the gender gap in mortality in India is ample [13\u00ad16]. Unlike\nin the developed world, Indian females do not enjoy survival advantages over males in every\nage group. More recent studies find that the female infant mortality rate in many states of India\nis higher than the male infant mortality rate [17]. India still has a high volume of excess female\ndeaths at infant and child age (1\u00ad4 years) due to discriminatory care at home, discriminatory\nhealth-care seeking and selective termination of female fetuses [18]. Despite this, Indian\nfemales enjoy a higher life expectancy at birth than males and the male-female gap in survivor-\nship favours adult and elderly females.\nDespite this important role of gender in health and mortality, few studies address the gender\ndifference in self-rated health (SRH) [12,19\u00ad21] and in self-reported disability (SRD) in India\n[22\u00ad24]; these debate the gender difference in SRH and SRD side by side and arrive at different\nconclusions. While some studies [21,25] demonstrate that the gender differential in SRH per-\nsists even after adjusting socio-economic variables, other studies show that the gender differen-\ntial in self-assessed health turns in favour of women when adjusted for the role of socio-\neconomic factors [19]. It is found that women tend to report worse health than men, especially\namong the socio-economically advantaged group [25], and socio-economic status contributes\nsignificantly to this gap [19]. Studies on gender difference in SRD also reveal that, in general,\nwomen report higher disability condition than men [22\u00ad23], but the gender difference in dis-\nability may not be significant in the context of South India [24].\nSelf-rated health (SRH) is a widely used measure based on a person's self-assessment of his/\nher status in response to the question \"In general, how would you rate your health today?\" [26\u00ad\n28]. Although SRH overlooks the concern of interpersonal incomparability; it is a remarkably\nreliable measure that is consistent with the actual health status of the respondents [26,29]. Self-\nrated health has been used to assess the health status of populations and predict health out-\ncome, survival, impending morbidity and death [26,29\u00ad31]. Self-reported disability, another\nSRH measure, is extensively used to assess disability and is considered a reflection of true dis-\nability among the elderly population [32\u00ad33]. It is defined as functional limitations in activities\nof daily living involving bathing, eating, a transfer from bed to chair, use of the toilet, etc. [33].\nNumerous earlier studies demonstrated empirically that data on SRH and SRD is consistent\nwith both performed measures and medical diagnosis [32,34\u00ad35]. Earlier studies confirmed\nthat both men and women report their disability accurately, and the higher prevalence of\nGender Differential in Health\nCompeting Interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nreported functional problems among women is perhaps a reflection of true disability for most\ndisability measures [32]. A five-year follow-up survey of the Study on Global Ageing and Adult\nHealth (SAGE) conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) multi-country study on\nglobal ageing and adult health in rural India found that bad or very bad self-rated health was a\nstrong predictor of mortality for persons aged above 50, even after controlling for socio-demo-\ngraphic and disability measures [26].\nThe purpose of the present study is to examine the gender differential in SRH and SRD\namong older adults in India. Our study extends the extant knowledge in several directions.\nFirst, we combine the analysis of gender difference in SRH and SRD to present a coherent pic-\nture of the gender difference in health status among adults in India. Second, we investigate gen-\nder difference in total life expectancy (TLE), disabled life expectancy (DLE) and disabled free\nlife expectancy (DFLE) to demonstrate the health disadvantage of women despite survival\nadvantage in adult age. Finally, unlike most of the previous studies on SRD in India, our study\nis based on a nationally representative survey, indicating a generalization of results at national\nlevel. The findings on gender inequality in adult health might prove useful for health planners\nand policy makers, especially in countries subject to rapid health transition.\nData and Methods\n2.1. Ethics statement\nWe used cross-sectional WHO SAGE survey data, approved by the Ethics Review Committee\nof the WHO, Geneva and the International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai (IIPS)\nimplementing the national SAGE survey. Before conducting the interviews, respondents partic-\nipating in this survey were given a \"Respondent information Form\", which detailed the giving\ndetails of the survey purpose, methods and data collection procedure involved in this survey.\nFinally, written informed consent was taken from the respondents of aged 21 and older. For\nparticipants under 21 years old of age, a parent or guardian also signed in the consent form.\n2.2. Data Description\nWe used data primarily from the SAGE, carried out by the IIPS in 2007\u00ad08 under the WHO\nmulti-country study on global ageing and adult health. The main objective of this study was to\nobtain reliable, valid and comparable data on levels of health across a range of key domains for\nadult populations aged 50-plus in nationally represented samples. The study aimed also to sup-\nplement and cross-validate self-reported measures of health by anchoring a vignette approach\nto improving the comparability of self-reported measures for selected health domains [36\u00ad37].\nThe first wave of the SAGE was implemented in six states selected to ensure a nationally\nrepresentative sample--Assam, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West\nBengal. The same primary sampling units (PSUs) and households covered in the 2003 World\nHealth Survey (WHS) are comprised the baseline sample for SAGE Wave 1 India in 2007\u00ad08.\ninterviews were completed, 494 interviews were partially completed and the rest were either\nrefused or missed. Our analysis is based on 10,736 completed interviews, of which about 58.2\npercent belong to the 50+ age group.\nThrough face-to-face interviews, information was collected on the physical characteristics\nof the dwelling or household; a household roster, including the sex, age, marital status, educa-\ntion, and care needs of each household member; cash and non-cash transfers into and out of\nthe household; household income and expenditure; work history and benefits; health and\nhealth behaviours; chronic conditions; health care utilization; social networks; subjective well-\nbeing and quality of life; and on the impact of caregiving. The health status of individuals was\nGender Differential in Health\nalso assessed with the help of the following biomarkers: anthropometry (weight, height, body\nmass index, waist-to-hip ratio); physical tests (timed walk, hand grip strength, lung function,\nvision tests, blood pressure); cognition tests (verbal fluency, immediate and delayed verbal\nrecall, digit span); and blood tests (from consenting respondents, to test for anaemia, diabetes,\nand cardiovascular disease). A detailed description of this data can be found in the India\nNational Report of the SAGE [36].\nSelf-rated health was defined by the answer to the question \"In general, how would you rate\nyour health today?\" The options to answer this question were available on a five-point Likert\nscale: very good, good, moderate, bad and very bad. In our analysis, we converted the responses\nfrom a five-point scale to a three-point scale by combining very good and good to \"good\",\nmoderate to \"moderate\" and very bad and bad to \"poor\". Self-reported disability in 20 activities\nof daily living (ADL, defined as having severe or extreme difficulties performing activities of\ndaily living) measures--addressing mobility, self-care, pain and discomfort, cognition, inter-\npersonal activities, sleep and energy, affect and vision were used to measure disability. For\nexample, the first question related to mobility is \"Overall in last 30 days, how much difficulty\ndid you have with moving around?\" The options to answer this question were available on a\nfive-point Likert scale: none, mild, moderate, severe and extreme or cannot do. If the answer\nfrom the respondent \"severe\" or \"extreme or cannot do\" in moving around, it is defined as a\nself-reported disability in moving around ADL. The details of the questions used to define self-\nreported disability are given in S1 Appendix.\nWe analyzed gender differentials in self-rated health by a number of socio-economic and\ndemographic variables, including age, gender, education (primary school or less, secondary\nschool completed, tertiary or higher education); wealth quintiles of household, (Q1 lowest to\nQ5 highest), religion (Hindu, Muslim and Others); ethnicity (Others, Scheduled Caste (SC)\nand Scheduled Tribe (ST)); and marital status (currently married, never married and sepa-\nrated/divorced/widowed).\n2.4. Statistical Methods\nTo estimate the prevalence of SRH and SRD by gender, we used STATA S.E. 10.0 (STATA\nCorp., Inc., College Station, TX). We performed chi-square test to assess whether there were\nsignificant gender differences in the sample by socio-economic and demographic factors and\nalso in self-reported disabilities. To estimate DFLE and DLE, the Sullivan Method [38] was\napplied. We used the proportion of disability by age and sex on Sample Registration System\nin India covering six million of population in India, provides the most reliable estimates of vital\nrates at national and sub-national levels (state categorized by rural-urban) since the 1970s. A\ndetailed description of SRS data can be found elsewhere [40]. We used multinomial logistic\nregression to assess the adjusted effect of gender on SRH. The outcome variable has three cate-\ngories: self-reported good, moderate and poor health. We estimated the relative risk of (1) poor\nhealth versus good health and (2) moderate health versus good health. Age was estimated as a\ncontinuous independent variable. The gender, education and wealth quintiles of a household,\nreligion, ethnicity and marital status were considered as categorical independent variables. A\np-value less than or equal to 0.05 was considered significant. The evidence for multicollinearity\nwas assessed by the multicollinearity diagnostic (variance inflation factor or VIF). All VIFs\nwere less than 2, indicating that the assumption of reasonable independence among predictor\nGender Differential in Health\nvariables was met. A total of 113 missing cases (1 case in age, 71 cases in wealth index and 41\ncases in ethnicity) were excluded from the multinomial logistic regression analysis.\nResults\n3.1. Self-rated Health (SRH)\nTable 1 presents gender differentials in self-rated health by socio-economic and demographic\ncharacteristics. The figures presented in the table are the percentage of men and women report-\ning self-rated health, categorized into good, moderate and poor health. In general, 15.1% of\nIndian women rated their health as \"poor\" compared to15.2% of Indian men. Most findings in\nthis table are in the expected direction. For example, as age increases, the percentage of people\nbetter health than rural people (45.4% urban men report good health against37.7% rural men;\n40.7% urban women report good health against 38.0% rural women); as education increases,\nthe percent of people reporting good health increases (Men: 28.4% to 56.9%; Women: 30.8% to\n61.3%), as household wealth index increases from poorest to least poorest quintile, self-rated\ndeprived social groups like Muslims, STs and SCs reported poor self-rated health. Table 1 also\npresents the p-value of chi-square test examining gender difference in socio-economic and\ndemographic variables. Except for a few predictors (wealth index, religion and ethnicity), p-val-\nues were always significant, indicating a clear existence of gender difference in the predictor\nvariables.\nThe most noticeable finding in Table 1 is the presence of clear gender differences in self-\nrated health by socio-economic and demographic characteristics. Women from each age group\nreport systematically poorer self-rated health than men. Interestingly, as age increases, the gen-\nder difference in self-rated health also increases. While a higher percentage of urban men than\nurban women rate their health as \"good\", there is no difference in self-rated health between\nrural men and women. Likewise, except those in the deprived categories (say, belonging to\nrural, low educated, household with poor wealth quintile and scheduled tribes) all women\nrated their health worse than men.\n3.2. Self-rated disabilities in activities of daily living (ADL)\nTable 2 reports the prevalence estimates of SRD in 20 ADL measures by gender in India for\n2007\u00ad2008. The most striking finding is that out of twenty ADL measures addressing mobility,\nself-care, pain/discomfort, cognition, interpersonal activities, sleep/ energy, affect and vision,\nwomen reported systematically higher prevalence of severe and extreme disability than men in\nfourteen measures. Among all these measures, the gender difference in self-rated disabilities is\nmore pronounced in three components: pain and discomfort, interpersonal relationship and\naffects. The p-values of chi-square test examining gender difference in self-reported disabilities\nagain indicate a clear existence of gender difference in performance of activities of daily living.\nTable 3 and Fig 1 further present prevalence estimates (in percentage) in at least one, three\nand five self-reported disabilities by gender and age groups in India for 2007\u00ad2008. Table 3 and\nFig 1 clearly suggest that a higher proportion of women suffer from disabilities in ADL in all\nadult age groups. However, the gender differential was the highest in the age group less than 50\nand 50\u00ad59, with the percent of women reporting more than five disabilities being two times\nmore than their male counterparts (Male: 3.9% against 8.1% female in age group <50; Male:\nTable 4 demonstrates total life expectancy (TLE), DFLE, DLE and percent of life with dis-\nability (DLE/TLE) by age and gender, calculated for at least one, three and five disabilities out\nGender Differential in Health\nof twenty disabilities as shown in Table 2. After age20, women are expected to live longer than\nmen at each age. On average, women live two years longer than men, and the gender gap\n(women versus men) reduces from 4.0 years at age 20 to 0.6 years at age 80. However, women\nare also expected to live more years with disability, as DLE for women for any number of dis-\nabilities is higher than DLE for men at each age. Interestingly, the gender disparity in DLE is\nfar more pronounced than the gender disparity in total life expectancy and varies greatly by\nage. For example, the gender difference in DLE calculated for at least one self-disability is a\nTable 1.

Once again, women spend a higher proportion of their life with poorer health\nstatus.\nThe magnitude of DLE and percentage of life with disability reduced to almost half and\none-fourth when we calculated the same for at least three and five self-rated disability respec-\ntively. Nevertheless, we observed similar kind of gender disparity in TLE, DFLE, DLE and per-\ncent of life with a disability.\nTable 5 presents the results of the multinomial logistic regression. The majority of the asso-\nciations found in Table 5 are consistent with the findings of Table 2. The relative risk ratio\n(RRR) of having poor health versus good health increases as age increase (RRR: 1.90; CI: 1.81\u00ad\n2.00); decreases as wealth of the household increases; is higher among Muslims (RRR: 2.04; CI:\nTable 2.

All these relationships are statistically sig-\nnificant. Similar results are found in the RRRs of having moderate health versus good health, as\nshown in Table 5. The most noticeable point in Table 5 is that females have significantly higher\nrelative risk than men of having poor health versus good health (RRR: 1.69; CI: 1.46\u00ad1.97), and\nof having moderate health versus good health (RRR: 1.39; CI: 1.25\u00ad1.55). Thus, even after con-\ntrolling for relevant socio-economic variables, women are more likely than men to report poor\nor moderate health.\nTable 3.

Prevalence Estimates (in percentage) of self-reported disabilities by gender and age groups,\nGender Differential in Health\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nOur first objective was to contribute to the debate over the gender difference in SRH in India.\nWe found that, in general, Indian adult women report poorer health than Indian adult men.\nThis finding is consistent with the findings of studies conducted in other countries [41\u00ad 43]\neven after adjusting the effect of the socio-economic condition. This is contrary to the findings\nof a previous study [19]. The finding of this study, however, is consistent with the previous\nfindings [20\u00ad21] that health disadvantages among women could not be explained by the differ-\nence in demographics and socio-economic characteristics.\nThere are a few explanations why women live longer than men but have poorer health. Sev-\neral studies exhibit that this is due to biological, social and behavioral factors [47\u00ad50].\nResearchers have suggested that two factors in particular contribute the excess mortality of\nmen. First, women are more likely than men to adopt preventative health behaviors, such as\nroutine annual visits to a physician for a check-up. Men are more likely to engage in risky\nbehaviours, such as excessive drinking, drunken driving, illegal drug use, physical fights and\nviolence and high tobacco consumption [48,51\u00ad55]. Early in life, boys are more susceptible to\ndeath than girls due to biological reasons [56\u00ad57]. In adolescence, youth and adulthood, men\ndie from exposure to risks linked to their social and behavioural characteristics [48]. Studies\nargued that poorer health among women is due to biological as well as behavioural factors.\nSome studies discuss that while women suffer more than men, female ailments tend to be less\nlethal biologically [7,58]. Some other studies refer to the over-reporting of worse health among\nwomen [59\u00ad60]. In addition, women's longer life expectancy also influences male-female dif-\nferences in health status [3]. It is showed that larger the female excess in longevity, larger the\nfemale excess in the proportion of life in poor health [3].\nOur second objective was to extend the analysis to SRD and its connotation with life expec-\ntancy at various stages of adulthood. All three measures of SRD (prevalence estimates of SRD\nin more than one, three and five ADL measures, corresponding DLEs and proportion of life\nspent with disability at various stages of life) revealed that Indian women are subject to higher\nMale Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female\nLimitation in at least one SRD\nLimitation in at least three SRD\nLimitation in at least five SRD\nTLE-total life expectancy, DLE-disabled life expectancy, DFLE-disabled free life expectancy, SRD: Self-rated disability\nGender Differential in Health\nlevels of disability irrespective of their age. Notably, the gender gap in disability is found to be\nthe highest in difficulty in more than five ADLs in the age groups before age 60 (women\nreported two times more than men). Our findings are consistent with the common wisdom\nthat the gender difference in disability is substantial, especially in ADL measures [61\u00ad 64].\nFuture research should focus more on the unmet need of personal care among disabled adults\nwhether gender plays an important role in caregiving to differential exists in proving care and\ntreatment.\nIn the past several decades, life expectancy has increased in India; there are now over 192\nmillion people aged 50 or older [39]. As a consequence of the rapid ageing of the population,\nthe central theme of health research in India has expanded beyond longevity towards under-\nstanding the burden of disease and disability, particularly among adults. Longevity is greater\namong females than males, especially at adult ages, in India--as in all other countries. Does the\nTable 5.

By using nationally repre-\nsentative survey data, this study first investigated the role of gender in self-rated health among\nadults in India after controlling for socio-economic and demographic characteristics, and\nexamined gender differential in SRD in performing twenty ADLs (severe and extremely diffi-\nculty) and thereafter revealed the linkage between survival and SRD measured by TLE, DFLE,\nDLE and percent of life spent with self-reported disability.\nThis study suggests that in India, as in other parts of the world, women bear the greater bur-\nden of disability in their adult age. In the absence of governmental support, the problem might\nbe acute, especially among marginalized women living alone, widowed and poorly off socio-\neconomically. The findings of this study strongly suggest the need for a coherent and gender\nsensitive health agenda for ageing populations in India. We also suggest future in-depth studies\nfocused on the complex gender dynamics in health and disability in India at a regional level.\nLimitations\nThe present study has a few limitations. First, we could not throw light on the regional dimen-\nsions of gender differentials in SRH and SRD because the sample size at the regional level is\ninadequate. Previous studies have documented the regional divide in gender differentials in\nhealth outcomes in India [44,69]. Neither could we test the relationship between female excess\nlongevity and female excess in the proportion of life in poor health using time trend data. Sec-\nond, we could not analyze the trend of gender differentials in DLE in India due to lack of such\ndata. In the absence of it, we again could not test whether increasing SRD by women is a func-\ntion of increasing survivorship or that women naturally report poorer health even in the\nabsence of acute gender differential in survivorship.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Appendix.
