This study\nassessed the relationship between cell phone use and actual college grade point average (GPA) after controlling for known\npredictors. As such, 536 undergraduate students from 82 self-reported majors at a large, public university were sampled. A\nhierarchical regression (R2 = .449) demonstrated that cell phone use was significantly (p < .001) and negatively ( = -.164)\nrelated to actual college GPA after controlling for demographic variables, self-efficacy for self-regulated learning, self-efficacy\nfor academic achievement, and actual high school GPA, which were all significant predictors (p < .05). Thus, after controlling\nfor other established predictors, increased cell phone use was associated with decreased academic performance. Although\nmore research is needed to identify the underlying mechanisms, findings suggest a need to sensitize students and educators\nabout the potential academic risks associated with high-frequency cell phone use.\n",

As cell phone technology con-\ntinues its rapid development, the device appears capable of\ncontributing to student learning and improved academic per-\nformance. For example, modern \"smartphones\" provide stu-\ndents with immediate, portable access to many of the same\neducation-enhancing capabilities as an Internet-connected\ncomputer, such as online information retrieval, file sharing,\nand interacting with professors and fellow students (Bull &\nresearch suggests that many college students perceive the\ncell phone primarily as a leisure device, and most commonly\nuse cell phones for social networking, surfing the Internet,\nwatching videos, and playing games (Lepp, Li, & Barkley,\ntypically utilized for leisure rather than education, then cell\nphones may disrupt learning within academic settings\n(Levine, Waite, & Bowman, 2007). Thus, the potential rela-\ntionship between cell phone use and academic performance\nis not clear.\nIn support of the \"cell phone as disrupter\" hypothesis, a\nrecent study by our group (Lepp et al., 2013) found that cell\nphone use was negatively associated with an objective mea-\nsure of cardiorespiratory fitness in a sample of typical U.S.\ncollege students. Interview data collected for the study\nexplained the negative relationship by suggesting that cell\nphone use disrupts physical activity and encourages seden-\ntary behavior. Unpublished interview data collected as part\nof the same study suggest that cell phone use may also dis-\nrupt behaviors conducive to academic success. For example,\nwhen asked to describe cell phone use habits, one participant\nstated, \"I usually go on my phone if I'm bored sitting there in\nclass. Or during homework I'll take little Twitter breaks.\"\nAnother student said,\nIf I'm in class and I'm bored then I'll use my phone to look on\nFacebook. I think it's just kind of a habit now that I have, which\nprobably isn't a good one. But, it's just that I always have it [the\nphone] on me.\n1Kent State University, OH, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nAndrew Lepp, College of Education, Health and Human Services, Kent\nEmail: alepp1@kent.edu\nThe Relationship Between Cell Phone Use\nand Academic Performance in a Sample\nof U.S. College Students\nAndrew Lepp1, Jacob E. Barkley1, and Aryn C. Karpinski1\n Keywords\neducation, technology, ICT, mobile phones, smartphones, GPA, self-efficacy\n2 SAGE Open\nAcross the interviews, such statements were more com-\nmon among high-frequency cell phone users than among\nlow-frequency users. These statements suggest that some\nstudents, particularly high-frequency users, may have diffi-\nculty regulating their cell phone use during academic endeav-\nors such as class participation, homework, and studying.\nThus, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the\nrelationship between cell phone use and academic perfor-\nmance in a large sample of U.S. college students.\nLiterature Review\nAlthough the cell phone is likely to be on hand while college\nstudents are in class and studying, research investigating its\nrelationship to academic performance is limited. In an early\nstudy of the phenomenon, S\u00e1nchez-Mart\u00ednez and Otero\n(2009) used a combination of self-reported monthly cell\nphone expenses and frequency of use data to identify inten-\nsive cell phone users in a large sample of Spanish high school\nstudents. In the study, intensive cell phone use was related to\nschool failure as well as other negative behaviors such as\nsmoking and excessive alcohol use. More recent studies\noperationalize cell phone use as calling and texting while uti-\nlizing a variety of measures for academic performance. For\nexample, Jacobsen and Forste (2011) identified a negative\nrelationship between calling, texting, and self-reported grade\npoint average (GPA) among university students in the United\nStates. Similarly, Hong, Chiu, and Hong (2012) found that\ncalling and texting were positively correlated with a self-\nreported measure of academic difficulty among a sample of\nfemale, Taiwanese university students. While these studies\nprovide a starting point for understanding the relationship\nbetween cell phone use and academic performance, they nei-\nther use objective measures of academic performance nor do\nthey take into account the cell phone's expanding capabili-\nties beyond calling and texting.\nModern cell phones enable users to access a variety of\nelectronic media at almost any time and any place. Popular\nactivities such as playing video games, surfing the Internet,\nand monitoring social media sites are now all easily accom-\nplished with most cell phones. Researchers have linked each\nof these activities, independent of cell phone use, to aca-\ndemic performance. For example, heavy video game playing\nhas been associated with lower GPAs (Jackson, von Eye,\nFitzgerald, Witt, & Zhao, 2011; Jackson, von Eye, Witt,\nZhao, & Fitzgerald, 2011). Also, low levels of Internet use\nhave been associated with improved academic performance\namong heavy Internet users information seeking was associ-\nated with better academic performance, while video game\nplaying was associated with lower levels of academic perfor-\nmance. Several recent studies have identified a negative rela-\ntionship between social-networking site use (e.g., Facebook,\nMySpace, Twitter) and academic performance (e.g., Rosen,\nCarrier, & Cheever, 2013; Stollak, Vandenberg, Burklund, &\ndemonstrated that Facebook users have a lower self-reported\nGPA and spend fewer hours per week studying than nonus-\nrelationship between time spent on Facebook and actual\ncumulative GPA. These negative relationships have been\nfound in populations across the world, including North\nAmerica, Europe, and Asia (e.g., Chen & Tzeng, 2010;\nKarpinski, Kirschner, Ozer, Mellott, & Ochwo, 2013).\nRecently, multitasking has emerged as a possible explana-\ntion for the negative relationship between electronic media\nuse (including cell phone use) and academic performance\nthat students frequently report using a variety of electronic\nmedia including cell phones while in class, studying, and\ndoing homework (Jacobsen & Forste, 2011; Junco & Cotton,\n2012). Several recent studies, using a variety of methods,\nidentify a negative relationship between multitasking and\nacademic performance. First, Wood et al. (2012) measured\nthe influence of multitasking with an array of electronic\nmedia on students' ability to learn from typical, university\nclassroom lectures. Emailing, MSN messaging, and\nFacebook use via computer were all investigated as was cell\nphone texting. Results showed that multitasking with any of\nthe technologies was associated with lower scores on follow-\nup tests compared with students who did not multitask.\nSecond, Junco and Cotton (2012) used a hierarchical regres-\nsion to determine the power of multitasking to predict actual\ncumulative college GPA. Results showed that Facebook-\nmultitasking and texting-multitasking were significantly and\nnegatively related to college GPA after controlling for sex,\nactual high school GPA, time preparing for class, and a stu-\ndent's Internet skills. Finally, Rosen et al. (2013) observed\nthe study behaviors as well as study settings of a sample of\nmiddle school, high school, and university students.\nParticipants were observed for 15 min with on-task and off-\ntask behavior recorded every minute. Results showed that\nparticipants typically became distracted by media such as\nFacebook and texting after less than 6 min of studying.\nFurthermore, measurements of daily Facebook use and daily\ntexting behavior predicted off-task behavior during study\nperiods as well as self-reported GPA.\nIn review, emerging research suggests that texting,\nInternet use, email, and social-networking sites such as\nFacebook can potentially increase multitasking and task-\nswitching during academic activities and decrease academic\nperformance. Notably, all of these previously investigated\nactivities can now be accomplished with a single, Internet-\nconnected cell phone. Therefore, measurements of cell phone\nuse should not be limited to only texting and calling but\nshould take this wide array of activities into account.\nFurthermore, and in consideration of the ubiquity of the cell\nLepp et al. 3\nphone, the relationship between this expanded definition of\ncell phone use and academic performance warrants\ninvestigation.\nSelf-Efficacy Beliefs and Academic Performance\nIn addition to improving the way cell phone use is measured,\na better understanding of the relationship between cell phone\nuse and academic performance requires incorporating addi-\ntional, well-established predictors into any statistical models\ndesigned to assess this relationship. An abundance of\nresearch suggests that self-efficacy beliefs are among the\nstrongest predictors of academic performance (for a compre-\nhensive review, see Pajares, 1996). Generally speaking, self-\nefficacy describes an individual's belief in his or her\ncapabilities to organize and execute the behaviors necessary\nfor success; as such, self-efficacy beliefs are a key mecha-\nnism in human agency (Bandura, 1982). Self-efficacy beliefs\nare domain specific; thus, research has identified self-effi-\ncacy beliefs pertinent to academic performance (Pajares,\n1996). The strength of academic self-efficacy constructs is\ntheir influence over behavior. Students who report high aca-\ndemic self-efficacy apply greater effort to academic pursuits,\nare more persistent in the face of obstacles, and exhibit a\ntion, research illustrates that academic self-efficacy can\nmediate the effects of academic ability (Pajares, 1996). As a\nresult, academic self-efficacy is positively correlated with\nvirtually all measures of academic performance, including\nsemester grades, cumulative GPA, homework, test scores,\nand writing assignments (Multon, Brown, & Lent, 1991;\nResearch has demonstrated that efficacy beliefs are often\nbetter predictors of academic performance than other com-\nmonly used social-psychological variables (e.g., Klomegah,\nFor example, self-efficacy proved to be the strongest predic-\ntor of college student's academic performance in a model\nincluding task value, goal orientations, metacognitive self-\nregulation, self-regulation, and learning strategies (Al-Harthy\n& Was, 2010). Two self-efficacy constructs in particular\nhave received much attention for their ability to predict aca-\ndemic performance (Pajares, 1996). These are self-efficacy\nfor self-regulated learning (SE:SRL) and self-efficacy for\nacademic achievement (SE:AA; Zimmerman, Bandura, &\nMartinez-Pons, 1992). SE:SRL concerns an individual's\nbelief in his or her capabilities to proactively regulate his or\nher learning on the path to academic achievement. This\nincludes belief in one's ability to resist distractions while\nlearning and to create study environments conducive to\nlearning. As such, it is an important variable to consider\nwhen exploring the relationship between potential distractors\nsuch as cell phones or other new media and academic perfor-\nmance (LaRose & Eastin, 2004; LaRose, Lin, & Eastin,\nrelated construct is SE:AA, which describes an individual's\nbelief in his or her capabilities to learn material from specific\ncontent areas such as math, science, and history. As origi-\nnally conceived and validated by Zimmerman et al. (1992),\nSE:SRL influences SE:AA, which in turn influences final\nacademic achievement. As predicted by the original model\nand subsequently verified, previous academic performance\ncan influence both SE:SRL and SE:AA (Caprara, Vecchione,\nAlessandri, Gerbino, & Barbaranelli, 2011).\nResearch Question\nConsidering the existing research, as well as the unpublished\ninterview data presented in the introduction of this article, it\nis hypothesized that cell phone use and academic perfor-\nmance are related. However, in assessing this relationship,\nthere is a need to consider important statistical controls such\nas SE:SRL, SE:AA, and previous academic performance\n(i.e., high school GPA). Similarly, research suggests that\nchoice in academic major, as well as demographic and\nbehavioral factors, may also be predictive of academic per-\nformance and should, therefore, be considered. This study\nconsidered four such factors: sex, cigarette smoking, class\nstanding, and undergraduate major. Indeed, there are well-\nestablished sex-related differences in college students' aca-\ndemic performance (Peter & Horn, 2005). Likewise, cigarette\nsmoking has been associated with problematic cell phone\nuse and poor academic performance (DeBerard, Spielmans,\nstanding and undergraduate major may also be potential pre-\ndictors (Kirschner & Karpinski, 2010; Sulaiman & Mohezar,\n2006). In addition, there is a need to operationalize cell\nphone use more broadly (i.e., assess total cell phone use) in\nconsideration of the device's increased functionality. Finally,\nthere is a need to use objective measures of academic perfor-\nmance such as students' official cumulative GPA. This study\nfulfills these many needs by answering the following ques-\ntion: What is the relationship between total cell phone use\n(i.e., calling, texting, video games, social networking, surf-\ning the Internet, software-based applications, etc.) and aca-\ndemic performance (i.e., actual college GPA) after controlling\nfor previously identified predictors of academic performance\n(i.e., actual high school GPA, SE:SRL, SE:AA, sex, cigarette\nuse, class standing, and academic major)?\nMethod\nThe dependent variable for this study, academic perfor-\nmance, was objectively assessed using participants' actual\ncumulative college GPA. In addition, actual high school GPA\nwas used as a statistical control. Because these are sensitive\ndata, and collecting them involves accessing participants'\nofficial academic records, participants were assured that data\ncollection, storage, and reporting would guarantee confiden-\ntiality and anonymity. Participants were recruited during\n4 SAGE Open\nclass time from courses that typically attract students from a\ndiversity of undergraduate majors. Representative courses\ninclude introduction to sociology, general biology, American\npolitics, human nutrition, and world history. During class\ntime, the principal investigators explained the methods to all\nstudents present, answered questions, addressed concerns,\nand ensured that the informed consent document was read,\nunderstood, and signed. After this, a survey was distributed\nand completed during class by all students who consented to\nparticipate in the study. On the survey, students provided\ntheir university email address, which was later used to access\ntheir academic records. If students did not consent to have\ntheir GPAretrieved, they did not participate in the study. This\nmethod produced an initial sample size of 536 undergraduate\nstudents from 82 self-reported majors.\nMeasures\nThe survey took approximately 10 min to complete. Students\nfirst provided basic demographic and lifestyle information.\nStudents completed the validated SE:SRL (Zimmerman et\nParticipants also provided information regarding their cell\nphone use as operationalized by Lepp et al. (2013) and,\nfinally, their email addresses. Email addresses were used to\naccess each student's official academic records from which\ncollege and high school GPAs were collected.\nSE:SRL is an 11-item scale that measures how well stu-\ndents believe that they can use a variety of self-regulated\nlearning strategies such as finish homework assignments by\ndeadlines, study when there are other interesting things to do,\nconcentrate on school subjects, and arrange a place to study\nSE:AA is a nine-item scale that measures how well students\nbelieve that they can achieve success in important academic\ndomains such as reading, writing, English grammar, mathe-\nmatics, science, social studies, and computer use. For the\nitems in both self-efficacy measures, students used a seven-\npoint Likert-type scale to rate their perceived capability to do\nwell (i.e., 1 = not too well to 7 = very well). Responses for the\nitems in each scale were summed, thereby producing a total\nscore. Higher scores indicate greater self-efficacy. Both\nscales have been previously validated and found to have\nstrong internal consistency (coefficient  = .87 and .70,\nrespectively; Zimmerman et al., 1992). Since their develop-\nment, both have been consistently shown to be reliable pre-\ndictors of academic performance in variety settings (Pajares,\n1996). Likewise, the SE:SRL and SE:AA scales demon-\nstrated strong internal consistency with this study's sample\nof undergraduate students (coefficient  = .84 and .73,\nTotal daily cell phone use was measured using the follow-\ning item:\nAs accurately as possible, please estimate the total amount of\ntime you spend using your mobile phone each day. Please\nconsider all uses except listening to music. For example:\nconsider calling, texting, sending photos, gaming, surfing the\nInternet, watching videos, Facebook, email, and all other uses\ndriven by \"apps\" and software.\nParticipants provided best estimates for hours of cell\nphone use per day and minutes per day. Total use in minutes\nwas calculated for each participant as hours \u00d7 60 + minutes.\nIn developing this measure of total cell phone use, two focus\ngroups of undergraduate students reviewed the question for\ncontent validity criteria, including (a) clarity in wording, (b)\nrelevance of the items, (c) use of standard English, (d)\nabsence of biased words and phrases, (e) formatting of items,\nand (f) clarity of the instructions (Fowler, 2002). Most stu-\ndents provided feedback from the criteria categories of (a),\n(b), (c), and (f). Appropriate alterations were made to the sur-\nvey based upon the responses and suggestions. In consider-\nation of this measure's construct validity, participants' daily\ntext messaging and daily calling were assessed as this is how\ncell phone use has been operationalized in previous research\n(e.g., Jacobsen & Forste, 2011). Total daily cell phone use\n(calling, texting plus all other uses such as Internet browsing\nand games) was positively correlated with daily texting (r =\ning that the measures are related but not identical. In addi-\ntion, we assessed construct validity in a small group (N = 21)\nof undergraduate college students at the same university\nfrom which the present sample was culled. Self-reported\ntotal cell phone use (minutes) as assessed by this measure\nhad a large, significant correlation (r = .510, p = .018) to\nobjectively measured cell phone use (minutes) obtained by\naccessing students' actual cell phone records (unpublished\ndata). Thus, this self-report measure was carefully developed\nto assure content validity, while subsequent testing provided\nevidence of construct and criterion validity.\nData Analysis\nAll analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows\n(Version 18.0, SPSS Inc, Evenston, Illinois). First, indepen-\ndent samples t tests were used to examine differences in GPA\nbetween males and females and smokers and nonsmokers.\nLikewise, ANOVA was used to examine differences in GPA\nbetween class (i.e., freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) and\na categorization of students based on the college that houses\ntheir major (i.e., education, health, and human services; arts\nand sciences; business and communications). Second,\nPearson's correlations were performed to examine the rela-\ntionships between the following variables: college GPA,\nSE:SRL, SE:AA, high school GPA, and total cell phone use.\nThird, hierarchical regression was used to answer this study's\ncentral research question:\nLepp et al. 5\nResearch Question 1: What is the relationship between\ntotal cell phone use and academic performance after con-\ntrolling for known predictors? Toward this end, the fol-\nlowing model was initially proposed:\nCollege GPA sex smoker\nclass standing college major\nB\n= , ,\n,\nl\nSE AA Block 2\nSE SRL Block 3\nhigh scho\n( )\n+ ( ) +\n( ) +\n:\n:\no\nol GPA Block 4\ntotal daily cell phone use Block 5\n( )\n+ ( ).\nThe categorical variables of interest were assessed in the\nfirst block of this model: sex, cigarette smoking, class, and\ncollege. Blocks 2 to 4 in this model are identical to the model\ndeveloped by Zimmerman et al. (1992) and supported by\nothers (e.g., Caprara et al., 2011) to predict academic perfor-\nmance. Block 5 added cell phone use to the model and\nthereby tested whether or not daily cell phone use uniquely\npredicted college academic performance (GPA) after con-\ntrolling for these other, previously established variables.\nFinally, to further illustrate the relationship between cell\nphone use and GPA, a tertile split for cell phone use was\nperformed. Students in this final sample (N = 518) were\ndivided into the following groups: low cell phone use group\nANOVA was then utilized to compare mean GPA across the\nthree cell phone use groups (high, moderate, low). Post hoc t\ntests were performed for any significant main effect.\nResults\nAssumption Checking, Descriptive Statistics, and\nPreliminary Analyses\nBefore conducting any descriptive or inferential statistics, an\nexamination of outliers (i.e., cell phone use, GPA, age,\nSE:SRL, SE:AA) was conducted. Following the method of\nRosen et al. (2013), total cell phone use values that were\nmore than 3 standard deviations from the mean were trun-\ncated to exactly 3 standard deviations from the mean. This\nprocedure was applied to measures of total cell phone use for\nseven participants. Outliers on any of the remaining vari-\nables were removed from the study. This procedure resulted\nin 18 cases being removed and yielded a final analysis sam-\nple of 518 students. The age range of the data set was 18 to\nevenly distributed by class (freshmen = 132, sophomores =\n69% of the data set (n = 360), which is greater than the per-\ncentage of females (59%) in the overall undergraduate stu-\ndent body of the University.\nFrom this data set, the assumptions of regression were\nexamined, and a preliminary analysis was performed to\nassess the linearity of the relationship between the study's\nindependent continuous variables (SE:SRL, SE:AA, high\nschool GPA, total cell phone use) and college GPA. Using a\nLack of Fit Test, the assumption of linearity was upheld (p =\n.906). The assumptions of normality and homoskedasticity\nwere also met using residual scatterplots.\nOn average, students reported spending 300 min per day\nusing their cell phones (SD = 243). The sample's mean GPA\nstrated significant differences between males and females\nstrated significant differences in mean GPA between the four\nmajors were categorized into three groups based on the col-\nlege housing the major (education, health, and human ser-\nvices; arts and sciences; business and communications). An\nANOVA found no significant difference in mean GPA\nbetween these three groups (p = .081). Thus, this variable\nwas not included in further analysis.\nTable 1 provides descriptive statistics for the continuous\nvariables used in this model. Table 2 illustrates the results of\nPearson's correlations. There are several significant correla-\ntions worth noting. There was a significant, negative correla-\ntion between cell phone use and college GPA(p < .001). There\nwas a significant, positive correlation between both measures\nof self-efficacy (SE:SRL, SE:AA) and college GPA(p < .001).\nThere was a significant, negative correlation between both\nmeasures of self-efficacy (SE:SRL, SE:AA) and cell phone\nuse (p  .041). Finally, high school GPA was significantly and\npositively correlated with college GPA (p < .001).\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics.\nNote. GPA = grade point average; SE:SRL = self-efficacy for self-regulated\nlearning; SE:AA = self-efficacy for academic achievement.\n6 SAGE Open\nHierarchical Regression\nAs described above, the preliminary analysis supported test-\ning the following hierarchical regression model:\nCollege GPA sex smoker\nclass standing Block 1\n=\n( ) +\n, ,\n: A\nSE SRL Block 3\nhigh school GPA Block 4\n( )\n+ ( ) +\n(\n:\n)\n) +\n( )\ntotal daily cell phone use Block 5 .\nTable 3 provides the model summary results for the hierar-\nchical regression predicting college GPAwith total cell phone\nuse as the final block in the model. Each block significantly\nadded to the prediction of the criterion variable. In Block 1,\nfemales had a significantly greater GPA than males ( = .120,\np = .007), nonsmokers had a significantly higher GPA than\na significant, positive relationship between college GPA and\ncant, positive relationship between college GPA and SE:SRL\ntive relationship between college GPA and high school GPA\n( = .553, p < .001).

There was not a statistically significant difference\nbetween the low use and moderate use groups (p = .175).\nDiscussion\nThis study was exploratory in nature. Therefore, the findings\nare best understood as initial steps into a new line of inquiry.\nThe study's aim was to assess the relationship between cell\nphone use and academic performance after controlling for\nknown predictors of academic performance. A hierarchical\nregression was used for this purpose allowing for the devel-\nopment of a model which used sex, cigarette smoking behav-\nior, class standing, SE:AA, SE:SRL, and high school GPA to\npredict college GPA. Each of these variables were significant\npredictors of college GPA. Females, as has been the recent\ntrend, had higher GPAs than males (Peter & Horn, 2005).\nSmokers, as suggested in previous research, had lower GPAs\nthan nonsmokers (DeBerard et al., 2004; S\u00e1nchez-Mart\u00ednez\n& Otero, 2009). Class was a significant predictor as well,\nwith freshmen and juniors doing slightly better academically\nthan sophomores and seniors in this sample. As expected,\nSE:SRL, SE:AA, and high school GPA were all positively\nassociated with GPA (Zimmerman et al., 1992). Finally, total\ncell phone use (min/day) was added to the end of this regres-\nsion model. After controlling for the previously established\npredictors of academic performance, total cell phone use was\nfound to be a significant negative predictor of GPA. These\nresults suggest that given two college students from the same\nuniversity with the same class standing, same sex, same\nsmoking habits, same belief in their ability to self-regulate\ntheir learning and do well academically, and same high\nschool GPA--the student who uses the cell phone more on a\ndaily basis is likely to have a lower GPAthan the student who\nuses the cell phone less.\nPrevious research suggests that college students' cell\nphone use may be a distraction in academic settings (Levine\net al., 2007). Two previous studies using large random sam-\n(N = 251) of the students surveyed perceived the cell phone\nprimarily as a leisure device rather than as an educational\ncell phone is ever-present and commonly used for leisure, it\nis likely that it occasionally distracts from learning in class,\nin the library, in the dormitories, and in any other setting utilized\nby students for academic purposes. In addition, there is a grow-\ning amount of research that suggests electronic media in any\nform encourages multitasking (Jacobsen & Forste, 2011; Junco\nTable 2. Pearson Correlation Coefficients (r).\nCollege High school\nNote. GPA = grade point average; SE:SRL = self-efficacy for self-regulated\nlearning; SE:AA = self-efficacy for academic achievement.\nTable 3. Hierarchical Regression Predicting College GPA: Model\nSummary.\nSex/class/smoke SE:AA SE:SRL HS GPA CP use\nNote. GPA = grade point average; SE:SRL = self-efficacy for self-regulated\nlearning; SE:AA = self-efficacy for academic achievement; HS = high\nschool; CP = cell phone.\nLepp et al. 7\n(Rosen et al., 2013), both of which are negatively related to\nacademic performance.\nConsidering these explanations, it is likely that the mod-\nern cell phone creates a temptation to surf the Internet, check\nsocial media (e.g., Facebook), play video games, contact\nfriends, explore new applications, or engage with any num-\nber of cell-phone-based leisure activities, which some stu-\ndents fail to resist when they should otherwise be focused on\nacademics. As such, the negative relationship between cell\nphone use and academic performance identified here could\nbe attributed to students' decreased attention while studying\nor a diminished amount of time dedicated to uninterrupted\nstudying. Indeed, a similar argument has been proffered to\nexplain the negative relationship between general social-\nnetworking site use or Facebook use and academic perfor-\nFuture research should examine the many potential underly-\ning reasons for the negative relationship identified here,\nincluding time spent studying and multitasking. Of course,\nthis line of research has demonstrated only relationships and\nnot causality. Thus, there is a need to explore these relation-\nships over time and with experimental designs.\nThere is also a need to better understand how specific cell\nphone uses are related to academic performance. While this\nstudy found that cell phone use as a whole was negatively\nassociated with academic performance, the relationship may\nvary with particular uses. In other words, contrary to the\nfindings presented here, there may be specific uses that are\npositively related to academic performance. For example,\nNorris (1996) found that while TV watching as a whole was\nnegatively associated with political participation, watching\nTV news and public affairs programming was positively\nassociated with political participation. Likewise, Chen and\nTzeng (2010) found that using the Internet for information\nseeking was associated with better academic performance,\nwhile using the Internet for video game playing was associ-\nated with lower levels of academic performance. Finally,\nJunco (2012a) found that the total amount of time college\nstudents spend on Facebook, as well as the total number of\ntimes students check Facebook, were negatively associated\nwith campus engagement. However, some Facebook activi-\nties such as creating events and RSVPing for events were\npositively associated with campus engagement. Thus, assess-\ning cell phone use as a whole is likely to provide only a par-\ntial understanding of an undoubtedly complex relationship.\nAdditional research assessing time devoted to specific cell\nphone uses such as gaming, social networking, information\nsearch, and the use of educational software (apps) is needed.\nWhile these findings build upon and extend previous\nresearch in this area, there are limitations. First, cell phone\nuse was self-reported. Although the self-report measure used\nin this study was carefully developed to assure content valid-\nity and a subsequent test provided evidence of criterion\nvalidity, research by Boase and Ling (2013) illustrates that\ncontinuous, open-ended self-report cell phone measures are\nat risk of over reporting use. In lieu of objective data, future\nstudies may seek to further validate this measure.\nFurthermore, future studies should assess the time devoted to\ncommon specific uses such as social networking, gaming,\nand information search, in addition to measuring overall use\nas was done here. Second, the sample consisted of under-\ngraduate college students from a single, large, public univer-\nsity in the Midwestern United States.Although the behavioral\nnorms governing cell phone use appear to be consistent\namong today's college students (Anderson & Rainie, 2011;\nTindell & Bohlander, 2012), attempts to generalize these\nresults to other populations should be made with caution.\nTherefore, future research should include college students\nfrom different types of universities and from different geo-\ngraphic regions. In addition, high school and junior high\nschool students should be studied as recent research suggests\nthat the relationships identified here may be evident in\nyounger students as well (Rosen et al., 2013).\nConclusion\nThis research utilized a more holistic measure of cell phone\nuse than previous studies. The measure accounts for the cell\nphone's expanded capabilities in the realm of social network-\ning, gaming, and Internet use. After controlling for SE:SRL,\nSE:AA, and other important predictors such as actual high\nschool GPA, this measure of cell phone use was a significant\nand negative predictor of college students' academic perfor-\nmance, objectively measured as cumulative GPA. Presently,\ncell phone use is a dominant and defining characteristic of\nthis generation of college students and often occurs during\nclass time, while completing homework, and while studying\nTherefore, more research is needed to better understand the\nmechanisms underlying this relationship. Even so, educators\nand administrators in higher education may wish to carefully\nconsider policies regarding cell phone use in the classroom,\nlaboratories, and other settings where learning occurs.\nUndoubtedly, the capability of the cell phone to entertain,\nconnect, and inform will continue its rapid development. As\nsuch, cell phones and related devices will only increase in\npopularity and use. Therefore, there is a need to better under-\nstand how this technology can be harnessed to make a genu-\nine contribution to student learning. We may discover\nconditions where learning is enhanced by having the cell\nphone on; likewise, we may discover conditions where learn-\ning is enhanced by having it off.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\n8 SAGE Open\nReferences\nAl-Harthy, I.
