This pattern of resource allocation is what would be expected\ngiven Hamilton's (1964) inclusive fitness theory. In a similar study, Judge and Hrdy\nHamilton (1964) and demonstrated by Smith et al. (1987): On average, benefactors\ngave a greater percentage of their estates to kin of closer genetic relatedness than\nmore distantly related kin and non-kin.\nAccording to inclusive fitness theory, factors such as genetic relatedness and\ndifferential fertility (which is related to sex and age) should explain the majority of\nvariation in inheritances within families (Hamilton, 1964; Judge and Hrdy, 1992;\nHuman Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage\nSmith et al., 1987). However, genetic relatives can be further divided into two distinct\ncategories based on whether or not they share a direct lineage to the benefactor or\ntarget individual. Relatives of a direct lineage are those who are direct descendents or\nprogenitors of the target individual (e.g., grandparents, parents, children,\ngrandchildren), whereas peripheral relatives refer to those who are genetically related\nto the target, but are neither direct descendents nor progenitors of the target (e.g.,\nsiblings, aunts/uncles, nieces/nephews, cousins).\nAlthough inclusive fitness theory would predict that resources would be\nallocated equally among kin of the same genetic relatedness, sex, and age, previous\ninvestigations of wills (e.g., Smith et al., 1987) suggest that the genetic relatedness\neffect is stronger among relatives of direct lineage than it is for peripheral relatives\n(see Figure 1). Although Smith et al. (1987) did not consider lineage differences as an\nindependent variable, the pattern of estate allocations observed in their archival\nanalysis of wills is suggestive of a substantial genetic relatedness by lineage\ninteraction. Why should the genetic relatedness effect be stronger for direct lineages\nthan it is for peripheral lineages? There are at least four possible explanations.\nFigure 1: Mean percentages of estates allocated to relatives as a function of genetic\nrelatedness and lineage in archival analyses of wills. Adapted from Smith, Kish, and\nCrawford (1987) with permission from Elsevier Science.\nGenetic relatedness to participant\nMean percent of estate allocated\nDirect lineage\nPeripheral\nHuman Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage\nFirst, age differences, which were not statistically controlled in Smith et al.'s\ndata, could be driving the interaction, since relatives of equal genetic relatedness--\nbut different lineages--typically differ in age (e.g., daughters vs. sisters,\ngranddaughters vs. nieces). Since age is inversely related to fertility, age differences\ncould partially account for the pattern of means in Figure 1.\nSecond, there are strong cultural and historical norms that may influence\npeople's inheritance decisions. Although there is substantial amount of variability in\ninheritances of titles and property within and between cultures over time (Cooper,\nWestern cultures, people tend to will a larger percentage of their estates to their direct\ndescendants than to their peripheral relatives.\nThird, it is possible that favoritism toward relatives of direct lineage results\nfrom differences in bonding and competition early in development. For example,\nperhaps the parent-child and child-parent patterns of attachment are stronger than\nsibling-sibling attachment patterns (Bowlby, 1969). It is also possible that parent-\noffspring conflict is more subdued than sibling-sibling conflict when children\ncompete for limited resources (Trivers, 1974).\nFourth, the genetic relatedness by lineage interaction may be associated with\nindividuals' perceptions of relatedness uncertainty. For example, the certainty that a\nchild is one's own may be greater than the certainty that one's sibling is a full or half\nsibling (particularly among females who are can be certain that their child is their\nown). For instance, equating relatives on age and sex, it would be more conservative\nfor a woman to invest in two of her children than it would be to invest in her two\nsiblings, given that she cannot be entirely certain if her siblings are full or half\nsiblings, due to paternal uncertainty. Given this fact, over evolutionary time, a\nresource sharing preference that favored relatives of direct lineage could be beneficial\nin the context of an individual's inclusive fitness.\nOverview of the Present Studies\nThe purpose of the present studies was to assess the strength of the genetic\nrelatedness by lineage interaction using a survey method (Study 1), to replicate this\neffect in a subsequent survey study (Study 2), and to observe this effect in actual\ninheritances (Study 3). In Studies 1 and 2, college students were asked to allocate\nvarious fictional lotteries to as many genetic relatives as they wished. In Study 3, the\ninheritance patterns in a sample of archived wills were analyzed, taking into account\ndifferences in lineage between benefactors and their beneficiaries. Across all studies,\nit was predicted that the effect relatives' genetic relatedness on resource allocations\nwould depend on relatives' lineage to the target individual, such that the genetic\nrelatedness effect would be more positive for relatives of direct lineage to the target\nthan it would be for peripheral relatives.\nHuman Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage\nStudy 1: Exploration\nMethod\nParticipants. Participants were 133 students (57% males) enrolled in an\nintroductory psychology course at a southern state university and received course\ncredit in return for their participation. This sample originally consisted of 147\nstudents. The 14 excluded participants were nine who failed to list the ages of any of\ntheir relatives, four who allocated their entire lotteries to a single relative, and one\nwho indicated that he or she was adopted.\nMaterials and Procedure. Participants were instructed to allocate a fictional\nlottery prize of varying dollar amounts to their blood relatives. Each participant was\nor US$1,000,000. Participants were instructed to imagine that they had won one of\nthe three lottery amounts, but that only their blood relatives would be allowed to keep\nthe prize money. Thus, participants were asked to allocate the entire lottery to as\nmany (or as few) relatives as they saw fit, and were allowed to allocate any amount\nthey desired to each relative, so long as the entire lottery was allocated across the set\nof relatives they chose to list. Participants were asked specifically to list blood\nrelatives (i.e., no step-parents or in-laws). The back side of the instructions served as\nthe response sheet, where participants were asked to list each relative's (a) specific\nrelation to them (e.g., \"father's sister\" instead of \"aunt,\"), (b) sex (if not obvious), (c)\nage in years (or approximate age if unknown), (d) allocated lottery amount in dollars.\nFollowing these procedures, students were debriefed on the purpose of the research\nand thanked for their participation.\nData Analysis. Preliminary analyses within each of the present three studies\nrevealed evidence of neither a sex-of-relative difference in allocations nor a sex-of-\nparticipant difference in any of the effects of interest (ps > .06). In other words,\nparticipant sex moderated neither the main effects of genetic relatedness or lineage,\nnor their interaction. Thus, all subsequent analyses were run collapsing across male\nand female relatives and participants.\nThe data obtained from all three studies yielded a hierarchically nested data\nstructure, with relatives nested within families. Whereas previous studies have\nignored problems with statistical dependency in using relatives as the sole unit of\nanalysis (e.g., Smith et al., 1987), the present data were modeled using a more\nappropriate mixed model in the form of a multilevel random coefficient model\n(MRCM) in the context of the program Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM, Version\n5; Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, and Congdon, 2000). This procedure involved\nperforming within-participant regressions and then modeling the resulting within-\nparticipant regression coefficients as a function of between-participant variables. In\nMRCM terms, this involved modeling within-participant (or within-family) variance\nat Level 1 and between-participant (or between-family) variance at Level 2 (see\nHuman Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage\nFor the present data, within-participant regression coefficients were estimated\npredicting percent of money allocated from each relative's genetic relatedness,\nlineage, and their interaction, controlling for relative's age. Thus, the design of the\nwithin-person model was the regression analog of a 2 (genetic relatedness: r = .25 vs.\nr = .50)  2 (lineage: direct vs. peripheral) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with\nrelative's age in years (mean-deviated at the within-person level) as a covariate:\n(AGE)ij\n+\n+ rij\n.\nIn this model, PERCENTij\nrepresents the percent of the lottery money allocated by\nparticipant j to relative i and 0j\nis the random coefficient representing the mean\nPercent for family j across i relatives for which the participant listed. The coefficients\nthrough 4j\nrepresent within-person slopes (or difference scores). The variance of\nrij\nis the within-person error variance.\nMultilevel models allow for regression coefficients from one level of analysis\n(Level 1) to be modeled at another level (Level 2). For these data, this meant that the\nwithin-participant (or within-family) relationships were modeled as functions of\nbetween-participant (or between-family) variables. At level 2, the resulting within-\nparticipant regression coefficients from Level 1 were modeled as s function of\nbetween-participant differences in lottery amount (or estate amounts in Study 3).\nThus, for Study 1, the Level-2 design for the between-participant model was the\nregression analog of a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), which compared the\ntwo polynomial effects codes for the three lottery amounts:\n.\nIn the between-family model, 0j\nthrough 4j\nrepresent the within-person\nintercepts and slopes, respectively. The .0\ns represent the means of their respective\nwithin-person regression coefficients, controlling for the aforementioned between-\nperson effects. These are the effects that are of particular interest in the present\nresearch. For example, the strength of the 40\ncoefficient addresses the central\nquestion, \"Does the effect of genetic relatedness on lottery allocations depend on\ndifferences in relatives' lineage on average across families, controlling for age\ndifferences between relatives and controlling differences in lottery amount between\nparticipants?\" Lastly, the u.j\ns represent the errors of their respective .j\ns, and their\nvariances are the family-level error variances.\nHuman Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage\nResults and Discussion\nThe effect of genetic relatedness was a strong and reliable predictor of percent\nof money allocated, with first-order relatives receiving substantially more of the\nlottery than second-order relatives (see Table 1, left columns, for regression\nstatistics). Lineage was also a strong predictor, with direct lineage relatives receiving\na greater share of the lottery than peripheral relatives. However, these main effects\nwere qualified by a reliable relatedness by lineage interaction, such that the genetic\nrelatedness effect on percent of money allocated was stronger and more positive\namong relatives of direct lineage than it was among peripheral relatives (see Figure\n2). Note that the predicted mean percentages of resources allocated in the figures do\nnot sum to 100%. This is because (a) allocations made to distal relatives (e.g., r =\n.125) were excluded from analyses because there was no linage variation (i.e., none\nwere of direct lineage) and (b) the mean percentages represent within-family means\nthat were subsequently averaged across families. Simple effects within the context of\nthis interaction revealed that the genetic relatedness slopes within relatives of direct\nlineage and within peripheral relatives were each significantly greater than zero (ps <\n.01). Lastly, none of the within-participant slopes were moderated by the between-\nparticipant lottery differences (ps > .10).\nGenetic relatedness to participant\nMean percent of lottery allocated\nDirect lineage Peripheral\nFigure 2: Predicted mean percentages of money allocated to relatives within families\nfor Study 1 as a function of genetic relatedness, lineage, controlling for relatives' ages\nand lottery differences.\nHuman Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage\nThese results supported the main hypotheses: The relatedness effect was\nstronger for relatives of direct lineage than it was for peripheral relatives, even when\nage of relative (which is related to reproductive potential) was statistically held\nconstant. The pattern of means observed in the present study was similar to the\npattern reported in previous archival analyses of inheritances (e.g., Smith et al.,\n1987). This result suggested that the resource sharing patterns reported by younger\nstudents were similar to the inheritances specified by older adults in their wills.\nPercent of Money Allocated to Relatives within Families as a Function of Their Age,\nGenetic Relatedness, and Lineage, Controlling for Amount of Available Money\nCoef. t Coef. t Coef. t\naIn Studies 1 and 2, Age was age in years of relative.

To see if these effects were replicable, a second study was conducted\nusing an independent sample of students at a different university. Furthermore, if\ntheses effects were as robust as Study 1 had suggested, they should be replicable in a\nsmall sample.\nHuman Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage\nMethod\nParticipants. Participants were 28 students (39% males) enrolled in an upper-\nlevel psychology course at a western state university and received no compensation\nfor their participation.

The three\nexcluded participants were two who indicated that they were adopted and one whose\nregression residual constituted a statistical outlier relative to the rest of the sample.\nMaterials and Procedure.

The model employed in Study 2 was identical to that\nemployed in Study 1, but with one exception: Only a single contrast-coded variable\nwas necessary to model differences in lottery amounts, as this variable had only two\nlevels in Study 2, whereas this variable had an additional level in Study 1 (i.e.,\nResults and Discussion\nThe results of Study 2 replicated those of Study 1 (see Table 1, middle\ncolumns). Once again, first-order relatives received a greater share of the lottery than\nsecond-order relatives. Replicating the lineage effect, relatives of direct lineage to the\ntarget were allotted greater amounts of money than peripheral relatives. Moreover,\nthe relatedness by lineage interaction was replicated in the same direction as Study 1,\nwith the genetic relatedness effect being a stronger and more positive predictor\namong relatives of direct lineage than it was among peripheral relatives (see Figure\n3). Simple effects in the context of this interaction revealed that the genetic\nrelatedness slope was significantly different from zero for direct lineage relatives (p <\n.01), but not for peripheral relatives (p > .50). None of the within-participant effects\nwere reliably moderated by between-participant differences in lottery amounts (ps >\nStudy 3: Application\nAlthough Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated the moderating effect of lineage\ndifferences on the relationship between genetic relatedness and lottery allocation\nwithin families, they lacked ecological validity. Specifically, it was not clear whether\nyounger students allocating fictional prize money accurately reflected how older\npeople might actually distribute their estates in wills. To this end, an archival analysis\nof probated wills was undertaken to support the findings of Studies 1 and 2, and to\nreplicate the patterns of means found in previous archival research (e.g., Smith et al.\nHuman Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage\nGenetic relatedness to participant\nMean percent of lottery allocated\nDirect lineage Peripheral\nFigure 3: Predicted mean percentages of money allocated to relatives within families\nfor Study 2 as a function of genetic relatedness, lineage, controlling for relatives' ages\nand lottery differences.\nMethod\nSample and Procedure. The analyzed sample consisted of the wills of 74\npeople (62% males) probated in British Columbia in 1954. This sample originally\nconsisted of 191 records. The 117 excluded cases were 67 persons who died intestate,\n39 who listed no blood relatives, six whose estates amounted to less than Can$1, four\nwhose estates were not quantifiable into dollar amounts, and one whose estate\nby randomly selecting two adjacent microfilm rolls from a randomly selected file\ncabinet. Wills were obtained from the British Columbia Archives in Victoria and\nselected by the order in which they were probated on two microfilm rolls. This\npopulation and sampling method were similar to those used by Smith et al. (1987).\nextreme positive skew of the distribution of estate amounts, and to make these\namounts comparable to those of Studies 1 and 2, a log10\ntransformation was\nperformed. The mean log-transformed estate value was 3.92 (SD = 0.53).\nData Analysis. A MRCM was employed, with related beneficiaries nested\nwithin families (or target individuals). The Level-1 model was identical to those\nHuman Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage\npresented in Studies 1 and 2, with one exception: Because the actual ages of relatives\nwere not available, ages were estimated by determining what generation the relatives\nwere relative to the target. For example, a mother, sister, daughter, and granddaughter\nwere considered first, second, third, and fourth generation, respectively. These\ngenerational distinctions were given a linear coding to reflect categorical age\ndifferences (i.e., 3, 1, \u00ad1, and \u00ad3, respectively). At level 2, log estate amounts were\nentered as a predictor of the resulting within-family (Level 1) regression coefficients.\nResults and Discussion\nNeither a reliable genetic relatedness difference nor a lineage difference was\ndetected in these data (see Table 1, right columns). However, a reliable genetic\nrelatedness by lineage interaction did emerge (see Figure 4).\nGenetic relatedness to participant\nMean percent of estate allocated\nDirect lineage Peripheral\nFigure 4: Predicted mean percentages of estates allocated to relatives within families\nas a function of genetic relatedness, lineage, controlling for relatives' generational\nages and estate amount differences.\nThis interaction was in the same direction as Studies 1 and 2 and in the\ndirection suggested--but not tested--by previous researchers (e.g., Smith et al.\n1987). Tests of simple effects in the context of this interaction indicated that neither\nthe positive genetic relatedness slope within relatives of direct lineage (p = .15) nor\nHuman Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage\nthe negative genetic relatedness slope within peripheral relatives (p = .29) differed\nsignificantly from zero. None of the within-family effects were moderated by\nbetween-person differences in the log estate amounts (ps > .50).\nThese results from the archived wills suggested that the genetic relatedness by\nlineage interaction was as reliable in real inheritances as it was across two survey\nstudies using college students. Once again, the effect of genetic relatedness on\nresource allocations was dependent on the lineage of the relative in question.\nSpecifically, the simple relationship between genetic relatedness and allocations of\nestate amounts was significantly more positive among relatives of a direct lineage\nthan it was among peripheral relatives.\nGeneral Discussion\nAcross two surveys and an archival analysis, the predicted pattern was\nsupported: the extent to which people allocated their resources to kin as a function of\ntheir common genes was more positive for relatives of a direct lineage than for other\nrelatives. Across the three studies presented here, this interaction was robust--even\nwhen statistically controlling for differences in relatives' ages and differences in\namounts of resources to be allocated. This interaction suggests that accounting for\ndifferences in relatives' lineages is important to understanding resources sharing\nwithin families.\nAlthough these studies were the first to statistically demonstrate the genetic\nrelatedness by lineage interaction in inheritances, they do not explain the mechanism\nbehind this interaction. In the introduction, four possible explanations were given: (a)\nage-of-relative differences, (b) cultural norms, (c) sibling-sibling competition is\nstronger than parent-child competition, and (d) relatedness uncertainty. The only\nexplanation that the present research rules out is that of relatives' age differences,\nwhich were controlled in all analyses. As for cultural norms, the present research is\nonly generalizable to upper-middle class North Americans, typically of European\ndescent. To evaluate the roll culture plays in the strength of the genetic relatedness by\nlineage interaction, other cultures--particularly non-Western ones--will need to be\ninvestigated.\nTo assess the possibility that differences in within-family competition for\nresources could be driving the observed interaction, future research could measure\nvariables relating to sibling-sibling closeness, amount of overlap in years of\ncohabitation, and socio-economic status of the family. If differences in within-family\ncompetition are indeed driving the genetic relatedness by lineage interaction, one\nwould expect the interaction to be stronger as measures of sibling-sibling competition\nfor resources increase.\nIt is also possible that the genetic relatedness by lineage interaction is related\nto differences in genetic relatedness stemming from paternal uncertainty within\nfamilies. Women (but not necessarily men) can be certain that their offspring is\nindeed their own. Because of paternal uncertainty, however, neither men nor women\nHuman Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage\ncan be certain that their brothers and sisters are full or half siblings. Thus, over\nevolutionary time, individuals who invested more resources in relatives of greater\ncertainty (i.e., direct lineages) than relatives of lesser certainty (i.e., peripheral\nlineages), were more likely to pass on more of their common genes to future\ngenerations, thus perpetuating favoritism towards direct descendants.\nLimitations and Implications\nOne possible limitation of these studies is the ecological validity of having\ncollege students allocate fictional lotteries to their relatives in Studies 1 and 2.\nSpecifically, it was not clear if using a survey method with younger participants\nwould accurately reflect the allocation patterns employed by older people when\nwriting their wills. However, the results of an archival analysis of actual inheritance\npatterns in Study 3 replicated the pattern of findings present in the first two studies. In\naddition, the three studies presented here reflect the results of previous archival\nMoreover, this survey method has been used successfully to investigate other kin\ninvestment issues in a related study (cf. Webster, 2003). Thus, it appears that younger\npeople faced with a resource allocation task allocate resources to their kin in much\nthe same way that older people do when they create wills. Although survey methods\nare no substitute archival analyses of inheritances, the similarity of the results across\nthe three studies presented here show convergent validity between the survey and\narchival methods. Thus, the use multiple methods to assess patterns of kin investment\nshould be encouraged in future investigations.\nA second possible limitation of the present research is the lack of replication\nof the genetic relatedness and lineage main effects in Study 3. There are at least two\nfactors contributing to these null effects. First, the sample size in Study 3 (N = 74)\nwas small in comparison to previous analyses of archived wills (Ns > 1,000), which\nresulted in relatively low statistical power to detect effects. Second, real-world data\n(e.g., archival and field data) are notoriously noisier (i.e., containing more sources of\nerror variance) than data collected in controlled environments (e.g., in classrooms and\nlaboratories; McClelland and Judd, 1993). Thus, it is not unusual for archival studies\nto show weaker effects than survey studies.\nThe results of these studies indicate that differences in relative's lineages to a\ngiven target should be accounted for in studies of human kin investment or altruism.\nNot only were relatives of a direct lineage favored over other relatives in the two\nsurvey studies, but also this effect determined the extent to which genetic relatedness\nwas associated with resource allocation in an analysis of archived wills. Because the\nsimple relationship between genetic relatedness and resource allocation depends on\nthe lineage of the relative in question, future research should make distinctions\nbetween relatives of direct and peripheral lineages.\nHuman Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage\n"
