Although ACE2 is reported to localize in renal glo-\nmeruli and tubules,3\u00ad6 the differences in ACE2 expression\nwithin the kidney seem to be not only tissue-specific but\nalso cell-specific.6\u00ad9 Glomerular expression of ACE2 is\nreduced in diabetic mice,6 and reduced ACE2 gene and\nprotein expression has been confirmed in renal biopsies of\npatients with type 2 diabetes.7 On the other hand, at the\ntubular level, increased ACE2 activity and protein expres-\nsion have been found in diabetic mice.8,9 The renal RAS,\nspecifically Ang II, plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis\nof diabetic nephropathy.10 Ang II and ACE are activated in\ntype 2 diabetes11 and are involved in the development of\nmicrovascular and macrovascular complications of diabe-\ntes such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular\ndisease.12 ACE 2 plays an integral role in protecting against\nUrinary angiotensin-converting enzyme\n2 increases in diabetic nephropathy by\nangiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker\nolmesartan\nMasanori Abe1, Osamu Oikawa1, Kazuyoshi Okada1 and\n Keywords\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme 2, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, chronic kidney disease, diabetic nephropathy,\nolmesartan\nDivision of Nephrology, Hypertension and Endocrinology, Department\nof Internal Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan\nDivision of General Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Nihon\nUniversity School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan\nCorresponding author:\nMasanori Abe, Division of Nephrology, Hypertension and\nEndocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Nihon University\nSchool of Medicine, 30-1, Oyaguchi Kami-chou, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo\nEmail: abe.masanori@nihon-u.ac.jp\nOriginal Article\n160 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)\nrenal damage and cardiovascular disease.8,13 It was reported\nthat deletion of ACE2 leads to the development of Ang\nII-dependent renal damage, suggesting ACE2 as a renopro-\ntective target in diabetes.14 ACE2 is a homologue of ACE\nbut is not blocked byACE inhibitors. However, there are no\nclinical data showing whether Ang II type 1 receptor block-\ners (ARB) increase ACE2 activity. In this study, we evalu-\nated the changes in urinary ACE2 levels resulting from\nARB treatment in diabetes patients with chronic kidney\ndisease (CKD).\nResearch design and methods\nThis prospective, open-label, interventional study was\nconducted with 31 outpatients after obtaining written\ninformed consent and with the approval of the local eth-\nics committee. The study was performed in accordance\nwith the Declaration of Helsinki. Enrollment criteria\nwere as follows: 1) type 2 diabetes with nephropathy\nunder stable glycemic control, defined as a hemoglobin\nA1c (HbA1c) level <8.0% after administration of oral\nantidiabetic agents, insulin injection therapy, or diet ther-\napy alone for 8 consecutive weeks; 2) albuminuria: uri-\nnary albumin/creatinine (Cr) ratio >30 mg/g (average of\ntwo consecutive measurements recorded during the\n8-week pre-treatment period); 3) estimated glomerular\nhypertension: systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP)\n130/80 mmHg treated with a fixed dose of antihyperten-\nsive agents other than RAS inhibitors for at least 8 weeks\nbefore the study. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1)\nage <20 years or >80 years; 2) more than second-degree\nheart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, or stroke\noccurring within 6 months before the trial; and 5) previ-\nous treatment with ARB for at least 8 weeks before the\nstudy.\nAfter initial evaluation, patients received 20 mg/day\nolmesartan, which was increased to 40 mg/day over a\n24-week period. Doses of other antihypertensive agents\nand statins were maintained during the study. BP measure-\nments were performed at the outpatient clinic according to\nJapanese Society of Hypertension (JSH) 2009 guidelines\nat fixed times after the administration of medications.15\nTarget BP was <130/80 mmHg. Measurements were made\nusing a sphygmomanometer (Nippon Colin Co. Ltd,\nTokyo, Japan) and performed twice with the patient seated\nafter a 5-min rest.\nAt each patient visit, safety variables and patient com-\npliance with treatment regimens were assessed. Plasma\nrenin activity and aldosterone concentrations were meas-\nured by radioimmunoassay at a contract laboratory (SRL,\nInc., Tokyo, Japan) at baseline and at week 24 with the\npatient in the supine position after a 20-min rest. Urinary\nalbumin excretion was assessed by measuring urinary con-\ncentrations of albumin and Cr (albumin/Cr ratio) in the first\nmorning urine sample. Urinary albumin levels were meas-\nured by the immunoturbidimetric assay. Urinary liver-type\nfatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) was measured in the\nsame urine sample by a specific enzyme linked immuno-\nsorbent assay (ELISA; SRL, Inc.), and the results were\nexpressed relative to the urinary Cr concentration. Urinary\nACE2 concentration was measured at baseline and at week\n24 by ELISA (Human ACE2 ELISA Kit, AdipoGen, Inc.,\nSeoul, Korea) as described previously.16,17 The eGFR was\ncalculated according to the following formula for Japanese\nData are expressed as means \u00b1 SEM. Changes in bio-\nchemical and urinalysis parameters were analyzed using\nthe paired t-test. The relationships between variables were\nanalyzed using Pearson's correlation. Determinants of the\nfactors associated with the changes in urinary ACE2 levels\nwere assessed using multivariable linear regression. Age,\nsex, body mass index, changes in systolic and diastolic BP,\nurinary albumin/Cr ratio, and levels of eGFR, plasma glu-\ncose, HbA1c, plasma aldosterone, and urinary L-FABP\nwere selected for the multivariate model.

The final olmesartan dose was\n26 \u00b1 2 mg/day. As shown in Table 2, olmesartan treat-\nment significantly decreased both systolic and diastolic\nBP values. No significant differences were seen in serum\nCr levels or eGFR values during the study period.\nFurthermore, urinary L-FABP level was significantly\ndecreased after olmesartan treatment. Figure 1 shows\nthat the urinary albumin/Cr ratio was significantly\ngCr at baseline to 317 \u00b1 91 mg/gCr at the end of the\nstudy (p < 0.01), whereas urinary ACE2 concentration\nwas significantly increased from 27.8 \u00b1 4.6 ng/mgCr at\nbaseline to 42.9 \u00b1 7.0 ng/mgCr at the end of the study\n(p < 0.05). Figure 2 shows that plasma renin activity\nwas not significantly changed after 24 weeks of\ntreatment, but plasma aldosterone levels were decreased\nIn a simple regression analysis, changes in urinary\nACE2 levels correlated significantly with changes in uri-\nsystolic and diastolic BP, urinary albumin/Cr ratio, or\neGFR levels (Table 3).

Furthermore, uri-\nnary ACE2 levels in patients treated with olmesartan for\n>1 year were higher than in healthy controls, although\nother antihypertensive drugs, including calcium channel\nblockers and other RAS inhibitors, had no such effects on\nurinary ACE2 levels in an observational study.33 However,\nthe urine samples for ACE2 determination were collected\nonly once, and thus the extent of changes in ACE2 levels\ndue to antihypertensive agents could not be critically\nassessed. Taken together, no interventional studies have\nexamined whether ARBs can definitely increase ACE2\nactivity in humans. Here, we demonstrated that the ARB\nolmesartan can increase urinary ACE2 levels and decrease\nplasma aldosterone levels in diabetic nephropathy patients\nwith CKD. Many functional differences exist among\nARBs that are not mediated by Ang II type 1 receptor\nFigure 2.

However, the changes in urinary ACE2 levels cor-\nrelated significantly with urinary L-FABP levels in the\npresent study. Significant urinary ACE2 levels most likely\nreflect the state of the proximal tubules, and differences\nmay exist in patients with CKD and tubular injury com-\npared with healthy individuals.41 In patients with diabetic\nnephropathy, the development of progressive diabetic\nkidney disease was associated with changes in proximal\ntubules, renal function, and prognosis and showed a\nhigher correlation with structural lesions in the tubuloint-\nerstitium than with glomerular changes.42 Various proxi-\nmal tubule pathophysiological stresses, such as\nproteinuria, induce upregulation of human L-FABP gene\nexpression, thereby resulting in increased proximal tubu-\nlar L-FABP excretion and increased urinary L-FABP\nexcretion.43 Urinary L-FABP is an important marker of\ntubulointerstitial changes in diabetic nephropathy, while\noxidative stress is a pathogenic factor underlying diabetic\ncomplications such as nephropathy.44\u00ad46 Because multi-\nvariate regression analysis showed that urinary L-FABP is\nan independent variable significantly associated with\nurinary ACE2 levels, olmesartan may have potential\nagainst the progression of tubulointerstitial damage due to\nincreased urinary ACE2 levels. Nevertheless, further\nstudies are needed to identify the factors associated with\nthe increase in ACE2 levels, as ACE2 has the potential to\nbe a marker of renal RAS activation in these patients.\nOur study design was limited by the small sample size,\nshort treatment duration, and lack of a control group since it\nwas a preliminary investigation. Furthermore, we did not\nmeasure plasma levels of Ang-(1-7), Ang II, and ACE2, or\nurinary ACE2 activity, in this study, and thus the changes in\nACE2 activity and their impact on the RAS may not have\nbeen fully characterized. Additional long-term studies are\nneeded to accurately assess the renoprotective effects of\nolmesartan therapy in diabetes patients. Moreover, it should\nbe clarified whether ARBs other than olmesartan have the\nsame potential to increase urinary ACE2 levels.\nIn conclusion, olmesartan treatment leads to a reduction\nin albuminuria, urinary L-FABP, and plasma aldosterone\nlevels in diabetes patients with CKD; however, it may have\nthe unique effect of increasing urinary ACE2 levels. Some\nprevious studies in mice and humans have shown that other\nRAS blockers do not increase urinaryACE2 levels. Whether\nthis unique increase contributes to olmesartan's renoprotec-\ntive effect must be examined further in a future study.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
