Among current smokers, perceived risks were ana-\nlyzed by demographic and clinical factors using logistic regression.\nResults Only 29% and 40% of current smokers believed they have a higher-than-\naverage risk of MI or cancer, respectively, and only 39% and 49% of heavy smokers\n(40 cigarettes per day) acknowledged these risks. Even among smokers with hyper-\ntension, angina, or a family history of MI, 48%, 49%, and 39%, respectively, per-\nceived their risk of MI as higher than average. In multivariate analyses, older (65\nyears), less educated ( high school graduate), and light smokers (1-19 cigarettes per\nday) were less likely than younger, more educated, and heavy smokers to perceive an\nincreased personal risk of MI or cancer.\nConclusions Most smokers do not view themselves at increased risk of heart dis-\nease or cancer. As part of multifaceted approaches to smoking cessation, physicians\nand public health professionals should identify and educate smokers who are not aware\nof smoking-related health risks.\nlate poststratification weights so our\ncohort who completed both the tele-\nphone interview and written question-\nnaire approximates the distribution of US\nropolitan area, sex, race, age, educa-\ntion, and marital status.\nCharacteristics of current smokers,\nformer smokers, and nonsmokers were\ncompared using analysis of variance for\nage and the Pearson x2 test for other vari-\nables. These other variables included sex,\nrace, education, marital status, geo-\ngraphic region, having a regular physi-\ncian, receiving a checkup in the past year,\nhistory of MI in a parent or sibling, hy-\npertension, angina, overall physical and\nmental health, control over life, and sat-\nisfaction with life. In a multivariate analy-\nsis of current smokers that adjusted for\nthese variables, we used logistic regres-\nsion to assess the relative odds of per-\nceiving higher-than-average risks of MI\nand cancer. SUDAAN statistical soft-\nware (Research Triangle Institute, Re-\nsearch Triangle Park, NC) was used to\ncalculate SEs with the complex sam-\npling design.\nRESULTS\ntelephone and self-administered sur-\nreported in the 1994 National Health In-\nterview Survey5) were current smokers\nCurrent smokers were younger and in-\ncluded a higher proportion of women\nthan former smokers and were younger\nand included a higher proportion of men\nthan nonsmokers (TABLE 1).

Cur-\nrent smokers were less likely to have a\nregular physician or have had a checkup\nin the past year, despite reporting worse\nphysical and mental health.

Among\nheavier smokers (40 cigarettes per day),\nceived themselves at increased personal\nrisk of heart disease or cancer. Among\nsmokers who also had hypertension,\nsymptomatic angina, or a family history\nof MI, fewer than half perceived their risk\nand 39%, respectively).\nIn multivariate analyses (TABLE 2),\nsmokers older than 64 years were less\nlikely than younger smokers to per-\nceive their risk of MI as higher than av-\nerage. Smokers older than 44 years and\nthose who had not graduated from high\nschool were less likely than younger\nsmokers and college graduates, respec-\ntively, to perceive an increased per-\nsonal risk of cancer. Heavier smokers\nwere more likely than lighter smokers to\nperceive an increased risk of MI and can-\ncer, and smokers who reported fair or\npoor mental health were more likely to\nreport an increased risk of cancer. Smok-\ners' risk perceptions did not differ sig-\nnificantly by sex, race, marital status, geo-\ngraphic region, access to a regular\nphysician, or receipt of a checkup in the\nprior year.\nCOMMENT\nDespite past efforts to educate smokers\nabout their health risks, our nationally\nrepresentative study demonstrates that\nmost smokers--even heavy smokers and\nthose with other cardiac risk fac-\ntors--do not perceive themselves at in-\ncreased risk of experiencing an MI or de-\nveloping cancer. Consistent with prior\nstudies of less-representative cohorts,\nmany smokers continue to deny their\nThus, as a foundation for smoking ces-\nsation efforts, physicians and health edu-\ncators should assess smokers' risk per-\nceptions and provide more intensive\ncounseling to those who underestimate\ntheir personal health risks,21,22 particu-\nlarly older and less-educated smokers. Al-\nthough physician counseling remains a\ncost-effective method to promote smok-\ning cessation,23,24 alternate strategies will\nbe needed to help smokers who have\ngreater difficulty quitting and motivate\nthe one third of smokers who do not have\naccess to a regular physician.\nIn interpreting our findings, we note\n4 other points. First, questions about\nhealth risks were asked separately from\nquestions about smoking, so responses\nrepresentoverallrisksofheartdiseaseand\ncancer rather than risks attributable solely\nto smoking. Second, we assessed the risk\nof cancer in general rather than specific\ntypes of cancer. Third, although most\nsmokers are at increased risk of heart dis-\nease and cancer, some smokers may have\na lower relative risk based on their fam-\nily history, diet, or physical activity.\nFourth, future studies should compare\nthe accuracy of smokers' relative and ab-\nsolute risk perceptions and determine\nhow these perceptions influence their\nIn conclusion, most adults who con-\ntinue to smoke in the United States do not\nrecognize or acknowledge an increased\npersonal risk of heart disease or cancer.\nBecause smoking remains the most im-\nportant preventable cause of these dis-\neases in the United States, physicians and\npublic health professionals should edu-\ncate smokers about their personal health\nrisks as part of comprehensive efforts to\npromote smoking cessation.\nFunding/Support: This study was funded by the John\nD. and Catherine T.
