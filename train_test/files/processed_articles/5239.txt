Production of prostaglan-\n) is significantly upregulated following ICH and contributes to this inflammatory response in part through its E\nprostanoid receptor subtype 2 (EP2). Signaling through the EP2 receptor has been shown to affect outcomes of many acute\nand chronic neurological disorders; although, not yet explored in the context of ICH. Wildtype (WT) and EP2 receptor\nknockout (EP2\u00c0/\u00c0) mice were subjected to ICH, and various anatomical and functional outcomes were assessed by histology\nand neurobehavioral testing, respectively. When compared with age-matched WT controls, EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice had 41.9 \u00c6 4.7%\nsmaller ICH-induced brain lesions and displayed significantly less ipsilateral hemispheric enlargement and incidence of\nintraventricular hemorrhage. Anatomical outcomes correlated with improved functional recovery as identified by neuro-\nlogical deficit scoring. Histological staining was performed to begin investigating the mechanisms involved in EP2-mediated\nneurotoxicity after ICH. EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice exhibited 45.5 \u00c6 5.8% and 41.4 \u00c6 8.1% less blood and ferric iron accumulation, respect-\nively.

Further, there are currently no effect-\nive therapies for the treatment of ICH, and the clinical\nmanagement of patients focuses on supportive measures\nas surgical and medical management approaches have\nfailed to improve outcomes (Sahni and Weinberger,\nCrandall et al., 2011). Primary injury after ICH results\nfrom the influx of blood into the brain parenchyma lead-\ning to mass effects, increased local pressure, and\ndisruption of brain architecture (Aronowski and Zhao,\nchronic process attributable to the cytotoxicity and\nresulting strong inflammatory responses initiated by the\n1Department of Anesthesiology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA\n2Department of Neuroscience, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA\n3Departments of Neurology, Psychiatry, and Pharmaceutics, University of\nFlorida, Gainesville, FL, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nSylvain Dore\nEmail: sdore@ufl.edu\nASN Neuro\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nasn.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further permission\nprovided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (http://www.uk.sagepub.com/aboutus/openaccess.htm).\npresence of blood components and is the likely culprit of\npervasive, and often irreversible, neurological deficits\nAronowski and Zhao, 2011). Understanding the path-\nways involved during these secondary processes may pro-\nvide additional insight into ICH pathophysiology and\nuncover new therapeutic targets.\nNeuroinflammatory insults lead to increased produc-\ntion of prostaglandin E2\n), a potent biolipid mes-\nsenger that plays an important role in many physiological\nand pathological conditions in the brain (Jiang and\nlevels\nare increased in response to inflammation by cyclooxy-\ngenase-2 (COX-2), the inducible form of cyclooxygenase,\nand a rate-limiting enzyme responsible for formation of\nprostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid\nhas many diverse actions, with toxic and neuroprotective\neffects, as a result of differential activation of mainly four\nof these receptors has their own distinct signaling path-\nways, tissue distribution, and expression profiles\nHere, we focus on the role of the EP receptor subtype 2\n(EP2), a G protein-coupled receptor that stimulates ade-\nnylyl cyclase leading to increases in cytosolic cyclic AMP\n(cAMP), which in turn engages protein kinase A (PKA)\nand the exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac). and\nEpac signaling are intimately connected and may result in\nsynergistic or opposite effects (Bos, 2006). The temporal\ngradient of cAMP levels likely determines which pathway\nis preferentially activated: with early EP2 activation, and\nthus low cAMP, the PKA pathway presumably predom-\ninates, given its higher affinity for cAMP, while the Epac\npathway may succeed with continued EP2 activation and\nrises in cytosolic cAMP (Jiang and Dingledine, 2013). In\nthe brain, PGE2\n-EP2-cAMP-mediated PKA and Epac\nactivation is generally associated with neuroprotective\nand neurotoxic effects, respectively (McCullough et al.,\nUsing in vitro and in vivo models and genetic and\npharmacologic approaches, the role of the EP2 receptor\nin mediating outcomes of various neurological conditions\nhas been extensively studied. We, and others, have\nshown the beneficial effects of EP2 receptor signaling\nfollowing transient ischemic stroke, permanent focal\nischemia, and N-Methyl-D-aspartate-induced excitotoxi-\ntor signaling resulted in worse outcomes, with more oxi-\ndative stress and inflammation, in mouse models of\nAlzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD),\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and epilepsy (Liang\ninflammatory component and collectively these studies\nsuggest that EP2 receptor signaling can have either posi-\ntive or negative immunomodulatory effects depending on\nthe underlying neuropathological process.\nGiven the importance of PGE2\n-EP2 receptor signaling\nin a wide range of acute and chronic neurological condi-\ntions, we sought to determine the respective and unique\ncontribution of EP2 in modulating ICH-induced brain\ninjury and inflammation. We found that genetic deletion\nof the EP2 receptor results in improved anatomical and\nfunctional recovery following ICH and is associated with\nless blood and ferric iron accumulation, neuroinflamma-\ntion, blood\u00adbrain barrier (BBB) breakdown, and periph-\neral neutrophil infiltration. The PGE2\nEP2 receptor\nappears to play an important role in modulating ICH-\ninduced brain injury and inflammation and could repre-\nsent a new therapeutic target for the treatment of this\ncondition, which currently has no effective therapies.\nMaterials and Methods\nMice\nStudies were performed on 2.5- to 5-month-old male\nmice. The EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice develop normally, gain weight\nat a rate equal to that of WT animals, and have no\ngross anatomical or behavioral abnormalities when com-\npared with WT littermates (Hizaki et al., 1999; Ahmad\net al., 2006b). Prior to experiments, the genotype of\nEP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice was confirmed by polymerase chain reac-\ntion. Colonies were maintained in our animal facilities\nin a temperature-controlled environment (23 \u00c6 2C) on\na 12 hr reverse dark/light cycle, so behavioral testing\ncould be performed during the awaken phase. Mice\nwere allowed ad libitum access to food and water\nbefore and after surgical procedures. The Institutional\nAnimal Care and Use Committee at the University of\nFlorida approved all animal protocols.\nICH Model\nICH was induced in WT and EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice as described\npreviously with modifications (Chen et al., 2011; Singh\net al., 2013). Additional changes were incorporated in\norder to avoid needle insertion through the motor\ncortex and thus the possibility of confounding results\non behavioral analyses and to improve the modeling of\nclinical deep basal ganglia hemorrhages, where concomi-\ntant intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is seen in 40% of\nnontraumatic ICH cases and is associated with poor\n2 ASN Neuro\nlong-term prognosis (Moradiya et al., 2014; Poon et al.,\n2014). Changes were accomplished by modifying the site\nand angle of craniotomy/needle insertion and the site of\ninjection within the striatum. Briefly, stereotactic equip-\nment was first manipulated so the injection could be per-\nformed into the left hemisphere at a 40 angle from the\nvertical plane. Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane\n(4% induction, 1.5\u00ad2% maintenance) and immobilized\non a stereotactic frame (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL).\nA small left-sided incision in the skin overlying the skull\nwas made in a coronal plane midway between the left eye\nand ear. A craniotomy was performed at an angle match-\ning that of the stereotactic angle at the following coord-\ninates: 0.0 mm anteroposterior and 3.8 mm left, relative to\nbregma. A syringe with a 26-gauge needle (Hamilton Co.,\nReno, NV) was inserted 3.6 mm ventral from the skull\nsurface and 0.04 units of collagenase type VII-S (Sigma,\nSt. Louis, MO) dissolved in 0.40 ml of sterile water was\ninfused at 0.20 ml/min using an automated injector\n(Stoelting). The needle was left in place for 5 min and\nthen slowly removed over a 15 min period. Rectal tem-\nperatures were maintained at 37.0 \u00c6 0.5C throughout all\nsurgical procedures and mice were allowed to fully\nrecover in temperature and humidity-controlled cham-\nbers postoperatively.\nDetermination of Initial Hemorrhage Volume\nAs different initial hemorrhage volumes in WT and\nEP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice after collagenase-induced ICH could influ-\nence anatomical and functional recovery, we assessed\nbrain hemoglobin content in both groups 5 hr as we\nhave described (Wang and Dore\n(n \u00bc 3) and EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 (n \u00bc 4) mice were deeply anesthetized\nand transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered\nsaline (PBS). After quick removal of the brain, the olfac-\ntory bulbs and cerebellum were discarded and the ipsilat-\neral and contralateral hemispheres were separately\nsnap frozen in 2-methylbutane precooled over dry ice.\nSamples were thawed and homogenized for 5 min\nin 700 ml of sterile deionized water. After centrifugation\nwas used for hemoglobin determination by Drabkin's\nmethod (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). An eight-point stand-\nard curve was generated by spiking 15 ml of lysed cit-\nrate anticoagulated blood, collected by intracardial\npuncture from control animals, into 135 ml of a pooled\ncontralateral hemisphere supernatant with twofold\ndilutions thereafter. In a 96-well plate, 50 ml of\nDrabkin's reagent was added to 50 ml of supernatant.\nAll samples were run in triplicate. After 15 min incuba-\ntion at room temperature, cyanmethemoglobin concen-\ntration, reflecting brain hemoglobin content and thus\ninitial hemorrhage volume, was determined by absorb-\nFunctional Outcomes\nFunctional outcomes were assessed daily post-ICH by\nneurological deficit scoring (NDS), accelerating rotarod\nperformance, and open field locomotor activity. Testing\nwas performed during the dark cycle (awaken phase) by\ninvestigators blinded to genotype. Each test was per-\nformed at the same time of the day and mice were allowed\n1 hr of rest in between tests. NDS: two blinded investiga-\ntors independently assessed mice for deficits in neuro-\nlogical functioning as we have described (Glushakov\net al., 2013). Accelerating rotarod performance: mice\nwere evaluated for motor deficits and coordination,\nendurance, and balance using an accelerating rotarod\nRotamex-5 machine and software (Columbus, OH).\nRotational speed started at 4 rpm and ended at 30 rpm,\nand the latency to fall was automatically collected by the\nsoftware. On the three consecutive days prior to surgery,\nmice were trained twice per day (morning and late after-\nnoon), with three cycles per training period. Average per-\nformance on the sixth training period served as baseline\nfunctioning. Post-ICH testing consisted of one testing\nperiod per day with three cycles and data are reported\nas the average latency to fall. Open field locomotor activ-\nity: ambulatory distance and stereotypic time were mea-\nsured using an automated open field activity monitor and\nvideo tracking interface system (MED associates, St.\nAlbans, VT). Baseline locomotor activity was assessed\nthe day prior to surgery, before rotarod training and pre-\ntesting. Briefly, mice were placed individually in four\ntransparent acrylic cages and their locomotor activity\nwas recorded over a 30-min test period. The first 5 min\nof recorded data was omitted to exclude for initial anxiety\nresponses.\nHistology\nAt 72 hr post-ICH, mice were deeply anesthetized and\ntranscardially perfused with PBS (pH 7.4) followed by\n4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were collected and\nkept in 4% PFA for at least 24 hr prior to cryopreservation\nin a 30% sucrose/PBS solution. Ten sets of 16 sections\nequally distributed throughout the entire hematoma and\nanteroposterior brain regions were processed at 30 mm and\nstored at \u00c080C for later histological procedures. In this\nway, for each animal, multiple staining procedures can be\nperformed and the staining pattern throughout the whole\nbrain can be analyzed. Cresyl Violet staining was used to\nassess lesion volume, ipsilateral hemispheric enlargement,\nblood accumulation, and the incidence of IVH (Ahmad\net al., 2006a). To estimate the ferric iron content, Perls'\niron stain was completed by incubating slides in a 1:1 mix\nof 2% hydrochloric acid and 2% potassium ferrocyanide\nfor 20 min, followed by counterstaining with nuclear fast\nred. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate\nmicrogliosis, astrogliosis, BBB breakdown, and\nLeclerc et al. 3\nneutrophil infiltration using the following primary antibo-\ndies: ionized calcium-binding adapter protein 1 (Iba1),\n1:1,000 (Wako, Richmond, VA); glial fibrillary acidic pro-\ntein (GFAP), 1:1,000 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA); immuno-\nglobulin G (IgG), 1:300 (Vector Laboratories,\nBurlingame, CA); and myeloperoxidase (MPO), 1:500\n(Pierce, Dallas, TX), respectively. A secondary biotiny-\nlated antibody was used for detection (Vector\nLaboratories), except for in the case of IgG staining,\nwhich used a biotinylated primary anti-mouse IgG anti-\nbody. The Vectastain Elite Avidin/biotinylated enzyme\ncomplex and 3,30-diaminobenzidine (DAB) kits (Vector\nLaboratories) were used per manufacturer's instructions\nfor the avidin-peroxidase step and final DAB reaction,\nrespectively. MPO and IgG slides were counterstained\nwith Cresyl Violet, while GFAP and Iba1 slides were not\ncounterstained. After Cresyl violet, Perls' iron, and immu-\nnohistochemistry, slides were dehydrated in increasing\nconcentrations of ethanol and coverslipped with\nPermount.\nQuantification Procedures\nAll slides were scanned using a ScanScope CS and ana-\nlyzed with ImageScope software (Aperio Technologies,\nInc., Vista, CA). For quantification procedures in which\ntotal brain pathology was analyzed (lesion volume, ipsi-\nlateral hemispheric enlargement, blood accumulation,\nferric iron content, BBB breakdown, and peripheral neu-\ntrophil infiltration), all 16 sections were quantified for each\nanimal. To assess astrogliosis and microgliosis, the same\nfour sections representing maximal lesion area for each\nanimal were analyzed. Lesion volume: injured brain\nregions were outlined, areas abstracted from the\nImageScope software, and a volume was calculated using\nthese areas, known distance between each section, and sec-\ntion thickness. Percentage of ipsilateral hemispheric\nenlargement: the whole brain and contralateral hemi-\nsphere were outlined, volumes determined as described\nabove, and the percentage of ipsilateral hemispheric\nenlargement was calculated by 100 \u00c2 [(ipsilateral-contral-\nateral)/contralateral]. IVH: the visual presence of red\nblood cells (RBCs) within the lateral ventricles was\ncounted as IVH. Ferric iron content and immunohisto-\nchemical stains: the ImageScope Positive Pixel Count soft-\nware was used for quantification after the appropriate\nbrain regions were outlined (see below). Algorithms were\ndeveloped for each of the stains such that the appropriate\nsignal and strength of signal were evaluated (e.g. blue\npixels in Perls' stained slides). These algorithms were\ntuned so moderate and strongly positive pixels were\ndetected and weakly positive pixels were excluded as\nthese could potentially represent nonspecific signal.\nCortical microgliosis was analyzed by placing identically\ncontralateral motor cortex. Data are presented as the rela-\ntive ipsilateral to contralateral signal. Striatal microgliosis\nwas analyzed by outlining of the ipsilateral and contralat-\neral striatum, excluding the lesion area. Data are presented\nas the ipsilateral signal per area quantified, with normal-\nization for the contralateral signal per area quantified.\nCortical astrogliosis and striatal astrogliosis were analyzed\nin a similar manner to microgliosis; however, these data\nwere not normalized for the contralateral equivalent due\nto negligible signal in the contralateral cortex and striatum\nwith the thresholds used here. Blood accumulation, ferric\niron content, and MPO slides were analyzed by circling of\nthe ipsilateral hemisphere. Whole brain signal was exam-\nined for IgG quantification as staining extended into the\ncontralateral side in some cases. After all analyses, the\nappropriate algorithm was run and signal data were\nabstracted from the ImageScope software. As total ferric\niron content, BBB breakdown, and neutrophil infiltration\nwere analyzed, the values for each animal were individu-\nally corrected for lesion volume such that corrected and\nuncorrected data are presented.\nStatistics\nGraphPad Prism 6 software was used for all statistical\nanalyses. Differences between two groups were deter-\nmined by an unpaired two-tailed parametric Student's t-\ntest. The incidence rate for IVH was compared using\nFisher's exact test. Behavioral data were analyzed using\na repeated measures two-way analysis of variance and\nNewman\u00adKeuls multiple comparisons test. Data are\nexpressed as mean \u00c6 SEM and p < .05 was considered\nstatistically significant in all analyses.\nResults\nFollowing induction of ICH in WT and EP2\u00c0/\u00c0\nmice, consistent striatal hemorrhages were seen in\nboth groups at 72 hr postictus and various anatomical and\nfunctional outcomes were evaluated by histology and\nneurobehavioral testing, respectively.

Here, we\nunveil that genetic deletion of the EP2 receptor results in\nsmaller brain lesion volumes associated with less blood\nand ferric iron accumulation. EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice also displayed\nless ipsilateral hemispheric enlargement and incidence of\nIVH. With the neurobehavioral tests employed here, no\nsignificant differences were seen when comparing func-\ntional outcomes of WT and EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice at the same\ntime point post-ICH; however, EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice did display\nimproved recovery identified by NDS at 48 and 72 hr.\nThese improvements in anatomical outcomes and func-\ntional recovery were accompanied by less cortical and\nstriatal microgliosis, cortical and striatal astrogliosis,\nBBB breakdown, and peripheral neutrophil infiltration.\nTogether, these data suggest a deleterious role for PGE2\n-\nEP2 receptor signaling following ICH.\nIn the brain, the EP2 receptor has been reported to be\nhighly and broadly expressed by neurons and glia in the\ncerebral cortex, striatum, thalamus, and hippocampus of\nJohansson et al., 2013), where it has been shown to\nmodulate responses to several CNS insults including cere-\nbral ischemia, epilepsy, AD, PD, and ALS (Liang et al.,\n-/- (C)\n(A)\n(D)\n(B) WT EP2\n-/-\n-/-\n-/-\nW\nT\nGFAP Cortex Immunoreactivity (A.U.)\n**\nW\nT\nGFAP Striatum Immunoreactivity (A.U.)\n*\nIpsilateral\nContralateral\nIpsilateral\nContralateral\nFigure 5.

A few studies have looked into the con-\ntribution of EP2 in modulating phagocytosis in the con-\ntext of AD, PD, and antibacterial defense in the lung.\nDeletion or blockade of the EP2 receptor restored alveo-\nlar macrophage phagocytic ability of IgG-opsonized\nRBCs in response to stimulation with apoptotic cells\n(Medeiros et al., 2009). Activation of the EP2 receptor\nand butaprost, a selective EP2 agonist, reduced\nb-amyloid phagocytosis by cultured rat microglia\n(Nagano et al., 2010). In another study, deletion of the\nEP2 receptor enhanced microglial clearance of b-amyloid\nin human brain sections and reduced microglial-mediated\nb-amyloid paracrine neurotoxicity (Shie et al., 2005a).\nSimilarly, EP2 receptor deletion augmented microglial-\nmediated clearance of a-synuclein aggregates in the meso-\ncortex of patients with Lewy body disease (Jin et al.,\n2007). These studies collectively suggest that signaling\nthrough the EP2 receptor impairs the phagocytic capabil-\nities of macrophages and microglia, both of which are cell\ntypes responsible for clearance of RBCs and debris fol-\nlowing ICH. Furthermore, the EP2 receptor is reported\nto be the most strongly expressed E prostanoid receptor\non macrophages (Zaslona et al., 2012).

(a) Representative images of coronal brain\nsections showing more diffuse disruption of the BBB in WT mice. Square boxes denote the location of high magnification inserts. (b)\nQuantification of whole brain brown positive pixel count showed that EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice strongly tended to have reduced BBB breakdown (WT:\n\u00bc prostaglandin E2\n; EP2 \u00bc E prostanoid receptor subtype 2; ICH \u00bc intracerebral hemorrhage;\nWT \u00bcwildtype; BBB \u00bc blood\u00adbrain barrier; IgG \u00bc immunoglobulin G.\nthat in this study, EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice showed smaller ICH-\ninduced brain lesions with less blood and ferric iron accu-\nmulation as a result of enhanced phagocytic capability,\nresulting in improved clearance of RBCs and damaged\ntissue.\nDifferences in the vasculature and susceptibility to col-\nlagenase-induced bleeding are other possible mechanisms\nthat could lead to smaller lesion volumes in EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice\nfollowing ICH. We have previously shown that genetic\ndeletion of the EP2 receptor does not significantly alter\nthe gross vascular anatomy of the brain (Ahmad et al.,\n2010). Although we cannot exclude that structural differ-\nences exist in the vessels of EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice on a microscopic\nscale, which could alter ICH outcomes, we have shown\nthat the initial bleed volume is not significantly different\nbetween the two genotypes. Equivalent initial hemor-\nrhage volumes imply that the underlying anatomical\nstructure of small penetrating striatal vessels is not sig-\nnificantly changed with EP2 receptor deletion and that\nthese mice are equally susceptible to collagenase-induced\nbleeding. These findings further point toward a blood\nclearance mechanism as the etiology of improved out-\ncomes in EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice after ICH.\nThe EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice also demonstrated reduced ipsilat-\neral hemispheric enlargement and less incidence of IVH,\nwhich both may simply be attributed to smaller lesion\nvolumes. However, we cannot rule out that the former\nmay also be a result of EP2-mediated increased neuroin-\nflammation and edema formation in WT mice. Although\nwe have shown the substantially reduced gliosis in\nEP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice after ICH, additional studies would be\nneeded to determine whether edema is participating in\nthe increased ipsilateral hemispheric enlargement and\nwhether this edema was directly as a result of signaling\nthrough the EP2 receptor. Whereas the decreased inci-\ndence of IVH in EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice is most likely as a result\nof smaller lesion volumes and less extension of blood into\nthe lateral ventricles. It should be noted that the modifi-\ncations we incorporated into the commonly used ICH\nmodel employed in this study (see Methods) resulted in\napproximately the same overall incidence of IVH after\nICH as is seen clinically (Bhattathiri et al., 2006;\nthe presence of IVH was accompanied by hydrocephalus\n(e.g., dilation or enlargement of the lateral ventricles) as\noccurs in patients with IVH alone or who have IVH as a\nresult of a primary ICH or other type of acute brain\ndamage (Bhattathiri et al., 2006). Therefore, this modified\nICH model offers two advantages: (a) it results in a more\nclinically relevant scenario and (b) it avoids any potential\nconfounding effects on neurobehavioral testing because\nthe needle used for injection is not inserted through the\nmotor cortex.\nFunctional outcomes were not significantly different\nbetween the WT and EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice on any of the\nneurobehavioral tests when comparing between these\ntwo groups at each testing time point post-ICH. The dis-\ncrepancy in correlation between anatomical and func-\ntional outcomes could be due to the inherent difficulty\nof detecting subtle differences in neurological function\nin mice. Moreover, differences in functional outcomes\nmay be exaggerated and easier to detect at later time\npoints with this ICH model given the extensive damage\nproduced early on. Under physiological conditions,\n-EP2 signaling supports hippocampal-dependent\nmemory formation and synaptic plasticity and EP2\u00c0/\u00c0\nmice have been shown to have impairments in these pro-\nFuruyashiki and Narumiya, 2011). Thus, another pos-\nsible reason for the discrepancy could be due to impaired\ncognition with EP2 receptor deletion, which could negate\nthe positive effects of absent EP2 signaling on motor\nrecovery. Nonetheless, EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice did display less\nneurological deficits at 48 and 72 hr when compared\nwith their 24 hr functioning as identified by NDS,\nwhereas the WT mice did not, suggesting that deletion\nof the EP2 receptor improves the rate of neurological\nrecovery.\nMicroglia and astrocytes are strongly activated follow-\ning ICH, where they dynamically interact to modulate\ninflammatory responses and neuronal survival/injury.\nFor example, astrocytes can directly mediate neuronal\nsurvival through production of neurotrophic and angio-\ngenic factors, modulation of neuronal sensitivity to glu-\ntamate toxicity and oxidative stress, and downregulation\nof microglial secretion of proinflammatory mediators and\nreactive oxygen species (ROS; Wang and Dore\nHowever, with excessive activation, astrocytes can also\ninduce edema, provoke inflammation, and release cyto-\ntoxins after ICH (Munakata et al., 2013). Likewise,\nmicroglia also have dual roles, where they are protective\nin their cleanup of RBCs and tissue debris but toxic in\ntheir release of ROS and proinflammatory mediators.\nDeletion of the EP2 receptor resulted in significantly\nreduced brain gliosis after ICH, with less cortical and\nstriatal microgliosis and astrogliosis. These results are\nconsistent with other studies, which have shown that fol-\nlowing various CNS insults, presence of the EP2 receptor\ncontributes to microglial and astrocyte activation and sig-\nnificantly increases the levels of many proinflammatory\nQuan et al., 2013). Furthermore, in a few models, neuro-\ntoxicity was associated with microglial-specific EP2\n2013), suggesting that EP2-mediated microglial activation\nand release of proinflammatory mediators from these\ncells contribute to neuronal injury. An unbiased micro-\narray of microglia derived from mice with EP2 condition-\nally deleted on myeloid cells revealed a significant\nreduction in the expression of genes associated with\ncytokine and chemokine signaling, chemotaxis and cell\nadhesion, immune cell activation, and cell cycle/mitosis,\nimplying an overall decreased inflammatory and prolif-\nerative state of EP2 conditional knockout microglia\n(Johansson et al., 2013). Of note, COX-2 expression\nwas also highly suppressed. In the context of the current\nstudy, this point would mean a deleterious positive feed-\nback loop exists in the WT mice, where EP2 activation\nleads to increased COX-2 expression, PGE2\nproduction,\nEP2-mediated microglial activation, and proinflamma-\ntory responses (Johansson et al., 2013). Collectively,\nthese results broadly imply that PGE2\nsignaling through\nEP2 receptors promotes brain inflammation, leading to\nmicroglial-mediated neuronal injury and suggests that the\noverall reduced activation state in the absence of EP2\nmay be responsible for the improved ICH outcomes\nseen here.\nThis overall blunted neuroinflammatory response in\nEP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice after ICH could also explain the reduced\nBBB breakdown and peripheral neutrophil infiltration.\nIn addition to COX-2 suppression, IL-1b, CXCR2, and\nMMP-9 are some of the most downregulated genes in\nmyeloid-specific EP2 conditional knockout mice\n(Johansson et al., 2013). Also importantly, this condi-\ntional knockout has equivalent attenuation of plasma\nTNFa and IL-6 levels as seen in the global knockout\n(Johansson et al., 2013), further suggesting the import-\nance of myeloid-specific EP2 signaling in promoting the\ninflammatory response. CXCR2 is the main receptor\nresponsible for neutrophil migration to sites of inflamma-\ntion. MMP-9 is known to actively participate in BBB\nbreakdown and increases capillary permeability, thereby\ncontributing to brain edema secondary to hemorrhagic\nbrain injury (Wang and Dore\nMMP-9 expression from microglia devoid of EP2\nwould also likely be accompanied by less activation of\nMMP-9 due to suppression of ROS and protease produc-\ntion from reduced numbers of infiltrating neutrophils and\ncomparatively less activated microglia. Injection of\nrecombinant IL-1b into the striatum of rats has been\nshown to cause a transient neutrophil-dependent increase\nin the permeability of the BBB (Blamire et al., 2000).\nCollectively, the reduced expression of these proinflam-\nmatory mediators in EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice could explain the\nreduced BBB breakdown and peripheral neutrophil infil-\ntration. Furthermore, another related neurotoxic positive\nfeedback mechanism probably exists, in addition to\nthe one described earlier, as IL-1b is known to\nincrease COX-2 expression leading to even higher levels\n, further potentiating the microglial-mediated\nneuronal injury. Moreover, CXCR2 and MMP-9 may\nthen be upregulated as these are partially controlled by\nGiven that we analyzed total brain ferric iron content,\nBBB breakdown, and neutrophil infiltration in this study,\nan attempt was made to determine whether the differ-\nences seen in these parameters between WT and EP2\u00c0/\u00c0\nmice were mediated by EP2 signaling or as a result of\ndifferences in ICH-induced lesion volumes and blood\naccumulation. The values obtained for each parameter\nand animal were individually normalized to lesion\nvolume. In this way, uncorrected and corrected results\ncan be compared between WT and EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 groups,\nwhere if the same trends are seen in both cases, it suggests\na direct effect of EP2 signaling rather than a blood-\nmediated event. Here, we have shown that after individ-\nual normalization for lesion volume, ferric iron content,\nBBB breakdown, and neutrophil infiltration all became\nnonsignificant between WT and EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 groups, implying\nthat the improved outcomes in EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice resulted\nfrom less blood accumulation and associated brain\ndamage, further suggesting a possible primary role of\nEP2 in negatively modulating microglial/macrophage\nphagocytosis after ICH. However, additional focused\nconfirmatory studies would be needed in order to validate\nthese indirect analyses implying a blood clearance mech-\nanism and assess the complex role of inflammatory medi-\nators. These additional studies should also incorporate\nseveral other approaches to further clarify the role of\n-EP2 signaling axis in modulating ICH out-\ncomes and to begin assessing the clinical utility of target-\ning the EP2 receptor as a possible treatment for ICH,\nincluding the following: (a) additional end points,\n(b) extension to the autologous blood ICH model to\naddress the potential contribution of a collagenase-\ninduced inflammatory response, and (c) pharmacologic\nmanipulation of the EP2 receptor with the currently\navailable selective agonists and antagonists. The latter\nstudies should also assess the safety and efficacy of such\na pharmacologic approach with a comprehensive evalu-\nation of the possible side effects on other organs or find a\nclinically relevant way to acutely block EP2 locally within\nthe brain.\nCollectively, this study reveals a likely deleterious role\nfor the PGE2\n-EP2 signaling axis after ICH. We have\nshown that genetic deletion of the EP2 receptor results\nin an overall improvement in ICH-induced brain injury,\nwhere EP2\u00c0/\u00c0 mice have smaller lesion volumes asso-\nciated with less blood and ferric iron accumulation and\nreduced gliosis, BBB breakdown, and peripheral neutro-\nphil infiltration. Thus, modulation of the PGE2\nnaling axis may represent a new therapeutic avenue for\nthe treatment of ICH.\nSummary Statement\nThis study investigates the contribution of the PGE2\nsignaling axis in modulating intracerebral hemorrhage\noutcomes.
