Design and Methods:\nThe study relied on data from the National Survey of\nFamilies and Households. The sample consisted of parent\u00ad\nadult child dyads where parents were aged 55\u00ad75 at time\n2 and adult children resided outside the household at both\nwaves (N  2,153 parent\u00adadult child dyads, based on re-\nports from 792 parents). Generalized estimating equations\n(GEE) with robust standard errors were used. Results:\nRetirement has no significant effect on telephone contacts.\nRetired parents maintain frequent visits with children. For\nchildren living within 10 miles, mothers' retirement is asso-\nciated with fewer and fathers' retirement with more visits.\nThis trend varies by number of children, length of retire-\nment, and child's gender. For children living more than 10\nmiles away, retired mothers decrease visits with childless\nchildren, whereas retired fathers increase visits with child-\nless children. Implications: We attribute these findings to\nthe gender-specific salience of child contacts for retirees\nand suggest that future research address children's and\nparents' expectations for postretirement contacts.\nKey Words: Gender, Intergenerational relations, Kin\nrelationships\nDespite considerable interest both in the conse-\nquences of retirement and in the predictors of par-\nent\u00adadult child contacts, few studies have linked\nthese two research areas. Studies addressing retire-\nment effects typically focus either on social contacts\nor social networks in general (Boss\u00e9, Aldwin, Leven-\nson, Spiro, & Mroczek, 1993; Boss\u00e9, Aldwin, Leven-\nson, Workman-Daniels, & Ekerdt, 1990; Boss\u00e9 &\ngations into parent\u00adadult child relationships center\non familial factors such as geographical distance,\nemotional attachment, or feelings of obligation (Law-\nton, Silverstein, & Bengtson, 1994; Rossi & Rossi,\n1990). Yet, life-course theories stress that work and\nfamily spheres are interdependent, and that events in\none sphere can influence events or relationships in\nthe other sphere (Bengtson & Allen, 1993; Moen,\n1996). Investigation of changes in kin contacts after\nretirement also has relevance for retirement prepara-\ntion and counseling. Both parents and adult children\nmay either feel uncertainty or have unrealistic expec-\ntations about their relationship after the parents' re-\ntirement (Szinovacz, Ekerdt, & Vinick, 1992). For\nexample, parents may expect enhanced support from\nchildren that the children are unable or unwilling to\nprovide (Remnet, 1987), and adult children may ex-\npect increased time commitments on the part of re-\ntired parents (e.g., to take care of grandchildren) that\ninterfere with parents' planned retirement activities.\nSuch scenarios may generate conflict between gener-\nations and undermine parents' adaptation to the re-\ntirement transition. This study addresses retirement\neffects on parents' contacts with their adult children,\nusing panel data from the National Survey of Fami-\nlies and Households (NSFH).\nLiterature Review\nEvidence on retirement-related changes in social\ncontacts is scarce and inconsistent. George and col-\nleagues (1984) report an increase in time spent with\nfriends among both women and men, whereas Boss\u00e9\nand coworkers (1993) find a decrease in quantitative\nbut stability in qualitative social supports among men\nwho retired. A smaller study of retiring men (Van Til-\nburg, 1992) indicates that the overall size of social\nnetworks remained relatively stable over the retire-\nment transition, but at the same time there was con-\nsiderable fluctuation of network members. Relation-\nships with relatives tended to be more stable than\nthose with friends or acquaintances. These inconsis-\nThis research was funded by a grant from the National Institute on\ntor.

These studies demonstrate con-\ntinued close bonds between parents and adult chil-\ndren into parents' later years (Eggebeen & Davey,\nThe extent of interactions seems to depend on gender\nand geographical distance (Lawton et al., 1994;\nRossi & Rossi, 1990) as well as on status transitions\nof both parents and children such as parents' divorce\nand remarriage (Kaufman & Uhlenberg, 1998). The\nfew studies considering parents' employment status\nyield inconsistent results. Rossi and Rossi (1990)\nshow that mothers' full-time employment is associ-\nated with reduced face-to-face contacts with sons,\nwhereas sons report more contacts (visits and phone)\nwith full-time employed fathers. Logan and Spitze\n(1996) report no significant effects of employment\nstatus on visits or telephone contacts between par-\nents and adult children.\nIn summary, current research provides some evi-\ndence that both parents' and adult children's em-\nployment status can influence intergenerational rela-\ntions, and that retirement impinges on social networks.\nHowever, the extent and direction of these effects re-\nmain unclear, and there is essentially no information\nlinking parents' retirement to contacts with their\nadult children.\nTheoretical Framework and Hypotheses\nIn view of the separate treatment of retirement\nand intergenerational issues in past research, our the-\noretical approach integrates insights from both re-\nsearch traditions. Studies of postretirement activities\nand well-being typically proceed from the assump-\ntion that adaptation to loss of the work role requires\na reorganization of retirees' activities (Kosloski, Gins-\nburg, & Backman, 1984). It is not clear, however,\nwhat type of reorganization is best suited to compen-\nsate for the loss of work-related gratifications. Some\nargue that engagement in new activities is most bene-\nficial, while others stress the importance of continu-\nThe broadest theoretical approach to intergenera-\ntional relations is the intergenerational solidarity\nframework developed by Roberts, Richards, and\nBengtson (1991). These researchers distinguish six\ninterdependent dimensions of intergenerational soli-\ndarity (structural, normative, functional, associa-\ntional, affectional, and consensual). They further\ndemonstrate that associational solidarity (contact\namong family members, the dimension of solidarity\nthat constitutes the dependent variable in this study)\nis influenced by normative and affectional solidarity,\nthat is, norms and feelings of closeness (Roberts &\nBengtson, 1990). Other research shows that struc-\ntural solidarity (geographical distance) has a strong\nimpact on contacts among family members (Logan\napproach by Cicirelli (1989) emphasizes the impor-\ntance of attachment, obligation, and dependency (or\nneeds) for kin relationships. The first two dimensions\nare akin to affectional and normative solidarity,\nwhereas dependency introduces the notion of needs\nas predictor of kin interactions and supports (Davey\n& Eggebeen, 1998). More recently, researchers (Bel-\nliston, Davey, & Bookout, 1999; Kaufman & Uhlen-\nberg, 1998) have begun to explore ways in which\nchanging needs and resources of each generation\nmight affect changes and generational differences in\nintergenerational solidarity. This approach under-\nlines the importance of considering intergenerational\nrelationships from a dyadic level (i.e., one that con-\nsiders parents' relationships with each child sepa-\nrately).\nBased on this earlier work, we suggest that kin\ncontacts are affected by opportunity structures (espe-\ncially time constraints and geographical distance),\nfeelings of obligation (norms), and the salience of\nspecific kin relationships. Salience most likely derives\nfrom affectional solidarity, as well as from family\nmembers' needs for kin interactions. It is important\nto consider these dimensions for each family member\ninvolved in kin interactions. Thus, parent\u00adadult child\ncontacts will depend on both parents' and children's\nopportunity structures and on parents' and children's\nfeelings of obligation and salience.\nWe further contend that reorganization of kin con-\ntacts after parents' retirement will reflect these influ-\nences. However, we lack adequate data to establish\nthe impact of normative solidarity (the NSFH only\ncontains data on attitudes toward coresidence and fi-\nnancial supports, which probably have little relevance\nfor norms pertaining to associational solidarity).\nConsequently, our hypotheses focus on salience and\nconstraints. Whether retired parents strive to enhance\ncontacts with their children will depend foremost on\nwhether such contacts can compensate for the role\nloss experienced upon retirement and thus the sa-\nlience of contacts with the children. Specifically, con-\ntacts with children can compensate for the loss of so-\ncial contacts with work colleagues, and they can\nprovide the basis for identity enhancement in the\nroles of parent and grandparent. Because we lack a\ndirect measure of kin salience, we rely on indicators\nthat have been linked to salience of kin relations in\npast research. Earlier investigations suggest that sa-\nlience of kin interactions is influenced by gender. Spe-\ncifically, women seem to attach more importance to\nand are more involved in kin interactions than men\nthough men also seem to derive some gratification\nfrom the grandparent role (Spitze & Ward, 1998). In\naddition, the salience of contacts may vary by child's\ngender. Earlier studies indicate the importance of\nsame-sex ties (Kaufman & Uhlenberg, 1998). This\nimplies that mothers may derive more gratification\nfrom interactions with daughters, whereas men may\ngain more satisfaction from contacts with sons. Sa-\nlience of child contacts will also depend on whether\nretired parents have alternative roles that may satisfy\ntheir social and identity needs, most importantly the\nmarital role. Married men in particular seem to ob-\ntain fulfillment of social needs outside the work role\nforemost from their spouses (Antonucci & Akiyama,\n1995). In addition, emotional closeness to specific\nchildren will likely determine salience of contacts\nwith these children after retirement. We thus hypoth-\nesize that retired parents will seek increased contacts\nwith adult children if they feel close to the child, if the\nparents are not married (this applies particularly to\nmale retirees), and if the child has children. We fur-\nther hypothesize that women will be more inclined to\nenhance contacts with daughters, whereas men will\nbe more likely to increase contacts with sons.\nPrevious research further suggests that adaptation\nto retirement may proceed in stages. Retirees initially\nengage in nonroutine projects and activities such as\ntravel or geographical moves that tend to be exciting\nand satisfying but of relatively short duration (the\nso-called \"honeymoon\" period; see Atchley, 1976;\nEkerdt, Boss\u00e9, & Levkoff, 1985). This period is fol-\nlowed by the establishment of a more enduring re-\ntirement lifestyle. We suggest that enhanced contacts\nwith adult children are more likely to be a pattern es-\ntablished in this latter period. Thus, we hypothesize\nthat enhancement in contacts will be more likely\namong parents who have been retired for two or\nmore years.\nAlthough salience of kin relationships is likely to\ninfluence whether retirees direct their search for\ncompensating postretirement activities toward inter-\nactions with kin, the implementation of such aspira-\ntions can be limited by deficient opportunity, partic-\nularly geographical distance and time constraints. As\nnoted earlier, geographical distance has been consis-\ntently linked to frequency of association with kin\nport for the impact of other constraints is limited and\ninconsistent. There is some indication that children's\nemployment may curtail relations with their parents\nAnother constraint may derive from the number of\nchildren. Although having numerous children seems\nto enhance parents' ability to see any child (Uhlen-\nberg & Cooney, 1990), it is not clear how number of\nchildren influences contacts with each individual\nchild. Recent research on grandparenthood suggests,\nfor example, that individual grandparent\u00adgrand-\nchild contacts decline with the number of grandchil-\ndren (Uhlenberg & Hammill, 1998). Similarly, par-\nents with more children are obliged to divide attention\namong children, which may reduce interactions with\neach individual child. We thus hypothesize that post\u00ad\nretirement increases in parent\u00adadult child contacts\nshould be more pronounced for parent\u00adchild dyads\nwho live close to each other, and that they should be\nless pronounced for full-time employed children and\nfor parents with numerous children.\nMethods\nSample\nThe analyses rely on data from the National Sur-\nvey of Families and Households (NSFH), conducted\narea probability sample with oversamples for minor-\nities and selected other groups (e.g., one-parent fami-\nlies, families with stepchildren, cohabitors, and re-\ncently married individuals). Data were collected from\na randomly selected household member aged 19 or\nmore, his/her spouse, and, in some cases, a tertiary\nhousehold member. First-wave interview response\nrates for the successfully screened households were\nsample, resulting in a total sample of 13,008 respon-\ndents (for a detailed description of the study, see\nuse weights to adjust for nonresponses at time 1 and\nattrition at time 2.\nBecause our analyses focus on changes in contacts\nbrought about by the retirement transition, we se-\nlected a subsample at risk of retirement. This sub-\nsample consists of respondents aged 55\u00ad75 at time 2\nwho were employed 10 hours or more at time 1 and\nhad adult children outside the household at both\ntimes. The age range corresponds with typical retire-\nment ages, and the restriction to 10 hours of employ-\nment ensures that parents pursued some regular em-\nployment preceding retirement. However, only very\nfew respondents (2.2%) worked fewer than 10 hours\nat baseline. In addition, we excluded from the sample\nthose parents who reported receipt of health care\nfrom any adult child (5.3%). This restriction is nec-\nessary to avoid confounding of associational (social\ncontacts) and functional (supports) solidarity and to\nensure that potential increases in contacts are not\ndue to changes in parents' health and need for care.\nAs NSFH respondents reported on contacts with\neach adult child, the data were accumulated for each\nparent\u00adchild dyad. Thus, the parent\u00adchild dyads and\nnot the parents are the primary unit of analysis (for a\nsimilar approach see Uhlenberg & Hammill, 1998).\nThe final unweighted sample size consisted of 2,153\nparent\u00adadult child dyads (based on responses from\n792 parents). Not considered in the analyses were\nadult children for whom reports were only available\nat one wave (children who \"disappeared\" between\nwaves or were first mentioned at time 2), as well as\nchildren who moved into or out of their parents'\nhousehold. This is necessary because analysis of\nchange in contacts requires comparable information\nat both waves. The data refer exclusively to adult\nchildren who were age 19 or older at baseline.\nNonresponses in panel data can lead to biased re-\nsults when cases with missing data are dropped from\nthe analyses (Little & Rubin, 1987), especially when\ndata are not missing completely at random (MCAR)\nas is the case for our analyses. We therefore created\nfive complete-case data sets using the regression\nmethod provided by SPSS (SPSS, 1997). The data\nshown in the tables are based on multiple imputation\ninference using NORM (Schafer, 1997) from analy-\nses performed on these five data sets. To assess the\nsensitivity of our findings to the imputation methods\nused here, we compared our results with those ob-\ntained using the expectation\u00admaximization method,\nas well as reliance on nonimputed data (listwise dele-\ntion), yielding highly similar findings in each case.\nThis suggests that results are fairly stable and only\nminimally affected by the imputation method.\nRespondents are close to or at retirement age (M \nsample are Black and 6% are from other minorities.\nSixty-one percent of respondents were married at\ntime 2. Education is slightly above the high school\nworked full time at baseline, and 45% retired be-\ntween waves. The adult children are equally divided\nby gender; 64% of the children are themselves par-\nents, and 76% were employed full time at time 2.\nMore than one third of the children (36%) lived\nwithin 10 miles of their parents at time 2. Children's\nDependent Variables\nTwo dependent variables were used in the analy-\nses: visits and telephone/letter contacts at time 2.\nNote that in all cases the analyses relied on the par-\nents' reports. Frequency of visits and letter/telephone\ncontacts was measured with the question: During the\nlast 12 months, how often did you see (talk on the\ntelephone or receive a letter) from [child]? Answer\ncategories were: 1  not at all, 2  once a year, 3 \nseveral times a year, 4  1\u00ad3 times a month, 5 \nonce a week, 6  more than once a week. Wave 1\nvisits and telephone/letter contacts were included as\npredictor variables in all analyses. Thus, the depen-\ndent variables reflect contacts at time 2 net of con-\ntacts at time 1. At time 1, respondents reported see-\ning their children on average several times a month\n(M  3.99) and to have somewhat more frequent\ntelephone/letter contacts (M  4.54).\nIndependent Variables\nThe major independent variable is parents' retire-\nment. We rely on full withdrawal from the labor\nforce to measure retirement. This definition may dif-\nfer from self-definition as retiree (Ekerdt & DeViney,\nployment-related time constraints limit parents' abil-\nity to interact with children or to travel to visit chil-\ndren, it is most likely that parents' withdrawal from\nthe labor force (rather than retirement from the main\ncareer job) precipitates changes in contacts with chil-\ndren. Length of retirement was operationalized by\nsubdividing retirees into those retired less than 2 years\nand those retired 2 years or more. This dichotomy\ncorresponds with our hypothesis concerning a poten-\ntial honeymoon effect. Preliminary analyses further\nindicate that there are no differences between those\nretired 2\u00ad3 years and those retired longer. Date of re-\ntirement was only assessed in the questionnaires\ngiven to respondents and has a relatively high num-\nber of missing values (7%). Because imputation of\nmissing values for a subpopulation (retirees) is prob-\nlematic, we developed an extra category for missing\ncases and included this category in the analyses.\nThus, the reference group consists exclusively of per-\nsons who did not retire between waves.\nAdditional independent variables are parents' and\nchildren's gender, parents' marital status, parents'\nperceived emotional closeness to each child (mea-\nsured at baseline), the number of children each par-\nent has outside the household, children's parental\nstatus, children's employment, and geographical dis-\ntance. Gender of both parents and children was\ndummy-coded (female  1, male  0).\nParents' marital status was coded into two dummy\nvariables, those married and those widowed at time\n2. Divorcees and the very few never-married parents\nare the reference. This distinction reflects earlier re-\nsearch findings indicating that it is divorced parents,\nespecially, who may lose contacts with their children\n(Kaufman & Uhlenberg, 1998). In addition, change\nin marital status between waves was controlled in the\nanalyses.\nParents' emotional closeness to each child was\nonly measured at baseline. Parents were asked to de-\nscribe their relationship with each child (1  very\npoor, 7  excellent).\nNumber of parents' children refers exclusively to\nadult children outside the household, as these are the\nchildren of interest in this study. Because of the dis-\ntribution of this variable (fewer than 5% have only\none child outside the household), we differentiate\namong parents who have only one or two children,\nthose with three children, and those with four or\nmore children. Although children in the household\nwill also compete for parents' attention, contacts\nwith these children are not subject to change. How-\never, change in household composition was con-\ntrolled in the analyses.\nChildren's parental status was treated as a dichot-\nomous variable (1  child has biological children in\nthe household; reference  child has no biological\nchildren living in the household).\nMeasurement of children's employment status is\nbased on the question: Is (child) currently working\nfull time, part time, or not at all? This information\nwas only provided at time 2. We differentiate be-\ntween children employed full time and those em-\nployed part time or not at all. Preliminary analyses\nindicated that there is no difference in contacts be-\ntween part-time and not employed children.\nMeasurement of geographic distance is based on\nparents' reports of how far away (in miles) each child\nlived at time 1 and time 2. In line with earlier re-\ncriterion for distinguishing children who live within\nparents' immediate neighborhood from those living\noutside the parents' immediate neighborhood. In ad-\ndition, change in distance between waves was con-\ntrolled in all analyses.\nOther controls included in the analyses are race,\nwhether parents worked full time at baseline, parents'\nlimitations in activities of daily living at time 2,\nchange in parents' self-reported health, change in par-\nents' income, change in spouse's employment status\nbetween waves, whether the child is the biological\nchild of the respondent's spouse, changes in parents'\nand children's marital status between waves, and chil-\ndren's age. Means and standard deviations of all vari-\nables (including controls) are shown in Table 1.\nData Analyses\nOur analyses refer to parent\u00adadult child dyads.\nThis means that parents with more than one adult\nchild are represented more than once in the data set\nand observations are not independent. Under such\ncircumstances, standard statistical procedures yield\ndownwardly biased standard errors. To overcome\nthis problem, our analyses rely on generalized esti-\nmating equations (GEE; see Liang & Zeger, 1986)\nwith clusters for family unit (parent's identification\nnumber), using a random-effects model and addi-\ntional adjustments for robust standard errors with\nthe Huber/White/sandwich estimator of variance\n(Stata, 1997). Coefficients obtained from GEE are\nakin to unstandardized linear regression coefficients,\nalthough Stata does not provide standardized esti-\nmates or R-square statistics.\nInteractions were tested in line with standard re-\ngression procedures, that is, equations with higher or-\nder interactions were tested first and include all lower\norder interaction terms (Aiken & West, 1991). We\nstarted with the highest order terms allowed by sub-\ngroup distribution, which are triple interactions. We\nfirst tested interactions by parents' gender, geographi-\nTable 1.

As this in-\nteraction proved to be significant, we performed all\nsubsequent analyses separately for children living\nwithin 10 miles of the parent and children living fur-\nther away. We then tested for interactions by parent's\ngender, parent's retirement, and each of the other hy-\npothesized contingencies (child's gender, parent's mar-\nital status, emotional closeness to the child, number of\nchildren, child's parental status, child's employment)\nin separate equations (e.g., Parent's gender  Parent's\nretirement  Child's gender). If the higher order term\nwas not significant, the next lower order term was\ntested (e.g., Child's gender  Retirement, Parent's\ngender  Retirement). This procedure provides some\nassurance that multiple interaction terms do not\nevolve through multicollinearity among the interac-\ntion terms. In case of significant interactions, we fur-\nther estimated outcomes (frequency of contacts) for\nthe pertinent subgroups from the regression equations\n(Aiken & West, 1991). These results are not shown in\nthe tables but are described in the Discussion section.\nTests for multicollinearity were performed. Vari-\nance inflation (Fox, 1991) for the full model with\ncontrols (but without the interaction terms) yielded a\nmean VIF of 1.30. This indicates that multicollinear-\nity is not a problem in our analyses.\nResults\nThe main objective of our analyses was to estab-\nlish whether parent\u00adadult child contacts are affected\nby parents' retirement, and whether such effects are\ncontingent on selected parent and child characteris-\ntics. The first step in our analyses was to establish\nwhether retirement has any effect on visits or tele-\nphone contacts. Preliminary analyses (not shown) in-\ndicate that retirement does influence visits, but there\nare no effects for telephone contacts. Because tele-\nphone contacts are not influenced by retirement, all\nadditional analyses pertain to visits.\nHaving established that visits are affected by re-\ntirement, we explored predicted contingencies of this\neffect. We first examined whether retirement effects\ndiffer for contacts with children living nearby (within\n10 miles) and those living further away, and whether\nsuch effects vary by parent's gender. These analyses\n(see Table 2, first data column) substantiate that the\nRetirement  Distance  Parent's gender interaction\nis significant. Inspection of the interaction indicates\nthat among parent\u00adchild dyads living within 10 miles\nof each other, mothers who retired see their children\nless frequently than mothers who remained em-\nployed, whereas retired fathers report more frequent\nvisits than continuously employed fathers. Among\nparent\u00adchild dyads who do not live close to each\nother, visits occur less frequently and are similar for\nemployed and retired men and women.\nIn view of the strong effect of geographical distance,\nwe tested the other hypothesized relationships sepa-\nrately for parent\u00adchild dyads living within 10 miles of\neach other and those living further apart. In addition\nto parents' gender, we expected children's gender to af-\nfect changes in contacts after retirement. Our analyses\nconfirm that children's gender has some influence on\nretirement-related changes in visits (Table 2, model 1).\nSpecifically, retirees (both fathers and mothers) seem\nto increase visits with daughters and slightly reduce\ncontacts with sons. This effect is restricted to parent\u00ad\nchild dyads living close to each other.\nSalience of post-retirement contacts was also pre-\ndicted to vary by children's parental status. This ef-\nfect is confirmed for parent\u00adchild dyads living more\nthan 10 miles apart and varies by parent's gender\n(see Table 2, second data column). Mothers seem to\nmaintain a relatively high level of contacts with chil-\ndren who are themselves parents, regardless of the\nmother's employment status. In contrast, mothers'\nvisits with childless children seem to decline after\nretirement. Fathers increase contacts with childless\nchildren after they retire but decrease visits with chil-\ndren who are parents. Among parent\u00adchild dyads liv-\ning within 10 miles of each other, child's parenthood\nhas no effect on post-retirement changes in visits.\nSalience was also expected to be reflected in par-\nents' feelings of closeness to the child and in parents'\nneeds (based on their marital status). We find no sup-\nport for either hypothesis. Retirement-related changes\nin visits are not contingent on parents' feelings of\ncloseness to the child nor on their marital status.\nOur final hypothesis pertaining to salience of post-\nretirement contacts referred to length of retirement.\nWe expected a stronger influence for parents who\nwere past the honeymoon period, that is, those re-\ntired 2 years or more. The data confirm that length\nof retirement matters (Table 2, model 3). It is prima-\nrily mothers retired 2 years or more who decrease\nvisits with children living nearby. Retired fathers, on\nthe other hand, report more visits with nearby chil-\ndren regardless of length of retirement, although this\ntrend is particularly pronounced for fathers retired\nunder 2 years. Length of retirement has no impact on\nvisits with children living more than 10 miles away.\nIn addition to geographical distance, we expected\nchildren's employment and number of children to\nconstrain parents' aspirations for post-retirement con-\ntacts. We find no support for an influence of chil-\ndren's employment status. Number of children out-\nside the household does moderate retirement effects\nfor parent\u00adchild dyads living within 10 miles of each\nother (Table 2, model 2). Mothers' retirement seems\nto lead to a decline in visits primarily if they have\nfour or more children outside the household. In con-\ntrast, fathers are particularly prone to increase con-\ntacts after retirement if they have four or more chil-\ndren, whereas fathers of one or two children outside\nthe household tend to have fewer post-retirement vis-\nits with these children. Among parent-child dyads\nliving more than 10 miles apart, number of children\ndoes not moderate retirement effects.\nDiscussion\nOur analyses were guided by the assumption that\ncontacts with adult children may help retirees com-\npensate for the loss of social contacts at work and\nprovide them with identity-enhancing activities in the\nroles of parent and grandparent. We further hypoth-\nesized that such social and identity-enhancing oppor-\ntunities may be curtailed by geographical distance\nand time constraints.\nOur results suggest that retirement has some effect\non visits between parents and their adult children,\nwhereas telephone contacts seem to be unaffected by\nparents' retirement. That we find no retirement ef-\nfects on telephone contacts is hardly surprising. Tele-\nphone contacts are less likely to be constrained by\nparents' employment, and they also are unlikely to\ncompensate for loss of the work role.

Only parameter estimates for pertinent variables and interaction terms are shown in the Table. However, the shown parameters\nare from a full model that includes controls for race, parents' limitations in activities of daily living at time 2, parents' work hours at\ntime 1, change in income, change in health, change in distance, change in marital status (parents and children), change in spouse's em-\nployment, children's age, children's relationship to spouse (own or stepchild), and change in number of household members.

Based on parent\u00adchild dyads where children lived outside the parents' household at\nboth waves of the National Survey on Families and Households. Excluded were parents who receive care from a child. All parents were\nemployed 10 hours or more at baseline and age 55\u00ad75 at time 2. Complete tables with the full estimated models and standard errors are\navailable from the first author.\nbModel 1 includes interactions with children's gender, model 2 includes interactions with number of children outside the household,\nand model 3 includes interactions with length of retirement. All interactions contribute significantly to model fit.\ntionships, we expected retirement to have only a\nmodest impact on visits with children living more\nthan 10 miles from their parents. This hypothesis\nwas partially supported: Retirement effects occur\nforemost among parent\u00adchild dyads living close to\neach other. However, consideration of the child's\nparental status somewhat modifies this conclusion.\nAmong mothers, the grandparent role seems to over-\nride potential employment-related constraints, lead-\ning to fairly constant contacts over the retirement\ntransition with adult children who are themselves\nparents. On the other hand, mothers' contacts with\ndistant childless children decline after retirement,\nsuggesting that such contacts have little appeal to\nmothers as a post-retirement endeavor or that child-\nless children are particularly uninterested in contacts\nwith retired mothers. The opposite holds for fathers'\ncontacts with distant children, that is, after retire-\nment they visit slightly more with childless children\nand slightly less with children who are parents. As\nthese differences are fairly small, they must be inter-\npreted with caution. Perhaps retired fathers obtain\nmore gratification from adult-to-adult contacts with\nchildren than from greater involvement in a distant\ngrandparent role.\nChanges in post-retirement visits with children liv-\ning nearby vary by child's gender, as well as by par-\nents' gender, length of retirement, and number of\nchildren. To the extent that retired parents increase\ncontacts with nearby children at all, such increases\nseem to occur primarily with daughters. This finding\ncontradicts our assumption that retired parents may\nseek out activities with same-sex children. It might\nindicate that daughters are more inclined than sons\nto accommodate retired parents' needs for enhanced\ncontacts. It is also conceivable, however, that con-\ntacts with daughters (who may be more socialized to-\nward maintaining close relations with parents and\nmore attuned to parents' needs) are more gratifying\nto retirees.\nParents' gender and length of retirement jointly in-\nfluence contacts with children living within 10 miles\nof the parent. Contrary to our hypothesis, retired\nmothers tend to spend less and retired fathers more\ntime with children than their employed counterparts.\nFor mothers, this trend seems to become more pro-\nnounced with length of retirement and number of\nchildren, whereas it is fairly stable for fathers. We at-\ntribute this difference to the gendered division of la-\nbor throughout men's and women's working years.\nEmployed mothers typically carry the main burden\nof family work, leaving them little time to engage in\ncontrast, men are less involved in kin work (Anto-\nespecially employed men devote little time to other\nfamily work such as household activities or child\ncare (Ferree, 1991). This means that men and women\nenter retirement under quite different circumstances.\nRetired men may very well feel that they neglected\ncontacts with their children while working and use\ntheir extra time to \"catch up\" when opportunity al-\nlows (i.e., when the children live nearby). Retired\nwomen, on the other hand, will usually have main-\ntained close ties with their children throughout their\nworking years and may feel less of a need to reestab-\nlish a close relationship. In retirement they may see\ntheir first opportunity to engage in personal leisure\nactivities. As the trend toward reduced contacts is\nmost prominent among women with several chil-\ndren, it may reflect special needs for personal leisure\namong women who had been heavily burdened by\nmultiple responsibilities. Furthermore, married women\noften take charge of the couple's retirement activities\n(Keating & Cole, 1980), and this responsibility may\ndetract from their increasing contacts with adult chil-\ndren. It is also possible that children are particularly\namenable to enhance contacts with retired fathers,\nwith whom they probably had fewer contacts in the\npast. Contacts with retired mothers, on the other\nhand, may lack novelty, and mothers' attempts to en-\nhance contacts may be perceived as an imposition by\nWe further hypothesized that time constraints\nmay inhibit enhanced contacts with children after re-\ntirement. We find no support for the assumption that\nchildren's employment would moderate the impact\nof retirement. The second predicted constraint, num-\nber of children, does moderate retirement effects on\ncontacts but not in the expected direction. Retired fa-\nthers are particularly likely to enhance contacts with\nnearby children if they have four or more children,\nwhereas retired mothers' tendency to decrease con-\ntacts with nearby children prevails among mothers\nwith four or more children outside the household.\nFor mothers of multiple children, gratifications de-\nrived from the parent role may be saturated, and\nthey may consequently seek other endeavors in re-\ntirement. The finding for fathers could reflect multi-\nple opportunities, that is, fathers with several adult\nchildren have more opportunity for contacts and ap-\nparently take advantage of this opportunity. It is also\nconceivable that fathers of multiple children are\nmore kin-oriented than men with fewer children and\nthus more inclined to gear retirement activities to-\nward contacts with their children.\nTaken together, our findings indicate that retired\nparents' contacts with their adult children depend on\nselected parent and child characteristics. This sug-\ngests that both parents' and children's expectations\nand wishes, as well as selected constraints (especially\ngeographical distance), impinge on parents' post-\nretirement contacts with their children. As we lack\ndata on either parents' or children's desired contact\nfrequency, we cannot establish whether the observed\npatterns reflect either party's wishes or what type of\ncompromises parents and children reach. For exam-\nple, retired mothers may decrease contacts with chil-\ndren to pursue other endeavors, or their children\nmay reduce contacts to avoid potential imposition by\nretired mothers. If retirees' expectations are not met,\nthey may be forced to amend their plans for post-\nretirement activities. Some parents may also exert\npressure on their children to meet their expectations.\nEither scenario is likely to kindle conflicts between\nretired parents and their children.\nIt is also important to note that, although all dis-\ncussed interactions effects are significant and con-\ntribute significantly to model fit, the observed differ-\nences in contact frequency are quite small, suggesting\nconsiderable continuity in parent\u00adchild contacts over\nthe retirement transition. This would suggest that\npost-retirement contacts with children have only lim-\nited importance as a source for retirees' social con-\ntact and identity enhancement needs. This finding is\nin line with earlier research suggesting that retirees\nderive more satisfaction from contacts with friends\nthan from contacts with relatives (Dorfman, Heck-\nert, Hill, & Kohout, 1988). It is only under special\nconditions that parents seek fulfillment of such needs\nthrough contacts with their children. Furthermore,\nour analyses, based on all parent\u00adadult child dyads,\nessentially provide a weighted (by family size) aver-\nage of contacts for parents who have more than one\nadult child. Thus, it is quite possible that retired par-\nents simultaneously increase contacts with one child\nand decrease contacts with another. Such selective\nchanges in contacts with specific children are re-\nflected in relationships pertaining to child character-\nistics but not in relationships pertaining to parent\ncharacteristics.\nOur findings may also be subject to methodologi-\ncal and data limitations. We lack indicators for some\nkey variables (e.g., a direct measure of kin salience)\nand have rather poor measures for other indicators\n(e.g., affectional solidarity). Indeed, our failure to\nfind a moderating effect of perceived closeness on\npost-retirement contacts most likely can be attrib-\nuted to measurement quality and the very skewed\ndistribution of the closeness variable (most parents\nreported feeling extremely close to their children). In\nview of these caveats, further research is clearly\nneeded. Most important would be comparisons of\nexpectations and aspirations for post-retirement con-\ntacts on the part of parents and children, and assess-\nment of the implementation of such expectations af-\nter retirement. Future studies should also explore\nretirement effects on other dimensions of intergener-\national solidarity and further subgroup variations in\nretirement effects (e.g., by race).\nDespite their limitations, our findings lend them-\nselves to some recommendations for retirement plan-\nners and family counselors. They suggest that gender-\nstereotyped expectations about men's and women's\npost-retirement activities (women will spend time with\nkids, men will go to the golf course) may not fit reality.\nSimilarly, we find little support for the bumper-sticker\nnotion that retired parents will leave their children be-\nhind and devote their retirement leisure exclusively to\nnonfamily pursuits. Retired parents do keep in close\ntouch with their adult children. Thus, retirement plan-\nners and family counselors need not be concerned that\nretirees will \"abandon\" their children. Rather, concern\nshould be directed toward the implementation of real-\nistic plans for post-retirement kin relationships and to-\nward both generations' ability to compromise on a\nlevel of contact that meets parents' and children's ex-\npectations and needs.\nREFERENCES\nAiken, L.
