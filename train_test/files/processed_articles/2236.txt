First, it is not\nclear whether the association between anxiety disor-\nders and substance dependence applies to any anxiety\ndisorder, or whether it is specific only to some anxiety\ndisorders. Second, it is not known whether the rela-\ntion between anxiety disorders and substance depen-\ndence persists independent of the effects of comorbid\ndepression and alcohol use disorders. Third, it has\nnot been investigated whether the onset of anxiety\ndisorders tends to precede the onset of substance\ndependence, whether substance dependence occurs\nprior to the onset of anxiety disorders in the general\npopulation.\nAgainst this background, the goal of the current\ninvestigation is to examine the relation between\nanxiety disorders and substance dependence among\nadults in the community. First, the study will deter-\nmine the cross-sectional association between anxiety\ndisorders and substance dependence (current and\nlifetime) among adults in the community. Second,\nthe study will examine the relation between specific\nanxiety disorders and the odds of substance depen-\ndence, adjusting for the effects of depression and\nalcohol dependence. Third, the study will examine\nthe relation between a history of anxiety disorders\n(which are not current) and the odds of current sub-\nstance dependence in order to identify patterns of the\ntemporal sequence of onset of anxiety disorders and\nsubstance dependence. We hypothesized that anxiety\ndisorders would be associated with increased likeli-\nhood of substance dependence, independent of the\neffects of depression and alcohol use dependence. In\naddition, we anticipated that the onset of anxiety\ndisorders would precede the onset of substance\ndependence in the majority of cases.\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe National Comorbidity Survey is based on a\nnational probability sample (n = 5, 788) of individu-\nals aged 15\u00ad54 in the non-institutionalized US\npopulation.25 Fieldwork was carried out between Sep-\nresponse rate. The data were weighted for differential\nprobabilities of selection and non-response. A weight\nwas also used to adjust the sample to approximate the\ncross-classification of the population distribution on\na range of sociodemographic characteristics.

Next, sociodemographic\ncharacteristics and comorbid alcohol dependence\nPsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences \u00a9 2013 Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology\nand major depression were included in the model.\nThe same procedure was used to examine the asso-\nciation between history of anxiety disorders (having\nlifetime anxiety disorders, but not current) and\ncurrent drug dependence, and between history of\ndrug dependence and current anxiety disorders.\nAdjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals\nwere computed.\nRESULTS\nAssociation between anxiety disorders and\nsubstance dependence\nAssociation between lifetime anxiety disorders\nand lifetime drug dependence\nEach anxiety disorder was associated with a signifi-\ncantly increased likelihood of drug dependence,\nwhich persisted after adjusting for differences in\nsociodemographic characteristics, alcohol depen-\ndence and major depression (see Table 1).\nSequence of onset of drug dependence and\nanxiety disorders\nOnset of substance dependence occurred sequentially\nprior to the onset of anxiety disorder in a majority of\ncases among those with panic attacks, agoraphobia,\nGAD, and PTSD (see Table 2). Among those with\nspecific phobia and drug dependence, there seemed\nalmost an equal distribution of first onset, and social\nphobia appeared to have onset prior to drug depen-\ndence in the majority of cases. In more than 50% of\nsocial phobia cases, in nearly 40% of PTSD cases, and\nin nearly 30% of GAD cases, the onset of the anxiety\ndisorder was first.\nAssociation between history of anxiety\ndisorders and current drug dependence\nHistory of each anxiety disorder, with the exception\nof panic disorder, was associated with a significantly\nTable 1.

These results suggest that for any par-\nticular anxiety disorder, comorbid substance use\ndisorders may have an earlier onset and possibly con-\ntribute to the pathogenesis of anxiety symptoms, or\ncomorbid substance dependence can have a later\nonset perhaps reflecting the outcome of behaviors\nassociated with an attempt to self-medicate anxiety\nsymptoms. The data here also provide evidence\nfor: (i) strong lifetime associations between specific\nanxiety disorders and substance dependence among\nadults in the community; (ii) the possibility that\nassociations between specific disorders are indepen-\ndent of the influence of demographic characteristics\nand comorbid major depression and alcohol depen-\ndence; and (iii) the specificity of associations\nbetween particular anxiety disorders and substance\ndependence.\nTable 3.

While there is\ngrowing awareness amongst clinicians of obtaining\nan alcohol history in all patients with anxiety disor-\nders, and of determining a history of mood and\nanxiety disorders in all patients with alcohol depen-\ndence, there is perhaps less focus on other substances\nin clinical assessment of patients presenting with\nanxiety disorders. Substance abuse and dependence\nare stigmatized conditions, and may be underre-\nported especially upon initial presentation as well as\nbeing overshadowed by more clinically obvious\ncomorbid mood symptoms. As such, this may con-\ntribute to the relative underdiagnosis and undertreat-\nment of anxiety disorders among persons with\ncomorbid substance dependence, despite its preva-\nlence. In fact, reviewing literature on treatment of\npatients with comorbid anxiety and substance use\ndisorders shows that there is relatively little evidence\nof specific treatments for both disorders.\nThe strongest association between past substance\ndependence and current anxiety disorder was\nobserved in panic disorder. This finding is consistent\nwith the frequent observation that panic disorder can\nbe precipitated or exacerbated by substance use or\nwithdrawal.31\u00ad33 It is also consistent with current\nunderstandings of the neurobiology of panic attacks.\nThis theory suggests that panic attacks are under-\npinned by a distributed neurocircuitry involving the\namygdala that may be sensitized or activated by a\nrange of different stressors, including changes in\neither the external or internal milieu.34,35 While data\nhere cannot be used as evidence to confirm this\npathway, these results may be useful in pointing to\npatterns of specificity that may be fruitfully investi-\ngated in future, more detailed, studies.\nResults also showed associations between past sub-\nstance dependence and other current anxiety disor-\nders, such as social phobia. Withdrawal from regular\nsocial activities is commonly seen among individuals\nwho spend significant amounts of their time and\neffort on drug seeking and drug taking. There may\nalso be more direct relations between substance\nabuse and social anxiety; for example, withdrawal of\na range of substances leads to decreased levels of\nstriatal D2 receptors, a finding that is also seen in\nsocial anxiety disorder patients.36,37 Speculatively,\nthere may be overlaps between the neurobiological\nsequelae of substance use or withdrawal, and the\nneural substrate of social anxiety. In addition, it is\nconceivable that use of substances may begin as an\nattempt to self-medicate feelings of isolation and dis-\ntress related to lack of social relationships associated\nwith social anxiety.38,39 While only a minority of\ninstances of substance use lead to the development of\ndependence, it has been shown that social phobia is\nassociated with increased risk of development of sub-\nstance dependence, once substance use is initiated.\nFor instance, one study40 showed very high rates of\nnicotine dependence among those with social phobia\nwho initiated nicotine use (31.5%), compared with\nrates of nicotine dependence among those without\nsocial phobia (15.4%). As such, it may be that expo-\nsure to some substances and learning (through expo-\nsure) of the anxiety-relieving effects may lead to the\nonset of substance use among those with social\nphobia.\nOur findings also indicate that anxiety disorders\nmay contribute to the onset of substance depen-\ndence. While the cross-sectional nature of these data\nand lack of more detailed information on factors\ninfluencing onset do not permit conclusions based\non these data alone, the persistence of these associa-\ntions after adjusting for differences in comorbid\ndepression and alcohol use disorders suggest that the\nlink is not purely attributable to comorbidity. This is\nconsistent with growing evidence emphasizing the\nrelatively early onset of anxiety disorders and associ-\nated vulnerability to later comorbid disorders. In\nmore than 50% of social phobia cases, in nearly 40%\nof PTSD cases, and in nearly 30% of GAD cases,\nanxiety disorders had first onset. Similarly, a lifetime\nhistory of social phobia, PTSD, or GAD significantly\npredicted lifetime substance dependence, an associa-\ntion that was strongest for PTSD. Furthermore, the\ngreater the number of lifetime anxiety disorders, the\nhigher the risk for past and for current substance\ndependence.\nSeveral limitations of this study should be empha-\nsized. First, as noted above, the cross-sectional nature\nof the dataset does not allow inferences about the\ncausality or mechanisms of these observed associa-\ntions. Second, participants were aged 15\u00ad54 only,\ntherefore these results are not generalizable to other\nage groups. Third, we were unable to analyze the data\naccording to specific type of substance with confi-\ndence (mainly due to small cell size; e.g. benzodiaz-\nepines); future work needs to explore also the specific\nrelations between specific substance use disorders\nand the range of anxiety disorders. Replication in a\nPsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences \u00a9 2013 Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology\nlarger national dataset, such as the National Epide-\nmiologic Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions\n(NESARC), may be informative. Fourth, while these\nresults are generalizable to the USA, they may not be\nrelevant to other countries.\nNevertheless, these data provide preliminary evi-\ndence on the potential significance in emphasizing\nspecific associations between particular anxiety disor-\nders and substance dependence. These findings have\nclear clinical implications, including the need to\nmaintain a reasonable level of suspicion for anxiety\ndisorders in patients with substance use disorders,\nand the need for early detection and robust interven-\ntion for anxiety disorders in order to help prevent\nsubsequent morbidity. Further research is needed to\ninvestigate the precise mechanisms, which account\nfor the temporal relations apparent in this dataset,\nand to extend the work to include the range of spe-\ncific substance use disorders.\n"
