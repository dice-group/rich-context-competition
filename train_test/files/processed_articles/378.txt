Although recommenda-\ntions for screening young adults without risk factors for coronary heart disease\n(CHD) differ, all guidelines recommend screening adults with CHD, CHD equiva-\nlents, or 1 or more CHD risk factors. This study examined national prevalence\nof CHD risk factors and compliance with the cholesterol screening guidelines\namong young adults.\nMETHODS National estimates were obtained using results for 2,587 young adults\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. We defined high low-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as levels higher than the goal specific for each\nCHD risk category outlined in the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult\nTreatment Panel III guidelines.\nRESULTS About 59% of young adults had CHD or CHD equivalents, or 1 or more\nof the following CHD risk factors: family history of early CHD, smoking, hyper-\ntension, or obesity. In our study, the overall screening rate in this population was\nless than 50%. Moreover, no significant difference in screening rates between\nyoung adults with no risk factors and their counterparts with 1 or more risk fac-\ntors was found even after adjustment for sociodemographic and health care fac-\ntors. Approximately 65% of young adults with CHD or CHD equivalents, 26% of\nyoung adults with 2 or more risk factors, 12% of young adults with 1 risk factor,\nand 7% with no risk factor had a high level of LDL-C.\nCONCLUSIONS CHD risk factors are common in young adults but do not appear\nto alter screening rates. Improvement of risk assessment and management for\ncardiovascular disease among young adults is warranted.\nINTRODUCTION\nAn abnormal lipid profile is a highly common but modifiable risk fac-\ntor for coronary heart disease (CHD), a leading cause of mortality\nin the United States. The importance of screening for identifica-\ntion and clinical management of dyslipidemia is recognized by several\nprofessional associations and public health organizations.1,2 The National\nCholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP\nIII), endorsed by the American Heart Association and the National Heart,\nLung, and Blood Institute, recommends universal screening for high cho-\nlesterol levels beginning at age 20 years.2 The US Preventive Services\nTask Force (USPSTF) advocates a targeted cholesterol screening approach\nfor young adults (men aged 20 to 35 years and women aged 20 to\nElena V.

The USPSTF recommends screening young\nadults with CHD, CHD equivalents (other forms of\natherosclerotic vascular disease, diabetes, or CHD risk\nof 20% or greater within 10 years), or 1 or more CHD\nrisk factors (high blood pressure, smoking, family his-\ntory, and obesity).1 There are no specific USPSTF rec-\nommendations for persons who do not have CHD risk\nfactors. Thus although screening guidelines vary, there\nis agreement concerning the need to screen young\nadults who are at increased risk of CHD.\nPrevious reports based on the Behavioral Risk Fac-\ntor Surveillance System data indicated a low screening\nUS adults aged 20 to 44 years had had their choles-\nterol levels checked in the preceding 5 years, com-\nand 65 years and older, respectively.3 Although the\nuse of drug therapy to treat high levels of low-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) may be indicated\nin a small proportion of young adults, therapeutic\nlifestyle changes would be sufficient to manage high\nLDL-C among most young adults.2 Data on compli-\nance with cholesterol-screening guidelines among\nyoung adults and the prevalence of high LDL-C are\nscarce, however. This study, which relied on data for\nExamination Survey (NHANES) of young adults (men\nhad 3 objectives to determine: (1) the proportion of\npersons with CHD, CHD equivalents, or CHD risk\nfactors; (2) rates of the self-reported screening for high\ncholesterol levels that had been performed before the\nstudy; and (3) the prevalence of high LDL-C levels\nthat had been assessed by a fasting lipid testing during\nMETHODS\nStudy Participants\nNHANES is a continuous survey of the health and\nnutritional status of the US civilian, noninstitutional-\nized population; participants are selected through a\ncomplex, multistage probability design.4 Each year,\napproximately 6,000 participants are selected to par-\nticipate in the study. Persons who agree to participate\nare first interviewed in their homes about their health,\ndisease history, and diet. All interviewed participants\nare invited to a local Mobile Exam Center for adminis-\ntration of additional questionnaires, physical examina-\ntions, and laboratory tests. NHANES data are released\nin 2-year increments; the present analysis was con-\nducted with data from the 4 most recent study cycles:\nThe overall response rates for completed examinations\namong all screened participants for the study cycles\nrespectively. In this study, to increase the sample size\nand analytic options, data from the 4 study cycles were\ncombined into 1 data set.\nor more hours (up to 24 hours) for laboratory testing.\nAs did the other subsamples, the fasting subsample has\nits own designated weight, which takes into account\nthe complex survey design, survey nonresponse, and\npoststratification in representing the US civilian, non-\ninstitutionalized census population. After exclusion of\n35 years or older, or women 45 years or older, our\nstudy sample consisted of 3,212 participants. Women\nwho had a positive urine pregnancy test or who\nreported that they were pregnant (n=462), as well as\nparticipants with missing lipid profile data or blood\npressure data (n=163), were excluded, leaving an ana-\nAssessment of CHD Risk Factors\nParticipants with a self-reported history of CHD\n(angina or myocardial infarction) were identified as\nparticipants with CHD. Those participants with self-\nreported stroke or diabetes and those with fasting\nblood glucose levels of 126 mg/dL or higher were iden-\ntified as participants with CHD equivalents.\nWe examined the following 4 CHD risk factors\nthat according to the USPSTF guidelines should be\nused to determine the eligibility for cholesterol screen-\ning in young adults: (1) cigarette smoking (self-reported\nsmoking every day or some days); (2) hypertension\n(the average of 3 blood pressure measurements from\nthe NHANES physical examination at or exceeding\n140/90 mm Hg, or self-reported current use of antihy-\npertensive medication); (3) family history of premature\nCHD (angina or myocardial infarction) in a first-\ndegree relative younger than 50 years; and (4) obesity\n(a body mass index of 30 or greater that was calculated\nas weight in kilograms divided by the square of the\nheight in meters).\nAssessment and Definition of Screening Status\nThe cholesterol screening rates were estimated based\non the self-reported screening that took place before\nour study. Participants were asked whether they had\never had their blood cholesterol levels checked and\nhow long it had been since their last cholesterol\ntest. Screening was dichotomized as either (1) never\nscreened or screened 5 or more years ago or (2)\nscreened within the last 5 years.\nLipid Measurements\nand Definition of High\nLDL-C Levels\nWe categorized LDL-C levels\nbased on the ATP III risk catego-\nries and goals for therapeutic life-\nstyle changes and drug therapy\n(Table 1), and we defined high\nLDL-C levels as levels above the\ngoal for each risk category. The\ngroup of participants with high\nLDL-C levels included those who\nwere eligible for therapeutic life-\nstyle change and drug therapy.\nDetails on the classification of\nthe study participants into the\n3 ATP III risk categories (high,\nintermediate, and low) are pub-\nlished elsewhere.5\nFor all lipid analyses, fro-\nzen venous serum samples were\nshipped on dry ice to the Lipo-\nprotein Analytical Laboratory\nat the Johns Hopkins University\nHospital, Baltimore, Maryland.6\nMethods for determining total\ncholesterol, high-density lipopro-\ntein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride levels for\nwhere.5 LDL-C values were calculated from measured\nvalues of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL-C\naccording to the Friedewald calculation. All lipid mea-\nsurements were standardized through the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention\u00adNational Heart, Lung,\nand Blood Institute Lipid Standardization Program.7\nAssessment and Definition of\nSociodemographic Characteristics\nInformation on race/ethnicity, health insurance cov-\nerage, education, income, and health care visits was\nobtained by using a structured questionnaire. Race/\nethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, Mexican American, and others. The\nothers group included multiple race and other Hispanic.\nBecause the sample was designed to provide estimates\nfor non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexi-\ncan American populations of the United States, we\nincluded the others group in the analysis but did not\nreport estimates for this group because of its small sam-\nple size, heterogeneity, and nonrepresentative nature.\nParticipants were classified as insured if they\nreported having private insurance, Medicaid, or Civil-\nian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed\nServices (CHAMPUS)/Veterans Affairs insurance. The\npoverty index ratio (total family income divided by\nthe poverty threshold index adjusted for family size,\ncomposition, and location at year of interview) was\ncategorized numerically according to the following\ndescriptions: low (1 or less: family income is less than\nor equal to the poverty threshold index), medium (2 to\n3: family income is 2 to 3 times as high as the poverty\nthreshold index); and high (more than 3: family income\nis more than 3 times as high as the poverty threshold\nindex). Health care access was assessed by responses to\nthe question, \"During the past 12 months, how many\ntimes have you seen a doctor or other health care pro-\nfessional about your health at a doctor's office, a clinic,\nhospital emergency room, at home or some other\nplace?\" Participants' responses were grouped into 4 cat-\nData Analysis\nEstimated population prevalence and standard errors\nwere calculated using SUDAAN statistical software\nto account for nonresponse and the complex sampling\ndesign.8 The significance of a difference in preva-\nlence was assessed by 2 test.8 Adjustment for multiple\ncomparisons was made using the Bonferroni method.9\nOrthogonal polynomial coefficients that are calculated\nrecursively according to the method of Fisher and\nYates were used for testing linear trends.8\nTable 1.

Electronic 10-year risk calculators are available at http://www.nhlbi.\nnih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol.\nf Almost all persons with 1 risk factor have a 10-year risk <10%; thus, a 10-year risk assessment is unnecessary.\nBecause the prevalence of screening was less than\n50%, Cox regression was used to calculate prevalence\nproportion ratios and their 95% confidence intervals\n(CIs) to examine the association between screening\nand the predictors. Although Cox regression is used\nto estimate the cumulative incidence ratio for longitu-\ndinal data, it also can be used to estimate the preva-\nlence proportion ratio for cross-sectional data when\na risk period is constant (each observation has equal\nRESULTS\nTable 2 shows the distribution of sociodemographic\ncharacteristics and risk categories in the population of\ninterest.

A higher proportion of women had medical\ncare 1 or more times during the last 12 months (87%\nvs 65%, P <.05) when compared with men.

The rate of screening for high\ncholesterol levels among persons with CHD or a CHD\nequivalent was less than 70% but was significantly\nhigher than the screening rate for persons with no risk\nfactors. Adjustment for sociodemographic characteris-\ntics in multivariate Cox regression models had only a\nsmall effect on screening rates by number of CHD risk\nfactors regardless of sex.\nTable 4 shows the prevalence of high LDL-C levels.\nPrevalence increased with the number of the CHD\nrisk factors; 6.7% of persons with no risk factors had\nhigh LDL-C levels compared with 25.9% of those\nwith 2 or more risk factors. The highest prevalence of\nhigh LDL-C levels (65.1%) was found among persons\nwith CHD or a CHD equivalent. The prevalence of\nhigh LDL-C levels among young adults without CHD\nrisk factors was 10.1% and 4.6% for men and women,\nrespectively. Similar to the cholesterol screening,\nadjustment for sociodemographic characteristics in\nmultivariate Cox regression models had only a small\neffect on prevalence of high LDL-C levels by number\nof CHD risk factors regardless of sex.\nDISCUSSION\nmately 65% of young adults with CHD or a CHD\nequivalent, 26% of young adults with 2 or more risk\nfactors, 12% of young adults with 1 risk factor, and\n7% with no CHD risk factors had a high LDL-C level.\nScreening, however, for high blood cholesterol levels\nin young adults, except for persons with CHD or a\nCHD equivalent, was low: about 50% for women and\nless than 40% for men. The age and sex disparities\nin the use of preventive services have been reported\nbefore. For example, the screening rate increases as a\nfunction of age at the population level,11 and younger\nmen are significantly less likely than younger women\nto receive certain preventive services.12 In our study,\nno significant difference was found in screening rates\nTable 3.

Because the severity of atherosclerosis in young\nadults increases with the number of risk factors,13-15 the\nlow screening rates, particularly among young persons\nwith 2 or more risk factors, are of concern. A tendency\nfor more ambulatory care visits has been proposed\nas a factor explaining higher screening rates among\nyoung women than among young men.12 The efficiency\nof population-based approaches in the prevention of\nCHD is not well studied.16 The American Heart Asso-\nciation (AHA) supports public screenings that \"meet\nacceptable criteria for recruitment, reliability of mea-\nsurement of cholesterol levels, appropriate educational\ninformation, properly trained staff and referral.\" The\nAHA recognized that small-scale screening at work\nsites, schools, churches, community centers, or neigh-\nborhood clinics have potential for identifying high-\nrisk individuals. The AHA states, however, that the\nintegration of community screening programs into the\nmedical care system is important to ensure test results\ninterpretation and follow-up by the physician responsi-\nble for the patient's care.17 Future studies are needed to\nidentify how cholesterol screening among young adults\ncan be improved in primary care settings.\nIn our study, about 59% of young adults as defined\nby NCEP screening guidelines (men aged 20 to 35\nyears and women aged 20 to 45 years) had CHD, a\nCHD equivalent, or 1 or more of the following risk\nfactors: family history of early CHD, smoking, hyper-\ntension, or obesity. Our results also support the need\nto improve assessment and management of cardiovas-\ncular disease risk factors among young adults. Because\ntherapeutic lifestyle changes are indicated more often\nthan is drug therapy for young adults, clinical manage-\nment of risk factors in this group may be challenging.\nHealth care clinicians perceive limited time, lack of\nskills, inadequate reimbursement, and difficulties in\npatient adherence to lifestyle changes as barriers to\neffective counseling.18\nThese concerns notwithstanding, preventive efforts\nfocused on decreasing the number of CHD risk fac-\ntors may be essential for preventing CHD later in life\nand reducing the burden of CHD at the national level.\nIndeed, as has been shown by results from NHANES\nIII among white, non-Hispanic persons aged 35 to 74\nyears, only a small proportion of CHD events (about\n10%) occur among persons with isolated risk fac-\ntors and LDL-C levels at which drug therapy is not\nindicated.19 Thus, the American Medical Association\n(AMA) promotes counseling on health behavior in\nclinical practice by advocating full insurance coverage\nfor counseling for smoking and nicotine dependence,\nalcohol consumption, healthy diet, and physical activ-\nity among adults.20 Meanwhile, the AMA suggests\nincorporating a routine that \"requires minimal time,\nreinforces the importance of the key health behav-\niors, and refers patients to community resources as\nnecessary.\"20 As with clinical counseling, not all com-\nmunity-based lifestyle interventions have been found\nto be effective in the prevention of CHD, but some\ninterventions show promising results.21 For example, in\na study by Roux and colleagues,22 community-based\ninterventions to promote physical activity appeared to\nsubstantially reduce incidence of CHD over a lifetime\nsive analysis of the available prevention strategies\nmight serve as a foundation for improving current and\nfuture prevention efforts in young adults.\nResults reported in this study should be interpreted\nwith the following limitations in mind. First, a misclas-\nsification bias is possible in our study. The NHANES\nquestion on family history of heart attack or angina\nasks about first-degree relatives younger than 50 years\nregardless of sex instead of using 55 years for men and\n65 years for women, ages proposed by the NCEP ATP\nIII. Thus, some participants may be inappropriately\nplaced in the low-risk rather than in the intermedi-\nate- or high-risk category. Second, the proportion of\nparticipants with CHD or a CHD equivalent may be\nunderestimated in our study because of lack of data on\nperipheral vascular disease, symptomatic carotid artery\ndisease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. Our study,\nhowever, focused on young adults for whom the preva-\nlence of these conditions is known to be low.23 Finally,\nalthough the collection and examination of laboratory\ndata were standardized, self-reported data from inter-\nviews and questionnaires may be subject to misunder-\nstanding and recall bias.\nThe findings in this study suggest approximately\ntwo-thirds of all young adults have 1 or more cardio-\nvascular risk factors. Among young adults, we found\nthat the prevalence of high cholesterol levels increased\nwith the number of CHD risk factors, but the choles-\nterol screening rate was less than 50% regardless of\nrisk status. Our results indicate that improvement of\nrisk assessment and management for cardiovascular\ndisease among young adults through evidence-based\nclinical and public health interventions is warranted.\nTo develop and implement these interventions success-\nfully, a comprehensive analysis of the currently avail-\nable prevention strategies is needed.\nTo read or post commentaries in response to this article, see it\nonline at http://www.annfammed.org/cgi/content/full/8/4/327.\n",
