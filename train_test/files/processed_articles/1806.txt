Annual samples\nare selected using a complex, stratified, multistage prob-\nability \nsampling method and the data are released in 2-year\ncycles.17 This report is based on 6 years of data collection\nSurvey participants were interviewed in their homes and\nexamined in mobile examination centers. Descriptions of the\nsample design and data collection methods are available at the\nNHANES website.18 The National Center for Health Statistics\nEthics Review Board approved all survey protocols. Informed\nconsent was obtained from all participants and persons who\nwere examined received remuneration.\n(70%) were also examined. As many as 755 persons did not\nhave BP data, yielding a final analytic sample of 13,458. The\nsample included 4,816 hypertensive individuals.\narticles Unaware and Uncontrolled Hypertensives in the United States\nOutcome. Hypertension and hypertension categories.\nHypertension status was based on mean BP derived from up\nto three separate BP measurements that were obtained during\na single examination. BP was measured at the mobile exami-\nnation center by physicians who followed a standardized pro-\ntocol.18\u00ad20 Three hypertension outcomes were defined as (i)\nthe proportion of all hypertensives who were unaware, (ii) the\nproportion of aware hypertensives who were untreated, and\n(iii) the proportion of treated hypertensives whose hyperten-\nsion was uncontrolled. See Table 1 for detailed definitions of\noutcome measures.\nDemographic characteristics. Self-reported age, race/\nethnicity,\neducation attainment, and income were included in the analy-\nwere compared: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and\nMexican American. Data for the \"other races\" group, including\npersons who reported \"multiple races\" and \"other Hispanic\"\npersons were included in the total sample results but are not\nreported separately. Education attainment was categorized\nas: less than high school, high school/General Educational\nDevelopment, and more than high school education. Income\nstatus was based on the PIR, an index of family income that\naccounts for family size. Families that have PIR values below\n1.00 have incomes that are below the official poverty thresh-\nold and PIR values of 1.00 are above the poverty level (U.S.\nOther covariates. Height in centimeters and weight in kilo-\ngrams were measured using a standardized protocol. Three\nbody mass index (BMI) groups were formed using the cri-\nteria established by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood\nInstitute, National Institutes of Health: normal weight (BMI\n30kg/m2).21 Responses to the medical conditions section of\nthe NHANES household interview were used to establish\n\nhistory of risk \nfactors.18 A participant was defined as \"dia-\nbetic\" if they reported they had ever been told by a doctor\nthat they had diabetes. History of CVD was ascertained by\nresponses to questions about congestive heart failure, coro-\nnary heart disease, angina, heart attack, or stroke. The num-\nber of CVD conditions for each individual was summed and\nvalues ranged from zero to three or more conditions reported.\nFamily history of hypertension, stroke, heart attack, or angina\nwas obtained from the family health history questions (mul-\ntiple choice questions).\nHealth insurance availability was established using informa-\ntion from the health insurance section of the NHANES family\nquestionnaire. The number of health care visits in the last year\nwas based on responses to the Health Utilization question-\nnaire section. The time since a BP reading was taken by a health\nprofessional was based on the responses to a question in the\nBP questionnaire section. Smoking status was ascertained by\nresponses to the smoking section of the household questionnaire\nand participants were classified as never, former, and current\nsmokers. Smokers were defined as persons who had smoked\nat least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and were currently\nStatistical analyses. SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)\nwas used for data management and SUDAAN (RTI, Research\nTriangle Park, NC) was used for data analysis.\nAll analyses used the sample design weights for the examined\nsample, which account for unequal probabilities of selection\nand person-level non-response, and include poststratification\nadjustment to the estimated US population. The recommended\nmethod to derive 6-year examination sample weights was used.17\nA Taylor series linearization method in SUDAAN was used to\ncalculate s.e. and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Prevalences\nfor each of the hypertension outcomes were computed for each\ncovariate. Statistical testing was performed using paired t-tests\nwith an  level of <0.05 set as significant level.\nAdjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated using\nlogistic regression models for all of the outcomes. The independ-\nent associations of each covariate with the dependent variables\nwere determined. ORs having a 95% CI not including unity were\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nTable 2 presents the selected characteristics of individuals classi-\nfied as hypertensives who were unaware, aware and not treated,\nand treated but uncontrolled.\nAmong the unaware hypertensives a smaller percentage of\nwomen were unaware when compared with men (P < 0.05).\nCompared with reference (40\u00ad59 years), a greater propor-\nand less so adults aged 80 years and older (P < 0.05).

In contrast,\nindividuals with a family history of heart attack or angina had a\nlower percentage of uncontrolled hypertension when compared\nwith individuals with no such history. Compared with current\nsmokers, individuals categorized as never smoked or formerly\nsmoked had a higher percentage of uncontrolled hypertension\ndespite being treated (Table 2).\nThe adjusted ORs and CI for the three logistic regression mod-\nels are presented in Table 3.\nA number of covariates were significantly (P < 0.05) asso-\nciated with the likelihood of being unaware of hypertension,\nspecifically. Individuals aged 20\u00ad39 years were more likely to be\nunaware when compared with the reference group. Compared\nwith non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks were less likely\nto be unaware of their hypertension. Compared with individuals\nwith a BMI < 25, individuals with a greater BMI were less likely\nto be unaware of their hypertension. Compared with reference,\nself-reported diabetics, those with a family history of hyperten-\nsion or stroke, and the frequency of reporting CVD conditions\nwere associated with less likelihood of unawareness (Table 3).\nPersons who reported fewer healthcare visits were more likely\nto be unaware of their hypertension when compared with refer-\nence (10 visits) as were individuals who had not had their BP\nmeasured in the past 6 months.\nA number of covariates were significantly (P < 0.05) associ-\nated with the likelihood of not being treated yet aware of being\nhypertensive, specifically.

Persons\nwho had not had a BP measurement within the past 6 months\nwere more likely to be untreated compared with persons who\nhad BP measured <6 months ago.\nA number of covariates were significantly (P < 0.05) associ-\nated with hypertension control among the treated hypertensives,\nspecifically. Women, individuals aged 60 years and older, and\nnon-Hispanic blacks were less likely to control their hyper-\ntension when compared with reference (Table 3). The likeli-\nhood of uncontrolled hypertension was higher for individuals\nin the \nlowest income PIR <1 when compared with PIR > 4.\nSelf-reported diabetics were more likely to have uncontrolled\nhypertension. Compared with individuals who had 10 or more\nhealth care visits, individuals with less health care visits (two to\nthree) were more likely than not to control their hypertension.\nIndividuals who never smoked were more likely to have uncon-\ntrolled hypertension compared with individuals who reported\nsmoking currently.\nDiscussion\nWomen had less control of their hypertension when compared\nwith men after adjusting for other covariates. Aside from bio-\nlogical factors, some current research has shown that physicians\nsurveyed downgraded significantly the cardiovascular risk status\nof women compared with men, and were less likely to suggest\npreventative measures for women than men.22\u00ad23\nDespite Medicare availability for persons 65 years and older,\nlikely to have uncontrolled hypertension than 40\u00ad59 year olds.\nMoreover, individuals aged 80 years and older were more than\nthree times likely to have uncontrolled hypertension than\n40\u00ad59 year olds. Hajjar et al. surveyed a national sample of phy-\nsicians involved in geriatric care regarding geriatric hyperten-\nsion management. Fifty-eight percent of those surveyed stated\nthat they would not start pharmacological therapy if systolic BP\nPrevious reports suggested that Mexican Americans were\nmore unaware of hypertension when compared with non-\n\nHispanic whites.8,29 Similar results were obtained in our analysis\nwhen excluding family history of hypertension or stroke (OR\nhypertension in the model, this significance did not hold (see\nTable 3). Okonofua et al. reported that Hispanics were more\nlikely to perceive aging and stress as main factors contribut-\ning to hypertension and were less likely to agree that life style\nchanges such as decreased weight, alcohol and tobacco use are\nrelated to hypertension.12 It is possible that Mexican Americans\nview hypertension differently than non-Hispanic blacks and\nnon-Hispanic whites and therefore be less aware of it. However,\nwhen a family member has hypertension individual awareness\nmay become more sensitized to the diagnosis of hypertension.\nParenthetically, 29% of Mexican Americans reported a family\nhistory of hypertension or stroke.\nNon-Hispanic blacks were less likely to have controlled\nhypertension when treated compared with non-Hispanic\nwhites. Other population-based studies have reported similar\nresults.10\u00ad11 Howard et al. suggested three potential reasons\nfor these findings.12 First, there may be racial differences in\nthe aggressiveness of hypertension treatment or the quality\nof follow-up once treated. Second, genetics or lifestyle factors\nmay alter the response to pharmacological treatments. Third, it\nis possible that blacks find the side effects associated with the\ntreatment of hypertension unacceptable. Finally, there may be\nunidentified confounders that we have not identified that may\nexplain the differences in hypertension control.\nAlthough self-reported diabetics were less likely to be unaware\nand untreated, they were significantly less likely to control their\nhypertension. This finding is a cause for concern, considering\nthe synergy of diabetes and hypertension with incidence of CVD\nand stroke.3 We used a more stringent definition of hyperten-\nsion control in diabetics, recommended by JNC 7.3 Using the\ndefinition of BP control (BP < 140/90mmHg) resulted in non-\nof diagnosed diabetes has increased significantly over the last\ndecade adding urgency to the need to improve BP control in\nOur data suggest that the relationship between increased age\nand weight, individual risk factors, and family risk factors and\nhypertension are well understood by health care providers and\nthe public. In contrast, younger adults and individuals with no\nhistory of risk factors may be erroneously secured in believing\nthat hypertension cannot be their problem. Similar findings were\nreported by Asch et al.32\nA number of variables directly addressed health availability\nand utilization. After adjusting for all other covariates individu-\nals with no health insurance were two times more likely to be\nuntreated for hypertension. Likewise, not having BP measured\nin the past 6 months was associated with being unaware and\nuntreated. Also, the number of healthcare visits was associated\nwith lack of awareness. Poverty level maybe related to utiliza-\ntion of health care as individuals with low income were 68% less\nlikely to have controlled hypertension.\nThe limitations of this analysis include the fact that the cross-\nsectional design provides a one-time assessment of BP and the\nhypertension status of some individuals may be misclassified.\nSecond, self-reported interview data were used and the accu-\nracy of the information cannot be verified and may constitute a\nsource of error. Third, our definition of hypertension treatment\nonly included medication use. Alternative treatment modalities\nsuch as diet and exercise were not examined. However, ~70%\nof the individuals reported dieting or exercising besides taking\nmedications.\nIn general, the independent characteristics of individuals\nwho are unaware, not treated yet aware, and uncontrolled while\ntreated are similar yet different. The unaware individuals may\nhave one of the following characteristics: likely to be younger\n(20\u00ad39 years), reporting little history of hypertension related\nrisk factors, normal weight (BMI < 25), and limited utilization\nand exposure to health care. Similarly, individuals who are aware\nbut not treated may have one of the following characteristics:\nyounger (20\u00ad39 years), normal weight (BMI < 25), and have no\narticles\nUnaware and Uncontrolled Hypertensives in the United States\nhealth insurance. Finally, individuals who are pharmacologi-\ncally treated but not controlled may have one of the following\n\ncharacteristics: women, either old or very old, non-Hispanic\nblack, poor, have fewer health care visits, and never have smoked.\nOne goal of Healthy People 2010 is to achieve improved rates of\nhypertension control. These results provide information that\nmay be used for targeted \nintervention efforts.33\n"
