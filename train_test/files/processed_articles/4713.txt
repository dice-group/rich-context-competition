The findings that were\nmost controversial and most professionally relevant involved\nthe high EPPP scores of the traditional program graduates,\nwhich were especially obvious at both ends of the distribu-\ntion. The top of the distribution was dominated by traditional\nprograms and the bottom of the distribution was dominated\nby professional programs. The traditional programs were\nsuperior not only on the EPPP total score and the Research\nsubtests but also on the Diagnostic, Intervention, and\nProfessional/Ethics subtests (Templer & Tomeo, 2000).\nSubsequent research demonstrated that a salient difference\nThe findings are especially noteworthy to professional\nschools because they purport to produce a superior profes-\nsional product. Independent professional practice is not\npossible without passing the EPPP. Unfortunately for the\nimage of professional schools, their graduates tend not to\ndo well on other indicators of professional functioning.\nThey are less likely to be a diplomate in the American\nBoard of Professional Psychology (ABPP), less likely to be\npresident of state psychological associations, and less likely\nto be directors of theAssociation of Psychology Postdoctoral\nand Internship Centers (APPIC; Templer et al., 2000). The\ngenerally less satisfactory performance of professional\nschool graduates has led to the inference that there are two\ntiers of clinical training in the United States (Templer,\nThe present study went beyond the previous EPPP\nresearch comparing professional (Vail Model) and traditional\n(Boulder Model) clinical psychology graduates in two ways.\n(a) The Educational and Reporting Service had reported\nmean EPPP scores of programs and such was used in the\nprevious research.

The psychologist with a perfect EPPP score\nreceives the same license as the one who barely passes.\n(b) The previous research on the EPPP compared mean\nscores of professional and traditional graduates has actually\nattenuated the true differences because professional school\nmeans are based on a much larger N. The larger N is a func-\ntion of both professional schools graduating more students\nper program and because of having to take the EPPP again.\nIn the present study, we not only report pass/fail mean pro-\ngram rates but also consider the number of exam taken and\npassed/failed by the composite of professional programs and\ntraditional programs.\nMethod\nThe EPPP pass rate information was obtained from the\nAssociation of State and Professional Provincial Boards\nCanadian) and 63 professional (all American) programs.\nASPPB only included programs that had three or more exams.\nAn additional caveat is that pass is based on a score of 500,\nwhich is the passing score of the preponderance of states and\nprovinces. If one wishes to determine the exact pass rate of a\njurisdiction, one should communicate with that jurisdiction. It\nshould be borne in mind that N pertains to number of exams\ntaken and not necessarily the number of different graduates\nhaving taken the exam. That is, the number of exams taken\nincludes an unknown number of retakes. The Alliant/\nCalifornia School of Professional Psychology (CSPP)\u00ad\nBerkeley 11 exams were combined with the 268 Alliant/\nCSPP-Alameda graduates because there was a change in\nlocation but not program. Only straight clinical psychology\nprograms were included. Clinical-neuropsychology, clinical-\nhealth, clinical-ethnic minority, clinical-family child, clinical\npsychodynamic, combined clinical/counseling/school, clinical-\ncommunity, child-clinical, clinical school, combined profes-\nsional scientific, clinical psychology-health and medical,\nclinical psychology-law, physiological-developmental clini-\ncal, and adult-clinical were excluded. There were 31 pro-\ngrams excluded due to being combined with other areas in\ncontrast to 217 solely clinical programs whose data were\nanalyzed. It should be further noted that the American\nPsychological Association accredits not only clinical psy-\nchology programs but also counseling and school programs.\nThe latter two categories were not used because virtually all\nof the professional schools have clinical psychology pro-\ngrams, although some may have counseling and school\nelements.\nResults\nThe readers should bear I mind that the past pass/failure rates\npertain to the exams taken and not number of graduates. It is\nnot known whether a failure is for the 1st time the graduate\ntook the test or the 20th time. It is conceivable that a small\npercentage of professional graduates experience multiple\nfailures but the overwhelming preponderance of professional\ngraduates pass the EPPP on the first attempt.\nTable 1 contains the number of exams taken and pass rates\nfor the 63 professional (Vail Model) and 154 traditional\n(Boulder Model) programs. Tied programs are listed in\nalphabetical order. Professional programs have a \"P\" in front\nof them and are capitalized. Traditional programs have a \"T\"\nin front of them.\nrates higher than the overall mean pass rate of 86.97%, 2(1,\nanalyses mask the true differences between professional and\ntraditional clinical psychology programs because most pro-\nfessional schools have many more EPPP exams taken and\nbecause these data include retakes. In the present study, in\none state, there were six professional programs that each had\ntional programs combined.\nOf the 3,447 EPPP exams taken by traditional clinical\nthe 7,202 exams taken by professional clinical psychology\n4.06 greater than that of the traditional graduates' failure rate\nDiscussion\nThe vastly superior quality of the students of the traditional\nprograms must certainly contribute to the higher EPPP pass\nrate of the traditional programs. Traditional programs accept\n10% and professional schools 44% of applicants (Templer,\naverage of traditional programs is two standard deviations\nhigher (Templer, 2005b). Their mean GRE scores are more\nthan two standard deviations higher (Templer & Arikawa,\n2004). The GRE difference may be especially important\nbecause it correlated substantially with Wechsler Adult\nIntelligence Scale-Revised IQ (Carvajal & Pauls, 1995).\nThis is especially unfortunate in view of the current demand\nfor evidence-based assessment and treatment (e.g., Levant,\n2004). Less talented people are less capable of examining\nscientific evidence.\nIt should be noted that not all professional schools have\nhigh failure rates. Five professional programs have a pass\nrate of more than 95%. For example, the Rutgers profes-\nsional program mean pass rate of 95.80% is almost identical\nto that of the Rutgers traditional program rate of 95.50%. The\nTempler and Tangen 3\nTable 1.

(continued)\nTempler and Tangen 7\nRutgers professional school mean pass rate of 95.80% is\nalmost identical to that of the Rutgers traditional program\nrate of 95.50%. The Rutgers professional program accep-\ntance rate of 6% compares most favorably with the general\nprofessional school rate of 44% and is even lower than the\ntraditional acceptance rate of 10%. Templer and Tomeo\n(1998a) warned Canadian psychologists, \"Don't let it happen\nin Canada.\" They said that if Canada starts professional\nschools, they should \"be located in very strong universities\nand they should have the most elite admission standards pos-\nsible\" (p. 4). Rutgers appears to fit such a description better\nthan most professional schools. Unfortunately, most profes-\nsional programs are free-standing or in smaller universities.\nThey must accept less than optimal applicants for financial\nprofessional schools' failed exams can be accounted for by 8\nof the 65 professional programs.\nA fundamental problem, in view of the huge differences\nin selection ratio and GRE score, is that there is simply insuf-\nficient, very high-level talent to go around. It would appear\nto be difficult to find creative solutions for this deficiency\nwithout reducing the number of students admitted or the\nphasing out of some of the weaker programs.\nA troubling situation is that the National Council of\nSchools of Professional Psychology (NCSPP) lists 19 associ-\nate members who do not meet the criteria for full member-\nship. The EPPPinformation on these programs is not provided\nby the ASPPB and therefore is not contained in Table 1. The\nNCSPP also lists four programs that are in the process of\ndeveloping doctoral programs in clinical psychology. All 23\nof these programs appear to be free-standing or in nonpromi-\nnent universities. The prognosis for psychology's profes-\nsional school problem does not appear to be remarkably good.\nAfinal caveat is that the EPPPassesses mastery of academic\nknowledge but may or may not be related to the very important\ntherapeutic ingredient of client\u00adclinician relationship. An even\nmore fundamental gap in our knowledge is that we do not\nknow if there is a relationship between EPPP performance and\nclient outcome.
