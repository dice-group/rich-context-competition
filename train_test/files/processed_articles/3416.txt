Important caregiving activities,\nsuch as breastfeeding, sleep, adherence to\nwell-child visit, and vaccine schedules, can\nbe compromised in depressed mothers.\nMaternal depression also influences attach-\nment and bonding of the newborn, and can\naffect the child's development, leading to\ncognitive, social, emotional, and behav-\nioural problems that last into adolescence.1\nBreastfeeding is one of the first relation-\nships between the mother and newborn.\nTherefore, effects of postnatal depression\non breastfeeding practices have received\nincreasing interest in the last decade. Most\nof the research regarding this topic has\nfocussed on the association of initiation\nand duration of breastfeeding with postpar-\ntum depression, providing evidence for\nadverse effects of postpartum depression\non breastfeeding practices.2,3 Besides con-\ntinuity of breastfeeding, few studies have\ninvestigated any association between mater-\nnal depressive and anxious feelings and\nbreast milk content in the postnatal\nperiod.4,5 Following recognition of breast-\nfeeding being associated with hypernatre-\nmia, a potential life-threatening condition\nfor infants, the association of maternal\nadverse psychosocial characteristics and\nhigh breast milk Na concentrations has\nstarted to be examined.6 Previous maternal\npsychiatric morbidity, postnatal state anx-\niety, the perception of having a poor rela-\ntionship with their mother, and the belief of\nbeing unsuitable to be a mother have been\nsuggested to be more common in women\nwho had higher than expected Na concen-\ntrations in their breast milk compared with\ncontrols.4 Additionally, Flores-Quijano\net al. showed that high breast milk Na\nconcentrations of exclusively breastfed\nmothers were associated with maternal\nfeelings that their milk was insufficient for\ntheir newborns.5 They indicated a margin-\nally significant relationship between mater-\nnal depression and mammary gland\npermeability as shown by the Na/K ratio in\nbreast milk. This ratio is expected to rapidly\ndecrease, starting from postpartum day 3,\nand keep decreasing until the 6th month if\nbreast feeding is continued. The Na/K ratio\nis an indicator of successful breastfeeding in\nthe first postpartum week.5,7\nEarly detection of failure of breastfeeding\nin depressed and anxious mothers in the\npostpartum period may have clinical impli-\ncations for the newborn's growth.\nTherefore, the present study aimed to inves-\ntigate the association of breast milk Na\nlevels and the Na/K ratio with postnatal\ndepression and anxiety in a sample of\nmothers who exclusively breastfed their\nnewborns.\nMaterials and methods\nThis study was approved by the Dokuz\nEylul University Medical Sciences\nResearch Ethics Committee. Informed writ-\nten consents were obtained from all of the\nparticipants.\nPatients\nThe sample consisted of mothers of 150\nexclusively breastfed healthy newborns, who\nat 38\u00ad42 weeks' gestation. The mothers were\nconsecutively admitted to the well-baby unit\nof the Pediatrics Department of Dokuz\nEylul University Faculty of Medicine and\nTepecik State Hospital for routine monitor-\nMothers who were recruited had no breast\nproblems, such as an engorged or wounded\nbreast or mastitis, which account for failure\nof lactation. Exclusive breastfeeding was\ndefined as mothers not offering anything,\nincluding water, other than breast milk.\nMeasures\nSociodemographic data regarding mothers\nand their newborns were collected by a semi-\nstructured interview. Postnatal maternal\nanxiety and depression were assessed using\nthe self-report State and Trait Anxiety\nInventories (STAI-I and STAI-II) and the\nEdinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale\n(EPDS), respectively.8,9 Higher scores indi-\ncated higher anxiety and depression levels\ndepending on the instrument used. All three\ninstruments have been shown to be valid and\nreliable for the Turkish population.10,11\nAdditionally, mothers were also asked\nwhether they had received any psychiatric\ntreatment.\nBreast milk sampling\nA volume of 10 ml of milk was obtained by\nmanual milking of either breast. Sodium\nlevels are not affected by the mother's diet,\nthe method that milk is obtained (manually\nor by electric pump), being collected from\neither breast, or being obtained prior or\nfollowing breastfeeding.12\nThe milk sample was centrifuged at\nserum in which Na and K are present.\nSamples were stored at\u00c020C until analysis.\nBiochemical analysis of the breast milk\nsamples was performed using a Cobas 6000\nanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics) via an indirect\nmethod with an ion selective electrode.\nBreast milk Na concentrations greater than\n18 mmol/L and Na/K ratios greater than 1.0\nwere considered as high in accordance with\nData analysis\nData were analysed using SPSS version 15\nincluding means, standard deviations, and\npercentages, were calculated for sociodemo-\ngraphic variables. Bivariate analyses were\nperformed to assess the association between\nvariables using Spearman's correlation.\nChi-square and t-tests were used to evaluate\nthe potential group differences for categor-\nical and continuous variables, respectively.\nA P value < 0.05 was considered as\nsignificant.\nResults\nMothers who participated in the study were\nwere taking any psychotropic medication or\nreceiving any psychiatric treatment.\nNewborns were aged 8\u00ad15 days (mean,\nAdditional sociodemographic data regard-\ning mothers and newborns are shown in\nHigh Na levels (> 18 mmol/L) and a high\nmothers who had high breast milk Na levels\nand a high Na/K ratio were significantly\nmore likely to be the first child of the family\n(Table 1).\nMothers with high breast milk Na levels\nhad significantly higher mean STAI-I scores\nthan did mothers without high breast milk\nNa levels (P \u00bc 0.048). Mothers with high\nNa/K ratio also had higher STAI-I scores\nbut this was not significant compared to\nmothers with normal Na/K ratio\n(P \u00bc 0.063). No significant difference in the\nSTAI-II score was observed (Table 2).\nMean EPDS scores of mothers with high\nbreast milk Na levels and a high Na/K ratio\nwere significantly higher than those without\nhigh breast milk Na levels and without a\nanalysis showed a significant correlation\nbetween mean Na levels and the mean\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate the\nassociations of breast milk Na levels and the\nNa/K ratio with postnatal depression and\nanxiety. Although a direct causal relation-\nship is controversial, we showed that high\nbreast milk Na levels and the Na/K ratio\nwere associated with high postnatal depres-\nsion and anxiety scores.\nThere have been few studies regarding the\nassociation of postnatal maternal psychi-\natric morbidity and breast milk content.\nFlores-Quijano et al. compared breastfeed-\ning practices in postnatally depressed and\nnon-depressed mothers.5 They suggested\nTable 1.

Bold values indicate statistical significance.\nthat depressed women had a marginally\nhigh breast milk Na/K ratio in their breast\nmilk. Additionally, they found that high\nEPDS scores were compatible with\nmothers not feeling confident about breast-\nfeeding.5 In our study, we compared mothers\nwith high and expected levels of Na in their\nbreast milk and found that mothers had\nsignificantly higher scores of postnatal\ndepression when they had high breast milk\nNa levels. Furthermore, these mothers also\nhad significantly higher state anxiety scores\nthan those without high breast milk Na\nlevels. Our results appear to support those\nby Flores-Quijano et al.'s indicating that\npostpartum depression has adverse effects on\nbreast milk content and that state anxiety\nmay be another psychiatric morbidity related\nto high Na levels in breast milk.\nIn our sample, nearly one third of the\nmothers had high Na levels in their breast\nmilk, which is a similar finding to that by\nFlores-Quijano et al.5 This finding also\nindicates that approximately one third of\nnewborns may be feeding on breast milk\nwith high Na levels. Blood Na concentra-\ntions > 150 mmol/L are a potentially lethal\ncondition for neonates.6\nA potential explanation for the physio-\npathology of this condition is as follows.\nMothers who cannot hold their newborn on\ntheir breast long enough to allow proper\nductal evacuation might have increased\nmammary gland permeability. This condi-\ntion is thought to be related to incomplete\nclosure of the close connections between\nmammary gland epithelial cells that have\nnot been sufficiently evacuated, causing an\nincreased passage of Na from plasma to\ntested by further studies measuring the time\nspent at the breast.\nOur study also showed that birth order\n(i.e., being the first child) may be another\nrisk factor associated with high breast milk\nNa concentrations. This finding might be\nrelated to the breastfeeding experience,\nwhich has been suggested to affect successful\nThere are several limitations to our study.\nThese limitations include reporting bias\nbecause a lot of the data were based on\nmaternal reports and questionnaires.\nAlthough several studies have suggested\nusing the STAI and EPDS to determine\nclinical assessment is necessary for diagnosis\nof postnatal depression and anxiety.\nAdditionally, the data were obtained from\na limited population. An extended epi-\ndemiological study that assesses the associ-\nation between breast milk Na levels and\nmaternal emotional factors is necessary.\nDespite its limitations, to the best of our\nknowledge, our study is the first to assess the\nassociation of high levels of breastmilk Na,\nwhich is an indicator of lactation failure,\nwith postnatal maternal anxiety and depres-\nsive scores of mothers of babies without\nhypernatremic dehydration. Further\nresearch is required to determine whether\nbreast milk Na levels improve with psychi-\natric treatment of postnatal depression and\nanxiety. This could lead to other studies for\nimplementation of breast milk Na measure-\nments in clinical practice as a screening tool\nto detect adverse effects of postnatal depres-\nsion and anxiety on feeding of newborns.\n"
