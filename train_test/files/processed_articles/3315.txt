    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study was conducted to find out how high school students responded to pair tests: the collaboration of two students in\ntaking a test together. The objectives of pair tests were intended to create excitement, a higher motivation to study, increase\nlearning through discussion, and close collaboration during a test. The outcome of the study indicated that the majority of\nthe students enjoyed pair tests, and there were increases in motivation, discussion, learning, and collaboration. The main\ndownsides of pair tests were disagreements over answers and the laziness of some test takers as this behavior created\nnegative impacts on their responsible partners. The overall picture of pair tests was positive, and it is recommended that\nthey are administered not more than once a quarter.\n",

Educators have\nincreased student empowerment in classroom assessments to\nincrease motivation, interest, and student engagement to\nenhance learning (Sanders, Boss, Boss, & McConkie, 2011).\nStudents' collaborative efforts are positive as \"students learn\nbest when they take an active role in the education process,\ndiscussing what they read, practicing what they learn, and\napplying concepts and ideas\" (Davis, 1993, as cited in Smart\n(2011) mentioned that \"learning experiences are being mani-\nfest in the form of new approaches, theories, philosophies\nand meta-cognition\" (p. 28).\nWith this in mind, the researcher began to introduce the\nconcept of student collaboration during tests to create excite-\nment and motivate students to study harder for tests. This is\nin line with the findings of Zapatero, Maheshwari, and Chen\n(2012) that \"students' performance in traditional examina-\ntion does not improve at the same rate with higher level of\ncollaborative environment\" and that \"while changing the\nclassroom environment, testing methods and tools must also\nchange according to reflect the full effect of the collaborative\nexperiment with cooperative tests that were administered\neither quarterly, semi-annually, or annually during a class\nperiod of 45 min. The initial tests were experimented with\ngroup tests of two students, four students, and even a class\ntest (one test for the entire class). After a few years of experi-\nmentation, she discovered that the best test was the one with\ntwo options open to all students: (a) individual test and (b)\npair test (two persons taking one test together). She also real-\nized that disagreements over answers could be easily resolved\nby simply allowing students to have an option of having their\nown individual answer sheets (two answer sheets) instead of\none. Students opting to take pair tests were allowed the privi-\nlege of choosing whom to work with. Although there might\nbe a concern regarding disturbances as a result of discus-\nsions, it had never been a problem as discussions had always\nbeen done very quietly. The usual percentage of students opt-\ning for pair tests is approximately 95% while the remaining\nstudents worked individually on their tests, either because of\nthe student's preference to work alone, or simply because the\nstudent did not have a partner to work with.\nThe literature that exists in pair testing pertains to com-\nputer software development where two members work\ntogether as a team to test the application of the software\n(Balijepally, Mahapatra, Nerur, & Price, 2009; Dawande,\n1Stamford International University, Bangkok, Thailand\nCorresponding Author:\nRachaniphorn Ngotngamwong, Stamford International University, Bangkok\nEmail: DrKaten@gmail.com\nPair Tests in a High School Classroom:\nAnother Option for Students and\nTeachers\nRachaniphorn Ngotngamwong1\n Keywords\nachievement, education, social sciences, education theory and practice, educational measurement and assessment, educational\nresearch, international education, higher education\n2 SAGE Open\nPorter, Guzdial, McDowell, & Simon, 2013; Salleh, Mendes,\n& Grundy, 2011). Although there is limited literature to be\nfound in the area of taking tests in pairs (pair tests), there is\nplentiful literature on cooperative learning in pairs. This arti-\ncle presents the proposal of using pair tests in the high school\nclassroom as another alternative assessment for both teach-\ners and students and acts as a contribution to scarce litera-\nture. This contribution is supported by Zapatero et al. (2012)\nwho stated that the emphasis on measurement techniques in\na collaborative environment is minimal, and \"there is a need\nfor more research in the area of assessment of the active/col-\nlaborative learning environment\" (p. 103).\nLiterature Review\nAssessment\nAssessment is the primary tool used in student placement,\ngrade assignment, grade-level promotion, and graduation.\nHowever, there has been an evolution in the definition of\nassessment today. Moon (2005) defines it as \"the process of\nobserving student learning by collaborating with students to\ncollect and interpret data about their academic strengths and\nweaknesses, interests, and learning preferences, with the\ngoal of making decisions that benefit their instruction\"\nTraditional classroom measurement assessments such as\nquizzes, tests, projects, or other similar assessment tools,\nhave had to a large extent, failed to take into consideration,\nthe \"collaborative and constructivist learning taking place in\nthe active learning environment\" (Zapatero et al., 2012, p.\n\"traditional testing mechanism may not capture all different\naspects of the learning taking place in the active learning\nenvironment classrooms\" (p. 104).\nThe availability of assessment alternatives are plentiful\ntoday for educators to choose from and special care is needed\nin the \"selection or development of proper assessment tools\"\nassessment methods, assessment technologies are readily\navailable and widely used, thus providing a wide array of\nbenefits to not only students but also to educators as well.\nAssessments act as a useful feedback tool for educators in\nsupporting student achievement, motivation, and in helping\nthem toward their learning targets (Heritage, 2007; Nolen,\nStudent as Learners\nThere has been a tremendous transformation in school learn-\ning during the past few decades, with deviation away from\nthe traditional, teacher-centered classroom toward a more\nstudent-centered classroom with a greater emphasis on the\nlearners' needs (I-Ying & Wan-Yu, 2012). Numerous studies\nhave also found out that learning is enhanced with positive\nlearning outcomes when students are actively involved in the\nlearning process, also known as active learning.Active learn-\ning is student centered rather than teacher centered, as stu-\ndents are more engaged, gain deep learning, acquire greater\nproblem-solving and critical thinking abilities, and enjoy\nthemselves (Benek-Rivera & Matthews, 2004; Sarason &\nStudent Collaboration\nAs the significance of teamwork increases in organizations,\npreparing students to collaborate by working in teams has\nentered institutions with training starting at a very young\nage, and all the way up to higher education in the form of\nassignments and projects (Cox & Bobrowski, 2004; Fredrick,\nLam, 2013). This collaborative effort is found distinctively\nin cooperative small group learning that is reputed in pro-\nmoting socialization and learning across K-12 schools and\ncolleges. By working cooperatively with each other, students\nlearn to (a) share their ideas, (b) be open to other perspec-\ntives, (c) cultivate better listening skills, (d) give and gain,\n(e) be conflict managers, (f) gain academic and social sup-\nport, (g) have a higher self-esteem, and (h) apply knowledge\nas they gain greater understanding (Bertucci, Conte, Johnson,\nWorking in Pairs, Groups, and Individually\nCollaboration is frequently seen in groups or pairs because\n\"groups collaborate more effectively when individuals learn\nfrom each other\" (\"Pair Up to Foster More Learning,\" 2014,\np. 6). Moreover, the social independence theory state that\nthere are higher achievements in cooperative groups com-\npared with those who work individually (Bertucci et al.,\nWhile some researchers believe that productivity increases\nwith group size, others state that the bigger the group size,\nthe more social loafing and complexities are involved in\ncoordination (Bertucci et al., 2010). This is supported by a\nstudy conducted by Bertucci et al. (2010), where \"students in\ngroups of four did not achieve higher results than students\nworking in pairs\" (p. 267). By working in pairs, students gain\na higher self-esteem, and bond faster at a more personal level\nas there are only two individuals (Bertucci et al., 2010).\nLiving in a digital age where information technology is\nwidespread, and increasing in significance, student collabo-\nration has changed tremendously. There is active student\nNgotngamwong 3\ncollaboration in chat rooms, discussion forums, through\ne-mail, groupware, and text messages. This digital collabora-\ntion is a form of virtual teamwork, which is commonplace in\nbusiness, and being capable of working effectively in virtual\nteams is a necessity (Fletcher, 2009; Hunsaker, Pavett, &\ning or pair programming, consists of members working in\npairs by using one computer on the same task. Findings on\npair testing are positive as working in pairs has resulted in\nhigher levels of performance, communication, learning to\ngive and accept suggestions, satisfaction, grades, and confi-\ndence compared with working individually (Balijepally\nResearch Methodology\nThe quantitative research design was chosen for this study,\nand descriptive statistics was used in data analysis.\nParticipants of the study included 55 high school students\nwho were engaged in pair tests administered quarterly for the\nentire school year during a normal class period of 45 min.\nPaper questionnaires were administered in class at the end of\nthe academic school year in 2012 and excel was used in data\nanalysis. The purpose of the study was to find out the effec-\ntiveness of pair tests in the classroom and this was answered\nby the following three research questions:\nResearch Question 1 (RQ1): Should pair tests be admin-\nistered to high school students?\nResearch Question 2 (RQ2): What were the students'\nperceptions regarding pair tests?\nResearch Question 3 (RQ3): What were the students'\npositive and negative opinions about pair tests?\nThese research questions were answered through a semi-\nstructured questionnaire consisting of four sections, and a\ntotal of 28 questions. In Section A, the first 4 open-ended\nquestions sought to find out if pair tests should be adminis-\ntered, whereas the next 16 open-ended questions found in\nSection B sought to find out students' perceptions of pair\ntests. Two open-ended questions had been added to the ques-\ntionnaire in Section C with the goal of giving students the\nopportunity to express their opinions in their own words\nregarding the positive and negative effects of pair tests. The\n6 last questions in Section D provided basic demographic\nprofile of participants.\nResearch Findings\nRespondents' Profile\nOut of the total of 55 respondents, 64% were female, and\n36% were male, and up to 77.2% of the respondents were\nrepresented by Thais, followed by Indians (7%), Chinese and\nKorean (5.2% each), and French, Taiwanese, and others\n(1.8% each). These respondents were aged between 15 and\n18 years (Figure 1) and were currently enrolled in Grades 10\nstudents enrolled in the General Business classes and 42.6%\nwere enrolled in the Economics classes. Figure 3 is a graphi-\ncal illustration of the number of times students had changed\ntheir partner in pair tests.\nMore than half of the students stuck to their old partners\nin every pair test. There was an inverse relationship between\nFigure 1. Respondents by age.\nNote. This figure provides a graphical representation of the ages of\nrespondents who participated in the study. As the respondents were high\nschool students, the age group was between 15 and 18 years old. Over\nhalf of the respondents were 16 years old (57%), whereas others were\neither younger or older.\nFigure 2. Respondents by grade.\nNote. This chart provides a graphical illustration that the respondents\nwere mostly represented by high school sophomores (Grade 10) and\njuniors (Grade 11), and less than 5% were seniors (Grade 12).\n4 SAGE Open\nthe number of times students changed their partners and the\nnumber of students. That is, the greater the frequency of part-\nner changes, the lower the percentage of students who\nchanged partners.\nData Analysis\nStudents' thoughts on the administration of pair tests.Up to\n87.5% of the respondents felt that it was a good idea for the\nteacher to allow pair test testing, 3.6% did not think so, and\n8.9% were uncertain about it. The majority of the students\namounting up to 80% enjoyed pair tests (strongly agree and\nagree responses), 18.2% were neutral, and 1.8% disagreed.\nMore than half the respondents (58.9%) had pair tests for\nthe first time in the researcher's class, 28.6% had been previ-\nously exposed to it, and a small percentage (12.5%) was\nuncertain. Although the findings indicated that more than\nhalf of the students (57.1%) felt that pair tests should always\nbe administered, up to 39.3% felt that it should be adminis-\ntered quarterly. Only 1.8% thought that it should be\nadministered yearly and the same percentage thought that\npair tests should not be administered at all.\nStudents' experiences with pair tests.The second research\nquestion that focused on students'experiences with pair tests\nwas answered by 16 closed-ended questions and their\nresponses (Table 1) have been categorized into six main\ngroupings for easier analysis and understanding: (a) collabo-\nration and teamwork, (b) discussion, (c) learning, (d) motiva-\ntion, (e) test partner, and (f) studying for tests. These reported\nresponses were based on \"strongly agree\" and \"agree\"\nanswers in terms of frequency and percent, with N = 55.\nStudents' opinions about pair tests. In an effort to allow stu-\ndents to freely express themselves in their own words regard-\ning the positive and negative effects of pair tests, two\nopen-ended questions had been incorporated into the ques-\ntionnaire to address RQ3. A total of 88 positive comments\nand 46 negative comments were made, thus demonstrating\nthe greater inclination positive attitude toward pair tests.\nOnly four highest frequencies are reported for both positive\neffects and negative effects. The four most frequent opinions\non positive effects presented in Table 2 indicated the four\nissues ranked from the highest to the lowest responses (14 to\n7) and they included (a) develop greater teamwork and coop-\neration, (b) discuss and analyze test questions and answers,\n(c) helping each other, and (d) greater motivation to study\nmore/more hardworking. On the other hand, the ones for\nnegative effects as found in Table 3, are numerous, with the\nfour highest issues ranking from the most frequent first,\nincluded (a) disagreement over the answer for a question, (b)\npartner doesn't study for a test, (c) being lazy to study and\nknowing you can depend on the other partner, and (d) bad\npartners take advantage of good ones.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was to find out the effectiveness of\npair test administration. The findings of the study presented\na strong indication that pair tests were well accepted by high\nschool students who were studying business and economics\nsubjects. The large majority were in favor of the administra-\ntion of pair tests as they enjoyed it, and even though approxi-\nmately half of the students indicated that it should be\nadministered every time, the educator-researcher is in favor\nwith the second majority group of students who felt that it\nshould be administered quarterly. This is because she believes\nthat a greater weight should be assigned to individual testing\nassessment and pair tests is just another collaborative activ-\nity that is a small but yet significant portion of a student's\ntotal assessment.\nPair tests is an effective and successful alternative assess-\nment tool in engaging students as there were high levels of\nstudent collaboration, teamwork, discussion, analysis, and\nlearning. Students also felt that having a good partner was an\nimportant component of increased cooperation and learning\nin pair tests. Although only two thirds of the respondents felt\nmore motivated to study harder, so that the team could do\nbetter on the test, it was still a good representation of motiva-\ntion. It was amazing to discover that up to almost 90% always\nstudied for the tests, and 80% felt that their partner always\nFigure 3. Number of times students have changed their partner\nin pair tests.\nNote. More than half of the students stuck to their old partners in every\npair test. There was an inverse relationship between the number of times\nstudents changed their partners and the number of students. That is, the\ngreater the frequency of partner changes, the lower the percentage of\nstudents who changed partners.\nNgotngamwong 5\nstudied for the test. It was interesting to note, however, that\neven though pair tests did not always result in higher scores,\nthe majority of the students were still in favor of it.\nThe downsides of pair tests, as portrayed from the closed-\nended questions were the pressures of working with a part-\nner, accounting for one fifth of the students. These pressures\nwere probably from academically weaker students who\nwanted to be paired with stronger students, or partnering\nwith someone they did not want to be but had to due to peer\npressure. The stress associated with working with partners\nwas at approximately 10%, which is relatively low, but nev-\nertheless existent. On a positive note regarding stress, a num-\nber of students had mentioned that pair tests had reduced the\nstress and pressure they were facing. A very small percentage\nof students reported being lazy to study for tests and being\ndependent on their partner in studying for the tests, thus con-\nfirming the statement made by Sauer and Mertens (2013)\nthat \"some students do diligently prepare for exams; some do\nnot\" (p. 93). This created frustration for a few students who\nhad irresponsible and \"bad\" partners who were lazy and took\nadvantage of them. Although collaboration had produced\npositive comments, some discussions had resulted in dis-\nagreements over answers for a question. A few students also\ncomplained about the longer time spent in discussion before\ncoming up with an answer.\nIt can be summarized from the findings that pair tests had\nboth positive and negative effects (Figure 4) with the posi-\ntive outweighing the negative. The positive effects of pair\ntests included increased collaboration, discussion, learning,\nand motivation, while reducing stress. The negative effects\nTable 2.

It was an excellent feedback\ninstrument for the researcher to find out if the years of\nadministration of collaborative tests in the form of pair\ntests was in fact, a step that was well implemented. The\nresearcher was pleased to know for a fact that the brain-\nstorming and discussion that occurred had resulted in more\nlearning. She was also delighted to know that she could\nplay a small part in reducing students' stress and anxiety\nlevels through pair tests as students were overburdened\nwith other school-related responsibilities. Despite the pres-\nence of free riders, the percentage was minimal. Any dis-\nagreements over answers and time-consuming discussions\nwere valuable experiences that would greatly benefit stu-\ndents in times of needed collaboration in teams and man-\naging conflict.\nPair Tests\nPositive Effects\nNegative Effects\nIncreased:\n\u00b7 Collaboration\n\u00b7 Discussion\n\u00b7 Learning\n\u00b7 Motivation\nDecreased:\n\u00b7 Stress\nAt lower levels:\n\u00b7 Disagreements over answers\n\u00b7 Free-riders\n\u00b7 Peer pressure\n\u00b7 Feeling lazy to study\nFigure 4.

The sample\nsize of 55 was relatively small and the study was limited to\nonly high school students in Grades 10 through 12 who were\ntaking business and economics classes. It is recommended\nthat further research in pair tests be conducted in an experi-\nmental design study encompassing a larger sample size at\nvarious subjects and levels in a school setting. As this study's\nfindings were largely dependent on the students' opinions, it\nis recommended that any other sources of information, such\nas teacher observation, peer reviews, and statistical testing be\nused to indicate the effectiveness of pair tests. Further\nresearch could also be based on classroom research with\nachievement as a dependent variable apart from the ones that\nhad used in this study. Another limitation would be the bias\nin responding to the questions, thus reducing the reliability\nof the results.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBalijepally, V., Mahapatra, R., Nerur, S., & Price, K.
