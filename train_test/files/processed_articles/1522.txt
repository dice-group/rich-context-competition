The design of this study was carefully\nplanned to allow for investigation of the interaction between\ndomains and the impact of these interactions on health and\nhealth outcomes. A great strength of NSHAP is its compre-\nhensive collection of both social measures and biological\nmeasures. Because of these detailed measures, NSHAP is\nable to capture many important social, psychological, and\nphysiological dimensions of aging.\nThis paper elaborates on the physiological and physical\nhealth measures reported by NSHAP, focusing particularly\non the measures of chronic conditions and diseases seen\nmost commonly in aging populations in the United States.\nIn NSHAP, there are two types of health measures: self-\nreported and direct biological measures (biomeasures).\nFor self-reported measures, respondents were asked to\nrate aspects of their health and report on their health con-\nditions and physical functioning. For the biomeasures, ei-\nther physical measurements of respondents' health status\nand physiological functioning were recorded or biologi-\ncal samples were collected for analysis of measures asso-\nciated with physiological function. In some cases, the\nself-reported measures and direct biomeasures act as com-\nplements, assessing different dimensions of the same con-\ndition; in other cases, the two types of measures serve to\ncross-validate each other. The combination of self-reported\nmeasures and biomeasures thus gives us a more compre-\nhensive picture of respondents' health than is typically\navailable.\nAn additional objective of this article is to promote re-\nsearch using NSHAP by providing pertinent background\ninformation on these measures and their associated condi-\ntions. The biological and behavioral measures collected in\nNSHAP in combination with the breadth and depth of de-\nmographic and social data allow for many opportunities to\nexplore the potential biological mechanisms and relation-\nships that mediate the relationship between social factors\nand health at older ages. Because of space constraints, this\ndiscussion is not exhaustive, but we hope that the overviews\nwill provide an introduction to the various measures and\nstimulate social science researchers to pursue analyses us-\ning these measures. To this latter end, we include references\nfor further reading.\nNature of the Data\nStudy Design and Cooperation Rates\nAn overview of the NSHAP study design may be found in\nSmith and colleagues (this issue). Here, we focus on aspects\nof the study design that relate to the collection of physical\nMeasures of Chronic Conditions and Diseases Associated\nWith Aging in the National Social Life, Health,\nand Aging Project\nSharon R.

This paper presents a description of the methods used in the National Social Life, Health, andAging Project\nto detect the presence of chronic conditions and diseases associated with aging. It also discusses the validity and distribu-\ntion of these measures.\nMethods. Markers associated with common chronic diseases and conditions of aging were collected from 3,005 com-\nmunity-dwelling older adults living in the United States, aged 57\u00ad85 years, during 2006. Dried blood spots, physical func-\ntion tests, anthropometric measurements, self-reported history, and self-rated assessments were used to detect the presence\nof chronic conditions associated with aging or of risk factors associated with the development of chronic diseases.\nResults. The distribution of each measure, disaggregated by age group and gender, is presented.\nConclusions. This paper describes the methodology used as well as the distribution of each of these measures. In ad-\ndition, we discuss how the measures used in the study relate to specific chronic diseases and conditions associated with\naging and how these measures might be used in social science analyses.\nKey Words: Disease measurement--Biomeasures--Self reported health.\nhealth and chronic condition measures. Due to time con-\nstraints, some sections of the NSHAP were modularized to\nmaximize the amount of information that could be obtained\nfrom the maximum number of participants in the minimum\namount of time. For these sections, respondents were ran-\ndomized to receive different modules, each of which asked\nrespondents a different set of questions. Consequently, not all\nmeasures are available for all respondents. For variables as-\nsociated with chronic conditions and diseases, this design\nresulted in only two thirds of respondents being asked to par-\nticipate in the \"get up and go\" test and four fifths of respon-\ndents asked to provide blood spots. The resulting sample\nsizes for these measures will be lower than the overall sample\nsize. An overview of the health-related measures collected in\nNSHAP is provided in Table 1. This table also includes final\nsample sizes for each of these measures.\nMethods\nThe methods described here are those used in the in-home\ncollection of data for NSHAP. Because of the many chal-\nlenges associated with in-home collection of biological\nmeasures of health in a nationally representative sample of\nolder adults, some of these methods are not optimal and\nmay not be comparable to clinical standards. Every effort\nwas made to maximize the utility and comparability of each\nmeasure. Each variable chosen for collection and each of\nthe methods used for collection were considered relative to\nmany limiting factors, including adaptability to collection\nin the home, time required for collection, cost of collection,\nease of training and implementation by field interviewers,\nand participant burden. Field interviewers were trained, in-\nperson, in the collection of each of these methods using a\ncombination of lecture, demonstration, and participation\nand were provided with detailed, diagrammed protocols.\nBiomeasure Collection\nBlood pressure.--High blood pressure, also known as\nhypertension, is a condition in which blood pressure is\npersistently elevated beyond normal levels. A type of car-\ndiovascular disease, high blood pressure accounts for about\n5% of all cardiovascular-related deaths (American Heart\nAssociation, 2005) and is associated with increased risk\nof heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease\n(Chobanian et al., 2003). The presence of hypertension is\nstrongly associated with aging (Hajjar & Kotchen, 2003).\nCurrent guidelines published by the American Heart Asso-\nciation (http://www.americanheart.org) categorize normal\nblood pressure as a systolic blood pressure below 120 mmHg\nand a diastolic blood pressure below 80 mmHg. A systolic\nbetween 80 and 89 mmHg is considered to be prehyper-\ntensive, and a systolic pressure greater than 140 mmHg\nor a diastolic pressure greater than 90 mmHg is diagnostic\nof hypertension.\nIn NSHAP, two blood pressure readings were taken from\nthe left arm using a Lifesource digital blood pressure mon-\nitor (Model: UA-767PVL) following the manufacturer's\nusage recommendations. A third blood pressure reading\nwas taken if the first two systolic readings differed from\neach other by 20 mmHg or more or if the first two diastolic\nreadings differed from each other by 14 mmHg or more. In\nanalyzing blood pressure data, hypertension medication\nand other medications that affect blood pressure should be\ntaken into account. Pulse was also recorded from the blood\npressure monitor; the mean of the first two readings is typ-\nically used in analyses. Normal pulse rates are between\n60 and 80 beats per minute. Table 2 reports the summary\nstatistics of the blood pressure and pulse readings for the\nNSHAP sample.\nTable 1.

In adults, anthropometric measure-\nments are used to assess obesity, a condition in which the\nproportion of body fat exceeds the range thought to be nor-\nmal or healthy. Obesity is associated with a higher risk of\nchronic conditions at older ages such as cardiovascular dis-\nease and diabetes and with a higher risk of premature death\n(National Task Force on the Prevention and Treatment of\nThere are two measures of obesity reported by NSHAP:\nbody mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. An indi-\nvidual's BMI is defined as his or her weight in kilograms\ndivided by the square of his or her height in meters, that is,\nBMI = weight [kg]/(height [m])2. (Note that weight alone\nis thought to be an insufficient indicator of obesity in the\nabsence of height.) High BMI has been shown to be associ-\nated with increased risk of mortality (Calle, Thun, Petrelli,\nRodriguez, & Heath, 1999). Waist measurements are useful\nas a proxy for abdominal fat (Lemieux, Prud'homme,\nBouchard, Tremblay, & Despres, 1996), and high waist cir-\ncumference has been associated with increased cardiovascu-\nlar disease risk, especially among individuals with high BMI.\nThe distributions of waist circumference, height, weight, and\nBMI in the NSHAP sample are shown in Table 3.\nThe World Health Organization (1995) has identified six\nstatistical categories associated with ranges of BMI; these\ncategories are typically used in analyses. The categories are\nobese (BMI 40). For waist measures, the National Heart,\nLung, and Blood Institute (1998) has designated as high\nrisk having a waist circumference greater than 102 cm for\nmen and greater than 88 cm for women. BMI and waist\nclassifications may be used as separate measures of obesity\nor combined as shown in Table 4.\nHeight was measured in the following way. With the re-\nspondent against a wall, a clipboard was placed on top of\nthe respondent's head and a Post-it note was placed directly\nbelow the clipboard. The respondent was asked to step away\nfrom the wall, and a standard measuring tape was used to\nmeasure the distance from the floor to the top of the Post-it\nnote.Weight was measured with clothing on, using a Health-\no-Meter digital scale (Model: HDL111DQ-60), and re-\ncorded to the nearest half pound. For waist measurements, a\nstandard fiberglass tape measure was used to measure the\nwaist at a point midway between the iliac crest and the bot-\ntom rib, just above the navel.\nTable 2.

Loss of mobility has been shown to be a useful\npredictor of future physical disability (Fried, Bandeen-\nRoche, Chaves, & Johnson, 2000), and in older adults, phys-\nical disability is strongly associated with chronic conditions\n(Wolff, Starfield, & Anderson, 2002): older individuals with\nmultiple chronic conditions are more likely to experience\nrapid declines and disability, and conversely, disabled adults\nare at greater risk of health complications and developing\nother impairments (Stuck et al., 1999). Disability and im-\npairment are also strong predictors of subjective well-being\nand, moreover, are better predictors of subjective ratings of\nwell-being than the pathology or disease precipitating the\ndisability (Ormel et al., 1997). Disabled adults also have in-\ncreased mortality risk (Lamarca et al., 2003).\nIn NSHAP, physical mobility is measured by the timed\nget-up-and-go test. For this test, respondents are asked to,\nfrom a seated position, get up from a chair, walk 3 (premea-\nsured) m at a normal pace, turn around, walk back 3 m to-\nward the chair, and sit down again. The time (in seconds)\nthat it took for the respondent to (a) stand, (b) walk 3 m, (c)\nturn around, (d) return 3 m, and (e) turn and sit was recorded\nwith the aid of a computer. Although the times of the indi-\nvidual stages may be used, most analyses use, as a measure\nof mobility, the overall time of completion of the get-up-\nand-go test or a dichotomous variable based on that overall\ntime. Bischoff and colleagues (2003) suggest a reported time\nof 12 s or less as indicative of normal mobility (Table 5).\nSalivary hormones and dried blood spots.--Direct mea-\nsures of key physiological measures were assayed from ei-\nther saliva or dried blood spot samples. An in-depth\ndiscussion of the analytes, methods of collection, and anal-\nysis of salivary hormones can be found in Gavrilova and\ncolleagues (this issue). A list of the measures assayed from\nsaliva and dried blood spots can be found in Table 1. An in-\ndepth discussion of the analytes, methods of collection, and\nanalysis of dried blood spots can be found in Williams and\nMcDade (this issue).\nSelf-rated and Self-reported Measures\nFunctional health.--Functional health is the ability to en-\ngage in everyday activities such as bathing or walking. Ac-\ncording to the Centers for Disease Control (2004), many\nolder adults report physical limitations with respect to walk-\ning, reaching, stooping, and pushing. As discussed in the\nmobility section, physical disability is strongly predictive of\ntrajectories of physical health and mortality.\nNSHAP reports the self-rated difficulty of engaging in\nseven activities of daily living that are indicators of functional\nhealth. These are walking one block; walking across a room;\ndressing oneself; bathing or showering; eating, such as cutting\nup one's food; getting in or out of bed; and using the toilet,\nincluding getting up and down. NSHAP also reports the self-\nrated difficulty of driving a car during the day and also at\nnight. These items may be used as individual measures of\nfunctional health or may be combined into a single index that\nindicates whether the respondent has difficulty with any of the\nlisted activities. Table 6 shows the proportion of respondents\nexperiencing difficulty with these different daily activities.\nMorbidity.--In NSHAP, respondents were asked whether\nthey had been diagnosed with particular health conditions.\nSpecifically, they were asked, \"Has a medical doctor ever\ntold you that you have (had) . . .\" x health condition.\nTable 4. Distribution of Body Mass Index (BMI) and Obesity\nClasses Proportion (weighted), %\nNote: Classification of BMI is as follows. Low or slightly low: BMI <20;\nTable 5.

That is,\ngiven an individual has a certain disease, the concomitant\npresence of other diseases significantly increases risk of death\nin both the short run and the long run. In addition to the self-\nreports of individual diseases itemized previously, NSHAP\nreports a comorbidity index (comorb) of the total number of\nhealth conditions (from a list of specified conditions) reported\nby the individual. The list of conditions that contribute to this\nindex is derived from the set of conditions that define the\nCharlson comorbidity index. Developed by Charlson, Pom-\npei,Ales, and McKenzie (1987), the original Charlson comor-\nbidity index is a weighted average of 19 health conditions that\nhave been shown to be predictive of mortality. The conditions\nare weighted according to the degree to which they increase\nthe risk of mortality, and this composite index has been shown\nto be highly predictive of 1- and 10-year mortality rates.\nThe Charlson index was originally validated in a research\ncontext in which health conditions were identified using pa-\ntient medical records. Katz, Chang, Sangha, Fossel, and\nBates (1996) subsequently adapted the Charlson index for\nuse in a questionnaire setting. In NSHAP, we followed the\nmodel of Katz and colleagues, asking respondents to report\non any previous diagnoses of health conditions.\nBecause NSHAP does not ask about all conditions that are\nincluded in the Charlson/Katz indexes, it is not possible to\ngenerate an index that is strictly comparable to these indexes;\nnevertheless, an unweighted count of conditions (as reported\nin the variable comorb) is likely to be informative as a gross\nmeasure of disease burden. We also encourage researchers to\ndevelop composite measures that are most relevant for their\nresearch needs. Table 7 reports the presence of selected health\nconditions in the NSHAP sample, and Table 8 gives summary\nstatistics of the unweighted comorbidity index comorb.\nSelf-reported health.--Self-reported health is a person's\nsubjective assessment of his or her own well-being. Self-\nreported health has been shown to be associated with a wide\narray of more specific health measures, such as sensory\nfunction, functional health, cognition, disease, and sexual\ndysfunction (Laumann, Paik, & Rosen 1999; Ostbye et al.,\n2006). In addition, there is some evidence to suggest that\nself-reported health is as useful an indicator of health and\nmortality as physician diagnosis (Ferraro & Farmer, 1999;\ncontext of NSHAP and all its other health and morbidity\nmeasures, a self-reported measure of health is useful be-\ncause it captures the concept of health as overall well-being\nand not simply the absence of disease (Ross & Wu, 1996).\nTable 9 lists the distribution of self-reported health relative\nto others of the same age group.\nDiscussion and Analytical Recommendations\nMost chronic conditions and diseases associated with ag-\ning cannot be measured by a single question or biomeasure.\nTable 7.

In the morbidity section of the interview, participants\nwere asked if they had ever had hypertension, heart disease,\nor a stroke. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were\nalso directly measured. Systolic and diastolic blood pres-\nsures are common measures of hypertension, one of the\nmost common cardiovascular diseases. Current guideliness\nsuggested by the Centers for Discase Control define hyper-\ntension as a systolic blood pressure above 140 mm Hg or 90\nmm Hg diastolic. Blood pressure levels between 120 and\nto be prehypertensive and associated with an increased risk\nof developing cardiovascular diaease (Chobaman et al., 2003).\nLevels of C-reactive protein, a risk factor for cardiovascular\nRidker, Cushman, Stampfer, Tracy, & Hennekens, 1997;\nRidker, Rifai, Rose, Buring, & Cook, 2002), were also mea-\nsured from dried blood spots.\nMeasures of Diabetes\nDiabetes is one of the leading causes of morbidity and\nmortality among persons aged 65 and older (Desai, Zhang, &\nare estimated to have diabetes, with another 25% in predia-\nbetic stages (Samos & Roos, 1998). Moreover, because dia-\nbetes can be asymptomatic for many years, about 50% of\nolder individuals with diabetes are thought to be undiag-\nNSHAP includes two different measures directly related\nto diabetes. The first measure indicates whether an individ-\nual reports ever having been told by a medical doctor that he\nor she has diabetes or high blood sugar. This self-report\nmeasure may be interpreted directly as an indicator of diag-\nnosed diabetes, or it may be used as part of a composite co-\nmorbidity score (discussed in the morbidity section). The\nsecond NSHAP measure associated with diabetes--assessed\nfrom blood spot samples obtained from respondents--is the\npercentage of hemoglobin attached to glucose. This measure\nis known as glycosylated hemoglobin, or HbA1c. Details on\nthe collection and properties of the HbA1c biomarker are\ndiscussed in Williams and McDade (this issue).\nBecause HbA1c is a relatively new biomarker in the con-\ntext of population-based surveys, there are as yet no stan-\ndard guidelines for its use in social science research. There\nare, however, several considerations that might be useful to\nbear in mind in using the HbA1c measure for such research.\nTable 8. Distribution of Comorbidity Index\nRange M (weighted) SD Median\nTotal number of Charlson comorbidities\nAges (years)\nTable 9. Distribution of Self-reported Health Ratings\nClasses Proportion (weighted), %\nMen\nWomen\nNote: Proportions may not sum to 100% because of rounding.\nFirst, interpreted directly as a measure of glycemic control\nfor patients with diabetes, as is done in a clinical setting, an\nHbA1c level of 7% is an important target (American Diabe-\ntes Association, 2003). This level of HbA1c is thought to be\nthe threshold level below which there are many fewer health\ncomplications from diabetes (healthy persons without dia-\nbetes have HbA1c levels 6%).\nSecond, although it is tempting to use HbA1c as a popu-\nlation measure of morbidity associated with diabetes, an\nanalysis using HbA1c in this way is somewhat complicated.\nThe main problem is that two individuals with the same\nHbA1c level may have very different morbidity profiles, de-\npending on whether they have been diagnosed and are under\ntreatment. For example, a \"normal\" HbA1c reading may\nidentify either an individual who truly does not have diabe-\ntes or an individual who has diabetes but is currently con-\ntrolling it through medication or lifestyle modification; the\nsecond person is likely to have already had some pathology\nrelated to diabetes affecting his or her health, and this is not\ndetected in the HbA1c measure. Thus, to use HbA1c as a\nmorbidity measure, it is best to combine this measure with\ninformation on whether the respondent reports having been\ndiagnosed with diabetes and with information from the\nmedication log indicating diabetic treatments such as sulfo-\nnylureas, biguanides, or insulin.\nMeasures of Allostatic Load\nThe concept of allostatic load has been proposed as a\nmechanism by which environmental factors can affect phys-\niology and result in differential health outcomes, especially\nMcEwen & Stellar, 1993). Allostatic load is the cumulative\ncost of maintaining allostasis (Sterling & Eyer, 1988)--a\nrelatively stable and steady state. Over time, the dysregula-\ntion of the systems involved in maintaining allostasis, espe-\ncially those involved with the stress response, may occur\nand result in declining health and the development of chronic\ndisease. A high allostatic load has been associated with in-\ncreased risk of mortality, cognitive and physical function\ndecline, and increase in general health decline (McEwen,\n2007). Social factors such as socioeconomic status and so-\ncial integration and racial and ethnic group have been asso-\nciated with allostatic load (Geronimus, Hicken, Keene, &\nMeasures of allostatic load include direct measures of the\nprimary mediators of the physiological stress response of the\nsympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamic-pi-\ntuitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (McEwen, 2007) as well as mea-\nsures associated with the chronic effects of the SNS and HPA\naxis activity (McEwen & Seeman, 1999) including cardio-\nvascular activity and atherosclerosis development, metabo-\nlism and adiposity, and glucose metabolism. Not all the\nmeasures generally used to measure allostatic load are avail-\nable in the NSHAP data; however, measures of most of the\nabove-mentioned systems are available. Further, because of\nthe cumulative nature of allostatic load, a true measure of al-\nlostatic load would optimally include measures of change in\nthese biological markers over time, but this was not possible.\nNSHAP does not measure stress directly but does include\nmeasures of perceived stress. Measures of perceived stress\nuse a four-question modification of Cohen's Perceived Stress\nScale (Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983). Perception\nof anxiety is also measured in NSHAP using a modification\nof the seven-item subset of the Hospital Anxiety and Depres-\nsion Scale (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983). Further discussion of\nthese NSHAP measures and other quality of life measures\ncan be found in Drum and colleagues (this issue). However,\ndehydroxyepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels are assessed from\nsaliva, and DHEA has been associated with HPA axis activ-\nity (for a more detailed discussion, see Gavrilova and col-\nleagues, this issue ). Measures of cardiovascular activity and\natherosclerosis development in NSHAP include heart rate,\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure, and C-reactive protein.\nMetabolism and adiposity are measured using BMI and waist\ncircumference, and glucose metabolism is measured with\nHbA1c. For more detailed discussions on measuring allo-\nstatic load, see, for example, McEwen and Seeman (1999),\nSeeman and colleagues (2004), Seeman and colleagues\nConclusions\nNSHAP provides a combination of self-reported-rated and\ndirect biomeasures associated with health. The main objec-\ntive of this research was to provide the means by which to\nunderstand the variability in health outcomes in older adults\nby integrating biological and social measures. By providing\nboth self-reported and assessed measures, we hope that when\ncombined with the breadth of available social measures, we\nare providing a rich source of data to explore in an attempt to\nunderstand health outcomes in aging adults.\nFunding\nNSHAP is supported by the National Institutes of Health--the National\nInstitute on Aging, the Office of Women's Health Research, the Office of\nAIDS Research, and the Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research\n"
