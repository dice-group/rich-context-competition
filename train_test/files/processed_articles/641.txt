    "abstract": "Abstract: California's uninsurance rate of 22.7 percent is higher than the national average. The state's\nrate of employment-based insurance coverage--below the national average--is declining because of\nrising health insurance premiums, falling family incomes, and the changing structure of the economy\nand the labor market. Growing Medicaid coverage, fostered by expanded eligibility and falling\nincomes, has prevented rapid growth in the state's uninsured population. Anticipated cutbacks in\nfederal Medicaid funding, however, would increase California's uninsurance rate. Continuing cut-\nbacks in health services for the uninsured would reduce their access to health care and increase stress\non many private health services.\nCalifornia's uninsurance rate has persistently exceeded the national\naverage. Compared with the nation as a whole, a relatively smaller\nand declining proportion of California's population is covered by\nemployment-based health insurance. Expansion of Medicaid eligibility has\noffset declining employment-based health insurance, slowing growth of the\nstate's uninsured population and improving access to care for pregnant\nwomen and young children. Cutbacks in Medi-Cal (California Medicaid),\nhowever, together with changes in the health care market, are likely to\nincrease California's already high uninsurance rate. Increases in the number\nof uninsured persons, coupled with cutbacks in state and local health services\nfor the medically indigent, are likely to reduce access to health services for\nthis population and strain resources, even for persons with insurance.\nThis DataWatch examines changes in health insurance coverage in\nemployment-based health insurance, and Medi-Cal in relation to family\nwork status. The analyses describe changes over time within California and\nin comparison with the United States as a whole.\nSurveys (CPS) were used to develop estimates for California and the\nUnited States. The U.S. Census Bureau, which conducts the CPS, inter-\nviews a rotating sample of approximately 60,000 households nationwide,\nE.

The analyses for this DataWatch are based on\npopulation weights for each year derived from the 1990 census, with an\nadjustment for the census undercount; estimates for 1990 may differ from\nthose of other researchers who use CPS weights based on the 1980 census.1\nPersons insured by any source at any time during the preceding year were\ncounted as insured. Because a person may report multiple sources of cover-\nage during the preceding year, we created a single hierarchical variable that\nreflects a rank ordering of reported coverage. Persons were classified as\nhaving employment-based coverage if they had a group health plan. They\nwere classified as having private insurance if they did not have employ-\nment-based coverage but had other private insurance. Persons who had\nneither type of coverage but reported Medicaid coverage at any time during\nthe year were classified as covered by Medicaid. Persons who had none of\nthese types of coverage but were covered by Medicare or the Civilian\nHealth and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) or\nwere eligible for medical care through the Veterans Affairs (VA) system\nwere classified as having \"other public coverage.\" Finally, those who re-\nported no coverage from any source were considered uninsured.\nCPS data generate estimates for Medicaid coverage that are lower than\nthose derived from Medicaid administrative data. Some persons who are\nidentified in the CPS as uninsured may in fact be covered by Medicaid, and\nsome who report having private insurance coverage in the CPS actually\nmay be enrolled in private managed care plans whose premiums are paid by\nMedicaid. In addition, our hierarchical health insurance variable classifies\npersons who, at some time during the preceding year, had Medicaid cover-\nage and employment-based or private insurance as having the latter cover-\nage, rather than Medicaid. We have not adjusted the CPS estimates to\nmatch the Medicaid administrative data.\nThe CPS is the database most widely used to estimate health insurance\nstatus and coverage at the state level because it is a large national survey\nwith a sampling method designed to produce state-level as well as national\nestimates. Despite the limitations inherent in its health insurance ques-\ntions, the CPS thus has advantages over most other national surveys that\nobtain more comprehensive information about health insurance but do not\nlend themselves to state-level estimates.\nThe CPS yields reasonably precise estimates of insurance coverage for\nlarge groups in California because the state's sample size is large. Analyses\nof subgroups are less precise because the smaller numbers of respondents in\nsample subgroups make population estimates for them subject to greater\nerror. All differences in proportions reported in the narrative of this Data-\nWatch are statistically significant at p < .01, and most at p< .0001.2\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Among families with a\nfull-time, full-year worker that are below 200 percent of the poverty level,\nfor example, 29.4 percent are uninsured nationally, compared with 38.7\npercent of Californians.\nEmployment-based coverage. Employment-based coverage declined\namong many groups of adult workers. It fell among full-time, full-year\nemployees (workers with the best prospects of receiving health benefits);\namong employees in firms of all sizes but especially medium-size firms\n(twenty-five to ninety-nine employees); and in most industries, including\nboth high- and low-coverage sectors of the state's economy.\nEmployment-based coverage also declined sharply among families\nheaded by a self-employed worker (Exhibit 2). Among persons in families\nheaded by a full- or part-time employee, employment-based coverage re-\nmained statistically unchanged.\nCalifornia's economy does not distribute employment-based insurance\nequally among the state's ethnic groups. Among families with a full-time,\nfull-year employee, only 56.1 percent of Latinos and 71.5 percent of Afri-\ncan Americans had employment-based coverage in 1993, well below the\nrates for non-Latino whites (81.9 percent) and Asians (83.3 percent).\nAmong families with a full-time, part-year employee, families with a part-\ntime employee, and those with a self-employed worker, Asians share the\ndisadvantage of Latinos and African Americans, compared with non-\nimprove their rate of employment-based coverage, while African Ameri-\ncans' coverage plummeted.\nEmployment-based health insurance is much less prevalent among low-\nincome working families than among those with higher incomes. Among\nfamilies with a full-time, full-year employee, only 40.8 percent of those with\nfamily incomes below 200 percent of poverty had employment-based cover-\nabove that level. The income disparities are even greater among families\nwith a full-time, part-year employee; only 21.9 percent of those below 200\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Among families below 200\npercent of the poverty level, 22 percent had employment-based coverage in\nboth years, while among more affluent families, 74-75 percent had such\ncoverage in both years.\nDespite flat rates of employment-based coverage within income groups,\nincomes declined among all types of working families between 1989 and\n1993. Among families with a full-time, full-year employee as well as those\nwith a full-time, part-year employee, a part-time employee, or a self-\nemployed worker, middle-class incomes declined, and increasing numbers\nof these families lived in poverty. As their incomes declined, working\nfamilies lost employment-based coverage.\nMedi-Cal. Nearly half (46.6 percent) of nonelderly Medi-Cal beneficiar-\nies are in working families (Exhibit 4), virtually all of them below 200\npercent of the federal poverty level (for a family of four in 1993, for\ncent) of all nonelderly Medi-Cal beneficiaries are children and nonelderly\nadults in families headed by a full-time employee.\nNevertheless, Medi-Cal, like Medicaid nationally, remains a program\nespecially targeted to nonworking families with children, particularly those\nheaded by a single parent. Slightly more than half (53.4 percent) of\nnonelderly Medi-Cal beneficiaries are in families with no working adult,\nthe majority of which are single-parent households.\nCongressionally mandated, as well as state-initiated, enhancements in\nincome eligibility for pregnant women and young children have increased\nthe proportion of low-income persons who qualify for Medicaid benefits.\nCalifornia raised the income eligibility standard to 200 percent of the\npoverty level for infants and pregnant women, to 133 percent of poverty for\nchildren up to age six, and 100 percent for many older children (those born\nafter 1983). Medi-Cal coverage of the state's near-poor (family income\nThese eligibility changes increased Medi-Cal's importance as a source of\ncoverage for low-income children, relatively few of whom have job-based\ncoverage and many of whom depend on Medi-Cal as their sole coverage.\nMedi-Cal coverage rose from 42.4 percent of low-income children under\npercent, even though their rate of employment-based coverage remained\nstatistically unchanged.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Given\nthe state's large proportion of low-income working families that are not\ncovered by employment-based health insurance, California's relative gener-\nosity in Medicaid eligibility has restrained growth in the number of unin-\nsured persons and the rate of uninsurance.\nOther coverage. The proportion of all nonelderly Californians covered\nby privately purchased health insurance remained statistically unchanged\nfull-time, full-year employee and declining among those with a part-time\nemployee or self-employed worker, as well as among nonworking families.\nOther public programs, namely Medicare and CHAMPUS, covered a\nDiscussion And Policy Implications\nHealth insurance coverage in California is plagued by several fundamen-\ntal problems: declining employment-based health insurance, proposed caps\nin federal Medicaid funding, and pending cutbacks in state and local\nspending on indigent medical care. The effects of these problems are likely\nto be magnified by increasing competition in the health care market.\nSeveral factors contribute to California's high uninsurance rate, but the\nunderlying problem is the continuing deterioration of employment-based\ncoverage. Although this decline parallels the national trend, the problem\nhas been more severe in California, for several reasons.\nFalling incomes. Declining family incomes made health insurance less\naffordable for California's working families. In 1993, 20 percent of Califor-\nnia's nonelderly population were living in poverty, a rate one-third higher\npercent of the poverty level, well above the 1989 share of 33 percent. Even\namong families with a full-time, full-year employee, 23 percent had family\nDriven by California's loss of aerospace contracts, the long recession, and\nmore general economic restructuring, this decline in income reduced the\nresources that could be spent on the employee's share of health insurance\npremiums--or to buy health insurance in the private market.4\nDecreased job opportunities.

The proportion of the nonelderly population in nonworking\nfamilies increased from 12 percent to 14 percent, thus also reducing oppor-\ntunities to obtain employment-based coverage. At the same time, families\nheaded by a part-time employee increased from 7 percent to 9 percent of\nthe nonelderly population, while the proportion in families headed by a\nfull-time employee dropped from 73 percent to 70 percent. Families sup-\nported by self-employment also declined, from 8 percent of the nonelderly\npopulation to just 6 percent, probably accelerated by the growing business\nfailure rate. Another contributing factor, in both California and the nation\nas a whole, was a shift in employment from largely unionized, higher-\npaying, high-coverage industries (such as durable goods manufacturing and\npublic administration) to mainly nonunionized, lower-wage, low-coverage\nindustries (such as services and retail trades).\nIt is unclear to what extent these trends are the result of California's deep\nrecession--and thus might be eased with economic recovery--and to what\nextent they are the result of broader globalization and restructuring of the\neconomy--and therefore are more permanent conditions that will con-\ntinue to undermine employment-based insurance coverage.\nbased health insurance grew increasingly expensive for both employers and\nworkers, rising about 13 percent per year on average for health mainte-\nnance organizations (HMOs), 17 percent annually for preferred provider\norganizations (PPOs), and 19 percent annually for fee-for-service indem-\nnity plans.5 By 1993 the national average annual cost for single-person\ning premium costs led many firms to restructure their health benefit pro-\ngrams by purchasing less-expensive health plans, changing eligibility rules,\nincreased workers' share of premium costs for single coverage from 19\npercent to 29 percent of the total, on average, and for family coverage from\nEmployees and their families--faced with declining incomes, rising\nhealth insurance premiums, and a larger share of costs--found it increas-\ningly difficult to pay for employment-based coverage or to buy coverage in\nthe private nongroup market. By 1991 only 83 percent of full-time employ-\nees in the nation's medium- and large-size private firms participated in\nhealth plans offered by their employers, down from 92 percent in 1989.7\nCongress and the states, including California, expanded Medicaid eligibil-\nity, thereby offsetting much of the decline in employment-based coverage.\nThese changes enabled more working families to qualify for Medi-Cal\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

This shift from employment-based, private\ninsurance to public-sector coverage carries substantial fiscal consequences.\nPublic programs in California spent nearly $4 billion in 1992--$3.2 billion\nby Medi-Cal and $795 million by state and county indigent medical serv-\nices programs--to provide health services to children and adults in em-\nployed families not covered by employer-provided health insurance.8\nThese taxpayer-funded services are not only a benefit provided to those\nwho receive the services. They also subsidize employers that do not provide\ntheir workers with health benefits, since the provision of employment-\nbased insurance, despite its decline, remains the norm for the majority of\nemployees and their families. Employers that do contribute to their employ-\nees' health benefits, in effect, pay three times: once when they pay the costs\nof coverage for their workers; a second time in the form of a hidden\nsurcharge on their employees' health benefits to pay for private-sector\nservices used by the uninsured; and a third time in their taxes, part of which\nfund Medicaid and county health services provided to working families not\ncovered by employment-based health insurance.9 Employees, of course, also\nshare in these financial burdens.\nCalifornia has attempted to make health insurance more affordable for\nsmall firms and their workers. In 1993 The Health Insurance Plan of\nCalifornia (The HIPC), a state-run purchasing cooperative, began offering\nprivate coverage to workers and their dependents in eligible small firms.\nTwo years later The HIPC covered more than 91,000 persons, but only 21\npercent of employers that signed up with the program had previously not\nprovided insurance coverage, and only 14 percent of enrollees had pre-\nCalifornia's uninsured population.10\nAlthough helpful to some firms and workers, The HIPC and similar\npurchasing cooperatives are unlikely to overcome the more fundamental\nbarriers to coverage: the low incomes of many working families and indi-\nviduals, and the lack of incentives or requirements for employers to provide\nhealth benefits to their workers. For persons at 200 percent of the poverty\nlevel, for example, the premium for a comprehensive health plan would\nconsume at least 15 percent of annual family income.

Without\na financial contribution from an employer or government, health insurance\nis simply unaffordable for most working families and individuals, especially\nthose who are now uninsured. Employers have provided health insurance if\nit is necessary to attract and retain employees in a firm's labor market or\nbecause of collective bargaining agreements with unions; however, these\nincentives are much weaker now than they were in the past. Employers are\nunlikely to reverse the long-term decline in employment-based health\nbenefits in the absence of the type of mandate that business successfully\nfought in the recent health care reform struggle.11\nWhile employer-sponsored coverage has been declining, government has\noffset the burden on the private sector by expanding Medicaid coverage and\nlocal government medical services for the uninsured. But the 104th Con-\ngress and the states are likely to cut such government assistance, which\npotentially could leave many more than the current 6.5 million Califor-\nnians completely uninsured. Their access to health services will be more\ncompromised if Medi-Cal is capped or cut and if local government health\nservices are eliminated or cut back. Growing numbers of uninsured pa-\ntients, with fewer public-sector resources available to them, would threaten\nthe financial viability of private hospitals that serve this disadvantaged\npopulation. Faced with cost-conscious purchasers' demands for lower prices\nin an increasingly competitive health care market, providers likely would\nrespond by cutting or eliminating charity care, the costs of which can no\nlonger be shifted to private payers.\nThe downward slope of employment-based health insurance, and the\nfinancing it provides for health services, poses serious challenges for Cali-\nfornia and the nation. It portends shrinking access to care for those who do\nnot have such coverage, higher costs to employers that provide their work-\ners with health benefits, a growing fiscal burden for public programs that\nprovide health services to uninsured working families, and growing finan-\ncial vulnerability among the private providers that serve this population.\nThe proposed cutbacks in Medicaid funding are likely to increase the\nnumber of uninsured persons and exacerbate the stresses on both the\npublic- and private-sector financing of health services. These conditions\nmay force a return to the health care reform issues that Congress left\nThe research on which this DataWatch is based was funded in part by The California Wellness\nFoundation.
