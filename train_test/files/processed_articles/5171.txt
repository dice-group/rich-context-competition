The\nCJEU's function is to serve as the ultimate interpretative authority on questions of EU law,4 including when\nit engages in judicial dialogue with the national courts. Judicial dialogue is thus an essential feature of the\nEU legal system, given this particular character of its jurisdiction,5 a jurisdiction in which the CJEU and\nthe national courts are, to use the words of Advocate General Jacobs, `bridged together exclusively by the\npreliminary reference'.6 It is up to the CJEU and the national courts together, as a shared responsibility,7 to\nrule on matters of EU law.8 In the process of ruling on EU law under the preliminary reference procedure,\nthe CJEU has fleshed out most EU legal principles, forming what Mancini considers the `Constitution of\nEurope'.9 In this regard, Jacobs emphasises that the preliminary reference is an, albeit unsatisfactory,\nopportunity for individuals to enjoy the rights derived by them under EU law.10 Alongside the protection\nof individual rights, the preliminary reference procedure also plays a key role in guaranteeing that EU law is\nuniformly applied across the Member States.11 A quick look at the CURIA database and the Service Section\nof this journal shows that many judgments clarifying the meaning of EU environmental provisions are\nhanded down every year.\nIt is, therefore, important to study the proper functioning of the tandem composed of the CJEU and the\nnational courts in this field of EU law. Several studies have considered the advantages and shortcomings of\nthe preliminary reference mechanism in this regard, both in general12 or specifically to environmental\n2.

Far less attention has\nbeen paid to what occurs after the CJEU has responded to the national judges (the download phase).14 The\nresearch question to be addressed in the download phase thus concerns the manner in which national courts\nadminister the replies received from the CJEU following a preliminary reference in the field of environ-\nmental protection. This question has two aspects. First, it concerns the manner in which the referring\nnational court reacts to the CJEU's answer. Second, it concerns the manner in which other national courts\nreact to the CJEU's answer in the light of the unwritten stare decisis system confirmed by the `acte eclaire'\ndoctrine declared in Da Costa15 and CILFIT.16, 17 This article addresses only the first aspect, leaving the\nlatter for a follow-up study.\nSo far, only Bogojevic\n\u00b4 has addressed how national courts react to the CJEU's answers to their referred\nquestions, and then only for the Swedish courts.18 As further discussed in section 2.3, she mapped the\nSwedish courts' behaviour and unfolded four different categories of judicial dialogue: interchanged dia-\nlogue, gapped dialogue, interrupted dialogue and silenced dialogue.19 This mapping exercise was only a\nstarting point. She argues for greater attention to be paid to this particular aspect of judicial dialogue, given\nthat national court behaviours have, so far, not been mapped. Empirical data on this matter are fundamental\nto place theoretical discussions on judicial dialogue in perspective.\nAs Bogojevic\n\u00b4's findings are only a starting point, this article takes up the call to `to draw a grander map of\njudicial dialogues initiated across various Member States'.20 Following up on Part I of Bogojevic\n\u00b4's map,\nthis article presents Part II. More specifically, the topic investigated by this article is how the United\nKingdom (UK) courts follow up on the CJEU's answers to their preliminary references in the field of\nEU environmental law, from the UK's accession in 1972 until January 2017. Mapping the UK courts'\nbehaviour is important because it is claimed that the Community's status quo lacks justification in the eyes\nof the English courts, which, in turn, affects how they go about interpreting statutes.21 UK law and courts are\ntraditionally considered sceptical of environmental legislation and European integration. This aversion to\ngold-plating/green-plating means that most EU environmental law is implemented in UK law in almost\n13. V. Heyvaert, J. Thornton, and R.

Section 2 accordingly provides an account of what is meant by `judicial dialogue' and its micro\ndimension `judicial cooperation' (section 2.1), preliminary references in `environmental matters' (section\n2.2), the categories under which national courts responses to the CJEU's answers can be classified (section\n2.3), and the role played by the variables influencing judicial dialogue (section 2.4). Section 3 then provides\nthe empirical data, based on the mapping of UK courts' practice in environmental matters, followed by a\nsynthesis in Section 4. Our main findings are three new categories of interplay. All the cases we retrieved\nfrom the UK reveal a willingness to cooperate with the CJEU to various degrees. This section highlights the\nexistence of three trends. First, the national court applies the CJEU's judgment to the letter (full cooper-\nation); second, the CJEU decides to reformulate the question and the national court applies the CJEU's\nanswer inasmuch as it considers it relevant to the case (fragmented cooperation); third, the CJEU judgment\nis not applied, because the losing party withdraws from the proceedings, predicting full compliance (pre-\nsumed cooperation). These three new categories extend the map started by Bogojevic\n\u00b4 and therefore help\ndevelop a better insight into national court behaviour in the download phase of Article 267 TFEU proce-\ndures. Section 2 is also useful to steer comparative studies on this matter. Indeed, similar studies focusing on\nthe Netherlands, Germany, France and Italy are in the process of being finalised and will be the subject of\nseparate publications. Together, these empirical studies will flesh out a map of the judicial dialogue down-\nload phase in EU environmental matters. Once the actual shape of judicial dialogue in EU environmental\nmatters is described, an in-depth comparative research project can be conducted to unveil the reasons for the\nempirical findings presented in this paper and the coming ones described.\n2 Setting the stage: Judicial dialogue and judicial cooperation in preliminary\nreferences in environmental matters\n2.1 The micro dimension of judicial dialogue: judicial cooperation\nThere are various kinds of judicial dialogue.23 Jacobs highlights the two main features of the internal\njudicial dialogue in the EU legal system. The first is the `constitutional' judicial dialogue (that is, the\njurisdiction of the CJEU to hear complaints lodged by other EU institutions or the Member States).24\nSecond, and the object of this contribution, there is a judicial dialogue through the preliminary reference\nmechanism, or what Jacobs considers `[ . . . ] the most important feature of the judicial system of the\nCommunity [ . . . ]'.25 However, we argue that it is only possible to speak of a dialogue between judges at\nthe macro level \u00ad the level at which a national judiciary is considered as a whole. At the micro level, when\nconsidering the behaviour of individual courts, it is impossible to speak of a dialogue, simply because\nasking a question and receiving an answer can hardly be considered a dialogue. To summarise the\n22. L. Squintani, Gold-plating of European Environmental Law (PhD thesis, University of Groningen, 2013); H. Anker et al., `Coping\nwith EU Environmental Legislation: Transposition Principles and Practices' (2015) 1 JEL 17; J. Jans, L.

These contributions focus mostly on gold plating in\nstatutes, but also provide examples of gold plating in court.\n25. F. Jacobs and A. Durand, `References to the European Court: Practice and Procedure' [1976] 35(1) The Cambridge Law Journal 3.\nprocedure, lower courts have a right to ask a preliminary question,26 courts of last instance have an\nobligation in this regard27 and the CJEU has a duty to answer these questions. The national court referring\nthe question must comply with the CJEU's answer,28 but it does not have to report its final judgment to the\nCJEU. A quick look at the CURIA and Eurlex databases shows that information about the continuation of\nnational proceedings is usually missing. The CJEU's recommendations underline the desirability of a\npractice where national referring courts would report back to the CJEU how they have ruled on the matters\nsubject to the preliminary question, in light of the principle of sincere cooperation.29 Yet, when questioned,\nthe CJEU only confirmed that the preliminary ruling is binding on the referring court without providing any\ncomment on why the majority of national cases could not be located.30 How the national courts respond to\nthe CJEU's answers can thus hardly be considered as being directed at the CJEU, and therefore at best\namount to a dialogue of the deaf.31 Proposals have been made to improve the dialogue, ranging from making\na better use of Article 101 of the Rules of Procedure to inviting national referring judges to participate in the\nhearing before the CJEU, but they are not actually applied.32\nIn light of the normative background of the preliminary question and answer and the lack of a real\ndiscussion between the two main parties to the procedure, we will only speak of cooperative or uncoopera-\ntive dialogue at macro level. Instead, at micro level we prefer to discuss in terms of sincere cooperation\nrather than judicial dialogue. Indeed, the principle of sincere cooperation goes hand-in-hand with the\nobjective of the preliminary reference itself. First, because a judicial system which is built upon the division\nof competences between the national courts and the CJEU calls for a greater cooperation.33 Second, since it\nis through the correct application of preliminary references that the national courts are offered the oppor-\ntunity to demonstrate a cooperative attitude towards the CJEU par excellence.34 In this regard, it could\ndebatably be argued that the willingness of the national courts to refer questions to the CJEU might also\nindicate their willingness to give effect to its rulings.35 Yet rather than being based on mutual understanding,\njudicial cooperation can be affected by elements of conflict and a struggle for power, as wisely remembered\n28.

If it is\nunderstood in its broadest sense, it would encompass each case under Article 267 TFEU dealing with\nenvironmental issues. In turn, the concept of `environmental issues' in its broadest sense would encompass\n\u00ad alongside more traditional environmental matters39 \u00ad nuclear and other energy issues, animal health\nissues, product standards when linked to environmental concerns, national justifications of EU law, espe-\ncially in the context of the fundamental freedoms, etc. Such a broad approach, although suitable for\nunderstanding the relationship between national courts and the CJEU, would not provide a clear picture\nof whether the EU environmental law acquis is interpreted and applied uniformly. Moreover, a broad\napproach to the concept of `EU environmental law' would increase the chances of cases being added or\nomitted improperly from the analysis. The narrowest approach to the concept of `preliminary references in\nenvironmental matters' would be to look at cases under Article 267 TFEU in which an interpretation of acts\nbased on current Article 192 TFEU was required. Such a narrow approach would ensure the highest degree\nof consistency in the comparative approach. Yet it would exclude from the analysis cases which are usually\nconsidered `environmental cases', but which relate to an EU legal act which is not based on Article 192\nTFEU for the simple reason that the centre of gravity test favoured the application of a different legal basis.\nA compromise between the broadest and the narrowest approaches was achieved by searching Curia for\npreliminary references from the UK concerning environment, energy and provisions governing the insti-\ntutions. The results where then filtered for judgments which did not concern EU acts as defied in Article 288\nTFEU, having as their primary or explicit secondary objective the protection of the environment.\n2.3 Categories of judicial cooperation\nThe cases retrieved by means of the research criteria mentioned in section 2.2 can then be analysed to\nidentify the kind of judicial cooperation taking place. In this regard, all the cases can be categorised into two\nmain groups: cases supporting the existence of a cooperative dialogue, in which national courts can be\nconsidered as following the CJEU's answers and those supporting the existence of an uncooperative\ndialogue, in which national courts cannot be considered to being following the CJEU's answers. Unco-\noperative dialogue arises when the two main positive obligations and three negative obligations binding the\nnational courts according to Verhoeven are not respected.40 The positive obligations are that the courts\nshould ensure the effective application of EU law and the protection of rights stemming from EU legisla-\ntion; the negative obligations are that they should abstain from measures which impede the effectiveness of\nEU law, the proper functioning of the internal market or the process of EU integration.\nIt is within the category of cases sustaining the existence of an uncooperative dialogue that Bogojevic\n\u00b4's\ncategories can be located, albeit renamed in terms of interchanged cooperation, gapped cooperation,\n39. Such as water, air, soil, industrial emissions, environmental damage, etc.\ninterrupted cooperation and silenced cooperation,41 for the reasons indicated in section 2.1. Interchanged\ncooperation means that there is an interchange of values. The preliminary reference is absorbed into\nnational law and applied as though it were national case law.42 For example, in the Ga\n\u00a8vle Kraftva\n\u00a8rme the\nCJEU's had clarified what `incinerator' meant under the Waste Incineration Directive.43 The Swedish\nSupreme Court tasked a lower court to apply the criteria set out by the CJEU. In so doing, the lower court\nonly referred to the Swedish Supreme Court ruling not to the CJEU's ruling.44 The lower national court did\nnot treat the preliminary reference as though the information were provided by the CJEU.45 Gapped\ncooperation signifies that there is a lack of judicial dialogue between the CJEU and the national court.\nThere can be instances where a national court questions the validity of the CJEU's ruling.46 For example, in\nthe Billerud case the national court, after receiving the CJEU's ruling, considered whether the CJEU's\ninterpretation of the ETS Directive complied with the European Convention of Human Rights.47 This was\ndone without making further reference to the CJEU. There is then interrupted cooperation, which means\nthat national law may have been revised, and/or facts added, rendering the preliminary reference useless\nwhile the procedure remains ongoing.48 For example, in Jan Nilsson, the relevance of the CJEU's answer to\nthe question of whether stuffed species fell under the CITES Regulation lost importance as the criminal\noffence for trading in such species was abrogated, leading to the criminal charges against Mr Nilsson being\ndropped.49 Finally, Bogojevic\n\u00b4 proposes a category of silenced cooperation, covering cases where the\nnational court does not mention the preliminary ruling and ignores it.50 For example, in Mickelsson and\nRoos the national court ultimately cleared Mr Mickelsson and Mr Roos of the criminal charges on grounds\ndifferent from the ones considered in the CJEU's ruling, which was not even mentioned.51 Although these\ncases do not concern the interpretation of an EU directive aiming primarily or secondarily at environmental\nprotection, and would thus fall outside the scope of the research based on the criteria set out in section 2.2,\nthey still represent cases where a national court has not included the reasoning provided by the CJEU in its\nnational ruling. The CJEU's ruling is thus ignored.\nThis article considers whether cases from another jurisdiction than Sweden, the UK, fit within Bogo-\njevic\n\u00b4's categories, or whether new categories should be introduced. As elaborated in section 3, every case\nwe retrieved from the UK shows adherence to the CJEU's rulings to various degrees. Therefore, not all of\nthem fall under the categories indicated by Bogojevic\n\u00b4. Three new categories of judicial cooperation are\nintroduced here, and are fully explained and accounted for in section 3. First, full cooperation, where the\nnational court applies the CJEU's judgment to the letter; second, fragmented cooperation, where the CJEU\ndecides to reformulate the question and the national court applies the CJEU's ruling inasmuch as it can be\napplied the part of the answer that it considers relevant; and third, presumed cooperation, where the CJEU's\njudgment is not applied, because the party which is deemed to have lost before the CJEU withdraws from\nthe proceedings, expecting full the decision to be applied in full by the national judge.\n\u00a8vle Kraftva\nSquintani and Rakipi 95\n2.4 The role of factors influencing judicial dialogue and judicial cooperation\nIt goes without saying that as in any important cooperation, good communication in judicial matters is\nextremely important. This begins in the upload phase, where the national court must pose well-formulated\nquestions and provide additional information if necessary.52 Intervening parties, especially the Member\nState from which the questions originate, should help to provide a clear picture of the subject matter of the\nquestion, while refraining from changing its focus.53 From the CJEU's perspective, it must be borne in mind\nthat answering in abstractions and general principles may, in fact, be the best way to provide national courts\nwith the rules needed for a broad application of the CJEU's interpretation to the facts at hand; however, the\nCourt in Luxembourg must accept that by so doing, it is not controlling the outcome of concrete cases.54\nIndeed, this approach could lead to the rulings provided by the CJEU being considered too theoretical by\nnational judges to resolve the case in question.55 Judges might then choose not to apply such rulings.56\nAs such, the CJEU is required to be more precise if it wishes to avoid complicating the delivery and\nreception of a preliminary ruling because, as Prechal maintains, just like communication in other spheres of\nlife, something can always go wrong with judicial communication.57 To this end, the CJEU tries to help\npreserve the interpretative uniformity of EU law by delivering guidance cases which present a set of\nspecific circumstances to be taken into account to interpret a certain provision.58 A step further in control-\nling the outcome of national cases would be for the CJEU to deliver outcome cases, in which the CJEU\nwould only state that a Member State, for instance, had failed to implement a directive correctly, thus\nleaving to the national court only the outcome of striking down the decision taken in breach of EU law.59\nThe different working languages of the national and EU courts, in this case French and English, as well as\ndiffering drafting practices, can also influence judicial dialogue and consequently how national courts\nfollow up CJEU's rulings.60\nAll these variables are important to understanding why a national court behaves in a particular way, but\nthey are irrelevant as far as this study's mapping exercise is concerned. Indeed, as in Bogojevic\n\u00b4's study, the\nquestion lying at the heart of this article is how national courts react to a CJEU ruling, not why they react in a\nparticular way. The variables indicated in this section are relevant for follow-up studies explaining the\nmeaning and relevance of the finding presented in this study. Such follow-up studies will also have to take\ninto account the meta-juridical aspects related to judicial cultures and national attitudes towards the EU\nintegration process. The comparative methodology needed to link the national experiences together requires\na rigid framework to avoid comparing `apples' and `pears', hence requiring the setting up a broad research\nproject with the help of external funding, such as the H2020-funding programme, to be applied. Accord-\ningly, while we will keep these variables in mind, we do not address the `why' question in this study. We\nwill confine ourselves in sections 3 and 4 to indicating whether, based on the information at our disposal,\nany or all of the variables mentioned in this section can be observed. This does not detract from the\nrelevance of this study because, as stated in the introduction, it is only possible to organise and conduct\n53. We are grateful to Jurian Langer for pointing out to us the importance of the role of national agents in the context of preliminary\nreferences procedures.\n54. G. Davies, `Activism Relocated.

As shown in the following three sections, three new\ncategories, all demonstrating judicial cooperation, should be added to the judicial dialogue map, when we\nlook at the behaviour of UK courts in environmental matters.\nUK scepticism of the EU integration process,61 its minimalistic approach to the implementation of EU\nobligations62 and the reluctance of UK courts to ask preliminary references63 are well documented in\nacademic writing.

This\nmight have also been the case for the other 22 cases for which no-national follow-up could be retrieved,71\nbut out-of-court settlements or other reasons could also explain the impossibility of locating the remaining\nfollow-up cases.\nAll the cases we retrieved from the UK show the CJEU's rulings being followed, to various degrees. This\nsection highlights the existence of three trends. First, the national court applies the CJEU's judgment to the\nletter (full cooperation), as discussed in section 3.1; second, the CJEU decides to reformulate the question\nand the national court applies the resulting decision as far as it can be applied (fragmented cooperation), as\ndiscussed in section 3.2; third, the CJEU judgment is not applied because the losing party withdraws from\nthe proceedings, implying full cooperation (presumed cooperation), as discussed in section 3.3.\n3.1 First category: Full Cooperation\nNational courts, in light of the principle of sincere cooperation, must ensure that the judicial dialogue\nbetween them and the CJEU runs smoothly by demonstrating cooperative conduct in applying the CJEU's\nguidance. As regards the latter aspect, such cooperative conduct was evident in five cases in the UK,72 with\nthe national judges deciding completely in accordance with the CJEU's decision, although in one such case\nthis conclusion requires qualification.\nFull cooperation was easy to establish in those cases where the Court of Justice delivered an outcome\ncase (that is, where it indicated whether a given interpretation of the EU act in question is right or wrong).\nThis was the case, for example, in R v Secretary of State for the environment (ex parte Society of Birds).73\nThe case concerned a decision of the Secretary of State excluding some 22 acres of land near Lappel Bank\nfrom consideration as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), in the grounds of economic interests.

Royal Society for the Protection of Birds above n. 67.\nBirds Directive,74 the House of Lords asked the CJEU for its opinion. The House of Lords also asked\nwhether anything would change if the economic considerations constituted matters of superior general\ninterest or reasons of overriding public interest.\nThe CJEU answered both questions in the negative.75 It held that the Member States are not authorised to\ninclude economic considerations in their decisions delineating SACs. Moreover, it held that even if these\nconsiderations are of overriding public interest, they cannot be taken into account at the stage of delineating\na SAC, but only at a later stage.\nIn line with the CJEU's interpretation, the House of Lords quashed the decisions handed down by the\nCourt of Appeal and the High Court and declared invalid the decision of the Secretary of State regarding the\ndelineation of a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive, on the grounds that the Secretary of\nState had taken economic requirements into consideration in reaching the decision in question. The House\nof Lords also stated that within the context of delineating a special protection area, the Secretary of State\nwas not authorised to take economic requirements into consideration as imperative reasons, as indicated in\nthe Wild Birds Directive.76 In so doing, a full account was given of the CJEU's ruling, meaning that this\ncannot be described as silenced cooperation, as happened in Sweden in the Mickelsson and Roos case.77\nA similar finding can be drawn from another outcome case, that of Diane Barker v Bromley Council.78\nLondon & Regional Properties Ltd applied to Bromley Council for outline planning permission to develop a\nleisure complex. Bromley Council concluded in 1998 that an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)\nenvisaged under the EIA Directive79 was not required, and granted outline planning permission subject to\nsome reserved matters for subsequent approval. When a decision was needed for approval of the reserved\nmatters, some Bromley councillors requested an EIA, but under English law it was no longer possible to\ncarry one out at that stage. Final approval was therefore granted in 1999 without an EIA. Ms Barker\nchallenged this decision, but her action was dismissed both in the first instance and on appeal. She then\nappealed before the House of Lords. The House of Lords had doubts about whether the permission was a\n`development consent' under the old EIA Directive and also whether the EIA could be carried out at a later\nstage of the consent, if initially it was believed that it was not required. It therefore asked first, whether the\nconcept of development consent should be interpreted by considering national law exclusively. Second, it\nasked whether the directive requires an EIA to be carried out if, following the grant of outline planning\npermission subject to conditions that reserved matters be approved, and without an EIA having been carried\nout, it emerges when approval of the reserved matters is sought that the project may have a significant effect\non the environment by virtue, inter alia, of its nature, size or location.\n75.

We could not retrieve the national judgment itself from Bailii, Westlaw, the website of the House of Lords or any other source.\n79. Then, Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the\namending Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment [2014]\nSquintani and Rakipi 99\nThe CJEU answered that the national court, when deciding if planning permission can be considered a\n`development consent', cannot exclusively look at national considerations, but should apply national law in\na manner consistent with EU law. Second, the CJEU held that when national law provides for a consent\nprocedure of more than one stage in which the latter stage cannot extend beyond the parameters set by the\nprincipal decision, the EIA should be performed at the time of the principal decision. However, if\nthe adverse effects cannot be identified at the initial stage, the EIA should be carried out in the context\nof the implementing decision.80\nIn line with the CJEU's interpretation, and presenting a full account of it, the House of Lords did not\nconsider national law exclusively when interpreting the concept of `development consent'. It stated that\nproceedings granting outline planning permission subject to subsequent approval by the relevant authority\nshould be deemed a `consent procedure' under the EIA Directive.81 Quashing the Court of Appeal decision,\nthe House of Lords held that by precluding an EIA at a later stage of the consent procedure, the Planning\nRegulations 1998 had failed to transpose the directive correctly. Moreover, Bromley Council was wrong\nwhen it concluded that an EIA was not possible at a later stage in the decision.\nRemaining within the realm of the EIA Directive, the fourth case showing full cooperation is Mellor v\nSecretary of State.82 The case is about a planning permission granted in an Area of Outstanding Natural\nBeauty (AONB). Following the applicant's appeal, the planning permission was quashed on grounds that\nthe council had not adopted an EIA opinion. At a later stage, the Secretary of State decided differently and\nstated that it was not necessary for him to adduce additional reasons to his decision not to conduct an EIA,\nbased on an at-that-time relevant precedent in English case law. The England and Wales Court of Appeal\nhad its own doubts and decided to ask the CJEU if, under the EIA Directive, Member States are obliged to\ncommunicate reasons for refusing to carry out an EIA, and if the motivation already expressed by the\nSecretary of State formally satisfied any potential duty to provide reasons.\nThe CJEU held that public authorities are not required to provide reasons for a refusal to adopt an EIA.\nHowever, authorities are obliged to provide the relevant reasons for their determination upon the request of\nan interested party. Furthermore, the CJEU stated that the Secretary of State's reasoning could be consid-\nered sufficient as long as it had taken into account the information provided by the parties, supplemented by\nother information capable of allowing the parties to appeal that decision, something which was for the\nnational court to assess.83\nBy the time the CJEU's decision reached the England and Wales Court of Appeal, various events had\noccurred. First, two more screening directions had been provided, rendering the original screening direction\nof the Secretary of State irrelevant. Second, the planning permission had been withdrawn. The England and\nWales Court of Appeal was thus, in theory, not obliged to follow the CJEU's decision, since the `old\nreferring facts' had been superseded by others. Cooperation between the national court and the CJEU could\nhave followed the pattern described as interrupted cooperation, as observed in Sweden in the context of the\nJan Nilsson case.84 This did not turn out to be the case. The England and Wales Court of Appeal applied\nthe CJEU's ruling, and accordingly awarded costs. The England and Wales Court of Appeal went into the\ndetails of the correspondence between the Mr Mellor and the State.85 It resisted the attempts of the\ndefending parties to focus only on the part of the CJEU's ruling stating that there is no obligation to provide\n85. Court of Appeal (England & Wales), R (Mellor) v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government [2009] EWCA Civ\nreasons in a decision not to conduct an EIA. The England and Wales Court of Appeal was clear that there is\nan obligation to provide such information if such a request has been made. It also considered that Mr Mellor\nhad made such a request. Accordingly, it concluded that the state had failed to provide information at the\ntime of the request. That such information had ultimately been provided did not change the fact that Mr\nMellor had had to commence proceedings to challenge the initial refusal. Accordingly, the state was ordered\nto pay the costs of the proceedings.\nThe CJEU also delivered an outcome case regarding one of the two questions posed by the High Court of\nJustice (England & Wales) in the Thames Water ruling.86 Thames Water was facing criminal proceedings\nbecause it had allegedly deposited untreated sewage water on land. There were discrepancies as to whether\nthe waste deposited actually constituted `controlled waste' under the Old Waste Directive87 or waste within\nthe meaning of English legislation. The criminal proceedings brought by the Environment Agency would\nstand if the waste was considered waste under the directive. In its preliminary ruling request the High Court\nof Justice (England & Wales) asked the CJEU whether `water waste' constituted `waste' within the meaning\nof the directive. Moreover, the national court wanted to know whether the waste could be excluded from the\nscope of the directive by virtue of an exception in the latter specifying that it would cover the waste insofar\nthere is no `other legislation'.\nFollowing the questions as formulated by the High Court of Justice (England & Wales) almost to the\nletter, as regards the first question the CJEU answered that `water waste' did not alter the character of waste,\nand thus as regards the second question, it is indeed within the scope of the directive. In line with the\ninterpretation by the CJEU, the High Court of Justice (England & Wales) accepted that the water waste was\nindeed waste within the meaning of the directive.88 In doing so, a full account was provided of the Court of\nJustice's reasoning for its conclusions.\nFull cooperation can also be observed in cases where the CJEU left more leeway to the national court\nby means of a guidance case. In the already discussed Thames Water case, as regards the second question,\nie whether the waste could be excluded from the scope of the directive by virtue of an exception in the\nlatter providing that the directive covers waste insofar as there is no `other legislation', the CJEU held that\nfor waste to be covered by `other legislation', it had to contain `precise provisions organizing the\nmanagement of waste' and `a level of protection equivalent to that under EU law'. Accordingly, it\ninstructed the national court to ascertain whether the national rules governing waste contended by\nThames Water met such criteria.\nThe High Court of Justice (England & Wales) then looked at the specific pieces of `other legislation'\nmentioned by one of the parties to the proceedings, and decided in the negative.89 By so doing it fully took\ninto account the criteria laid down by the CJEU, and held that it was bound to decide only on those and no\nothers.90 The Court considered the regimes invoked by the defendant were unable to satisfy the CJEU's test\nin that they were merely `[ . . . ] dispersed regimes addressing harmful effects [ . . . ] and not precise pro-\nvisions governing the management of waste'.91\n86. Case C-252/05 The Queen on the Application of: Thames Water Utilities Ltd v South East London Division, Bromley Magistrates'\nCourt ECLI: EU: C:2007:276; Thames Water Utility Ltd v Bromley Magistrates' Court and The Environment Agency [2008]\nA similar conclusion can be reached regarding Edwards v Environment Agency;92 yet this conclusion\nshould be qualified. This case concerns the prohibitive nature of proceedings costs in environmental justice.\nA decision approving the operation of a cement works was challenged by the applicant in court. The\napplicant was refused legal aid and was ordered to provide a guarantee of \u00a325,000 to take part in\nthe proceedings. The applicant relied on the EIA Directive and the IPPC Directive,93 which state that the\nprocedure must not be `prohibitively expensive'. Under these circumstances, the Supreme Court decided to\nask the CJEU, in essence, what `prohibitively expensive' meant, and upon which criteria should this\ndetermination be made.\nThe CJEU maintained that `prohibitively expensive' referred to an amount capable of preventing a\nperson from pursuing a claim for review of a decision.94 This determination had to be done on the basis\nof the financial status of the applicant, the environmental interest, whether the applicant had any prospect of\nsuccess, what the applicant's interest was, the complexity of the law, the potential frivolous nature of the\nclaim, and the legal aid scheme.95 These criteria were to be applied to each stage of the proceedings.\nThe Supreme Court, obeying the CJEU's interpretation, considered every single factor and applied them\nto the facts at hand.96 Lord Carnwath applied the Court of Justice's response in the part which referred to the\nneed to apply the criteria to determine whether the costs were prohibitive regardless of the stage of the\nproceedings in which the costs are decided. The Supreme Court then sought guidance from the opinions of\nthe Advocate Generals on this point in other cases. The Supreme Court then went on to apply the criteria set\nout by the Court of Justice. Even though the national court used only a part of the criteria laid down by the\nCJEU to determine whether the costs were prohibitive, it did not refrain from considering all the criteria set\nout before discounting the rest on grounded reasons. The Court found that the matter was not frivolous but\nthat the appellant did have any economic interest in the matter. Furthermore, it also held that the case was\nnot particularly complex. It ultimately made its decision, based on the two remaining factors, namely the\nprospects of success and the importance of the case for the protection of the environment, finding that the\nguarantee of \u00a325,000 pounds was not unreasonably high.\nIt is debatable whether this outcome is positive or negative from the perspective of environmental\nprotection.97 From a substantive perspective, it can be argued that the Supreme Court should have con-\ncluded that a guarantee of \u00a325,000 pounds is too high. Yet it can also be argued that this decision represents\na step towards ensuring that people are not denied access to environmental matters solely based on costs, a\n92.

Sarathy, `Costs in Environmental Litigation: Venn v Secretary of the State for Communities and\nExpensive\" Judicial Proceedings under the Aarhus Convention and the ECJ as an International (Environmental) Law Court:\nsensitive issue in the UK.98 From a substantive perspective, it is therefore difficult to say whether this is a\ncase of compliance or not. What emerges from both the objective and subjective factors laid down by the\nCJEU is the strong focus on the reasonableness and proportionality of costs, obliging a court to take the\nparticular circumstances of the applicant and the case into account when ruling on the whether the costs are\nprohibitive.99 This means that the national rules of procedure must leave the national court a wide margin of\ndiscretion to assess the proportionality of the costs.100 From a procedural perspective, the Supreme Court\nused such room for manoeuvre and assessed the national rules in light of the CJEU's guidance. Accordingly,\ndespite the reservations about the substantive aspects of the ruling, we consider this case an example of full\njudicial cooperation.\n3.2 Second category: Fragmented Cooperation\n`Fragmentation' refers to the national court separating what it considers relevant to resolving the dispute in\nquestion from the CJEU's full response, from what it considers irrelevant. This category differs from\nBogojevic\n\u00b4's gapped category in that in the latter, the national court would omit certain parts of the issue\nwhen requesting a preliminary reference and the CJEU would rule only on the other parts. In the former, the\nnational court does not omit any part of the problem in its question, but instead chooses to only engage with\nthe parts of the preliminary reference response that it deems helpful for delivering its judgment, while\nignoring the reasoning of the rest. As elaborated below, this `engage and discard' game played by the\nnational court resulted from miscommunication between the CJEU \u00ad which did not explain the link between\nthe originally formulated question and the reformulated question answered \u00ad and the national court \u00ad which,\nbesides asking an awkward question, failed to attempt to link the CJEU's ruling to the original question.\nThe Client Earth case concerns air quality management.101 The territory of the UK was divided into 43\nzones for the purposes of assessing and managing air quality in accordance with Directive 2008/50/EC.102\nOne or more of the limit values established by the directive for nitrogen dioxide was exceeded in the course\nof 2010 in 40 of those zones. A final compliance plan was submitted to the Commission under the directive,\nwhich sought time extensions for 24 of the 40 zones. The UK did not make any such application for the\nremaining 16 zones, and projected compliance with the limit values between 2015 and 2025 in its air quality\nplans. ClientEarth brought a claim in the High Court, seeking an order requiring the Secretary of State for\nthe Environment to revise the plans to ensure that they would comply by January 2015 at the latest, which\nwas the maximum deadline extension under Article 22 of the Directive. That court dismissed the claim,\nholding that even if a Member State had not complied with the limit values set out by the directive, it is not\nrequired to apply under Article 22 for an extension of the deadline laid down by it. The court added that, in\nany event, such an order would raise serious political and economic questions and involve political choices\nwhich are not within the court's jurisdiction. The claim reached the Supreme Court, which found it\nnecessary to request a preliminary ruling on several issues. First, it asked whether the Secretary of State\nwas obliged to make an application for the extension of the time limits for achieving compliance values.\n98. See, e.g., Leigh, Day & Co Solicitors and WWF-UK `Using the Law: Barriers and Opportunities for Environmental Justice'\n[2004] Capacity Global \"Environmental Justice\" Environmental Law Foundation; P. Stookes Civil Law Aspects of Environ-\nmental Justice (London: Environmental Law Foundation, 2003); R. Macrory and M. Woods Modernising Environmental Justice\n(London: UCL, 2003); I. Sullivan `Ensuring Access to Environmental Justice in England and Wales' [2008] Working Group on\nAccess to Environmental Justice, chaired by the (then) Hon Mr Justice Sullivan.\nSecond, whether drawing up additional air quality plans, instead of an application for extension of the time\nlimits, could be considered as compliance with the directive. Finally, could a national court issue an order\nobliging the national authorities to establish an air quality plan where they have not applied for a post-\nponement of a deadline.\nThe CJEU did not explicitly address whether the Secretary of State was obliged to trigger Article 22. This\nis understandable given that it is clearly worded as a prerogative and not as a duty.103 This means that\nMember States are not obliged to use this provision if they wish to comply with the deadlines under the\ndirective by 2010. However, as the CJEU clarified, if Member States wish to comply by 2015, hence\nextending the deadlines, then Article 22 must be used. On whether preparing air quality plans instead of\nseeking the extension of a deadline could be considered as compliance with the directive, the CJEU\nresponded in the negative. It maintained that extending the deadline and drawing up air quality plans belong\nto two different scopes of application, and as such do not affect one another.104 Finally, the CJEU held that\nwhere a Member State fails to meet its obligations under the directive and does not apply for an extension of\nthe time limits to meet these obligations, the national court is empowered to order the authorities to draw up\nWhen reformulating the Supreme Court's first question, the CJEU missed the opportunity to avoid\nambiguity as to whether the Secretary of State breached Article 22 of the Directive by not applying for\nan extension of the deadline before extending it. The question was reformulated from `Was he obliged to?'\nto `Does a postponement of the deadline require an application under Article 22?' The fact that the deadline\nhad been extended in any event was not considered. This led to both parties claiming success as to the\nmandatory nature of the obligation under Article 22. It is hard to see how extending a deadline without\nrequesting an extension under Article 22, as occurred in the UK, can be considered as complying with the\ndirective. The CJEU's judgment could have been used to conclude that Article 22 must be used to obtain an\nextension, given that the UK had wanted to obtain one. Yet the Supreme Court considered that the CJEU's\nreasoning was insufficient to rule on whether the Secretary of State was under an obligation to make an\napplication under Article 22. Accordingly, the Supreme Court decided to refer to the position elaborated by\nthe European Commission in the proceedings, which argued that an extension to a deadline was not\nmandatory. The Supreme Court was willing to apply the Commission's reasoning and deem Article 22\nnon-mandatory, but given that the legal deadlines had already expired at that time, the court deemed this\nIt is not clear whether or not this route will lead to collision with the CJEU, since the CJEU was never\nexplicit on the obligation of the Secretary of State, but only on the obligation to apply for an extension to\navoid breaching the directive.107 There does, however, appear to be a tendency to go beyond the CJEU's\nruling and use the Commission to fill in the gaps. This technique was also observed in Edwards, where the\nSupreme Court used opinions of the Advocate Generals to fill in the perceived lacuna in the CJEU's\nNevertheless, the Supreme Court never considered whether the Secretary of State was under any obli-\ngation because by the time the proceedings reached it in late 2015, the role of the Secretary of State had\nbecome irrelevant, as the obligation to meet the directive's standards had expired in 2010. Arguably, a link\n103. Note the use of the modal verb `may' in the text of the article.\n106. R (on the application of ClientEarth) v Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [2015] UKSC 28, para. 27.\n107. For an analysis of the case see J. Bell, `ClientEarth (No. 2): A Case of Three Legal Dimensions' (2017) 29 Journal of Envi-\ncould be drawn between this part of the ClientEarth case and the interrupted cooperation category observed\nin Sweden in the Jan Nilsson case.109 However, in contrast to the Swedish Court, the UK judge did not\nignore the CJEU's answer.110 Moreover, the rest of the CJEU's judgment remained relevant and it was\nfollowed by the Supreme Court. In line with the CJEU's judgment, the Supreme Court considered the\nbreach of the directive, and issued an order for the Secretary of State to draft an air quality plan, even though\nit deemed this act as a purely political decision outside of its jurisdiction.\n3.3 Third category: Presumed Cooperation\nThe proper application of a preliminary ruling is regarded as the last step in a fully coordinated judicial\ncooperation chain. However, as briefly introduced earlier in this article, it can happen that the party losing the\ncase before the CJEU withdraws from the national proceedings. In such cases the judicial cooperation chain\nbreaks, and the national decision `disappears', making it impossible to gauge the national court's degree of\ncompliance. This type of withdrawal must be distinguished from when, for instance, parties agree a settlement\nand the national court withdraws the reference request. In this case, the CJEU will not rule on the matter,\nunless it has already given notice of a date on which its decision will be communicated.111 For the purposes of\nthis article only the former withdrawal will be considered. In both the cases discussed below, the advocate for\none of the parties informed us that the case had been withdrawn because the party which considered itself\nhaving come off worst before the CJEU expected the national court to followed its judgment. This suggests\nthat the case was withdrawn because the party predicted full compliance on the part of the national judge. This\nis why we consider these cases examples of presumed cooperation, rather than uncooperation.\nThis category does not cover cases which were withdrawn for any other reason than the one indicated\nhere, such as when parties reach an out-of-court settlement. In such other cases, no cooperation, actual or\npresumed, occurs. Such cases therefore fall outside the scope of this study.\nThe first presumed cooperation case is Seaport v Department of Environment.112 This case concerns a\nrequest made by Seaport to challenge the validity of the Department of Environment's Area Plan 2016 in\nNorthern Ireland. The national court had previously found in another case that area plans should no longer\nfall under the Department of Environment's competence, based on its interpretation of Directive 2001/\n42,113 which requires Member States to designate another authority to carry out this task. However, the\nmatter still needed some clarification and made it to the CJEU. The CJEU responded in the negative,\nholding that as long as the `old' authority was equipped to fulfil the tasks entrusted to it by the directive,\nthere was no need to establish a fresh national authority for the same task. Upon delivery of the judgment,\nSeaport withdrew its claim, so it was never further determined by the national court.114\nThe second case is Etimine SA.115 This was a very technical and legally complex outcome case dealing with\nthe classification and packaging of dangerous substances. On 19 December 2008, Etimine brought an action\nagainst the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions before the High Court of Justice of England and Wales,\nQueen's Bench Division (Administrative Court) for judicial review of any measures taken by the United\n110. In Jan Nilsson the criminal charges had been dropped due to the depenalisation of the crime he had allegedly committed.\n111. Article 100(1) of the consolidated version of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice of 25 September 2012; see also Case\n\u00b4 e\n\u00b4s Szolga\n\u00b4ltato\n114. As confirmed by e-mail from the case counsel James Maurici, Landmark Chambers, 8 March 2017.\nKingdom Government to implement the classifications introduced by the Thirtieth ATP Directive116 and the\nFirst ATP Regulation.117 Etimine contested the validity of the classifications of five entries in Annex 1G to the\nThirtieth ATP Directive, which were reproduced in Annexes II and V to the First ATP Regulation, classifying\ncertain borate substances as toxic to reproduction. Etimine SA complained that the European Commission had\nviolated the principle of proportionality and several procedural requirements including the duty to provide\nreasons, when classifying `borate' substances as dangerous substances. The CJEU found no violation of the\nprinciple of proportionality and deemed the Commission's endeavours legally sound. The national claims here\nwere withdrawn because Etimine lost at the CJEU stage and decided not to continue.118\n4 Synthesis and Comparison\nIt was noted previously in Bogojevic\n\u00b4's contribution that the Swedish courts displayed a more diverse array\nof judicial cooperation. They ranged from complete non-implementation of the CJEU's ruling to the non-\nreferral of certain legal issues raised in the national proceedings, followed by ambiguous and legally\nintricate responses from the CJEU. Conversely, something different emerged in the UK. UK judges tend\nto follow the CJEU's rulings as closely as possible.119 They give full account of the CJEU's reasoning,\ntherefore refraining from engaging in silenced cooperation.\nArguably, a common characteristic of all the cases in the present study is that the CJEU's instructions\nwere fairly simple to follow. For instance, in Edwards v Environment Agency, the court merely fleshed out\nexisting guidelines, just as it did in Thames Water. The CJEU set out a number of criteria to be taken into\naccount when determining the meaning of the concept of `prohibitively expensive'. The national court was\nthen only required to take those circumstances into account and reach a decision. As pointed out in section 2,\nthese `guidance' cases are generally easy to follow.120 It was also noted above that `outcome' cases are\nsimple to follow. For example, in Diane Barker v Bromley Council the CJEU's answer was simple in that it\nonly had to prescribe that the UK had failed to implement the directive in question correctly by enacting a\nnational law precluding an EIA at a later stage. As such, the national court was only left with the task of\nstriking down the national authority's decision not to grant the EIA.\nIn general, the cases forming the body of this study did not include examples of abstract and general\nanswers, which as introduced in section 2, offer a wider margin of manoeuvre for the national court, but\nless certainty that the outcome at a national level will be as the CJEU prescribed. Only in ClientEarth\ncould the national court's approach to the CJEU's answer be said to deviate from the letter of the\nEuropean judges' dictum. Yet this outcome is influenced by an instance of poor communication between\nthe national court and the CJEU. A closer look at this case reveals that, despite the miscommunication, the\nSupreme Court was willing to apply the Commission's reasoning to fill in the perceived gaps left by the\nCJEU. Ultimately, the national court did not need to apply the Commission's reasoning since the tem-\nporal exception relied upon by the national authority had elapsed in the meantime. In turn, this led to\nfragmentation of the cooperation, whereby the national court only applied the part of the CJEU's ruling\napplicable to the remaining part of the case.\nand packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548 and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regu-\n118. As confirmed by e-mail from the case counsel Victoria Wakefield, Brick Court Chambers, 8 March 2017.\n119. We remind here that Scottish courts have not made preliminary references in environmental matters.\nIt thus appears that the manifest compliance in the UK circumvents any potential discussion about\nliability claims under the Kobler doctrine for not properly implementing the preliminary ruling in question.\nThis contrasts with the findings for Sweden of Bogojevic\n\u00b4's study, where the national courts did not always\ndemonstrate tendencies towards mutual understanding, and would deviate from the preliminary rulings\nreceived. Evidently, as was also pointed out in the introduction to this article, judicial dialogue can consist\nof elements of conflict and power (as in Sweden) but also mutual understanding (as in the UK). The findings\nfor the UK demonstrate that judicial dialogue there has displayed characteristics of mutual understanding\nwith little or no struggle for power. This mutual understanding and non-existent struggle also appears to\ncontradict Bobek's assumption that national courts disregard both EU law and EU authority.\nBased on these findings, the map of judicial dialogue in the EU as regards environmental matters can be\nenriched as follows:\nThe marked difference in the outcomes of the empirical research in Sweden and the UK suggests the\nnational judicial culture has a strong impact on judicial dialogue. In particular, comparing the findings from\nthese two countries raises a question on the relationship between legislative practice as regards green-plating\nand gold-plating and judicial sincere cooperation. It is indeed interesting to note that a country which is\nFigure 1. Map of judicial dialogue in environmental matter in the EU (2 MS) \u00ad Derived from Council of the European\nconsidered at the forefront of environmental protection from a legislative perspective, demonstrates instances\nof judicial uncooperation. In contrast, a country which rarely goes any further than the minimum prescribed by\nEU environmental standards performs remarkably well as regards judicial cooperation in environmental\nmatters. There is some strength to the argument that the more national environmental law remains close to\nEU environmental law, the less room there is for national courts to deviate from CJEU's rulings. Moreover, it\nshould not be forgotten that to qualify as green-plating and gold-plating, national law must comply with EU\nlaw.122 Therefore, cases of interchanged cooperation, gapped cooperation, interrupted cooperation and\nsilenced cooperation deriving from a lawful discrepancy between national and EU environmental law should\nnever lead to under-implementation or a failure to implement EU environmental standards.\n5 Conclusions\nThis study shows that UK courts tend to cooperate fully with the CJEU. Three new categories of judicial\ncooperation have been highlighted in this regard: full cooperation, fragmented cooperation and presumed\ncooperation. This finding confirms that mapping judicial dialogue is an ongoing process. Indeed, in this\nstudy, none of Bogojevic\n\u00b4's categories could be used to describe the UK. New categories could emerge if\nother jurisdictions are analysed.\nThis study also suggests that national cultures influence judicial sincere cooperation in environmental\nmatters. More research is necessary to explore judicial dialogue fully, covering more national legal cultures\nthan covered so far. This would also permit us to advance from describing the kinds of judicial cooperation\nevidenced to an analysis of the reasons behind the national courts' behaviour. We would therefore argue for the\nestablishment of a comparative research programme to consider follow-up judgments in environmental matters.\nIt also appears that the majority of the CJEU's judgments are not followed by a national judgment in the\nUK, or that such judgments cannot be retrieved. Most cases where a preliminary question is posed simply\ndisappear from EU and national databases once the CJEU provides its response. There is an acute lack of\ntransparency about the reasons for such lacunae. We were only able to establish in a few cases that the\nnational party disadvantaged by the CJEU's answer withdrew from the case, as it expected the national court\nto comply with its ruling. Assuming that this was true of all other cases can be misleading. We also noticed\nthat, in one case, information about the national follow-up case was only available on Curia, but not at\nnational level. It is unclear how this can be possible.\nThere is a need for greater transparency in light of the importance of proper judicial cooperation and\njudicial dialogue in assuring uniformity in the interpretation and application of EU law. The ongoing\njudicial practice on preliminary reference follow-up lacks such transparency and invites improvement.\nWe urge for a closer application of the CJEU's recommendation on this point. Further steps should also\nbe considered. For example, the adoption of a legal obligation in this regard, echoing similar ones in the\nsphere of national implementation of EU directives, would help create what is not possible today, namely a\nmore systematic database of judicial dialogue and cooperation which is amenable to scrutiny and study.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n122.
