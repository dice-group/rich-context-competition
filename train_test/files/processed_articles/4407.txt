    "abstract": "Abstract\nEmpathic failures are common in hostile intergroup contexts; repairing empathy is therefore a major focus of peacebuilding\nefforts. However, it is unclear which aspect of empathy is most relevant to intergroup conflict. Although trait empathic concern\npredicts prosociality in interpersonal settings, we hypothesized that the best predictor of meaningful intergroup attitudes and\nbehaviors might not be the general capacity for empathy (i.e., trait empathy), but the difference in empathy felt for the in-group\nversus the out-group, or \"parochial empathy.\" Specifically, we predicted that out-group empathy would inhibit intergroup harm\nand promote intergroup helping, whereas in-group empathy would have the opposite effect. In three intergroup contexts--\nAmericans regarding Arabs, Hungarians regarding refugees, Greeks regarding Germans--we found support for this hypothesis.\nIn all samples, in-group and out-group empathy had independent, significant, and opposite effects on intergroup outcomes,\ncontrolling for trait empathic concern.\n",

Bruneau1,2, Mina Cikara3, and Rebecca Saxe2\n Keywords\nemotion, empathy, parochial empathy, intergroup conflict, intergroup empathy\nIn our everyday lives, we count on empathic people to do\naltruistic things. In interpersonal interactions, this assumption\nis supported by studies showing that empathic concern (EC)\nis associated with prosocial behaviors (Batson, 2014; Eisenberg\n& Miller, 1987). For example, observers who experience more\nEC for a needy individual are more likely to engage in costly\nhelping, including volunteering more time, donating more\nmoney, and taking on boring or painful tasks (Batson, Chang,\nOrr, & Rowland, 2002; Batson, Duncan, Ackerman, Buckley,\n& Birch, 1981; Fultz, Batson, Fortenbach, McCarthy, &\nVarney, 1986). A large literature has also demonstrated that dis-\npositional EC is associated with prosocial behavior and inten-\ntions (Eisenberg, Eggum, & Di Giunta, 2010) and also with a\ndecrease in antisocial behaviors, such as bullying (Jolliffe &\nFarrington, 2006; Raskauskas, Gregory, Harvey, Rifshana, &\nSince empathy is involved in providing help and withhold-\ning harm toward others, it has been suggested that empathy\nmay play a vital role in preventing intergroup conflict and facil-\nitating reconciliation (Batson & Ahmad, 2009). Many conflict\nresolution programs have therefore adopted fostering empathy\nas a primary program goal. However, there is reason to believe\nthat boosting overall EC may not provide a universal palliative\nin intergroup settings. In fact, interviews with those who\nengage in (or attempt) extreme intergroup violence indicate that\nthese individuals are characterized not by a lack of empathy but\nrather by high levels of empathy and communal concern for\ntheir in-group (Argo, 2009). Similarly, among Israelis and\nPalestinians, the willingness to endorse out-group harm is asso-\nciated with EC toward their own communities (Ginges &\nAtran, 2009; see also Lickel, Miller, Stenstrom, Denson, &\nSchmader, 2006). Therefore, in some cases, inducing empathy\nmay not only fail to heal intergroup wounds, but it may moti-\nvate out-group hostility. Understanding how different facets of\nempathy influence intergroup conflicts is critical to practical\nconflict resolution and peacebuilding efforts. It is also of great\ntheoretical significance, given the prominent role that empathy\nplays in many models of intergroup relations (e.g., Batson &\nThe opposing predictions about the effect of empathy on\nintergroup conflict can be resolved if we think of empathy not\nonly as an interpersonal process but also as a group-based emo-\ntion--an emotional response that arises because of, or is\n1 Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia,\n2 Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, Cambridge, MA, USA\n3 Department of Psychology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nEmile G.

Group-\nbased emotions can motivate us to act on behalf of our in-\ngroup and/or against hostile out-groups. For example, people\nexperience anger after an in-group insult but only to the extent\nthat they identify with that group (Rydell et al., 2008). Simi-\nlarly, shame and guilt may be felt more strongly by those who\nidentify with or feel attached to their group: Americans feel\nmore shame when considering the poor treatment of Arabs in\nthe United States in the wake of 9/11 (Johns, Schmader, &\nLickel, 2005), and among Americans and Israelis, identifica-\ntion (ID) or attachment to the group, respectively, facilitates\ngroup-based guilt about the poor treatment of minorities in\ntheir society (Doosje, Branscombe, Spears, & Manstead,\nIn the current work, we take an intergroup emotions theory\n(Mackie, Maitner, & Smith, 2009) perspective of empathy and\nsuggest that intergroup empathy has two simultaneous effects:\nIf we feel empathy for individual out-group members, it may\nmotivate action on behalf of that out-group; whereas if we feel\nempathy for individual in-group members, it may motivate\naction against the out-group. What types of behavior might\nintergroup empathy most likely motivate? Whereas moral emo-\ntions like shame and guilt have been associated with concilia-\ntory gestures (e.g., support of negotiations or reparations), and\nnegative emotions like anger have been shown to precipitate\nactive harm, empathy has been most strongly associated with\naltruism. Therefore, we predicted that low out-group empathy\nand high in-group empathy would be most strongly associated\nwith withholding altruistic behavior toward the out-group, or\npreventing others from easing out-group suffering (i.e., \"pas-\nsive harm\"). From this perspective, the people most likely to\nwithhold out-group altruism or engage in passive harm,\nwould not be those low in trait levels of empathy, such as psy-\nchopaths (Baron-Cohen, 2012), but rather those who simulta-\nneously display low out-group empathy and high in-group\nempathy. Thus, by contrast to interpersonal interactions, inter-\ngroup interactions may be best predicted by the parochial dis-\ntribution of empathy toward in-group versus out-group\nmembers, which we term here \"parochial empathy\" (Bruneau,\nCikara, & Saxe, 2015) or \"intergroup empathy bias\" (Cikara,\nThe intergroup emotions perspective on empathy leads to\nthree predictions: First, the amount of empathy felt for out-\ngroup members will correlate with social ID with the out-\ngroup, and the amount of empathy felt for in-group members\nwill correlate with social ID with the in-group. Second,\nintergroup emotions will predict out-group attitudes and beha-\nvior--that is, greater empathy for individual out-group mem-\nbers will predict greater altruism (and less hostility) toward\nthe out-group and vice versa. Because \"in-group love\" can\nbe distinct from \"out-group hate\" (Brewer, 1999), in-group\nand out-group empathy should predict behavior indepen-\ndently of each other. Finally, parochial empathy may be inde-\npendent of interpersonal empathy, predicting altruism and\nantagonism across salient group boundaries, above and\nbeyond trait levels of empathy.\nCurrent Research\nThe goal of the present work is to demonstrate the conse-\nquences of intergroup empathy in a range of real intergroup\ncontexts. Since we predict that in-group empathy and out-\ngroup empathy will have opposite effects on out-group atti-\ntudes and behavior, a parsimonious way to operationalize\nintergroup empathy is by calculating the difference in empa-\nthy felt toward in-group versus out-group members, within\nsubjects. We take this approach in the current work. However,\nsince a single difference score fails to reveal the individual\neffects of each component of empathy, and therefore obscures\ntheir independent contributions, we also examine in-group\nand out-group empathy as independent factors. In Experiment\n1, we tested whether parochial empathy (1) predicted out-\ngroup attitudes and costly altruism over time and (2) mediated\nthe effect of social ID on these outcomes. In Studies 2 and 3,\nwe examined another key question: (3) whether parochial\nempathy predicted out-group attitudes and costly helping\nabove and beyond trait EC.\nExperiment 1: Parochial Empathy\nin Americans Regarding Arabs\nTo examine parochial empathy, we presented American par-\nticipants with fortunes and misfortunes experienced by\nAmericans (in-group) and Arabs (out-group) by adapting a\nparadigm used previously with novel groups (Cikara, Bru-\nGiven that the United States has been involved in continual\nwarfare with at least one Arab-majority country since 2001,\nthese groups are characterized by a hostile relationship. We\nhypothesized that (1) both in-group empathy and out-group\nempathy would independently predict diminished altruistic\n(i.e., costly helping) behavior toward the out-group, and\ngiven that intergroup emotions are fundamentally shaped\nby social identities, that (2) the difference in empathy\nexpressed toward in-group versus out-group members (paro-\nchial empathy) would mediate the effect of social identity on\nout-group behavior.\nMethod\nParticipants\nWe recruited a sample of American participants (N = 100)\nvia Amazon's Mechanical Turk website. Previous studies\nusing a similar paradigm recruited 50\u00ad100 participants\n(Cikara et al., 2014); because the current study focused on\nindividual differences, rather than mean effects, we planned\na priori to recruit at the top end of this scale (N = 100). Data\ncollection was terminated automatically after 100 individuals\ncompleted the study. Of the participants, 16 missed one of\nthe two attention check questions embedded in the survey,\nleaving 84 participants (Mage\nExperimental Design\nProcedure. The procedure was adapted from a paradigm devel-\noped by Cikara, Bruneau, Van Bavel, and Saxe (2014). Briefly,\nafter being provided with a cover story for the research (i.e., to\nexamine \"directional problem-solving\" in people who learned\nlanguages that are written in different directions), English-\nspeaking American participants were told that they would be\nplaying as a member of an English-speaking team in a problem\nsolving challenge, against a team of people who speak Arabic.\nParticipants were told that individual scores would be tallied\nand added to the total team score for both teams and that the\nfirst team to 100 points would win the challenge.\nPrior to the challenge, participants reported where they grew\nup, their background, and an event that happened to them in the\npast week. After being assigned to a team (English speakers)\nand told that they were (apparently randomly) assigned to com-\npete against Arabic speakers, participants were told that they\nwould read the events that people from their team and the other\nteam had reported.\nParticipants then read the events of eight English-speaking\npeople on their team (in-group) and the eight Arabic-\nspeaking people on the other team (out-group). The 16 specific\nevents were adapted from previous work (Cikara et al., 2014)\nand adjusted to be culturally neutral (e.g., \"[target] came down\nwith a serious illness\"). Each event description included the tar-\nget's group membership (e.g., \"Beth is from NORTH\nDAKOTA\" or \"Salma is from EGYPT\") and the target's lan-\nguage (\"English\" or \" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"). Events were randomly\nassigned to either an in-group or an out-group target, such that\neach participant viewed eight in-group events (four positive\nand four negative) and eight out-group events (four positive\nand four negative). For each of the 16 events, participants\nreported how good and how bad it made them feel that the\nevent happened to the target. Not all measures are reported here\n(for full survey, see Supplemental Materials).\nParochial empathy was measured as the degree to which\npeople felt good about in-group versus out-group fortunes and\nbad about in-group versus out-group misfortunes. For the pur-\nposes of the mediation analysis, parochial empathy was calcu-\nlated as in-group empathy minus out-group empathy.\nIntergroup ID was assessed using the Inclusion of In-group\nand Out-group in the Self measure (Schubert & Otten, 2002).\nThe degree of overlap with the in-group using this measure has\nbeen demonstrated previously to reflect in-group ID (Tropp &\nWright, 2001). Participants used their mouse to drag the \"self\"\ncircle closer or further away from the \"group\" circle on screen,\nproviding a continuous measure of self/in-group and self/out-\ngroup ID.\nFollowing the measures above, participants were presented\nwith eight progressive Raven's Matrices (which involve direc-\ntional problem-solving, supporting the cover story).\nOut-group altruism. After finishing the Raven's Matrices, parti-\ncipants were given the opportunity to complete additional prob-\nlems (up to 20), with each correct problem providing a US$.10\ndonation to the \"Arab Red Crescent Society.\" At the bottom of\neach problem were buttons to \"opt out\" and skip to the end of\nthe study or \"continue\" to the next charity problem. The num-\nber of problems completed for charity provided a measure of\ncostly altruism.\nFollow-Up Survey\nOne week later, participants were provided with a link to a\nfollow-up survey, which 68 (81%) completed (and passed the\ncheck question). Those who did and did not complete the\nfollow-up survey did not differ on age, gender, in-group ID,\nout-group ID, in-group empathy, out-group empathy, or the\nnumber of tasks completed for charity (ps > .25).\nThe follow-up survey included exploratory measures that\nparalleled unrelated concurrent cross-cultural research: emo-\ntions toward Arabs associated with stereotype content (envy,\npride, disgust, and pity), prejudice and dehumanization toward\nArabs, and emotional responses to injustices committed against\nArabs. These items are not examined here. Also included in the\nfollow-up survey were outcome measures associated with out-\ngroup helping designed for the current study (support for Arab\nimmigration, donation to out-group members; for full survey,\nsee Supplemental Materials).\nSupport Arab immigration assessed the percentage of U.S.\nVISAS participants thought should be awarded to each of the fol-\nlowing groups: Arabs, East Asians, Hispanics, Africans, and East-\nern Europeans (Kteily, Bruneau, Waytz, & Cotterill, 2015). We\nused as our measure the percent of VISAS granted to Arabs.\nOut-group donation assessed participants' altruistic beha-\nvior by providing them with a monetary bonus to distribute\nbetween an in-group cause (relief fund for victims of the Bos-\nton Marathon bombings) versus an out-group cause (relief fund\nfor civilian victims of drone strikes in Afghanistan and Yemen;\nKteily et al., 2015). The amount of money participants donated\nto the out-group cause provided our measure of out-group pro-\nsocial behavior.\nMediation Test\nTo test for mediation, we constructed three separate models\nusing PROCESS (Hayes, 2013). Each model had the difference\nbetween in-group and out-group ID as the predictor, the differ-\nence between in-group and out-group empathy (i.e., parochial\nempathy) as the mediator and one of the outcome measures as\nthe dependent variable. To test the specificity of mediation, we\nexamined both the predicted mediation relationship (intergroup\nID as independent variable, parochial empathy as mediator) and\nthe reverse (parochial empathy as independent variable, inter-\ngroup ID as mediator), as suggested by Hayes (2013).\nResults\nAs predicted, American participants reported stronger ID with\n936 Social Psychological and Personality Science 8(8)\nd = 2.09. We took as our measure of \"intergroup ID\" the dif-\nference between these social identity measures--this measure\ncorrelated significantly with all outcome measures (rs > .23,\nps < .04). American participants also had stronger empathic\n.18. We calculated parochial empathy as the difference between\nthe empathy measures. Parochial empathy correlated signifi-\ncantly with all outcome measures (rs > .24, ps < .03), and inter-\ngroup ID and parochial empathy were significantly correlated\nThe main analyses of interest examined the ability of paro-\nchial empathy to predict outcomes at Time 1 (immediately after\nthe in-group and out-group empathy judgments) and Time 2\n(1 week after the empathy task), controlling for intergroup\nID. We first tested the specific hypothesis that the constituent\ncomponents of parochial empathy are independently associated\nwith out-group behaviors--that is, that out-group empathy\ndrives prosocial out-group actions, while in-group empathy\ninhibits such actions. We mean centered all predictors and\nentered them simultaneously. As predicted, in-group and out-\ngroup empathy were independent and significant predictors\nof immigration support and donations at Time 2, above and\nbeyond in-group and out-group ID (Table 1). In-group and\nout-group empathy did not predict the Time 1 outcome, beyond\nin-group and out-group ID.\nWe also examined the specific prediction that parochial\nempathy serves as a direct psychological motivator of out-\ngroup behavior through mediation analyses. We found that\nparochial empathy mediated the effect of intergroup ID on all\noutcome measures: Out-group altruism (indirect effect:\nImportantly, the alternate model (i.e., intergroup ID mediating\neffects of parochial empathy on outcomes) was not significant\nfor any of these outcome measures (95% CI of indirect effects\nfor all models included 0).\nTherefore, Experiment 1 supported the prediction that\nparochial empathy is an important predictor of attitudes and\nbehavior in consequential intergroup contexts, mediating the\neffect of social identity on outcomes. Study 2 sought to repli-\ncate and extend these results by examining the predictive valid-\nity of parochial empathy in a different cultural context and\ndirectly comparing the contribution of parochial empathy and\ntrait EC to out-group attitudes and altruism.\nExperiment 2: Parochial Empathy Among\nHungarians During the Refugee Crisis\nExperiment 1 demonstrated that parochial empathy mediates\nthe effect of intergroup ID on out-group-oriented attitudes and\nbehavior. In Experiment 2, we sought to (1) confirm the role of\nparochial empathy in predicting outcomes in an independent\nsample and (2) determine whether parochial empathy predicts\noutcomes beyond trait EC. In Study 2, we examined Hungarian\nempathy toward Hungarians and Muslim refugees during the\nEuropean \"Refugee Crisis.\"\nIn early 2015, the Hungarian government launched a major\nanti-immigration campaign, which included billboards and\nhigh-profile comments by Hungarian leaders citing concern for\nthe welfare of in-group members during the influx of Muslim\nTable 1.

At the same time,\nempathy toward the refugees was fostered by media coverage\nof the wars that drove them from home, and the harrowing\njourney across the Mediterranean, which resulted in thousands\nof drowning deaths. In particular, in September 2015, the\nimage of Aylan Kurdi, a 2-year-old Syrian boy whose drowned\nbody was collected on a beach in Turkey, was transmitted\naround the world, resulting in up to 60-fold increases in dona-\ntions to refugee charities for weeks afterward (Gladstone &\nZraick, 2015). Experiment 2 was conducted 2 months after the\nAylan Kurdi photo was published and 1 month after the peak\nin October 2015; United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-\nugees, 2016). This intergroup context therefore seemed well\nsuited to examine parochial empathy.\nMethod\nParticipants\nWe recruited a sample of 604 Hungarian participants (the largest\nsample we could collect given funding constraints) in late Novem-\nber 2015 through a Hungarian survey company (Kerdoivem); the\nsample was representative of Hungary in terms of age and gen-\nder. Of the participants, 102 missed one of the two attention\ncheck questions embedded in the survey, leaving 502 parti-\ncipants (Mage\nExperimental Design\nParticipants were provided with a survey (in Hungarian), which\nincluded measures of parochial empathy, trait empathy, and\nthree outcome measures, as described below. The survey\nincluded other measures of interest examined elsewhere\n(Bruneau, Kteily, & Laustsen, 2017; for full survey, see\nSupplemental Materials).\nParochial empathy was assessed through eight scenarios\ninvolving individual misfortunes (e.g., \"[Hungarians/Muslim\nrefugees] whose children don't do well in school\"; for full set\nof stimuli, see Supplemental Materials). Each scenario had an\nin-group (Hungarian) target version and an out-group (Muslim\nrefugee) target version. Participants were randomly presented\nwith one set of four misfortunes attributed to the out-group\n( = .90), and then the other set of four misfortunes attributed\nto the in-group ( = .82). For each story, participants indicated\nempathy for the target (\"How much empathy do you feel for\n[target]?\" from 1 \"none at all\" to 5 \"a lot\"). Parochial empathy\nwas assessed as in-group versus out-group empathy.\nTrait EC was measured with the Empathic Concern subscale\nof the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI; Davis, 1983;  = .80).\nAnti-refugee policies support was assessed by providing\nparticipants with four policies that were debated during Eur-\nope's refugee \"crisis\": for example, \"We should dramatically\ndecrease the amount of aid we provide to refugees in order\nto deter them from trying to come to our country\" (reverse\ncoded). Ratings were made using sliders anchored at 0\n(strongly oppose) and 100 (strongly support;  = .84).\nAsylum was assessed by asking how many refugees partici-\npants would be willing to accept into Hungary: \"Of the esti-\nhow many do you think Hungary should grant asylum to,\nallowing them to live there permanently?

Partici-\npants reported whether they wanted their vote counted against\nthe petition (coded -1), for the petition (coded 1), or if they did\nnot want their vote counted (coded 0).\nResults\nHungarian participants reported stronger empathic responses to\nthe misfortunes of in-group Hungarians (M = 3.34, SD = .81)\ncompared to out-group Muslim refugees (M = 3.06,\nEC was correlated positively and quite strongly with both in-\ndictor of empathic responses toward both in-group and out-\ngroup targets. On the other hand, trait EC was significantly less\nstrongly correlated with parochial empathy, r(502) = -.21, p =\nWe next tested how strongly trait empathy and parochial\nempathy correlated with support for outcomes relevant to Mus-\nlim refugees: support for anti-refugee policies, the number of\nMuslim refugees Hungarians thought should be allowed to set-\ntle in Hungary, and willingness to sign a petition in support of\nrefugees. Consistent with the American sample, in-group and\nout-group empathy independently and significantly predicted\neach of the outcome measures, even when controlling for trait\nEC (Table 2).2 Controlling for trait EC, parochial empathy\nstrongly predicted all outcome measures: support for anti-\nrefugee policies ( = .42, p < .001), the number of refugees par-\nticipants felt should be settled in Hungary ( = -.47, p < .001),\nand willingness to sign a petition in support of refugees\n( = -.33, p < .001); results were similar when we controlled\nin the regression analyses for age, gender, and conservatism\nThese results again highlight the importance of parochial\nempathy in intergroup contexts through the independent effects\nof out-group and in-group empathy. Study 2 also illustrated that\nparochial empathy is distinct from trait EC and is a stronger\npredictor of outcomes. In Study 3, we sought to replicate the\nresults of Study 2 in yet another consequential intergroup con-\ntext, with an outcome measure associated with support for pas-\nsive out-group harm.\nExperiment 3: Parochial Empathy Among\nGreeks During the Greek Depression\nTwo years after the global financial crisis that began in 2007,\nGreece experienced what is now known as the \"Greek\n938 Social Psychological and Personality Science 8(8)\nDepression.\" Greek debt ballooned to 30,000 per capita,\nwhich was held mostly in German banks. When Greece\nappealed to the European Union to relieve some of their debt\nas part of a bailout plan, their appeal was largely rejected, par-\nticularly by Germany, and harsh austerity measures were insti-\ntuted with widespread consequences for individual Greeks that\nwere well documented in the media. Claims of predatory lend-\ning by Germany and German hypocrisy were common in\nGreece, and anti-German sentiments were strong. In the wake\nof these sociopolitical decisions, we assessed trait empathy,\nparochial empathy, and anti-German hostility in a large sample\nof Greeks.\nMethod\nParticipants\nWe recruited 545 Greek participants (the largest sample we\ncould collect given funding constraints) to participate in the\nsurvey in late September 2015 through a Greek survey com-\npany (\"The Hellenic Research House\"). Of the participants,\n78 missed an attention check question embedded in the sur-\nvey, resulting in 467 participants (Mage\nExperimental Design\nParticipants were provided with an omnibus survey (in Greek),\nwhich included measures of parochial empathy, trait empathy,\nand the outcome measures.

Results for all\nregression analyses were similar if age, gender, and conser-\nvatism were included as additional regressors. Therefore,\nparochial empathy not only predicted the withholding of pro-\nsocial behavior toward an out-group but also support for pas-\nsive harm.\nGeneral Discussion\nAcross three experiments, we examined parochial empathy and\nits effects on attitudes and behavior toward threatening out-\ngroups. In the context of American/Arab relations (Study 1),\nin-group and out-group empathy each independently and sig-\nnificantly predicted long-term attitudes and behavior toward\nArabs and mediated the effect of intergroup ID on these out-\ncomes. In the context of Hungarian/refugees (Study 2) and\nGreek/German relations (Study 3), in-group and out-group\nempathy significantly and oppositely predicted altruistic\nTable 2.

More importantly, across all three cultural con-\ntexts, parochial empathy was a stronger predictor of altruism\nand passive harm toward out-groups than was trait empathy.\nIndeed, the current research indicates that trait EC is a poor\npredictor of out-group altruism and out-group passive harm.\nRather, the research reported here supports an alternative empa-\nthy profile for those who withhold aid and advocate passive\nharm to the out-group: Low enough empathy for the out-\ngroup that withholding help or condoning harm is emotionally\nacceptable, and simultaneously high enough empathy for in-\ngroup members that they are sufficiently motivated to withhold\nhelp or condone harm on their behalf.\nEmpathy is one of a number of emotions that are shaped by\nsocial identities. For example, moral emotions, such as guilt and\nshame in response to in-group transgressions, have been shown\nto drive intergroup forgiveness and foster reconciliation, and\npositive emotions (e.g., hope) have been shown to similarly ease\nintergroup aggression (Cohen-Chen, Halperin, Crisp, & Gross,\n2013). On the other hand, negative emotions such as anger and\nhatred drive conflict and prevent reconciliation (in some circum-\nstances; e.g., Halperin, 2008). Obviously, the internal forces that\nultimately pull someone toward and away from intergroup con-\nflict are numerous, and mapping the unique contributions of\neach of these forces will be an important undertaking.\nOne avenue for future research will be to determine which\nintergroup outcomes are best predicted by each intergroup\nemotion. Here, we focused on outcomes that we hypothesized\nwould be most directly affected by intergroup empathy: inter-\ngroup altruism and passive harm. On the other hand, previous\nresearch has shown that the approach motivated emotion of\nanger effectively drives support for (or engagement in) more\nactive intergroup harm (Lickel et al., 2006; Spanovic, Lickel,\nDenson, & Petrovic, 2010). Future studies could test whether\nincreasing moral emotions like shame may foster more indirect,\nsymbolic gestures to the aggrieved out-group, such as a formal\napology or an offer of reparations, whereas decreasing paro-\nchial empathy may be more likely to foster prosocial interper-\nsonal gestures, such as helping an out-group target. At the same\ntime, future work could also examine how intergroup emotions\ninteract with each other to drive conflict. For example, it would\nbe interesting to determine the potential relationship between\nin-group empathy, intergroup anger, and active harm of the\nout-group. This approach could connect the work on parochial\nempathy, examined here, with related research on \"empathic\nFinally, it is important to note some limitations of the cur-\nrent research. Although we replicated the main effects across\na range of cultural contexts, the empathy measures were based\non self-report and therefore subject to demand characteristics.\nFuture performance-based or neuroimaging measures could\nbe used to circumvent this issue. Additionally, the measures\nused in the current research were constrained to one facet of\nintergroup empathy (i.e., EC). Future research should also\nexamine different forms of intergroup empathy. For example,\npersonal distress (the amount of anxiety or distress one feels\nin the presence of others' suffering) is another type of empathy\nthat could be examined in the intergroup contexts. Personal dis-\ntress has generally been found to be associated with avoidance\nrather than helping when avoidance is an option (Batson, Fultz,\n& Schoenrade, 1987). However, if the distressing situation can-\nnot be avoided, personal distress has been shown to predict\naltruism even better than EC (Batson et al., 1981). It would\ntherefore be interesting to determine the degree to which inter-\ngroup empathy as personal distress motivates behavior in the\ncontext of intergroup conflict, particularly in protracted con-\nflicts that that may feel inescapable.\nConclusion\nAcross three distinct intergroup contexts, we show here that the\ndistribution of empathy between in-group and out-group mem-\nbers (i.e., parochial empathy) mediates the effect of \"parochial\nidentification\" on outcome measures and predicts outcomes\nindependent of (and better than) trait EC. A major implication\nof this work is that conflict resolution interventions or pro-\ngrams aimed at increasing overall empathy in members of par-\ntisan groups, for example by taking others' perspectives while\nTable 3.

Future work should therefore\ndetermine which interventions affect parochial empathy, sepa-\nrately from trait EC.\n"
