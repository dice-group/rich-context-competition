But life expectancy and the years\nof life lost have not been reported.\nObjectives: To quantify mortality, examine how it varies with age, sex, and other risk factors,\nand determine how life expectancy is affected.\nMethods: We constructed mortality models using the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey, adjusting for age, sex, race, and major medical conditions. We used these\nto compute life expectancy and the years of life lost.\nMeasurements and main results: Pulmonary function testing classified patients as having\nGlobal Initiative on Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 COPD or restriction.\nCOPD is associated with only a modest reduction in life expectancy for never smokers, but\nwith a very large reduction for current and former smokers. At age 65, the reductions in male\nlife expectancy for stage 1, stage 2, and stages 3 or 4 disease in current smokers are 0.3 years,\n2.2 years, and 5.8 years. These are in addition to the 3.5 years lost due to smoking. In former\nsmokers the reductions are 1.4 years and 5.6 years for stage 2 and stages 3 or 4 disease, and in\nnever smokers they are 0.7 and 1.3 years.\nConclusions: Persons with COPD have an increased risk of mortality compared to those who\ndo not, with consequent reduction in life expectancy. The effect is most marked in current\nsmokers, and this is further reason for smokers to quit.\nKeywords: survival, mortality, longevity, COPD\nIntroduction\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease where\nairways in the lungs are damaged. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the\nUnited States and around the world.1\u00ad8 In the United States, COPD was responsible\nbeen increasing since 1990.9 Prevalence estimates in the United States range from 10\nto 16 million adults, but the condition may be under-diagnosed.10,11 The overall attribut-\nable morbidity and mortality from COPD may, therefore, be underestimated.\nRisk factors for COPD include genetic factors and environmental exposures. The\nmajor exposures are tobacco smoke, occupational dusts and chemicals, and pollution.12\nIn industrialized nations, tobacco smoke is the biggest risk factor, where up to 50%\nof long-term smokers will develop COPD,13 while in less industrialized nations it is\nexposure to air pollution.14 Conversely, of persons with COPD in the western world,\nroughly 50% have smoking as the underlying etiology.13 Symptoms generally emerge\nafter age 40, but can manifest earlier.\nMannino and colleagues4 analyzed data from the First National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES I), using a modified version of the Global Initiative\nShavelle et al\nfor Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria for\nCOPD and other respiratory disease in that population. The\nauthors reported all-cause mortality relative risks (RRs)\nfor COPD based on multivariable models that controlled\nfor smoking status, pack-year history, years since last\nregularly smoked, body mass index (BMI), and a number of\ndemographic variables. The RRs ranged from 1.2 for mild\nCOPD to 1.7 for severe. Some other studies also reported\nno studies have reported life expectancies in COPD, or the\nyears of life lost.\nOur primary goal was to compute life expectancy and the\nyears of life lost due to COPD. To do so we required quantifi-\ncation of the excess mortality associated with COPD. We thus\nsought to calculate the associated excess death rates (EDRs)\nand RRs, and to investigate whether these varied by age, sex,\nrace, education, smoking status, the presence of concomitant\nmedical conditions, and time since evaluation. We were\nparticularly interested in how the RRs varied with age, as we\nhave found in other chronic conditions that it declines with\nage.17,18 Using the aforementioned results, we then computed\nlife expectancies for the various groups, in order to determine\nthe years of life lost due to COPD. As noted, these quantities\nhave not been reported in the literature.\nMethods\nStudy population\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nCenter for Health Statistics on a nationwide probability\nsample of 33,994 persons aged two months and older through\ninterviews and direct physical examinations.19,20 To focus on\nthe effects of COPD in an older population, we restricted\nattention to the 6,261 adults over age 50 who had a reliable\nor reproducible pulmonary test and smoking history (except\nas noted below). Of these persons, 3,555 were smokers or\nformer smokers and 3,362 had pack-year history. Pipe or\ncigar smokers were counted as current or former smokers\nas appropriate, but we did not have pack year history on\nthese persons.\nMeasurements\nExaminers used either a dry rolling seal spirometer in the\nmobile examination center or a portable spirometer in the\nhome examination to conduct pulmonary function testing.\nTesting procedures were based on the 1987 American\nThoracic Society recommendation.21 Subjects performed 5\nto 8 forced expirations in order to obtain acceptable protocol\ncurves. Predicted forced expiratory volume in one second\n) was calculated using previously published prediction\nequations from the NHANES III data, stratified by sex, age,\nand race.22\u00ad25 Persons were considered as having COPD only\nif confirmed by pulmonary function testing. Otherwise they\nwere assumed to have no lung disease (Normal) or GOLD\nstage 0 if they reported respiratory symptoms. The severity\nscale for COPD used by Mannino and colleagues4 and in the\npresent study is shown in Figure 1.\nStatistical analysis\nAnalyses were performed using the statistical package SAS\n9.1 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).26 Kaplan\u00adMeier\nsurvival curves were produced for various groups.27 Cox\nproportional hazards regression models were developed\nusing the \"PROC PHREG\" procedure in SAS. These models\nprovide hazard ratios (or, equivalently, RRs) for each\npotential mortality risk factor. The variables included in one\nor more of the multivariable regression models were: Age,\nsex, race, smoking status, pack-years of cigarette smoking,\nBMI, major medical conditions, and lung function (COPD)\ncategory. The models were used to compute mortality rates\nfor various groups, including 65 year-old males with the\ngiven severities of COPD. The difference between a given\nrate and the corresponding general population (or other\nbaseline) mortality rate is the EDR, which were computed\nfor the various groups.\nLife expectancies were computed for the same groups by\nusing the above mortality rates to construct a life table.28\u00ad30\nA remaining issue was the imputation of some mortality\nrates. When the EDR was positive (increased risk compared\nwith the general population), the assumption of proportional\nlife expectancy (PLE)18,29 was used to obtain the mortality\nrates at older ages. In brief, this method assumes that the\nproportion of normal life expectancy for a given medical\ncondition is the same at every age.18,29 For example, if the\nlife expectancy in mild COPD is 90% of normal at age 50,\nthen under PLE it would be 90% of normal at age 70 as well.\nWhen the EDR was negative, it was assumed to approach\nzero with age, much as persons in above-average health\nrevert to the mean.\nResults\nThe mean duration of follow-up of the 6,261 persons studied\nwas 7.9 years (with standard deviation 2.8 years), and there\nwere 1,873 deaths. Table 1 shows the baseline demographic\ncharacteristics of the cohort. Overall, the percentages of\npersons with spirometric evidence of COPD were: GOLD\nLife expectancy in COPD\nand restriction: 8%.\nFigures 2\u00ad5 show the Kaplan\u00adMeier survival curves\nbased on severity of COPD, both for the entire population and\nstratified by smoking status. In all cases, any lung function\nimpairment was associated with an increased risk of death.\nThese curves were used to compute the (crude) EDRs\nassociated with COPD that are shown in Table 2. For\nexample, amongst smokers, the 10-year survival probability\npersons with no lung disease was 75%, compared with 65%\nfor persons with COPD symptoms, 63% for stage 1, 58%\nfor stage 2, and approximately 15% for stage 3 or 4. The\nassociated annual mortality rate over the 10-year period for\nperiod for smokers with stage 1 COPD, compared with\nin Table 2. It is important to note that these are crude EDRs,\nunadjusted for any possible confounding factors.\nThe EDRs implicit in the \"All\" group in Figure 2 of\nMannino and colleagues4 are roughly one-third lower than\nthose reported in Table 2 here. The reason is that the EDR\nincreases with age, and the Mannino and colleagues study\npopulation was significantly younger than the population\nused here: unlike the present study, half their population was\nunder age 50 at the start of follow-up.\nAdditional analyses (not shown) indicated that persons\nwith COPD, compared to those without lung disease, tended\nto be older and male, and of course were much more likely\nto be smokers. It is important to note that the survival curves\nin Figures 2\u00ad5 were not adjusted for any of the covari-\nates. Thus, the EDRs given in Table 2 may be confounded\nwith the effects of these covariates. We wished to obtain\nan unconfounded (or pure) estimate of the EDRs or RRs\nassociated with COPD. For this we required multivariate\nClassification\nStage 0 (Symptoms Only)\nFEV\nFEV\nWith or without chronic symptoms\nFEV\nWith or without chronic symptoms\nFEV\nWith or without chronic symptoms\nRestrictive lung disease (RLD)\nStage 1 (Mild)\nStage 2 (Moderate)\nFEV\nStage\nNormal spirometry\nPresence of respiratory symptoms\nStage 3 or 4 (Severe)\nFigure 1 Seventy scale for COPD.\nNotes: Those who were diagnosed by a physician as having chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or asthma but did not have COPD or RLD according to the above criteria were\nclassified as GOLD stage 0 (if they reported symptoms) or Normal (if they reported no symptoms). Persons who had a positive response to (a) having a cough for three\nconsecutive months out of the year, (b) phlegm first-thing in the morning three consecutive months out of the year, or (c) wheezing in the past 12 months, were considered\nas having GOLD stage 0 if their pulmonary function testing did not indicate COPD or RLD.\nAbbreviations:COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;GOLD,Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease;FEV\n,forced expiratory volume in one second;\nFVC, forced vital capacity; RLD, restrictive lung disease.\nShavelle et al\nTable 1 Demographics and description of key variables.All figures are column percentages except for counts (n, died) and age\nAll Current smoker Former smoker Never smoker\nAge (mean \u00b1 SD)\nCOPD\nSmoking status\nPack-years\nBMI\nMedical conditions (% yes)\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; CHF, congestive heart failure; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; MI, myocardial infarction; RID, restrictive lung disease.\nstatistical methods, such as the Cox proportional hazards\nregression model.\nCox models were used to adjust for age, sex, race,\neducation, smoking status, smoking history, weight, and major\nmedical conditions. The variables, their various levels, and the\nassociated relative risks of mortality are shown in Table 3.\nAs expected, the relative risks associated with COPD\nincreased with increasing severity of COPD. In all cases the\nrelative ordering of severity was preserved in the resulting\nRRs. However, as can be seen, the stage 1 group had a relative\nrisk that, in 3 of the 4 cases, was actually less than that of the\nreference group (stage 0), though the differences were neither\npractically nor statistically significant. We return to this issue\nin the discussion. Those with restrictive lung disease (RLD)\nor symptoms of COPD, but no formal diagnosis, both had\nuniformly increased risk of death compared with those with\nno lung disease.\nOther analyses (not shown), using models that (a)\naccounted for only age, sex, and COPD, and (b) were based\non different subsets of data, yielded similar results. Separate\nLife expectancy in COPD\nanalysis of pipe and cigar smokers (not shown) revealed that\ntheir mortality risk was similar to that of smokers (RR = 1.0),\nand higher than that of former smokers (RR = 1.1).\nFurther analyses (not shown) revealed that the effect\nof COPD did not appear to vary by sex, race, or college\neducation. That is, there were no significant interactions. But it\ndid vary by age, as we hypothesized, with older persons having\na lower RR than younger persons (results not shown). This\nwas true for those with stage 2 and 3 or 4 COPD, and amongst\ncurrent, former, and never smokers, with one exception (it did\nnot hold for the former smokers with moderate COPD). We\ncomment further on this issue in the discussion.\nThe last row of Table 3 shows the mortality rate for the\ncomposite baseline group: female, age 50\u00ad59, non-Caucasian,\nNormal\nGOLD Stage 0\nGOLD Stage 1\nRLD\nGOLD Stage 2\nFollow-up time (years)\nSurvival percentage\nFigure 2 Kaplan\u00adMeier survival curves of all 6,261 participants age 50 and over in NHANES III, stratified by lung function impairment.\nFigure 3 Kaplan\u00adMeier survival curves of 1,294 current smokers age 50 and over in NHANES III, stratified by lung function impairment.\nNormal\nGOLD Stage 0\nGOLD Stage 1\nRLD\nGOLD Stage 2\nFollow-up time (years)\nSurvival percentage\nShavelle et al\ncollege education, no lung disease, never smoker (first model\nonly), low pack-years of smoking (models 1\u00ad3 only), normal\nweight, and no other medical conditions. As can be seen,\neven \"healthy\" current smokers, with low pack-years, have\na baseline mortality rate that is much higher than the never\nthe corresponding annual mortality rates at age 55 for the\nUnited States female general population28 and the insured\nrespectively. That is, the best group contemplated by the\nmodels is slightly better than the general population, but does\nnot have mortality as low as the recently insured (who have\nadditionally demonstrated normal blood work, urinalysis,\nand electrocardiogram).\nThe RRs from Table 3 can also be used to compute the\nmortality rate for any combination of levels of the covariates\nNormal\nGOLD Stage 0\nGOLD Stage 1\nRLD\nGOLD Stage 2\nFollow-up time (years)\nSurvival percentage\nFigure 4 Kaplan\u00adMeier survival curves of 2,261 former smokers age 50 and over in NHANES III, stratified by lung function impairment.\nNormal\nGOLD Stage 0\nGOLD Stage 1\nRLD\nGOLD Stage 2\nFollow-up time (years)\nSurvival percentage\nFigure 5 Kaplan\u00adMeier survival curves of 2,706 never smokers age 50 and over in NHANES III, stratified by lung function impairment.\nLife expectancy in COPD\nin the model. For example, using the \"All\" group, the\nmortality rate for a 75 year-old male, Caucasian, no college\neducation, no lung disease, smoker, medium pack-years,\nWe used the model of Table 3 to compute mortality rates\nfor various groups of 65-year-old Caucasian males with col-\nlege education, normal weight, and no medical conditions\n(for the smoking groups we assumed low pack-years, and\nfor the \"all\" group we assumed \"never smoker\"). These rates\nare shown in Table 4.\nWe computed the EDRs implicit in Table 4 by subtracting\nfrom each the US male general population mortality rate at\nAs can be seen, these are smaller than the EDRs of Table 2\nfor the \"all\", former, and never groups, and higher for some\nof the smoking groups. Otherwise, there is no clear pattern.\nThat the EDRs would differ between the tables is under-\nstandable, as the former are crude (or possibly confounded)\nwhile the latter are at least partially adjusted for the factors\nin the models of Table 3 (that is, computed after controlling\nfor the factors in the models, including having no medical\nconditions).\nImplicit in Table 5 is the observation that the EDRs\nfor COPD are higher for smokers than for nonsmokers or\nnever smokers. For example, within current smokers, the\nEDR for stage 3 or 4 COPD compared with mild COPD is\n\"super-additivity\", where the risk associated with two factors\n(here, smoking and COPD) is greater than the sum of the\nseparate risks associated with these factors. Super-additivity\nis also seen, for example, with respect to smoking and dia-\nbetes. We return to this issue in the discussion.\nWe next used the rates of Table 4 to compute life\nexpectancies for the 24 (male) groups. The indicated rates\nTable 2 Excess deaths rates from Figures 2\u00ad5,relative to persons\nwith no lung disease\nGroup Smoking status\nAll Current Former Never\nNormal Reference Group\nTable 3 Relative risks from multivariable Cox proportional hazards\nregressions models\nVariablea Smoking status\nAll persons Current Former Never\nAge\nCOPD\nSmoking status\nPack-years history\nBMI\nMedical conditions\nNotes: aThe respective reference groups for these relative risks are persons who are:\nfemale, non-Caucasian, college education, aged 50\u00ad59, no lung disease, never smoker\n(for the first model), low pack-years (for the first three models), normal weight, and\nwithout any of the specified medical conditions. bThis the mortality rate for persons\nin the reference group described immediately above.

Because we found that the RR decreases\nwith age (and the EDR increases with age), an assumption\nof constant EDR or constant RR with age was not war-\nranted. Of course we could have used the model of Table 3\nShavelle et al\nto compute mortality rates at all ages. Yet, as just noted, the\nRR decreases with age. Thus, using model-based rates at all\nages would overestimate mortality and, thus, underestimate\nlife expectancy. We opted to take a middle position: the use\nof proportional life expectancy (PLE).18,29 It can be shown\nthat this method has implications for the EDR at every\nage,18,29 upon which it follows that our approach here could\nrely equally on the rates of Table 4 or the EDRs of Table 5.\nFor females, the corresponding mortality rates are shown in\nTable 6, and the EDRs in Table 7.\nLife expectancies based on the rates of Tables 4 and 5\nare given in Table 8. As can be seen, the best group \u00ad never\nsmokers with no significant lung disease and no medical\nconditions \u00ad have a life expectancy of 17.8 additional years.\nNot surprisingly, this is higher than the corresponding figure\nin the United States general population (16.8 years). By\ncontrast, current smokers with no lung disease have a life\nto the finding of Doll and colleagues.32 As expected, the\npresence of COPD further decreases the life expectancy.\nCurrentsmokerswithstage1COPDhavealifeexpectancy\nof 14.0 years, or 0.3 years lower. Smokers with stage 2 COPD\nhave a life expectancy of 12.1 years, or 2.2 years lower.\nThose with stage 3 or 4 COPD have a life expectancy of\n8.5 years, or 5.8 years lower. Former smokers lose 0.5 years\nfor smoking, 1.4 additional years for stage 2 COPD and\n5.6 additional years for stage 3 or 4 COPD, compared with\notherwise similar persons who do not have lung disease.\nBy contrast, never smokers lose only 0.7 years for stage 2\nCOPD and 1.3 years for stages 3 or 4 COPD. The two cases\nwith an increase in life expectancy for COPD compared\nwith no lung disease (stage 1 COPD in former and never\nsmokers) are undoubtedly both due to the comparatively\nlarge standard errors (not shown) in the respective stage 1\nparameter estimates of Table 3. The standard errors are much\nsmaller for the other parameters. In sum, the years of life\nlost due to stages 2, 3, or 4 COPD is significant in current\nand former smokers, and modest in nonsmokers and those\nwith stage 1 COPD.\nTable 9 shows the corresponding values for females (using\nthe mortality rates in Table 6 or the EDRs in Table 7). As\nwith males, the reductions in life expectancy are significant\nfor both smokers and those with stage 2, 3, or 4 COPD. For\nexample, never smokers with stage 3 or 4 COPD lose 1.9 years\nof life, while smokers with stage 3 or 4 COPD lose 9.0 years,\nor 44% of the 20.3 years that obtains for a never smoker with\nno lung disease. The life expectancies in Tables 8 and 9 are\nshown graphically in Figures 6 and 7.\nTable 4 Mortality rates for otherwise healthy 65-year-old\nCaucasian males based on the models of Table 3\nGroup Smoking status\nAll Current Former Never\nTable 5 Excess death rates for otherwise healthy 65-year-old\nCaucasian males, computed as Table 4 less the mortality rates for\nGroup Smoking status\nAll Current Former Never\nTable 6 Mortality rates for otherwise healthy 65-year-old\nCaucasian females based on the models of Table 3\nGroup Smoking status\nAll Current Former Never\nTable 7 Excess death rates for otherwise healthy 65-year-old\nCaucasian females, computed as Table 6 less the mortality rates\nGroup Smoking status\nAll Current Former Never\nLife expectancy in COPD\nAs noted, the models of Table 3 can be used to compute\nmortalityrates,andthuslifeexpectancies,foranycombinations\nof the covariates. We could thus construct tables similar\ndiabetes.\nDiscussion\nAlthough the number of persons with COPD seems unusu-\nally high compared to other published reports (31% vs\n15%),12 our population was comparatively older, and oth-\ners have noted that COPD is generally underdiagnosed in\nthe general population.10\u00ad11 Persons who exhibit no signs\nor symptoms of abnormal lung function are unlikely to be\ntested by spirometry, and thus are unlikely to be diagnosed\nwith COPD. Another possible reason for the high number\nof persons with COPD could be related to the fact that\npersons who are older will naturally have a lower lung\nfunction compared to their younger counterparts. While\nHankinson and colleagues22 attempted to account for this\nin their regression model for adults, it is possible that a\nsingle equation for all adults may not properly estimate the\npredicted FEV\nand forced vital capacity (FVC) at older\nages. Thus, persons who actually might have normal lung\nfunction for their age might incorrectly be placed into the\ncategory of mild COPD. The effect of this is to dilute the\nrelative risks for older persons with mild COPD, and in fact\nmay account for the nonsignificant relative risk for mild\nCOPD that we found.\nMannino and colleagues4 reported a relative risk of 1.2\nfor mild COPD. This was higher than the RRs we found\n(which were very close to 1.0). Their data (NHANES I)\nspanned 30 years of follow-up, while ours (NHANES III)\nspanned only 12. Perhaps, in the intervening 18 years, persons\nwith mild COPD went on to develop more serious COPD.\nHoogendern and colleagues33 studied the issue of COPD\nprogression. They reported annual transition rates from mild\nformer smokers, and current smokers, respectively. For\nmoderate to severe COPD the rates were 3.0%, 3.4%, and\n3.7%, respectively. Over a 12-year period, therefore, at least\ntherefore be subject to an increased relative risk.\nThe excess risk in COPD increases with the severity of\nCOPD. These findings have been replicated across several\ndatabases, and by many research groups. We comment here\non four such studies.\n1. Lee and colleagues,15 in analyzing the Health and\nRetirement Survey data, reported an odds ratio of 2.3 for\npersons with lung disease even after adjusting for age,\nsex, co-morbidities, and functional measures (bathing,\nmanaging finances, etc). Our values are mostly lower,\nlikely due to our study population being older (see\ndiscussion below about the effect of advancing age).\n2. Ekberg-Aronsson and colleagues2 reported relative risks\nby gender and smoking status. They found relative risks\nof 2.4 and 3.6 for male smokers in the GOLD stage 3 or\nNormal Stage 0\nsymptoms\nonly\nRestrictive\nlung disease\nYears\nCurrent smoker Former smoker Never smoker\nFigure 6 Male life expectancy at age 65, stratified by smoking status and severity of COPD (See Table 8).\nShavelle et al\n4 categories but who otherwise had no other co-morbidity.\nThese RRs are higher than those we reported, but this is\nprimarily due to the lower baseline mortality rate in their\nstudy. When we restricted attention to similar groups, we\nfound similar results (not shown).\n3. Celli and colleagues16 used a different measure of COPD,\nthe BODE index, which is a \"multidimensional grading\nsystem that assessed the respiratory, perceptive, and\nsystemic aspects of COPD that would better categorize\nthe illness and predict the outcome than does the FEV\nalone.\" The index includes consideration of BMI, airflow\nobstruction (based on predicted FEV\n), dyspnea, and\nexercise capacity to determine classification of severity\nin COPD. The authors found a 32% increased risk of\ndeath for each point increase in the index.\n4. Singer7 compared the results of Celli and colleagues16\nto three older studies. Dividing the BODE index into\n8.29. He concluded that while FEV\nmight be the strongest\npredictorofmortality,theotherthreefactors(BMI,severity\nof dyspnea, and exercise capacity) were sufficiently able to\nrefine the levels of excess mortality. He also concluded that\nthe BODE index may be a useful predictor in determining\nthe statistical likelihood of survival in populations that\nhave all four of the index measures. He noted, however,\nthat in most cases the severity of dyspnea and exercise\ncapacity are not available.\nIt is well known that COPD reduces life expectancy. As\nwas documented here, the reduction is significant for those\nwith severe disease (GOLD State 3 or 4) and for smokers.\nThe new findings reported here are the relative risks of\nTable 3, the mortality and excess death rates of Tables 4\u00ad7,\nand the life expectancies of Tables 8 and 9. The latter were\nused to document the years of life lost due to COPD and/or\nsmoking. We also found (1) that the relative risk appears to\ndecrease with age, and (2) the presence of super-additivity.\nWe now comment on these latter two issues.\nAs is well known, once the schedule of age-specific\nmortality rates is known, a life table can be constructed and\nthe life expectancy determined.29,30 It might seem reasonable,\nthen, to use the model shown in Table 3 to calculate mortality\nrates for any combination of factors, especially for persons\nwith COPD. To do so would overlook two issues, however.\nFirst, the RRs of Table 3 apply to all combinations of\nthe risk factors, and do not appear to vary significantly by\nsex, race, education, and so on. But, as we have shown,\nthey do vary by age. Thus, the relative risks reported in the\nTable are truly average RRs over the age-span. It might be\nNormal Stage 0\nsymptoms\nonly\nRestrictive\nlung disease\nYears\nCurrent smoker Former smoker Never smoker\nFigure 7 Female life expectancy at age 65, stratified by smoking status and severity of COPD (See Table 9).\nTable 8 Life expectancies for otherwise healthy 65-year-old\nCaucasian males, based on the rates in Tables 4 and 5. See also\nGroup Smoking status\nAll Current Former Never\nLife expectancy in COPD\nreasonable, therefore, to assume that the relative risk applies\nat the average follow-up age (68 + 12/2), with possibly an\nadditional offset to account for the variability.34,35\nSecond, one must specify the severity of COPD. As we\nhave noted above, this cannot be assumed to remain static\nover the lifetime. A plausible simplifying assumption might\nbe to assume that the EDR for the given severity applies at\nthe initial age, and that this EDR increases in some fashion\nThe results shown in Tables 3, 5, and 7 confirm that the\neffect of COPD is super-additive with respect to smoking.\nThat is, the extra risk due to COPD is higher in smokers than\nin nonsmokers. The effect is also super-additive with respect\nto age, as the EDR (but not RR) increases with age.\nLife insurance underwriters implicitly assume super-\nadditivity whenever they apply the same RR (or rating) to a\nsmoker that they would to a nonsmoker. With a higher baseline\nmortalityrateforsmokers,theresultingEDRfortheconditionto\nbe rated will be larger than the EDR for nonsmokers. If it is true\nthat smoking increases the mortality effect of every risk factor\n(such as COPD), then this assumption appears reasonable.\nIt is important to note that a multiplicative model such as\nthe Cox proportional hazards regression model is predicated\nupon super-additivity (actually, it assumes that the hazards\nare multiplicative, rather than additive). Further discussion is\nbeyond the scope of the present article, but we hope to soon\nreport on this issue in more detail.\nAs we have seen, COPD is associated with increased\nmortality and, thus, with reduced life expectancy. Those with\nstage 1 or 2 COPD lose at most a few years of life expectancy\nat age 65 compared with persons with no lung disease, in\naddition to any years lost due to smoking. But current smokers\nwith stage 3 or 4 COPD lose about six years of life expectancy,\nin addition to the almost four years lost due to smoking.\nDisclosure\nThe authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.\nReferences\n1. de Torres JP, Campo A, Casanova C, Aguirre-Jaime, Zulueta J.
