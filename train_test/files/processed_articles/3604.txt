Patients with recent discharges from hos-\npital or those receiving provider referral typically qualify for\nhome health care.1,2 In many ways, home discharges should\nbe reflective of the patient's or family's involvement in the\ndischarge plan and capable of providing less expensive and\nmore convenient alternative to facility-based postacute care.\nSeveral scholars have examined the value of home dis-\ncharges with respect to different aspects of postacute care.\nThese scholars have found disparate findings. For example,\ndischarges to home health care were determined to be less\nexpensive compared with inpatient rehabilitation facility or\nskilled nursing facility among Medicare beneficiaries.3,4 A\nstudy of outcomes among home-based care patients showed\nthat both clinical outcomes and quality of life improved at\nthe end of the follow-up period with quality of life levels\nbeing comparable to national averages.5 Experience of care\nis an important aspect of care quality and has to be assessed\nat all care settings. In an examination of patient satisfaction\nwith home health care, Leff et al6 found patients receiving\ncare at home had high levels of satisfaction with better scores\nin most domains used for comparisons with a comparable\nhospital cohort. Cost savings have also been reported to ema-\nnate from the use of home health care. Shapiro et al7 reported\nsignificant Medicaid cost savings that were made in home\nhealth care vis-\u00e0-vis nursing home costs.\nThe growing value placed on home discharges as the\nfuture for quality improvement and cost savings in\n1Western Kentucky University, Bowling Green, USA\n2Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA\n3University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA\n4Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nWilliam N.

For this rea-\nson, a better understanding of factors leading to home dis-\ncharges will benefit health care providers and policy makers\nin supporting efforts for implementation of delivery mecha-\nnisms with the greatest potential for increasing home dis-\ncharges. In this study, we examined factors associated with\nthe likelihood of home discharges among Medicaid benefi-\nciaries receiving services from primary care plans in a geo-\ngraphically dispersed sample that represents 3 of the 4\ngeographic regions of the United States.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nWe conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of\nMedicaid beneficiaries who were hospitalized in 4 states\nlocated in each of the West, South, and Midwest regions of\nthe United States. In our analyses, de-identified Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicaid Analytic\neXtract (MAX) data system containing information for these\npatients was used to examine discharge destinations. MAX\ndata contain detailed clinical and nonclinical information on\nbeneficiaries including patient status on discharge in any\ngiven year of service.\nPatients in the Sample\nThe data used in our analysis consisted of Medicaid enrollees\nwho received primary care services in the states of California,\nGeorgia, Michigan, and Mississippi in 2009. Overall, there\nincluded in the analyses. These patients were either dis-\ncharged to their own homes (n = 13948) or to other hospitals\nand other facilities, including skilled nursing facilities for\nfurther treatment (n = 19212). We excluded from the analy-\nsis patients who left the hospital against medical advice,\npatients who died during hospitalization, and patients who\nwere referred to palliative care. Patients in the final sample\nwere examined to determine the total cost of hospitalization\nprior to discharge. Total cost of hospitalization for each dis-\ncharge destination from a defined cohort of patients could set\nthe basis for future evaluation of patterns of care and final\ncost of care when all discharge alternatives are compared.\nVariables and Definitions\nWe examined patients according to the type of discharge des-\ntination. In this way, in our analyses, the primary dependent\nvariable was classified as patients with home-based dis-\ncharges (ie, those who received the needed posthospitaliza-\ntion care at home) and those with facility-based discharges\n(ie, those who received the needed posthospitalization care at\nother established facilities) in the year of study. In\nour sample, patients who needed facility-based care after\nhospitalization were those who were (1) discharged and\nreferred for outpatient care, (2) discharged to nursing facili-\nties, and (3) discharged to intermediate care facilities.\nIndependent variables represented clinical and demographic\ncharacteristics among the patients. Demographic variables\nincluded gender, race, location, and age, while clinical vari-\nables included length of stay (LOS, in days, and as a proxy\nfor cost of care in the regression model), procedure (whether\nor not the patient had procedure on admission), and primary\ndiagnosis involving ambulatory care-sensitive condition\n(ACSC) upon admission. By definition, ACSC are condi-\ntions that lead to a hospital admission of which the onset\ncould have been prevented through a more easily accessible\nambulatory sector or one that provides better quality of care\nat primary care level.8-10 This variable was treated as a\ndichotomous variable, measuring the occurrence of ACSC-\nrelated hospitalization in the target population. The\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,\nClinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) was used to assess\nACSC. Last, Medicare/Medicaid dual eligibility status was\nincluded in the study to examine its impact on discharge\ndestination.\nStatistical Analysis\nTo examine the likelihood of home discharges, we first con-\nduct univariate analysis of discharges and other factors to\nestablish their distribution in the sample of the hospitalized\npatients. Bivariate associations are also examined and\nreported between the dependent variable and relevant inde-\npendent variables as well as among independent variables.\nThen, we examine total cost of hospitalization prior to dis-\ncharge to determine how cost was distributed based on dis-\ncharge destination. We use multiple logistic regression to\nassess the likelihood of home discharges in the Medicaid\npopulation. This model is used to identify independent fac-\ntors associated with home discharges.\nResults\nTable 1 presents distribution of the patients' demographic\nand clinical characteristics as identified by discharge desti-\nnation. Women made about two-thirds of discharges in each\ncategory of discharge destination. The data showed patients\nwho were discharged to their homes were, on the average,\nyounger than those discharged to other facilities for contin-\nblacks had somewhat similar proportions among those who\npatients had higher rates of facility-based discharges than\nblacks (48.2% vs 35.1%). At the point of discharge, patients\nwith home discharges had higher average cost of hospitaliza-\ntion than those getting facility-based discharges. While\npatients did not have differences in the proportions of ACSC\nMkanta et al 3\nand average LOS in the 2 discharge categories, patients with\nhome discharges had greater proportion of having proce-\ndures on admission than those with facility-based discharges\neligibility had higher proportion of home discharges com-\npared with those with Medicaid-only coverage (54.2% vs\n34.0%). With the exception of California (11%), all other\nstates in the study had patients with greater proportions of\nhome-based discharges (between 11% and 22% higher).\nTable 2 displays the breakdown of total cost of hospital-\nization prior to discharge. It is shown that, on one hand,\npatients with discharges to institutional discharge destina-\nhospitalization compared with patients discharged to outpa-\ntient care, who had nearly twice the cost (US$11\nOn the other hand, patients with home-based discharges\nhad higher cost of hospitalization than institutionally dis-\ncharged patients but lower than that of patients discharged\nto outpatient settings.\nWe used multiple logistic regression model to assess the\nlikelihood of home discharges in Medicaid patients with hos-\npitalizations in the study states. Table 3 shows the results of\nthe logistic regression model in terms of odds ratios (ORs)\nand corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nAccording to the results of the logistic regression for the\nprediction of home discharges, we found that female patients\nwere more likely than males to be discharged to their own\nhomes (Table 3). Specifically, women were 63% more likely\nfor home discharges with higher age being associated with\n0.972). Compared with white and black patients, Hispanic\nTable 1.

Effective assessment of the factors at the point admission\ncould increase the potential for achieving the objectives of\nposthospital care needed at the home settings. In addition to\nthe prospects of increasing the number of patients with dis-\ncharges to comfortable and familiar home environment, from\npolicy and quality perspectives, knowledge of the profile of\npatients with the likelihood of home discharges would com-\nplement the national efforts in cost containment and manage-\nment of resource utilization by establishing the right strategy\nWe found that women were more likely than men to get\nhome discharges following hospitalizations. With about 58%\nof Medicaid enrollees in the nation being female,13 this find-\ning suggests that there is a greater potential for women mak-\ning the larger proportion of patients receiving home-based\ncare after hospital discharge, consequently leading to signifi-\ncant cost savings. Providers and caregivers have to adapt to\ngender-specific, home-based approaches to care that will\nmeet the needs of patients in home settings. Community fac-\ntors such as rural or urban setting and neighborhood resources\nshould be incorporated in the process of care to improve\ncompliance and enhance patient's perception of familiarity\nwith the environment of care.\nAnother important predictor for home discharges was\npatient's age. The data showed that older patients in the sam-\nple were significantly less likely to be discharged to their\nhomes. In spite of this finding, however, in instances where\npatient preference might be sought in choosing a discharge\ndestination, older patients might be more inclined to prefer\nhome-based discharges due to expectations in care that could\nvary with age. Previous studies have established that age is\nassociated with increased use of health care resources,14\nwhich could be explained in part by the fact that age is highly\ncorrelated with morbid chronic conditions leading to high\ninpatient utilization. Combined with our findings, this sug-\ngests that in the times when the nation is experiencing\nincreased proportion of aging population, cost savings are\npossible if home settings are promoted to become the regular\nplace for care provided to the traditionally high-utilization\ngroup of older aged adults. Furthermore, in absence of any\nclear evidence from the current study on the role of race in\nencouraging high rates and volumes of home discharges\namong Hispanic patients, strategies based on the previously\ndiscussed influence of gender and age could be used to\nensure patients of all races understand and value (the impor-\ntance of) home health services.\nAs concluded from earlier research, ACSC are conditions\nthat may be treated effectively in outpatient care settings and\nthus with great potential for reducing the need for inpatient\ncare.15,16 We found out patients hospitalized with primary\ndiagnoses of ACSC were less likely to be discharged to their\nhomes. Although this study could not clarify the reason for\nthis trend, one possible explanation is that persons admitted\nwith ACSC might be admitted when in very severe state with\nthese conditions due to delays in seeking care or other rea-\nsons related to their use of primary care services. As a quality\nperspective, the health care system should continue to find\nmeans to promoting effective use of primary care services to\nreduce the volume of preventable inpatient care that is com-\nmonly costly and more complex. At the least, primary care\nproviders should be able to assist patients having chronic\ncases of ACSC with information on how to receive case\nmanagement and/or disease management services to reduce\nhospitalizations.\nThe increased potential for home discharges among\npatients who undergo medical procedures during hospital\nadmissions could be partly reflective of the level of sophisti-\ncation attained in health care services. Same-day discharges\nor short-stay hospitalizations are possible for increasing\nnumbers of patients with various types of medical proce-\ndures. While initial charges of having a procedure could be\nhigh, cost savings are possible over the entire episode of care\nif the longer duration of care is organized and delivered at\nhome. Investment in medical technologies that have the\npotential to reduce the intensity of hospital care should be\nencouraged at the design stage as part of the policy adopted\nfor cost containment and quality improvement. Such techno-\nlogical interventions would be widely adopted if they are\ncapable of producing outcomes reflecting true efficiencies of\nproviders and systems of care, for example, when it becomes\npossible to reduce hospital stays without necessarily increas-\ning readmission rates.17\nIntuitively, prolonged lengths of hospital stay should res-\nonate genuine need for inpatient services, and, as a result,\nthose requiring the services might stay for relatively extended\nperiods of time followed by facility-based discharges. In our\nMkanta et al 5\nanalyses, increased LOS was associated with decreased like-\nlihood of home discharges, perhaps suggesting high intensity\nof care required for Medicaid enrollees, especially those with\nACSC, even after hospitalizations. Such patients might be\nresponsible for excessive cost among patients with home dis-\ncharges as observed at the bivariate level (Tables 1 and 2) .\nEffective primary care services together with enhanced\nhealth promotion and preventive health capacities should be\nregarded as key to the continuing effort to reduce the volume\nof inpatient care. Eventually, the relationships of LOS and\nexpenditure with discharge destination would be more mean-\ningful if examined based on specific types of conditions or\nsubpopulations of Medicaid enrollees.\nPrevious studies have found that dual eligibility is associ-\nated with high utilization of health services.18,19 Our findings\nthat individuals with dual eligibility have higher likelihood\nof home discharges suggest further examination is required\nto determine any possible factors contributing to this associ-\nation. Both patient factors and system factors such as\nMedicare provisions for home health services need to be\ninvestigated to determine whether they could be responsible\nfor increasing the likelihood of delivering resource-friendly,\ncost-effective home-based care to dually eligible patients.\nMarket forces and specific state provisions on Medicaid\ncoverage could be responsible in state variations seen in the\nlikelihood of home-based discharges. For example, pay\nfreezes and rate cuts exercised in different states might have\ncreated aggressive approaches in hospital services in some\nstates where large volumes of patients were able to be dis-\ncharged to their homes compared with other states.\nSeveral limitations are acknowledged in this study. First,\nalthough we computed the likelihood of home discharges that\nwere meant for continued care, it is possible that in our analy-\nses we included some patients who were discharged to their\nhomes after the completion of treatment routines. Second, it\nis important to note that our data consist of information on\ndischarges from general hospitalizations. A study involving\ndischarges from specific health conditions or other defined\npatient groups could have provided a more concise estimation\nof the home-based discharges. Last, the cross-sectional design\nused in this study limits the ability to determine any causality\nin the observed relationships used to assess the likelihood of\nhome-based discharges in the studied Medicaid population.\nDespite the limitations, however, this study drew its strength\nfrom the large size of the data involved and the analyses that\nproduced findings critical for understanding factors impact-\ning discharge destination in Medicaid population.\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that there is a potential\nfor successful cost-containment strategies in utilization of\nresources associated with inpatient care if careful plans are\nmade to identify patients who can be successfully discharged\nto their home settings to continue with posthospital care.\nHospitals and systems of care should invest in understanding\nand supporting design, management, and operations of care\ndelivered at home. They should have the interest of making\nhome-based settings a preferred destination for patients\nreceiving posthospital care if meaningful cost savings are to\nbe achieved.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nwork was supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant\nReferences\n1.
