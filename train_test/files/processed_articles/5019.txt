The\npurpose of this study was to investigate the nature of implicit theories of intelligence for 63 African American adolescents\nwho are seventh and eighth graders in a public charter school.The two-way ANOVA revealed that these adolescents held\na malleable view of intelligence, which did not vary by gender or grade. Exploratory correlation analysis showed some\nconsistent relationships with achievement motivation variables found in other studies.These findings may be explained by\nAfricanAmerican cultural values and the personality characteristic adaptations that they make living within a racialized society.\n",

Furthermore, the\nresearch that has been conducted with predominately African\nAmerican and Hispanic samples is too small to draw mean-\ningful generalizations. These studies do allow, however, some\ntheoretical propositions to be explored in the present study.\nQuihuis et al. (2002) applied a mixed-method approach\nto the examination of the implicit theories of intelligence for\na group of Mexican American adolescents. The survey\nfindings revealed that these high school students adopted\ndomain-specific (e.g., math, science) implicit views of intel-\nligence, while the qualitative interviews suggested that they\nconcurrently held characteristics of both views. Similar to\nthe Mexican American students in this study, the views of\nAfrican Americans and other students of color may be influ-\nenced by cultural values that reflect their racialized experi-\nences within American culture as a result of having to\nnegotiate society's master narratives of race and intellectual\ncapacity that have evolved over time (see Winston &\nThe studies that have been conducted with African\nAmericans did not seek to examine the nature of these stu-\ndents' implicit intelligence theories. Instead, they focused\non manipulating the participants' views of intelligence to\npromote malleability. The only experimental study that uti-\nlized a predominately African American adolescent sample\nwas conducted by Blackwell et al. (2007). In this study, the\nincremental theory of intelligence was taught to a group of\nseventh graders over an 8-week period. This intervention\nresulted in students' increased mathematics achievement\nand classroom motivation. One of the limitations of this\nstudy was that the data were not disaggregated by race, and\ntherefore, the specific nature of implicit theories of intelli-\ngence for African American adolescents is still unknown.\nAnother experiment by Aronson et al. (2002) was conducted\nwith an equivalent number of African American and\nCaucasian college students and investigated the impact that\npromoting an incremental view of intelligence would have\nin reducing stereotype threat and, subsequently, increasing\nacademic performance. The short-term effects of the manip-\nulation showed that the African American students' experi-\nenced increased academic performance and more strongly\nembraced the incremental view of intelligence over time.\nThere are several reasons why understanding the nature\nof implicit intelligence theories of African American adoles-\ncents is important. First, during the middle school transition,\nthere is a well-documented drop in students'grades, achieve-\nment motivation, and overall psychological well-being\n(Eccles & Midgley, 1989; Good, Aronson, & Inzlicht,\n2003). In addition to the change in academic environment,\nadolescents are adapting to the numerous biological changes\nthat occur during puberty, cognitive shifts associated with\nan increased capacity for abstract thinking, and increasingly\ncomplex relationships with peers, parents, and teachers\nGiven the link between implicit theories of intelligence\nand achievement motivation found in previous studies\nMolden, 2005), it is important to examine the nature of\nAfrican American students' implicit theories of intelligence\nand their relation to adaptive patterns of achievement moti-\nvation during this critical developmental period. Research\non implicit theories of intelligence has shown that students'\ntheories about intelligence are related to their achievement\nmotivation and academic performance (Dweck, 2000). For\nexample, a malleable view of intelligence has been found to\nbe positively related to mastery goals, but negatively associ-\nated with both performance-approach and performance-\navoidance goals (Fonseca, Cury, Bailly, & Rufo, 2004).\nAn additional reason why studying the implicit theories\nof intelligence among African American adolescents is\nimportant is that there is very little research that focuses on\nAfrican Americans and intelligence (see Cokley, Caldwell,\nMiller, & Muhammad, 2001). Furthermore, that which does\nexist focuses almost exclusively on intelligence testing\n(see Butler-Omololu, Doster, & Lahey, 1983; Graves &\ntance of students' beliefs about intelligence in shaping their\nachievement motivation and success.\nFinally, examining African American adolescents'\npersonal beliefs about intelligence is both interesting and\nimportant due to the cultural historical debates, symbols, and\nstereotyped expectations in American society about race and\nthe intellectual capacity of African Americans (see Winston\n& Winston, 2012). For example, Robert Bennett Bean\n(1906), a professor of anatomy at the University of Virginia\nMedical School, asserted that the \"Negro brain\" developed\nnormally as far as perception, memory, and motor responses\nwere concerned, but logical critical thinking or the compre-\nhension of abstract ideas were beyond its grasp because of\n60 years later, Arthur Jensen's (1969) popular article, \"How\nMuch Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?\"\nargued that genetic factors are more meaningful than envi-\nronmental factors in assessing IQ differences. More recently,\nHerrnstein and Murray's (1994) book, The Bell Curve:\nWynn et al. 3\nIntelligence and Class Structure in American Life, continued\nthis line of ideology, arguing that there were intellectual dif-\nferences across racial groups that resulted from the innate\ngenetic inferiority of Blacks and superiority of Whites.\nThis type of racist ideology is deeply entrenched in soci-\nety's master narratives of race and intelligence on the\none hand, but on the other hand, it is resisted and countered\nin Black culturally responsive contexts (Burrell, Winston,\n& Freeman, in press). Given that African American adoles-\ncents' beliefs about intelligence develop in multiple racial-\nized societal contexts, their psychological development is\nparticularly complex. In sum, these dual contexts serve to\nsocialize African American adolescents' beliefs about the\ngeneral nature of intelligence. Schunk (1991) has empha-\nsized the importance of context in shaping students' beliefs\nabout their ability and competence. Social contexts may\nlikely influence students' development of more specific\nbeliefs about intelligence as either malleable or fixed.\nPurpose of the Study\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of\nimplicit theories of intelligence held by African American\nadolescents. The study also examined within-group varia-\ntions in the nature of these beliefs, as well as explored other\nachievement motivation correlates that have been found to\nbe related to implicit theories of intelligence in other studies\nHenderson & Dweck, 1990). The primary research question\naddressed in this study was as follows:\nWhat is the nature of African American adolescents'\nimplicit theories of intelligence?\nTheoretical Framework\nThe theoretical framework for the present study is grounded\nin several tenets of implicit intelligence theory. At its core,\nimplicit intelligence theory describes individual's beliefs\nabout intelligence as ranging between being fixed, innate,\nstatic, trait-like, and relatively unchanging (the \"entity\"\nview) or being malleable, dynamic, and developable\n(the \"incremental\" view) such that an increase in effort can\nOne central tenet of implicit intelligence theory that is\ndirectly explored in this study is that there is a relationship\nbetween malleable views of intelligence and achievement\nmotivation. During adolescence, the transition from the more\nmastery-oriented learning style taught in elementary school\nto the more performance goal orientation that is promoted in\nmiddle school has been found to be quite challenging for stu-\ndents with an entity view of intelligence (Dweck, 2002).\nStudents with a malleable view of intelligence have more\nadaptive achievement motivation, and challenges are viewed\nas an opportunity for growth. Furthermore, setbacks are not\ninternalized as failures by students with a malleable view of\nintelligence. Since the focused goal is on mastering the\ninformation, there is not a concern about looking either\n\"smart\" or \"dumb\" to others.\nDuring middle school, students who view their intelli-\ngence as being fixed feel that their intelligence is threatened\nwhen they are faced with tasks that confront their professed\nabilities and demonstrated success from elementary school\n(Dweck, 2000). This opposition to their preconceived belief\nsystem can lead to a decrease in self-esteem, motivation,\nand the development of maladaptive behaviors such as task\navoidance, self-handicapping, and classroom disengage-\nof praise to young children when they succeed at tasks\n(especially simple ones) can promote an entity view of intel-\nligence and produce maladaptive effects at later stages in\ntheir development. The present study adopted the theoreti-\ncal view that the more malleable African American students'\nviews of intelligence, the more adaptive their achievement\nmotivation.\nA second tenet of implicit intelligence theory is that there\nis an intersection of individuals' beliefs and the classroom\nsetting. According to Blackwell et al. (2007), \"children's\nbeliefs become the mental `baggage' that they bring to the\nachievement situation\" (p. 259). Unlike entity theorists,\npersons holding an incremental view of intelligence are less\ninclined to form judgments about the intelligence of others\nbased solely on their successes or failures; however, they are\nmore likely to apply their belief in change potential to other\nindividuals (Dweck, 2000). This can be very critical to aca-\ndemic achievement in a classroom setting when the teacher\nholds an incremental view of intelligence and applies this\nbelief to the student. Dweck (2006) cites a personal example\nof the detriment of having a sixth-grade teacher who\nbelieved that people's IQ scores told the whole story\nof who they were . . . we were seated around the room\nin IQ order . . . she was creating a mindset in which\neveryone in the class had one consuming goal--look\nsmart, don't look dumb. (p. 6)\nIn the present study, the theoretical view is adopted that\nAfrican American students whose learning is socialized\nwithin a classroom setting and school context that empha-\nsizes Black cultural values and beliefs will adopt a more\nincremental view of intelligence. That is, this view of intel-\nligence is consistent with the African American cultural\nvalue of persistence and adopting a strong work ethic to\nachieve success. Previous research supports this view of\nthe importance of culture as shaping views of intelligence\nand has found that cultural values of Mexican Americans\nand Koreans influence these students' implicit intelligence\ntheories (Quihuis et al., 2002; Woong, Plucker, & Im,\n4 SAGE Open\nThe Present Study\nIn sum, the present study investigates the nature of African\nAmerican adolescents' implicit intelligence theories. As\nwith prior work, we adopt the perspective that these beliefs\nare particularly important to examine during middle school\nbecause of the myriad of psychological changes within the\nindividual and the transitional characteristics of students'\nlearning environments. In addition, this study aims to\nexplore the psychological correlates of these adolescents'\nimplicit intelligence theories as a mechanism to gain more\ninsight into the nature of these beliefs.\nThis is the first study of implicit intelligence to argue\nthat it is important to examine the nature of implicit intel-\nligence in African American adolescents, because\ntheir intelligence beliefs develop in a racialized social and\ncultural environment. Furthermore, it is within this social\nenvironment that master narratives of race and intelligence\nhave been pervasive. Although this study does not examine\nrace meaning directly, it does extend knowledge about the\nnature of intelligence for African American adolescents.\nThis is a group for whom master narratives of race and\nintelligence, as inaccurate as they may be (see Winston &\nWinston, 2012), can inform the psychological negotiation\nthat the individual must engage in when trying to develop\nimplicit intelligence beliefs.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe participants in this study are part of a larger mixed-\nmethods study examining the role of students' achievement\nmotivation, identity, social relationships, and perceptions of\nschool culture in mathematics and science success. The\nparticipants included 63 African American seventh and\neighth grade students enrolled in an urban, predominately\nAfrican American, public charter middle school with\nan academic curriculum that is focused on science and\nmathematics. The school is located in the Mid-Atlantic\nregion of the United States. In all, 51% of the participants\nare female, with 48% of the sample in the seventh grade and\n52% in the eighth grade.\nMeasures\nThe Middle School Experiences (ME) Survey (Freeman,\nWinston, & Wynn, 2007) was administered to the partici-\npants. This survey included several well-established scales\nmeasuring achievement motivation, identity, perceptions of\nschool culture, and social relationships. Dweck's (2000)\nImplicit Theories of Intelligence Scale for Children\u00adSelf\nForm (For Age 10 and Older) was used in its entirety in this\nstudy as a measurement of implicit intelligence views. This\nis a six-item scale with a 6-point Likert-type response scale\nranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 6 (strongly disagree). A\nsample item is, \"You can learn new things, but you can't\nreally change your basic intelligence\" (see Appendix A). The\nscale provided a mix of entity and incremental response\nquestions and the three entity items were reverse-coded for\nanalysis, thus higher scores indicate more malleable views\nof intelligence. The reliability for this scale was .81.\nThe achievement motivation variables were measured\nusing the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales (PALS)\ndeveloped by Midgley et al. (2000). This study examined\ncorrelations between implicit intelligence beliefs and per-\nsonal achievement goals, classroom goal structures, and\nachievement beliefs and strategies. Personal Achievement\nGoal Orientations comprised four scales (task goal orienta-\ntion, ability/approach goal orientation, ability/avoidance\ngoal orientation, and extrinsic goal orientation) for both\nmathematics and science domains. Achievement goals are\nthe reason students engage in particular academic behaviors\nand tasks. Different types of achievement goals elicit differ-\nent response patterns.\nStudents oriented toward task goals are focused on mas-\ntering the information and aim to develop their competence\nand understanding in a subject area. These four items\ncomprised a 5-point Likert-type response scale ranging\nfrom 1 (not at all true) to 5 (very true). A sample item is,\n\"An important reason I do my math work is because I like to\nlearn new things.\" The reliability for this scale was .83 for\nthe mathematics domain and .86 for the science domain.\nAn ability/approach goal orientation involves engaging in\nschoolwork to display competence. These five items had a\n5-point Likert-type response scale ranging from 1 (not at all\ntrue) to 5 (very true). A sample item is, \"I would feel\nsuccessful in science if I did better than most of the other\nstudents in the class.\" The reliability for this scale was .79\nfor the mathematics domain and .83 for the science domain.\nAn ability/avoidance goal orientation is focused on\nperformance and trying to avoid looking incompetent.\nResearch has found this type of goal orientation to be pri-\nmarily associated with maladaptive learning patterns. These\nsix items comprised a 5-point Likert-type response scale\nranging from 1 (not at all true) to 5 (very true). A sample\nitem is, \"An important reason I do my math work is so that\nI won't embarrass myself.\" The reliability for this scale\nwas .84 for the mathematics domain and .81 for the science\ndomain.\nExtrinsic goal orientation focuses on students' engage-\nment in schoolwork for the purpose of obtaining an outcome\nor reward such as a good grade, passing a test or promotion\nto the next grade level. These four items had a 5-point Likert-\ntype response scale ranging from 1 (not at all true) to 5 (very\ntrue).Asample item is, \"I do my work in science so that I can\npass the class.\" The reliability for this scale was .68 for the\nmathematics domain and .69 for the science domain.\nPerception of classroom goal structure refers to the\nstudents' perceptions of the teacher's specific emphasis on\nWynn et al. 5\ndifferent types of achievement goal structures. These types\nof goals were measured using three scales (task-focused,\nability-focused, and extrinsic focused). Task-focused goals\nof the teacher place emphasis on developing competence\nand mastery in a particular subject area. These five items\nhad a 5-point Likert-type response scale ranging from 1\n(not at all true) to 5 (very true). A sample item is, \"My math\nteacher thinks mistakes are ok as long as we are learning.\"\nThe reliability for this scale was .84 for the mathematics\ndomain and .87 for the science domain. Ability-focused\ngoals differ from task goals because the student perceives\nthe teacher to be focusing on the students demonstrating\ntheir competence and outperforming others. These six items\nhad a 5-point Likert-type response scale ranging from 1\n(not at all true) to 5 (very true). A sample item is, \"My\nscience teacher tells us how we compare to other students.\"\nThe reliability for this scale was .69 for the mathematics\ndomain and .72 for the science domain. Extrinsic classroom\ngoal structures of the teacher focus on students' engagement\nin schoolwork for the purpose of obtaining an outcome\nor reward such as a good grade, passing a test, or promotion\nto the next grade level. These three items had a 5-point\nLikert-type response scale ranging from 1 (not at all true) to\n5 (very true). A sample item is, \"My math teacher tells us we\nneed to learn our math work because we will be tested on\nit.\" The reliability for this scale was .65 for the mathematics\ndomain and .79 for the science domain.\nAcademic-related perceptions, beliefs, and strategies\nrefer to students' perceptions of their competence to do their\nclass work and specific learning strategies. These types\nof constructs were measured using self-efficacy and self-\nregulation scales. Self-efficacy refers to students' judgment\nperception of their ability to perform well in their class work.\nThese seven items had a 5-point Likert-type response scale\nranging from 1 (not at all true) to 5 (very true). A sample\nitem is, \"I'm certain I can master the skills taught in\nmath this year.\" The reliability for this scale was .83 for the\nmathematics domain and .80 for the science domain. Self-\nregulation refers to students' control and direction of their\nengagement in academic work. It includes behavioral\n(rechecking work, designating study space) and cognitive\n(monitoring understanding, concentrating) dimensions\n(Pintrich & De Groot, 1990). These six items had a 5-point\nLikert-type response scale ranging from 1 (not at all true) to\n5 (very true). A sample item is, \"When I notice that I haven't\nbeen listening to my science teacher, I try to concentrate\nharder.\" The reliability for this scale was .76 for the mathe-\nmatics domain and .81 for the science domain.\nProcedure\nAll students in the middle school were invited to participate\nin the study via informational letters and consent forms that\nwere sent home to parents to explain the purpose of the\nstudy and to request written consent for their children's par-\nticipation. The present study uses data collected in spring of\n2009. Participants were administered the ME Survey\n(Freeman et al., 2007) in groups, during their regular school\nday. Survey administration took approximately 45 min. The\nsurvey questions were read aloud to the participants by a\nsurvey administrator while additional survey administrators\nwalked around the room to answer questions and to ensure\nthat the participants stayed on course with the reader. When\nstudents completed the survey, the research team leader\ndebriefed them as a group and gave them a 10-dollar gift\ncard for participation in the study.\nData Analysis\nAs the initial step in the data analytic approach, a reliability\nanalysis was conducted to test the consistency of the items\nin the implicit intelligence scale. Second, descriptive analy-\nsis was utilized to describe the implicit intelligence beliefs\nof the study sample. Third, a two-way between-groups\nANOVA was performed to determine whether there were\nany significant statistical differences in implicit intelligence\nby gender and grade level, and to also test whether there was\na significant interaction between gender and grade level on\nimplicit intelligence. Finally, an exploratory correlation\nanalysis was conducted to examine the relationship between\nimplicit theories of intelligence and achievement motivation\nvariables.\nResults\nThe research question that guided this study was, \"What is\nthe nature of African American adolescents' implicit theories\nof intelligence?\" On average, adolescents in this sample held\na malleable view of intelligence. As shown in Figure 1, an\nitem response analysis specifically revealed that no student in\nthe sample strongly disagreed with the belief that intelligence\nis malleable. The descriptive analysis in Table 1 illustrates\nthat students' average implicit intelligence theory score\nduring the fall was 4.37 on a 6-point scale, with an increase\nto a 4.60 in the spring. This malleable view also increased\nslightly over the academic year by both gender and grade\nlevel, with both girls and eighth graders possessing higher\nlevels of malleability. The ANOVA showed that these views\ndid not vary significantly by adolescents' gender or grade\nlevel (see Tables 2 and 3), and there was not a significant\ninteraction between gender and grade level.\nThe nature of implicit theories of intelligence was also\nexamined in terms of their bivariate relationships with other\nachievement motivation variables. As shown in Tables 4, 5\nand 6, two achievement motivation variables were signifi-\ncantly correlated with a malleable view of intelligence.\nStudents with more malleable views of intelligence were\nmore likely to have higher science efficacy beliefs than\n6 SAGE Open\nstudents with more fixed intelligence beliefs. In addition,\nstudents who perceived an ability focus in their science\nclassrooms held less malleable views of intelligence than\nstudents who perceived less of an ability focus in their\nscience classrooms.\nDiscussion\nThe goal of this study was to gain insight into the nature of\nimplicit theories of intelligence for African American\nadolescents utilizing a sample of African American seventh\nand eighth grade students from an urban public\ncharter middle school. In general, the implicit theories of\nintelligence for African American adolescents in this study\nwere malleable for both boys and girls, as well as seventh\nand eighth graders. Consistent with extant research and\ntheory, students with more malleable views of intelligence\nwere more likely to have other positive motivational\ncharacteristics than students with more fixed views of intel-\nligence. The motivation patterns among this sample are\nconsistent with other research findings on the achievement\nmotivation of African Americans. For example, other\nstudies have found that a classroom ability focus can be\nespecially negative for African American youth (Gutman,\n2006), and in this study, it was associated with more fixed\nviews of intelligence. In addition, high academic efficacy\nbeliefs have been suggested to be a cultural strength of\nAfrican Americans (Anderson, Freeman, & Winston, 2011;\nstudy, science efficacy beliefs were positively correlated\nwith malleable views of intelligence. Similar to the findings\nwith positive efficacy beliefs, we posit that malleable views\nof intelligence are also a cultural strength of African\nAmericans given omnipresent negative master narratives\nand stereotype threats.\nWe suggest two possible interpretations for why these\nadolescents held more malleable views of intelligence. One\nexplanation is that these adolescents may adopt the theory\nthat intelligence is malleable because of their cultural values\nand racial socialization. It is well established that the cultural\nvalues of African Americans include a strong achievement\norientation, as well as endorsement of effort and hard work,\nas a means of upward mobility (Bowman & Howard, 1985;\nGoddard, 1984). These values, like other Afrocultural values\n(see Tyler et al., 2008) have been generationally transmitted\nfrom parent to child through the process of racial socializa-\ntion. This may shape an adolescent's view of intelligence as\nvarying with hard work, thus translating into socialization\naround education. In addition, the middle school is located\non the campus of a Historically Black University. This may\nbe why many of the parents chose to send their children to\nthe school, and it could be that these students' families pro-\nmote cultural pride socialization.\nStrongly\nDisagree\nDisagree Mostly\nDisagree\nMostly\nAgree\nAgree Strongly\nAgree\nFigure 1.

The school\nthat these students attend has a specialized focus on sci-\nence and mathematics and a mission of academic excel-\nlence that includes promotion of the intellectual, social,\nand emotional growth of its predominately African\nAmerican student body. Matriculation in a school where\nstudents are exposed daily to a principal, and staff and\nteachers who are predominantly African American and in\nan atmosphere where academic excellence is not only\nencouraged but also expected provides a unique context\nfor learning and positive psychological development.\nThese experiences may be guided by teachers who\nencourage hard work and growth in their socialization\npractices as a proactive method to counter society's mas-\nter narratives of race and intelligence. The teachers in\nthis school also engage in cultural pride socialization of\nOne of the most important findings within existing\nresearch on implicit theories of intelligence is the positive\nrelationship between malleable theories of intelligence and\nTable 4.

Within the present study,\nthe correlations found between self-efficacy and implicit\ntheories of intelligence suggest adaptive motivational char-\nacteristics of these African American adolescents. Students\nwho are more self-efficacious are confident in their ability to\novercome challenges and to persist when faced with obsta-\ncles, which would explain the positive relationship with a\nmalleable view of intelligence.\nLimitations\nThere are a few limitations to the present study that are\nimportant to consider. First, the quantitative method in\nwhich implicit views of intelligence were measured in the\npresent study does not account for the possibility that per-\nsons can hold both views simultaneously or have views of\nintelligence that are domain specific. Second, the sample\nmay not be generalizable to the larger population of\nAfrican American adolescents due to the small sample size\nand the unique learning environment of the sample.\nAlthough there was a relationship found between some of\nthe achievement motivation variables and implicit views\nof intelligence, a causal influence of these beliefs on\nachievement motivation cannot be determined. In addi-\ntion, these participants were enrolled at a school with a\ncommitment to success in the highly specialized domains\nof science and mathematics. This specialized curriculum\nmay attract students who possess more growth-oriented\nmindsets.\nFuture Directions\nThe present study was effective in capturing the nature of\nimplicit theories of intelligence for African American ado-\nlescents, which had not been addressed in previous research.\nFuture research should investigate the way in which\nimplicit intelligence beliefs operate in different academic\ndomains to determine the contextual specificity for this\ngroup. Employing a mixed-method research strategy that\nincludes interviews and focus groups could provide greater\nknowledge of the underlying meaning-making process in\nthe development of implicit theories of intelligence.\nUnderstanding the ways in which these students conceptu-\nalize their academic identity may provide valuable insight\ninto the impact on subsequent behavior patterns that these\nstudents adopt in challenging academic situations. It may\nalso provide insight into why differential relations were\nfound in the present study between students' view of intel-\nligence and different domains of achievement motivation.\nTo expand the generalizability of the findings from the pres-\nent study, future research on the nature of African American\nadolescents' implicit views of intelligence should include\nstudents from diverse academic and socioeconomic back-\ngrounds. In addition to increasing the sample size, it would\nalso be important to include sixth graders to explore\nimplicit theories of intelligence during adolescents' initial\ntransition from elementary school to middle/junior high\nschool.\nConclusion and Implications\nIt is not absolutely clear from this study whether these stu-\ndents' malleable views of their intelligence mean that they\ndo not endorse the master narrative of race and intelligence\nplotline that African Americans are inherently or innately\nintellectually inferior. However, the findings from the pres-\nent study do strongly suggest that students in this sample\nbelieved that intelligence can be developed. This may mean\nthat these adolescents were able to utilize their lived experi-\nences within a racialized society to create counter narratives\nabout race and intelligence that produce more adaptive\nadolescent development.\nThis cultural historical complexity of the meaning of\nmaster narratives of race and intelligence makes it challeng-\ning to make interpretations about the meaning-making pro-\ncess an African American adolescent may engage in when\ntrying to develop a person theory of intelligence as either\nfixed or malleable. Winston and Winston (2012) theorize\nthat when African Americans are asked to define what intel-\nligence means, the pervasiveness of master narratives of race\nand intelligence within racialized societies cause most to\npsychologically negotiate the racist ideology associated with\nthese master narratives of race to decide to what extent they\nendorse or reject such beliefs as self-relevant. What is less\nclear, however, is how specifically these master narratives of\nrace evolve and are responded to among African American\nadolescents due to the relative immaturity of their cognitive\nexperience and the variable intensity of their exposure to\nAmerican culture's racist ideology. Nonetheless, because\nthese master narratives of race and intelligence are so theo-\nretically pervasive within racialized cultures, it is likely that\nby adolescence, African Americans have some exposure and\nin some situations have to make sense of their meaning.\nThere is also some evidence from a study conducted by\nBurrell et al. (in press) with students drawn from the same\nsample as the present study, that these adolescents have\ndeveloped personal beliefs about intelligence in the form of\nhow intelligence characterizes what it means to act Black\nand to act White.\nFor Dr. Benjamin Carson, his counter narrative con-\nstruction about race and intelligence was initiated by two\nlife-changing events in the fifth grade. First, unbeknownst\nto him, a schoolwide vision examination revealed that his\neyesight was so abysmal that he almost qualified for handi-\ncapped status. Second, the engaged parenting approach of\nhis mother led to a more forceful hands-on intervention\nregarding his education. Young Ben Carson was now liter-\nally seeing the world more clearly through his new glasses.\nAlso, due to an almost immediate improvement in grades,\nhe saw himself as a more capable learner who was able to\nrecognize the ongoing support of his teacher, as well as the\nhigh expectation beliefs that his mother possessed for him.\nWynn et al. 9\nSeeing that passing grade made me feel good. I\nthought, I made a D in math. I'm improving. There's\nhope for me. I'm not the dumbest kid in school. When\na kid like me who had been at the bottom of the class\nfor the first half of the year suddenly zoomed upward--\neven if only from F to D--that experience gave birth\nDr. Carson had finally begun to develop his \"adaptive\"\nlens, a counter internalized narrative of self about his intel-\nligence that would lead to one of the most successful careers\nin American medicine.\nAppendix A\nImplicitTheories of Intelligence Scale for\nChildren\u00adSelf Form (For Age 10 and Older)\nRead each sentence below and then circle the one number\nthat shows how much you agree with it.
