Balestrini\nUniversity of Surrey (UK)\n Keywords: Utilitarianism, European Integration, Public Opinion, National Identity\nIntroduction\nThe significant increase in power of the EU in the last two decades has made the EU more\nof a point of reference for citizens living in the member states. With this increase, academic\ninterest in the public's views on European integration has grown. Previous research has\nestablished that utilitarianism and identity-related factors play a role in determining public\nattitudes to European integration (for example, Gabel, 1998; Carey, 2002 and Hooghe and\nMarks, 2005). Some scholars have sought to find out which of the utilitarian self-interest\nand identity-based approaches is more important in swaying public support for the EU (for\nexample, Hooghe and Marks, 2004). Others have started to investigate the relationship\nbetween these two perspectives and more specifically whether utilitarianism can arbitrate\nthe effect of national identity on public attitudes to the EU (De Vries and Van Kersbergen,\n2007 and Garry and Tilley, 2009). These studies have however provided us with a limited\nsnapshot of the conditional nature of determinants of public attitudes to the EU. I wish\nhere to elaborate on the relationship between the two approaches but also on how each\nelement of the utilitarian theory \u00ad that is to say education, occupation and future expecta-\ntions about the financial situation of the household \u00ad impacts on each other to affect public\nattitudes towards European integration.\nThe purpose of this paper is to examine the nature and scope of the interactions between\nutilitarian-based elements and the relationship of utilitarianism with national identity as a\ndriver of citizens' EU support in the post-Maastricht era. This paper expands the public\n\u00d3 2012 Swiss Political Science Association\nopinion literature on European integration by testing, cross-nationally and cross-tempo-\nrally, the mediating role of utilitarian explanations on the relationship between national\nidentity and EU support. It also contributes to public opinion literature on European inte-\ngration by analysing whether citizens' occupations, education and perceptions of their per-\nsonal economic conditions interact with one another to sway public support for the EU.\nThis article is structured as follows. Firstly, it starts with a discussion of previous research\non public attitudes towards the EU, including expositions of the utilitarian and identity-\nbased theories. Secondly, it sets out four hypotheses, which are tested on the basis of Euro-\nbarometer datasets for twelve EU countries during the period from 1993 to 2006. Thirdly,\nthe findings are discussed and implications are drawn.\nUtilitarianism and EU support\nCitizens' priorities are of two types: concerns about economic and physical security (materi-\nalist values) and concerns about human rights, the environment and quality of life issues\n(post materialist values). Economic prosperity and peace, after the Second World War, have\nsuperseded citizens' class-based materialist values with post-material values such as environ-\nmentalism, women's and minorities' rights, democratic participation and nuclear disarma-\nment (Inglehart, 1977a). Because younger age cohorts \u00ad also better educated and more\nhighly paid individuals \u00ad are more post-material, Inglehart (1977b) proposed that support\nfor European integration should be higher in younger groups. More recent studies have\nhowever reported that age has no effect and post-materialistic values no or little effect on\nThe approval of materialism as an element of support for European integration orien-\ntated researchers to explore the utilitarian perspective. According to this perspective, citi-\nzens evaluate the integration process (with its economic, social and political consequences)\nin terms of its costs and benefits, nationally and individually. Previous research has demon-\nstrated that citizens' positive perceptions of national and personal economic conditions\nincreased the level of support for EU integration (see for example, Carey, 2002; Llamazares\nIt was also found that people with human and financial capital \u00ad higher incomes, better\neducation and higher (more marketable) occupational skills \u00ad are more supportive of inte-\ngration as the market liberalization pertaining to EU integration offers more opportunities\nResearch to date has not however tested whether citizens' occupations, education and per-\nceptions of their personal economic conditions interact with one another to sway public\nsupport for the EU. Examining the nature of these relationships is nevertheless particularly\nimportant as it can help to determine the leading utilitarian factors of support for integra-\ntion. This will be tested in the present analysis. It is contended that the impact of education\non EU support is mediated by occupation (Hypothesis HI\n). I expect that EU citizens in\nhigher occupations with a lower education are more supportive of integration than those in\nlower occupations with a higher education. Higher occupational skills are generally valued\nmore than a higher education in the job market. Having had a higher education is also\nlikely to be more important to those in higher occupations than those in lower occupations\nin the same (see for example, Carnevale, Rose and Cheah, 2011). I theorize that market lib-\neralisation relating to integration offers more opportunities for those in higher occupations\n(even with a lower education) than those in lower occupations with a higher education. If\nmarket liberalisation can intensify job insecurity for both groups of citizens via the shifting\nof production across borders, occupational welfare and mobility is likely to be more diffi-\ncult for citizens in lower occupations with a higher education.\nIt is also argued that the impact of future personal financial expectations on EU support\nis conditioned by education and occupation (Hypotheses HII\nand HIII\n). I expect that EU\nnationals who have positive future expectations about their personal financial situation irre-\nspective of whether they have a lower education, support the EU more than those with nega-\ntive expectations and a higher education. It is argued here that the personal economic\noptimism will cancel out any hypothetical economic reservation about European integration\nand more specifically its associated job insecurity. The same reasoning applies to individuals\nin lower occupations. It is therefore maintained that EU nationals in lower occupations who\nhave positive future expectations about their personal financial situation are more likely to\nback EU integration than those with negative expectations and in higher occupations.\nInfluence of National Identity on Support for the European Union\nThe national identity theory also explains public support for European integration. The\nnational political, economic, historical and cultural contexts influence the development of\ncitizen attitudes towards the EU (Angelucci, 1993 and Kritzinger, 2003). In the last two\ndecades, the greater sway of the European Union in the economic, political and cultural\nmatters of each member state \u00ad previously under the sole responsibility of the nation-\nstate \u00ad encroaches on the attachment that an individual feels towards the nation. The more\nexclusive the attachment, the less likely it is that the individual will endorse measures that\nreduce national influence over economics and politics. The loss of national sovereignty is\nkey here and pertains to developments towards for instance, a common foreign and defence\npolicy, a European currency, or the increased primacy of European law. Eurosceptic politi-\ncal parties and party factions in EU member states1 partly articulate their opposition to\nEuropean integration on the basis that it threatens national identity and sovereignty. Vari-\nous studies have demonstrated the relationship between the importance of exclusive\nnational identity and lack of support for European integration (Kaltenthaler and Anderson,\nare a better predictor of EU dissent than economic considerations (Hooghe and Marks,\nis that they only relied on data from one year or data which do not encompass the 21st\ncentury period.\nPrevious research has explored the possibility that the benefits that individuals can obtain\nfrom European integration can arbitrate the relationship between national identity matters\nand public support for the EU. Net EU budgetary transfers, economic development and\neconomic pessimism were thus found to condition the impact of national identity on public\nattitudes towards the EU (De Vries and Van Kersbergen, 2007 and Garry and Tilley, 2009).\nThe results of these studies are though only based on data from one year. This restricts their\nscope and the validity of these results across time remains questionable.\nOur focus here is on microeconomic considerations. It is contended that the impact of\nnational identity on EU support is mediated by economic pessimism/optimism (Hypothesis\n1 Examples are political parties such as Lega Nord in Italy, and factions within the Labour Party and the Conser-\nvative Party (from 1997, the leadership of the Conservative Party adopted though a more eurosceptic stance) and\npolitical parties in the political periphery such as UKIP and BNP in the United Kingdom. For a discussion on\neuroscepticism in party politics in EU nations, see for example, Szcerbiak and Taggart, 2008.\nInteractions and EU Support 373\nHIV\n). I expect that EU citizens with an inclusive national identity who have negative future\nexpectations about their personal financial situation are more supportive of the EU than\nthose with an exclusive national identity who have positive expectations. Individuals\ndevelop intense group loyalties long before they develop rational faculties. The premise of\nsocial identity theory is that ``who one is'' depends on which groups one identifies with.\nThis brings a group loyalty which can be extremely powerful in shaping views towards\nThe strongest territorial identities are national and such identities can affect public prefer-\nences towards European integration. An individual harbouring an exclusive (or inclusive)\nnational identity will show a particularly strong affective attachment towards the nation (or\ntowards the nation and the EU) which is likely to show some resistance to positive (or nega-\ntive) economic rationality. This resistance is unlikely to be fully offset by economic opti-\nmism (or pessimism) and still retains a leading role in influencing public preferences\ntowards the EU.\nMethodology\nThe hypotheses aim to study the pattern of interactions between utilitarian-related elements\nand how these affect public EU support. How utilitarianism conditions the effect of\nnational identity on public attitudes to the EU is also examined during the period from\n1993 to 2006. The study is done at the individual level and based on twelve nations includ-\ning the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg,\nthe Netherlands, Ireland, Greece and Denmark.2 The Eurobarometer data surveys used for\nthe hypotheses in the period of study justifies this data selection. The primary goal in build-\ning the regression models was to examine the unique effects of independent variables on the\ndependent variable, with maximising the explained variance in the regression analyses com-\ning only as a secondary goal. National weights are used to make the national samples more\nrepresentative of the total populations.\nBeside the fact that it coincided with major developments in the EU integration process,\nthe 1993\u00ad2006 period was selected because fourteen years is an adequate period for ascer-\ntaining the effects of perceived and actual personal economic and social conditions on pub-\nlic opinion concerning integration, but also for taking account of the nature and direction\nof changes in the EU which affected people's lives. The fourteen-year period is adequate to\ncarry out time-series analysis.\nSelection and operationalization of variables\nThe dependent variable used to test EU support is the following:\n``Taking everything into consideration, would you say that (OUR COUNTRY) has on balance\nbenefited or not from being a member of the European Union?''\nAnswer coded 0 for don't know and not benefited and answer coded 1 for benefited\nThe rationale for selecting the EU benefit dependent variable and retaining ``don't know''\nresponses in the benefit question is as follows. This variable gauges utilitarian support\n2 These countries were EU members throughout the study period.\n(recognised as such by previous research literature) and is available across years. The selec-\ntion of a measure of utilitarian support is justified by the research focus on investigating the\npattern of interactions between utilitarian-related elements. The retention of ``don't know''\nresponses in the benefit question is justified by the fact that it can help to capture the opin-\nion of people who feel their country has neither benefited nor not benefited from EU mem-\nbership \u00ad and not only those who have no opinion on the issue \u00ad in the absence of such an\noption in the response categories proposed to respondents. The fact that ``don't know''\nresponses represented around 19% of responses in the EU benefit question \u00ad against 6% of\nanswers in the good thing question \u00ad seems to substantiate this. The EU benefit question is\na relatively more precise question than the EU membership3 question. This may accentuate\nthe stress on utilitarian feelings for individuals. Anderson and Smith (2004) thus found that\ncitizens tend to be even more critical of European integration when responding to the EU\nbenefit question.\nThe coding of the dependent variable \u00ad that is to say the regrouping of the middle cate-\ngory with ``not benefited'' responses \u00ad is motivated not only on statistical grounds4 but also\nby the fact that hypotheses primarily aim to analyse whether individual utilitarian and iden-\ntity reasons explain or not people's support for the EU. ``Don't know'' answers in the bene-\nfit question were also found to express lack of support for the EU (Anderson and Smith,\n2004). The four models presented here were also tested without ``don't know'' responses in\nthe dependent variable and similar results were obtained.\nAs far as independent variables are concerned, subjective personal financial situation\nevaluation, education, occupation and national identity are used to test the hypotheses.\nSubjective Personal Financial Situation Evaluation \u00ad The following question was used to op-\nerationalize this variable: ``What are your expectations for the year to come, will (next year)\nbe better, the same or worse, when it comes to the financial situation of your household?''\nThe justification for selecting citizens' subjective personal financial situation evaluation\nover the next twelve months (rather than just in the past twelve months) is that respondents\ntend to form their opinion about their personal situation on the present situation and the\nnear future rather than just on the recent past. This question is also useful as it enables the\nrespondent to compare the current year with next year's expectations. Furthermore this\nvariable was available largely across years in the study period, which was not the case for\nthe other type of variables.\nEducation \u00ad Question D8 ``How old were you when you stopped full-time education?'' has\nbeen employed to operationalise the education variable. It incorporates the following\nOccupation \u00ad Question D15a was operationalised as follows. The variable compared middle\nand high managers and professionals (inclusive of employed ones) together (coded 1) versus\nthe rest (shop owners, farmers/fishermen, manual workers, clerks, unemployed, retired or\nunable to work through illness and housewives) (coded 2). The justification for this is that\n3 The EU membership question is as follows: ``Generally speaking, do you think that (OUR COUNTRY)'s mem-\nbership of the European Union is a good thing, a bad thing or neither good nor bad?'' The four models presented\nhere were also tested with the EU membership dependent variable and similar results were obtained.\n4 That is to say, to avoid the problem of empty cells or inadequate expected cell frequencies which would weaken\nthe logistic regression statistical analysis.\nInteractions and EU Support 375\nthe category coded 1 are expected to support EU integration as market liberalization per-\ntaining to European integration offers more opportunities for people with human and\nfinancial capital. The income variable was not available after 2003 and was therefore not\nretained in the present analysis. Nonetheless, the occupation variable partly overlaps with\nthe income variable and also relates to some extent to the financial situation of citizens \u00ad\nthere is a medium correlation between income and occupation (r = .333).\nExclusive National Identity \u00ad Recoded from Eurobarometer question: ``In the near future,\ndo you see yourself as (1) nationality only, (2) nationality and European, (3) European and\nnationality, and (4) European only?'' The value of one was given to respondents with exclu-\nsive national identity (nationality only) and zero for all other categories. This question was\nselected as it is about community and identity (in line with literature) and is available across\nyears.\nIn line with earlier research on public opinion about the EU, the following variables are\ncontrol variables: EU Knowledge, Political Ideology, Age, Gender, Subjective National\nEconomic Performance Evaluation, Incumbent Government Support, Referendum years\nand European Election Years (see Appendix A for the operationalisation of these vari-\nables).\nSelection of statistical tests\nTo test the hypotheses, cross-sectional individual-level data from 1993 to 2006 were pooled.\nAs individual-level data are used, time series problems (that is to say autocorrelation) of\npooled models of panel data are not applicable to the present statistical design, which pools\na series of independent cross-sections (Beck and Katz, 1995). Regression model residual\nmeans for each year and nation were examined so as to neutralise any potential time- or\nnation-specific effects (fixed effects) which would bias parameter estimates.5 The use of\nlogistic regression as the statistical tool for the analysis of EU benefit is determined by the\ndichotomous nature of the dependent variable used. The sample size was adequate to satisfy\nthe objectives of the present analysis (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2001). Models respected all\nregression assumptions.\nResults and Analysis\nThe regression constant is (statistically) significant in all models (see Table 1). The direction\nof the constant coefficient suggests that overall there is a significant drop in EU support in\nthe study period (1993\u00ad2006). Figure 1 confirms this. The coefficients for subjective per-\nsonal financial situation evaluation, education and national identity are (statistically) signifi-\ncant and are in the expected direction. The coefficient for occupation is nevertheless not\nsignificant and shows no influence on EU support. By and large, these results tend to con-\nfirm the results of for example, Carey (2002) and McLaren (2007) that individuals with\nhuman and financial capital, with positive personal economic expectations or with an inclu-\nsive national identity are more supportive of the EU. Our findings also corroborate the\nresults of Hooghe and Marks (2004) and Citrin and Sides (2004) that exclusive national\nidentity explains more citizens' opposition to the EU than economic utilitarianism. How\n5 Residual means for each nation and year were all close to zero. Regression model results are valid across nations\nand years.\neach component of the utilitarian theory interacts with one another to shape public opinion\non integration and how utilitarianism mediates the relationship between national identity\nand EU support will now be examined.\nTesting of hypotheses\nFor each interaction term, constitutive terms6 are all included in the model specification as\nrecommended by Brambor, Clark and Golder (2006). The coefficient for the interaction var-\niable between occupation and education is (statistically) significant but is not in the\nexpected direction (see Table 1, Model 1). The results on the two-way interaction effects\ncannot though be interpreted as unconditional marginal effects as they only capture the\neffect of education on EU support when the conditioning variable value (occupation) is zero\n(Brambor et al. 2006). To remedy this situation and therefore gauge accurately the nature\nof the marginal effects, we have plotted the significant two-way interaction effects.\nIn view of the difference in line slopes in Figure 2, hypothesis HI\nis supported. Therefore\noccupation mediates the relationship between EU support and education. Citizens in\nhigher occupations with a lower education are more supportive of integration than those in\nlower occupations with a higher education. Figure 2 also shows that individuals in lower\noccupations with a lower education are more supportive of integration than those in lower\noccupations with a higher education. It reveals that citizens in higher occupations with a\nhigher education are only marginally more supportive of the EU than those in higher occu-\npations with a lower education. These results indicate that occupational skills are likely to\nbe considered by EU nationals to some extent as a buffer against job insecurity associated\nyear\nEU Benefit Evaluation\nNotes: The higher the figure, the more citizens think that their country has on balance benefited from\nbeing a member of the European Union.

Job-related skills may be seen by citizens as facilitating\nlabour mobility within the EU but also more generally as helping them to withstand in some\nmeasure the greater job competition that market liberalisation has entailed. Individuals in\nlower occupations with a higher education are however generally dissatisfied with their job\n(see for example, Robst, 2008 and Chevalier, 2003) and may partly hold the process of\nmarket liberalisation relating to integration responsible for this. Citizens in lower occupa-\ntions with a lower education are less likely to be dissatisfied with their job and are therefore\nlikely to be less reticent towards integration. Their lower education can also denote a lack\nof knowledge about the EU which can neutralise any potential negative opinions about\nintegration.\nThe coefficients for the interaction variable between education and personal economic\nexpectations and between occupation and personal economic expectations are not (statisti-\ncally) significant (see Table 1, Models 2 and 3). The related coefficients are though in the\nexpected direction. In view of the non- (statistical) significance of the coefficients for these\ninteraction variables, hypotheses HII\nand HIII\nare not supported. Therefore the impact of\nfuture personal financial expectations on EU support is not conditioned by education or\noccupation. Citizens with a lower education (or in lower occupations) who have better\nexpectations about the financial situation of their household in the next twelve months are\nnot more supportive of integration than those with a higher education (or in higher\noccupations) who have worse expectations. Citizens' future personal financial expectations\ninfluence EU support regardless of education and occupation.\nThe coefficient for the interaction variable between national identity and personal eco-\nnomic expectations is not (statistically) significant (see Table 1, Model 4). The related coeffi-\ncient is nevertheless in the expected direction. Given the non- (statistical) significance of the\ncoefficient for this interaction variable, hypothesis HIV\nis not supported. Therefore the\nimpact of national identity on EU support is not mediated by personal economic pessi-\nmism/optimism. This may be so as an individual does not let personal economic expecta-\ntions (especially short-term, transient expectations) impinge on his/her affective link\ntowards the nation (or towards the nation and the EU \u00ad inclusive national identity). The\ncitizen's emotional connection towards the nation (or towards the nation and the EU) is\ndeep-rooted and durable. Previous research (see for example, Schild and Hessel, 2010;\nGramacho and llamazares, 2005) has moreover found that socio-tropic utility calculations\nabout the EU were found to explain opinions on the EU more powerfully than personal\nutility calculations. This result is also a further confirmation that exclusive or inclusive\nnational identity is a more important contributor to the explanation of EU support than\neconomic utilitarianism.\nConclusion\nThe results of this analysis expand the public opinion literature on European integration by\nshowing how individuals' education and occupation interact with one another to influence\npublic attitudes towards the EU. More specifically, the findings in this paper demonstrate\nthat occupation arbitrates the relationship between education and EU support. Occupational\nskills somewhat emerge as a more important vector of support for the EU than a higher\neducation as the former are likely to be considered by EU citizens as a relatively stronger\ndefence against the greater job uncertainty associated with European market liberalisation.\nEducation and occupation are not found to arbitrate the relationship between short-term\npersonal financial expectations and EU support. Citizens' short-term personal economic\noptimism (or pessimism) therefore influence EU support irrespective of occupational and\neducational differences. Individuals' short-term personal economic expectations are also not\nfound to condition the relationship between EU support and feelings of national identity.\nIn other words, these expectations do not alter the relationship between citizens' feelings of\nnational identity and EU support. Citizens' affective attachment towards the nation (or\ntowards the nation and the EU) is therefore proving particularly entrenched and enduring.\nThe political implications of this research are that EU and national policy-makers should\nfurther pursue policies that aim to continually raise the educational but even more\nimportantly occupational profile of citizens. These policies are likely to help citizens combat\nthe perceived job insecurity pertaining to European market liberalisation and take advan-\ntage of the opportunities arising as a result of it. The continued viability of these policies is\nthough dependent on the presence of opportunities stemming from a positive economic cli-\nmate. EU and national policy-makers have a role to play in trying to stimulate citizens'\npositive financial expectations as these are likely to have a positive effect on EU support\nregardless of occupational and educational differences.\nAnother political implication is that citizens' personal economic optimism is ineffective to\nreverse the negative impact of citizens' feelings of exclusive national identity on EU sup-\nport. It is therefore important that national and EU policy-makers work towards flexible\nmodes of integration7 that ensure a greater compatibility between national identities and a\nEuropean identity and thus give some satisfaction to as many national publics as possible.\nIt is also about fostering a European identity that is not portrayed as threatening national\nidentities and capitalise on what is common to all national identities. The denial of the\nChristian heritage in the European constitution and the potential entry of Turkey in the\nEU may be in this respect particularly damaging to the popularity of the EU among\nnational publics.\nThe denial of the Christian heritage in the European constitution may well be perceived\nby citizens as a threat to their national identity, not only in countries where Christianism is\nrecognised as the religion of the state but also in other EU nations.8 The potential entry of\nTurkey in the EU is also generating significant concerns among national publics as Turkey\nis considered as an identity threat as well as a threat to the economy and society of member\nstates and the EU (Eurobarometer 66, Autunm 2006). In view of the growing unpopularity\nof the EU, can national and EU decision-makers really afford to ignore these significant\npopular concerns?\nReferences\nAnderson, C.J. and Reichert, M.S. (1996).
