Most cases\nof acute pancreatitis are mild and resolve\nspontaneously (or following supporting\ntreatments) without complications.

Damage to the pancreas in acute\npancreatitis and the intensity of the organ-\nism response (i.e., the acute-phase response)\nis accompanied by a substantial increase in\nthe serum CRP level, which is the most\nsignificant reactant in this response, as a\nresult of hepatocyte stimulation by cyto-\nkines. In acute inflammation, CRP levels\nImproved knowledge of the roles of\ncytokines has increased understanding of\nthe pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.\nWhite adipose tissue is a multifunctional\norgan that releases protein signals and fac-\ntors such as leptin, adiponectin, resistin,\nghrelin and apelin on a vast scale.9\nChanges in the function and quantity of\nthese proteins plays a role in the pathogen-\nesis and progress of inflammation, inflam-\nmatory response, insulin resistance and\nmetabolic syndrome.10 Resistin is a newly\nidentified peptide hormone, secreted specif-\nically by adipocytes,11 that can cause obesity\nand hypertriglyceridaemia, due to its asso-\nciation with insulin resistance.12,13 Studies\nhave revealed that resistin is also an import-\nant cytokine in inflammatory reactions, and\nin the regulation of other cytokines.14\u00ad16\nThe aim of the present study was to assess\nthe effectiveness of resistin in predicting the\nseverity of acute pancreatitis, and to com-\npare resistin with CRP in predicting the\nseverity of acute pancreatitis.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis prospective observational study\nincluded patients with acute pancreatitis\nwho presented to the Gastroenterology\nClinic of Erzurum Education and Research\nHospital, Erzurum, Turkey, between\nPatients whose diagnoses were verified\nthrough clinic and laboratory findings, and\nwho met the criteria for study inclusion,\nwere sequentially enrolled.\nInclusion criteria for the study com-\nprised the presence of clinical findings,\ntypical history, body mass index (BMI)\nbetween 20 and 25, a more than three-fold\nincrease in serum amylase and lipase\nvalues, and verification of the monitoring\nmethods. Exclusion criteria included iron\ndeficiency anaemia, renal failure, liver dis-\nease, chronic pancreatitis, a second or later\npancreatitis attack, symptoms lasting >3\ndays prior to admission, and a diagnosis\nthat was not verified through monitoring\nmethods.\nUpper abdominal ultrasonography was\nconducted on admission, and computed\ntomography (CT) was performed on day 4\nor 5 following admission. Biochemical par-\nameters were assessed using two different\nblood samples taken within the first 2 h\nfollowing presentation and at a time\nbetween the first 2 and 72 h, based on\nwhen the patient was admitted to hospital.\nEach patient's age, sex and reason for\nhospital admission were recorded.\nEach patient was evaluated by monitor-\ning with the Balthazar CT rating system and\nCT severity index, and pancreatic necrosis\nassessment. The patients were divided into\ntwo groups based on the Atlanta classifica-\ntion.17 The first group included patients\nwithout complications (mild acute pancrea-\ntitis); the second group included patients\nwith one or several organ failures (moderate\nor severe acute pancreatitis).\nApproval for the study was obtained\nfrom the Ethical Committee of Erzurum\nRegional Education and Research Hospital.\nAll patients participating in the study pro-\nvided written informed consent.\nBlood samples and tests\nBlood samples were collected from each\npatient a total of four times: on admission\nwas drawn into heparin-treated tubes by\nvenepuncture and, within 1.5 h following\ncollection, a 5-ml portion of the sample\n25C. The plasma was then collected and\nstored at \u00c080C prior to analysis. All\nplasma samples were analysed within 12\nmonths. For routine blood parameter\nmeasurements, blood samples were col-\nlected into tubes containing ethylenediami-\nnetetra-acetic acid to prevent clotting.\nComplete blood counts (white blood cell\n[WBC] and haematocrit), CRP and resistin\nlevels, and routine examination results for\naspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine\naminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phos-\nphatase (ALP), g-glutamyltransferase\n(g-GT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bili-\nrubin, amylase, blood urea nitrogen, cre-\natinine, Na, K, calcium and glucose were\nobtained.\nWhite blood cell and thrombocyte counts\nwere measured automatically using standard\nmethods with a Coulter\u00d5 LH 780 analyser\n(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).\nAmylase, lipase, albumin, creatinine, LDH,\nAST, ALT, glucose, ALP, g-GT, and bili-\nrubin values were determined using photo-\nmetric methods with a Roche PP800\nautoanalyser (Roche Diagnostics,\nIndianapolis, IN, USA) in the routine bio-\nchemistry laboratory of Erzurum Education\nand Research Hospital. CRP levels were\nmeasured nephelometrically using a\nBeckman Coulter IMAGE\u00d5 800 system.\nPlasma resistin levels were measured\nusing a human resistin ELISA (Catalogue\nLaboratorni Medicina a.s., Bmo, Czech\nRepublic), according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions.\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as n patient incidence,\nmean (range) or mean \u00c6 SD. Kolmogorov\u00ad\nSmirnov test was used to assess normality of\nthe data. Between-group comparisons of\nserum resistin values were performed using\nMann\u00adWhitney U-test, as the serum resistin\nvalues did not show normal distribution.\nThe association between categorical vari-\nables was assessed using 2-test or Fisher's\nexact test. Receiver operating curves (ROC)\nwere drawn in order to determine the opti-\nmum cut-off points to reach high sensitivity\nand specificity values. The area under the\ncurve (AUC) was calculated using the 95%\nconfidence interval (CI). All analyses were\ntwo-tailed and performed using SPSS\u00d5 soft-\nware, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA). A P-value < 0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nThe present study included 59 patients with\nacute pancreatitis (37 with mild acute pan-\ncreatitis; 22 with moderate or severe acute\npancreatitis, based on the Atlanta classifica-\ntion17).

CRP is able to differenti-\nate between mild and severe acute\npancreatitis with high precision, and to\npredict the development of severe acute\npancreatitis even at 24 h following hospital\nadmission.20\u00ad22 However, very few studies\nhave examined the power of CRP for pre-\ndicting pancreatic necrosis.23 Patients with\nCRP levels > 150 mg/l on admission to the\nemergency unit and on transfer to the\nintensive care unit have been shown to\nhave significantly and independently worse\noutcomes that those with lower CRP\nperiod before CRP levels increase, which\nlimits its utility as an early predictor of\nseverity, CRP remains a useful predictor\nThe main problem in managing acute\npancreatitis is the lack of availability of\nconvenient indicators or scoring systems for\npredicting severity and necrosis in the first\nhours of the disease, although many indica-\ntors have been researched in this\nwhich contains adiponectin, leptin, resistin\nand visfatin, may help to resolve this\nTable 2.

Resistin and visfatin are hormones\nthat are synthesized in neutrophils, macro-\nphages, bone marrow, and fat tissue and can\nincrease proinflammatory cytokine\nAdipose tissue is thought to be part of the\nendocrine system, and to play a role in the\npathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.\nPeripancreatic adipose tissue necrosis can\nlead to intense cytokine release (interleukin\n[IL]-1, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-a) and\nadipokines can play a role in multiorgan\nfailure and systemic changes.27,28 The early\nincrease in adipocyte-induced indicators can\nbe an important predictor of the clinical\nprogress of acute pancreatitis.29 Obesity is\nconsidered an independent risk factor for\nthe development of severe acute\npancreatitis.30,31 Resistin may be a causative\nfactor of obesity and hypertriglyceridemia,\ndue to its association with insulin\nA relationship between acute pancreatitis\nand adipokines was shown by a study\nreporting significantly higher serum leptin\nlevels in patients with acute pancreatitis and\nan animal model of acute pancreatitis,\ncompared with control groups.32 A study\nthat investigated resistin levels in the pan-\ncreatic tissue of rats with acute pancreatitis\nrevealed a correlation between the resistin\nlevel and disease-related tissue damage,30\nand also showed that the CRP level was\nassociated with disease severity.30 Another\nstudy revealed that resistin levels were sig-\nnificantly higher in patients with acute\nFigure 1.

These\nresults34 suggest that there is a significant\ncorrelation between resistin levels and sever-\nity of disease, intervention requirements,\nmorbidity and mortality; such findings con-\ncurred with another acute pancreatitis\nstudy,35 in which resistin levels were signifi-\ncantly higher at hospital admission, and on\nday 3 following admission, compared with\ncontrols. Resistin levels were increased on\nday 5 compared with day 3, and a significant\ncorrelation was found between the CRP and\nIn the present study, resistin levels were\nsignificantly different between patients with\nmild acute pancreatitis and those with mod-\nerate or severe acute pancreatitis at admis-\nsion and on days 1, 3 and 7 following\nadmission. Likewise, in patients with mild\nacute pancreatitis, resistin levels remained\nrelatively stable during the 7-day study\nperiod, whereas in the moderate/severe\nacute pancreatitis group, resistin levels grad-\nually increased. The present study revealed\nthat day 3 resistin levels provided improved\nprediction for severe pancreatitis compared\nFigure 2.

In addition, day 3 resistin levels provided\na better prediction of necrosis development\ncompared with day 3 CRP levels. Published\nstudies have shown that day 3 resistin levels\nwere similar to CRP in predicting severe\npancreatitis, in contrast to previous predic-\ntions of necrosis.34,35 One reason for this\ndifference may be due to the large number of\npatients with severe pancreatitis in the pre-\nviously published studies compared with the\npresent study. In the present study, the cut-\noff value was determined to be 19.5 ng/ml\n(93% sensitivity, 70% specificity) for severe\npancreatitis.\nIncreases in adipose tissue due to obesity\nincreases the complexity of acute pancrea-\ntitis, for example, obesity can lead to an\nincrease in local complications, organ failure\nand mortality risk.36 Fat necrosis cannot be\nassessed with CT because fat tissue does not\nhold contrast. Therefore, there is a clear\nneed for methods other than CT that are\nmore effective, usable, economical, and have\nvery few side-effects, for the early determin-\nation of peripancreatic fat necrosis in par-\nticular. Resistin may be a useful marker as\nan indirect indicator of adipose tissue necro-\nsis and predictor for the severity of acute\npancreatitis. However, the present study is\nlimited by the relatively small sample size\nand further randomized, controlled studies\nthat include a larger patient group are\nrequired to validate these results.\nIn conclusion, resistin may represent a\nnew, inexpensive and effective indicator for\npredicting the severity of acute pancreatitis\nand presence of necrosis, and thus the\nhospitalization period, disease management,\nand early endoscopic, percutaneous or sur-\ngical intervention requirements in patients\nwith acute pancreatitis.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
