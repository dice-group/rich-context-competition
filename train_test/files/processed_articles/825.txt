    "abstract": "Abstract: In 1993 half of all small businesses (fewer than fifty workers) sponsored a health plan for\ntheir employees, up from 41 percent in 1989. While not as deep, the benefits offered by small firms\nare nearly as broad as benefits offered by large firms, and they have expanded since 1989. Small\nbusinesses pay more for coverage, however. Although coverage restrictions based on health status and\npreexisting conditions are a significant concern of small firms, actual limits of this type in the\nsmall-group market are modest. Firms not offering insurance report that they have wide access to\ncoverage, and many would sponsor a plan if only prices were lower.\nRecent efforts to reform the health insurance market have focused on\nemployers and their coverage of workers. It is more correct, however,\nto say that these efforts were targeted at small businesses, because a\nlarge percentage of the uninsured are associated with small businesses.\nEstimates from the March 1993 Current Population Survey (CPS) indicate\nthat 37 percent of the uninsured work for a firm employing fewer than\ntwenty-five workers that does not provide insurance, and 14 percent of the\nuninsured work for such a firm having twenty-five to ninety-nine workers.1\nMuch about the market for health insurance among small firms remains\npoorly understood. The purpose of this DataWatch is to build on the existing\nliterature and present findings from a new survey of small employers.\nData and methods. The information presented here on the health\nbenefits offered by small businesses comes from a survey we conducted in\nspring 1993. During April and May of that year, National Research, Inc., a\nsurvey research firm in Washington, D.C., conducted telephone interviews\nwith 750 small businesses employing fewer than fifty workers. The sample\nof firms was drawn randomly from the Dun and Bradstreet list of the\nnation's private employers, after stratification by size and location. This list\nis representative of firms that have applied for a loan at some point and on\nwhich a credit check has been conducted. As such, it may underrepresent\nMichael Morrisey is professor and director of the Lister Hill Center for Health Policy at the\nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham.

This response rate of\n44 percent is typical of small-business surveys.3\nTo produce nationally representative estimates, we weighted responses\nby size and region in accordance with the probability of selection into the\nsample. Our focus here is on employers, although in some instances we\npresent statistics on employees. The margin of error for estimates made from\nour 1993 survey is approximately plus or minus four percentage points.\nWe also draw on data from the Health Insurance Association of Amer-\nica's (HIAA's) annual employer surveys conducted each spring, 1989--\n1992. We restrict our focus with these data to employers, other than units\nof government, that employed fewer than fifty workers at the time they\nsample of private employers from Dun and Bradstreet's nationwide list of\nfirms--the same sampling frame we used. We exploit these commonalties\nto examine the trend in coverage among small firms over the past five years.\nAs with our 1993 data, we weight firms' responses to these HIAA surveys to\nproduce nationally representative estimates for each year that reflect the\nentire population of small firms with fewer than fifty workers.4\nWho Offers Coverage?\nHalf (51 percent) of small businesses offered health insurance in 1993.\nThis is strongly related to firm size (Exhibit 1). Among firms with twenty-\nfive to forty-nine workers, 85 percent provided insurance coverage, a preva-\nlence rate approaching that of medium and large employers. In contrast,\nfirms with fewer than ten workers were more likely not to offer coverage;\neven among this group, however, 44 percent provided insurance. Thus, as\nearlier studies have found, mostly very small firms do not provide coverage.5\nLack of coverage is also related to corporate status and location. Nearly\ntwice as many incorporated firms as unincorporated firms provided health\ninsurance coverage. Unincorporated firms accounted for 40 percent of all\nfirms and 27 percent of all employers in our sampling frame. Small busi-\nnesses in rural areas, which employ a third of all workers in small businesses\nnationwide, were less likely than small businesses in urban areas to offer\ncoverage (43 percent versus 54 percent).\nsteadily since then. At first this appears to be inconsistent with CPS data,\nwhich indicate the opposite.6 Our results may not be inconsistent, however.\nFirst, in fall 1990 the economy slipped into recession and unemployment\nincreased, largely because firms cut their work forces.7 Firms that did so\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

These factors would not suggest that fewer small firms\nare now offering health insurance. Since 1989 spells of unemployment and\ncomplete withdrawal from the labor force have become more common\namong the nonelderly population.8 These changes in the labor market have\ncontributed to an increase in the uninsured population but would not\nnecessarily affect the proportion of small firms providing coverage.\nIn addition, since 1989 the composition of the labor force has shifted\nmore toward part-time workers, who are far less likely to receive employer-\nsponsored coverage. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that be-\neconomy. At the same time, there was an increase of 894,000 part-time\njobs.9 This trend alone can account for an increase of approximately 1.5\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Among small firms that offered insurance\nbenefits, 97 percent indicated that full-time employees were eligible. Most\nfirms (85 percent) also covered workers' dependents. However, only 19\npercent of small firms provided coverage for part-time workers. Given the\ntendency of some states' small-firm coverage demonstrations to exclude the\nowner of the firm from coverage, it is important to note that 80 percent of\nsmall firms covered the owner or owners of the business. If owners are\nexcluded, the desirability of a plan is likely to be reduced significantly.\nWhat Sort Of Coverage Do Small Firms Provide?\nMost small businesses with insurance offer a single conventional health\ninsurance plan. Nearly 60 percent offered this and nothing else (Exhibit 2).\nHealth maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider organiza-\ntions (PPOs), and point-of-service plans have made only limited inroads\ninto small firms. Six percent of small firms that offered health insurance\ncoverage offered an HMO exclusively. Another 10 percent offered a PPO\nonly. The use of HMOs, PPOs, and point-of-service plans generally in-\ncreases with firm size. However, only 2 percent of small employers offered\nmore than one health insurance plan. Those small firms offering multiple\nplans almost without exception had twenty-five or more workers.\nThe benefits provided by small firms are nearly as broad as those provided\nby large firms. Small firms' plans tend to cover the same categories of care,\nfor example. Respondents who knew what their health plan covers reported\nthat 75 percent covered alcohol abuse treatment, 93 percent covered inpa-\ntient mental health care, and 81 percent covered outpatient mental health\nservices.10 Fifty-eight percent of conventional plans offered by small firms\nOptions For Health Insurance In Small Firms, By Firm Size,\nNumber of workers\nConventional only 55%\nHMO only 6\nPoint-of-service only 3\nTwo or more plans 1\nUnknown plan type(s) 25\nAll\nSource: Authors' tabulations of the 1993 Wayne State University/KPMG Peat Marwick Survey of Small Employ-\ners.\nNotes: Percentages may not add to 100 because of rounding.

The services covered by conventional and PPO\nplans offered by small businesses have actually expanded slightly since\ndifferences were not statistically significant. The similarity between cover-\nage offered by large and small firms is consistent with the experience of\nstates in offering \"bare-bones\" insurance coverage to small employers.12\nSmall-firm plans require greater cost sharing than large-firm plans do. In\nconventional plans offered by small firms, for example, the average annual\nfamily.13 The cost-sharing provisions of PPOs were also less generous in\nsmall firms: The average in-plan deductible per person in firms with fewer\nthan fifty workers was $266, and the average out-of-plan deductible was\nmaximum benefits also tended to be somewhat lower in the smallest firms.\nAlthough their coverage is typically not as deep, small firms pay premi-\nums close to those paid by large firms. For conventional plan coverage, for\nexample, small firms paid $187 monthly per individual and $425 per family,\nadjusting for the content of coverage, premiums were not significantly\ndifferent. We compared premiums for plans that had the following charac-\nteristics: a deductible between $100 and $250 per individual, eighty/twenty\ncoinsurance, a stop-loss amount less than $2,000, a prescription drug bene-\nfit, and coverage for several special services, including inpatient and out-\npatient mental health care, alcohol and drug abuse treatment, and occupa-\ntional therapy. Small firms with plans that fit this prototype paid $164 per\nrespectively, in large firms. Premiums (around these averages) also did not\nvary much between small and large firms.14\nWhy Do More Small Firms Not Offer Coverage?\nWe asked those small firms that did not provide health insurance why\nthey did not. Exhibit 3 reports their responses. Not surprisingly, the most\ncommon answer was that premiums were too high.15 Firms with twenty-five\nto forty-nine workers that did not offer insurance were especially likely to\ngive this as an important reason. However, the other answers provide more\ninsight as to why the coverage was not perceived to be worth the premium.\nWe have grouped small firms' responses into three related issues. First is\nfear of having to take away coverage in the future.

However, nearly 80 percent expressed\nconcern that the firm's profits were too variable, and three-quarters said\nthat premium increases were too uncertain. Second, health benefits are not\na high priority among some workers. Nearly 60 percent of responding firms\nindicated that they do not have to offer insurance benefits to attract\nworkers. Fifty-four percent indicated that workers prefer higher wages, and\na nearly identical percentage reported that workers were already covered.\nOne-third of respondents said that employee turnover is too high to war-\nrant providing coverage. Third, just over half of the small firms not offering\ncoverage (especially those with fewer than ten workers) cited administra-\ntive hassles and inability to qualify for group rates as prime concerns.\nSome 17 percent of firms not now offering coverage offered it at some\ntime in the past but no longer do so. Sixty percent of these have done this\nsince 1990. Two-thirds of firms that have dropped coverage blamed their\naction on substantially higher insurance premiums. Still, 45 percent of\nsmall firms that dropped coverage indicated that most of their workers were\ncovered elsewhere, and 28 percent said that their workers preferred higher\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Only 9 percent reported that\ntheir insurer would not renew their policy.\nWould Small Firms Offer Coverage If The Price Were Lower?\nNot surprisingly, the answer to whether small firms would offer insurance\nif the price were lower depends upon the price. We asked small firms that\ndid not offer health insurance what market scenarios would lead them to\nbegin offering coverage to their workers. We described an insurance plan to\nthese firms and offered it at various hypothetical prices. The plan had broad\nconventional coverage with cost-sharing provisions similar to what one\nmight find in a large firm. We told respondents that the plan would cover\nall categories of care, would allow workers to choose any physician, and\nwould entail a $250 annual deductible per person. Forty percent of small\nfirms not now providing benefits said that they would offer this policy to\ntheir workers if it could be purchased for $ 175 per worker per month. If the\nchase the plan, and if it were 50 percent lower ($88), 75 percent would\npurchase it. Overall, this implies a premium elasticity of-0.92.\nThis elasticity is well below that found in econometric studies of insur-\nance demand. Other researchers have found that a 5 percent increase in\nprice resulted in a 10 to 15 percent decrease in the likelihood of purchase;\nthat a 5 percent decrease in the tax subsidy for health insurance would\ndecrease the proportion of firms offering insurance by about 15 percent; and\nthat a 5 percent increase in premiums would reduce the proportion of small\nfirms sponsoring an insurance plan by 13 percent.16\nOn the other hand, these findings are much greater than those implied\nby the evaluations of state subsidy programs for small businesses.17 The\nfindings of these demonstration projects, however, may be biased down-\nward relative to a more general small-firm subsidy for health insurance. It\nhas been observed that small-business owners had little knowledge of the\nplans in the demonstrations, the subsidies were available for only a limited\ntime period, and, in some instances, owners were not eligible for coverage.\nOur survey data on a variety of state initiatives indicate that no more than\n9 percent of small employers in states with such initiatives were aware of\nthem. Further, as noted above, there was a fear that health benefits might\nhave to be withdrawn. If such a fear is sincere, an eighteen-month subsidy\nmay not be sufficient to induce many firms to sponsor insurance coverage.\nIs Health Insurance Available To Small Firms?\nThe previous discussion presumes that small employers can find health\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

It also suggests that small employers would be willing to change\nhealth plans if they could find plans that offered better service and/or lower\npremiums. To address these issues, we asked currently insured and unin-\nsured small firms how often they had been solicited to purchase health\ninsurance in the past six months and whether they had followed up on any\nof these solicitations. More than 75 percent of both insured and uninsured\nsmall firms were solicited for health insurance in the past six months, and\nmore than one-third indicated that they received six or more inquiries.\nThis is consistent with case study work by Catherine McLaughlin, who also\nfound numerous sellers of insurance in the small-group market.18 Thus, it\nwould appear that small firms, for the most part, have ample opportunity to\nobtain coverage or change carriers. Simple regressions on the number of\nsolicitations by firm characteristics found few statistically significant differ-\nences between firms that were solicited and firms that were not. Forty\npercent of currently insured firms and 22 percent of uninsured firms indi-\ncated that they recently had followed up With one or more of these insur-\nance solicitations. Further, at renewal time, one-third of insured small firms\nreported that they had talked to more than one health insurance agent.\nGiven the interest in purchasing cooperatives and health alliances in\nrecent health care reform proposals, we asked small firms whether they had\ninvestigated the option of purchasing health insurance through \"a local\nbusiness association, trade group, employer coalition, or some other group\nof small purchasers.\" Fifty-nine percent of those providing health insurance\nsaid that they had done so. However, only 17 percent indicated that their\ncurrent plan was part of such an organization.\nAre Health Status And Preexisting Conditions Major Issues?\nWe asked small employers that have maintained coverage with a given\ncarrier for two or more years why they have done so: \"Is it because you fear\nthat the current health conditions of some employees or their dependents\nwould not be covered by a new carrier?\" Nearly one-third of respondents\n(32 percent) indicated yes to this query; 64 percent said no. The remaining\n4 percent did not know. Clearly, a sizable number of insured small firms are\nconcerned about the coverage implications of changing carriers.\nMcLaughlin reported that many insurers are unwilling to cover groups\nwith fewer than ten workers and that many exclude specific industries and\nimpose preexisting condition clauses. Wendy Zellers and colleagues re-\nported that two-thirds of the insurance firms they surveyed excluded some\nindustries.19 Indeed, for these reasons state governments have passed legis-\nlation limiting medical underwriting, providing for guaranteed issue, and\nlimiting or eliminating preexisting condition clauses.20\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Among firms not offering health insurance\ncoverage, 39 percent said that \"their inability to qualify for an insurance\ncontract at employer rates\" was a very important factor in not providing\ncoverage. Another 15 percent said that this was a somewhat important\nfactor. \"Inability to qualify\" can stem from a variety of factors. Of those who\ncited this as a somewhat or very important reason for not offering coverage,\nwe asked if this was because \"one or more employees cannot qualify for\ninsurance because of health conditions.\" More than three-quarters (77\npercent) answered no; only 18 percent said yes. Inability to qualify also may\nrelate to the risk classification associated with a particular firm or industry.\nThis too may be related to the real or perceived health status of the firm's\nworkers. However, only 14 percent of those blaming \"inability to qualify\"\nindicated that \"the type of business or industry they are in makes them\nineligible.\"\nFurther, as noted earlier, 17 percent of those not now offering coverage\nsaid that they provided it before but no longer do. Of these firms, 60 percent\ndropped their plan since 1990. When asked if an insurer's refusal to renew\nwas a reason for dropping coverage, only 9 percent indicated that it was.\nOnly 3 percent indicated that the inability of one or more employees to\nqualify was a reason.\nA second healtlvrelated reason for not changing health insurance carri-\ners has to do with waiting periods and preexisting condition clauses.

From our 1993\nsurvey of firms with fewer than fifty workers, we draw seven conclusions.\n(1) Many small employers do offer health insurance (51 percent, on aver-\nage). More importantly, the prevalence rises sharply with firm size. A firm\nwith twenty-five or more workers has a better than eight in ten chance of\nproviding health insurance to its workers. Corporate status also is related to\nwhether a small business provides coverage. If a firm is incorporated, the\nchances are about six in ten that it provides insurance. (2) The coverage\noffered by small employers is similar to that offered by larger employers. The\nbenefits are relatively broad but are not as deep as benefits in larger firms\ntend to be. Lifetime maximum benefits tend to be consistently lower in\nsmall firms. Small firms tend to pay premiums equivalent to those paid by\nlarger firms but face greater cost sharing.\n(3) Managed care has made inroads into the small-group market: Nearly\n25 percent of small firms offer such a plan. However, only 2 percent offer a\nchoice of health plans. To the extent that managed care plans promote\ncost- effective use of medical services, they do limit claims costs. Further,\nthe deductibles in small firms' conventional insurance plans are higher.\nThis, too, tends to reduce the use of medical services. (4) Firms that do not\noffer coverage tend not to do so for three reasons: They fear that they will\nhave to take benefits away in the future; they perceive health insurance as\nnot being a high priority; and they perceive health insurance coverage as\npresenting significant administrative hassles.\n(5) Small firms are price-sensitive with respect to health insurance. A 10\npercent reduction in premiums, based upon our survey, should lead to a 10\npercent increase in insurance provision. However, given small firms' fear of\nhaving to take back coverage, it is likely that any subsidies would have to be\nof long-term duration. (6) Health insurance is widely available to small\nfirms. They are routinely approached by health insurance agents, and they\noften follow up on these solicitations. A majority of small firms have\ninvestigated employer cooperatives, trade associations, or employer coali-\ntions as sources of health insurance. However, only 17 percent obtain their\ninsurance through such a group. (7) There is a significant fear that health-\nrelated eligibility conditions and preexisting conditions will prevent a firm\nfrom changing its insurance plan. However, the actual extent of these\nlimitations is rather modest. In the small-group market the typical preexist-\ning condition clause is well under one year, and few firms report that\nworkers or dependents have been denied coverage because of poor health.\nEven fewer report that they have been denied group coverage because of\nthe poor health status of one or more of their workers or dependents.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

What one imagines one would\ndo and what one actually does may be quite different. Further, small firms\nmay not be fully informed as to the details of their coverage and the nature\nof the local insurance market. Nonetheless, the survey provides insight into\nthe current state of insurance among small employers.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from The Robert WoodJohnson Foundation\nNOTES\n1.
