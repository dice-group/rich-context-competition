    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study examines the prevalence, and the socioeconomic and demographic determinants of under-five mortality in Benue\nState, Nigeria. Using a purposive random sampling technique, a total of 1,500 questionnaires were administered to women\naged 15 to 49 years and who have ever given birth in 30 communities from 10 sampled local government areas in the state.\nIn addition, focus group discussions and key informant interviews formed sources of data for this research. The analysis\nof data was carried out using descriptive statistics, child survival analysis, and probit regression model. The pattern of the\nprevalence of infant and child mortality showed that there are three major child killers in the study area: malaria (38.2%),\ncomplications at birth (29.5%), and measles (16.9%). The survival probability results show that children born to parents\nliving in an urban area have more chances (72.6%) of survival, as against 71.4% for children born to parents living in a rural\narea. The probit regression analysis showed that the pregnancies ever had by the mothers has a greater marginal effect on\nchild survival (6.7%) than the current age of mothers at birth (3.7%) and the age of mother at marriage (0.9%). Based on the\nfindings, recommendations such as empowerment and education of mothers are suggested.\n",

In the highly developed\neconomies, with advanced medical technologies, sufficient\ndiets, and adequate public sanitation, the U5 mortality rates\ntend to be quite low (below 5 per 1,000). In contrast, within\nthe less developed countries, with the disadvantages of poor\ndiet, limited access to medical technology, and other prob-\nlems of poverty and public sanitation, the rates tend to be as\nrate is highest in Africa and Asia, while the lowest rates are\nin North America and Western and Northern European coun-\nNations Development Programme [UNDP], 2005; WHO,\n2010).

Indeed, Nigeria, which\naccounts for about 2.3% of the global population, bore a\nproportionally higher U5 death burden than even India,\nNigeria has one of the highest child mortality rates in the\nworld, recent data from the United Nations sources show\nlive births. Infant mortality rate is 88 per 1,000 live births,\nand neonatal mortality rate, 40 per 1,000 live births, with a\nconcurrent increase in the number of live births. The low\nrate of decline is a major cause for concern. With this cur-\nrent rate, Nigeria is not on track in meeting UN MDG's\nexpected rate of 4.5% annual decline, to reach a target of 64\nThese are aggregate values, but most importantly, infant\nand child mortality rates in Nigeria vary spatially among\nthe geopolitical zones of the country and between rural and\nurban residence. The values include Northeast (222 per\n1,000 live births), which recorded the highest U5 mortality\nrate among the geopolitical zones. U5 mortality was higher\nareas. One of the striking features of the mortality pattern\nis the consistently high mortality rates in the northern part\nof Nigeria (Aigbe & Zamu, 2012; National Population\nCommission [NPC], 2009). Most of such studies on the\npatterns and determinants of early childhood mortality in\nNigeria have been at aggregate levels geopolitical zones\nwhile neglecting the critical influence of community-level\nvariables and small area variations (Salau et al., 2006). In\nNigeria, for instance, studies on mortality among children\nwere conducted in eastern and south western parts of the\ncountry using secondary data, but the results were used to\nmake generalizations in respect of childhood mortality for\nthe nation as a whole. Such studies, among others, include\nLawoyin (2001); Antai, Ghilagaber, Wedren, Macassa, and\nand Mojekwu (2012). Such generalizations, according to\nPremananda et al. (2004) and Overseas Development\nInstitute (2010), can be misleading as there is ample evi-\ndence that infant and child mortality tends to follow con-\ntours of social and economic progress across and within\ncommunities in the country.\nIt becomes imperative, therefore, for researches on the\nprevalence and determinants of early childhood mortality to\nbe conducted using community-level and small area varia-\ntion data (Salau et al., 2006). Such research will help in the\ndesign and implementation of policies and interventions to\nlower disparities and achieve mortality decline nationwide. It\nis on this premise that such a community-level study is\nimportant in Benue State where dearth of studies on preva-\nlence and determinants of U5 mortality exist.\nMaterials and Method\nThe Study Area\nThe study area, Benue State, lies between latitudes 6\u00b030 and\n10\u00b0E of the Greenwich Meridian. It is surrounded by six\nstates, namely, Nassarawa to the north, Taraba to the north-\neast, Cross River and Ebonyi to the south, Enugu to the\nsouthwest, and Kogi to the west. There is also a short inter-\nnational boundary between the state and the Republic of\nCameroun along Nigeria's southeast border. Benue State is\nmade up of 23 local government areas (LGAs); 14 and 9 of\nthese LGAs correspond with the ethnic territory of the Tiv\nand Idoma people, respectively. Figure 1 shows the 23 LGAs\nthat make up the state.\nWith a population figure of more than four million inhab-\nfemales, the state has a sex ratio of 1.02, a literacy rate of\n44.7% among the population aged 6 years and above, and a\npopulation density of about 130 persons per square kilometer\nthree major ethnic groups inhabiting the state. The Tiv form\nabout two thirds of the population and are found in 14 of the\n23 LGAs. The Idomas and the Igedes occupy the remaining\n9 LGAs. Other ethnic groups include the Etulo, who are\nmainly found in Katsina Ala and Buruku LGAs, the Afia in\nAdo, the Nyifon in Buruku, and the Jukuns in Makurdi and\nGuma LGAs.\nAbu et al. 3\nTheoretical Framework\nThis study is based on the model of the factors of infant and\nchild mortality developed by Mosley and Chen (1984)\nand modified by Casterline, Cooksey, and Ismail (1989) and\nBryman and Cramer (1990). This model assumes that death\nis the final biological expression of a process that is deter-\nmined basically by the economic, demographic, and social\nstructure of any area. These determinants of infant and child\nmortality, which this study examined according to the model\ncategories by Mosley and Chen, are as follows: (a) the socio-\neconomic characteristics such as mother's education, occu-\npation, residence, resources of the household, income of the\nmother, and medical care; (b) the intervening or housing con-\nditions or environmental variables such as source of water,\ntoilet facilities, and distance from home to the nearest health\nfacility; and (c) the demographic variables such as age of\nmother at childbirth, birth order, previous birth interval,\nbreastfeeding, and sex of the child. This study therefore uses\nthe model by Mosley and Chen to appraise how these socio-\neconomic and demographic factors influence childhood mor-\ntality in Benue State, Nigeria.\nThe Selection of Sample Population\nIn the selection of the sample population, the following steps\nwere adopted. First, Makurdi LGA, the LGA that houses the\nseat of administration and power in the state, was purpo-\nsively selected. Thereafter, using simple random sampling,\nthree LGAs were selected from each of the three geopolitical\nzones in the state, thereby giving each of the LGAs in each of\nthe geopolitical zones in the state an equal opportunity of\nbeing selected for the study. From the 10 LGAs so selected,\nthree communities were randomly selected for the study, giv-\ning a total of 30 communities. Finally, from each of the 30\n(the prime reproductive cohort of the population) who had\never married and who had given birth at least once in the past\n5 years preceding the survey, irrespective of place and out-\ncome of delivery, and who are residents (at least 1 year) of\nsuch communities were, also, randomly selected, ensuring a\nfair spread of the respondents across the communities. This\nstudy LGAs, 3 of them are better disposed in terms of health\nfacilities, educational institutions, government offices, daily\nmarketing, and transportation systems, and they are regarded\nas urban LGAs, while the others are rural LGAs. The three\nurban LGAs are Makurdi, Otukpo, and Katsina Ala. The\nsampled LGAs and the list of the sampled communities for\nthe study are presented in Table 1.\nData Collection\nThe data for this study were generated using primary and\nsecondary sources. The primary source of data was through\nquestionnaire administration while the secondary sources\nwere books, journals, official documents, conferences, and\nseminal papers. Copies of the questionnaire were adminis-\nretrieval rate of the questionnaire is shown in Table 2.\nFigure 1. Map of Benue State, Nigeria (ministry of lands and survey, Makurdi).\n4 SAGE Open\nBased on the sensitivity and peculiarities of the items in\nthe questionnaire and the need to give the respondents a\nlevel of confidentiality during the interview, trained female\nresearch assistants (known within the communities), com-\nprising teachers in the primary schools and female health\nworkers within the communities, were used as research\nassistants in data collection. The health officers were\nassigned to supervise the data collection process in each of\nthe sampled LGAs and a coordinator oversees the process\nin each of the senatorial districts. The need for the research\nassistants to understand the local dialects of the communi-\nties was stressed as interpreters were not only likely to\nincrease the bill of data collection but also more likely to\ncause the loss of vital information due to wrong interpreta-\ntion and due to the respondents' unwillingness to release\nvital personal information to a crowd. The issue of under-\nstanding the local dialects of the communities becomes\nimportant as adjoining communities in the same LGA in the\nstate may not understand each other (a peculiarity of the\nMiddle Belt Region that houses about 75% of the ethnic\ngroups in Nigeria).\nData Analyses\nDescriptive statistics as means, percentages, maps, and\ncharts were used to describe the incidence and pattern of\nchildhood mortality in the study area. In addition to these\nstatistical tools, the Child Survival Probability Model was\nused to calculate the chances of child survival and dying.\nThese probabilities were calculated using the following\nequations as outlined by Rajaratnam (2003):\n= i i\nwhere CEB represents the number of children ever born by\nwomen in group i, and FPi\nis the female population in group i;\nand\ni i i\nwhere Di\nis the proportion dead among children ever born to\nwomen in group i, and CDi\nrepresents the total number of\nchildren dead to women in group i.\nTable 2.

The\nprobit regression model, though similar to the multiple\nregression, has an advantage over the latter because of its\ninbuilt mechanism to bring out the marginal probability\neffect of each of the independent variables over the depen-\ndent variable.\nequation is as follows:\nY b b X b X b X b X e\nn n\n= + + + + + + ,\nwhere Y represents the dependent variable (infant and child\nmortality), b0\nis the intercept (constant) that scales the equa-\n, . . . bn\nrepresent the regression coefficients, X1\nto Xn\nstand for the independent variables (socioeconomic vari-\nables, maternal reproductive-related factors, and health seek-\ning behavior of the parents), and e represents the error term.\nResults and Discussion\nAge Differentials of Infant and Child Mortality\nThe results show that the age at which a child dies in the\nstudy area varies from one LGA to the other (inter-LGA vari-\nation). The inter-LGA variations presented in Table 3 show\nthe proportionate contribution of each LGA to the overall\nchild death in the study area with Otukpo, Ado, and Katsina\nAla (in that order) leading the other LGAs in terms of perina-\ntal deaths; Vandeikya, Otukpo, Agatu, and Ado recorded\nhigher statistics of neonatal mortality. The postneonatal mor-\ntality figures are higher in such LGAs as Agatu, Otukpo, and\nGwer East while Makurdi, Guma, and Agatu recorded the\nworst child death statistics in the study area. The explanation\nfor this observed pattern hinges on the availability and acces-\nsibility as well as the readiness on the part of the caregivers\nto patronize the facilities. Furthermore, the referral role\nplayed by such LGAs as Makurdi, Otukpo, and Katsina Ala\nin their respective zones may partly explain the observed pat-\ntern as the process of death, which might have originated in\nthe rural LGAs and might have ended up in these urban\nPattern of Infant and Child Mortality by Causes\nof Death\nThe chances of child survival depend, among others, on the\nprevailing health challenges in the study area. The major\ncauses of child death in the study area include birth compli-\ncations, malaria, diarrhea, measles, HIV/AIDS (through\nmother to child transmission), tetanus, and tuberculosis. The\nprevalence of these challenges varies not only across the\nstudy area but also across the childhood ages as shown on\nTable 3. Age Distribution of Infant and Child Mortality in the Study Area (%).\nAge of child as at death\nBirth to first\nweek\nSecond week\nto 1 month\nSecond month\nyears\nNote. LGA = local government area.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe prevalence of birth complications is outstanding in\nsuch rural LGAs as Ado, Gwer East, Logo, and Vandeikya\nand in the urban LGA of Katsina Ala. Lack of health care\nservices for mothers during pregnancy and birth or the low\nutilization of such services even when available, poor\nhygiene, and little understanding of newborn care are the\nlikely issues responsible for this challenge in the study area.\nMalaria, an infectious disease transmitted by female mosqui-\ntoes, remains a major health problem in the study area as it\nruns through the study area with Otukpo and Agatu LGAs\nhaving the highest prevalence rate. The antimalarial initia-\ntive of the government needs to be given more serious atten-\ntion in the study area. Also, measles, usually spread by\ncontact with nasal or throat secretions of those infected, is\nalso present in all the LGAs with its effects more intense in\nsuch LGAs as Guma, Tarka, and Agatu. Diarrhea is caused\nby the presence of parasites in food and water. Children suc-\ncumb to such parasites more quickly than adults because of\ntheir weak responsive immune system. Diarrhea thrives in\nconditions of poor diet, poor hygiene, and contaminated\nwater. This child killer is seen in all the LGAs with very seri-\nous cases noted in Ado, Guma, Vandeikya, Makurdi, and\nTarka LGAs. In the study area also, HIV/AIDS is usually\ncontacted by babies from their mothers during pregnancy,\nbirth, or breastfeeding, while some were exposed to contami-\nnated needles or blood. Subsequently, Benue State has the\nhighest HIV/AIDS prevalence in the country, which stands at\n(Federal Ministry of Health [FMOH], 2005). Among the\nLGAs in the study area where the HIV/AIDS prevalence is\nnotable are Tarka, Otukpo, Vandeikya, Ado, and Agatu. The\nprevalence of tuberculosis and tetanus in the study area,\ncompared with killer diseases in the study area, is minimal\nbecause of the antenatal and child immunization services.\nHowever, substantial cases of tuberculosis are noted in Logo,\nAdo, Katsina Ala, and Gwer East, while tetanus featured\nmore in Ado, Otukpo, and Vandeikya LGAs.\nApart from the variation in the prevalence of these causes\nof early childhood death across the study area, the age of the\nchild at death also varies with the causes of death because of\nthe age-specific nature of the causes. For instance, as shown\nin Table 5, birth complications and pediatric HIV/AIDS are\nprominent with the perinatal age; tetanus is noted at the neo-\nnatal and perinatal stages, while diarrhea, malaria, and\nTable 4.

On the whole, malaria, measles, complications at\nbirth, and diarrhea (in that order) are the leading causes of\nU5 deaths in the study area. The knowledge of the pattern of\nprevalence of these childhood health challenges in the study\narea is of great importance to health policy formulators.\nThe impact of these death causes on the different LGAs in\nthe study area as reported by our respondents is shown in\nTable 4. The influence of these causes varies among the\nLGAs depending on the level of health infrastructural devel-\nopment. The table shows greater infant deaths through birth\ncomplications, HIV/AIDS (through mother\u00adchild transmis-\nsion), and tetanus. However, the older children die more than\nthe infants through diarrhea, malaria, measles, and tubercu-\nlosis. Invariably, the infants are greater victims of these\ncauses of death (because of the lower immune system) than\nthe older children across the LGAs except in Guma and\nMakurdi LGAs, with Guma LGA recording the sharpest dif-\nference between the two categories of childhood deaths\nwhile the urban LGAs recorded lower childhood deaths than\nthe rural communities across the study area.\nPattern of Child Survival Probability Status in the\nStudy Area\nFrom the discussions on the spatial patterns of infant and child\nmortality in the study area, it is evident that the survival prob-\nability status of the child varies from one LGA to the other,\ndepending, among others, on the age dispensation of the child\nand that of the mothers, the rural\u00adurban residence status, the\nprevalence of the causes of childhood death, and the availabil-\nity or otherwise of facilities to address the health challenges of\nboth the child and that of their mothers. The child survival\nprobability across the LGAs is shown in Table 6.\nThe table shows that Agatu, Makurdi, and Ado (in that\norder) recorded the highest childbirths among the LGAs in\nthe study area. This may not be unconnected with the fact\nthat these three LGAs are part of the senatorial district noted\nin the past for the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence not only in\nthe state but also nationwide. Furthermore, the prevalence of\nmalaria and measles among the three LGAs may also con-\ntribute to their position in terms of child deaths among the\nThe probability of a child dying is highest inAdo, Otukpo,\nand Agatu LGAs. These LGAs, by implication, experience\nthe lowest probability of child survival in the study area. Two\nof the LGAs (Otukpo and Agatu), for instance, top all the\nothers in malaria prevalence. Makurdi LGA recorded the\nhighest probability of child survival among the LGAs of\nstudy for obvious reasons of being the LGA that houses the\nseat of state administration as well as the LGA with the best\nnetwork of health and other social amenities. On the whole,\nthe female child has a higher probability of survival than her\nmale counterpart. The results also show that a child born to\nparents living in the urban LGAs, on the average, has a\nhigher survival probability (72.6%) than his or her counter-\nparts whose parents reside in the rural LGAs (71.4%). This is\nbecause of the preponderance of child survival programs in\nthe urban rather than in the rural LGAs. Quite a number of\nchild deaths in the urban LGAs were actually from the rural\nLGAs in attempts by rural parents taking advantage of the\nreferral health facilities in the urban areas.\nProbit Regression Analysis of the Determinants of\nInfant and Child Mortality in the Study Area\nIn an attempt to bring out the list of the most influential\ndeterminants of early childhood mortality, their strength and\nmarginal effect on the incidence of infant and child mortality\nin the study area, all the independent variables (maternal\nreproductive-related variables, socioeconomic, and the\nhealth seeking behavior of the parents) were subjected to the\nprobit regression analysis. The result of the analysis, pre-\nsented in Table 7, showed the list of independent variables\nTable 6. Probability of Child Survival in the LGAs Across the Study Area.\nLGA\nNo. of\nmothers\nChildren ever born\nChildren ever\ndead M CEB M CED\nProbability of\nchild dying\nProbability of\nchild survival\nNote. LGA = local government area; CEB = children ever born; CED = children ever dead; M = male; F = female; T = total.\n8 SAGE Open\nconsidered to be of greater relevance to the incidence of\nchild survival in the study area. This result has an adjusted R2\nand child mortality in the study area is explained by the\nmodel. Among the maternal reproductive-related variables,\nthe age of the mothers, the age at marriage, and the number\nof pregnancies ever had were considered more relevant by\nthe model than the other considerations within the group as\nthe other factors, more or less, depend on these three. The\nlevel of education of the mothers, the paternal employment\nstatus, the size of the households, the type of living houses,\nand the locality of residence of parents featured so promi-\nnently among the socioeconomic factors while the variables\nfrom the health seeking behavior of the parents include visit\nto the antenatal clinic, ownership of the facilities patronized\nduring pregnancy as antenatal clinic, the length of breast-\nfeeding by the mothers, and the immunization status of the\nchild. The values of the probit regression coefficients suggest\nthat infant immunization (.991), pregnancies ever had by the\nmore critical to predicting the incidence of infant and child\nmortality in the study area than the other variables.\nHowever, the marginal probability effect of the indepen-\ndent variables on the incidence of early childhood mortality\nis greater for such variables as living houses (46.9%) and\nmaternal educational groups (30.1%) than that for the other\nvariables. This implies that aggressive policies on housing\nand female child education will go a long way to enhancing\nthe child survival status in the study area.\nThe regression results in Table 6 also shows that with ref-\nerence to mothers aged 15 to 19, a unit increase in the age of\nthe mothers, all things being equal, results in a corresponding\ndecrease of the probability of a child dying by about 3.7%.\nConversely, a unit reduction in the age of the mothers, all\nthings being equal, amounts to a corresponding reduction of\nthe probability of a child surviving by the same percentage.\nTable 7. Probit Regression Analysis of the Determinants of U5 Mortality in the Study Area.\nS/No. Variables\nRegression\ncoefficient\nMarginal\neffect t\niii Ownership of ANC patronized: community -- -- --\nNote. JSS = junior secondary school; SSS = senior secondary school; NCE = National Certificate on Education; ND/OND = ordinary national diploma;\nHND = higher national diploma; ANC = antenatal clinic; TTC = teacher training college.\nAbu et al. 9\nThe negative implication of teenage pregnancy and child-\nbirth is thus so highlighted. The number of pregnancies ever\nhad by a mother is a factor of child survival as every addi-\ntional pregnancy increases the child's nonsurvival probabil-\nity by about 6.9%. This has to do with the continual weakness\nof the womb of the mother with increasing number of\npregnancies.\nThe importance of maternal education to the survival of\nthe child is also demonstrated by the table. With reference to\nilliterate mothers, a unit of additional educational attainment\nof nursery, all things being equal, yields a 12.7% decrease in\nthe probability of a child dying. Similarly, an attainment of\nsenior secondary school or teacher training college (SSS/\nTTC) from junior secondary school (JSS) yields an even\ngreater decrease by 14.7% of the probability of a child dying.\nThe occupation of the father, rather than that of the mother,\nis considered significant by the model. The likely explana-\ntion for this scenario in the study area is the unwillingness of\nmothers to spend on the child without resorting to the hus-\nbands. Babies born to employed fathers experienced an\nenhanced survival of 4.08% over their counterparts born to\nthe unemployed fathers.\nThe locality of residence of the parents showed that the\nincidence of infant and child mortality is 6.3% higher in\nthe rural communities than in the urban LGAs. In terms of\nthe health seeking behavior of the parents, particularly that\nof the mothers, the importance of antenatal visit and its fre-\nquency during the gestational period is obvious. The inverse\nrelationship between such visits and the survival of the preg-\nnancy outcome indicates that the more consistent and regular\nare the visits to the clinic for check-up during pregnancy, the\nbetter the likelihood of a healthy outcome. The consistent\nand regular visits to the antenatal clinics by the pregnant\nmothers reduce the probability of child dying by 10%. The\nownership of such antenatal clinics is considered to be of\nrelevance to a successful pregnancy outcome. With reference\nto the government-owned clinics, the mothers who made use\nof private clinics, mission hospitals, and \"other\" health cen-\nters recorded, respectively, higher probabilities of 8.6%,\n9.6%, and 4.9% of child dying than the probability recorded\nby mothers who attended government clinics. The quality of\nservices rendered by the government-owned facilities is\nmuch better than that provided by these profit- (or\nphilanthropic)-oriented clinics in the study area.\nThe protection offered the child by immunization is also\nacknowledged by the model as children who received no\nimmunization compared with those who received full dosage\nof immunization have 21.9% higher probability of dying.\nThe importance of breastfeeding as the most nutritious diet\nof the baby during the formative age is stressed by the model.\nBabies who are fed with breast milk exclusively for the first\n6 months of life and extended to a period of 18 months and\nabove are likely to thrive more than those put on breast milk\nfor a period shorter than 6 months for whatever reasons\nadvanced by the mothers. Such babies in the latter category\nexperience 2.4% higher probability of dying compared with\ncounterparts who are on breast milk for more than a year and\nhalf.\nSummary of Findings and\nRecommendation\nThe incidence of early childhood mortality in the study area\nshowed variations from one LGAto another. The proportional\ncontribution of the U5 deaths among the LGAs indicated that\nthe LGAs in the Benue South senatorial district are worse off\nthan the cases in Benue North and Benue Central senatorial\ndistricts. The pattern of the prevalence of the causes of infant\nand child mortality showed that there are three major child\nkillers in the study area: malaria (38.2%), complications at\nhealth challenges that account for over three quarters of early\nchildhood deaths in the study area should be the parental cry\nof the moment in the state.

In the light of the findings of the study, it is\nrecommended that measures should be taken to promote the\nfulfillment of girls' and mothers' potentials not only through\neducation but also through skills development and the eradi-\ncation of illiteracy for all girls and women without discrimi-\nnation of any kind. Mothers should also be educated on the\nneed to engage in exclusive breastfeeding of their babies to\nhelp make the immune systems of these babies stronger.\nGovernments and parents should also ensure that the children\nreceive full and appropriate immunization for child killer dis-\neases. Finally, the parents should be educated on the need to\nstop marrying of their daughters at very young ages as such\nyoung women may be susceptible to delivery complications\nthat can adversely affect health of the child.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAigbe, G.
