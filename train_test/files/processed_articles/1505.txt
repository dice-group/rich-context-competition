SES\ndifferences in immune control over CMV may have fundamental\nimplications for health disparities over the life course.\nHealth disparities by socioeconomic status (SES) in the US\nare well established for a wide range of health outcomes.1\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services declared as\n1 of the 2 major goals of the Healthy People 2010 initiative \"to\neliminate health disparities among different segments of the\npopulation.\" The pathophysiologic mechanisms linking lower\nSES to the earlier onset of disease are not well understood. In\nparticular, very little is known about the role of the immune\nsystem in creating and sustaining health disparities.\nRecent studies have shown that cytomegalovirus\n(CMV) may be a factor in immunosenescence.2\u00ad4 Indeed,\nCMV has been considered a more important predictor of\nmortality than many of the well-known traditional immune\nfunction markers such as CD4:CD8 ratio, T-cell proliferation,\nand B cell counts in older age populations.5 CMV has also\nbeen implicated in cardiovascular disease and more recently\nlinked to cognitive and physical decline.6\u00ad10 Primary infec-\ntion with CMV can occur at a very young age, and is often\nasymptomatic. The virus remains persistent in the infected\nhost's cells for life. Containment of the virus becomes an\nimmune system priority.11,12 Studies have identified positive\nage-related gradients in antibody response to CMV that are\naccompanied by higher shedding of CMV DNA.12 Because\nimpaired cellular immune response can result in increased\nCMV viral replication, these studies suggest that an increase\nin CMV antibody titer is a good marker of compromised cell\nmediated immunity observed in aging.12,13\nPreviously, data from the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III have described\nlarge disparities in CMV prevalence in the US by education,\nincome, and race and ethnicity over a range of ages.14,15\nThese SES disparities in seroprevalence emerge as early as\nage 6 years, converging over age 65 years when more than\n90% of the population is exposed. Socioeconomic disparities\nin CMV seroprevalence provide important information about\nthe link between socioeconomic determinants and exposure\nto CMV, but do not provide any indication of the variability\nin immune response to CMV among those who are seropos-\nitive. The social patterning of immune response among sero-\npositive individuals has not been fully explored. Recent work\nidentified an association between lower education and in-\ncreased immune response to CMV and Herpes Simplex Virus\nType 1 (HSV-1) in a community-based sample of Latinos\nages 65 years and over.16 It is unclear whether similar\ngradients are found across a broader range of categories of\nage, race, and ethnicity. If socioeconomic gradients in CMV\nantibody levels are sustained across the life course, it may\nwell represent an important immunologic pathway linking\nsocioeconomic status to adult immune function and overall\nFrom the aHunter College, School of Health Sciences, City University of New\nYork (CUNY), New York, NY; bCUNY Institute for Demographic Re-\nsearch, New York, NY; cDepartment of Epidemiology, University of Mich-\nigan, Ann Arbor, MI; and dCenter for Social Epidemiology and Population\nHealth, School of Public Health-University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.\nSupported by Robert Wood Johnson Health and Society Scholar program at\nthe University of Michigan (to J.B.D.) and the University of Michigan-\nMedical School, Institute of Gerontology RCDC Fellowship (to A.E.A.).\nand J.B.D.) and Centers for Integrative Approach to Health Disparities\nCorrespondence: Allison E.

Therefore, we analyzed NHANES III data for subjects\naged 25 years and older to assess social patterning in immune\nresponse to CMV.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nParticipants were part of the National Health and Nu-\ntrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III conducted by the\nsample was a complex, stratified, multistage probability clus-\nter of the US population including interview, clinical exam-\nination, and laboratory tests. Persons less than 5 or over 60\nyears of age, non-Hispanic black persons, and Mexican\nAmericans were sampled at a higher frequency than other\ngroups to obtain adequate sample sizes for subgroup analysis.\nThe complete methodology and response rates of NHANES\nIII have been published previously.17 To focus on adult\nsocioeconomic status and antibody response to existing in-\nfection, our analysis includes individuals 25 years and older\nwho are seropositive to CMV (n  10,882). Those classified\nas CMV-seropositive represent 81% of respondents aged 25\nyears and older. As reported elsewhere, correlates of CMV\nseropositivity in the US include lower education and income,\nolder age, and non-Hispanic black and Mexican American\nindividuals (12%) were lacking data on one or more covari-\nates, primarily income, leaving a final sample of 9721 sub-\njects. Individuals with missing income were slightly more\nlikely to be women with less education, but did not differ in\nCMV antibody levels.\nMeasures\nCytomegalovirus antibody levels were tested using fro-\nzen stored sera specimens from NHANES III to estimate the\nseroprevalence of CMV infection (CMV IgG) in participants\naged 6 years and above and released in 2006. CMV-specific\nIgG was measured by an Enzyme Linked Immunoassay\n(ELISA) (Quest International, Inc., Miami, FL). IgG optical\ndensity and ELISA index values were subsequently released\nin 2007 to the investigators by special request to the National\nCenter for Health Statistics. As the original aim of the CMV\ntesting was to identify seropositivity rather than continuous\nantibody levels, 32% of the IgG values for the full sample\n(and 48% of the values for the sample 25 years and over)\nwere given a top-coded value of the maximum detectable\nthreshold, which was set for each test batch. ELISA Index\nconsidered indeterminate with regard to seropositivity by the\nlaboratory (Quest International, Inc.). We conservatively\nclassified these individuals as seronegative to ensure that our\nanalysis focused on antibody response among seropositive\nindividuals and did not reflect underlying differences in\nseropositivity.\nEducation was measured as the respondent's years of\ncompleted education. A linear specification of years of education\nprovided the best model fit. Family income was self-reported\npretax family income for the 12-months prior to the survey\nincluding wages, salaries, income from self-employment, veter-\nan's benefits, interest dividends, rental income, and public as-\nsistance. Income data were recorded in 28 income categories\n$50,000). We coded family income as the midpoint of each of\nthe reported categories (using $65,000 for the incomes above\n$50,000) and adjusted for inflation between the 2 NHANES III\nphases, using the Consumer Price Index. Income was log-\ntransformed due to the skewness of the distribution. Race/\nethnicity was grouped in 4 categories (non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black, Mexican-American, and other).\nA modified Charlson index was used to control for the\npotential impact of current chronic health conditions on\nimmune response. The Charlson index employs a weighting\nsystem for each condition category based on the adjusted risk\nof 1-year mortality.18 A higher score reflects a more severe\nburden of comorbidity. Weights were assigned for having myo-\ncardial infarction, cerebrovascular/peripheral vascular disease,\nchronic pulmonary disease, connective tissue/autoimmune dis-\nease, ulcer, liver disease, diabetes, moderate to severe renal\ndisease, and any tumor. Points for each condition were summed\nto create the final score, as previously described.18\nTo assess the potential effects of any immune-related\nconditions or current infections not captured in our Charlson\nindex, we created 2 medication variables to represent whether\nan individual was taking, near the time of the blood sample,\nany of the major classes of drugs that are: (i) treatments for\nconcurrent infection (ie, antibiotics, cold medicines, antivi-\nrals, antiretrovirals, etc.) or (ii) treatments for autoimmune\ndisorders (ie, corticosteroids, immunologic agents, immuno-\nmodulators, antiarthritics). Other control variables included:\nsex; age in years; marital status (1  married or cohabitating;\n2  widowed, separated, or divorced; 3  never married);\ncensus region of residence; urban or rural residence; house-\nhold size (persons in the dwelling); an indicator for current,\nformer, or never smoking status; and body mass index (BMI).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe association of education and income, with CMV\nantibodies was tested using censored normal regressions to\naccount for the right-censoring of CMV values. This model is a\ngeneralization of the Tobit model that allows censored values to\nvary from observation to observation, rather than a constant\nupper or lower censoring point.19 In our case, because different\nCMV testing batches were arbitrarily top-coded at different\nvalues, this model was the most appropriate. All observations\nwere assigned the CMV value reported, and an additional\nindicator variable was created: 0, if the observation was not\nright-censored and 1, if the observation was right-censored. All\nEpidemiology \u00b7 Volume 20, Number 6, November 2009 Social Gradients in Latent Infection\nanalyses were conducted using STATA 10.0 (STATA, College\nStation, TX) survey commands to account for the complex\nsurvey design, and the sample completing the laboratory com-\nponents was weighted to reflect the noninstitutionalized popu-\nlation of the United States. The command \"cnreg\" was used in\nSTATA for the right-censored models.\nStatistically significant interactions between income\nand sex and between education and sex were identified,\nleading to subsequent stratification by sex. Other covariates\nincluded in preliminary models included age, race-ethnicity,\nCharlson index, census region of residence, urban or rural\nresidence, marital status, prescription medication use, smok-\ning status, or obesity. Of these, only age, race/ethnicity, and\nthe Charlson index were associated with CMV antibody\nlevels in fully adjusted models. The final model thus re-\ngresses CMV antibody levels on education, income, age,\nrace/ethnicity, and the Charlson index, stratified by sex.\nRESULTS\nSample descriptives for the 9797 participants are shown\nin Table 1. There was a higher mean CMV antibody level\namong women compared with men, and lower levels of\nformer and current smoking among women than among men.\nThere were only slight differences in other variables by sex.\nCMV Antibody Levels, Education, and Income:\nFull Sample\nFigures 1 and 2 illustrate the adjusted relationship of\ncategorical education and income with CMV values across\nage, based on predicted values. CMV antibody levels in-\ncreased substantially with age. Within a given age group,\nlevels were higher for those with less education and less\nincome. Increasing age was associated with higher CMV\nantibody levels at the rate of 0.03 ELISA units per year after\nage 25, consistent with a decreased ability of the immune\nsystem to maintain control over the virus with age (Table 2).\nBoth education and family income were inversely as-\nsociated with CMV antibody levels. Each additional year of\neducation was associated with a 0.05 reduction in the CMV\nELISA index value. Thus, holding all else constant, an\nadditional 5 years of education was associated with roughly\nthe same reduction in CMV values as would be seen in a\nrespondent 8 years younger. Non-Hispanic blacks, on aver-\nFIGURE 1. Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition\nand standard errors of antibody response to cytomegalovirus\n(CMV) by age and level of education.

In fully adjusted models, having\nmore chronic conditions as measured by the Charlson Index\nwas also associated with higher CMV levels.\nCMV Antibody Levels, Education, and Income:\nby Sex\nThe associations of education and income with CMV\nvaried by sex (Table 2). For women, years of education were\nmore strongly associated with CMV levels than for men, for\nwhom the association with income was stronger. For women,\neach additional year of education was associated with a 0.08\nreduction in the CMV index, so that an additional 5 years of\neducation was associated with a reduction in CMV values\nsimilar to that seen in women approximately 13 years\nyounger, holding all else constant. For men, the association\nwith income appeared to dominate that of education, such\nthat a doubling of family income was associated with a 0.44\nlower index value of CMV, all else held constant. For men,\nthis 0.44 reduction in the index value is equivalent to the\nreduction associated with being 11 years younger.\nThe effects of race/ethnicity appeared stronger for\nwomen than for men. In fully adjusted models, non-Hispanic\nblack women had a CMV index value that was 0.78 points\nhigher than non-Hispanic white women, and Mexican-Amer-\nican women had an index 0.91 points higher than non-\nHispanic white women, though the standard error was much\nlarger for Mexican-Americans. The magnitude of these dif-\nferences is large compared with the 0.03 unit increase with 1\nyear of age. For men, non-Hispanic blacks had CMV values\n0.31 units higher than to non-Hispanic whites, holding all else\nconstant. In fully adjusted models, the Charlson Index was\nassociated with higher levels of CMV for the full sample,\nslightly less so for women than for men. Adjusting for current\nconditions and comorbidities did not account for the relation-\nship of SES and race/ethnicity, with CMV antibody response.\nCMV Antibody Levels, Education, and Income:\nby Age\nIt is possible that SES differences in antibody response\nwould emerge only in older age groups at greater risk of\nimmune decline. To test this hypothesis we interacted both\neducation and income with continuous age, and also with\ndichotomous age (above and below age 65 years). None of\nthese interactions was statistically significant, providing no\nsupport for the possibility that the associations of education\nand income with CMV antibody response depend on age.\nDISCUSSION\nWe find a substantial association between socioeconomic\nstatus and an indirect marker of cell-mediated immunity in a\nnationally representative sample of the US population. Our study\nconfirms recent findings of an association between level of\neducation and CMV antibody response in a community-based\nstudy of elderly Latinos.16 The findings suggest that impaired\ncell-mediated immunity may be one way that SES is related to\nhealth outcomes in the US population.\nCMV has been called the \"driving force\" behind age-\nassociated alterations to the T-cell immune system. The cost\nof constant CMV immunologic vigilance throughout life may\nbe high.11 This theory is based on evidence that aging\npopulations experience increased CMV-specific CD8 T-cell\nproliferation, reducing the availability of CD8 T-cell carry-\ning receptors that are specific for other pathogens or foreign\nantigens that the immune system may encounter. This large\nclonal expansion of CMV-specific CD8 T cells found in\naging populations limits the capacity of the immune system to\nmount an efficient immune response.20 The reduction in the\nnumber of naive cells able to combat new antigens21 resulting\nfrom CMV-specific clonal expansion can directly hinder\nimmune response in medically important ways, as observed\nin poorer immune responses to influenza vaccination among\nthose with higher CMV IgG antibody levels.22 These effects\nmay be particularly relevant for older adults, for whom poor\nTABLE 2. Censored Regression Models for CMV ELISA Index Values Among Seropositive\nFull Sample\nWomen\nMen\nEpidemiology \u00b7 Volume 20, Number 6, November 2009 Social Gradients in Latent Infection\nvaccine response is related to higher rates of clinical illness\nsuch as influenza infection and pneumonia.23\nRecent work has shown that persistent CMV infection\nin the elderly is an important component of a set of immu-\nnologic parameters designated the \"immunologic risk pheno-\ntype.\"21 This set of immunologic markers, including persis-\ntent CMV, high CD8 cells, low CD4 cell percentages, and\npoor T-cell proliferation, are predictive of mortality among\nhealthy elderly individuals.2,11 In addition to these associa-\ntions, high levels of CMV IgG antibody are strongly corre-\nlated in older people with increases in serum cytokines such\nas tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u00ad) and interleukin (IL)-6.22\nThis inflammatory pathway may explain the observed links\nbetween CMV and cardiovascular disease, frailty, cognitive\noutcomes, and Alzheimer disease.6\u00ad10 Unfortunately, cyto-\nkines were not assayed in NHANES III, and so we are unable\nto test their potential relationship to CMV antibody levels in\nour sample. Testing of C-reactive protein (CRP) data in\nNHANES III preceded high-sensitivity assay techniques, re-\nsulting in 60% of the CRP values in our sample falling below\nthe detectable threshold, limiting its usefulness in our analy-\nses. It is possible that immune response to latent infection\nmay explain some of the socioeconomic gradients in cardio-\nvascular disease and other inflammatory-associated condi-\ntions that have thus far remained unexplained.\nGiven the evidence for the role of CMV in diseases of\naging, the strong patterning of CMV antibody levels by\nincome, education, and race/ethnicity in NHANES III may be\na substantively important pathophysiologic mechanism link-\ning SES to health outcomes. Differences in CMV antibody\nlevels were not accounted for by existing chronic conditions,\nor by health behaviors such as smoking and obesity that\nmight influence immune function. The observed differences\nwere also not explained by factors associated with CMV\nseropositivity, such as the number of persons in the house-\nhold or region of residence.14\nAlthough it is clear that CMV antibody levels are\nhigher in lower SES respondents, firm conclusions about the\ncauses of these differences cannot be drawn from the current\ndata. Several studies have used herpesviruses, including\nCMV, as a marker of subclinical immune response to psy-\nchosocial stressors.24 Increases in herpesvirus antibody titers\nhave been linked to a wide array of stressors, including\ncaregiving for a family member with Alzheimer disease,25\ninvolvement in a difficult marriage,26 anticipation of space\nflight by astronauts,27 traumatic life events,13 academic stress\nin medical students and military cadets,28 as well as psycho-\nlogical traits of loneliness and anxiety.29 Thus, it is possible\nthat our results reflect the impact of SES-related psycholog-\nical stress on down-regulation of the cellular immune re-\nsponse. Further studies should examine whether stress is an\nimportant factor in the relationship between SES and immune\nresponse to CMV in the US population.\nAlternative factors associated with CMV reactivation\ninclude major clinical conditions or treatments such as organ\ntransplant and immunodeficiency.30,31 These factors are not\nlikely to explain the differences found in this study because\nthese conditions are usually correlated with a high level of\nreactivation to the point of clinical disease, such as CMV\nretinitis and other disorders.32 In addition, we controlled for\nthe use of medications that indicate altered immune function\nsuch as antivirals, antiretrovirals, and corticosteroids. Anti-\nbody levels to CMV were assessed by ELISA and therefore\nmay not necessarily reflect all aspects of cellular immune\nresponse to this virus. Further studies are needed to examine\nother markers of subclinical reactivation, such as CMV DNA\nshedding, that were not available in this study.\nIt is possible that increased levels of IgG-specific anti-\nbodies may indicate recent primary infection. This is unlikely\nto be common in our study population because initial infec-\ntion with CMV (as well as reinfection) generally occurs at\nyoung ages.32 There is also no association between household\nsize and CMV antibody levels in our sample (\"household\"\nbeing an important surrogate marker of exposure to infection\nand increased likelihood of transmission).14,33 CMV IgM anti-\nbody, which would indicate recent infection or reinfection, was\nin NHANES III measured only in women aged 12\u00ad49 years. For\nthose women 25 years and older, only 1.74% tested positive for\nCMV IgM, suggesting that primary infection and reinfection are\nnot important factors in our results.\nHigher antibody response may indicate that the dura-\ntion of the infection has been longer or that an individual has\nbeen repeatedly exposed throughout life. If this is the case,\nthen high antibody levels may be a marker for early life or\ncumulative socioeconomic variation in level of exposure to\nthese infections. This hypothesis is consistent with cross-\nsectional evidence that at current age-specific rates of sero-\nprevalence, persons with less education, lower income, and\nnonwhite race are likely to spend a larger number of years\ninfected with CMV by the time they reach older ages.15\nPast history of exposure to pathogens, such as CMV,\nmay be an important determinant of later life chronic condi-\ntions through encouragement of a pro- or anti-inflammatory\nstatus or through gene-environment interactions.2 Socioeco-\nnomic status is related to total pathogen burden, including CMV,\nHSV-1, and Helicobacter pylori, in the US and UK.34,35 The\ncauses of increased pathogen burden and earlier acquisition of\npersistent pathogens in lower SES individuals are not well\nunderstood. Further studies examining the extent to which these\nfactors modify immune response and impact chronic conditions\nsuch as cardiovascular disease are warranted.\nGiven that our measure of comorbidities could be\nconsidered a consequence of both our exposure and outcome\nof interest, we examined the possibility that inclusion of the\nCharlson index was producing a spurious correlation between\nSES and CMV antibody levels. In models excluding the\nCharlson index, coefficient estimates for both income and\neducation were larger rather than smaller, suggesting that\ncomorbidities are likely a mediating factor between SES and\nantibody levels but unlikely to have introduced an upward\nbias in our estimates.\nThere were some differences in our findings by sex. In\nmodels including both education and income, education was\nmore strongly linked to CMV levels for women, whereas\nincome was associated more strongly for men. This could\nreflect substantive differences in the pathways linking SES\nand health, whereby job-related characteristics reflected in\nincome are more important for immune response in men. It\nhas also been suggested that all household members may not\nhave equal access to household income, and that household\nincome may be a less accurate measure of the resources\navailable to women.36\nLimitations to these data included the right-censoring\nof a substantial fraction of our CMV observations, which did\nnot allow a complete picture of the distribution of this\noutcome variable. Fortunately, censored regression tech-\nniques were able to incorporate the information provided in\nthese top-coded values. As in many large population surveys,\nthere was nontrivial item nonresponse, especially for income.\nAlthough those missing income data were slightly more\nlikely to be women with less education, this group did not\ndiffer by CMV antibody levels.\nA limitation to the use of CMV IgG antibody in general\nis the use of qualitative ELISA assays for CMV detection,\nmaking comparisons across studies difficult. Nonetheless,\nwithin studies, elevated CMV antibodies have been linked to\nimportant health risks. In a community-sample of elderly\nLatinos in the US, CMV antibody levels in the highest\nquartile were associated with greater all-cause mortality risk,\ndecreased physical functioning, and increased cognitive de-\ncline.9,37,38 There are few data to indicate standard and\nrecognized risk categories for antibody levels among gener-\nally healthy individuals, making it difficult to specify cate-\ngories of risk. For now, qualitative sample based differences,\nsuch as being in the top quartile category of antibody levels,\nmay be the most salient indicator for health risk. This is akin\nto how cytokines, such as IL-6, are considered as risk factors\nfor cardiovascular health in large-scale studies such as the\nFramingham Heart Study39 and the Women's Health Study.40\nWhile beyond the scope of this study, further research is\nneeded to assess whether high antibody levels to CMV in the\nNHANES population are a risk factor for chronic health\nconditions such as cardiovascular disease.\nWhether through subclinical reactivation due to stress,\nor through a longer period of immune system engagement\ndue to earlier infection, SES differences in immune control\nover CMV may have fundamental implications for health.\nFuture work should test the extent to which cell-mediated\nimmunity, as measured by CMV antibody levels, can explain\nsocioeconomic gradients in specific health outcomes such as\ncardiovascular disease and mortality. The role of CMV in\nimmune system and inflammatory changes suggests the pos-\nsibility of large public health benefits associated with a CMV\nvaccine. In the absence of a vaccine, future work should\nidentify the causes of socioeconomic disparities in both CMV\nseroprevalence and immunity in the US population, to lessen\nthe disproportionate health burden associated with this per-\nsistent viral infection.\n"
