    "abstract": "Abstract: Universal coverage requires a strategy to sever the link between insurance coverage and\nemployment in order to build a more stable insurance base. Universality also will require subsidies to\nmake coverage affordable. Given these realities, the authors evaluate different financing proposals--\nemployer and individual premium mandates and taxes--in terms of equity, affordability, and admin-\nistrative and political criteria. An expansion of Medicare offers an insurance alternative that takes\nadvantage of existing administrative structures of national scope.\nThe debate on how to finance universal coverage depends critically\non acknowledging that universality requires mandated financing. If\none accepts universal coverage, the issue is not mandates but how to\nshare the financing burden between employers and individuals and whether\npremiums (flat contributions) or taxes (income-related contributions)\nshould be the primary financing mechanism. Criteria for evaluating alterna-\ntive schemes are essential to weigh the relative merits of different financing\nmixes and the transition issues that would result. Whatever the theoretical\nmerits of different approaches in a historical vacuum, we must move from\nour current complex mix of tax, individual, and employer financing to a new\nmix that covers everyone.\nAny thoughtful analysis of today's U.S. industry and job structure must\nconclude that we are in the midst of a steady erosion of voluntary employer-\nbased health insurance coverage, the foundation for insuring Americans\nunder age sixty-five.1 To reverse this erosion, mandates are needed to\nensure universal coverage. At the same time, mandates must include subsi-\ndies to make insurance affordable and must address a changing employment\nstructure that makes employment a less and less viable foundation for\nproviding insurance, whatever the mix of financing.\nhealth insurance at any point in time, two million more than in 1991.2 A\nsurvey by The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and The Commonwealth\nFund in August 1993 found that only 7 percent of the uninsured are\nuninsured by choice. The main reason is that uninsured people either\ncannot afford coverage or have an employer that does not pay for coverage.3\nThe income distribution of the uninsured underscores the need for\nsubsidies or income-related financing to achieve universality. Nearly two-\nthirds of the uninsured live at or near poverty.4 With incomes of $24,000 or\nless, these are families who simply cannot afford family premiums, which\ntoday average more than $5,000 a year. We must either require employers\nto bear a portion of this cost, provide tax-financed subsidies, or use tax-like\ncontributions linked to ability to pay to make coverage affordable.\nThe attraction of extending employment-based financing grows out of\nthe fact that most of the twenty-three million low-income uninsured per-\nsons work. Altogether, 84 percent of the uninsured live in families headed\nby either full- or part-time workers.5\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Although employment remains the pillar\non which health insurance coverage in the United States is based, struc-\ntural changes undermine the viability of employment as a foundation for\nthe future, whatever the decisions on financing. Three structural changes\nare particularly relevant: the shift in the employment base away from\nlarge-employer, capital-intensive industries toward small-employer, labor-\nintensive industries; the rapid increase in the proportion of \"contingent\njobs\" that are part time, temporary, and contracted rather than full time,\nyear-round for a single employer; and high rates of turnover in the job\nmarket as people change jobs more rapidly than in the past.\nThe shift to labor-intensive, small-employer service industries erodes\nvoluntarily provided, employment-based health insurance.6 It is not surpris-\ning that about 30 percent of the uninsured work for firms with fewer than\nten employees, and 31 percent work for firms with ten to ninety-nine\nemployees.7 For small employers, health benefit costs tend to be high\nrelative to labor and overall costs, and the task of administering a health\nbenefit program is cumbersome at best.\nFor the 30 percent of all working Americans that make up the contin-\ngent work force of part-time, temporary, and independent contractor work-\ners, no natural, stable employment group exists for insurance purposes.8\nRapid technological change has added to job instability for the full-time\nwork force as well. One in ten Americans reportedly are now switching jobs\nor are without a job for at least some period of each year. People increas-\ningly move in and out of temporary jobs.\nThe willingness of employers with more stable, full-time work forces to\nprovide and pay for family coverage has partially offset and hidden the\nimpact of these structural changes. People in jobs that do not offer health\ninsurance often can enroll as dependents in their spouse's employer plan.\nThis voluntary social commitment by larger employers to pool costs of\nfamily coverage is already eroding. Given these structural changes, financ-\ning strategies must consider how to sever the link between employment\nstatus and insurance coverage while mandating universality.\nFinancing Criteria: Evaluating The Alternatives\nTo evaluate the choices for mandating and financing universal coverage,\nwe must identify values or criteria with which to judge their relative merits.\nAt least six economic criteria and two political concerns apply: ( 1 ) Equity:\nFamilies with similar incomes should pay similar costs, and all firms in the\nsame financial condition should make the same contribution (horizontal\nequity). (2) Financial burden: The full cost of health care premiums is now\nbeyond the means of many families. Payments should be related to ability to\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

(4) Efficiency and employment:\nFinancing should minimize employment impacts of higher labor costs and\nhigh marginal tax rates. (5) Continuity and stability of health insurance:\nFinancing policies should assure continuous, stable coverage as people age\nor change various aspects of their family and work lives. (6) Administrative\nsimplicity, efficiency, and enforceability: Administrative expenses should\nbe minimized, and mechanisms should be adequate for collecting the nec-\nessary funds. (7) Political support of the insured: The design and explana-\ntion of the policies should garner support from both the insured and the\nuninsured. (8) Federal budget costs and taxes: If taxes are to be a source of\nfinancing, alone or combined with mandatory premiums, we must address\nthe misperception that they will necessarily increase payments by families.\nMandates: Evaluating Basic Choices\nMandates to require and pay for universal coverage can be achieved in\nthree ways: employer premiums and individual premiums (fixed contribu-\ntions per person or family) and tax mandates (income-related contribu-\ntions).9 The U.S. health system now relies on a mix of all three, plus direct\npatient payments to finance care. The question is how to use mandates to\nshift and augment this mix to build a base for stable, universal coverage.\nAny choice has advantages and disadvantages that become more or less\nimportant depending on the overall approach to reform and on which\nvalues are dominant. The policy challenge is to choose the mix that best\nmeets basic social criteria while addressing transitional concerns, including\nperceptions about who is now paying the costs of care.\nIn evaluating strategies, we also must examine specific proposals rather\nthan more abstract constructs. While in theory the same distributional\noutcome might be achieved by varying mixes of mandates and subsidies,\nproposals before Congress differ widely in distributional outcomes as well as\nin mandate strategies.\nOn close inspection, those national proposals that require mandates are\ngenerally mixed financing approaches, whatever the labels. For example,\nPresident Bill Clinton's Health Security Act would mandate employer\npayments of up to 80 percent of premiums for full-time workers and partial\npremium contributions for part-time workers. By capping employer premi-\nums as a percentage of payroll ranging from 3.5 percent to 7.9 percent for\nfirms with fewer than 5,000 employees, the proposal effectively converts\nthe flat mandatory per person premium into a payroll-related \"tax\" up to an\nearnings threshold. Moreover, the Clinton plan would require families to\npay a share of the premium directly, with subsidies related to income to ease\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Under the Clinton proposal, income-related caps\neffectively convert the individual premium mandate to an income-related\n\"tax\" up to the income threshold for subsidies, after which mandates revert\nto a flat premium or head tax.10\nSimilarly, proposals with individual premium mandates depend on a\nmixed approach. For example, Sen. John Chafee's (R-RI) Health Equity\nand Access Reform Today proposal would mandate individual purchase of\nhealth insurance, with sliding-scale subsidies up to 240 percent of the\npoverty) would pay 13.3 percent of income for the premium. The plan also\nimplicitly relies on employers to maintain existing levels of premium fi-\nnancing. It would finance subsidies from cuts in Medicare and Medicaid,\neffectively using federal and state general tax revenues to cover the unin-\nsured. To be fiscally sound, the plan might require new general tax revenues\nto achieve guaranteed coverage at proposed subsidy levels.12\nEmployer-Mandated Premiums\nWhile an employer-mandated premium could be designed in many ways,\nthe following discussion assumes that employers would be required to pay\n80 percent of premiums for full-time workers and a partial contribution for\npart-time workers, and that subsidies would be available to employers to\noffset a portion of health benefit costs that exceed a given percentage of\npayroll. It is important to distinguish employer-financed health insurance\nfrom employer-provided health insurance. In the Clinton plan, for exam-\nple, employers with fewer than 5,000 employees would contribute to cover-\nage for workers, but coverage would be provided through health alliances.\nA worker's coverage, therefore, would not necessarily change when he or\nshe changed jobs; only the source of financing for that coverage would\nchange. Plans that mandate both employer premiums and employer provi-\nsion of coverage would inevitably entail considerable instability and turn-\nover of coverage--as workers change jobs, become unemployed, or shift\nfrom full-time work to the contingent labor force.\nNew federal budget costs minimized. Perhaps the single greatest ad-\nvantage of employer premium mandates is that they minimize the extent to\nwhich new federal budget costs and explicit taxes are necessary to achieve\nuniversality. By retaining and building on the $200 billion already spent by\nemployers to pay health care premiums for employees and retirees, man-\ndated employer premium contributions reduce the level of direct public\nsubsidies required for low-income uninsured families. Government subsi-\ndies to individuals could be largely targeted to low-income nonworking\nfamilies. Subsidies to employers to offset a portion of their costs would, of\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

However, it is likely to cost the\ngovernment less to subsidize nonworking low-income families and target\npartial employer/employee subsidies to working low-income families than\nto subsidize premiums directly for all low- and middle-income families.\nOther distributional impacts moderated. By building on the current\nemployer-paid financing base, employer premium mandates moderate\nswings in the distribution of financing when compared with mandates\nfinanced entirely by payroll, income, or other taxes. The major changes are\nfor firms that do not now provide health benefits. According to estimates\nfrom Lewin-VHI, 21 percent of firms that now provide some insurance for\ntheir workers would see their costs go up more than $1,000 per worker.13\nCosts would go down in firms that now cover workers and their working\nspouses, as spouses would obtain coverage from their own employers.\nImproved horizontal equity. An employer premium mandate improves\nhorizontal equity by requiring all firms in a similar situation to pay similar\ncosts. Complex cross-subsidies across employers now encourage firms to\nseek a competitive advantage by shifting the costs of health benefits onto\nother employers without a compensating increase in wages or other bene-\nfits. A firm that provides health benefits often finds itself competing with a\nfirm that does not. While economic theory may argue that noninsuring\nfirms would have to provide compensatory higher wages to attract and\nretain workers, labor markets rarely work so perfectly in practice.\nIf combined with community rating, employer premium mandates would\nensure that firms in the same industry or area would play on a more level\nfield. Variations in the age and health status of covered workers and\ndependents can result in different costs of fringe benefits for firms in the\nsame industry that do not reflect productivity differences. For example, a\nnew Japanese auto plant in the United States may have more single,\nyounger, healthier workers than does an existing U.S. plant and thus may\nface lower labor costs although paying the same wages. Employer mandates\n(especially when combined with community rating and pooling across a\nlarge population base) redistribute costs and, in effect, establish a new\nminimum labor cost for jobs throughout the economy based on the mini-\nmum wages plus health premiums per hour worked.\nLighter fiscal burden on working families. Employer premium man-\ndates can increase the affordability of health insurance for low-income\nworkers and their families while reducing the need for additional govern-\nmental subsidies. Simply put, requiring a currently uninsured family (with\n$1,000 (5 percent of income), imposes a lighter financial burden than\nrequiring the same family to pay the full $5,000 premium (25 percent of\nincome).\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Reuse permissions at HealthAffairs.org.\nAgain, true believers in perfect labor markets may argue that the em-\nployer will pay the worker $4,000 less under the employer mandate so that\nthe cost to the worker is $5,000 in either case. However, employers may\nchoose simply to pass the cost on to consumers in the form of higher prices\n(especially if all firms in the industry are under the same requirement).\nWhile economists note that in that case workers as a whole still would pay\nthrough lower real wages, it makes a great deal of difference whether all\nconsumers bear part of the cost or whether costs are borne solely by workers\nof uninsured firms. Empirical evidence on whether health costs are shifted\nforward to consumers or backward to workers is largely inconclusive.\nEven if employers trade off wages and health benefits, the costs may be\nspread across their work force. For example, if two workers are doing the\nsame job, would the employer pay the worker who has a family health\ninsurance policy less than the worker with an individual policy, or more to\nthe younger worker than to the older one to compensate for the difference\nin their premium costs? Even if employers shift health benefit costs back to\nworkers, those costs may be pooled and distributed across the entire work\nforce, including shifting more of the costs to higher-wage workers.\nThe struggle by workers to keep employer-paid health coverage is driven\nin part by the fact that health benefits are one of the few fringe benefits\nprovided equally, regardless of income. Unlike pensions or life insurance,\nthe value of health benefits does not rise with wages. Thus, the $20,000-a-\nyear line worker typically receives the same health benefits as the $100,000-\na-year vice-president. Middle- and low-income employees do not believe\nthat employers would voluntarily give workers at all wage levels a uniform\nraise of, say, $4,000 a year if they no longer had to provide health benefits.\nSimilarly, employers' opposition to required employer premium pay-\nments reflects an employer/employee consensus that the financial burden\ndiffers when employers rather than employees are required to pay premi-\nums. Although over the long term employer-paid premium costs may re-\nduce total wage income in the economy through the impact of higher prices\nor reduced wage increases overall, this impact is unlikely to be distributed\ndollar for dollar per employee based on that employee's health cost. For\nworkers at or near the minimum wage, in particular, employers are unable\nto reduce wages if health costs increase. Thus, employer premium mandates\nare likely to lower the financial burden for low-income-worker families\nwithout an offsetting equal reduction in their earnings.\nAdministrative enforceability and efficiency. Employer premium\nmandates could rely on the same enforcement mechanisms as Social Secu-\nrity payroll taxes do now. Compared with individual premium mandate\napproaches that would require large payments from low- and middle-in-\ncome families, such mechanisms are likely to be relatively easy to enforce\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The principal disadvantage of employer\npremium mandates is the possible adverse impact on low-wage workers and\nsmall businesses. These premiums hit low-wage, small businesses the hard-\nest and give all employers an incentive to substitute capital for labor. The\nnet impact on employment from the redistribution of health benefit costs is\ndifficult to assess. The Lewin-VHI analysis has estimated that as costs are\nshared more equally across employers, the mandates would change costs by\n$500 or more for three out of four employers that now provide some health\ninsurance: Costs would increase for 34 percent and decrease for 44 percent.\nStudies of minimum wage increases find negligible overall employment\neffects. For example, no detectable change in employment accompanied\nthe last such increase--from $3.55 to $4.25 an hour. This is equivalent to\nan annual increase of $1,400 a year for a full-time worker--more than most\nfirms would experience under an employer premium mandate. Under the\nClinton plan, employer contributions for firms with 5,000 or fewer workers\nwould be capped at 3.5 to 7.9 percent of payroll, mitigating any adverse\nemployment effect. This is at most thirty-four cents an hour for a minimum-\nwage worker, or barely half the last increase in the minimum wage.\nAdministrative complexity. Employer-paid premium mandates must\nestablish complex rules for the range of diverse work relationships. In\naddition, employer premiums may vary for workers with single or family\ncoverage, or according to whether employees have a working spouse. If\nemployer contributions are tied to specific workers, a complex tracking\nsystem must be established to assure that combined employer/employee/\ngovernment contributions cover the premium costs for each family. Ad-\nministrative mechanisms for determining and enforcing accurate subsidy\npayments to firms and to low-income families also must be developed,\nincluding adjustments for changes in family income, family composition,\nand employment arrangements.\nRegressivity and inequities. Employer and employee premium man-\ndates maintain the current regressive insurance financing base. Even in\nlight of income-related premium caps for firms and individuals, the portion\nof income the premium consumes declines as income rises. Premium man-\ndates also mean that families with dependents will pay more of their income\nfor coverage than will single-person households with the same income.\nIndividual Premium Mandates\nExisting congressional proposals that would mandate individual purchase\nof health insurance do so through premium mandates. Individual premium\nmandates, such as those proposed by Senator Chafee, would require all legal\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The Chafee proposal would provide full\npublic premium subsidies for the poor and partial premium subsidies for\nfamilies with incomes up to 240 percent of poverty.\nAvoidance of new burdens on business. The primary advantage of\nindividual mandates is avoidance of new burdens on business or adverse\nemployment effects. For business, the cost of labor remains unchanged if\nfamilies are required to purchase coverage directly.\nSevered link between insurance coverage and employment status.\nTo achieve universal coverage, individual premium mandates must also\nestablish insurance administrative structures independent of employment\nstatus. The Chafee plan would keep coverage employment-based by requir-\ning employers to offer, but not pay for, coverage. However, individual\nmandates could be designed to provide a more secure insurance base for\ncoverage. The wide variety of coverage options includes buying the unin-\nsured into Medicare or Medicaid or new private insurance purchasing pools.\nSubstantial federal subsidies to make insurance affordable. If cover-\nage is to be universal, individual premium mandates must include substan-\ntial federal subsidies. Even if subsidies could be restricted to those now\nlacking insurance, full or partial subsidies to low- and middle-income fami-\nlies would be needed to make premiums affordable.\nAnalysis of the Chafee proposal illustrates the problem. At present,\ntwenty-three million poor or near-poor persons are uninsured, and six\nmillion purchase at least some insurance themselves. Assuming that all\nwould become eligible for public subsidies, an individual mandate would\nadd twenty-nine million people to the twenty-one million already receiving\npublic subsidies, according to our estimates.\nFull vouchers for the working poor, however, would encourage employers\nnow paying for a share of premiums to drop coverage. Even if employers\nwere required to cover all employees equally, employers could provide\nincentives for workers to turn down employer-paid coverage in favor of\npublic subsidies. For sliding-scale as well as full-subsidy families, employers\nwould have an incentive to lower employer-paid contribution rates and\nshift costs to public programs. If employers reduced premium contributions\nfor all currently insured low-income workers, an additional twenty-two\nmillion persons would be eligible for public subsidies, for a total of seventy-\ntwo million. New incentives to drop coverage are likely to accelerate the\nongoing erosion in voluntary employer-financed coverage.\nRegressivity and high marginal tax rates. Individual premium man-\ndates are highly regressive. For example, a sliding-scale subsidy to 240\npercent of poverty for family coverage would mean that a family of three\nearning $28,500 would pay 13 percent of its income for health insurance,\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Reuse permissions at HealthAffairs.org.\nwhile families earning $95,000 or more would pay less than 5 percent\n(assuming a benefit package similar to that in the Clinton plan).\nIf premium subsidies are phased out over a fairly narrow income range\n(up to 240 percent of poverty under the Chafee plan), sliding scales impose\nhigh marginal tax rates as incomes increase. For example, under the Chafee\nproposal, as low-income families worked their way out of poverty, they\nwould pay nearly one out of every four dollars in wage increases for health\npremiums. On top of the existing federal income and payroll taxes, man-\ndates would mean a cumulative marginal tax rate of more than 50 percent\nfor low-income families, not counting the loss of benefits such as food\nstamps or earned income credits, or increases in state or local taxes. Such\npolicies work against current federal and state efforts to remove disincen-\ntives to work and to relieve tax burdens on those who can barely buy\nnecessities without welfare.\nInequality. Individual premium mandates also would treat households\nwith the same income differently depending on family status. At current\npremium rates, an individual would pay a maximum of about $2,000, while\na family of three would pay nearly $4,000. Premiums also would differ\ndepending on whether persons lived in a high- or low-cost medical care\nmarket. Most important, an individual mandate that assumes employers\nthat now insure would continue to do so leaves major inequities among\nfirms in the same industry or in the same area. Firms that voluntarily\nprovide coverage are at a disadvantage relative to those that do not.\nDifficulty of enforcement. Policies that require the uninsured to buy\ninsurance are likely to be difficult to enforce. Mandates would require low-\nand middle-income families to pay regular premiums amounting to a sub-\nstantial share of family income. Mandates would apply to the homeless and\nothers with unstable work and family situations. Delinquency and failure to\npay are likely to be regular problems. Unless insurance coverage were\ncontinuous regardless of whether families met premium obligations, en-\nforcement difficulties could undermine the goal of universal coverage.\nTax Financing Options\nThe policy decision to make universal coverage mandatory is at its core a\ndecision to share the costs of health care across society. Like universal\npublic education, universal health care coverage sets a moral standard and\na community commitment to provide access to a basic necessity in a\nmodern economy.\nAlternatives to employer or individual premium mandates lie in a variety\nof tax financing options. Alone or in combination with some form of\npremium mandate, they could minimize or eliminate some of the disadvan-\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

For example, converting flat premium contributions into a \"payroll\npremium\" tax, with an 80 percent employer and 20 percent employee share,\ncould continue employment-based financing. Private business expenditures\nfor group health insurance premiums now amount to roughly 7-8 percent of\ntotal private wages and salaries. Employee contributions to private insur-\nance amount to an additional 2 percent (counting purchases of individual\npolicies by the self-employed).14 A conversion to a 9 or 10 percent payroll\npremium tax shared by employers and workers on an eighty-twenty basis\nwould retain current levels of employment-based spending in the aggregate,\nalthough redistribution among firms would occur. Income-related premium\ntaxes could be used to finance coverage for nonworking individuals and\nfamilies. General tax revenues or a portion of the payroll premium tax and\nincome-related premium taxes could subsidize coverage for the poor. Alter-\nnatively, there could be a mix of a premium mandate for full-time employ-\nees of large firms and payroll premium taxes for all part-time, temporary,\nand contractual workers.\nIncome-related contributions collected from employers and families\ncould be deposited in private purchasing pools similar to those proposed by\nthe Clinton plan or could pay to extend Medicare-like coverage to all. An\nintermediate option would cover everyone under a Medicare-type plan\nfinanced by payroll taxes for workers and income taxes on nonworkers;\nemployers could opt out of their payroll tax obligation by purchasing\ncomparable coverage privately.15\nInsurance stability and security. Income-related contributions or tax\nmandates require insurance coverage strategies that break the link between\nemployer financing and administration of insurance. While such severance\nis possible with employer premium mandates, financing based on wage and\nother income rather than employment status drives structural decisions\ntoward administrative mechanisms that pool purchase of coverage in a way\nthat does not change when people change work or family status.\nRegressivity and equity. Tax mandates offer a less regressive route\ntoward universality than does premium financing. By moving away from a\nflat premium per person, or head tax, and instead relating contributions\ndirectly to ability to pay, a tax option could distribute costs more equitably\nacross income classes and low- and higher-wage firms than either employer\nor individual premium mandates could. At the same time, by relating\ncontributions to income at the outset and thus directly addressing ability to\npay, tax mandates avoid the need for complex subsidy arrangements.\nSingle-person and family households with the same income would pay\nsimilar amounts. Health costs for dependents would be shared through a\ncommon pool of funds to cover services. Employers and families would not\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Premium financing, whether mandatory or\nvoluntary, gives employers an incentive to discriminate among employees\nby personal characteristics likely to be related to higher health costs.\nEmployers can reduce fringe benefit costs by hiring and retaining single,\nyounger employees and by avoiding workers with families, single-parent\nfamilies, older workers, women of child-bearing age, pregnant women, and\nworkers with other characteristics likely to require health care. Premium\nfinancing based on employment also gives employers an incentive to use\ntemporary, seasonal, or part-time workers or independent contractors. Em-\nployers thus can shift health insurance obligations off corporate budgets\nand onto family budgets or other employers.\nTax mandates based on payroll, income, or other broad-based taxes\nwould minimize these incentives. In particular, payroll-related contribu-\ntions should make employers less sensitive to whether workers work part or\nfull time or on a temporary or permanent basis. A payroll-based mandate\nshould eliminate concerns about the personal health characteristics of\nemployees that are not related to productivity.\nHorizontal equity. Tax-based strategies also spread health costs more\nequally across firms, thereby removing competitive advantages based on\nlocation or employee characteristics. In addition, they can narrow differen-\ntials that develop because older, stable companies tend to have more\nretirees relative to current employees than do start-up firms or firms that\nhave recently relocated.\nAdministrative enforceability. Tax mandates rely on existing tax col-\nlection procedures to enforce financing obligations. Thus, employer with-\nholdings from wage and salary payrolls would provide an enforceable base\nwith which to finance health insurance. For low-income families and\ntransient workers, collection mechanisms are likely to be less complex than\nthose associated with premium mandate strategies.\nDistributional changes. Distributional swings from current financing\nare the primary disadvantage for tax financing. The percentage of payroll\nthat business contributes for health insurance now varies widely across\nindustries and across firms within an industry. Workers similarly find that\nwidely disparate shares of their total compensation go to health fringe\nbenefits and that compensation rates vary by hour and by employment\narrangements within the same company. Thus, even if tax mandates were\nset near the current averages, new premiums related to wage and salary\nbases would produce transitional swings in the distribution of labor costs.\nPerception of tax increase and on-budget federal costs. Popular mis-\nconceptions regarding the amounts paid for premiums, and the difficulty of\nunderstanding that hidden \"taxes\" subsidize care for others, create a percep-\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Reuse permissions at HealthAffairs.org.\ntion that conversion of existing premium payments to more tax-like,\nincome-related contributions would be an increase in taxes even if total\nexpenditures remained the same. These perceptions add to the appeal of\npremium mandates or individual mandates. In addition, even if collections\nwere paid out to state regional funds or quasi-private purchasing alliances or\ntrust funds, conversion of financing to a mix including tax-like mandates\nmight be counted as new on-budget federal costs.\nReaching Consensus\nAs this discussion of the advantages and disadvantages illustrates, financ-\ning universal coverage is likely to require a mixed approach that weighs\nsocial, economic, and political concerns. The goal must be to determine a\nmix that is equitable, has a minimal burden on the economy, is easy to\nadminister, and assures stable coverage. Phasing can ease transitional issues\nsuch as redistribution of costs among employers and families.\nOne attractive alternative is to build on the current mix of employer\ncoverage and Medicare. The uninsured could automatically be covered by\nMedicare, if they were not otherwise covered. Employers that do not\nfinance coverage for workers could be required to contribute either a flat\npremium per worker or a payroll tax to Medicare. Uninsured families also\ncould be assessed an income-related contribution for Medicare coverage\nadministered through the personal income tax. This would achieve univer-\nsal coverage, assure an equitable basis of financing, be relatively easy to\nadminister since it builds on the current Medicare program and tax collec-\ntion system, and provide minimum disruption to current private insurance\ncoverage. In the short term, Medicare would be open only to the uninsured\nbut eventually could provide an option for coverage for all, including\ncurrent Medicaid beneficiaries and workers now covered through their\nemployer.\nRegardless of the mix of financing chosen, achieving universal coverage\nquickly is an important policy priority. Each year the voluntary employ-\nment foundation of our current insurance system deteriorates further, and\nefforts to cope create an ever more complex mix of hidden taxes and cross-\nsubsidies. We now have an opportunity to move to a new, more secure\nhealth system and to correct health financing policies that are more an\naccident of history than the result of explicit policies.\nThe views expressed are those of the authors and not the institutions with which they are affiliated.\nThe authors thank Cynthia Morris, Julie Darnell, and Karen Scott Collins for their assistance.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

    "reduced_content": "by Karen Davis and Cathy Schoen\nPrologue: Ever since World War II the United States has re-\nlied on an employer-based system of health insurance coverage.\nAlthough a majority of workers still rely on employer-based in-\nsurance, a structural shift away from large-employer, capital-\nintensive industries to labor-intensive, smaller employers that\nprovide a service is eroding this coverage. In this paper two\neconomists--Karen Davis, executive vice-president of The\nCommonwealth Fund, and Cathy Schoen, an associate profes-\nsor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst--discuss ac-\ntual legislative proposals that policymakers have introduced to\nachieve broader insurance coverage. As they point out, there\nare a limited number of ways to finance universal coverage:\nemployer premiums, individual premiums, tax mandates, or\nsome combination of the three. To make coverage universal,\nthey urge consideration of an expansion of Medicare, whatever\nthe mix offinancing. This approach is consistent with that being\npursued by Rep. Pete Stark (D-CA), chairman of the House\nWays and Means Subcommittee on Health. Unlike many pol-\nicy analysts, Davis and Schoen do not subscribe to the view that\na government mandate requiring employers to provide insur-\nance to their workers would necessarily lead to a dollar-for-\ndollar reduction in wages of uninsured workers. Some of the\ncosts may be covered by an increase in prices to all consumers.\nDavis, who holds a doctorate in economics from Rice Univer-\nsity, was a key figure in the development of the Carter admini-\nstration's national health insurance plan. Later she became\nchair of the Department of Health Policy and Management at\nThe Johns Hopkins University. Schoen directs the Common-\nwealth Health Care Reform Program, which is based at the\nUniversity of Massachusetts. Previously, she headed the Re-\nsearch and Policy Department at the Service Employees Inter-\nnational Union.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
