Furthermore, the study provides a cross-national comparative perspective through\nthe investigation of the news articles posted by the IranianAl-Alam TV, the Russia Today\n(RT), the German Deutsche Welle (DW), and the BBC.\nAll the above channels are very different in nature, yet they have one thing in com-\nmon which is the use of Arabic language. Since the 9/11 events, there has been a\ngrowing interest by many foreign governments to disseminate media messages to the\nArab masses, especially with the use of national cultural industries like television\n(Straubhaar, 1991). Snow and Taylor (2006) assert that the `war on terror is essen-\ntially a global struggle for hearts and minds, and the media are the principal channels\nfor winning the argument' (p. 400). As a result, many satellite TV channels emerged\nto target the Arab world with long hours of Arabic language programs (Lahlali, 2011).\nIt is estimated that over 1billion dollars were spent up to mid-2013 on running a sin-\ngle Arabic language channel, Al-Hurra TV, which is owned by the US government\n(Seib, 2013: 11). It seems that the majority of these channels gained popularity\nbecause they offer news insights into events taking place around the world and some-\ntimes cover important issues and topics in the Arab region in an attempt to compete\nwith other Pan-Arab channels like Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya (El-Nawawy, 2006).\nAlso, most of these channels provide platforms for Arab audiences to participate and\ndebate issues such as the case of BBC Arabic (Hill and Alshaer, 2010), and many of\nthem have gained credibility due to the timely and professional manner by which\nnews is produced (Al-Jaber and Gunter, 2013; Elareshi and Gunter, 2012). Indeed,\nthese channels are used as tools for public diplomacy by serving the various eco-\nnomic, cultural, and political interests as well as the foreign policies of the non-Arab\ngovernments that run them `as part of the ongoing political rivalry in the region' (Hill\nFacebook that has been chosen for this news investigation, for this online platform,\nhas become a very important SNS tool for reading and commenting on news. Online\nusers consume more news on Facebook-recommended pages than on Twitter, especially\nafter introducing the Facebook Social Reader (Mitchell and Rosenstiel, 2012). Although\nthe survey deals with the US audience, it is important to mention the results of a Pew\nstudy here because it can provide general insight into audiences' media habits in other\nregions. According to this study, about 30percent of Facebook users get their news on\nthis platform which is higher than any other SNSs such as YouTube (10%) and Twitter\n(8%) (Pew Research \u00ad Journalism Project, 2013). When SNS users like a Facebook page\nof a news organization, they begin receiving its news feeds, which is a new form of news\nIn the following literature review, a discussion of the theoretical concept of news\nvalues and ideologies as well as news organizations' SNS use is presented because they\nare directly linked to the focus of this study. First, the literature on news values provides\nthe main theoretical background in which this study is situated as it deals with the news\nselection process of several news organizations. The other area covered in the literature\nreview is ambient journalism or news organizations' SNS use. In particular, this study\ninvestigates the news selection process on SNSs which is another under-researched area\nin journalism and media studies. By examining the literature on news values, we find that\nthe majority of previous studies focus on traditional media outlets rather than their social\nmedia platforms; hence, exploring this can help in further understanding the news selec-\ntion agendas of these news organizations.\nLiterature review\nSince this study deals with the concept of news values, it is important to begin the\ndiscussion with one of the first studies in this field. This research relies on the pioneer-\ning study of Galtung and Ruge's (1965) taxonomy of news as well as on Harcup and\nO'Neill's (2001) follow-up study which proposes a number of news values criteria,\nincluding the power elite, celebrity, entertainment, surprise, bad news, good news,\nmagnitude, relevance, follow up, and newspaper agenda (see also Brighton and Foy,\n2007). Here, the political and cultural dimensions are linked to the ideology that is\nrelevant to this study.\nIn their hierarchical model of news values, Shoemaker and Reese (1996) explain that\nnews is influenced by several factors including routine newsroom practices and ideologi-\ncal values adhered by journalists and their news organization. In their more developed\ntheory of news values, Shoemaker and Cohen (2006) focus on the elements of deviance\nintensity and social significance to explain newsworthiness. The former is classified into\nthree main types: statistical, social change, and normative, while the latter is defined as\n`relevance for the social system' in relation to four dimensions: political, economic, cul-\ntural, and public (pp. 7, 15, and 49). In the two models above, there is a clear focus on\nthe impact of the relevant context and ideological values on newsworthiness as they\napparently encompass political and religious attitudes and stances that can explain the\nnewsworthiness measures followed by some news organizations.\nFurthermore, Adams (1986) examines how proximity in the news can be an important\nindicator of newsworthiness especially in terms of economic, political, and cultural ties\nwhich connect nations together. This seems to be related to people's beliefs and general\ninterests. Cohen et al. (1990) refer to a similar concept which is called psychological\nproximity in the sense that people have `zones of relevance' which they use to determine\nthe relevance or importance of news to their lives. This, of course, applies to journalists'\ndecisions in the news selection process as these zones of relevance can be of various\nkinds, like sharing certain political, religious, or cultural beliefs and values. In other\nwords, some counties or nations tend to be newsworthy for those with which their audi-\nences share similar ideologies and cultural values.\nIndeed, news organizations must be influenced by certain ideologies. In this regard,\nThompson (1990) emphasizes that ideology is a `meaning in the service of power' (p. 7)\nwhich can explain how news organizations can sometimes become tools used by their\nowners to convey certain messages. This is in line with Herman and Chomsky's (2008)\npropaganda model in which one of the main news filters is media ownership. On the\nother hand, journalists themselves must be influenced by their own ideology even if they\nhave not noticed it. Stuart Hall (1985) affirms that journalists are `inscribed by an ideol-\nogy to which they do not consciously commit themselves, and which, instead, \"writes\nthem\"' (p. 101). What is evident here is that the influence of the ideological background\ncannot be overlooked in understanding the news selection process.\nNews organizations and use of SNSs\nBefore the introduction of SNSs, news organizations realized the need to change their\ntraditional one-way communication strategy by giving viewers the freedom to comment\non news and sometimes allowing them to customize the online platforms into their own\npreferences (Chung, 2008; Chung and Yoo, 2008); some news organizations also pub-\nlished readers' comments in the print version (McElroy, 2013). This was one of the first\nsteps taken by media outlets to broaden their readership. Later, several news organiza-\ntions created multimedia platforms in which the news experience is characterized by\nthree main features: portable, personalized, and participatory (Project for Excellence in\nJournalism, 2010). Some of the interactive features provided by news organizations\nincluded creating discussion groups, blogs, and forums (Boczkowski, 1999; Schultz,\nabove interactive tools enable journalists to interact with their readers, on one hand, and\nreaders can exchange their opinions among themselves, on the other hand (Constantinescu\nand Tedesco, 2007: 449). Also, many newspapers and TV stations provide hyperlinks to\nother topics and stories by which journalists are able to change the news frame that\n`emphasizes broader social and political themes' since the `[e]xpanded framing may\nprove central to re-engaging an increasingly distrusting and alienated citizenry in a 21st\nCentury democracy' (Pavlik, 2001: 320). This new phenonmenon can be called news\nThere are several studies that examine the comments sections of news sites by, for\nbut there are only a few empirical studies that investigated the content of news stories\nposted on news organizations' SNS channels. Having realized the growing significance\nof social media, news organizations are involved more than ever in them, viewing ser-\nvices like Facebook and Twitter `as opportunities to market and distribute content'\nin their study that 81percent of the US TV stations had Facebook pages in 2009 which\nand shared much more than before as it has become a social experience (Redden and\nwhich refers to social information networks that provide an `asynchronous, lightweight\nand always-on communication system ... enabling citizens to maintain a mental model\nof news and events around them' (p. 301). Goode (2009) stresses that news stories are\nbeing `amplified, sustained and potentially morphed as they are re-circulated, reworked,\nand reframed by online networks' (p. 1293).\nIn fact, many news organizations implemented social media guidelines for their\nemployees and hired social media specialists due to their importance in maintaining the\nimage and identity as well as enhancing the public relations efforts of these news organ-\n2010). Among the first TV stations that used Facebook to enhance its news dissemina-\ntion was ABC News which officially partnered in 2007 with Facebook to allow its users\nto `electronically follow ABC reporters, view reports and video and participate in polls\nand debates, all within a new \"U.S. Politics\" category' (Stelter, 2007). Also, CNN, for\nexample, employed around 150 employees to tweet the news by the fall of 2008\n(Garrison-Sprenger, 2008), and it created the `Facebook Connect' service to increase\nonline audiences and make them more connected (Emmett, 2009). Most commonly,\nnews organizations would share hyperlinks to stories posted online in order to direct\ntraffic from SNSs to their own websites wherein users can also comment using their\nthe news contents can be disseminated `virally' (Stelter, 2007, para. 11). Furthermore,\nSNSs have offered solutions to news organizations that are less problematic and costly\nthan the comments section which usually contains a great deal of incivility (Howell,\n2007). Braun and Gillespie (2011) call SNSs `digital intermediaries' because of their\npractical functions.\nFinally, it is important to note that SNS newsreaders are not always engaged or inter-\nested in everything posted by the news organization despite the fact that they follow its\nTwitter or Facebook pages. For example, when NPR posted a controversial story on its\nFacebook page during April Fools' Day, many online readers commented on it by read-\ning the headline only rather than reading the full story which was merely a prank\n(Dickson, 2014; NPR, 2014). This example sheds light on the kind of weak involvement\nsome online readers have with news mostly due to time constraints. Yet, this phenome-\nnon is not confined to news stories posted on SNS outlets as previous studies have shown\nsimilar tendencies when it comes to print and online media (Garcia et al., 1991; Holmqvist\nIn order to cover some of the overlooked aspects of news values decisions followed\nby news organizations, this research study attempts to answer the following research\nquestions:\nRQ1. In relation to the news selection process, what is the dominance of news stories\nin relation to references to countries posted on the Facebook pages of the four TV\nchannels?\nRQ2. In relation to the news selection process, what is the dominance of news stories\nin relation to references to political actors posted on the Facebook pages of the four\nTV channels?\nMethod\nFor the purpose of the study, a webometric tool called NVivo 10 \u00ad NCapture was used to\nmine the Facebook posts of the following Arabic language TV channels: Al-Alam TV\n(Iranian), RT (Russian), DW (German), and BBC (British) in late February 2014. These\nchannels have been chosen because they represent a broad spectrum of foreign channels\nbroadcasting to the Arab world in Arabic language, so it is highly important to compare\nthem, especially that the journalists working at these stations presumably have diverse\nideological backgrounds due to the different political and media systems they live in. For\nexample, Al-Alam TV channel is run by a government that is characterized by its totali-\ntarian rule which has a tight control over the media (Semati, 2007: 144); hence, Al-Alam\nchannel is used as a state instrument to influence the opinions of Arab masses. Similarly,\nRT is regarded as a propaganda tool in the hands of Putin's government to serve foreign\npolicy interests (Ioffe, 2010). On the other hand, the BBC and DW, which are both\nregarded as public broadcasting services, are more independent from their respective\ngovernments and both originate from well-established Western democracies.\nIn order to have a better understanding of the news selection practices followed by\nthese four TV channels, it is important to provide some background information on each\nof these media outlets. First, Al-Alam (The World) TV is a 24-hour Arabic channel that\nis financed and run by the Republic of Iran Broadcasting. The channel airs 36 extended\nand brief newscasts that are compiled by 50 correspondents stationed in 40 countries. It\nhas four main bureaus in Tehran, Baghdad, Beirut, and Damascus, and the channel\nstarted broadcasting in February 2003 with the onset of the US-led invasion of Iraq\n(Al-Alam, 2012). The timing of this launch seems to denote Iran's need to influence the\npublic opinion in the Arab world and to communicate the Iranian official outlook toward\nthe events happening in the region. Al-Alam's website is in two languages: Persian and\nArabic, and it allows readers to post comments on the website. The channel admits that\nit gives special attention to some important issues in the Islamic world especially Iraq,\nIran, Palestine, Lebanon, and African states (Al-Alam, 2012). According to the goals,\nwhich are published on its website, the channel aims at airing `fast, credible, and precise'\nnews, and it further claims to address `solutions to the problems that the Islamic andArab\nworld is suffering from after investigating their deep roots' (Al-Alam, 2012). From the\nbeginning, Iranian authorities installed TV transmitters near the Iraqi border to guarantee\nthat Al-Alam's airwaves reach a large segment of the Iraqi public (Usher, 2006). During\nthe US-led invasion of Iraq, the channel played an important role in emphasizing the\nnumber of Iraqi civilian causalities as it called the conflict a `\"war of domination\" and\nroutinely referred to coalition forces as \"occupiers\"' (BBC Monitoring, 2003). Finally,\nAl-Alam's Facebook page has over 673k likes and 354k people talking about it (face-\nSecond, BBC Arabic television started broadcasting in March 2008, though there was\nan earlier broadcasting in cooperation with Orbit Network in 1994 which lasted about\n2years. BBC Arabic TV is part of the BBC public broadcaster organization in the United\nKingdom, but it is not as old as the BBC Arabic radio service which began transmission\nin 1938. On the website of BBC Arabic (bbcarabic.com), online readers cannot post any\ncomments on news reports; instead, there is only the option of `share your opinion' in a\nspecial section on the website. Hence, the news organization seems to freely allow online\nreaders to post their views on Facebook because it apparently takes no time and efforts\nfrom the staff to moderate the comments on this platform, as will be explained below.\nAccording to the BBC Arabic website, the news organization is regarded as the `most\ncredible and objective outlets in the Arab world' (BBC Arabic, 2014). Also, over 21mil-\nlion people visit its website including about 1.5 unique visitors.As for its Facebook page,\nit has over 2.3million likes and 107k people talking about it (facebook.com/bbcarabic).\nThird, RT Arabic (arabic.rt.com/) or Rusiya Al-Yaum started broadcasting on 4 May\n2007. The name of the channel has officially changed into RT, and it is run by TV-Novosti\nwhich is affiliated with the Russian government. On its website, the channel claims to be\n`non-commercial and independent', and about 350million people can view the channel\nin the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe (RTArabic, 2014). Unlike BBC Arabic, RT\nArabic allows online readers to post comments on its website. Its Facebook page has\nover 2.5million likes and 242k people talking about it (facebook.com/rtarabic.ru).\nFinally, DW Arabic (dw.de//s-9106) is part of Germany's public interna-\ntional broadcaster. DW Arabic was established in 2002 and aired programs for 2hours\nold as its Arabic radio station that began transmission in 1959. Comments posted on DW\nArabic are moderated and controlled. For example, online readers have to fill in and\nsubmit a special form in order to be able to make a comment. After 2011, airtime hours\nwere extended. Currently, DW Arabic airs 10\nhours of Arabic programs followed by\n14hours in English that reach viewers in the Middle East and North Africa. According to\nthe DW website, two programs are very popular in the Arab world, Shabab talk (Youth\ntalk) and The New Arab Debates because they involve young Arabs debating politics and\nIn most cases, the Facebook page administrator posts the news headline, a hyperlink\nthat leads to the online article that is available on the news organization's website, and\na lead containing a brief description of the whole article. In some cases, a video link or\nphoto accompanies the news article. Based on a cross-examination of a random sample\nof over 160 news stories posted on the four Facebook pages, it appears that all the head-\nlines and leads are typical to what is found in the websites themselves since the Facebook\npage administrators copy and paste the same original materials without altering them. If\nany online reader feels interested in a news report, (s)he can click the hyperlink leading\nto the complete version posted on the website. For the purpose of this study, all the news\ninvestigated in this study in order to examine the news posted in the same time frame.\n7986 by Al-Alam, and the total number of news stories investigated in this study is\n15,589 stories which are all in Arabic. Al-Hurra TV was initially chosen, but its\nFacebook page contained mostly questions for its online audience, so it was excluded\nfrom the study.\nThe collected posts were analyzed using QDA Miner 4 \u00ad Wordstat program. This\nstudy content analyzes the text corpus by identifying the most recurrent words used in\nkey concepts and clusters of concepts'in which he examines `the analysis of the distribu-\ntion and interconnection of pivotal ideas appearing in a textual database' (p. 197). In\nsome of his framing studies, Entman (2010) uses QDA Miner and mentions that it was\nuseful due to its `improved efficiency in carrying our more complex content analyses'(p.\n334). This quantitative method is useful to identify the most dominant words used by\nposters which `minimizes problems of research judgment' (Miller, 1997: 376).\nIn this study, two main news selections are made. First, the most recurrent words\nbased on the repetition of three times and above are examined, so all references to coun-\ntries, their capitals, and any derivation of the countries' name like their different adjec-\ntives are counted. This is part of the news values study in order to investigate which\ncountries are more prominent in the news reports in the sense that they are repeatedly\nmentioned. The names of countries' capitals are incorporated because in some cases the\nreference to the country's capital is used as a metonym, standing for the government or\nstate as a whole. In the end, the top 10 most referenced countries are identified as can be\nseen in Table 1. Second, the number of references to politicians or political actors is\nexamined. As there are far too many politicians mentioned, the selection is limited to\nthose who have a total of over a 100 references (see Table 2 and Figure 2). All preposi-\ntions and articles are also removed in order to focus on proper nouns.\nResults and discussion\nAs indicated above, this study examines the Arabic language Facebook posts of four TV\nchannels. The results of the study show that there are stark variations in the kind of atten-\ntion and emphasis given to countries and political actors, but it is important to note here\nthat some of these differences are due to the vast variations in the news volume or num-\nber of news reports posted on Facebook, as indicated above. For example, in the time\nframe investigated in this study, Al-Alam posted 7986 stories, whereas DW Arabic had\nonly 822. Hence, there was a need to examine the percentage of coverage in relation to\ncountries and political actors. The figures cited in the two tables are taken from raw data,\nwhile the percentages are calculated based on the total number of references to countries\nand political figures made by each news organization.\nIn relation to the countries cited in the headlines and leads, Table 1 shows the fre-\nquency of attention and average percentage by the four channels.\nBy examining the raw data of all the TV channels, we find that the top five countries\nand (5) Russia (n=1143). Due to the disparity in the number of news stories posted on the\nfour Facebook pages, it is also important to examine the average percentage of each coun-\ntry mentioned along the four Facebook pages which are as follows: (1) Syria 19.1percent,\n(for a more complete overview of the countries frequencies, see Figure 1).\nAs for the references and average percentage of political actors by the four channels,\nTable 2 illustrates the results.\nThe raw data taken from all four TV channels in relation to references to political\nfigures reveal that the top five actors are (1) Sergey Lavrov (n\n=\nel-Sisi (n=164) (see Figure 2 for another overview of the political actors highlighted by\nthe four channels). Using the same procedure followed above with references to coun-\ntries, we find that the average percentages of each political actor mentioned along the\nfour Facebook pages are as follows: (1)Abdel Fattah el-Sisi 19.7percent, (2) Mohammed\npercent, and (5)\nNouri Maliki 8percent.\nAs explained above, news production is affected by different factors such as the ideo-\nlogical values of the journalists and their news organizations as well as media ownership.\nShoemaker and Cohen (2006) refer to social significance as one of the important elements\nof newsworthiness which is related to the news `relevance for the social system' along\nfour dimensions: political, economic, cultural, and public (pp. 7, 15). Furthermore,Adams\n(1986) and Cohen et al. (1990) emphasize the importance of psychological proximity in\nTable 1. Frequency references and average percentage to countries by the four TV channels on their Facebook pages.\nCountry DW BBC Al-Alam RT Total\n Percentage Frequency Percentage Frequency Percentage Frequency Percentage Frequency Frequency\nDW: Deutsche Welle; RT: Russia Today.\nTable 2. Frequency references and average percentage to political actors by the four TV channels on their Facebook pages.\nTopic DW BBC Al-Alam RT Total\n Percentage Frequency Percentage Frequency Percentage Frequency Percentage Frequency Frequency\nDW: Deutsche Welle; RT: Russia Today.\nthe news as another indicator of newsworthiness. In general, a news organization gives\nmore prominence to an issue if more coverage is devoted to it (Hofstetter, 1976; Siune\net al., 1984) which is evident either by the volume of coverage or by the ongoing report\non the issue.\nTo answer the first research question on the dominance of news stories in relation to\nreferences to countries, there seems to be great variations in the number of news stories\nand their focus among the four channels, but it is important to note first that most of the\nTV channels have special sections for language teaching (Farsi, German, Russian, and\nEnglish) and general information about the countries that run or host the news organiza-\ntion. This clearly indicates that the news organizations such as RT Arabic and Al-Alam,\nwhich are managed by their respective governments, can function as public diplomacy\ntools, though other purposes might be involved like promoting tourism. For RT Arabic,\nSyria is the country that attracted most of the attention 25.2\nclearly due to the ongoing conflict there. References to Russia came second 22.3percent\n(n=980) which is also understandable because of the need to add relevance and proximity\nFigure 1. Frequency of references to countries by the four channels on their Facebook pages.\nThe numbers above the columns represent the unique channels' numbers on the right side of this figure.\nto the news. Switzerland came third 7.7\npercent (n\n=\n340) mostly in relation to the\nUN-organized Geneva meeting in which officials from the Syrian government met with\nopposition groups and parties. The United States came fourth 7.5\nIn relation to Al-Alam TV, we find the same editorial tendency followed by RTArabic\nsince there is a clear emphasis on highlighting Iran and its role in the region. There is also\nthe sectarian proximity or social significance \u00ad cultural relevance that plays a role here;\nfor example, Al-Alam made 50 references to the Houthis, the Shiite opposition group in\nYemen though no other channel referred to them. Syria comes first again because of the\n=\npercent (n=854). Again, religious proximity\nseems to play a role here as Bahrain is not regarded as a newsworthy topic by the other\nnews organizations, but Al-Alam emphasizes the Shiite protests against the Sunni mon-\narchy in its news reports. In fact, the channel devotes a special section for Bahraini news\nin order to thoroughly cover the events taking place there. Also noteworthy is the fact\nFigure 2. Frequency of references to political actors by the four channels on their Facebook\npages.\nThe numbers above the columns represent the unique political figures' numbers on the right side of this\nfigure.\nthatAl-Alam showed a great deal of emphasis in airing the Shiite protests in SaudiArabia\nas well as the fighting between the Shiite Hawthis and government troops in Yemen. At\nthe same time, the channel downplayed the events taking place in Syria and Iraq between\nSunni rebels and Shiite government forces. As Sebastian Usher (2006) claims, Iran uses\nAl-Alam channel in order to `influence and stir up opinion in the Arab world and beyond\n\u00ad just as it tries to control the information available to its own people within the country'.\nAs a result, Al-Alam news coverage created anger and distrust among policy makers in\nthe Arab world which led to jamming its signals (Press TV, 2011) and to the decision to\nstop its transmission on Nilesat and Arabsat on 3 November 2010. Arabsat did allow the\nchannel to resume broadcasting, yet it stopped its transmission another time within a\nperiod of 2months (Al-Alam, 2010). It is assumed that due to the difficulty of watching\nthe channel in the Arab world via the two popular Arab satellites, Al-Alam enhanced its\nsocial media activity especially on Facebook to maintain and possibly increase its audi-\nence engagements. This partly explains the high number of stories posted on its Facebook\npage in comparison with the other channels examined in this study. According to\nSocialbakers (2014), Al-Alam's Facebook page fan distribution is as follows: 21.6per-\npercent Russia,\n4.7percent Saudi Arabia, 3.3percent Lebanon, and 2.7percent Bahrain. There seems to\nbe some level of correlation between Al-Alam's Facebook fans and the demographic\nspecificities of some of the above countries.\nAs for BBC Arabic, the United Kingdom is mentioned more than the other countries\n=\n(n=142), and Iraq 5.9percent (n=60). Again, there is emphasis on the country of origin\nwhich runs or sponsors the news organization. Finally and as expected, DW highlighted\nGermany more than other countries with 285 references (29.6%) followed by Egypt\nDW are the only channels that highlighted the events and political changes in Egypt\nmore than the conflict in Syria. This can be explained based on the political dimension\nof social significance as well as the social change deviance in news values that focuses\non `threats to the status quo' in connection to covering `civil demonstrations that bring\nabout a new presidential election' (Shoemaker and Cohen, 2006: 49).\nYet by examining all the four TV channels' average percentages, we find that Syria\ncomes first with 19.1percent followed by Egypt 12.3percent, Iraq 8.6percent, Russia\npercent, and Iran 5.9\npercent. The magnitude of events taking place in Syria, the\nfollow-up factor, and the fact that it deals with bad news all explain why this country\nranks first as these are all basic elements of news values (Harcup and O'Neill, 2001).\nBased on the number of references to countries, it becomes clear that Al-Alam TV pays\ngreat attention to Bahrain and the Shiite protests in the Gulf region though the news\nsignificance cannot be compared to other important events taking place in the Arab\nregion. Aside from the ideological influence stated above, other elements like social\nsignificance and proximity are involved in explaining the prominence given to certain\ncountries like Russia on RT Arabic, Germany on DW Arabic, and the United Kingdom\non BBC Arabic.\nTo answer the second research question on the dominance of news stories in relation\nto references to political actors, we find that RT Arabic focused on Russian politicians\nmuch more than other actors; in this regard, the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov,\ncame first with 150 references (21.9%) followed by the Russian President, Vladimir\ncent (n=59). The latter was mostly mentioned in connection to the Geneva meeting cited\nabove. As for the attention given to political actors by Al-Alam TV, the Iranian President,\nHassan Rouhani, was the most referenced 14.7\npercent (n\n=\ncent (n=113). Ideological affinity and psychological proximity seem to play a role here\nas Assad, an Alawite whose government is closely backed by the Iranian regime, is high-\nlighted in Al-Alam's TV news reports far more than the other channels. Also, Al-Alam\nand RTArabic are the only two channels that highlighted the activities of Walid Muallem\nAl-Mu'lam, the Syrian Foreign Minister. Similar to Iran, Russia is a staunch ally of\nAssad's regime for various reasons including some shared interests as well as Putin's\nalleged fear that the popular sentiments of overthrowing totalitarian regimes in the\nstudy examining the Russian media coverage of the Syrian conflict, more blame for the\nprevailing violence is directed at Islamist radicals rather than Assad's regime which\nincludes accusing the Syrian opposition to be behind the chemical attack in the outskirts\nof Damascus (Brown, 2014: 57). This kind of coverage is understandable if we take into\naccount that the media in Russia is largely polarized especially in relation to `nationally\ndistributed TV channels', and RT is certainly included because it is state-funded; these\nchannels are `increasingly used by the state as tools to support the vertical power system\nAs for the main political actors mentioned by BBC Arabic, we only find Mohammed\npercent (n\n=\n25), the former Egyptian president, coming first followed by\npercent (n\n=\npercent (n=13). As for\nreferences to political actors by DW, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi 29.6percent (n=24) is the most\ncited actor followed by Mohammed Morsi 18.5percent (n=15), Bashar Assad 18.5per-\ntioned above, the more attention given to a country or political actor, the more importance\nis shown. In other words, each news organization paid special emphasis to their respec-\ntive countries and national politicians except for the BBC and DW, though the latter\nmade 21 references to Angela Merkel. One of the main possible reasons for such a dif-\nference in coverage is that the Iranian and Russian channels are directly supported and\ninfluenced by their respective governments as stated above which ultimately affect the\nnews values' choices. On the other hand, the BBC and DW showed different emphases\nbecause they are more independent from their governments, especially in terms of fund-\ning due to their mandate as public broadcasting services.\nConclusion\nSince SNS use has become an integral part of the news consumption experience in\ntoday's world, it has become important to thoroughly study news organizations' social\nmedia use. Indeed, SNSs offer new opportunities for news organizations to reach more\naudiences in what Hermida (2010) called `ambient journalism' or a non-moderated\nplatform for online readers. These platforms have become magnets for interested readers\nto consume, share, like, and disseminate news as well as interact with others on a variety\nof issues and in a very timely, thorough, and engaging manner.\nThis study examined the news posted on the Facebook pages of four Arabic language\nTV stations: The Iranian Al-Alam TV, the RT, the German DW, and the BBC. From the\ntotal 15,589 news stories analyzed, the study finds that social significance and proximity\nas well as the news organizations' ideological agenda are among the principal elements\nthat explain the news selection process. The results of this study correspond with Galtung\nand Ruge (1965) and Harcup and O'Neill's (2001) theories on the taxonomy of news\nparticularly in relation to social significance and proximity as well as the news organiza-\ntions' ideological agenda (Thompson, 1990).\nFor future research, other news organizations can be selected in order to find differ-\nences and similarities in the news stories posted on SNSs. Also, other social media plat-\nforms can be chosen like Twitter, Google+, and YouTube to find whether differences\nexist in the quantity and type of news stories posted by news organizations. Finally,\nsemi-structured interviews with journalists and news organizations staff responsible for\nmanaging the various SNS platforms of news organizations can shed light into important\naspects that have not been covered in this study.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship,\nand/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nReferences\nAbdul-Mageed M (2008) Online news sites and journalism 2.0: Reader comments on Al Jazeera\nArabic. tripleC: Communication, Capitalism & Critique 6: 59\u00ad76.\nAdams W (1986) Whose lives count?
