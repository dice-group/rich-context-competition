Older Japanese men with difficulty bending their knees (OR = 2.6), who use more external prescription drugs\n(OR = 1.9), and with cancer (OR = 2.0 times) had higher risks of hip fracture. Further considerations of gender- and culture-\nspecific factors along with the identified risk factors may provide insights into future intervention programs for hip fracture\nin Japanese older populations.\n",

The estimated number of new cases of\nleading cause of becoming bedridden following stroke and\nfrailty due to advanced old age in Japan (Ministry of Health\nLabour and Welfare, 2005). Furthermore, the risk of mortal-\nity increases due to the severe injury and complications\nafter hip fracture (Hasegawa, Suzuki, & Wingstrand, 2007).\nEven in cases of successful recovery, increased needs for\nextensive care and institutionalization are often reported\n(Alexander, Rivara, & Wolf, 1992; Yoshimura, Suzuki,\nPreventing hip fracture is a public health priority in the\nJapanese society given the ongoing transition to the super-\naging society. By 2050, the population age 65 years and older\nis expected to reach 40% of the total Japanese population\n(Cabinet Office, 2007). Even if the age-specific incidence\nrates of hip fractures stay constant, the total number of\nindividuals experiencing hip fracture is likely to follow the\nnumber of older adults (Cummings & Melton, 2002). Hip\nfracture is known to be an expensive injury due to intensive\nmedical treatment and follow-up care (Cummings & Melton,\nbudget crisis, further medical expense would be tremendous\nburden on the Japanese society (Kunieda, 2002).\nMore than 90% of hip fractures are attributable to falls in\nthe older population (Youm, Koval, Kummer, & Zuckerman,\n1999). Constructing hip fracture prevention strategies\nrequires an understanding of the risk factors for falls. Thus,\nsources of potential risk factors for hip fracture will be\nidentified from the literature about falls risk factors. Many\nstudies have identified risk factors of hip fracture in Western\ncountries (Otaka, Riu, Uzawa, & Chino, 2003). Given the\nknown gender differences in hip fracture risk factors\n(Cummings et al., 1995), this study conducts analyses of risk\nfactors separately for women and men. Although some\nJapanese studies investigated risk factors of hip fracture\nusing the large samples (Suzuki et al., 1997), further popula-\ntion-level research is necessary for developing higher quality\nintervention programs from public health perspectives. The\npurpose of this study is to identify the risk factors of hip\nfracture in the relatively understudied population of Japanese\nolder adults using nationally representative data.\nMaterials and Method\nStudy Population\nThis study used data from the first wave of the Nihon Uni-\nversity Japanese Longitudinal Study of Aging (NUJLSOA)\n1University of Nevada, LasVegas, USA\n2Miami University, Oxford, OH, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nTakashiYamashita, Department of Sociology, University of Nevada\u00adLas\nEmail: yamasht@muohio.edu\nRisk Factors for Hip Fracture in\nJapanese Older Adults\nTakashiYamashita1 and A.

NUJLSOA used a multistage probabil-\nity sampling method to collect nationally representative\ndata of Japanese older adults age 65 and older. Trained\ninterviewers conducted face-to-face interviews using a\nstructured questionnaire. Those who were 75 years and\nolder were oversampled for the purpose of detailed analysis\nof the oldest old population. The NUJLSOAsurvey included\na wide range of questions such as demographic information,\nsocioeconomic status, medical history, lifestyle, and health/\ndisability status of Japanese older adults. For this study,\nonly community-dwelling older adults (N = 4,967) were\nanalyzed after excluding those who were institutionalized\nResponseVariable\nThe respondents who answered yes to the question, \"Have\nyou ever experienced or are currently experiencing fractures\nfissures (femur, hips)?\" were coded 1 and others were coded\n0 for the variable hip fracture.\nPredictorVariables\nRisk factors of falls and hip fracture were selected as pre-\ndictor variables. A collection of potential risk factors along\nwith relevant references are displayed in Table 1. Potentially\nrelated factors and available variables in the NUJLSOA\nWave 1 including demographic and socioeconomic factors,\nmedical conditions, functional limitations and physical\nhealth, and environmental factors are also identified in this\ntable.\nDemographic and socioeconomic factors. Age and education\nwere included in the analyses. Age is a continuous variable.\nEducation was reported as the respondent's last education\nlevel completed and has six levels: (a) junior high school, (b)\nhigh school, (c) schools for specialized studies, (d) junior\ncollege, (e) university, and (f) graduate school. The educa-\ntion variables were dichotomized into (0) less than high\nschool or (1) higher than high school education due to the\nhighly skewed distribution showing that the majority of\nrespondents had high school or less education completed.\nMedical conditions and history. The indicators of demen-\ntia, heart problem, cancer, diabetes, cataracts, glaucoma,\narthritis, osteoporosis, and back pain were included in the\nanalysis. Each variable was coded whether the respondents\nhad the condition (1) or not (0). For medication use, the\ntotal number of internal prescribed medications and non-\nprescribed medications used were separately taken into\naccount. The external prescribed medications variable was\ndichotomized into the respondents who used at least one\nexternal prescribed medication (1) and those who did not\n(0) given the highly skewed distribution. When female\nrespondents gave birth to more than five children, they\nwere coded 1 and others 0.\nFunctional limitation and physical health characteristic.\nActivity of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activity of\ndaily living (IADL) were included as variables to assess\nfunctional limitations. The ADL variable corresponded to\nthe number of ADL problems associated with eating, dress-\ning, showering, getting out of bed, walking across room,\ngoing outside of house, and toileting experienced by an\nindividual. The IADL variable corresponded to the number\nof IADL problems, including difficulty with preparing\nmeals, shopping, taking care of bills, using telephone, clean-\ning, taking a bus, and managing medications. Body mass\nindex (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2. The\nvariable height (cm) was also taken into account. Variables\ngrasping with fingers and bending knee were coded 1 if the\nrespondents had difficulty performing or 0 if they did not,\nrespectively. A self-rated variable of overall health was\ncoded 1 if the respondents reported positive health as very\nhealthy, healthier than average, or average health, and the\nother was coded 0.\nEnvironmental factor. The variable rural was coded 1 if the\nrespondents reported living in farming or fishing village and\nwas coded 0 if they reported living in city or suburb areas.\nThis variable accounts for the geographical difference in\ndiet. Japanese people living in rural areas are more likely to\nhave higher salt intake than those in urban areas (Yamagu-\nchi, 1995). Higher salt intake is associated with lower bone\ndensity among postmenopausal women (Devine, Criddle,\nDick, Kerr, & Prince, 1995); therefore, it may be a relevant\nfactor of hip fracture (Suzuki et al., 1997).\nStatistical Methods\nSummary statistics for the predictor variables were com-\nputed for the respondents with hip fracture and those without\nhip fracture, separately for women and men. Means and\nstandard deviations for continuous variables, and percent-\nages for dichotomous variables were computed. Independent\nt tests were used to assess differences in means between\nthose with hip fracture and those without for continuous\nvariables, and chi-square tests were used to assess differ-\nences for categorical variables. Logistic regression was used\nto model the odds of hip fracture on demographic and socio-\neconomic factors, medical condition, functional limitation\nand physical health, lifestyle, and environmental factors\n(Hosmer & Lemeshow, 2004). All analyses were performed\nwith the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software version\n9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).\nResults\nTable 2 shows a comparison of predictor variables between\nindividuals with and without hip fracture stratified by gen-\nout of 4,967 or 7% of the respondents had at least one hip\nYamashita and Bailer 3\nfracture.

In older\nJapanese women, diabetes, difficulty bending their knee,\nand more ADL limitations were associated with increased\nrisk of hip fracture, whereas difficulty to grasp with fingers\nwas associated with lower risk. In addition, in older Japanese\nmen, cancer, use of external prescription drugs, and diffi-\nculty bending their knee were associated with increased risk\nof hip fracture, whereas back pain was associated with lower\nrisk.\nIn this study, age and education were not associated with\nhip fracture unlike some of the past studies (Wei, Hu, Wang,\n& Hwang, 2001). However, one Japanese study reported that\nage was not a risk factor of hip fracture (Yamanashi et al.,\n2005). Although age was not independently associated with\nrisk of hip fracture in this study, a number of factors that tend\nto increase with age seemed to be associated with increased\nrisk of hip fracture. For example, ADL limitations, back\npain, and use of prescription drugs generally increase with\nTable 3.

Indeed, these factors were independently associated\nwith risk of hip fracture in the current study. Education may\ninfluence the variables considered in this study but did not\nseem to be a direct risk factor of hip fracture.\nTwo chronic illnesses, diabetes and cancer, were associ-\nated with increased risk of hip fracture in women and men,\nrespectively. This finding supports some of the previous\nstudies. Schwartz et al. (2001) found that diabetics had a\ngreater risk of hip and proximal humerus fracture after\nadjusting for bone mineral density and demographic factors.\nIn addition, Mexican American older adults with diabetes\nwere at higher risks of hip fracture after adjusting for covari-\nates such as demographic factors and BMI (Ottenbacher,\nOstir, Peek, Goodwin, & Markides, 2002). Although the\noccurrence mechanism of how particular chronic illnesses\ninfluence hip fracture risk is still unclear, complications from\ndiabetes such as diabetes-related visual impairment, and/or\ncancer treatments including hormone therapy and androgen\ndeprivation therapy for particular cancers seem to indirectly\nincrease risk of hip fracture (Kanis, McCloskey, et al., 1999;\n2001). On a relevant note, more attention should be paid to\nother drugs (e.g., benzodiazepine) known to be associated\nwith fall risks, which may reflect existence of illnesses or\nother physical conditions along with particular chronic ill-\nnesses in addition to those examined in this study (Cummings\nDifficulty bending a knee was associated with increased\nrisk of hip fracture among older Japanese women and men.\nThere are two potential mechanisms that might explain this\nassociation. First, difficulty bending the knee presumably\nworks as a mediator of the relationship between falls and hip\nfracture (Nguyen, Pongchaiyakul, Center, Eisman, &\nNguyen, 2005). That is to say, not being able to bend the\nknee comfortably could result in instability of posture that\nmay lead to falls (Lord et al., 1994). Second, difficulty bend-\ning knee may have an influence on the trauma of one's hip\nwhen a fall occurs. Indeed, hitting the knee first on the\nground and changing direction of the fall can alleviate the\nimpact on hip and avoid hip fracture (Pinilla, Boardman,\nBouxsein, Myers, & Hayes, 1996; Runge, Rehfeld, &\nResnicek, 2000). This finding suggests that educating older\nadults about how to fall safely along with potential conse-\nquences of hip fracture may be a reasonable strategy as a\nfuture public health intervention. In addition, such findings\ncould help understand possible etiological explanations\nabout the associations between ADL, physical fitness, and\nfalls (Lau, Woo, Leung, & Swaminthan, 1993). Two protec-\ntive factors, difficulty grasping with fingers in women and\nback pain in men, are arguably related to lower activities lev-\nels, which may indicate lower risk of falls and, in turn, hip\nfracture.\nIt should be noted that osteoporosis was not associated\nwith risk of hip fracture in this study. In general, osteoporosis\nor lower bone mineral density is a definitive indicator of\nbone fragility (Cummings & Melton, 2002). Whereas osteo-\nporosis is reported as a risk factor of hip fracture (Lau et al.,\nies (Kanis, Johnell, et al., 1999). It may be possible that\nosteoporosis would be a risk factor only when there was a\nsignificant impact on one's hip like when one falls.\nThere are several important contributions from the find-\nings in this study. First, this study examined hip fracture risk\nfactors in the understudied older Japanese population. Given\nthe lower prevalence of hip fracture comparing with Western\nnations, only a few studies have focused on hip fracture at\nthe population level in Japan while it still is a serious public\nhealth problem. Second, this study identified different risk\nfactors of hip fracture for older Japanese women and men.\nMost previous studies considered gender as a risk factor or\nfocused only on either women or men. Last, no previous\nstudy examined risk factors of hip fracture with NUJLSOA,\nwhich is one of a few publicly available large data sets of\nJapanese older adults. Secondary data analysis using nation-\nally representative data in aging population is not yet com-\nmon in Japanese hip fracture studies.\nSome limitations in this study should be noted. First,\nJapanese specific cultural aspects were not taken into\naccount. Although not examined in this study, typical but\ndistinctive Japanese diets such as fish, tofu, and natto (fer-\nmented soybeans), and use of Japanese traditional futon are\npossible protective factors of fracture (Suzuki et al., 1997).\nSecond, although we identified risk factors for hip fracture,\nthe predictive accuracy of logistic regression models in this\nstudy may not be sufficient for routine use. Follow-up analy-\nses using the area under the receiver operating characteristic\ncurve (AUC) showed the moderate predictive accuracy,\nimprove by incorporating omitted risk factors of hip fracture\nback pain requires caution as the estimated odds ratio was\nsmall although statistically significant. Finally, the\nNUJLSOA does not include information about timing of hip\nfracture and possible consequences (e.g., functional limita-\ntions). Therefore, any causal inference or examination of hip\nfracture treatment outcomes was not possible. However, the\nrespondents were community-dwelling older adults who are\nstill at risk of hip fracture. In this regard, identification of\nrisk factors regardless of previous hip fracture experience is\nmeaningful. Although this study included a single wave of\ndata, as further consecutive waves of NUJLSOA become\navailable, longitudinal analyses may allow for the inclusion\nof additional risk factors including a previous history of\nfalls.\nIn conclusion, this study identified risk factors of hip frac-\nture by developing hip fracture prediction models separately\nfor older Japanese women and men using the nationally rep-\nresentative data. Diabetes, difficulty to bend knee, difficulty\nto grasp with fingers (protective factor), and ADL limitations\nwere associated with risk of hip fracture among older\nYamashita and Bailer 7\nJapanese women. Cancer, use of external prescribed drugs,\nback pain (protective factor), and difficulty to bend knee\nwere associated with increased risk of hip fracture among\nolder Japanese men. These identified risk factors including\nphysical impairments and functional limitations, and their\ncausal pathways to hip fracture need to be further examined\nwith consideration of gender difference and specific cultural\naspects of study populations in future research.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlexander, B.
