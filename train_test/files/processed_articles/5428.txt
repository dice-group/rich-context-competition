Consumers have to exercise their\ncapacity for self-control in order to make optimal choices,\nwhether it is choosing a healthy, lean green salad instead of\na scrumptious, double-layered chocolate cake; or prioritiz-\ning practicality over luxury when shopping for a product,\nself-control is required in order to override impulses, over-\ncome temptations, and forego short-term gratifications in\nfavor of the more beneficial long-term goals (De Ridder\net al., 2012). However, consumers often do not exercise\nself-control to warrant well-considered choices and thor-\noughly processed decisions (Bargh, 2002; Wansink and\nSobal, 2007). In a state of low self-control, consumers make\nchoices that offer immediate gratification that may under-\nmine their long-term interests. For instance, they make more\nunplanned purchases (Vohs and Faber, 2007) and buy more\nunhealthy snacks impulsively (Honkanen et al., 2012).\nFurthermore, while consumers' decision-making process\ninvolves both cognition and affect, such that a virtuous\nchoice like a healthy choice might not always be the product\nof \"cold\" cognition and exclusively void of affect (and vice\nversa for an unhealthy choice), research appears to converge\nthat under low self-control consumers are typically more\nswayed by affective features of a product than by cognitive\nconsiderations (Bruyneel et al., 2006). Accordingly, in order\nto circumvent such negative outcomes, an important under-\ntaking would be to mitigate low self-control in order to\nfacilitate better consumption choices that are in line with\nlong-term interests. However, deviating from traditional\napproaches, the current research proposes to work with,\nrather than against, consumer's low self-control. Earlier\nwork by Fennis et al. (2009) has suggested that consumers\nin states of low self-control become more susceptible to\ncomplying with marketing strategies based on influence\nprinciples (i.e. reciprocity, liking, and consistency). In light\nPut a limit on it: The protective\neffects of scarcity heuristics when\nself-control is low\nTracy TL Cheung1, Floor M Kroese1, Bob M Fennis2\nand Denise TD De Ridder1\n Keywords\nconsumer wellbeing, heuristic, impulsiveness, scarcity, self-control\n1Utrecht University, The Netherlands\n2University of Groningen, The Netherlands\nCorresponding author:\nTracy TL Cheung, Utrecht University, Heidelberglaan 1, De Uithof,\nEmail: t.t.l.cheung@uu.nl\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nof this, in the current research, we investigate whether the\ninfluence principle of scarcity, a classic \"weapon of influ-\nence\" (Cialdini, 2008) that has yet to be tested in conditions\nof low self-control, can be used to guide consumers in low\nself-control states toward choices that foster their long-term\ninterests. That is, we question whether scarcity endorsed\nby marketing appeals would invariantly lead to negative\nchoices when self-control is low (i.e. choices that favor\nimmediate gratification over long-term goals). Instead, the\ncurrent research argues the opposite and aims to showcase\nscarcity as a strategic tool, rather than a lethal weapon, used\nin low self-control conditions to promote choices (e.g.\nhealthy food choices and utilitarian products with long-term\nvalue) that would benefit consumers' long-term interests.\nThrough two studies, the current research first demonstrates\nthe influence of the general scarcity principle in low self-\ncontrol and subsequently compares the effectiveness of two\nspecific types of scarcity--supply scarcity versus demand\nscarcity--on consumers low in self-control.\nLow self-control and heuristics\nA state of low self-control is proposed to occur because of\nprevious volitional acts of self-control (or \"willpower\")\ndepleting a single, common limited resource, and ego-\ndepletion has been termed to describe the phenomenon of\nself-control failure due to previous exertion (Baumeister\net al., 1998). Although this conceptualization of self-con-\ntrol is not undisputed (Carter and McCullough, 2013;\nthere is considerable experimental support that exercising\nself-control in an initial task results in impaired subsequent\nself-control performance in a second, seemingly unrelated\ntask (for a review, see Hagger et al., 2010). When individu-\nals are depleted and low in self-control, they tend to respond\nin a more acquiescent and passive manner (Wheeler et al.,\n2007), as they are also more likely to resort to easier courses\nof action that are low-effort, habitual, and automatic\n(Janssen et al., 2008). Considering that heuristics act as\nrules-of-thumb and mental shortcuts that facilitate deci-\nsion-making by reducing time, cognitive effort, and the\nquantity of information to be processed (Shah and\nOppenheimer, 2008), it is not difficult to imagine why heu-\nristics are highly attractive in states of low self-control.\nWhile previous research has shown people to increas-\ningly rely on heuristics during decision-making under low\nself-control conditions (Pocheptsova et al., 2009; Pohl\net al., 2013), the current research is the first to examine\nwhether these findings generalize to the influence principle\nof scarcity. The influence principle of scarcity is frequently\nendorsed by marketers for product promotions (e.g.\n\"Limited Time Offer!\"; \"Selling out fast! Get yours now\nwhile supplies last!\"), because consumers often perceive\nscarce products as more valuable than products that are\nthe limited availability of a product is considered as a cue\nto the quality of the product, scarcity accordingly operates\nas a heuristic (Cialdini, 2008). The current research pre-\ndicts consumers low in self-control to be increasingly prone\nto the effects of the scarcity heuristic. Furthermore, the cur-\nrent research proposes that by working with consumers'\nsusceptibility to heuristic-based thinking in low self-con-\ntrol conditions, a scarcity heuristic could be used to pro-\nmote better (i.e. long-term oriented) consumption choices.\nAccordingly, in Study 1, the goal is to first demonstrate that\nthe effect of scarcity would be especially enhanced in states\nof low self-control by testing the hypothesis that consumers\nlow in self-control would select more healthy food choices\nif they were promoted by a scarcity heuristic emphasizing\nlimited availability\nNonetheless, while scarcity in general emphasizes the\nlimited availability of a certain product, it could be driven\nby different circumstances such as supply or demand (Gierl\net al., 2008). It is important to draw the distinction between\nthese two types of scarcity because while both supply and\ndemand scarcity enhance product desirability, they operate\nthrough different inference processes. Supply scarcity is\nprimarily due to short supply, for example, when a vendor\nis restricting the time period that a product is available (e.g.\n\"Limited time offer!\"). When the scarcity of a product is\nconveyed through supply, consumers use this as a heuristic\ninferring that the product is valuable due to its exclusivity.\nIn contrast, demand scarcity occurs when there is a high\namount of prior product purchases. By emphasizing that\nscarcity of a product is caused by demand (e.g. \"Selling out\nfast! Get yours now while supplies last!\"), consumers use\nthis as a heuristic cueing a product is particularly popular\namong many others (Van Herpen et al., 2014). Study 2 spe-\ncifically compares the effects of supply scarcity versus\ndemand scarcity in the context of low self-control condi-\ntions. Intuitively, one may predict supply scarcity to be\nmore potent than demand scarcity due to its presumed\nimpact on perceived product exclusivity (Van Herpen et al.,\n2014), but the reverse might actually be the case. More spe-\ncifically, while the impact of supply scarcity on product\ndesirability seems straightforward, an early meta-analysis\nsuggesting that while effective, the extent to which supply\nscarcity might trigger and satisfy the increased reward\nsensitivity that has been shown to be associated with\nconditions of low self-control (Inzlicht and Schmeichel,\nscarcity, in contrast, might prove to be particularly effective\nunder low self-control conditions. That is, as a heuristic,\ndemand scarcity suggests that the limited availability of a\nproduct is due to its popularity among many others. This\ninference may resonate well with individuals low in self-\ncontrol. Evidently, many people have chosen this product\npreviously, and while this may convey a high-quality\nproduct, it might also signal something else--a descriptive\nCheung et al. 3\nnorm (Cialdini et al., 1991). The observation that a product\nis unavailable due to popular demand suggests what is the\ntypical and prevalent behavior in that specific context and\ncritically functions as a cue to convey what is probably\nattractive or immediately advantageous for the individual\n(Jacobson et al., 2011). Corroborating the impact of descrip-\ntive norms in a different context, in a series of studies\nJacobson et al. (2011) have indeed found compelling evi-\ndence that descriptive (but not injunctive) norms proved\nparticularly effective in fostering conformity when people\nwere low in self-control. Extrapolating from these findings\nto the current context, the current research therefore posits\nthat scarcity cues that imply a descriptive norm (i.e. demand\nscarcity) should prove to be more effective than scarcity\ncues without such normative information (i.e. supply scar-\ncity) in low self-control conditions. Hence, Study 2 tests\nthe hypothesis that in low self-control conditions, both a\nsupply scarcity heuristic and a demand scarcity heuristic\nwould be effective in promoting utilitarian products with\nmore long-term value, but that a demand scarcity heuristic\nwould work even better.\nIn summary, the current research examines the effects of\nscarcity in low self-control conditions. The current research\nexpects consumers low in self-control to be susceptible to\nthe effects of scarcity in general, but that a demand scarcity\nheuristic would be particularly more potent compared to a\nsupply scarcity heuristic. Furthermore, in light of the exist-\ning literature that typically portrays low self-control in a\nnegative light, in which under such a state consumers easily\nsuccumb to \"bad\" temptations, the current research aims\nto take advantage of low self-control conditions by employ-\ning scarcity heuristics to facilitate \"better\" consumption\nchoices that are typically not the default choice in low self-\ncontrol conditions (i.e. healthy food choices in Study 1 and\nutilitarian consumer goods in Study 2). Foreshadowing our\nresults, the two studies in the current research reveal that\ninterventions could be designed to work with low self-con-\ntrol, and that the principle of scarcity would be a promising\nand convenient strategy to promote better choices that are\nin line with long-term benefits.\nExtending on the existing literature that consumers are gen-\nerally sensitive to the influence of heuristics, Study 1 aims\nto show that low levels of self-control would accentuate the\ninfluence of scarcity even more.Accordingly, as a first step,\nStudy 1 tests the effectiveness of using scarcity as a heuris-\ntic in promoting healthy food products in low self-control\nconditions. Specifically, Study 1 employs a food choice\ntask where consumers make a choice between two products\n(e.g. healthy vs unhealthy food) over a series of product\npairs. The main hypothesis is that when no heuristic is pre-\nsent to promote the healthy food choices, participants low\nin self-control would favor the tasty, but unhealthy food\noptions (i.e. opting for immediate gratification). However,\na scarcity heuristic might counter this typical low self-\ncontrol effect. In order to be more confident in attributing\nthe effectiveness of the scarcity heuristic exclusively to the\nconditions of low self-control, Study 1 included a number\nof potential covariates. Specifically, Study 1 included Need\nfor Cognition (NFC), which refers to the motivation for\ndeliberate and thoughtful thinking on a chronic level, as it\nhas been shown to be related to consumers'susceptibility to\nperipheral cues such as heuristics in the formation of prod-\nuct preferences (Haugtvedt et al. 1992). In addition, Study\n1 also took into account of consumer characteristics (i.e.\nfrequency of purchasing food products on offer, extent to\neat healthily, and frequency of purchasing healthy food\nproducts) that may influence participants' food choices.\nMethod\nParticipants.Participants were 67 individuals living in the\nUnited States recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk.\nThree participants did not indicate demographic information\nincluding age, gender, level of education, and current\nemployment status. The mean age of the remaining partici-\n=\npercent of the sample. Furthermore, 1.6\npercent of the\nsample received no formal schooling, 17.2\npercent were\neducated up to high school level, 67.2\npercent completed a\ncollege or university degree, and 14\npercent received post-\nbachelor's education. When reporting current employment\nstatus, 56.3percent of participants were employed for wages,\npercent were self-employed, 9.4\npercent were out of\nwork and currently looking for work, 1.6percent were out of\nwork and currently not looking for work, 6.3\npercent were\npercent were students, 4.7\npercent were\nretired, and 3.1percent were unable to work.\nDesign and procedure.The design of Study 1 consisted of\ntwo independent variables, where scarcity (scarcity heuris-\ntic vs no heuristic) was a within-subjects factor manipulated\nin the food choice task, and self-control was a between-sub-\njects continuous predictor. The dependent variable was the\nnumber of healthy choices made in the food choice task.\nParticipants were informed that they would complete\nthree unrelated questionnaires related to consumer prefer-\nences, but there was no explicit mentioning that they would\nbe first filling out the State Self-Control Scale (SSCS)\n(Ciarocco et al., 2012), followed by the food choice task,\nand finally the NFC Scale (Cacioppo et al., 1989) in addi-\ntion to four questions that assessed consumer characteris-\ntics. Upon completion of all questionnaires, participants\nwere thanked and received a code to confirm their partici-\npation for monetary compensation.\nFood choice task.The food choice task was presented as\na marketing survey that assessed consumer preferences.\n4 Health Psychology Open \nParticipants were informed that they had to evaluate a series\nof products presented in pairs by indicating their preferred\nchoice of product from each pair. In total, participants evalu-\nated 24 product pairs. Of interest were 12 food product pairs\nthat presented a self-control dilemma, in which a healthy\nfood product was paired with a tastier but relatively\nunhealthy food product. To illustrate, the food pairs included\nexamples such as ice-cream versus Greek yogurt, salad ver-\nsus pizza, cereal bar versus Oreo cookie, and donuts versus\nrice crackers. Finally, the remaining 12 product pairs acted\nas filler pairs that were not further analyzed.\nIndependent variables\nScarcity. The scarcity heuristic was conveyed with the pro-\nmotion tagline \"Value of the week, while supplies last!\"\nThe scarcity heuristic was presented in six of the food prod-\nuct pairs in the food choice task, and it was always associ-\nated with the healthy food option. In the remaining six food\nproduct pairs, there was no heuristic, and no information\nwas provided about the food products.\nState self-control. State self-control was measured using the\nSSCS (Ciarocco et al., 2012), which was presented as a\nquestionnaire on mood. Participants were asked to indicate\nthe degree to which they agreed (1=not true, 7=very true)\nwith 25 statements that described their current state such\nas \"I feel motivated\" and \"I feel like my willpower is\ngone\" (reverse coded) on the SSCS. A final standardized\nstate self-control score was calculated by averaging the\nscores from all the statements, where a higher scored\nreflected a higher level of state self-control. Cronbach's\nalpha () of .96 reported good internal consistency for the\nSSCS in this study.\nDependent variable.The dependent variable was the aver-\nage number of healthy choices made from the food pairs\nthat had a scarcity heuristic and the food pairs that had no\nheuristic in the food choice task, both ranging from 0 to 6.\nControl variables. Study 1 controlled for the potential influ-\nence that the NFC, as well as the other consumer charac-\nteristics, may have on the dependent variable of healthy\nchoices.\nNFC Scale.The NFC Scale (Cacioppo et al., 1984) con-\nsisted of 25 statements in which participants had to indicate\nthe degree to which each statement described them\n(1=extremely uncharacteristic of me, 4=extremely charac-\nteristic of me). Statements on the scale included examples\nsuch as \"I prefer complex to simple problems\" and \"I would\nrather do something that requires little thought than some-\nthing that is sure to challenge my thinking abilities\" (reverse\ncoded). A final standardized NFC score was calculated by\naveraging the scores from all the statements, where a higher\nscored reflected a greater NFC. Cronbach's  of .94 reported\ngood internal consistency for the NFC Scale in this study.\nConsumer characteristics.Additional questions including\n(1) \"How often do you purchase food products on offer or\npromotion?\", (2) \"To what extent do you try to eat health-\nily?\", and (3) \"How often do you purchase healthy food\nproducts?\" were included to control for individual differ-\nences that may affect consumers'food choices. Participants\nresponded to these four one-time questions on a 7-point\nscale ranging from 1 (never) to 7 (always). The scores to\neach of the three questions were standardized.\nResults\nDescriptives.Participants reported purchasing food prod-\nfrequently. Moreover, they also reported eating healthily to\nhealthy food products on a relatively frequent basis\nage of 5.6 healthy food products (SD\n=\nfood choice pairs.\nEffects of a scarcity heuristic on healthy food choices.A\nrepeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)\nwas employed to examine the effects of a general scarcity\nheuristic on participants' healthy food choices, in which\nscarcity (no heuristic vs scarcity heuristic) was a within-\nsubjects factor and state self-control was a continuous\npredictor. Furthermore, in addition to controlling for the\npotential influence of NFC, consumer characteristics\nincluding participants' extent of healthy eating (r=.57,\np<.001) and frequency of purchasing healthy food prod-\nucts (r=.45, p<.001) were included as covariates since\nthey were significantly correlated with the dependent\nvariable.\nThere was a significant main effect of scarcity, where\nmore healthy choices were made in food pairs that had a\n=\n.08). Results also indi-\ncated that NFC was not a significant covariate (F(1,\n=\n.56). Moreover, the extent to which partici-\nhad an influence on the number of healthy choices, but not\non the frequency to which participants purchase healthy\nthere was a significant interaction between scarcity and\nParameter estimates indicate that when there was a scarcity\nheuristic, the number of healthy food choices increased as\np\n=\n.03. However, self-control had no influence on the\nCheung et al. 5\noutcome of healthy choices made when there was no heu-\nDiscussion\nThe predicted interaction with the scarcity heuristic proved\nto be significant--when there was a scarcity heuristic pro-\nmoting the healthy food options, low self-control levels\nfacilitated the number of healthy choices made while con-\ntrolling for the effects of consumers' reported extent to\nwhich they try to eat healthily. On the other hand, when the\nscarcity heuristic was not present, results did not show evi-\ndence of a negative trend between self-control and healthy\nfood choices. Additionally, as NFC was not a significant\ncovariate in our analysis, Study 1 could more confidently\nrule out that the increased use of heuristic was dependent\non NFC, and that the use of the scarcity heuristic could be\nattributed to low self-control.\nThese findings serve as first evidence that consumers low\nin self-control would especially benefit from having the\ninstallation of a scarcity in the environment to market health-\nier food choices. Nonetheless, the scarcity heuristic used in\nStudy 1 was ambiguous with regard to whether the scarcity\nwas driven by high demand or low supply (or both).As such,\nwhile Study 1 demonstrated the influence of scarcity (in gen-\neral) in promoting healthy food choices especially in low\nlevels of self-control, it does not inform whether supply or\ndemand scarcity was driving this effect. Another shortcom-\ning of Study 1 is that due to its within-subjects design, each\nfood pair was only presented once with (or without) a scar-\ncity heuristic and not counterbalanced. Moreover, Study 1\nassessed self-control using self-report measures.\nOvercoming the limitations of Study 1, Study 2 pits the\ntwo variants of scarcity directly against each other: supply\nversus demand scarcity and compares their effectiveness\nin the context of low self-control. Moreover, Study 2\nexperimentally manipulates self-control and adopts a\nbetween-subjects design that includes a control condition\nwhere all product pairs are presented without a heuristic\nadjunct to two other experimental heuristic conditions. If\nthe reasoning for predictions was correct, then both sup-\nply and demand scarcity heuristics would be effective\nunder low self-control conditions, but we expect the\ndemand scarcity heuristic to exceed the effects of a supply\nscarcity heuristic.\nStudy 2 compares the effectiveness of the supply scarcity and\ndemand scarcity in promoting utilitarian products over\nhedonic products, testing the hypothesis that demand scarcity\nwould be more effective in low self-control conditions\nconsidering that it not only enhances product desirability but\nalso conveys a descriptive norm that individuals low in self-\ncontrol are highly sensitive to; whereas the supply scarcity\nonly infers product desirability information without confer-\nring the behavior of other people. Additionally, Study 2\nexamines whether the use of scarcity heuristics could extend\nto promoting utilitarian products that offer long-term practi-\ncal value over hedonic products that bestow short-term indul-\ngence (Dhar andWertenbroch, 2000). Generally, it is expected\nthat participants in low self-control conditions would prefer\nthe attractive hedonic products with indulgent properties\nunless they are accompanied by a scarcity heuristic. More\nimportantly, Study 2 aims to demonstrate that a demand scar-\ncity heuristic works better than a supply scarcity heuristic.\nMethod\nParticipants and design.A total of 165 participants were\nrecruited from a large university in The Netherlands. The\nThe sample consisted exclusively of females to minimize\nthe potential influence of gender on product preferences.\nThe study used a 2 (self-control: low vs high)\n\u00d73 (heuris-\ntics: no heuristic vs supply scarcity heuristic vs demand\nscarcity heuristic) between-subjects design.\nProcedure.The study was presented as two separate tasks,\nthe first being the Stroop Task employed as a self-control\nmanipulation and the second being a product choice task\npresented as a marketing study that assessed participants'\nchoice between utilitarian versus hedonic products. Upon\narrival in the laboratory, participants provided informed\nconsent for their participation and were assigned to a cubicle\nwhere they completed both tasks on the computer. At the\nend of the experiment, participants were thanked, debriefed,\nand compensated with course credit of 4 for participation.\nManipulations\nSupply scarcity heuristic and demand scarcity heuristic.The\nscarcity heuristics were always associated with the utilitarian\nFigure 1. Healthy food choices made as a function of scarcity\nheuristic and self-control.\n6 Health Psychology Open \nproducts in the product choice task. The supply scarcity heu-\nristic was depicted by the slogan \"Available only this week!\"\nIn the demand scarcity heuristic condition, participants were\ntold that some products were particularly popular with par-\nticipants and were therefore low in stock. It was then pre-\nsented with the slogan \"Popular item, while supplies last!\"\nFinally, in the no heuristic condition, participants were solely\npresented with product pairs without any accompanying\nheuristics.\nSelf-control.Unlike Study 1 that measured self-control\nbased on self-report, Study 2 experimentally manipulated\nparticipants' self-control levels. The Stroop Task was\nemployed in this study to manipulate self-control levels fol-\nlowing previous research (e.g. Govorun and Payne, 2006;\nHalali et al., 2014) that has also used this paradigm to\ndeplete participants. Participants were presented with a\nseries of color words (i.e. red, blue, yellow, and green) on\nthe computer screen; each of which was displayed in a font\ncolor that either matched (congruent trial) or did not match\nits semantic meaning (incongruent trial). Every trial began\nwith a fixation cross at the center of the screen (500\nms),\nfollowed by the presentation of the color word (200\nms),\nand participants had 800ms to indicate the font color of the\nword by pressing the designated key on the keyboard.\nAll participants completed 12 practice trials in order to\nfamiliarize themselves with the task and were then equally\ndistributed to either the high or low self-control condition\nby randomization. In the high self-control condition, par-\nticipants performed a total of 30 congruent trials that lasted\nfor approximately 5minutes. In the low self-control condi-\ntion, however, participants performed a total of 300 trials\ndivided over three blocks, where two-thirds of the trials\nwere incongruent trials dispersed randomly throughout the\ntask. In order to correctly identify the font color of the\nword, participants would have to exercise self-control to\nsuppress the automatic and predominant response of read-\ning (i.e. Stroop effect). The length of the low self-control\ncondition was approximately 15minutes.\nProduct choice task. The product choice task was presented\nas an online marketing study that assessed consumer pref-\nerences. The product choice task consisted of eight product\npairs presented in a randomized order, and five out of the\neight product pairs were hedonic\u00adutilitarian trade-off\npairs. The hedonic\u00adutilitarian product trade-off pairs rep-\nresented a self-control dilemma, as participants would\nhave to exercise self-control in order to forego the indulg-\ning properties of the hedonic product (e.g. make-up set)\nand select the more practical but less attractive utilitarian\nproduct (e.g. first-aid kit; Mishra and Mishra, 2011). These\nproduct trade-off pairs were pretested, and the mean values\nand SDs are presented in Tables 1 and 2. The remaining\nthree product pairs were filler pairs that were not further\nanalyzed.\nParticipants were asked to indicate which of the two\nproducts they would prefer at that moment and were also\ninformed that it was not necessary to deliberate over the\noptions as the survey was only interested in consumer pref-\nerences, and that there were no objective correct answers.\nTo increase participants' engagement in the product task,\nparticipants were told the cover story that they would\nreceive one of the product choices that they selected at the\nend of the experiment. The cover story was also conveyed\nto increase the credibility of the scarcity heuristics--that\nsome products are only available this week (i.e. supply\nscarcity) or that some products are low in stock because\nthey are especially popular with previous participants (i.e.\ndemand scarcity). The dependent variable was the number\nof utilitarian choices made from the trade-off product pairs,\nranging from 0 to 6.\nResults\nFive participants who had missing data in the Stroop Task\nand five other participants who performed the Stroop Task\nwith an accuracy of 0percent were excluded in the analy-\nses. The resulting sample in the analysis consisted of 155\nparticipants.\nTable 1.

Specifically, it was observed that in the low\nself-control condition, participants made more utilitarian\nproduct choices promoted by a demand scarcity heuristic,\nas opposed to when no heuristic was present. Moreover, the\ndemand scarcity heuristic seemed to offer \"protective\neffects\" against the pitfalls of low self-control--in the pres-\nence of demand scarcity, participants in the low self-control\ncondition selected just as many utilitarian choices as par-\nticipants in the high self-control condition. However, par-\nticipants low in self-control were not as receptive to the\nsupply scarcity heuristic that promoted the utilitarian prod-\nucts, in which they still selected fewer utilitarian products\nin the low self-control condition compared to the high self-\ncontrol condition.\nThe finding in Study 2 that the demand scarcity heuris-\ntic was more influential supports previous finding that\nindividuals low in self-control tend to conform with\ndescriptive norms (Jacobson et al. 2011). This serves as a\nreminder that perhaps while all heuristics generally func-\ntion as decisional shortcuts, the way they operate is not\nthe same, at least in the context of low self-control condi-\ntions. As such, the degree of the effectiveness of different\nheuristics should not be assumed to be equal without con-\nsidering the context that they are performing in, and con-\nsumers low in self-control may ultimately benefit more\nfrom certain heuristics (e.g. demand scarcity heuristic)\nthan from others.\nGeneral discussion\nThis study explored the potential of using scarcity heuristics\nto promote healthy food choices and utilitarian products\nwith long-term benefits for consumers lacking self-control\nwho would generally opt out for alternatives with short-term\ngratification. The current research demonstrated that by\nmeasuring state levels of self-control (Study 1) and experi-\nmentally manipulating self-control (Study 2), consumers\nlow in self-control benefited from having scarcity heuristics\nguide their decisions toward more optimal choices. Study 1\nfound that lower levels of self-control actually increased\nconsumers' choices for healthy food choices in the presence\nof scarcity. Building off this finding, Study 2 distinguishes\nbetween the demand scarcity heuristic and the supply scar-\ncity heuristic by comparing their effectiveness in promoting\nutilitarian choices, in which results indicated the superiority\nof the former in low self-control conditions. Our finding that\nthe demand scarcity heuristic was more influential in low\nself-control conditions is in line with the notion that low\nself-control is associated with increased reward sensitivity\nalso corroborates previous research that has found individu-\nals low in self-control to favor and conform to descriptive\nnorms (Jacobson et al., 2011). Although Experiment 1 pre-\nsented food choices whereas Experiment 2 presented generic\nconsumer goods, the similar pattern of results observed in\nboth studies thereby reveals the robustness of the effect of\nlow self-control leading to a \"virtuous\" choice given that it\nispromotedbyanappropriatescarcityheuristic.Nonetheless,\ngiven the importance of health promotion in the current\nobesogenic environment, we particularly welcome future\nstudies to replicate and extend on our current research to\nfurther examine and validate the effectiveness of scarcity\nheuristics to promote healthy food choices. Specially, our\nfinding that the demand scarcity heuristic was more influ-\nential also dovetails the recent study by Salmon et al.\n(2014) who showed that people low in self-control were\nmuch more likely to base their food choices on the sugges-\ntion of a descriptive norm (i.e. a pie chart showing the\nbehavior of the majority of previous participants making a\nhealthy choice) that acted as a social proof heuristic.\nCorrespondingly, it may be that the demand scarcity heuris-\ntic similarly provides a social proof mechanism. In light of\nthis, it would be interesting to question whether the social\ninformation conveyed by these particular heuristics (i.e.\ndemand scarcity heuristic, social proof heuristic) might be\nthe key ingredient to its success. As such, future research\ncould shed insight by comparing heuristics that contain a\nsocial component (e.g. authority, reciprocity) with heuristics\nthat only convey an exemplar without any social aspect (e.g.\navailability, recognition). Moreover, future effort should\nmore stringently consider how to optimally design and max-\nimize the effectiveness of heuristics in low self-control con-\nditions. In the case of scarcity heuristics, it is critical to\nensure that scarcity information offers believability (e.g. is\nthe scarcity understood and perceived to be legitimate?),\nchoice (e.g. do people still feel a sense of freedom to choice\nwithout feeling threatened or coerced?), and alternatives\n(e.g. do they need it? Are there substitutes?) (Mortensen and\nCheung et al. 9\nAllen, 2013). If these criteria are not met, there is a chance\nthat the heuristic will backfire and induce the opposite\ndesired effects.\nWhile there is a positive outlook regarding the usefulness\nof heuristics, it should nonetheless be acknowledged that the\ncurrentresearchreliedonlyonhypotheticalchoices(although\nStudy 2 attempted to simulate a real product choice task and\nincrease participant engagement by informing participants\nthat they would receive one of the product choices they\nmake). Similarly, in real-life contexts, price is an important\ndeterminant of purchase decisions and as such in considering\nconsumers'choices, future research should take into account\nhow socio-economic factors might interact with behavioral\nfactors such as the ones showcased in this study. For one, it\nwould be important to include broader samples of individu-\nals with diverse socio-economic backgrounds. Furthermore,\nit has been criticized that the dichotomy of consumption\nchoices, prevalently applied to food choices where \"healthy\"\nis considered the good choice and the \"unhealthy\" alterna-\ntive is considered the bad choice, is misleading since there is\nand should be much uncertainty in what defines \"good\" food\nand\"bad\"foodinrelationtohealthandwellbeing(Askegaard\net al., 2014). As such, to improve and extend on the current\nresearch, it is recommended that future studies expand the\nlist of choice outcomes from one-off dichotomized choices\nto more comprehensive measures such as options from an\nentire meal (menus), food diaries recorded over time spans,\nand shopping lists that resemble more closely with real-life\nand naturalistic settings. Employing such measures rather\nthan relying on one-off binary choice outcomes not only\nincreases ecological validity but also allows for directing\nfocus on moderation and the balance of choices, which are\ncrucial for health and wellbeing.\nHaving to process considerable amounts of information\nand make countless decisions on a daily basis, consumers\noften rely on heuristics to help them to think in ways that are\nquickandeasy(Kahnemanetal.,1982;ToddandGigerenzer,\n2007), while heuristic-based thinking is execrated when\nself-control levels are low (Pocheptsova et al., 2009).\nIt is no coincidence that marketing campaigns frequently\nendorse heuristic principles to entice consumers into buying\nproducts to increase profit. However, the first implication of\nthe current research is that the same factors (e.g. low self-\ncontrol) that lead consumers to making an impulsive or sub-\noptimal choice could be reversed into an impulsive but\nvirtuous choice. Indeed, the current research exploited low\nself-control conditions and employed conventional market-\ning tactics that endorse scarcity heuristics in promoting \"vir-\ntuous\" product choices that would support consumers'\nlong-term interests. This approach deviates from traditional\ninterventions that focus on increasing self-control and\ninstead showcases low self-control as a state that could be\nfavorable to consumer welfare. Consumers low in self-con-\ntrol would indeed make the \"right\" choice in line with long-\nterm interests if the choice setting offers suitable heuristics\npromoting them. As Study 1 showed, simply associating\nhealthy food products with scarcity led to more healthy\nchoices made by consumers low in self-control. This strat-\negy could be easily extrapolated from an experimental set-\nting and be implemented as in-store ads or displays as part\nof health promotion campaigns aimed at healthy eating.\nNonetheless, critical to underscore is that certain heuristics\nmay be more suitable in low self-control conditions. The\nobservation in Study 2 that the demand scarcity heuristic\nperformed best overall puts forth an additional implication.\nIt appears that using limited availability to emphasize prod-\nuct value and presenting a descriptive norm as a social proof\ncomponent to attest to its value may be important ingredi-\nents for the successful promotion of virtuous consumption\nchoices in low self-control conditions. That is, when con-\nsumers are seeking to buy a utilitarian product, for example,\nthe demand scarcity acts as a heuristic for consumers to\nform an accurate judgment of product performance through\nsocial proof information (e.g. the probability that so many\nbuyers would purchase a bad product would be unlikely;\nDeviating from traditional approaches that target at rais-\ning self-control, our strategy of working with low self-con-\ntrol conditions through the use of scarcity heuristics lends\nitself as a promising tactic that could be publicly imple-\nmented on a large scale to promote consumer welfare.\nImportantly, the use of scarcity heuristics to promote\nhealthy food products or utilitarian consumer goods (with-\nout forbidding their alternatives) aligns well with the call\nfor optimizing choice architectures to encourage more opti-\nmal consumption choices (Johnson et al., 2012).\nConclusion\nThe current research began by asking whether following\nscarcity heuristics endorsed by advertising appeals would\ninvariantly lead consumers into choices that mainly benefit\nthe interests of the marketeer rather than the wellbeing of\nthe consumers. By working with low self-control conditions\nthat facilitate heuristic-based thinking, which is typically seen\nas a vice that inevitably leads to suboptimal choices, the cur-\nrent research found that the influence principle of scarcity\nwas able to promote better consumption choices that would\nbenefit consumers'long-term interests. In this light, low self-\ncontrol is not necessarily a state that should be avoided, and\nthat scarcity could also be employed as a strategic tool, rather\nthan a weapon of influence, in promoting better consumption\nchoices for consumers low in self-control. Nonetheless, as\nsome tools are sharper than others, our findings also indicate\nthe demand scarcity heuristic, which highlights reward\nemphasis and provides descriptive norm information, to be\nmore effective than the supply scarcity heuristic in promoting\nutilitarian consumer goods in the context of low self-control.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\n10 Health Psychology Open \nFunding\nThe research reported in the article was funded by the European\nCommission's Framework Programme 7, People Action, through\nthe Marie Curie Initial training Network CONsumer Competence\nResearch Training (CONCORT; www.concort-project.eu) under\nReferences\nAskegaard S, Ordabayeva N, Chandon P, et al.
