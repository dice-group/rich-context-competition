Rapidly falling fertility in these\nWestern countries, many scholars argued, could be explained by the massive entry\nof women into the extra-domestic labor force. Others, doubting that a purely\neconomic approach would prove adequate, identified basic culture change as\ngenerating very low fertility. Along these lines, Second Demographic Transition\n(SDT) theorists pointed to a shift in cultural values linked both to a move away from\nfamilism toward self-realization and a shift from religious attachments toward\nsecularism.\nThe fact that by the early 1990s Italy and Spain emerged as the countries with the\nlowest fertility proved a major surprise, if not an embarrassment. In the European\ncontext, both countries showed unusually low rates of female labor force\nparticipation (FLFP) and relatively strong family bonds and religious institutions.\nAs Chesnais (1998, p. 91) pointed out, ``No official population forecast, either\nnational or international, had anticipated a total fertility rate of 1.2 for any country,\n[much] less for Mediterranean countries, which are still commonly viewed as\n``laggards'' and ... family-oriented. This outcome is probably the biggest surprise of\nEuropean demographics at the end of the present century.'' The longstanding\nfertility differential between Northern and Southern Europe was unexpectedly\nreversed. Countries viewed as traditional, Catholic, and family-oriented inexplica-\nbly had markedly lower fertility than those that were Protestant, more secular, and\nIn this article we provide a detailed empirical analysis of the Italian case to shed\nlight on the adequacy of current demographic theorizing on very low fertility. We\nbegin by introducing some major threads in the arguments and offer relevant\nbackground on Italy. We then introduce our data and present a series of event\nhistory models with longitudinal microdata. We conclude by considering the\ntheoretical lessons of the Italian case.\n90 D. I. Kertzer et al.\nTo date, economic theories of various kinds have dominated the theoretical\ndebate on very low fertility. Following Becker (1976) and other neoclassical\neconomists (Mincer 1963), much work has focused on increased female autonomy,\nthe movement of more women into the labor force, and calculations of the direct and\nindirect costs of childbearing to the family economy. At a more macro-level,\ntheory of relative economic deprivation, linking fertility decisions to economic\nopportunities related to relative cohort sizes and to judgments based on expected\nlevels of economic well-being linked to demographic and economic cycles. As\nnoted by Macunovich (1997), neither theory seemed to be born out by the course of\nfertility in the world's wealthier countries in recent years.\nThe economic feature that has most attracted theorists' attention has been\nincreasing levels of FLFP. Economic theory successfully predicts the substitution of\nactivity away from childbearing and childrearing with growing wage opportunity\nfor women at the individual level. Yet at the country level the correlation between\nFLFP and TFR reversed from being negative in the 1960s to sharply positive in the\ninhibiting effect of work on fertility has been at least partially removed with the help\nof social and institutional arrangements,'' citing in particular the provision of\npublicly funded childcare, maternity leave, and tax benefits (Gauthier 1996). In the\npast several years, researchers have turned attention to various social policies and\npublic institutions that might affect the relationship between women's work and the\ncost of childbearing. The reasoning suggests that the differences in both labor\nmarket participation and fertility rates in different western countries can largely be\nattributed to the characteristics of institutions like childcare system, parental leave\narrangements, and labor market flexibility (Engelhardt and Prskawetz 2004;\nIn particular, it has been noted how in Scandinavian countries and France, public\npolicies encourage both female work and childbearing by easing the childcare\nburden for dual earner families. This is done through public support in the form of\naffordable childcare services, generous maternity leaves, and protection of part-time\nemployment. In Anglo-Saxon countries the flexible frame for part-time employment\nand the private childcare services offered by the market may compensate for more\nlimited welfare provisions. By contrast, it is argued, in Southern Europe labor\nmarket rigidities and imperfections biased toward full-time or limited employment\ncontracts, an inadequate supply of public childcare, and other institutional\nconstraints, combine to make work and parenthood highly incompatible (Del Boca\nand Pasqua 2005b). It is further argued that while relaxation of these labor market\nrigidities (to enable more part-time employment) may increase overall female labor\nforce participation, the shift may come with the cost of lower fertility in these\nsettings of Southern Europe (Del Boca et al. 2005a).\nThe ``incompatibility impasse'' in Southern European countries seems to explain\nthe survival of the negative relationship between FLFP and fertility in these settings\n(Ko\n\u00a8gel 2004). ``Trends in the variables that would be representative for the role\nincompatibility hypothesis and the ease in combining work and child-rear-\ning ... cannot be related to the trends in fertility.'' (Engelhardt and Prskawetz\nItaly's Path to Very Low Fertility 91\n2004, p. 55). The childcare link seems to remain problematic. There is significant\nEuropean cross-national variation in the use of public and private childcare, but\nlittle evident correlation with fertility (Kiernan 1998).\nTaking a different perspective, a number of scholars have argued that no\nadequate theory of fertility can be developed that does not incorporate an\nunderstanding of culture (Kertzer 1995, 1997). Most prominent in this regard has\nbeen Second Demographic Transition (SDT) theory (van de Kaa 1987; Lesthaeghe\nand Surkyn 1998, p. 8). This approach identifies a shift toward individualization and\nsecularization and links it to the almost contemporaneous fall of fertility to below\nreplacement. Van de Kaa and other second transition theorists attribute this\ntransition to a basic shift toward values emphasizing ``the rights and self-fulfillment\nof individuals'' (van de Kaa 1987, p. 5) and away from traditional family-oriented\nvalues, citing the dramatic increase in late-twentieth-century Europe in divorce,\ncohabitation, and non-marital childbearing. Yet the countries in Europe that\ncurrently have the lowest fertility are those showing the strongest commitment to\nthe traditional forms of family formation, with relatively low divorce, non-marital\ncohabitation, and illegitimacy rates, and in the propensity of adult children to\nremain in their parental household until marriage and to live very close to them\nTo gain better insight into these different mechanisms--secular change, labor\nforce participation, public institutions, and family culture--it is desirable to go\nbeyond aggregate inter-country comparisons and to look more carefully at changing\nfertility behavior within a country. We do so here by examining the Italian case.\n2 Low Fertility in Italy--Stylized Facts\nItaly's well-known position in cross-national comparisons of fertility trends does not\ntell much about the historical variation in the path of fertility decline across its regions.\nWhile it is true that fertility declined in all regions, such decline started at very\ndifferent moments and proceeded at very different speeds in the various regions. In\ntracing the geographical pattern of marital fertility decline across Italian provinces (a\nlower level of aggregation than the regions) through the 19th and the 20th centuries,\nLivi Bacci observes that ``in the areas with an early decline in fertility [the North], neo-\nMalthusian attitudes had spread at an uneven pace because of deep economic and\nsocial differences among the various sectors of the population. [...] On the other hand\nin the South, where the population is perhaps more homogeneous in its socio-\neconomic characteristics and certainly culturally less differentiated, acceptance of\nneo-Malthusian attitudes was relatively slow and late and did not generate pronounced\nReplacement levels of fertility were reached in parts of the North beginning with\nsouthern regions still stood above replacement.1 Over the last two decades of the\n1 In this discussion and below we will make use of broad regions: Northwest, Northeast, Center, and\nSouth; The Northwest and Northeast together comprise the North.\n92 D. I. Kertzer et al.\n20th century, fertility in northern and central Italy remained stable, while the\nsouthern regions experienced continuing sharp fertility decline. By the century's\nend, Campania (centered on Naples), although still having the highest fertility in the\ncountry, had a TFR of only 1.5. Remarkably, Sardinia, known for its economic\nunderdevelopment, rugged terrain, and traditionalism, and which in 1960 had the\nhighest TFR in Italy (3.5), as might comfortably comport with both economic and\nSDT theory, had Italy's lowest fertility (1.04) by the end of the century (Dalla\nZuanna and Crisafulli 2002, Table 2). Despite the current observed convergence of\nregional fertility rates, Italian regions are still marked by important variations in\ndemographic, economic, and social patterns. This regional and temporal variation\nmakes the Italian case an especially fruitful one for theoretical exploration of the\nimpact of economic factors and cultural values on fertility.\nSubstantial variation also characterizes the levels of female labor force\nparticipation (FLFP) in the different regions, yet the correlation between regional\nNorth of Italy are much more likely to have paid employment. In the mid-1990s,\nwork. Even more strikingly, 41% of the southern women had never been in the labor\nIndeed, the increase in FLFP has been quite modest in the South, with the proportion\nof women who had ever entered the labor force rising only from 41% among those\nNorth) and little sign of any increase since then (Barbagli et al. 2003, Table 1.8).\nAmong women with children under age six in the mid-1990s, 62% of the\nNortherners and only 31% of the Southerners were employed (Sabbadini 1999,\nTable 3.5). A 1998 national sample survey (Famiglia e Soggetti Sociali, FSS) asked\nall individuals if they had ever been in the paid labor force. The persistence of\nstrong regional differences, particularly a North-South contrast, is clear. In the\nSouth, 50% of the 1941\u00ad50 birth cohorts had never entered the labor force, while in\nfigure had increased to 54% in the South, while it had decreased to around 10% in\nthe northern regions. The center of the country remained intermediate.\nA third element of regional variation is represented by the ideational dimension\nrelated to gender norms and union formation. There is consistent empirical evidence\nthat egalitarian gender norms and spousal (female) autonomy are stronger in the\nNorth (Sabbadini 1999, Table 6.3), where premarital cohabitation rates and divorce\nattitudinal indicators that tap individualization vary regionally, declining as one\nmoves from the most secularized Northwest to the traditional South (Table 1). By\ncontrast, there is one cultural feature that shows relatively limited regional\ndifference and that is the propensity of young adults to live with their parents before\nmarriage (Sabbadini 1999, Table 5.3) and to choose residential arrangements very\nWhile a regional comparison leads to doubts about the adequacy of an\nexplanation focusing on women's work, attempts to link regional level cultural\ndifferences of the sort theorized by SDT theorists to fertility levels lend little\nItaly's Path to Very Low Fertility 93\nsupport to this alternative. Of all marriages in Italy in 2001, over a quarter were\nconducted civilly, generally in the local town hall. In Italy's largest northern\nregions--Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto, Liguria--the proportion of religious\nmarriages ranged from 60 to 69%. In Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany, in the heart\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics for ILFI sample\nVariables Mean values\nIndividual traits (TV = time-varying)\nNA = Few women have completed education or been employed at the onset of risk (age 15) for union;\nsubspells incorporate changes to these variables. Time varying covariates are lagged 12 months\n94 D. I. Kertzer et al.\nof Italy's red belt, with its anticlerical and left-wing tradition, only 63% of weddings\nwere celebrated in Church. By contrast, in no part of the mainland South was the\npercentage of religious marriages under 80%, and in the deep South (Puglia,\nBasilicata, Calabria) it was near 90%. Yet plotting regional TFR against regional\npercentage of religious marriages in 2003 offers little evidence of any link between\nsecularization and low fertility (figure not shown). Italy's least secularized region\nusing this measure was the deep southern region of Basilicata, where only 9% of\nmarriages were celebrated outside a church, yet in 2003 Basilicata's TFR was 1.20,2\nactually below the national average.\n3 Testing Economic and Cultural Theory at the Individual Level\nRegional-level analysis of the Italian case fails to find much support for either FLFP\nor SDT theories of very low fertility. We now turn to micro-level data to see\nwhether the predicted relationships may, while obscured in regional level\ncomparisons, be evident in individual behavior. We analyze data from the Italian\nLongitudinal Family Study (ILFI), the only ongoing prospective social survey in\nItaly. Based on an original sample of 4,404 households within which all members\nare interviewed (9,770 individuals [18 years old), ILFI includes detailed fertility\nhistories that make it especially valuable for our analysis. The first wave of the panel\ntook place in 1997 and we here analyze data through the first three waves (1997,\nsample. The dynamic nature of the sample means that at every wave it loses all\nindividuals who (a) died, (b) migrated abroad, or (c) became severely impaired; and\nit gains individuals who (a) reach age 18 and belong to the originally sampled\nhouseholds, and (b) enter via union or cohabitation. ILFI is representative of the\nItalian population nationally.3\ncourse transitions: marriage, the transition from marriage to first birth, and the\ntransition from first to second birth. It is in these cohorts--who began entering their\nreproductive years in 1955 and whose fertility primarily occurred between 1960 and\n2001--that the dramatic and puzzling fall of Italian childbearing is most clearly\nmanifest.\ntime of the ILFI survey. For the youngest cohorts, we cannot observe all their\nchildbearing exposure, although our models adjust for censoring. Premature\nmortality of selectively differential women could affect our results, although given\nlimited female mortality at these ages it is likely that any such effect is slight.\n2 These values come from our analysis of ISTAT data.\n3 ILFI, under the direction of Antonio Schizzerotto, samples a nationally representative fraction of\nhouseholds with a multi-stage design. Sampling fractions are identical across regions, except that\nTrentino is oversampled. This adds approximately 319 households from this region. We use the data with\nthe filter that includes only the nationally representative portion. Results with the augmented sample show\nlittle difference. This also makes it unnecessary to weight descriptive statistics.\nItaly's Path to Very Low Fertility 95\nWe analyze each of these three transitions with Cox regression models and\nintroduce a set of covariates designed to capture both fixed and time-varying traits\nof the women. Of course, it is only women who experience one of these cumulative\nlife transitions who join the population of women at risk of experiencing the next\ntransition. Thus, we can expect that successive transitions tap a pool of women who\nare increasingly selective. We present pooled and cohort-specific models, after\nhaving explored a large number of alternative specifications.\nFollowing our interest in weighing the potential value of theories that focus on\nwomen's work on the one hand, and secularization (SDT theory) on the other, we\npay particular attention to two variables: (1) whether the woman is in the work\nforce, which is lagged by one year so as to capture a possible causal effect; and (2)\nwhether the woman was married in church or in a civil marriage. The number of\ncohabiting couples in the sample is too small to incorporate a separate measure of\nthis form of union. We regard civil marriage as a compelling indicator of the\nsecularization of Italian society, consistent with the concept of the Second\nDemographic Transition. Just because civil marriage is a strong measure of\nsecularization, it has the limitation for our purposes of being relatively uncommon\namong the oldest cohorts.\nIn the analysis to follow, we organize our presentation by event: first union, first\nbirth, second birth. In each case we introduce overall descriptive differentials for the\noutcome by region and cohort. Then we move to multivariate Cox regressions.\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics for all covariates in the ILFI analysis.\n4 First Union\nAmong the factors often cited as contributing to very low fertility is a postponement\nof marriage to ever-later ages. Such a factor might be thought to be especially\ninfluential in Italy, where childbearing remains closely tied to marriage. Italy has, in\nfact, been among the countries that have recently experienced a sharp rise in the age\nIn analyzing the transition to marriage we follow convention in taking age 15 to\nindicate the onset of risk and so model the duration from age 15 to (age at) first\nunion. Women are censored at the time of the survey if they have not yet entered a\nunion. In this analysis we take only formal unions (civil and religious marriages) to\nconstitute an event ending the spell. Cohabitation is relatively rare in Italy; thus, the\nsparseness of the events made cohabitation difficult to analyze separately.\nFurthermore our preliminary analysis suggested that cohabiters may be qualitatively\ndifferent from those entering formal unions.\nIn descriptive data via Kaplan Meier survival analysis, we observe dramatic\ndifferences by cohort, with the youngest cohort, born in 1961\u00ad70, showing a marked\n96 D. I. Kertzer et al.\nabout two-thirds of women had married by age 25, only 39% of women in the\nyoungest cohort had done so by that age. In fact, our Kaplan Meier data indicate that\nafter 20 years of exposure (accounting for censoring)--that is at age 35--about one-\nthird of the youngest cohort had yet to enter a formal union.5\nFigure 1 presents the survival curves for the duration to first union, drawn\nseparately by region. We define ``macroregion'' to be an aggregation from 20\nadministrative regions into 4 larger regions, as used in our introduction and by other\nanalysts. Our entire ILFI sample born since 1940 (age 30\u00ad60 at time of survey) is\nrepresented in these graphs. Here we observe only modest differences for the rate of\nentry into first union. This lack of regional difference in marriage rates is itself\nnoteworthy, in that, as we shall show below, our geographic depictions of fertility\nrates point to significant differences across the four macro regions of Italy.\nWe extend these descriptive portraits with regression models, in which we test\nfor the relative influence of cohort, region, and a number of potentially influential\ntraits of each woman. These include family background factors--mother's work\nexperience, father's education, death of mother and father--as well as the woman's\nown education and employment status. Our model specifications are successively\nmore inclusive, although we only present selected specifications here.6\nanalysis time\nmacroreg = NW macroreg = NE\nmacroreg = C macroreg = S\nDuration in months from age 15\nFig. 1 Duration to union by macroregion\n5 To the extent that the very youngest members of the youngest cohort have not had this full exposure,\ntheir differential behavior (such as more rapid entry into marriage after prolonged delay) will not be\nrepresented in these graphs.\n6 In most cases individual covariates are fairly robust to alternative specification, particularly the addition\nof other traits presumed to be exogenous. We have estimated alternative models (not shown) that include\ncovariates whose causal priority is more questionable. Even when we can establish temporal priority, one\ncan ask whether these characteristics--living with parents, self-classification as a ``student''--are not in\nfact jointly determined with the marriage and family building choices we model. After estimating pooled\nmodels, we split the sample by birth cohort and repeat the estimation of the preferred model.\nItaly's Path to Very Low Fertility 97\nTable 2 presents Cox regression models for the prediction of duration from age\n15 to first union. Coefficients are presented in relative risk format, and hence\nindicate the proportional shift in the baseline hazard due to a unit change in that\nvariable, i.e. membership in that category.\nModel 1 includes only cohort and region. Unsurprisingly, given the known\nsecular trend, we observe appreciable cohort differences. Women in the youngest\n(1941\u00ad50) cohort. There are essentially no differences between the two oldest\ncohorts. Regional differences are very modest and are not significant at conven-\ntional levels. Again there is no appreciable difference between the Northwest macro\nregion (reference)--the area identified with the earliest attainment of very low\nfertility--and the Northeast and the Center. Women in the South exhibit a relative\nrisk of 90%, but this difference is not statistically significant.7\nOur next model introduces the standard set of covariates suitable for the\nprediction of first union. As mentioned above, these include measures of economic\nbackground, parental mortality, woman's own education, and, especially, employ-\nment. (Death of mother, death of father, and woman's employment are all time-\nvarying covariates.) In the presence of these additional personal traits the effects of\nregion and cohort shift modestly. Regional effects become more pronounced (with\nall regions exhibiting lower relative risks compared to the Northwest once controls\nare introduced). Women in the South are now shown to have about 20% lower\nmarriage hazard rates (RRR = 0.818), and this is highly significant. The secular\ndecline in propensity to marry remains, indicated by the significance of the dummy\nvariable for the 1961\u00ad70 birth cohort. Its magnitude is reduced, however. The\nincrease in the magnitude of the effect of regional dummy variable for the South\nupon the inclusion of the employment measure is suggestive of a slightly different\nemployment-marital regime in that region. Once we control for employment,\nwomen born in the South are actually even less likely to marry than women in other\nregions; their lower rate of employment partly masks this.\nSeveral other family background factors are strongly predictive of this first step\nin family formation. Women whose mothers worked when the women were aged 15\nexhibit a marital hazard rate about 12% below those of other equivalent women.\nWomen whose fathers had low or no education marry at significantly higher rates.\nWe find no effect of parental mortality on union formation.8 The education of the\nwomen is quite strongly predictive of the rate of entry into marriage, showing a U-\nshaped relationship. Women with low levels of education have a marriage rate 64%\nabove women with moderate levels of education. On the other hand, women with\nhigh levels of education exhibit a hazard rate for duration to marriage 37% above\nthe middle group.9\n7 Women in the South macro region constitute a fairly large portion of our ILFI sample. Of the 7,250\nwomen who initiate spells in our data file, 35.0% are living in the South at age 15.\n8 By the time of the survey, 17.5% of the women had experienced the death of their father and 7.1% the\ndeath of their mother.\n9 Secular changes in educational attainment across these cohorts may confound these results, esp. if\nrelative education rather than absolute year of attainment points to the mechanism of interest.\n98 D.

Much contemporary\ntheory about very low fertility, as discussed above, would suggest that employment\nwould depress the family building activity of contemporary women. We ask not\nonly whether this is true, but also the magnitude of the effect and the extent of its\neffect across time (birth cohorts) and across the successive family-building events\nwe examine with ILFI.\nModel 2 of Table 2 indicates that on balance women's employment operates to\nsignificantly and appreciably reduce the rate of entry into marriage to about 83% of\notherwise equivalent women. Clearly, net of these other traits, employment\nlengthens the duration to marriage. This aggregate result (cohorts pooled) offers\nsupport for the view that the decline in fertility commences with lower rates of entry\ninto marriage, in turn, partly driven by women's employment.10\nModels 3\u00ad5 split the cohorts and repeat the analysis; thus, these models allow the\neffects of traits to differ across the three cohorts of women. Women in the 1941\u00ad50\ncohort have passed beyond the standard reproductive span by the time of the ILFI\n2001 survey wave. Thus information for their union formation (as linked to fertility)\nand childbearing should be complete. Some 88% of this cohort is observed to marry.\nFor these women we find clearly visible effects of region, woman's own education,\nand employment. Parental background traits do not show through here. Women in\nthe South make the transition to first marriage more slowly than women from other\nregions of Italy. (Women in the Northeast and Center show relative risk rates below\nunity, but these are not statistically significant.) At the same time we find that\nwomen whose education is low or high experience more rapid marriage--the U-\nshaped effect. This statistical result may be worth particular consideration in this\ncohort, as the apparent inconsistency may point to competing mechanisms linked to\nsome of the overarching processes we identified at the outset. Certainly aspiration\nfor education and labor market participation are intertwined. As in the pooled results\nworking women make the transition to marriage less quickly, about 30% below the\ntransition rate of otherwise equivalent women.\nSome elements of this nuptiality process change by the time the next cohort, born\n1951\u00ad60, is observed. In this case, regional differences are muted further, with\nalmost no differential at all among Northeast, Northwest, and Center. The point\nestimate for women from the South indicates a lower rate of transition into\nmarriage, but this difference is not statistically significant. Personal and parental\ntraits have some predictive value, in a direction mostly consistent with an effect in\nwhich higher socioeconomic status retards marriage. Women whose fathers had\nlittle education experienced more rapid rates of marriage, while children of highly\neducated fathers experience slower marriage. The woman's own education matters a\ngood deal, and again, a U-shaped pattern is observed: poorly and highly educated\nwomen are quicker to marry.\n10 We also estimated a model that split the employment effect into (separate dummy variables for) full-\ntime and part-time work. In the pooled model and some cohort-specific models, the individual dummy\nvariables were statistically significant; however, we always failed to reject the hypothesis of the constraint\nthat the two coefficients are equal. Thus, we accept the hypothesis of equivalence and model the\nemployment effect overall.\nItaly's Path to Very Low Fertility 101\nThe employment effect is statistically significant, although its strength does not\nmatch that found in other cohorts. In this middle birth cohort, we observe that\nemployed women enter unions at about 15% lower rates (RRR = 0.856) than other\nequivalent women.\n41 at the time of the survey. We observe 914 such women and nearly two-thirds of\nthem have married as of the survey date. This youngest cohort differs yet again from\nthe older two. Regional differences in rates of marriage transition have moderated\nconsiderably. (No coefficients are even marginally significant.) Yet personal\nbackground traits are predictive. Women whose fathers had little or no education (a\ndecreasing fraction of the population of women over time) entered into marriage\nmore quickly, while those whose mothers worked made this transition more\nslowly.11 The U-shaped effect of woman's own education is visible once again,\nalthough the only significant effect indicates that poorly educated women are\nquicker to marry.\nPerhaps most notable in the Cox regression of this youngest cohort is the lack of\nany effect of the woman's own employment. It appears that with women's work\nbecoming more common and, perhaps, normatively more accepted, it no longer has\nthe effect on discouraging marriage that it formerly did.\n5 First Birth\nWe turn now more directly to our individual-level fertility analysis with a look at\nthe transition from marriage to first birth. Since cohabitation is relatively uncommon\nin Italy, and since childbearing outside of a formal union is relatively rare (although\nincreasing), we exclude cohabiting individuals from the risk set.12\nIn our sample, some 92% of all women who had entered a formal union\nexperienced a birth by the 2001 wave of the ILFI survey. As was to be expected,\nsuccessive cohorts show a slowing down of transition to first birth. While nearly\ntransition to first marriage, the transition from marriage to first birth showed clear\nregional differences across all cohorts (Fig. 2). Women in the South proceeded\nmore quickly to a first birth after marriage than did women elsewhere; 92% of\nwomen in the South had a child within five years of marriage compared to 83% of\nwomen in the Northwest.\nA simple Cox regression model with regional and cohort covariates alone\nconfirms these graphical differences. Table 3 Model 1 points to statistically\n11 In these two youngest cohorts (but not in the 1941\u00ad50) cohort an alternative model that included the\nwoman's number of siblings indicating that woman who came from larger families of origin married\nsooner. Since this covariate did not influence other covariates and was always non-significant in the first\nand second birth models, we have not included in the basic models we present.\n12 Alternative analyses, including a dummy covariate for ``cohabitation,'' showed lower fertility (lower\nthan civil union) for this group, but included relatively large standard errors (small N). At the same time,\nqualitative inference for other covariates is not altered by excluding cohabiting women from the model.\nsignificant and high rates of childbearing in the Center and South, with\nprogressively slower rates of the transition to parenthood across cohorts. Model 2\nintroduces the standard set of personal covariates into the model. This model\nincludes covariates used above for union formation, but, to provide a test of SDT,\nadds a dummy variable for type of union: civil marriage (versus religious).\nEconomic theory argues that woman's employment (a time-varying covariate)\nshould serve to decrease the rate of transition to first birth. Education and\nsocioeconomic background should work in corresponding ways, with higher status\nwomen slower to make the transition. A strict interpretation would suggest that\nregional (and cohort) differences should be reduced or even eliminated on the basis\nof these additional controls. Persistent effects not consistent with the standard\nexplanation would suggest that regional differences and marital union type\ndifferences would remain, even in this more comprehensive model.\nIn Table 3, Model 2 we find only modest effects of some of the socioeconomic\nbackground factors; mother's work, father's education, and parental mortality are all\nnon-significant in this model. Even the woman's own education offers little\nadditional power to predict first birth transition. In this model regional and cohort\neffects are reduced only slightly in magnitude from Model 1. Thus women in the\nCenter and South make the transition from marriage to first birth at higher rates,\nwhile women in recent cohorts make the transition more slowly, even after adjusting\nfor other characteristics.\nWe also include in this model covariates for woman's age at marriage.\nCollectively these five dummy variables (with marriage at age 25\u00ad29 as the\nreference) are highly significant. We observe that women who marry at the youngest\nages make the transition to first child more rapidly, all else equal. Women who\nmarry at ages 35\u00ad39 make this transition much more slowly than the women in the\nanalysis time\nmacroreg = NW macroreg = NE\nmacroreg = C macroreg = S\nDuration in months from union\nFig. 2 Duration to first birth by macroregion\nItaly's Path to Very Low Fertility 103\nTable 3 Cox regression models for first birth 2001 ILFI survey (All women in a formal union)\nPooled sample with controls for\nregion and cohort only\nPooled sample with\nstandard controls\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nIndividual traits (TV = time-varying)\nRegion (versus Northwest)\nFather's education (versus Diplome)\nRespondent's education (versus Diplome)\nTable 3 continued\nPooled sample with controls for\nregion and cohort only\nPooled sample with\nstandard controls\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nItaly's Path to Very Low Fertility 105\n25\u00ad34 cohorts.13 There is no evidence of hastening the childbearing transition for\nwomen who enter (first) marriage at a later age.\nImportantly, our primary measures of both FLFP theories and SDT theory\nregarding very low fertility--woman's employment and marital union type--are\nstrong predictors of the progression from union to first birth. The relative risk of first\nbirth transition for employed women is 0.81 and is one of the most powerful\npredictors in the model. A similar effect (0.73) is indicated for women in a civil\nunion compared to a religious union. Again this effect is highly significant. For a\nwoman who is both employed and in a civil union--together indicators of departure\nfrom a more traditional family building style--the relative risk ratio is 0.59\n(RRR = 0.813*0.728). In other words, for such women their rate of transition from\nmarriage to first birth is 59% that of otherwise equivalent women.\nWe extend the analysis to look at this transition separately by cohort, and\nfind that women in the Center and South experienced higher rates of first birth\ntransition. In the complete model, almost no covariates for background socioeco-\nnomic traits are statistically significant. This older cohort had few cases of civil\nmarriage and so it may not be surprising that no significant differences between\nwomen married civilly and religiously can be found here. We still find a strong\neffect of employment (RRR = 0.824), not much different from the model which\npools across all three birth cohorts. It is quite clear that employment, even in these\nrelatively early cohorts, is strongly and negatively associated with the transition to\nfirst birth.14 Coefficients for age at union are not particularly consistent or stable.\nStill there is evidence that women who marry at younger ages (15\u00ad24) make the first\nbirth transition more rapidly.\nThe story for the 1951\u00ad60 cohort differs only moderately. Again the background\ntraits of parental characteristics and woman's own education do little to improve\nprediction in the model. Notably, regional effects are not visible. While women in\nthe South and Central macro regions exhibit somewhat higher rates of transition, the\nassociated coefficients do not achieve statistical significance. (There are 703 women\nat risk in this cohort.) By contrast, effects for employment and for union status are\nstrong and highly significant. Employed women have a relative risk of first birth\nabout 16% below other equivalent women in their cohort. Women in a civil union\nhave a 33% lower relative risk. As for the pooled sample these two traits in\ncombination (employed women in a civil union) predict a much lower rate of entry\ninto childbearing. Here again, women who marry at an early age (15\u00ad24) display a\nmore rapid rate of making the transition to first birth.\nThe story for the 1961\u00ad70 cohort differs in several important respects from the\nolder two cohorts. These women are about age 31\u00ad41 in 2001 at the time of the last\nIFLI wave we use here. They thus have not completed their reproductive span, so\nthat any additional timing shifts anticipated after 2001 cannot be captured by our\n13 Further work will investigate what role premarital pregnancy may play in explaining the higher rates\nof first birth among the youngest age groups.\n14 Coefficients for parental traits do not achieve statistical significance at conventional levels when\nemployment and woman's own education are excluded from the model.\ndata. Regional differences re-emerge in this cohort. Notably women in the South\n(RRR = 1.70; p \\ 0.001) proceed much more rapidly to their first birth. Women in\nthe Center also progress more rapidly, although this difference is only significant at\nthe 10% level. Parental background traits are again of modest predictive value,\nalthough we observe that women with fathers of the highest level of education have\nwomen, we observe less of an effect of age at first union. What does show through is\nthat women who marry as teens have much higher transition rates than those who\nmarry in their twenties and early thirties. Here, though, the impact of bridal\npregnancy undoubtedly weighs heavily.\nBeing employed and in a civil (versus religious) union once again exert strong\ndownward effects on predicted fertility. Employed women exhibit hazard rates some\n30% below non-working women. As was the case with previous cohorts, the\ncombination of working and being in a civil union serves to lower the predicted rate\nof transition from union to first birth appreciably, here by over one-half.\nWe also investigated alternative models for the transition to first birth. In parallel\nto our examination in the case of union formation, we tested for the effect of part-\ntime versus full-time employment. In a test of constraints across coefficients, we\naccept the null hypothesis of no difference in the effect of full- and part-time\nemployment. Also, we tested for the influence of the number of siblings of the\nwoman. A greater number of siblings might be expected to proxy a family\nbackground in which traditional roles and/or larger family sizes are valued. (In turn,\nthis expectation would lead to a prediction of first birth occurring more rapidly.) We\nfind no evidence of this, as the covariate for number of siblings provided no\nadditional predictive power beyond the characteristics already in the model.\nWe also examined an alternative model that included interaction terms between\nwoman's own education and age at union. These are added to both the pooled and\ncohort-specific models, in which the first-order covariates for education and age at\nunion appear as in Table 3. The joint test of the group of covariates indicates that\nthey are not collectively significant. This indicates that there is no identifiable\nfurther alteration of the effect of education across women who enter unions at\ndiffering ages.\n6 Second Birth\nThe third and final element of our event history analysis focuses on second birth. In\nhave a first birth, and of this group, 72% go on to bear a second child within the\nobservation period. Not only is this a (necessarily) smaller sample than the number\nof women at risk of first union and first birth, it is more selective as well.\nThere are no pronounced cohort differences in the transition to second birth,\nalthough it is evident that the 1941\u00ad50 cohort made the transition from first to\nsecond birth more rapidly than succeeding cohorts. Tabulations of the survivor\nfunction point to 5-year transition fractions of 59%, 51% and 53% for the cohorts\nsuccessively. The youngest cohort is slow to make the transition for about 4 years\nItaly's Path to Very Low Fertility 107\nfollowing first birth, but after that point makes the transition more rapidly so that it\nreaches a crossover with the other two cohorts within a decade of exposure. It is\nworth recalling that the underlying sample contains more women in each of the\nolder two cohorts than in the youngest, since the youngest cohort is least likely to\nmarry and have a first birth, requisites for being in the risk set for second birth.\nRegional differences are noteworthy. While Fig. 3 shows no discernible differences\nacross Northeast, Northwest, and Central for the five years following first birth,\nwomen in the South make this transition much more rapidly.\nTable 4, Model 1 points to statistically significant and somewhat higher rates of\nchildbearing in the Northeast and the Center, compared to the Northwest. But\nstrikingly, the relative risk for the South is nearly double that for these other two\nregions and close to three times the rate found in the Northwest. Cohort effects are\ntransition while it does differ in first birth transition (see above) suggests that\nrestriction of fertility at higher parities (even 2nd) had begun to make its way into\nfamily building practice in this middle cohort, who were themselves passing through\nModel 2 includes the standard set of covariates as in the models above. Addition\nof these individual-level traits does virtually nothing to attenuate either the regional\nor the cohort effects. Women from the Northeast and the Center display hazard rates\nthat are 21% and 23% higher than women in the Northwest, while again, strikingly,\nwomen from the South experience the second-child transition at 2.6 times the rate of\nwomen in the Northwest, even controlling for all of these individual-level traits.\nWomen whose mothers worked when the women were aged 15 show higher rates of\nsecond birth transition. While this might be seen as contrary to expectation it may\nanalysis time\nmacroreg = NW macroreg = NE\nmacroreg = C macroreg = S\nDuration in months from first birth\nFig. 3 Duration to second birth by macroregion\nTable 4 Cox regression models for second birth 2001 ILFI Survey (All women with a first birth and in a union)\nPooled sample with controls for\nregion and cohort only\nPooled sample with\nstandard controls\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nIndividual traits (TV = time-varying)\nRegion (versus Northwest)\nFather's Education (versus Diplome)\nRespondent's education (versus Diplome)\nItaly's Path to Very Low Fertility 109\nTable 4 continued\nPooled sample with controls for\nregion and cohort only\nPooled sample with\nstandard controls\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nEstimate Standard\nerror\nreflect an intergenerational pattern of scheduling work and reproductive careers in\nwhich the second birth is hastened by the existence of a maternal role model\nbalancing work and reproduction. Father's education and that of the woman herself\ncarry little predictive value in this model. Those who have their first child at an\nearlier age also made the transition from first to second child more quickly. Broadly\nspeaking, women who bore their first child before age 25 moved on to the second\nchild at about 25% higher rate than women whose first birth occurred when they were\naged 25\u00ad34. As in the case of both other transitions considered above, employed\nwomen and those in civil marriages exhibit dramatically lower second birth\ntransition rates, with the combined effect of lowering the hazard rate by about 40%.15\nAs with the models reported for the previous two transitions, Models 3\u00ad5 here\nrepeat the analysis by cohort. In the 1941\u00ad50 cohort, regional differences are quite\npronounced, with the South relative risk about 2.5 times the Northwest and the other\ntwo regions intermediate and non-significant. For this cohort of 681 women, about\n75% of whom experienced a second birth, those with father's education at the low\nor high end of the distribution are shown to have slower rates of progression to the\nsecond child. Women with limited education show no difference from women with\nmiddle-range education, but women with high educational levels have much lower\nsecond birth rates (RRR = 0.648). Employment continues to have much the same\neffect as before, lowering predicted fertility by about 20%. The point estimate for\ncivil union indicates reduced fertility, but civil marriages are rare in this cohort and\nthe estimate does not achieve statistical significance.\nIn the 1951\u00ad60 cohort, regional effects are similar to those found in the older\ncohort. Women in the South bear their second child at rates about 2.5 times those in\nthe Northwest; women in the other regions are intermediate and their differences are\nnot statistically different from the reference region. No parental or personal traits for\neducation or parental loss are statistically significant for this cohort of 666 women,\nsome 72% of whom bear a second child. Working women exhibited rates of\nstatistically significant differences by union status or by age at first birth, although\nthe presence of this latter group of dummy variables does alter other coefficients.\na first birth, and 65% of them are observed to go on to a second birth. Here the\nregional rankings are similar to earlier cohorts, but we observe particularly\ndepressed fertility among women in the Northwest. Southern women have rates of\nsecond birth almost four times as large as those in the Northwest (RRR = 3.73,\np \\ 0.001). Rates for the Northeast and Center are about double the Northwest.\nFew personal and parental background traits help predict this fertility transition,\nsave one: women's own education. Women in the highest education category\nexhibit transition rates to second birth 65% above other women. This may represent\n15 An alternative model tested (via dummy variable interaction) whether employed women in the South\nbehaved differently from other women. This had no additional predictive power. Small numbers of\nwomen are in a cohabiting union or not in any union during some of the time exposed to the risk of a\nsecond birth. Models which included dummy covariates for these two traits indicated significantly lower\nrelative risks for such women. Since other coefficients were robust to these alternatives, we have used the\nsimpler specification for ease of exposition.\nItaly's Path to Very Low Fertility 111\na conscious fertility compression strategy for such highly educated (and profes-\nsional) females. Working depresses the rate of transition to the second birth; its\neffect is significant and larger in magnitude than for previous cohorts.\nAs with the first birth transition, we investigated alternative models for the\ntransition to second birth. Again, we find no statistically significant difference\nbetween the effect of part-time and full-time employment. As before, the sibling\ncovariate was non-significant. And finally, we again examined a model for an age-\neducation interaction. Here we include dummy variable for the interaction of\ncovariates for woman's own education and her age at first birth across the pooled\nand cohort-specific estimations.16 Once again, the joint test of the group of dummy\nvariable interaction terms was non-significant; thus, the effect of education across\nwomen who bear their first child at differing ages is not seen to differ.\n7 Conclusions\nThe Italian case has undermined confidence in the two most prominent theories of\nvery low fertility: one that focuses on increases in women's labor force\nparticipation, and the other on a shift to less familistic and more secular values.\nBut if we move away from the country comparisons that tend to dominate this\nliterature and instead examine fertility in Italy in the context of individual lives, it\nbecomes clear that each of these theoretical approaches has value. At the same time,\neach approach has limits. It is particularly interesting to discover that even regional-\nlevel comparisons within Italy provided little support for either of these two\ninfluential theoretical perspectives. It required individual-level life course data and\nlongitudinal analysis to demonstrate that both hypothesized sets of relationships\nactually do play a role.\nIndeed, our micro-level analyses showed that women's employment has a strong\nimpact on Italians' marriage and fertility behavior. Until the most recent cohort,\nworking women married more slowly. And throughout all cohorts, women's\nparticipation in the labor force had a consistently negative and powerful impact on\ntheir childbearing. Women who were working were 20%\u00ad30% less likely (using\nodds ratios from cohort-specific models) to make transitions to first and second\nbirth. Similarly, although the statistical significance was marginal due to the small\nnumber of cases, there is intriguing evidence that those choosing a civil marriage--\nand hence embracing more secular values and less subject to the church's\ninfluence--had lower birth transition rates than those who were married in church.\nClearly, this relationship merits further study as new data become available.\nYet even after controlling not only for women's employment and civil marriage,\nbut also for a host of family and individual characteristics, very pronounced regional\neffects were evident. This suggests that Italy's regional differences are tapping\ncontextual effects that are not captured by existing economic or SDT theory and\nmay be rooted in social networks, provision of local public services, availability of\n16 These models strain the more modest sample size for cohort-specific analysis, and some interactions\ncould not be estimated. Suffice to say no compelling evidence appears for age\u00adeducation interactions.\nkin, and, especially, sociocultural norms regarding family building. The dramatic\nsize of these regional effects offers strong evidence of the need to look beyond\ntraditional economic and SDT theories in explaining declines in fertility.\nOur work suggests several avenues for future research. First, effort should go into\nfurther substantive specifications of these persistent regional differentials. Contex-\ntual covariates, although not easy to assemble, might point to some of the regional\nand local features--both social and policy-based--that could help promote or retard\nthese three transitions. Second, one might consider Livi-Bacci's contention that,\ncontrary to SDT theory, it is the very surfeit of familism in societies such as Italy\nthat contributes to very low fertility (Livi-Bacci and Savini 2000; Livi-Bacci 2001;\nDalla Zuanna 2001). He argues that the intense interdependence between\ngenerations is leading to a prolonged period of dependency in the younger\ngeneration, and that this leads the younger generation to avoid, postpone, or in any\ncase limit their assumption of parental responsibilities and commitments. Although\nthis theory has proven difficult to test, the argument is provocative and, given the\nprominent place occupied by familistic societies among the pioneers of very low\nfertility, worth putting to the test.17 Third, it is important to look more closely at\ngender relations as a potential key to explaining very low fertility. Focusing on\ngender relations rather than familism, McDonald has offered an alternative\npp. 427\u00ad8) hypothesizes that ``very low fertility in advanced countries today is the\noutcome of a conflict or inconsistency between high levels of gender equity in\nindividual-oriented social institutions and sustained gender inequity in family-\noriented social institutions.'' From this perspective, the fact that Italy and Spain\nhave such low fertility is explained by the preservation of a traditional gender\nsystem in the context of expanding labor force opportunities for women. All three of\nthese lines of expansion could flow from (and be consistent with) our work,\nalthough developing well-specified empirical tests remains a challenge.\nPerhaps most interesting for social science theory more generally, our work\nserves both to recover and to challenge economic and cultural approaches to\nexplaining demographic behavior. While neither prevailing economic theory\n(FLFP) nor SDT theory aimed at explaining very low fertility should be wholly\ndismissed based on the Italian evidence--indeed each very likely points at forces\nthat have had an impact on Italy's dramatic fertility decline--together they only\npartially explain the Italian case. The lessons that Italy has to provide for our\nunderstanding of very low fertility are still largely untapped, awaiting a fuller\nexploration of the social, institutional, and cultural matrices in which the decision to\nhave children is made.\n"
