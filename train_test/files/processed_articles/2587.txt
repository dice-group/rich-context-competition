The associations\nbetween early life-socioeconomic status and health, speci-\nfically substance use, throughout the life course are well\ndocumented (4,6\u00ad8). Several studies substantiate the rela-\ntionship between substance use and welfare participation\n(9\u00ad12). However, less known is the impact of and preva-\nlence of behavioral health problems later in life among\nchildren who were welfare recipients before age 18. Using\nlongitudinal data from the nationally representative Add\nHealth dataset, this study contributes to the literature by\nexploring whether welfare participation before the age of 18\npredicts substance use rates, and prevalence until young\nadulthood, a period categorized broadly between 24 and 34\nIn terms of substance use rates, youth and young adults\nconstitute the groups most likely to use alcohol or illicit\nindividuals in the United States, or 9% of the population 12\nyears and older, meet diagnostic criteria for a substance use\nestimates ranged dramatically from 6% to 37% of welfare\nrecipients who had a substance use problem (20). However,\nthese data are for adult welfare recipients only and to date,\nthere are no comparable data of substance use rates later in\nthe life course for children and adolescents who received\nAid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), or\nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits\nbefore age 18. Additionally, the discrepancy in the wide\nrange is due to different data sources, definitions, metho-\ndology, and thresholds for substance use over different\nincrements of time. In order to understand the influence\nof childhood welfare participation on adulthood substance\nuse, the social safety net of welfare assistance warrants\nfurther attention.\nWelfare, formerly AFDC and renamed TANF under\nthe Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity\nCONTACT Shiyou Wu, MSW, PhD candidate shiyouwu@live.unc.edu School of Social Work, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 325 Pittsboro\nReconciliation Act of 1996 (also commonly referred to\nas \"welfare reform\"), was signed by President Clinton\nand is considered to be a main safety-net welfare pro-\ngram for children and families delivered through fed-\neral block grants for states to administer (21). Under\nTANF, substantial changes to welfare include a max-\nimum 5-year lifetime limit of benefits, work (or in\nsome states, school) requirements, and more state dis-\ncretion on how benefits can be administered or sanc-\ntioned (1,22,23). As a result of welfare reform, caseloads\nhave been reduced from 5 million families in 1993 to\n25). While these numbers reflect lower rates of partici-\npation in welfare overall, a more nuanced understand-\ning recognizes that declining caseloads resulted from\nstricter eligibility requirements and not due to poverty\nalleviation (1,22). Further, stigma associated with wel-\nfare participation has been documented and connected\nto welfare participation rates historically (26,27).\nPrecisely because studies have shown that those who\nexperience chronic childhood adversity, such as socio-\neconomic disadvantage, have a greater likelihood of\nsubstance use disorder and an increased risk for\nchronic adversity (6,28\u00ad30), the impact of childhood\nwelfare participation on substance use later in life war-\nrants further attention. Specifically, childhood poverty\nhas been linked to a host of physical and psychological\ndisorders during childhood and later in life (4,28)\nincluding social adjustment (31); disadvantaged neigh-\nborhood conditions (32); educational achievement\n(33,34); housing mobility, economic capital, and self-\ngiven the heightened vulnerabilities of children experi-\nencing poverty and participation in means-tested wel-\nfare programs, the literature remains surprisingly\nnascent on the impact of receiving welfare in the early\npart of the life course (<18 years old) and rates of\nsubstance use in adulthood. To fill this gap, this study\nattempts to connect adversities in childhood, such as\npoverty and as indicated by welfare participation before\nthe age of 18 with adult substance use.\nMethods\nData\nThis study used survey data from the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health\n(Add Health). Add Health is a longitudinal study of\nnationally representative cohort survey of grades 7\u00ad12\nCarolina Population Center at the University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill. Participants were followed into\nthat tracked participants' social, economic, psychologi-\ncal, and physical well-being dimensions from childhood\nto adulthood (see (38) for detailed information on the\nAdd Health survey design). In addition, this survey\ncollected parents' information at Wave I (N = 17,670).\nFor this article, we used the subpopulation of respon-\ndents who finished both the Wave I and Wave IV\nsurvey. We also included participants' family back-\nground and their parent's information to explore the\npotential effects of welfare participation on substance\nuse. Our sample size started at 15,701 and reduced to\nreasons including: roughly 15% of adolescents had par-\nents who did not finish the interview at Wave IV, and\nWave IV sampling weights had 901 missing values,\nincluding the dependent variables.\nMeasures\nDependent variables\nFor this study, the substance use dependent variables\nincluded six dimensions of alcohol use and five cate-\ngories of drug use of adults in Wave IV.\nAlcohol use\nThe Add Health survey defined \"a drink\" as \"a glass of\nwine, a can or bottle of beer, a wine cooler, a shot glass\nof liquor, or a mixed drink, not just sips or tastes from\nsomeone else's drink.\" To yield a better understanding\nand more precise measure of alcohol use, participants\nwere asked to recall six dimensions of their alcohol use\nfor both long-term (during the past 12 months) and\nshort-term periods (past 30 days). For longer-term alco-\nhol use, participants were asked: (a) \"how many days\nthey drank alcohol\". Seven response categories were\nprovided: 0 = None, 1 = 1 or 2 days a year, 2 = once\nand 6 = (almost) every day; (b) participants were asked\n\"Think of all the times you have had a drink. How\nmany drinks did you usually have each time?\"\nResponses ranged from 0 to 18 drinks; (c) participants\nwere asked \"how many days did you drink (5 or more/4\nor more) drinks in a row?\" Response options were the\nsame as the first dimension range from 0 to 6; and (d)\nparticipants were asked to report how many days did\nthey get drunk or very high on alcohol, also using the\nsame seven responses as the first dimension. Short-term\nuse was categorized as drinking during the past 30 days:\n(e) participants were asked how many days they drank,\n2 S. WU ET AL.\nusing the same responses from 0 to 6 as the first\ndimension; and (f) participants were asked \"Think of\nall the times you have had a drink during the past 30\ndays. How many drinks did you usually have each\ntime?\" Responses range from 0 to 18 drinks.\nSubstance use\nAt the Wave IV data collection, the Add Health survey\nasked participants whether they had ever used the follow-\ning drugs before the Wave IV survey time point: (a)\nsteroids, including anabolic steroids or body-building\ndrugs; (b) marijuana, including hashish, bhang, and\nganja; (c) cocaine, including crack and coca leaves; (d)\ncrystal meth, also known as ice, crank, or tweak; and (e)\nother types of illicit drugs, such as lysergic acid diethyla-\nmide (LSD), phencyclidine (PCP), ecstasy, heroin, psilo-\ncybin mushrooms, or intoxicative inhalants. These\nquestions used dichotomous responses, with yes coded\nas 1 and no coded as 0. Notably, the Wave IV Add Health\nsurvey did not ask young adult respondents about their\ncurrent use of all these five types of substances. Given this\nlimitation of the data, our analysis could not include an\nexplicit measure of substance use during adult years only.\nHowever, a response of no indicated that the respondent\nhad never used illicit substances at least until young\nadulthood. Therefore, we created the five variables indi-\ncating no use of a particular substance before the Wave IV\nsurvey time point: steroid-free, marijuana-free, cocaine-\nfree, crystal meth-free, and free of other types of illicit\ndrug use (1 = never used; 0 = previously used).\nTable 1 presents the distributions of each dependent\nvariable. For participants' alcohol use, in past 12 months,\nthe average number of days when alcohol was consumed\naverage number of alcoholic drinks consumed at each\nepisode. Table 1 also offers alcohol use variables pre-\nsented in the past 30 days. As for rates of drug use, more\nthan half of the respondents (55%) reported previous use\nof marijuana, followed by other illicit substances (22%),\ncocaine (19%), crystal meth (9%), and steroids (2%).\nAlthough just over half of the sample had used mar-\nijuana before adulthood, 45% had not used marijuana,\nand the vast majority of respondents reported no pre-\nvious use of other illicit substances (78%), cocaine (81%),\nKey independent variable\nOur aim was to explore whether a household's receipt\nof public welfare assistance before a child was 18 years\nold had an impact on substance use once the respon-\ndent reached young adulthood. To answer this ques-\ntion, we divided participants into two groups based on\nresponses to the question: \"Before you were 18 years\nold, did anyone in your household ever receive public\nassistance, welfare payments, or Food Stamps?\"\nResponses to the questions were based on data from\nWave III (aged from 18 to 26); for participants missing\nWave III data, responses were based on Wave IV data.\nOverall, about 18% of participants were from a welfare\nrecipient family.\nCovariates\nWe controlled for demographic and socioeconomic vari-\nables at individual, parental, household, and community\nlevels on all the analytic models identified in the literature.\nAt the individual level from Wave I, we controlled for\nadults' gender (1 = female; 0 = male), age (as a continuous\nvariable), and race. Race was recoded as five dummy\nvariables: white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native\nAmerican and others. Self-perceived intelligence was\nassessed by asking adults \"compared to other people in\nyour age, how intelligent are you?\" Responses ranged\nfrom 1 to 6, denoting \"moderately below average\" to\n\"extremely above average\". We also controlled for adults'\npersonal income level from Wave IV, which was recoded\nas three dummy variables: low income (<$10,000), mod-\n$99,999). Educational level from Wave IV was recoded\nTable 1. Unweighted distributions of dependent variables.\nDependent variables N Mean/% SD\nAlcohol use\nDrug-free (1 = yes; 0 = no)\nNote.

Marriage status from Wave IV was coded as a\ndummy variable (1 = married or cohabitating; 0 = other).\nWe controlled for adults' parental education,\nemployment status, and health status from Wave I.\nParental education ranges were scored from 0 (less\nthan 8th grade) to 7 (professional training after col-\nlege). Employment status was coded as four dummy\nvariables: unemployed and not looking for a job, unem-\nployed and is looking for a job, part-time employed,\nand full-time employed. Parental health status was\nrecoded as three dummy variables: good, fair, and\npoor. In addition, we controlled whether respondent's\nfamily had enough money to pay their bills (1 = yes; 0 =\nno). Family structure was measured as four dummy\nvariables: two biological parents, two parents' one bio-\nlogical; single parent, and other, and household size\n(number of persons living in the household) from\nWave I.\nFor all of the five drug use outcomes, we addition-\nally controlled for whether participants' assessed drug\nuse as a problem within their neighborhood to gauge\ntheir normative beliefs regarding drug use. This was\nrecoded as three dummy variables that substance use\nwas perceived as: not a problem, a small problem, and\nbig problem; we also controlled for whether partici-\npants had learned about drug use in a class at school\n(1 = yes; 0 = no). For all the six alcohol use outcomes,\nwe controlled for parental alcohol use (recoded as\nthree dummy variables: never, sometimes, and more\nthan 3 days a week), and whether participants had\nlearned about issues of drinking in a class at school\nAnalytical strategies\nFirst, we conducted descriptive analysis to capture the\noverall distributions for all of the variables. Then, to\ninvestigate whether young adults whose family had ever\nreceived welfare benefits before 18 years had impact on\ntheir adulthood substance use, given the non-randomi-\nzation design of this study, we conducted propensity\nscore matching so that the two groups (received welfare\nvs. not received welfare) were comparable. By conduct-\ning these analytic steps, the sample selection bias could\nTo conduct propensity score full matching, first, we\nused logistic regression to predict each participant's\nprobability (i.e., propensity score) of living in a family\nthat received welfare benefits before 18 years based on\nall the covariates that were introduced previously.\nSecond, we matched each adult who grew up in a\nwelfare recipient family with someone who did not\ngrow up in a welfare recipient family but had the\nclosest propensity scores. We used 0.01 as the caliper\nfor the matching (39). We limited our matching in a\ncommon support region with overlapped propensity\nscores, and did balance checks on all the control vari-\nables before and after matching to ensure the match-\ning process was conducted appropriately. Tables 2 and\n3 show that most of the covariates did not balance\nbefore matching, whereas those imbalanced variables\nwere all balanced after matching. The adequate bal-\nance after matching indicates that the adults who grew\nup in a welfare recipient family are very similar to\ntheir counterparts who did not grow up in a welfare\nrecipient family.\nFinally, we conducted regression models (logistic\nregression for the five drug use models, whereas OLS\nregression for the six alcohol use models) to examine\nthe association between the key independent variable\nand each of the outcome variables, while controlling for\nthe demographic and socioeconomic factors at the indi-\nvidual, parental, household, and community levels. All\nof the analysis was conducted by using Stata 13.1 for\nWindows. Based on Chen and Chantala's suggestion\n(41), we used survey command with sampling weights\nfor the analyses, which can adjust the complexity sur-\nvey design (unequal probability and clustering selec-\ntion) of Add Health, and yield national population\nestimates for selection bias.\nResults\nThe results of our analysis on the effects of welfare\nparticipation before 18 years on six dimensions of the\nalcohol use are shown in Table 4. Overall, young adults\n(24\u00ad34 years old) raised in a household that ever\nreceived welfare had lower levels of alcohol use as\nadults when compared with adults who did not parti-\ncipate in welfare during childhood.

Establishing the\nrates of substance use problems among welfare recipi-\nents has been important for prevention and targeted\ntreatment among this population (9, 12). Findings of\nthis study highlight long-term behavioral health risks of\nyoung adults whose families participate in welfare pro-\ngrams before the age of 18. This population focus is\nimportant given the developmental tasks associated\nwith emerging and young adulthood that can impact\nphysical health, behavioral health, and social develop-\nment, as well as participation in community and\nemployment contexts (42).\nThe web of factors impacting substance use are\nmultifaceted and complex and include environmental,\ninterpersonal, social, and individual level risks (43).\nThis study draws attention to various risk and protec-\ntive factors that impact substance use into adulthood\namong adults who before the age of 18 participated in\nwelfare. Participation in welfare is one casual mechan-\nism that impacts rates of illicit drug use as one ages.\nHowever, equally important are the protective factors\nthat reduce the likelihood of engaging in substance use,\ndespite the known risks of poverty on human develop-\nment and subsequent health outcomes. Across the con-\ntinuum from policy makers developing programs to\nassist families living in poverty to those on the ground\nimplementing programs and services, families impacted\nby poverty are at increased risk for adverse circum-\nstances (44). These adversities last beyond childhood\nand have impact on human development throughout\nthe life course. Family structure, neighborhood safety,\neducational attainment, and gender differences warrant\nadditional focus especially as the impact of welfare\nparticipation before age 18 is further understood.\nInterestingly, there were no significant differences\nbetween any of the alcohol use variables and welfare\nparticipation before the age of 18. While Keyes et al.'s\n(45) work underscores the importance of social context\nand social norms in how alcohol use impacts popula-\ntion level determinants of the population's alcohol use,\nit is possible that these factors were not sufficiently\ncontrolled for within this study. Ample research exists\nto confirm that alcohol outlets are concentrated in\nminority and low-wealth communities (46\u00ad49), and\nmay impact community level norms and attitude con-\ncerning alcohol. Cultural norms and values have a\npowerful influence on alcohol-related behaviors, as\nwell as on belief systems about use (50) indicating\nthat more research is warranted around these norms\nand later alcohol use among welfare recipients\nspecifically.\nThe prevention of long-term negative outcomes,\nincluding the development of behavioral health disor-\nders, hinges on early diagnosis and intervention. In\norder to reach more children, adults, and families\nimpacted by poverty and potential substance use, addi-\ntional focus on the prevention of behavioral health\nproblems is crucial. This includes \"effective programs\nto scale at the school, neighborhood and community\nlevel\" (43, p. 245) in addition to a clear understanding\nof the intersection between adverse social conditions\nand the social policies in place to remedy them. With\nthe passage of the Affordable Care Act and a move\ntoward integrated systems of care, there is a renewed\nemphasis on the screening, prevention, and early inter-\nvention for behavioral health problems; this new\napproach can have great benefit, particularly for those\nexperiencing poverty early on in the life-course and\namong recipients of welfare programs.\nThis study has several strengths: first, this study used\na nationally representative large sample size data from\nAdd Health, which allowed us to more broadly general-\nize study conclusions. Second, this study used several\nmeasures of substance use (i.e., five dimensions for\ndrug use and six dimensions for alcohol use) to yield\na better understanding of the type and severity of sub-\nstance use and also to show the impacts of household\nwelfare participation on participants' substance use\nlater on in the life course. Third, this study used pro-\npensity score matching method to reduce the sample\nselection bias, and could yield more precisely results, as\ncompared with running regressions on unmatched\nsamples. This study can significantly enhance the cur-\nrent literature and fill the research gap of exploring the\nrelationship between childhood welfare participation\nand adulthood substance use.\nDespite these strengths, several limitations need to\nbe acknowledged: first, Add Health survey used a\nschool-based sampling approach, which excluded\nadolescents who were not in school for a variety of\nreasons. Second, given the consideration of the\ncomplicated survey design (i.e., needs to use survey\ncommend with weights), we lost a large amount of\nthe original sample size due to missing data. For\nfuture studies, using multiple imputation could be a\nrobust method for dealing with missing data, rather\nthan just deleting the cases as was done in this ana-\nlysis (51). Third, given the limitation of the Wave IV\nAdd Health data, our analysis could not include an\nexplicit measure of drug use during adult years only.\nTherefore, instead of looking at the adulthood drug\nuse, we examined the impacts of childhood welfare\nparticipation on probability of remaining drug-free\nuntil young adulthood. Lastly, although this study\nused propensity score analysis to control the selection\nbias for the effects of household welfare participant\nand several other influential variables on adulthood\nsubstance use, this statistical methodology cannot\nconclusively rule out the unmeasured or unobserved\nvariables that may be crucial to the \"treatment\"\neffects. A randomized experiment in which both\nobserved and unobserved predictors are balanced\nwould be an ideal approach.\nFurther research is needed to capture a more\nnuanced analysis that includes variables to assess the\ndepth and context of childhood adversity and poverty\nand the impact on later life behavioral health issues.\nThis includes the length and duration of welfare parti-\ncipation in childhood given the adversities of poverty\ncan differ based on pervasiveness and when in child\ndevelopment they occur (1). Precisely because \"perso-\nnal responsibility\" and \"work\" were the key focus of\n1996 welfare reform, and employability continues to be\nan important barometer for contributing to society\n(11), the impact of welfare participation warrants\nclose consideration for the long-term behavioral health\nand well-being of program participants.\n"
