We selected the classification tree model on the\nbasis of its equivalent accuracy but greater ease of use.\nRESULTS -- The resulting tool, called the  , includes questions on\nage, waist circumference, gestational diabetes, height, race/ethnicity, hypertension, family his-\ntory, and exercise. Each terminal node specifies an individual's probability of pre-diabetes or of\nundiagnosed diabetes. Terminal nodes can also be used categorically to designate an individual\nas having a high risk for 1) undiagnosed diabetes or pre-diabetes, 2) pre-diabetes, or 3) neither\nundiagnosed diabetes or pre-diabetes. With these classifications, the sensitivity, specificity,\npositive and negative predictive values, and receiver operating characteristic area for detecting\nthe tool using v-fold cross-validation and performed an independent validation against NHANES\nCONCLUSIONS -- The   is the only currently available noninvasive\nscreening tool designed and validated to detect both pre-diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes in\nthe U.S. population.\nThe objective of this study was to de-\nvelop a simple, self-administered,\npaper-based screening tool that\ncould be used by the public to determine\ntheir risk of having pre-diabetes or un-\ndiagnosed diabetes and to help people\ndecide whether they should see a phy-\nsician for further evaluation. To maxi-\nmize its accessibility and ease of use, the\ntool should use only information that is\ncommonly known to an average individ-\nual and preferably should not require any\ncalculations.\nThe prevalence of diabetes is growing\nrapidly, with the total number of cases\nworldwide projected to increase from 171\nIn the U.S. in 2002, the prevalence of dia-\nbetes was estimated to be 19.3 million, of\nwhich about 5.8 million cases were undiag-\nnosed (2). An additional 41 million individ-\nuals are estimated to have pre-diabetes,\ndefined as impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or\nimpaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Pre-\ndiabetes implies an increased risk of devel-\nopment of type 2 diabetes on the order of\n(4). Several studies have demonstrated that\ntype 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed\nwith lifestyle modification or the use of\npharmacotherapy in subjects with pre-\ndiabetes (3,5). Studies have also indicated\nthatpreventingordelayingtheonsetoftype\n2 diabetes by lifestyle modification or the\nuse of pharmacotherapy can be cost-\neffective (6) if costs of the interventions are\ncontrolled (4).\nAn important step in preventing or\ndelaying type 2 diabetes and its complica-\ntions is to identify people with pre-\ndiabetes and undiagnosed diabetes so that\nthey can be given appropriate care. The\nAmerican Diabetes Association recom-\nmends screening for type 2 diabetes at\n3-year intervals beginning at age 45, par-\nticularly in those with BMI 25 kg/m2\n(7). However these recommendations are\nnot widely followed, as indicated by the\nfact that in 30% of people who have dia-\nbetes it is still undiagnosed. Major reasons\nfor this problem are the cost and inconve-\nnience of testing.\nOne way to address this problem is to\ndevelop a simple, inexpensive tool that\ncan identify people who are at high risk of\nhaving pre-diabetes or undiagnosed dia-\nbetes and motivate them to be screened.\nSeveral investigators have developed dia-\nbetes risk assessment tools. However,\nmost of those tools apply to non-U.S.\npopulations and none were designed to\ndetect pre-diabetes and undiagnosed dia-\nbetes. The objective of this study was to\ndevelop a simple tool for use in the U.S. to\nidentify people who have a high proba-\nbility of having pre-diabetes or undiag-\nnosed diabetes, using only information\nthat is commonly known to an average\nindividual and preferably not requiring\nany calculations.\nMETHODS\nDefinitions\nThe definitions of pre-diabetes and diabe-\ntes are based on fasting plasma glucose\n                                                \nFrom 1Archimedes, San Francisco, California; and 2GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nE-mail: author@archimedesmodel.com.\nAdditional information for this article can be found in an online appendix at http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/\nK.E.H. has received consulting fees from GlaxoSmithKline, and D.M.E. and L.S. have received consulting\nfees from GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer Inc., and Eli Lilly.\nAbbreviations: CART, classification and regression tree; DRC,  ; FPG, fasting\nplasma glucose; IFG, impaired fasting glucose; IGT, impaired glucose tolerance; NHANES, National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test; ROC, receiver operating characteristic.\n\u00a9 2008 by the American Diabetes Association.\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.

IFG is defined as FPG of 100\u00ad\nOGTT result 200 mg/dl. Pre-diabetes is\ndefined as IFG and/or IGT without diabe-\ntes. Undiagnosed diabetes is defined as\nthe presence of actual diabetes based on\nFPG and/or a 2-h OGTT and the absence\nof an individual having been told that he\nor she has diabetes. We use the term \"el-\nevated plasma glucose\" to define an indi-\nvidual who has either pre-diabetes or\nundiagnosed diabetes.\nData\nWe used data from the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\nternally validate the tool (8). This dataset\nwas chosen for two main reasons. First, it\nis a representative sample of the U.S. pop-\nulation, which is the main population for\nwhich the tool is being designed. The sur-\nvey methods oversampled certain sub-\npopulations, such as race/ethnicity\nminorities but provided weights to enable\nconstruction of a representative sample of\nthe U.S. Second, the NHANES III dataset\nis the most current NHANES survey that\ncontains 2-h OGTT results for a large sub-\nsample of people, as well as FPG and the\npertinent characteristics and risk factors\nneeded to build a tool. Our analysis was\nbased on the results of the 7,092 partici-\npants who were aged 20 years and had\nFPG results. Two-hour OGTT data were\navailable for approximately half of those\n2-h OGTT results were missing, the diag-\nnoses were based on FPG alone. An anal-\nysis of the group for whom both FPG and\nOGTT data were available revealed that\nthe lack of OGTT data for some of the\nparticipants did not materially affect the\nstability of the results; the overall effect of\nthe missing data was to underestimate the\nprevalences of pre-diabetes and undiag-\nnosed diabetes by 2 and 1.5%, respec-\ntively. Additional details about the data\ncollection and analysis are described in a\ntechnical report available as an online ap-\nExplanatory variables\nTo build the tool, we examined 18 ex-\nplanatory variables that would be known\nto the average individual and would not\nrequire laboratory results or special med-\nical definitions. These included BMI,\nheight, weight, waist circumference,\nwaist-to-hip ratio, age, sex, race/ethnicity,\ntaking blood pressure medication, taking\ncholesterol medication, gestational diabe-\ntes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol,\nhistory of diabetes (any blood relative),\nhistory of diabetes (parent or sibling), his-\ntory of diabetes (parent), history of diabe-\ntes (sibling), and exercise compared with\npeers. Not all variables were used in the\nfinal tool; their inclusion in the final mod-\nels depended on their value as predic-\ntors of pre-diabetes and undiagnosed\ndiabetes.\nStrategy\nTo help ensure that we developed the best\npossible tool from the available data, we\nbuilt two different tools using different\nmethods, compared them, and selected\nthe one that best served our objectives of\nsimplicity and accuracy.\nAnalytical methods\nLogistic regression. One tool was devel-\noped using logistic regression, in which\nthe probability of pre-diabetes or undiag-\nnosed diabetes was modeled by a logistic,\nor log-odds, transformation\nln\np\n \n\n\n \n . . .  \nn\nxn\nwhere the xi\n's are the continuous or di-\nchotomous explanatory variables, the \ni\n's\nare the regression coefficients estimated\nusing maximum likelihood methods, and\nthe response variable was assumed to\nhave a binomial distribution. The proba-\nbility can be rewritten as\nLogistic regressions were generated with\nSAS (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary,\nNC).\nClassification and regression tree. We\nalso built a model using a classification\nand regression tree method (CART)\n(CART software version 5.0; Salford Sys-\ntems, San Diego, CA). This technique sep-\narates data into mutually exclusive groups\nthat concentrate a particular class of the\ntarget variable. In our analysis the target\nvariable could take a value of 0 or 1 de-\npending on whether undiagnosed diabe-\ntes (or pre-diabetes) is absent or present,\nrespectively. The value of a target variable\nis referred to as its class. Starting at the\ntree root, the data are split into two\ngroups conditional on whether an explan-\natory variable or a linear combination of\nexplanatory variables is greater than some\nvalue. The particular value of the explan-\natory variable selected for the split is the\none that best separates the target classes, 0\nor 1, at the root node into two child\nnodes. If the primary splitter variable field\nis missing, a surrogate splitter variable is\nused instead.\nThe process then repeats for each of\nthe child nodes. Subsequent splits can\ninvolve another explanatory variable or\na different value of a previously used\nvariable. A node that is not further split\nis referred to as a terminal node. Each\nterminal node is assigned to a target\nclass conditional on whether the preva-\nlence of the target class exceeds a desig-\nnated threshold. The same threshold is\napplied to all terminal nodes and deter-\nmines overall sensitivity and specificity\nof the tree. The classification tree is\ngrown to its maximum size and then\npruned on the basis of a criterion that\nbalances the number of terminal nodes\n(complexity) against the accuracy of the\ntree in classifying people, sometimes\ntermed misclassification cost.\nTo develop a single tree that could\nbe used to detect either pre-diabetes or\nundiagnosed diabetes, we used an ap-\nproach analogous to that used for the\nregression model. Specifically, we first\ndeveloped a tree to predict undiagnosed\ndiabetes and then applied a different\nthreshold to predict pre-diabetes. Be-\ncause one of the goals was to create a\nsimple model, BMI and waist-to-hip ra-\ntio were dropped from the list of vari-\nables in favor of weight, height, and\nwaist circumference, which required no\ncalculation but still maintained the ac-\ncuracy of the tool. We eliminated the\ncholesterol variables high cholesterol\nand taking cholesterol medication be-\ncause of the large number of missing\nfields and low predictive value. We also\neliminated history of diabetes in any\nblood relative in favor of the more spe-\ncific diabetes history variables (history\nof diabetes in a parent or sibling, in a\nparent only, or in a sibling only).\nWe used v-fold cross-validation to\ntrain and test the classification tree mod-\nels, partitioning the data into equal-sized\nsubsets (9). We then derived and tested\nthe classification tree on all combinations\ndata.\nHeikes and Associates\nRESULTS\nPrevalence of pre-diabetes and\ndiabetes\nThe prevalences of undiagnosed diabetes\nand pre-diabetes in the NHANES III data-\nLogistic regression model\nComplete results for the logistic regres-\nsion approaches are in found in the online\nappendix.

The par-\nticular result that best met our objectives\nis shown in Fig. 1, which is formatted as a\nscreening tool and called the Diabetes\nRisk Calculator (DRC). It includes ques-\ntions on age, waist circumference, gesta-\ntional diabetes, height, race/ethnicity,\nhypertension, family history, and exer-\ncise. The tree begins in upper left corner.\nAn individual moves through the tree in\ndirections determined by answers to\nquestions at each branch, until ending in\na terminal node (oval). The probabilities\nan individual at any terminal node has\nundiagnosed diabetes or pre-diabetes are\nshown in the nodes. If thresholds are set\nfor designating an individual as having el-\nevated plasma glucose or pre-diabetes, it\nis possible to calculate traditional mea-\nFigure 1--Classification tree for detecting pre-diabetes (PDM) or undiagnosed diabetes (DM).\nTool to detect pre-diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes\nsures of accuracy and predictive value.\nThus, each terminal node can designate\nan individual to be at high risk of either 1)\ndiabetes or pre-diabetes (if the probability\nof undiagnosed diabetes is 8%) or 2)\npre-diabetes (if the risk of pre-diabetes is\n29% and the risk of undiagnosed dia-\nbetes is 2.5%), or 3) neither diabetes or\npre-diabetes (if the risk of pre-diabetes is\n29%andtheriskofundiagnoseddiabetes\nis 1%). These three designations are rep-\nresented by heavy, medium, and dashed\nborders around the terminal nodes.\nWith use of these classifications, the\naccuracy of the classification tree for un-\ndiagnosed diabetes is sensitivity 88%,\nspecificity 75%, positive predictive value\nand area under the ROC curve 0.85. The\naccuracy for pre-diabetes or undiagnosed\ndiabetes is sensitivity 75%, specificity\n65%, positive predictive value 49%, neg-\native predictive value 85%, and area un-\nder the ROC curve 0.75. On the basis of\nthese results, a positive result on the DRC\nfor undiagnosed diabetes increases the\nodds that an individual has undiagnosed\ndiabetes by a factor of 3.5, whereas a neg-\native result decreases the odds by a factor\nof 6, for an 18-fold difference in the odds\ndepending on the results of the test. For\nincreased plasma glucose, the difference\nin the odds of a positive versus a negative\nresult is a factor of 6.\nValidation of classification tree\nThe classification tree in Fig. 1 was vali-\ndated in two ways. One was a split-sample\nvalidation using data in NHANES III and\nv-fold cross-validation methods.

Because it is considerably simpler to\napply, requiring no calculations at all, we\nselected it as the preferred tool for our\nobjectives.\nCONCLUSIONS -- We have devel-\noped a simple tool that uses only ques-\ntions known to an average individual and\nrequires no calculations to help identify\npeople who are at increased risk for pre-\ndiabetes or undiagnosed diabetes. The\nDRC sorts people into 14 different cate-\ngories and reports for each category the\nprobability that an individual is at low\nrisk or high risk for either undiagnosed\ndiabetes or pre-diabetes. To develop the\ntool we applied two different methods:\nlogistic regression and CART. The ver-\nsions produced by the two methods had\nsimilar accuracies, predictive values, and\nareas under ROC curves. We selected the\ntool developed by the CART method be-\ncause it could be translated into a simpler\ntool, and it provided information about\nthe actual probabilities that an individual\nhas pre-diabetes or undiagnosed diabetes.\nThe tool developed by the CART method\nis in the form of a tree that can be easily\nnavigated from the root to terminal nodes\nthrough a series of branches, where the\npath followed depends on the answers to\nsimple yes or no questions that any indi-\nvidual would be able to answer. The final\nterminal node determines the individual's\nrisk of undiagnosed diabetes and/or pre-\ndiabetes. The sensitivity of the DRC was\nand 65% for individuals with undiag-\nnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes or undi-\nagnosed diabetes, respectively.\nTo our knowledge, there are no other\ntools designed to find people likely to\nhave pre-diabetes as defined by IFG or\nIGT. Other tools have been developed for\ndetecting people with undiagnosed dia-\nbetes (10\u00ad17). The sensitivities for undi-\nwith the highest sensitivity observed in\nindividuals who had one or more cardio-\nvascular risk factors (18). The specificities\nfor the same tools ranged from 41 to 77%.\nOther tools have been built to calculate\nthe risk of future development of diabetes\npredict future drug-treated diabetes (10)\nhas been used in people with one or more\nrisk factors for cardiovascular disease to\ntry to identify those who have either un-\ndiagnosed diabetes or IGT (11). These\ntools and applications were all designed\nfor different purposes than was the DRC.\nBecause one of the objectives of a\ngood screening tool is to minimize the\nneed for unnecessary testing and there-\nfore reduce the economic impact of test-\ning, the predictive value is important to\nconsider for performance of the tool. The\npositive predictive values of the DRC were\nplasma glucose, respectively, and the neg-\native predictive values were 99.3 and\n85%, respectively. The positive predictive\nvalue for the other screening tools for un-\ndiagnosed diabetes ranged from 8 to 13%\nfor non\u00adhigh-risk populations and was\n23% for individuals who have one or\nmore cardiovascular risk factors (11).\nThus, in terms of overall performance, the\nDRC appears to compare favorably with\nTable 1--Specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values, and ROC for the classification tree applied to elevated plasma glucose\nand undiagnosed diabetes\nSensitivity (%) Specificity (%) PPV NPV ROC\nUndiagnosed diabetes\nPrediabetes or undiagnosed diabetes\nNPV, negative predictive value; PPV, positive predictive value.\nHeikes and Associates\nother available tools for detecting people\nwith undiagnosed diabetes, in addition to\nits ability to detect people at high risk for\npre-diabetes.\nAnother important distinction of the\nDRC is that it has been constructed for and\ntested in a U.S. population. The NHANES\nIII dataset is a weighted survey and includes\nindividuals from different ethnicities as rep-\nresented in the U.S. population. An analysis\nshowed that a risk score for undiagnosed\ndiabetes developed originally in a strictly\nCaucasian population could not be applied\nreliably to other populations with diverse\nethnic origins (12).\nTo our knowledge, the only other tool\nfor undiagnosed diabetes developed with\nNHANES data was based on an older ver-\nsion of the NHANES (NHANES II) (14).\nFor convenience we will call this the\n\"NHANES II model.\" When this model\nwas applied to the NHANES II data on\nwhich it was developed, its reported sen-\nwere lower than the sensitivity and spec-\nificity calculated for the DRC applied to\nNHANES III data on which that model\ntively). Furthermore, when the NHANES\nII model is applied to NHANES III data,\nits sensitivity drops to 71.7% and its spec-\nificity decreases to 54.1% (see online\nappendix).\nModels generally perform best on the\ndata on which they were developed, and\nthey perform better on training data than\non test data. That the NHANES II model\ndoes not perform as well on NHANES III\ndata as the DRC is not unexpected. How-\never, the fact that the DRC performs better\nthan the NHANES II model, when each is\ntested against the data used to develop it,\nindicates a significant improvement in\npredictability for the DRC.\nFinally, the DRC has been validated\nusing two methods, 1) split sample cross-\nvalidation methods applied to NHANES\nIII data and 2) application of the classifi-\ndataset. As expected, the sensitivity, spec-\nificity, and predictive values were some-\nwhat lower in the validations than for the\ntraining datasets. Nonetheless, the DRC\nstill appears to compare favorably to other\ntools for detecting pre-diabetes and undi-\nagnosed diabetes. Future research will in-\nclude validating the tool using an\nindependent dataset from a diabetes pre-\nvention clinical trial, as well as determin-\ning its applicability to populations outside\nthe U.S. Finally, development of a pa-\ntient-friendly, electronic version is under-\nway for broader use in clinical practice.\nIt is not possible to determine pre-\ncisely the clinical value of any risk-\ncalculating tool or any diagnostic test for\nthat matter. Their purpose is to provide\ninformation that would tip the balance\nthat an individual would choose to un-\ndergo more definitive screening with\nappropriate laboratory tests. For pre-\ndiabetes, it is well documented that treat-\nment can postpone and in some cases\nprevent the onset of diabetes. It is also\nwell established that treatment of diabetes\nhelps prevent complications. For these\nreasons, several organizations, such as the\nAmerican Diabetes Association, recom-\nmend screening. Yet a high proportion of\npeople do not receive the recommended\nscreening tests. It is reasonable to assume\nthat some people do not perceive their\nrisk of pre-diabetes or diabetes to be suf-\nficiently high to justify the inconvenience\nand cost. The DRC we describe in this\narticle is intended to give them a simple\nmethod for determining whether they\nmight have a higher risk than they per-\nceive. For undiagnosed diabetes, a posi-\ntive versus a negative result spreads the\nodds of having that condition by a factor\nof 18. For increased plasma glucose, the\nspread in odds of that condition is by a\nfactor of 6. It seems reasonable to believe\nthat for many people this information\nmay aid in their decision to seek care.\nIn summary, we have described a\nsimple, validated, paper-based screening\ntool that can be used to calculate the prob-\nability that an individual has either undi-\nagnosed diabetes or pre-diabetes using\ninformation known to an average individ-\nual, without requiring any calculations.\nThe screening tool can be used by physi-\ncians to assess the risks of their patients or\ncan be self-administered by individuals to\nassess their own risks. Use of this tool en-\nables the identification of individuals who\nmight benefit from confirmatory tests and\ntreatment to delay or prevent the onset of\ntype 2 diabetes and its complications.\nReferences\n1.
