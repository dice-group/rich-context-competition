For a period of time, principally in the\n1990s, the pro-market energy model appeared to work reasonably well with energy\ncompanies managing to deliver affordable and reliable energy to UK consumers. As\nof the mid-2000s, however, it started to become apparent that markets were at risk\nof under-delivering on energy supply security and affordability whilst climate\nchange mitigation had become politically far more salient (see Lockwood 2013).\nScientific arguments about anthropogenic climate change as well as debates about\ndwindling oil resources, the UK's ageing energy infrastructures and rising electricity\nand gas prices have together resulted in various, ongoing repoliticisations of energy\ntestations has been evident in the adoption of a number of new energy policy\nobjectives and in some attempts to redesign UK energy governance institutions.

It is starting\nto become apparent that delivering on climate change objectives whilst ensuring\nsecure and affordable supplies is no mean feat--it can be described as highly\ncomplex, a Herculean task as well as completely unprecedented in policy terms (see\nSmith 2009). It has also been widely observed that UK energy governance institu-\ntions, despite the high number of new policies and Acts of Parliament over this time\nperiod, so far appear unable to successfully deliver these complex new energy\n2013). For example it can be argued that fossil fuels still dominate the energy mix,\nthe UK remains quite far off its 20-20-20 renewable energy target, energy poverty\nis growing, gas and electricity prices have risen rapidly and some vital new infra-\nstructure, generation and technology investments are not materialising at the speed\nand scale required. This is clearly not to claim that there have been no changes in\nenergy policy, but that changes have been insufficient in terms of timing, profundity\nand quality to have sufficient impact in terms of a sustainable, secure and affordable\nenergy transition.\nOne explanation for underwhelming achievements so far has been the degree to\nwhich energy policy has been bounded ideologically, thereby constraining the\nrange of choices and/or policy instruments available to policy-makers (Mitchell\nrelated, institutional inertia and insufficient state involvement in supporting energy\ntions tend to emphasise the static nature of energy governance whereas arguably\nnew policy objectives are evidence of change and strong contestations have been\nand remain evident in political debates. This article argues that the ability of the\npolitical system to deliver new objectives and respond to ongoing politicisations has\nbeen, and still is, limited by a lack of political capacity brought about in part by\nvarious forms of depoliticisation. Specifically it argues that it is the forms that\nenergy depoliticisations took, within specific ideational contexts, which have\nreinforced inertia and underpinned a lack of state capacity to manage, coordinate\nand deliver collective energy and climate goals. In this way this article makes a\ncontribution to two areas--to understandings of the impacts of depoliticisations on\ncertain forms of political capacity and to understanding how political practices\nconstrain and colour sustainable energy transitions.\nThe article proceeds as follows: the first half outlines three heuristic forms of\ndepoliticisation and explains how and why these were deployed within UK energy\npolicy over the course of the 1980s and 1990s. Inter-relationships between ideas,\nforms of depoliticisation, path dependency and change are explored and empha-\nsised as important explanatory variables. The second half assesses in more detail the\nways in which forms of depoliticisation, once institutionalised within political\npractice, resulted in embedded corporate power, weak political institutions and an\n\u00a9 2015 The Author.

This work has\nbeen informed empirically by analysis of energy policy, consultation and strategy\ndocuments conducted over a six-year period with an emphasis on ideas, institu-\ntional structures and mandates and interactions between drivers for and resistances\nto change. Evidence from these documents has been cross-checked against insights\ngleaned from 22 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders, often at a senior\nlevel, who have been involved in energy policy-making and regulation.\n1. Depoliticisation and UK Energy Governance\nDepoliticisation, or delegation, has been referred to by politicians, civil servants and\nsome academics as positive--as a solution to a variety of political problems often\nperceived in terms of government overload (see Flinders and Buller 2006, 294;\nHay 2007, 91). By contrast this article situates itself with respect to critical\ndepoliticisation literatures wherein decisions to pass responsibility and accountabil-\nity in a given issue area away from government are understood as undemocratic in\noften conceptualised within this literature as a governing strategy, tactic or tool\npursued specifically with the intention of avoiding both accountability for and\ndeliberation and debate over certain issue areas (Burnham 2001; Kettell 2008). This\nin practice reduces the discretionary nature of decision-making replacing it with a\nmore `rules-based' system over which civil servants and politicians have less active\nday-to-day control (Burnham 2001, 136). In practice depoliticisation is understood\nto take a variety of forms including a passing of responsibility from government to\nthe private sector and/or from government bodies to quasi-public or independent\nAs will be seen below the forms that depoliticisation in UK energy governance took\ncan be understood largely within these parameters but there is, however, one\ninteresting point of departure that this article identifies and explores. This has to do\nwith claims here about links between depoliticisations and political capacity in the\nface of repoliticisations. Although interactions between depoliticisations and\nrepoliticisations are recognised within these literatures they have tended to empha-\nsise the path dependent nature of successfully depoliticised issue areas. This is partly\nbecause by conceptualising depoliticisation as a governing strategy whereby state\nmanagers actively seek to insulate themselves from negative outcomes the empha-\nsis is often on a lack of willingness to change from current systems of governance\nthe paradoxical nature of depoliticisation whereby governments are understood to\nbe deliberately enhancing political control through processes of delegation\n(Burnham 2014). The starting point of analysis here is different in that there is\nrecognition of some political desire to change as evidenced in new (legally binding)\npolicy objectives, but the argument here is that government has not maintained\npolitical control over the institutions that decide upon and deliver energy policy\nobjectives.\n\u00a9 2015 The Author. British Journal of Politics and International Relations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd\non behalf of Political Studies Association\n110 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 18(1)\nWhat this article further suggests is that the lack of political capacity to respond,\neven when willing, to pressures to change is partly related to how energy has been\ndepoliticised. This approach rests upon the notion that depoliticisations are contex-\ntually contingent at points in time (see Kettell 2008, 635). In seeking to understand\ndepoliticisation as contingent we can turn to analyses that see depoliticisation not\njust as a tool or as `statecraft' but also as related to ideas (Hay 2007, 94; see also\ntactical and strategic but are often also informed by genuinely held ideas about\nimportant to understand which norms become embedded within processes of\ndepoliticisation--for example, in this instance, pro-market ideas about appropriate\ngovernance interactions between states and markets.\nEmbedded pro-market ideas have, in practice, served to negate other sets of ideas\nabout how to govern and stand in contrast to conceptions of politics as the capacity\nfor collective agency and choice underpinned by open and informed deliberation\nSuch observations on what politics is, or should be, are in some respects similar to\nscholars studying sustainable energy policy and transitions. It has been observed,\nfor example, that the current energy policymaking `technocracy' needs to abandon\nneoclassical economic theory and investigate and deliberate much more broadly\n(Lehtonen and Kern 2009, 107). This claim relates to the notion that because low\ncarbon energy transition is unprecedented it can only come about through knowl-\nedge building and learning-by-doing and with the state acting as an informed force\nextent, therefore, depoliticisation can be used as a tool to help explain why these\nforms of political institutions have not been utilised in the UK in response to the\nrecognised need to transition to a low carbon economy.\n1.1. `Marketised' Depoliticisations\nIn order to explore the contingent nature of energy depoliticisations and their\nimpacts on the practice of energy and climate politics this article proceeds by\nseparating depoliticisation into three forms that have been particularly evident. The\npurpose here is not to suggest and or describe alternative forms of depoliticisation\nbut to apply them as heuristics to study these processes and their impacts in\npractice. Particular attention is paid to identifying ideas that motivated these pro-\ncesses and the kinds of rules and norms about how to govern energy that became\nembedded as a result.\nThe first process explored here, labelled `marketised depoliticisation', is closely\nrelated to Colin Hay's `Type One' depoliticisation in that it involves the:\n... off-loading of areas of formal political responsibility to the market\nTo the extent that market actors as a result of privatisation became responsible for\nthe provision of certain goods and services this state-market relationship can be\nunderstood as the state seeking to achieve its objectives through markets (see also\nBurnham 2011, 465). Although energy privatisations arguably also served the\n\u00a9 2015 The Author. British Journal of Politics and International Relations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd\non behalf of Political Studies Association\npurpose of re-filling empty state coffers as well as various private, commercial\nwere also informed by sets of economic ideas. These decisions were made within\nthe context of a wider shift from Keynesian to neoliberal economic thinking that\neconomic, and public choice, ideas became influential over economic policy partly\nin response to the successful characterisation of 1970s economic crises as `bureau-\nThe provision of energy goods and services via publically owned energy companies\nhad increasingly been presented as problematic and as exacerbating problems of\noverload. Specifically some economists had over the course of the 1970s cast doubt\non the adequacy of political rules for achieving `efficient allocation of resources' and\non the merit of running utilities in order to achieve political ends such as the\nredistribution of income and power (Littlechild 1981, 11\u00ad12). Some of the econo-\nmists and politicians that had advanced these ideas became, under the new Con-\nservative government, responsible for the (long) process of privatisation and\nliberalisation as well as drawing up the new regulatory regime (Helm 2003). In this\nway the new objective of policy became the establishment and maintenance of\neconomically efficient, freely trading energy markets--but within the context of\neconomic policy as a whole. The task of government became therefore constrained\nto setting:\n...a framework which will ensure that the market operates in the energy\nAlthough the passing of responsibility for energy provision to market actors was by\nno means straightforward in practice, not least because of the strength of opposition\nfrom coal mining unions, by and large oil, gas and electricity companies had been\nprivatised companies had considerable assets, which in the case of energy compa-\nnies had been paid for by the state, and this made them powerful political actors by\nvirtue of their absolute size and their position in the corporate elite (Wilks 2013,\n127; see also Smith 2009). Through processes of marketised depoliticisation the role\nof the state within energy governance shifted, in addition, from one of responsibil-\nity for national planning, infrastructure development and energy provision to\nneutral overseer and upholder of an agreed set of market rules and principles.\nProcesses of marketised depoliticisation may have served to embed certain eco-\nnomic ideas in practice and to distance the state from the explicit need to provide\nenergy as a public good but there have been other consequences. One is that the\nprivate sector became responsible for the typically large energy system investments\nrequired to provide reliable energy services--these include exploration and devel-\nopment as well as electricity generation, transmission and distribution. To this\nextent the UK government became dependent upon the private sector to deliver\ngoods and services upon which the UK population rely heavily to facilitate day-to-\nday life. This article will argue, below, that processes of marketised depoliticisation\nhave ultimately contributed to particular asymmetries of power between state and\nmarket actors in energy making certain forms of agency problematic in response to\n\u00a9 2015 The Author. British Journal of Politics and International Relations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd\non behalf of Political Studies Association\n112 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 18(1)\novert, new climate and security objectives. This is an argument about political\ncapacity to act to deliver collective good on an absolute and relative basis.\n1.2. `Technocratic' Depoliticisation\nThe second form of depoliticisation that has had an impact on the areas and\nprocesses through which UK energy governance decisions have been taken is\ntermed here `technocratic' depoliticisation. This form also stems from Hay's `Type\nOne' depoliticisation and occurs when an issue area, such as energy, that had been\nsubject to formal political deliberation and accountability becomes displaced to\nless obviously politicised arenas such as quasi-public or independent bodies (Hay\n2007, 83). This form is similar in many respects to the notion of `institutional'\nthe central role of technocratic experts and communities as opposed to majoritarian\ninstitutions within governance processes. Technocratic depoliticisation has been\napplied, for obvious reasons, particularly successfully to issue areas that are con-\nsidered to be highly technical and complex in nature (Hay 2007, 83). Government\nactors and civil servants that have espoused this form of depoliticisation often do so\non the grounds that (generalist) political actors are simply not qualified to take\neffective decisions in such technical, expert areas (Interviews 1, 2, 11 and 12). Such\narguments are, as discussed in more detail below, somewhat self-fulfilling.\nUK energy policy is understood here to have been subject to technocratic\ndepoliticisation during the 1990s under both Conservative and Labour administra-\ntions. This is not to say that energy had not previously been depoliticised in this\nway, indeed it has been argued that nationalised energy companies had operated\naccording to a high degree of technical dominance over decision-making (Helm\na new Department of Energy (DoE) was formed only a few years later in response\nto the oil crises of 1970s. National energy companies had, however, been put in\nplace with the objective of delivering a collective good in the form of secure and\naffordable energy services to all UK households and they were also responsible for\ncarrying out a national energy plan (Helm 2003).\ndifferent ideas and has produced in practice markedly different processes and areas\nof energy decision making. Of particular relevance this time was the idea that a\nseparation be made in governance terms between energy, as an economic sector,\nand politics, understood as state planning and public energy (Bromley 1991, 49;\nHelm 2003, 386). Margaret Thatcher had famously observed at the time that the\ntitle Department of Energy `... smacks of economic planning whereas our energy\nonce the process of privatisation had been launched, the DoE was again dissolved\nand responsibility for energy was placed within a sub-division of the Department\nfor Trade and Industry (DTI). The decision was also taken that there should be an\nindustry regulator, which ultimately became known as Ofgem, but that it should be\nindependent of government.\nbut this fundamental lack of capacity dedicated to energy governance had some\n\u00a9 2015 The Author. British Journal of Politics and International Relations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd\non behalf of Political Studies Association\nparticular lasting implications. Over time links to majoritarian institutions, such as\nParliament, became more tenuous. There was no longer a Secretary of State for\nEnergy, representation of energy issues at Cabinet level and, over the 1990s,\nParliamentary energy debates when they occurred were focused largely on how\nbest to privatise and liberalise energy (see Helm 2003). Energy became increasingly\nless `visible' as a policy area within majoritarian governance institutions. In this way\nit increasingly did become a technical sector of the economy suitable to the rigorous\nquantitative analysis of experts rather than elected representatives of state which\nfurther isolated energy from public debate and democratic scrutiny. All this suggests\nthat the way in which these institutions were depoliticised was about embedding\nlimited state involvement rather than equipping energy institutions to identify or\nrespond to societal outcomes of energy policy. As can be seen below the result of\nsuch processes was that energy had become the responsibility of technocrats who\nalthough more independent from government had firmer links with narrow gas\nand electricity company interests than with majoritarian politics.\n1.3. Non-deliberative Depoliticisation\nNon-deliberative depoliticisation as understood here tends to cut across\ncurrent characterisations of depoliticisation in that it does not sit squarely within\nany existing definition. There are resonances with Hay's `Type 3' and with\ndepoliticisation understood as re-enforcing rules and as preference shaping\n(Flinders and Buller 2006, 299) but with less of an emphasis on citing external\npressures and on politics as `fate'. This heuristic is closest in sense to Wood and\nFlinder's `discursive' depoliticisation, in that language and ideas are important, but\nagain the emphasis here is less on the intention to close down debate and more on\nexplaining why. Non-deliberative depoliticisation in energy refers to a lack of open\nand informed debate and deliberation within and between actor groups which, in\nturn, serves to shape and constrain choices. It is inspired by a long tradition of\nacademic and fictional work that has actively critiqued politics as orthodoxy\nAgain, the design of political institutions and how they operate is held here to\nbe important to understanding the drivers and impacts of non-deliberative\ndepoliticisation. We can learn more about how institutions can operate to limit\ndeliberation by turning to the work of sociological and discursive institutionalists\n(Yee 1996; Schmidt and Radaelli 2004). Institutions can and do, in practice, allow\nor restrict the access of certain social groups to political leaders and bureaucratic\nofficials (Yee 1996, 92) and set the parameters of what people talk about (Schmidt\nand Radaelli 2004, 197). This is arguably often the case with quasi-public institu-\ntions with less public visibility of their decisions and actions. What also becomes\nimportant is who is hired, what qualifications they have, what training is received\nonce hired, but ultimately which actors may offer credible information (Hay and\nWe can see these forms of closed communities in operation in energy--particularly\nin the 1990s and early to mid 2000s. Ofgem and the Energy Directorate of the DTI\nwere run by groups of likeminded experts and these experts tended to seek advise\nfrom other similarly trained groups such as accountancy firms (Mitchell 2008;\n\u00a9 2015 The Author. British Journal of Politics and International Relations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd\non behalf of Political Studies Association\n114 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 18(1)\nCarrington 2011; see also Ernst and Young 2006). The Energy Directorate of the DTI\nand Ofgem were, furthermore, mandated to maintain freely trading, competitive\nmarkets thereby protecting consumers (see also Mitchell 2008, 139; Scrase and\nOckwell 2009, 42). What is notable here is that these mandates were more about\ndelivering freely trading markets per se and less overtly about delivering energy\nspecific goals such as energy security, sustainability or affordability. In line with\nsuch mandates qualification as expert was defined less by in depth technical\nknowledge of energy markets or infrastructures but by previous, or on the job,\ntraining in classical economics and/or statistics (Interviews 1 and 2). This appears to\nhave limited debate and decision making to problem solving within existing frame-\nworks of ideas. As can be seen below personnel assigned to the Energy Directorate\nof the DTI moved from division to division on the understanding that as long as\nactors understood basic economic principles they could as easily make decisions\nabout energy as any other sector of the economy (Interviews 5 and 12). In the\nabsence of much specific energy expertise decisions were based on, often bounded,\neconomic models and statistics (Interviews 2 and 15).\nWhilst these forms of institutional design did serve to embed rules and limit choices\nin practice what arguably also happened was that decision-making areas became\nless able to respond in terms of understanding issues and problems as they arose. As\nwill be seen below, once problems were recognised and new objectives were put in\nplace energy policymaking institutions were less capable of offering non-market\nsolutions hence offering an explanation as to why UK policy has been so ideologi-\ncally bounded.\n2. Depoliticisations and Political Capacities in Energy\nSome have argued that although climate change has presented challenges it also, at\nleast theoretically, presents opportunities for new approaches to energy governance\nand imaginative thinking about how to facilitate the large-scale investments and\nbehavioural changes needed (Smith 2009, 54). This section of the article outlines\nimpacts of depoliticisations on energy decision-making processes that explain the\ndegree to which energy institutions have been slow to innovate and may prove\ninsufficient to deliver the new, energy specific goals adopted in the mid to late\n2000s. One example of an energy policy objective that may be missed is energy\nproduced from renewable sources. Whilst growing, the figure remains low, at 4.1%\n2012 4.5 million households were still in fuel poverty, a long way off the UK energy\ncontinue to rise (Which 2013, 8; see also HC ECC (House of Commons Energy and\nClimate Change Committee) 2013). Furthermore, energy supply security objectives\nare undermined by underinvestment in Britain's ageing generation capacities.\n2.1. Embedded Corporate Power\nThis sub-section will assess how processes of marketised depoliticisation have\nplayed out in practice emphasising high degrees of embedded corporate power in\n\u00a9 2015 The Author. British Journal of Politics and International Relations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd\non behalf of Political Studies Association\nsibility for energy to the private sector in practice resulted in a situation where\nprivate market actors became responsible for the provision of energy goods and\nservices--services that almost every household and business in society depends\nupon daily. Explanations for corporate power can be found in the decision to pass\nresponsibility for such important services to market actors but also in how the\nprocess of privatisation was pursued. In addition to the guiding notion of `markets\nknow best' there was one other, somewhat practical, principal at play during the\nprocess of privatising energy companies which was that of making sure that the\nsector was profitable enough to private investors (Thomas 2006; Wilks 2013). It has\nbeen argued that this principal, as well as that of allowing market actors to make\ndecisions about the energy industry, was important to the somewhat controversial\ndecision to allow vertical integration in UK gas and electricity companies (Thomas\n2006). Vertical integration, allowing generation and supply assets to be held by one\ncorporation, was not part of the original design of energy market privatisation and\nliberalisation but was allowed to evolve in a piecemeal fashion as various market\nThe UK is serviced now by an oligopoly of six, mainly multinational owned,\nintegrated companies that supply 92% of the domestic electricity market and 75%\nof the domestic gas market and that hold a high degree of market knowledge and\nin-house trading and procurement, with implications for transparency, liquidity\nand pricing, but also provided the `Big 6' companies with high levels of knowledge\nand data about UK energy markets and how they operate. This knowledge is\nlucrative but also, importantly, indispensable to anyone trying to design a sustain-\nable energy transition whilst also meeting affordability and security objectives\n(Interviews 10, 17 and 21). Gas and electricity companies, furthermore, are not\nrequired to share such industry knowledge and data--in fact DECC are soon to use\npooled state funds to pay industry for information that they consider vital to\nmaking policy decisions because they simply do not have access to it (Civil Service\nCompanies have long realised the value of vertical integration (Rutledge 2010), but\npolitical institutions are only now overtly recognising the impact that this has had\non the electricity supply industry--not least in terms of constructing barriers to\nentry to more innovative and sustainable new business models (Ofgem 2014).\nIncumbent companies, furthermore, use their market and political power to lobby\nstrongly and have been central to consultancy processes that have underpinned\nAs observed above, another outcome of passing responsibility to the private sector\nhas been that UK political institutions now rely on private companies to invest in\nnew energy infrastructures. Both energy security and climate change mitigation are\ndependent upon sufficient investment taking place in capital-intensive infrastruc-\ntures and new technologies required for security and climate change mitigation\n(Smith 2009). The scale of this problem is now overtly recognised in that it is\nestimated that that 20 per cent of UK electricity plant generation capacity is due to\nclose by 2022 whilst there are those that claim that some energy companies, post\n\u00a9 2015 The Author. British Journal of Politics and International Relations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd\non behalf of Political Studies Association\n116 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 18(1)\nprivatisation, went about sweating their considerable assets instead of investing in\nnew infrastructures (Smith 2009, 54). As a consequence, and in order to deliver\nonly on the objective of energy supply security, DECC now estimates that \u00a3110bn\nThis all results in a considerable headache for UK energy policymakers--specifically\nhow to deliver new objectives whilst relying on private enterprises that have little\nincentive to do so. The overriding difficultly here is that, although responsible for\ndelivering energy objectives and implementing policies, gas and electricity compa-\nnies are not answerable to society as a whole but to multinational parent companies,\nshareholders and, in a limited sense, to customers. The primary objective of private\ngas and electricity companies is to make profits, which should preferably grow year\non year, and then to either re-invest profits back into the business or deliver\n`surplus' capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and/or through share\nbuy-back schemes. Multinational companies can, furthermore, decide whether to\nreinvest in the UK or invest profits elsewhere. In addition, dividends on offer from\nthe Big 6 are generous, their dividend ratios vary from 5% to 7.8%, and one\nrecently claimed that its strategic priority is sustained dividend growth (SSE\nwebsite). Clearly this use of `surplus' capital, at a time when the UK needs to secure\ninvestment in aging generation and low carbon transition, is problematic for\ngovernment.\nWhat this means is that the political capacity to implement new or alternative\npolicies is constrained by the need to keep incumbents in profit and shareholders\nhappy, and by corporate knowledge and market power. This helps us to understand\nhow these important power asymmetries have had an impact upon the ability of\npolitical institutions to deliver on societal objectives, but it also helps us to under-\nstand the degree to which marketised depoliticisation has served to benefit narrow\ninterests over the delivery of policy objectives. This observation is of note given that\nsome conceptualisations of depoliticisation are that delegation of responsibility is\nabout achieving state objectives through the market (Burnham 2011, 465).\n2.2. Disjunctures Between Majoritarian Institutions\nand Technocrats\nThe dissolution of the DoE in 1992, outlined above, and other attempts to place\ndecision-making at arm's length from government were compounded in the late\ngovernment institutions. It has been noted that personnel dedicated to carrying out\nthe necessary analysis and problem solving in energy were by the late 1990s and\nearly 2000s at a low point, and that the role of `Minister for Energy', which had\nbeen passed around on an almost yearly basis, had been downgraded to a status\nmeriting only a `part-time minister', let alone a Secretary of State reporting directly\ncapacity provides one explanation as to why it took such a long time, certainly in\ncomparison with countries like Germany, for climate change to make any serious\nimpact on energy policy (see Mitchell 2008). For example although some high\nprofile challenges had emerged, the 2000 Royal Commission on Environmental\n\u00a9 2015 The Author. British Journal of Politics and International Relations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd\non behalf of Political Studies Association\nPollution and the 2002 Policy and Innovation Unit review of energy policy had both\nrecommended quite profound restructurings of energy policy, their recommenda-\ntions were only partially taken up in the 2003 White Paper (PIU (Policy and\nof DECC in 2008, tacit recognition that the Energy Directorate of the DTI was\ninsufficient, there have been enduring limitations to understandings of the scale of\nwhat is required. One review of DECC has highlighted the fact that whilst it is the\nsecond smallest department in government it has the second largest portfolio to\ndeliver and that it does not `have the capacity to deliver its portfolio' (Civil Service\nDecisions to make sure that the regulator, Ofgem, should be `independent' of\ngovernment have had other implications that take us back to observations above\nabout relative power relations between private and public sectors. In order for\nOfgem to make significant changes to some of the regulations governing UK gas and\nelectricity markets, in the form of industry codes, it needs to seek the agreement of\nenergy incumbents (Interviews 10 and 22). For example any alterations to the\nBalancing and Settlement Code (BSC), that forms a large part of how electricity and\ngas companies are regulated, must be approved by the BSC Panel.2 The majority of\nBSC panel members are, however, representatives of the large, incumbent gas and\nelectricity companies (Interviews 10 and 21). As such, even if Ofgem were to\nsuggest radical changes to energy governance these need the approval of the Big 6\nand this has in practice tended make Ofgem less `independent' of the interests of\nthese companies. This matters in particular when markets are not delivering on the\nobjectives of policy and when the interests of the Big 6 and government are not\naligned.\nThere have been further consequences for political capacity in energy, and in\nparticular for politics as social interaction. Arm's-length energy decision-making\nprocesses in practice isolated majoritarian institutions from thinking about energy\nas a policy area. Without a Secretary of State for Energy reporting regularly to\nCabinet and or Parliament there were fewer possibilities for ongoing learning and\nknowledge building through exposure to this complex subject. Those that should\nserve as the formal channels of communication between society and government,\nfor example MPs, were in these ways left out of the energy loop thereby fulfilling\nthe notion that political actors cannot effectively manage. Such practices have been\nexacerbated by the extent to which technocratic experts employed within energy\ninstitutions continued to believe that politics should not interfere in economic\ntechnocrats set the parameters of how energy was analysed and discussed and the\nparameters themselves, the methodologies and language used were often also\nhighly technical in nature and unintelligible to lay people, be they MPs or other\nmembers of the public (Interview 10). Furthermore, technical experts purposefully\nplaced at arm's length from government arguably have less incentive or capacity to\nunderstand energy policy within the broader objectives of collective social policy\n(Interviews 10 and 17). This has led to observations that narrow analytical meth-\nodologies adopted have resulted in missed opportunities to develop and improve\n\u00a9 2015 The Author.

Households become\n`consumers' that expect a certain service at a price as part of a business\nrelationship--neither particularly aware of the nature of energy services nor active\nparticipants in pursuing a collective goal. The complexities of providing this service,\nnot least in terms of the infrastructures such as transmission grids that they are\ndependent upon, have become less and less visible to end users.3 A lack of knowl-\nedge about how energy systems work plays heavily to the detriment of those\npolicies that are designed to encourage wider participation in energy demand\nreduction and efficiency improvement (see Rosenow et al. 2013). It narrows the\nterms of debate down to pricing and costs in the absence of sufficient and ongoing\ncommunication about the complex but hidden energy infrastructures and\nabout how households can alter their energy practices. In that technocratic\ndepoliticisation reduces the visibility of energy and erodes connections between\npolicy and society this has implications for trust in political authority (see Stern\n1987, 498). One study has highlighted the erosion of trust in governance and in\npolitical abilities to manage sustainable energy trajectories (Rayner 2009).\n2.3. Negating Politics as Informed Deliberation and Choice\nThis last sub-section on the outcomes of depoliticisation emphasises a reduction in\nthe capacity for politics as deliberation and as choice between different solutions to\nproblems. The first point to be made here highlights the way in which parameters\nset, for example mandates and hiring practices, influence a whole range of out-\ncomes. The tighter the boundaries are set the less possible it is to openly contest,\ndeliberate or to choose from different approaches to governing energy. The way in\nwhich Ofgem and the Energy Directorate of the DTI were initially mandated and\nstructured served to embed the idea that the proper role of government was as a\nregulator of services delivered by market organisations (Wilks 2013, 126). As noted\nin section 1.3 above in the absence of specific energy objectives technocratic experts\ntended not to be energy experts but generalist economists and statisticians (Inter-\nviews 2, 5, 11, 21). Energy expertise, as a result, has rested more with private actors\nthan with government institutions grappling with the task of redesigning them and\nthere are arguments that this, and high staff turnover, has delayed the identification\nand implementation of some sustainable energy policies (Interviews 10, 16 and 22).\nOne claim is that a focus on economic variables left technocrats for too long blind\nto non-economic factors such as human consumption and behaviour or to the need\nfor energy sources such as renewable energy (Mitchell 2008, 31). It has also been\nobserved that although `smart meters', designed to help households become more\naware of and efficient in their energy usage, were identified in 2006 as worth\npursuing it took a number of years before energy policymakers even understood a\nrange of technical elements of smart meters and how they would work in relation\nto current energy systems (Interview 22).\nAnother key to understanding why so little radical energy policy innovation has\ntaken place is that originally, when first faced with the idea of pursuing climate\nchange mitigation objectives, UK policymakers had argued that markets would\ndeliver (Department of the Environment 1990). This faith in markets was to remain\n\u00a9 2015 The Author. British Journal of Politics and International Relations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd\non behalf of Political Studies Association\nprominent within energy decision-making processes for some time but was based\non a whole range of uncontested assumptions. For example it was understood that\nconsumers would `demand' renewable energy and companies would therefore\nhave to deliver (IEA (International Energy Agency) 1998, 67), competition would\ndrive renewable energy development (DETR 2000), and freely trading markets\nwere a prerequisite for the provision of energy supply security (Mitchell et al. 2001,\n177). Assumptions about how energy should be governed also for some time\nspecifically ruled out government decisions about what mix of energy technologies\nthe UK should have, intervention in markets, or directing energy investments (DTI\nLater, in 2003, when energy policy was first allocated energy and climate-specific\nobjectives these were vaguely worded, replete with get out clauses such as `where\npossible' (DTI 2003, 11), and the assumption remained that markets would deliver.\nWhat is important about this assumption is that by accepting climate objectives it\nwas understood that little would need to change in terms of pro-market energy\npolicy (Kuzemko 2013, 111), thereby arguably also vastly underestimating the scale\nof the problem. Technocrats continued to either remain ignorant of or actively\nreject other voices that recommended more profound government involvement\nOne interviewee at Ofgem suggested that they designed their review of energy\nmarkets, Project Discovery, to make it look as if they had considered more `radical'\nsolutions but were always going to choose instruments that had least impact on\nfreely-trading markets (Interview 11). The lack of ability of DECC and Ofgem staff\nto think outside the box, as well as knowledge loss due to staff turnover, has\nrecently been recognised and some attempts are now under way to open techno-\nHowever, it began to become apparent, over the course of the mid to late 2000s,\nthat markets were not delivering on investment in traditional as well as new energy\ninfrastructure, and technology politicians and technocrats were limited to an expla-\nabout this neoclassical economics explanation of climate and energy security prob-\nlems is that although the appropriate response is government intervention such\ninterventions have been weak and, by design, temporary. Indeed, it has been\nargued that the conceptualisation of energy-related problems as market failure has\nin practice limited the response of government to raising the level of market signals\nthe recent Electricity Market Reform (EMR) is designed both to pay a set price for\nclean energy but also to incentivise market players to invest in new (but not\nnecessarily low carbon) capacity. These incentives and interventions are explicitly\ndesigned to be temporary:\nThe reforms in the Energy Bill are specifically designed to move us away\nfrom such intervention--and blaze a trail towards competition. That is\nIn 2013 the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change stated that once new\nenergy and climate frameworks have been put in place government intervention\ncan recede and DECC can be reduced in size (Davey in HC ECC (House of Commons\n\u00a9 2015 The Author. British Journal of Politics and International Relations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd\non behalf of Political Studies Association\n120 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 18(1)\nEnergy and Climate Change Committee) 2013). This remains in line with Nigel\nLawson's statement of 1983 that once government frameworks have been put in\nplace markets should be allowed to function with a minimum of distortion.\nTemporary and weak interventions and instruments that seek to incentivise\ninvestment but not disrupt markets are a far cry from suggestions within sustainable\nenergy policy literatures, such as those put forward by Transitions Management\nscholars, that energy transition requires ongoing and sustained government capacity\nand support, knowledge building, learning-by-doing and flexibility (Lehtonen and\nKern 2009). One critique is that the UK's sustainable energy policy is patchy, lacking\nin vision and small scale, whilst what is needed is the creation of new markets and\nnew relationships between state and private sector institutions (Mazzucato 2013,\n120 and 124\u00ad6). The lack of ability to do so is seen as causal in the UK's position as\na laggard in development of clean energy and associated technologies behind other\ncountries, such as Germany and China, that are becoming the clean technology\nleaders of the future (ibid). Conditions of non-deliberation have been shown here to\nhave restricted UK energy policy-making choices in practice and to have limited\nopportunities for knowledge building and learning-by-doing.\nConclusions\nIt was suggested in the introduction to this article that two contributions would be\nmade. One has been to offer depoliticisation as a conceptual approach that can help\nto explain why UK energy policy has been so limited in its response to significant\nnew challenges. Taken together the heuristic forms of depoliticisation applied in this\nanalysis have revealed specific lacks in capacity but also some reasons as to why\nthere has been ideological lock-in related to what rules and norms became embed-\nded. Various aspects of institutional design, such as hiring and training practices and\nthe focus on economics over energy, have mattered not least in that they explain a\nlack of government energy system knowledge as well as knowledge of the impacts\nof energy policy on society. The analysis here also shines a light on the gulf that\ncurrently exists between those that argue for a central and knowledge-building role\nfor the state in energy transition and the constrained nature of some of the choices\nmade so far in the UK. By trusting in markets to deliver and by under-investing in\nenergy institutions and knowledge the UK has to an extent destroyed its own\ncapacity to deliver transition.\nThe second contribution is to depoliticisation literatures in terms of arguments\nabout, and empirical evidence of, the collective impacts of depoliticisations on\npolitical capacities, potentially including the capacity to meet policy objectives. The\nevidence here suggests that each form of depoliticisation has been contingent upon,\nand reinforced by, economic ideas about the appropriate role for states and markets\nin the field of energy. What has also emerged as important to understanding\npolitical capacities has been a consideration of the precise ways in which\ndepoliticisations were pursued in practice. For example it was not only significant\nthat marketised depoliticisation by design passed greater responsibility to private\nsector actors, but the decision to allow vertical integration also had significant\nimplications for relative political capacities in terms of knowledge and economic\npower.\n\u00a9 2015 The Author. British Journal of Politics and International Relations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd\non behalf of Political Studies Association\nIt has been necessary, when trying to assess the impact on political capacity, to be\nclear about how politics is conceptualised here. Politics as capable of deliberation,\nchoice and of delivering collective goods, such as sustainable energy system tran-\nsitions, requires that energy policymaking institutions be redesigned in multiple\nways. Energy as a collective good upon which so many depend remains a highly\npolitical subject and transition unprecedented and replete with risks. This combi-\nnation must surely require dedicated forward planning, greater and more consistent\nenergy knowledge-building within government, less reliance on `big' business to\ndeliver objectives and more emphasis on supporting and providing information for\nUK publics. In order for government to commit to institutions capable of perform-\ning such functions there would need to be some considerable shift in thinking about\nthe benefits of depoliticisation. By explicitly posing questions about depoliticisation\nin practice and by explaining how it has destroyed certain kinds of institutional\ncapacity this article might assist in such a re-think.\n"
