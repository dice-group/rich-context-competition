Experiencing this kind of transformation does\nnot happen in isolation, but requires the active involvement\nof skilled educators who wish to grow professionally.\nReflective practice, by its very nature, begins with a degree\nof self-reflection, cultivating a higher level of self-awareness\nor consciousness (York-Barr, Sommers, Ghere, & Montie,\n2006). Only when reflective practices have been applied to\nthe self can they be extended to others (Osterman &\nKottkamp, 2006). Reflective practice is gaining momentum\nand becoming more visible in social studies contexts.\nReflective practice is critical for \"significant and sus-\ntained school improvement. Experience by itself is not\nenough. Reflection on experience is the pathway to improve-\nment\" (York-Barr et al., 2006, p. xvii). Educators should\nfamiliarize themselves with reflective practice to better\nunderstand how it can drive curriculum processes. Reflective\npractice is one of the most effective ways teachers can help\nsustain motivation and clear decision making.\nIn this article, current reflective practices in the social\nstudies are examined in light of how these strategies can add\nvalue and meaning to social studies curriculums. Many of\nthese reflective practices were introduced within teacher\neducation programs' social studies methods courses, to\nexpose pre-service teachers to innovative teaching practices\nthat could be used in the classroom. While there is no uni-\nversal definition of reflective practice, there are some per-\nspectives that researchers have offered to help clarify how\none can engage in reflective practice. These perspectives\ninclude\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Evaluate actions, decisions, or products by focusing\non the process of achieving stated goals.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Use creative thinking and imagining to critically pon-\nder current practices.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Consider actions with the goal of improving practice.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Question and develop a commitment to regular dis-\ncovery and analysis of data regarding actions.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Use action-based processes that promote reaction,\nforethought, and insight.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Make rational choices and assume responsibility for\neducational practices and policies.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Explore underlying beliefs, biases, and knowledge in\na deliberate cognitive analysis of thoughts and ideas.\n1Edison State College, Ft.

New pedagogical models, such as those discussed in\nthis article, are needed and reflective practitioners have\nanswered the call. They are conceiving new ways to revive\nan ailing social studies program in the public school system\nby going to the source--pre-service teaching education pro-\ngrams. The researchers selectively examine some traditional\nand non-traditional methods for promoting student learning\nand growth through reflective practices.\nThe Textbook Question and Explicit\nReasoning Text (ERT)\nThe textbook has dominated the history curriculum for more\nthan a century and the results, as measured through demon-\nstrable historical thinking skills in students, have been less\ntory students believed the textbook to be authoritative and\ntrustworthy. History professors, however, viewed the text-\nbook with skepticism, noting it was the least trustworthy his-\ntorical document available. In spite of this revelation,\ntextbooks continue to dominate the history curriculum in\nsecondary and higher education.\nAgain, reliance on textbooks as the centerpiece of the cur-\nriculum promotes a myopic and skewed understanding of\nsocial studies, history, other cultures, and the world.\nTextbooks tend to be nationalistic in their orientation with\nsome scholars suggesting they be treated as propaganda,\nwhile also being filled with outdated \"facts,\" omissions, and\nWineburg, Martin, & Monte-Sano, 2011). VanSledright\n(2010) argued that textbooks simply sugarcoat or ignore the\nless appealing aspects of history in favor of more popular\nnarratives. This post-modernist assumption has become pop-\nularized in recent years, but insisting on covering more mate-\nrial in an already dense textbook is not the answer either\nbooks from the 1960s and today and found, when analyzing\nthe Cuban Missile Crisis, that much of the same content\nremained unchanged, though new evidence has come to light\nand historiography has changed over the course of half a cen-\ntury. To his amazement, Schneider noted, the textbooks sam-\npled were grossly inaccurate and promoted myth and\nlegend more than anything. \"Sometimes, in fact,\" Schneider\nlamented, \"they're [textbooks] just plain wrong\" (p. 126).\nA point that is new in reflective practice literature is that\ntextbooks are not only dangerous to students and their\nachievement, growth, and development but also to the pro-\nfessional health of teachers. For Stacy (2013), the textbook is\nnothing more than a \"scripted curriculum\" that impedes the\nintellectual and professional development of teachers (p. 41).\nRather than substituting meaningful instruction with text-\nbook readings and written assignments culled from the text-\nbook, Stacy suggests facilitating dynamic classroom\nactivities, such as those discussed in this article, that chal-\nlenge students, pique their interests, and grab their attention.\nTextbooks do not engage students; why teachers, admin-\nistrators, school boards, and teacher education programs\ncontinue to insist on their use is baffling. In a recent compre-\nhensive survey study of 328 teachers in the state of California,\nresearchers found that 96.6% of respondents used textbooks\nregularly in instruction while 97.2% of respondents used lec-\ntures predominantly to communicate to their students\nauthors expressed concern over \"the importance of using\nother sources besides textbooks, the standardization of infor-\nmation resulting in the limited opportunity for students to\nimmerse themselves in inquiry projects generated from their\ncuriosity about time and/or a place,\" and \"the absence of cur-\nricular materials to help students engage with their world and\nbuild a greater understanding of our global community\"\nThe title of Loewen's (2009) most recent book, Teaching\nWhat Really Happened: How to Avoid the Tyranny of\nTextbooks and Get Students Excited About Doing History, is\ndevoted to exposing the deleterious effects of the textbook\nand persuasively argued for its removal from the curriculum.\nIn recent years, Loewen has been joined by Ravitch (2011) in\nexcoriating textbooks as the \"de facto curriculum\" across the\nUnited States (p. 237). How can textbooks form the founda-\ntion, the backbone, of the high school history curriculum,\nwhen they are filled with factual errors, blatant misrepresen-\ntations, omissions, political persuasions, and outdated\nmaterial?\nIn spite of the many flaws present in history textbooks,\nsome scholars believe there is a middle ground between\nwholesale acceptance of textbooks and eliminating them\nentirely from the curriculum. As Pearcy (2013) recently\nobserved,\nTextbooks are deserving of much of the criticism aimed at\nthem--but the solution most often suggested, simply getting rid\nof them, is at odds with the reality of most classrooms. What is\nnecessary, then, is not a wholesale abandonment of textbooks,\nbut a set of tools that enable a more meaningful use of them.\nOne \"middle ground\" proposal that is worthy of consider-\nation is Lee's (2013) ERT. \"Because textbooks continue to be\nthe most widely used historical resource for teachers and stu-\ndents,\" Lee opted to retain textbooks in the classroom but\nwith one important modification--they would be filled with\nexplanatory notes that would \"walk\" students through vari-\nous historical processes developing their historical thinking\nskills (p. 2). Truly, as Lee noted, this would be a \"new type of\nhistorical text\" for students to explore history from a\nBerg and Shaw 3\ndisciplinary point-of-view (p. 2). What distinguishes the\nERT from conventional textbooks (CTs), according to Lee, is\nthe student-centric approach of these narratives that eluci-\ndate the historical thinking process in a guided manner for\nstudents to see rather than expecting (or hoping!) them to\ncome to these conclusions on their own. Lee's study posed\nquestions to students after randomly reading excerpts of the\nBattle of Lexington from a CT and an ERT. Lee found that\nstudents were able to answer her questions more fully and, at\ntimes, to even pose their own questions to further a line of\ninquiry after reading the ERT. What Lee is quick to note is\nthat, as Reisman and Wineburg (2008) have noted, \"histori-\ncal thinking is by its nature an invisible process\" (p. 204).\nThe ERT method is an attractive alternative to CTs because it\nreveals the historical logic and processes of an otherwise\nconcluded,\nWhile replacing all history textbooks could prove challenging\nand costly, this study suggests benefits might outweigh the\nobstacles in exploring this new form of next text if we want\nstudents to see history as more than one fact after another and to\nlearn to reason historically. (p. 12)\nDialogue Journals\nThe scholarly literature has reflected an increased awareness\nof the usefulness of reflective practice and its incorporation\ninto teacher education programs. Camicia and Read (2011)\nexplored the relationship between a select group of pre-ser-\nvice teachers and their fourth- and fifth-grade partners in a\nstudy demonstrating the effectiveness of dialogue conversa-\ntions recorded in journals and its connection to increased\nawareness of civic mindedness among the participants. The\npurpose of this qualitative study, according to the authors,\nwas to reveal a direct correlation between the reflective prac-\ntice of journaling about social studies topics as a means of\nsensitizing elementary school students to their eventual\nduties as educated and informed citizens and of the demo-\ncratic values embodied in the United States.\nThe study examined how dialogue journal activity might\nhelp pre-service teachers understand the reading, writing, and\nperspectives of elementary school students through an inter-\nactive experience that immersed pre-service teachers into the\n\"world\" of elementary school students to better understand\nhow they think and learn. The authors argued that the social\nstudies have become \"marginalized\" and are no longer treated\nas a viable subject worthy of consideration (Camicia & Read,\ndegenerated over the years with many teachers relying on\ncookbook style textbooks to \"teach\" elementary school stu-\ndents about history, geography, and government. In fact,\nCamicia and Read's (2011) research corroborated the above\nassertion, noting that most elementary school teachers relied\nheavily on using a core textbook as the tried-and-true\ncurricular tool in their classrooms. This pre-fabricated,\nmechanical curricular and pedagogical process hinders the\npossibility of students engaging the material, challenging\ntheir cognitive functioning, flexing their creative juices, and\nexploring and making discoveries. A textbook-centered cur-\nriculum has been shown to be the root cause of intellectual\nstagnation and potentially damaging to a learner's ability to\ndevelop critical or historical thinking skills (Pearcy, 2011;\nCamicia and Read (2011) noted that the elementary school\nstudents, teachers, and pre-service teachers benefited from\nthe dialogue journal exercises, specifically, the teachers were\nafforded a lens into the minds of their students, while pre-\nservice teachers \"gain[ed] valuable insights into the motiva-\ntion, writing, and thought processes of elementary students\nwhen the pre-service teachers form pen pal relationships\nwith elementary students\" (Camicia & Read, 2011, pp.\n24-25). Furthermore, the authors concluded that all the par-\nticipants benefited substantially from the dialogue journals.\nThe unconventional nature of the dialogue journals promoted\ngreater engagement, which resulted in student-led learning\namong elementary school students. Moreover, the elemen-\ntary school students and the pre-service teachers recognized\nthe importance and value of multiple perspectives, with\nmany of the pre-service teachers marveling at the marked\nimprovements shown by elementary school students in their\nreasoning abilities, empathy, and general knowledge of\nworld events and cultures. Although a small study, Camicia\nand Read (2011) have shown the learning possibilities hid-\nden in reflective practices such as journaling that can be used\nas an instructional tool for teachers who venture to construct\nalternative curriculum choices.\nIntroducing dialogue journals, or \"written conversations\"\nas the authors termed it, would facilitate dialogue and trigger\ndiscussions between elementary students and pre-service\nteachers exposing both to multiple perspectives, a valuable\nconceptual framework in the study of history and in critical\nthinking more generally. Pre-service teachers would not only\nsee a complementary viewpoint through the eyes of their\nelementary school partner but, by going through this process,\nalso better understand the importance, indeed necessity, of\nconsidering the voice of multiple perspectives. This is a fun-\ndamental consideration often missing from discussions cen-\ntering on social studies or history curriculums at all levels of\neducation.\nCulturally Responsive Teaching\nFitchett, Starker, and Good (2010) researched the effective-\nness of culturally responsive teaching (CRT) in the social\nstudies classroom. This qualitative study included an explo-\nration of 20 teacher candidates in a social studies methods\ncourse where the authors used an interactive pedagogical\npractice utilizing the \"Review, Reflect, and React\" concep-\ntual model. The results of the data were mixed: On one hand,\n4 SAGE Open\nthe authors concluded that the teacher candidates success-\nfully integrated thematic analyses into their lesson plans due\nto the reflective practice incorporated into the conceptual\nmodel. However, the teacher candidates had a poor com-\nmand of content knowledge resulting in the textbook becom-\ning the instructional tool of choice.\nThe authors argued that standardization in the way history\nis recorded and presented in the secondary classroom is the\n21st-century students' greatest enemy. To be more precise,\nthe authors are in fact advocating and advancing a post-mod-\nernist response to history and social studies education. They\nallege that a uniform and standardized history curriculum\nresults in a lop-sided, perhaps even discriminatory, curricu-\nlum. The current social studies and history curricula in the\nUnited States conveys to non-White students that their \"his-\ntories\" are unimportant and perpetuates the myth of an\nancient, grand narrative. In essence, the underrepresented\npeoples are purposely marginalized and thus have no voice\nor place in the history of their country as depicted by social\nstudies and history textbooks.\nThe specific language used by the authors, however, can\nbe traced back to another contentious and inflammatory intel-\nlectual upheaval in the 1980s. The Orientalist debates between\nEdward Said and Bernard Lewis were articulated with similar\nverbiage: \"pro-Western paradigm,\" \"Eurocentrism,\" \"mod-\nernist epistemology,\" and \"cultural and intellectual dominion\nover the other\" to name a few (Fitchett et al., p. 2). Two par-\nticular phrases are worthy of note because of their connection\nto Said. It could be argued that these phrases were invented by\nSaid--\"the other\" and \"exhibitionism\" (p. 2). Moreover, Said\nalleged that the West perpetrated every conceivable crime\nagainst a weak and unsuspecting East. These fabricated\ncrimes were at time couched in language that alleged sexual\nviolence against the East by the West. The specific use of the\nterm exhibitionism reminded the author of the sexual imagery\nSaid frequently used in his \"critique\" of the West.\nWhile their post-modernist critique of social studies and\nhistory curriculums is problematic, the authors pinpoint the\ninherent danger of textbooks: \"historical meanings are con-\nstructed as absolute truths\" (Fitchett et al., p. 2). Here is why\nthe textbook is challenging as the preferred instructional\nmedium because the \"omniscient voices\" of the text bear the\nunmistakable seal of authority (Lee, 2013, p. 1). Like the\nnoted that the social studies curriculum and its retelling of\nevents is a vital link or bridge between students and their\neventual roles as dutiful citizens. If the story they learn and\nbelieve is flawed, so too will be their assumptions and beliefs\nand the decisions they make based on their flawed reasoning.\nIn effect, they are unable to realize their full potential as citi-\nzens in a democratic nation because they were taught to\naccept the authorized version of history without question,\nrather than exercising caution. Students do not need to be\nschooled in textbook reading to become informed citizens.\nWhat 21st-century learners need is to develop critical\nthinking skills necessary to grapple with tough questions. The\npassive activity of textbook reading only exacerbates the situ-\nation, leaving students gullible and fragile. Reflective practi-\ntioners and other progressive educators have advocated for a\nstudent-centered approach to teaching and the authors found\nthat in their study of culturally responsive teaching, a learner-\noriented curriculum works best when the textbook is subordi-\nnated in favor of the student (Osterman & Kottkamp, 2006).\nPersona Doll Project\nMany of the reflective practices discussed in this essay were\nexperimentally tested in social studies methods courses in\nteacher education programs. One of the most difficult tasks\nconfronting reflective practitioners and novice teachers are\nchanging innate theories-in-use (York-Barr et al., 2006).\nTheories-in-use are ingrained deeply in everyone and merely\nrecognizing their presence is not enough to bring about sus-\ntainable change. Introducing creative applications, such as\nthe Persona Doll Project (Logue & Kim, 2011), allow pre-\nservice teachers the opportunity to explore new ways to\nbecome conscious participants in their own professional\ndevelopment. Innovative curriculums, that include experien-\ntial lessons, gently condition the pre-service teachers to\nundergo a degree of metamorphosis, whereby old theories-\nin-use are replaced with new, reflective properties.\nLogue and Kim's (2011) expectations were to increase\npre-service teachers' awareness of diversity through a per-\nsonal, experiential exercise pairing each participant with a\nPersona Doll representing a \"learner\" from a socio-eco-\nnomic/cultural background different from their own.\nThe Persona Doll was given to 63 students in a social\nstudies methods course. The desired outcome, explained the\nauthors, was for the pre-service teacher to become a vocal\nadvocate to the learner by being intimately exposed to the\nlearner's socio-economic background and unique personal\nhistory and circumstances. A stated purpose of teacher edu-\ncation programs is to prepare pre-service teachers for the\nchallenges of the classroom, one of which is teaching and\nmanaging a class of diverse populations. Living in a multi-\ncultural society requires that prospective teachers become\nacquainted with their own privately held beliefs, prejudices,\nand biases and developing an attitude of acceptance and\ninclusion where students of various backgrounds will feel\nsafe and comfortable.\nThe Persona Doll Project endeavors to expose pre-service\nteachers to reflective practice through the lens of diversity\neducation.\nDiversity education that will change attitudes and teaching\npractices helps candidates understand themselves and how their\nown individual family and ethnic cultures affect their learning\nand problem solving skills, and in turn, how they can use each\nchild's unique background to support teaching and learning.\nBerg and Shaw 5\nReflective writing practices, such as weekly journal writ-\nings, autobiographical sketches, and case studies were fun-\ndamental to tracing the evolutionary changes of the\npre-service teachers' general attitudes about diversity educa-\ntion and their role in engendering that change. Logue and\nKim (2011) used a quasi-grounded theory approach relying\nheavily on constant comparative analysis to mark noticeable\nshifts or gradations of change in each teacher candidate's\nattitudes and beliefs over the course of a semester. One of the\nstrengths of the study was the extended time period, which\ncovered 3 years and was conducted over the course of 4\nsemesters.\nThe Persona Doll Project gave many of these pre-service\nteachers their first introduction to the types of myriad stu-\ndents they would typically come across in school settings.\nAnd, the authors contend, this allows them a chance to grap-\nple with tough situations they may have never encountered\nbefore in an observational setting. This clinical trial bloom\nwould give them the skills necessary to successfully navigate\nthe emotional straits of a particular student's circumstances\nwithout passing judgment and to handle delicate situations\nwith confidence.\nAnother strength of the Persona Doll Project was facilitat-\ning a discussion-based feedback system where fellow stu-\ndents and teachers constructively critiqued and advised one\nanother in an effort to become more sensitive teachers. This\ndynamic learning process is at the heart of reflective prac-\ntice. Pre-service teachers regularly exercised critical think-\ning skills, where they presented ideas, received constructive\nfeedback, and analyzed and reflected on their thinking and\nbeliefs in light of their colleagues'suggestions, before finally\npresenting to a \"live\" class. These simulations were useful\nexercises. Their success, it can be argued, is in large part due\nto the safe environment they worked in where they were able\nto \"build trust with one another,\" a key ingredient to reflec-\ntive practice and self growth and development (Logue &\nThe study was successful in achieving its goals, which\nwere to expose pre-service teachers, in a meaningful way, to\ndiverse learning populations and, through that experience,\nchallenge and change their attitudes and beliefs toward\ndiverse learners so that they would become an advocate for\nall learners.\nMask-Making\nInfusing other closely related fields of study, such as the cre-\native arts, into social studies curriculum and instruction is a\nmulti-dimensional avenue to capture the learner through\nengaging their creativity through physical mediums (art)\nwhile raising the learner's vested interest in the exercise by\nlearning more about the significance and history of the proj-\nect. Rule and Montgomery (2011) proposed a study that\nintrigued their 65 pre-service elementary school teacher-par-\nticipants, in a social studies methods course, in a way rarely\noffered in teacher education--mask-making. The greatest\nhindrance, in the authors' opinions, is the \"current assess-\nment-focused climate\" which has reached epidemic levels\nacross the United States (p. 58). Because high-stakes testing,\nassessment, and general standardization are the cornerstones\nof education today, teachers are unable or reticent to try new\npossibilities to engage their students. For many, it is a scary\nproposition. But Pace reassures forward-thinking teachers to\nremember that learning experiences are essential in the his-\ntory classroom and that one isolated incident cannot properly\nmeasure adequate levels of learning or comprehension. \"It is\nquite possible,\" Pace (2011) remarked, \"that deep learning\nrequires a longer time to sink in and that it may only be fully\nvisible a year or even multiple years after the process has\nbeen initiated in a particular class\" (p. 117). With that in\nmind, reflective teachers should proceed confidently, know-\ning that the simple fact of introducing a new concept or idea\nmay not result in immediate, demonstrable results but could\npay dividends in the future for their students. Continuing to\nchallenge and encourage students to think outside-the-box\nand to approach learning with reckless abandon is the top\npriority of the reflective teacher.\nRule and Montgomery (2011) argued for a curriculum\nthat values the merits of other disciplines, such as the arts,\nand that there is a viable alternative to traditional social stud-\nies instruction. \"Integration of the arts into social studies\nlearning can be an enriching endeavor,\" they assure their\nother marginalized subjects, can help infuse the social stud-\nies with creative outlets otherwise untapped and expose\nlearners to other cultures in a way that other activities cannot.\nMask-making allows students to engage mentally and physi-\ncally with the material while exercising independence in cre-\native license, thought, and processes that lead to the eventual\nproduction of a pictorially accurate mask. This exercise is a\nperfect outlet for expressionism while allowing students to\nbecome more culturally \"aware\" and informed by seeing a\nculture from a native perspective. In a multicultural society,\nit is important to remember when studying other cultures to\nacknowledge the native perspective as well as other valuable\nperspectives to create a truer vision of the subject under\nconsideration.\nThe African mask-making activity allows students to cre-\nate a piece of living history that has significance--in a sense,\nthey become public historians and, through their artwork,\neducate others about the African cultures represented in the\nmasks. They become ambassadors for the Bamana people of\nMali, the Yoruba people of Nigeria and Benin, the Chockwe\npeople of Angola, the Luba of the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, the Maasai of Kenya and Tanzania, and the\nBembe of Zambia. Studying other cultures can be difficult,\nbut opening up Africa's rich cultural history through an\nexciting mask-making activity brings an element of wonder\nand mystery that is palpable for all the pre-service teachers.\nThese masks are considered supernatural, the pre-service\n6 SAGE Open\nteachers come to learn, and are symbolic pieces used in ritu-\nalized ceremonies and dances where cultural transmission\nand legacies are passed from one generation to the next. Not\nonly is the mask-making activity a lens into another culture,\ncreating these masks also encourages the development of\nspatial reasoning, a skill of \"fundamental importance\" for\nelementary school students, in a fun and exciting medium\nMontgomery and Rule (2011) were pleased with the over-\nall results of the study. They concluded that the pre-service\nteachers became absorbed in the mask-making process and\nlearned a great deal too. For example, Montgomery and Rule\nnoted the pre-service teachers were able to identify the physi-\ncalandculturalgeographyoftheirspecificmask.Furthermore,\nthey were articulate in their demonstrations on how the col-\nors, patterns, and structural shapes of the masks were unique\nto their African people, suggesting \"that the masks were now\nquite significant to them\" (Montgomery & Rule, 2011, p. 71).\nAn interesting finding of the study showed that most of the\npre-service teachers would only attempt this activity with\nupper elementary school students though the first and second\ngraders \"successfully completed their masks and evidenced\nmuch learning; the classroom teachers of these students were\nthrilled with the results of the project\" (Montgomery & Rule,\n2011, p. 74). Exposing this group of pre-service teachers and\nelementary school students to the mechanics of mask-making\nallowed them to be transported to another time and place by\nexploring their historical and creative imaginations. Though\nthe majority of pre-service teachers said they were open to the\npossibility of replicating this exercise in their own class-\nrooms, the very fact they participated in an unorthodox social\nstudies exercise allowed them to experience and weigh the\nusefulness of such creative endeavors for future projects.\nCo-Teaching\nA seminal article in the opportunities and possibilities of co-\nteaching social studies methods education courses titled A\nCatwalk Across the Great Divide: Redesigning the History\nTeaching Methods Course broached an underappreciated\ntopic in scholarly discourse. McDiarmid and Vinten-\nJohansen (2000) teamed together to teach an experimental\ncourse at Michigan State University. They believed combin-\ning talents would produce a more effective social studies\nmethods course illuminating the chasm that separated his-\ntorical theory and practice with educational pedagogy.\nMcDiarmid and Vinten-Johansen began their professional\nassociation uneventfully but over the next few years, they\nconstantly refined their course and the improvement seen in\nstudent projects and reflections was noticeable.\nPrimary Sources\nBuilding on McDiarmid and Vinten-Johansen's (2000) model,\nSandwell (2012) purposed to bridge the \"great divide\" and\nteach a social studies methods course for pre-service teachers.\nHowever, the transition for Sandwell was fraught with hidden\nobstacles and uncertainties. Streamlining the syllabus and the\nprimary instructional method for the course was paramount.\nSandwell (2012) believed that \"one elective course in a\ncrowded teacher education curriculum\" could bring about\nremarkable change (p. 226). A theme threaded throughout her\narticle reflecting on her experiences teaching a social studies\nmethods course for pre-service teachers is the \"relationship\nbetween small practices and big ideas\" (p. 226). The small\npractice that would become the bedrock of her courses was\nanalyzing and extracting meaning from primary source docu-\nments. The textbook, in Sandwell's opinion, was a poor sub-\nstitute and made history antiseptic. Using primary sources\n\"makes possible more and different kinds of learning activi-\nties then are provided by textbooks: it also appeals to `multi-\nple intelligences' theories of effective learning\" (Sandwell,\ndevelop historical thinking skills, such as weighing and eval-\nuating evidence, making judgments, drawing conclusions,\nderiving meaning and significance from all these disparate\nparts, and developing a workable interpretation. This could\nonly be possible by working like a historian.\nA significant discovery for Sandwell (2012) was that\ndescribing history's constituent parts would only go so far in\nachieving content mastery. \"It was only by engaging them in\nthe process that they would learn to think differently and to\nguide student investigations into primary sources, Sandwell\nwould supply them with critical questions to keep in mind\nwhile reading and constructing meaning from the documents.\nAs they began to develop a theory or insight, she would mod-\nify these questions to guide further inquiry. In her experi-\nence, this simple approach to evaluating primary sources and\nextrapolating meaning from them was \"liberating, invigorat-\nThere are imposing challenges, however, that Sandwell\nbelieved disadvantaged pre-service social studies teachers\nbefore they ever stepped foot in their classrooms.\nGiven the structural problems confronting prospective history\nteachers--the dearth of real disciplinary knowledge among\nhistory majors graduating from most universities; the fact that\nmy student need only three university history courses to enter\ninto teacher education as secondary school history specialists;\nthe very short duration of teacher education programs generally,\nand history teacher education in particular; the disdain for\ndisciplinary knowledge, especially in the case of history, in the\npublic school system; and the poor training in history education\nthat too many students continue to receive throughout the\ncountry--in spite of all these factors, I think there are reasons to\ncelebrate the possibility of change at this point in time.\nReflective practitioners know that there are a few tried-\nand-true methods for combating challenges and obstacles\nBerg and Shaw 7\nwithin the classroom and workplace. Specifically, continuing\nprofessional development both individually and corporately\nis an effective method to surmount challenges (Osterman &\nreflective practitioners rely on are forming relationships with\nmore experienced colleagues outside their department and\nforming personal and professional relationships with them.\nOne way this practice can be articulated in school practice is\nthrough co-teaching classes.\nCo-Teaching Revisited\nWhen Enfield and Stasz (2011) decided to co-teach two\nteacher education methodology courses in language arts/\nsocial studies and mathematics/science, they were unpre-\npared for the powerful insights they would glean from the\nexperience. Co-teaching was a foreign concept to both edu-\ncators but they saw an opportunity to teach prospective\nteachers by example the behaviors and attitudes they believed\nreflective teachers should embody. There is a disconnect,\ngenerally speaking, between 21st-century students and their\nteachers (Diaz, Middendorf, Pace, & Shopkow, 2008). In an\neffort to bridge the gap between teacher expectations and\npractices and actual student learning, Enfield and Stasz\n(2011) purposefully created their courses in interdisciplinary\nmethods courses with the expressed intent of meeting the\nneeds of their students.\nTeacher educators ask future teachers to reflect on experiences.\nHowever, teacher educators rarely offer explicit modeling of\neffective reflection; often do not explain how reflection relates\nto professional activity; or fail to make their own reflections\nevident to future teachers. (p. 108)\nAn unexpected illness, however, changed the course of\nthe semester in ways Enfield and Stasz (2011) could not have\npredicted. Unable to meet for their first class meeting, Stasz\njoined the class via SkypeTM and, through active listening,\nobserved Enfield's ability to \"reflect in the moment\" as he\nFrom a distance, Stasz became a \"reflective listener\" and,\nduring a class break, conferred with Enfield about the trajec-\ntory of the class discussions and offered some possible start-\ning points for further discussion (p. 111). Enfield resumed\nclass discussion using Stasz's prompts and the result was a\n\"spirited discussion\" that proceeded much longer than antici-\npated (p. 111). After the first day concluded, Enfield and\nStasz reconvened to analyze and reflect on the unusual hap-\npenings of the methods class. They came to the conclusion\nthat \"critical reflection as a listening endeavor\" was highly\ndesirable and that Stasz's sudden illness contributed to the\ncoincidental discovery of its importance in instructional\npractice but also in reflective practice (p. 112).\nOne of the reflective practices Enfield and Stasz (2011)\ncontinually used with their students were discussion-based\nactivities. These were not ordinary student-led discussions\nconfined to a small block of time per class, but were sub-\nstantial dialogues that involved active participation from\neveryone including Enfield and Stasz. Enfield and Stasz\nmodeled the behavior they wanted their students to emulate\nin their own classrooms and establishing a community of\nlike-minded learners where everyone felt comfortable to\nactively participate led to discussions where ideas were\nfreely exchanged between students and professors alike.\nHaving that kind of educational and professional transpar-\nency inside the classroom over the course of a semester\nundoubtedly made an impression on the pre-service teach-\ners. As the authors noted, reflective practitioners should\nmake it a practice to \"reflect on action and to reflect in\naction\" to understand and model the behaviors they wish\nEnfield and Stasz took a calculated risk when they aban-\ndoned their carefully planned syllabus after the first day of\nschool in favor of a hands-on approach that evolved through-\nout the semester. Looking back on the experience, they con-\ncluded, \"engaging in practices as we described here require\na willingness to take risks, to be fearless, and to make one-\nclusions are what make reflective practice strategies, such as\nco-teaching, such rewarding professional experiences for\nteachers and students alike.\nConclusion\nIn recent years, there has been a resurgence in social studies\nreflective practice literature. Those considered in this article\ninclude textbooks, dialogue journals, culturally responsive\ntexts (CRT), the Persona Doll Project, mask-making, pri-\nmary source documents, and co-teaching. Each reflective\npractice strategy has its merits and could be implemented in\npedagogical practice easily. There is abundant literature on\nthe virtues of reflective practice for teachers, pre-service\nteachers, and students. The ultimate goal of education dove-\ntails with that of reflective practice--to make a positive\nimpact on professional educators and to transfer those influ-\nential attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors on to pre-service\nteachers, who then transmit them to students.\nIn a social studies context, reflective practice is neces-\nsary to bring meaning and value to a subject that is becom-\ning increasingly marginalized in the public school system.\nTraditional teaching methods and curricular tools, such as\nthe textbook, have been shown to be dangerous to social\nstudies and history students in its present form but, as\nsome scholars have suggested, they can still serve a vital\nfunction if they adapt to the needs of 21st-century\nstudents.\nThe reflective practices discussed in this article offer via-\nble alternatives that are exciting and engaging for students\nand teachers making learning dynamic and fun. As Pace\n8 SAGE Open\nIt is clear from both the nature of historical practice and the\nintellectual politics of the discipline that it would be very\nunfortunate to attempt to force a single form of assessment of\nstudent learning on the discipline from the top down. (p. 117)\nThe same disclaimer could warn against compartmental-\nizing the myriad ways in which teachers can teach rather\nthan mandating one method over another. The strategies\nreviewed in this article are an excellent beginning for a\nteacher willing to take a risk and try something innovative.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nCalder, L.
