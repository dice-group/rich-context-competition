    "abstract": "Abstract\nDespite the numerous psychological areas in which optimism has been studied, including career planning, only a small amount\nof research has been done to investigate the relationship between optimism and decision-making styles. Consequently, we\nhave investigated the role of dispositional optimism as a correlate of different decision-making styles, in particular, positive\nfor effective styles and negative for ineffective ones (doubtfulness, procrastination, and delegation). Data were gathered\nthrough questionnaires administered to 803 Italian adolescents in their last 2 years of high schools with different fields of\nstudy, each at the beginning stages of planning for their professional future. A paper questionnaire was completed containing\nmeasures of dispositional optimism and career-related decision styles, during a vocational guidance intervention conducted at\nschool. Data were analyzed using stepwise multiple regression. Results supported the proposed model by showing optimism\nto be a strong correlate of decision-making styles, thereby offering important intervention guidelines aimed at modifying\nunrealistically negative expectations regarding their future and helping students learn adaptive decision-making skills.\n",

Optimists are individuals who expect good things\nto happen to them; conversely, pessimists are those who\nexpect bad things to happen to them (Carver, Scheier, &\nDispositional optimism accompanies a number of adap-\ntive psychological qualities (Segerstrom, 2010). People who\nare more optimistic have less psychological distress, even\nwhen things do not coincide with their expectations (Carver\net al., 2010). These individuals deal with stressors more\nactively and more adaptively, using problem-focused strate-\ngies when likely to be effective (i.e., in controllable situa-\ntions such as academic challenges) and emotion-focused\nstrategies when likely to be effective (i.e., in uncontrollable\nsituations such as trauma; Solberg Nes & Segerstrom, 2006).\nIn prospective studies, people who were more optimistic had\nmore academic and professional success (Segerstrom, 2007;\nSolberg Nes, Evans, & Segerstrom, 2009). Individuals who\nare more optimistic also have more successful social rela-\ntionships (e.g., Srivastava, McGonigal, Richards, Butler, &\nOptimism can therefore be considered a predictor of\nbehavior (Armor & Taylor, 1998), and has been linked to the\nstudy of motivation and self-regulation (e.g., Bandura, 1986,\nmore problem-focused coping strategies and more effective\nways of emotional regulation, both of which contribute to\nbetter functioning (S. E. Taylor & Armor, 1996).\nFurthermore, several studies have targeted events that\nmight be viewed as challenging. At least two studies have\nexamined the role of optimism among students starting their\ncollege experience (Aspinwall & Taylor, 1992; Brissette,\nScheier, & Carver, 2002). Optimism and other variables\nwere assessed upon the students' arrival on campus, and\nmeasures of well-being were obtained at the end of the\nsemester. Higher optimism predicted less distress at the end\nof the semester. Early studies examined student reports of\nsituational coping responses and general coping styles (e.g.,\nScheier, Carver, & Bridges, 2001), finding that optimists\ngenerally appear to be approach copers whereas pessimists\nappear to be avoidant copers. Results dealing with like con-\ncepts have repeatedly followed (Carver et al., 2010).\nThe rationale for relating optimism to decision making is\ndrawn from the idea that positive expectancies guide individ-\nuals to an effective way of making decisions as they feel able\nto implement adequate strategies and to sustain efforts to cope\n1Kore University, Enna, Italy\n2University of Verona, Italy\nCorresponding Author:\nPaola Magnano, Faculty of Human and Social Sciences, Kore University,\nCittadella Universitaria, Plesso di Psicologia, 94100 Enna, Italy.\nEmail: paola.magnano@unikore.it\nDispositional Optimism as a Correlate of\nDecision-Making Styles in Adolescence\nPaola Magnano1, Anna Paolillo2, and Barbara Giacominelli2\n Keywords\ndecision making, optimism, vocational guidance\n2 SAGE Open\nwithadversities(Scheier,Carver,&Bridges,1994).Moreover,\noptimism has not only been found to predict adaptive career\nplanning strategies (Creed, Patton, & Bartrum, 2002); career\noptimistic individuals also appear to strive higher academi-\ncally, report greater comfort with their educational and career-\nrelated plans, and engage in activities that enhance their\ncareer insight (Rottinghaus, Day, & Borgen, 2005).\nOptimism can therefore be associated with coping strate-\ngies, emotional regulation, academic and professional suc-\ncess, making it possible to hypothesize that the\ndecision-making process in vocational guidance--which is\nrelated with all previously mentioned variables, as will be\nhighlighted later in the text--could be affected by optimism.\nIn fact, despite the important relationship between optimism\nand many areas linked with scholastic well-being and suc-\ncess, only a small amount of research has investigated the\nrelationship between optimism and career planning.\nMoreover, recent models in vocational guidance have applied\npositive psychology principles to school education\n(Seligman, Ernst, Gillham, Reivich, & Linkins, 2009) and to\nvocational counseling (Soresi & Nota, 2014), with the aim of\nhelping individuals develop personal resources such as hope,\noptimism, and resilience, which thus enable them to face\nuncertainty and challenges in career planning.\nSo, even though optimism performs a self-regulatory\nfunction in determining whether an individual will initiate or\nmaintain working toward desired goals, a small number of\nstudies have investigated optimism as it pertains to career\n1998). Career development can be considered an adapta-\ntional process, requiring individuals to evaluate their situa-\ntion, consider their personal interests, values, and beliefs\nwhen they make decisions about careers, and subsequently\nmanage this ongoing process. Optimism is referred to as an\nappraisal style within this framework as this predisposition\ncan influence the way an individual thinks, feels, and acts in\na particular situation. An individual, for example, who tends\nto expect that positive outcomes will occur is likely to par-\nticipate in career-related activities, to set vocationally ori-\nented goals, and to respond with positive affect (Patton,\nCreed and colleagues (2002) found that students who\nendorsed higher levels of optimism showed greater career\nplanning and exploration, were more decided about their\ncareer and had more career goals, whereas those with high\nlevels of pessimism reported a lower awareness and knowl-\nedge with regard to career choice, were more indecisive, and\nperformed more poorly academically. In this field, career\ndecision making is strongly involved due to the fact that the\nchoices influence life directions and outcomes. Creed,\nPatton, and Bartrum (2004) pointed out that career issues are\nparticularly salient for adolescent populations where young\npeople need to be informed, skilled, and confident about set-\nting future goals and making career-related decisions. In the\nbroad sense, career maturity refers then to the individual's\nreadiness to make informed, age-appropriate career deci-\nsions and cope with career development tasks (Savickas,\n1989). Definitions include the individual's ability to make\nappropriate career choices, including awareness of what is\nrequired for making informed decisions regarding one's\ncareer and the degree to which one's choices are both realis-\ntic and consistent over time (Levinson, Ohler, Caswell, &\nthat optimism performs a key role in motivating the develop-\nment of career goals and expectations and in encouraging the\nstudent to remain engaged in these activities, despite adversi-\nties that may arise. Having a positive outlook on life appears\nto perform a conducive and regulatory role for males and\nfemales in the career development process. An analysis of\nthis short review, despite the fact that that many career-\nrelated variables have been investigated, reveals that there\nare no studies that directly link optimism with decision-mak-\ning styles in vocational guidance.\nDecision-Making Styles\nThe decision-making style can be defined as the tendency to\ndeal with choices according to personal tendencies.\nIndividuals, responding to specific situations, tend to use a\npersonal style more frequently than others, and thus show a\npredominant style.\nMiller and Byrnes (2001) have defined decision making\nas the process of choosing between different alternatives\nwhile in the midst of pursuing one's goal. Concerning the\nrelationship between personality and decision making, many\nstudies have suggested the existence of different typologies\nof decision-making styles (Brew, Hesketh, & Taylor, 2001;\nFranken & Muris, 2005). Driver, Brousseau, and Hunsaker\n(1990) postulated that individuals have a primary decision-\nmaking style and a secondary style thus providing them with\na range of strategies to choose from, which they can use for\ndifferent decisions (R. Singh & Greenhaus, 2004). In short,\nalthough an individual's approach to a given decisional task\nmay be characterized by one predominant style, elements of\nother styles can be present (Harren, 1979). As Gati, Gadassi,\nand Mashiah-Cohen (2012) have highlighted, there has been\nan increased criticism of the single-most-dominant-trait\napproach to career decision-making styles. Researchers have\nargued that individuals in fact have more than one style\n(Driver et al., 1990) and that they have a range of strategies\nto choose from, which can be used for different decisions (R.\nSingh & Greenhaus, 2004). Indeed, studies have shown that\nthe single-dominant-trait approach only partially accounts\nfor individual differences in decision making (Shiloh, Salton,\nthat referred to career decision-making style as a \"learned\nhabitual response pattern exhibited by an individual when\nconfronted with a decision situation. It is not a personality\ntrait, but a habit-based propensity to react in a certain way in\na specific decision context\" (p. 820); so we are convinced\nMagnano et al. 3\nthat, even though many external (e.g., involvement in deci-\nsion, time necessary for good decision making) and internal\n(motivation, self-esteem, self-determination, perceived\nresources) variables affect the decision-making process,\nwhenever a choice is perceived as important for the future,\nindividuals tend to use an habitual response pattern.\nStarting from some traditional classifications (Arroba,\nwhich have categorized individuals into groups according to\na single dominant decision-making style, Di Nuovo and\nMagnano (2013), using statistical classification techniques,\nfound four decision-making styles:\n1. Doubtfulness, which refers to emotional interference\nsuch as worry and anxiety regarding choices. It refers\nto negative emotionality, uncertainty.\n2. Delegation, which includes the tendency to attribute\nto others (significant or not) the responsibility of\nchoice. It is similar to Harren's (1979) dependent\nstyle and very close to avoidance in Mann et al.'s\n(1997) classification. It is related to an external locus\nof control.\n3. Procrastination, which refers to the tendency to avoid\nor delay beginning or advancing through the career\ndecision-making process.\n4. No problem, which is similar to the rational style\n(Mann et al., 1997); it includes the ability to define\nobjectives, to plan actions, to seek information, and\nto evaluate alternatives carefully.\nThe choice of the authors to adopt this classification, as\nwell as the resulting scale, derives from the necessity to cre-\nate a concise instrument that, along with other scales, is easy\nto apply in vocational guidance interventions in school/aca-\ndemic contexts. Previous research (Di Nuovo, Magnano,\nthe present decision-making classification and the related\nmeasurement instrument in association with measures of\nvocational guidance variables (such as professional interests,\nself-image, decisional self-efficacy, attributional styles),\nshowing to be good predictors of effective career choice.\nAlthough Harren (1979) suggested that the most effective\napproach to decision making is the use of a rational style,\nstudies show conflicting results. As Mau (2000) has pointed\nout, a rational decision-making style has been found to be\nassociated with career maturity (Blustein, 1987), career deci-\nsiveness (Mau, 1995), problem-solving efficacy (Heppner,\nrational decision-making style tends to be inversely related\nto progress in resolving various career tasks (Mau & Jepsen,\nmaking style is generally postulated as an ideal style, some\nresearch (Chartrand, Rose, Elliott, Marmarosh, & Caldwell,\nneither significantly nor necessarily associated with progress\nin career-related tasks.\nAccording to Klaczynski, Byrnes, and Jacobs (2001), the\ndecisions and the processes by which these decisions are\nmade differ according to the level of motivation and self-\ninvolvement for the particular individual (Klaczynski &\nFauth, 1997) and may vary across problem contexts as a\nfunction of personal relevance (Finken & Jacobs, 1996).\nHowever, despite widening interest in these issues, there are\nstill relatively few developmental studies of motivational\nand affective (e.g., mood) influences on decision making.\nIndividual differences in psychosocial and social cognitive\ndispositions, and their relationships to decision-making\nprocesses, have also received sparse attention in develop-\nmental decision-making literature (Moshman, 1999; Perkins,\nCorrelations between relatively stable personality charac-\nteristics, such as impulsivity and sensation seeking, and\naspects of decision making have been demonstrated (see\nByrnes, 1998). Moreover, in a study done by Jin, Watkins,\nand Yuen (2009), it was pointed out that conscientiousness,\nextroversion, and low neuroticism are the prominent person-\nality traits that consistently relate to increased career infor-\nmation seeking and decidedness (Lounsbury, Hutchens, &\nopenness is strongly correlated with high-identity foreclo-\nConversely, Saka and Gati (2007) posited that numerous\nstudies have examined the relations between these various\npersonality and behavioral characteristics on one hand, and\ncareer indecision and indecisiveness on the other (e.g., Kelly\nvariables studied include self-esteem and self-confidence\nlocus of control (K. M. Taylor, 1982), anxiety (Fuqua,\nSeaworth, & Newman, 1987), and personal and vocational\nidentity (C. R. Cohen, Chartrand, & Jowdy, 1995). Finally,\neffective decision making is positively related with general-\nized self-efficacy and with global self-esteem (Betz & Klein,\nTherefore, if we consider that optimism and pessimism\nmay play a functional role in the development of career-\nrelated variables (Creed et al., 2004) and that the decision-\nmaking process is related to numerous psychological\nvariables such as self-esteem, self-efficacy, locus of control,\nand other personality characteristics described above, we can\nthen hypothesize that optimism also plays a role in the effec-\ntiveness of decision making, specifically in the area of career\nplanning.\nGender Differences\nLiterature regarding gender differences in optimism and\ndecision making (career planning) is not definitive. Petrone\n4 SAGE Open\n(2000), testing the construct of career maturity against the\ncriterion measures of vocational identity, optimism for the\nfuture, and level of intelligence, found that females had\nhigher scores on measures of competency for career decision\nmaking than males, whereas males scored higher on mea-\nsures of vocational identity states and possessed a greater\nsense of optimism for the future. Conversely, Loo (2000)\nfound no significant gender differences on decision-making\nstyles.\nMoreover, other recent studies have revealed significant\ngender differences in career decision making; women tend to\ninvest more effort in the decision-making process and to con-\nsult more with others whereas men tend to make quicker\nfinal decisions (Gati et al., 2010); girls tend to invest more\neffort in the process, consult more with others, depend less\non others, and be more inclined to please others. Boys, how-\never, tend to make final decisions faster than girls. Girls also\nhave higher scores than boys in information gathering and\ninternal locus of control, all of which can affect the time\nneeded to make a choice (Ginevra, Nota, Soresi, & Gati,\n2012). Women reported a greater willingness to consult with\nothers about the decision-making process and reported them-\nselves to be slower in making the final decision than did men\nAn analysis of these unclear results derived from the lit-\nerature suggests that gender could play a role in the choice\nand application of a specific decision-making style; for this\nreason, in the present study it will be considered as a control\nvariable.\nAim of the Study\nIn a very recent study, Tolentino et al. (2014) highlighted that\na solid body of research has shown the benefits of optimism\non health-related adjustment (e.g., better quality of life and\nsubjective well-being in Scheier & Carver, 1992; less psy-\nchological distress in Carver et al., 2005; Fitzgerald, Tennen,\non academic adjustment and satisfaction (Aspinwall &\nFurthermore, optimism has not only been found to predict\nadaptive career planning strategies (Creed et al., 2002),\ncareer optimistic individuals have also been reported to\nstrive higher academically, report greater comfort with their\neducational and career-related plans, and engage in activities\nthat enhance their career insight (Rottinghaus et al., 2005).\nOptimists also tend to be confident and persistent in the\nface of diverse life challenges, leading them to differ from\npessimists in the manner in which they cope with stressful\nsituations (Brissette et al., 2002; Solberg Nes & Segerstrom,\n2006), such as the potentially stressful decision of deciding\nupon a career.\nIn addition, the positive effects of dispositional optimism\nhave largely been understood in terms of Carver and Scheier's\nmodel of self-regulation. According to this model, goal-\ndirected behaviors are strongly influenced by people's\nexpectations about what the outcomes of their behaviors will\nbehaviors are affected by the level of confidence regarding\nwhether a particular goal can be reached or not. Doubts\nregarding the attainment of a particular goal may lead an\nindividual to stop pursuing the goal prematurely or prevent\ntheindividualfromtakingactioninthefirstplace.Conversely,\nif one expects to successfully reach a goal, behavior will be\nIn the same way, the career-decision process can be seen\nas an example of goal-directed behavior, in which the indi-\nvidual's level of confidence regarding goal achievement can\ndetermine success or failure. Thus, the career-decision pro-\ncess (and, in particular, the \"preferred\" personal decision\nstyle) can be affected from the internal and generalized ten-\ndency to expect positive or negative outcomes.\nIn light of this, whereas optimists'expectations could pro-\nmote perseverance in the face of challenges, pessimists may\nprocrastinate or give up when confronted with challenges\ndue to their expectation that outcomes will be unfavorable\nIt is perhaps due to their higher level of confidence regard-\ning the future that optimists utilize a number of active coping\nmethods when confronted with challenges (Jackson, Weiss,\n& Lundquist, 2000); in contrast, pessimists have more doubts\nconcerning future events and may therefore rely on strategies\nassociated with avoidance and escape from adversity (Carver\n& Scheier, 2014). Research has demonstrated that optimists\ngenerally depend more on strategies such as modifying con-\ntrollable aspects of stressors (Scheier, Weintraub, & Carver,\nplanning (Scheier et al., 1989), and positive reframing (Park,\nMoore, Turner, & Adler, 1997), aspects which are related to\nadequate and no-problematic decision-making styles (Di\nHence, we hypothesize the following:\nHypothesis 1: Dispositional optimism will be positively\nrelated to effective decision-making styles after control-\nling for gender of participants.\nIn conjunction with this, research has demonstrated that\npessimists tend to employ strategies similar to procrastina-\ntion such as cognitive or behavioral avoidance (Stanton &\nSnider, 1993)--a strategy typically associated with the pro-\ncrastination style--and escape (e.g., Carver, Scheier, &\nWeintraub, 1989), and consequently wind up delegating their\nchoice to others. Several studies have found negative rela-\ntionships between optimism and anxiety (Bagana, Raciu, &\nity (S. E. Taylor & Armor, 1996), which can be considered\ncomponents of the doubtfulness style. In addition, optimism\nis related to the effective management of uncertainty\nMagnano et al. 5\n(Aspinwall, Richter, & Hoffman, 2001), which is an ability\nthat is lacking in the doubtfulness style. Consequently, we\nhypothesize the following:\nHypothesis 2: Dispositional optimism will be negatively\nrelated to doubtfulness, after controlling for gender of\nparticipants.\nHypothesis 3: Dispositional optimism will be negatively\nrelated to procrastination, after controlling for gender of\nparticipants.\nHypothesis 4: Dispositional optimism will be negatively\nrelated to delegation, after controlling for gender of\nparticipants.\nTo sum up, optimists expect to be able to make decisions\nsuccessfully regarding desired states of actions and thus use\npositive decision-making styles. In fact, optimists are less\nlikely to expect to fail in choosing their own careers and are\nthus less likely to use dysfunctional decision-making styles\nto procrastinate decisions or to delegate to others whom they\nperceive as being more competent than themselves.\nMethod\nDesign and Procedure\nThe cross-sectional study presented was born within a voca-\ntional guidance intervention conducted in classroom groups at\nthe end of their high school career, because they were about to\nembark on a decision-making process. The participation of the\nstudents was completely voluntary. Managed through princi-\npals of the schools, parents of admitted participants signed an\ninformed consent form. Tests were administrated collectively\nin classroom groups without the presence of teachers. This\nsurvey was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Commission\nof Kore University and the University of Verona. The research\nprotocol included the two surveys presented in the following\nparagraph; the order of the surveys was counterbalanced.\nMeasures\n1. Life Orientation Test\u00adRevised (LOT-R; Scheier et al.,\nsitional optimism by a 10-item scale, with 4 filler items\nand 6 scale items. LOT-R Total scores are calculated by\nadding the 3 positively worded and 3 negatively worded\nitems (these are reverse coded). Respondents are asked\nto indicate their level of agreement with each of the\nitems on a 4-point scale (from strongly agree to strongly\ndisagree). This gives a possible score range of 6 to 24,\nwith higher scores indicating a higher level of optimism.\nAnolli reports an internal reliability coefficient of .82.\nCronbach's alpha calculation on the sample of the study\nis .86. Sample items include \"In uncertain times, I usu-\nally expect the best,\" \"If something can go wrong for\nme, it will\" (items reverse scored). Scheier and Carver\n(1985) considered optimism to be a unidimensional\nconstruct, putting optimism and pessimism as polar\nopposites, suggesting that an individual can be optimis-\ntic or pessimistic but cannot be both.\nThe choice of this instrument was due to the lack of spe-\ncific tests for the assessment of optimism in the realm of\nvocational guidance adapted to fit the Italian context.\nMoreover LOT-R has been used together with measures of\ncareer maturity, career decision making, career goals and\nwell-being in a study which involved 504 high school stu-\n2. Decision-Making Styles (DMS; Di Nuovo &\ntype scale (1 = totally disagree to 5 = totally agree);\nDMS measures four decision-making styles, three of\nwhich are considered ineffective (doubtfulness, pro-\ncrastination, delegation) and one, namely \"no prob-\nlem\" considered effective. Cronbach's alpha for each\nsubscale has been calculated on the sample of the\nstudy, giving the following values: doubtfulness,  =\nproblem,  = .77. Sample items included, When I\nhave to make a decision or a choice that is important\nfor me . . . \"I feel worried and I try to put off the\nchoice\" (doubtfulness), \"I'm afraid of making mis-\ntakes and ask my parents to decide in my place\" (del-\negation), \"I feel worried and I try to defer the choice\"\n(procrastination), \"I already have clear ideas and I am\nsure what to choose\" (no problem).\nThis instrument was created and validated for the Italian\npopulation to assess decision-making styles in vocational\nguidance. Predictive validity has been tested through the\nmeasurement of the effectiveness of the choices in the transi-\ntion from middle to high school.\nParticipants\nData were collected through convenience sampling.

J. Cohen (1988)\ndefined effect sizes as \"small, d = .2,\" \"medium, d = .5,\" and\n\"large, d = .8\" (p. 25); as it is shown in Table 6, the effect size\nfor the gender differences in delegation style can be consid-\nered as moderated (d = .46), whereas the effect sizes for all\nthe other decision-making styles are small (d < .2).\nDiscussion\nThe aim of the study was to verify if dispositional optimism\nwas positively related to effective decision-making styles\nand negatively related to doubtfulness, procrastination, and\ndelegation, after having controlled for gender. Data analysis\nsupported the hypothesis, showing the following results:\nThere is a positive relationship between optimism and the\neffective decision-making style--referred to as \"no prob-\nlem\"; the three ineffective decision-making styles--doubt-\nfulness, procrastination, and delegation--have a negative\nrelationship with the optimism. About gender differences,\nthere is a significance difference between males and females\nin the delegation style, which shows higher scores in males'\nsubsample. The literature (Aspinwall & Taylor, 1992; Creed\nposits that optimists tend to manage change and uncertainty\nfavorably because they are able to demonstrate flexibility\nwhen appraising and responding to new situations (Tolentino\nmism encourages the student to persevere toward career\ngoals, despite adversities that may arise: \"Having a positive\noutlook on life appears to perform a conducive and regula-\ntory role for males and females in the career development\nprocess\" (p. 205). The results of our study, confirming our\nhypotheses, suggest that optimism could perform a key role\nin decisional situations. As underlined in the literature\nreview, optimistic expectations have been found to promote\npersistence and to facilitate performance on tasks (Armor &\nTaylor, 1998); optimists appear generally to be approach\ncopers (Carver et al., 2010): these can be considered the most\nimportant characteristics of no-problematic decision-making\nstyles (Di Nuovo & Magnano, 2013). On the contrary, lower\nlevels of optimism are associated to avoidance coping strate-\ngies (Carver et al., 2010), which is one of the principal com-\nponents of procrastination style; moreover, the negative\nrelationship between optimism, anxiety, and negative emo-\ntions, highlighted in previous studies (Bagana et al., 2011;\nRingeisen & Buchwald, 2010) could explain the negative\nrelationship between optimism and doubtfulness decision-\nmaking style; then, dependent decision-making style is\nmarked by pessimistic views of the decisional process\n(Brown et al., 2012), as delegation style in our results.\nSurprisingly, there were significant differences in terms\nof gender regarding delegation; similar differences do not\nemerge in the validation study of the DMS (Di Nuovo &\nMagnano, 2013), in which the mean scores of the male's sub-\nsample in this area are not significantly higher than females'.\nOther studies, indeed, have shown women's scores to be\nhigher than men's in terms of effort invested, which can be\nconsidered the opposite of delegation, a decision-making\nstyle we have referred to as the tendency to attribute to others\n(significant or not) the responsibility of choice (Gati et al.,\nlighted that Italian girls also have higher scores than boys in\ninformation gathering and internal locus of control. If we\nconsider that delegation is related with external locus of con-\ntrol, as stated above, the literature seems to confirm our\nresults.\nThe results of our study could make a contribution toward\nan intervention in vocational and educational guidance. As\noptimism is also associated with other important school out-\ncomes, for example, it is negatively correlated to exam anxi-\nety (Bagana et al., 2011) and positively related to social\ncompetence in children (Deptula, Cohen, Phillipsen, & Ey,\nintervention based on Positive Psychology--could represent\nan effective approach to improve important skills. As\npositive mood produces broader attention (Bolte, Goschke, &\nTable 5.

Because most young people\nattend school, schools provide the opportunity to reach them and\nenhance their well-being on a wide scale.\nA positive education reduces hopelessness (Brunwasser &\nwhich can be related with ineffective decision-making\nstyles.\nApplying these principles to vocational guidance, the new\nparadigm of Life Design (Savickas et al., 2009) focuses on\nintervention to increase career adaptability, which includes\nthe tendency to consider life within a time perspective\nanchored in hope and optimism. In a very recent work, Soresi\nand Nota (2014) collected a series of studies and interven-\ntions' proposals, which use the constructs of positive psy-\nchology--including optimism--to develop life skills in\nmany different contexts (school, university, organizations)\nand for different kinds of people (children, adolescent, work-\ners, immigrants, disabled).\nTo conclude, the results of this study could be used by\nschool counselors and advisors in developing programs\naimed at increasing students' optimism as development in\nthis area could improve overall well-being, self-efficacy,\nacademic achievement, and, moreover, effective decision\nmaking; in fact, in most circumstances, optimism appears to\nbe the best strategy, because it allows individuals to acquire\nresources to pursue goals, be persistent, and be open to\nopportunities (if they are realistically available; Forgeard &\nSeligman, 2012). At last, optimistic students are more adapt-\nable given their confident future orientation and focus on\nstrengths amid adversity (Tolentino et al., 2014); optimists'\npositive expectancies enable them to demonstrate flexibility,\na necessary attribute for adaptation when appraising and\nresponding to new and uncertain situations (Aspinwall et al.,\n2001), helping to guide students toward a better career adapt-\nLimitations and Conclusions\nObviously, the study presents some weaknesses. First of all,\nstudy variables were measured from the same source (stu-\ndents) thus creating a single-source bias. It would be more\nbeneficial to control for this effect at the research design\nstage; for example, future research should collect the ratings\nat different times and from separate sources (if this is logisti-\ncally possible).\nA further limitation of the study is the cross-sectional\nmeasurement. It was not possible to test the causal relation-\nships proposed in the theoretical framework. It is important\nto note that there may be a reverse causal relationship to the\none hypothesized in the current study. That is, decision-mak-\ning styles may be an antecedent of optimism rather than its\noutcome (i.e., maladaptive decision-making style creates\nnegative outcomes and develops pessimism). This reasoning\ncan be extended to suggest that optimism and decision-mak-\ning styles could both depend on higher level variables, or that\noptimism may be only one factor among many others that\nrelate to decision-making styles (e.g., cognitive styles, per-\nsonality traits, self-efficacy). It is therefore suggested that\nfuture longitudinal research on optimism and decision-mak-\ning styles, together with other variables, is required to better\nunderstand their relationship.\nMoreover, we cannot consider the sample of our study as\nrepresentative, considering the fact that we used a conve-\nnience sampling.\nDespite the above limitations, ours is one of the first stud-\nies that has empirically tested the relationship between opti-\nmism and decision-making styles; its significant results\nsuggest that further research should be undertaken to repli-\ncate these findings.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAnolli, L.
