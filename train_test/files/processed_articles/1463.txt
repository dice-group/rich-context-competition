Non-\nHispanic black women had lower fitness levels than did non-Hispanic white and Mexican-American women.\nRegardless of gender or race/ethnicity, people who were obese had a significantly lower estimated maximal\noxygen uptake than did nonobese adults. Furthermore, a positive association between fitness level and LTPA\nparticipation was observed for both men and women.

These associations have been demonstrated to\nbe largely independent from other major risk factors (2\u00ad7).\nDespite the accumulating evidence supporting the impor-\ntant health benefits of cardiorespiratory fitness, data on the\npopulation distribution of fitness levels are very limited for\nUS adults. Since the early 1970s, data from the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)\nhave been used to monitor the health status of the nation.\nIn 1999, a cardiorespiratory fitness component was added\nto the NHANES to provide an objective assessment of\nfitness level by using a submaximal treadmill test. The\ndistribution of cardiorespiratory fitness, as indicated by\nestimated maximal oxygen uptake ( _\nmax), for adults\npreviously reported by Duncan et al. (8). The present report\nupdates those estimates with additional NHANES data\nand precise estimates of the _\nmax because data were\ncollected from a greater number of locations and because\nsample sizes were larger. In addition to the mean _\nmax\nfor the population overall, the current report further pro-\nvides detailed percentile estimates by age, gender, and\nselected race/ethnicity subgroups, as well as its association\nwith body mass index and leisure-time physical activity\nwithin the context of the most current physical activity\nguidelines (9).\nSurvey design and study population\nThe NHANES are conducted by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention to monitor the health and nutritional status of the\na stratified multistage probability sample of the civilian non-\ninstitutionalized population of the United States. Mexican\nAmericans, blacks, adolescents 12\u00ad19 years of age, persons\n60 years or older, low income whites, and pregnant women\nwere oversampled to allow for more precise estimates for\nthese groups. The survey consisted of a household interview\nfollowed by a physical examination at a mobile examination\ncenter. A cardiorespiratory fitness test component was in-\ncluded as part of the physical examination for participants\nyears were examined at the mobile examination center.\nAmong them, 2,577 were not eligible for the fitness test\nbecause of one or more of the following reasons: pregnancy\nof more than 12 weeks (n \u00bc 595); physical limitations that\nwould prevent them from using the treadmill (n \u00bc 792);\nhistory of cardiovascular diseases or cardiovascular condi-\nother lung or breathing conditions or symptoms (n \u00bc 515);\nuse of b-blockers, antiarrhythmics, calcium channel\nblockers, nitrates, or digitalis (n \u00bc 231); or other reasons\n(n \u00bc 192). Selected characteristics of eligible and noneli-\ngible participants are shown in Table 1. Results in this report\napply to the US population with a set of characteristics as\ndefined by the eligibility criteria. That is, the population of\ninference is the US civilian noninstitutional population who\nare aged 20\u00ad49 years and who have neither physical limita-\ntions nor history of cardiovascular diseases and related\nsymptoms.\nAmong individuals who were eligible to participate in the\nfitness test, 1,610 did not have their fitness level estimated.\nFor 816 eligible participants, the following reasons ac-\ncounted for the missing fitness data: insufficient time to\nequipment problems (n \u00bc 67), and otherwise unclassifiable\nmax\nwas not estimated because the test was terminated prema-\nturely. The most common reason for premature termination\nwas a heart rate exceeding the predetermined limit (n \u00bc\n417). Other safety concerns arising during the test, such as\ninability of the participant to walk on the treadmill without\nTable 1.

Finally, data from 74 eligible and tested\nparticipants were excluded from analysis because the\nchange in heart rate between the two 3-minute exercise\nstages was less than 8 beats per minute, indicating an\ninsufficient heart rate response to classify fitness level.\nTherefore, 3,250 individuals with an estimated _\nmax\nare included in the analyses.\nNational Center for Health Statistics institutional review\nboard, and written informed consent was obtained from all\nparticipants.\nCardiorespiratory fitness test\nCardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by a submaximal\ntreadmill exercise test. Participants were assigned to 1 of 8\ntreadmill test protocols on the basis of their expected\n_\nmax, which was predicted from gender, age, body mass\nindex, and self-reported level of physical activity by using\nthe formula developed by Jackson et al. (11). Each protocol\nincluded a 2-minute warm-up, two 3-minute exercise stages,\nand a 2-minute cool-down period (10). The goal of each\nprotocol was to elicit a heart rate that was approximately\n80% of the age-predicted maximum (220 \u00c0 age) by the end\nof the second exercise stage.\nThe heart rate was monitored continuously via 4 elec-\ntrodes connected to the trunk and abdomen of the partici-\npant, and it was recorded at the end of warm-up, each\nexercise stage, and each minute of recovery. Blood pressure\nwas measured at the end of each stage by an STBP-780\nautomated sphygmomanometer (Colin Medical Instruments\nCorporation, San Antonio, Texas). At the end of warm-up\nand each exercise stage, participants were asked to rate their\nperceived exertion using a 6- to 20-point Borg scale (12).\n_\nmax (mL/kg/minute) was estimated by extrapolation to\nan expected age-specific maximal heart rate by using mea-\nsured heart rate responses to the two 3-minute exercise stages\n(13). It was assumed that the relation between heart rate\nand oxygen consumption is linear during treadmill exercise\n(14). An estimated _\nmax greater than 75 mL/kg/minute\nwas coded as 75 mL/kg/minute in the analysis (n \u00bc 11).\nCovariates\nSelf-reported information on race and ethnicity was cat-\negorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and\nMexican American. Persons not classified into one of these\ngroups were included in total population estimates but are\nnot presented separately. Participants were asked to recall\nthe type, frequency, duration, and intensity of leisure-time\nphysical activities (LTPAs) that they engaged in for at least\n10 minutes during the 30 days preceding their interview.\nReported frequencies and durations above the 99th percen-\nspectively) were coded to 60 and 300, respectively, for the\nanalysis. A metabolic equivalent (MET; 1 MET \u00bc 3.5 mL of\noxygen uptake per kg per minute) score was assigned to\neach activity to represent a standardized energy cost for\nthe reported activity based on self-reported intensity (15).\nThe MET score of each activity was multiplied by the re-\nported frequency and duration and then summed and di-\nvided by 30 before being multiplied by 7 to obtain the\ntotal MET-minutes per week. For the analysis, participants\nwere grouped into 4 LTPA categories: no LTPA reported,\nMET-minutes/week), or high (!1,000 MET-minutes/week).\nThe cutpoints were chosen on the basis of the 2008 Physical\nActivity Guidelines for Americans recommendations (9).\nMeasured weight and height were used to calculate body\nmass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2). On the basis of their\nbody mass index, participants were classified as normal\nobese (!30 kg/m2) (16). Because of limited sample size\n(n \u00bc 75), underweight participants (body mass index\n<18.5 kg/m2) were excluded from analyses using body\nmass index categories.\nStatistical analysis\nDistribution of estimated _\nmax was examined by gen-\nder, age, and race/ethnicity group, as well as by body mass\nindex and LTPA category. The trends of _\nmax by decades\nof age were tested separately for the total sample and by\nrace/ethnicity groups by using logistic regression with age\nordinal variable. The trends of _\nmax by LTPA levels were\ntested for men and women separately by using logistic re-\ngression. Sample weights were used to account for differen-\ntial probabilities of selection, noncoverage, and\nnonresponse to the examination (17). Standard errors were\ncalculated by the Taylor series linearization method. Statis-\ntical hypotheses were tested univariately at the 0.05 level by\nusing a t statistic. To adjust for multiple comparisons when 3\nrace/ethnicity groups, 3 body mass index categories, or 4\nLTPA groups were compared, we used the Bonferroni\nmethod. All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS\nfor Windows (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and\nSUDAAN (SUDAAN Statistical Software Center, Research\nTriangle Park, North Carolina) software.\nNonresponse assessment\n20\u00ad49 years were eligible for the cardiorespiratory fitness\ncomponent. For the various reasons discussed above, 1,610\n(33%) did not have their _\nmax estimated. Assessment\nwas performed to examine potential nonresponse bias.\nTable 1 describes the characteristics of the eligible partic-\nipants that did and did not have their _\nmax estimated\nalong with a description of examined NHANES partici-\npants aged 20\u00ad49 years who were not eligible for the\ncardiorespiratory fitness component. Compared with those\nwho were eligible and had _\nmax estimated, eligible\nindividuals missing _\nmax had a larger proportion of\nnon-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans and a smaller\nproportion of non-Hispanic whites, and they tended to have\nlower educational and income levels, to have more current\nsmokers, and to be less physically active on average. These\n2 groups had similar gender and age distributions, and they\nhad comparable mean levels of body mass index, blood\npressure measurements, and total cholesterol. To further\nexamine the potential impact of nonresponse, we adjusted\nthe examination weights for gender, age, race/ethnicity,\nand any versus no reported LTPA, using the standard\nweighting-class method (18). For this method, variables\nrelated to nonresponse and variables related to the differ-\nential characteristics of responders and nonresponders\nwere used to form weighting classes. It was then assumed\nthat the data were missing at random within each adjust-\nment cell. Nonresponse correction factors were calculated\nfor each adjustment cell, and the adjustments were applied\nto the original sampling weights. In the analysis, the esti-\nmates of _\nmax using these adjusted weights led to dif-\nferences no more than 0.6 mL/kg/minute or 1.1% (data not\npresented). This indicates that use of the original survey\nweights would result in very little bias. Use of the original\nsampling weights is preferred in order for others to be able\nto replicate results without having to repeat the process to\nobtain a revised set of sampling weights. Therefore, we\npresent all the estimates in this report using the original\nsampling weights.\nRESULTS\nThe age-specific estimates of the mean and median\n_\nmax, as well as the 20th and 80th percentiles for men\n20\u00ad49 years of age, are presented in Table 2.

For men who reported moderate LTPA\nwhile similar to those of men with less LTPA, were signifi-\ncantly lower than those of men with high LTPA. For women,\nthe difference in estimated _\nmax between high and mod-\nerate LTPA groups, however, was not statistically significant.\nDISCUSSION\nDuring the past 2 decades, increasing physical activity to\nimprove cardiorespiratory fitness has been a major focus of\nhealth promotion and disease prevention activities in the\ndescribe the distribution of cardiorespiratory fitness levels\nfor men and women aged 20\u00ad49 years without physical lim-\nitations or indications of cardiovascular disease in a national\nsample of the US population including 3 race/ethnicity pop-\nulation subgroups: non-Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic\nwhites, and Mexican Americans. On the basis of data from\nmL/kg/minute for men and 35.5 mL/kg/minute for women\naged 20\u00ad49 years. Non-Hispanic black women had lower\nfitness levels than did non-Hispanic white and Mexican-\nAmerican women, whereas no significant difference was\nobserved between race/ethnicity groups among men. The\nobserved race/ethnicity differences were more evident\namong people who were overweight or obese compared with\nthat among those with normal weight. Overall, regardless of\ngender or race/ethnicity, individuals who were obese had\nsignificantly lower cardiorespiratory fitness levels than did\nnonobese individuals. Additionally, our results also demon-\nstrated a positive association between level of cardiorespi-\nratory fitness and participation in leisure-time physical\nactivity.\nOur findings on the lower cardiorespiratory fitness level\namong non-Hispanic blacks, particularly women, compared\nwith non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans, are con-\nsistent with previously reported data. The Coronary Artery\nRisk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study\nmill exercise testing and reported that white women had\nhigher exercise performance in both maximal and submax-\nimal cardiorespiratory fitness measures than did black\nwomen (19). The performance was similar in white men\nand black men at the submaximal level but was better in\nwhites for the symptom-limited maximal fitness measure.\nFarrell et al. (20) studied the fitness differences in 1,967\nfemale school district employees among 3 race/ethnicity\ngroups using a submaximal treadmill test. A significantly\nlower level of cardiorespiratory fitness was observed\nin black women compared with whites and Mexican\nAmericans after adjustment for confounders.\nTable 4.

Compared with people who\nwere of normal weight, those who were obese had a 10%,\nmax for non-Hispanic\nwhite, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican-American men,\nrespectively. The corresponding differences in women were\n7%, 12%, and 9%. Cardiorespiratory fitness has been in-\nversely associated with mortality in normal weight, over-\nweight, and obese individuals (7, 21\u00ad24). Results from\nprospective studies showed that improvements in cardio-\nrespiratory fitness were associated with attenuated age-\nup of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young\nAdults Study cohort suggested that a low cardiorespiratory\nfitness level in young adults is associated with the develop-\nment of cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as hyper-\ntension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome in middle age,\nand is modified by obesity status (25).\nWhen interpreting the results in this report, one must take\ninto account the fact that the reference population does not\ninclude the subpopulation represented by individuals who\nwere not eligible for the NHANES fitness test. To ensure the\nsafety and validity of the test, a series of exclusion criteria\nwere used to determine the eligibility. A total of 2,577 par-\nticipants at higher risk of complications from exercise or\nwith conditions that might affect the estimation of _\nmax\ndid not take part in the fitness test. As a result, the population\ntested is younger and characterized by participants who did\nnot have a history of or symptoms of cardiovascular dis-\neases, severe asthma, or self-reported physical conditions\nthat would prevent them from walking on the treadmill or\nwho were not more than 12 weeks pregnant. The exclusion\nrate for the NHANES fitness test increased with age. There-\nfore, if the medical exclusions would lead to a healthier\nand more fit sample, it may be more observable among those\naged 40\u00ad49 years than among the younger groups. For\nexample, compared with the 50th percentile estimates from\nthe Cooper Clinic Longitudinal Study with predominately\nwhite, middle and upper socioeconomic strata participants,\nour median estimates of _\nage are 7%\u00ad8% lower (13). The differences decreased to\nabout 4% for those aged 40\u00ad49 years. The observed diver-\ngence across age groups may be explained, at least in part,\nby the more heterogeneous sample in our data and by the\ndifferential exclusion rates by age.\nA wide variety of submaximal exercise testing protocols\nhave been developed and used in observational and inter-\nvention studies to examine the association of cardiorespira-\ntory fitness and health status (1, 2). Compared with direct\nmeasurement of maximal oxygen uptake or maximal exer-\ncise testing, submaximal tests impose less of a burden on the\nparticipants in terms of time and effort. The validity of the\nNHANES treadmill protocol has been tested on a small\nThe Pearson correlation between the estimated _\nmax\nfrom the NHANES treadmill protocol and the measured\n_\nmax using analysis of expired air through indirect\nIn addition to _\nmax being an excellent indicator of the\noxygen transport and utilization capacity of the cardiorespi-\nratory system and skeletal muscles, it is also a strong in-\ndependent predictor of future cardiovascular diseases, type 2\ndiabetes, and all-cause mortality (2\u00ad7, 27\u00ad29). For example,\na 1-MET increase in _\nmax (3.5 mL/kg/minute) has been\nassociated with a 12% and 17% greater survival for men\n(30) and women (31), respectively. From this perspective,\nour results on an average of 2.5\u00ad3.1 mL/kg/minute differ-\nence in _\nmax between high LTPA and no or low LTPA\ngroups suggest a noteworthy health benefit at a population\nlevel. The relative risk of all-cause mortality associated with\na low level of cardiorespiratory fitness has been ranked\ncomparable with that observed for cigarette smoking (5).\nStudies have demonstrated that improvement in the cardio-\nrespiratory fitness level is associated with reduction in\nmortality rates (32) and can be achieved by participating\nIn January 2005, revised Dietary Guidelines for Americans\nwere released with an emphasis on the importance of regular\nphysical activity (35). In October 2008, the federal govern-\nment issued its first-ever Physical Activity Guidelines for\nAmericans to provide science-based guidance on the types\nand amounts of physical activity for Americans aged 6 years\nor older (9). The target set by the Physical Activity Guide-\nlines Advisory Committee for adults to achieve substantial\nminutes/week, which is the moderate range for LTPA pre-\nsented in Table 5. Although the estimated _\nmax of men\nand women with LTPA meeting the target is not significantly\nhigher than sedentary individuals, we did observe a signifi-\ncant trend for higher fitness across LTPA categories. Self-\nreported LTPA leads to substantial misclassification, and the\nquestionnaire may not be sensitive enough in identifying\nindividuals meeting current Guidelines. This underscores\nthe importance of having objective data on fitness in sur-\nveillance systems and in making public health and clinical\ndecisions.\nTo the authors' knowledge, these data are the only nation-\nally representative estimates of mean and percentiles of fit-\nness level and will provide an important source for\ncomparison in future studies from the United States and\nother countries. This report provides a key reference that\ncan be used to track future population assessments and to\nevaluate the impact of programs. Differences reported here\nin cardiorespiratory fitness among population subgroups and\nby obesity status and participation in leisure-time physical\nactivity can be used to develop health policies, programs,\nand services targeted to the least active and fit in the US\npopulation.\n"
