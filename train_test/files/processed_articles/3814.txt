Semistructured\ninterviews were conducted with 23 Japanese researchers in the natural sciences to identify their research practices and data\nuse, including data sharing. We divided the interview scripts into meaningful phrases as a unit of analysis. Next, we focused\non 406 statements on research data and reanalyzed them based on four aspects: stance on research data, practices and\nperceptions of data use, range of data sharing, and data type. A cluster analysis identified 14 clusters, which were divided\ninto five groups: open access for data, restricted access for data, data interpretation, data processing and preservation, and\ndata infrastructure. Our results reveal the complexity and diversity of the relationship between data and research practices.\nThat is, the practice of research data sharing is heterogeneous, with no \"one size fits all\" between and among researchers.\n",

The increasing level and development of data-\ndriven research has raised an awareness of the importance of\npublic access to data for all stakeholders in scholarly communi-\ncation. Funding agencies in the United States and Europe--such\nas the National Science Foundation, Research Councils UK, and\nthe European Commission--have begun to mandate data man-\nagement plans as part of grant applications. One desired outcome\nof this data management is to increase the number of datasets\nshared among researchers and with the public. Moreover, data\nmanagement plans may eventually evolve into a requirement to\nshare data resulting from taxpayer-funded research.\nThe most successful example of this type of sharing\ninvolves the genetic sequence data deciphered by the\nBermuda Principles in 1996 and the Human Genome Project\nin 2003, which stated that genetic sequence data should be\nreleased without delay, and public access to the data should\nbe guaranteed. Far from becoming the scientific norm, how-\never, the practice of data sharing does not appear to be preva-\nlent in many fields. Although the significance of data sharing\nhas been widely published and discussed, it has also raised\nsome skepticism. In particular, many have expressed doubts\nand concerns about the effectiveness of data sharing, as we\ncan see in expressions such as \"empty archives\" (Nelson,\nNonetheless, data-sharing policies have increasingly been\nimplemented by governments, funding agencies, universi-\nties, and journals worldwide (Jones, 2012; Stodden, Guo, &\nMa, 2013). For example, the National Science Foundation\nmakes data management and sharing plans mandatory for\ngrant applications. Public Library of Science (PLOS) also\nrequires authors to make their data available online upon\npublication. However, it is unclear whether data sharing can\nactually be considered prevalent throughout the scientific\ncommunity. Considering the current, complicated situation\nregarding data and data sharing among researchers, asking\nresearchers how appropriate it is to share data and whether\nthey do so is insufficient. Research activities and data are\nclosely intertwined, and exploring their contexts is a neces-\nsary step toward understanding research data and data shar-\ning in the course of research activities.\nHowever, few studies have focused on the manner by\nwhich researchers conduct and perceive the sharing of\nresearch data during research activities. Discussions on the\n1Keio University, Tokyo, Japan\n2University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan\n3Mie University, Tsu, Japan\nCorresponding Author:\nKeiko Kurata, School of Library and Information Science, Faculty of\nEmail: kei.kurata@keio.jp\nIdentifying the Complex Position of\nResearch Data and Data Sharing Among\nResearchers in Natural Science\nKeiko Kurata1, Mamiko Matsubayashi2, and Shinji Mine3\n Keywords\nresearch data, research practices, data sharing, collaboration, contextuality, data ambiguity, data-sharing perspectives\n2 SAGE Open\nsubject typically concentrate on establishing a stance toward\ndata sharing--either open or not. Therefore, it is necessary to\nexamine researchers' individual situations, practices, and\nperceptions in greater depth and detail.\nLiterature Review\nNumerous studies regarding data sharing among researchers\nhave been published (Fecher, Friesike, & Hebing, 2015), and\ntheir primary focus has been the prevalence of actual data\nfactors that influence the practice (Kim & Stanton, 2016;\nKim & Zhang, 2015). However, there are many definitions\nof research data and data sharing, which makes interpreting\nand comparing the results of previous studies difficult. The\nreason for this confusion seems to be the lack of studies on\nthe fundamental nature of the phenomenon; in other words,\ntoo few studies ask, \"What is the definition of data and data\nsharing?\" The dearth of studies regarding this topic is due to\nthe fact that research data are highly ambiguous and context\ndependent. In the following section, previous studies are\nreviewed, focusing on (a) the ambiguity and (b) the contex-\ntuality of data and data sharing, and then the purpose of this\nstudy is presented.\nAmbiguity in the Definition of Data and Data\nSharing\n\"Data\" is an umbrella term that covers a broad range of\nmeanings and is thus difficult to define (Borgman, 2012,\n2015). Many studies have failed to provide any definition of\ndata or data sharing. The National Research Council's defini-\ntion of data as \"any information that can be stored in digital\nform, including text, numbers, images, video or movies,\naudio, software, algorithms, equations, animations, models,\nsimulations, etc.\" (National Science Board, 2005, p. 8) has\noften been referenced in previous studies. However, we note\nthat this definition only lists examples of possible forms of\ndata.\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, Hilgartner and\nBrandt-Rauf's (1994) \"data stream\" model provided a unique\ndefinition for data, and includes a variety of extremely het-\nerogeneous entities in terms of both the input and output of\nscientific activities. In their model, data are described as \"the\nresult of experiments or surveys, biological materials and\nother samples, software, laboratory techniques, access to\nresearch sites, craft knowledge, and a wide variety of other\nforms of information and know-how\" (Hilgartner & Brandt-\nIn many previous studies, data sharing simply means to\n\"make data available to others\" (Enke et al., 2012; Fischer &\nZigmond, 2010; Pepe, Goodman, Muench, Crosas, &\nErdmann, 2014). This definition is just a paraphrase and is\nnot sufficiently detailed to cover the diversity of data and\ndata-sharing practices. For example, Tenopir includes the\n\"deposition and preservation of data\" as a part of data shar-\ning (Tenopir et al., 2011), whereas Enke focuses on reuse and\nreanalysis by others and describes data sharing as \"the prac-\ntice of making one's data available to others or reusing it\nagain for subsequent analyses\" (Enke et al., 2012, p. 25). We\nnote that the definitions of data sharing in both studies\ninclude \"making data available to others.\" These two defini-\ntions, however, are markedly different from each other;\nindeed, data sharing has a great variety of definitions, and\nthis variety is influenced by several factors. These factors\ninclude the following: (a) the methods involved in making\ndata available to others, which range from \"the attached\ndatasets to published articles\" (Wallis, Rolando, & Borgman,\n2013, p. 2) to making data available to others through \"their\norganization's website\" or \"national network\" (Tenopir et al.,\n2011, p. 9); (b) the targets of data sharing, such as raw data\nor analyzed data; (c) the timing of data sharing; and (d) the\nrange of data sharing, such as whether it is shared among\nmembers of a specific project, among all researchers in a\ngiven field, or among the general public.\nThe proportion of those who share data also varies\ndepending on how questions about data sharing are asked\nand what types of data are actually being shared. For exam-\ndents reported having shared article-related data. By contrast,\nWicherts, Bakker, and Molenaar (2011) reported that only\n42.9% of respondents in psychology sent datasets that they\nused in their journal articles for reanalysis through a personal\ncontact. We cannot identify the reason for these different per-\ncentages because the variety of methods to make data share-\nable is extremely diverse.\nData Contextuality\nData \"exist in a context\" and \"have no value or meaning in\ntextualization occurs during the research process that data\ntakes on its own meaning (Borgman, 2015; Stvilia et al.,\ncontext for research data has long been demonstrated in pre-\nPryor, 2009), and the discussion of data contextuality can be\nsummarized by two types of context. One is \"explicit con-\ntext,\" such as metadata, whereas the other is \"implicit con-\ntext,\" which includes tacit knowledge (Kowalczyk &\nFirst, explicitly describable context typically refers to\nmetadata that have been produced or collected through\nresearch data. Representative examples include the name of\nthe research instrument used, setup methods, properties, ana-\nlytical methods, protocols, work flows, and the subjects of\ndata collection. These metadata must be shared over places,\norganizations, and periods of time.Although researchers have\ndifficulty in selecting which metadata can and should be pro-\nvided (Borgman, 2012), the standardization of metadata for\nKurata et al. 3\ndata sharing has begun to develop. For example, general data\nrepositories, such as Dryad and Figshare, commonly require\nusers to provide information describing the data's title, author,\ndescription, license, and subject keywords.\nSecond, research activities depend on informal knowl-\nedge, which is not easily documented, largely because it is\noften shared as implicit knowledge among various levels of\nresearch communities (Collins, 1983; Latour & Woolgar,\n1986). Whether researchers can interpret the data produced\nby others depends on the availability of these implicit con-\ntexts. Although the simple act of sharing data is often sup-\nposed to be enough to ensure its uptake and impact (Davies\n& Edwards, 2012), researchers have repeatedly expressed\nconcern that a lack of context would prevent them from shar-\ning and reusing data as producers and reusers. Situations\nsuch as these can result in the misuse and misinterpretation\nof the data (Cragin, Palmer, Carlson, & Witt, 2010; Sayogo\n& Pardo, 2013). When making data available to others, a\nresearcher cannot easily communicate the entirety of the\ncontext in which that data was produced, and it is difficult to\ninterpret and reuse others' data without this contextual infor-\nmation. Although the importance of context in data sharing\ncontinues to be discussed, how and what type of implicit\ncontexts are required in research activities is still unclear.\nPurpose of This Study\nAs explained above, the concepts of research data and data\nsharing are ambiguous and context dependent, and research-\ners can take different meanings from data in different con-\ntexts. Research data are inextricable from the research\nprocess in which they are produced and are \"an indispens-\nable element of scientific research\" (Tenopir et al., 2011,\np. 2). To better understand data-sharing practices, we need to\nexamine what researchers consider to be data and how they\nconduct and perceive data sharing during the process of\nresearch activities. We must also recognize the realities of\ndata ambiguity and contextuality. The primary aim of this\nstudy is to examine researchers' perceptions and practices of\ndata use and the manner by which they process, analyze, and\nstore data. We accomplish this aim through interviewing\nresearchers in diverse natural science fields.\nMethod\nThis study employed a combination of qualitative methods\n(i.e., interviews with researchers and content analysis of the\nstatements obtained from the interviewees) and quantitative\nmethods (i.e., cluster analysis on the results of the content\nanalysis). Both approaches were utilized in this study because\neach provides unique insights (Guest, MacQueen, & Namey,\n2012). Content analysis is appropriate for understanding the\nnuances of interviewees' statements, whereas cluster analy-\nsis helps marshal complex practices and perceptions of\nresearch data and presents their overview picture.\nInterviews With Researchers\nUsing snowball sampling, 23 Japanese active senior\nresearchers were selected from various fields of the natural\nsciences, which is a discipline that exemplifies diversity\namong research practices. To be more precise, first we\nrecruited some researchers whom our collaboration project\nmembers knew as interviewees before, and then we asked\nthem to introduce some other interviewees. As a result, the\nmajority of the interviewees were senior professors at rela-\ntively large universities. Profiles of the interviewees are\nshown in Table 1.\nWe conducted semistructured interviews in Japanese,\nlasting 60 to 90 min during which we asked the researchers\nto describe three topics: (a) the purpose and various methods\nof their research practices, especially how they collaborate\nwith other researchers; (b) the relationship between their\nresearch practice and research data, that is, the positioning of\nresearch data within their research and their methods for pro-\ncessing and preserving research data; and (c) whether they\nshare and reuse research data. Each interviewee was asked a\nset of questions customized for their situations to explore\nthese three topics in detail. We did not ask any questions\nabout specified issues on data sharing or open research data\nsuch as the preparation of metadata, data-sharing policies by\nTable 1.

We would like to elicit a diversity of\nopinion or views on research data and the relationship\nbetween their research practice and research data. We\nrecorded and transcribed all the interviews.\nAnalysis Procedure\nWe conducted a content analysis in Japanese on the state-\nments acquired from the interviews. Initially, each author\ncoded the data without any constraints. Specifically, we\ndivided each statement into small segments (some were\nphrases, others were a few sentences in length), and then\nfor each segment, we assigned keywords that described the\ncontent discussed in each statement. We attached 158 key-\nitems with these 158 keywords are heterogeneous, in this\narticle, we analyzed only the 406 statements with keywords\nrelated to \"research data.\" All 406 target statements are\nrelated to the features, interpretations, processing, and pres-\nervation of research data and data sharing. We numbered\nthese 406 statements. In the following descriptions, the\nparenthesized numbers function as unique identifiers that\ncorrespond to the 406 items. In addition, we translated only\nsome statements into English, which were illustrated as\nexamples in this article. On translating the statements into\nEnglish, we paid careful attention not to change their\nnuances of meaning.\nWe examined these 406 statements and uncovered four\naspects that every statement had in common. Then, we\nrecoded the 406 statements using these four \"aspects,\" which\nare (a) stance on research data, (b) practices and perceptions\nof data use, (c) range of data sharing, and (d) data type. One\nreason we employed these aspects is that all four of them\nwere present in every target statement, as we discovered\nthrough the results of the content analysis. The other reason\nis that all these aspects have been referenced in previous\nstudies of research data and data sharing. We display the\noptions within each of the four aspects in Table 2.\nThe first aspect, \"stance on research data,\" has been\naddressed in previous studies of data sharing. We provided\nfour options regarding this aspect from which the researchers\ncould choose: (a) open, (b) restricted, (c) interpretation, and\n(d) N/A. Previous studies typically discussed two stances,\nusually one in favor of data sharing (such as the \"open\"\noption) and one that is against it (such as the \"restricted\"\noption). This article introduces a third option, \"interpreta-\ntion.\" We assigned this option to statements that describe\nresearchers'complicated response to the question, \"What are\ndata?\" We considered these statements to be distinct from a\nsimple dichotomy between \"open\" and \"restricted.\" To pro-\nvide further specificity, we assigned statements in which\nresearchers made no comments about their stance regarding\ndata sharing to \"N/A.\"\nWe configured the practices and perceptions of data use\ninto one aspect because these two factors (elements) were\nindistinct combinations in each statement. We determined\nthe seven options for the second aspect, \"practices and per-\nceptions of data use,\" using a bottom-up analysis. The first\ntwo options, \"my data\" and \"for science and society,\" refer\nto statements that explain why interviewees have a positive\nor negative stance on data sharing. Statements by interview-\nees who believe that their research data should be private\nwere classified into \"my data,\" whereas those made by\ninterviewees who believe that data should be shared more\nbroadly were included in the \"for science and society\"\noption. The third option, \"national or institutional policy,\"\nincludes statements by interviewees who feel that the choice\nof whether to share data is affected by national and institu-\ntional policies. Options 4 and 5--\"preservation\" and \"pro-\ncessing,\" respectively--were assigned to statements in\nwhich interviewees claim to process and preserve research\ndata prior to the actual act of data sharing. These two options\nare of a different type than the previous three because they\nengage with interviewees'actual research practices, whereas\nthe other options describe interviewees' perceptions about\nresearch data. Option 6, \"issues on research data,\" contains\nstatements that address various problems with processing\nresearch data in research practices. The final option, \"spe-\ncific opinion on data,\" refers to statements that describe\nKurata et al. 5\ninterviewees' opinions about the nature of data or the rela-\ntionship between science and research data.\nWe offered three options--\"small-scale collaboration,\"\n\"large-scale research project,\" and \"open to the public\"--for\nthe third aspect, \"range of data sharing.\" The term \"data shar-\ning\" may not typically imply sharing research data in small-\nscale collaboration but instead means making data resources\navailable to the public. In this study, however, we set the\nthree ranges of data sharing to emphasize the interviewees'\nactual behaviors and perceptions of data sharing.\nFinally, we offered five options for the fourth aspect,\n\"data type,\" because researchers handle various types of data\nin their research activities, and this variation affects percep-\ntions about research data. The first five options are \"analyzed\ndata,\" \"material data,\" \"clinical data,\" \"statistical data,\" and\n\"raw data.\" \"N/A\" in the data type means that a statement\neither mentioned nothing about data type or included a men-\ntion of more than one data type.\nUltimately, we assigned four options (one for each aspect)\nfor each item in the statements. For example, we chose\n\"restricted,\" \"my data,\" \"open to the public,\" and \"analyzed\ndata\" for the statement, \"We paid 500,000 yen for the analy-\nsis, so others being able to see that data for free doesn't feel\ntoo great. We won't share the data with others if we don't\nneed to do so\" (28). We chose the option \"restricted\" because\nthe statement said, \"We won't share the data with others.\"\nNext, we considered that the researchers' paying money for\nthe analysis themselves generated the idea that the data are\nmine, leading us to assign the option \"my data\" to the state-\nment. The statement mentioned that allowing other research-\ners with no relationship to this research to use that data for\nfree does not feel too great. Therefore, we chose the option\n\"open to the public\" for the range of data sharing. We chose\nthe analysis.\"\nIn another example, we assigned \"interpretation,\" \"spe-\ncific opinion on data,\" \"open to the public,\" \"N/A\" for the\nstatement, \"Production of data is not a science. It only\nbecomes science after interpretation of the data, expressing\nsome new idea, and then having someone else understand it\"\n(382). This statement does not determine whether research\ndata should be open or restricted; instead, it mentions the\nnature of research data. In other words, research data needs\nto be interpreted by researchers to exist as itself. Therefore,\nwe assigned the option \"interpretation\" to the statement.\nMoreover, the statement \"production of data is not a science\"\nis this interviewee's distinctive opinion, so we assigned the\noption \"specific opinion on data\" to the statement. By con-\ntrast, the statement did not mention the specific ranges or\ntypes of data. Therefore, we assigned the option \"open to the\npublic\" and \"N/A\" to the statement.\nFinally, we conducted the SPSS TwoStep cluster analysis\nusing the dataset obtained through these methods, which\ninvolved examining all 406 statements with each option\nfrom four aspects.\nResults\nWe identified 14 clusters from the SPSS TwoStep cluster\nanalysis for each option from the four aspects to best repre-\nsent the characteristics of each statement. We used the\nTwoStep cluster analysis because it is effective for very large\ndatasets, and it is an exploratory tool designed to reveal natu-\nral clusters within a dataset. The silhouette coefficient (SC)\nvalue shows cluster quality. If its score is between 0.2 and\n0.5, the cluster quality is \"fair\" (cluster quality is \"good\" if\n>0.5, and \"bad\" if <0.2). The SPSS TwoStep cluster analysis\nidentified 14 clusters that best represented the characteristics\nof each of the statements. The value of the SC in the analysis\nwas 0.4, so the quality of our clusters was \"fair.\"\nWe divided these 14 clusters into five groups to obtain a\ncomplete view as a matter of practical convenience. We\nbased the division of groups, labeled \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C,\"\naround the options chosen by the researchers for the \"stance\non research data\" aspect. We found that in the three clusters\nof Group \"A,\" almost 100% of the statements were \"open\"\noptions regarding the \"stance on research data\" aspect. The\nresults of the two clusters of Group \"B\" indicated more than\n90% of statements were assigned the \"restricted\" option, and\n100% of statements in three clusters of Group \"C\" were\nassigned the \"interpretation\" option. We also included\nGroups \"D\" and \"E,\" which have no features regarding the\n\"stance on research data\" aspect, but instead have character-\nistics regarding the \"practices and perceptions of data use\"\naspect. We found that in the three clusters of Group \"D,\"\nmore than 80% of statements were assigned to the \"process-\ning\" or \"preservation\" option. Group E had three clusters\nwith statements that were predominately assigned to the\n\"national or international policy,\" \"specific opinion on data,\"\nor \"issues on research data\" option in the \"practices and per-\nceptions of data use\" aspect.\nTable 3 presents the labels for the 14 clusters as well as\nthe percentages representing the distribution of the state-\nments across the four aspects. The figure noted in parenthe-\nses under the cluster number indicates the number of\nstatements included in each cluster. The following section\ndescribes the characteristics of the 14 clusters with reference\nto the specific statements.\nGroup A: Open Access for Data\nIn the three Group \"A\" clusters (Clusters 1, 2, and 3), almost\n100% of responses were assigned the option \"open\" within\nthe \"stance on research data\" aspect. For Clusters 1, 2, and 3,\nalmost 100% of the statements were assigned the option \"for\nscience and society\" within the \"practices and perceptions of\ndata use\" aspect.\nIn Cluster 1, 93.8% of statements were assigned the\noption \"for science and society\" within the \"practices and\nperceptions of data use\" aspect, and all statements were\nassigned the option \"open to the public\" within the \"range of\nTable 3.

(continued)\n8 SAGE Open\ndata sharing\" aspect. Cluster 1 suggests that research data\nmust be generally open to the public because data sharing\ncan contribute to the advancement of the sciences and the\ngeneral good of society. Specific statements included\n\"General and widely used information . . . [such as] GenBank\ndata . . . that is accessed by everyone should be left open\"\n(325). Cluster 1 is labeled \"Data sharing in public for science\nand society.\"\nAlthough Cluster 2 is similar to Cluster 1 in that the option\n\"for science and society\" was assigned to all statements,\nCluster 2 is unique in that all statements were assigned to the\noption \"raw data\" with regard to the \"data type\" aspect.\nMany of the interviewees' statements provided examples of\nhow they implemented raw data-sharing systems into large\nresearch projects. For example, one statement mentioned\nthat \"with regard to a data-sharing platform . . . we are cur-\nrently in the process of establishing a system using a GIS\nmodified for outer space whereby various users can share\ndata on the basis of its mapping information\" (76). Due to the\nemphasis on raw data among its statements, Cluster 2 is\nlabeled \"A system for sharing raw data.\"\nIn contrast to Clusters 1 and 2, the statements in Cluster 3\ndescribe a more primitive style of small-scale collaborations\nperformed within individual university laboratories. In\nCluster 3, 80% of statements were assigned the option\n\"small-scale collaboration\" with regard to the \"range of data\nsharing\" aspect. Example statements described the practice\nas, \"We brought together in-progress data during analyses,\nand then we discussed the problem or further perspectives of\nresearch\" (1), whereby research data are shared in conven-\ntional collaborative research as a part of an established,\nresults-oriented process. Cluster 3 is labeled \"Data sharing\nwithin small-scale collaboration.\"\nGroup B: Restricted Access for Data\nIn contrast to Group \"A,\" the two clusters in Group \"B\" con-\nsisted of statements from interviewees who are either\nopposed to the idea of data sharing or who insist on some\nrestrictions. Almost 100% of statements in both Clusters 4\nand 5 were assigned the option \"restricted\" within the \"stance\non research data\" aspect.\nStatements in Cluster 4 typically described examples\nand situations in which data could not be shared within\nresearch projects--neither in small-scale collaborations\nnor in large-scale research projects. This is illustrated by\nthe statement \"In collaboration with private companies,\nwe discussed and shared research results based on ana-\nlyzed data, but they are unwilling to share raw data, even\nwith members of the research team\" (112). There were\nmany cases in which collaborative research involved pri-\nvate companies that were reluctant to share data, although\nthis stance varied among cases. We did not find a correla-\ntion between the stance on data sharing and the research\nfield.\nAs with their small-scale counterparts, larger research\nprojects experienced restrictions on data sharing. For exam-\nple, in the A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS) project,\nwhich is one of the seven particle detector experiments con-\nducted at the European Organization for Nuclear Research\n(CERN), only members conducting ATLAS experiments can\naccess raw data from those experiments, and they are not\nable to share other experimental raw data that was obtained\nfrom the other six detectors. Therefore, Cluster 4 is labeled\n\"Restrictions in sharing and use of data.\"\nThe most distinctive trait of Cluster 5 is that 100% of\nstatements were assigned the option \"my data\" regarding\n\"practices and perceptions of data use\" aspect. The typical\nexample in Cluster 5 is the following statement:\nOnly the person who creates data can use the data. For example,\nin a clinical study, the attending physician derives a variety of\ndata from his or her patients, which would not be shown to\nanybody else. So this in turn becomes \"my data.\" (53)\nThis way of thinking, which considers data as belonging\nonly to the researcher who gathered it, also leads to a low-\nered priority for sharing data with others, as well as feelings\nof being at a disadvantage in showing their data to others.\nCluster 5 is labeled \"Unwilling to share data due to my data.\"\nGroup C: Data Interpretation\nGroup \"C,\" which includes Clusters 6, 7, and 8, consists of\nstatements regarding data or data sharing that were not cate-\ngorized as either \"open\" or \"restricted.\" Many of the indi-\nviduals interviewed in this study found it difficult to explicitly\nstate a stance on research data; some interviewees explained\nthe reason for their difficulty in terms of the nature of data,\nthe relationship between data and research practices, and the\nimportance of data interpretation. During the reanalysis of\nstatements from four aspects for cluster analysis, we assigned\nthese statements to the option \"interpretation\" within the\n\"stance on research data\" aspect. All statements in these\nthree clusters were assigned to this \"interpretation\" option,\nmaking this the unique characteristic of Group \"C.\"\nCluster 6 is characterized by statements assigned to the\noption \"specific opinion on data\" within the \"practices and\nperceptions of data use\" aspect. For example, one inter-\nviewee stated his fundamental philosophy toward data and\nresearch as follows: \"Production of data is not a science. It\nonly becomes science after interpretation of the data, express-\ning some new idea, and then having someone else under-\nstand it\" (382). This statement recognizes that data are not\ninherently valuable; rather, the value of the research is\nimparted to and derived from the process of data interpreta-\ntion. Cluster 6 is labeled \"Specific opinion on data.\"\nCluster 7 includes statements that indicate a level of self-\nconfidence in interpreting and making value judgments\nabout data. For example, one interviewee stated that\nKurata et al. 9\nresearchers looking at graphs and charts would generally\nyield a similar interpretation of the data: \"This is probably a\nvery specialized example . . . and is an easy-to-understand\nevent\" (297). In this case, the subject suggested that although\nthe authors did not understand the graph generated by some-\none else that the interviewee showed us during the interview,\nthe interviewee would be able to explain the meaning of the\ngraphical data at a glance. Another statement expressed sus-\npicion toward data represented in academic articles in which\n\"sometimes, data might appear too clean; we view them with\na skeptical eye\" (278). In other words, these interviewees\nhave expertise that enables them to judge data produced by\nother researchers. Cluster 7 is labeled \"Standard for data\ninterpretation and judgment.\"\nCluster 8, which may appear to be juxtaposed with Cluster\n7, consists of statements in which interviewees were unable\nto interpret research data that were not obtained from their\nown experiments. One statement categorized in Cluster 8\nmentioned, \"Experimental data are not sufficient for analyz-\ning, just as data is. What method did they use, or which pro-\ncedure did they conduct? Metadata are essential to properly\nanalyze or understand\" (181). Statements in this cluster\nstress a need for contextuality or background information to\nproperly analyze data. Furthermore, some statements in this\ncluster suggested that an analysis can only be carried out by\nthe researchers who participated in a given experiment; for\nexample, \"Ultimately, data have to be analyzed by people\nwho conduct the experiments that generate them or who have\nthe same level of expertise as the original researchers\" (203).\nCluster 8 is labeled \"Sole data cannot be interpreted.\"\nGroup D: Data Processing and Preservation\nClusters 9, 10, and 11 are included in Group \"D,\" and each\ncluster contains statements that describe the practices by\nwhich data are processed and preserved. Although data pres-\nervation is not synonymous with data sharing, data sharing\ncannot occur without data preservation; therefore, data pres-\nervation is understood to be a necessary precursor to data\nsharing.\nIn Cluster 9, 100% of the statements were assigned the\noption \"processing\" within the \"practices and perceptions of\ndata use\" aspect. Interviewees'\"stance on research data\" was\nsplit between the \"open\" and \"restricted\" option, and in the\n\"data type\" aspect, both the \"raw data\" and \"analyzed data\"\noptions were included. Many statements referred to instances\nin which the practice of data processing was employed to\npromote sharing, such as the development of software that\ncould be used to standardize data for international-sharing\nprotocols and convert it into widely used formats. A progres-\nsive opinion on data sharing is as follows: \"It's not sharing in\nthe physical sense as it was in the past. Instead of sending\nanalyzed data, you could get answers whenever you make\ninquiries into the system\" (159). In the system described in\nthis statement, the data itself was retained by each researcher\n(or group), but researchers could obtain responses to inqui-\nries for specific information. This process is a sophisticated\nmode of sharing in which the data itself is not distributed;\ninstead, it is only the \"information\" obtained from the data\nthat can be shared. Cluster 9 is labeled \"Practices of data\nprocessing.\"\nCluster 10 comprises statements about the processing and\npreservation of previously analyzed data. Many statements\nindicated an abundance of standardized software or tools for\ndata analysis: \"We're developing software that would allow\nthe computer to analyze results from mass spectrometry\nanalyses\" (262) and \"they've begun providing Linux-\ncompatible versions of legitimate analysis software\" (268).\nAlthough these statements are not directly discussing data\nsharing, the standardization of analysis methods enables the\ncomparison of results derived using those methods, which\nthus may be read as an indication of the necessity of data\nsharing. Conversely, some statements in Cluster 10 indicated\nthat the utility of other researchers' data would be limited,\nbecause \"there probably wouldn't be what we could refer to\nas commonality, or universality [in the data]\" (386).\nFurthermore, a number of interviewees suggested that ana-\nlyzed data do not necessarily need to be preserved for long\nperiods of time: \"Increased computer performance would\nlikely allow calculations to be performed in a split-second,\nso there is little point in the storage of analyzed research\ndata\" (347). Cluster 10 is labeled \"Processing and preserva-\ntion of analyzed data.\"\nIn Cluster 11, 100% of the statements were assigned to the\noption \"raw data\" within the \"data type\" aspect. For the\naspect \"practices and perceptions of data use,\" approxi-\nmately 60% of the statements were assigned to the option\n\"preservation,\" many of which refer to small-scale collabo-\nrations; approximately 25% were assigned to the option\n\"processing\" of massive amounts of data in large-scale\nresearch projects. Examples included statements about data\npreservation in university laboratories (small-scale collabo-\nrations), such as \"The graduate students would report once\nevery two weeks. We would have them create a summary and\nconstantly include raw data in them. . . . The summaries were\nthen all stored on a shared computer in the lab\" (356). As\npreviously mentioned, raw data, especially in massive\namounts, cannot be analyzed by researchers in their natural\nform. The statements in this cluster thus provide specific\nexamples of automatic processing and observations on how\nmassive the data being processed can become. For example,\n\"a few gigabytes of data were generated only by a one-time\nmeasurement\" (158) and \"trigger system selects promising\nevents to store its data for further analysis\" (169). Cluster 11\nis labeled \"Processing and preservation of raw data.\"\nGroup E: Data Infrastructure\nGroup \"E\" is similar to Group \"C\" in that both incorporate\nstatements in which the stance of data was not categorized as\neither \"open\" or \"restricted.\" However, the three clusters\nthat address the issue or factor supporting research data man-\nagement and the proceeding data sharing. These clusters usu-\nally address behind-the-scenes roles or issues; meanwhile,\nGroup \"E\" is referred to \"Data infrastructure.\"\nCluster 12 was characterized by 100% of statements being\nassigned to the option \"national or institutional policy\"\nwithin the \"practices and perceptions of data use\" aspect.\nAlthough statements in Cluster 12 varied at the international,\nnational, and institutional levels, they tended to highlight\nexamples of the ways that policies promote open access to\ndata as well as the problems caused by delays in establishing\nrelated regulations and how current laws can act as obstacles\nin efforts toward open access. One positive perspective on\nthe relationship between policy and data sharing can be\nfound in the statement, \"in Finland, the national database\nwas constructed to follow the prescriptions of every single\ncitizen\" (54). A negative example is, \"In Japanese legisla-\ntion, we cannot create a National Death Index (a database on\ncauses of death)\" (243). Because it includes statements that\nrefer to the influence of policies on data sharing, Cluster 12\nis labeled \"Policy effects.\"\nIn Cluster 13, half of the statements expressed the\n\"restricted\" option in the \"stance on research data\" aspect,\nwhereas the other half did not express any stance (these\nstatements were assigned the option \"N/A\" in \"stance on\nresearch data\" aspect). Although all options regarding the\n\"practices and perceptions of data use\" aspect were assigned,\nmany statements in this cluster referred to issues regarding\ndata management and organization. The statements about\ndata organization expressed that \"it seems more convenient\nto have a unified data format with regards to standardization,\nbut it's rare to have such rules established\" (402) and alterna-\ntively that \"data should be provided in an open format\nbecause data can be freely analyzed\" (376). This statement\n(376) argued that the free format was indispensable. In other\nwords, the researcher behind this statement is suspicious of\nthe idea of formatting data for its own sake in case the origi-\nnal results are based on freewheeling thinking.\nAlthough these two statements represent opposing sides\nof an argument, both indicate the importance of considering\ndata formats when organizing data. Another statement,\nassigned to the option \"specific opinion on data\" within the\n\"practices and perceptions of data use\" aspect, highlighted\nthe manner by which the construction of databases contrib-\nutes to the improvement of the discipline of science. For\nexample, one interviewee mentioned that \"[for science], only\nunderstanding the data is insufficient; to overcome is essen-\ntial. Data must be essentially organized [for science] to\nimprove\" (374). Cluster 13 is labeled \"Data management and\norganization.\"\nIn Cluster 14, there are no characteristic tendencies on\n\"stance on research data\" aspect. Of the statements, 100%\nwere assigned to the option \"issues on research data\" within\nthe \"practices and perceptions of data use\" aspect. Many\nstatements in this cluster addressed standardization, a stan-\ndard data archive, and standard software across different dis-\nciplines. Some statements expressed the belief that data\nsharing has become widespread, pointing to the construction\nof data collection, such as Text REtrieval Conference\n(TREC), which serves as a benchmark for information\nretrieval experiments, or GenBank, which has become a fun-\ndamental data archive that almost all researchers in genetic\nresearch fields use to promote their research. Other inter-\nviewees presented opposing perspectives in comments such\nas, \"Even NASA has not provided observational data in the\nstandard way that would allow all researchers can use conve-\nniently\" (93). These contradictory statements expose the dif-\nficulty in providing a standard way to access research data.\nEach researcher has his or her individual research purpose,\nstyle, and methods for using data.\nCertain statements in Cluster 14 highlight the logistical\nobstacles to comparing shared research data, such as the fol-\nlowing: \"It's essentially just photographing what naturally\noccurs, so it's easy to make comparisons. But if we have to\nactively intervene to measure humans' reaction, then the\nresults differ greatly depending on how the intervention is\nmade, so making comparisons through commonality becomes\nmuch more difficult\" (135). The comparability of data is par-\ntially determined by the nature of the data itself and by the\nprocess through which the data are generated. Therefore,\nstandardization is necessary for the comparison of data.\nWhether experimental tools and environments can be stan-\ndardized depends on the research methods and object of the\nexperiment (see \"nature\" and \"human reaction\" in Statement\n135). This example highlights the difficulty involved in com-\nparing research data and includes determining data contextu-\nalityinabroadersense.Cluster14islabeled\"Standardization.\"\nDiscussion\nThis study focused on the position of data in research prac-\ntices and the meaning of data use and data sharing for\nresearchers. To understand the complex and diverse relation-\nship between research data and actual research practices, we\nadopted the approach of combining qualitative and quantita-\ntive analyses of the data obtained from interviews of 23 natu-\nral science researchers. In the first step, we analyzed\nresearchers' statements on research data from the bottom up\n(detailed content analysis). Many elements and combina-\ntions were extracted from more than 400 statements; thus,\nwe recoded statements based on four aspects and then con-\nducted a cluster analysis for the recoded data. We obtained\n14 clusters automatically using this cluster analysis method.\nWe based the labels and characteristic descriptions of these\nclusters on our interpretation of the statements included in\neach cluster. Our results revealed a representative, integrated\nset of categories of diverse researchers'practices and percep-\ntions with regard to data.\nFinally, we divided the 14 clusters into five groups based on\nthe characteristics of each of the 14 clusters. Thus, we had five\nperspectives that provided an overview of the relationship\nbetween research data and research practices. Figure 1 shows\nthe relationship among these five perspectives, which consti-\ntute three layers centering over \"research data.\" The first layer\nis formed (framed) by three stances on data: \"Open access for\ndata (A),\" \"Restricted access for data (B),\" and \"Data interpre-\ntation (C).\" This layer indicates a more surface perception of\nresearchers regarding data. The second layer is \"Data process-\ning and preservation (D),\" which is considered to embody\nactual research practices supporting the perception of data\nsharing. The third layer provides background for the awareness\nof data sharing and research practices. In other words, this layer\nfunctions or interferes with data sharing or data use openly.\nPrevious studies of data use and sharing have generally\nfocused on the simple dichotomy between \"open\" and\n\"restricted\" stances regarding these issues. As described in\nthe \"Results\" section, many researchers in our study\nexpressed a feeling of strangeness or difficulty with this\ndichotomy. Many statements, as typified in the perspective\n\"Data interpretation (C),\" emphasized the interpretation of\nresearch data in a different context.\nIn addition, a number of previous studies focused on factors\nthat promote data sharing (Fecher et al., 2015; Kim & Stanton,\n2016). Some of the 14 clusters found in our studies are consis-\ntent with factors in previous studies. \"Policy effects,\" \"Data\nmanagement and organization,\" \"Standardization\" in perspec-\ntive, \"Data infrastructure (E)\" and \"Data sharing in public for\nscience and society\" are common. However, a complicated\nawareness of data use or data sharing and actual practices\nregarding data processes or interpretation can be identified as\nour independent contribution. For example, \"Unwilling to\nshare data due to my data (Cluster 5)\" expressed the research-\ners' opinion or feeling that data belong to the researchers who\ncollected or produced them in their investigation. This aware-\nness is not necessarily the same as the intention to avoid cost\nand efforts. It may be related to the contextuality of data in\ncomplex research processes, which we will examine below.\nBorgman (2015) is one of a handful of researchers who\naddresses the complexities of data collection and data han-\ndling. She illustrated that the characteristics of data differ by\nresearch purpose or methods. Based on her point of view, we\nanalyzed the relationship between position of data and\nresearch practice. In Figure 1 obtained from our analysis, the\n\"Data processing and preservation (D)\" perspective can be\nFigure 1. Concept image of the relationship among researchers' perceptions and practices regarding research data.\npositioned as the second layer, which serves to connect the\nresearchers' stance on data and data sharing (the first layer)\nwith the data infrastructure (the third layer). However, we\ndid not clarify the mechanism by which a specific research\nmethod or data type inevitably promotes data sharing. In spe-\ncific research fields, such as genetic research, many research-\ners consider it to be the scientific community's norm to make\ngenetic data open in GenBank. In contrast, there are cases in\nwhich researchers never provide genetic data even to research\ncollaborators.\nTo clarify the relationship between researchers' stance on\ndata use and data sharing and research practices, the concept\nof data contextuality is an important point. We examine this\nconcept from two levels, explicit and implicit, which were\nmentioned briefly in the \"Literature Review\" section.\nAt a specific level, a significant number of statements\nmentioned the importance of the format and standardization\nof research data for data sharing, although researchers did\nnot use the term \"metadata.\" Some statements, however,\nexpressed the researchers'fears or doubts about the effects of\nstandardization. Regarding implicit data contextually, sev-\neral statements referenced the belief that data cannot be fully\nanalyzed or understood except by the researchers who con-\nducted the experiments or investigation in which the data\nwere obtained. These arguments may provide insight into the\n\"my data\" mentioned above. Although the perception of \"my\ndata\" has been criticized by proponents of data sharing as\nbeing egotistic, it also reflects a fundamental suspicion about\na researcher's ability to analyze data from other researchers.\nThe doubt or fear that arises from using data in isolation from\nthe context of the research that created it seems to be an\nimportant point when promoting data sharing.\nFinally, we indicated that the scholarly information in\nresearch frontiers is not a \"public good\" but rather a \"club\ngood\" or a \"contribution good\" (Kealey & Ricketts, 2014) in\nan economic sense. Generally, information provided by gov-\nernments is considered a public good because any use (con-\nsumption) by individuals does not reduce the amount of\ninformation and does not exclude any other use. Although\nscholarly knowledge has also been regarded as a \"common\"\nresource, sometimes only researchers are able to truly under-\nstand it, allowing them to taking advantage and contributing\nto its accumulation. Current movements promoting open\nresearch data are considered to be disrupting the exclusive\ncharacteristics that research naturally has.\nFrom any standpoint--the definition of data, the contex-\ntuality of data, and the exclusive property of research--the\nattempt to promote data sharing will force the research com-\nmunity to remodel or reconstruct the conventional system or\nnorms of research practice and researchers' perception.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:: This\narticle was prepared with support from JSPS KAKENHI grant\nReferences\nBirnholtz, J.
