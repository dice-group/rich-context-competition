Further, despite knowledge that minority youth experience\ndisproportionate contact with the justice system, it is unknown how legal socialization\ndiffers by racial group. This study investigates how attitudes towards the justice system\ndevelop as youth transition into adulthood, examines how personal experiences with\nthe justice system affect legal socialization, and determines whether developmental\nprocesses differ for Black, White, and Latino youth.\nMethods Data were obtained from a 7-year longitudinal study of male offenders (N=\n1114). Individual growth curve models were used to examine attitude formation from\nadolescence into adulthood. Time-varying effects models were used to examine how\nexperiences with the justice system affect legal socialization.\nResults Findings indicate that Black youth hold the most negative views of the system\nduring adolescence, followed by Latino youth, and White youth. These racial differ-\nences become more pronounced as youth transition into adulthood. Further, although\nlegitimacy and legal cynicism follow similar developmental trajectories, personal\ncontacts with the justice system only affect legitimacy.\nConclusions Legal socialization from adolescence into young adulthood varies by race.\nThe mechanisms that affect Black youth's attitudes do not affect Latino youths'\nattitudes, indicating that aggregating racial groups may mask meaningful differences.\nDespite engaging in the same amount of offending as White and Latino youth, Black\nyouth are disproportionately contacted by the system.

Race and procedural justice . Legal socialization . Transition to adulthood\nAttitudes towards the justice system are directly related to both crime commission and\nthat personal experiences with justice system actors directly contribute to one's attitudes\nthe late adolescent years, only a handful of such legal socialization studies have focused\narrested at far greater rates than White youth and are consistently overrepresented in the\njustice system [40, 41, 52], even fewer legal socialization studies have examined\nwhether legal socialization differs by racial groups [see 4, 37, 44, 66]. Considering\nthat juveniles often come into repeated contact with justice system officials, juvenile\noffenders' attitudes towards the justice system may change considerably during ado-\nlescence and the transition to adulthood. Understanding whether such attitudes remain\nstable or undergo significant changes through this transition is highly important\nbecause attitudes that are developed during adolescence not only affect their immediate\nbehavior, but likely influence their behavior into adulthood [35, 60].\nRace and Legal Socialization\nLegal socialization is how attitudes towards the justice system develop, involving both\nfeelings of legitimacy and cynicism [7, 11, 39, 58]. Specifically, individuals who view the\njustice system and its authorities as more legitimate report greater confidence in the law\nand express a sense of obligation to defer voluntarily to its rules, decisions, and directives\n[39, 54, 60]. Importantly, in general, these individuals more easily accept the decisions of\nlegal officials. The legal socialization process also involves the development legal\ncynicism. Legal cynicism is a frame through which individuals interpret the viability of\nthe law and its agents [46, 51]. Legal cynicism thus refers to the degree to which\nindividuals feel that the law does not apply to them or the degree to which an individual\nfeels violating the law can be reasonable [11, 25, 46]. Legitimacy and legal cynicism have\nbeen the focal attitudes in legal socialization research because decades of empirical\nresearch suggest that those who perceive the justice system to be more legitimate or\nharbor less cynicism towards the law are more likely to cooperate with authorities, comply\nAs detailed by Fagan and Tyler [11], legal socialization is the product of accumu-\nlated interactions with legal authorities. In this framework, personal experiences with\njustice system actors play an especially important role in shaping a person's views\nabout the system [34, 60]. For example, the way a police officer interacts with a youth\naffects how the youth views the justice system. If the youth feels as though he was\ntreated unfairly, he is likely to view the system more negatively. Importantly, compared\nwith White youth, minority youth are more likely to come into contact with justice\nsystem officials and describe the procedures used by legal authorities as more unfair [3,\ntowards the police than White youth [23, 33]. These experiences likely lead minority\nyouth to feel bias and injustice towards the justice system [50].\nA. Fine and E. Cauffman\nHowever, as there has been limited research about race/ethnicity and offending over\nthe life course [see 36], few studies have taken race/ethnicity into consideration when\nstudying how youth perceive the justice system. In fact, the majority of legal sociali-\nzation studies tend to compare White versus \"non-White\" rather than analyze White,\nBlack, and Latino youth separately [4, 18, 44], largely because of limited sample sizes\n[64]. Though racial minority groups have historically viewed the justice system as less\nlegitimate than White youth, there is likely a \"racial hierarchy\" stratified by White,\nLatino, and Black youth [65]. Latinos tend to face more intense criminalization and\npolicing than Whites, but less criminalization than Blacks see [18]. However, studies do\nnot consistently find that Latino youth perceive the justice system more positively than\nBlack youth [see a review by 33]. Considering Latinos constitute a large and rapidly\nincreasing proportion of the US population, such research is clearly necessary [64].\nIn addition, the majority of these studies have been cross-sectional or have compared\nyouth at different ages. Negative effects of unfair treatment by legal authorities on legal\nsocialization are expected to become more pronounced as experiences accumulate over\ntime [60], yet existing research using cross-sectional methodology has not been able to\ninvestigate this directly. As such, the goal of this study will be to address this issue by\nfollowing youth longitudinally. Indeed, considering that minority youth are more likely\nto come into contact with justice system officials, even after accounting for differences\nin self-reported delinquency [see 52, 60], it is likely that minority youth would report\nless legitimacy and more cynicism particularly at older ages once they have more\nexperiences with justice system officials. As a result, though it is likely that the legal\nsocialization process during adolescence differs by racial group, the results of cross-\nsectional studies are mixed and it is unknown whether any differences become more\npronounced as youth transition to adulthood.\nThe few studies that examine justice system attitudes through adolescence are\nworthy of review. Fagan and Tyler [11] examined legitimacy and legal cynicism ratings\nin community youth ages 10 to 16. The results of their study indicated that older youth\nreport both less legitimacy and more cynicism than younger youth. The researchers\nconcluded that legitimacy likely decreases and cynicism likely increases through\nadolescence, yet such developmental conclusions were limited by their cross-\nsectional design. More recently, Nivette et al. [32] conducted a longitudinal analysis\nof legal cynicism among a sample of community youth in Switzerland. These re-\nsearchers found that cynicism was relatively stable between ages 13 and 15, and that\nself-reported delinquency was the strongest predictor of legal cynicism. The researchers\nconcluded that ongoing social interactions and experiences during adolescence likely\naffect legal socialization. However, because they only followed their participants for\n2 years until age 15, it is unknown whether the findings generalize to late adolescence\nand young adulthood. Further, similar to Fagan and Tyler [11], analyses were not\nconducted by race/ethnicity, nor did the researcher sample adolescent offenders. If legal\nsocialization is the product of accumulated interactions with legal authorities [11, 60],\nand if the negative effects of unfair treatment by legal authorities on legal socialization\nbecome pronounced as experiences accumulate over time [60], the legal socialization of\nadolescent offenders would likely be different than the legal socialization of community\nyouth.\nTwo studies have examined legal socialization among adolescent offenders. Both\nstudies by Piquero and colleagues used the Pathways to Desistance dataset. Youth in\nRace and Justice System Attitude Formation\nthis study were serious adolescent offenders, ages 14 to 18 at baseline. In the first study,\nPiquero et al. [39] examined the development of legitimacy and legal cynicism over the\ncourse of 18 months. Using group-based trajectory analyses, they modeled changes in\nlegitimacy and cynicism over time using the assessment wave number as their time\nvariable. Their analyses suggested that there were four group trajectories for cynicism\nand five group trajectories for legitimacy. For both attitudes, the groups were primarily\ndifferentiated by baseline differences, and such differences remained relatively stable\nover the 18-month period. At the same time, they found strong age effects, such that\nolder youths were more likely to view the law as less legitimate. However, because the\nauthors modeled time using assessment wave rather than participant age, they were\nunable to test whether the older youths in this study had always viewed the law as less\nlegitimate, or if such attitudes worsened over time.\nMore recently, Piquero and colleagues [37] used the same dataset to examine the\nstability of legal socialization of first-generation immigrants, second-generation immi-\ngrants, and native US-born youth over the course of 3 years. Again, modeling time\nusing assessment wave, these researchers found that legal socialization does change\nover a 3-year period. However, because the researchers analyzed their data by wave\nrather than by age, it is unknown whether attitudes are formed in early adolescence or if\nthey continue to develop through the developmental period. Further, because they only\ntracked youth for 3 years, they were unable to measure whether legal socialization\nremains stable though late adolescence and into early adulthood.\nTogether, these studies set an important foundation for examining the legal social-\nization of adolescent offenders. The present study advances our understanding of legal\nsocialization of justice system legitimacy and legal cynicism in several ways. To our\nknowledge, this is the first study to analyze two aspects of legal socialization among\nyouth offenders as they transition through adolescence and into young adulthood. Few\nprior studies have examined legal socialization among adolescent offenders, and to our\nknowledge, none have followed youth through early adulthood. One would expect that\nlegal socialization would change considerably during this time period, reflecting\nongoing personal interactions with the justice system. Accordingly, we examine how\npersonal experiences with the justice system affect developmental legal socialization.\nConsidering the salience yet limited understanding of how race/ethnicity may affect the\ndevelopment of legal attitudes, we track the legal socialization of White, Black, and\nLatino youth offenders from adolescence through early adulthood.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were male adolescents enrolled in the Pathways to Desistance study, a\nprospective study of serious juvenile offenders in Phoenix (n=527) and Philadelphia\n(n=589) (see [47], for complete details of study methodology). Adolescents were\neligible for study participation if they were between the ages of 14 and 17 and had\nbeen charged with a felony or similarly serious non-felony offense (e.g., misdemeanor\nweapons offense). Because a large proportion of offenses committed by adolescents are\ndrug offenses, the proportion of males whose enrollment offense was a drug offense\nA. Fine and E. Cauffman\nwas capped at 15 % of the sample at each of the sites. All youths whose cases were\nbeing considered for trial in the adult system and had been arraigned were eligible for\nenrollment. Of eligible youths, 67 % of those whom we located and invited to\nparticipate in the research agreed to enroll in the study (N=1354). Compared with\nyouths who declined to participate, enrolled participants had more prior arrests leading\nto formal charges (2.1 vs. 1.5 for nonparticipants), were somewhat younger at first\narrest (13.9 vs. 14.2 years for nonparticipants), and were somewhat more likely to be\nnon-Latino White (25 vs. 20 % for nonparticipants). Although statistically significant,\nthese differences are modest in magnitude.\nThe baseline interview was conducted an average of 36.9 days (SD=20.6) after\nparticipants' adjudication in the juvenile system, or, if participants were eligible for\nprosecution as an adult, their decertification (i.e., waiver) hearing in Philadelphia,\nor their adult arraignment in Phoenix. At the time of the baseline interview, this\ngroup of participants was, on average, 16.5 years of age (SD=1.11) and predom-\ninantly of lower socioeconomic status. Less than 4.4 % of the participants' parents\nheld a 4-year college degree, and less than 40 % of participants' parents had less\nthan a high school education. The race/ethnic backgrounds of participants were as\nfollows: 41 % Black, 34 % Latino American, 20 % non-Latino White, and 5 %\nOther. Because there were so few participants in the \"Other\" category, they were not\nincluded in these analyses. Males comprise 86.4 % of the overall study sample.\nAnalyzing males and females separately would be ideal, particularly considering\nthe potential sex differences in legal socialization [37]. However, only data from\nmales (N=1164) were used for this study because time-varying effects modeling\nrequires a large sample size.\nProcedures\nInterviews were conducted every 6 months for the first 3 years and then yearly for the\nadditional 4 years (total of 7 years). To create uniform time measurement for purposes\nof the present analyses, we combined data from the 6- to 36-month semiannual follow-\nup interviews into yearlong intervals, by averaging variables from the 6- and 12-month,\npresent analyses therefore include a total of 7 time points, each 1 year apart. Individuals\nhad to provide data at both time points to have valid data for any annual period; of the\n1164 male participants originally enrolled in this study, this requirement resulted in the\nloss of 48 participants from the analytic sample. Because the design of the study is an\naccelerated cohort design, there were different numbers of participants at each age\n2). Because there were so few participants at age 26, analyses were limited to ages 14 to\nMeasures\nLegitimacy The measure of legitimacy follows from the measure employed by Tom\nTyler [56, 60]. Using a 5-point scale ranging from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree,\nRace and Justice System Attitude Formation\nrespondents indicated their agreement with 11 statements about the legitimacy of the\njustice system and its actors (e.g., \"I have a great deal of respect for the police,\" or \"The\nbasic rights of citizens are protected in the courts\"). Higher values indicate higher levels\nof perceived legitimacy of the law [57, 59]. Psychometric analyses of the scale at\nbaseline indicated that it was reliable (alpha=.80; CFI=.92, RMSEA=. 07). Means and\nstandard deviations at each age are presented in Table 1.\nLegal Cynicism Following Sampson and Bartusch [46], our measure of legal cynicism\nasked respondents to rate their agreement with five statements (e.g., \"Laws are meant to\nbe broken\"). Items assess the extent to which laws or rules are not considered binding\nin the present lives of participants [46]. Higher values on this scale indicate more legal\ncynicism (range 1\u00ad4). Psychometric analyses of the scale at baseline indicated that it\nwas reliable (alpha=.60; CFI=.99, RMSEA=.03). Means and standard deviations at\neach age are presented in Table 1.\nPersonal Contact with Justice System Officials We used two separate measures of\npersonal contact with the justice system. First, using a life calendar approach,\nparticipants were asked at each yearly assessment whether they had been picked\nup by the police and been accused of committing a crime. Previous research\nsuggests that retrospective data gathered using life calendar methods is accurate\n[16] and that the data structure of the life calendar fits the structure of respondents'\nautobiographical memories well [2]. For example, Caspi and Amell [5] found that\nlife events reported 3 years earlier matched retrospective life history calendar data\nwith over 90 % accuracy. As such, the life calendar data collection method can\nprovide a more continuous and complete representation of life events than is\npossible with other interview or questionnaire measures. The percent of participants\nwho had been picked up by the police at each age is presented in Table 2. As a result\nTable 1 Means and standard deviations of legal socialization variables at each age\nAge Legitimacy Legal cynicism\nAll White Black Latino All White Black Latino\nA. Fine and E. Cauffman\nof small participant counts or low variability at certain ages, analyses were limited\nSecond, official court records were used to assess whether youth had been\nrearrested during each follow-up period. The percent of participants who had been\nrearrested at each age is presented in Table 2. As a result of the small participant\ncounts at certain ages and the large sample sizes necessary for analyzing intensive\nlongitudinal data, analyses were limited to ages 14 through 24. This construct\nenables us to examine the effects of two different types of justice system contact.\nThe Pearson correlations between the types of contacts at each age were between\nSelf-reported Offending Involvement in antisocial activities was measured with the\nSelf-report of offending [21]. Participants reported if they had been involved in any of\n22 illegal behaviors (e.g., \"Taken something from another person by force, using a\nweapon\") during each follow-up period. Because the variable was highly positively\nskewed, responses were dichotomized into either did not reoffend or did reoffend. The\npercentage of participants who reoffended at each age is presented in Table 2.\nStreet Time Because incarceration can limit opportunity to engage in antisocial\nacts, failure to account for this can affect the identification of trajectories of\nantisocial behavior [38]. Youths reported on a calendar the number of days during\nthe recall period that they had been in a detox/drug treatment program, psychiatric\nhospital, residential treatment program, or secure institution. All analyses con-\ntrolled for street time, operationalized as the proportion of time in a year an\nindividual was in the community. The amounts of exposure time reported for each\n6-month period were averaged to derive the exposure time covariate for each\nannual interval [30].\nTable 2 Percent who reoffended, were picked up by the Police, or were rearrested by age\nAge Self-report Reoffending Picked up by police Rearrested\nAll White Black Latino All White Black Latino All White Black Latino\nRace and Justice System Attitude Formation\nPlan of Analyses\nTo examine whether the likelihood of reoffending, of being picked up by the\npolice, or of being rearrested varies by race/ethnicity, we estimated random effects\nlogit models. Each model controlled for amount of time on the streets, and the\nsecond and third models also controlled for self-reported offending. In the second\nset of models, we estimated individual growth curve models using linear mixed\nmodels containing both fixed and random effects [42, 49]. Models were estimated\nin three stages. First, we conducted unconditional means models for legitimacy\nand cynicism to examine whether there was sufficient between-persons variability\nto conduct multi-level modeling. Second, after establishing that there was suffi-\ncient between-persons variability, we conducted growth models to examine the\naverage rate of change of each legal socialization measure over time. Third, we\nestimated conditional growth models to examine whether race/ethnicity accounts\nfor the variability in legitimacy and legal cynicism. In all models, we treat time\n(i.e., age) as both a random and fixed effect to explain specific time effects as well\nas change over time. Mixed models conceptualize growth curve models using two\nlevels of analysis [14, 42, 49]. The equations for the present analyses are as\nfollows:\nLevel 1 : LegalSocializationij\n\u00fe 1i ageij\n \n\u00fe rij\n\u00bc \n\u00fe \nRaceij\n\u00bc \n\u00fe \nRaceij\nCombined equation:\nLegalSocializationij\n\u00bc \n\u00fe \nRaceij\n\u00fe \nageij\n \n\u00fe \nageij\n*Raceij\n \n\u00fe u1i ageij\n \n\u00fe rij\nThe level 1 equation estimates within-person or intra-individual change over\ntime, assessing individual growth rates. Here, time is treated as a random effect\nsince we are generalizing individual effects across intervals of time. The level 2\nmodel estimates interindividual change in predictors that are estimated as fixed\neffects. Race/ethnicity is included as a level 2 variable. Accordingly, the model\nassesses within-person variability in the level 1 predictors, or growth rates, as a\nfunction of level 2 predictors [14]. To capture and estimate the effects of specific\ntime-varying factors on the slope (or rate of change) in the dependent variable, we\ninclude an interaction of time with each predictor at each time [14, 49].\nConsidering self-reported offending has been related to both legal cynicism and\nlegitimacy [11, 32], we also included self-reported offending as a dichotomous\nlevel 1 covariate in these analyses. Since the proportion of the time spent on the\nstreets also affects the ability to commit a variety of crimes, this variable is also\nA. Fine and E. Cauffman\nIn the final set of models, we examine whether subsequent personal contact with the\njustice system (being picked up by the police and accused of a crime or being\nrearrested) affects legal socialization, using the same set of controls variables.\nAlthough multilevel or hierarchical models have been widely used to examine longi-\ntudinal data, they rely on a priori specifications of the functional form of how the\nindependent variable affects change in the outcome. An extension of such methods, the\ntime-varying effects model (TVEM), enables one to examine whether there is a time-\nvarying relationship between the covariates and the outcomes [19, 28, 53, 55]. For\nexample, if we were to model the effects of system contact on the development of\nattitudes towards the justice system using multilevel modeling, the equations for the\nconditional growth models (where `SystemContact' refers to each independent predic-\ntor, modeled separately) would be:\nLevel 1 : LegalSocializationij\n\u00fe 1i ageij\n \n\u00fe 2i SystemContactij\n \n\u00fe rij\n\u00bc \n\u00fe \nRaceij\n\u00bc \n\u00fe \nRaceij\n\u00bc \n\u00fe \nRaceij\nCombined equation:\nLegalSocializationij\n\u00bc \n\u00fe \nRaceij\n\u00fe \nageij\n \n\u00fe \nageij\n*Raceij\n \n\u00fe\n\nSystemContactij\n \n\u00fe \nRaceij*SystemContactij\n \n\u00fe u1i ageij\n \n\u00fe u2i SystemContactij\n \n\u00fe rij\nThe equation thus pre-specifies a particular polynomial or other parametric form\nto the coefficient functions. It is rare, however, to observe behavior dynamics that\nfollow a simple developmental pattern [63] because most individual trajectories are\nnonparametric. In contrast, in TVEM, these patterns take the form revealed directly\nfrom the data. Thus, TVEM reveals the shape of the coefficient functions over time\nwithout posing any parametric assumptions on these functions [53]. TVEM thus\nflexibly estimates how the association between a predictor and an outcome (e.g.,\nlegitimacy and cynicism) differs over continuous time (e.g., from age 14 to 25),\nwithout assuming the association follows a parametric function of time. Both the\nintercept and slope are time-specific and change their values at different points in\ntime. That is, the coefficient for the time-varying predictor depends on time. For\nexample, a simple TVEM equation is:\nLegalSocializationij\n\u00bc \nt\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe \nt\n\u00f0 \u00de SystemContactij\n \n\u00fe ij\nIn this model, LegalSocialiationij\nrefers to the normally distributed legal socializa-\ntion variable (e.g., legitimacy), 0\nis the intercept parameter, 1\nis the slope parameter,\nSystemContactij\nis the particular justice system experience variable (e.g., rearrest), and\nij\nrefers to the normally distributed random errors. Importantly, the relations described\nRace and Justice System Attitude Formation\nby the intercept (0\n(t)) and slope (0\n(t)) are functions that summarize relations with\nvalues changing across time. Accordingly, the slope and intercept are modeled sepa-\nrately and are allowed to vary over time.\nWe fit a series of TVEM models using the recently developed SAS macro for\nnormally distributed outcome variables [28, 67]. The complex function is split into\nseveral equally spaced intervals (knots), and each portion of a function is estimated.\nWith this method, any complex function can be successfully approximated if a\nsufficient number of knots is specified. In the process of model selection, models with\na different number of knots are compared using AIC and BIC values [48]. Following\nthe recommendations of Shiyko and colleagues, we started with five knots and\nincreased until AIC and BIC values were decreased. First, we estimated how each\njustice system contact variable was related to legitimacy. Models were run separately\nby each predictor and by each race/ethnicity to allow for time-varying race/ethnicity\ndifferences. Because all predictors were assessed at all waves, we estimated time-\nvarying coefficients of time-varying predictors. We also controlled for self-reported\noffending and time on the streets at each age. These models were then repeated to\npredict legal cynicism. Results are presented as figures because time-varying coeffi-\ncients are estimated in continuous time leading to a number of coefficients too large to\npresent in tables [62].\nResults\nTo examine whether reoffending rates or justice system contacts varied by\nrace/ethnicity, we conducted a series of random effects logit models. All models\ncontrolled for time on the streets. White youth were used as the reference group, and\nanalyses were repeated using Latino youth as the reference group. Results indicate that\nthe likelihood of reoffending decreased for all youth as they transitioned from adoles-\nhood of reoffending by race/ethnicity at any age (all p's>.10). Considering there were\nno differences in the likelihood of reoffending, we then examined whether the proba-\nbility of being picked up by police varied by race/ethnicity. A series of random effects\nlogit models were conducted, controlling for self-reported offending and proportion of\ntime on the streets (Fig. 1). Results indicate that the likelihood of being picked up by\nthe police decreased over time for all youth (White dydx=-.165, p<.001; Black dydx=\nthe probability of being picked up. Specifically, White and Latino youth were equally\nlikely to be picked up over time (p=.827). Black youth were more likely to be picked\nin the probability of being picked up by the police, we then conducted random effects\nlogit models to examine whether the probability of being rearrested varied by\nrace/ethnicity. Results indicate that the probability of rearrest increased over time for\np<.001) (Fig. 2). White and Latino are equally likely to be arrested over time (p=.592).\nBlack youth are significantly more likely to be rearrested over time than either White\nA. Fine and E. Cauffman\nPerceived Legitimacy of the Justice System\nIn the second set of models, we estimated individual growth curve models using linear\nmixed models to examine whether subsequent personal contact with the justice system\n(i.e., being picked up by the police and accused of a crime or being rearrested) affect\ndevelopmental changes in legitimacy. First, we conducted an unconditional means\nPredicted Probability of Being Picked Up\nAge\nWhite Black Latino\nProbability of Being Picked Up by the Police\nFig. 1 Predicted probability of being picked up by the police by race\nFig. 2 Predicted probability of being rearrested by race\nRace and Justice System Attitude Formation\nmodel to understand developmental changes in legitimacy. The results of the uncondi-\ntional means models suggest that 53.8 % of the variability in legitimacy occurred\nbetween participants. The results of the unconditional growth model suggest that there\nwas variability in the intercept and slope of legitimacy (Table 3). Results of likelihood\nratio 2 tests for legitimacy suggest that the random intercept is significant (2=912.91,\nunconditional means and unconditional growth models indicate that multi-level model-\ning is appropriate.\nOnce it was established that multi-level modeling was appropriate, we added\nrace/ethnicity to the model to examine whether race/ethnicity accounts for significant\nvariability in legitimacy (Fig. 3). It is important to note that these growth models appear\ndifferent than the base means by age depicted in Table 1 because of the inclusion of the\ncontrol variables. The likelihood ratio chi-square test between the model with and the\nmodel without race/ethnicity suggests that including race/ethnicity reduces error vari-\nability in legitimacy (2=74.75, p<.001). Results of this model indicate that Black\nlegitimacy than either group through age 25 (p<.001).

Results of the likelihood ratio chi-square test suggest that including the\ninteraction between race/ethnicity and age improves model fit for legitimacy (2=7.05,\np=.029) (Fig. 3). Results of a simple slopes analysis for legitimacy suggest that only\nbetween Black and Latino are not significantly different from each other (p=.730).\nSpecifically, these findings indicate that the development of legitimacy varies by\nTable 3 Unconditional growth models of legitimacy and legal cynicism\nLegitimacy Legal cynicism\nFixed effects\nRandom effects\nModel fit\nA.

Figures 4, 5, and 6 present the results of the\nanalyses examining the time-varying effects of being picked up by the police on\nlegitimacy, separately by race/ethnicity.

Cauffman\nLegal Cynicism\nWhereas perceptions of justice system legitimacy are related to greater confidence in the\nlaw, legal cynicism indicates whether an individual feels violating the law can be\nreasonable. To examine whether the developmental mechanisms underlying these\nattitudes vary, we repeat the same set of analyses using legal cynicism. To assess\nwhether multilevel modeling was appropriate, unconditional means and growth models\nwere run. The results of the unconditional means model suggest that 51.7 % of the\nvariability in legal cynicism occurred between participants. The results of the uncon-\nditional growth models suggest that there was variability in the intercept and slope of\ncynicism (Table 3). Results of likelihood ratio 2 tests for cynicism suggest that the\nFig. 7 Time-varying effects model of the effect of being rearrested on legitimacy scores for Latino youth.\nNote: Dotted lines indicate 95 % confidence intervals.

It is important to note that these growth models appear\ndifferent than the base means by age depicted in Table 1 because of the inclusion of the\ncontrol variables. The likelihood ratio chi-square test between the model with and the\nmodel without race/ethnicity suggests that including race/ethnicity reduces error vari-\nability in cynicism (2=32.33, p<.001). Results indicate that White youth report lower\nFig. 9 Time-varying effects model of the effect of being rearrested on legitimacy scores for White youth.\nNote: Dotted lines indicate 95 % confidence intervals.

Fine and E. Cauffman\n(p<.001). Black youth report lower cynicism than Latino youth at age 14 (p=.011)\nand Latino youth (p>.081). Including the interaction between race/ethnicity and age does\nnot improve the model fit for cynicism (2=1.36, p=.506). Results of a simple slopes\nanalysis for cynicism that none of the slopes are significantly different from zero (White\np=.315) nor are any slopes significantly different from each other. These results indicate\nthat cynicism remains relatively stable from adolescence through young adulthood.\nHowever, racial differences in cynicism appear in adolescence and remain through\nyoung adulthood.\nOnce it was established that the development of cynicism varies by race/ethnicity,\nwe used time-varying effects modeling to examine the effects of personal contacts with\nthe justice system on legal socialization. Figures 11, 12, and 13 present the results of the\nanalyses examining the time-varying effects of being rearrested on cynicism ratings,\nseparately by race/ethnicity. Results indicate that being picked up by the police only\naffects Latino youths' cynicism from ages 18 to 20. Being picked up by the police does\nnot affect the cynicism ratings of Black or White youth. Figures 14, 15, and 16 present\nthe results of the analyses examining the time-varying effects of being rearrested on\ncynicism ratings. Interestingly, being rearrested does not affect cynicism for any youth.\nDiscussion\nConsidering that justice system attitudes have direct consequences for crime commis-\nunderstand whether justice system attitudes remain stable from adolescence through\nearly adulthood. Further, considering the salience of race/ethnicity to justice system\nexposure, it is likely that legal socialization experiences vary by race/ethnicity.\nHowever, race is one of the least explored constructs in life-course criminology [36].\nResults of this study indicate that justice system attitude formation over the course of\nadolescence and early adulthood varies dramatically by race/ethnicity. For both\nFig. 11 Time-varying effects model of the effect of being picked up by the police on cynicism scores for\nLatino youth. Note: Dotted lines indicate 95 % confidence intervals.

Although\nsurveys show that Latino adults report more negative attitudes than White adults (see\n[64]), the results of this study suggest that attitude differences emerge through adoles-\ncence. Latino and White youth report similar attitudes during adolescence, yet over\ntime, White youth begin to view the system more positively than Latino youth. As\nindicated by the simple slopes analyses, Latino youths' attitudes do not significantly\nchange over time. Results indicate that increasingly positive attitudes among White\nyouth, and not increasingly negative attitudes among Latino youth, likely account for\nthese differences. Indeed, White youth are the only group whose attitudes about the\nsystem become more positive as they age. Findings, in short, reveal a gradient in\nFig. 12 Time-varying effects model of the effect of being picked up by the police on cynicism scores for\nBlack youth.

Cauffman\nattitudes among White youth that begins in adolescence and becomes increasingly\ndifferentiated into early adulthood.\nConsidering the salience of race to justice system exposure, it is likely that justice\nsystem contacts also affect the legal socialization experiences differently by race. We\nfind that the negative effects of personal experiences with the justice system on attitude\ndevelopment vary by age, race/ethnicity, the particular type of contact (i.e., being\npicked up by the police versus being rearrested), and the particular attitude. For\nBlack youth, being picked up by the police affects legitimacy ratings at almost all\nages, though actually being rearrested does not affect their perceptions of justice system\nlegitimacy until early adulthood. Indeed, it may be the case that since Black youth were\nmore likely to be picked up by the police and to be rearrested than either White or\nFig. 14 Time-varying effects model of the effect of being rearrested on cynicism scores for Latino youth.\nNote: Dotted lines indicate 95 % confidence intervals.

The x-axis indicates the effect of being rearrested on\nyouths' cynicism ratings\nRace and Justice System Attitude Formation\nLatino youth over time, it is likely that these youths' disproportionate contact with the\njustice system may contribute to their more negative views of the justice system.\nIn contrast, neither being picked up by the police nor being rearrested significantly\naffects Latino youths' perceptions of justice system legitimacy. There are two possible\nexplanations. First, although direct, personal experiences with the justice system affect\nattitudes towards the justice system, vicarious experiences, or what family members,\nneighbors, or friends communicate to the youth about their experiences with the justice\nsystem, also likely affect attitude development. It may be that vicarious experiences\naffect Latino youth's attitudes more than their direct, personal experiences. Second, in\nline with some prior research [60], it may be that Black youths in this study were\ntreated more disrespectfully during police encounters than Latino or White youths.\nAccordingly, the effect of such encounters on attitude formation would be dispropor-\ntionately larger for Black youth (see [29]). However, data on what occurred during\nthese police encounters is unavailable; thus, additional research is necessary to examine\nthese theoretical explanations. Considering this is the first developmental study span-\nning adolescence through early adulthood, future research with alternative datasets is\nnecessary to understand why personal encounters with the justice system had limited\neffects on Latino youths' perceptions of the justice system.\nResults also indicate that the effects of personal contacts with the justice system on\nattitude formation largely occur during young adulthood, as compared with adoles-\ncence. Young adulthood is a key transitional phase for young men, a time during which\nthey generally move out of the home, seek self-sufficiency, employment, or higher\neducation. The effects of justice system contacts may be disproportionately more\nnegative during this transitional period when the young adult relies more on the self\nand less on the family. During adolescence, the family may be more involved in the\nyouth's life, such that negative effects of justice system contacts may be more mitigated\nby familial involvement. Future research should examine whether relationships miti-\ngate the effects of justice system experiences during different developmental periods.\nThis study has several limitations. First, because data were collected beginning at age\n14, it is unknown whether attitude development begins even before adolescence. Second,\nconsidering our statistical techniques require a large sample, this study focused\nFig. 16 Time-varying effects model of the effect of being rearrested on cynicism scores for White youth.\nNote: Dotted lines indicate 95 % confidence intervals. The x-axis indicates the effect of being rearrested on\nyouths' cynicism ratings\nA. Fine and E. Cauffman\nexclusively on male offenders. Future research on the legal socialization of female\noffenders is necessary considering there may be baseline differences between the sexes\nthat may contribute to differential legal socialization [11]. Third, this study only exam-\nined the effects of being picked up by the police or being rearrested on legal socialization.\nIf minority youth describe the procedures used by legal authorities as more unfair,\nassessing what actually occurred during the contact may pronounce the effects found\nin this study. Complementing quantitative analyses with qualitative methods would\nenhance our understanding of the mechanisms in the legal socialization process, provid-\ning a more complete picture of not just the quantitative number of contacts, but a deeper\nunderstanding of what is happening during each of the contacts. This is particularly\nimportant considering minority youth tend to have disproportionate contact with justice\nsystem officials. Finally, this study did not examine the effects of vicarious justice system\nexposure on the development of attitudes towards the justice system. In accordance with\nthe social developmental model [20], vicarious experiences with authorities likely shape\nyouths' attitudes towards the justice system [9, 12, 22, 45]. Although emerging research\nsuggests that vicarious negative experiences with justice system actors affect attitudes\ntowards the justice system [13, 15], research has not examined whether these effects are\nlimited to family members or friends, or if effects vary by developmental timing.\nDespite these limitations, this study has several strengths, including the use of\nlongitudinal statistical techniques. First, using longitudinal multilevel models enabled\nus to examine the trajectories of change in the legal socialization variables beginning in\nadolescence and continuing through early adulthood. Second, the use of the time-\nvarying effects model enabled us to examine whether there was a time-varying relation\nbetween the covariates and the outcomes. Rather than estimating an overall effect of a\ntime-varying covariate like rearrest, TVEM allows for the effect of each justice system\ncontact on each legal socialization variable to be dynamic. These analytic tools give us\ngreater confidence in our finding that not only does justice system attitude formation\nover the course of adolescence and early adulthood vary by race/ethnicity, but that the\neffects of personal experiences with justice system actors on attitude formation also\nvaries by attitude, type of contact, age, and by race/ethnicity.\nAlthough many of the study's hypotheses received support, we were surprised by\nour findings with legal cynicism. Despite a similar developmental trajectory for legal\ncynicism, we find that the mechanisms affecting legitimacy may not also affect legal\ncynicism. Results indicated that neither being picked up by the police nor being\nrearrested affected legal cynicism, with the exception of Latino youth briefly from\nages 18 to 20. However, these results may be due to a threshold effect. That justice\nsystem contacts may affect legitimacy but not cynicism raises the importance of\ndistinguishing between these attitudes. Cynicism refers to the degree to which individ-\nuals feel that the law does not apply to them and the degree to which an individual feels\nviolating the law can be reasonable. In contrast, legitimacy refers to the individual's\ntrust or confidence in the law. Repeated or negative interactions with justice system\nofficials would likely erode one's trust in the legal system, one's legitimacy. These\ninteractions, however, may not cause one to feel violating the law may be reasonable,\nnor may they actually cause one to break the law in the future. Understanding why\nyouth feel violating the law is reasonable and what mechanisms worsen these attitudes\nwould be particularly informative for practitioners. As such, additional research is\nnecessary to identify what mechanisms affect the development of legal cynicism.\nRace and Justice System Attitude Formation\nThis study was the first to examine how juvenile offenders' attitudes towards the\njustice system change during the transition to adulthood, and to demonstrate that the\nmechanisms of change vary based on developmental timing and race/ethnicity. The\nfindings clearly indicate a gradient of justice system attitudes by race/ethnicity that\nbegins in adolescence and becomes more pronounced into young adulthood. Black\nyouth view the system as the least legitimate and most cynically, followed by Latino\nyouth, and White youth. That mechanisms affect Black and Latino youth legal social-\nization differently indicates that aggregating minorities by analyzing all \"non-Whites\"\ntogether in future studies will mask meaningful differences. Considering that Black\nyouth in this sample come into disproportionate contact with the justice system despite\nengaging in the same level of offending, it is likely that Black youth are recognizing a\nracial bias in the system. Their disproportionate contacts with the justice system likely\nerode their perceptions of its legitimacy. Though Black youths' attitudes towards the\njustice system are characterized as more negative, their attitudes may also be more\nrealistic.\n"
