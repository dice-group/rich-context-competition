The CIDARS can\ndetect outbreak signals in a timely manner but generates many false-positive signals, especially for\ndiseases with seasonality. We assessed the influence of seasonality on infectious disease outbreak\ndetection performance.\nMethods: Chickenpox surveillance data in Songjiang District, Shanghai were used. The optimized\nearly alert thresholds for chickenpox were selected according to three algorithm evaluation\nindexes: sensitivity (Se), false alarm rate (FAR), and time to detection (TTD). Performance of\nselected proper thresholds was assessed by data external to the study period.\nResults: The optimized early alert threshold for chickenpox during the epidemic season was the\npercentile P65, which demonstrated an Se of 93.33%, FAR of 0%, and TTD of 0 days. The optimized\nearly alert threshold in the nonepidemic season was P50, demonstrating an Se of 100%, FAR of\n18.94%, and TTD was 2.5 days. The performance evaluation demonstrated that the use of an\noptimized threshold adjusted for seasonality could reduce the FAR and shorten the TTD.\nConclusions: Selection of optimized early alert thresholds based on local infectious disease\nseasonality could improve the performance of the CIDARS.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/imr\n1School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China\n2Songjiang Center for Disease Control and Prevention,\nShanghai, China\nCorresponding authors:\nGenming Zhao and Ruiping Wang, School of Public Health,\nFudan University, No. 130 Dong An Road, Xuhui District,\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\nCreative Commons CC BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n4.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.\nsagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

Several national-level\npublic health agencies have been established\nfor infectious disease outbreak detection\nby automated early alert systems.3\u00ad5 One\nsuch representative system, the China\nInfectious Disease Automated-alert and\nResponse System (CIDARS), was success-\nemploys the moving percentile method\n(MPM), the most commonly used temporal\ndetection method with which to detect aber-\nration in infectious diseases. In the MRM,\nthe reported cases in the current observation\nperiod are compared with those in a match-\ning historical period, potentially indicating\nthe early stages of potential outbreaks.7\nSeveral studies have indicated that many\ndeterminants influence the performance of\noutbreak detection accuracy.8,9 Evaluations\nof surveillance systems have demonstrated\nthat the CIDARS can detect many outbreak\nsignals in a timely manner but generates\nmany false-positive signals, especially for\ninfectious diseases with seasonality.10 This\nindicates that the performance of infectious\noutbreak detection may be influenced by the\nepidemiologic features of the infectious dis-\nease in question. Although the CIDARS\nincorporates the most recent 5 years of\nhistorical data to model the influence of\nseasonality,11 how seasonality influences the\nMPM algorithm's performance of infectious\ndisease outbreak detection in the CIDARS\nremains unclear.\nIn this study, we evaluated the influence\nof seasonality on the performance of\nchickenpox outbreak detection. We selected\nthe optimized early alert thresholds in the\nCIDARS during the epidemic and none-\npidemic seasons of chickenpox and exam-\nined whether separately setting the proper\nthresholds according to the seasonality can\nimprove the outbreak detection accuracy\nand timeliness.\nMethods\nData source\nThe CIDARS uses the real-time individual\ncase information housed in the Notifiable\nInfectious Disease Reporting Information\nSystem (NIDRIS).6 In this study, data for\nchickenpox cases that occurred from 2010 to\n2016 were extracted from the NIDRIS. The\ndata were organized by day and year and\nsaved in Excel format. Data from 2010 to\n2015 were used as the baseline to select the\noptimized thresholds by the MPM both in\nthe epidemic and nonepidemic seasons,\nwhile data from 2016 were used to validate\nthe outbreak detection performance of the\nselected optimized thresholds.\nStudy design\nIn this study, a chickenpox outbreak was\ndefined as five or more cases localizable to\nthe same mass gathering, village, school, or\ncommunity within 7 days.12 Chickenpox\nSongjiang District of Shanghai were\nassumed to be true outbreaks in this study.\nAll outbreaks were investigated and verified\nby local staff members of the China CDC,\nand these outbreaks were taken as the\nreference standard for optimized alert\nthreshold selection and outbreak detection\nperformance verification.\nFigure 1 shows a flowchart of the data\nprocessing in this study. The data processing\ninvolved proper threshold selection (part 1)\nand outbreak detection performance verifi-\ncation (part 2). In part 1, chickenpox was\nselected as the infectious disease with sea-\nsonality, 12 percentiles (Pxs) were calculated\nby the MPM based on the numbers of\nreported cases in 25 7-day data blocks\nused to predict the actual chickenpox\nwas then selected as the proper threshold\nthat indicated the shortest detection time or\ngave the lowest false alarm rate (FAR) when\nthe time to detection (TTD) was the same.\nIn part 2, selected proper thresholds with\nconsideration of seasonality were entered\ninto the CIDARS, and the performance of\nthe selected thresholds for chickenpox was\nevaluated according to the actual outbreaks\nMPM and outbreak detection\nperformance evaluation indexes\nIn the CIDARS, the MPM is applied to\nexplore aberrations and determine the opti-\nmized threshold of a Px for a common\ninfectious disease.13 The MPM uses the data\nof the most recent 5 years as baseline data,\nCIDARS\nModel building\nMoving percentile method (MPM)\n12 percentiles (Px) are calculated by\nnumbers in 25 seven day data blocks\nindicator of potential aberration to\npredict the chickenpox outbreaks in 2015\nThe chickenpox\nis taken as\nreference\nstandard for\nproper threshold\nselection\nThe outbreak detection performance is evaluated in terms\nof sensitivity (Se), false alarm rate (FAR) and time to\ndetection (TTD), a Px is selected as the proper threshold\nwhen the Px gives the shortest detection time, or gives the\nlowest false alarm rate when TTD is the same\nProper threshold selection Outbreak detection performance verification\nChickenpox is selected as infectious disease\nwith seasonality\nThe afore\nselected proper\nthresholds for\nchickenpox are\nset into the\nconsideration\nof seasonality\nThe chickenpox outbreaks\nreference standard to\nverify the outbreak\ndetection performance of\nselected proper thresholds\nThe selected thresholds is evaluated in terms of\nsensitivity (Se), false alarm rate (FAR) and time to\ndetection (TTD)\nFigure 1.

If the current day\ncount is greater than the detection param-\neter's corresponding percentile (detection\nparameter c), then an outbreak signal is\ngenerated.6,9 Thus, by using the MPM,\naberrations in disease occurrence are\ndetected by comparing the number of cases\nreported during the current observation\nperiod to that reported during a matching\nhistorical period.13 To eliminate the week-\nend effect, the current observation period is\ndefined as the most recent 7-day period, and\nthe number of cases is the total number\nof reported cases in that 7-day period. The\nhistorical period is defined as the 5 years\npreceding the current observation year, and\nthe matching historical period includes the\nsame 7-day period, the two previous 7-day\nperiods, and the two subsequent 7-day\nperiods for each of the previous 5 years.\nThis results in 25 7-day blocks of historical\ndata and covers 175 days. The Pxs of the\n25 historical data blocks are set as the\nindicators with which to detect infectious\ndisease outbreaks. The data blocks of the\ncurrent observation period and the match-\ning historical period are moved forward\ndynamically day by day. If the number of\ncases in the current observation period is\ngreater than the Px value of the 25 blocks of\ncorresponding historical data, then an out-\nbreak signal is produced.\nAccording to previous research,14\u00ad17 the\nonset of an outbreak is the onset date of\nthe first case, and the end of an outbreak is\nthe onset date of the last case associated with\nthe outbreak. An outbreak is detected if a\nsignal is generated by a Px of the MPM\nduring the outbreak. The outbreak detection\nperformance is evaluated in terms of the\nsensitivity (Se), FAR, and TTD.16 The Se is\nthe proportion of outbreaks detected; it is\ncalculated as the number of detected out-\nbreaks divided by the total number of\nreported outbreaks. The FAR is the pro-\nportion of early warning signals indicating\nfalse outbreaks. The TTD is the duration\nbetween the first true alarm and the onset of\nan outbreak; if an outbreak is flagged on the\nfirst day, then the TTD is set as 0. To calculate\nthe timeliness of detection of all outbreaks,\nthe total duration of an outbreak is assigned\nas the TTD for undetected outbreaks. To\nobtain the optimized early alert thresholds of\nMPM, 12 alternative Pxs are calculated,\nPx is selected as the optimized threshold for\nthe MPM when that Px gives the smallest\nTTD or provides the lowest FAR if the TTD\nOptimized threshold verification\nIn Songjiang District of Shanghai, the\nincidence rate of chickenpox has seasonal\ncharacteristics; winter and early spring is the\nepidemic season. The seasonality of chicken-\npox is defined according to the epidemic\ncurve (Figure 2), which is based on retro-\nspective baseline data and consultation with\nepidemiologists. For 2015, the nonepidemic\nseason was defined as the period from\nall other days in 2015 were defined as the\nepidemic season. For 2016, the period from\ndefined as the epidemic season, and all other\ndays in 2016 were defined as the nonepidemic\nseason. The optimized early alert thresholds\nfor chickenpox with consideration of season-\nality were entered into the CIDARS. The\noutbreak detection performance for the opti-\nmized thresholds were verified by the Se,\nFAR, and TTD according to the chickenpox\nData analysis\nData analysis was performed using Excel\nR software (version 2.14.1; R Foundation\nfor Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).\nExcel was used to sort the data, and R was\nused to calculate the evaluation indexes\n(Se, FAR, and TTD) and identify the\nproper Px threshold for chickenpox.\nResults\nChickenpox incidence during\nreported with an incidence rate of 89.43\nnumber of chickenpox cases reported during\nthe epidemic season accounted more than\nhalf of that during the whole year.

The\noutbreak detection performance verification\nalso demonstrated that the optimized early\nalert threshold could achieve a good early\nalert effect for infectious disease outbreak\ndetection in both the epidemic and none-\npidemic seasons.\nOur findings can partly explain why\ninfectious disease seasonality affects the\noutbreak detection performance of the\nCIDARS, particularly when considering a\nprevious description of variation of the\nchickenpox incidence rates in different epi-\nshown that for infectious diseases with sea-\nsonality, the numbers of cases and outbreaks\ndiffered greatly within different epidemic\nseasons; thus, the scale of outbreaks and\noutbreak-related case characteristics might\nalso differ during the epidemic season.\nKuang et al.21 reported that outbreak\ndetection performance in automated surveil-\nlance systems is affected by many determin-\nants. Diseases with a long incubation period\nhave a higher Se but require a longer time for\ndetection, and outbreaks of diseases with a\nshort incubation time are severe but transient,\nleading to a lower Se. Additionally, diseases\nwith a lower outbreak magnitude have the\nsame Se but require more time for detection.\nWang et al.12 reported that the morbidity and\nmortality associated with infectious diseases\nand the emergency response ability of the\nChinese Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention should also be taken into consid-\neration during selection of the optimized early\nalert threshold in the CIDARS. We suggest\nthat both the epidemic features and local\ncharacteristics of infectious diseases should\nalso be taken into consideration. A lower\nthreshold may be preferable if the evaluated\ninfectious disease is associated with a tremen-\ndous threat and has reliable treatment and\ncontrol measures. However, it may be wiser to\nselect a relatively higher threshold when the\ninfectious disease has mild effects but a high\ncost of investigation and control.23\nA key strength of our study is the use of\ndata from epidemiologically confirmed out-\nbreaks. These confirmed outbreak data\nobjectively reflect the real features of these\noutbreaks and related cases. The use of real\ndata for optimized early alert threshold\nselection and performance evaluation could\ngenerate a more reliable reference standard\nthan simulated outbreaks. Another strength\nof this study is that we prospectively eval-\nuated the selection of optimized early alert\nthresholds for different epidemic seasons\nusing data external to the study period.\nThis study also has some limitations. First,\nwe only evaluated chickenpox as a represen-\ntative infectious disease; thus, it is likely that\nthe study results are unsuitable for other\ndiseases with seasonality. Second, all\nreported chickenpox outbreaks in 2015 and\n2016 were investigated and validated, but\nsome outbreaks were inevitably missed. This\nmay have affected the Se and FAR, especially\nin the nonepidemic season. Third, the selec-\ntion of optimized early alert thresholds for\ndifferent epidemic seasons was based on\nlimited epidemiologically confirmed out-\nbreaks, which may have affected the stability\nof the evaluation. Finally, we only evaluated\nthe influence of the infectious disease season-\nality on outbreak detection performance;\nhowever, other epidemic features including\nthe outbreak magnitude, incubation period,\nand baseline counts may also influence out-\nbreak detection performance. Future studies\nshould incorporate improvements to fully\nevaluate these factors.\nConclusions\nSelection of optimized early alert thresh-\nolds based on the seasonality of local\ninfectious diseases in the CIDARS is crucial\nto improve the performance of outbreak\ndetection.\n"
