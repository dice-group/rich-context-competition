Does diversification indeed lead to enhanced performance\nand therefore greater safety for banks as traditional portfolio and banking theory would suggest? In\nthis paper we try to shed some light on these questions by empirically investigating the situation for\nGerman banks. By exploiting a unique data set of individual bank loan portfolios for the period from\n1996 to 2002, we analyse the link between banks' profitability measured by ROA and their portfolio\ndiversification measured by the Herfindahl Index across different industries, broader economic sectors\nand geographical regions. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to study the\neffect of all three types of diversification based jointly on micro-level data on German banks.\nThe relevant academic literature puts forward two conflicting theories concerning the optimal degree\nof diversification. While traditional banking and portfolio theory recommends that banks should be as\ndiversified as possible to reduce their risks of suffering a costly bank failure, corporate finance theory\nsuggests that a bank should focus so as to obtain the greatest possible benefit from management's\nexpertise and to reduce agency problems.\nOur results clearly support the latter theory, as the evidence we present indicates that each kind of\ndiversification tends to lower German banks' returns, ie focusing generally increases profitability.\nFurthermore, the impact of any diversification on banks' return changes in line with the risk level.\nWhile the effect of sectoral focus on return declines monotonously with increasing risk, there is mixed\nevidence to suggest either a monotonously decreasing or a U-shaped relationship for regional focus as\nwell as a rather distinct indication of a U-shape with respect to industrial focus. In addition, our data\nshows that diversification significantly improves banks' profits only in the case of moderate risk levels\nand industrial diversification. Hence, from a policy point of view, regarding the decision on whether to\nincrease the degree of their industrial, sectoral or geographical diversification banks should evaluate\ncarefully the actual riskiness of their activities.\nNicht-Technische Zusammenfassung\nSollen Banken ihr Portfolio diversifizieren oder sich besser auf bestimmte Bereiche konzentrieren? Ist\nes empirisch belegbar, dass ein h\u00f6heres Ma\u00df an Diversifikation die Ertragskraft der Banken st\u00e4rkt und\nsomit ihre Sicherheit erh\u00f6ht, wie es von der traditionellen Portfolio- und Bankentheorie postuliert\nwird? Die vorliegende Arbeit versucht mittels einer empirischen Studie \u00fcber die Situation bei\ndeutschen Banken n\u00e4heren Aufschluss \u00fcber diese Fragen zu geben. Auf der Grundlage der gemeldeten\nKreditportfolios einzelner Banken im Zeitraum 1996 - 2002 wird der Zusammenhang zwischen der\nRentabilit\u00e4t der Banken und der Diversifikation ihrer Portfolios \u00fcber verschiedene Branchen, breiter\ngefasste Wirtschaftssektoren und geographische Regionen hinweg analysiert. Soweit den Autoren\nbekannt ist, handelt es sich hierbei um die bislang einzige Arbeit, welche all drei Diversifikationsarten\ngleichzeitig untersucht, und ebenfalls um die erste Studie, die sich auf Mikrodaten deutscher Banken\nst\u00fctzt.\nIn der akademischen Literatur finden sich zwei widerspr\u00fcchliche Theorien \u00fcber den optimalen\nDiversifizierungsgrad von Banken. W\u00e4hrend die traditionelle Portfolio- und Bankentheorie empfiehlt,\ndass Banken ihre Aktivit\u00e4ten m\u00f6glichst breit streuen sollen, um das Risiko eines Bankkonkurses zu\nreduzieren, schl\u00e4gt die Corporate Finance Literatur vor, Banken sollten sich auf ausgew\u00e4hlte Bereiche\nspezialisieren, um m\u00f6glichst stark Management Expertise aufbauen und Anreizprobleme reduzieren zu\nk\u00f6nnen.\nDie Ergebnisse der vorliegenden empirischen Untersuchungen unterst\u00fctzen nun eher die zweite\nHypothese, da alle drei Diversifikationsarten die Ertragslage deutscher Banken tendenziell negativ\nbeeinflussen, mithin eine h\u00f6here Spezialisierung in der Regel mit einer gr\u00f6\u00dferen Rentabilit\u00e4t\neinhergeht. Hinzu kommt, dass sich bei jeder Diversifikationsart der Einfluss auf die Ertragslage der\nBanken mit dem Risikoprofil ver\u00e4ndert. W\u00e4hrend bei der sektoralen Konzentration der positive Effekt\nauf die Ertragslage bei steigendem Risiko monoton abnimmt, gibt es im Hinblick auf die regionale\nFokussierung sowohl f\u00fcr einen monoton abnehmenden als auch f\u00fcr einen U-f\u00f6rmig verlaufenden\nZusammenhang Hinweise. Die Ergebnisse bei der Branchenfokussierung wiederum sprechen ziemlich\ndeutlich f\u00fcr einen U-f\u00f6rmigen Zusammenhang, so dass sich st\u00e4rkere Spezialisierungen besonders bei\nsehr geringem und sehr hohem Risiko ertragssteigernd auswirken. In Summe weist bei den\nuntersuchten deutschen Daten eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Diversifizierung nur bei moderaten Risikoprofilen und\neiner Diversifikation nach Branchen einen signifikanten positiven Effekt auf die Ertragslage der\nBanken aus, weshalb Banken bei der Wahl ihres optimalen Diversifizierungsgrades unbedingt ihre\naktuelle Risikosituation ber\u00fccksichtigen sollten.\nContent\n1 Introduction...................................................................................................................... 2\n2 Data.................................................................................................................................... 4\n2.1 DATA SOURCES.......................................................................................................................................... 4\n2.2 MEASUREMENT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF DIVERSIFICATION ....................................................................... 6\n2.3 BALANCE-SHEET VARIABLES..................................................................................................................... 7\n2.4 SUMMARY STATISTICS............................................................................................................................... 9\n3 Empirical framework..................................................................................................... 10\n3.1 AVERAGE IMPACT OF DIVERSIFICATION................................................................................................... 10\n3.2 CONSISTENCY WITH PORTFOLIO THEORY................................................................................................. 12\n3.3 DIVERSIFICATION, MONITORING EFFECTIVENESS AND RETURNS.............................................................. 14\n4 Conclusions ..................................................................................................................... 21\nReferences ............................................................................................................................... 23\nDoes diversification improve the performance of German banks?\nEvidence from individual bank loan portfolios1\nEvelyn Hayden2\nBanking Analysis and Inspections Division\nOesterreichische Nationalbank\nE-mail: Evelyn.Hayden@oenb.at\nDaniel Porath\nDepartment of Statistics\nUniversity of Applied Sciences Mainz\nAn der Bruchspitze 50\nE-mail: Daniel.Porath@wiwi.fh-mainz.de\nNatalja v.

Does diversification indeed\nlead to enhanced performance and, therefore, greater safety for banks, as traditional portfolio and\nbanking theory would suggest? In this paper, we try to shed some light on these questions by\ninvestigating empirically the situation of German banks.\nThe focus versus diversification issue is important in the context of banks as they are affected by\nseveral regulations that create incentives either to diversify or to focus their portfolios, ie the\nimposition of capital requirements tied to the risk of the banks' assets or asset investment restrictions.\nHence, policymakers should be especially interested to see whether or not banks benefit from\ndiversification.\nExperts on financial institutions generally argue that banks \u00ad which are typically highly leveraged \u00ad\nshould diversify to reduce their risks of suffering a costly bank failure. In addition, several models of\nintermediation theory suggest that diversification makes it cheaper for institutions to achieve\ncredibility in their role as screeners or monitors of borrowers (see, for example, Diamond (1984) and\nBoyd and Prescott (1986)). However, corporate finance theory suggests that firms should, if anything,\nfocus in order to avoid value-reducing diversification effects due to agency problems as pointed out by\nDenis et al (1997) or in order to avoid inefficient allocation of resources due to internal power\nstruggles between divisions as discussed by Rajan et al (2000) or in order to protect themselves from\nsignificant losses in the firm value associated with corporate diversification strategies as documented\nby Berger and Ofek (1995). Since real-world cases can be found to support either view, the question\narises as to the circumstances which call for one strategy or the other to be applied.\nWinton (1999) presents a theoretical framework to investigate the above issue. In his model, the\nincentives of a bank to monitor loans and a bank's risk of failure strongly affect a bank's decision on\nwhether to diversify or not. Diversification benefits appear to be greatest for banks with moderate\nlevels of downside risk and when the banks' monitoring incentives need strengthening. Specialised\nbanks with low exposure to downside risk have only minor incentives to diversify since diversification\nmight increase their probability of failure, which is considered to be low at present. For diversified\nbanks with sufficiently high downside risk, diversification can actually increase the probability of\ndefault since a diversified bank is exposed to more sectors than a specialised one and a downturn in\none sector is enough to make a bank fail. Furthermore, banks which expand into new economic sectors\nor geographical regions have less expertise and, therefore, a lower monitoring effectiveness in these\nareas, at least initially. Some papers also suggest that a bank entering a sector with several established\nbanks faces increased adverse selection in its pool of borrowers (see, for example, Gehrig (1998) and\nShaffer (1998)). Seen in this light, diversification may prove to be unattractive, particularly when the\nbank's loans have either a low or high downside risk.\nAlthough the issue of focus versus diversification has a long history in corporate finance literature, it\nhas not been addressed thoroughly in an empirical context for financial institutions and banks. The\nexisting literature focuses mainly on geographical diversification and US data, and also provides\nmixed results. Hughes et al (1996) and Berger and DeYoung (2001), for example, use more\naggregated measures of bank diversification to examine geographical diversification for US banks,\nwhile Caprio and Wilson (1997) consider cross-country evidence of a relationship between\nconcentration and bank insolvency. In addition, Dahl and Logan (2003) and Buch at al (2004) suggest\nthat international diversification offers benefits while, according to Klein and Saidenberg (1998) and\nMorgan and Samolyk (2003), the geographical diversification of US banks is not necessarily\nassociated with an increase in profitability. DeLong (2001) finds that geographically-focused bank\nmergers in the US result in superior performance, while Stiroh and Rumble (2003) and Stiroh (2004)\nshow that a shift towards non-interest income does not offer large diversification benefits.\nTherefore, there is clearly a need for more empirical evidence on the effects of diversification on\nbanks' performance based on individual bank-level data from European countries. The leading study\nin this respect is probably the one by Acharya et al (2006), which examines the impact of sectoral and\nindustrial loan diversification on the performance of Italian banks. The results of this study are\nconsistent with Winton's theory of a deterioration in the effectiveness of banks' monitoring activities\nat high levels of risk. In addition, Acharya et al find that both industrial and sectoral loan\ndiversification reduces banks' returns while endogenously producing riskier loans for high-risk banks\nin their sample. This implies that a diversification of banks' assets is not guaranteed to result in a\nsuperior return performance and/or greater safety for Italian banks.\nThe question now arises as to whether the Italian results are valid for other European countries, too.\nOur study attempts to fill this gap by studying the situation of the German banking industry. Based on\na unique data set of Deutsche Bundesbank involving data on individual bank loan portfolios\ndisaggregated at micro level for the period from 1996 to 2002, we assess the impact of sectoral,\nindustrial and geographical diversification on banks' profitability by looking at three major aspects.\nFirstly, we are interested in the average effect on banks' returns of banks' portfolio diversification\nacross industries, sectors and regions. Secondly, we try to gain an insight into whether diversification\nis used as an instrument to induce shifts in banks' risk-return efficiency. Thirdly, we test how\nmonitoring effectiveness on the part of low, medium and high-risk banks impacts on the relationship\nbetween banks' portfolio diversification and banks' returns. Here \u00ad in contrast to previous studies \u00ad we\napply a Value at Risk approach to measure banks' risk and derive unexpected losses for each\nindividual bank as, in our opinion, unexpected losses are better suited to capturing banks' riskiness\nthan is the more common proxy of expected losses.\nOur main findings are as follows. Firstly, we find that portfolio diversification across different sectors,\nindustries and regions tends to have a negative effect on banks' profitability rather than to lead to\nimproved returns. Larger benefits are associated with geographical focus, whereas benefits from\nindustrial focus appear to be only moderate. Secondly, there is evidence that, instead of operating at a\nconstant risk-return efficiency level, banks use diversification in order to change their risk-return\nprofile. As banks with highly risky credit portfolios are not systematically more profitable than banks\nwith low risk portfolios, it seems that, overall, banks are not risk-return efficient. Thirdly, the\nprofitability benefits associated with diversification are strongly dependent on the banks' risk level. In\naddition, the type of focus plays a crucial role. While the effect of sectoral focus on return declines\nmonotonously with increasing risk, there is mixed evidence to suggest either a monotonously\ndecreasing or a U-shaped relationship for regional focus as well as a rather distinct indication of a U-\nshape with respect to industrial focus. Therefore, our results confirm, at least partly, Winton's theory\nthat diversification benefits are greatest for moderate risk levels. Finally, our data shows that\ndiversification significantly improves banks' profitability only in the case of moderate risk levels and\nindustrial diversification.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we describe our data and in Section 3\nwe present the empirical results before reaching a conclusion in Section 4.\nThe main data source for our analysis originates in the database of the credit register for loans of 1.5\nmillion euro (formerly 3 million Deutsche Mark) or more at the Deutsche Bundesbank3. German banks\nhave to provide quarterly reports on all claims exceeding the threshold of 1.5 million euro. Bank\n3 Since the data in the credit register have been primarily gathered for regulatory rather than research purposes, the credit\nregister may overstate and even double-count exposures (Deutsche Bundesbank 1998a). Actual exposures of firms to banks\nare overstated since they include both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions. Some off-balance sheet exposures do\nnot appear to be direct exposures to a firm but e.g. guarantees for this firm's loans from another bank. Therefore, the\ninclusion of off-balance sheet exposures, which in reality represent guarantees, leads to actual exposure being overstated.\nSince in this study we have used only on-balance sheet positions this problem does not imply to our case. Actual exposures\nare double-counted in some rare cases, though, when partners of companies under civil law (Gesellschaft b\u00fcrgerlichen\nRechts, GBR) are jointly accountable for losses. In this case, the exposure of the GBR is reflected in the position of each\npartner with the same amount. Unfortunately, we cannot adjust the data for this double-counting, however, the error should\nbe neglectable in size, as companies under civil law are typically small firms whose debt does not exceed the threshold of 1.5\nmillion euro and hence is not included in the credit register.\nclaims are defined fairly broadly and cover details of types of claims4, types of borrowers by industries\nand sectors, international claims by individual foreign countries and regions5. In addition to balance\nsheet bank activities, claims also incorporate information on off-balance-sheet activities6. This credit\nregister data set on the exposures of individual banks is combined with financial data from the second\nBundesbank data source, namely BAKIS (BAKred7 Information System). BAKIS incorporates\ninformation derived from the bank balance sheets and supervisory reports of all German banks. Our\ndependent variable and control variables stem from BAKIS. Since the data on bank balance sheets is\nmostly of annual frequency, we used annual data for the period from 1996 to 2002. Both the credit\nregister and BAKIS represent unique data sources never before exploited in order to investigate the\nrelationship between the diversification and performance of German banks.\nOur data sample covers not only banks but also their subsidiaries and includes 3,760 individual\nentities. However, as small banks usually grant only very few large loans, the loans reported to the\ncredit register sometimes cover only a rather small fraction of the total credit volume outstanding\naccording to the banks' balance sheets. This implies that it might be misleading to analyse the\ndiversification structure of these small banks on the basis of the information from the credit register, as\nthe breakdown of the total portfolio could differ significantly from that of one of the large loans.\nTherefore, our study focuses only on those banks where the ratio of the reported balance-sheet loans\nfrom the credit register to the total amount of assets according to the balance sheet exceeds 50%.8 We\nalso exclude affiliates of German banks abroad, mortgage banks and special-purpose banks from our\nanalysis. This reduces the number of eligible banks to 983.\nOver the period 1996 to 2002 many bank mergers took place. To handle mergers, we separate the two\npre-merger banks from the merged bank. At the end, we thus have three banks, which are treated\nindependently. We repeat this procedure as often as a merger took place. Additionally, in order to\navoid the double counting of banks in the year of the merger, we dropped target banks in the year of\nthe acquisition.\n4 For example, lease receivables, mortgage loans, publicly guaranteed loans, inter-bank loans (with a residual maturity of up\nto one year) are listed separately under on balance sheet activities.\n5 The following items are deemed not to be credit exposures: shares in other enterprises irrespective of how they are shown in\nthe balance sheet and securities in the trading portfolio (Deutsche Bundesbank, 1998b).\n6 Off balance sheet items include derivatives (other than written option positions), guarantees assumed in respect of these and\nother off balance sheet transactions (Deutsche Bundesbank, 1998b).\n7 The former Federal Banking Supervisory Authority, now BaFin (Bundesanstalt f\u00fcrFinanzdienstleistungsaufsicht), ie the\nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority.\n8 For these banks, the average coverage rate is about 70%.\n2.2 Measurement of different types of diversification\nThe data from the credit register provide considerable details about the industrial, broader sectoral and\ngeographical breakdown of German bank claims. On an individual bank basis, the following\ninformation on the portfolio breakdown is available.\n1. The disaggregated industrial sector breakdown includes (1) agricultural, forestry and fishing\nproducts, (2) energy products, (3) iron and non\u00adiron material and ore, (4) ores and products based\non non-metallic minerals, (5) chemicals, (6) metal products, apart from machinery and means of\nconveyance, (7) agricultural and industrial machinery, (8) office, EDP machinery and others, (9)\nelectrical material, (10) transport, (11) food products, beverages and tobacco-based products, (12)\ntextiles, leather, shoes and clothing products, (13) paper, publishing and printing products, (14)\nrubber and plastic products, (15) other industrial products, (16) construction, (17) services trade\nand similar, (18) hotel and public firms' products, (19) internal transport services, (20) sea and air\ntransport, (21) transport-related services, (22) communication services and (23) other sales-related\nservices. It should be noted that, in aggregate, these exposures (collectively defined in the data as\nnon\u00adfinancial and household exposures) constitute the dominant part of most banks' portfolios.\n2. The broader sectoral breakdown includes (1) financial institutions and banks, (2) non-financial\ncorporations, (3) households, (4) the public sector and (5) other counter-parties.\n3. The geographical breakdown includes (1) Germany, six regions according to the IMF\nclassification: (2) industrial countries, (3) Asia, (4) Africa, (5) the Middle East, (6) the Western\nhemisphere, (7) Emerging Europe, and (8) others.9\nTo measure diversification (or, alternatively, focus), we use the Hirschmann-Herfindahl Index. It is\ncalculated as the sum of the squares of exposures as a fraction of total exposure under a given\nclassification and is represented by the following formula\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\nn\ni\ni\nX\nX\nH\n,\nwhere n is the number of groups and Xi\nmeasures exposure to industry, sector or region i. The smallest\nand largest possible values for the Herfindahl Index are given by 1/n  H  1. Hence, lending is more\nconcentrated the closer the Herfindahl Index is to one and is perfectly diversified if H equals 1/n.\nIn our case, we constructed three different kinds of Herfindahl Indices: an industrial (and household)\nsector Herfindahl Index (HI), a broad asset type (or sectoral) Herfindahl Index (HT) and a regional (or\ngeographical) Herfindahl Index (HR).\n9 For further details, see Nestmann et al. (2003).\n2.3 Balance-sheet variables\nWe employed the following (annual) variables obtained from the balance sheet data for the banks in\nReturn measures\n\"Operating Profit/Assets\" serves as the principal measure of return. All of the results displayed are\nbased on this measure. However, we also performed robustness checks using other measures, such as\n\"Operating Profit/Equity\". We found that, overall, the results are robust with respect to the return\nmeasures employed.\nRisk measures\nThe simplest method of measuring risk would be to look at a balance sheet ratio such as \"Doubtful and\nNon-Performing Loans/Total Loans\", which could be interpreted as capturing the level of expected\nlosses. However, we consider that risk is more accurately represented by unexpected losses, which is\nthe reason why we focused on a Value at Risk (VaR) measure.\nValue at Risk is the most widespread method of determining a bank's loan portfolio risk. The Value at\nRisk of bank i in period t, VaRit\n, is the maximum loss over a target horizon such that, with a pre-\nspecified probability p, the realised loss will be smaller. The unexpected loss can be determined from\nthe distribution of the portfolio losses at the target horizon as the difference between the mean of the\nportfolio value and the value at the p-percentile. In our calculations, p is 99.9%. This is based on the\nobservation that banks typically work with percentiles higher than 99.5%. Since the following\nestimations are fixed-effects panel models where the levels of the variables are differenced out, the\nexact level of p will not affect our results. The values for the VaR have to be taken from the\ndistribution of the portfolio value. We estimated the portfolio's value distribution using a simplified\nversion of CreditMetrics.10 The basic assumptions of CreditMetrics are that the returns of a debtor's\nassets are normally distributed and that a default occurs when the returns of a debtor fall below a\ncertain threshold. The default threshold is determined from the probability of default (PD).\nAs our data set does not comprise rating information for individual loans, we used the average\ninsolvency rate of the industry associated with the loan in order to proxy the default probability for a\nloan and to calculate its return threshold. We further assumed that the correlation between the returns\nof debtors can be approximated by the correlation between the industries' insolvency rates.11 Using\nequal probabilities of default for each bank, however, may bias the results since, for example, focused\nbanks may have more effective monitoring systems and, therefore, grant loans with lower PDs than\ndiversified banks. Therefore, as no information on the risk of loans at an industry and individual bank\nlevel is available for German banks, we had to adjust the (observed) industry insolvency ratios by\nbank-specific factors. To do so, we defined the industry insolvency ratio multiplied by a scale\nparameter which is related to a bank's loan loss provisions as a bank-specific PD. 12 As a result, banks\nwith large loan loss provisions (divided by the amount of total loans) are assigned higher PDs for\nloans to a specific industry than are banks with lower provisions. It should be noted that bank loans to\nall industries are adjusted using the same scale factor because, unfortunately, the data does not allow\nfor a more precise adjustment.\nThe current value of a bank's overall portfolio at the beginning of a period is given by the sum of the\nbank's individual exposures to each industry, which we took from the credit register as described\nabove. We then simulated returns using a multivariate normal distribution with mean zero and the\ncorrelation matrix from the insolvency data.13 Defaults occur when the simulated returns fall below the\nthreshold given by the critical values derived from the industries' annual insolvency rates. The\nsimulated value of the portfolio at the end of the period is equal to the value at the beginning of the\nperiod less 45% of the loans defaulting in the simulations, which means that we assume a loss given\ndefault (LGD) of 45% in line with the Basel II proposal (see Basel Committee on Banking\nloss distribution of a single bank in a specific period. Using the loss distribution, we calculated the\n11 The insolvency data used were those of the Federal Statistical Office (Statistisches Bundesamt). The industry codes of the\ninsolvency data correspond to the industry codes of the credit register. The insolvency rate of a specific industry is calculated\nas the number of insolvencies divided by the total number of companies in the industry. The probability of default of a\nspecific industry is then calculated as the average of the annual data from 1994 to 2002. The correlation between insolvencies\nof the industries is calculated using monthly data for the same period.\n12 More precisely, the scale parameter for bank i is defined as\nScaleit\n= Pr Insolvency Rate Exposure\njt jit\nLoan Loss ovisions j\nit\nTotal Loans Exposure\nit jit\nj\n\n\nwhere i, t and j index the bank, the period and the industry.

In line with Moody's KMV Credit Monitor, we introduce a cap of\n13 Insolvency data are used as a proxy for asset correlations since the latter are not observable. As a result, VaRit\nmight be\nnegatively biased as asset correlations are usually higher than insolvency correlations. However, with the assumption that the\ndifferences between the correlations of assets and insolvency are constant over time, the bias will difference out in the fixed-\neffects estimation.\n14 As mentioned above, the VaR level differences out in the fixed effects estimations, which means that the value of the LGD\nwill not affect our results.\nunexpected loss as the difference between the 99.9% quantile and the mean. Finally, the variable Riskit\nwas calculated as\nRiskit\n= Unexpected Lossit\n/Total Exposureit\nIn order to obtain a panel of observations for Riskit,\nwe repeated the simulations for each bank and\neach period of our sample.\nControl variables\nBanks' returns might not only be dependent on the respective banks' diversification and risk; they are\nalso likely to differ as a result of other criteria. In the estimation, we controlled for unobservable\nindividual and time effects by using dummy variables. The bank-specific dummies check for all\neffects which do not change for individual banks over time. These effects include, for example,\ncharacteristics which differ between banking groups, such as regional constraints on the part of\nGerman savings or cooperative banks or different ownership structures. In addition to these fixed\neffects, we also monitored characteristics which may change over time.\nPersonnelit\n= Personnel Costsit\n/ Assetsit\nSizeit\n= Ln(Assetsit\n).\nIn line with Acharya et al (2006) we used the variable Personnelit\nto proxy cost efficiency. The\nrationale is that banks with different cost efficiency levels may transform the benefits from\ndiversification in a different way. The variable Sizeit\ncaptures the possible effects of scale on return.\nThe banks' equity ratio is a common control variable in many empirical studies (Acharya et al (2006),\nEquityit\n= Equity Capitalit\n/ Assetsit\nThe amount of capital banks hold depends on the banks' risks and risk preferences. Accordingly,\nEquityit\ndepends on Riskit\nand the Herfindahl Indices. We tried to avoid the emergence of bias from\nthis dependency and thus estimated the influence of diversification on returns without controlling for\nequity. However, in order to compare our results with those from other studies (for example, Acharya\net al (2006)), we report results which include Equityit\n, too.\n2.4 Summary statistics\nTable 1 presents univariate descriptive statistics for the variables used in the following estimations.\nNote that the mean (median) bank's size in the sample is about 4.2 billion euro (0.9 billion euro). The\naverage industrial and sectoral focus measures (HI and HT) are quite low, which suggests a significant\ndegree of diversification in these areas. However, the average geographical focus HR is rather high,\nwhich captures the fact that most German banks primarily do business with domestic counter-parties.\nHTit\nHRit\nHIit\nReturnit\nRiskit\nPersonnelit\nSizeit\nEquityit\nCorrelation\nHTit\nHRit\nHIit\nReturnit\nRiskit\nPersonnelit\nSizeit\nEquityit\nIn addition, Table 1 presents the correlation matrix among the explanatory variables of the following\nestimations. As it illustrates, the three Herfindahl Indices are not highly correlated. This suggests that\nthe effects of industrial, sectoral and regional diversification on the banks' return might be different.\n3 Empirical framework\nOur aim is to assess the impact of diversification on banks' profitability in the case of German banks.\nWe address this question by looking at three aspects. First of all, we are interested in the average effect\nof diversification on return. Subsequently, we try to answer the question of whether the link between\nreturn and diversification is consistent with portfolio theory. Finally, we test how monitoring\neffectiveness affects the relationship between diversification and return.\n3.1 Average impact of diversification\nWe investigated the average impact of diversification on banks' performance in a panel regression\nwhere we regressed return on the Hirschman-Herfindahl Indices. More precisely, we estimated the\nfollowing equation.\nRe\nit it it it n nit t it\nn\nturn HT HR HI X z\n      \n=\n= + + + + + +\nwhere Returnit\n, HTit\n, HRit\nand HIit\nare measured as described in the previous section. Xnit\nis the set of\ncontrol.\nvariables such as Personnelit\n,, Sizeit\nand \u00ad for reasons of comparability with other studies \u00ad\nEquityit\n. The error term is given by\nit i it\n  \n= + , where\nt\n represents bank-specific fixed effects and\nit\nis a disturbance term. it\nis iid with mean zero and a constant variance. Moreover, we add a set of\nyear dummy variables,\nt\nz , in order to capture omitted macroeconomic developments. The empirical\nmodel given in equation (1) is estimated using the fixed effects estimation techniques. The coefficients\n ,\n and\n capture the average impact of focus on bank performance, which means that they are\nnot conditioned by the banks' risk levels.\nWe estimate (1) with several restrictions. The results are reported in Table 2.15 In all specifications, the\ncoefficients for the Herfindahl Indices are positive; in most cases they are also highly significant. The\nresults are remarkably stable for the estimations (1a) \u00ad (1d); however, they change when Equityit\nis\nadded to the equation; see specification (1e). In specification (1e), the coefficients for the Herfindahl\nIndices are considerably lower in terms of both absolute magnitude and significance level; at the same\ntime, Equityit\nis highly significant. Hence, the inclusion of Equityit\nreduces the impact of the\nHerfindahl Index on Returnit\n. This is consistent with our assumption that Equityit\nis determined by\nbanks' risk preferences and that the coefficients\n ,\n and\n in (1e) thus no longer reflect the\naverage impact of focus on Returnit\n. Aside from this assumption, the results of all specifications\nconfirm a positive impact of geographical focus at a 1% confidence level and a positive impact of\nsectoral focus at a level of at least 10%. Furthermore, with regard to the magnitude of the coefficients,\nall estimations reveal the same order with HRit\nhaving the highest and HIit\nhaving the lowest\ncoefficient.\nTable 2 Two-way fixed effects estimation of Equation (1) with alternative restrictions\nDependent variable: Returnit\n,\nHTit\nHRit\nHIit\nEquityit\nSizeit\nPersonnelit\nT-values in brackets, *, **, *** denotes significance at 10%, 5% and 1%.\nBlanks indicate that the coefficient of the variable is restricted to zero.\nThe positive coefficients of the Herfindahl Indices can be interpreted as confirmation that (at least on\naverage) the mean profits arising from focusing loan portfolios exceed the mean profits achievable\nthrough diversification. The greatest benefits seem to be attainable through geographical focus,\n15 Due to lack of space the coefficients of the year dummies are not reported with the other estimation results.\nwhereas the benefits from industrial focus appear to be only moderate.\nIn the following subsections, we will analyse whether the results are consistent with portfolio theory\nand/or how the quality of monitoring influences the link between diversification and returns.\n3.2 Consistency with portfolio theory\nPortfolio theory describes the relationship between diversification, expected returns and risk in a liquid\nportfolio. In general, different portfolios display different levels of risk and expected return. Portfolio\ntheory assumes that among all possible portfolios at a certain risk level investors will always select the\none with the highest expected return, which is called risk-return efficient. The efficient portfolios for\ndifferent risk levels constitute an efficient frontier, which displays a positive slope in a risk-return\ndiagram. The positive slope implies that when moving on the efficient frontier there is a trade-off\nbetween risk and expected returns.\nIn our context portfolio theory implies that a bank can change the diversification of its credit portfolio\neither to reach the efficient frontier (and therefore increase risk-return efficiency) or to move along the\nefficient frontier. In order to test which policy is prevalent, we added the variable Riskit\n(measured as\ndescribed above) to Equation (1).\nRe\nit it it it it n nit t it\nn\nturn HT HR HI Risk X z\n       \n=\n= + + + + + + +\nHere, the coefficients 1\ncapture the impact of a variation in focus on return conditioned by\nthe banks' risk level. If all banks operated on the efficient frontier the conditional coefficients 1\n,\nshould be zero because banks with the same risk level should realize the same return on\naverage. In other words, the effects of diversification would be entirely captured by risk. Besides, 4\nshould be positive due to the trade-off between risk and return. If, however, banks did not operate on\nthe efficient frontier, 1\nwould be different from zero and/or 4\nwould be zero or negative.\nThis would imply that banks could use a change in their degree of diversification in order to change\ntheir risk-return profile, i.e. reach the efficient frontier.\nIt should be noted that risk-return efficiency is linked to expected returns. Since expected returns are\nnot observable we have to replace them by observed returns in (2). Deviations of expected returns\nfrom observed returns are captured by it\n, which is assumed to be Gaussian. Furthermore, following\nportfolio theory, Riskit\nis endogenous in HTit\n, HRit\nand HIit\nand exogenous to Returnit\n. Therefore, (1)\ncan be interpreted as the reduced form of (2).\nTable 3 shows the estimated coefficients. Interestingly, conditioning by risk does not change the\nresults from (1) since the conditional coefficients 1\nare almost equal to the average\ncoefficients 1\nin Table 2. At the same time, Riskit\nis significantly negative in specifications\n(2a), (2c) and (2d). In the other specifications, the coefficient for Riskit\nis insignificant. It should be\nnoted that the outcome does not seem to result from a potential multicollinearity between Riskit\nand the\nHerfindahl Indices as 4\nremains stable when the Herfindahl Indices are excluded from Equation (2);\nsee specification (2e). When Equityit\nis added to the equation (see specification (2f)), the coefficients\nof both Riskit\nand the Herfindahl Indices become insignificant. Again, we believe that this finding is\ninduced by the fact that Equityit\ndepends on the banks' risk preferences.\nSince there is no evidence of a positive relationship between risk and return, it appears that banks have\nnot chosen their degree of diversification to operate at a constant risk-return efficiency level. This is\nconfirmed by the non-zero coefficients of the Herfindahl Indices. Banks with highly risky credit\nportfolios were not systematically more profitable than banks with low risk portfolios.\nTable 3 Two-way fixed effects estimation of Equation (2) with alternative restrictions\nDependent variable: Returnit\n,\nHTit\nHRit\nHIit\nRiskit\nEquityit\nSizeit\nPersonnelit\nT-values in brackets, *, **, *** denotes significance at 10%, 5% and 1%.\nBlanks indicate that the coefficient of the variable is restricted to zero.\nTo sum up, the positive Herfindahl Indices in Table 3 indicate that banks with a higher level of focus\ntend to be more profitable than diversified banks and, at the same time, banks with a higher risk level\nseem to be less profitable. Accordingly, instead of operating at a constant risk-return efficiency level,\nbanks appear to have used diversification as an instrument to change their risk-return profiles.\nHowever, note that these interpretations of (2) in the sense of risk-return efficiency only hold under\nthe assumption that the deviations of observed returns from expected returns average out in the time-\nwindow that we consider.\n3.3 Diversification, monitoring effectiveness and returns\nFinally, we analysed how monitoring effectiveness affects the link between diversification and banks'\nreturns. In Winton's (1999) model, effective loan monitoring is the force that prevents banks from\nfailure by catching problem loans before the situation deteriorates too far. Therefore, the monitoring of\nloans allows banks to improve their loan returns and reduce their default probability. When deciding\nwhether to diversify or not, banks take into account the impact of diversification on their incentives to\nmonitor their loans and their probability of failure. Specialised banks which are exposed to sectors\nwith low downside risk will derive only moderate benefits from diversification as they have a low\ndefault probability anyway. Alternatively, in the case of diversified banks with loans of sufficiently\nhigh downside risk, bank owners (equity holders or managers) have only few incentives to monitor as,\non an expected basis, most of the benefits from monitoring will accrue only to the bank's creditors\n(uninsured depositors and providers of borrowed funds) and diversification could actually increase the\nbanks' default probability. Accordingly, the benefits from diversification are greatest if banks' loans\nhave moderate levels of downside risk and if banks' monitoring incentives need to be strengthened.\nIn terms of empirically testable hypotheses, Winton's theory implies that the relationship between\nreturn and focus (or, alternatively, diversification) should be expected to be non-linear and U-shaped\nin risk. To try to capture this, we first of all reproduced the tests proposed by Acharya et al. (2006).\nThey expanded Equation (2) by non-linear terms.\nRe\n* *\n* *\n* *\nit it it it it n nit\nn\nit it it it\nit it it it\nit it it it t it\nturn HT HR HI Risk X\n     \n \n \n   \n=\n= + + + + +\n+ +\n+ +\n+ + + +\n\nBy calculating the first derivative of return on focus, it is easy to see that a U-shape in risk is given if\nThe estimated coefficients (see Table 4) are consistent with the patterns associated with a U-shaped\nform, the only exception being the specification which contains Equityit\n. In all other equations, the\ncoefficients of the Herfindahl Indices interactant with RISKit\nare negative, whereas they are positive\nwhen interactant with RISK\u00b2it\n. Most of the coefficients are significant at a 5% or even at a 1%\nconfidence level. Thus, the results could be interpreted as strong evidence of a U-shaped relationship\nbetween focus and return depending on the level of risk.\nTable 4: Two-way fixed effects estimation of Equation (3) with alternative restrictions\nDependent variable: Returnit\nHTit\nHTit\nHTit\nHRit\nHR it\nHRit\nHIit\nHIit\nHIit\nRiskit\nEquityit\nSizeit\nPersonnelit\nT-values in brackets, *, **, *** denotes significance at 10%, 5% and 1%.\nBlanks indicate that the coefficient of the variable is restricted to zero.\nHowever, to better understand the economic significance of this potential U\u00adshaped relationship,\nFigure 1 plots the marginal effect d(return)/d(focus) for different values of risk for all three types of\ndiversification based on the estimated coefficients from (3b), (3c) and (3d). The range of risk is taken\nto be between 0% and 50%, which represents the minimum and the maximum values over our entire\nsample period. It should be noted that the mean (median) risk is about 3.4% (2.6%), while the 90th\npercentile is about 9%.\nAs can be seen in Figure 1, in our sample a small increase in industrial focus (HIit\n) has a rather minor\nand positive effect on return in the case of the mean (median) bank. For risk levels above 10%, the\neffect becomes slightly negative, but returns to a positive and sharply rising curve at a risk level of\nabout 22% (corresponding to the 99th percentile of risk). Hence, we conclude that, within the range of\nrisk levels observed in our sample, the marginal effect of industrial focus on return might indeed be U-\nshaped.\nFigure 1 The marginal effect of focus on return for different risk values for HT, HR and HI based\non the estimated coefficients from (3b), (3c) and (3d)\nHowever, the result of the graph analysis is different for sectoral and geographical focus (HTit\nand\nHRit\n). Here, an increase in focus also leads to rising returns for banks with risk levels below 12% and\n27% respectively, but then the effect of focus stays negative and decreases for all of the risk levels\nobserved. In fact, the effect becomes positive again only at hypothetical risk levels as high as 110%\nand 160%. Therefore, we suspect that the true impact of sectoral and geographical focus on return\nmight be a linear or, at least, monotonous decrease with risk rather than a U-shaped relationship.\nTo further explore this issue, we have to overcome the drawback of the above test, ie the restrictions\nimposed by the parameterisation of the non-linearities between diversification, risk and return in (3).\nRicher patterns of non-linearity can be detected with non-parametric methods. To this end, we follow\nthe example of Acharya et al. (2006) and define a set of dummy variables which measure different risk\nlevels. The dummy variables are defined as follows:\n Risk[25] and zero otherwise,\n Risk[50] and zero otherwise,\n Risk[75] and zero otherwise,\n Risk[90] and zero otherwise,\n= 1 if Riskit\n Risk[90] and zero otherwise,\nwhere Risk[p] is the pth percentile of Riskit\n. We then interact the dummies with the Herfindahl Indices\nand regress the resulting variables on risk. Hence, our model has the following form:\nNon-monotonicity in Effect of Focus on Bank\nReturns as a Function of Bank Risk\nRisk (Unexpected Loss / Assets)\nEffect of Focus on Return\nHT\nHR\nHI\nit\nt\nit\nk\nkit\nk\nit\nk\nkit\nk\nit\nk\nkit\nk\nn\nnit\nn\nit\nit\nit\nit\nz\nHI\nD\nHR\nD\nHT\nD\nX\nHI\nHR\nHT\nturn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n\n\n\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\nRe\nThe estimation results are shown in Table 5.\nTable 5 Two-way fixed effects estimation of Equation (1) with interaction terms for different risk\nlevels, alternative restrictions, dependent variable: Returnit\nHTit\n*HTit\n*HTit\n*HTit\n*HTit\n*HTit\nHRit\n*HRit\n*HRit\n*HRit\n*HRit\n*HRit\nHIit\n*HIit\n*HIit\n*HIit\n*HIit\n*HIit\nEquityit\nSizeit\nPersonnelit\nT-values in brackets, *, **, *** denotes significance at 10%, 5% and 1%.\nBlanks indicate that the coefficient of the variable is restricted to zero.\nIt should be noted that the coefficients of the Herfindahl Indices which are not interactant with the\ndummy variables capture the impact of focus on return for the group of banks with the lowest risk\nlevel. Therefore, banks with the lowest risk level represent our benchmark group and other coefficients\nhas to be interpreted as a deviation from this benchmark group. The coefficients of the Herfindahl\nIndices which are not interactant are generally positive (again the only exception being the equation\nwhich includes equity) and highly significant. In the specifications where the Herfindahl Indices are\nanalysed separately, the coefficients of sectoral and geographical focus are significantly negative when\ninteractant with the dummies. At the same time, they exhibit a slight decrease in magnitude with rising\nrisk (see (4b) and (4c)). This pattern confirms the hypothesis that the benefits from focus are greater\nfor low-risk banks than for banks with higher levels of risk.\nFurthermore, similar to the parametric analysis above, the overall influence of sectoral and\ngeographical focus on return stays positive for all levels of risk as the absolute magnitude of the\n(negative) coefficients of the terms interactant with the risk dummies is lower than the (positive)\nbaseline coefficient of the respective Herfindahl Index without interaction. However, in the case of\nindustrial focus, the overall impact on return is negative for moderate levels of risk (compare the\ncoefficients for HIit\n*HIit\n*HIit\n*HIit\nin (4d)). Additionally, a U-shaped relationship\nwith return can be detected since the overall impact of industrial focus increases to slightly positive\n(though insignificant) levels for the banks with the greatest risk.\nAlthough these patterns are less pronounced for the estimations (4a) and (4e), in all cases the\ncoefficients reveal evidence of a non-linear relationship between diversification and risk, with a strong\npositive impact of Herfindahl Indices in the case of low-risk banks and a moderate or insignificant\nimpact for higher-risk banks. The less pronounced results for sectoral and geographical diversification\nin specification (4a) as compared with (4b) and (4c) may be attributed to the lower degree of freedom\nin the estimation.\nTo sum up, the dummy variable approach provides strong evidence that the impact of a bank's\nportfolio diversification on its return depends on the bank's risk level. Industrial, sectoral and\ngeographical focus yields the highest benefits when risk is low. The benefits from focus decrease and,\nhence, the benefits from diversification increase with rising risk levels. For industrial focus, the impact\nbecomes insignificant for high risk levels. The findings in Tables 2 and 3, namely that industrial focus,\non average, has a smaller impact on returns than does sectoral and geographical focus, can be\nattributed mostly to banks with moderate risk.\nHowever, it is still difficult to test the hypothesis of a U-shaped form, since the classes which define\nthe dummy variables are fixed heuristically and may be too rough to detect the underlying structure of\nthe relationship between diversification, risk and return. In order to gain a more precise picture of the\nshape of the non-linearities, we performed a second non-parametric procedure. We classified the data\nset according to risk level. We then estimated (1) with a window of 1,000 observations shifting from\nthe lowest risk level to the highest risk level. More precisely, we first of all used a sub-sample of 1,000\nobservations with the lowest risk level to estimate (1), then shifted the sample by one observation and\nrepeated the estimation. The result is a series of roughly 2,500 estimations for\n ,\n and\n of\nEquation (1), which are classified according to the risk level. Plotting the series provides information\nabout the impact of risk on the relationship between focus and return. Figures 2, 3 and 4 represent\nestimations for the specifications (1b), (1c) and (1d).\nAs expected, all of the charts reveal that the coefficients for the Herfindahl Indices (\ni\n ) vary\naccording to the risk level. Although some of the coefficients of the Herfindahl Indices fluctuate\nconsiderably, there is some evidence to suggest that the relationships are either U-shaped or\nmonotonously decreasing. In addition, taken all together, the influences depicted are comparable to\nthose derived using the parametric and dummy variables approaches. Sectoral focus (HTit\n), for\nexample, has a positive coefficient for a low risk level. However, in the case of increasing risk values,\n decreases and becomes slightly (and insignificantly) negative. Therefore, as with the former\napproaches, the effect of sectoral focus on return seems to monotonously decrease with risk.\nFigure 2: Coefficient of HTit\nfor different risk levels (\n in equation (1), specification (1b))\nFigure 3: Coefficient of HRit\nfor different risk levels (\n in Equation (1), specification (1c))\nNumber of Estimation\nNumber of Estimation\nFigure 4: Coefficient of HIit\nfor different risk levels (\n in Equation (1), specification (1d))\nOn the other hand, the coefficient of regional focus (HRit\n) now shows \u00ad in contrast to former results \u00ad\na U-shaped form. It is highly positive for low risk levels, decreases for moderate risk levels (although\nit remains positive) and then rises again for high-risk banks. Finally, industrial focus (HIit\n) has a\npositive coefficient only at low risk levels. For moderate risk levels, it is slightly but significantly\nnegative, while the coefficient becomes insignificantly negative for the highest risk. As such, the\nrolling window approach provides less distinct evidence of a U-shaped relationship between industrial\nfocus and banks' returns than do the above results.\nTo sum up, in order to assess the impact of banks' portfolio diversification or focus on their returns at\ndifferent risk levels, we applied and compared three different approaches. We first of all introduced\nnon-linear terms in the base specification and then applied two non-parametric tests by interacting the\nHerfindahl Indices with dummies for different risk levels and using a rolling window approach for\neach type of diversification. Table 6 goes some way towards summarising the different results.\nTable 6 clearly demonstrates that the benefits from industrial, sectoral and geographical diversification\nsystematically and noticeably vary according to banks' risk levels. Therefore, banks' decisions on\nwhether or not to diversify their loan portfolio should be closely linked to their current risk level.\nMoreover, the type of focus plays a crucial role. According to all three approaches, sectoral focus, for\nexample, is moderately beneficial for low-risk banks, while its influence on return decreases\nmonotonously for higher risk levels. This effect either stays positive for all banks or becomes only\n(insignificantly) negative for rather high risk levels. In the case of geographical focus, however, all of\nthe results indicate a positive effect on return for all risk profiles. However, while the parametric and\ndummy variables approaches reveal a monotonous decline in this positive relationship for higher-risk\nbanks, the rolling window approach clearly depicts a U-shaped form. Furthermore, for industrial\nfocus, we found evidence of a U-shaped link to return, as the results show a positive influence for low\nrisk, a significantly negative impact for moderate risk and almost no effect for very high-risk banks.\nNumber of Estimation\nHence, our analyses at least partly confirm Winton's theory that the diversification benefits are\ngreatest at moderate risk levels.\nTable 6 Comparison of the results of the impact of focus on return for different risk levels\nRisk percentile\nperc.\nperc.\nperc.\nperc.\nperc.\nperc.\nperc.\nperc.\nSectoral focus (HTit\n)\nParametric approach\n(+)**\n(d)\n(+)**\n(d)\n(+)**\n(d)\n(+)**\n(d)\n(+)**\n(d)\n(+)**\n(d)\n(+/-)**\n(d)\n(-)**\n(d)\nDummy var. approach\n(+)*** (+)***\n(d)\n(+)***\n(d)\n(+)***\n(d)\n(+)***\n(d)\n(+)***\n(c)\nRolling window approach\n(see Figure 2)\n(+)#\n(d)\n(+)#\n(d)\n(-)\n(d)\n(-)\n(i)\nGeographical focus (HRit\n)\nParametric approach\n(+)**\n(d)\n(+)**\n(d)\n(+)**\n(d)\n(+)**\n(d)\n(+)**\n(d)\n(+)**\n(d)\n(+)**\n(d)\n(-)**\n(d)\nDummy var. approach\n(+)*** (+)***\n(d)\n(+)***\n(c)\n(+)***\n(d)\n(+)***\n(d)\n(+)***\n(c)\nRolling window approach\n(see Figure 3)\n(+)#\n(d)\n(+)\n(d)\n(+)\n(i)\n(+)#\n(i)\nIndustrial focus (HIit\n)\nParametric approach\n(+)***\n(d)\n(+)***\n(d)\n(+)***\n(d)\n(+)***\n(d)\n(+)***\n(d)\n(+)***\n(d)\n(-)***\n(d/i)\n(+)***\n(i)\nDummy var. approach\n(+)*** (-)***\n(d)\n(-)***\n(i)\n(-)***\n(i)\n(-)\n(d)\n(+)\n(i)\nRolling window approach\n(see Figure 4)\n(+)\n(d)\n(-)\n(d)\n(-)#\n(d)\n(-)\n(i)\nd / i / c indicate a decreasing / increasing / constant level for the respective risk interval.\n*, **, *** denote significance at 10%, 5% and 1%.\n# highlights that the interval +/- 2 does not intersect the x-axis.\n4 Conclusions\nShould banks diversify across different geographical regions and industrial sectors, or should they\nspecialise in a few related fields? In this paper, we tried to shed some light on this question by\nempirically investigating the situation of German banks. By exploiting a unique data set of individual\nbank loan portfolios for the period from 1996 to 2002, we analysed the link between banks'\nprofitability and their portfolio diversification across different industries, broader economic sectors\nand geographical regions. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to study the\neffect of all three types of diversification jointly based on micro-level data on German banks.\nThe relevant academic literature puts forward two conflicting theories concerning the optimum degree\nof diversification. While traditional banking theory based on a delegated monitoring argument (see,\nfor example, Diamond (1984) and Boyd and Prescott (1986)) recommends that the optimum\norganisation of a bank is one where it is as diversified as possible, corporate finance theory suggests\nthat a firm should focus so as to obtain the greatest possible benefit from management's expertise and\nclearly support the latter theory, as the evidence we present indicates that each kind of diversification\ntends to lower German banks' returns, ie focusing generally leads to greater profitability benefits.\nHowever, the impact of all types of diversification on banks' returns changes according to the risk\nlevel. While the effect of sectoral focus on return declines monotonously with increasing risk, there is\nmixed evidence to suggest either a monotonously decreasing or a U-shaped relationship for regional\nfocus as well as a rather distinct indication of a U-shape with respect to industrial focus. Therefore,\nour results at least partly confirm Winton's theory regarding poor monitoring incentives for high-risk\nbanks, which \u00ad in terms of empirically testable hypotheses \u00ad implies that the relationship between\nreturn and focus should be non-linear and U-shaped in risk.\nFurthermore, in our data, diversification improves banks' profitability only in the case of moderate\nrisk levels and industrial diversification. Hence, from a policy point of view, regarding the decision on\nwhether to increase the degree of their industrial, sectoral or geographical diversification banks should\nevaluate carefully the actual riskiness of their activities.\nReferences\nAcharya, V., I.
