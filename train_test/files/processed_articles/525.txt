    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Expanding insurance coverage is designed to improve access to primary care and reduce\nuse of emergency department (ED) services. Whether expanding coverage achieves this is of paramount\nimportance as the United States prepares for the Affordable Care Act.\nObjectives: Emergency and outpatient department use was examined after the State Children's Health\nInsurance Program (CHIP) coverage expansion, focusing on adolescents (a major target group for CHIP)\nversus young adults (not targeted). The hypothesis was that coverage would increase use of outpatient\nservices, and ED use would decrease.\nMethods: Using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital\nAmbulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), the years 1992\u00ad1996 were analyzed as baseline and then\ncompared to use patterns in 1999\u00ad2009, after the CHIP launch. Primary outcomes were population-\nadjusted annual visits to ED versus nonemergency outpatient settings. Interrupted time series were\nperformed on use rates to ED and outpatient departments between adolescents (11 to 18 years old) and\nyoung adults (19 to 29 years old) in the pre-CHIP and CHIP periods. Outpatient-to-ED ratios were\ncalculated and compared across time periods. A stratified analysis by payer and sex was also performed.\nResults: The mean number of outpatient adolescent visits increased by 299 visits per 1,000 persons (95%\nconfidence interval [CI] = 140 to 457), while there was no statistically significant increase in young adult\noutpatient visits across time periods. There was no statistically significant change in the mean number of\nadolescent ED visits across time periods, while young adult ED use increased by 48 visits per 1,000\nConclusions: Since CHIP, adolescent non-ED outpatient visits have increased, while ED visits have\nremained unchanged. In comparison to young adults, expanding insurance coverage to adolescents\nimproved use of health care services and suggests a shift to non-ED settings. Expanding insurance\nthrough the Affordable Care Act of 2010 will likely increase use of outpatient services, but may not\ndecrease ED volumes.\nEmergency Medicine\nProviding health insurance coverage to previously\nuninsured populations is designed to facilitate the\nuse of health care services by minimizing finan-\ncial barriers to accessing care, especially within primary\ncare settings. In addition, the Department of Health and\nHuman Services envisions that enhancing delivery of\nFrom the Department of Emergency Medicine (AH), the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Clinical Scholars Program (AH, SP,\nSD, MMD), the Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases (SP, MMD), the Division of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine\n(SP), the Veterans Affairs Center for Clinical Management Research (SD), and the Department of Internal Medicine and Gerald R.\nFord School of Public Policy (MMD), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.\nPresented at The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Clinical Scholars National Meeting, November 2011; the Society for Academic\nEmergency Medicine Annual Meeting, May 2012; and the Academy Health Annual Academic Research Meeting, June 2012.\nFunded through the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Clinical Scholars Program.

As part of the\nprogram, income-eligibility thresholds were increased for\nchildren in all age groups, with the most notable increases\nseen in adolescents.2 Through streamlined enrollment and\noutreach efforts, the provision of coverage through CHIP\nalong with Medicaid resulted in a decrease in uninsured\nrates among near-poor children.3\u00ad6 Since the implementa-\ntion of CHIP, several state-level analyses have found that\nnewly enrolled children have improved access to a usual\nsource of care and specialty care, as well as preventive care\nvisits, and have also found higher parental satisfaction with\nthe quality of health care services.2,7\u00ad12 However, previous\nstate-level analyses of CHIP and its effect on ED use vary\nbroadly, finding no change,10 to increased use in children\nunder 5 years old,8 to decreased use.7\u00ad9 Analyses using\nnationally representative household surveys found that\nCHIP increased physician outpatient visits and well-child\non ED visits were not examined.2,11\nEmergency department use is an area of major policy\nconcern, given the high costs of ED care overall13 and\nthe potential for newly acquired coverage to lead to\nincreasing numbers of ED visits at the population\nlevel.14 Therefore, we empirically assessed CHIP, the last\nnational program that broadly expanded insurance cov-\nerage, and its effect on ED and non-ED use, as a natural\nexperiment. Although CHIP was more narrowly targeted\nin its coverage efforts than the Affordable Care Act, it\nwas similarly directed to provide coverage to populations\npredominantly unserved by the private and public cover-\nage options available at the time of its enactment.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design\nThis was a retrospective cohort analysis of ambulatory\nvisits, including ED and non-ED outpatient settings,\nusing data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care\nSurvey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory\nMedical Care Survey (NHAMCS). The National Center\nfor Health Statistics (NCHS) compiles both surveys to\nprovide comprehensive and nationally representative\ndata sources regarding ambulatory care use. They are\nannual cross-sectional surveys using nationally repre-\nsentative probability samples of physician visits to non-\nfederal clinics and short-stay hospitals.15\nED and Non-ED Outpatient Visits\nThe NAMCS provides a sample of office-based visits to\nprivate physicians and community health centers, while\nthe NHAMCS includes visits to hospital-based outpatient\ndepartments and EDs. According to the NCHS, visits\nprioritized for data collection are those where direct\npatient care is delivered. ED visits and outpatient visits\npermitting assessment of years of use patterns prior to\nwere used to establish a baseline utilization trend prior\nto the CHIP legislation, which was then compared with\nexcluded from analysis.\nData from NAMCS and NHAMCS can be used for\ncalculation of national estimates,16,17 based on weights\nfrom the NCHS that take into account nonresponse, the\nprobability of being sampled, and a ratio adjustment for\nphysicians within the specialty groups. For visits to ED\nand hospital-based outpatient departments (i.e., primary\ncare or subspecialty care settings within hospitals) in\nthe NHAMCS survey, similar weights are available that\nadditionally account for the number of hospitals within\nthe region and annual volume of hospital visits. Accord-\ning to our institutional review board, our study did not\nrequire approval, as the data used are publicly available\nand de-identified to prevent linking of information\ndirectly to individual patients.\nMeasures\nThe primary study outcomes were population-adjusted\nannual visit rates to EDs versus nonemergency outpa-\ntient settings, generated from NAMCS and NHAMCS\nvisit frequencies divided by annual national population\nestimates by age group from the U.S. Census Bureau\nCurrent Population Survey. Outpatient visits were\ndefined as a pooled sample (NAMCS + NHAMCS) of\nvisits to private physician offices, community health cen-\nters, and hospital-based outpatient departments.\nOur population of primary interest was adolescents,\ndefined here as 11 to 18 years old, based on the Guide-\nlines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS),18 and\naccounting for age-eligibility criteria for CHIP cover-\nage.19 Previous studies highlighted high rates of unin-\nsured adolescents20 prior to the CHIP legislation,\nparticularly among the poor (<100% of the federal pov-\npoverty level).21 Several other investigators highlighted\ntrends of underuse of primary care services for this age\ngroup,22,23 and therefore our analysis was focused pri-\nmarily on the effect of CHIP on adolescents' trends in\nuse of health care services.\nFor purposes of comparison, trends of adolescent\nambulatory care use were compared with those of young\nadults 19 to 29 years old. We considered young adults an\nideal comparison group to assess for secular trends, as\nthis age group is similar to adolescents in terms of general\nhealth and insurance coverage in the pre-CHIP period, yet\nwas not a primary target for coverage under CHIP.24 The\nauthors note here that a small group of states used federal\nfunds allotted under CHIP to cover childless adults, but\nthe small size of these initiatives related to CHIP overall is\nnot expected to affect the analysis and would, after all,\nbias toward finding no difference between adolescent and\nyoung adult health care use patterns.\nData Analysis\nOur analysis includes descriptive statistics of weighted\nvisits reflecting national estimates by care setting, as\nwell as a summary of demographics across time peri-\nods. To assess the effect of CHIP policy on trends of\nhealth care use, we performed segmented time-series\nanalyses25 on use rates of adolescents and young adults\nto ED and outpatient settings in the pre-CHIP (1992 to\nFor the 1992 data set, a weighted estimate variable does\nnot exist for the NAMCS data set, and therefore this\nyear was excluded from our analyses of the total\nnational outpatient visit estimates and time-series\nanalyses (but included for ED analyses, available from\nNHAMCS data).\nIn addition, we sought to analyze how outpatient use\ncompares with ED use on a population level. We calcu-\nlated a ratio of outpatient-to-ED visits to assess the rela-\ntionship of change in annual visits between the two\nambulatory settings, as an informative composite mea-\nsure of ED and outpatient visits over the pre-CHIP and\nCHIP implementation time periods.\nWe also calculated the difference between the adoles-\ncent and young adult annual visits within the ED and\nnon-ED outpatient settings for the pre-CHIP and CHIP\nimplementation periods. This difference-in-difference\nanalysis allowed us to control for secular trends in the\nuse of medical services, comparing adolescents\nexpected to benefit as a group from an expansion of\ncoverage versus young adults not targeted by CHIP.\nFinally, we performed a stratified analysis of trends in\nED and outpatient use by payer and sex.\nLinear regression was used to assess the statistical\nsignificance in the change from the pre-CHIP and CHIP\nimplementation time periods for all primary outcomes:\nmean number of annual visits, mean ratio of outpatient-\nto-ED visits, and difference-in-difference rates. All\nanalyses were performed using Stata 12.0 (StataCorp,\nCollege Station, TX), incorporating the complex multi-\nstage sampling design and survey weighting estimates\nof the NAMCS and NHAMCS survey data.\nRESULTS\nPatterns of Visits in Pre-CHIP Versus CHIP Periods\nafter implementation. Annual outpatient visits changed\nperiods. The proportion of uninsured adolescent visits\ndecreased from 15% to 6%. Adolescent visits with Med-\nicaid/CHIP coverage increased from 18% to 24%\n(Table 1).\nIn contrast, young adults made approximately 429 ED\nduring CHIP implementation. For outpatient visits, there\nperiods, the proportion of young adult visits where the\npatient was uninsured changed from 17 to 14, and visits\nwith Medicaid/CHIP coverage changed from 18 to 19.\nAmong adolescents, the mean number of population-\nadjusted outpatient visits increased by 299 visits per\nCharacteristics of Adolescent and Adult Emergency and Nonemergency Outpatient Visits\nVisit Characteristics\nWeighted visits per 1,000 persons in the population\nAnnual mean non-ED\noutpatient* visits (SD)\nSex (%)\nRace/ethnicity (%)\nInsurance (%)\nTotal visits are weighted and adjusted for population using the U.S. Census Bureau annual estimates of resident population,\nthen rounded to nearest tenth; demographics for sex and payer have been rounded to nearest whole number.\nCHIP=Children's Health Insurance Program.\n*Outpatient visits may be underestimated due to absence of the weighting variable in the NAMCS data set for 1992.

These summary comparisons highlight\nthe diverging health care utilization patterns among\nadolescents versus young adults with the implementa-\ntion of CHIP.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we sought to evaluate the effect of CHIP on\nuse of primary, outpatient specialty care, and ED ser-\nvices to illustrate the changing demands on the ambula-\ntory health care system during an era of health care\ncoverage reform. Prior to original CHIP legislation,\nNewacheck and colleagues26 demonstrated the now-\nfamiliar observation that insured children were more\nlikely to have contact with physicians, a usual source\ncare, access to after-hours care, and less unmet need\nversus uninsured peers. Similarly, in another analysis\nusing the National Health Interview Survey, Lieu et al.27\nfound that adolescents with public and private insurance\nhad higher numbers of visits for routine care, and a\nFigure 1.

Consistent with our study findings, other\ninvestigators have found that doctor visits for nonemer-\ngency health care among older children (6 to 17 years\nof age) have increased since expanding children's health\ncare coverage through CHIP.2 Kenney's analysis of\nCHIP's effects across 10 states also found that enrolled\nchildren were more likely to have improved access to\nprivate physician offices as their usual source of care.9\nOur study builds on this prior work by using a differ-\nent national data source over more years, including the\npre-CHIP era, and dual investigation of the outpatient\nand ED settings. The relatively unchanging volume of\nED visits for adolescents after CHIP implementation in\nour study is consistent with an analysis of the New York\nCHIP program, which did not find a difference in use of\nacute care and emergency services one year after\nenrollment.10 In contrast, a separate 1-year assessment\nof newly enrolled children in a North Carolina CHIP\nprogram found an 11% increase in parents reporting\nuse of private physicians for acute care and a decrease\nin ED visits for older children ages 6 to 18 years whose\nonly access to the health system or acute care services\nwas the ED.8 One of the salient aspects of our analysis\nis that it is essential to consider that the effect of health\ncare reform on altering patterns of use requires time to\nmaterialize, and that 1 year is not sufficient to capture\nthese downstream effects. Therefore, our study adds to\nthe existing literature by providing insight into the\nimplications of health care reform on ED trends over a\nmore extended time period, aggregated at the national\nlevel.\nOur results also contribute to the growing, mixed\nliterature regarding ED patterns after health care cover-\nage expansions. An analysis of Massachusetts' 2006\nhealth care reform policy on nonelderly adult ED use at\n11 institutions found that the volume of ED visits did\nnot decrease after implementation of near universal\nhealth insurance coverage.28 In a separate study,\nMiller29 performed a county-level analysis of ED visits\nto all hospitals in Massachusetts over the years 2002\nthrough 2008 and compared them with visits in Rhode\nIsland, Vermont, Connecticut, and New Jersey. There\nwas no comparative reduction in overall ED visits in\nMassachusetts when comparing utilization trends\nacross time periods or between states. In the recent\nOregon health insurance experiment, there was a 35%\nincrease in use of outpatient care without a significant\ndifference in ED use among newly enrolled Medicaid\npatients.30,31 Meanwhile, an annual survey of nonelderly\nMassachusetts adults initiated prior to health reform\nimplementation noted a decrease in reported ED use in\nerature to date, which is that decreasing ED visit vol-\numes--promoted by some as a benefit of coverage\nexpansions--may not be realized among populations\nthat experience new coverage.\nED volume is an important metric, but is only one of\nseveral factors that must be taken into account when\nassessing the effects of future health reform initiatives.\nTo better understand the effects of health care reform\non demand for ED versus outpatient services, it will be\nFigure 3.

For example, in one study,\nalthough a reduction in overall ED visits was not\nobserved, geographic areas with greater increases in\ninsurance coverage after reform had the largest\ndecrease in ED visits for conditions classified as nonur-\ngent, primary care\u00adtreatable, and primary care\u00adprevent-\nable, along with an increase in ED visits for\nnonpreventable emergencies.29 These findings suggest\nthat even though ED visits did not decrease in aggre-\ngate, the manner in which patients access emergency\nservices may change. In future studies, we plan to focus\non such granular detail to allow for a better under-\nstanding of the demands for ED and non-ED health\ncare services.\nOur findings suggest that expanding insurance cover-\nage to adolescents improved access to health care ser-\nvices and shifted use to non-ED settings. Comparisons\nwith young adults, a group not targeted by national\ncoverage initiatives during this same time period,\ndemonstrated their increasing use of ED services, while\nvisits to outpatient departments remained relatively flat.\nThis comparison underscores the importance of the\nprovision of affordable health insurance in facilitating\naccess to outpatient health care services overall. With\nregard to the trend of increasing ED use for young\nadults over time, it is important to consider that this\npopulation may have a higher demand for acute medical\ncare compared to adolescents. Other investigators have\nfound that young adults (20 to 29 years of age) were\nmore likely than children (0 to 18 years of age) to be\nseen in the ED for injuries, as well as for noninjury\nLIMITATIONS\nOur analysis uses CHIP as a natural experiment to\nassess the policy effects of prior national initiatives to\nexpand health insurance on subsequent use of health\ncare services. In such an observational study, we are\nunable to control for potential confounders such as\nother secular trends, including the changing influence\nof health care management organizations or new pedi-\natric guidelines during this time period, which may be\nassociated with health care use patterns. Therefore, in\nan effort to reveal potential secular trends, we felt it\nwas important to include the young adults as a control.\nWe considered the young adult age group to be an\nappropriate control group due to their similarities to\nadolescents. Persons in the third decade of life are tradi-\ntionally healthy and therefore not expected to require\nfrequent health care visits for chronic disease manage-\nment. They are also similar to adolescents because they\noften interface with health care systems for primarily\nacute care needs such as injuries. We do, however, rec-\nognize that adolescents and young adults may not\nmatch as well regarding access to motor vehicles, as\nwell as drugs and alcohol. Increased access to these fac-\ntors could contribute to greater risk for injury in the\nyoung adult population and increased likelihood to seek\nED services.\nIn addition, as an ecologic study using visit-level\naggregate data, we are unable to examine individual-\nlevel variation. Therefore, we are unable to attribute\nthese trends to individual health care\u00adseeking behav-\niors. Visit-level data are useful in assessing overall\ndemand for medical services, but do not allow us the\nability to determine whether the trends observed are\nfrom one person who visited several times or several\npersons who visited once. Therefore, in an effort to\nassess the validity of our results, we also performed\nanalyses of utilization trends by payer and sex.\nAnother important consideration is the limited num-\nber of years in the pre-CHIP baseline time period. We\nsought to capture simultaneous trends in ambulatory\ncare use at the population level; however, the sur-\nvey years that include both ED and outpatient visits\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study highlights the association of the Children's\nHealth Insurance Program with national patterns of\nambulatory health care utilization. We found in the Chil-\ndren's Health Insurance Program target population that\nuse of outpatient services increased, while ED volumes\ndid not decrease over time. In this context, the outpa-\ntient-to-ED ratio may be an informative measure for\ngauging the overall effect of future coverage initiatives\non both ED and non-ED outpatient use.\nUnderstanding population demand for ambulatory\ncare services and trends related to where patients opt\nto seek care can inform interventions to improve coor-\ndination and use of health care services. It may also\nhighlight persistent disparities or barriers that limit use\nof primary and preventive care services and contribute\nto overreliance on ED services. Developing a better\nunderstanding of patient decision-making and prefer-\nences in changing circumstances of individual coverage\nmay inform development of patient-centered interven-\ntions to address the increasing demand for acute care\nservices at the population level with national coverage\nexpansion. Our findings have particular relevance as\nour country prepares for a large-scale expansion of\nhealth care coverage. As the implementation of the\nAffordable Care Act moves forward, it will be vital to\ndevelop a comprehensive understanding of how these\npolicies affect use of health care services in ED and\nnon-ED outpatient settings.\nDrs.
