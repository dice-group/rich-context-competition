This made\nlarge parts of banks' assets marketable and enhanced outsiders ability to assess the value\nof perviously opaque bank loans. Moreover, a well established secondary market for loans\nprovides banks' capital owners with an ecient way to liquidate bank loans. For bank\nmanagers, however, this means that their specic knowledge about the true value of each\nindividual loan and how to ensure full repayment becomes less important. This reduced\nthe rent that bank managers can realize with a hold-up.\nFor the stability of an individual bank this has two opposing eects, which this paper\ncontrasts in a theoretical model. On the one hand the principal-agent problem between\nbank owners and the bank manager aects the optimal capital structure of a bank. Fol-\nlowing the ndings of Diamond and Rajan (2000) the more severe the hold-up problem\nis, the larger will bank owners set the fraction of deposits relative to equity in order to\ndiscipline the manager. If nancial innovations attenuate the principal-agent problem, the\noptimal equity ratio increases, which improves the bank's resilience to exogenous shocks\nand thereby increases its stability. On the other hand a decline in the rent that the bank\nmanager can realize reduces his incentives to invest eort in the screening of loan appli-\ncants and in the monitoring of borrowers. Thus the quality of the loan portfolio declines\nincreasing the default probability of an individual bank.\nSince capital owners cannot credibly commit to compensate the manager for the re-\nduction in his rent, they cannot oset the negative incentive eect and ensure ecient\nscreening and monitoring. Thus there is no way to countervail the aggravating moral\nhazard of the bank manager and thereby eliminate its destabilizing eect. Consequently,\nimproved access to loan securitization might ultimately lead to more fragile banks, even\nthough the reduction of the hold-up problem leads to a safer capital structure.\nNicht technische Zusammenfassung\nIn den letzten Jahren verbesserten sich die M\u00f6glichkeiten der Banken, Kredite zu ver-\nbriefen, deutlich.

F\u00fcr\neinen Bankmanager hat dies zur Folge, dass sein spezisches Wissen \u00fcber die Werthaltigkeit\nbestimmter Kredite an Bedeutung verliert. Dies reduziert seine M\u00f6glichkeiten durch einen\nHold-Up eine Rente abzusch\u00f6pfen.\nF\u00fcr die Stabilit\u00e4t einzelner Kreditinstitute hat dies zwei gegenl\u00e4uge Eekte, die\ndas vorliegende Papier im Rahmen eines theoretischen Modells untersucht. Einerseits\nwird durch die Bedeutung des Prinzipal-Agenten-Koniktes zwischen Kapitalgebern und\nBankmanager die optimale Kapitalstruktur einer Bank beeinusst. Je gravierender die\nKapitalgeber das Hold-Up Problem einsch\u00e4tzen, umso st\u00e4rker werden sie zur Diszipli-\nnierung des Bankmanagements auf eine Finanzierung durch Einlagen dr\u00e4ngen.

By threatening to quit and renegotiating their compensation, managers can extract\na part of their value added. This reduces the willingness of nanciers to provide funds to\nthe bank and may lead to worthwhile projects not being undertaken.\nDemandable deposits from multiple investors allow the hold-up problem to be reduced.\nAny attempt to renegotiate with depositors would immediately trigger a bank run, as\ndepositors fear a reduction in their repayments. However, in contrast to equity, deposit\nnancing runs the risk of inecient liquidations, because it causes runs when bad luck\nleads to asset returns that are insucient to repay deposits in full. The optimal capital\nstructure trades o these two eects.\nIn recent decades, new technologies have signicantly improved the availability of rm-\nspecic information. This has reduced private information in relationship lending. The\nemergence of credit derivatives, in particular, has led to the accurate pricing of credit\nrisks on a variety of exposures. Hence, the specic knowledge that bank managers accu-\nmulate in the lending process provides less of an advantage over investors who are not\nclosely involved in the lending. At the same time, greater information availability and\n1This argument is central to recent theories of banking, see, for example, Calomiris and Kahn (1991),\nnancial innovations have boosted securitization, such as through asset-backed securities\nand collateralized loan obligations. As a result, the tradability of bank credit has in-\ncreased. Taken together, these changes in the nancial system have improved the value of\nbank assets to outsiders. Therefore, managers' ability to take advantage of their acquired\nknowledge has fallen.\nConsequently, there is less need for adopting a fragile capital structure in order to\ndiscipline the management. This is consistent with the decline in the importance of\ndemandable deposit nancing in recent years. For example, their share of total liabilities\nat U.S. commercial banks has fallen from 21% to 8% over the last 15 years. The resilience\nof banks to adverse return shocks should, therefore, improve.\nHowever, bank managers' rents also serve as an incentive device for providing eort in\nthe monitoring and screening of borrowers. The improved marketability of bank assets,\nand the resulting mitigation of the hold-up problem, reduce this rent. Due to the very\nreason for the existence of the hold-up problem -the diculty of verifying managerial\nperformance in banks- this reduction cannot be easily oset through explicit compensation\nschemes, such as equity or options. Managerial incentives for achieving high returns\nmay decline, with the consequence that the quality of bank assets deteriorates. This\nundermines banking stability.\nTaking these eects together, this paper argues that even though the improved mar-\nketability of bank assets might cause banks to adopt a safer capital structure, the stability\nof the banking sector is not necessarily enhanced, and may even decline. This is because\nbetter marketability also undermines managerial incentives and may thus lead to a dete-\nrioration in banks' asset quality, with adverse consequences for bank risk. The worsening\nof the incentives also has a negative eect on the overall attractiveness of bank nancing,\nas their raison d'\u00eatre is the ability to monitor and screen borrowers.\nIn the remainder of this section, we briey discuss related literature. In the next\nsection we present a model where banks optimally use deposits to mitigate a renegotiation\nproblem and where asset quality depends on managerial eort. In Section 3 we carry out\na comparative static analysis for changes in the marketability of bank assets. Conclusions\nfollow.\nRelated literature\nThe analysis is based on recent banking theory which has emphasized the diculty of dis-\nciplining bank managers and the merits of deposits in alleviating the ensuing problems.\nAlthough disciplining managers is an issue for all companies, the problem is thought\nto be more pronounced in the banking context because the private information con-\ntained in bank loans makes common compensation schemes, such as options, less eec-\ntive. Calomiris and Kahn (1991) show that demandable deposits can be used to mitigate\nincentive problems by providing informed investors with an incentive to monitor bank\nmanagers. In Flannery (1994), short-term debt requires banks to come regularly to the\nmarket to raise funds and thus has a disciplining eort on managerial behavior. Our\noped a framework where deposits reduce managerial rents. As in the present paper, these\nrents arise from bank managers' ability to use their specic knowledge to renegotiate their\ncompensation.\nOur argument that an improvement in the hold-up problem may have adverse incentive\neects relates to contributions which, following Grossman and Hart (1984), have shown\nthat the ex-post allocation of property rights aects incentives ex-ante. In an application\nto the bank-rm relationship, Rajan (1992) shows that due to the information gained\nin the nancing process, a bank can ex-post threat to liquidate even good projects in\norder to extract the surplus from the entrepreneur. As this is anticipated, entrepreneurial\nincentives are worsened (in contrast to the present paper, improvements in information\navailability would be benecial in Rajan's setting, as it makes it easier for a rm to\nswitch to other sources of nancing if faced with the bank's liquidation threat). A related\nargument is made in the context of equity nancing by Burkhart, Gromb and Panunzi\n(1997), who argue that creating ownership structures which exercise tight control over\nmanagers may be detrimental, by reducing managers' initiative.\nTypically, a decline in the private information contained in bank loans and the resulting\nimprovement in the liquidity of bank assets are viewed as benecial (for example, because\nthey allow for better diversication at banks). Nevertheless, several studies have also\npointed to potential costs. In Myers and Rajan (1995), asset liquidity is undesirable\nas it increases the manager's ability to trade assets against the interest of the owners.\nCordella and Yeyati (1998) show that when investors are less informed about bank assets,\nbanks may be more stable because interest rates are then less sensitive in risky states. In\nWagner (2006), an increase in asset liquidity induces managers to switch to still illiquid\nbut inecient assests. The present paper diers from these contributions in that adverse\neects from an improved liquidity arise through its impact on bank managers' incentives\nfor achieving high returns.2\n2 The model\nThe economy lasts for two periods (t = 1, 2) and there are two types of agents: bank\nmanagers and investors. All agents are risk neutral and only care about consumption in\nBank managers have no initial endowment but each of them has access to an investment\nproject. This investment project requires a xed investment of $1 in t = 1 and matures in\n2Our paper also relates to the discussion on information disclosure and transparency as both should\nincrease the marketability of assets. For example, in Chen and Hasan (2006), higher transparency of\nbanks can also reduce welfare by increasing the chance of contagious runs.\nt = 2. If a bank manager makes the eort to monitor the project (e = 1) and completes\nthe project, the date 2 return of the project ~\nc is uniformly distributed in [cmin\n, cmax\n]\n(cmax\n> cmin) and hence has a density of (c) = 1/(cmax\n- cmin\n) = . If he does not make\nthe eort to monitor (e = 0), the project's return upon completion is lowered by c > 0,\ni.e., ~\nc is uniformly distributed in [cmin\n- c, cmax\n- c]. Exercising the eort causes a\nxed disutility G > 0 to the manager. We assume that eort is worthwhile, i.e.\nEort is taken as unobservable and is hence not contractible.\nInvestors are each endowed with one unit of funds in t = 1. They are inferior users\nof the project. Hence, if they complete the project they can only extract a fraction \n(0   < 1) of its return ~\nc in t = 2. If, for whatever reason, they force the premature\nliquidation of the project (i.e., the project is not completed), the project's value is  with\n < (cmin\n-c) (i.e., the value of the project always falls if it is prematurely liquidated).\nWe assume that funds are scarce, that is there are more bank managers than en-\ntrepreneurs in the economy. This implies that, in order to have a chance of being nanced,\nbank managers have to promise the maximum possible return to investors in t = 2. How-\never, their ability to do so credibly is limited because the project's return ~\nc can not be\nveried.\nThe uncertainty about the project's return (~\nc) is revealed at the beginning of date\n2. Afterwards (and before completion of the project), a hold-up problem arises because\na bank's manager can threaten to withdraw from the project. Suppose that the bank is\nfully nanced by equity. Assuming that he has full bargaining power, the bank manager\ncan then negotiate down any initial claim equity may have to c, as this is equity's outside\noption from replacing the banker and completing the project itself. Hence, for a given\neort choice e (e = 0, 1), the maximum return W(e) that the bank manager can pledge\nto investors is only\nW(e) =\ncmax(e)\ncmin(e)\nwhere cmin\n(0) := cmin\n- c, cmax\n(0) := cmax\n- c and cmin\n(1) := cmin, cmax\n(1) := cmax.\nDemandable deposits can solve this renegotiation problem. Because a depositor can\nreclaim his deposits at face value by withdrawing immediately, any incentive to enter into\nrenegotiations is eliminated. Moreover, a depositor must fear that others will withdraw\ninstead of participating in the renegotiation so that he can no longer be paid in full. Thus,\ntrying to renegotiate with depositors immediately triggers a run, causing the liquidation\nof the investment project and leaving the bank manager with no return. Deposit nancing\nthus allows the bank manager to refrain credibly from renegotiating and to commit to\npay out depositors in full, if feasible. As a result, the bank's pledgeable return increases.\nHowever, deposits also entail costs because they cause a run when the project's return\nis low and depositors cannot be paid in full. Thus, there is a trade-o. On the one hand,\nincreasing deposits implies higher payouts to investors for when returns are suciently\nhigh to repay depositors. On the other hand, a higher level of deposits raises the probabil-\nity that the bank cannot meet the promised repayment to depositors. Since the resulting\nrun causes liquidation of the project, this reduces investors' return.\nMore formally, if the bank manager promises a repayment D on deposits, depositors\ncan be paid in full if D  ~\nc. If D > ~\nc, they can only realize the liquidation value  because\nthere is then a run. Hence, the pledgeable return in a deposit nanced bank is\nW(e) =\nD\ncmin(e)\ndc +\ncmax(e)\nD\nThe optimal choice of nancing (in terms of maximizing the pledgeable income) will\ngenerally entail both deposits and equity. This is because raising equity besides deposits\nis benecial for when there are high realizations of c. Equity's threat from completing\nthe project itself may then exceed the level of deposits, allowing further payments to be\nextracted from the bank manager. The pledgeable return from a mixed capital structure\nwith a level of deposits D is hence\nW(e) =\nD\ncmin\n(e)\ndc +\nD/\nD\nDdc +\ncmax(e)\nD/\nwhere the dierence to (3) arises because when c > D/, equity's threat c is larger than\nthe level of deposits D. In these cases, the bank manager can be forced to pay out c > D\nto investors (of which D will go to depositors and c - D to equity).\nThe timing in our economy can be summarized as follows\n1. Capital structure is chosen\n2. Bank manager chooses eort\n1. Uncertainty about project's return (c) is revealed\n2. Bank manager renegotiates and bank owners may decide to run the\nproject themselves\n3. Depositors and equity are paid; if depositors cannot be repaid, there\nis a run and the project is liquidated\n4. Project matures if it has not been liquidated before\nSince bank managers are in competition for funds, they have to choose the capital\nstructure which maximizes the pledgeable return to investors, because otherwise their\nchances of obtaining nancing are zero. Hence, bank managers set D in (4) in order to\nmaximize W(e). Solving the FOC wrt. D, it follows that the equilibrium level of deposits\nD fullls\nD/\nD\ndc = (D - ) (5)\nRearranging, this yields\nD =\n\nWe restrict the subsequent analysis to cases where banks optimally choose a risky\ncapital structure. This is the case when D > cmin\n(e), implying that for suciently low\nreturn realizations there will be bank runs. Furthermore, we also require banks to raise\nsome funds through equity. Therefore, we assume cmax\n(e) > D, i.e., for the highest\nreturn realization equity's threat exceeds the level of deposits. Using (6) these conditions\ncan written as\n(e)\n>  >\n/cmax\nConsequently we have\nLemma 1 For parameter values determined by (7), banks choose a mixed capital structure\nwith equity and deposits and there is a positive probability of a run.\nWe study next the bank manager's eort choice, which will depend on his rents. When\nc < D, there is a run and hence the bank manager obtains no rent. When c  D, his\nrents depend on equity's threat. When c < D, equities' threat is below the level of\ndeposits and the bank manager obtains c - D. By contrast, when c  D, his payout\nis determined by equity's threat and his rent amounts to (1 - )c. Thus, the manager's\nexpected rent is\nR(e) =\nD/\nD\n(c - D)dc +\ncmax(e)\nD/\nGiven that eort is not contractible, the bank manager only monitors if the additional rent\nobtained from monitoring at least compensates the eort disutility. Thus, in equilibrium\nthere is monitoring (e = 1) if\nand otherwise there is no monitoring (e = 0).\nWe dene the eciency E of the banking system as the sum of the expected payos of\ninvestors and bank managers. From (4) and (8) we have that for when eort is exercised\ncmax\n(1) + cmin\n-\nD\ni.e., total pay-os consist of the expected return on the project if it were never liquidated,\n(cmax\n(1) + cmin\n(1))/2, minus the expected losses from liquidation due to runs, D\n(c -\n)dc, minus the eort costs G. When eort is not exercised, we have\ncmax\n(0) + cmin\n-\nD\nNote that for given D we have E(1) - E(0) > 0 because of the assumption that eort is\nworthwhile (c > G).\nBesides eciency, we are also interested in the stability of the banking system, which\nwill have repercussions when there are externalities from banking failure. We dene the\nstability of the banking sector by the probability  of banking default,3 which is given by\n(e) =\nD\ncmin(e)\n3 Comparative static analysis\nAn improved tradability of bank assets allows bank owners to sell assets to third parties\nmore easily. Furthermore, reductions in the privateness of the information gained by\nthe manager in the lending process lower the eciency losses which arise if the project is\ncompleted without the bank manager. Therefore, in our model an improved marketability\nof bank assets is reected in an increase in , the value of bank assets to outsiders. We\nrst analyze the consequences of a higher  for a given eort choice and then turn to the\nimplications for eort.\nA higher  has the eect of allowing equity to extract a higher fraction of the projects'\nreturns in states where equity's threat exceeds the repayments on deposits (c > D).\nTherefore, the return that can be pledged to investors increases, which can also be veried\n3Our comparative static results also hold for the Loss Given Default (LGD), which is an alternative\nmeasure of the externalities associated with banking failure.\nby dierentiating (4) with respect to \nW(e)\n\n=\ncmax(e)\nD/\nBecause equity holders can now enforce repayment more eciently, the increase in  also\nlowers the relative merits of deposits. From (6) we have, consequently, that deposit taking\nis reduced\nD () = -\n\nIt is easy to see from (10) and (11) that this decline in deposit nancing increases the\neciency of bank nancing, which is because it reduces the incidence of costly runs.\nFurthermore, it also lowers banks' probability of failure (from (12)).\nSummarizing, we hence have\nProposition 1 For given eort, the improved marketability of bank assets induces a less\nfragile capital structure of banks and thereby enhances bank stability and eciency.\nHowever, higher marketability also has an eect on the manager's incentives to exercise\neort. This is because the rents he derives for high project returns are lowered, as equity\ncan extract larger payments in these situations. Therefore, his gains from exercising eort\nare reduced.\nFrom (9) it can be appreciated that there is a critical level 0 (0\n< 1), dened through\ncmax\ncmax- c\nat which a further improvement in the marketability of bank assets reduces the manager's\ngain from monitoring below the eort costs G (note that for  = 1, his additional rents\nwould be zero). Thus, if  > 0, eort can no longer be induced. Intuitively, this is\nbecause there are then no means available for the manager to promise credibly sucient\nrents for good performance of the project.\nThe manager can also not be easily guaranteed rents through other schemes, such as for\nexample equity or options. Capital could always, after replacing the manager, renegotiate\nwith the manager (or simply dilute his equity stake). Since after his replacement the\nmanager's outside option is zero, equity would still be able to extract c. Eectively, the\nhold-up problem would then be reversed, preventing capital from promising additional\nrents to the manager.\nThus, if equity were issued to the manager, this would simply by compensated in\nthe original renegotiation (that is, before replacement of the manager) through a higher\npay-out per unit of equity. Suppose for example that the manager has a share of  in\nequity. Capital's pay-o is then (1 - )p, where p is the pay-o the manager does per\nunit of equity. Since capital's outside option is still c, it can force the manager to pay\nout (1 - )p = c. Thus, the pay-outs per unit of equity increase with the manager's\nstake in order for the total pay-out to be constant.4\nAt  = 0, a further increase in  thus causes the manager to stop monitoring. As\nthis reduces the return on the project, the pledgeable income falls\ncmin\ncmin-c\ndc -\ncmax\ncmax-c\nThere is no impact on the bank's capital structure, D, as eort neither aects the\nmarginal benets nor the marginal costs of deposit taking (equation 5).5 Bank stabil-\nity therefore declines, since the loss of eort implies that there are more low states at\nwhich bank runs occur ((0) - (1) > 0 from (12)). Moreover, as eort is assumed to be\n4A possibility to induce eort, though, would be not to have equity at all. However, the resulting\ndecline in pledgeable income may exceed the eort loss, and thus not allow for the project to be nanced\n(this will always be the case, for example, when eort is not very productive (i.e., for small c)).\n5This independence result is sensitive to our assumption that eort only aects the upper and the\nlower limits of the distribution but leaves the density (c) of a given return realization c constant. If this\nis not the case, then the loss of eort may have an eect on the capital structure through its eect on\nthe densities in (5).\nproductive, there is also a reduction in the eciency of bank nancing (E(0) - E(1) < 0\nfrom (10) and (11)). An increase beyond 0 may thus also cause disintermediation, as due\nto the loss of managerial eort (and hence the screening and monitoring of borrowers),\narms-length nancing may start to dominate bank nancing.\nSummarizing, we have\nProposition 2 The improved marketability of bank assets reduces bank managers' incen-\ntives to generate high returns and thus eventually lowers eort. This causes a reduction\nin the pledgeable income and leads to a decline in both the stability and the eciency of\nthe banking system.\nFigures 1 and 2 summarize the eects of an improved marketability of bank assets.\nFigure 1: The pledgeable return as a function of asset marketability\n- \nW\n^\n\nW\n^\n^\n\nFigure 1 shows the impact on banks' pledgeable incomes. For very low market values\nof bank assets  <  (where  is implicitly dened by D() = cmax(1), i.e.,  =\n+1)/2 from rearranging (6)), there is no equity since its payo would be zero as\nD > c for all c. The bank's pledgeable return is then not aected by . If the market\nvalue of bank assets is somewhat higher ( <  < 0), the bank manager also pays out\nto equity. Pledgeable income then increases in , as a higher  allows equity to extract\nmore from the bank manager. Since the market value is still rather low, equity holders\ndo not extract much of the banks' returns, leaving the bank managers with sucient\nincentive to monitor the project. The pledgeable income reaches a peak at W as \napproaches 0. For market values of bank assets larger than 0 but below\n^\n^\n (where\n^\n^\n is\ndened through D(\n^\n^\n) =\n^\n^\ncmin(0)), equity extracts most of the bank's return in the high\nstates. The bank manager then no longer has an incentive to monitor. Therefore, at 0\npledgeable returns drop to W1 and afterwards increase to W2 as  approaches\n^\n^\n. For even\nbetter marketability of bank assets ( >\n^\n^\n), equity renancing is suciently eective in\nextracting rents such that it is optimal to have a safe capital structure without deposits\n(formally, we have then D() < cmin(0)\n). Bank runs then no longer occur. Still, higher\nmarketability allows more to be extracted from the managers and thus W rises. Note\nthat the pledgeable income at  = 1, W3 , may be lower or higher than W, depending\non the productivity of eort.\nThe impact on eciency (not depicted) mirrors that on pledgeable income. For a given\neort choice, an increase in  tends to improve eciency because the resulting decline in\ndeposits makes bank runs less likely. However, as with pledgeable income, an increase of\n beyond 0 has the eect of destroying managerial incentives, with adverse consequences\nfor eciency.\nThe impact of an increase in the marketability of bank assets on the probability of\ndefault is depicted in Figure 2. As long as  is lower than ^\n, changes in the market value\nof bank assets do not aect the stability of the bank. This is because in this interval there\nis no repayment on equity and hence  does not matter. Within the interval ^\nFigure 2: The probability of default as a function of asset marketability\n- \n\n^\n\n\n^\n^\n\nthe default probability declines since banks increase the fraction of equity renancing,\nwhich allows for sustaining lower and lower returns without incurring runs. If  exceeds\n0, expected returns fall as the bank manager stops monitoring. Therefore, banks' default\nprobability increases. However, as the market value of bank assets increases even further,\nbanking stability improves again. When  exceeds\n^\n^\n, banks will be perfectly stable, as\nthey then chose a safe capital structure.\n4 Conclusions\nRecent changes in the nancial system have improved the tradability of bank assets and\nhave reduced banks' dependence on their managers. We have argued that this has two\neects. On the one hand, it reduces the hold-up problem between bank managers and\nshareholders. As a result, banks' capital structure needs to be less concerned with dis-\nciplining the management. Deposits can be reduced, which has the eect of increasing\nbanks' resilience to adverse return shocks. On the other hand, reducing the hold-up\nproblem also diminishes bank managers' rents, reducing their incentives to properly mon-\nitor and screen borrowers. This has negative repercussions for asset quality. Thus, even\nthough the improved marketability of bank assets allows for a safer capital structure, the\ndefault risk of banks does not necessarily decline, and may even rise. Moreover, the loss\nof managerial incentives may also contribute to an overall reduction in the eciency of\nbank nancing.\nReferences\n[1] Burkhart, M., D. Gromb, and F.
