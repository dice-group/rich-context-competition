We note that: homicide shows an even closer relationship\nto income inequality than does mortality from all other causes\ncombined; there are several reports that homicide rates are\nparticularly closely related to all cause mortality; and that there\nis a growing body of research on crime in relation to social\ndisorganisation.\nWe use US state level data to examine the relationships\nbetween various categories of income inequality, median state\nincome, social trust and mortality. The data suggest that violent\ncrime, but not property crime, is closely related to income\ninequality, social trust and mortality rates, excluding homicide.\nThe second half of the paper is devoted to literature on the\nantecedents of violence. Feeling shamed, humiliated and disre-\nspected seem to be central to the picture and are plausibly\nrelated to the way in which wider income differences are likely to\nmean more people are denied access to traditional sources of\nstatus and respect.

Published by Blackwell Publishers, 108 Cowley Road,\nIntroduction\nThis paper uses data on homicide and other categories of crime to explore\nthe nature of the associations between income distribution, mortality and a\nmeasure of social cohesion in the United States.\nClose associations between income distribution and population mortality\nrates have now been reported on independent data at least fifteen times\n(Wilkinson 1996). In different papers the relationship has been shown to\nwithstand controlling for average incomes, expenditure on medical care,\nbeen reported among developed and developing countries and among\nadministrative areas within developed countries (Ben Shlomo et al. 1996).\nMost analyses have used cross-sectional data but the relationship has also\nbeen demonstrated using data on changes over time (e.g. Wilkinson 1992;\nWhen it was believed that the main determinants of health were likely to\ninvolve the direct physiological effects of exposure to features of the mater-\nial environment and to health related behaviour, it was harder to imagine\nhow social relationships of inequality could be strongly associated with\nmortality. However, the growing body of epidemiological findings suggest-\ning the importance of features of psychosocial life, such as sense of control,\nsocial affiliations and support, self-esteem, `life events' and job security, is\nnow coupled with a clearer understanding of the physiological pathways\nthrough which chronic psychosocial stress can have a wide range of health\noutcomes (Chrousos et al. 1995). There is also impressive evidence of the\nhealth-related physiological consequences of low social status from studies\nThe difficulty is now more a matter of identifying which are the more\nimportant of a wide range of social processes that could plausibly con-\ntribute to a relationship between mortality and inequality. Particularly\ninteresting is the question of whether people's health is only affected by\nincome inequality through the impact of their individual relative income on\ntheir own health (i.e. through things like low self-esteem consequent on low\nsocial status, worry over debt, financial insecurity etc.), or whether there are\nmore broadly based social processes which may lead to improvements in\nhealth more widely among people living in more egalitarian societies \u00ad at\nleast partly independently of their own relative income. On this latter possi-\nbility, Kawachi et al. (1997) have shown statistical evidence suggesting that\nthe relationship between income inequality and mortality among the states\nof the USA is mediated by `social trust' \u00ad as measured by the proportion of\npeople in each state agreeing with the statement `most people would try to\ntake advantage of you if they got the chance'. Similarly, Wilkinson (1996)\ndiscussed a number of examples of societies which were both unusually\nMortality, the social environment, crime and violence 579\n\u00a9 Blackwell Publishers Ltd/Editorial Board 1998\negalitarian and unusually healthy. They all showed a marked tendency to\nbe more socially cohesive. However, not only is it unclear what aspects of\nsocial cohesion might be important to health, but it would be possible to\nargue that rather than income inequality affecting health through social\ncohesion, the psychosocial effects of low relative income could rebound\ndirectly on both health and social cohesion without the latter being a path-\nway to the former.\nIn passing, we should mention that it has been suggested (Fiscella and\nFranks 1997) that the association between income inequality and mortality\nmay reflect a greater incidence of absolute poverty and lower absolute levels\nof consumption among the less well off in areas of greater inequality. In\nother words, it has been argued that the relationship of income inequality\nto mortality simply reflects a compositional effect of more poor people\n(who are presumably at higher risk of death) residing in areas of high\nincome disparity. We reject this explanation because it has been shown\nthat, of the two variables income distribution and the percentage of house-\nholds in each state living below the federal poverty threshold, income distri-\nbution but not poverty is independently related to mortality. In addition,\nwhen the weak relationship between mortality and median state income is\ncontrolled for income distribution, rather than the association being\nstrengthened, it disappears altogether and mortality shows no independent\nrelation to median income whatsoever (Kaplan et al. 1996, Kennedy et al.\nHomicide\nOne of the intriguing aspects of the relationship between inequality and\nmortality is that it seems to be mirrored by a relationship between income\ndistribution and homicide. Kaplan et al. (1996) reported close correlations\nbetween income inequality and both homicide (r = 0.74) and violent crime\nrates (r = 0.70) among the 50 states of the United States. Kennedy et al.\n(1996) examined the cross-sectional relationship between household income\ndistribution and state-level variations in homicide rates. The greater the dis-\nparity in household incomes, the higher was the homicide rate at the state\nlevel. Relative deprivation was apparently an even stronger predictor of\nhomicide rates than absolute deprivation. Homicide showed correlations\nwith income inequality and household poverty rates of 0.74 and 0.53,\nrespectively. Even after adjusting for poverty, income inequality accounted\nfor 52 per cent of the between-state variance in homicide rates. An associa-\ntion between homicide and income inequality has also been found using\nand Daly (1997) reported a correlation of 0.88 between homicide and all\nother causes of death (excluding homicide) among 77 `community areas' in\nthe Chicago region. The link was confirmed in a meta-analysis of some 34\n580 Richard G. Wilkinson, Ichiro Kawachi, Bruce P. Kennedy\n\u00a9 Blackwell Publishers Ltd/Editorial Board 1998\nSocial disorganisation\nThere is a substantial body of research which suggests that crime rates\nreflect `community social disorganisation'. Social disorganisation theory\nwas originally developed by the Chicago School researchers Clifford Shaw\nand Henry McKay in their classic work, Juvenile Delinquency and Urban\nAreas (1942). Shaw and McKay demonstrated that the same socioeconomi-\ncally disadvantaged areas in 21 US cities continued to exhibit high delin-\nquency rates over a span of several decades, despite changes in their racial\nand ethnic composition, indicating the persistent contextual effects of these\ncommunities on crime rates, regardless of what populations experienced\nthem. This observation led them to reject individualistic explanations of\ndelinquency and to focus instead on community processes \u00ad like disruption\nof local community organisation and weak social controls \u00ad which led to\nthe apparent trans-generational transmission of criminal behaviour. In gen-\neral, social disorganisation is defined as the `inability of a community struc-\nture to realise the common values of its residents and maintain effective\nsocial controls' (Sampson and Groves 1989). The social organisational\napproach views local communities and neighbourhoods as complex systems\nof friendship, kinship, and acquaintanceship networks, as well as formal\nand informal associational ties rooted in family life and ongoing socialisa-\ntion processes (Sampson 1995). From the perspective of crime control, a\nmajor dimension of social disorganisation is the ability of a community to\nsupervise and control teenage peer groups, especially gangs. Thus Shaw and\nMcKay (1942) argued that residents of cohesive communities were better\nable to control the youth behaviours that set the context for gang violence.\nExamples of such controls include: `the supervision of leisure-time youth\nactivities, intervention in street-corner congregation, and challenging youth\n\"who seem to be up to no good\". Socially disorganised communities with\nextensive street-corner peer groups are also expected to have higher rates of\nadult violence, especially among younger adults who still have ties to youth\nRecently, social disorganisation theory has been linked to the emerging\nconcept of social capital (Sampson 1995). Social capital has been defined by\nsocial organisation, such as networks, norms of reciprocity, and trust in\nothers, that facilitate cooperation between citizens for mutual benefit. Lack\nof social capital is thus one of the primary features of socially disorganised\ncommunities (Sampson 1995). Although the conceptualisation and mea-\nsurement of social capital are still evolving, two critical features of the con-\ncept appear to be the level of trust among citizens and the density and rate\nof participation in voluntary associations and local organisations (Putnam\nSeveral empirical studies, reviewed by Sampson (1995), have corrobo-\nrated the link between low stocks of social capital and high crime rates.\nMortality, the social environment, crime and violence 581\n\u00a9 Blackwell Publishers Ltd/Editorial Board 1998\nTaylor and colleagues (1984) examined violent crimes (such as mugging,\nassault, murder, rape) across 63 street blocks in Baltimore. Based on inter-\nviews with 687 household respondents, Taylor et al. constructed block-level\nmeasures of the proportion of respondents who belonged to an organisa-\ntion to which co-residents also belonged, and the proportion of respondents\nwho felt responsible for what happened in the area surrounding their home.\nBoth variables were significantly and negatively associated with rates of\nviolence. Similarly, Sincha-Fagan and Schwartz (1986) collected survey\ninformation on 553 residents of 12 neighbourhoods in New York City, and\nfound a significant negative relationship between the rate of self-reported\ndelinquency and rates of organisational participation by local residents. A\nthird set of studies conducted by Sampson and Groves (1989) in Great\nBritain reported that density of local friendship networks had a significant\nnegative effect on robbery rates, while the level of organisational participa-\ntion by residents had significant inverse effects on both robbery and\nstranger violence. Not only does participation in local organisations\nincrease the level of community control, it may facilitate the capacity of\ncommunities to obtain extra-local resources \u00ad such as police and fire\nservices, as well as block grants \u00ad that have indirect consequences for crime\ncontrol (Burski and Grasmick 1993). In the most convincing demonstration\nto date of the link between social cohesion and crime, Sampson and col-\nask about their perceptions of social cohesion and trust in the neighbour-\nhood. Respondents were asked how strongly they agreed (on a five point\nscale) that `people around here are willing to help their neighbors', `this is a\nclose-knit neighborhood', `people in this neighborhood can be trusted',\n`people in this neighborhood generally don't get along with each other', and\n`people in this neighborhood do not share the same values' (the last two\nitems were reverse-coded). The resulting scale was then combined with\nresponses to questions about the level of informal social control (whether\nneighbours would intervene in situations where children were engaging in\ndelinquent behaviour) to produce a summary index of `collective efficacy'.\nCollective efficacy turned out to be significantly (P < 0.01) related to organ-\nizational participation (r = 0.45) and neighbourhood services (r = 0.21). In\nhierarchical statistical models adjusting for individual characteristics (age,\nsocioeconomic status, gender, ethnicity, marital status, home ownership,\nand years in neighbourhood), the index of collective efficacy was signifi-\ncantly inversely associated with reports of neighbourhood violence, violent\nvictimisation, as well as homicide rates. For example, a two standard devia-\ntion elevation in neighbourhood collective efficacy was associated with a\n39.7% reduction in the expected homicide rate.\nGiven these reported links between crime and the nature of the local\nsocial environment we decided to use rates of different kinds of crime to re-\nexamine the relationship between income inequality, social trust and mor-\ntality which had been identified in previous work (Kawachi et al. 1997).\n582 Richard G. Wilkinson, Ichiro Kawachi, Bruce P. Kennedy\n\u00a9 Blackwell Publishers Ltd/Editorial Board 1998\nUsing data for the states of the United States we decided to see whether\nthere were informative differences in the way different kinds of crime\nfitted into these relationships. Our hope was that they would provide a\nguide to the social processes which mediate between income distribution\nand mortality.\nData sources\nThe social environment\nA core feature of `social capital', as presented by its principal theorists\namong community members. Following Putnam (1995), we used data from\nthe General Social Surveys (GSS), conducted by the National Opinion\nResearch Center to estimate state variations in levels of interpersonal trust.\nThe GSS is a nationally representative survey of noninstitutionalised adults\nover 18 years living in the United States. The surveys have been repeated 14\ntimes over the last two decades, and have included a set of questions on\ninterpersonal trust. In the present study, we averaged five years of cumu-\n50 states, only 39 were sampled in the survey due to the small population of\nsome states (e.g. Delaware, Rhode Island); hence, social capital data were\nnot available in these states. Because the sampling design of the GSS was\nintended to be representative of regions rather than states, we adjusted indi-\nvidual responses using post-stratification weights to reflect the age, race/eth-\nnic, and educational composition of each state. Detailed procedures for the\npost-stratification weighting are described elsewhere (Kawachi et al. 1997).\nOur Social Trust variable was assessed from responses to the GSS item\nthat asked: `Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be\ntrusted, or that you can't be too careful in dealing with people?' For each\nstate, we calculated the percentage of residents who agreed that `most\npeople cannot be trusted'. Belief in the good will and benign intent of\nothers facilitates collective action and mutual cooperation, and therefore\nadds to the stock of a community's social capital. In turn, collective action\nfurther reinforces community norms of reciprocity.\nBased on the well-established association between male youth and violent\ncrime rates, we also obtained Census-derived estimates of the proportion of\nthe population in each state who were males aged 15 to 24 years.\nIncome measures\nHousehold income data for each state were obtained from the 1990 US\nCensus Summary Tape File STF 3A. The data provide annual household\nmore at the top). To calculate income inequality, counts of the number of\nhouseholds falling into each of the 25 income intervals were obtained for\nMortality, the social environment, crime and violence 583\n\u00a9 Blackwell Publishers Ltd/Editorial Board 1998\neach state. These interval data were converted into income deciles using a\nprogramme developed by the US Census Bureau. Our measure of income\ninequality, the Robin Hood Index (RHI), was estimated for each state from\nthe income decile distribution, which represents the share of total house-\nhold income in each decile. The RHI is then calculated by summing the\nexcess shares of income for those deciles whose shares of the aggregate\nincome exceed 10 per cent (Atkinson and Micklewright 1992). For example\nin Massachusetts, the RHI is 30.26 per cent. This represents the share of\ntotal income from all households that would have to be transferred from\nthose above the mean to those below the mean in order to achieve a per-\nfectly equal income distribution. The higher the value of RHI, the greater is\nthe degree of income inequality. We also obtained median gross household\nincome for each state.\nMortality and crime rates\nAge-adjusted mortality from all-causes and homicide rates were obtained\nfor each state from the Compressed Mortality Files compiled by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics, Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC). We subtracted homicide from all-cause mortality to\nprovide two variables \u00ad homicide and all-causes mortality excluding homi-\ncide \u00ad which were entirely separate from each other. Mortality (excluding\ncombined to provide more stable estimates of homicide rates.\nIncidence rates of other crimes \u00ad rape, robbery, aggravated assault, bur-\nglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft \u00ad were obtained from the Federal\nBureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) for the years\nthe incidents of crime reported to the police, and subsequently to the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) through the crime reporting pro-\ngramme. Incidence data, while subject to various biases related to varia-\ntions in reporting, are nonetheless considered less susceptible to bias\ncompared to arrest data (Reiss and Roth 1993). Table 1 shows a list of the\nvariables and their definitions. Homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated\nassault are classified under the broad category of violent crimes, while bur-\nglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft are classified under property crimes.\nResults and discussion\nTable 2 shows the correlation matrix between all the variables. Data are\npresented for the 39 states covered by the General Social Surveys. Strong\ncorrelations with mortality in the expected direction are shown with income\nalso Kawachi et al. 1997).

Correlations between mortality and the\nother crime variables failed to reach statistical significance: while robbery,\nburglary and rape showed a weak direct association with mortality, motor\nvehicle theft showed no association and larceny was inversely correlated\nwith mortality. It could be argued that the differences in the associations\nbetween mortality and different categories of crime were simply a reflection\nof differences in reporting, and that homicide shows a close association\nbecause the data are much more accurate. Nevertheless, the statistically sig-\nnificant direct correlations between higher median state income and higher\nrates of robbery and motor vehicle theft might indicate that some forms of\nproperty crime are influenced by the greater opportunities for theft which\nmore prosperous states would provide.\nAs well as being closely associated with mortality, income inequality is\nsignificantly associated with homicide (r = 0.74), social trust (r = 0.73),\ncorrelations with rape and motor vehicle theft are weakly positive but there\nis no relationship with larceny.\nThe fact that violent crime, particularly homicide and aggravated assault,\nare more closely related both to mortality and to income inequality than are\nproperty crimes, may tell us something of the nature of the relationship\nbetween mortality and income inequality. If we assume that violent crime is\nindicative of some aspect of the social fabric, how does this factor fit into\nthe relationship between mortality and both income inequality and social\ntrust?\nRegressing mortality simultaneously on income inequality and homicide\nshows that income inequality is not related to mortality independently of\nhomicide (p = 0.76), though homicide is strongly related to mortality inde-\n586 Richard G. Wilkinson, Ichiro Kawachi, Bruce P. Kennedy\n\u00a9 Blackwell Publishers Ltd/Editorial Board 1998\nTable 2 Correlation matrix for all variables (data for 39 states)\n(Coefficients marked * are significant at P < 0.05)\npendently of income inequality (p = 0.0002). Regressing mortality against\nhomicide and social trust shows that social trust is related significantly to\nmortality independently of homicide (p = 0.005), but the relationship\nbetween mortality and homicide independent of social trust fails to reach\nWhat these results suggest is that the social conditions which produce\nhomicide are near the heart of the relationships we want to understand\nbetween income distribution and mortality. The social conditions which\nproduce homicide are also very closely related to social trust (the simple\ncorrelation between homicide and social trust is 0.82) but homicide does\nnot wholly account for the relationship between social trust and mortality.\nOther forms of crime have either no relationship or a weaker relationship to\nthis pattern. It would appear that homicide and larceny (or motor vehicle\ntheft) \u00ad the most and least violent crimes \u00ad are at opposite extremes in how\nthey are related to income distribution and mortality, with assault, burglary\nand robbery taking up intermediate positions. The associations with assault\nare most like those with homicide, so adding to the impression that we are\ndealing with a distinction between social conditions which lead to increased\nviolence and those which lead to increased property crime. Rape, as a vio-\nlent crime which lacks strong associations with income distribution or\nsocial trust, appears to be an exception to this pattern, but as rape statistics\nare notoriously affected by differences in reporting, it may be unwise to\nread much into this.\nWe are inclined to take the differences in the associational patterns of\nviolence and property crime seriously partly because they echo earlier find-\nings. In an analysis of data for 27 countries, Krohn (1976) found statisti-\ncally significant relationship between higher homicide and greater income\nMortality, the social environment, crime and violence 587\n\u00a9 Blackwell Publishers Ltd/Editorial Board 1998\ninequality which remained after controlling for GNPpc. However, he found\nthe relationship with property crime was, if anything, the other way round.\nA number of other pieces of research also reveal a sharp distinction\nbetween violence and property crime. Field (1990) analyses fluctuations in\ncrime in Britain in relation to the business cycle and shows sharply differing\npatterns: property crime is negatively related to changes in consumer's\nexpenditure per capita while violence is positively related. He suggests that\nproperty crime is a result of relative deprivation, whereas violence occurs\nmore frequently when there are more people on the street and alcohol con-\nsumption is higher. Hennigan et al. (1982) examined the effects of the intro-\nduction of television in different parts of the United States in the 1950s and\n'60s on the rates of violent crime, burglary, auto theft and larceny. They\nfound no effect on violence, burglary or auto theft, but a consistent associa-\ntion between the spread of television and rises in larceny.\nWhat then are the differences between the social conditions conducive to\nhomicide and those conducive to property crime, and what can the differ-\nence tell us about the way the social environment associated with greater\nincome inequality affects health? We conjecture that one of the salient\ncharacteristics of social environments marked by wide income disparities is\nthat they generate invidious social comparisons, which in turn engender a\nsense of exclusion and alienation among vulnerable individuals. Under such\nconditions, violent behaviour may be seen as an expression of the quest for\nrespect from others. To shore up these arguments, we turn to evidence of a\ndifferent nature, viz. narrative histories of violent individuals describing\ntheir quest for respect. In the section to follow, we move purposely from\ncommunity-level analysis (the inter-relationships among income inequality,\nsocial cohesion, and mortality) toward an individual-level description of the\nrelationship between the psychological sense of exclusion and the expres-\nsion of violent behaviour. The reason for making this macro-to-micro tran-\nsition is to attempt to link the social environment (income inequality) to\nindividual health outcomes, via intervening psychological variables, includ-\ning the lack of self-esteem and the sense of not being respected.\nAntecedents of violence\nFew authorities can match James Gilligan's detailed personal knowledge of\nmen imprisoned for violence. He worked for 25 years as a psychiatrist in\nAmerican prisons talking daily to violent offenders (Gilligan 1996). As a\nformer director of the Centre for the Study of Violence at Harvard Medical\nSchool, he regards his book, Violence, as a contribution to public health\nand we shall quote from it extensively. Gilligan says:\u00ad\n. . . the prison inmates I work with have told me repeatedly, when I asked\nthem why they had assaulted someone, that it was because `he disre-\nspected me', or `he disrespected my visit' (meaning /visitor'). The word\n`disrespect' is central in the vocabulary, moral value system, and psycho-\n588 Richard G. Wilkinson, Ichiro Kawachi, Bruce P.

And he . . . replied with calm assurance,\nwith perfect coherence and even a kind of eloquence: `Pride. Dignity.\nSelf-esteem.' And then he went on to say, again more clearly than before:\n`And I'll kill every mother-fucker in that cell block if I have to in order to\nget it! My life ain't worth nothin' if I take somebody disrespectin' me and\ncallin' me punk asshole faggot and goin' Ha, Ha! at me. Life ain't worth\nlivin' if there ain't nothin' worth dyin' for.

I'll\nAbout the use of violence in robbery, Gilligan says:\u00ad\nSome people think that armed robbers commit their crime in order to get\nmoney. And of course, sometimes that is the way they rationalize their\nbehavior. But when you sit down and talk with people who repeatedly\ncommit such crimes, what you hear is, `I never got so much respect\nbefore in my life as I did when I first pointed a gun at somebody', or\n`You wouldn't believe how much respect you get when you have a gun\npointed at some dude's face'.

For we will\nnever understand violence and violent criminals until we see through\nHe continues:\nThe second precondition for violence is met when these men perceive\nthemselves as having no non-violent means of warding off or diminishing\ntheir feelings of shame or low self-esteem \u00ad such as socially rewarding\neconomic or cultural achievement, or high social status, position or\nprestige. Violence is a `last resort', a strategy they will use only when no\nOn the third precondition for violence, Gilligan says\nWhat is startling about the most violent people is how incapable they are,\nat least at the time they commit their violence, of feeling love, guilt, or\nfear. The person who is overwhelmed by feelings of shame is by definition\nexperiencing a psychically life-threatening lack of love . . . (1996: 113)\nThis accords well with Jimmy Boyle's statement (above) that in the cold\nlight of day he hated himself.

The pervasive dis-\ncrimination and exclusion of African-Americans from mainstream\nAmerican society has been postulated to be the phenomenological explana-\ntion for younger blacks' preoccupation with respect (readers are referred,\nfor example, to the eloquent qualitative work by American scholars like\nreporter, Nathan McCall, who grew up in a poverty-stricken neighbour-\nhood in Virginia and served time in prison for violent crime, says in his\nautobiography:\u00ad\nFor as long as I can remember, black folks have had a serious thing\nabout respect. I guess it's because white people disrespected them so\nblatantly for so long that blacks viciously protected what little morsels of\nself-respect they thought they had left. Some of the most brutal battles I\nsaw in the streets stemmed from seemingly petty stuff . . . But the under-\nlying issue was always respect. You could ask a guy, `Damn, man, why\ndid you bust that dude in the head with a pipe?'\nAnd he might say, `The motherfucka disrespected me!'\nThat was explanation enough. It wasn't even necessary to explain how\nthe guy had disrespected him. It was universally understood that if a\ndude got disrespected, he had to do what he had to do. It's still that way\ntoday. Young dudes nowadays call it `dissin' '. They'll kill a nigger for\ndissin' them. Won't touch a white person, but they'll kill a brother in a\nheartbeat over a perceived slight. This irony was that white folks con-\nstantly disrespected us in ways seen and unseen, and we tolerated it.\nMost blacks understood that the repercussions were more severe for\nretaliating against whites than for doing each other in. It was as if black\nfolks were saying, `I can't do much to keep whites from dissin' me, but I\ndamn sure can keep black folks from doing it'. (McCall 1994: 52)\nProperty crime\nWhat then of property crime \u00ad larceny and motor vehicle theft? The indica-\ntions of the social milieu in which it is most common are less clear. While\nthere have been several papers (cited above) which testify to a sharp distinc-\ntion between patterns of violence and theft, there is little work which\n592 Richard G. Wilkinson, Ichiro Kawachi, Bruce P. Kennedy\n\u00a9 Blackwell Publishers Ltd/Editorial Board 1998\nexplores the differences in the social environment from which these crimes\ncome. The finding that property crime increases in economic recessions\n(Field 1990), and that it also rose in response to the spread of television in\nthe United States (Hennigan et al. 1982) both suggest that it is a response to\nrelative deprivation. However, the broad pattern of correlations in Table 2\n(above) shows that it is not even weakly related to income distribution.\nMore surprising still is that larceny's weak association with mortality is an\ninverse association (Table 2), and that motor vehicle theft shows a signifi-\ncant positive relation with median income (r = 0.54) and no relation with\nmortality.\nUsing the World Values Survey (WVS) and the International Crime\nVictim Surveys, Halpern (1996) found that `although moral values have lit-\ntle or no relationship with the covariants of crime and cannot therefore\n\"explain\" it, a specific sub-set of items tapping \"self-interest\" do covary\n(with crime) and therefore offer some explanations ` (1996: 5). The WVS\ncovered 50 countries, and common groupings of values were picked out\nusing factor analysis before the factors were related to crime victimisation\nrates. In a subsequent more detailed analysis Halpern (personal communi-\ncation) reported a correlation of 0.5 between international crime victimisa-\ntion rates and the `self-interest' factor. Although these results come from\ndata which make no distinction between kinds of crime, as theft is the most\ncommon form of crime in most countries, the patterns which emerge are\nlikely to reflect its distribution.\nGiven that in our data larceny and motor vehicle theft are unrelated to\nincome distribution and tend, if anything, to be more prevalent where\nmedian income is higher and mortality lower, one might then speculate \u00ad as\nHalpern (1996) indeed does \u00ad that theft arises from values rooted in some-\nthing closer to self-interest and individualism, fuelled perhaps as much by\nthe habit of consumption as by deprivation. Our data did not include fraud\nwhich is clearly a form of property crime not involving violence.\nTraditionally regarded as a `white collar crime', fraud is likely to have even\nless association with deprivation than larceny and its inclusion would have\nled to an even sharper distinction between the pattern of violence and prop-\nerty crime.\nIndeed, a limitation of our study is the lack of data addressing a broader\nconceptualisation of violence and property crime. Thus the routine report-\ning of violent crime ignores the many other forms of institutionalised vio-\nlence in society: (a) those which are perpetrated by the State and its\npersonnel (armed forces, warfare, police, and prisons); (b) those to which\nthe State turns a blind eye (domestic violence, firearm ownership, motor\nvehicle violence \u00ad `road rage', speeding, and drunk driving); as well as (c)\nthose which are professionalised, rarely apprehended, and a necessary part\nof illegal business activity (illegal drugs, loan sharking, prostitution, protec-\ntion). Similarly, a broader definition of property crime (e.g. extraction of\nsurplus value, tax evasion, fraud and white collar crime) would have sharp-\nMortality, the social environment, crime and violence 593\n\u00a9 Blackwell Publishers Ltd/Editorial Board 1998\nened the distinctions we are trying to draw. Additionally, the usual caveats\napply in attempting to interpret findings based on crime statistics, which are\nmediated via processes of report, arrest, charge, and trial; and are conse-\nquently biased against the poor, the inarticulate, and those with low social\nstatus.\nConclusions\nOur argument is not that the number of homicide victims account for the\nrelationship between health and income distribution. It is that the violence\nassociated with income inequality serves as an indicator of the psychosocial\nimpact of wider income differences. What we can take away from this dis-\ncussion is that the most pressing aspect of relative deprivation and low rela-\ntive income is less the shortage of the material goods which others have, as\nthe low social status and the desperate lack of sources of self-esteem which\nusually goes with it. If social cohesion matters to health, then perhaps the\ncomponent of it which matters most is that people have positions and roles\nin society which accord them dignity and respect. We infer this from the\nfact that it is violence rather than property crime which varies so closely\nwith income distribution, social trust and mortality. Unlike theft, which is\nin a sense a relationship with property, violence is a much more intensely\nsocial crime and seems above all to express a lack of adequate internal and\nexternal sources of self-esteem, dignity and social status.\nAs Miller and Ferroggiaro (1996) have pointed out `Respect and self-\nrespect are central components of an enlarged concept of citizenship . . .\nRespect affects how we are treated, what help from others is likely, what\neconomic arrangements others are willing to engage in with us, when reci-\nprocity is to be expected'. Respect acts as a resource for individuals, and\nshould be considered a component of the norms of reciprocity, trust, and\nsocial obligation that are essential for minimising the risks of poor physical,\npsychological, or social health (Aday 1994). Indeed, mutual respect and the\navoidance of inflicting humiliation on people is the central concept of\nMargalit's `decent society' (Margalit 1996).
