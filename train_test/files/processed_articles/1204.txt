The NHANES I, II\nand III were multi-year surveys; beginning in 1999, the\nNHANES became a continuous annual survey and these\ndata are being released for two years at a time. The sample\ndesign for each survey is a stratified, multistage, national\nprobability sample of the USA. NHANES I and II sampled\nsubjects aged 1 to 74 years; NHANES III sampled ages 2\nages. The survey procedures consisted of a household\ninterview of the sample person conducted by a trained\ninterviewer and a health examination in the mobile\nexamination centre (MEC). Weight and height measure-\nments, interview to collect a 24-hour dietary recall, and\nblood and urine specimens were obtained in the MEC.\nSurvey response rates for examined (MEC) individuals for\nInformation on measures of SEP\nEducation\nEach NHANES collected information on the highest grade\nof education completed by the survey respondent. Ease of\nmeasurement, applicability to people not in the labour\nforce, stability over adult lifespan and the fact that health\nstatus (or diet) does not influence level of education make\nit a powerful and widely used indicator of SEP in US public\nhealth research15,16. Due to unavailability of more detailed\nrelease dataset, in this study we operationalised the level\nPoverty income ratio\nFor each NHANES, the NCHS has computed a poverty\nincome ratio (PIR) based on the survey-year-specific\npoverty threshold from the US Census Bureau14. The PIR is\na ratio of total family income to the poverty threshold for a\nfamily of given characteristics specific to each survey. A PIR\nof ,1 suggests that income is below the poverty level.\nAlthough not without limitations, the PIR is a normative\nconstruct as it assesses income in relation to need adjusting\nfor inflation. Various authors have argued that examining\nPIR as just below or above poverty provides little\ninformation about the relationship of income gradient\nwith health15,16. Therefore, we operationalised the PIR\nDietary methods\nAll the NHANES collected dietary information using a 24-\nhour dietary recall administered by a trained dietary\ninterviewer in the MEC14. Beginning with NHANES III,\ntrained dietary interviewers administered the 24-hour\nrecall using an automated, interactive format with built-in\nprobes to improve the quality of the recalls obtained. The\n2001 survey years used a computer-assisted dietary\ninterview which included a four-step multiple-pass\ncollected using a multiple-pass approach with dietary\nrecall methods that are part of the integrated US\nDepartment of Agriculture and NHANES `What We Eat in\nAmerica' protocol14.\nDietary outcome variables\nTo obtain a comprehensive picture of secular changes in\ndiet and SEP associations, we examined two types of\ndietary attribute in this study. The first group may be\nconsidered to relate with reported quantity of food which in\nturn may relate with energy intake and body weight, and\nincluded total amount of reported foods and beverages,\nenergy content and energy density of the reported diet.\nThese variables are especially pertinent given recent\nreports suggesting that the portion sizes consumed by\nAmericans have increased over the period of surveys\nexamined in this study17. The energy density of diets is\nreceiving considerable attention as a correlate of energy\nintake and body weight18 \u00ad22, and is also believed to have\nchanged over the past three decades. There is no consensus\non how energy density should be defined19 \u00ad21. The\nassociation of different energy density measures with\nnutrient profiles and body weight varies depending on how\nthis variable is defined19 \u00ad21. For example, the association of\nenergy and nutrient intake with energy density variables\nthat included beverages was not as strong as with energy\ndensity variables derived from solid foods21, possibly due\nto a different physiological mechanism of regulation of\nbeverage intake as suggested by Rolls et al.22. Therefore, in\nthe present study, we assessed dietary energy density (kcal\nper g) of all foods and nutritive beverages (i.e. milk and\n100% juices, but excluding all alcoholic and non-alcoholic\nenergy-yielding or non-energy-yielding beverages \u00ad e.g.\ncoffee, tea, sodas, juice drinks).\nThe second group of dietary variables included\nfoods/nutrients potentially related to health. Many\nnutrients with known associations with health \u00ad vitamin\nE, folate, dietary fibre and carotenoids \u00ad were not\navailable for all surveys; therefore the nutrients examined\nwere limited to those available in all surveys, and included\nintakes of fat and saturated fat, carbohydrate, and the\nmicronutrients vitamins C and A, calcium and potassium.\nWhether respondents mentioned any food from the fruit\nor vegetable group (as defined below) and a summary\nmeasure of overall diet quality \u00ad dietary diversity score\n(DDS)23 \u00ad were also examined. The DDS, a relatively\nsimple measure of diet quality, was shown to relate with\nmortality in the NHANES I epidemiologic follow-up study\nTrends in the association of socio-economic position and diet 159\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

The DDS\nconsiders whether or not a food from each of the five\nmajor food groups (fruit, vegetable, dairy, meat/alterna-\ntive, and grain) was mentioned in the recall23. To compute\nthe DDS, foods reported in each survey were grouped into\none or more of the major food groups using methods\ndescribed previously23. The fruit group included all fresh,\nfrozen or canned fruits and 100% juices, but excluded fruit\ndrinks and fruit desserts such as fruit pies. The vegetable\ngroup included all raw, canned and frozen vegetables and\njuices. The grain group included all cereals, breads, pasta,\nrice, etc., but excluded pastries, cookies, cakes and pies.\nThe meat group included eggs, meat, poultry, fish and\nalternatives such as beans, nuts and seeds. The dairy\ngroup included milk, yoghurt and cheese but excluded ice\ncream and other dairy desserts. Foods in mixed dishes\nwere grouped into all the constituent food groups.\nAs an estimate of possible low energy reporting, a ratio of\nreported energy intake (EI) to basal energy expenditure\n(BEE) was also computed. The BEE was estimated using\nage-, sex- and weight-specific equations developed by the\nDietary Reference Intakes committee26. We used an EI/BEE\nratio of ,1.2 to suggest low energy reporting in this study.\nBiomarkers\nWe also examined trends in the association of SEP with\nthree biomarkers: body mass index (BMI), serum total\ncholesterol (TC) and serum high-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol (HDL-C). Serum HDL-C was not available for\nNHANES I; these analyses included data from the latter\nthree surveys.\nAnalytic sample\nFor each of the four surveys, all non-pregnant, non-\ndietary recall (considered reliable by the NCHS) and with\ninformation on PIR and education were included in the\nanalytic sample. The lower age cut-off of 25 years was\nchosen because post-school education is usually com-\npleted by this age; the upper age cut-off of 74 years was\nnecessary because NHANES I and II did not include\nrespondents older than 74 years. The total sample size for\nAnalytical methods\nWe used linear or logistic multiple regression models to\nassess the independent association of education and PIR\nwith dietary and biomarker outcomes. Because of\ndifferences in the distribution of a number of factors that\nmay be associated with reporting of food intake among\nsurveys, the regression models included gender, age, age2,\nattribute or biomarker as a continuous or binary outcome.\nRegression models for predicting changes in the SEP\u00ad\nbiomarker associations also included smoking status,\nalcohol use status and leisure-time physical activity as\ncovariates. The race/ethnicity categories available in\nin earlier surveys. NHANES I and II provide only white,\nblack and other categories. NHANES III provides both\nrace- and ethnicity-specific categories. However, NHANES\n(non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic black, Mexican\nAmerican, Other Hispanic and All other). Therefore, we\ncategorised race as white, black and other as available in\ngrouped Mexican-Americans and other Hispanics with\nnon-Hispanic whites. These methods are similar to those\nused by others27. To assess whether the association of\neducation or PIR with dietary attributes differed among the\nfour surveys, all models included two interaction terms:\nPIR by survey and education by survey. If the interaction\nterm(s) was not significant, we examined the main effects\nof education and PIR after exclusion of the interaction\nterm(s), across all surveys combined. A backwards\nstepwise regression with an exclusion criterion of\nP . 0.01 for the interaction was used to determine\nwhich interactions remained in the model. The mean\nestimates presented in the tables and figures are predictive\nmargins obtained from fully adjusted regression models28.\nIn tests for trend and interaction, survey, education and\nPIR were modelled as continuous variables.\nBecause we combined the data from four surveys for\nthese analyses, our approach was to treat the data from the\nfour different surveys as independent samples from\ndifferent populations. Therefore, we weighted the data\nin our analyses using the NCHS-assigned survey-specific\nsample weights so as to produce estimates that\nrepresented each population29. All statistical analyses\nwere adjusted for the sample weights and complex sample\ndesign of the four national surveys by using SAS callable\nSUDAAN, version 9.030. All P-values were two-sided.\nGiven the multiple tests of association done in this study\nand the large sample size, we chose a conservative\ncriterion of P , 0.01 for finding statistical significance.\nAlthough we present all results, the discussion is limited to\nvariables where the level of significance was P , 0.01.\nResults\nThe percentage of those with ,12 years of education\ndecreased while the percentage with .12 years increased\nduring this period (Table 1).

In NHANES I and II, increasing PIR\nwas associated with higher percentage reporting a fruit\nor all five food groups, and higher intake of vitamin C;\nhowever, these PIR-related differences diminished or\ndisappeared in later surveys.

However, SEP differentials in most examined\noutcomes persisted over three decades. Diminished SEP\ndifferentials were seen for only a few of the outcomes and\nmay reflect population-wide shifts in intake (discussed\nbelow). Therefore, while our findings do not support\nincreasing SEP differential in diet quality as a contributor to\nthe increasing SEP differential in mortality, they do suggest\nthe continued importance of diet in addressing education-\nand income-related disparity in health of the US population.\nThe education differential inthe energy-adjusted amount\nof carbohydrate and the PIR differential in mention of a fruit\nor all five food groups (DDS of 5) and vitamin C intake,\nnarrowing of the education differential in carbohydrate\nintake appears to reflect a population-wide increase in the\nintake of this macronutrient rather than a selective change\nby the low-education group. Similarly, narrowing of the\nPIR-associated gap in mention of a fruit or all five food\ngroups does not appear to be due to gains by respondents\nin low PIR categories, but rather because of lower reporting\nof these food groups by higher PIR respondents in later\nsurveys. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility of\nSEP differences in types of carbohydrates or of foods within\neach of the five food groups, as our methods were not\nsensitive to these differences. For example, it is possible\nthat, within a food group, food selections (such as fish vs.\nhamburger, fresh fruits vs. canned fruits, or whole grains vs.\nrefined grains) may differ by SEP categories, and their\npatterns of consumption may also have changed over time.\nThese possible SEP differences in quality of food choices\nrequire further study.\nIn our study, both measures of SEP were independent\npredictors of several dietary attributes. However, relative\nto PIR as operationalised in this study, not only were\neducation differentials present for most of the examined\ndietary and biomarker outcomes, but also the magnitude\nof these differentials was larger. Although total energy\nintake or amount of foods reported appeared to differ little\nby education, the intake of micronutrients examined in the\nstudy (vitamins A and C, potassium and calcium), and\nmention of fruits, vegetables or overall diet quality (DDS),\nwere lower in Americans with a lower level of education in\nall surveys. This suggests that in all surveys, food\nselections reported by respondents with higher education\ndiffered from those of respondents with lower education\nlevel. Conversely, increasing PIR was accompanied by an\nincrease in total amount of reported foods and energy\nintake, but not all micronutrients. Education and PIR are\nknown to be correlated. However, the two indicators are\nable to capture different dimensions of dietary behaviours,\nwhich may explain the different associations of education\nand income with the outcomes examined in this study.\nWhile income may be related to diet by affecting\npurchasing ability for foods recommended in dietary\nguidance, this gap can be somewhat narrowed by food\nassistance programmes. The level of education, however,\ncan affect not only purchasing ability, but also may be\nassociated with exposure to and understanding of dietary\ninformation, which in turn may relate to motivation for\nacquisition of behaviours promoted in dietary guidance.\nTo close the education-related gaps in dietary quality, it is\nimportant that dietary guidance-related messages be\nsimple and use media that are accessible to Americans\nwith a lower level of education. Moreover, food assistance\nprogrammes should include nutrition education\ncomponents.\nReports from the Nationwide Food Consumption\nlittle variation in unadjusted dietary nutrient intakes by\nhousehold income or level of education31,32; although\nother reports have provided evidence of a SEP differential\nin dietary intakes33 \u00ad42. Relatively few studies, however,\nhave examined time trends in the association of dietary\npublished reports on time trends in SEP and diet\nassociation have studied populations in different Euro-\npean countries43 \u00ad45. A comparison of our results with\nfindings from other studies is complicated by differences\nin methods of dietary assessment, time period covered in\nthe trend analysis, operational forms of dietary variables\nand measures of SEP, and analytic methodology. Despite\nthese differences, the results of most of these studies43 \u00ad 45\nare concordant with the results reported here. The lack of\nan association of dietary total and saturated fat intake with\nmeasures of SEP in our study is in accord with other such\nDutch National Food Consumption surveys revealed\npersistence of socio-economic status-related differences\nConversely, using food consumption data from the UK,\nJames et al. concluded that the socio-economic gap in\nconsumption of fruits, vegetables and vitamin C widened\nWe found the strong PIR differential in the likelihood of\n2002; however, the education-related differential nar-\ntrends in the association of education and obesity in 20\u00ad\n2000, and found that the education differential in risk of\nobesity had declined in the last survey47. We observed\nsimilar trends, although Zhang and Wang did not formally\ntest for the change in the association of education with\nobesity across surveys, nor did they adjust for the effects of\nseveral known correlates of body weight.\nJames et al.12 and Drewnowski et al.48 have argued that\nin affluent nations, the diet quality of lower-income\nAK Kant and BI Graubard\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

In an analysis of French diets, high\nsugar and fat intakes were associated with lower overall\ndiet cost but higher energy density41. Thus, diets with high\nenergy density may be consumed in association with low\nSEP and may be implicated in a higher risk of obesity in\nthese consumers. Our results are supportive of the notion\nthat low-SEP consumers have diets of higher energy\ndensity. Education and PIR were independent predictors\nof dietary energy density in all four surveys.\nWe would like to note the following limitations of our\nstudy. First, the methods used to collect the 24-hour\ndietary recall in NHANES have changed over the course of\nthe four surveys14. These include a change in methods\nused by dietary interviewers to administer the 24-hour\nrecall, and use of multiple-pass and probing to improve\nthe recalls. Second, the database on nutrient composition\nof foods has expanded and values of many nutrients may\nhave changed because of improved analytical techniques\nand food sampling methods49. Third, the recalls obtained\nin NHANES I and II were limited to weekdays, whereas\nweekend days were included in later surveys14. Because\nthe NCHS did not conduct any bridging studies to\ndetermine the systematic effect of changes in dietary\nmethodology on food and nutrient intakes, the confound-\ning of time effect with the method effect remains a\npossibility. For these reasons, we urge caution in\ninterpretation of secular trends across surveys presented\nin Table 2. Within each survey, however, the methods\nused for data collected from all respondents in all potential\nexposure categories of income or education were similar.\nTherefore, while these data may be of limited value in\nestimating survey effect, they are valid for an examination\nof changes in the association of measures of SEP with\ndietary attributes in these surveys. To our knowledge,\nthere are no data to help us examine the possibility that\nchange in methodology may differentially affect those\nwith different PIR or education.\nWe also note that because Hispanics were included with\nwhites in the NHANES I and II public release data, we\ngrouped them similarly in later surveys. Because the\ndistribution of Hispanics in the US population has changed\nover the period of these surveys, this may have biased the\nresults of secular trends.\nMeasurement error has been recognised as a problem in\nall methods of assessing dietary intake, including 24-hour\nrecalls used in the NHANES50,51. Low energy reporting has\nbeen noted in NHANES II and NHANES III52 \u00ad54, and is\nmore likely to occur in conjunction with low income and\nlow level of education55. In an attempt to explore this\nissue, we examined trends in the association of PIR and\neducation with the ratio of reported EI to calculated BEE.\nUsing a ratio of ,1.2 to suggest low energy reporting, the\npercentage of the population reporting EI/BEE of ,1.2\ndecreased over time; but we found no change in the\nassociation of PIR or education with the odds of reporting\nEI/BEE , 1.2 (data not shown). Given the increasing\nmedia focus on the association of diet with health,\nhowever, it is possible that patterns of reporting of\n`nutritionally correct' foods may have changed over time,\nand the type of reporting errors also may differ by\ncategories of exposure variables. The EI/BEE ratios are of\nlittle value in examining these issues, which require\nfurther investigation. Due to the lack of repeat measure-\nment of dietary intake in all surveys, we could not\ncompute usual dietary intakes per recent recommen-\ndations56; therefore, we did not derive estimates of\nprevalence of nutrient adequacy.\nIn conclusion, although the income and education\ndifferentials in self-reported food and nutrient intake did\nnot increase over time, the persistence of such differences\nover three decades suggests continued need for improve-\nment in the quality of diets of Americans with a low\nincome and education.\n"
