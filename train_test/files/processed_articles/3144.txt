Fast-turnaround household surveys fill some of the void in data on recent\nchanges to insurance coverage, but they lack the historical data that allow analysts to account for trends that predate the\nACA, economic fluctuations, and earlier public program expansions when predicting how many people would be uninsured\nwithout comprehensive health care reform. Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) from 2000 to 2012 and\nthe Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS) data for 2013 and 2015, this article develops an approach to estimate the\nnumber of people who would be uninsured in the absence of the ACA and isolates the change in coverage as of March 2015\nthat can be attributed to the ACA. We produce counterfactual forecasts of the number of uninsured absent the ACA for 9\nage-income groups and compare these estimates with 2015 estimates based on HRMS relative coverage changes applied to\nCPS-based population estimates. As of March 2015, we find the ACA has reduced the number of uninsured adults by 18.1\nmillion compared with the number who would have been uninsured at that time had the law not been implemented. That\ndecline represents a 46% reduction in the number of nonelderly adults without insurance. The approach developed here can\nbe applied to other federal data and timely surveys to provide a range of estimates of the overall effects of reform.\n",

Blumberg, PhD1, Bowen Garrett, PhD1, and John Holahan, PhD1\n Keywords\nACA, uninsured, insurance coverage, forecast, estimates\nOriginal Research\nGiven the large public investment in expanding health insur-\nance coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and the\ndegree of controversy the law has engendered, it is important\nto accurately quantify the causal effects of the ACA on cov-\nerage, accounting for likely changes that would have resulted\nabsent the policy change (eg, due to the recovery from the\nGreat Recession). In this article, we develop an approach to\n(1) estimate the number of people who would be uninsured\nin the absence of the ACA and (2) isolate the change in cov-\nerage as of March 2015 that can be attributed to policy\nchanges under the ACA. The ACA's main coverage reforms\nincluded an expansion of Medicaid, income-related tax cred-\nits and cost-sharing reductions for nongroup insurance, an\narray of small group and nongroup private insurance regula-\ntory reforms, and an individual mandate, the vast majority of\nwhich were implemented in January of 2014. Provisions that\nallowed young adults (aged 19-25) to remain on their par-\nents' health insurance policies were implemented in 2010.\nMany modest policy changes to private insurance regulation,\nnot believed to have had significant effects on the number of\ninsured nonelderly adults, also took effect for plan years\nelimination of lifetime dollar benefit caps, the gradual\nincrease of allowable annual dollar benefit limits, first-dollar\ncoverage for certain preventive benefits, and others.1\nAlthough the original intent of the law was that eligibility\nfor Medicaid would be expanded in every state, a Supreme\nCourt decision made expanding optional and only 28 states\nhad done so as of the end of summer 2014, significantly\nreducing the potential coverage effect of the law.2 Three\nadditional states have expanded Medicaid since then. In\naddition, 3 states (California, Connecticut, and Minnesota)\nand the District of Columbia opted to expand Medicaid\nbefore 2014 under the auspices of the ACA. Nonetheless,\nmajor increases in insurance coverage caused by the ACA\nIndeed, a number of surveys have found increases in cov-\nerage for adults since 2015.3-5 These data are important, but\n1Urban Institute, Washington, DC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nBowen Garrett, Urban Institute, 2100 M.

Rather, if we want to understand the\neffect of the ACA on coverage, we must assess what would\nhave happened had there been no ACA and compare the new\nlevels of coverage with that counterfactual. We develop our\nestimate of what would have happened in the absence of the\ning for preexisting trends and determinants of insurance cov-\nerage. A similarly intentioned approach was taken by\nSommers and colleagues, but they relied on a time trend\nACA time trend and uses a substantially longer period.6\nThere has been a long-term decline in employer-\nsponsored insurance, mostly among low-wage workers.7\nMedicaid enrollment has expanded over the past few decades,\nparticularly because of increased eligibility for children. The\nChildren's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) has also\nexpanded coverage. The net result has been reductions in the\nnumber of uninsured children, but increases in the number of\nuninsured adults. The Great Recession exacerbated these\ntrends, resulting in a large drop in employer-sponsored insur-\nance and an increase in the number of uninsured. We are now\nin an economic recovery, with unemployment dropping.\nGenerally, declines in unemployment lead to increases in\nemployer-sponsored insurance.8\nGiven the recovery and absent other changes, Medicaid\nrolls would have fallen as more families'incomes increased,\nalthough the magnitude of such changes would depend on\nchanges in the distribution of income. The number of unin-\nsured could thus have decreased for most groups but\nincreased for some because of the steady erosion of\nemployer-sponsored insurance that has taken place, particu-\nlarly caused by declines in small firms' coverage offers,\nwhich have continued quite steadily since at least 1999.9 In\nthis article, we estimate the effect of changes in economic\nconditions, secular trends, and public insurance eligibility\non uninsurance rates, by age and income group, and we use\nthese estimates to predict what would have happened if\nthere had been no ACA. We then compare these predictions\nwith 2015 data on uninsurance to estimate the effects of the\nlaw's implementation.\nThis type of analysis requires both a model of how unin-\nsurance rates would change absent the ACA that captures\nlong-standing trends and a source of data that provides timely\nmeasures of uninsurance rates and comparable rates before\nthe implementation of the ACA's major coverage provisions\nin 2014. Both the Current Population Survey (CPS) and\nNational Health Interview Survey (NHIS) have data histories\nthat enable modeling of the long-term trends, cyclical effects,\nand demographic shifts affecting health insurance coverage\nto produce a counterfactual estimate of the uninsurance rate,\nbut those surveys become available with a time lag. In this\narticle, we use the CPS because, unlike the NHIS, it provides\nstate identifiers on its public use files. Newer, Internet-based\nhousehold surveys, such as the Urban Institute's Health\nReform Monitoring Survey (HRMS) and another conducted\nby Gallup, provide fast-turnaround results using quarterly\ndata from both before and after 2014, but those surveys do\nnot have the long data histories needed to estimate long-term\ntrends. The approach described below uses a combination of\na CPS-time trend and recent data from the HRMS as an\nexample of how the advantages of both types of data--large,\nlong-standing federal surveys and fast-turnaround Internet-\nbased surveys--can be brought to bear to inform us of the\nACA's effects on an ongoing basis.\nMethodological Approach\nForecasting the Number of Uninsured If There\nWere No ACA\nOur analysis estimates changes in the number of uninsured\noccurred in the absence of the ACA. We examine nonelderly\nadults because it is for this population that we have data on\ncoverage changes over this period from sources of timely\nprivate quarterly data such as the HRMS and Gallup. We\ndesign the analysis to account for the effects of long-standing\ntrends in uninsurance rates, cyclical effects caused by eco-\nnomic conditions, and changes in Medicaid eligibility. As the\nAnnual Social and Economic Supplement of the CPS, which\nmeasures individual-level insurance status and income data\nwhether the survey participants' responses to the CPS cover-\nage questions align with the reference period, we interpret\nthe data collected to be consistent with the type of coverage\nthe respondent typically had during the course of the preced-\ning a series of regression models because it is long enough to\nreflect long-term trends and roughly balances years of good\nand bad economic conditions; it also demonstrates cyclical-\nity in coverage rates consistent with changing economic con-\nditions. The period includes 2 economic cycles, including the\ndot-com bust and recovery, the Great Recession, and some\nyears of incomplete recovery. We do not use data from the\n2014 survey because of changes in the measurement of unin-\nsurance that would introduce a discontinuity in the time\nseries.\nWe conduct analyses separately for 9 population seg-\nments defined by 3 income categories relative to the federal\n45-64). Levels and historic trends in uninsurance rates differ\nsubstantially by income and (to a lesser extent) age, separate\nfrom any effects of the ACA. We also expect different\nBlumberg et al. 3\ncoverage effects for the 3 income groups because Medicaid\nexpansions are targeted to the low-income group, and finan-\ncial assistance (premium tax credits and cost-sharing reduc-\ntions) to purchase individual coverage through the\nmarketplaces are targeted to those in the middle-income\ngroup. Those in the higher income group receive no financial\nassistance to purchase marketplace coverage under the ACA\nbut are the most likely to face a penalty if they do not obtain\ncoverage under the ACA's individual mandate. Within each\nincome group, the coverage effects of the ACA may differ by\nage group for several reasons, including access to coverage\nthrough a parent's employer for young adults, increasing\ndemand for health insurance with age, and age differences in\naccess to coverage through an employer.\nFor each of the income-age groups, we estimate linear\nregression models of the uninsurance rate at the state-year\nlevel. The CPS data are collapsed to the state-year level, by\nincome-age group, with sample weights applied. We then\naugment CPS data by merging in unemployment rates at the\nstate-year level specific to each of the 3 age groups in the\nanalysis (which we compute from CPS basic monthly files\nMedicaid eligibility rates (detailed below) by state, year, and\nincome-age group.\nEach regression model specifies the expected uninsurance\nrate in a state and year to be a function of a linear year trend\n(common to all states), state fixed effects, the unemployment\nrate, and the percentage of adults who qualify for Medicaid\nthrough provisions covering parents (which for brevity, we\nrefer to as the \"Medicaid eligibility rate\"). For the higher\nincome group, the Medicaid eligibility rate is excluded\nbecause no adults with incomes above 400% of FPL are esti-\nmated to be Medicaid eligible.\nWhen the models are fit to the data, the year trend cap-\ntures the secular trend in the uninsurance rate over the sam-\nple period that is not correlated with the other included\nfactors (which may arise from trends in health care costs,\npremiums, cost sharing, or other factors). The state fixed\neffects control for factors related to differences in uninsur-\nance rates across states that are constant over time (such as\npremium-level differences, employment patterns, fixed attri-\nbutes of Medicaid programs, and uncontrolled demographic\ndifferences). Also, by including the state fixed effects, the\ncoefficients on the unemployment and Medicaid eligibility\nvariables are estimated only using within-state variation. The\nunemployment rate captures the extent to which the uninsur-\nance rate rises and falls over economic cycles,8 and the\nMedicaid eligibility rate controls for Medicaid expansions\nover the period. By including the Medicaid eligibility rate\nvariable, we prevent the year trend variable from picking up\nthe effects of Medicaid expansions in eligibility for parents\n(and expansions for nonparents to the extent they are corre-\nlated with the parent expansions).\nMedicaid eligibility rates were computed as the (weighted)\npercentage of adults in each age group, income group, state,\nand year who were eligible for Medicaid through the provi-\nsions for parents. Individuals in the CPS were deemed eligi-\nble if they were a parent and if the income of their health\ninsurance unit was below the Medicaid/CHIP eligibility\nthreshold that applied to parents in their state and year.\nMedicaid/CHIP eligibility thresholds for parents by state and\nyear were collected from Kaiser Family Foundation reports.10\nBecause of the complexity of the Medicaid provisions for\nadult nonparents that exist in some states (such as work\nrequirements and enrollment caps), it was not possible to\ncapture eligibility for nonparents in this measure. To better\nunderstand the effect of this limitation on our results, we esti-\nmated versions of the regression models below that excluded\ndata from 5 states that had already made ACA-like Medicaid\nexpansions to childless adults before the ACA. The states\nwere Delaware, Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont as\nwell as the District of Columbia. Each of these states already\nprovided Medicaid or Medicaid-like coverage to nonparents\nwith incomes up to at least 100% of the FPL before the ACA.\nOther states had also made more limited Medicaid expan-\nsions to childless adults. The year trend effects were more\nstrongly positive when these states were excluded, suggest-\ning that there would have been larger growth in the adult\nhad not expanded Medicaid to nonparents. The implication\nfor our main analysis is that the forecasted increases in adult\nuninsurance rates absent the ACA would likely be larger (as\nwould effects of the ACA in reducing coverage) if we con-\ntrolled for Medicaid eligibility for nonparents. In this sense,\nour estimates of the ACA's effects are conservative.\nWe take a series of additional steps in the analysis so that\nearly effects of the ACA are not inadvertently built into the\ncounterfactual estimates of uninsurance rates. First, we remove\nthe effects of the early ACA Medicaid expansions in 4 states\nfrom our predicted uninsurance rates in each group by\nexcluding the state-years with early expansions from the\nestimation sample of the regressions.11 If these state-years\nwere included, the year trends in the model could pick up\ncoverage effects that are due to the ACA. Specifically, we\nexclude data from Connecticut and the District of Columbia\nsurance rate regression models. Two other states, New Jersey\nand Washington, also made early Medicaid expansions under\nthe ACA but these were transfers of enrollees from preexist-\ning state programs to Medicaid. Because they did not involve\nnew enrollment, we did not exclude them from the estima-\ntion sample. Although these early expansions may not have\nbeen fully phased in until 2014 (eg, participation and income\neligibility varied by county in California, and income eligi-\nbility was not up to the full 2014 levels in Connecticut and\nMinnesota), we exclude the entire state-year with early\nexpansion from the estimation sample so the models do not\npick up effects that could be attributable to the ACA. Some\nother states had already expanded coverage to childless\nadults using waiver authority that predated the ACA. We\nconsider trends in uninsurance rates related to these pre-ACA\nexpansions as part of the counterfactual, and accordingly we\ndo not exclude states with pre-ACA expansions for childless\nadults from our estimation sample. As a second related step,\nwhen computing predicted uninsurance rates using the esti-\nmated regression models, we hold the Medicaid eligibility\nvariable fixed at its value in the year just before the early\nexpansion for all subsequent years; that hold prevents\nchanges in the Medicaid eligibility variable attributable to\nthe ACA from affecting the predicted uninsurance rates.\nFinally, we restrict the data used to estimate the regression\nACA expanded coverage for young adults starting in late\n2010, leading to noticeably lower uninsurance rates for this\nyoung adult models, the effects of the ACA's dependent cov-\nerage expansions that were implemented in the second half\nEven though we expect very little effect of dependent cover-\nage expansion in 2010 given that it started late in the year, we\nexclude 2010 to avoid picking up any ACA effect in the\ncounterfactual models for young adults. For the remaining\nage groups, we estimate the regression models using all years\nTable 1 reports estimated coefficients for each regression\nmodel. For the low-income group, higher unemployment is\nsignificantly associated with higher rates of uninsurance and\nis the largest driver of coverage changes for all 3 age groups.\nThe year trend is statistically insignificant for all three age\ngroups. For young adults, higher rates of Medicaid eligibility\nare significantly associated with lower rates of uninsurance.\nFor the middle-income group, the year trend is the largest\ndriver of changes in uninsurance. In each of the age groups,\nthe uninsurance rate is increasing about 0.4 percentage points\neach year on average, controlling for the other factors. Higher\nunemployment is associated with higher uninsurance rates\nfor the oldest group. The effect of the unemployment rate is\nstatistically insignificant for the other 2 age groups. For\nadults in the high-income group, we find statistically signifi-\ncant year trends for the middle and older age groups, with the\npoints on average each year, respectively, controlling for\nother factors. Unemployment rate effects are small and only\nstatistically significant (at the 10% level) for the middle age\ngroup.\nIn Figures 1 to 3, we examine overall model performance\nat the national level by age group and income group. We\ncompute predicted values from the regression models for\neach year and collapse the data to the national level by year\nto examine overall performance. For the 2 older groups\nacross each income group, the model predictions fit the\nactual data very well, clearly capturing both the overall trend\nand cyclical effects related to changes in the unemployment\nrate during the Great Recession for the low-income group.\nTable 1.

First, actual uninsurance rates are substantially\nlesser degree 2010) for each income group. The decline of\nthe uninsurance rate from 2010 may be attributed to the\nACA's dependent coverage provision. The predicted trend is\nintended not to capture the ACA's effects, and it is shown to\ncontinue the preexisting trend. Second, uninsurance rates for\nyoung adults exhibit more year-to-year volatility than the 2\nother age groups because they are based on smaller samples.\nThus, the models effectively capture the overall trend in\nuninsurance for young adults before implementation of the\nACA's dependent coverage expansions that were targeted at\nyoung adults.\nUsing the estimated regression models, we generate out-\nof-sample forecasts of uninsurance rates by income-age\ngroup to 2015. Out-of-sample regression predictions are\ncomputed using actual state unemployment data in each year\n(by age group) as was used in the sample. We hold Medicaid\neligibility rates fixed at their 2012 values so that forecasted\nin Medicaid eligibility caused by the ACA. In the case of the\n3 early expansion states and the District of Columbia, eligi-\nbility rates are held fixed at their preexpansion level such\nthat their ACA-related eligibility expansions (in 2010 for\nConnecticut and District of Columbia and 2011 for California\nand Minnesota) are not incorporated into the baseline predic-\ntions. This means that our forecasts assume that absent the\nACA, there would have been no additional Medicaid eligi-\nbility expansions.\nFinally, we make a small adjustment to the predicted val-\nues to eliminate the gap between actual and predicted values\nin the last year of the estimation sample.

For low-income\nadults, forecasted uninsurance rates are relatively flat to\nDespite the overall rising trend in uninsurance from 2000 to\n2012, the uninsurance rate would have been expected to fall\nslightly because of the falling unemployment rate. For the\nmiddle-income group, uninsurance rates are forecast to rise\nwithin each age group, continuing the overall trend since\n2000 (Figure 5). For adults in the higher income group, fore-\ncasted trends assuming no ACA show a slight decline for\nyoung adults, a flat trend for the middle age group, and a\ncontinuation of the preexisting upward trend for the older\nage group (Figure 6).\nWe use the forecasted uninsurance rates from 2013 and\n2015 to estimate the number of uninsured adults that would\nbe measured by the CPS in those 2 years if there were no\nACA (and if there were no changes in how the CPS measures\nthe number of uninsured).13 We estimate the number of unin-\nsured in each year by multiplying the forecasted number of\npeople by the forecasted uninsurance rate in each income-\nage group in each year. We forecast the number of people in\neach income-age group using regression methods similar to\nthose we use to compute forecasted uninsurance rates. We\nestimate generalized linear regression models with a log link\n(Poisson regression) of the number of people in each group\nBlumberg et al. 7\nat the state-year level using a linear time trend and the unem-\nployment rate (we would not expect the Medicaid eligibility\nrate to have an effect on population size and exclude it from\nthe population models). The models also include state fixed\neffects.

For example, the predicted number of adults aged\n38.1 million, compared with an estimated 39.9 million in the\nCPS (a difference of 1.8 million). To make the adjustment,\nwe added 1.8 million people to the predicted number in 2012,\nadjustment amounts were smaller. We also make adjustments\nto ensure that overall growth rates by age group (aggregating\nover income groups) matches US Census forecasts.\nThe forecasted number of people in each population group,\nas well as the estimated uninsurance rate and number of unin-\nTable 2. Population size forecasts show variability in rates of\ngrowth by population segment. Within each age category, there\nis the least amount of growth or negative growth for the low-\nincome category because of falling unemployment rates over\nthis period.As discussed, we predict rising rates of uninsurance\nfor adults in the middle-income group (without the ACA); we\npredict declining or nearly flat rates of uninsurance in the low-\nincome group. For the high-income group, the direction of\nchange is mixed: Young adults are predicted to experience fall-\ning rates of uninsurance because of falling unemployment\nrates. Overall, we find that the number of uninsured adults\nuninsured young adults and the oldest adults in the middle- and\nhigh-income groups experiencing the highest rates of growth.\nCombining the CPS Counterfactual With Evidence\nFrom Quick Turnaround Tracking Surveys\nThe conceptual framework of our analysis is as follows.\nPresume that the relative percent (not percentage point)\nobserved through the HRMS are correct and use them to\nimpute the number and rate of uninsured that would have\nbeen observed in 2015 had the CPS continued asking the\nsame coverage questions in the same manner as it had in pre-\nvious years. Then, using the predictive CPS-based model\ndescribed in the previous section, identify the ACA coverage\neffect: the difference in the number of uninsured estimated in\n2015 given implementation of the ACA compared with the\nnumber we predict would have been uninsured had the ACA\nnot been implemented. The results of doing so are presented\nconsistent with the CPS framework.\nUsing information from both the HRMS and the CPS\nallows us to place the 2015 findings from the HRMS track-\ning survey in the context of projected trends in coverage,\ninterpreting those findings in a way consistent with the CPS's\nbroadly familiar measures of the levels of insurance cover-\nage. In this analysis, we rely upon the HRMS because its\nmicrodata allow us to assess changes for adults in different\npolicy-relevant income and age groups. However, the same\napproach could be used with any of the available tracking\nsurveys.\nAlthough they do not provide as definitive estimates of\ncoverage levels as large government household surveys with\nhigher response rates, tracking surveys such as the HRMS\nand the Gallup survey provide more timely indicators of rela-\ntive changes in health insurance coverage across recent peri-\nods. Surveys such as HRMS and Gallup do not provide the\nlong-time trend that the CPS provides, so they cannot pick up\nthe effects of economic cycles and can only develop counter-\nfactuals based on a few years. Thus, using a timely tracking\nsurvey in conjunction with long-term trends provided from a\nfederal survey such as the CPS provides an effective combi-\nnation for assessing the ACA's coverage effects.\nThe specific steps taken to compute the ACA coverage\neffect are delineated below. Hat marks (^) in the formulas\nbelow indicate predicted values, as distinguished from val-\nues directly estimated from available data.\nStep 1.As described in the previous section, we first esti-\nmate regressions of the share of uninsured nonelderly adults\nby age and income group to obtain parameter estimates for\nhow unemployment rate, Medicaid eligibility rate, and time\nhave historically affected the number of uninsured.\nStep 2. Using the parameters estimated in step 1, we predict\nthe number of nonelderly adults by age and income group who\nbeen implemented. This step was described in detail in the pre-\nvious section and results are shown in Table 2. The number of\nuninsured adults is represented in the formulas as\n .\nStep 3. We compute the relative change in the uninsurance\nrates observed in the HRMS data between the third quarter of\n2013 (before the implementation of the health insurance\nmarketplaces and their associated financial assistance and\nthe Medicaid expansion) and the first quarter of 2015 (after\nthe first full year of nongroup marketplace enrollment and\nthe second open enrollment period, 15 months of the Medic-\naid expansion and full nongroup and small group insurance\nmarket reforms). These relative changes are computed across\nthe income and age groups outlined earlier in this report.\nThis step provides an HRMS estimate of changes in insur-\nance coverage among nonelderly adults between 2013 and\nRelChngUninsRate\nUninsRate UninsRa\n=\n- t\nte\nUninsRate\n( )\n.\nStep 4.We multiply the number of individuals in each\nincome and age group that we predict would have been\nuninsured in 2013 based on our CPS model by the\nrelative change in the uninsured rate observed between\nincome and age group. This step provides an estimate,\nconsistent with the CPS framework but relying on rela-\ntive changes we observe in the HRMS, of the number of\npeople uninsured in 2015 under implementation of the\nTable 2.

We assume that the\neffect of the young adult expansion was fully realized by\n2012, a year in which the CPS measured insurance cover-\nage consistent with its preceding years. Therefore, to esti-\nmate the coverage effect of the young adult provisions, we\ncompared the number of uninsured young adults in the\n2012 CPS with the number we predicted would be unin-\nsured in 2012 using our CPS-based predictive model.

We therefore translate these recently observed rela-\ntive changes into the familiar historic levels of CPS cover-\nage. This approach also allows us to compare 2015 predicted\nlevels of uninsurance based on the CPS's long-term trend\nwith more current information from the HRMS, creating a\nconsistent counterfactual: observed levels of uninsurance\nunder the ACA compared with predicted levels of uninsur-\nance had the ACA not been implemented.\nTable 3 provides the uninsurance rates by income and cat-\negory from the HRMS data in the third quarter of 2013\n(before the implementation of the ACA's central coverage\nreforms) and the first quarter of 2015 (after those reforms\nhad been implemented and the first full year of coverage and\nthe second open enrollment period under the reformed non-\ngroup insurance market had been completed).

For example, in\ndecline in the share uninsured of 45.3%.14 For context, the\nHRMS measured a 33.1% decline in the number of unin-\nsured nonelderly adults between the first quarter of 2014 and\nthe first quarter of 2015. The relative decline as measured by\nTable 4 shows the number of predicted uninsured absent\nthe ACA in each income and age category (consistent with\nTable 2), the number of estimated uninsured in 2015 given\nrelative changes observed in the HRMS (consistent with\nsteps 4 and 5 described earlier), and the estimated effect of\nthe early young adult private coverage expansions (consis-\ntent with step 6). Without the ACA, we predict that there\nwould have been 39.3 million uninsured nonelderly adults.\nAbout half of the adults uninsured without reform are low\nincome and another 40% are middle income. Approximately\n22% of uninsured adults without reform would be aged 19 to\nAs a consequence of the main coverage expansions taking\nplace, we estimate that the number of uninsured adults was\nreduced by 16.9 million, to 22.5 million uninsured adults.

By age category, the largest relative decreases\nin the uninsured occur for the 19- to 25-year-olds and the\nLimitations\nAs with all analyses comparing what actually happened with\nestimates of what would have happened in the absence of a\npolicy change, this approach has limitations. First, the HRMS\nestimates of the change in the uninsurance rate, like other\nsurveys, are subject to sampling error.17 For our estimate of a\nreduction of 18.1 million in the number of uninsured people,\na 95% confidence interval based on HRMS sampling vari-\nability alone yields a range from 15.4 to 20.8 million. Second,\nthe counterfactual estimates of uninsurance are subject to\nseveral sources of error, such as sampling errors in the under-\nlying source of uninsurance estimates and errors in the fore-\ncasting model, which are harder to quantify. The forecasting\nmodel to some degree extrapolated from past trends that may\nthe counterfactual forecast grows if we forecast out to subse-\nquent years. Because consistent state-level time series of\nMedicaid eligibility for childless adults are lacking, we could\nnot control for this element of Medicaid policy in the model\n(this limitation would lead to more conservative estimates\nthat understate the effects of the ACA). Also, the model did\nnot explicitly account for health care cost or premium trends\nor pre-ACA trends in cost sharing. These effects are captured\nimplicitly in the linear trends, and the effect of health care\nthe past. Health care cost growth was at relatively low levels\nin recent years, which could lead us to overestimate the\ncounterfactual uninsurance rates, while the sluggish labor\nIncome at or below 138% of FPL\nIncome at or above 400% of FPL\nNote.

Finally, the\npopulation forecasts by income and age are subject to fore-\ncasting errors.\nDiscussion\nTime lags in receiving data from long-standing, large federal\nsurveys complicate real-time estimation of the coverage\neffects of full ACA implementation. Fast-turnaround house-\nhold surveys have stepped in to fill some of the void in data\non recent changes to insurance coverage, but they lack the\nhistorical data that allow analysts to account for trends that\npredate the ACA, economic fluctuations, and public program\nexpansions when predicting how many people would be\nuninsured without comprehensive health care reform. This\napproach allows us to take advantage of long-term trends and\ntimely data on coverage changes to estimate the number of\nuninsured at a point in time and compare that estimate with\nexpectations had the ACA not been in place. The approach\ncan also be applied to other federal data and other timely\nsurveys. Doing so would provide a range of estimates of the\noverall effects of reform.\nUsing the CPS and the HRMS in this fashion, we estimate\nthat as of March 2015, the ACA reduced the number of unin-\nsured adults by 18.1 million compared with the number who\nwould have been uninsured at that time had the law not been\nimplemented. That decline represents a 46% reduction in the\nnumber of nonelderly adults without insurance, compared\nwith the HRMS's observed reduction of approximately 44%\nIt is also helpful to place this estimated reduction in the\nnumber of uninsured in context with Congressional Budget\nOffice (CBO) predictions of the ACA's coverage effects to\nassess the current reduction relative to expectations. The\nCBO's model is based on different data still; the core of their\nmicrosimulation model is the Survey of Income and Program\nParticipation. Thus, their estimated levels of the number of\nuninsured are different from those produced by the CPS. But\nputting expected changes into relative terms can help us\ncompare them with estimates of actual changes in coverage\nusing the data in this analysis.\nAccording to the most recent predictions using the CBO\nmodel, the number of uninsured adults and children was\nexpected to fall by 17 million people in 2015 because of the\nACA, or 33% of the estimated total uninsured absent the\nlion uninsured people includes both nonelderly adults and\nchildren; our analysis includes only adults. Our rough\napproximation of an expected percentage reduction in non-\nelderly uninsured adults consistent with the CBO baseline is\nabout 47%, very close to the relative reduction computed in\nour analysis. The 2009 (pre-ACA) nonelderly uninsured\nwere 70% adults and 30% children.7 Assuming that split\nlion uninsured predicted in the absence of the ACA are\nadults. The increase in coverage under theACAappears, thus\nfar, to be wholly attributable to adults, with children's cover-\nage remaining unchanged.19 Attributing the CBO's predic-\ntion of a 17 million person reduction to the number of\nuninsured adults, a rough calculation of their predicted rela-\ntive change in uninsurance among adults would be about\nTable 4.

Consequently, our analysis indi-\ncates that the second-year effects of the ACA on insurance\ncoverage are in line with those predicted by the CBO; the\nlevel of the change is different because of the differences in\nthe data sets used, but the relative change is consistent with\nthe CBO's prediction.\nThe third year of full ACA implementation, 2016, brings\nsome significant uncertainty related to potential coverage\neffects. First, at least one additional state, Indiana, has cho-\nsen to expand Medicaid under the law, and others might fol-\nlow.As the HRMS has shown, Medicaid expansion decisions\nhave substantially affected how much the ACA can increase\ninsurance in a given state.14 Second, investment in outreach\nand enrollment activities appears to be waning to some\ndegree, and this could affect enrollment and reenrollment in\nMedicaid and marketplace coverage.\nperiod counteracted an overall trend of rising uninsurance\nrates, the forecasted uninsurance rate absent the ACA shows\nlittle change over the 2-year period. Consequently, the practi-\ncal importance of modeling and accounting for the counterfac-\ntual trend turns out to be modest over this period. Over longer\nperiods and periods of economic instability, accounting for the\ncounterfactual becomes more important. When we use our\nmodel to forecast the number of uninsured out to 2020, we\nestimate there would be 42.7 million uninsured adults under a\nbase scenario with 5.1% unemployment, but 46.5 million\nuninsured adults under 9.6% unemployment, such as was\nexperienced in the aftermath of the Great Recession.\n"
