Introduction\nDespite the substantial decline in smoking prevalence over the past few decades, tobacco use\ncontinues to be the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the United States, with nearly\n443,000 deaths occurring annually because of cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke [1].\nSmoking and smokeless tobacco use are initiated and established primarily during adolescence. In fact,\n88% of adult smokers who smoke daily report that they started smoking by the age of 18 years [2\u00ad4].\nCurrently in the U.S., nearly 4,000 people younger than 18 years of age smoke their first cigarette\nevery day, and an estimated 1,000 youth in that age group become new daily cigarette smokers each\nday, translating to nearly 400,000 young people becoming daily smokers each year [3,5]. While\nsmoking has declined among youth since the late 1990s, it is estimated that 4.3% of middle school\nstudents and 15.8% of high school students in the U.S were still smoking in 2011. In addition, the rate\nof decline in smoking prevalence among youth has slowed down considerably in the past nine years [6].\nThe World Health Organization's (WHO) MPOWER package and CDC's Best Practices for\nComprehensive Tobacco Control Programs outlined effective, population-based strategies for\npreventing tobacco use among youths, which include increasing the price of tobacco products,\nemploying media campaigns, limiting advertisements and other promotions, implementing smoke-free\nair policies, and reducing the availability of tobacco products for purchase by youths [7,8].\nWhile previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of these interventions in reducing tobacco\nuse among youth overall, there have been limited studies that examine the potential differential impact\nof these policies on various youth subgroups, defined by Socio-economic status (SES), race/ethnicity,\nand gender. Previous literature shows that there are considerable disparities in tobacco use among\nvarious youth subgroups in the United States. For example, boys have higher rates of tobacco use than\ngirls [6]. In addition, Native Americans/Alaska Natives and whites (especially white males) have the\nhighest prevalence and intensity of smoking rates, and Latinos and Asians have lower prevalence and\nintensity of smoking rates [9]. The differential impact of these tobacco control policies on various\nyouth sub-populations represents an important avenue to reduce tobacco use disparity among youth\nand young adults, as a result, it is of critical importance to understand how each youth subgroup may\nrespond to tobacco control policies in ways that differ from other subgroups.\nThis study fills in this research gap and advances the literature by examining the differential\nresponses to cigarette prices and smoke-free air policies among various American youth sub-populations\ndefined by SES, race/ethnicity, and gender. We use the data from 1991\u00ad2010 Monitoring the Future\nsurveys, a national representative cross-sectional survey of American middle school and high school\nstudents, to examine whether and to what extent each youth subgroup respond to changes in cigarette\nprices and state level smoke-free air policies and to investigate whether the responses differ depending\non the membership of youth subgroups and the tobacco control policy examined.\n1.1. Brief Literature Review\n1.1.1. Studies on the Differential Impact of Price on Youth Smoking\nChaloupka and Pacula were the first to examine the impact of cigarette prices, youth access laws,\nand smoke-free air laws on adolescent smoking prevalence by racial groups [10]. They analyzed the\ntwice as responsive as white adolescents, with respective estimated elasticities of demand of -1.11 and\nGruber and Zinman used several data sources to examine the potential differential impact of\ncigarette prices on youth smoking among different racial groups [11]. The results of their analyses\nwere mixed: using the (MTF) surveys, they found that neither white nor non-white younger teenagers\nwere responsive to price changes. Younger teenagers were defined as individuals in 8th or 10th grade.\nOn the other hand, they found older non-white teenagers to be extremely responsive to changes in\ncigarette prices (the total non-white price elasticity of demand is estimated to be -4.35), while older\nwhite teenagers are not affected significantly by price changes. Older teenagers were defined as those\nin 12th grade. Due to data limitations, they were not able to decompose the non-white racial category\ninto different race/ethnic categories to examine what was driving the implausibly high price elasticity\namong the older nonwhite group. Furthermore, using the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS), they\nfound that both younger and older white teenagers, as well as younger black teenagers, to be\nunresponsive to price changes. However, they found older black teenagers to have an unreasonably\nhigh price elasticity of demand of -17.51 (prevalence elasticity of -9.26 and conditional demand\nelasticity of -8.25). Finally, using the Vital Statistics Natality (VSN) data, they found both younger\nand older black teenage mothers to be unresponsive to cigarette price changes, whereas they found\nboth younger and older white teenage mothers to decrease their consumption of cigarettes significantly\nwhen prices increase. Younger teenagers were defined as individuals aged 13\u00ad16 years, whereas older\nteenagers were defined as individuals aged 17\u00ad18 years in the VSN data. The researchers attribute the\nmixed results and unreasonably high price elasticities for non-whites and blacks on the lack of changes\nin cigarette taxes (i.e., a lack of within-state variation in cigarette prices) during the time that their data\nA third paper by DeCicca and colleagues examined the impact of cigarette prices on smoking\namong white, black and Hispanic adolescents employing the National Educational Longitudinal Study\nof 1988 [12]. Unlike the previous studies that examined the determinants of average smoking and/or\nsmoking prevalence, the study by DeCicca and colleagues examined the determinants of smoking\ninitiation. The researchers found that price was an insignificant determinant of smoking onset between\nwaves of data among white adolescents but had a negative effect on black and Hispanic smoking\nonset. The results implied that a small tax increase of 20 cents would yield a very large reduction in the\nprobability of initiation among Hispanics and a substantial reduction in the probability of initiation for\nAfrican Americans. In particular, a 20-cent increase in the price of cigarettes was found to reduce the\nAmericans.\nUsing several econometric models and expanding the findings of Chaloupka and Pacula, Ding\ninvestigates the difference in price elasticity of demand between females and males, and ethnic groups\nof youth smokers [13]. The study finds that youth are very responsive to changes in prices, with a price\nelasticity of demand of -1.4. Compared to male adolescents, female adolescents were more responsive\nto price changes with an estimated price elasticity of demand of -3.0. In addition, the estimated price\nelasticities of demand for Black and Hispanic adolescents were found to be -9.1 and -2.0,\nrespectively. As a result, Ding argues that taxation is the most effective means of deterring youth\nsmoking initiation, specifically it is most effective for Black and Hispanic youth.\nFocusing on smoking initiation and the role that cigarette taxes and prices, Nonnemaker and\ncolleagues, find an overall small effect for gender, race and ethnicity, and gender-by-race and\nethnicity [14]. The most important finding is that for black youth, both tax and prices affect their\nsmoking initiation rates. Consistent with the results of DeCicca et al., when using baseline weights,\nHispanic youth are also responsive to price and tax policy [12]. When stratifying for gender effects, the\nresults were mixed; in some models females were responsive to price changes and in others they were\nnot. A significant effect was not found for males [14].\nTwo studies by Cawley, Markowitz, and Tauras found higher cigarette prices to decrease the probability\nof smoking initiation among males but have no impact on female smoking initiation [15,16]. These\ngender-specific differences may help explain the mixed and inconclusive evidence of the impact of\nprice on smoking initiation found in previous literature.\n1.1.2. Studies on the Differential Impact of Smoke Free Air Laws on Youth\nAs mentioned before, Chaloupka and Pacula also focus on the effect of smoke free air laws on\nsmoking prevalence. Controlling only for the existence of clear indoor air laws, but not the level of\nenforcement, they find that smoking prevalence rates decrease for white males only [10].\nUsing data from the National Survey of Children's Health, Hawkins and colleagues examine the\nimpact cigarettes excise taxes and smoke free legislation have on tobacco use in households where\nthere are school-age children and adolescents present [17]. They find that stronger tobacco control\npolicies decrease parental tobacco use. It is important to note that reduced parental smoking depends\non which policy is used and how the estimating model is implemented. For white families from lower\nincome groups stronger excise taxes on cigarettes are the most effective way of reducing parental\nA systematic review of the literature, conducted by Thomas and colleagues, found strong evidence\nthat smoking restrictions in workplaces and public places are more effective in reducing smoking\namong advantaged groups. Focusing on youth, the study found that smoking restrictions in schools are\na more effective way of reducing smoking for girls and younger schoolchildren [18].\nTo summarize, despite the significance of this topic, there are few studies to date that have\nexamined the differential impact of tobacco control policies on various youth sub-populations. While\ncigarette taxes/prices, and smoke-free air policies have been shown to reduce youth smoking overall,\nthe empirical evidence of their impact on various youth sub-populations is scarce, and the findings so\nfar from existing literature are mixed and inconclusive.\n2. Methods\nThe data for this study were extracted from the 1991 through 2010 surveys of eighth, tenth, and\ntwelfth grade students conducted by the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan as\npart of the Monitoring the Future (MTF) Project. The modal age of eighth, tenth, and twelfth grade\nstudents is 14, 16, and 18, respectively. MTF has conducted nationally representative surveys of\nand tenth grade students since 1991. These surveys focus on the use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit\ndrugs among adolescents and young adults and related beliefs about these substances. Extensive efforts\nare made by MTF to ensure that the data collected are informative and accurate. Students are assured\nof confidentiality, and all questionnaires were administered by trained interviewers.\nData on each individual's monthly cigarette usage were used to construct two alternative dependent\nvariables: prevalence of cigarette smoking and average monthly cigarette consumption among\nsmokers. Prevalence of cigarette use was a dichotomous indicator equal to one for youths who\nindicated that they smoked cigarettes in the 30 days prior the survey; and otherwise, equal to zero. The\nsecond dependent variable was a quasi-continuous measure of the number of cigarettes smoked during\nthe 30 days prior the survey. This variable was based on a question that asked respondents how\nfrequently they smoked during the past 30 days. Response alternatives and their coded values were less\nVariables that were used to control for other factors thought likely to affect cigarette smoking\nincluded: the age of the respondent in years; gender (female and male-reference category); separate\nindicators for school grade with twelfth grade as the reference category; indicators of race/ethnicity\n(Black, Hispanic, other race, and White-reference category); indicators of maternal education\n(8th grade or less, some high school, high school graduate, some college, graduate degree, and college\ngraduate-reference category); indicators of maternal work status (part-time, not working or missing,\nand full-time-reference category); indicators of living arrangement (live alone, live with father only,\nlive with mother only, live with others that are not mom or dad, live with both mom and dad\u00adreference\ncategory), indicators of weekly income from work and other sources ($0 < income  $10;\n$50 < income  $60; income > $60; and income = 0\u00adreference category), and indicator for living in a\nrural community.\nWe also created mutually exclusive but all-inclusive dichotomous indicators for each year of the\nsurvey and each state in the survey. The dichotomous state indicators capture all time-invariant\nstate-level unobserved heterogeneity and the year indicators account for overall trends in smoking over\ntime. We employed a two-way fixed-effects regression technique in all the analyses. The fixed effects\napproach amounts to including a dichotomous indicator for each state (less one) and each year (less\none) as explanatory variables in the models.\n2.2. Cigarette Prices\nBased on the state in which each youth's school was located, we also merged cigarette prices with\nthe survey data. We obtained price data from the annual Tax Burden on Tobacco. Until 1999, the\nTobacco Institute published state specific cigarette prices as of November 1 of each year. Since then,\nOrzechowski and Walker have published the data. These prices are weighted averages for a pack of\n20 cigarettes and are inclusive of state level excise taxes applied to cigarettes [19]. Because the price\npublished was as of 1 November of each year and the surveys were conducted between February and\nJune of each year, we created a weighted average price for the first six months of each year.\nTo account for changes in the relative price of cigarettes over time, all cigarette prices were deflated by\n2.3. Smoke-Free Air Laws\nUsing state identifiers, we merged a smoke-free air index variable with the survey data. The\nsmoke-free air data were compiled by Gary Giovino and colleagues at the University of Buffalo for the\nImpacTeen project. For each state we know whether or not smoking was banned in private worksite,\nrestaurants, and bars at the time the respondents were being surveyed. The smoke-free air index\nvariable is a simple tally of the number of bans each state had in the aforementioned venues and\ntherefore the range of the smoke-free air index variable is 0\u00ad3. For example, if a state had no bans on\nsmoking in private worksites, restaurants, and bars at the time of the survey, the index variable would\ntake on a value of zero. If on the other hand the state has a ban on smoking in all 3 venues, the index\nwould take on a value of three. The smoke-free air index is very similar to the index variable used by\nTauras and others [20]. Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the key independent variables used in\nthe cigarette demand equations.\n2.4. Statistical Methods\nWe used a modified two-part model of cigarette demand in which smoking prevalence and smoking\nintensity were estimated separately. In the first step, we used logit methods to estimate a cigarette\nsmoking prevalence equation. In the second step, we used a generalized linear model with log link and\ngamma distribution to model the continuous monthly consumption measure. Both equations employed\nweights to account for differential sampling probabilities. The same set of independent variables was\nincluded in both equations.\nTable 2 contains the smoking prevalence equations and Table 3 contains the smoking intensity\nequations. Model 1 in each table is for the full sample of 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students. The model\nspecification includes the following covariates: real price of cigarettes, smoke-free air index, age, and\nindicators for gender, race, grade level, income, rural, maternal employment, maternal education, and\ncurrent living arrangement. In addition, we include dichotomous year indicators and dichotomous state\nindicators as part of our two-way fixed effect approach. Finally, we also included dichotomous\nindicators for respondents with missing data for race, gender, living arrangement, maternal education,\nand income. These missing value indicators were created to prevent the loss of a large number of\nobservations. For example, if mother's education is unknown, each of the mother's education variables\ntake on a value of zero, while an additional indicator, unknown mother's education takes on a value of\none. This missing value indicator takes on a value of zero for all respondents whose mother's\neducation is known.\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics for Key Independent Variables.\nVariable Mean Standard Deviation\nModel 2 of each table is a smoking demand equation for females. The covariates are identical to\nModel 1, however, the dichotomous indicator for gender and the missing gender indicator are omitted\nfrom the specification. Model 3 of each table is a smoking demand equation for males. The covariates\nare identical to Model 2. Model 4 of each table is a smoking demand equation for non-Hispanic\nwhites. The covariates are identical to Model 1, however, the dichotomous indicators for race/ethnicity\nand the missing race ethnicity indicator are omitted from the specification. Model 5, Model 6, and\nModel 7 of each table are smoking demand equations for non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and other\nraces (i.e., not white, black or Hispanic), respectively. The covariates in Models 5\u00ad7 are identical to\nmodel 4. Model 8 of each table is a smoking demand equation for low SES individuals defined by\nparental education (an individual is defined as low-SES if neither parent has a college degree). The\ncovariates are identical to Model 1, however, the dichotomous indicator for maternal education and the\nmissing maternal education indicator are omitted from the specification.\nTable 2.

Results\nPrice is found to have a negative and significant effect on smoking prevalence for the full sample\nand all the subpopulations that we estimated with the exception of the other race subpopulation where\nprice was not significant at conventional levels. Table 4 contains the estimated price elasticities of\ndemand. The estimated prevalence price elasticity of demand for the full sample, males, and females is\ndemand is slightly lower (in absolute value) for Whites, low-SES, and high SES youth than the full\nlargest response to prices with estimated prevalence price elasticities of -0.718 and -0.444, respectively.\nTable 4. Price Elasticity Estimates.\nSub Population Prevalence Price Elasticity Intensity Price Elasticity Total Price elasticity\nOther Race ns ns ns\nns = not significant.\nPrice is also found to have a negative and significant effect on smoking intensity for the full sample\nand the following subpopulations: females, whites, and low SES. Female and low-SES youth were\nfound to be the most price-responsive with respect to smoking intensity. The estimated price elasticity\nof smoking intensity for females and low-SES youth was -0.350 and -0.283, respectively. The price\nelasticity of smoking intensity for the full sample and for whites was smaller in absolute value with\nTable 4 provides the estimated price elasticities generated from our models. Blacks, Females, and\nlow-SES subpopulations have estimated total price elasticities that are larger in absolute value than the\nfull sample. Hispanics have the same price response as the full sample. Males, whites, and high SES\nsubpopulations are found to be less responsive to price than the full sample and those of other races are\nfound not to respond to price changes with respect to either smoking prevalence or intensity.\nSmoke-free air laws are found to have a negative and significant effect on smoking prevalence for\nthe full sample and for high SES and male subpopulations. Smoke-free air laws are also found have a\nnegative a nearly significant (7% significance level of a two-tailed test) effect on whites. Smoke-free\nair laws were found to be negative, but insignificant determinants of smoking prevalence among\nfemales, Blacks, Hispanics, other races, and low-SES sub-populations and to be insignificant\ndeterminants of smoking intensity in all subpopulations.\nTurning to the demographic results, holding other determinants of smoking constant, females are\nsignificantly more likely to smoke than males in the full sample, white subpopulation, and in the low\nSES population. Females are significantly less likely to smoke than males in the black and Hispanic\nsubpopulations. Female smokers in the full sample and in each of the subpopulations smoke\nsignificantly fewer cigarettes than their male counterparts. Older youth are significantly more likely to\nsmoke and conditional on smoking, smoke significantly more on average than younger youth for the\nfull sample and for each of the subpopulations. Black and Hispanic youth are significantly less likely\nto smoke and conditional on smoking, smoke significantly fewer cigarettes on average than white\nyouth for the full sample and for each of the subpopulation not defined by race/ethnicity.\nYouth living in rural areas are significantly more likely to smoke that youth living in urban and\nsuburban areas for the full sample and the following subpopulations: males, blacks, Hispanics, and\nother race. However, for the white subpopulation, youth living in rural areas are significantly less\nlikely to smoke than those living in urban and suburban areas. Moreover, youth smokers residing in\nrural areas smoke significantly more cigarettes on average than those living in urban and suburban\nareas for all subpopulations except whites and low SES where the coefficients are significant at\nconventional levels. Holding age and other covariates constant, 10th graders are significantly more\nlikely to smoke than 12th graders. Moreover, ceteris paribus, 8th and 10th grade smokers smoke more\non average than 12 grade smokers.\nYouth living with both parents are significantly less likely to smoke than any other living\narrangement including living alone, living with just one parent, and living with someone other than a\nparent. This is true for the full sample and all the subpopulations. Youth smokers living with both\nparents were found to smoke significantly fewer cigarettes per month than any other living\narrangement, including living alone, living with just one parent, and living with someone other than a\nparent for the full sample and all subpopulations except the black subpopulation. Black smokers who\nlive by themselves smoke more on average than those who live with both parents, but black smokers\nwho with their mothers only smoke fewer cigarettes on average than black smokers who live with both\nparents.\nYouth who generate an income from work and other sources are significantly more likely to smoke\nthan youth who do not receive an income. This is true for all subpopulations and each income level\nwith the exception of blacks who earn less than $10 per week, where the result is insignificant. Youth\nsmokers who have low income levels per week typically smoke fewer cigarettes on average than those\nwho do not receive an income. This is true for the full sample and all subpopulations for youth making\nless than $20 per week and for most subpopulations making less than $40 per week. However, youth\nsmokers who have relatively high income levels (i.e., incomes > $60 per week) smoke more on\naverage than smokers who do not receive any income. This is true for the full sample and all\nsubpopulations with the exception of blacks.\nMother's education is a strong determinant of smoking for the full sample, females, males, and\nwhites. In particular for these populations, youths whose mothers have less than 8th grade education,\nsome high school, a high school degree, or some college are significantly more likely to smoke and\nconditional on smoking smoke at higher intensity levels than youths whose mothers have a college\ndegree. The results with respect to Blacks, Hispanics, and other races are more mixed.\nMother's work status is also a strong determinant of youth smoking. In particular, youth are\nsignificantly less likely to smoke if their mothers do not work or work only part time compared to\nyouths whose mothers work full time. This is true for the full sample and all subpopulations with the\nexception of blacks. The results are not as strong with respect to smoking intensity. For the full\nsample, females, males, and whites, youth smokers whose mothers work part time smoke significantly\nfewer cigarettes on average than youth smokers whose mothers work full time.\n4. Conclusions\nCigarette prices are found to be inversely related to smoking for the full sample and all\nsubpopulations with the exception of one subpopulation--other race. The estimated total price\nelasticity for the full sample of youth is -0.446, implying that a 10% increase in the price of cigarettes\nwill reduce the overall number of cigarettes consumed by youth by approximately 4.5%. Blacks,\nfemales, and low-SES subpopulations are found to have the largest overall price response. Blacks and\nHispanics have the largest prevalence response with price elasticities of smoking prevalence estimated\nto be -0.718 and -0.444, respectively. Females have the largest intensity response with a price\nelastitity of intensity estimated to be -0.350.\nBlacks and Hispanics having a larger prevalence price response than other subpopulations is\nconsistent with the work of DeCicca and colleagues who examined the determinants of smoking\ninitiation by youth of different race and ethnicities using data extracted from the 1988\u00ad1992 NELS [12].\nThey found price to have a sizeable negative impact on Hispanics and African American smoking\ninitiation decisions, while having an insignificant influence on smoking initiation decisions among\nWhites. It is also consistent with Farrelly et al. who looked at adult smoking in the US [21].\nSpecifically, Farrelly and colleagues found African Americans to be more than twice as price-responsive\nas whites and Hispanics to be more than six times as price-responsive as whites.\nThe finding that low-SES are more price responsive than the full sample is also consistent with\nFarrelly and his colleagues' findings for adults [21]. Farrelly et al. found low income individuals to be\nmore than four times as responsive to changes in cigarette prices as high income individuals [21].\nIn particular, the authors found adults with incomes at or below the median income for the sample to\nhave a total price elasticity of demand of -0.43 and those with incomes above the median in the\nsample to have a total price elasticity of demand equal to -0.10.\nThe finding that females are more price responsive than males is consistent with studies conducted\nin the United Kingdom, but for the most part, inconsistent with studies conducted in the North\nAmerica. A preponderance of the studies conducted in North American countries concluded that\nfemale cigarette consumption is less responsive to changes in cigarette prices than is male\nconsumption. Whereas, studies conducted in the UK have generally found female consumption of\ncigarettes to be more responsive to price changes than male consumption [22].\nFinally, smoke-free air laws are found to have a negative and significant effect on smoking\nprevalence for the full sample and for high SES and male subpopulations. Smoke-free air laws are also\nfound have a negative a nearly significant (7% significance level) effect on whites. Smoke-free air\nlaws were found not to be strong determinants of smoking prevalence among females, Blacks,\nHispanics, other races, and low-SES sub-populations and to be insignificant determinants of smoking\nintensity in all subpopulations. While the direct impact of these laws is likely limited given that youth\nare less likely to be frequent some of the venues covered by them, the more comprehensive laws are\nlikely to reflect the social norms around smoking which do have some impact on youth smoking,\noverall and in at least some subpopulations.\nThe results indicate that smoking by youth subpopulations defined by gender, race/ethnicity, and\nsocio-economic status responds differently to changes in cigarette prices and smoke-free air laws in the\nUnited States. These differential policy effects can be used to address disparities in youth smoking as\npart of a comprehensive tobacco control program.\n"
