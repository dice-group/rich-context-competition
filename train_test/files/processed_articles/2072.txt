An increasing number of studies are\nreporting genes influencing human longevity including\ncytochrome P450 genes, mitochondrial DNA and genes\ninvolved in lipoprotein metabolism and coagulation.1\nHowever, only the Apolipoprotein E gene has consistently\nbeen associated with age-related changes in frequency.2 \u00ad 4\nRecent studies performed a genome-wide linkage scan in\nlong-lived individuals and provided evidence for a locus for\nlongevity at chromosome 4 near microsatellite marker\nsomal Triglyceride Transfer Protein (MTP) as the gene\n*Correspondence: Dr L Bathum, Department of Clinical Biochemistry,\nOdense University Hospital, Sdr.

MTP is an investigational\ntarget for a new generation of lipid-lowering drugs and has\nreached trials in animal models.9\nIt is important to point out that the finding by Geesa-\nman et al (2003) was not confirmed in the French data\nreported in the same paper. Given this discrepancy, there is\na need for independent studies to confirm the reported\nassociation between MTP and exceptional longevity using\nlarge and well-defined samples and preferable longitudinal\nstudies. In the Danish 1905 cohort study, we assessed the\nparticipated in the survey, which included an interview,\nphysical and cognitive tests, as well as collection of\nbiological material (1651 participants provided a DNA\nsample). Hence, they were 92\u00ad93 years when they entered\nthe study and have been followed regarding mortality until\nJanuary 2005. We examined the two reported SNPs in the\ncomplete Danish 1905 cohort study. If MTP does infact\nplay a role in human longevity, a longitudinal study of\nnonagenariansFa population with a very high mortality\nand 6.5 years of follow-upFshould be able to detect a\nmortality difference. To rule out that a selection has taken\nplace before the age of 92 years, a younger control group of\nincluded.\nMethods\nThe participants were selected from two major surveys\nconducted by our group, the 1905 cohort, all Danes\nwhen they were 92\u00ad93 years and the study of Middle-Aged\nDanish twins (MADT), a random sample of twin pairs\nThese studies comprised a home-based 2-h multidimen-\nsional interview and the sampling of DNA by means of a\nfinger prick or a cheek swab.

The\nTaqman technology was used to genotype for the two\npolymorphisms related to MTP. Primers and probes were\ndesigned using Primer Expresss software (Applied Bio-\nCTCCTCTGTGCTGATT. All probes contain minor groove\nbinder groups and a nonflourescent quencher attached to\ntheir 30 ends. The real-time analyses were performed at the\nABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System equipped with\nthe allelic discrimination module (software version 1.7;\nApplied Biosystems). DNA was amplified in a total volume\nof 10 ml containing 5 ml Taqman Universal Master Mix\n(Applied Biosystems), 900 nM of each primer (DNA Tech-\nnology), 200 nM of each probe (Applied Biosystems) and\n24 of the middle-aged twins could not be genotyped for\none or both polymorphisms due to a poor quality of DNA.\nOnly subjects that could be genotyped for both poly-\nmorphisms are used in the statistical analysis. Four subjects\ngave unclear genotyping results for H95Q and exon three\nin the MTP gene was sequenced. A missense mutation\nunder the probe, E98D, was found in these samples. Only\nthree of the expected four haplotypes were seen as\npreviously been detected.\nStatistical analyses\nThe participants were followed from the date of blood\nsampling and until emigration, death or end of study\nperiod (January 2005). Information on emigration or death\nwas retrieved from the Danish Central Population Register,\nwhich is continuously updated.

The risk haplotype is in Hardy\u00ad\nWeinberg equilibrium in our cohorts for both the indivi-\ndual SNPs and the combined haplotypes.\nOne explanation for the discrepancy between the study\nby Geesaman et al,7 and our data could be that the\nAmerican population is less homogeneous than ours. A\nmajor problem in genetic association studies is the failure\nto adequately match the genetic backgrounds of the cases\nand controls, and in the study of Geesaman et al, the cases\nand controls were born more than 50 years apart. The\nDanish population is known to be genetically and\nethnically very homogeneous and therefore well suited\nfor association studies in different age groups. The middle-\naged twins were born and grew up in Denmark. Very little\nimmigration has taken place in Denmark in the years\nDenmark in the cohorts comprised by these surveys, the\nstudy and 80% in the middle-aged twins) and the high\ngenetic homogeneity in the Danish population, minimize\npopulation stratification as well as selection bias within the\npopulation. Furthermore, we have the ability to conduct a\nlongitudinal study on nonagenarians as we have followed\npopulation stratification. And the results all point in the\nsame directionFno haplotype-dependent mortality differ-\nence in the 1905 cohort and no significant difference in\nfrequency of the tested SNPs between the middle-aged\npopulation and the 1905 cohort. However, although the\nDanish population is very homogeneous, no cross-genera-\ntional comparisons are necessarily immune from stratifica-\ntion and it is therefore possibleFbut very unlikelyFthat\nour results are false-negative due to stratification.\nOur population is slightly younger than that of Geesa-\nman et al.7 Their long-lived individuals had a mean age\nof 100.8 years. Participants in our study population were\nthe end of follow-up - and intuitively this seems to be an\nalready much selected population, close to becoming\ncentenarians. However, being 92\u00ad93 is only `half way to\nbecoming a centenarian' in terms of selection: only about\nwho will celebrate a 100-year birthday. Hence, the Danish\n1905 cohort provides a powerful opportunity to test for\nselection against a genotype marker and even though our\ncases are slightly younger, this large study of 1651 subjects\naged 92\u00ad93 years should be able to detect a significant\ndifference. As can be seen from Figures 1 and 2, there is no\nsignificant survival difference between those carrying the\nsuggested risk allele and those without this allele. In males\nthere is even a smallFnot significantFtendency to a\nbetter survival of those homozygous for the suggested risk\nallele.\nThe finding of the linkage to exceptional longevity at\nchromosome 4 near the MTP gene was the result of a\ngenome-wide scan in 308 extremely long-lived individuals\nin 137 sib ships with the use of non-parametric linkage\nanalysis.5 Longevity is a complex trait and is probably\nmodulated by multiple genes. Our group has previously\nshown that mapping a rare dominant genetic variation\nthat reduces hazard of death by half with the use of\nnonparametric linkage analysis would require a sample of\nmore than 600 long-lived pairs15 to ensure acceptable\npower. In the case of localization of recessive genes, the\npower is larger and the method is able to localize recessive\ngenes with relatively small effects with the same sample\nsize (600 pairs). So although the power issue may depend\nheavily on the true genetic nature in maintaining survival,\nthe results from small-scale sib-pair investigations, such as\nthe study of Puca et al, 5 should be interpreted with caution\nand should be subject to independent replications.

The results from Geesaman could be\ncaused by random chanceFsimply a false-positive fluctua-\ntionFalthough true population genetic differences or\ngene\u00adenvironment differences between the two popula-\ntions cannot be ruled out.\nTo conclude, a previous study7 reported a haplotype\nmarker within the MTP gene as a modifier of human\nlifespan, but our confirmatory study does not support an\nassociation between extreme longevity and the Microso-\nmal Transfer Protein. Replication studies are crucial to cope\nwith the false positive results in mapping human complex\ntrait genes. The fact that our results, based on a large and\nwell-defined sample, fail to confirm the association\nbetween the MTP gene and longevity reported by Geesa-\nman et al illustrates the necessity of replication studies in\nmapping genes which affect human longevity.\n"
