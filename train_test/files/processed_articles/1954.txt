Using data from the National Study of Midlife Development in the United States and the National\nStudy of Daily Experience substudy, we identified curvilinear relations between adult reports of parental affection in childhood\nand adult diurnal cortisol rhythms. Reports of both very affectionate and very unaffectionate parental relations in childhood were\nassociated with flatter diurnal rhythms, suggesting potential dysregulation of the HPA axis at both extremes of family environ-\nment. Participants in the bottom tertile showed more signs of HPA axis dysregulation than those in the top tertile. We discuss\nprocesses that may underlie these effects, with reference to the theory of allostatic load.\nKeywords: early environment; stress; HPA axis\nINTRODUCTION\nBoth animal and human research indicates that early life\nexperiences can affect health trajectories across the lifespan.\nConverging evidence suggests that the hypothalamic pituit-\nary adrenal (HPA) axis may be critically involved in the\npathways that explain these relations. The HPA axis plays a\ncentral role in managing stress. Corticotropin-releasing hor-\nmone, produced in the paraventricular nuclei of the hypo-\nthalamus, stimulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic\nhormone (ACTH) by the anterior pituitary, resulting in\nthe release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal glands (e.g.\ncortisol in humans). Although these processes characterize\nthe normative functioning of the system, frequent and\nlong-lasting elevations in glucocorticoids, as occur in chron-\nically or recurrently stressful environments or which may\noccur in organisms that have developed highly stress-reactive\nbiological stress regulatory systems, can compromise HPA\naxis functioning and ultimately health; moreover, as the\nsystem loses its resiliency in response to chronic or recurring\nstress, hypocortisolism, reflecting a reduced ability of the\nsystem to respond to challenges, may occur (McEwen,\n1998). In addition to alterations in reactivity, the diurnal\nrhythm of cortisol may change in response to repeated chal-\nlenge. Cortisol normally rises upon awakening, declines over\nthe course of the day, flattening out in the late afternoon and\nevening, with a rise in the later evening. Dysregulation of the\nHPA axis in response to repeated challenge may be mani-\nfested in a flatter diurnal pattern.\nAnimal research indicating life-long beneficial effects\nof early environment, in particular maternal licking and\ngrooming following separation stress in infant rats, suggests\nthat these beneficial effects are mediated through the HPA\naxis. Studies conducted with clinical samples in humans are\nalso supportive of this pathway. In a review of the effects of\nchildhood trauma on the neurobiology of mood and anxiety\ndisorders, Heim and Nemeroff (2001) concluded that early\nlife stress can induce long-term hyperreactivity of the CRH\nsystem. De Bellis and colleagues (De Bellis et al., 1994) found\nattenuated plasma ACTH but robust plasma cortisol re-\nsponses to CRH stimulation in sexually abused girls, suggest-\ning a dysregulation of the HPA axis at the level of the\npituitary. Studies have also documented hypocortisolism in\nhighly stressed populations as well, perhaps as a downstream\nconsequence of long-term exposure to maltreatment\nThat is, people exposed to the chronic stress of maltreatment\nmay initially respond with hypercortisolism, which eventu-\nally gives way to hypocortisolism, as the HPA axis loses its\nMuch of the research conducted to date has examined\nthese processes in clinical populations or in populations at\nrisk for psychopathology. However, evidence is mounting\nthat similar, if lesser, compromise of HPA axis pathways\nmay be implicated in `risky families', that is, families char-\nacterized by conflict, cold non-nurturant behavior, or neg-\nlect, but not by trauma and abuse (Repetti et al., 2002). For\nexample, a study of 264 offspring from families characterized\nby few positive interactions and a high level of negative\ninteractions found an association between a poor family en-\nvironment and abnormal cortisol profiles, which led to di-\nminished immunity and frequent illness (Flinn and England,\nThis work was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of\nHuman and Health Services [P01-AG020166].

Granger et al. (1998) reported that\nchildren's basal cortisol levels were associated with a family\nenvironment high in aggression, anger and conflict. Spangler\net al. (1994) found that maternal insensitivity to her child\nduring play was tied to an increase in the child's cortisol\nduring free play. In a study of responses to laboratory\nstress challenges, Taylor et al. (2004) reported that young\nadult offspring from risky families were more likely to\nshow a flat cortisol trajectory across the stress tasks com-\npared to people from more nurturant families, who showed\na lower baseline cortisol level, an elevation in response to the\nstress task, and a return to baseline following completion of\nthe stress tasks. In a review of the evidence, Chorpita and\nBarlow (1998) reported that families characterized by low\nlevels of warmth and/or high levels of restrictive, controlling\nparenting had offspring with disruptions in HPA axis func-\ntioning in response to stress, leading to increased CRH and\nhypercortisolism. As noted, the long-term pattern may be\nhypocortisolism, reflected in a muted response to stress or\na flatter diurnal rhythm in response to chronic activation of\nthe HPA system (McEwen, 1998; see also Gunnar and\nfects of early environment on HPA stress responses may\noccur across the spectrum of early environment quality\nand involve multiple parameters of the HPA axis, as well\nas alterations in its functioning over time.\nMuch animal and human evidence suggests a linear rela-\ntionship, such that a nurturant familial environment fosters\ngood health and wellbeing and, with increasing conflict, neg-\nlect, cold and non-nurturant behavior or abuse, poor mental\nand physical health trajectories. The human clinical litera-\nture, however, suggests that overly solicitous and protective\nmaternal or familial behavior can have adverse effects on\noffspring, including a low threshold for fear, limited explora-\ntory behavior, a risk of anxiety disorders, and a potential\nexacerbation of psychopathology (e.g. Chorpita et al., 1998;\nas these suggest that there may be a curvilinear relationship\nbetween early childhood environment and adult stress re-\nsponses, with signs of compromise evident at both extremes.\nThe HPA axis may be implicated in these relations.\nHPA axis regulation is important for understanding tra-\njectories of aging across the lifespan. Dysregulation of the\nHPA axis is one of the signs of allostatic load (McEwen,\n1998), which is believed to represent an accelerated aging\nprocess. That is, older adults show many of the changes\nidentified early in offspring from poor functioning families,\npresumably because of the cumulative effects of stress across\nthe lifespan. To the extent that accelerated trajectories of\naging can be identified early in life and from specific\nearly-life indicators, such as family environment, risk factors\nfor accelerated aging may be better understood and health\ndisorders associated with allostatic load may be anticipated,\nwith appropriate diagnostic and preventive efforts underta-\nken with relevant populations.\nThe National Study of Midlife Development in the United\nStates (MIDUS) investigations (Midlife in the US) provide\nan unparalleled opportunity to pursue the potential role of\nthe early environment in the functioning of the HPA axis in\nadulthood. The sample size is substantial, which permits as-\nsessment of potential curvilinear relationships; the childhood\nfamily environments, as reported by respondents, range\nfrom very warm and nurturant to abusive; and, in contrast\nto much of the previous literature, the diurnal rhythm of\ncortisol was assessed, making possible a fine-grained exam-\nination of HPA functioning. Accordingly, we analyzed data\nfrom the MIDUS, which included salivary cortisol assess-\nments in a sub-study, the National Study of Daily\nExperiences (NSDE).\nMETHODS\nThe MIDUS study, initiated in 1995, was designed to deter-\nmine how social, psychological and behavioral factors\ninter-relate to influence mental and physical health. The\nfirst wave (MIDUS I) collected socio-demographic and\nfrom a representative sample of English-speaking, non-\ninstitutionalized adults residing in the contiguous 48 states,\nwhose household included at least one telephone (recruited\nby random digit dialing), with oversampling of five metro-\npolitan areas, twin pairs and siblings. Eighty nine percent of\nthe sample (N \u00bc 6329) completed both a phone interview\nand a detailed self-administered questionnaire (Brim et al.,\nIn the second wave of data collection (MIDUS II), a\nrandom sub-sample also completed short telephone inter-\nviews about their daily experiences over eight consecutive\ndays and collected saliva (for cortisol assessments) on four\nof the eight days, as part of the second wave of the NSDE. Of\npants had usable cortisol and sampling time data for 6071\ndays. Missing data brought the final sample for these ana-\nChildhood psychosocial environment\nData on psychosocial conditions in childhood were obtained\nin MIDUS I, using a combination of telephone interview and\nself-administered questionnaires. This included information\non family composition, parental divorce and death, family\nsocio-economic status, quality of relationship with each\nparent and levels of affection received from each parent.\nParticipants rated how much (1\u00ad4: for `not at all', `a little',\n`some', `a lot') each of the following six items was true sep-\narately for each parent: `how much did he/she understood\nyour problems and worries', `could you confide in him/her\nabout things that were bothering you', `how much love and\naffection did he/she give you', `how much time and attention\ndid he/she give you when you needed it', `how much effort\ndid he/she put into watching over you and making sure you\nhad a good upbringing' and `did he/she teach you about life'.\nMeans over the six items were computed, separately\nfor mother and father to create maternal affection and\nWe then averaged the two to create a parental affection\nvariable.\nCortisol\nAssessments of diurnal cortisol derive from a saliva sam-\npling protocol that included four samples per day (waking,\n\u00fe30 min, before lunch and before bedtime) on each of\n4 days. Data on the exact time of each saliva sample\nwere obtained from nightly telephone interviews by study\nstaff and on a paper\u00adpencil log sent with the collection kit.\nIn addition, a quarter of the respondents receive a `Smart\nBox' to store their salivettes, with a computer chip that\nrecords the time of box opening and closing. Salivettes\nwere frozen (at \u00ad608C) for storing and shipping. Cortisol\nconcentrations (in nmol/l) were measured with a commer-\ncially available luminescence immunoassay (IBL, Hamburg,\nGermany).\nWe began with an initial NSDE sample of 1605 partici-\npants with 6383 days of cortisol data. We dropped data from\nwhen the third cortisol sample was 10 nmol or more higher\nthan the second sample (since this might reflect a\ntime-recording error for one of the saliva samples or saliva\nsample contamination with food), 49 days when respondents\nwoke after 11 a.m., and an additional 28 days for respond-\nents who were awake more than 20 h on a given day. This left\n24 284 saliva measurements. After excluding those with miss-\ning covariate data or cortisol values outside of the normal\nrange (i.e. >60 nmol), we were left with a final analytic\nmeasurements.\nCovariates\nAge at MIDUS II (in years), ethnicity and gender were\nself-reported. Body mass index (BMI) in kg/m2 was calcu-\nlated from self-reported weight and height. Participants re-\nported chronic conditions (from a list of 28 major\nconditions that included heart attack, stroke, hypertension,\ndiabetes, cancer), and a simple count of chronic conditions\nwas created. Depressed affect was measured in terms of a\ncount of the number of `yes' responses from a list of seven\nitems (i.e. during two weeks in past 12 months, when you\nfelt sad, blue or depressed; did you lose interest in most\nthings; feel more tired out or low on energy than is usual;\nlose your appetite; appetite increased; have more trouble\nfalling asleep than usual; have a lot more trouble\nconcentrating than usual; feel down on yourself, no good,\nor worthless; think a lot about death).\nAnalysis\nBecause previous studies indicate that cortisol rhythms are\ndriven by time elapsed since awakening and less by clock\nas a function of time since waking. Participants had been\ninstructed to take the second saliva sample of the day 30 min\nafter waking, but there was variability in actual timing of the\nsecond sample: 6% < 25 min after waking, 30% more than\nwaking. There was more variability in the timing of the\nthird (pre-lunch) and fourth saliva samples (bedtime); we\nexploited this variability in collection times to explore mean\ncortisol trajectories over the course of the day.\nWe first plotted mean cortisol and mean of log (corti-\nsol \u00fe 1) over the study sample as a function of time since\nwaking (in 15 min intervals) to examine the general shape\nof the daily cortisol trajectory. A visual comparison of the\ntwo plots indicated that the mean log (cortisol \u00fe 1) trajectory\nhas less variability around straight-line segments (than the\nmean cortisol trajectory) and represented a better fit for\npiece-wise linear, growth curve modeling. Accordingly, we\nchose to model log (cortisol \u00fe 1). We examined mean trajec-\ntories over a series of demographic strata (including age, edu-\ncation, income, race and sex), waking time (before or after the\nsample median waking time, 6:40 a.m.), and bedtime (before\nor after the sample median bedtime, 10:30 p.m.), to confirm\nthat the general shape of the diurnal trajectories did not vary\nby basic demographics (e.g. age, sex) and/or waking time and\nbedtime. The general form of the diurnal cortisol trajectories\nand the location of inflexion points were very consistent\nacross these groups, with every group showing a morning\npeak 30 min after waking, then a rapid decline from the\npeak for 4 h, followed by a more gradual decline for 10.5 h,\nand a final upturn late in the day. Accordingly, we decided to\nmodel the diurnal cortisol trajectories by growth curves, using\nfour linear splines with three knots, fixed at 0.5, 4.5 and 15 h.\nWe used random effects models to fit the cortisol growth\ncurves and to study associations between the primary pre-\ndictor (parental affection) and slopes of the four piece-wise\ngender, race (white vs non-white) and weekend day (if em-\nployed). To account for the correlation between repeated\nmeasures of cortisol in the same individual (between 1 and\n16 measurements per person), we included random effects\nfor the intercept (wakening value of cortisol) and all fours\nslopes. To allow for correlation between members of the\nsame family (twin pairs and siblings), we included an add-\nitional hierarchical level with random intercept.\nModel-predicted intercept and slopes were used to estimate\nmean values for other trajectory parameters, such as the\nmagnitude of the daily peak, the nightly nadir, and the\ntotal exposure over 20 h, or area under the curve (AUC).\nThese were calculated as:\nPeak \u00bc Intercept \u00fe 0:5 \u00c2 slope1\n,\nNadir \u00bc Peak \u00fe 4 \u00c2 slope2\n,\n\u00de\n\u00feNadir\u00de\n\u00de:\nand Slope4\nrefer to the model-\nestimated mean slopes (per hour) for the four piece-wise\nlinear segments of the trajectory. Stata version 10 was used\nfor all analyses, with robust error variance estimation.\nIn order to account for possible non-linearity in relation-\nships between parental affection and cortisol rhythms, we\ninitially examined rhythm parameters by deciles of affection.\nBased on resulting evidence of non-linearity (with poorer\nrhythms among those in the top and bottom tertiles), tertiles\nof parental affection form the basis for results reported\nbelow.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 provides descriptive information about the partici-\npants. The age range of participants at the time of the\nBy MIDUS II, mean age was 56.8 years. There were more\nwomen than men; the sample was largely White and rela-\ntively well-educated (see Table 1). There was substantial vari-\nance in the parental affection scale (range, 1\u00ad4): mean was\n2.97, s.d.: 0.65. The cutoffs for the bottom and top tertiles\nFigure 1 shows the mean of log (cortisol \u00fe 1) in the com-\nplete study sample, as a function of time since waking (in\nIn the complete sample, mean awakening value of log (cor-\ntisol \u00fe 1) was 2.67, mean slope for the morning rise was\n\u00fe0.73 per hour, mean slope for the first rapid decline\nphase was \u00ad0.238 per hour, mean decline in the afternoon/\nevening phase was \u00ad0.089 per hour, and the mean slope in\nthe late evening phase was \u00fe0.030 per hour. Corresponding\nmean values for peak, nadir and AUC, as predicted by the\nmean growth curve model, are listed in Table 2.

In addition, both low\nand high levels of parental affection were associated with\nslower morning rise (less positive slope1\n), compared to aver-\nage levels of affection (see Table 3 and Figure 2). This trans-\nlated to significantly lower cortisol peaks in the bottom and\ntop tertile of parental affection, compared to the middle\ntertile (Table 3 and Figure 3). In addition, those in the\nbottom tertile of parental affection also had marginally\nslower decline from the peak (more positive slope2\n) and\nsignificantly slower rises in the late evening (less positive\n). Thus, diurnal cortisol rhythms were flatter (less\nmorning rise, lower peak and less late evening rise) for\nthose reporting the lowest levels of parental affection, with\nMean Log Cort+1\nTime in 15 minute intervals\nFig. 1.

These findings were\nunchanged by additional controls for reports of parental di-\nvorce before age 17 and childhood socio-economic status\n(assessed by education level of mother and father) as well\nas measures of adult chronic conditions, depressive symp-\ntoms and BMI.\nDISCUSSION\nAnalyses of the MIDUS and NSDE datasets suggest curvi-\nlinear relationships between levels of parental affection\nand several parameters of the diurnal cortisol rhythm,\nnamely afternoon/evening decline and late evening rise.\nSpecifically, respondents who reported either very high or\nvery low affection in childhood had flatter cortisol rhythms,\ncompared to those who reported moderate levels of affec-\ntion. Although previous animal and human research had\nsuggested a potential linear relationship between familial en-\nvironment and adverse changes in HPA axis functioning, the\nsuggestion of a curvilinear relationship is supported by the\nhuman clinical literature on overly solicitous, overly protect-\nive maternal hovering and its impact on fear, anxiety and\nexploratory behavior in offspring.\nDespite the evidence for curvilinear relationships, evi-\ndence of HPA axis dysregulation is more evident in the\nlowest tertile of family affection than in the highest. Those\nparticipants reporting the lowest levels of parental affection\nshowed diurnal cortisol rhythms that were flatter, marked by\nslower morning rise, a lower peak and less late evening rise,\nas well as marginally slower decline from the peak. These\nfindings are suggestive of a sluggish diurnal rhythm, which\nmay reflect hypocortisolism. Note that hypocortisolism in\nresponse to maltreatment in childhood has been reported\nby other researchers (Gunnar and Vasquez, 2001; Gunnar\nand Donzella, 2002). The present study departs from those\nsamples in important ways, however. Specifically, the current\nsample is adults, whereas previous literature has focused on\ndiurnal rhythms in children. In addition, the current meas-\nures focused on parental affection and support (the positive\nside of parental behavior), whereas previous studies from\nmaltreated samples and from risky families (Taylor et al.,\n2004) have focused on degrees of maltreatment (the negative\nside of parental behavior). Accordingly, it is possible that the\nfine-grained analysis of the effects of negative parental be-\nhaviors is not well-captured in the present sample, just as a\nprevious focus on risky families and maltreated children may\nnot have focused sufficiently on variability in the positive\nside of parental behaviors, thus potentially explaining the\nfailure to find curvilinear relationships. Nonetheless, the sug-\ngestion of HPA axis compromise, as reflected in alterations\nin diurnal rhythms in maltreated samples, risky families, and\nthe present study is relatively consistent.\nWhat are the pathways by which early family environment\nmay alter the functioning of the HPA axis? McEwen\n(1998) proposed an allostatic load model, whereby repeated\nsocial challenges in a child's environment disrupt basic\nhomeostatic processes that may lead to cascading, potentially\nTable 3.

As noted, these results suggest\nthe possibility of accelerated aging, consistent with\nMcEwen's (1998) allostatic load model. Consistent with\nthe fact that glucocorticoid receptors are found in the cells\nof almost all tissues in the body (resulting in cortisol's having\na range of physiologic effects; Munck et al., 1984; De Kloet,\n2004), growing evidence links dysregulations in HPA axis\nregulation to a range of negative health outcomes. For ex-\nample, excessive glucocorticoid action has been shown to\nhave a role in the development of insulin resistance\nis associated with other cardiovascular risk factors such as\ncentral obesity (Rosmond et al., 1998) and hypertension\n(Whitworth et al., 1995). Chronically higher levels of cortisol\nhave also been postulated to result in a reduction of cortisol's\nability to inhibit the action of pro-inflammatory cytokines\nhas also begun to link greater cortisol exposure to increased\natherosclerosis (Dekker et al., 2008) with additional data\nlinking higher wakening cortisol and morning cortisol rise\namong women with greater intima media thickness (cross-\nsectionally; Eller et al., 2001) and with greater 2-year pro-\nIt may be the case that intrusive and overly solicitous fa-\nmilial behavior has some of these same effects.\nLimitations\nA limitation of the present study is the fact that adult re-\nspondents reported on their childhood experiences retro-\nspectively, raising concerns about the validity of reports.\nHowever, a number of studies have established the reliability\nand validity of retrospective reports of parental support and\n(Dill et al., 1991). This evidence may mute concerns about\nthe reliability and validity of childhood reports. In addition,\nwe have demonstrated high levels of independent corrobor-\nation from 917 twin pairs in MIDUS for (i) reports of child-\nhood events of major significance, such as divorce and\ndeath, (ii) reports of family poverty and residential stability\nand (iii) social class, with reliability in the 93\u00ad98% range\n(A.S.Karlamangla et al., unpublished data).\nMoreover, although recollections of childhood environ-\nment certainly include participants' internal reconstructions\nof the family environment, it may be the psychological\nimpact of the family environment that is most important\nfor affecting biology. Previous research from our laboratories\nand those of other investigators indicate that recalled child-\nhood variables are strongly related to adult neural responses\nto threat (Taylor et al., 2006a), biological variables (Luecken,\ncardiovascular risk factors (Brunner et al., 1999; Karlamangla\nadult physical health conditions (Lundberg, 1997; Draper\nafter controlling for age, gender and adult socio-economic\nstatus. Thus, there is substantial evidence linking retrospect-\nive reports of childhood family environment to altered bio-\nlogical stress regulatory systems and to related health\noutcomes.\nCONCLUSION\nThe early environment has effects on HPA axis functioning\nacross the lifespan and on corresponding risks of illness. The\npresent study reports evidence from the MIDUS and NSDE\ninvestigations to suggest that the relationship between par-\nental affection and the diurnal cortisol rhythm may be curvi-\nlinear. Adult offspring from both harsh and highly solicitous\nfamilies have flatter diurnal rhythms, suggesting that the di-\nurnal rhythm of cortisol may be dysregulated at both ex-\ntremes of family affection. Consistent with previous\nresearch, however, evidence at the lower levels of parental\naffection appears in this sample to be more consistently\nassociated with evidence of HPA axis dysregulation than at\nthe higher end of familial affection.\nREFERENCES\nBloch, M., Peleg, I., Koren, D., Aner, H., Klein, E.
