    "abstract": "Abstract\nCross-cultural studies of speech acts in different linguistic contexts might have interesting implications for language\nresearchers and practitioners. Drawing on the Speech Act Theory, the present study aimed at conducting a comparative\nstudy of request speech act in Persian and English. Specifically, the study endeavored to explore the request strategies used\nin daily interactions of Persian and English speakers based on directness level and supportive moves. To this end, English and\nPersian TV series were observed and requestive utterances were transcribed. The utterances were then categorized based\non Blum-Kulka and Olshtain's Cross-Cultural Study of Speech Act Realization Pattern (CCSARP) for directness level and\ninternal and external mitigation devises. According to the results, although speakers of both languages opted for the direct\nlevel as their most frequently used strategy in their daily interactions, the English speakers used more conventionally indirect\nstrategies than the Persian speakers did, and the Persian speakers used more non-conventionally indirect strategies than the\nEnglish speakers did. Furthermore, the analyzed data revealed the fact that American English speakers use more mitigation\ndevices in their daily interactions with friends and family members than Persian speakers.\n",

Speech acts in\ngeneral and requests as one of the important speech acts are\nvery vulnerable to be misunderstood. It is believed that prag-\nmatic errors are considered by native speakers to be more\nserious than phonological or syntactic errors (Kiok, 1995;\nTo make appropriate requests in another language, learn-\ners need to acquire both pragmatic and socio-pragmatic\nknowledge to avoid being considered rude or impolite by\nnative speakers. So it seems vital for learners of a language\nto acquire sufficient knowledge of speech acts of the target\nlanguage (in addition to grammatical knowledge and vocab-\nulary) to avoid these kinds of communication problems.\nCross-cultural investigations of speech act patterns in dif-\nferent languages can serve this purpose. They can find differ-\nent strategies native speakers use and also can pinpoint\nsimilarities and differences across languages. Chen & Chen\nThis study was an effort to find the way native Persian\nand English speakers use request strategies in their daily\ninteractions. Definitions of some technical words are pro-\nvided prior to related literature.\nPragmatics\nPragmatics is the study of how language is affected by the\ncontext in which it occurs. The aspects that can affect the\nlanguage can be the relationship between the speakers in a\nconversation, the context, or preceding utterances (Parker &\nstudy of intended speaker meaning\" (p. 3). Pragmatic com-\npetence, which is the ability to perform language functions\nappropriately in social context, has been considered to be an\nessential part of the communicative competence after several\n1Islamic Azad University of Urmia, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nAlireza Bonyadi, English Department, Urmia Branch, Islamic Azad\nUniversity, Urmia, Iran.\nEmail: bonyad80@hotmail.com\nRequest Strategies in Everyday\nInteractions of Persian and English\nSpeakers\nShiler Yazdanfar1 and Alireza Bonyadi1\n Keywords\ncross-cultural studies, pragmatic competence, speech acts, requests, directness level\n2 SAGE Open\ntheoretical models of communicative competence were\nand Bachman and Palmer (1996). Before the emergence of\nthese models, for long years, second language ability had\nbeen equated with linguistic accuracy, but it was proven that\nmastery over grammatical forms and lexical and phonologi-\ncal knowledge was not enough for successful communica-\ntion and as Wannaruk (2008) mentioned, \"communication\nbreakdowns can occur during cross-cultural communication\ndue to different perceptions and interpretations of appropri-\nateness and politeness\" (p. 318). To be communicatively\ncompetent, speakers should have the knowledge of using\nlanguage appropriately according to contextual factors.\nSpeech Acts\nJohn Austin (1962) referred to speech acts for the first time\nin his book How to Do Things With Words, where he said, \"in\nuttering a sentence one can do things as well as say things\"\n(cited in Parker & Riley, 1994). Speech acts are considered\nto have three facets: a locutionary act (the description of\nwhat somebody says), an illocutionary act (the speaker's\nintention in uttering something), and a perlocutionary act\n(the action done as a result of the illocutionary force of an\nutterance).\nSearle (1975) classified illocutionary acts into six types:\n1. Representative: to describe state of affairs (confess-\ning, stating, asserting, etc.).\n2. Directive: to have someone do something (request-\ning, forbidding, warning, ordering, etc.).\n3. Question: to get someone to provide information\n(asking, inquiring, etc.).\n4. Comissive: to commit the speaker to do something\n(promising, vowing, pledging, etc.).\n5. Expressive: to express speaker's emotional state\n(apologizing, thanking, congratulating).\n6. Declaration: to change the status of some entity\n(naming, appointing, resigning, etc.).\nDirect Versus Indirect Illocutionary Act\nIllocutionary acts are stated directly when syntactic form of\nthe utterance matches its illocutionary force. Each type of\nsentences is associated with a particular illocutionary act, for\nexample, when an expressive is delivered by an exclamatory,\nor a request by an imperative, it is delivered directly. In many\ncases, especially in requests (a kind of directive), using a\ndirect speech act can be considered impolite or rude. So, to\nmitigate or soften the effect of speech acts, speakers may\nchoose to state their utterances indirectly, that is, by using a\nsyntactic form, which does not match the illocutionary force\nof the utterance (Parker & Riley, 1994). In addition to polite-\nness, Thomas (1983) believed that \"people use indirect strat-\negies when they want to make their speech more interesting,\nwhen they want to reach goals different from their partners,\nor when they want to increase the face of the message com-\nmunicated\" (p. 143). Higher levels of indirectness are\nbelieved to result in higher levels of politeness.\nPoliteness Theory\nPoliteness involves considering feelings of others and mak-\ning others feel comfortable. Goffman (1967) described\npoliteness as \"the perception an individual shows to another\nthrough avoidance or presentation of rituals\" (p. 77).\nPoliteness serves to avoid conflicts, which may arise during\na conversation between the participants. One way of show-\ning politeness is to use indirect speech acts. According to\nBrown and Levinson's (1978) politeness theory, \"People\ntend to choose indirect forms over direct ones to show polite-\nness, since being direct is face-threatening\" (p. 78). Leech\n(1983) mentioned it is possible to increase the degree of\npoliteness by using more indirect illocutions \" . . . a) because\nthey increase the degree of optionality, and b) because the\nmost indirect the illocution is, the more diminished and ten-\ntative its force tends to be\" (p. 131).\nFace and Face-Threatening Acts\n(FTAs)\nThe idea of face was proposed by Erving Goffman in the\nyear 1967. He defined face as a mask that changes depending\non audience and the social interaction. The idea of face can\nbe different in different cultures and social circumstances.\nEvery speaker of a language has a self-image, which she or\nwishes to maintain when she or he is in communication with\nothers. Face \"can be lost, maintained, or enhanced and must\nconstantly be attended to in interactions\" (Goffman, 2006,\nface as our need to act without imposition and positive face\nas our desire to be liked and admired by others. They use the\nterm face-threatening acts to refer to acts such as disapproval\nor contempt, which challenge a person's positive face, and\nacts such as requests for action, which limit a person's free-\ndom and challenge his or her negative face. Many misunder-\nstandings and breakdowns in communication may result\nfrom FTAs.\nNegative and Positive Politeness\nBased on which face people attempt to save, Brown and\nLevinson (1987) mentioned two kinds of politeness: positive\npoliteness, which saves hearer's positive face and which\nindicates solidarity with the audience. People show positive\npoliteness by using conversation strategies such as informal\npronunciation, slangs, and indirect requests. Negative polite-\nness, which saves hearer's negative face, indicates deference\nand gives importance to others' wants and concerns. The\nstrategies used by people to show negative politeness can\nYazdanfar and Bonyadi 3\ninclude indirect and impersonal requests and using mitigat-\ning devices such as please, might, and so on. Negative polite-\nness occurs when a social distance exists between the speaker\nand audience.\nRequest Speech Act\nEllis (1994) defined requests as \"an attempt on the part of the\nspeaker to get the hearer to perform or to stop performing\nclassification of illocutionary acts, requests belong to the cat-\negory of directives, which are defined as \"an attempt to get\nthe hearer to do an act which the speaker wants and which it\nis not obvious that hearer will do in the normal course of\nevents of hearer's own accord\" (p. 66). Brown and Levinson\n(1987) categorized requests as FTA, because the speaker\nimposes his or her will on the hearer. They suggest when\npeople want to do an FTA, they might try to mitigate its\neffect on the hearer's face. Depending on the seriousness or\nweightiness of the FTA, the speaker chooses different strate-\ngies. Variables the speakers consider are the degree of impo-\nsition, the relative power of the hearer, and the social\ndistance between the speaker and the hearer. Because a\nrequest is a kind of imposition on the hearer, the speaker had\nbetter avoid a direct request in most circumstances (Yule,\n1996). It is vital that speakers use appropriate form of\nrequests; otherwise, they might look rude or impolite, and\nthis can lead to communication problems. According to\nrequests are considered to be impolite, because they limit the\nhearer's freedom, and indirectness is a way speakers prefer\nto increase the degree of politeness.\nCross-Cultural Study of Speech Act\nRealization Patterns (CCSARP)\nThis project is an effort to empirically study the speech\nacts of requests and apologies in eight languages\n(Australian English, American English, British English,\nCanadian French, Danish, German, Hebrew, and Russian).\nThe goal of the project is to compare across these lan-\nguages with respect to these speech acts and establish\nnative speakers' patterns and also find similarities and dif-\nferences between native and non-native speakers of men-\ntioned languages. Based on decreasing degree of directness,\nthey classified requests strategies into three levels of\ndirectness and nine strategy types (examples are provided\nin Appendix A):\n1. The most direct explicit level: including mood deriv-\nable, explicit performatives, hedged performatives,\nlocution derivable, and scope stating.\n2. The conventionally indirect level: including lan-\nguage-specific suggestory formulas and reference to\npreparatory condition.\n3. The non-conventionally indirect level: including\nstrong hints and mild hints.\nModification Devices\nTo soften the impact of requests as FTAs, speakers also use\nsome external and internal modifications whose function can\nbe either to mitigate or aggravate the request.\nExternal Modifiers\nThese modifiers, which are also called \"Adjunct to the head\nActs,\" occur in the immediate context of the speech act, and\nthey are optional clauses, which indirectly modify the illocu-\ntionary force. Some categories offered by Edmondson\nChecking on availability: for example, \"Are you going in\nthe direction of the town? And if so, is it possible to join\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Getting a pre-commitment: for example, \"Will you do\nme a favor? Could you perhaps lend me your notes for\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Grounder: for example, \"Judith, I missed class yester-\nday, could I borrow your notes?\" (p. 205)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Sweetener: for example, \"You have beautiful hand-\nwriting, would it be possible to borrow your notes for\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Disarmer: for example, \"Excuse me, I hope you don't\nthink I'm being forward, but is there any chance of a\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Cost minimizer: for example, \"Pardon me, but could\nyou give me a lift, if you're going my way, as I just\nmissed the bus and there isn't another one for an\nInternal Modifiers\nThese modifiers that appear within the speech act are sup-\nportive moves, which can be either downgraders (to miti-\ngate) or upgraders (to enhance) the illocutionary force of\nthe request.\nA. Downgraders: which in turn are divided into\nSyntactic downgraders and Lexical downgraders.\na. Syntactic downgraders:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Interrogative: for example, \"Could you do the clean-\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Negation: for example, \"Look, excuse me.

Not\nmany studies fall in this group.\nRue, Zhang, and Shin (2007) investigated request strate-\ngies in Korean. They attempted to study Korean native\nspeakers' use of request strategies in connection with the\nlevel of directness. They also investigated the effect of power\nand distance on the performance of request. The participants\nwere 12 office workers. CCSARP was applied to analyze\ndata. The results revealed Korean was based on status of\npower. More indirect strategies are used for higher power\naddressees. In general, speakers preferred conventionally\nindirect request strategies.\nIn another study, Shams and Afghari (2011) investigated\nthe effect of gender and culture on the comprehensibility of\nindirect requests using a questionnaire in Persian, including\n20 items in each of which a situation was described and an\nindirect request was implied. The participants were 30 peo-\n(15 males and 15 females) from Farokhshahr. The results\nshowed the significant effect of culture on the interpretation\nof indirect speech act, whereas gender had no effect.\nThe notions of indirectness and politeness in the speech\nact of requests were investigated by Felix-Brasdefer (2005)\namong native speakers of Mexican Spanish in formal and\ninformal situations. The data were collected from four males\nand six females using a role-play instrument. The results\nrevealed the more distant the relationship between the inter-\nlocutors is, the more indirect requests will be used.\nILP\nThese studies investigate the learners' development and use\nof pragmatic knowledge in second language context. This\nkind of research has been widely done in English as a Foreign\nLanguage (EFL) and English as a second Language (ESL)\narea. This part can be more divided into (a) studies that\ninvestigated the importance of instruction and (b) those that\njust investigated how SL learners approximate NSs in their\nuse of speech acts.\nStudies that investigated the importance of instruction.Xiao-\nle (2011) aimed at investigating the effect of explicit and\nimplicit instructions of request strategies on gaining the\npragmatic knowledge in online communication of Chinese\nEFL learners. Two groups of learners (explicit group [EG]\nand implicit group [IG]) were instructed differently and\nwere given a pre-test and a post-test consisting of a written\ndiscourse completion task and a role-play. Results revealed\ngreater progress of the EG, which suggests the importance\nof using consciousness-raising activities in teaching\npragmatics.\nThe importance of explicit teaching was also indicated in\nthe study done by Farahian, Rezaee, and Gholami (2012)\nwho studied the effectiveness of explicit instruction of refus-\nals on four types of speech acts, namely, invitations, sugges-\ntions, offers, and requests. Participants were 64 Iranian\nintermediate university students aged 19 to 25. Based on the\nfindings, they came to conclusion that explicit instruction of\nrefusals increased second Language (SL) pragmatic ability\nof the experimental group.\nVahid Dastjerdi and Rezvani (2010) did not come to the\nsame conclusion as Xiao-lee (2011) and Farahian et al.\n(2012), for they showed both explicit and implicit instruc-\ntions were effective on EFL learners'request strategies. They\nstudied the effect of two instructional paradigms, that is,\nexplicit versus implicit instruction on English learners' abil-\nity of using request speech acts. One hundred twenty Iranian\nintermediate EFL learners were randomly divided into three\ngroups of EG, IG, and control group (CG). The results indi-\ncated the significant effect of both explicit and implicit\ninstruction on learners' production of request strategies in\nEnglish:\nThose that just investigated how SL learners approximate NSs in\ntheir use of speech acts. Native Speakers (NS) Umar (2004)\ncompared the request strategies used by Arab learners of\nEnglish with the strategies used by native English speakers\n(NESs). The participants were 20 Arab students in four Ara-\nbic universities and 20 British students in three British\nYazdanfar and Bonyadi 5\nuniversities. Using a discourse completion test (DCT) to\ngenerate data, the researcher came to conclusion that the two\ngroups used similar strategies when making a request to\nequals or people in higher rank. They used conventionally\nindirect strategies in these conditions. For lower position\naddressees, the Arabic sample has tendency toward using\nmore direct requests than the British. It was also found that\nNESs use more semantic and syntactic modifiers; that is why\ntheir requests appear to be more polite.\nBA and MA Persian EFL learners and 10 Australian native\nspeakers of English to find strategies used by each group. To\nobtain data, he used a DCT. The results revealed that as pro-\nficiency level increases, learners' use of direct requests\ndecreases, but conventional and non-conventional, types of\nrequesting increase, and also there is overuse of direct\nrequests with lower level learners and overuse of conven-\ntionally indirect requests with mid-level learners.\nDegree of familiarity and social power were two factors\nbased on which Memarian (2012) investigated Persian grad-\nuate students' use of request strategies. She aimed at deter-\nmining any potential sign of pragmatic transfer from their\nfirst language. She administered a DCT to 100 graduate stu-\ndents studying at Eastern Mediterranean University and also\nto two baseline groups of British English native speakers and\nPersian native speakers. The data were coded according to\nCCSARP and were analyzed by the use of SPSS program.\nThe results revealed possible signs of transfer regarding\nsome specific situations in the DCT. Some evidence was also\nfound regarding the development of interlanguage by Persian\ngraduate students. Iranians indicated a need for more educa-\ntion on the choice of strategies with respect to factors of\nsocial power and degree of familiarity.\nCross-Cultural Studies\nThese studies investigate how a particular speech act is real-\nized in different languages to find the patterns and strategies\nnative speakers of a language use and also to find the simi-\nlarities and differences between languages mostly to investi-\ngate universal principles in speech act realizations.\nHilbig (2009) tried to explore request strategies in\nLithuanian and British English. The researcher used the prin-\nciples from Blum-Kulka, House, and Kasper's (1989)\nCCSARP. The data were collected from 100 Lithuanian and\n100 English university undergraduates using DCT and also\nan open-ended questionnaire, which included 12 socially\ndivergent situations to prompt requests. According to the\nfindings, both groups used conventionally indirect requests,\nbut the Lithuanian respondents used more direct strategies\n(e.g., imperatives) and non-conventionally indirect strategies\n(e.g., hints) and Lithuanians had a tendency to use more posi-\ntive politeness strategies.\nIndirectness and politeness are areas in cross-cultural\nstudies that have attracted many researchers. Tawalbeh and\nAl-Oqaily (2012), for instance, investigated the notion of\ndirectness and politeness in requests of native Saudi Arabic\nspeakers in comparison with Native American English\nspeakers. A DCT consisting of 12 written situations was\ngiven to 30 Saudi and American undergraduate students. The\nresults revealed that Americans used conventional indirect-\nness as their most favorite strategy. Depending on the power\nand distance variables, Saudi students used varied kinds of\nrequest strategies.\nRequest modification is another aspect of request strate-\ngies, which have been investigated by researchers. In 2012,\nHans made a contrastive study of British English and\nMandarin Chinese to find the similarities and differences\nbetween these two languages with regard to request modi-\nfications used by speakers. Sixteen native speakers of\nBritish English and 20 native speakers of Chinese per-\nformed the role-plays, which were constructed in English\nand Chinese. The results revealed the effect of some social\nvariables such as power and distance on the choice of\nmodifications.\nIn another study, Eslamirasekh (1993) made a cross-cul-\ntural comparison of patterns in the requests of 50 and 50\nAmerican native speakers under the same social constraints.\nShe used controlled elicitation (open questionnaire) to gather\ndata and used CCSARP to code them based on the degree of\ndirectness. According to the results, Persian speakers used\nmore direct requests than American speakers and more alert-\ners, supportive moves, and internal modifiers. These strate-\ngies are used by Persian speakers to compensate for the level\nof directness.\nStudying all these articles, the researchers noticed there is\na gap in studies related to request speech act. First, few stud-\nies investigated the cross-cultural differences of requests in\nPersian and English. To the researchers' best knowledge,\nthere is just one study with this topic, namely, Eslamirasekh\n(1993), which was done almost a decade ago. Second, in\nmost of the cases, the tool in eliciting data was a role-play or\na DCT. As Tatton (2008) mentioned, \"we might question\nwhether we can assume that the responses [gathered through\nthe use of the DCT] are reflective of what would occur in\nnatural discourse\" (p. 2). He suggests that \"further research\nbe done in this area using recordings of natural day-to-day\nconversations\" (p. 2). In the current study, the data will be\ncollected through a naturalistic view, that is, through examin-\ning request strategies used by speakers in English and Persian\nTV series.\nResearch Questions\n1. In their daily interactions, how do Persian and English\nspeakers use request strategies with regard to direct-\nness level?\n2. In their daily interactions, how do English and\nPersian speakers use request strategies with regard to\ninternal and external modification devices?\n6 SAGE Open\nMethod\nCorpus\nThe data were gathered through observing American English\nandTVseries.The first 300 requestive utterances that appeared\nin American TV series and the first 300 requestive utterances\nthat appeared in Persian TV series were transcribed.\nInstruments/Materials\nThe tool for gathering data was through TV series conversations.\nFernandez-Guerra (2008) made a comparison of occurrences of\nrequest strategies and mitigation devices inTVseries and spoken\ncorpora. Although some slight differences in some type of\nrequests were found, he claimed requesting behavior in TV\nseries resembles natural discourse and is a useful language\nresource. The TV series chosen were Desperate Housewives, as\ntheAmerican English sample, and Ghalbe Yakhi (Frozen Hearts)\nas the sample. Desperate Housewives is an American TV com-\nedy-mystery-drama series directed by Marc Cherry, which aired\nPrimetime Emmy, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors' Guild\nAward and was reported the most popular show with an audience\nof almost 120 million. Ghalbe Yakhi is a home network enter-\ntainment series in three seasons and 57 episodes. The reasons for\nchoosing these two series were their being teemed with everyday\nconversations and thus being full of requestive utterances.\nProcedure and Data Analysis\nThe classification proposed by Blum-Kulka and Olshtain\n(1984) in CCSARP was applied. In this model, first three\nsegments are recognized for request utterances: (a) Address\nTerm, (b) Head Act, (c) Adjunct(s) to Head act. For example,\nin the sentence,\nMary, would you lend me some money. I should pay my\ntuition by the end of this week.\na. \"Mary\" is the Address term.\nb. \"would you . . . \" is the Head act.\nc. \"I should pay . . . \" is the Adjunct to Head act.\nOnly the Head act is realized in classifying the levels of\ndirectness in requests.\nTo gather the data, all 600 requestive utterances were\nplaced under appropriate category in CCSARP directness\nlevel, and the frequency of each category was calculated.\nAlso, they were categorized based on the used external and\ninternal mitigation devices (if any), and the frequency of\ntheir appearance was calculated.\nData Analysis\nThis part deals with the distribution of request strategies used\nby native Persian speakers (NPSs) and NESs in mentioned\nTV series. To this end, the requests uttered in TV series in\nPersian and English were transcribed and categorized accord-\ning to Blum-Kulka and Olshtain's (1989) model of direct-\nness levels and mitigation devices. Research questions are\nmentioned prior to presenting the tables, which provide the\nanswers for the questions.\nResearch Question 1: In their daily interactions, how do\nPersian and English speakers use request strategies with\nregard to directness level?\nTable 1 shows the frequency of different types of request\nstrategies used by English and Persian speakers.\nAs can be inferred from Table 1, although the majority of\nspeakers in both Persian and English series opted for mood\nderivable strategy, NPSs used it more than NESs, 190 and\n151 requests, respectively. NPSs also used explicit performa-\ntives more often. They did not indicate a big difference in the\nuse of hedged performative, although NESs used this strat-\negy slightly more frequently than NPSs. NPSs also indicated\na greater interest in using Locution derivable strategy than\nNESs did. They used it in 27 utterances, whereas NPSs used\nit just in 13 requests. As can be inferred from Table 1, a sig-\nnificant difference can be seen in the frequencies with which\nEnglish and Persian speakers used Scope stating. The English\nused it almost 3 times as much as the Persian did, that is, 42\ncompared with 15 utterances. Numbers were closer with\nregard to the suggestory formula. Another big difference can\nbe noticed in the seventh strategy, being reference to prepa-\nratory condition. NESs demonstrated a marked preference\nfor this strategy and used it as their second favored request\nstrategy, in 64 cases, whereas NPSs used it much less than\nNESs did, that is, just in 19 requests. NPSs, however, opted\nfor strong hint as their second most frequent strategy and\nused it in 27 requests; NESs used them in 13 requests. Mild\nhints were absent in both NPSs and NESs requests. All in all,\nthere seems to be a difference in the request strategies NESs\nand NPSs used in these TV series. Although both opted for\nmood derivable, which belongs to the most direct level, as\nthe most frequent strategy they use in majority of their\nTable 1. Comparing Request Strategies Used by NPSs and NESs.\nRequest strategies English Persian\nHedged performative 5 2\nLanguage-specific suggestory formula 5 4\nReference to preparatory condition 64 19\nNote. NPS = native Persian speaker; NES = native English speaker.\nYazdanfar and Bonyadi 7\nrequests, NESs used reference to preparatory condition, a\nconventional indirect strategy much more than NPSs did,\nand NPSs applied strong hint, in non-conventional indirect\nlevel, with a higher frequency than NESs did. Examples of\nEnglish and Persian requests are given in Appendix B.\nResearch Question 2: In their daily interactions, how do\nPersian and English speakers use request strategies with\nregard to external and internal mitigation devices.\nAll 600 transcribed request strategies were categorized\nonce more based on different types of mitigation devices\nused.Although all used strategies in both English and Persian\nTV series would fit in one of the directness subcategories,\nnot all used strategies contained an internal or external miti-\ngation device, that is, English and Persian speakers did not\nuse these devices in all the requests. Persian speakers used\nthese devices much less that the English speakers did. From\nall 300 transcribed requests, only 67 requests contained a\nmitigating device, whereas 119 transcribed English requests\nconsisted of at least one external or internal (or both) mitiga-\ntion device. To be more precise,\nAll transcribed English requests: 300\nEnglish requests containing mitigation devices (internal,\nAll transcribed Persian requests: 300\nPersian requests containing mitigation devices (internal,\nexternal, and mixed): 70\nThe classification of external and internal mitigation devices\ninthe currentstudyis basedonEdmondson(1981),Edmondson\nmentioned in Blum-Kulka and Olshtain (1989). There are some\nother classifications, which include other subcategories not\nmentioned here. One of these subcategories is the word\n\"Please,\" which is a lexical downgrader. Because it is a very\ncommon mitigation device, the researchers included it in Table\n2. Used external mitigation devices are shown in Table 3.\nAs can be seen in Table 2, English speakers used more\ninternal mitigation devices in their daily interactions (110 out\nof 300 transcribed requests) than Persian speakers (51 out of\n300 transcribed requests). Interrogatives are the most fre-\nquently used internal device by English speakers in the stud-\nied TV series. Understaters were the only devices that were\nnoticeably used more by Persian speakers. These devices are\nsome words such as \"a bit,\" \"small,\" and so on, which can\nminimize the requested action or the object. The English also\nused the politeness marker \"please\" much more frequently\nthan the Persian did. Examples of internal mitigation devices\nare provided in Appendix C.\nCompared with internal mitigation devices, external\ndevices were not used very often. However, Persian speakers\nshowed a greater tendency to use them. Among different\ntypes of external mitigation devices, grounders (reasons)\nwere the most preferred strategies by both English and\nPersian speakers.\nIn addition to mentioned external and internal mitigation\ndevices, there were some utterances in which two internal\nmitigation devices or both internal and external mitigation\ndevices are used. These Mixed Mitigations were seen more in\nEnglish requests (N.16) than in Persian requests (N. 3). Some\nexamples are offered below:\nEnglish:\nCould you possibly take it easy? (Interrogative and\ndowntoner)\nI would really appreciate it if you said something.\n(Embedding, intensifier, and hedge)\nThere is something I would like to ask you. Can't we just\nwork it out? (Getting a pre-commitment, negation, and\ninterrogative)\nMan ye xaheshe kuchik azat daram. Mitunam karte shoma ro\ndashte basham? (I need a little favor. Could I have your card?)\n(Understate, interrogative, and getting a pre-commitment)\nYe toke pa tashrif miavarid? (Would you here come a sec-\nond?) (Understater and interrogator)\nMitunam ye xaheshi azat dashte basham? Mituni befres-\ntish unvar? (May I ask for a favor? Can you send him\nabroad?) (Getting a pre-commitment and interrogative)\nTable 2.

This strat-\negy belongs to the most direct level in the model proposed by\nthe abovementioned authors.\nWith regard to NPSs, this result accords with the findings\nof Eslamirasekh (1993) that \"Persian speakers use signifi-\ncantly more direct strategies\" (p. 91). However, it is in con-\ntrast with the findings of Shams and Afghari (2011) and\nSalmani (2008) who believed that Iranian participants use\nindirect requests rather than direct ones.\nThe preference of direct strategies by speakers of a lan-\nguage cannot be taken as a proof that they are not polite.\nAccording to Brown and Levinson's (1978) politeness the-\nory, people use indirect forms to indicate politeness.\nReexamining the concepts of politeness and indirectness,\nBlum-Kulka (1987) investigated native speakers' percep-\ntions of these two notions in Hebrew and English in a series\nof experiments. He came to conclusion that the two concepts\nare not necessarily parallel dimensions; rather, they are\nbelieved to be different from each other.\nAlso, Brown and Levinson's (1978) two notion of nega-\ntive and positive politeness can somehow be related to this\ndiscussion. As Eslamirasekh (1993) mentioned, when inter-\npreting a linguistic behavior, the social meanings implied\nby these behaviors should also be considered. The members\nof two cultures may not necessarily consider the directness\nand indirectness similarly. Although indirectness and\npoliteness are usually connected, their social meaning may\nbe different in different cultures. According to Brown and\nLevinson (1978), negative politeness is indicated by using\nverbal strategies, which show deference and by avoiding\nimposition. However, positive politeness is achieved by\nindicating solidarity with the audience. Speakers show this\nkind of politeness by using direct requests among other\nstrategies. Eslamirasekh (1993) referred to some research-\ners who have claimed that in Western world, politeness is\nusually expressed by negative strategies. According to\nresults of the current study, Persian speakers used more\ndirect strategies, that is, they tend to use positive politeness,\na view that is supported by the findings of Eslamirasekh\n(1993) when she reasoned that in cultures such as Iranian\nculture, \""
