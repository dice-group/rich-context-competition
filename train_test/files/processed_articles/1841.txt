Leisure-Time Physical Activity Patterns by Weight Control Status: 1999\u00ad2002\nhypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, and some cancers. Physical activity is associated inversely with\noverweight and obesity prevalence, thus potentially assisting in weight control efforts. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to\nexamine the variability of physical activity levels and their patterns by self-reported weight control status in a nationally\nrepresentative sample. Methods: Four years of data from the 1999\u00ad2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) were used to examine leisure-time physical activity patterns (regular, irregular, inactive) and the prevalence of weight\ncontrol practices (trying to lose, trying to maintain, not trying to lose or maintain) among U.S. adults (N = 9496). Results: The\nprevalence of regular physical activity was 32.6% among people trying to lose weight, 37.9% among people trying to maintain weight,\nand 21.8% among those not trying to lose or maintain weight. Those trying to lose weight were almost three times as likely to be\nregularly active (vs inactive), and those trying to maintain weight were over three times more likely to be regularly active (vs inactive)\nthan those not trying to lose or maintain weight. The most commonly reported activities among those trying to lose weight were\nwalking (38.3%), yard work (14.5%), biking (12.5%), and running (11.6%). Conclusions: Despite the importance of physical activity,\nfewer than half the people trying to lose or maintain weight were regularly active during leisure-time. People trying to lose or maintain\nweight had a higher likelihood of being regularly active than those not trying to lose or maintain weight. Walking was the most\ncommon type of physical activity among all weight control groups. Health promotion efforts should promote increased levels of\nphysical activity among all adults. ",

Reasons for lack of physical activity may be explained\nby a constellation of individual and environmental factors\nsuch as perceived lack of time, feeling too tired, obtaining\nenough exercise at one`s job, no motivation to exercise (4),\nlack of access to recreational facilities (11), and lack of\nsidewalks (15). Although demographic correlates of physi-\ncal activity in broad adult populations have been well\nnational surveys (5,9), and community-based studies\n(12,13), physical activity patterns specific to adults trying\nto lose weight or maintain weight have not been well\ndocumented.\nIncreasing physical activity is one of the cornerstones of\na long-term, healthy weight-management program (1).\nPhysical activity has been effective at helping people to\nkeep from gaining weight (25) and to lose weight when\ncombined with a decrease in caloric intake (27). Although\nphysical activity should be an integral part of weight\ncontrol practices, little is known on a population level\nabout the amount and type of physical activity reported\namong people trying to control their weight. Understanding\npatterns of physical activity behaviors among people trying\nto lose weight or trying to maintain their weight may\nprovide health care professionals with direction as to how\nto increase physical activity levels in the U.S. population\nand among people engaging in weight control behaviors.\nGaining more information about the physical activity\nAddress for correspondence: Judy Kruger, Ph.D., Division of Nutrition\nand Physical Activity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770\nCopyright \u00d3 2007 by the American College of Sports Medicine\nCopyright @ 2007 by the American College of Sports Medicine.

However,\nthere are limited data on national estimates of weight loss\nand weight maintenance practices. Previous data on the\nprevalence of weight loss among adults have shown that\nSurvey data collected from the National Weight Control\nRegistry provide data on over 4000 individuals who have\nbeen successful at long-term weight loss maintenance;\n89% reported both diet and physical activity for weight\nloss, but among this sample, only 1% reported using\nexercise alone for weight loss (28). Despite these multiple\nsources, information specific to physical activity patterns\namong those who have lost weight or who are trying to\nmaintain their weight is rare. The purpose of this paper\nis to compare and describe leisure-time physical activity\nlevel by weight control status in a nationally representative\nsample of U.S. adults.\nMETHODS\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) is a major program of the National Center for\nHealth Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion that assesses health and nutritional status of adults\nand children in the United States (8). The NHANES is\nunique in that it combines interviews and physical\nexaminations. Data are released on public-use data files\nevery 2 yr. In the current study, data from two cycles\noptions. Data items collected in all combined years were\ncomparable in wording and methods; therefore, the data\nwere concatenated to form a single file (interview sample\nsize of 21,004). To develop an adult analytic sample, we\nmissing information on physical activity types (N = 17),\nmissing body mass index (N = 1297), pregnant women\n(N = 613), and respondents who did not answer the\nquestions about trying to lose weight or not trying to\ngain weight (N = 18). The final analytic sample was N =\nWe created three mutually exclusive categories of\nweight control (weight loss and management) status: those\ntrying to lose weight, those trying to maintain weight, and\nthose not trying to lose or maintain weight. In the\nNHANES interview, respondents were first asked their\ncurrent self-reported weight and their weight 1 yr ago; if\nthey had lost weight, they were asked whether it had been\nintentional (8). To assess current weight loss, respondents\nwere then asked, ``During the past 12 months, have you\ntried to lose weight?'' Those who self-reported an inten-\ntional weight loss of 10 lb or more or who reported that\nthey were currently trying to lose weight were categorized\nas trying to lose weight. Those who did not self-report a\nweight loss of 10 lb or more were asked the following\nquestion to assess weight maintenance status (i.e., attempt\nto control weight and prevent from gaining weight):\n``During the past 12 months, have you done anything to\nkeep from gaining weight?'' Those who indicated having\ntried to keep from gaining weight in the past 12 months\nand who were not trying to lose weight were categorized as\ntrying to maintain their weight. If respondents said ``no'' to\nboth questions, they were classified as not trying to lose or\nmaintain weight.\nNHANES queried participation in leisure-time activities,\nincluding exercise, sports, and physically active hobbies,\nduring the past 30 d (6). Types of specific leisure-time\nphysical activity were assessed by asking respondents six\nseparate questions about their participation in specific\nvigorous- and moderate-intensity activities for at least 10\nmin per occasion during the past 30 d. Respondents were\nasked ``Over the past 30 d, did you do any vigorous\nactivities for at least 10 min that caused heavy sweating, or\nlarge increases in breathing or heart rate? Some examples\nare running, lap swimming, aerobics classes, or fast\nbicycling.'' Respondents were handed a card with a list of\n24 vigorous activities and an ``other'' category. Those who\nreported ``yes'' were asked, ``[Over the past 30 d] what\nvigorous activities did you do?'' They were then asked the\nfrequency (e.g., how many times per day, per week, or per\nmonth) and duration (e.g., how long in terms of minutes or\nhours) they had performed these activities. In a similar\nmanner, respondents were also asked about their partici-\npation in moderate-intensity physical activity: ``[Over the\npast 30 d], did you do moderate activities for at least 10\nmin that caused only light sweating or a slight to moderate\nincrease in breathing or heart rate? Some examples are\nbrisk walking, bicycling for pleasure, golf, or dancing.''\nIndividuals who reported that they had engaged in\nmoderate-intensity activity were asked to report the\nfrequency and duration of any of the 32 moderate\nactivities. Activities reported for G 10 min and those\nreported for Q 12 hIdj1 were not included in the NHANES\ndataset.\nThe total time for participation in either moderate- or\nvigorous-intensity leisure-time physical activities in the\npast 30 d was summed to characterize three activity\npatterns. Respondents were grouped as regularly active if\nthey reported engaging in a total of Q 600 min, Q 20 times\nPHYSICAL ACTIVITY BY WEIGHT CONTROL STATUS Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise\nd\nCopyright @ 2007 by the American College of Sports Medicine.

These estimates approximate\nQ 150 minIwkj1 of moderate- to vigorous-intensity\nphysical activity. Those active at a lower frequency or\nduration were considered irregularly active, and those who\nreported no moderate- or vigorous-intensity leisure-time\nactivity in the last month were considered inactive.\nActivities that were similar conceptually were grouped\ntogether--for example vigorous-intensity running and\njogging and moderate-intensity yard work and gardening.\nThe median time spent in moderate leisure-time activity in\nthe past month was calculated among those who had\nparticipated in any physical activity. To examine the\nphysical activity further, we created two subsets of regular\nphysical activity, a higher and a lower activity profile. The\nhigher\u00adactivity level physical activity category consisted of\nphysical activity (moderate- or vigorous-intensity) in the\nlast month; this is equivalent to 60 min of physical activity\non most days of the week. The lower\u00adactivity level\nphysical activity category consisted of respondents report-\nactivity) in the last month; this is equivalent to 30 min of\nphysical activity on most days of the week. The estimate of\n30 min on most days of the week is based on the physical\nactivity recommendation for health benefits established by\nestimate of 60 min on most days of the week is based on\nthe weight maintenance recommendation.\nHeight and weight were measured in each of the three\nNHANES mobile examination centers. BMI was calculated\nby dividing weight (kg) by squared height (m2). Four BMI\ncategories were created: normal weight (BMI G 25),\n34.9), and obese class II (BMI Q 35). Three categories of\nBMI were used for analyses (normal weight, overweight,\nobese) because of small sample sizes in the obese class II\ncategory.

It is possible that people trying to lose weight or to\nmaintain their current weight are more health conscious\nand seek information and advice from health care providers\nto assist them in weight loss or maintenance (20). It is also\ninteresting that a substantial proportion of individuals who\nwere overweight or obese were not trying to lose or\nmaintain weight. Further research is needed to determine\nwhether body weight acceptance among chronic dieters\nincreases weight control attempts (2).\nFrom this national survey, we found that 37.9% of those\ntrying to maintain weight reported regular physical\nactivity. Regardless of weight control status, physical\nactivity is important for the improvement and maintenance\nof health. Although the present study did not investigate\nthe effects of accompanying weight control strategies (e.g.,\ndiet practices), this research adds insight into physical\nactivity patterns by weight control subgroups. Because\nweight control is a complex behavior, for long-term weight\nloss and maintenance, the American College of Sports\nMedicine (1) recommends that overweight and obese\nindividuals progressively increase the amount of time they\nspend being physical active.\nTo fully understand weight control status, we looked at a\nmodel that included a four-category measure of weight\nloss: those trying to lose weight with BMI G 25.0, those\ntrying to lose weight with BMI Q 25.0, those trying to\nmaintain weight, and those not trying to lose or maintain\nweight. Using this four-category model, the odds of being\nregularly active among those trying to lose weight with\nBMI Q 25.0, compared with those not trying to lose or\nmaintain weight (data not shown). Because there was no\nsignificant difference between the two BMI categories, we\ndecided to keep those trying to lose weight as one group.\nWe also examined demographic characteristics of those\n29, 48.1% were white (data not shown). Because more than\none quarter of those with normal BMI were trying to lose\nweight, these findings suggest that it may be important to\nexamine cultural perceptions of inappropriate weight loss.\nThose trying to lose weight with BMI G 25.0 may be trying\nto lose weight for cosmetic reasons (21), because their BMI\nis within normal weight guidelines.\nThese findings suggest that health-promotion efforts\nshould encourage increased levels of physical activity\namong all adults. Physical activity prevalence tended to\nbe higher among men than women and to be higher among\n18- to 29-yr-olds than among other age groups. The\nprevalence of regular physical activity was lowest among\nthose age 65 yr and older. These findings are consistent\nwith those from other national surveys (10,23) that have\nprovided demographic correlates of people who engage in\nweight control practices.\nA significant association between weight control status and\nbeing regularly active (vs inactive) and irregularly active (vs\ninactive) was found. Compared with those not trying to lose\nor maintain weight, those trying to maintain their weight had\nslightly higher odds of regular physical activity (OR = 3.3)\nthan those trying to lose weight (OR = 2.7). We compared\nmodels with and without BMI to examine the impact of BMI\non physical activity, and the model that included BMI was a\nbetter fit, so we decided to leave BMI in the model. Although\nwe were not able to determine why activity pattern differ-\nences exist, those trying to maintain their weight may be\nincorporating physical activity into their daily life in a\ndifferent manner from those trying to lose weight. Perhaps\nmaintainers have had previous experience with weight loss\nand recognize the importance of physical activity in keeping\nweight off. It is also possible that those trying to lose weight\nare engaging in caloric-restriction practices only, without\nintegrating physical activity (18).\nWe found that walking was the most prevalent physical\nactivity; approximately one in three adults who were trying\nto lose or maintain weight walked in their leisure time. The\nFIGURE 1--Prevalence of levels of physical activity among adults\nwho are regularly active by weight control status: NHANES 1999\u00ad\n2002.

Because walking was\nthe most prevalent physical activity, this finding provides\ndirection for health-promotion campaigns to promote the\nmost popular activity--walking--to increase the number\nof adults who engage regularly, preferably daily, in mod-\nerate physical activity for Q 30 minIdj1. In this study, we\nexamined physical activity patterns among people trying to\nlose or maintain weight during their leisure time; future\nstudies could examine opportunities for increased physical\nactivity in nonleisure contexts (i.e., occupation, trans-\nportation, and household).\nThe median minutes of activity reported by each weight\ncontrol group within a physical activity level were com-\nparable. Increased doses of physical activity can assist in\nimproving overall health. Future research could focus on\noverall volume by types of activity and could include\nquestions on walking, active transportation, and household\nactivities.\nExamination of physical activity by weight control status\nsuggests significantly different patterns. Among those\ntrying to maintain weight, a higher proportion reported\nbeing regularly active at the lower activity level (i.e., 30\nmin) than at the higher activity level (i.e., 60 min). Because\nfewer than 15% of those trying to maintain their weight\nmet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 physical\nactivity recommendation for weight maintenance (26)\nhealth care professionals are encouraged to emphasize\nphysical activity guidelines specific to maximize health\nand to maintain a healthy weight. Future research needs to\ndetermine whether people do not meet recommendations\nbecause of a lack of knowledge of the recommendations or\nbecause of a lack of understanding of how to accumulate\nrecommended amounts of activity. The Task Force on\nCommunity Preventive Services of the U.S. Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (7) has suggested that\nenvironmental, economic, and social support barriers\ninfluence exercise behavior. To overcome barriers to\nphysical activity, those trying to control their weight are\nencouraged to seek opportunities for physical activity near\nwhere they live, such as public open spaces and parks.\nIncreasing convenient opportunities to engage in lifestyle\nphysical activity (i.e., access to parks and trails) may\nincrease enjoyment and promote lifelong participation in\nphysical activity. Prior research findings suggest that the\npresence of trails and access to places for physical activity\nmay increase the proportion of people meeting the\nrecommended amounts of leisure-time activity (14).\nOur findings have some limitations to consider because\nthe data are cross-sectional. First, weight history and\nphysical activity status are collected via self-report.\nSecond, the questions used on the NHANES have not been\nvalidated to date. Although it is difficult to validate weight\ncontrol status, similar physical activity questions were used\nin the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance system and\nhave been shown to be reliable and valid (21,29). From the\nfindings of this paper, we cannot infer the extent to which\nweight loss history influences physical activity patterns or\nweight control status. Third, the questions on weight\ncontrol and physical activity might prompt a socially\ndesirable answer and overestimate the prevalence of weight\nloss or weight maintenance attempts or physical activities.\nFourth, the focus of this paper was on leisure-time physical\nactivity, and only sports, aerobic, and anaerobic activities\nduring leisure time were included in our analysis. It is\nunclear whether the distribution of physical activity\npatterns would be different if alternative domains such as\ntransportation and household activities were included.\nFifth, there may be bias because of the time frame\nspecified in the questionnaire. The questions on weight\ncontrol status referred to behavior during the past 12\nmonths, and the questions on physical activity referred to\nbehavior during the past 30 d. Therefore, we do not know\nhow long respondents had engaged in their current physical\nactivity pattern during the last 12 months. Sixth, there were\nunfortunately not enough people in the sample to examine\nrace/ethnicity differences among those trying to lose\nweight, trying to maintain weight, or not trying to lose or\nmaintain weight to make any truly meaningful interpreta-\ntion of minority weight control behavior.\nEfforts are needed to increase the awareness of physical\nactivity recommendations among people who are trying to\ncontrol their weight, because approximately 60% are not\nregularly active. To understand the relationship between\nphysical activity behavior and weight control status, future\nstudies need to examine racial/ethnic differences in con-\njunction with other social class indicators. To increase\nphysical activity level in the population, further research on\nthe complex relationship between the political, social, and\nenvironmental factors and physical activity is needed to\nguide interventions. Findings from this paper are useful for\ntracking physical activity patterns and creating messages to\nencourage various types of physical activities among all\nthose trying to control their weight. For many people starting\nan activity program, walking is a form of moderate-intensity\nphysical activity that is relatively easy to engage in regularly.\nOn the basis of these findings, roughly only 40% of\nadults trying to lose or maintain weight engaged in regular\nphysical activity. Regardless of weight control attempt\nstatus, the most common type of physical activity was\nwalking. Given the acceptability of walking among people\ntrying to lose or maintain weight, all population subgroups\nshould be encouraged to walk. People trying to lose weight\nor to keep from gaining weight should minimally try to\nmeet the physical activity recommendation for overall\nhealth of at least 30 min of moderate-intensity physical\nactivity on most days of the week.\nThe findings and conclusions of this paper are those of the\nauthors and do not necessarily represent the CDC.\nhttp://www.acsm-msse.org\n794 Official Journal of the American College of Sports Medicine\nCopyright @ 2007 by the American College of Sports Medicine.
