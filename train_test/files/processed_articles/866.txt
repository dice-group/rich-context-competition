Second, people with\ndiabetes have been observed to have altered\nplatelet function with increased production\nof thromboxane (2,3), and the primary way\nin which aspirin reduces the risk of CVD is\nthrough its effects on platelet function result-\ning in reduced thromboxane synthesis (4).\nAspirin has been shown to be an effec-\ntive and relatively safe treatment for people\nwith diabetes. Trials have demonstrated\nthat aspirin therapy can prevent the first\nheart attack, stroke, or other indication of\nCVD (primary prevention) (5,7,8) and also\nsubsequent cardiovascular events (sec-\nondary prevention) (6\u00ad8) without any\nsignificant increase in retinal or vitreous\nhemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, or\nhemorrhagic stroke (7).\nThe American Diabetes Association\n(ADA) published guidelines for aspirin ther-\nand reissued them, with minor revisions, in\nthe absence of specific contraindications,\naspirin should 1) be used for secondary\nprevention by men and women with evi-\ndence of large vessel disease (myocardial\ninfarction, vascular bypass procedure,\nstroke, transient ischemic attack, or angina)\nand 2) be considered for primary preven-\ntion in adults who have one or more risk\nfactors for CVD (family history of coronary\nheart disease, smoking, hypertension, obe-\nsity, albuminuria, or lipid abnormalities) or\nmg/day of enteric-coated aspirin are\nadvised. Specific contraindications cited by\nthe ADA include aspirin allergy, bleeding\ntendency, anticoagulant therapy, recent gas-\ntrointestinal bleeding, and clinically active\nliver disease. The ADA notes that the use of\naspirin has not been studied in individuals\nwith diabetes who are 30 years of age and\nthat aspirin should not be recommended\nfor those 21 years because of the risk of\nReye's syndrome (10).\nIn this report, we use the ADA guide-\nlines and a nationally representative sample\nto estimate the percentage of adults with\ndiabetes who are potential candidates for\naspirin therapy and the prevalence of regu-\nlar aspirin use among such individuals.\nMETHODS -- The Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\nand used a probability sample of the U.S.\ncivilian noninstitutionalized population\n(11).

We examined the prevalence of regular aspirin use among adults in the\nU.S. with diagnosed diabetes.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (1988\u00ad1994) used a probability sample of the U.S. population and\nincluded an interview, physical examination, and laboratory studies. Among the survey par-\nticipants were 1,503 adults (age 21 years) with self-reported diabetes. We defined regular\naspirin use as reported having taken aspirin 15 times in the previous month. CVD conditions\nwere self-reported heart attack and stroke and symptoms of angina and claudication. CVD risk\nfactors included smoking, hypertension, obesity, albuminuria, lipid abnormalities, and family\nhistory of heart attack.\nRESULTS -- An estimated 27% of adults with diabetes had CVD, and an additional 71% had\none or more CVD risk factors. Aspirin was used regularly by 37% of those with CVD and by\n13% of those with risk factors only. Adjusted odds of regular aspirin use were significantly\ngreater for individuals with CVD than for those with one CVD risk factor (odds ratio [OR] =\n4.3); for non-Hispanic whites than for blacks, Mexican-Americans, and others (OR = 2.5); and\nCONCLUSIONS -- Nearly every adult in the U.S. with diabetes has at least one risk factor\nfor CVD and thus may be considered a potential candidate for aspirin therapy. During\nincrease aspirin use.\nC l i n i c a l C a r e / E d u c a t i o n / N u t r i t i o n\nAspirin use among adults with diabetes in the U.S.\nOur primary sample for this study consisted\nnosed diabetes (11). Women who reported\nthat they were diagnosed only during preg-\nnancy were not included.\nParticipants were classified as regular\naspirin users if they reported taking aspirin\n15 times in the month before the inter-\nview. This definition was designed to cap-\nture alternate-day as well as daily use, both\nof which have been found effective for pre-\nventing CVD (5,7).The two relevant ques-\ntions were, \"In the past month have you\ntaken any aspirin, Anacin, Bufferin,\nEcotrin, Ascriptin, or Midol?\" and a follow-\nup question, \"How often did you take\n[aspirin] during the past month?\" The dis-\ntribution of \"how often\" had a prominent\nspike at 30, which is consistent with daily\ntherapeutic use. We believe that those who\ndid not know whether or how much\naspirin they had taken were unlikely to\nhave been regular users. Therefore, we clas-\nsified individuals who did not answer both\nthe initial and follow-up questions as non-\nregular users along with those who took\naspirin 0\u00ad14 times in the previous month.\nWe defined CVD as the presence of one\nor more of four conditions (heart attack,\nstroke, possible angina, and lower-extremity\nclaudication). Heart attack and stroke were\nboth identified by self-report of a previous\ndiagnosis; history of possible angina and\nlower-extremity claudication were deter-\nmined from responses to the Rose question-\nnaire (13). We included six CVD risk factors\nin our analysis (family history of heart attack,\nsmoking, obesity, hypertension, albumin-\nuria, and dyslipidemia) and defined them to\nmirror their definitions in the ADA guide-\nyears was treated as a separate risk factor, as\nit was in the ADA guidelines. Individuals\nwith a missing or \"unknown\" response for a\nCVD condition or risk factor were consid-\nered to not have that condition.\nWe used the interview sample (n =\n1,503 individuals with diabetes) to estimate\nthe percentage of all adults with diabetes\nwho had each of the four CVD conditions\nand the prevalence of aspirin use among\nthose with each condition. Among individ-\nuals with diabetes but without any of the\nfour CVD conditions, we estimated the per-\ncentage that had each of the six CVD risk\nfactors, or age 30 years, and the preva-\nlence of aspirin use among those with each\nrisk factor. Here we used interview, physical\nexamination, laboratory, and morning (fast-\n429 individuals, respectively, with diabetes\nbut without CVD).\nall diabetic participants with laboratory\nresults available to estimate the distribution\nof adults with diabetes across four cate-\ngories distinguished in the ADA guidelines\nand the prevalence of aspirin use in each of\nthose groups. BMI, urinary albumin, HDL,\nand total cholesterol were available for most\nof these participants, but LDL and triglyc-\neride values were available only for those\nexamined in the morning after fasting.\nWe used logistic regression to test\nwhether CVD or number of CVD risk fac-\ntors, age, sex, race or ethnicity, family\nincome, education, and health insurance\ncoverage (any vs. none) were associated\nwith regular aspirin use among adults with\ndiabetes and CVD or one or more risk fac-\ntors. Diabetes duration (in years), self-\nreported insulin use, and HbA\n(levels 8,\nsis as indicators of disease severity that\nmight be associated with the prescription of\naspirin therapy. Additionally, we modeled\nregular aspirin use among all adults, with\nand without diabetes, who had CVD, one\nor more CVD risk factors, or age 30 years\nwas significantly associated with aspirin\nuse after adjusting for the effects of age, race\nor ethnicity, CVD, and other demographic\nvariables. We used the Wald F statistic to\ntest main effects and interactions, and com-\nputed odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs to\ncompare levels of explanatory variables. To\nassess whether there was a temporal trend,\nwe compared the first 3-year phase of the\nsurvey with the second (each phase pro-\nvided an independent national estimate).\nWe used SUDAAN (14) for estimation\nand regression modeling. All of our analy-\nses account for the clustered design and\nplanned oversampling and adjust for dif-\nferential noncoverage and nonresponse\n(12). Separate weights were used for the\ninterview, examination, laboratory, and\nmorning (fasting) samples, permitting\nappropriate inference from every sample to\nthe population of adults in the U.S. with\ndiagnosed diabetes.\nRESULTS -- We estimated that among\nall U.S. adults with diabetes, 63% took\naspirin 0 times in the previous month;\nan unknown level of use). Therefore, by\nour definition, 18% of adults with diabetes\nAmong adults with diabetes, heart\nattack was the most prevalent (14%) of four\nCVD conditions (Table 1). Only 39% of\nthose with diabetes and a history of heart\nattack were regular aspirin users. The esti-\nmated prevalence of aspirin use was highest\n(70%) among individuals with symptoms\nof claudication, but only 30 individuals in\nour sample reported such symptoms.\nAmong adults with diabetes who did\nnot have CVD (Table 2), the prevalence of\nindividual CVD risk factors ranged from\n8% (family history of heart attack) to 92%\nAspirin was used regularly by 17% of\nthose with each of these risk factors.\nWe estimated that 27% of U.S. adults\nwith diabetes had CVD (one or more of\nfour conditions) and that 37% of those\nwith CVD used aspirin regularly (Table 3).\nAmong those without CVD but with one or\nmore of six CVD risk factors (71% of all\nadults with diabetes), 13% used aspirin\nregularly. We found that 99% of the U.S.\nadult diabetes population fell into one of\nthe three categories (CVD, one or more\nCVD risk factors, or age 30 years) of\nindividuals for whom the ADA recom-\nmends that aspirin therapy be used or con-\nsidered. In this combined group, only 20%\nCVD, race or ethnicity, and age were\nsignificantly associated with regular aspirin\nuse among individuals with diabetes who\ncould be considered candidates for aspirin\ntherapy per the ADA recommendation\nTable 1--Estimated prevalence of CVD and regular aspirin use among U.S. adults with diabetes\nCondition* Percent with condition Percent using aspirin\nData are % (95% CI). *Categories are not mutually exclusive. Unweighted sample size 1,503.\n(Table 4). The odds of regular aspirin use\nwere 4.3 times as great for people with CVD\nas for those with zero or one CVD risk fac-\ntors, but having a larger number of CVD risk\nfactors was not significantly associated with\nincreased odds of aspirin use. Non-Hispanic\nwhites were 2.5 times as likely to use aspirin\nregularly as non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican-\nAmericans, or individuals of other races. The\nodds of regular aspirin use, which increased\nwith age, were greater for individuals 40\nyears than for those 21\u00ad39 years of age.\nWe found no statistically significant dif-\nferences in regular aspirin use by sex, edu-\ncational attainment, or family income.\nInsulin use, duration of diabetes, HbA\n,\nand health insurance coverage were not\nfound to be associated with aspirin use and\nwere not included in the final model. None\nof the two-way interactions between CVD,\nage, race, and sex was significant; the sam-\nple size was inadequate for testing higher-\norder interactions. There was no evidence of\na temporal trend: among people with dia-\nbetes who had CVD or risk factors, 19.3%\nused aspirin regularly during the first phase,\nand 19.9% used it during the second phase.\nCompared with people who did not\nhave diagnosed diabetes, people with dia-\nbetes were somewhat more likely to take\namong those with CVD risk factors). We\nfound no significant association, however,\nbetween regular aspirin use and having dia-\nadjusting for CVD, race, and age. Here, as in\nthe diabetes subgroup, CVD, white race,\nand older age were most strongly associated\nwith regular aspirin use. We also found that\nin this expanded population, aspirin was\nsignificantly more likely to be used by men\nthan by women. Once again, there was no\nevidence of a temporal trend.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Based on a nation-\nally representative sample, we estimated\nthat 99% of U.S. adults with diagnosed\none CVD risk factor. Aspirin was used reg-\nularly by 20% of such individuals. Among\nthose with established CVD (27% of people\nwith diabetes), for whom the value of\naspirin therapy for secondary prevention is\nregular use. Among those without CVD\nbut with one or more CVD risk factors\n(71% of adults with diabetes), a group for\nwhom aspirin therapy should be consid-\n13% were regular users.\nDiabetes-specific guidelines for aspirin\ntherapy (10) were not published until\n1997. However, the potential benefits of\naspirin therapy for primary prevention of\nCVD were widely publicized beginning\nwith the release, in January 1988, of a pre-\nliminary report on the Physician's Health\nStudy (5), and more general guidelines for\nsecondary prevention were developed and\npublished during the study period (17,18).\nIn this context, our estimates of the preva-\nlence of regular aspirin use seem quite low,\nand it is somewhat surprising that aspirin\nuse did not increase during the second\nphase of the survey.\nThe argument in favor of aggressive\nefforts to prevent CVD in people with dia-\nbetes is overwhelming. The risk of myocar-\ndial infarction is as high for diabetic patients\nwho have never had an infarction as it is for\nother patients who have (1). People with\ndiabetes are not only at greater risk for CVD\nthan those without the disease, but they are\nalso more likely to die from CVD (19,20).In\nour study, the presence of diabetes was not\nassociated with increased odds of regular\naspirin use among U.S. adults after account-\ning for differences in the distributions of\nCVD, race, and age. A study conducted in\naged 45\u00ad74 years with coronary artery dis-\nease supports our finding: researchers there\nfound similarly little difference in the preva-\nlence of aspirin use between those with dia-\nRolka, Fagot-Campagna, and Narayan\nTable 2--Estimated prevalence of risk factors and regular aspirin use among adults with diabetes\nbut without CVD\nRisk factor* Percent with risk factor Percent aspirin use\nData are % (95% CI). *Categories are not mutually exclusive.

CVD risk factors include family history of heart attack, obe-\nsity, hypertension, smoking, albuminuria, and dyslipidemia.\nrecent survey of members of a U.S. health\nmaintenance organization found that those\nwith diagnosed diabetes had significantly\nlower adjusted odds of using aspirin to\nprevent heart disease than those without\nWe can suggest several possible rea-\nsons for the low rates of aspirin use among\npeople with diabetes. We have mentioned\nthe absence, before 1997, of diabetes-spe-\ncific guidelines. It is conceivable that physi-\ncians have had an exaggerated perception of\nthe risks of aspirin therapy for people with\ndiabetes, particularly those with retinopathy\nor hypertension. Results from the Early\nTreatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study\n(ETDRS) and the Hypertension Optimal\nTreatment (HOT) trial should be noted. The\nETDRS used a relatively high dose of aspirin\n(650 mg/day) in people with diabetes and\nretinopathy, yet showed no significant\nincrease in the risk of severe complications\n(7). In the HOT study, which included\naspirin reduced the risk of myocardial\ninfarction, with no effect on stroke or fatal\nbleeds (23). It is also possible that patients\nwith more severe diabetes may be less moti-\nvated to comply with recommendations for\nmedications. Such patients are often pre-\nscribed multiple therapies, among which\naspirin may be perceived as relatively unim-\nportant. However, in our study, we exam-\nined several markers for diabetes severity\n(duration, HbA\nlevel, and insulin use) and\nfound that none was associated with regu-\nlar aspirin use.\nAmong our most important findings, in\nthe population of individuals with diabetes\nand CVD or risk factors, aspirin was less\nlikely to be used by blacks and Mexican-\nAmericans than by non-Hispanic whites,\neven after adjusting for differences in age,\nCVD, and number of CVD risk factors. This\ndifference was not explained by measured\ndifferences in income or education. In addi-\ntion, younger people were much less likely\nto use aspirin than older people. Among all\nadults (those with diabetes and others) with\nCVD or risk factors, aspirin was less likely to\nbe used by women than by men. Others\nhave observed similar differences in aspirin\nuse (24\u00ad26), and we note reports that other\nCVD treatments may be underused by eth-\nSeveral factors could have biased our\nresults. Although it is likely that some of\nthe regular aspirin users in our sample did\nnot use aspirin expressly for CVD benefit\n(29), it is important to note that the risk of\nCVD is reduced by regular use of aspirin for\nany purpose (including arthritis and pain\nrelief). It is also possible that we counted as\nregular aspirin users a few people who took\nfrequent doses of aspirin for a short time,\nbut not for most of the month, or misclas-\nsified as nonregular users some who did\nnot know how much aspirin they took.\nOur measure of CVD did not include\nhistory of vascular bypass or transient\nischemic attack, and some of our lipid mea-\nsures were available only for NHANES III\nparticipants who had fasted overnight, yet\nwe still found that 98% of all adults with\ndiabetes had CVD or one or more CVD risk\nfactors. Unfortunately, we were unable to\nestimate the prevalence of specific con-\ntraindications to aspirin therapy.\nThe NHANES III data provide national\nbaseline estimates for measuring improve-\nments in the quality of care received by peo-\nple with diabetes. Approximately 10.2\nmillion U.S. adults have diagnosed diabetes\nenteric-coated preparations) and ready avail-\nability make aspirin practical for widespread\nuse. Our study suggests that as many as 8\nmillion people with diabetes who are poten-\ntial candidates for aspirin therapy are not\nusing this effective treatment. Clearly, exten-\nsive efforts are needed to increase aspirin use\namong people with diabetes, and racial and\nethnic minorities should be targeted in these\nefforts. Using guidelines, educating patients,\ninvolving opinion leaders, and carrying out\nother similar interventions can potentially\nachieve the goal of increasing aspirin use\n(30). Preventive measures should be moni-\ntored, and the effectiveness of existing guide-\nlines should be evaluated (31). Including\naspirin in the Diabetes Quality Improve-\nment Program measure sets (32) and in the\nHealth Plan Employer Data and Information\nSet (33) as a measure of the quality of care\nreceived by people with diabetes might also\nencourage regular use.\nThere are important contraindications\nto aspirin use, and even in the absence of\nthese, the individual's level of cardiovascu-\nlar risk must be weighed against the small\nAspirin use among adults with diabetes in the U.S.\nTable 4--Prevalence and odds of regular aspirin use among adults with CVD, one or more CVD\nrisk factors, or age 30 years\nPercent of Percent Adjusted odds 95% CI for\nVariable population aspirin use of aspirin use* OR\nCVD or number of CVD risk factors\nAge (years)\nRace or ethnicity\nSex\nEducation\nIncome\nTotal unweighted sample size 1,263. *Computed from a logistic regression model that included all variables\nlisted in this table; 31 observations were excluded from the logistic regression analysis because of missing val-\nues for education or income.\nbut serious risks of aspirin therapy, particu-\nlarly among those 30 years of age. Still,\nour data suggest that nearly every U.S. adult\nwith diagnosed diabetes has at least one\nmeasurable risk factor for CVD and thus\nmay be considered a potential candidate\nfor aspirin therapy (10).\nReferences\n1.
