Oppel\nhimself later gave popular lectures on astronomy in the Senckenburg Lecture Hall in\nFrankfurt (Kramer, 1967). He was awarded a Doctorate in Philosophy, Philology, and\nMathematics in 1838. Contrary to what was stated in Phillips and Wade (2014), on\nreturning to Frankfurt, Oppel did not immediately return to his old school, the Frankfurt\nGymnasium. He taught physics, maths, and Latin at various institutions as well as to private\npupils. From 1839 to 1841, he was in Milan as a private tutor for John Frederick Mylius\n(Spingardi, 2006), a member of the influential Mylius banking and commercial family. From\n1842, he resumed private and school tuition in Frankfurt and in 1845, he was appointed an\nassistant for mathematics and physics instruction in the Gymnasium, becoming a fully\nAmalie Fritz in 1855 and they had three daughters and a son.

He also contributed papers to the Frankfurt literary journal\nDiaskalia. Even the Frankfurt biographical dictionary entry for Oppel (Klotzer, 1996) makes\nno mention of his scientific work. His papers cover a range of subjects in perception and\nOppel was aware of the apparent distortions that accompany many of the simple figures\nused in teaching geometry. This seems to have been the starting point for his journey into\ngeometrical\u00adoptical illusions.\nGeometrical\u00adOptical Illusions\nPrior to Oppel's (1855) article, research on visual illusions tended to be directed to those that\noccur in the natural environment like the changing apparent size of the moon during its\ntransit, its apparent motion when clouds pass in front of it, the apparent motion of rocks\nafter viewing descending water, and the visibility of afterimages following intense\nstimulation; spatial illusions tended to be associated with ambiguous figures like those in\nRoman mosaics (see Wade, 2016, 2017). All this was to change with the move into the\nlaboratory in the early 19th century; this was heralded by the invention of instruments\n(like the stereoscope and stroboscopic disc) that afforded more stimulus control (Wade &\nHeller, 1997). Two-dimensional (drawn) stimuli were then enlisted to study stereoscopic\nvision and motion perception and their application to spatial distortions followed soon\nafter. Before Oppel's article was published, Fick (1851) described the horizontal\u00advertical\nillusion, and this was discussed at some length by Oppel (but without citing Fick). A\ntorrent of slightly different illusions appeared in the remaining decades of the 19th\ncentury, many of which bear the names of those who published accounts of them: Zo\n\u00a8 llner,\nPoggendorff, Hering, Kundt, Delboeuf, Mach, Helmholtz, Hermann, von Bezold, Mu\n\u00a8 ller-\nLyer, Lipps, Thie\n\u00b4 ry, Wundt, Mu\n\u00a8 nsterberg, Ebbinghaus, and Titchener. Others were added in\nthe 20th century and yet more variations have been introduced with the aid of computer\ngraphics (see Shapiro & Todorovic\nWade et al. 3\nTranslation\nOppel is not the easiest of writers to translate, and we have tried to be faithful to his text.\nIt should be noted that the first illustration in his article is numbered Fig. 2; this is\nbecause the figures were presented on Plates at the end of the journal together with\nfigures from other articles and they were numbered consecutively. The figures were not\naccompanied by legends and so we have placed them close to the text in which they are\ndescribed.\nOn Geometrical\u00adOptical Illusions--By Dr. Phil. J. J. Oppel\nA quite peculiar class of ``optical illusions'' relates to those by which the eye--or more\nprecisely, as with all so-called sensory illusions, actually the unconscious judgment of the\nmind--is in error relative to the dimensions or directions of linear and angular sizes, and\ntherefore they can be appropriately termed geometrical\u00adoptical illusions. They are rather\nsharply differentiated from those that one usually considers to be optical illusions in that\nfor them the reciprocal relations of apparent size (visual angle), actual size, and distance of\nthe seen object have absolutely no relevance, while for the usual so-called optical illusions, it is\nprecisely the dependence relations of these three factors that play the main role. If, as is\nusually the case in the theory of seeing, we call ``visual estimation'' in the special sense that\nability or competence to infer the third one from any two of those three mutually dependent\nquantities, insofar as the necessary operation of the understanding does not reach\nconsciousness, then an optical illusion (in the ordinary meaning of this expression) is\nindeed always a misdirection of visual estimation, which, by assuming the value of one of\nthe two given magnitudes as too high or too small, judges the third, the missing one, wrongly.\nOne thinks, for example, of the apparent magnitude of the rising moon compared with it high\nin the sky; and also the effects in decorative painting.\nIn the case of the ``geometrical\u00adoptical'' illusions, the distance of the object, and therefore\nalso the angle of vision, as far as it changes with it, has no influence whatsoever, as the\nfollowing examples illustrate. Several to my knowledge have not been drawn into the field of\noptical examinations.\nTo begin with a more familiar case, which is easy to observe, and is often demonstrated by\nteachers of geometry: vertical dimensions appear to be greater than corresponding horizontal\nones. Thus, a right-angled rectangle of 800 height on a 8\u00bd00 base line is readily recognized by\nthe most careful observer as a square, while a real square, placed beside it, appears a little \u00bd00\ntoo high. If students draw by free hand a square on the blackboard, it will appear to the naive\nobserver almost without exception to be too wide (relative to the height). It is just as difficult\nto make a simple ratio of 1 to 2 in the case of drawing an oblong, and the error is almost\nalways made in the direction of the horizontal dimension (whether it be the larger or the\nsmaller).\nThe same illusion is manifested in the construction of angles and triangles. An angle of 93\nis drawn on a black tablet so that its line of division would run in the vertical direction, and\nthe eye of the naive observer will readily recognize it as a right angle; if the tablet is now\nturned by a quarter, so that the opening of the angle to the right or to the left, that is, the\n(imaginary) half-line lies horizontally, the angle immediately appears obtuse. On the other\nhand, with an angle of about 87, in the last described position, it is regarded as a right angle,\nwhile, after the rotation of the drawing, a quarter-turn is immediately recognized as an acute\nangle. Conversely, if an isosceles right-angled triangle with a horizontal base is required, the\nmajority of the pupils will draw an obtuse-angled triangle, and if the base is to be vertical,\nthen they will draw an acute triangle.\n4 i-Perception\nLikewise, an ellipse which is cut out of white paper and placed on a black ground, the axes\nof which are 17:18, or even 11:12, is recognized as a circle by naive observers when the longer\naxes are horizontal, but as soon as the figure is rotated by 90, it appears elliptical. If, on the\nother hand, the diameter of a cylinder (such as a glass) standing on a table is to be estimated\nby eye, such that, for example, the vertical distance between the thumb and the index finger\nindicates its height above the surface of the table once it is turned (into the horizontal\norientation), then when it is actually turned, it turns out that it was judged as too small.\nThe counter-experiment (with the original cylinder and the diameter to be indicated in the\nhorizontal direction) is easy to make.\nThe fact that even an oblique line is still easily seen as longer than a horizontal one is the\nresult of the difficulty of correctly drawing an equilateral triangle with a horizontal base on a\nvertical surface: the nai\u00a8ve observer here too makes the base line slightly too long, but the\nerror is recognized immediately when the surface is turned so far that one of its other sides is\nnow horizontal.\nThe explanation of all these illusions is undoubtedly due to the fact that the eye, by\nvirtue of its normal position with regard to the external world, especially relative to the\nsurface of the earth, is accustomed to see much greater dimensions in the horizontal than\nin the vertical direction, and because of this slightly overestimates vertical extents\ncompared with horizontal. It is precisely because of this that the apparent exception\nwhich the human body sometimes makes from the above rule can be understood; as a\nperson lying flat on the ground appears to most observers longer than when he is in an\nupright position--(this is because the eye is especially accustomed to see the human figure\nfar more frequently in an upright position, that is, much larger in its vertical than its\nhorizontal dimensions.)--except if here, which also sounds plausible, the visual angle, or\nrather the angle of incidence of the lines of sight with the principal direction of the body\nexerts an influence, that is, if in the upright position the perspective foreshortening plays a\ngreater role.1\nThe fact that the latter can indeed give rise to some striking illusions is proved by a well-\nknown experiment with a hat and so forth. (Let a person, unaware of the expected result, be\nallowed to look at an ordinary man's cylindrical hat, and then on any wall of the room\nindicate the height to which the hat, placed on the ground, would appear. The error is, as a\nrule, so obvious that it excites the astonishment of anyone who has seen it.)\nTo be sure, in all the experiments mentioned, the results will only be as stated as follows: if\nthe draftsman or observer is really naive, that is, he is not alerted in advance about the\ndirection in which the eye is usually in error since otherwise the conscious effort to prevent\nthe error, will succeed either to avoid it or even to commit the opposite error; this remark, of\ncourse, applies to all the following observations.\nA second set of these geometrical\u00adoptical illusions refers to the relative directions of\nlines, and in which the horizontal or vertical position does not seem to have an influence.\nFirst of all, two observations are worth mentioning, which I owe to the kind\ncommunication from Dr. Poppe (Head Teacher at the College of Trade). If a straight\nline is drawn outside a circle so that it almost touches it, the straight line appears to the\nnaive eye of many observers weakly bent or bowed near the circle, with a convexity\ntoward the circle; the line is thus attracted by the circle, so to speak. Whether the\nstraight line is vertical, or horizontal, or oblique makes no or little difference\n(inasmuch as the result appears to me to be somewhat more marked when the position\nis oblique.). If an obtuse angle (at least 135) (in the manner of Fig. 2) is cut near its apex\nby a straight line, such that the line would be perpendicular to its (imaginary) bisector,\nthe line appears weakly bent or bowed in the middle, that is, it appears an obtuse angle,\nWade et al. 5\nthe opening of which is opposite to the actual obtuse angle.\nStill more striking is the illusion, when two of the angles described are opposed as in Fig. 3,\nand they are intersected by two parallel lines: The latter appears distinctly further from each\nother in their center than on both ends. And here too, the vertical, or horizontal, or oblique\nposition of the figure makes no difference to the occurrence of the described result (though\nperhaps not quite for its magnitude). It is interesting to note, however, that the counter-\nexperiment shown in Fig. 4, in which the obtuse angle acb (of 135), is intersected by a\ndifferent, larger angle mnr (of about 177), which latter is near to uvw and is equal and\nparallel to it: then this third angle uvw appears clearly as an angle (i.e., as a bent line at v), but\nthe second (mnr) appears as a straight line.\nIt is not the case, as might be supposed at first sight, that irradiation plays a role in all\nthese observations. I conclude this from the fact that the same results are obtained when the\nfigures are black on white, or white on a black ground. Only, with regard to the size of the\nangles in question, there seems to be a small degree of variation between the eyes of different\nobservers, since one eye shows a greater, the other a lower sensitivity in the estimation of such\ndirectional differences.\nStill more striking is the result of the first-mentioned experiment (with the straight line\nand the circle): If, instead of one, two straight lines and instead of the whole circle only\n6 i-Perception\narcs of approximately the same linear length and of about 120 are used, as indicated in\nThe parallel lines then appear (for any position of the figure) to be distinctly farther apart\nfrom each other in the vicinity of the circular arcs than at each end; whereas in the counter-\ndemonstration, Fig. 6, the two middle lines can be fairly strongly bent.\nThat is, they may be closer together in the middle, without the eye ceasing to maintain\nthem as parallel (both of them form obtuse angles of about 177). Here too, the results are the\nsame with black lines on white, as with white on black.\nExplaining the illusions under discussion is not entirely easy. That physiological processes\nmight be in play is not probable to me. Rather, I might suggest as a proposal, perhaps\nsufficient, that the eye judges directions (as well as movements) of lines, only through\ncomparisons, and so in general assesses differences in orientation (that is to say angles) as\nWade et al. 7\nlarger wherever judgment of the difference in question is made easier, thanks to closeness of\nthe deviating direction. In this way, for example, in Fig. 4, the difference in orientation\nbetween ac and mn (on account of the simultaneous proximity of both lines to the centre\nof vision) appears greater than the difference between ac and uv, from which comparison, a\nsmall (apparent) difference in orientation of mn and uv must result, so that mn is, as it were,\nmoved into alignment with nr. Similarly in Figs. 5 and 6, the difference in orientation\nbetween the straight lines and the circles in the vicinity of the latter is more apparent to\nthe eye, than at greater distances from them, so that undoubtedly the apparent orientation of\nboth straight lines must be modified (in opposing directions) in the vicinity of the arc.\nWhether this attempt at explanation is valid or sufficient, I leave to the judgment of the\nreader. A readily made observation in its support seems to me to be that if one tries to sketch\nby eye the direction of the streets of a crookedly laid out town, or the intersections at various\nangles of forest paths (and thus tries to lay out a plan or map or them), the acute angles are\nas a rule overestimated, and the obtuse angles (insofar as they are apprehended as angles)\nrather underestimated.\nFinally, a third group of optical illusions in this category comprise those, which concern\nsize relationships of simultaneously observed dimensions (irrespective of vertical or\nhorizontal attitude), in particular the division of surfaces and lines.\nI submit first the following observation.\nand then let a nai\u00a8ve observer lay two quite thin little paper strips of arbitrary length and of\nthe color of the background at right angles over the black strip, and then so adjust their\nposition that the latter appears partitioned into three equal segments. If now we check the\naccuracy of this partitioning with compasses, we will as a rule observe, that--at least at a first\nattempt--the two outer segments, in comparison with the middle one, will turn out rather too\nlarge. The same happens with a white strip of paper on a black ground--evidence, therefore,\nthat in this case irradiation (in the usual sense of the word) plays no role. In the same way,\nand at the same time still more strikingly, we obtain the same result, if the strip is divided not\ninto three, but (with three transverse strips) into four apparently equal parts, or alternatively\nis left partitioned into three, of which the middle one is double in extent.\nThe result of this test is, no doubt, essentially in agreement with the extent to which visual\nestimation of an observer (in the broad sense of the term) is sharpened by practice, as well as\nby the amount of time and care taken in the equal partitioning of the adjacent segments.\nThe result in question is still more clearly and certainly apparent, when we do not have the\nobserver carry out the partitioning himself, but set before him previously partitioned strips\nfor the assessment. Should we choose, for example, two strips, of which one has been divided\nexactly into three equal parts (with fine transverse lines) and the other so divided that the\nmiddle segment is just a very little too short, the majority of observers will judge the latter as\nthe one equally partitioned; whereas to the contrary no error occurs, when beside the\ncorrectly partitioned strip we place a second, in which the middle segment is a little too\nlong. Most convincingly of all, finally, is a test with two such strips, one of them with the\nmiddle segment a little too large and the other by an equal amount too small: in this case, all\nobservers judge the latter as more accurately partitioned.\nIn a similar way, if we divide for example an octavo sheet of paper with vertical lines into\nthree columns of equal width, the two outer ones appear somewhat smaller than the one in\nthe middle.\nTo convince myself of the extent to which the thickness of the partitioning lines might have\nsome influence, I repeated the tests described with strips which were partitioned (not with\n8 i-Perception\nvery fine lines, but) with black lines of 0.100 width, taking care however to add to both ends of\nthe partitioned paper strip half the width of such partitioning lines (0.0500) also in black\ncolor, so that the intervening spaces left white were equal- or were unequal, in the way\ndescribed: the result was however exactly the same (as also against a grayish or brownish\nbackground).\nWhen by chance I mentioned these observations to a skilled and experienced artist, they\ndid not really come to him as news: rather, he confirmed my belief that we can note similar\nvisual misjudgments with all equally partitioned surfaces (the facades of a building,\ncolonnades, etc.) in that consistently the outer-lying parts, adjacent to the ``air,'' appear\nsomewhat smaller, because as he put it in his over-blown artistic terms, ``each time the air\ngobbles them up,'' that is to say, the background decreases the apparent extent of the\nsurfaces lying adjacent to it; and indeed that allowance was made already in ancient\narchitecture, consciously or instinctively, for this tendency of the eye. Irradiation does not\nappear to me responsible in this case on the grounds already set forth earlier: rather, I am\nmuch more inclined here again to invoke an effect on the extended surface of the background\nwhich through greater or lesser proximity facilitates or inhibits comparison.\nA second experiment that is relevant here is the following:\nSuppose we construct with fine white, or alternatively black strips, on an accordingly black\nor white background, two obtuse triangles with unequal sides of, for example, 700, 12\u00bd00, and\n1600, so that the latter edge forms the base of the triangles. In one of these two triangles, we\ndivide this base exactly and draw up from the midpoint a transversal (of the same color as the\nsides of the triangles) to the apex. In the other by contrast, we draw the transversal from a\npoint on the base, which lies about 1/400 nearer to the smallest angle. If we now ask a naive\nobserver, before whom we lay out the two triangles side by side, in which one the bisection of\nthe base appears accurate, he will as a rule choose the latter, in which one half is longer than\nSome small variations on the experiment, with moveable transversals, will suggest\nthemselves easily. However, this will generally only succeed if we involve only such\npersons who do not through practice possess truly experienced visual estimation, and even\nin that case the correct relationship will often be reported as a consequence of somewhat\nlonger and more careful observation.\nOn the other hand, the illusion remains robust in the following case. We construct in the\nsame way two congruent obtuse triangles (as in Figs. 9 and 10) with sides, for example, of 700,\n1500, and 1000 (once again with the last as the horizontal base) and divide the base as before\nWade et al. 9\nwith a transversal, in one triangle exactly, in the other shifted about 0.400 from the middle\ntoward the obtuse angle.\nHere again, the question as to which base is most correctly bisected is as a rule answered in\nerror. The illusion arises in this case, in comparison with the previous experiment, exactly in\nthe opposite sense; yet, the explanation confirms that already advanced. That is to say, the\neye apparently misassociates the bisection of the (small) angle at the apex with the bisection\nof the base, and holds the bisection of the latter in that case for more accurate, in which the\npartition of the former approaches the correct bisection.\nStill more striking is finally the following observation, which I have regularly made when\nteaching geometry.\nWe draw in acircleof arbitraryradius(asin Fig. 11), two diametersatright angles, andfrom the\nends of each construct arcs, of the same radius, to the extent that they fall within the\naforementioned circle, whose circumference is, as is well known, dividedinto 12equal arcs(of 30).\nThe equality of these 12 segments appears, however, to most pupils at first glance so\nunbelievable, with, in particular, the middle of the three segments in each quadrant\nappearing so much larger that they are disinclined to try to prove the correctness of the\ngeometrical construction.\nThe basis for the illusion here again lies in the partial misassociation by the eye of the\npartitioning of the area of the quadrant with that of its perimeter, misled by the inequality of\nthe former to judge the latter also as unequal. We see this immediately if, having made the 12-\nfold division of the circumference, the inner arcs (of the same radius) are inverted that is to\nsay drawn out as from points m, n, r, s, and so forth as in Fig. 12 (now naturally as arcs of\nonly 60) whereby the illusion immediately vanishes or is even reversed.\nThe correctness of the explanatory principle indicated follows also from a related\nsimplification of the experiment, which, for example, might take the form that we bisect\nthe two longer sides of a rectangle with an arc, as shown in Fig. 13, whose center lies in\nthe middle of one of the two smaller sides: here again, the eye readily attributes to the division\nof the contours the inequality of the partitioning of the area.\nA similar illusion appears if, as shown in Figs. 14 and 15, parallel lines are divided into\nthree segments with arcs, as will be apparent with just a glance at the figures, and so forth.\nThat the same principle also applies with partitioning using straight lines under similar\ncircumstances is shown, for example, in Fig. 16, where a perpendicular constructed from the\nmiddle of the base of an obtuse triangle appears strikingly nearer to the apex of the acute\nangle and so forth.\nCommentary\nOppel gave the simple figures that induced spatial distortions the label geometrical\u00adoptical\nillusions in order to confine them to the relatively small but reliable distortions of visual\nspace, mostly in the domains of size or orientation. This implicit classification has proved too\nrestrictive as some combine both dimensions and others involve different dimensions\naltogether. Vicario (2011) listed 26 different classifications! Perhaps the simplest is the one\nproposed by Boring (1942): extent, direction, and the rest. The common factors of the\nclassifications are direction (orientation), size, contrast, assimilation, and perspective. Some\nsystems are concerned with the distorted dimensions (like size and orientation), others\ninvolve possible underlying processes (like assimilation and contrast, and eye movements),\nand yet others characterize the levels at which the illusions should be considered (like\nphysical, physiological, and psychological). Oppel touches on all these factors in his article.\nIn his introductory remarks, Oppel states that geometrical\u00adoptical illusions are clearly\ndifferent from what are usually called optical illusions, such as in the moon illusion. He\nconsidered that the other optical illusions are characterized by the relations of three\nquantities, apparent size (visual angle), real size, and distance of objects, and they are\nbased on the fact that if one of a pair of these magnitudes is wrongly set too high or too\nlow, the third one is judged incorrectly. In contrast, geometrical\u00adoptical illusions are not\ninfluenced by either the distance or the visual angle of the display.\nHis account commences with the observation that vertical dimensions generally appear\nlarger than corresponding equal horizontal dimensions. The discussion gives the impression\nthat the phenomenon was in common currency among teachers of geometry so that there was\nno need to cite Fick (1851). Indeed, Oppel's article is free from references to others. His\nexamples of horizontal\u00advertical illusions include a variety of figures like rectangles, ellipses,\ncylinders, and triangles. Oppel claimed that the explanation of all these phenomena is\n``without doubt'' the fact that the eye is accustomed to see much larger extents in the\nhorizontal than in the vertical orientation, and thus out of habit slightly overestimates the\nvertical extents. This leads him to examine figures which display apparent angle expansion,\ncontour attraction, and repulsion as well as illusions of extent due to line intersections.\nSome of Oppel's designs (Figs. 11 to 15) bear a certain similarity to the famous\nconfiguration introduced much later by Mu\n\u00a8 ller-Lyer (1889). This relation was noted by\n\u00a8 ller-Lyer himself was apparently unaware of\nOppel's work, since he did not cite Oppel in his papers. There are similar precursors to the\norientation illusions associated with Zo\n\u00a8 llner (1860). One of Oppel's colleagues noted that\nwhen two lines forming an obtuse angle cross a straight line, the latter looks as if slightly bent\nor broken (his Fig. 3). A similar small bulging effect appears when the two parallel lines are\nalmost touched by circular arcs (Fig. 5).\nOppel followed his ground-breaking paper of 1855 with two more on geometrical\u00adoptical\nillusions (Oppel, 1857, 1861) illustrations from which are shown in Figure 2. Nine figures\nwere included in the first supplement (eight images in the first three rows, and left image in the\nfourth row in Figure 2), and several types of illusion were discussed. One involved errors in\nlocating the midpoints of lines embedded in simple geometrical configurations (left and\nmiddle image in the first row). This effect is closely related, if not identical, to the Thie\n\u00b4 ry-\nthis effect, see Todorovic\nthe readers to inspect but also reported quantitative data in the form of the number of\nobservers who experienced the illusion (in one case 85 out of 88). In addition, he included\na control experiment with a related configuration for which there was no illusion (right image\nin first row). Another type of effect involved errors in the judgments of areas of geometrical\nfigures (three images in second row). One of his several examples was a circle surrounded by\nan annulus which has the same area as the circle; his students stated that the area of the\nannulus looked smaller than that of the circle. He also claimed that if a sequence of figures is\npresented all of which have approximately the same area (a triangle, a square, a pentagon, a\nhexagon, a heptagon, an octagon, and a circle), then the members of the sequence look\nincreasingly smaller in area (both to nai\u00a8ve and trained observers, but to the latter only\nwhen they inspected the figures casually). He also reported that some observations on\nperceived lengths of segments of lines (illustrated in two images in the third row), which,\nlike some figures in the first paper, were anticipations of the Mu\n\u00a8 ller-Lyer illusion.\nThe second supplement (Oppel, 1861) included five illustrations (the two images on the\nright in row 4 and the three images in row 5 in Figure 2) and was also concerned with a\nnumber of phenomena. He was surprised when he saw a professional painter use a compass\nto measure the correct distance to paint the reflection of a rock from the water level. The\npainter explained that the reason was to avoid an illusion, whose presence Oppel confirmed\nfor himself when his judgment of the distance turned out to be too short. He also claimed that\nin several wall frescos from Pompeii depicting Narcissus admiring his own reflection in a\npool, the reflection was painted too high. Prompted by these observations, Oppel conducted a\nstudy with 40 observers who each made 10 quantitative judgments on various configurations,\nwhich he described but did not illustrate, and whose data were reported in full in a table.\nHowever, the results turned out to be somewhat ambiguous. Another effect involved\ndistributing several equidistant dots along the longer diagonal of a rhombus, and noting\nthat the distances nearest to the corners looked shortest (the three images in the bottom row).\nThis observation anticipates the results of Warren and Bashford (1977), Post, Welch, and\nCaufield (1998), and Predebon (2001), all of whom found that the illusory shortening of the\nshaft in the wings-in version of the Mu\n\u00a8 ller-Lyer illusion is not uniform but confined to the\nregion near the vertices of the wings. Finally, Oppel devoted less than a page, without any\naccompanying figures, to the observation that undivided lines or areas appear smaller than\nwhen they are divided, an effect now known as the Oppel-Kundt or filled-space illusion\n(Kundt, 1863; Wackermann, 2017). It is ironic that the only geometrical\u00adoptical illusion\nwith which Oppel's name is linked is one that he did not illustrate. His example involved\nsquares which, as he already noted in the 1855 paper, are drawn wider (horizontally) than\nthey are tall (vertically). Here, he noted that this difference is even larger when the task is to\ndraw a square on a paper with horizontal lines (with the side of the square being equal to four\nor five times the distance between the lines), so that the square is divided into several parts in\nFigure 2. Illusion figures presented in Oppel (1857, 1861). The eight images in the first three rows and the\nleft image in the fourth row are from Oppel (1857); the two images on the right in fourth row and the three\nimages in fifth row are from Oppel (1861).\nthe vertical direction. Oppel realized that in this case, the effect is confounded with the\ngeneral exaggeration of the vertical dimension, described in his first paper, and suggested\nan ``easy control experiment'' in which the lined paper is turned by 90, so that the lines are\nnow vertical. He noted that in this case, the width of the drawn figure is still wider than its\nheight, but to a smaller extent than before. In both papers, Oppel reported some observations\non architectural details, illustrated in the fourth row of Figure 2.\nConclusion\nOppel (1855) performed a service to visual science by defining a subset of illusion figures that\nhave been investigated intensively ever since. In addition, he presented precursors of\norientation and size illusions that are associated with the names of later researchers.\n"
