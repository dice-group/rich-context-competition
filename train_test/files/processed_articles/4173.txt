Recently, several studies have\nidentified close relationships between\nmiRNAs and disease,4,6\u00ad9 leading to the\nconstruction of dozens of miRNA-related\ndatabases. For example, miR2Disease, a\nresource of miRNAs that are dysregulated\nin human diseases, currently includes 3273\nmiRNA\u00addisease relationship entries.10\nA common strategy to explore potential\ndisease-related miRNAs is to identify\nmiRNAs that are differentially expressed in\na disease state using technologies such as\nquantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-\nPCR, miRNA microarray analysis, or\nsmall RNA deep sequencing. Alternatively,\ncell transcriptional responses to various\ntreatments or perturbations can be com-\npared using algorithms such as Gene Set\nEnrichment Analysis (GSEA)11 and large\ngene expression profiling datasets to quan-\ntitatively calculate the relevance of different\nperturbations. The first large-scale effort to\napply this principle was the Connectivity\nMap project, which aimed to find potential\nconnections among molecule treatments,\ndisease states, and other bioprocesses by\nquerying large-scale expression profiling\ndata and validated gene sets.12 Since then,\nseveral studies have also demonstrated the\nfeasibility of this approach in drug repos-\nHypothetically, because miRNAs are\nintegrated into regulatory networks that\ninfluence target and other downstream\ngenes, cell transcriptional responses against\nmiRNA perturbations (either overexpres-\nsion or knockdown) may reflect the tran-\nscriptional response of the related disease\nstate to some extent. Thus, miRNA\u00addisease\nrelationships can be identified using this\ntranscriptional response comparison strat-\negy. Previously, Jiang et al. suggested that it\nmight be possible to determine miRNA\u00ad\ndrug links by integrating miRNA targets\nwith the expression profiles of cancers\nand cell responses to small molecules.16\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, no\ninvestigation has directly compared the\ntranscriptional responses induced by both\nmiRNA genotype variation and disease.\nRecently, our group developed the\nExpTreeDB database, which allows users\nto mine relationships among manually\ncurated perturbations such as agent treat-\nment, genotype variation, disease state,\nstress, and infection.17 In this study, we\nexplored miRNA\u00addisease relationships\nusing this methodology and datasets from\nthe Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We\ncollected global transcriptional response\ndatasets representing 40 human diseases\nand 30 miRNA variation treatments. Pair-\nwise similarities were calculated to identify\nputative miRNA\u00addisease links for a litera-\nture investigation and experimental valid-\nation in three diseases: inflammatory bowel\ndisease (IBD), oesophageal cancer, and\ncolorectal cancer. We found that miR-200 c\nwas significantly overexpressed in oesopha-\ngeal cancer. However, we did not observe\nthe consistently upregulated expression of\ncancer.\nMethods\nSpecimens\nSubjects in this study were recruited by\nZhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, and\nincluded five oesophageal cancer patients\n(four men and one woman; average age,\n67 years), five colorectal cancer patients\n(three men and two women; average age, 62\nyears), and five IBD patients (two Crohn's\ndisease cases and three ulcerative colitis cases;\nfour women and one man; average age,\n38 years). The diagnosis of all patients had\nbeen confirmed by pathology. Patients with\ncancer were free of other malignant neo-\nplasms, and had not undergone radiother-\napy or chemotherapy.\nThis work was approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of Zhejiang Provincial People's\nInformed consent was obtained from all\nsubjects prior to their participation.\nTwo 1\u00c21 cm tissue samples and the 5 cm\nmargin of each carcinoma sample were\nobtained during surgical resection. All sam-\nples were washed with saline solution then\nimmediately placed into 2 ml RNAlater\nsolution and stored at 4C overnight\n(>16h). The tissues were then stored at\n\u00c080C until required for analysis. Tissue\nsamples from IBD and corresponding\nnormal tissues were collected during pre-\ntreatment endoscopic biopsies and prepared\nas described above.\nRNA isolation from clinical tissues\nTotal RNA was isolated using TRIzol\nreagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA).\nTissues were centrifuged at 2000 rpm, speed\n500 xg for 5 min, then cell pellets were\nhomogenized in 1.0 ml TRIzol reagent and\nincubated at room temperature for 5 min.\nEach sample was treated with 200 ml of\nchloroform, repeatedly inverted for 15 s,\nthen incubated at room temperature for\n10 min. Samples were then centrifuged at\nourless supernatant was transferred to a\nfresh tube and treated with the same\nvolume of isopropyl alcohol. After incuba-\ntion at 4C for 10 min, samples were again\nthe supernatant was removed, and the pellet\nwas washed with 75% ethanol. Samples\n5 min at 4C, with removal of the super-\nnatant after the first centrifugation, then the\npellet was dried at room temperature and\ndissolved in RNase-free water. The RNA\nconcentration was quantified by a\n(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).\ncDNA was synthesized according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol (Promega).\nBriefly, 10 -ml reverse transcription reactions\ncontained 2 nM miRNA RT primers,\nscriptase, and 1 mg total RNA. Conditions\nwere as follows: 16C for 30 min followed by\ntime PCR system contained 10 ml SYBR\nPremix Ex Taq, 0.5 ml upstream primer,\ncDNA, and 8 ml RNase-free H2\nO. The reac-\ntion was incubated at 95C for 30 s, followed\n30 s. miRNA expression was analysed using\nthe 2 \u00c0\u00c1\u00c1Ct method, and U6 was selected as\nthe control gene. Primer sequences are\nshown in Table S1. SPSS 17.0 software was\nused to perform statistical analysis. Data\nwere shown as the mean \u00c6 SD. The t-test\nwas used for analysis between cancer tissue\nand adjacent normal tissue or between\ndisease and control group. Significance was\nGene expression profiling data collection\nWe downloaded human global gene expres-\nsion profiles representing transcriptional\nresponses to miRNA perturbations and\ndisease states from GEO dataset (GDS)\nrecords produced by two platforms, the\narray (GPL570) and the Affymetrix human\nhuman microarray platforms are the most\nfrequently used in GEO and include over\nGDS records with a ``disease state'' subtype\ndescription were downloaded as disease\nstate datasets and were manually examined\nin ExpTreeDB.17 Datasets related to\nmiRNA perturbations were downloaded\nfrom GEO series (GSE) resources, and\ndetailed treatments as well as miRNA\nentries were manually extracted. A similar\napproach was used to obtain small RNA\nsilencing datasets. We required that one\ngene expression profile related to a given\nperturbation must include a blank control\ngroup so that transcriptional responses to\nperturbations could be clearly defined.\nGenerating a ranked gene list\nWithin each GEO dataset, we manually\nselected the experimental group of a par-\nticular perturbation. The experimental\ngroups were then manually matched to\nnormal control groups. Specific genotype\nvariations and disease states were defined\nas ``perturbations'' to cells that induce\ntranscriptional responses. Following the\napproach used in ExpTreeDB,17 we gener-\nated a phenotype ranked list (PRL) to\ndenote the transcriptional response to a\nperturbation such as miRNA overexpres-\nsion, gene silencing, or disease state. In\nbrief, pair-wise global gene expression\nfold-changes were calculated, and all\nfold-change lists under a certain perturb-\nation were merged into a PRL using a\nhierarchical majority voting scheme to pre-\nvent poor representation of heterogeneous\nexperimental settings.20 Thus, the genes\nshowing the highest level of up/down-\nregulation (presented as microarray probe\nnames) under each permutation were placed\nat the top/bottom of the corresponding\nFor the disease state, two perturbations\nwere defined to a different extent: a descrip-\ntion of the disease, such as IBD, and the\nprovision of more detailed information about\nstage or subtype, such as ulcerative colitis\n(UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). We generated\nPRLs for both definitions, and correlation\ncalculations showed that the two PRLs had\nhigh correlation coefficients (Enrichment\nstudy we employed a general description of\ndisease states and perturbation definitions\n(Table 1 and Figure 1).\nSimilarity determinations based on\nthe GSEA algorithm\nWe quantified pair-wise similarities among\nPRLs as correlation scores based on GSEA.\nFollowing the strategy used by Iorio\nbottom 250 probes as gene signatures. The R\npackage Gene Expression Signature with\nintegrated GSEA was used for the similarity\ncalculations.21 In brief, the enrichment of a\nsignature in a PRL is estimated by the\nKolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test for uniform dis-\ntributions. The signature of permutation A\nis represented as (upA\n, downA\n), with upA\nrepresenting the top 250 probe sets and\ndownA\nrepresenting the bottom 250 ones.\nThe final similarity score of PRLs between\nperturbation A and B (SA, B\n) is defined as the\naverage enrichment score:\nSA,B \u00bc\nA\n\u00fe ESupA\nB\n\u00c0 ESdownB\nA\n\u00c0 ESdownA\nA\np\nis the enrichment score of signature s\n(up- and down-regulated parts separated)\nwith respect to the PRL p. Thus, positive\nsimilarity scores represent similar regulation\ntendencies, while negative correlation scores\nrepresent opposite regulation tendencies.\nResults\nOverview of miRNA\u00addisease similarities\nFrom GSE records, we obtained transcrip-\ntional responses including genotype\nvariation of 30 miRNAs for nine knock-\ndown and 21 overexpression treatments.\nVariations in Drosha, importin 8 (IPO8),\nand DGCR8 were also included for\ntheir functions in miRNA biogenesis.\nTranscriptional responses representing 42\ndistinct disease states were collected from\nGDS records. Based on a GSEA-centred\npipeline, we calculated the pair-wise simila-\nrities between the transcriptional responses\nof miRNA variations and disease states\n(Figure 2(a)). We found that the overall\nmiRNA\u00addisease similarity values followed a\nnormal distribution (mean \u00bc \u00c00.002, vari-\nobserved some outliers with extreme simi-\nlarity scores.\nCorrelated miRNA\u00addisease links\nWe next focused on highly correlated tran-\nscriptional responses to miRNA variation\nand disease states.
