This transformation coincides with the growth of the new urban\nmiddle classes and the concomitant emergence of new forms of public urban\nculture. The proliferation of cities as theatres of the spectacle also allows for the\ndevelopment of polymorphous public culture organised around the consumption of\na range of goods and services such as yoga, artisanal beer, olive oil, tea, ice cream,\nbread and coffee.\nThere is a growing body of literature connecting the rise of the new urban middle\nclasses to the development of the cognitive\u00adcultural economy and gentrification, on the\none hand, and the proliferation of new consumption practices and identities, on the\nother hand (Scott, 2012; Zukin, 2010). A growing number of case studies, additionally,\nhighlight particular aspects of these processes in different cities such as Amsterdam\n(Gelmers and Rath, 2015), Glasgow (Shaker Ardekani and Rath, in press), Tehran\nJournal of Consumer Culture\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/joc\nCorresponding author:\nReza Shaker Ardekani, Graduate School of Social Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Nieuwe Achtergracht\nEmail: reza.shaker@gmail.com\n(McEwan et al., 2015). Although the literature provides valuable insights into\nlocal contexts and idiosyncrasies of the new urban middle classes, little compara-\ntive work has been done so far. Despite the fact that they live in sometimes totally\ndifferent cities with different contextual opportunities, we argue that the new\nurban middle classes have particular qualities and characteristics in common,\nsome of which expressed through consumption practices. Comparative studies\nbetween different societies are of importance for understanding what the potential\nconvergences are and what may be contributing to the convergence among the\nnew urban middle classes.\nWe decided to ethnographically examine some of the shared characteristics of\nthe new urban middle classes in diverse urban environments by focusing on a\nparticular consumption space: specialty coffee bars. As demonstrated by Hyra\nis a beverage rich in identity value and popular among the new urban middle\nclasses. Focusing on specialty coffee bars opens up an interesting window to\nengage with this group, closely observe their styles of consumption, decipher\ntheir polysemic rituals of consumption and to eventually identify their common\ntraits. Moreover, the cosmopolitan nature of coffee as a global commodity as well\nas the ubiquity of specialty coffee bars in urban settings in different parts of the\nworld demonstrates that these social spaces of lifestyle are highly relevant sites to\nstudy the class practices of the new urban middle classes in a cross-national\ninvestigation.\nWe have selected sites in three cities: Tehran, Glasgow and Amsterdam. Situated\nin both the Global South and North, these cities vary highly in terms of levels of\nengagement with globalisation, class relations and social, cultural and political\npositioning of coffee bars. Our ethnographic sites provide us with an opportunity\nto explore any common grounds among the new middle-class coffee people.\nOverall, through a small-N cross-national ethnography of regulars of specialty\ncoffee bars in Tehran, Glasgow and Amsterdam, the research contributes to the\nliterature on the proliferation of the new urban middle classes and the ways in\nwhich they are developing particular urban lifestyles. After situating the research\nin the current literature on the new urban middle classes, consumption, class\nexpression and specialty coffee, the methodology and findings of the research\nwill be presented.\nThe new urban middle classes and their polysemic rituals\nof consumption\nThe new urban middle classes are not `new' according to their social composition\nas they are part of the broader middle classes; as a social classification, they con-\nstitute a rather heterogeneous, ambiguous, elusive category of people. Engaged in\noccupations that require significant levels of human capital, they are typically\ncategorised as neither too rich nor too poor, broadly able to lead a comfortable\n2 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0)\nlife, enjoying stable housing, healthcare, educational opportunities and discretion-\nary disposable income to spend on vacation and leisure pursuits (Kharas and\nGertz, 2010; Mathur, 2010). Their newness is considered primarily by their profes-\nsional class, based on knowledge rather than property, which is highly related to\npost-industrial societies and post-Fordist production logics. They appear to con-\nstantly redefine middle-class identity and are often celebrated for having liberal\nattitudes yet marked by new consumption practices associated with resource-\nintensive lifestyles (Lange and Meier, 2009). Their educational background,\nadditionally, assists them to subjectively differentiate themselves from old, trad-\nitional middle classes through their engagement with political debates as well as a\nbroad, eclectic taste in cultural items. Thus, the concept refers to more than just an\nincome group: it comprises social, political, environmental and economic dimen-\nsions and likewise operates as a cultural construct combining both tradition and\nmodernity in its ideologies and consumption styles (Anantharaman, 2014; Jayne,\nThe reasons behind consumption practices of the new urban middle class are\nmany and anything but univocal or coherent and can be configured in various\nways. From theories of practice, this class can be grasped as a class-in-practice,\ndefined by its everyday, mundane consumption practices through which they per-\nof distinction, this class employs consumption as a communicator and a sign of\ndistinction in order to subjectively and objectively define and demarcate their social\nposition. In so doing, members of this class express their identities through\nsymbolic representation in taste and lifestyle and a desired focus on symbolic\nrather than material rewards (Warde, 2015).\nBesides public performance and symbolic class expression, they share a vision of\nconsumer sovereignty, a desire for a certain quality of life that involves both\ncollective goods (the neighbourhood and the city where they live in as well as\nenvironmental concerns, equality and democracy) and private happiness.\nToday's new urban middle classes tend to operate around the idea that they can\nand must control themselves through, among other things, looking after their\nbodies, state of health and the environment (Sassatelli, 2007). They are what\nCohen (2000) would call `citizen consumers', who simultaneously fulfil personal\ndesires and civic obligations through their consumption practices.\nConcepts of identity, lifestyle, distinction and consumption practice of the new\nurban middle classes, moreover, converge in the aestheticisation of everyday life.\nWithin contemporary consumer culture, lifestyle connotes individuality, self-\nexpression, aesthetic reflexivity and stylistic self-consciousness. One's body, clothes,\nspeech, leisure pastimes, eating and drinking preferences, choice of holidays, envir-\nonmental concerns and political orientation are to be regarded as indicators of the\nindividuality of taste and aesthetic sense of style (Featherstone, 2007; Latham,\n2003). Arguably, the new urban middle classes engage an invisible ink strategy\nto objectively and subjectively demarcate their class boundaries, the symbolic,\nembodied and experiential aspects of their class aesthetics (Guthman, 2003).\nShaker Ardekani and Rath 3\nWith their high cultural and economic resources, the new urban middle classes\nreject mass-produced, standardised and impersonal commodities and embrace\ngoods and services that are designed to cater to a personal sense of worth.\nThey increasingly look towards emotional and intimate commodities, exemplified\nby the recent proliferation of artisanal goods, the move towards quality in gourmet\nfood and beverages, the growth of personal fitness and beauty products, the expan-\nsion of the tourist trade and travelling agencies, the exponential rise of the catering\nand hospitality industries, the growth in the home-improvement sector and the\nSocially constructed and socially maintained, the new urban middle classes\nmanage their identities through the processes of public performance via placing\nan emphasis on frequent visits to the everyday social spaces of lifestyles where they\ncan express, perform and practice their embodied and symbolic sense of class.\nThe new interest in artisanal market and recent engagement with aesthetic goods\nand services, such as, among others, craft beer bars, specialty coffee bars, wine\nbars, fusion restaurants, artisanal bakeries, vintage shops, ethnic catering and\nethnic therapies, indicate a fundamental shift in the consumption practices of the\nnew urban middle classes. In fact, through focusing on artisanship and sensual\nexperience, these new urban consumption spaces seem to be attractive for the new\nurban middle classes who prefer natural, quality goods and services. Highly visible\nsigns of gentrification, these consumption spaces not only supply the material needs\nof the new urban middle classes, but also the aesthetics of their offerings and\natmosphere provide cultural capital for these groups, validate the judgment of\ntheir tastes and lifestyles and reinforce a sense of authentic self-expression and\ncreative cultural distinction (Zukin et al., 2015).\nDespite the existing rich literature and current thick description of the new\nurban middle classes, their consumption practices and styles of living, there are\nfew international studies on them. What qualities do they share? As a first inter-\nvention to answering this broad question, we have narrowed down our scope of\ninvestigation and focused on specialty coffee bars and their patrons. Coffee has\nlong been a part of daily diets and social rituals; however, like craft beer, cocktails,\ntea, chocolate and bread, coffee is experiencing an artisanal spring. Some coffee\naficionados call this the third wave of coffee. Manzo (2010) provides a timeline\nabout the different coffee waves:\nThe first wave, according to the coffee geeks, refers to how coffee was prepared and\nconsumed in, say, the 1950s until, say, the early 1990s, when coffee was a caffeine\ndelivery system prepared in percolators or massive urns in offices and banquet halls.\nThe second wave refers to that period, starting in the early 1990s, when coffeehouse\nchains (Starbucks, Gloria Jean's, The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, Second Cup, etc.)\nwere founded and became common features in urban storefronts and suburban malls.\nThe second wave purveyors, this history claims, laid the groundwork for the third\nwave, which comprises small-batch artisanal coffee roasters and independent or small\nchain coffeehouses that are themselves part of a supply chain including a collection of\n4 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0)\nfield-to-cup actors starting with direct-trade growers with whom the coffee brokers,\nroasters, and cafe owners are understood to have relationships. (p. 143)\nTrendy, hip espresso bars and cool specialty coffeehouses are mushrooming in\nalmost all big cities across the globe, becoming synonymous with contemporary\nurban living (Bookman, 2014). They have marked a distinct break with a past\ncharacterised by mass production and consumption, distinguishing themselves by\nproviding high-quality coffees derived from distinct processes of planting, harvest-\ning, washing, drying, milling, roasting, grinding, brewing and cupping (Specialty\nCoffee Association of America (SCAA), 2015).\nCompared to other lifestyle goods and services such as chocolate, designer goods\nor yoga classes, specialty coffee bars have not only appeared to be more visible in\nthe everyday urban sphere and attracted a wider section of urbanites but have also\nshown how production and consumption has shifted from quantity towards quality\nand from mass to niche markets. Providing high-profile products that reflect a\ncreative, aesthetic production and consumption, specialty coffee bars seem to be\nthe local manifestation of a certain mentality in which coffee is a way of life.\nIn other words, drinking specialty coffee is a way of actualising a philosophy of\nlife and a nonverbal communicative act of identity. As such, it entails elaborate\ncodes of conduct, sociability and aesthetic appreciation which are institutionally\nsustained and enforced as well as subjectively learned through a self-disciplining\nprocess.\nThe consumption of relatively expensive specialty coffee, moreover, is under-\nstood to contain numerous social, cultural, sensual, embodied and symbolic mean-\nings by which everyday needs and consumption are linked to identities and\nlifestyles of the new urban middle classes. Coffee people seek to practice their\nsense of class and to differentiate themselves from the dullness of mass culture\nby consuming quality products. In other words, sipping coffee is not only about\ndrinking coffee but also about navigating through countless tastes, flavours and\nsmells of coffee, selecting a specific coffee bean coming from a specific country and\nfarm, derived from a distinct process, brewed and cupped by a skilled, professional\nbarista, using a certain type of machine and equipment, enriched by adding a\nspecific type and amount of sugar, syrup and milk. This occurs in a particular\nspace with a specific interior design fostering a leisurely ambiance within a par-\nticular neighbourhood. Simply put, where to go and what to drink have become\nkey avenues for class distinction and practice.\nData and methodology\nWhat is assumed within the reviewed literature is that links are present between the\naesthetic consumption and class practices of the new urban middle classes and the\nhuman capital derived from their educational background, occupational class\nand social networks. The literature has little to say about shared traits and char-\nacteristics that appear across seemingly vastly different contexts, with different\nShaker Ardekani and Rath 5\ncombinations of and interplays between their cultural and economic capital. In this\nrespect, via focusing on a cross-case analysis, this research investigates the shared\nconsumption practices and characteristics of new urban middle-class coffee people\nin three cities crossing the conventional Global South and North research divide:\nTehran, Glasgow and Amsterdam.\nThese cases vary highly in terms of engagement in the global currents of\neconomy and culture. As a global city, Amsterdam has been involved with the\ncognitive\u00adcultural economy since the early stages of deindustrialisation (Shaker\nArdekani, 2016a). The city has managed to boost its economy through fostering\ninvestment in cognitive and cultural sectors as well as advanced producer services\nAmsterdam has successfully attracted a huge number of urban professionals with\nhigh cognitive and cultural skills. Deindustrialisation, on the other hand, has left\nGlasgow with some of the worst socio-economic problems in Britain. Yet, now the\ncity seems to be alluring the new middle classes through a process of re-urbanisa-\ntion, seemingly finding its place amidst economic and cultural globalisation\nthrough a host of energetic cultural\u00adfinancial initiatives (Turok and Bailey,\n2004). On the other side of the spectrum stands Tehran which, for a variety of\nreasons, has weak connections with the global process of urban development, and\nthe current literature has little to say about its local specificities particularly regard-\ning the class practices of its new urban middle classes (Shaker Ardekani, 2016b).\nThe selected cities, moreover, differ in terms of the rigidity of their class systems.\nEconomic background and the class of origin hierarchically differentiate social\ngroups within Tehran; however, the class compositions in Glasgow and, to a\nhigher degree, in Amsterdam derive mostly from occupation, education and cul-\ntural competencies. The nature of public urban culture also varies considerably and\ncasts an important role for frequenting coffee bars. It could be argued that specialty\ncoffee bars in Glasgow and Amsterdam are more or less gender-neutral urban\nspaces, and patronising them goes along with Bourdieu's theory of distinction as\nwell as theories of practice. In Tehran, however, coffee shops are evidently a\nmore gendered urban space and encourage the pseudo-emancipation of women\npromoting a sense of aesthetic socio-political resistance (Shaker Ardekani, 2015a,\nUsing qualitative ethnographic research methods in a small-N cross-national\nstudy, the investigation analyses regulars of specialty coffee bars within and\nbetween the selected cities. The within-case comparison is of central importance\nand contributes to the depth of the research and guides the study to identify\ncommon patterns of regulars, their characteristics, motivations and social prac-\ntices. In other words, our ethnographic research has provided us with a means\nthrough which it is possible to analyse the culture of coffee people from the\nperspective of its members. Unlike ethnographies in one setting, cross-national\nethnography allows us to directly reflect upon the structural, underlying factors\nthat explain the shared class practices of the new urban middle classes in different\nurban societies.\n6 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0)\nspecialty coffee consumption. As signs of gentrification, coffeehouses were selected\nbased upon their location in gentrified/ing neighbourhoods and/or areas where the\nmiddle classes live. It is also noteworthy that specialty coffee markets are increasingly\ndifferentiated, along with fine lines such as between chains and branded coffeehouses\nand a host of so-called third wave, more independent hipster cafe\n\u00b4 s. In order to cap-\nture this substantive variety, we have focused on both types. As there are no global\nchain coffeehouses in Tehran, local chain and independent specialty coffee establish-\nments in all three cities have been investigated. Four coffeehouses within each city,\none locally chain-based and three independents, in total, 12 cases, have been selected.\nThe methodology involves unobtrusive observations in conjunction with inter-\nviews to examine the attitudes, characteristics and consumption practices of coffee\npeople. Both the narrative accounts of respondents and direct observations of their\nclass practices have been employed. Interviews have been conducted with both\nbaristas and visitors. First-timers, passer-by visitors and people who are not\nengaged with the specialty coffee culture and, for instance, come to espresso bars\nonly for Wi-Fi have been excluded from the study. Participants have been recruited\nfrom different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds based on age (between 17\nand 64 years old), gender, ethnicity and social activities they are engaging in\n(socialising, leisure and working/productivity; Gelmers and Rath, 2015). In total,\nthe qualitative data consist of 240 hours of observations and 60 semi-structured in-\ndepth interviews. Lasting between 60 and 180 minutes, observations were made at\ndifferent times on both weekdays and weekends as a source for observing variations\nbased on customers and social practices. Out of 60 interviews, 12 were conducted\nwith baristas and 48 with regulars. The questions were primarily open-ended, in a\nsemi-structured fashion. Participants were asked about their socio-economic back-\ngrounds, their choice of coffeehouse, coffee connoisseurship, as well as consump-\ntion and cultural practices to explore the ways in which they understand,\nrationalise and respond to their everyday urban living.\nThe shared characteristics of coffee people in Tehran,\nGlasgow and Amsterdam\nThe new urban middle classes, as an extraordinarily complex group with unclear\nboundaries, employ myriad forms of, sometimes, competing cultural capital,\nmainly through aesthetic consumption in order to practice their social position\nand/or hierarchically differentiate themselves. In this light, the consumption of\nspecialty coffee within relaxed, conspicuous environments has become a compo-\nnent of their expressive class identities bound up with the performance of cultural\ncapital and processes of distinction. For instance, Rosa, 29, a social worker in\nAmsterdam explains the self-reflexivity of patrons of coffee bars:\nI think there is a kind of culture to go to such a scene like this to kind of not showing\noff but kind of to say `Hello, here I am' . . . I guess because people want to be part of a\nShaker Ardekani and Rath 7\ncommunity or group to tell that `Hey, watch me, I'm successful; I have that\niPhone, that MacBook, or clothes'. I think it's a subculture very similar to\ncocktails . . . It is interesting, which shows you have a lot of time and money and\nknow about coffee. I also think a part of people [being here] here [is] to show\nthemselves.\nIt seems that specialty coffee bars can be considered as a space of representation or a\nspace of practice within which particular representations of identity, power and hier-\narchy become visible. These urban spaces cater to a `certain crowd' as Maryam, 24, an\narchitect in Tehran argues:\nWe are going towards specialised, professional products . . . for example, this place\nwith fresh, quality, homemade sweets, sandwiches, and salads, which is its pride,\nserves mostly for a certain type of people . . . As far as I know about this place and\nits managers, they are all professional in their jobs. They are highly selective and\nrestrictive about their baristas, staff, coffee beans, and equipment . . . It is not a\nsmall, little sinking coffee shop; they play good music and the crowd is a certain\ncrowd . . . I think it entices you to maybe stay longer or even order more . . .\nJames, 36, a barista in Amsterdam, describes the certain coffee crowd in\nAmsterdam:\nThey are mostly white and middle-class people, I would say. They would have some\nsort of more educated background, so lots of people who like wine tasting and food\ntasting also like specialty coffee . . . Here also a lot of start-up people and creative\npeople come . . . Young professionals also use the place as their office. You know,\nthey sit here with their laptops . . . I have some customers coming two times a day,\nin the morning and afternoon and spending about E10. Like, you usually see people\ncome in wearing nice clothes, expensive shoes, nice watches, very expensive laptops,\nthe latest smartphones, that's kind of a package and inventing in everything with\nquality . . . We also have a lot of expats and students here . . . Another category\nmight be like housewives and moms [who] don't work. Moms with kids and house-\nwives come here to meet friends and have a cup of coffee together . . .\nAlireza, 28, a PhD graduate also lists the similar fraction of society frequenting\nspecialty coffeehouses in Tehran:\nI cannot see all types of people here . . . Mostly young people like us, students,\nyou know . . . I also can see a certain type of people based upon their income, which\nis obvious to me from their behaviours, clothes, and styles . . . They are mostly\nhigh-income and from upper-middle families, they have enough money to spend on\nthese expensive coffees . . . There are some schools around here, so a lot of students,\na lot of families with or without children . . . It's mostly people, I think, between\n8 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0)\nNot surprisingly, Maria, 23, a general practitioner in Glasgow classifies coffee\npeople as\nCoffee people with higher education because, first of all, you do have to have\nmoney . . . Also, people are here like looking good and careful about their\nclothes . . . I think people here are self-conscious and educated in general.\nSpecialty coffee bars in studied cities seem to predominantly attract a certain\ngroup: students, university staff, high-income urban professionals, managerial\nworkers (the so-called knowledge workers), entrepreneurs, other (well paid) private\nsector workers, cool creative hipsters. They tend to be mostly young and well\neducated, having high human capital and working in sectors such as software,\nIT, finance, personal services and a wide array of cultural industries ranging\nfrom music and media to fashion-intensive crafts.\nOur empirical data also suggest that coffee people tend to insatiably search for\nnew and different aesthetic experiences. Converting their human capital into an\nabstract taste, they navigate through a broad set of culturally expressive activities,\nbodily self-surveillance and environmentally awareness. Although the ethnographic\ndata acknowledge the diversity of class practices, regulars share a set of interrelated\nqualities visible through their everyday consumption practices. Three of these key\nqualities involve the body, cosmopolitanism and environmentalism.\nThe metropolitan body\nBourdieu (1984) has argued that bodies and their associated consumption practices\nare classed. Rosa, James, Alireza and Maria have implicitly mentioned that coffee\npeople tend to pay close attention to the surfaces which are under their direct\ncontrol, that is, the body. The tendency of coffee people towards the public\nperformance of self is most noticeable in their engagement in their public bodies,\nin how they present themselves in their clothes, speech, manners, posture, appear-\nance and decoration of bodies (Featherstone, 2010). Analyses of the behaviours of\ncoffee people suggest that appearance, body shape and physical control as having\nbecome increasingly central to their sense of identity. A variety of bodily norms of\nappearance in the form of clothing and adornment or even tattooing and piercing\nare fundamental to mark social identity.\nAlmost all of the participants reveal that they place a great emphasis on their\nappearance, display and the management of impressions, a form of body-conscious\nstyle through methods of somatic improvement such as diet, sports, yoga and a\nwhole host of bodily practices and disciplines. For example, Angela, 35, a fashion\ndesigner in Amsterdam explains her attention to balancing health, appearance and\nhappiness:\nWhen I was younger, I tended to do a lot of exercise like ballet, and extracurricular\n[sports]. But I think when you are working full time, it is kind of hard to go to the gym\nShaker Ardekani and Rath 9\nas much as you want to . . . but I try to exercise, so I go to the gym and do yoga but\nhalf of it for fitness and half of it for like stress relief . . . I also go running for being fit\nand healthy . . . just like an old way of being fit and organising thoughts.\nClair, 28, a post-doc student and a young mom in Glasgow also expresses how she\nuses the available opportunities to work on her body:\nAs a mom, I am trapped home for the whole day taking care of my baby girl so it's\nnice to be somewhere else if I could . . . so I go to buggy fitting. With a group of other\nmoms, we go to Kelvingrove Park buggying.\nIf the previous waves of coffee have been about common tastes, mass production\nand massive bodies, the artisanal, third wave of coffee seems to be about construc-\ntion and representation of refined (or reflexive) tastes, craft production and crafted\nbodies. For instance, Morteza, 25, a barista in Tehran defines his body as an\ninstrument, a professional, portable toolkit for his job:\nFor improving my tasting and sensory skills, I have stopped smoking and drinking\nalcohol, become a vegetarian, and also started exercising and hiking . . . I have devoted\na lot of my time to sports which is really important to me and my job . . . I go for\nswimming, volleyball, football, table tennis, and parkour . . . I am also following a\nhealthy diet and even use some sports and diet apps on my iPhone to keep track of\nmy progress . . .\nIt shows that the body has changed from a biological fact into a project (Giddens,\n1991), a performance (Goffman, 1959), a lifestyle accessory to be sculpted, shaped\nand `stylised' (Featherstone, 1991). As a vehicle of pleasure and self-expression, the\nbody needs to be maintained and requires servicing, regular care and attention to\npreserve maximum efficiency. The body as a malleable phenomenon reflects social\nand cultural forces, a fleshy testimonial to the aestheticisation of everyday life.\nEngagement with specialty coffee in itself represents an embodied practice or a\nset of ongoing practices of corporalisation. Coffee people's embodiment is a life\nprocess that requires the learning of bodily techniques such as walking, sitting,\ndrinking, tasting and so forth. The coffee embodiment is the ensemble of these\ncorporal practices that produces and gives the body its place in everyday coffee\nspaces. Coffee people, furthermore, are feeling bodies rather than disembodied\nminds; this embodiment requires an acquired taste, a certain type of connoisseur-\nship, a sensual experience and expertise of navigating through different tastes and\nflavours of coffee. The third wave of coffee is about sourcing beans from farms\ninstead of countries, and roasting is about bringing out rather than incinerating the\nunique characteristics of each bean and its flavour. Simply put, embodiment is the\nlived experience of the sensual or subjective body (Turner, 2008). Coffee people\nthrough the conversion of their cultivated disposition into distinct types of embo-\ndied capital, that is, sensual and physical, grasp a sense of self-esteem and\nconfidence to be better able to move through interpersonal spaces of sociability to\nenjoy the full range of lifestyle opportunities and pleasures on offer (Shilling, 2003).\nMarco, 41, a university professor in Glasgow, for instance, shows his sensual\nembodiment:\nThere is so much variety and by now it is very difficult for me to navigate. But if you\nask me what is your favourite by recollection, I would tell you it is the Colombian\nblend that they have here. I am not a huge fan of AeroPress and I mostly stick to\nespresso . . .\nOur observations, additionally, suggest that the presentation of the body within\nspecialty coffee bars seems not to be just about the embodiment of cultural capital\nbut also the power to affect others (Featherstone, 2010). The use of refined goods,\nappropriate body style, crafted coffee taste, clothing, make-up, adornment and, in\ngeneral, the representation of cultivated sensual and physical capital are some\nsort of signs, the constructed bodies of what coffee people want others to see.\nThey represent what Laura Mulvey (1975) has called scopophilia (the love of\ngazing), affective metropolitan bodies. In this sense, specialty coffee bars change\ninto a stage of gaze, a cultural place to see and to be seen. In return, as the spectator\nstands as a co-creator (Wegenstein, 2012), coffee people provide an outward image\nand seek confirmation through returned glances and exchanged smiles.\nCosmopolitanism\nHaving access to rich cultural and economic resources, the interviewees have shown\nto be culturally flexible and aware. The taste-making capability of human-capital-\nheavy groups enables them to associate with a wide range of cultural engagements\nand leisure activities (Wright, 2011). They appear to be curious and hold an\nabstract taste for a variety of cultural items, a specific attitude towards the appre-\nciation of various (non)local goods. As an aesthetic disposition, they possess\ncosmopolitan/multicultural capital, which makes it a tool to assert their distinctive\nidentity, an orientation of openness towards cultural others, systems of beliefs and\ncompetencies (Meuleman and Savage, 2013). Participants elaborate that they\nsearch for new cultural experiences such as dining out and trying different cuisines,\ntravelling, learning new languages, listening to vast musical genres, watching\nvarious types of movies, reading practices and following a variety of news.\nFor example, Pepijn, 35, a financial manager in Amsterdam explains his very\nbroad tastes in cultural activities:\nI listen to almost anything. I'm interested in lots of 80s and 90s, rock, metal, jazz, hip\nhop, punk, blues, and folk music . . . I also love travelling, yesterday my girlfriend said\n`I want to go to a holiday', and then we decided to go to Kazakhstan. We[`ll] go there\nfor 3 weeks. I guess it is a cheap place to go to . . . We also love different foods, and it\ndoesn't matter what kitchen it is; we go everywhere and try different\nShaker Ardekani and Rath 11\nthings . . . Tomorrow we'll go to a Mongolian restaurant. I've been there like three\ntimes but it is really amazing. We also have an Afghani restaurant but I guess the\nMongolian kitchen is rougher . . . When I go out with friends, we try the Lebanese\nkitchen and why not even Chinese. If we have time, we would also check out Greek,\nAlbanian, Thai, Spanish, French, and Turkish food.\nMina, 35, a sales manager in Tehran also describes her taste in news:\nFor my profession, I follow the economic news of the world . . . I follow the news every\nday at 8 a.m. and also read the paper when I'm here. I have some news apps on my\nphone, so I could check to see what's happening. Also on the Internet, I check all the\nheadlines. But I follow a lot of economic news, and I go really in depth by reading\neconomic articles . . . We are also subscribed for some newspapers and receive them on\nthe daily basis, so we are constantly reading the news, and know what's going\non . . . I also follow the news you cannot ignore like the refugees, wars, political\nsituations. I'm also interested in cultural news, like about movies.\nThe presence of omnivorism (Peterson, 2005) among high-status groups requires of\nindividuals a form of `cultural tolerance' (Lizardo, 2014), the ability to cross\nbetween `high' and `low' cultural boundaries in their cultural choices. For instance,\nSachi, 31, a post-doc student in Glasgow describes his reading habits:\nI read a lot of different books such as the New York Times bestsellers. I also like to\nread the classical English literature. However, in general, although I'm curious about\ndifferent things, I'm not interested enough to go deep into them. That's why I read a\nlot of different texts such as humanities, philosophy, history, urban stuff, theology,\nreligion, sociology, cultural stuff, anthropology . . . Because my work is based on the\nphilosophy of technology, understanding technology and the relationship between\nhumans and technology, so I have to understand so many things . . . Also because of\nthe time pressure, I'm a big fan of short stories.\nCoffee can itself be straightforwardly cosmopolitan in the sense that, through its\nvery substance, it invokes a certain worldliness. The consumption of specialty\ncoffees can be also viewed as a narrow form of cosmopolitan practice in the way\nthat it demonstrates the engagement in the otherness of the world. For Nima, 28, a\nmusician in Tehran\nThird wave of coffee is mostly about sharing information and cultures of the coffee\nyou'd like to consume . . . With a shot of espresso, I can have a trip to Rwanda,\nEthiopia, Kenya, Brazil, Indonesia or any other coffee countries. You could simply\ntravel with just one cup of coffee to places you have never been.\nIn this regard, participants through reflexive engagement with the globe have\ncreated a privileged lifestyle through cosmopolitan omnivorism as an intellectual\ndisposition which can be conceptualised through aestheticising `the other' elements\nand material practices and engagement with (non)local cultural goods in everyday\nurban living.\nEnvironmentalism\nAnother widely expressed characteristic of coffee people besides their bodily\naesthetics and cosmopolitan omnivorism is their awareness about the earth, sus-\ntainability and environment. Our investigation suggests that the participants try to\ncomplement their concern with their `internal environment' of bodily experience\n(Shilling, 2008) through ecological orientations and green movements via activities\nhighlighting the importance of `looking after' the environment in parallel with\nlooking after themselves. For example, Aldert, 43, a manager in an insurance\ncompany in Amsterdam shows his interests in environmental preservation:\nWhen I was going to the university, I was really politically active and there is still an\nideology like that in me; but, of course, when you work, more energy goes to that\ndirection than the other. Because we work, we have enough money, and it's easier to\nbe politically correct, so we buy biological products and green stuff. We separate our\ngarbage and we do the stuff that is available to us but not much more . . . I also do\nsome volunteering but not directly related to the environment but still humanitarian\nstuff, which relates, to some extent, to the environment.\nThe emergence of pro-environmental behaviours among the participants derives\nfrom their responsible consumption by which eco-conscious and socio-economic-\nally privileged individuals practice and promote environmentally friendly lifestyles\nas a way to contribute to the quality of life and better neighbourhood, city and\nenvironment (Soron, 2010). As an extended impersonal form of cultivated cultural\ncapital that is embedded in the wider concept of civic responsibility (Lange and\nMeier, 2009), environmental awareness contributes to the protection of nature\nthrough redefining personal consumption patterns by taking the environment\ninto account while making purchasing decisions. Sharon, 59, a social worker in\nGlasgow, describes her environmental practices:\nFrom my personal, direct environment, I try not to make much trash, but I only use\nthe channels that are available like separating my garbage and putting them into\ngarbage bins or I don't put litter out on the street . . . Subconsciously, I think I try\nnot to pollute my direct environment. I also try to shop locally and use my bike for\ndoing stuff within my area.\nBy reflecting critically on the environment and guiding their consumption patterns\nin sustainable directions, coffee people individualise and de-politicise the issue of\nenvironmental responsibility. Rather than following the normative narrative that\nenvironmental issues must be solved through political decision-making,\nShaker Ardekani and Rath 13\ninterviewees have typically expressed that they have personal actions to do and\nindividual sacrifices to make alongside large-scale political solutions. For instance,\nSahar, 25, an art student in Tehran describes her personal responsibilities to\n`mother earth':\nI agree with the existence of global warming and think it needs very serious large-scale\npolitical actions to be taken to tackle this threatening gloomy danger. However, per-\nsonally, I believe that I have some responsibilities for mother earth. My actions are\nindeed small but still better than nothing and could make some small changes. I try to\ndrive my car less, take the subway or public transportation to go to the university or\nwhen I go out with friends. I also walk a lot for short distances, try to eat a lot of\nvegetarian foods instead of meat . . . In general, I try to be kind to mother earth . . .\nThe consumption of transparent, fair trade coffee has appeared to be another\nmoral regulator of coffee people. As a specific type of humanitarian value, our\nparticipants have argued that they are worried about the process of coffee produc-\ntion and people involved in, especially in countries or at the farms of origin.\nFor example, Charlotte, 29, a freelancer in Amsterdam says,\nThere are certain concerns about the people who grow the coffee we drink. Coffee\ngrows in specific countries and because of its high demand, more people are engaged\nwith the process from planting and harvesting to brewing and cupping . . . I've heard\nthat in some farms, children pick coffee beans in condition just like some sort of\nsweatshops . . . I don't like to drink coffee coming from that situation . . . I'm willing\nto pay some extra for my coffee in favour of those kids and for creating a more\ntransparent coffee process.\nThere is a distinction between citizen consumers and customer consumers. Coffee\npeople seem not to be mere consumers who seek primarily to maximise their per-\nsonal interests but they also take on the responsibility through association with\ncitizenship and considering the general good through their consumption.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nOur study of coffee people in Tehran, Glasgow and Amsterdam suggests that class\ncompositions are not entirely the same and occupational class, education, cultural\nknow-how and class of origin all strongly condition the attributes of consumption\nand load heavily on the participants' lifestyles. Despite the different make-up, pace,\nscale and spread of the new urban middle classes within the studied cities, with\nregard to their everyday consumption patterns, they share some common traits,\nethical dispositions and cultural practices. We have argued that coffee people show\na remarkable convergence in their attitudes and behaviours in their everyday urban\nlife. Patronising third wave coffee bars as an embodied practice revolves around a\nparticular construction and representation of the physical and sensual body\nthrough consuming a global commodity with environmental/moral connotations.\nMoreover, possessing adequate economic and cultural resources, our interviewees\nhave revealed that, alongside their embodied expressive lifestyles, they participate\nactively in the engagement with the global cultural others via their omnivorous\ntastes and cosmopolitan attitudes as part of the global cultural capital in the con-\ntext of environmental concerns and responsible consumption. Coffee people as a\ngroup within the new urban middle classes enjoy the consumption styles of life, feel\ncomfortable with foreign/other cultures and value-systems and are aware of the\nenvironmental challenges.\nDrawing upon several streams of research and scholarship and combining often\nweakly integrated analytical schools of thought including theories of consumption,\npractice, distinction, consumer sovereignty, the body, cosmopolitanism, omnivor-\nism, sustainability and environmentalism, we have shown that the aesthetic con-\nsumption practices of the new urban middle classes are driven by a conscious\nreflexivity to develop their social identities and relations. Their embodied practices\nof consumption and orientation towards a wide range of cultural items and leisure\nactivities in conjunction with environmental concerns suggest a new objective and\nsubjective notion of class. In return, the urban landscape is now predominantly\nlined with hoardings non-local consumer goods, spaced out by fair trade and green\nconsumption amenities and marked by leisure spaces, while the body is often\nshaped by the latest fashion items and somatic improvements and signalled by\nthe latest portable technologies.\nWhat we have observed in Amsterdam and Glasgow reflects a commonplace\nurban agenda in many other cities in advanced economies. Because of deindustrial-\nisation, neoliberalism and globalisation, cities are now considering facilitating the\nclustering of advanced producer services and cultural amenities in order to boost\ntheir economies through attracting professionalised workforce with high levels of\ncognitive and cultural skills. These new social classes have gravitated to inner cities\nand transformed the retail landscape of neighbourhoods through their search for\nconsumption spaces that fit their distinctive lifestyles. Additionally, the new urban\nmiddle classes have acquired more power and become agents of change, promoting\nnew styles of consumption which potentially cut across traditional social divisions\nand may contribute to solve environmental challenges and transform towards more\nsustainable societies.\nThe rise of the new urban middle classes in Tehran, on the other hand, seems to\nbe a result of increasing availability of disposable incomes in their hands and\neducational pursuits of young urbanites, which have modified their styles of\nliving and consumption patterns. There are several other studies suggesting that\nduring the past several decades consumption patterns in the Global South and the\nemerging economies such as China, India, South Africa, South Korea and Brazil\nhave considerably changed with an increased proportion of expenditures being\nspent on housing, transport, recreation, education, clothing and other aesthetic\n2015). It could be also argued that the rise of the new middle classes around the\nShaker Ardekani and Rath 15\nglobe is anchored in the convergent socio-cultural, political, economic and envir-\nonmental values.\nIn addition to the meta-concepts such as cultural globalisation, the global\nspread of the new urban middle classes seems to be associated with the establish-\nment of certain cultural infrastructures and institutions which give the middle\nclasses opportunities of cultural reception, transmission and reproduction.\nThe developments of transport infrastructures and communication technologies\nduring the late 20th century have facilitated the global circulation of ideas, meta-\nphors, sign systems and meaning-making practices. In return, the new urban\nmiddle classes who have money, time, confidence and motivation to catalyse\nsignificant transformations in their societies, especially within the Global South,\nthrough a cultural synchronisation emanating from the West and a combination of\nconsumption and investment in their human capital have resulted in lifestyles which\nare not locally bounded anymore and the emergence of the North in the South.\nOur study has highlighted that how comparing and analysing regulars of spe-\ncialty coffee bars, their motivations, characteristics and activities could shed light\non the larger societal trends and talk about structural changes in the composition\nof the world population, economy, values and ideology. It also draws attention to\nhow micro-level analyses can provide macro-level insights on the class structural\nchanges within individual societies and class dynamics brought about by global-\nisation. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the new urban middle classes are\nconceptually very complex and cannot be reduced to refer to a homogenised\ngroup with a clear boundary. Furthermore, our investigation has merely focused\non the qualities that coffee people share through their mundane, everyday con-\nsumption patterns. We have observed some other common ground among the\ncoffee people such as their liberal attitudes and political preferences fostering dem-\nocracy and socio-political stability by improving social cohesion. As these shared\nmentalities could not be fully grasped through the consumption practices, further\ninterdisciplinary investigation on the class practices of the new urban middle classes\nseems necessary.\n"
