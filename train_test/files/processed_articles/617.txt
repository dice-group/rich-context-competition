The choice of\nfunctional measure for use as a primary outcome in studies of older\nadults is challenging; appropriate selection depends on the outcome\nof interest and evidence for its psychometric properties. There are\ntwo general approaches to measuring function: patient-reported and\nperformance-based assessments. Patient-reported outcome measures\n(PROs) assess a patient's perception of a broad array of functional\nactivities while performance-based measures (PBMs) reflect an observ-\ner's evaluation of a patient's performance of specific physical tasks.\nThe relative advantages of each approach have been debated (1,2).\nPBMs have been purported to offer better objectivity and validity,\ngreater sensitivity to change and are thought to be less easily influ-\nenced by external factors. On the other hand, PROs offer low cost\nand convenience, and may represent a broader, more patient-centered\nassessment of functions applicable to an older person's daily life.\nStudies comparing the psychometric properties of PROs and\nPBMs have yielded conflicting results, likely in part because previous\ncomparisons have often been limited by measures that assess differ-\nent aspects of function. The magnitudes of association between the\ntwo approaches have ranged from low to high (3,4). Early reports\nsuggested that PROs lack sensitivity to change (5), however recent\nwork supports the comparability of both approaches in specific clini-\ncal populations (1,6).Additionally, both PROs and PBMs of function\npredict subsequent disability among older adults (6,7), though stud-\nies directly comparing the predictive validity of the two approaches\nThe Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and timed walk-\ning tests are among the most commonly used PBMs with strong evi-\ndence supporting their predictive value (7,10\u00ad13). Similarly, a wide\nvariety of PROs have been published, though many have been lim-\nited by lack of conceptual clarity and concerns over their responsive-\nness (14). The Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI),\na PRO of function and disability, was developed to address these\nlimitations (15,16). Since its conception, the LLFDI has been used in\nstudies involving more than 17,000 older adults with a wide range\nof health conditions (17). A recent systematic review (17) reported\nevidence supporting the LLFDI's construct validity and sensitivity to\nchange. However, few studies have evaluated this measure's predic-\ntive validity and ability to detect change in functional status, nor\nincluded a comparison to PBMs of the same or similar aspects of\nfunction.\nThis study aimed to determine the predictive validity and respon-\nsiveness of the Function Component of the Late-Life Function and\nDisability Instrument (LLFDI-FC) compared to commonly used\nPBMs of lower extremity function in older adults. We hypothesized\nthat the LLFDI-FC would have similar predictive validity for adverse\noutcomes to the PBMs and that both types of measures would have\ncomparable responsiveness to meaningful change in functional sta-\ntus over 2 years.\nMethods\nParticipants\nWe used baseline and 2-year follow-up data from the Boston\nRehabilitative Impairment Study of the Elderly (Boston RISE), a lon-\ngitudinal cohort study of 430 primary care patients.\nMethods for Boston RISE were approved by the relevant\nInstitutional Review Boards. Study details have been published\nelsewhere (18). Patients were recruited from primary care practices\nwho met the following criteria: age 65 years, ability to speak and\nunderstand English, difficulty or task modification with walking 1/2\nmile and/or climbing one flight of stairs, no planned major surgery,\nand expectation of living in the area for 2 years. Exclusion criteria\nincluded: significant visual impairment, uncontrolled hypertension,\nlower extremity amputation, supplemental oxygen use, myocardial\ninfarction, or major surgery in the previous 6 months, Mini Mental\nState Exam score < 18 and SPPB score < 4. A weighted recruitment\nstrategy using baseline SPPB scores was employed to ensure a broad\nrange of physical function and risk for mobility decline. Baseline\nassessments were conducted during an initial screening visit and sub-\nsequent visit within 2 weeks. Follow-up assessments were conducted\nat 12 and 24 months. Between visits, participants were contacted by\nphone every 3 months to track falls and healthcare utilization.\nMeasures\nThe LLFDI-FC is an interview-administered questionnaire that\nassesses a broad range of functional limitations (inability to per-\nform discrete physical tasks), consistent with established conceptual\nmodels (14,19). The LLFDI-FC asks subjects to report their current\ndegree of difficulty in performing 32 physical tasks on a typical day\nwithout the help of someone else and without the use of assistive\ndevices. Response options include: none, a little, some, quite a lot,\ncannot do. The scale is comprised of an overall function domain\nand three subdomains: advanced lower extremity function (eg walk-\ning several blocks, getting up from the floor), basic lower extremity\nfunction (eg standing, stooping, walking inside the home), and upper\nextremity function (for a full description of tasks see Haley and col-\nleagues (15)). To facilitate comparison with the PBMs in this study,\nwe focused on the overall function and basic and advanced lower\nextremity subscales. Each LLFDI-FC domain is calibrated on a scale\ngood function. Evidence supports the LLFDI scale's construct valid-\nity, sensitivity to change and reliability (ICC = 0.91\u00ad0.98) over a\n3-week interval in community-dwelling older adults (15\u00ad17).\nSPPB\nThe SPPB is comprises three components: standing balance, usual\npace walking speed, and a five-repetition chair stand test. Scores\nfrom each component are added to create a score between 0 and\n12, with higher scores indicating better performance. The SPPB has\nhigh predictive validity for disability, nursing home admission, and\nmortality (7,8). A range of minimal clinically important difference\nGait speed\nParticipants are instructed to walk at their usual pace over a distance\nof 4 m. Gait speed derived from a 4-m walk test predicts disability\nParticipants walk laps in a marked corridor with the goal to com-\nplete 400-m as quickly as possible (11). Testing is terminated if par-\nticipants take >15 minutes to complete the walk. Participants unable\nto complete the walk in the time allowed were assigned a score of 15\non the test. The 400-m walk is predictive of disability and mortality\nin older adults (12,23). A change of 60 seconds has been suggested\nStair-climb power test (SCPT)\nThe SCPT requires participants to ascend a flight of 10 stairs as\nquickly as possible, using a handrail if necessary. Stair climb power\nis calculated using the participant's weight, the vertical height of the\nstairs, and the speed at which they ascended the stairs. The SCPT is a\nreliable and clinically relevant measure of leg power associated with\nSelf-rated health, falls, hospitalizations, and disability\nSelf-rated health was determined using a five-point Likert scale in\nresponse to the question \"In general, how would you say your health\nis (27)\"; a response of poor or fair (versus excellent, very good, or\ngood) was used to categorize those with low self-rated health at\n2 years. Self-rated health has been shown to be a powerful predic-\ntor of mortality and health-care utilization (28,29). Falls were ascer-\ntained in response to the question \"How many times have you fallen\nto the ground in the past 3 months? Include falls where any part\nof your body above the ankle hit the floor or ground and falls that\noccurred on the stairs (30)\" and hospitalizations were defined as an\novernight hospital stay for any reason. Self-reported disability (inabil-\nity to participate in major life roles) was determined using the LLFDI\nDisability component (LLFDI-DC) which assesses the older person's\ncurrent frequency of and limitations in performing 16 life tasks.\nScores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating less disabil-\nity. The LLFDI-DC has demonstrated construct validity, reliability,\nand sensitivity to change in community-dwelling older adults (17).\nStatistical Analyses\nPredictive validity\nSeparate logistic regression models were constructed to assess each\nfunctional measure as predictors of unfavorable outcomes: (a) low\nself-rated health at 2 years; (b) one or more falls over 2 years; and\n(c) one or more hospitalizations over 2 years. The increased odds\nof having an unfavorable outcome for a one SD change in each of\nthe function measures were calculated. Linear regression models\nwere used to determine the measures' predictive validity for dis-\nability, measured using the limitation and frequency domains of the\nLLFDI-DC. The amount of total variance (R2) in disability explained\nby the predictors was used to compare the predictive validity across\nmeasures. The assumptions of regression were tested and confirmed\nfor each model.\nResponsiveness\nResponsiveness was defined as the degree to which a measure\ndetects meaningful change. Meaningful change can be determined\nusing either distribution-based methods (ie statistical distributions\nof change and associated reliability) or anchor-based methods [ie\nexternal criterion of change reflecting a patient or clinician's perspec-\ntive (31)]. The following metrics were calculated for each measure:\n1. To provide a metric of responsiveness independent of direction,\nwe computed absolute effect sizes (ES) for each functional meas-\nure: ES = abs((M\n- M\n))/S\nb\n, where M\nis the mean score at the\nyear 2 follow-up, M\nis the mean score at baseline, and S\nb\nis the\nrepresent small, moderate and large ES, respectively (32).\n2. The ES for each measure was also computed using change in self-\nrated health (either decline or improvement) as an external crite-\nrion to identify subgroups of patients likely to have experienced\na change in function as a result of their health.\n3. Standard error of measurement (SEM) was calculated as\nb\n*(1 - r), where S\nb\nis the SD at baseline and r is the test\u00ad\nretest reliability coefficient. Data for the reliability coefficients\n4. Minimal detectable change scores with 90% confidence were\ncalculated as (MDC\ncorresponds to the smallest amount of change that falls outside\nof measurement error. The percentage of patients who demon-\nstrated a decline/improvement  the MDC\nover 2 years were\ncalculated for each measure.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the sample at baseline\n(n = 430). See Supplementary Table S1 for the breakdown of base-\nline characteristics by tertile of LLFDI-FC score. Participants had a\nparticipants reported low self-rated health, 181 participants (42.3%)\nreported one or more falls in the preceding year and 114 (26.5%)\npants remained in the study.\nSample sizes for the individual analyses varied based on the meth-\nods and outcomes used. Quarterly phone call data were available\n2 years, self-rated health data were available for 276 participants with\n56 (20.3%) reporting low self-rated health. Mean disability scores at\nfrequency scale and 68.9 (SD 11.8) for the limitation scale.\nChange in function data from baseline to 2 years were available\non 359 participants for self-reported function and varied for each\nof the performance-based tests (see Table 4). Individuals for whom\ncomplete functional data were available at both time points (n = 231)\nhad significantly better scores on each of the functional measures at\nbaseline than those without missing data (data not shown).\nPredictive Validity\nTable 2 presents the logistic regression models that show the odds\nof an unfavorable outcome for every 1 SD increase in functional\nmeasure. The LLFDI-FC and each of the PBMs showed high pre-\ndictive validity for low self-rated health at 2 years, with the 400-m\nwalk and LLFDI-FC advanced lower extremity subscale performing\nbest. Similarly high predictive validity for hospitalizations was also\nobserved across measures. The LLFDI-FC overall function domain\nwas the only measure that predicted one more falls over 2 years,\nTable 1.

The proportion of participants who declined  the MDC\nwas largest for the LLFDI-FC scales (31\u00ad35%), followed by gait\nspeed (23%). Improvement  the MDC\nwas highest for the SPPB\n(31%), followed by the LLFDI-FC basic lower extremity (24%).\nOverall, the greatest proportion of participants with a meaningful\nchange in function in either direction was found for the LLFDI-FC\nBecause there was a higher amount of missing data for some of\nthe performance-based outcomes, we performed a sensitivity analy-\nsis limiting the sample to only those with complete data for each\nof the functional measures (n = 231). No material differences were\nobserved.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we compared the predictive validity and responsive-\nness to 2 years of aging of a PRO, the LLFDI-FC, to frequently used\nlower extremity PBMs. Our findings demonstrated that in a cohort\nof older primary care patients, the LLFDI-FC performed as well or\nbetter than most of the PBMs for predicting adverse outcomes and\nfor detecting meaningful changes in function over 2 years. These\nresults support the utility of the LLFDI-FC as a primary outcome in\ngerontological research, particularly for longitudinal studies when\nthe construct of interest is self-reported functional limitations.\nOne of the advantages of the LLFDI-FC as well as many other\nPROs is that they provide the user with an assessment of an older\nperson's limitation across a broad universe of functional activities. In\ncontrast, most commonly used PBMs such as the SPPB and 400-m\nwalk, assess the performance of quite specific functional tasks and\nmay not tap into the actual performance of an older person's daily\nactivities. Such PBMs do exist, such as the Continuous Scale Physical\nFunctional Performance Test (35) but can take upwards of 30\u00ad45\nminutes to implement and require the use of expensive equipment.\nWhile extensive evidence supports the construct validity of the\nLLFDI (17), to our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated\nits predictive validity. The logistic regression models showed that the\nLLFDI-FC demonstrated high predictive validity for poor self-rated\nhealth, self-reported hospitalizations and disability over 2 years of fol-\nlow-up, comparable to the PBMs. Furthermore, the LLFDI-FC overall\nfunction domain was the only measure that predicted falls. This was\nunexpected since PBMs, particularly balance (included in the SPPB)\nand gait speed, are often used to screen for fall risk (36). Although it\nis possible that there was a ceiling effect with the PBMs [eg 9.8% of\nTable 3.Linear Regression Models* Predicting Disability Limita-\nMeasure Disability\nLimitation\nDisability\nFrequency\nNotes: LLFDI = Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument; L/E= lower\nextremity; SPPB = Short Physical Performance Battery.\nUnstandardized beta.\nTable 2.

Of interest, along with the LLFDI-FC\nsubscales, the SCPT showed a trend toward predicting falls.This is not\nsurprising as the SCPT measures lower extremity muscle power, which\nhas been shown to be relevant for falls risk (38).\nAbility to detect meaningful change is critical for an outcome\nmeasure to be used in clinical trials and observational studies alike.\nGiven the inherent strengths and weaknesses of distribution and\nanchor-based methods for determining the MCID, triangulation\nof multiple methods is recommended (34). Comparing the overall\npercentages of patients who exceeded the MDC\nshowed that the\nLLFDI-FC, SPPB, and gait speed were more responsive to 2 years\nof aging than the 400 m walk or SCPT (Table 4). In particular, the\nLLFDI-FC appeared to be more responsive to meaningful decline\nTable 4. Responsiveness Over 2 y\nMeasure Absolute ES ES Decline in SRH\nES Increase in\nPercent Changing\nNotes: LLFDI = Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument; L/E= lower extremity; SPPB = Short Physical Performance Battery; ES= effect size; SRH = self-\nrated health; SEM = standard error of measurement; MDC\n= minimal detectable change with 90% confidence.\nFigure 1. Comparison of percentages of participants demonstrating a decline (A) or improvement (B)  the MDC\nover 2 years for each measure. For example,\nas shown in A, 35% of participants declined  the MDC\nof 4.38 points for the Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI) basic lower extremity scale,\ncompared to 23% of participants that declined  the MDC\nin function than the PBMs (Figure 1A). The converse was true for\nmeaningful improvement, with the SPPB being the most responsive\nto improvements above its MDC\n(Figure 1B). When we used self-\nrated health as an external criterion for change, the LLFDI-FC was\nmore responsive to both decline and improvement in health status\nthan the PBMs. Future research will need to examine the reasons for\nthese findings, however our results extend previous work (39,40)\nsuggesting that PROs and PBMs convey distinct information and\nthat both should both be included as part of a comprehensive assess-\nment of function.\nAn important strength of our study is that we considered respon-\nsiveness to both decline and improvement in function. We observed\nsubstantial heterogeneity in the patterns of functional change in\nthe Boston RISE cohort, with some patients declining and others\nimproving over 2 years. Indeed, recent work (41) highlighted the\ninherent variability in functional aging, with the majority of patients\nshowing movement between different trajectories of change over\nrelatively short intervals. Therefore, the need for outcome measures\nthat can reliably detect both functional decline and improvement\nis paramount for timely intervention and disability prevention. Of\nnote, we investigated responsiveness to 2 years of aging; an impor-\ntant next step is to investigate the comparability of PROs and PBMs\nfor detecting change in response to interventions.\nAlthough not a primary objective of this analysis, it is interesting\nto note that the MDC\n1.25 minutes, respectively) exceeded prior estimates of their MCID\nusing patient-reported ratings of change (8,20,24). Interpretation\nof meaningful change is particularly challenging when distribution-\nbased metrics do not align with anchor-based estimates. While the\ncontrasting results may relate to differences in the populations stud-\nied, we cannot rule out that the measures lack the precision to detect\nsmall changes considered important by patients. Future work is nec-\nessary to determine if the increments of change determined impor-\ntant by anchor-based methods are similarly smaller than the MDC\nfor the LLFDI-FC.\nThis study has several limitations. Falls and hospitalizations\nwere self-reported and may be subject to recall bias. Missing data\nat 2 years may not have been missing at random; participants who\ncompleted all functional measures at the 2-year follow-up had bet-\nter function scores at baseline than those with missing data. In\nparticular, there was a higher amount of missing data for some\nof the performance-based outcomes, however sensitivity analyses\n(data not shown) confirmed this did not affect the results. Our\nfindings may not be generalizable to older adults in other clini-\ncal settings or geographical areas. While we have attempted to\ncompare measures that assess similar constructs (ie lower extrem-\nity function), each measure includes unique tasks with varying\ndegrees of complexity and difficulty. Finally, we did not have a\nglobal measure of change in function rated by the patient or clini-\ncian to use as a clinical anchor. This will be necessary to refine the\nestimation of the clinically important difference for the LLFDI-FC\nin subsequent work.\nIn summary, a self-report measure of function, the LLFDI-FC,\nshowed comparable psychometric properties to PBMs. Ultimately,\nthe choice of measure depends on the research question, the com-\nplexity and nature of the functional tasks under investigation and the\nfeasibility of implementation. Nonetheless, the LLFDI-FC appears to\nbe a valid and responsive measure for use in studies of community-\ndwelling older adults, particularly for longitudinal investigations\ndesigned to measure functional decline.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary material can be found at http://biomedgerontology.\noxfordjournals.org/\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Institute on Aging (R01\nM.B.); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health\nthe National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research\nReferences\n1.
