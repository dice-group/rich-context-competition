Signorello, Heather M. Munro, Maciej S. Buchowski, David G. Schlundt, Sarah S. Cohen,\nMargaret K. Hargreaves, and William J. Blot\nAssignment of nutrient values to food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) items does not usually account for partic-\nipant characteristics (besides age or sex) that may influence eating patterns. For the Southern Community Cohort\nStudy, the authors developed and assessed results from a nutrient database system incorporating sex-, race-, and\ncensus-region-specific food lists, using 24-hour recall data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey of Food Intakes by Individuals that permitted estimation of nutrients tailored to participants' characteristics.\nFor each of 15 nutrients, comparisons were made to a ``standard'' nutrient scoring system based on nationwide\nrace-blind 24-hour recalls from these same sources. Using FFQ data from 67,926 Southern Community Cohort\nstudy during 2002\u00ad2008, the region- and race-informed system tended to produce increased estimated intake\nfor most nutrients for black women, particularly for saturated fat (7.1%), monounsaturated fat (8.3%), and\npolyunsaturated fat (7.2%); smaller but significant changes (<5%) were also observed for nutrient intake for\nmen and white women. These types of refinements in nutrient databases can be considered a means of enhancing\nthe accuracy of dietary estimation using FFQs.\nAfrican Americans; diet; epidemiologic methods; food; geography; nutrition surveys; questionnaires\nAbbreviations: CSFII, Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals; FFQ, food frequency questionnaire; NHANES, National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey; SCCS, Southern Community Cohort Study.\nFood frequency questionnaires (FFQs) are a cost-effective,\nwidely used means of dietary assessment in epidemiologic\nstudies and are a virtual necessity within the largest studies\n(e.g., prospective cohort studies) when the goal is to elicit\na comprehensive estimate of subjects' average diets. At\na minimum, FFQs determine how often a subject consumes\nfoods that fall within a defined category, such as ``pizza'';\nbut unlike a detailed 24-hour dietary recall or diet record,\nthe investigator will often not know the type of pizza, how\nit was prepared, or the serving size. To approximate those\ndetails and ``score'' the FFQ (i.e., calculate nutrient intakes\nfor each participant), investigators may rely on a source of\n24-hour dietary recalls from which to estimate an average\n(1). Using external sources for these recalls (such as the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) and the US Department of Agriculture's\nContinuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII))\nis an approach taken with widely used FFQs in the United\nStates (including the Block FFQ (2) and the National Can-\ncer Institute's Diet History Questionnaire (3), versions of\nwhich have been used in numerous studies). Implicit in this\napproach is the assumption that the dietary habits of the\npopulation providing the 24-hour recalls are a reasonable\nrepresentation of those of the study population; the less\ntrue this assumption, the less reliable one would expect\nthe scoring to be. Studies such as NHANES and CSFII\naim to be nationally representative, but few US cohort\nstudies or other types of epidemiologic studies of diet\nCorrespondence to Dr. Lisa B.

In designing the questionnaire (described\nelsewhere (5)), we aimed to include all pertinent food items\nto allow comprehensive dietary assessment for both African\nAmericans and non-African Americans in the cohort. In\nconsidering the assignment of nutrients to these food items,\nwe sought to develop a nutrient database that would incor-\nporate the elements of race and geographic region and to test\nthe effect of these refinements on our final nutrient estima-\ntion. We report herein on the development of this database\nand the resulting nutrient indices for the cohort.\nThe institutional review boards of the participating insti-\ntutions approved SCCS activities and the manner in which\nwritten informed consent was obtained from participants.\nStudy population\nThe SCCS is a prospective cohort investigation of racial\ndisparities in cancer occurrence in a 12-state area across the\nsoutheastern United States (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida,\nGeorgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina,\nSouth Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia) (4).\nEnrollment takes place via in-person recruitment at commu-\nnity health centers and via mass mailings (84% and 16% of\nparticipants to date, respectively). At the time of enrollment,\nparticipants complete a baseline survey that includes the\nSCCS FFQ. Most SCCS participants report their race as\nbeing either non-Hispanic black/African-American (66%)\nor non-Hispanic white/Caucasian (28%).\nThe present analysis was based on FFQ data obtained\nfrom the baseline surveys of 67,926 SCCS cohort members\n40\u00ad79 years, spoke English, and had not been under treat-\nment for cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) within\nthe past year.\nThe SCCS FFQ was empirically constructed using the\nThird NHANES (NHANES III) 24-hour recall database to\ninclude an optimal number and selection of foods that would\ncapture the main sources of energy and key nutrient intake\nfor African Americans and non-African Americans in the\nSouth, as has been previously described (5). This FFQ was\nboth pilot-tested in a group of over 200 African-American\nand white residents of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Florida\naged 40\u00ad79 years and evaluated in 2 subsequent focus\ngroups to arrive at the final version (5). It comprises 89\n``items'' under the major headings ``fruits and fruit juices,''\n``breakfast foods,'' ``vegetables,'' ``rice, beans, and pota-\ntoes,'' ``pasta, pizza, and soup,'' ``meat,'' ``breads,''\n``spreads and dressings,'' ``dairy foods,'' ``desserts and\nsnacks,'' ``beverages,'' and ``seasonings and flavorings.''\nAn additional section elicits information on both the fre-\nquency and quantity of consumption of alcoholic beverages.\nThe FFQ also contains 11 questions about the use of\nvitamin/herbal supplements (although the present analysis\nwas restricted to nutrient estimation from nonsupplement\nsources) and a variety of questions about behaviors (e.g.,\nremoving skin from chicken, using fats to cook vegetables)\nthat affect nutrient values.\nThe FFQ items sometimes represent a single food (e.g.,\n``bananas''), but most are comprised of sets of commonly\nassociated foods (e.g., ``oatmeal, cream of wheat, or other\nhot cereals''). For each FFQ item, participants could select\nfrom the following 9 frequency categories: ``never,''\n``rarely,'' ``1 time per month,'' ``2\u00ad3 times per month,''\n``1 time per week,'' ``2\u00ad3 times per week,'' ``4\u00ad6 times per\nweek,'' ``1 time per day,'' and ``2 or more times per day.''\nThe FFQ does not elicit information about portion size (6).\nSource files of 24-hour dietary recalls and construction\nof the nutrient databases\nWe compiled the data files from the 24-hour dietary re-\nrecalls). The combination of these files was necessary in\norder to obtain a sufficient number of subjects (particularly\nAfrican Americans) for robust calculations. Demographic\nfiles contained an indicator for the age, race, sex, and US\nCensus region (Northeast, Midwest, South, or West) of the\nrespondent. The southern census region is defined as\nAlabama, Arkansas, the District of Columbia, Delaware,\nFlorida,Georgia,Kentucky,Louisiana,Maryland,Mississippi,\nNorth Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee,\nTexas, Virginia, and West Virginia. We restricted these data\nsets to subjects in the age range 30\u00ad84 years who reported\ntheir race as non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black and\nwhose records were not coded as being unreliable or\nincomplete.\nFrom the combined records meeting these criteria, we\nreports of 6,016 unique food codes. We assigned the major-\nthe remainder referring to foods that were not captured on\n(``bran chex'') was assigned to our FFQ item ``bran or high-\nto our FFQ item ``fried chicken or chicken nuggets,'' etc.\nThese assignments determined the individual foods that\nwould contribute to the nutrient averaging for each SCCS\nFFQ item.\nThe individual food records obtained from the NHANES\nand CSFII included the nutrient composition of the reported\nfood (sourced primarily from the US Department of Agri-\nculture, although a subset of nutrient values from the orig-\ninal NHANES III files was derived from the University of\nUsing Race and Region for Dietary Estimation 105\nMinnesota Nutrition Coordinating Center). The nutrient\ncomposition on a given record corresponded to the amount\nof food (in grams) reported by the NHANES and CSFII\nrespondents. For each SCCS FFQ food item, we estimated\nthe average amount of food consumed (grams), the average\ntotal energy intake, and the average intake of a set of macro-\nand micronutrients by computing the mean of the values for\nthe individual foods assigned to that item. These were\nweighted means in that individual foods contributed to the\naverage in proportion to the frequency (and gram weight)\nwith which they were reported. Using NHANES/CSFII rec-\nords from the southern region only, the median number of\nfood reports available for averaging within an FFQ item was\nmales, and 200 for black females.\nThe resulting nutrient databases (arrays of the SCCS FFQ\nitems 3 nutrient values) were constructed using the com-\nplete set of 24-hour recalls, as well as separately for strata\ndefined by sex, race, and census region. For example, for the\nFFQ item ``bran or high-fiber cereals,'' we calculated an\noverall average portion size and nutrient content based on\nthe list of cereals reported in the set of 24-hour recalls of all\nwomen nationwide, of black women in the South, etc. In this\nway, we constructed stratum-specific nutrient databases, al-\nlowing the system to select the appropriate nutrient value for\nan FFQ item based on the race, sex, and geographic region\nof the participant.\nWhile the use of older source files such as NHANES III\nand CSFII provided a larger base of records with which to\nenumerate foods that people eat, we thought their nutrient\nvalues might be outdated in relation to the SCCS enrollment\nperiod (2002\u00adpresent), particularly for foods subject to for-\ntification, processing, preservation, selective breeding, or\nrecipe changes. Therefore, we replaced the nutrient values\nfor earlier files with those taken from the NHANES 2003\u00ad\n2004 file (if the food code was present in that file), or else\nwe updated the nutrient values for 94% of the food codes\npresent in NHANES III or CSFII (while keeping the original\nportion size information). We used the same approach to\nsupply nutrient values to food codes that existed in earlier\nfiles prior to a particular nutrient's being made available by\nthe US Department of Agriculture.\nStatistical analysis\nThe FFQs for 72,891 SCCS participants were evaluated\nand were scored if no more than 10 of the 89 items were\nsubjects (the approximate top and bottom 2.5%) whose total\nday, which left us with a final study population of 67,926\nThe SCCS FFQ scoring system currently estimates intake\nfor 62 nutrient indices, including total energy intake. How-\never, for clarity of this demonstration, we present results for\n15 of these: total energy intake, the major macronutrients\n(carbohydrate, protein, total fat, saturated fat, monounsatu-\nrated fat, and polyunsaturated fat), and a selection of other\nnutrients key to our planned future studies of diet and\nchronic disease (cholesterol, calcium, dietary fiber, folate,\nvitamin A, vitamin C, a-tocopherol, and lycopene). We\nscored the FFQs first using sex-specific nutrient values ob-\ntained from the nationwide race-blind 24-hour recalls (here-\nafter referred to as the ``standard'' scoring system) and then\nfrom sex-specific values obtained from race-concordant 24-\nhour recalls in the South (hereafter referred to as the ``re-\ngion/race'' system) and assessed the difference in the mean\nestimations from the former to the latter, using a paired t test\nto determine statistical significance. Although the absolute\ndifferences between the scoring of the 2 systems were of\nprimary interest to us, we also calculated energy-adjusted\ndifferences by performing a linear regression analysis for\neach nutrient with the change in nutrient intake as the de-\npendent variable and the change in total calories as an ad-\njustment factor.\nBecause we plan to evaluate racial differences in dietary\nintake and their potential relation to health disparities in the\nSCCS, we also calculated black-white differences in nutri-\nent intake that would have resulted from the standard system\nand those that resulted from the region/race system. We\nevaluated variation between the scoring systems by compar-\ning the 95% confidence intervals around the black-white\ndifference.\nFFQs are best used for ranking subjects' intakes, rather\nthan estimating absolute intakes. Therefore, for each nutri-\nent under investigation, we determined each participant's\nquintile of intake based on the distribution of the entire\nstudy population, first using the standard system and then\nthe region/race system. Agreement of quintile assignment\nbetween the 2 systems was evaluated using the kappa (j)\nstatistic, with values being interpreted as follows: j \u00bc\nfect agreement (8, 9). In this paper, we report nonweighted\nj's (as opposed to weighted j's, which were uniformly\nhigher) because we do not intend misclassification into ad-\njacent quintiles to be credited with partial agreement.\nThe Statistical Analysis System, version 9.1, was used for\nall analyses (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina), and\nall P values are 2-sided.\nRESULTS\nUsing the standard scoring system, the estimated mean\ndaily total energy intake was 2,228 kcal for black women,\n2,776 kcal for white men (generally higher than noted for\nother prospective cohort studies) (10\u00ad12). Use of the region/\nrace system resulted in an increase in estimated energy in-\ntake for African Americans and a decrease for whites, al-\nthough, except for black women (with a 6% increase), the\ntotal energy estimates between systems differed by less than\n2% (Table 1). For black women, the region/race system\nyielded higher average estimated intakes across all 15 nu-\ntrients, with the largest relative changes being observed for\npolyunsaturated fat, and 8.3% for monounsaturated fat). The\nvalues in Table 1 show differences in the group mean for\nblack women, and these were the result of broad individual\nincreases rather than the effect of a small proportion of black\nwomen experiencing large increases: For all nutrients ex-\ncept folate, vitamin A, a-tocopherol, and lycopene, nutrient\nvalues increased for more than 85% of black women, and\nthere was an increase in total energy intake and fats for more\nthan 98%. Energy adjustment lessened the differences be-\ntween the 2 scoring systems, but the region/race system still\nproduced significantly higher carbohydrate, vitamin A, and\nvitamin C estimates among black women (data not shown).\nThe differences noted above were observed despite general\nstability in the estimated amount of food consumed per day\nin grams for black women (1.2%).\nFor black men, differences in mean nutrient values be-\ntween the region/race and standard systems were small (less\nthan 5%), with the exception of vitamin C (11.9 mg, or\n8.2%). For white men and women, the region/race system\nresulted in slightly lower estimates for most nutrients as\ncompared with the standard system (Table 1). For white\nwomen, there were decreases for all nutrients except cal-\ncium (18.4 mg, or 2.4%), and for white men, there were\ndecreases for all nutrients except calcium (16.4 mg, or\nUsing the standard scoring system, black women were\nday than white women, despite consuming 11% less food by\ngram weight (Table 2). When the FFQ was scored using the\nregion/race system, black women were still seen to consume\n11% less food by gram weight, but the black-white differ-\nence in energy intake expanded to 436.5 kcal. Corres-\npondingly, the female black-white difference for the\ntein, and from 11.9% to 22.9% for total fat). Similar relative\nchanges were seen for the individual types of fats, dietary\nfiber, and a-tocopherol, and the difference for lycopene\nchanged directions when the region/race system was em-\nployed. For 13 of the 15 nutrient indices presented for\nwomen, the 95% confidence intervals for the black-white\ndifference showed no overlap, indicating distinctly different\nestimates resulting from the 2 systems. In contrast to these\nfindings for women, black-white differences for men re-\nmained relatively stable using the standard system versus\nthe region/race system (Table 2), and most of the confidence\nTable 1.

All of the j's showed sub-\nstantial or better quintile agreement between the 2 systems\n(j > 0.73). Within each race group, agreement tended to be\nslightly lower for most nutrients among women compared\nwith men.\nDISCUSSION\nWe found that using a nutrient database informed by\ngeographic region and race to score the SCCS FFQ re-\nsulted in modest but meaningful differences in the esti-\nmated intake of several nutrients. The changes were most\npronounced for black women, with the standard scoring\nsystem tending to underestimate nutrient intake. The dif-\nferences between the 2 systems tended to be small for\nblack men and for whites. We had expected that changes\ninduced by the region/race system would be stronger for\nAfrican Americans than for whites, because the standard\nsystem was based on an underlying population (NHANES\nand CSFII) that was mostly (73%) white. The high level of\nagreement we observed for nutrient quintile assignments\nbetween the systems indicates that ignoring race and re-\ngion would not preclude a valid categorical analysis within\nour study, although other uses of the data that rely on\nabsolute values would be affected.\nIn supplemental analyses (results not presented), we re-\nscored the FFQs after omitting region from consideration to\nestimate what proportion of the effects noted in Table 1\ncould be achieved using race alone. Using the region/race\nsystem as the ``gold standard,'' the region-blind scoring ap-\npeared to be highly effective for black women with regard to\ntotal energy intake and the macronutrients (where more than\n90% of the change for each index would have been cap-\ntured), but it would have over- or underestimated the true\nvalues for most micronutrients for black women and for\nmost of the nutrient indices overall for men and white\nwomen. Thus, we conclude that region is a necessary com-\nponent of our scoring system.\nOur finding that caloric and nutrient intakes for black\nwomen increased using the region/race system without an\nappreciable increase in the amount of food consumed indi-\ncates that the types of foods reported by black women in the\nsouthern 24-hour recalls were preferentially calorie- and\nfat-dense. This is observable in the food lists contributing to\nthe nutrient averaging. For example, for the SCCS FFQ item\n``broccoli, cabbage, brussels sprouts, or cauliflower,'' the food\nreported most frequently in the 24-hour recalls for black\nwomen in the southern region was ``cabbage, green, cooked,\nfat added in cooking,'' as compared with ``broccoli, raw'' for\nwomen of all races nationwide (the basis of the standard\nsystem). Thus, the total fat grams attributed to this vegetable\nitem are higher (3.1 g vs. 1.7 g) for black women using the\nTable 2.

It is possible\nthat the region/race system overestimated nutrient intake for\nblack women (rather than the standard system's underestimat-\ning it). However, the region/race system relies on the principle\nthat black female participants in the SCCS, for example, have\neating habits closer to those of other black women in the\nSouth than to those of groups heavily comprised of white\nwomen from the Northeast, Midwest, and West. This is, we\nbelieve, a reasonable judgment. The assignment of values\nfrom any FFQ nutrient database is based on a set of such\njudgments, although they are not always explicitly or publicly\nexamined. Aiming for concordance on race, sex, and geo-\ngraphic area would also be expected to produce better con-\ncordance (between the NHANES and CSFII participants and\nour SCCS population) on factors such as body size, socioeco-\nnomic status, cultural and culinary practices, and activity pat-\nterns that influence the types and amounts of food eaten.\nDespite its wide use in epidemiologic studies, the FFQ is\nsubject to criticism (13, 14). Kristal and Potter (15) recently\npointed out the challenging nature of estimating dietary intake\nfrom an instrument that by its nature does not elicit informa-\ntion on foods actually consumed. With regard to the example\n``beef, pork, or lamb as a sandwich or mixed dish, e.g., stew,\ncasserole, lasagna, etc.,'' they asked, ``How could one sensi-\nbly assign a single nutrient composition to this item given the\nenormous number of nutritionally dissimilar foods commonly\nconsumed. . . which could be included?'' (15, p. 1759). This is\na valid concern, and our goal was to effect an incremental\nimprovement, however small, that would result in nutrient\nestimation more closely reflecting foods actually consumed.\nA number of previous studies have reported poorer perfor-\nmance on FFQs for blacks than for whites (based on correla-\ntions between FFQ estimation and gold-standard food records\nor 24-hour recalls) (16\u00ad19), with discussions of the need for\nincreasing attention to participant instructions or improving\ninstrument content/presentation. However, based on the re-\nsults of our analysis, a contributing factor may also be un-\nderlying FFQ nutrient databases that inaccurately represent\nthe distribution of foods eaten by African Americans.\nAlthough we are aware of several examples of investiga-\ntors' developing or adapting FFQ content to be functional\nacross racial/ethnic groups with different eating patterns\nassign different nutrient values to individuals depending\non their race or other variables. Dreon et al. (23) previously\nexplored this question using an approach similar to ours\n(race-specific weighting of foods) and concluded that there\nwas little advantage to race-specific nutrient estimation for\ntotal fat, saturated fat, and vitamin A. Aside from differ-\nences in methods (i.e., they used a single, older source file,\nincluded fewer African Americans, combined sexes and re-\ngions, and investigated only 3 nutrients), an important rea-\nson why our results may differ pertains to the FFQ itself,\nbecause various ways of constructing combined food items\ncan either increase (if nutrient densities are heterogeneous)\nor decrease (if nutrient densities are homogeneous) the pos-\nsibility of racial differences' being relevant. Tucker et al.\n(24) have previously taken an intermediate approach, select-\ning weighting patterns that fell between those determined\nfrom the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nTable 3. Kappa Statistics for Agreement Between Assigned Quintiles of Intake Based on the\nStandard System Versus the Region/Race System, Southern Community Cohort Study, United\nNutrient Index\nWomen Men\nAfrican\nAmericans\nWhites\nAfrican\nAmericans\nWhites\nVitamin A (retinol\nactivity equivalents)\nUsing Race and Region for Dietary Estimation 109\nand the original weighting for their FFQ (from NHANES\nII), with the resulting nutrient database then being applied in\na standard fashion to both Hispanics and non-Hispanics.\nTucker et al. found that this substantially improved the\nvalidity of their FFQ for Hispanics without sacrificing\nvalidity for non-Hispanic whites (24). Investigators in the\nMultiethnic Cohort Study used a similar method to apply\nethnicity-specific weights for just a few of their FFQ com-\nposite items (16). The approach we have implemented in the\nSCCS (to be used for all participants) goes a step further and\nallows fully race-dependent weighting for all FFQ items.\nThe SCCS FFQ scoring system relies on a very large set\nof 24-hour recalls. We overcame the issue of the source file\ntime frame (for NHANES III and CSFII) not being coinci-\ndent with the SCCS enrollment period through backwards\nreplacement of current nutrient values into older reports on\nthe same foods. In this way, we were able to make use of the\nreports without using outdated nutrient values. Our esti-\nmates would have been affected, however, by changes in\neating patterns over time. To maximize the available sample\nsize and to attain comparable mean ages between the study\npopulations (as the SCCS age distribution is skewed towards\nyounger ages), we allowed a somewhat broader age range\n(30\u00ad84 years) for the NHANES/CSFII participants than for\nthe SCCS enrollees (40\u00ad79 years). We believe this is a minor\nissue, and previous research has indicated that an age-based\nscoring system does not improve FFQ nutrient estimation\n(as long as portion size and sex are accounted for) (3). The\n12 SCCS-area states are contained within the 17 states com-\nprising the southern census region. To the extent that eating\nhabits differ in the 5 nonoverlapping states (particularly\nTexas), we have not optimally refined our geographic re-\nstriction. Because we did not have information about indi-\nvidual states, we cannot know how many NHANES and\nCSFII participants came from these non-SCCS states or\nwhether their inclusion effected much change in our nutrient\nestimation, but we also believe this is a minor issue.\nIn summary, investigators using FFQs, whether in diverse\npopulations or in homogeneous populations, may benefit\nfrom incorporating specific characteristics of the study pop-\nulation into nutrient algorithms to refine estimation for in-\ndividual groups. For the SCCS, these characteristics were\nrace and geographic region, but other pertinent factors (e.g.,\nage, socioeconomic status, body size, health status) may\napply. The data necessary to construct stratum-specific nu-\ntrient databases are available (though not always publicly, as\nwas the case for census region for the NHANES files post-\n1999). For investigators who use internal sources of 24-hour\nrecalls to construct databases (i.e., from their own study\nparticipants), efforts could be made to collect recalls from\na sufficient number of persons within each group of interest\nto achieve the same end. These refinements should be con-\nsidered an additional way to enhance the accuracy of dietary\nestimation using an FFQ.\n"
