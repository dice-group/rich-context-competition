    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe informational text recommendations found in the Common Core State Standards for English and Language Arts (CCSS-\nELA) will have a significant impact on teacher practice and student learning in the classroom. Teachers will be required to\nintegrate substantial amounts of informational text instruction into reading curriculum. This article describes the findings of a\nquantitative content analysis study of the text genres contained in the three commercially published fourth-grade basal reading\ntexts. Hand coding was used to analyze the types and extent of text contained in each publisher's text and then compare\nwith the recommendation of the CCSS-ELA. Findings indicated that the percentage of informational text found in the three\nselected fourth-grade basal readers does not meet the informational text standard set by the CCSS-ELA. These results are\nsignificant due to the recent adoption by most states of the CCSS, which are based on the 2009 National Assessment of\nEducational Progress (NAEP). As most elementary classrooms rely on basal texts for reading and language arts instruction,\nit is important for principals, curriculum leaders, and teachers to be aware of the volume and type of informational texts\nthat appear in basal texts at each grade level. School districts and teachers may need to purchase supplementary materials to\naddress the standard set for informational text set by the CCSS-ELA.\n",

And, although\nbasal reading texts in the early grades primarily use literary\ntext to teach the basic strategies and procedures needed for\nmost academic achievement depends, in part, on the ability\nto read and write informational text (Duke, 2004; Hall &\nSabey, 2007). Furthermore, as beginning readers are taught\nto read with primarily literary text (Kletzien & Dreher, 2004),\nthey may be unprepared for the challenges of informational\ntext and content-specific vocabulary (Sanacore & Palumbo,\n2009). This is especially evident in the fourth grade, where\nthere is a marked increase in student interaction with content\narea materials (McNamara, Ozuru, & Floyd, 2011; Meyer &\nRay, 2011). Researchers have dubbed this the \"fourth grade\nslump,\" and attribute it to difficulties with informational text\nOne major challenge facing researchers and practitioners\nis the lack of a unified definition of informational text\n(Williams, 2009). Those using the term may define it in a\nMoss & Newton, 2002). Using this term as a synonym for\nnonfiction is confusing given that many informational texts\nare nonfiction, but not all nonfiction texts are necessarily\nconsidered to be informational texts. According to Duke\n(2004), text that conveys information about the natural and\nsocial world could be considered informational text, while\nMarinak and Gambrell (2008) suggested that informational\ntext be typified as any type of written material that is designed\nto convey any kind of information, such as books, maga-\nzines, newspapers, brochures, and technological resources,\nsuch as websites. Organizations also have different defini-\ntions and understandings of the term: The National Council\nof Teachers of English (NCTE; 2011) and the International\nReadingAssociation (IRA; 2012) group informational text in\nthe nonfiction genre. The American Library Association\n(ALA) describes informational text as books that are written\nand illustrated to present, organize, and interpret document-\nable, factual material (American Association of School\nLibrarians [AASL], 2011). According to the National\nAssessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), texts are either\nliterary or informational (National Assessment Governing\n1Lourdes University, Sylvania, OH, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nBarbara A.

Braker-Walters1\n Keywords\nCommon Core State Standards, basal reading texts, informational text, content analysis\n2 SAGE Open\nBoard [NAGB], 2008). Educators need to be aware that the\nCommon Core State Standards (CCSS) uses the definition of\ninformational text found in the NAEP framework (National\nGovernorsAssociation Center for Best Practices and Council\nof Chief State School Officers [NGA Center and CCSSO],\n2010a). This is important when interpreting research, as the\ndefinition is not always used in the same way across\nstudies.\nChildren's use of informational text increases as they\nadvance through school (Hall & Sabey, 2007; Jeong, Gaffney,\n& Choi, 2010). Much of the reading that students will\nencounter in later grades, and continue to negotiate during\nlife, is of an informational nature (Baker et al., 2011; Brozo,\nmajor proportion of the materials children encounter during\n2011), a major predictor of overall student achievement is\nthe skillful use of literacy strategies during content area read-\ning (Vacca et al., 2009). It has been determined that the per-\ncentage of informational text found in standardized tests can\nConsequently, students who have little experience with\ninformational text are likely to score lower on standardized\nThe Common Core State Standards for English and\nLanguage Arts (CCSS-ELA) will have a significant effect on\nwhat teachers teach and what primary students are expected\nto be able to read (Bomer & Maloch, 2011). According to the\nCCSS-ELA, by the end of fourth grade, reading experiences\nshould be evenly balanced between literary text and informa-\ntional text (NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b). In addition,\ninstruction for acquiring the skills needed to comprehend\ninformational text in the content areas must be incorporated\ninto the reading and language arts curriculum starting in the\nsecond grade (NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b). Although\nMoss (2008) found that nonfiction text was represented in\nabout 40% of the total text found in two California basal\nreading series, only 50% of nonfiction text selections were\ninformational, which amounted to only 20% of the overall\ntext. A more recent study conducted by Yopp and Yopp\nbooks that were read aloud to preschool to Grade 3 children,\nwhereas only 8% were described as informational text. Jeong\net al. (2010) found that third- and fourth-grade students aver-\naged only 16 minutes per day of informational text use in the\nclassroom. Finally, it has been reported that only 33% of\nclassroom libraries contain informational text (Ness, 2011).\nThis evidence suggests that student exposure to informa-\ntional text is lacking in most classrooms.\nResearch has determined that the volume of text and\nopportunities to read significantly predict text comprehension\n(Brenner & Hiebert, 2010). However, the concept of reading\nvolume is more complex than simple tabulations of the num-\nber of words contained in text. Allington (2009) suggested\nthat mastery of specific skills (such as identifying the number\nof syllables in a word or reciting phonics generalizations) did\nnot necessarily lead to fluency and comprehension skill in\nreading.After reviewing research, Hiebert and Martin (2009)\npostulated that reading volume is affected by variables such\nas text complexity, instructional context, and students' read-\ning engagement or interest. In addition, the CCSS-ELA spe-\ncifically addresses students'ability to read increasingly more\ncomplex text; explicit guidelines are included in the form of\nquantitative indices inAppendixAand in the listing of exam-\nple texts in Appendix B (NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b).\nHiebert (2013) suggested that when students get \"easier\"\ntexts, these texts are often simply shorter in length and not\nsubstantially different in the load of vocabulary. As informa-\ntional text can contain graphs, diagrams, and other illustra-\ntive renderings (NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b), it is\nimpossible to determine exposure to reading volume by cal-\nculating word count.\nAccording to Education Market Research (2012), approx-\nimately 84% of American teachers use basal reading pro-\ngrams for classroom instruction. Moreover, studies have\nestimated that 80% to 90% of elementary teachers predomi-\nnately depend on basal readers, its accompanying work-\nbooks, and other commercially prepared ancillary materials\nas a literacy instruction (Stephens, 2007). Three major text-\nbook companies, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Macmillan/\nMcGraw-Hill, and Pearson Scott Foresman, publish the most\nwidely purchased basal reading programs in the United\nStates. These companies represent 83% of the overall U.S.\nsales for the elementary market in basal reading textbooks\nAs many teachers may need to change their curriculum\nand adjust instruction to meet the informational text recom-\nmendations as defined by the CCSS-ELA, they need to be\naware of the types and extent of informational text found in\nnewly published basal reading texts to align curriculum and\ninstruction to meet the defined fourth-grade informational\ntext recommendations of the CCSS-ELA (NGA Center and\nthe contents of basal reading texts is one means of under-\nstanding the extent to which students are exposed to informa-\ntional text during reading instruction.\nMethod\nThe method of quantitative content analysis was used in this\ndata were gathered from 3 fourth-grade basal reading text-\nbooks: (a) Journeys, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt\n(2012); (b) Treasures, published by Macmillan/McGraw-\nHill (2011); and (c) Reading Street, published by Pearson\nScott Foresman (2011). These documents are published texts\nand are publicly available.\nThe percentage of informational text, as defined by the\nCCSS-ELA (NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b), was exam-\nined within each basal reading text using procedures of\nBraker-Walters 3\nquantitative content analysis. The results were subdivided\naccording to three categories: (a) genre (informational or\nliterary), (b) type of text (fiction, literary nonfiction,\npoetry, informational text, argumentative or persuasive\ntext, and procedural text or documents), and (c) publisher\n(Journeys, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011; Treasures,\nMacmillan/McGraw-Hill, 2011; and Reading Street, Scott\nForesman, 2012). The percentages of text type for each\ncategory were reported to display differences based on\ngenre, type of text, and textbook publisher. Data were col-\nlected using Krippendorff's (1980) structure for collection\nand analysis, and were coded by two individuals to ensure\nreliability.\nThis study utilized \"hand coding,\" where one actually\nreads the text passages to critically understand and think\nabout the text before coding. While computer analysis is use-\nful for working with structure, human coders are more capa-\nble of assigning meaning and establishing relations between\ntext features (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2011). For these\nreasons, hand coding was the most valid method of collect-\ning data for this study, allowing for effective analysis of the\ninformational text categorical content that aligned with the\ndefinitions of the CCSS-ELA (NGA Center and CCSSO,\nMaterials\nThe codebook and coding form used in this study were\ndeveloped prior to the data gathering, following procedures\nmost recently utilized by Watkins (2010; see Appendix A).\nThe codebook contained detailed procedures for coding each\ntext selection, detailed descriptions of each variable, and\nstep-by-step instructions of the coding process (seeAppendix\nA). The coding form acted as an organizational tool for\nrecording data, and encompassed the following categories:\npublisher, title and author of selection, start page, number of\npages, and text type classification (see Appendix B). Using\nthe coding form, the text types and the percentage of each\ntype contained in each publisher's basal student textbook\nwere calculated and presented as a table. Then, the overall\ntotals were used to compare each publisher with CCSS-ELA\nrecommendations (NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b).\nMany basal text publishers advertise on their respective\nwebsites that their basal reader materials adhere to the CCSS\n(Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011; Macmillan/McGraw-Hill,\nonly in the teacher's manuals or in ancillary resources may be\nincluded in this claim. While selections from these materials\nmay be presented during classroom instruction, they were not\nincluded in this study because they were not presented as\ninclusionary text in the main student basal reader. Because of\nthis, only selections that appeared in the main student text-\nbook, directed to all learners, were analyzed and coded.\nProcedures\nTo enhance the levels of reliability, this study assessed inter-\ncoder reliability, using a full sample, during the pilot. Pilot\ncoding was conducted to train the coder with the coding sys-\ntem. The coding method was calibrated to stabilize the cod-\ners' techniques, so that the coders viewed the content in the\nsame way without discussion or collaboration. Consensus\nwas reviewed during training and piloting, and revisions\nwere made before final coding commenced. As blind coding,\nin which coders are unaware of the research questions or\nhypothesis that guide the investigation, is preferable to\nreduce bias (Neuendorf, 2002), the coder in this study under-\nstood the categories and measures, but was not informed of\nthe purpose of the study. In addition, as human text coding\nworks best with hard copies of text (Saldana, 2013), only\nhard copies of the textbooks were analyzed in this study.\nIn this study, a pilot study was conducted prior to com-\nmencing data collection. During the pilot, identical copies of\nthe fourth-grade edition of Harcourt Trophies (2003) were\nused to assess intercoder reliability. Forty selections were\nexamined, and Krippendorff's alpha was used to measure the\nreliability coefficients between coders. Interrater reliability\nwas determined to be .94. Therefore, the reliability of the\ncoders was deemed acceptable to continue with the main\nstudy.\nData concerning the text types and percentage of total text\nwere collected during the main study by examining and hand\ncoding the text selections. Coders categorized each variable\nand referenced where each recording unit was found.\nDefinitions of units, including procedures for identifying\nthem, were established according to the definition of infor-\nmational text types found in the CCSS-ELA (NGA Center\nand CCSSO, 2010b). The data were hand coded as software\nprograms do not accurately quantify text by genre (Saldana,\n2013). In addition, given that historical fiction and poetry are\nnot included by the CCSS-ELA in this genre, the coders may\nneed to revisit text selections to confirm adherence to speci-\nfications of the CCSS-ELA's informational text definition\nTwo measures were used to determine the percentage of\ninformational text found in each grade-level text. The first\nclassified text by genre; the second calculated the number of\npages devoted to each genre. Text genre was coded and data\nwere collected according to the CCSS-ELA definition of text\ntypes (NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b). The number of\ninstances each text type appeared and the total number of\npages for each text type were tabulated according to pub-\nlisher. The volume of total text presented, as opposed to the\nnumber of stories, provided in basal readers is significantly\nrelated to the amount students have to read (Brenner &\nHiebert, 2010). As informational text can contain graphs,\ndiagrams, and other illustrative renderings that present infor-\nmation, determining the number of pages devoted to\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 3.

The number of instances each genre appeared\nand the total number of pages for each genre selection were\ncoded and calculated according to publisher.\nThe observed frequency in each category was reported\nand compared for significant differences in the expected fre-\nquencies for each publisher using a chi-square goodness-\nof-fit test. A chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used to test\nthe association between the null hypotheses from which the\ndata sample was drawn to the hypothesized distribution. The\ndifference between the observed frequency distributions was\nreviewed to determine statistical significance.\nData collection occurred during the examination and cod-\ning of text selections presented in the three most widely pub-\nselections were restricted to actual student reading selections\nlisted in the table of contents of each text. After the basal\ntexts were coded, information from the coding forms was\ntransferred to the database and tabulated. Final calculations\nwere used to determine the percentage of informational text\nfound at the fourth-grade level for each type of informational\ntext (expository, argumentative or persuasive texts, and pro-\ncedural texts or documents) and for each of the three text-\nbooks. The percentages of text types for each category were\nreported, with tables to display differences based on type of\ntext and textbook publisher.\nResults\nAlthough the percentage of genre selections was fairly con-\nsistent across publishers, results indicated that the total num-\nber of text selections varied among publishers. Overall,\nMacmillan/McGraw-Hill Treasures contained the highest\nnumber of selections, whereas Houghton Mifflin Harcourt\nJourneys had the least number of selections (see Table 1).\nHowever, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Journeys devoted the\nlargest percentage of text selections to literary text, whereas\nMacmillan/McGraw-Hill Treasures (2011) contained the\nlargest percentage of informational text selections. This\nfinding is similar to previous studies that found differences\nin the number of text selections across publishers (Moss,\nNumber of text pages. The percentage of text pages devoted\nto the different text genres was also fairly consistent between\nthe three publishers. However, the total number of text pages\nvaried among publishers (see Table 2). Overall, Macmillan/\nMcGraw-Hill Treasures contained the most text pages with a\ntotal of 587 pages. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Journeys,\nwith 492 pages, had the least number of text pages. In con-\ntrast, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Journeys devoted the larg-\nest percentage of text pages to literary text, whereas Pearson\nScott Foresman Reading Street (2011) contained the smallest\npercentage of literary text pages.\nResults from the frequencies and percentages of text\nselections (see Table 3) show that basal readers contain a\ngreater number of literary text selections (fiction, nonfiction,\nand poetry) compared with informational text selections\n(expository, argumentative or persuasive, and procedural\ntext or documents). This finding is consistent with the results\nof previous studies, which indicated that literary text com-\nprises a major proportion of the materials children encounter\nWhile the CCSS-ELA recommends 50% of the text stu-\ndents are exposed to be of the informational genre, the basal\nTable 1.

While the CCSS-ELA suggests that informational text\nmust constitute 50% of the text that students are to read at the\nfourth-grade level, these basal readers contained an average\nof 31% of selections devoted to informational text. In addi-\ntion, the number of pages devoted to informational text\nranged from 14% to 18% across publishers. This current\nfinding is distressing as many teachers depend on basal read-\ners as a primary instructional resource for teaching reading.\nAs a result, the selection of a basal reading program can be\ncompared with choosing a reading curriculum. Consequently,\nchoosing a reading program that does not meet the bench-\nmarks specified by the CCSS-ELA could inhibit student\nlearning by denying them the opportunity to experience the\ntext types needed for college and career readiness.\nPotential limitations may affect the interpretation of the\nresults of this study. One potential limitation deals with the\ntext selections that were presented in the main student text\nand listed in the table of contents. Uncategorized segments\nof text that were not listed in the student basal table of con-\ntents, including study guides and extension activities, were\nnot included in the analysis. In addition, selections that\nappeared in the teacher's manuals, but were not contained in\nthe main student text, were not included in the analysis.\nAlthough these selections may be presented during class-\nroom instruction, they were not examined because they were\nnot offered as specific inclusionary text in the main student\nbasal reader.\nIn addition, the determination of text length of the selec-\ntions could impair the interpretation of the results. While\nword count may have provided a more accurate understand-\ning of the reading volume for each text selection, this total\nwould not take into account font size, picture size, margin\nwidth, pacing, or complexity. As the CCSS-ELA specifies\nthat informational text can contain graphs, diagrams, and\nother illustrative renderings (NGA Center and CCSSO,\n2010b), determining the number of pages devoted to infor-\nmational text more accurately answered the research\nquestions.\nConclusion\nThe CCSS-ELA requires the integration of a substantial\namount of informational text into curricula to ensure that\nstudents are prepared to meet the requirements of college and\ncareer readiness (Porter, McMaken, Hwang, & Yang, 2011).\nAs instruction in the use of informational text rarely occurs\nduring content area lessons, instructing students on how to\nread these texts often becomes the responsibility of the class-\nBasal readers play a central role in preparing students for\nthe types of texts they will encounter as they move through\nschool (Brenner & Hiebert, 2010). This study analyzed the\namount of informational text found in the three most widely\npurchased, commercially published fourth-grade basal read-\ning texts. The percentage of informational text, as defined by\nthe CCSS-ELA (NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b), was\nexamined within each basal reading text using procedures of\nquantitative content analysis. The results suggest that the\nnewly published basal readers contain an unbalanced amount\nof literary versus informational text. To make effective\ninstructional decisions regarding reading curriculum, it is\nimperative for principals, curriculum leaders, and teachers to\nbe aware of the amount of informational text that appears in\nfourth-grade basal reading texts. Findings from this study\nwill allow practitioners to make effective instructional deci-\nsions regarding reading curriculum, including the purchase\nof basal ancillary materials or supplemental texts that con-\ntain the necessary amount of informational text.\nThe data results of this study also indicated differences in\nthe number of text selections presented in basal readers as\nwell as the number of pages of total text presented. These are\nsignificant findings that can be associated with the amount of\nreading experiences presented to students during classroom\ninstruction. As text can contain graphs, diagrams, and other\nillustrative renderings, the number of pages devoted to spe-\ncific text genre provides an accurate description of the vol-\nume of informational text presented to students. Previous\nresearch determined that the volume of text in basal readers\nis significantly related to the amount students have to read\nand interact with text (Brenner & Hiebert, 2010).\nFuture research might include examination of all text\nassociated with a student basal reading series. Different\ntypes of text genre may be presented throughout the book\nthat is not listed in the table of contents. For example,\nPearson Scott Foresman Reading Street (2012) had a great\ndeal of informational text that was presented as review\nthroughout the text. However, as these review pages were\nnot included in the table of contents, they were not counted\nas a text selection or totaled into the number of pages. In\naddition, some publishers may include text found in ancil-\nlary materials as contributing to the overall totals of text\ngenre exposure. Examining all materials that are associated\nwith a basal reading series may affect the amount of text that\nis presented to students.\nFuture studies might also be conducted to (a) compare the\namount of genre types found in basal readers with\n6 SAGE Open\nstandardized reading tests and (b) examine the amount of\ngenre types found in standardized tests to the Common Core\nStandards recommendations. As part of the Race to the Top\nprogram, the U.S. Department of Education (2012) has\nauthorized the development of new standardized tests to be\naligned with the Common Core Standards. These tests are\nwith testing to be conducted annually on students from third\ngrade through high school. If schools are using basal reading\nprograms for the majority of reading instruction, teachers\nneed to be cognizant of the types and amounts of text genres\nthat students will be expected to understand.\nIn conclusion, research has shown that as students prog-\nress through grade levels, they are expected to comprehend\nand learn from an increasing amount of informational text\nskill in utilizing informational text is critical to achievement\nin school and beyond (Kraemer, McCabe, & Sinatra, 2012).\nAs approximately 84% of American teachers utilize a com-\nmercially prepared basal reading series for classroom read-\ning instruction (Dewitz, Jones, & Leahy, 2009; Education\nMarket Research, 2012), it is imperative that school admin-\nistrators, teachers, and other educational stakeholders\nclosely examine basal student reading texts to verify the\namount and type of informational text. School districts and\nteachers may need to purchase basal ancillary materials or\nsupplementary texts to address the standard set for informa-\ntional text set by the CCSS-ELA (NGA Center and CCSSO,\nAppendix A\nCodebook\nProcedure for coding text selections for text type and content\narea\n1.
