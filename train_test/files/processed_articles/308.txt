Most of the\ndebate and associated empirical work have focused on elites. On the one\nhand, it has been argued that the merit-based imperial examination system\noffered opportunities for advancement to those who were not the sons or\ngrandsons of officials.

Those who were not members of such networks were shut out.\nSociety, as a result, was more ``closed'' than would be apparent from an\nanalysis of the association between fathers' and sons' outcomes.\nThe extent of social mobility in rural China before the twentieth century\nis even less clear. It used to be assumed that local society was more static\nthan elite society. Climbing the lowest rungs of the ladder of success was\ndifficult because families needed to accumulate substantial resources\nbefore they could even consider such mobility strategies as the education\nof their sons. Locally prominent families, meanwhile, could make use of\ntheir economic, political, and social resources to maintain their position\nfrom one generation to the next.

One\nof the most frequently noted features of Chinese society was the\nimportance of the extended family, including distant kin. As Hymes\nargued, even if the sons of successful imperial examination candidates had\nonly a slight advantage when it came to succeeding in the examinations\nthemselves, there may have been networks of kin that were disproportion-\nately successful at securing opportunities for their members. Similarly, in\nrural Liaoning, even if the possession of an official title by father or other\nco-resident kin had only a mild effect on the chances that a male would\nattain a title, the results in Lee and Campbell5 cannot rule out the\npossibility that members of particular lineages nevertheless accounted for\nmost of the men with official titles. Similarly, the results in Lee and\nCampbell6 cannot rule out a role for transmission between related males\nliving in separate households. In situations where the transmission of\nstatus from one generation to the next was highly diffuse, only a weak\nassociation between the outcomes of father and son would be apparent,\neven if most or all of the men who succeeded on the examinations or\nattained titles were from a relatively small number of families.\nTo account for the potential role of kin networks in determining\nmobility outcomes in late imperial China, we apply quantitative methods\nto nominative, longitudinal population-register data. The population-\nregister data cover a population of largely rural residents of Liaoning\nidentification of the paternal kin of an individual even if they are distantly\nrelated. Measurement of the characteristics of kin is thus straightforward.\nWe apply discrete time-event history techniques to examine how the\npossession of titles by various kin affected the chances that a male would\nattain an official title. We focus on the effects of possession of title by\nfathers, uncles, fathers' first cousins, and fathers' second cousins. We test\ndirectly the hypothesis that society was more closed than it appears from\n3. James Lee and Cameron Campbell, Fate and Fortune in Rural China (Cambridge, 1997), pp.\n4.

We also\nexamine whether or not there was clustering among related men of the\nsame generation, holding the characteristics of the senior generation\nconstant. From these results, we can whether opportunities were available\nto all men or monopolized by particular kin networks.\nThese results will further illuminate interactions between kin living in\nseparate households in historical China. A distinguishing feature of the\nlongitudinal population registers is that by chaining together the links\nbetween parents and children, we generate genealogies for individuals and\nidentify their distant kin. In contrast with Campbell and Lee,7 which only\nconsidered co-resident kin, here we identify kin who lived in separate\nhouseholds and examine how their characteristics affected the chances that\na male would attain a title. Extending on a line of inquiry initiated in\nCampbell and Lee,8 for these distant kin we examine whether or not co-\nresidence conditioned the effects of attaining a title.\nThese results will showcase the potential of longitudinal population\nregister data to open up a new avenue for inquiry in the analysis of social\nmobility. Until now, almost all studies of intergenerational social mobility,\nwhether historical or contemporary, have focused on the influence of\nparents' characteristics on children's outcomes, and to some extent the\nassociations between siblings' outcomes. This partly reflects the limit-\nations of the available data. The surveys that are the basis for most analyses\nof contemporary social mobility rarely provide detail on kin of the\nrespondent other than their siblings and parents. Similarly, historical\nstudies of social mobility have focused almost exclusively on associations\nbetween the outcomes of fathers and sons, and failed to address the\npossibility that kin other than the father affected the attainment of status.9\nThe remainder of the paper is divided into four sections. The first\nsection reviews in more detail debates and findings on social mobility in\nChina. Because the sociological literature on mobility in China is sparse,\nwe will consider both contemporary and historical evidence. The second\nand third sections introduce the data and methods, respectively. The\nfourth section presents and discusses results.

They are also used to work out the distribution of backgrounds\nfor the men who do attain titles. The paper concludes with a discussion of\nthe implications of the findings for our understanding of kinship and social\nmobility in historical Chinese society.\nLate imperial Chinese society is widely noted for the emphasis by the state\non achieved, not ascribed, characteristics in the recruitment and promotion\nof high-level officials. The Tang dynasty (670\u00ad906 AD) saw the\nelimination of the hereditary aristocracy. From the Song dynasty (960\u00ad\n1127 AD) onward, officials were chosen through examinations open to\nthere were no more officially recognized hereditary status distinctions,\nexcept for special situations such as membership in the imperial lineage,\nthe Eight-Banner system, and ethnicity. When it came to attaining an elite\nofficial title, ancestry should in theory only have mattered indirectly, in\nthat those from a privileged background were more likely to be educated\nand therefore successful on imperial examinations.\nThe relatively few empirical studies of social mobility in historical\nChina confirm that men of undistinguished parentage did indeed have a\nchance to attain official titles. According to one classic analysis of the\nfamily backgrounds of successful candidates on the two highest level\nperiod of peak mobility in the sixteenth century as many as one-half of\nsuccessful candidates were ``new men'', in the sense that neither their\nfathers nor their grandfathers had held a degree of any sort.10 While certain\nfamilies were consistently successful at launching their sons into official\ncareers, there appears to have been room at the top for men from less\ndistinguished families, and accordingly a steady infusion of new blood.\nThe few available quantitative studies for rural Chinese populations\nbefore the twentieth century also suggest that society was open. For that\ncommunity, analysis of household registers showed that over one-half of\nthe men who attained a state occupation were the sons of men who had\nnever held one.11 One-third of men who attained a state occupation not\nonly had a father who had never held an occupation, but had never lived\nwith anyone who had ever held one. This preliminary study, based as it\nwas on simple bivariate tabulations, did not measure the influence of the\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. ReadCube, on 22 Jan 2017 at 14:48:42, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available\nexperiences of fathers and other kin, nor did it attempt to measure how\nsuccessful men with status were at transmitting their status to their sons. A\nmore refined analysis of an expanded dataset that applied multivariate\nevent-history techniques to distinguish between the effects of different co-\nresident kin reached a similar conclusion.12 While the possession of a title\nby senior male kin other than the father increased the chances that a male\nwould acquire one himself, there was little evidence that particular\nhouseholds monopolized titles. Depending on the type of title considered,\nbetween one-half and two-thirds of men who acquired titles appear to\nhave been ``new'' in the sense that no one present in the household had ever\nheld one.\nWhat little evidence exists for China during the middle of the twentieth\ncentury hints that it may have been relatively ``open'' by the standards of\nother societies. While results likely reflect the strong emphasis by the post-\n1949 state on egalitarianism in the allocation of educational and\noccupational opportunities, we note them here to provide some back-\nground. The clearest evidence is from analysis of educational attainment.\nIn an analysis of 1982 Chinese census data on men in multigenerational\nhouseholds, Deng and Treiman13 found that the influence of the father's\neducational attainment on their own educational attainment for men born\nin the 1940s was half as strong as in other countries. As for occupational\nmobility, one study revealed that even though the high proportion of\nfarmers in the population led to a low rate of total mobility, the vast\nmajority of holders of high-status occupations were the children of parents\nin low-status occupations. Less than 20 per cent of professionals, for\nexample, were the children of professionals. Roughly half were the\nchildren of farmers.14\nAgreement about the openness of historical Chinese society is by no\nmeans universal. One detailed study of elites in a southern Chinese\ncommunity during the Song dynasty claimed that many of the men who\nsucceeded in the imperial examinations, even though their fathers or\ngrandfathers were undistinguished, had been assisted by distant kin who\nhad been successful.15 Members of certain kin networks, in other words,\nhad a substantial advantage when it came to taking the examinations and\nstarting on official careers. Those who were not fortunate enough to be\n12. Campbell and Lee, ``Family Background''.\n13. Zhong Deng and Donald J.

In the early part of the twentieth century, Lang17 and others\nidentified the importance of kin networks as an obstacle to economic\ndevelopment in China because the intense pressure on individuals with\ninfluence over hiring decisions to take care of their relatives spawned\nnepotism and particularism. More recently, Greenhalgh,18 Whyte,19\nWong,20 and others have suggested that strong ties between kin, co-\nresident and non-co-resident, contributed to rapid economic growth in\nGreater China from the 1970s onwards. Kin are claimed to be sources of\nreliable employees, capital, contacts, and information. Anthropologists, of\ncourse, have written extensively on the role of lineages, especially in south\nChina.21 In the past, well-organized lineages provided educational and\nother opportunities to their members. More recently, Bian22 showed that\nin urban China in the 1980s, individuals relied heavily on their social\nnetworks, including their kin, to secure economic opportunities in an\nenvironment where jobs were almost all assigned by the state.\nIn our analysis, accordingly, we will distinguish between two opposing\nhypotheses about the extent of intergenerational social mobility in rural\nLiaoning. On the one hand, if official titles in this rural population were\nallocated according to the same merit-oriented principles as official titles\namong the national elites, inheritance should have been relatively weak.\nSimulation results should reveal low probabilities that the sons of men\nwith titles would acquire titles themselves, and high probabilities that the\nmen who did acquire an official title had no kin, co-residing or not, who\nheld an official titles. On the one hand, if particular networks of kin were\n16. It is unclear how much to make of Hymes's (1986) conclusions, however, since he cast a wide\nnet when identifying distant kin who may have helped men at their examinations. It is entirely\npossible that any random sample of men from elite families would exhibit the same proportions\nwith successful distant kin as his sample of successful examination candidates.\n18.

Over the past few decades, a number of studies of\nintergenerational mobility in the past have appeared.23 These studies, like\nthis one, mostly focused on specific populations that are not nationally\nrepresentative. Many of these populations are not ideal for comparison\nbecause they were urban. In some cases, they were subsets of an urban\npopulation. The population analysed here, of course, is rural.\nThe goal in carrying out such a comparison is not to make a definitive\nstatement about whether China, or rural Liaoning, was more or less fluid\nthan the West, but rather to help assess claims by Hymes24 and others\nabout the rigidity associated with the importance of kinship networks in\nattaining elite positions. If Hymes25 is correct, we should find that\ndownward mobility among men whose fathers or other senior kin held\ntitle was much less than in other historical populations. More importantly,\nthe proportion of titleholders in each generation who are ``new'', in the\nsense of not having any senior relatives who also hold titles, should be\nmuch lower than the proportion of elites in other populations who are\n``new'' in the sense of having undistinguished fathers.\nWe also seek to distinguish between two hypotheses about the nature of\nrelationships between kin living in separate households. On the one hand,\nthe common understanding that the descent group or lineage played an\nimportant role in structuring individual outcomes in historical China leads\nto an expectation that the influence of the characteristics of kin should\nhave been independent of whether or not they actually resided in the same\nhousehold. On the other hand, empirical results on the influence of\n23.

In that analysis, the characteristics of kin affected the\nmarriage chances of a male only if the kin resided in the same household.\nThe characteristics of kin living outside the household had no influence on\nmarriage chances.\nOur study focuses on a population of hereditary tenants who lived on state\nfarms in Liaoning province in northeast China during the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries. These hereditary tenants were the descendants of\nHan Chinese settlers recruited by the state to move from Shandong\nProvince in the late seventeenth century and repopulate the Chinese\nnortheast, which had been emptied in the course of the Ming\u00adQing\ntransition in the first half of the seventeenth century. The settlers were\ngiven the right to farm land controlled by the Eight Banners, a civil and\nmilitary administration that was a key part of the Qing state. Each was\nassociated with one of several dozen separately registered state farm\npopulations. In terms of their institutional context, these tenants are\nperhaps most comparable to tenants on crown lands in historical Europe.\nThey did have some distinguishing features. In particular, though they\ncould not move from the state lands, they could move within them.\nFor the purposes of this analysis the most important feature of these\nstate-farm tenants is that their association with the Eight-Banner system\nmade them eligible for official titles. There were altogether five categories\nof official title: banner, civil service, examination, honorary, and household\ngroup leader. The first three categories were formal governmental offices\nand often included a generous salary and other perquisites. Banner titles\nwere associated with position in the Eight-Banner system, while civil\nservice titles were associated with positions elsewhere in the bureaucracy.\nExamination titles came with success in the official examinations. The\nfourth category, honorary titles, were typically purchased. They are\nindicative of individual or family wealth. The fifth category, household\ngroup leader, or zuzhang, is by far the most common and refers to an\nunsalaried position at the lowest level of local banner administration. We\ndo not consider it in our analysis.\nPossession of an official title was the most important source of privilege\nin this society, so that titleholders constituted an elite.27 They accounted\nfor roughly 5 per cent of adult males in the populations studied here at any\n26.

While we do not have detailed data on the specific salary and\nperquisites associated with each title, we know that they were often\nsufficient to support several families, and came both in cash and in kind.\nThe privilege associated with holding a title is reflected in the data in\nimportant demographic outcomes.28 Titleholders and their sons married\nearlier and in higher proportions, and once married, had more children.\nWhile in implications of holding a title for men and their immediate kin are\nclear, our analysis of the implications for more distant relatives is ongoing.\nThe state-farm tenants lived in approximately 400 distinct communities\nscattered across a swath of land in Liaoning equivalent in size to the\nNetherlands. Figure 2 summarizes the geographic distribution of observa-\ntions, with each circle corresponding to a community and its size\ncorresponding to the number of observations it contributed. The swath\nran from the coast of the Bohai Gulf on the Liaodong Peninsula in\nsouthwest Liaoning all the way to a hilly and remote region in the\nnorthwest of the province. The southern state-farm systems were all\nlocated in or near what is now Gaiping county on the Liaodong Peninsula.\nThey were either on or close to the coast of the Bohai Gulf. They were\nclose to Yingkou, which became a treaty port open to international trade in\n1858. The northern state farms lay were scattered in a belt that ran from\nwhat is now the provincial capital, Shenyang, to a hilly and remote region\nin the northeast of the province.\nThe data on the tenants is derived from ``Household and Population\nRegisters of the Eight-Banner Han Army'' (Hanjun baqi rending hukou ce).\nThis source is described in detail in Lee and Campbell,29 which also\nprovides additional background on the population. The household\nregisters were compiled on a triennial basis for a number of Han banner\npopulations living on state farms in the northeast and certain other\nlocations from the early eighteenth century until 1909. The Qing relied\nheavily on these registers for civilian and military administration of these\npopulations. They accordingly devised a system of internal crosschecks to\nensure consistency and accuracy. First, they assigned every person in the\nbanner population to a residential household (linghu) and registered them\non a household certificate (menpai). Then they organized households into\nclans (zu), and compiled annually updated clan genealogies (zupu). Finally,\nevery three years they compared these genealogies and household\ncertificates with the previous household register to compile a new register.\nThey deleted and added people who had exited or entered in the last three\nyears and updated the ages, relationships, and official titles of those people\nwho remained. Each register, in other words, completely superseded its\npredecessor.\n10 Cameron Campbell and James Lee\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Indeed, individuals who departed from the area\nwithout permission were actually identified in the registers as ``escapees''\n(taoding). As a result, the Eight-Banner household registers are the most\nextensive and detailed records of a any rural Chinese population in the late\nThe registers record at three-year intervals for each person in the target\npopulation the following information in order of appearance: official title\n(if any); relationship to the household head; name(s); adult banner status;\nage in sui; animal birth year; lunar birth month, birthday, and birth hour;\nmarriage, death, or emigration, if any, during the intercensal period;\nphysical disabilities, if any, and if the person is an adult male; name of their\nkin-group head; banner affiliation; and village of residence. Individuals are\nlisted one to a column in order of their relationship to the head, with his\nchildren and grandchildren listed first, his co-resident siblings and their\ndescendants listed next, and then uncles, aunts, and cousins. Wives are\nalways listed immediately after their husbands, unless they are superceded\nby a co-resident widowed mother-in-law.\nThe registers are distinguished by the possibilities for record linkage\nacross time and between kin. Individuals can be followed very easily from\none register to the next because they appear in almost the same order in\nsuccessive registers. Accordingly, it is relatively straightforward to\nreconstruct life histories and generate variables describing such past\ncharacteristics as whether or not a male had previously held a title. Perhaps\nmore importantly, by comparison of observations for the same individual\nin successive registers, we can construct outcome measures indicating\nwhether or not particular events took place in a particular time interval.\nFor this analysis, as described later, we construct indicators of whether or\nnot males acquire official titles between one register and the next.\nThe extensive detail on household relationship, meanwhile, allows for\nreconstruction of genealogies and identification of kin living in the same or\ndifferent households. Our basic procedure is to chain together the links\nbetween fathers and sons to identify grandfathers, great-grandfathers, and\nmore distant male ancestors. Table 1 summarizes the numbers of\ngenerations back for which it is possible to trace the men recorded in\nthe observations. Males whose grandfathers can be identified accounted\nfor slightly more than two-thirds of the observations. Males whose great-\ngrandfathers can be identified accounted for nearly one-half of the\nobservations. How far back an individual's ancestry may be traced\ndepends largely on when they lived. Many of the men who were born in\nthe last decades of the nineteenth century or the first decade of the\ntwentieth can have their ancestry traced back six or seven generations.\n12 Cameron Campbell and James Lee\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

In this particular analysis, we restrict our analysis to eleven populations of regular\nbannermen (zhengshen qiren) under what were called the three banner commanders (san zuoling\nxia). We exclude three departmental privy purse, or guangchusi, populations who were\nresponsible for such specialized production as honey, cotton, and fish. They were administered\nseparately and accordingly behaved differently (Yizhuang Ding, Guo Songyi, James Lee, and\nCameron Campbell, Liaodong yimin de qiren shehui [Banner Society and the Settlement of\nEastern Liaodong], book manuscript, 2001). Most importantly for the purposes of this analysis,\nmost of the men in these populations appear not to have been eligible for official titles.\n34. In the Chinese system of age reckoning, individuals were 1 sui at birth, and their age was\nincremented every lunar new year. Ages reckoned in sui are on average 1.5 higher than ages\nreckoned according to the Western standard.\nTable 1.

Thus we cannot distinguish co-\nresident from non-co-resident kin in the registers before 1789. Third, the\nneed to identify the time periods in which titles were acquired requires that\nwe restrict to observations of males for which observations are also\navailable three or six years hence. Fourth, since we are interested in how\nthe characteristics of second cousins and fathers' cousins affect the chances\nof attaining a title, we only consider observations of males whose fathers,\ngrandfathers, and great-grandfathers could all be identified. Finally, since\nwe are interested in the factors that influence the chances of acquiring a\ntitle between the current and next register, we exclude observations of\nmales who currently hold titles.\nTo measure the influence of own and family characteristics on the chances\nof acquiring an official title, we use a discrete time-event-history approach.\nAn event-history approach has several advantages for the study of\nmobility, most notably the ability to account for the effects of changes\nover time in individual characteristics and the macrosocial context.35 In\nparticular, we use complementary log\u00adlog regression, the discrete-time\napproach that yields results most comparable to those from continuous-\ntime approaches.36 The following equation summarizes the basic model:\nf( p) \u00bc \u00e20 \u00fe bX\nThe transformed probability p of an outcome of interest is expressed as a\nlinear function of a set of right-hand side variables X that measure\nindividual and family characteristics. Estimated coefficients b measure the\nstrength of the association between these variables and the complementary\nlog\u00adlog of the outcome of interest. A positive coefficient indicates that\nhigher values of the associated right-hand variable of interest are associated\nwith increased chances of the outcome. A negative coefficient indicates an\ninverse association. A coefficient close to zero suggests a lack of asso-\nciation. Tests of statistical significance help indicate whether differences\nbetween estimated coefficients and zero are large enough to reject the null\nhypothesis that there is no relationship and that the observed coefficient\nmight be the result of random variation in the data.\n35.

Because\nthe length of time until the next available observation will be positively\nassociated with the chances of acquiring an official title, we include as an\nexplanatory variable a dichotomous indicator of whether or not the next\nobservation is six years away instead of three. To measure the role of\nfamily background in determining mobility outcomes, we include as\nexplanatory variables counts of the numbers of senior kin who hold official\ntitles. Table 2 summarizes them. To measure ``classic'' father\u00adson\ninheritance, we include an indicator of whether or not the father has a\ntitle. To account for the possibility that men could be advantaged by the\npresence of other kin with titles, we include similar variables for other male\nkin. For uncles, we count the number who co-resided who held official\ntitles. We have no variable for non-co-resident uncles because there were\ntoo few of them. Even elderly men almost always lived with any surviving\nbrothers they had. For fathers' cousins with titles, we include separate\ncounts according to whether or not they co-reside.\nTo assess openness, we examine outflows and inflows calculated from\nsimulations that use the estimated coefficients as inputs. For outflows, we\nconstruct a life table from the predicted probabilities of attaining a title at\neach age, and work out the chances that a man would obtain a title if he\nsurvived to age fifty sui. If this simulation indicated that most men whose\nfathers or other senior kin held official titles acquired a title themselves, the\ninterpretation would be that certain kin networks were very successful at\nsecuring opportunities for their junior members. From this perspective,\nsociety would appear ``closed''. On the other hand, if most of the men\nwhose fathers or other senior kin held official titles failed to acquire titles\nof their own, that would indicate the presence of substantial downward\nmobility, and suggest that society was ``open''. For inflows, we calculate\npredicted probabilities of attaining a title for each of the men in the\npopulation, and from these work out the distribution of family back-\ngrounds for the sub-population of men who have a title. If most of the men\nwho acquired official titles appeared to have senior kin who already held a\ntitle, the indication would be that society was closed. If most of the men\nwho acquired titles had no senior kin who already held titles, the\nindication would be that society was open.\nTo examine whether or not there was clustering among related males of\nthe same generation in the acquisition of titles, we include counts of the\nnumbers of kin of the same generation with official titles. The goal is to\nassess whether or not some kin networks were better than others at\nsecuring titles for their members, even when the characteristics of the\nsenior generation are held equal. We include variables for the numbers of\n16 Cameron Campbell and James Lee\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. ReadCube, on 22 Jan 2017 at 14:48:42, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available\nco-resident brothers and cousins with titles. There were almost no non-co-\nresident brothers and too few non-co-resident cousins to warrant\nincluding variables for them. We also include separate counts of co-\nresident and non-co-resident second cousins with titles. Positive coeffi-\ncients on these variables would indicate the presence of clustering. While\nclustering would not indicate that society was ``closed'' in the classic sense,\nit would indicate that kin networks were important.\nWe also examine whether or not other characteristics of the family\nplayed a role. To test whether or not families positioning male members\nfor the acquisition of a title favored eldest sons, we include an indicator of\nwhether or not the man was the eldest surviving brother in a sibset. To test\nwhether larger families and households had an advantage when it came to\nacquiring titles for their members, we include a count of the number of\nbrothers in the male's sibset, and a count of the number of working-age\nmales in the household. We expect men in larger households to have had an\nadvantage because such households appear to have been better off38 and\nmay also have had more extensive social networks.\nWe include a variety of other controls to ensure that apparent effects of\nthe substantively interesting variables are not being driven by changes and\ndifferences in the composition of the population under study. To account\nfor variation between state-farm systems in the probability of attaining a\ntitle, we included a dummy variable for each state-farm system except one,\nDaoyi, which was the reference category. We control for age with a\ncategorical variable.\nTo account for temporal trends in the structure of opportunities, we\ninclude controls for year. Visual inspection of the probabilities of\nacquiring a title in successive registers revealed that they declined steadily\nafter 1860, we allowed for a change in slope in that year. To achieve this,\nwe included two variables.39 One was year, measured from 1800.

This strong effect persisted in models 2\nand 3 even after we controlled for the possession of titles by other kin, thus\nit is not attributable to the tendency for men whose fathers had titles to be\nfrom prominent families where many senior kin held titles. If that were the\ncase, the addition of controls for other senior kin would have diluted the\neffect for father.\nThe existence of other senior kin who held titles also improved the\nchances that a male would obtain one, even if they lived in other\nhouseholds. According to the results for model 3, each co-resident paternal\nuncle with a title increase the chances of obtaining one by 44.8 per cent.42\nNon-co-resident fathers' cousins with titles had an essentially identical\neffect: each one raised the chances of obtaining a title by 47.5 per cent. The\nstrength of the influence of the characteristics of nonresident kin on\nmobility outcomes is remarkable given the finding in Campbell and Lee43\nthat being related to someone with a title only increased the chances that a\nmale would marry if the kin holding the title lived in the same household.\nIt appears that a prominent relative living in another household was more\nuseful when acquiring a title than when acquiring a wife.\nBeing the son of someone with a title, however, was no guarantee of\nobtaining one.

According to these results, slightly\nmore than one-third of the men whose fathers held titles could expect to\nacquire a title of their own. Even the relatively few men who were\nfortunate enough to have more than one senior kin with a title were not\ncertain of obtaining one. Only half of the men who had both a father and\nan uncle with a title would obtain one themselves. The chances were\nsimilar for men who had both a father and a father's cousin who held titles.\nMen appeared to need at least three senior kin with titles before their own\nprobability of obtaining a title reached two-thirds.\nComparison with the few relevant published results suggests that the\nsons of holders of official titles in rural Liaoning experienced no more\ndownward mobility than the sons of privileged urban residents in North\nAmerica before the twentieth century.44 In other words, elites elsewhere\nwere as successful or more successful than the Liaoning elites at\ntransmitting their status. Thus, analysis of a sample of men in the United\nthat nearly 60 per cent of men whose fathers held white-collar occupations\nduring the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, between 51 and 71\nper cent of the sons of men with high white-collar occupations ended up\nwith an occupation in the same stratum as their fathers.46 In Hamilton,\nCanada during the middle of the nineteenth century, 67 per cent of the\nsons of men involved in clerical or professional work ended up doing such\nwork themselves.47 Only in Poughkeepsie was downward mobility for the\nchildren elites as high as in rural Liaoning. Only 35 per cent of the sons of\nmen in high white-collar occupations ended up in that stratum\nThe sons of rural Liaoning elites also seem to have been more likely to\nexperience downward mobility than their urban European counterparts.\nIn England during the last half of the nineteenth century, 42.8 of the sons\nof men in the highest occupational class ended up in that class\nthemselves.49 In Frankfurt, Germany, during the middle of the nineteenth\ncentury, 77.6 per cent of the sons of merchants were themselves merchants,\n44. Obviously, the largely urban populations referred to here are not the ideal comparison group\nfor evaluating the rigidity of rural Liaoning society. Comparison with rural populations would\nbe preferable. We are still in the process of locating relevant published results for non-Chinese\nrural populations, and hope in a future revision of this paper to incorporate such results.\n45.

Indeed, high rates of downward mobility among\nthe children and nephews of titleholders created opportunities for men\nfrom undistinguished backgrounds. Table 5 presents distributions of\nfamily backgrounds for the men who acquired titles, based on predicted\nprobabilities for actual observations. According to these results, almost\ntwo-thirds of the men who acquired titles had no senior kin with a title.\nOnly slightly more than one-sixth were the sons of men with titles. The\nremaining one-sixth consisted of men who had more than one senior kin\nwith a title.\nCompared to elites in North America, therefore, office holders in rural\nLiaoning were as likely or more likely to be ``new blood''.

Every additional brother with a title more than doubled\nthe chances of obtaining one. Every additional co-resident cousin with a\ntitle increased the chances of obtaining one by 24.6 per cent. Kin of the\nsame generation but living elsewhere appear not to have had any effects;\nthus, this appears to have been largely a household phenomenon.\nClustering effects appear to have been most important for the men who\nwere at higher risk of obtaining a title because of their parentage.\nAccording to the predicted probabilities in Table 7, 45 per cent of men\nwho had both a father and a brother with titles would obtain one. In\ncontrast, only 30 per cent of the men who had a father but no brothers with\na title would obtain one, a 15 percentage-point disadvantage. While the\nproportional effect of a brother with a title was just as strong for men\nwhose fathers had no title, the absolute effect was much weaker, so that\nhaving a brother with a title yielded only a 5 percentage-point advantage.\nSince the effects of clustering were concentrated among the men who were\nalready predisposed to acquire a title by their parentage, a replication of\nthe calculations in Table 5, not shown here, show that the proportion of\ntitle holders who have no kin with titles declines only slightly when\nbrothers and cousins are accounted for.\nOne implication of this clustering was that for a man with a title, having\nmany surviving sons was not necessarily an efficient strategy for ensuring\nthat at least one son acquired a title. Additional sons had a much smaller\neffect on the chances that at least one would obtain a title than would be\nthe case in the absence of clustering. Table 8 presents the results of an\nexamination of title attainment among sets composed of brothers surviving\nat least to age forty. It presents the percentages of sets where at least one\nTable 8.

According to these results, if a man with a title had\none son who survived into his early forties, there was a 34.8 per cent\nchance that he would acquire a title. If a man with a title had two surviving\nsons, however, there was only a 40.6 per cent chance that at least one\nwould have a title. These numbers are very different from the ones\nexpected if the chances of attaining a title were independent of sibset size\nand not subject to clustering. If that were the case, 38.4 per cent of only\nsons would acquire titles, and 62.1 per cent of brother pairs would include\nat least one brother with a title.62\nWe have demonstrated that longitudinal, nominative data from population\nregisters has considerable potential to open up a new avenue of inquiry in\nthe analysis of social mobility. We expanded the focus from the father\u00adson\ndyad to the extended family, including nonresidential kin. By linking\nindividuals to their distant relatives, including those living in other\nhouseholds, and using the measured characteristics of those relatives as\nexplanatory variables, we carried out an analysis of social mobility that\nproperly accounted for the potentially important role of kin other than\nparents and siblings. We were able to translate influential claims about the\nrole of kinship networks in social mobility in historical China into testable\nhypotheses, and evaluate them.\nWhile our specific interest was in accounting for the potential\nimportance of distant kin in mobility outcomes in a Chinese setting, these\nresults should be of general interest because of the novelty of our\napproach. To our knowledge, comparable studies that consider the\npotential effects on mobility outcomes of senior kin other than the father\nand grandfather are extremely rare, not just for historical societies, but for\ncontemporary societies as well. We have demonstrated here that even\nwhen the characteristics of father and grandfather are controlled for,\neffects are apparent for other senior kin. As similarly detailed and\nvoluminous household register data for other historical societies become\navailable, we look forward to comparison with results from the replication\nof these calculations. Such comparison would help assess whether the\neffects of senior kin reflect the distinct characteristics of kinship networks\nin historical China, or are typical for historical societies. In the absence of\ncomparable results from elsewhere, we cannot answer this question, only\noffer these results as a baseline for comparison for future studies.\nOur most important substantive finding, of course, is that kin other than\nthe father influenced mobility outcomes in Liaoning. Having an uncle or a\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. ReadCube, on 22 Jan 2017 at 14:48:42, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available\nfather's cousin with a title raised the chances of obtaining one. Inheritance\nof status, in other words, could be indirect. Even more importantly, we\nfound that characteristics of kin living in other households mattered for the\nacquisition of a title, even though in a previous analysis we found no\nevidence that they influenced key demographic outcomes such as the\nchances of ever marrying.63 Prominent kin living in other households may\nhave been a useful form of social capital when it came to acquiring a title,\nbut not when it came to acquiring a spouse. Kinship networks beyond the\nhousehold, in other words, may have been more important as a source of\nsocial capital than as a source of economic capital.\nRural Liaoning nevertheless appears to have been as open as many other\nhistorical populations for which it has been possible to analyze social\nmobility, if not more so. The sons and other junior kin of title holders were\nas likely or more likely to experience downward mobility than the sons of\nelites in selected North America and European populations. Even though\nhaving a title increased the chances that a son or other junior kin would\nacquire one, in other words, it was by no means a guarantee. Conversely,\neven when we allowed for the possibility of indirect inheritance, for\nexample from men to their nephews, the proportion of the elites who were\n``new'' was as high as in the European and North American populations to\nwhich comparison were made. At least in this part of China, the emphasis\non merit in the allocation of titles by the state appears to have overridden\ntendencies towards nepotism and particularism.64\nThe claim that weak associations between the outcomes of fathers and\nsons exaggerate the openness of historical Chinese society by failing to\naccount for the tendency of networks of kin to monopolize oppor-\ntunities65 appears not to be correct. While some families were especially\nsuccessful at transmitting status from one generation to the next, the effects\nof characteristics of senior kin on outcomes were too weak to guarantee\nsuccess for the junior kin in prominent families. Though Liaoning was but\none part of China, and the population studied here was a distinct subgroup\nwithin Liaoning, the findings here are likely to be relevant to other parts of\nthe country, since, as noted in Lee and Campbell66 and Ho,67 the ideology\nof advancement according to individual merit was a long-standing and\npervasive feature of Chinese society.\n63.
