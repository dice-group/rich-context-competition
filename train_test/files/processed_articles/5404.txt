Previous research has shown that numerous factors are relevant,\nincluding not only the positions of the elements within the frame, but also their colors (eg,\nand Chatterjee 2005). Among the many factors that influence the aesthetic success of a spatial\ncomposition, the one that has been studied most frequently, however, is balance. Arnheim\n(1954) famously proclaimed that an image that is balanced is more aesthetically pleasing\nthan one that is not, but he did not test this claim empirically.\nThe primary focus of the research described in this article is how preference for spatial\ncomposition is influenced by the semantic relatedness of meaningful objects, particularly\nin terms of the optimal distance between objects and their balance within the frame.(1) To\n(1) We take \"semantic relatedness\" to be a general term that encompasses categorical relatedness (eg,\nboats and bicycles are both members of the category of vehicles, but they are seldom used together),\nfunctional relatedness (eg, a paint roller and a can of paint are typically used together, but are not\nmembers of the same category--other than \"things used for painting\") as well as their combination (eg,\n26 M H R Leyssen, S Linsen, J Sammartino, S E Palmer\nforeshadow the results, we find a robust preference for closely related objects (eg, a wine\nbottle and a cake, or a bottle of liquid soap and a sponge) to be close together within the\nframe and for unrelated objects (eg, a wine bottle and a sponge, or a bottle of liquid soap and\na cake) to be far apart. Moreover, we find these relatedness effects on aesthetic preference\nto be much stronger than balance effects on preference, which proved to be surprisingly\ndifficult to document at all. Although balance is not the primary focus of our findings, we\nwill begin with a brief review of some of the relevant literature on the perception of balance\nand its effect on people's judgments of aesthetic preference.\nSome of the earliest empirical studies of balance investigated rectangular images con-\ntaining a fixed line of some particular length, width, and color, and a second line of some\nparticular length, width, and color (Pierce 1894; Puffer 1903). Observers adjusted the position\nof the second line to make the entire display appear balanced. All else being equal, test\nlines were placed further from the center than the fixed line if they were shorter, thinner,\nand/or lighter than the fixed line, but they were placed closer to the center if they were\nlonger, thicker, and/or darker. These results are consistent with physical concepts of balance,\nprovided that darker colors were treated as if they were heavier, even though colors have no\nphysical weight. The aesthetic value of balanced versus unbalanced compositions was not\nassessed, however.\nMore recently, McManus et al (1985) examined balance in images by asking observers\nto move a fulcrum left and right under each image until the image appeared balanced\nwith respect to the fulcrum. In the first experiment studying works of art, there were large\ndifferences between images, but overall the pictures were balanced near the center of the\nframe, with more images being balanced slightly left of center. In the second experiment,\nMcManus used abstract displays of one or two colored squares (red, green, or blue) in an\nextension of the displays used by Pierce. Like Pierce, McManus found that position was very\nimportant for balance judgments but that there were also significant interactions with color,\nwith red affecting balance more than blue, for example. More recently, McManus et al (2011)\ntested a highly quantified version of a theory of balance proposed by Arnheim (1954), as\nderived from Ross (1907), based on finding the center of mass in black and white photographs\nusing a physicalist model of pixel \"weight,\" in which black is maximally heavy and white\nmaximally light. The data from observers' judgments of balance did not support the model,\nhowever. Like many researchers who have studied balance, McManus concentrated on\nunderstanding how balance is perceived rather than assessing how or whether it actually\ncontributes to aesthetic preference.\nLocher (2003) and colleagues examined the importance of balance in several ways. Locher\net al (1998) recorded the actions of adults, some na\u00efve and others trained in graphic design,\nas they tried to construct aesthetically pleasing displays with nine differently sized paper\ncutouts of abstract geometrical shapes (circles, squares, or rectangles) or identically shaped\nleaves. These elements were thus largely abstract and compositionally unconstrained by\nmeaning. The participants were told to create a display that was \"both interesting and\npleasant\" by arranging the shapes within an empty frame. Video recordings were analyzed\nto determine the role of balance both during the creative process and in the final product.\nAbout half of the designs displayed symmetry at some point in the creation process, and\nthe physical weight was equally distributed around the center in many of the final designs.\nLocher et al (2001) replicated these results with adults who were trained in the visual arts.\nAlthough these results tend to support the relevance of balance for aesthetic value, they may\nsalt and pepper containers). We have not attempted to distinguish between them in this manuscript,\nbut see this as an important issue for further research.\nAesthetic preference in multiobject pictures 27\nor may not generalize to situations in which the elements of the composition are meaningful\nobjects.\nSubsequently, Locher et al (2005) examined the perception of balance in six abstract\npaintings by Piet Mondrian together with variations of those paintings in which the colors\n(red, blue, and yellow) were interchanged. They found that Mondrian's originals were all\njudged to be balanced near the center, whereas the manipulations were generally perceived\nas less well balanced. No data on aesthetic preference or response were collected, however,\nand the elements of the images were, once again, abstract and meaningless.\nWilson and Chatterjee (2005) actually measured aesthetic preference for spatial com-\npositions that varied in balance and found a significant, positive relation. Their images\nwere configurations of abstract geometrical elements (circles, squares, and hexagons) whose\nspatial distribution was manipulated to produce a wide range of values on a mathematically\ndefined index of balance (the Assessment of Preference for Balance, or APB) based on\nArnheim's (1954) structural skeleton of symmetry axes. They found that aesthetic preference\nratings were reliably correlated with this measure of balance, primarily because highly\nimbalanced configurations were disliked more than moderately balanced ones, rather than\nbecause highly balanced works were liked more than moderately balanced ones. These\nstudies did not include images of any meaningful objects, however, so they do not speak to\nthe central issues we study here. Further studies of balance by Gershoni and Hochstein (2011)\nwith brief exposures of Japanese calligraphy suggest that first-fixation balance depends\non different visual features than the APB, but once again aesthetic preferences were not\nmeasured.\nPalmer et al (2008) investigated compositional preferences in pictures of single, mean-\ningful objects. They assessed the role of balance in aesthetic judgments of pictures that\ncontained just one, easily recognizable, common object (eg, a person, flower, chair, dog,\netc) whose horizontal location within the frame was varied. Using a variety of measures,\nthey found robust evidence of a strong \"center bias\" in people's preference for the locations\nof forward-facing symmetrical objects. This is a strong bias toward balance. However, they\nalso found a powerful \"inward bias\" for left- and right-facing objects, resulting from the fact\nthat left-facing objects were preferred when positioned reliably to the right of the frame's\ncenter, and right-facing objects were preferred when positioned reliably to the left of the\nframe's center. Given that there was only one object in the picture, this inward bias clearly\ngoes against balance. Bertamini et al (2011) investigated the horizontal position of animals\nin paintings and drawings, and reported the same basic effect, which they renamed the\n\"anterior bias.\"\nIn the present studies we extended our previous research on aesthetic response for\npictures of meaningful objects by examining the horizontal placement of two common\nobjects when their individual positions could vary independently, both in relation to each\nother and in relation to the frame. In particular, we sought to understand the role of\nseparation, semantic relatedness, and balance in compositional preferences. Our specific\nconcern was in how such factors influence aesthetic preferences for images in which these\nfactors could be tightly controlled. We therefore did not study art works, but rather created\nmultiobject images that specifically allowed us to make valid scientific inferences about\nthese variables. We believe that people's aesthetic responses to these images are nevertheless\nrelevant to understanding how people perceive art, but we leave to future research the\napplication of the principles we report here to the structure of existing art works.\n28 M H R Leyssen, S Linsen, J Sammartino, S E Palmer\nThe first experiment was aimed at understanding the role of object separation and relat-\nedness in people's preference for the horizontal position of two symmetrical objects in a\nframe. As illustrated in Figure 1a, the related object pairs were a bottle of wine and a cake,\nor a liquid-soap container and a sponge. The unrelated object pairs were the same objects\ndifferently paired, thus keeping both the relative size and approximate shape of the object\npairs consistent with the related pairs (ie, a wine bottle and sponge, or a liquid-soap container\nand cake). Participants' aesthetic responses to such images were measured by fixing the\nposition of one object in the frame and asking them to adjust the position of the other object\nto make the picture most aesthetically pleasing. (This task is analogous to that used by Locher\net al (1999) in some of their studies of \"visual rightness\" of art works, but using much simpler\npictures containing just two objects.) After all of those measurements were made twice,\nobservers were asked to place the movable object in the least aesthetically pleasing position.\n(We will henceforth use the terms \"preferred\" and \"aesthetically pleasing\" interchangeably.)\nWe expected that people would prefer any pair of objects to be separated by some\nminimum distance in the picture. We also expected that related objects would be preferred\nwhen separated by a smaller distance than unrelated objects, because people would prefer a\nspatial composition that is similar to the relative distances of those objects in real life. Such a\npattern would be consistent with other \"ecological biases\" that we have found in previous\nresearch (Palmer et al 2012). We were unsure, however, how this bias might interact with\ncompositional biases such as the center bias (Palmer et al 2008) and balance (eg, Arnheim\n(a) (b)\nFigure 1. (a) Objects in Experiments 1, 2, and 3: a sponge, a plastic container of liquid dish soap, a\ncake, and a bottle of sparkling wine. (b) Example of a picture in which the sponge is fixed at the center\nposition, and the plastic container of liquid dish soap is movable (indicated by the arrow). The other\npositions in which the fixed object could be located are indicated by \"x\"s (which were never shown in\nthe pictures).\nEighteen (15 females, 3 males, ages 18\u00ad26 years) persons participated. All were students\nat the University of California, Berkeley, who participated in partial fulfillment of a course\nrequirement. All were na\u00efve to the purpose and nature of the experiment, and gave informed\nconsent in accord with the policies of the University of California, Berkeley.\nEach trial consisted of a single framed image containing two objects: one positionally fixed\nobject and one movable object, whose position could be adjusted by the participant. The\nAesthetic preference in multiobject pictures 29\nframe surrounding the image resembled a picture frame and was added to increase the\naesthetic impact of the picture. An example of such a picture is presented in Figure 1b. The\nimages all measured 1500 by 950 pixels. The fixed object was presented at one of five locations\nalong a horizontal axis. The sizes and vertical positions of the objects within the frame were\nfixed by the experimenters such that they were consistent in size, and their bottoms were\naligned (as if resting on the ground plane). One position was in the center of the screen, and\nthe others were 250 or 500 pixels to the left or right. The movable object was first presented\noutside the boundaries of the screen on either the left or the right side. By moving the mouse,\nparticipants were able to slide the movable object into the frame and across the screen at a\nconstant vertical level in a range of 500 pixels to the left and right of the center of the frame.\nOn half the trials, the movable object would slide in front of the fixed object and behind it on\nthe other half. Which of the two objects was movable was also balanced across trials. Each\nblock of the experiment consisted of 80 trials, and there were three different blocks: in the\nfirst two blocks, the participants were asked to slide the movable object to the position in\nwhich they found the picture most aesthetically pleasing, and in the third block, participants\nslid the object to the position in which they found the picture least aesthetically pleasing.\nThis resulted in a total of 240 trials.\nFour vertically symmetrical objects without a strong facing direction were used: two short,\nwide objects (sponge and cake) and two tall, thin objects (plastic container of liquid dish\nsoap and bottle of sparkling wine), as illustrated in Figure 1a. The objects were presented in\npairs consisting of one short, wide object and one tall, thin object. The presented pairs could\nconsist of related objects (sponge and liquid-soap container, or cake and wine bottle) or\nunrelated objects (sponge and wine bottle, or cake and liquid-soap container). The images of\nunrelated objects consisted of objects similar in size and shape to ensure that any effects we\nmeasured were not due to differences in these factors. Experiment 5 addresses the question\nof whether similar results would be obtained if both objects had similar shapes instead of\ndifferent ones.\nThe images were displayed using Presentation software (http://www.neurobs.com) on an\nrefreshed at a rate of 60 Hz. The participants used a mouse to slide the movable object across\nthe screen (without vertical deviation) to the position where they found the picture most\n(and later least) preferred. When they were satisfied, they pressed the left mouse button,\nwhich initiated the next trial.\nParticipants sat in a small, darkened booth. They were told that, in each trial, they would see\none object on the screen that was fixed in position and another that was movable. They were\nasked to \"slide the movable object into the frame and then to the position where they found\nthe picture most aesthetically pleasing.\" When they were satisfied with the composition of\nthe picture, they were told to press the left mouse button, at which time the center point of\nthe preferred position of the movable object was recorded.\nOn an instructional trial, the experimenter showed the participant how to slide the\nmovable object across the screen with the mouse. They, again, were told that they could\nslide the object to any position on the horizontal axes within the boundaries of the frame\nand to click the left mouse button to make their response. After the instruction trial, the\nexperimenter slid the movable object out of the frame and left the booth.\n30 M H R Leyssen, S Linsen, J Sammartino, S E Palmer\nThere were two identical blocks of trials such that each object in each pair was adjusted\ntwice to create the most preferred picture. In a third block of trials, participants were asked\nto slide the movable object to the position where they found the picture least preferred. After\neach block, the experimenter read the instructions for the next block.\n2.2 Results and discussion\nTo ensure that our assessment of the relatedness of the objects we used was accurate, we\ncarried out a short questionnaire study with 12 additional participants. We presented a\npaper sheet with the names of the object pairs that were presented in the experiment, and\nparticipants were asked to indicate how related the different object pairs were on a scale\nranging from 1 (not related at all) to 7 (very much related). The order in which the pairs\nwere presented was randomized. The average rating for the related pairs (4.96) was reliably\nparticipants agreed with us about the relatedness of the object pairs.\nTo determine whether related objects were placed closer together than unrelated objects\nin the trials on which participants were asked to place the object in the most preferred\nposition, we calculated the distance between the centers of the two objects for each pair\nof objects. To analyze the results, a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 repeated-measures analysis of variance was\nused with most/least preferred position, relatedness, and the position of the fixed objects as\nwithin-participants' factors and the distance between the two objects as dependent variable.\nThere was no significant difference between the most and least preferred placements for the\nunrelated objects were placed significantly farther from the fixed object in the most preferred\nresult indicates that they preferred unrelated objects to be farther apart. A comparison of\nthe results in Figure 2a\u00adb reveals that in the most preferred placement trials, people placed\nthe related objects closer to the fixed object than they did the unrelated objects, F(1, 17) =\n42.49, p < .001, but that in the least preferred placement trials, they placed the related objects\nfarther from the fixed object than they did the unrelated objects, F(1, 17) = 8.09, p = .011.\nNotice that, overall, there was a main effect of fixed-object position in which interobject\ndistances were shorter for the central fixed-object position and larger as the fixed object was\nbetween the fixed-object position and semantic relatedness in which the positional effect\nof the fixed object was greater for some conditions than others, F(4, 68) = 5.08, p = .001.\nThese effects probably are driven to a large extent by geometrical constraints imposed by the\ndifferent fixed-object position conditions, given that the maximum distances (and therefore\nthe range of possible distances) increase monotonically from the center position to the most\nlaterally extreme positions.\nWe carried out analogous analyses of the degree of balance in the most and least pre-\nferred placements of the movable objects. We defined an index of balance--actually, an\ninverse index of balance, which we call Imbalance (IB)--and defined it as the absolute\nhorizontal distance between the geometric center of the frame and the geometric center\nof the pair of objects, as calculated by the average horizontal position of the centers of the\nsmallest rectangles that completely contained each object of the pair. This measure is zero\npixels if the image is balanced (ie, if the centers of the two objects are equally distant from\nthe center of the frame in opposite directions) and maximal (500 pixels) if both objects are\nnext to the frame's edge on the same side.(2) Figure 3a shows a plot of the results for related\n(2) We recognize that various other factors have been shown to influence the perceived balance point of\na picture--eg, the color, orientation, size, and shape (see the references cited in the introduction)--but\ndecided on the purely geometric measure as the simpler and more objective index.

Here, again, a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 repeated-measures\nanalysis of variance was used with most/least preferred position, relatedness and the position\nof the fixed objects as within participants' factors and Imbalance as dependent variable.\nThere is no difference in Imbalance between the most and least preferred placements of\nthe movable objects when they are related, F(1, 17) = 2.06, p = .169, and also no interaction\nwith the position of the fixed object, F(4, 68) = 1.78, p = .143. When the fixed object was in\nthe most lateral positions, the most preferred placements of related objects were actually\nmore imbalanced than the least preferred placements. This makes it unlikely that balance\nwas itself the primary factor influencing people's placements of the related objects. For\nunrelated objects, however, the most preferred placements were reliably more balanced\nwas also an interaction between most and least preferred placements as a function of the\nfixed object produced larger differences in imbalance than did the center positions. We note,\nhowever, that the imbalance results could also be explained by a bias toward people placing\nunrelated objects far apart. That is, when the fixed object is at extreme positions, placing the\nmovable object at the most distant possible position (on the other side of the center of the\nframe) would have also created a relatively balanced composition for essentially spurious\nreasons. We return to this issue in Experiments 3 and 5, where the contributions of distance\nand balance are teased apart.\nTo gain a more complete understanding of people's choices when they were asked to\ncreate the most aesthetically pleasing picture, the positions of the centers of the movable\nobject were categorized according to the proportion of trials on which its center fell into\neach of nine equal-sized horizontal bins. A 2 \u00d7 5 repeated-measures analysis of variance was\nused with relatedness and the position of the fixed objects as within-participants' factors and\nthe position of the moveable object as dependent variable. Analyses of these data showed\nthat there was a significant difference between the distribution of positions chosen for the\nmovable object in the related and the unrelated pairs, and that it was different for different\nthat such factors might change the precise values of an imbalance measure, but we doubt they would\nchange them by enough to invalidate the conclusions we reach here.\n32 M H R Leyssen, S Linsen, J Sammartino, S E Palmer\nLeft Right\nCenter\nPosition of xed object\nLeft Right\nCenter\nPosition of xed object\nImbalance (IB) in pixels\nMost\npreferred\nImbalance (IB) in pixels\nLeast\npreferred\nMost\npreferred\nLeast\npreferred\n(a) Related object pairs (b) Unrelated object pairs\nFigure 3.

The data from trials in which\nthe fixed object was located on the right side of the frame were averaged with the data\nfrom symmetric positions in which the fixed object was located on the left side of the frame\nbecause these pairs of functions were almost exact mirror images of each other (F < 1 in both\ncases).\nThe most important and general features of the data plotted in Figure 4 are as follows.\nClearly, the bin containing the fixed object (indicated by vertical gray bars in Figure 4) is\nalmost never chosen as the most preferred location for the movable object. People apparently\ndo not want either related or unrelated objects to overlap, at least in pictures containing just\ntwo objects of this size relative to the frame. This \"separation bias\" can be conceptualized\nmetaphorically as a repulsive force that operates at close distances for all objects independent\nof their relatedness. Equally clear is the fact that the most preferred positions (ie, the global\nmaxima of the histograms) for the related objects are quite close to the fixed object, with\nmaxima in the bins just \u00b12 bins away. Unrelated movable objects, however, are preferred\nmuch farther from the position of the fixed object than those for the related objects. Indeed,\nthe single most frequent placement of an unrelated object is always in the most distant bin\npossible. As the distance between related objects increases, the repulsive force away from\noverlapping positions is eventually counteracted by an \"attractive force\" operating between\nthem, presumably due to their semantic connection. No such attractive force is apparent for\nunrelated objects. We note, however, that for unrelated objects in the extreme and off-center\nfixed-object positions, there is a slightly smaller local maximum in the same bin as the global\nmaximum for related object. This may represent some observers' tendency to treat all object\npairs as related.\nThere is surprisingly little evidence of the importance of balance in these data, if balance\nis conceived as a preference for the movable object to be placed at a position symmetrical\nwith the fixed object in relation to the center of the frame. The only case in which balance is\nrobustly preferred is for the unrelated objects in the extreme fixed-object positions, a case\nAesthetic preference in multiobject pictures 33\nF\nI\nX\nE\nD\nO\nB\nJ\nE\nC\nT\nUnrelated\nRelated\n(a)\nProbability Chosen\nLeft\nRight\nCenter\nPosition of movable object\nF\nI\nX\nE\nD\nO\nB\nJ\nE\nC\nT\nUnrelated\nRelated\n(b)\nProbability Chosen\nLeft\nRight\nRight\nLeft\nCenter\nPosition of movable object\nF\nI\nX\nE\nD\nO\nB\nJ\nE\nC\nT\nUnrelated\nRelated\n(c)\nProbability Chosen\nLeft Right\nCenter\nPosition of movable object\nRight\nLeft\nFigure 4.

The data from trials in which the fixed object was located on the right\nside of the frame were averaged with the data from symmetric positions in which the fixed object was\nlocated on the left side of the frame.\nthat may simply reflect the tendency for people to place an unrelated movable object as far\nas possible from the fixed object. There is some evidence toward balance in the off-center\nconditions with the related objects (Figure 4b), in the sense that when the fixed object is\nhalfway between the center and the most extreme position (ie, at \u00b1250 pixels from the center),\npeople place the related object much more frequently in the center bin than in the most\nextreme bin, thus favoring the more balanced composition at the same distance from the\nfixed object, even though it is not the most balanced overall composition possible. Once\nagain, there are alternative interpretations, however, in that the preferred position is to place\nthe movable object at the center of the frame, which can be interpreted as an example of\nthe center bias, or to place it away from the edge of the frame, which can be interpreted as\narising from a repulsive force due to the frame edge itself. We return to the role of balance in\nExperiments 3 and 5, where its role is examined in greater detail and with better controlled\nconditions.\nFigures 5a\u00adc present histograms of the percentages of trials on which the moveable object\nwas placed in each of the nine positional bins when observers were asked to choose the\nleast aesthetically pleasing position. Analyses of these data show that there is a significant\ndifference between the position of the movable object for the related and the unrelated pairs\ndepending on the position of the fixed object, F(4, 68) = 4.12, p = .005. Although it is true that\npeople find the picture to be least preferred when the related objects are placed far apart and\nthe unrelated objects are placed closer together (ie, opposite to the pattern when choosing\nthe most preferred position; see also Figure 2a versus 2b), the most notable feature of the\ndistributions in Figure 5 is how similar the functions are for related and unrelated objects,\nparticularly in comparison with those for the most aesthetically pleasing positions (Figure 4).\nThis suggests that the least preferred compositions are dominated simply by inappropriate\nplacement of the objects relative to each other and to the frame, largely independent of\nsemantic relatedness. The other noteworthy feature of the data is that the least preferred\ncompositions tend to be those in which the moveable object is placed either in the same\npositional bin as the fixed object or in the bin closest to the far edge of the frame. The former\ncase violates the separation bias (see above) and the latter an edge-repulsion bias, suggesting\nthat these effects are stronger than semantic relatedness.\n34 M H R Leyssen, S Linsen, J Sammartino, S E Palmer\nF\nI\nX\nE\nD\nO\nB\nJ\nE\nC\nT\nUnrelated\nRelated\nUnrelated\nRelated\nUnrelated\nRelated\n(a)\nProbability Chosen\n(b)\nProbability Chosen\n(c)\nProbability Chosen\nLeft\nRight\nCenter\nPosition of movable object\nLeft\nRight\nRight\nLeft\nCenter\nPosition of movable object\nLeft Right\nCenter\nPosition of movable object\nRight\nLeft\nF\nI\nX\nE\nD\nO\nB\nJ\nE\nC\nT\nF\nI\nX\nE\nD\nO\nB\nJ\nE\nC\nT\nFigure 5.

The data from trials in which the fixed object was located on the right\nside of the frame were averaged with the data from symmetric positions in which the fixed object was\nlocated on the left side of the frame.\nThe overall pattern of results indicates that two factors dominate people's preferences for\nspatial compositions involving object pairs. First, both most and least preferred placements\nof the movable object depend strongly on the mere physical separation between two depicted\nobjects, with compositions in which the two objects overlap in essentially the same position\nbeing, in general, least preferred. We call this tendency the \"separation bias.\" The repulsion\nit implies appears to increase as the two objects get closer together. Second, people prefer\nobjects that are related to each other to be closer together in a frame than objects that are\nnot related to each other, with the reverse being true when people are asked to construct the\nleast preferred picture. This relatedness bias may be another instance of an ecological effect\nin the aesthetics of spatial composition (Palmer et al 2012; Sammartino and Palmer no date):\npeople prefer pictures to have a spatial composition in which the distances between objects\nmirror their likely corresponding distances in the environment, with related objects tending\nto be closer together than unrelated objects.\nSomewhat surprisingly, participants seldom put the movable object in a position at which\nthe picture was in balance--by which we mean that the distance from both objects to the\ncenter of the frame was the same or nearly so--as Arnheim's (1983) discussion tends to imply.\nIt is true that previous research has shown color, size, and shape to influence the perception\nare relatively minor, and our images were largely controlled for shape and size effects, since\neach image contained a tall, thin and a short, wide object of approximately the same sizes. It\nis impossible that differences in color could lead to the conclusion that the most preferred\nimages containing the fixed object at the most extreme position (Figure 4a) are balanced\nwhen the movable related object is most often placed at a position that is on the same side as\nthe fixed object and only midway to the frame center. Such an image is hugely unbalanced.\nThese considerations lead us to believe that both the separation and relatedness biases have\nstronger influences on the preferred positions of elements in two-object pictures than does\nbalance. We return to this issue in Experiments 3 and 5.\nAesthetic preference in multiobject pictures 35\nExperiment 2 was carried out to address the question of whether the results of Experiment 1\nmight be due to demand characteristics. That is, it is plausible that participants in Experiment\n1 noticed that some of the object pairs were related and others unrelated, and therefore might\nhave felt that this variable should somehow be reflected in their responses. It does not actually\nexplain why they chose to place related objects closer together and unrelated objects farther\napart, but given the opposite alternative, it is not surprising that this solution might have been\nchosen. To determine the extent to which the relatedness effects in Experiment 1 resulted\nfrom demand characteristics of the within-participants study, participants in Experiment 2\nwere divided into two different groups, one of which saw only related pairs and the other of\nwhich saw only unrelated pairs. If the results are essentially the same as those of Experiment\n1, then the results of Experiments 1 are not due to demand characteristics.\nThirty-six (18 females, 18 males, ages 16\u00ad24) persons who were na\u00efve to the purpose of\nthe experiment participated. Thirty-five participants were students at the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley, who participated as a partial fulfillment of their course requirements.\nOne participant was paid to participate in the experiment. All gave informed consent in\naccord with the policies of the University of California, Berkeley.\nAs in Experiment 1, each picture contained one stationary object, whose position was fixed,\nand one movable object, whose position could be adjusted by the participant to create\nthe most preferred picture. The objects used were again images of a cake, a wine bottle, a\nsponge, and a liquid-soap container (see Figure 1b). The entire design was identical to that\nof Experiment 1, except that subjects were divided into two different groups. One group\nsaw only related pairs (cake and wine bottle, sponge, and liquid-soap container), whereas\nthe other group only saw unrelated pairs (sponge and wine bottle, cake, and liquid-soap\ncontainer). As a result, each participant had to complete only 120 trials.\nThe apparatus and procedure were identical to those of Experiment 1.\n3.2 Results and discussion\nThe overall correlation between the results for the most preferred positions of the two\nexperiments was +.99, indicating that the data in the two experiments for these objects were\nalmost identical. Correlations nearly as high were found when people were asked to create\nthe least preferred pictures (r = +.88). When the results of Experiments 1 and 2 were analyzed\nin a single between-participants design, there was no significant difference between the two\nexperiments, when participants were asked to create either the most preferred picture, F(1,\n17) = 1.73, p = .210, or the least preferred picture (F < 1). These results show that demand\ncharacteristics arising from the same observer seeing both related and unrelated object pairs\nwere not responsible for the compositional effects reported in Experiment 1.\nHistograms of the placements of the movable object when people were asked to place\nthe object in the most and least preferred position were constructed by categorizing them\ninto nine equal-sized bins, as with the corresponding data from Experiment 1. We do not\nshow the graphs because the patterns are almost identical to those shown in Figures 4 and 5.\nIndeed, the correlation between the 180 data points from the two experiments is +.94 (p <\n36 M H R Leyssen, S Linsen, J Sammartino, S E Palmer\n.0001). Clearly, neither the separation bias nor the relatedness bias of Experiment 1 depend\non observers seeing both related and unrelated object pairs.\nThe results of Experiments 1 and 2 suggest that relatedness may be more important than\nbalance when people make aesthetic judgments, at least when they concern simple pictures\ncontaining just two meaningful objects. Observers could have placed the movable object in\nsuch a position that it would have created a balanced picture, but they seldom chose to do so.\nInstead, they generally preferred the related objects to be close together and the unrelated\nobjects to be farther apart, even if this created unbalanced pictures, as indicated by the peaks\nin Figure 4. A possible drawback of Experiments 1 and 2 is that the constraints of the fixed\nobject positions may have made it difficult for observers to create balanced pictures without\nviolating other powerful biases. For example, when the fixed object was positioned in the\ncenter, observers could create a balanced picture only by positioning the other object at the\nsame location, which would violate the powerful separation bias. Moreover, Experiments\n1 and 2 provided no information about people's relative preferences among the five most\npreferred images they created with the same objects.\nIn Experiment 3, we investigated how preference varies as the composition differs in\nsystematic ways that specifically include both balanced and unbalanced compositions\nat a variety of different interobject distances with related and unrelated pairs of objects.\nThe results should be sensitive to both balance and relatedness effects, if they are present.\nWe expected that the most aesthetically pleasing composition would be the one in which\nthe picture is balanced and separated by distances consistent with the relatedness effects\nreported in Experiments 1 and 2.\nSix males and 14 females, aged 18\u00ad38, volunteered to participate for payment. All were na\u00efve\nto the purpose of the experiment and gave informed consent in accord with the policies of\nthe University of California, Berkeley.\nEach trial consisted of 15 framed images containing the same two objects in the same\nleft/right order. The objects within a single frame were located at one of six equally spaced\nlocations in a frame of 350 by 221 pixels. There were three possible equally spaced locations\non the left side of the picture (positioned 24, 72, or 120 pixels to the left of the center of the\nframe, which we will refer to as positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and three corresponding\nlocations on the right side, which were symmetrical to those on the left (positioned 24, 72,\nor 120 pixels to the right of the center of the frame, which we will refer to as positions 4, 5,\nand 6, respectively). The two objects were never positioned at the same location within a\ntrial because the results of Experiments 1 and 2 indicated so clearly that this composition is\nstrongly disliked. Figure 6 shows an example image in which the cake is at position 3 and the\nwine at position 5. Each other location at which the objects could be positioned is indicated\nby an x.\nThe objects used in the experiment were the same as in Experiments 1 and 2 (see\nFigure 1b). The related pairs consisted of one tall, thin object and one short, wide object:\na cake and a bottle of wine, or a sponge and a liquid-soap container. The unrelated pairs\nconsisted of the same objects, but differently paired such that there was also always one tall,\nAesthetic preference in multiobject pictures 37\nFigure 6. Example of a picture in which the cake and the bottle are presented at positions 3 and 5.\nEach other position in which the objects could be located is indicated by an x.\nthin object and one short, wide object: a liquid-soap container and a sponge, or a wine bottle\nand a sponge. The image of each object was slightly adjusted to ensure that they would not\noverlap when they were placed in adjacent locations.\nThe pictures were displayed using Presentation software (http://www.neurobs.com) on the\nsame monitor that was used in Experiments 1 and 2.\nParticipants sat in a small, darkened booth. They were told that, for each trial, 15 framed\nimages containing the same two objects in the same left/right order would be presented\non the screen in four different rows. The three top rows each consisted of four images,\nand the bottom row consisted of three images and a \"Restart Trial\" button at the bottom\nright corner. The positions in which the images were presented on the screen in each trial\nwere randomized, and the eight trials consisting of different combinations of objects were\npresented in a random order.\nParticipants were instructed to use the mouse to click on the image they found most\naesthetically pleasing of all the images on the screen. After each click, the selected image\ndisappeared, and participants then chose the most aesthetically pleasing image from the\nremaining images. They repeated this procedure until there were no images left on the screen.\nThe order in which they clicked the images was recorded with the first one chosen being\nscored as 15 and the last one chosen as 1. If the participant made a mistake and wanted to\nredo the trial, they could press the \"Restart Trial\" button, which initiated the same trial again\nwith all the images being presented in the same positions on the screen as before.\n4.2 Results and discussion\nThe data were averaged over participants to measure preference for each condition. The\nprimary data are plotted in Figure 7 as a function of the location of the rightmost object\n(x-axis) and leftmost object (separate curves) for related objects (Figure 7a) and for unrelated\nobjects (Figure 7b), averaged over specific object pairs and left/right object positions. Note\nthat ranks have been inverted so that more preferred conditions are higher on the y-axis.\n38 M H R Leyssen, S Linsen, J Sammartino, S E Palmer\nPosition of right object\nPosition of\nleft object\nPreference (from rank order)\nPosition of right object\nPreference (from rank order)\n(a) Most aesthetically pleasing (b) Least aesthetically pleasing\nFigure 7. Preference for images in Experiment 3 plotted as a function of the different locations of the\nobjects for (a) related pairs and (b) unrelated pairs. The position of the rightmost object is indicated\non the x-axis, and that of the leftmost object is represented by separate curves.\nThe most obvious feature of the data for related objects (Figure 7a) is that the positions in\nwhich the objects are adjacent (the leftmost data point for each curve) are the most preferred,\nand the functions generally decrease as interobject distance increases (for points farther to\nthe right). This pattern is consistent with the relatedness effects found in Experiments 1 and\n2: people prefer related objects to be close together. The opposite pattern is evident for the\nunrelated objects (Figure 7b), where adjacent positions (again, the leftmost data point for\neach curve) are least preferred, and the functions generally increase monotonically as the\ninterobject distance increases. These distance effects are isolated in Figure 8, which plots\nrelated objects, preference decreases almost linearly with distance, whereas for unrelated\nobjects, it increases almost linearly with distance. Clearly, relatedness matters a great deal in\ncompositional preferences, with related and unrelated objects showing opposite effects of\ndistance.\nInter-object distance\nPreference (from rank order)\nRelated Unrelated\nFigure 8. Preference for images in Experiment 3 for each interobject distance (x-axis) for both related\npairs (solid line) and unrelated pairs (dashed line).\nAesthetic preference in multiobject pictures 39\nThe effects of balance were assessed by the previously described index of imbalance (IB)\nas the distance between the center of the object pair (as calculated by the average horizontal\nposition of the centers of the smallest rectangles that completely contained each object of\nthe pair) and the center of the frame. When the two objects were equidistant from the center\nof the frame and thus maximally balanced at pair positions (1,6), (2,5), and (3,4), the IB was\nzero. The maximally unbalanced cases are those in which the two objects are in adjacent\npositions nearest to the edge of the frame at pair positions (1,2) and (5,6), which have an IB\nof 2.0. Because balance does not vary orthogonally with distance, we carried out a multiple\nlinear regression analysis on the full set of data averaged only over participants and object\ntypes. For related pairs, both distance and IB were included in the equation, accounting\nfor 77.1% of the variance, with distance explaining 73.5% or the variance (p < .001) and IB\naccounting for an additional 3.6% of the variance (p < .05). For unrelated pairs, both factors\nwere also included and together explained 60.8% of the variance, with similar relative levels\nof significance: distance accounted for 54.4% of the variance (p < .001), and IB accounted for\n6.4% (p < .05). Interestingly, the beta weights for IB were essentially identical for related and\nunrelated objects (\u00ad0.224 versus \u00ad0.297), whereas the beta weights for distance were wildly\ndifferent and opposite in sign (\u00ad.975 for related pairs and +.582 for unrelated pairs.) This is\nconsistent with what one would expect if the identity of objects were largely irrelevant for\nbalance but highly relevant for distance.\nA third factor of interest is the possible effect of the spatial envelope of the object pair.\nEach image contained one tall, thin object (bottle of wine or liquid-soap container) and\none short, wide object (cake or sponge). Because both were resting on the same surface,\nthe spatial envelope of the pair roughly defines a right triangle that points either left or\nright. Given the inward bias reported by Palmer et al (2008) for single objects, we wondered\nwhether people might prefer the compositions in which the spatial envelope of the pair\nwas directed into (rather than out of) the frame. Figure 9 plots the data as a function of this\ninward/outward \"pointing\" factor separately for interobject distances of 1, 2, 3, and 4 units.\nIn each case, there is a significant interaction between the pointing direction of the spatial\nof 1, 2, 3 and 4 units, respectively. Clearly, there is an inward bias operating on the spatial\nenvelope in these preference data.\nThe results of Experiment 3 provided further evidence of the importance of semantic\nrelatedness on people's preferences for spatial compositions. They also demonstrated\nsystematic preferences due to the directedness of the object pair's spatial envelope, consistent\nwith an inward bias that operates at the level of configurations of objects as well as for facing\neffects of individual objects (cf Palmer et al 2008). Surprisingly, however, there were only\nweak indications of a preference for balance, which would correspond to a center bias for\nconfigurations.\nExperiment 4 attempted to confirm the existence of a configural inward bias and to\nlook more closely for a balance effect using a sensitive two-alternative forced choice (2AFC)\npreference task. Using such tasks, Palmer et al (2008) regularly found both center and inward\nbias effects for pictures of individual objects, so we reasoned that this method would be most\neffective here. We also thought that the balance effect might not have emerged in Experiment\n3 because it was dominated by relatedness and interobject distance effects. In the present\nexperiment, we therefore used only related object configurations and kept the distances\nbetween the objects fixed and small. Observers had to decide which of two images they\n40 M H R Leyssen, S Linsen, J Sammartino, S E Palmer\nPosition of left object\nPreference (from rank order)\nPosition of left object\nPreference (from rank order)\nPosition of left object\nPreference (from rank order)\nPosition of left object\nPreference (from rank order)\n(a) Distance = 1 (b) Distance = 2\n(c) Distance = 3 (d) Distance = 4\nTall - Short\nTall - Short\nTall - Short\nTall - Short\nShort - Tall Short - Tall\nShort - Tall Short - Tall\nFigure 9.

In right-pointing configurations, the short object was positioned to the right of the tall object,\nand in left-pointing configurations, the short object was positioned to the left of the tall object. These\neffects confirm the presence of an inward bias on the spatial envelope of the object pairs within the\nframe.\npreferred aesthetically when the only variable that differed was the position of the whole\nconfiguration. We reasoned that this task would provide a definitive test of whether people\nprefer multiobject images that are compositionally balanced around the center and whether\nthere is an inward bias in the spatial envelope of the objects. We note that Palmer et al (2008)\nonly demonstrated an inward bias based on the facing direction of individual objects as\ndefined by the fronts of objects rather than on the spatial envelopes of configurations, so an\ninward bias in the present experiment would generalize its nature in an interesting way.\nAll 15 participants were students at the University of California, Berkeley, who received partial\ncourse credit in their undergraduate psychology course. Their mean age was 19.3 years. All\nwere na\u00efve to the purpose and nature of the experiment, and gave informed consent in\naccord with the policies of the University of California, Berkeley.\nAesthetic preference in multiobject pictures 41\nEach trial consisted of two framed images depicting the same configuration of objects whose\nspatial envelope \"pointed\" in the same direction, at two different positions within the frame\nfrom a possible set of five positions. Two different configurations of related objects were\nused: either a configuration consisting of a wine bottle, a wine goblet, and a plate of grapes\n(see Figure 10a) or a ceramic pitcher and a basket of bread cubes (see Figure 10b). There\nwere two different versions of both configurations: one in which the spatial envelope of the\nconfiguration was pointing to the left and one in which it was pointing to the right. These\ndifferent versions were mirror images. Figure 10 shows two example images in which the\nhorizontal component of all possible locations where the center of the configuration could be\nlocated are indicated by \"x\"s. The center of the configuration was defined as the center of the\nsmallest bounding rectangle that included the entire configuration. The wine-goblet\u00adgrapes\nimages had the general appearance of oil paintings, whereas the pitcher\u00adbread images were\nhigh-resolution photographs.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 10. Examples of pictures in which the configuration of a wine bottle, a wine goblet, and a\nplate of grapes is pointing toward the left (a) and in which the configuration of a ceramic pitcher\nand a basket of bread cubes is pointed toward the right (b). Each location in which the center of the\nconfiguration could be located is indicated by an x.\nTrials consisted of all 10 possible pairwise comparisons of the images depicting the same\nconfiguration of objects facing in the same direction at different positions for each of the\ntwo configurations of objects and both of the two possible pointing directions. The left/right\nposition of the 2AFC pairs of images on the screen was counterbalanced within participants,\nand each trial was replicated three times. This resulted in a total of 240 trials.\nThe pictures were displayed using Presentation software (www.neurobs.com) on the same\nmonitor that was used in Experiments 1, 2, and 3.\nParticipants were instructed to choose the image they found most aesthetically pleasing on\neach trial by clicking the right mouse button for the right image and the left mouse button\nfor the left image. Which mouse button they pressed was recorded. Participants were given\nthe opportunity to take a break every 60 trials.\n5.2 Results and discussion\nWe scored participants' responses for the probability with which they chose each image\nin each of the 2AFC pairs of images for each object configuration. To create a composite\n42 M H R Leyssen, S Linsen, J Sammartino, S E Palmer\nmeasure of the aesthetic response to each image, we then computed the average probability\nof choosing that image across all of its pair-wise comparisons. The resulting probabilities,\naveraged over participants and object configurations, are plotted in Figure 11 as a function\nof location within the frame for the right- and left-pointing configurations.\nLeft Right\nCenter\nPosition in the frame\nProbability Chosen\nRight-\npointing\nLeft-\npointing\nFigure 11. Proportion of trials in which the image of right-pointing and left-pointing configurations\nwas chosen in Experiment 4 as a function of the position of the configuration in the frame.\nThere was an overall main effect of position, indicating that participants preferred the\nconfiguration more in central locations than in ones closer to the edges of the frame, F(4, 56)\n= 8.66, p < .001. This preference for central positions is the clearest evidence we have obtained\nfavoring balance in the present research on composition of multiobject compositions.\nNevertheless, it is systematically modulated by the pointing direction of the configuration, as\nevidenced by the interaction between positions and pointing direction, F(4, 56) = 4.16, p < .01.\nThe nature of this interaction is consistent with that reported in Experiment 3: people prefer\nright-pointing configurations to be located farther to the left in the frame and left-pointing\nconfigurations to be located farther to the right in the frame. The net result is that, overall,\nconfigurations are preferred when they point into (rather than out of) the frame. No reliable\ninteractions were present between either of these effects and the two object configurations,\nThe results of this experiment thus clearly provide evidence of a center bias in images\nof multiobject configurations, which is essentially a bias toward balance. There are many\nreasons why balance might have been detected in the present experiment when it was not in\nthe previous three experiments. The most plausible one is that, in Experiment 4, interobject\ndistance and relatedness did not vary across the images participants had to compare. This\nfact may have allowed balance effects to emerge here, whereas they may have been swamped\nby other effects in the previous experiments.\nExperiments 1, 2, and 3 studied the same set of stimuli: two short, wide objects (a sponge\nand a cake) and two tall, thin objects (a plastic container of liquid dish soap and a bottle\nof sparkling wine). Are the results of these experiments due to using these specific objects\nand/or object shapes or are they more general than that? The final experiment answered\nAesthetic preference in multiobject pictures 43\nthis question by studying different objects of different shapes that can be found in different\nenvironments.\nExperiment 5 was carried out as a maximally sensitive 2AFC experiment in which\nparticipants had to indicate which of two pictures they preferred. Only the key contrast\ncomparisons were included: two pictures with the same degree of balance that differed\nonly in the interobject distance and two pictures with equal distances between objects that\ndiffered only in balance. The results should thus be sensitive to both balance and relatedness\neffects, if they are present.\nWe expected to replicate the previous findings with these new objects. Most importantly,\nwe expected participants to prefer the pictures in which related objects were closer together,\nbut to prefer pictures in which unrelated objects were positioned farther apart. For the\ntrials comparing two pictures that have the same interobject distance but vary in the degree\nof balance, we expected participants to prefer the balanced pictures over the unbalanced\npictures for both the related and unrelated object pairs, because in these trials there was no\nconflict between balance and the relatedness effects, given that the distance between the\nobjects was the same.\nThere were 20 participants (9 females, 11 males, ages 18\u00ad24 years) in this experiment. Seven-\nteen participants were students who received partial course credit in their undergraduate\npsychology course at the University of California, Berkeley. The other participants were paid\nfor their participation. All were na\u00efve to the purpose and nature of the experiment, and gave\ninformed consent in accord with the policies of the University of California, Berkeley.\nEach trial consisted of two framed images containing the same two objects in the same\nleft/right order. The objects within a single frame were located at one of six equally spaced\nlocations in a frame of 680 by 430 pixels. There were three possible equally spaced locations\non the left side of the picture (positioned 45, 135, or 225 pixels to the left of the center of the\nframe, which we will refer to as positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and three corresponding\nlocations on the right side, which were symmetrical to those on the left (positioned 45, 135,\nor 225 pixels to the right of the center of the frame, which we will refer to as positions 4, 5,\nand 6, respectively).\nFor each pair of objects, there were seven different compositions in which the two\nobjects were positioned in different locations. There were two different pictures in which the\nmidpoint between the two objects was located to the left side of the center (which we call\n\"left-unbalanced\"), including pictures with objects at positions 2 and 3, and pictures with\nobjects at positions 1 and 4. Likewise, there were also two \"right-unbalanced\" pictures in\nwhich the midpoint between the two objects was located right of center, located at positions\n4 and 5, and positions 3 and 6. In addition, there were three balanced pictures, in which both\nobjects were equidistant from the center on opposite sides, including pictures with objects\nat positions 3 and 4, positions 2 and 5, and positions 1 and 6. The distance between the\nobjects in all of these pictures was equal to 1, 3, or 5 spatial units (of 90 pixels each). Figure 12\npresents an overview of all the different locations in which the objects could be positioned\nfor each pair of objects using the unrelated pair of a block of cheese and an American football\nhelmet.\nThere were five kinds of trials designed to assess distance effects (distance-based\ncomparisons): one in which left-unbalanced pictures were compared to each other at\n44 M H R Leyssen, S Linsen, J Sammartino, S E Palmer\nC\nLeft unbalanced\nBalanced\nRight unbalanced\nDistance between the objects\nFigure 12.

Four other kinds of trials were designed to assess balance effects in which the balanced\npictures were compared to the left-unbalanced and right-unbalanced pictures (balance-\nbased comparisons): two in which the distance between the objects was one unit (A vs C and\nC vs F) and two in which it was three units (B vs D and D vs G).\nThe objects used in the experiment were different from those used in Experiments 1, 2 and\n3, but were analogously structured into quartets of objects that produced well-controlled sets\nof related and unrelated objects. There were four quartets, each of which could be combined\ninto four different pairs of objects: two related pairs and two unrelated pairs. The left/right\npresentation of these different pairings was counterbalanced within participants, resulting\nin eight different pairings for each quartet. The quartets (see Figure 13) consisted of (a) a\npair of shoes, a pair of slippers, a paint roller, and a paint can; (b) a hammer, a wrench,\na wire whisk, and a spatula; (c) a loaf of bread, a block of cheese, an American football,\nand a football helmet; and (d) a salt shaker, a pepper grinder, a wallet, and a keychain. The\nleft/right position of the 2AFC pairs of images on the screen was counterbalanced between\nparticipants. This resulted in a total of 288 trials for each participant.\nThe pictures were displayed using Presentation software (http://www.neurobs.com) on the\nsame monitor that was used in the previous experiments.\nParticipants sat in a small, darkened booth. On each trial, two framed images containing the\nsame two objects in the same left/right order were presented on the screen. Participants were\nAesthetic preference in multiobject pictures 45\nFigure 13.

If they preferred\nthe image on the left side of the screen, they were instructed to press the left arrow key, and if\nthey preferred the image on the right, they were instructed to press the right arrow key. They\nhad to wait at least 2 s before they could make a response.\n6.2 Results and discussion\nAs in the previous experiments, we wanted to insure that our assessment of the relatedness\nof the objects was accurate. Therefore, we carried out a short questionnaire study with 12\nadditional participants. We presented a paper sheet with the images of the object pairs that\nwere presented in the experiment, and participants were asked to indicate how related the\ndifferent pairs were on a scale ranging from 1 (not related at all) to 7 (very much related). In\nthe questionnaire, we presented images of the objects, rather than their names, to be sure\nthat the participants knew the visual appearance of the particular objects. The order in which\nthe pairs were presented was randomized. The average rating for the related pairs (6.25) was\nagain, conclude that participants agreed with us about the relatedness of the object pairs\nwithin the quartets.\nThe distance-based and balance-based comparisons were analyzed separately. In\ndistance-based comparisons, the interobject distance differed (1, 3, or 5 distance units),\nwhereas the balance of the pictures was the same (as defined by the average of their center\npoints), being either both balanced or both unbalanced with the center of the object pair\nbeing located at the same point. In the balance-based comparisons, the balance of the two\npictured differed (balanced vs. unbalanced), whereas the distance between the objects was\nthe same.\n46 M H R Leyssen, S Linsen, J Sammartino, S E Palmer\nFor the distance-based trails, we scored participants' responses for the probability with\nwhich they preferred the picture with the smaller distance between the objects. The resulting\nprobabilities, averaged over participants, for the related and unrelated object pairs are plotted\nin Figure 14a. When the objects in an image were related, participants chose the picture with\nthe smaller interobject distance much more often than expected by chance in every case, F(1,\nthe objects were unrelated, participants showed no such preference for the alternative with\nthe smaller interobject distance. Indeed, for quartets A and C, participants reliably preferred\nwere much more likely to choose the picture with the smaller interobject distance when the\nis clearly consistent with the relatedness bias reported in Experiments 1, 2, and 3.

For these trials, we scored\nparticipants' responses for the probability with which they chose the picture in which the\nobjects were balanced (ie, positioned at the same distance from the center on opposite\nsides) over the unbalanced picture. The resulting probabilities, averaged over participants,\nfor the related and unrelated pairs are plotted in Figure 14b. Participants did not prefer the\npictures that showed balance over those that were unbalanced more often than expected by\nchance for any quartet, F(1, 19) < 1 for all quartets. There was no significant difference in\nthe preference for balance between the related and the unrelated objects, F(1, 19) = 1.18, p =\n.290, and also no difference between the left/right order of the objects in the picture, F(1, 19)\nThe results obtained from this experiment are thus consistent with the results of\nExperiments 1, 2, and 3 in the sense that we again found strong evidence for objects to\nbe preferred closer together when they are related than when they are unrelated. Moreover,\nthis was robustly true for all four object quartets in Experiment 5 as well as for the quartet\nused in Experiments 1, 2, and 3. Because the present objects had different shapes than those\nin Experiments 1, 2, and 3 yet showed the same pattern of distance-dependent preferences, it\nis unlikely that the precise shape and/or size of the objects was responsible for the previous\nAesthetic preference in multiobject pictures 47\nfindings. Once again, however, we failed to find robust evidence of a preference for balanced\nover unbalanced pictures for either related or unrelated objects.\n7 General discussion\nThe results of the five experiments reported above have shed considerable light on people's\naesthetic preferences for spatial compositions of images that contain more than one\nmeaningful object. Perhaps the most significant insight is the robust importance of the\ndistance between two objects and how its effect depends on the semantic relatedness of\nthe objects. From the results of the experiments reported here, it can be concluded that\npeople tend not to like two-object images in which the two objects are very close together,\nregardless of their semantic relatedness. This \"separation bias\" may seem surprising, given\nthat most still-life paintings depict objects that are tightly grouped and even overlapping.\nOne relevant factor is that the objects of still-life paintings are typically very closely related to\neach other, such as a bowl containing apples, pears, and other fruit. Another factor is that the\nseparation bias may depend importantly on other features that were not manipulated in our\nexperiments, such as the number of objects in the picture and the size of the objects relative\nto the frame. Still-life paintings of the sort seen in museums and galleries, for example, tend\nto depict numerous related objects that together fill the frame much more densely than in\nthe pictures we have studied, which were severely constrained in the number (ie, two) and\nsizes of the objects (ie, small) relative to the frame. It seems likely that even a painting of\njust two objects would tend to be composed with them positioned very close together or\noverlapping if they were large relative to the frame and/or if the occlusion of one by the other\nproduces interesting shadows and partly occluded shapes that would not have been present\nif they had been separated.\nThe data further indicate very clearly that, beyond some minimum distance, people like\nrelated objects to be relatively close together, but unrelated objects to be relatively far apart.\nThis relatedness bias was robustly present in the results of every experiment in which the\ninterobject distance was varied (Experiments 1, 2, 3, and 5). The results of the fifth experiment\nenable us to generalize this finding beyond the objects studied in Experiments 1, 2, and 3,\nalthough we have not yet tested any scenes composed of quartets of large-scale outdoor\nobjects. We have no reason to believe that they would produce a different pattern of results,\nhowever.\nA third important finding is the existence of an inward bias for configurations whose\nspatial envelope points to the left or right, as in a series of objects that decrease regularly in\nheight (Experiments 3 and 4). People generally prefer compositions in which this envelope\npoints into (rather than out of) the frame, analogous to their preference for a single object\nto face into (rather than out of) the frame (Palmer et al 2008). It is not exactly clear why\nthis inward bias exists for size gradients of objects. Artists frequently talk about structuring\na composition so that it \"leads the eye into the frame,\" and the inward bias we found for\nobject-size gradients might be related to this practice. Another possibility is that people\nmight prefer larger objects to be more peripheral than smaller objects to counteract the\ndecease in visual acuity that occurs with eccentricity when they fixate on the center of the\nframe. Further research will be required to understand the reason for this bias, but even so, it\nis noteworthy that it is generally opposed to a bias toward gravitational balance. The center\nof \"visual weight\" for a pair of objects would actually be closer to the center of the frame if the\nlarger object were closer to the center rather than farther from the center, as we find in our\ndata. We therefore infer that the inward bias arises from factors other than those responsible\nfor preferring balance.\n48 M H R Leyssen, S Linsen, J Sammartino, S E Palmer\nIn some ways, the most surprising result is the difficulty we had in finding any clear\nevidence of a preference for balance, which is the aspect of spatial composition that has\nWilson and Chatterjee, 2005; Gershoni and Hochstein 2011). It was only when we used a fixed\nconfiguration of objects that varied solely in left\u00adright position within the frame (Experiment\n4) that clear evidence of a center bias consistent with balance was evident, and even here it\nwas modulated by an inward configural bias that opposes \"gravitational\" balance. In general,\nit appears that balance is a much less important factor in spatial composition than interobject\ndistance and semantic relatedness, both of which had robust effects in every experiment.\nIndeed, in Experiments 3 and 5, where distance and balance variables could be directly\ncompared, the results showed that interobject distance was far more salient and influential\nthan balance. In Experiment 5, for example, participants frequently had to choose between\na balanced and an unbalanced picture that had the same interobject distance, such that\nbalance was the only relevant relational factor that was different between the two pictures.\nThe fact that participants did not exhibit a preference for the balanced picture in these\ncomparisons is a clear indication that balance is less important than generally believed, at\nleast in the kind of pictures we have studied here. It is again important to point out that the\ndefinition we used for balance is a purely geometric measure, without taking into account\nthe color, orientation, size, and shape of the objects. We acknowledge that such factors might\nchange the precise values of an imbalance measure, but we doubt they would change them\nsufficiently enough to invalidate the conclusions we reach here. It is noteworthy that most\nprevious studies of balance have not actually assessed the importance of balance in aesthetic\npreference, but rather how perceivers judge balance when that is the task they are given. It\nappears to be generally assumed that balance is important for aesthetic judgment, perhaps\ndue in large part to the influential writings of Arnheim (1983), without well-controlled studies\nof its actual impact, which we find to be minimal.\nThe results of the foregoing experiments provide significant insight into the factors\nthat influence people's aesthetic response to the spatial composition of simple images\nconsisting of two or three objects. Similar studies of single-object images showed that the\nprimary variables influencing aesthetic response were those that related the object to the\nsurrounding frame (Palmer et al 2008; Sammartino and Palmer no date). Perhaps the single\nmost important take-home message of the present studies is that in images containing two\nor more objects, the relations between the objects (eg, interobject distance and semantic\nrelatedness) matter more than their individual or even their collective relations to the frame\n(eg, balance and inward direction of configural pointing). Much work remains to be done,\nhowever, in specifying the precise nature of the spatial and semantic relations that influence\naesthetic preference. Most of the present experiments simplified the problem by using two\nsymmetrical objects, for example. What compositions might be favored if the two objects\nhad a facing direction, such that they could face in the same direction, toward each other, or\naway from each other? And what would happen if the spatial relations among three or more\nindependently variable objects were assessed? We are currently studying these and related\nquestions, which we hope to report in subsequent articles.\n"
