    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis research examines how the media report on sentences given to those who commit serious\ncrimes against children and how this impacts on public knowledge and attitudes. Three months\nof press and television coverage were analysed in order to establish the editorial lines that are\ntaken in different sections of the media and how they are promoted by selective reporting of\nsentencing. Results indicate that a small number of very high profile crimes account for a significant\nproportion of reporting in this area and often, particularly in the tabloid press, important\ninformation regarding sentencing rationale is sidelined in favour of moral condemnation and\ncriticism of the judiciary. Polling data indicate that public attitudes are highly critical of sentencing\nbut also confused about the meaning of tariffs. The article concludes by discussing what can be\ndone to promote a more informed public debate over penal policy in this area.\n",

In order to\naddress these issues, we have analysed both media reporting and public views on sen-\ntencing policy. The importance of this research is that it demonstrates how the mass\nmedia, and in particular the tabloid press, can promote specific ways of understanding\nsentencing policy and the appropriateness of sentences given to offenders. Politicians\nmay then respond to these perceived climates of opinion or may attempt to harness them\nfor electoral advantage. However, this can create a situation where criminal policy is\ninfluenced by what plays well with particular sections of the media, rather than being\nbased on rigorous research evidence.\nWe will initially review the research literature on public attitudes towards sentencing\nand the influence of the mass media in this area. We will then examine data which sug-\ngest that since the mid-1990s, sentencing policy has moved in a punitive direction as\npoliticians have substituted evidence-based policy for measures orientated towards\nmedia-driven climates of opinion. We will focus specifically on high profile crimes\nagainst children and will address three analytical research questions:\n\u00b7 What are the editorial lines that are being taken in media accounts of these crimes?\n\u00b7 How are these promoted by selective reporting of particular crimes and types of\nsentences?\n\u00b7 What is the impact of this reporting on public understanding and attitudes?\nThe Existing Debate\nA body of research conducted over decades has found that most people see the sen-\ntences handed down by judges as being too lenient (see Cullen et al., 2000; Roberts,\n1992). However research also suggests that public perceptions of sentencing leniency\nmay be a function of both widespread ignorance and misconceptions concerning the\noperation of the judicial system. Studies have consistently pointed to low levels of\npublic knowledge in relation to the criminal justice system. In a MORI (2003) poll\n49 per cent of respondents admitted that they knew `not very much', `hardly anything'\nor `nothing at all' about the court system in Britain. Most people also have little knowl-\nedge about sentencing guidelines, maximum penalties or the range of punishments that\ncourts can impose (Hough, 1996). Public ignorance and confusion over sentencing may\nbe partly a consequence of the complexity of the legal system. However distortions in\npublic perceptions are not random but instead follow a particular pattern in that respond-\nents consistently underestimate the punitiveness of the sentencing system. Public esti-\nmates of imprisonment rates for various offences are significantly lower than actual\nrates (Doob and Roberts, 1983; Hough and Roberts, 1999; Mattinson and Mirrelees-\nBlack, 2000). Furthermore the public tends to underestimate the lengths of sentences\nthat courts hand down for specific crimes (Hough and Roberts, 1998; Paulin et al.,\n2003) and to assume that most of a sentence will be spent in the community without real\nResearch in this area also suggests that perceptions of sentencing leniency may be an\nartefact of the survey method used in public opinion polls. North American studies have\nfound that attempting to gauge public attitudes using general poll questions may be\nproblematic for three reasons (Brillon et al., 1984; Doob and Roberts, 1988; Roberts and\nStalans, 1997; Sprott, 1996). First, there is evidence people responding to general poll\nquestions tend to answer punitively because they have the worst offenders in mind.\nSecond, when judging sentencing policy, respondents tend to recall unusually lenient\nsentences that are heavily reported in the media. Third, respondents typically do not\nconsider the full range of sentencing options available to courts. These arguments were\nsupported in a British study where participants were asked to attach sentences to an\noffender in a specific burglary case (Hough and Roberts, 1999). In the study the respond-\nents were given background information to the offence which was available to the court\nbut which is usually absent from media accounts. The research found that ordinary\nmembers of the public were no more punitive than the courts would have been in a\nsimilar situation.\nAll of this research evidence points to the key role of the mass media in influencing public\nknowledge and attitudes. Hough and Roberts (1999: 23) argue that the media, and in particu-\nlar the tabloid press, exert influence through the selection and framing of stories and the\nstrong criticism of instances where allegedly lenient punishments have been handed down:\nPeople do not receive balanced information about sentencing practices in the news media, but\nrather a steady stream of stories about sentencing malpractices, cases in which a judge imposes\nwhat appears to be a very lenient sentence for a serious crime of violence. Quantitative analysis\nof press coverage does not actually suggest that newspapers are more likely to cover stories\nabout court cases if the sentence is a light one; however, when lenient sentences are passed, the\nattention given to them, and the editorial comment on them, tend to be shrill. In such cases, the\nnews media rarely make any attempts to explain the judicial reasoning underlying the decision,\nor to place the sentence imposed in some statistical context.\nOthers researchers point to the significance of the volume of crime reporting and how\nthis may influence opinion. Roberts et al. (2002) argue that the way that the media\nfeature crime, and particularly serious violent crime, makes it appear more prevalent\nthan it is in reality and that this is mirrored in public overestimations both of the preva-\nlence of this kind of crime and their chances of victimization. Others suggest the news\nmedia's tendency to frame crime episodically as discrete individual actions, as opposed\nto arising out of wider social processes, may engender individualistic attitudes towards\ncrime control which focus primarily on punitive sanctions against offenders (Iyengar,\n1991). These effects may be reinforced by the presentation of crime in television reality\nshows (Roberts et al., 2002) and fictional representations such as crime dramas (Beckett\nand Sasson, 2000; Fabianic, 1997) both of which tend to present a robust policing\nsolution to the problem of crime. Research evidence which directly links use of media\nto attitudes about crime and sentencing is relatively scarce and since much of it is cor-\nrelational it suffers from the problem of trying to establish directionality. However,\nIndemaur and Roberts (2005: 61) note that `generally an association can be observed\nbetween a shallow or limited perception of crime trends, use of commercial, broadcast or\ntabloid media and increased punitiveness' though `whether or not all these variables are\nin turn related to another more relevant variable such as education level, socio-economic\nstatus or even intelligence is yet to be established'.\nThe research evidence therefore suggests that public opinion is more complicated\nthan the consistently punitive picture which emerges from decades of raw opinion polls.\nWhen presented with information available to judges or jurors, public opinion appears no\nmore punitive than sentencers. Part of the reason why public opinion appears so punitive\nin polls is that it rests on ignorance and misunderstanding about the operation of the\ncriminal justice system. This low and distorted level of public knowledge is closely\nrelated to the reporting of crime, particularly in the tabloid press, where little context and\nmuch negative editorial comment is attached to sentencing decisions.\nHowever, despite the evidence that raw opinion data is an unreliable barometer\nof public opinion, there is evidence that it have increasingly become influential in set-\nting policy debates. This trend which has been dubbed `penal populism' has seen politi-\ncians substitute evidence-based policy for measures designed to satisfy the supposed\npublic desire for harsher penalties (Garland, 2001; Hough and Roberts, 1999; Pratt et al.,\n2005; Roberts et al., 2002). Part of the rationale for this has been that it would restore\npublic confidence in the judicial system (Henham, 1997). Roberts et al. (2002) trace the\nbeginning of this shift in England and Wales to the appointment of Michael Howard as\nHome Secretary in 1993 and his imposition of the `prison works' programme. Howard\n`successfully mined a broad seam of public opinion that supported harsher sentencing'\nand increased the prison population by 50 per cent in four years (Roberts et al., 2002:\n46). Part of the reason for the Conservative Party's decision to move penal policy in a\nmore authoritarian direction was that it felt it had to compete with a Labour Party which\nwas attempting to establish itself as being the party toughest on crime. As Green (2006:\n138) notes Labour `did this in part by fitting its rhetoric to tabloid sensibilities'. Tony\nBlair hired Alastair Campbell, the former political editor of the Daily Mirror. Campbell\nhad stated that:\nwe focus on the newspapers. They don't like to acknowledge that the papers that really matter\nare the tabloids. I think one of the reasons Tony asked me to work for him, and why I wanted\nto work for Tony, was that we both acknowledge the significance to the political debate of the\nHowever, a number of commentators have suggested that the shift to a more authori-\ntarian penal stance by both parties was also influenced by a climate of opinion fostered\nby the press over a very high profile child killing (Green, 2006; Littlechild, 1997;\nboys, John Venables and Robert Thompson, kidnapped and murdered two-year-old\nJamie Bulger. The press response to the crime was unprecedented. Across all national\nnewspapers, a total of 3765 inches of editorial copy were devoted to discussion of the\nstory (Franklin and Petley, 1996). The tabloid press, in particular were vitriolic in their\ncondemnation of Venables and Thompson and demanded a more punitive approach to\ncriminal justice policy:\nThe press corp was indeed in a vengeful mood. Editorials expressed outrage, demanded\nretribution and offered a range of policy proposals designed to exact increasingly punitive\nmeasures from the criminal justice system. The `demonising' of Thompson and Venables was\nso relentless in the British press that one observer was prompted to describe it as, `the kind of\noutbreak of moral condemnation that is usually reserved for the enemy in times of war'.\nThe intense media focus coincided with significant public disorder. Angry mobs\ndrove the families of Venables and Thompson from their homes and they had to be re-\nhoused for their own protection. Following the decision to set a minimum tariff of eight\nyears in custody for the two boys, sections of the tabloid press began a campaign to try\nand increase their sentence to a full life term. The Sun asked its readers to fill in a coupon\nwhich read `Dear Home Secretary I agree with Ralph and Denise Bulger that the boys\nwho killed their son James should stay in jail for LIFE' (Reg. v. Secretary of State for the\ncall T.V. to say Bulger killers must rot in jail' (Reg. v. Secretary of State for the Home\nDepartment, 1997\u00ad1998). These are examples of what are termed `informally solicited\npolls' or SLOPs (`self-selected listener opinion polls'). Despite the fact that such polls\nproduced non-generalizable statistically invalid polls, `once they are broadcast' Fiskin\n`become representations of public opinion that are communicated to candidates, com-\nmentators and citizens alike'. This appears to have happened in the Jamie Bulger case.\nHome Secretary Michael Howard citing `public concern' increased the minimum tariff\nSimilar pressures were evident in the wake of another child killing in July 2000.\nFollowing the sexual assault and murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne, the News of\nWorld was at the forefront of a campaign to `name and shame' convicted paedophiles,\nstiffen sentences and introduce notification legislation, dubbed `Sarah's Law'.3 This\ncampaign mobilized support from certain senior justice professionals and members of\nthe Conservative party. However it also appeared again to contribute to significant\ninstances of public disorder as well as vigilante attacks on paedophiles and suspected\npaedophiles. Eventually the News of the World suspended its campaign of naming\nconvicted paedophiles on the condition that the Government review the notification\nlegislation \u00ad which it was in fact already doing. Roberts et al. (2002) argue that this\ntabloid campaign created a very difficult environment for policymakers. Despite the\nconsensus among `informed opinion' being that the British registration arrangements\nwere `at least as effective as those introduced under Megan's and related US initiatives'\nthe Government came under tremendous pressure to change policy (2002: 51). On this\noccasion it stood firm against a change in the legislation but `without doubt the [News\nof the World] campaign has served to compound public frustration about the criminal\njustice system and has simultaneously constrained politician's ability to locate strate-\ngies that genuinely minimise the risk of predatory paedophile crime' (2002: 51). In\nthe years following Sarah Payne's murder, the tabloid press has continued to press\nfor the introduction of `Sarah's law'. The response from policymakers has been to\ntighten the web of civil measures designed to monitor offenders (Thomas, 2005). These\nhave involved changes to the rules governing the operation of the sex offenders' regis-\nter such as reducing the time that offenders are given to notify police stations of their\npresence, more power for police to fingerprint, photograph and take iris scans of\noffenders, and sharply increased custodial sentences for non-compliance with a range\nof new restriction orders issued by courts (Thomas, 2005). Eventually however, the\nGovernment bowed to media pressure and in September 2008 moved to pilot a notifi-\ncation system in four areas of England. In August 2010 it was announced that the\nscheme would be implemented across England and Wales in March 2011 (Guardian, 1\nAugust 2010). This move drew criticism from the NSPCC who expressed concern that\nmedia attention and fear of subsequent vigilante attacks may drive released offenders\nunderground so that they cannot be monitored and absent themselves from treatment\nThe research evidence in this review suggests that in the area of serious crimes against\nchildren the media, and in particular the tabloid press, can create climates of opinion\nwhich can constrain politicians' ability to locate and implement appropriate criminal\njustice policy. Instead politicians may be pressured to enact policies which placate sec-\ntions of the media, rather than ones which research evidence suggest are actually likely\nto be effective. Our own research investigates the existence of such processes by examin-\ning the editorial content of key sections of the media and the reporting of particular\ncrimes and sentences. We also examine possible impacts on attitudes and understandings\namong different sections of the public.\nSample and Method\nThe sample consists of coverage in nine newspapers from 1 January to 31 March 2010.\nThese were the broadsheets The Times, the Guardian and the Daily Telegraph, three\ntabloids, the Daily Mail, the Sun and the Daily Mirror, and three regional papers, the\nBelfast Telegraph, the Scotsman and the Western Mail. We also included the regional\neditions of all national newspapers except the Guardian. We selected the tabloids and\nbroadsheets on the basis that they have the largest circulations in their segments of the\npress. The regionals were chosen on the basis that they had substantial readerships in\nthe three devolved areas of the UK (Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales). The three-\nmonth sample period was selected on the basis that this would provide a sufficiently\nlarge selection of newspaper articles to be representative of reporting in this area.\nThe sample was supplemented by the main news on BBC One, since this has a very\nwide national viewing audience and is the news source most trusted by the public\n(Barnett, 2008). For television news, we recorded all the BBC One 10 o'clock news\nprogrammes from the period of the sample and retrieved relevant items. For the news-\npaper sample, articles were identified using the Nexis facility which provided elec-\ntronic copies through the use of key words. Since we were primarily interested in cases\nin which a particular sentence was mentioned we used a series of 29 search items which\nhad to co-occur with either the keywords sentence, sentenced, jailed or prison. The\nsearch items were murder, murdered, assault, assaulting, assaulted, murdering, killed,\nkilling, manslaughter, abused, abandoned, sexual abuse, sexually abused, sexually\nabusing, paedophile, pornography, pornographic, porn, grooming, groomed, groom,\nincest, trafficking, trafficked, raped, raping, rape, neglect and child cruelty.\nOnly articles which contained mention of a sentence for the crime that was reported\nwere included in the sample. This identified a total of 4747 articles. We ran a further\nthree-month search to check the sample we had selected had not been skewed by the\npresence of unusually high profile crimes. The searches for the same three-month period\nin 2009 returned 4725 articles thus confirming that our sample was not atypical. The\nsample was then refined in new searches to identify those which specifically fitted the\ncrime categories for this analysis. These were killings, sexual offences against children,\nphysical abuse and neglect. These categories were chosen not because they correspond\nexactly to legal definitions, but because they represent broadly the descriptions which are\ntypically offered in media accounts. We excluded some other types of incident such as\nchild-on-child injuries or killings, as well as gang or knife crime. The central focus was\ntherefore crimes of violence, neglect or sexual abuse by adults against children. This left\na total of 253 articles. Each article was then coded on according to a series of criteria.\nThese were:\n2. Newspaper.\n 3. Unique crime number.\n 4. Offence category (Killing/Sexual Abuse/Viewing Child Pornography/Physical\nAssault/Neglect).\n 5. Total sentence.\n 6. Community sentence (Yes/No).\n 7. Community sentence length specified (Yes/No).\n 8. Community sentence length.\n 9. Probation (Yes/No).\n10. Probation length specified (Yes/No).\n11. Probation length.\n12. Life sentence (Yes/No).\n13. Life sentence minimum length to be served specified (Yes/No).\n14. Life sentence minimum length to be served.\n15. Indeterminate sentence (Yes/No).\n16. Indeterminate sentence minimum length to be served specified (Yes/No).\n17. Indeterminate sentence minimum length to be served.\n18. Suspended sentence (Yes/No).\n19. Relationship between offender and victim (not specified/parent/step-parent or\nparent's partner/other relative/people known \u00ad friends, etc.).\n20. Comment on sentence (Yes/No).\n21. Nature of Comment on sentence (Too short/Too long/Appropriate long/\nAppropriate short).\n22. Who was comment from (Victim's relative/expert/judge/prosecution/defence/\nvictim/offender's relative/editorial/comment piece/letter writer/vox pop/\noffender/victim's relatives or friends/offender's relatives or friends)\nCategories 19\u00ad22 were then repeated for any further comments by another actor relating\nto the same crime. Then categories 4\u00ad22 were repeated for any subsequent crime reported\nwithin the same newspaper article.\nOnce the coding was completed all data were entered in into SPSS for all statistical\nanalyses. The coding scheme meant that the key unit of analysis is crime incidents\nreported rather than newspaper articles. There are two rationales for this. First, some\nnewspaper articles report on different sentences for multiple perpetrators who were\nconvicted of either the same or different offences. An example from our sample was the\nKyra Ishtaq killing where both the mother and stepfather were reported as being given\nseparate sentences for the killing of the young girl. A second reason for adopting crime\nincidents as the unit of analysis is that newspaper articles sometimes reference different\ncrime incidents and the sentence attached to them within the course of a single article.\nSo an article discussing a contemporary child killing might then move on to discuss a\nsentence handed down for a previous instance or instances of the same crime.\nThe purpose of the content analysis was to provide a broad overview of different\naspects of reporting. However we supplemented the quantitative analysis with an in-\ndepth qualitative analysis where we examined in closer detail the range of meanings,\narguments and explanations offered in news accounts. To do this we employed a type of\nqualitative analysis termed thematic analysis which has been developed and refined over\nmore than three decades by the Glasgow Media Group (1976, 1980) in areas such as\nindustrial news, food scares and risk (Philo, 1999), international development (Philo,\n2011) and the representation of mental illness (Philo, 1996). This method is based on the\nassumption that in any controversial area there are competing ways of explaining events\nor issues. These explanations are linked to particular interests which seek to explain the\nworld in ways that justify their own position. The media are thus conceptualized as a\nspace where different interest groups ideologically compete to try and make sure that\ntheir explanations are dominant and accepted by audiences. For instance, in the 1970s\nsurrounding the problems of the British economy which was widely seen to be falling\nbehind its international competitors. This research demonstrated that while the causes for\nthis malaise were hotly contested, broadcast media chose to ignore some explanations\n(underinvestment and management failings) while prominently featuring and sometimes\ndirectly endorsing others (unions and strike action). In the current study we examined the\nrange of debate that newspapers offered in relation to crime and criminal policy. This\nincluded commentary on the sentences handed out to offenders and prescriptions for\nreducing re-offending and protecting public safety. Our quantitative analysis captured all\narticles, whether they be hard news or comment pieces, which mentioned a crime where\na specific sentence was reported. We chose not to make a clear distinction between\neditorials and hard news because, particularly in the tabloid press, hard news is struc-\ntured in order to pursue the themes that are established by the editorial line of the news-\npaper. Our qualitative analysis also included 21 articles from our sample period which\ndid not appear in our quantitative analysis. These provided commentary on the crimes we\nwere focusing on but did not mention a particular sentence. Our aim here was to capture\nother reporting in our sample period which was likely to influence public attitudes.\nOur audience research consisted of large scale representative polling carried out by\nthe company Yougov in April 2010. Two questions were put to the sample:\n\u00b7 In court cases where people are found guilty of crimes of cruelty, physical or\nsexual abuse or the killing of children do you think that the sentences that are\ngiven in general are: Too long/About right/Too short/Don't know?\n\u00b7 In court cases where people are found guilty of crimes of cruelty, physical or\nsexual abuse or the killing of children, people are sometimes given indeterminate\nsentences. Do you think that these are in general: Too long/Neither/Too short/\nDon't know?\nThe polling was stratified by both newspaper readership and socio-economic status\n(National Readership Survey classification) allowing for an examination of how these\nvariables are related to understanding and attitudes.\nResults\nQuantitative analysis\nOur three-month sample generated a total of 253 separate articles in nine newspapers and\nfour television reports. We were surprised by the extremely low number of television\nreports in this area since research has consistently shown that television is the main\nsource of news for approximately two-thirds of the population (Ofcom, 2007).\nFurthermore within television, the BBC is by far the most popular and trusted news\nsource (Ofcom, 2007). Clearly, in relation to the construction of public knowledge and\nattitudes concerning serious crimes against children, the press is key while BBC national\nnews is likely to have a very marginal role. Only the most high profile crimes such as the\nSoham murders, the Khyra Ishaq killing and the `British Fritzl' case were featured on\nBBC television news. In our press sample, we found that because some articles cited\nmultiple crimes, the total number of references to crimes against children was 271.\nOur sample also picked up the same crime reported over many days and in different\nnewspapers. The total number of unique crimes reported over the three-month period of\nour sample was 120. On average, each individual crime generated just over two articles\nacross newspapers and television news. This measure of unique crimes also allowed for\nan estimation of the significance of very high profile crimes. Our research suggests that\nthese accounted for a substantial share of all newspaper coverage of crimes against\nchildren. The eight most heavily reported crimes (6.7% of unique crimes) accounted for\njust over a third (34.0%) of all newspaper references to crimes against children with the\nthree highest profile offences accounting for 18.8 per cent of all references. A list of the\n10 most reported crimes in order of prominence is given below:\n1. Soham murders \u00ad Ian Huntley, a school caretaker was convicted of two counts of\nmurder for the killing of two 10-year-old schoolgirls, Holly Wells and Jessica\nChapman.\n2. `British Fritzl' \u00ad a 54-year-old businessman was given 25 concurrent life\nsentences for the repeated rape of his two daughters over a 25-year period.\nHe fathered seven surviving children with his daughters.\n3. Khyra Ishaq killing \u00ad a mother and stepfather were convicted of starving to death\nseven-year-old Khyra Ishaq.\n4. Baby `P' murder \u00ad Peter Connelly, a 17-month-old boy died after suffering more\nthan 50 injuries. The boy's mother Tracey Connelly together with her boyfriend\nSteven Barker and his father Jason Owen were convicted of `causing or allowing\nthe death of a child or vulnerable person'. The case was particularly controversial\nbecause the boy had been repeatedly seen by child protection in the months\nleading up to his death.\n5. Mother jailed for forcing son to fake serious illness in order to solicit money \u00ad a\nmother was jailed for three years after falsely claiming for six years that he was\nseverely disabled and suffering from life threatening illnesses. During this period,\nshe fraudulently claimed state benefits and awards from charities.\n6. Teenager jailed for raping nine-year-old girl \u00ad a 17-year-old boy was given an\nindeterminate sentence for committing rape, sexual assault and grievous bodily\nharm on a nine-year-old girl while on bail for raping a 10-year-old girl.\n7. Baby `P' prisoner loses rape appeal \u00ad Steven Barker who was convicted in the\nBaby `P' case, (see no. 4) was reported to have lost his appeal against a further\nconviction for child rape.\n8. Mother and daughter murdered by convicted paedophile \u00ad a former soldier and\nconvicted sex offender was convicted of raping a mother and her 10-year-old\ndaughter.\n9. Convicted paedophile given suspended jail sentence due to obesity \u00ad a church\nelder was given a suspended sentence for indecently assaulting a minor over an\neight-year period. The judge cited his lack of mobility, ulcerated legs and need\nfor frequent dressing as being `wholly exceptional circumstances'.\n10. Girl on trial for throwing banana at home of her sex attacker \u00ad a case against a girl\nwho threw fruit at the home of a man convicted of having underage sex with her\nwas dropped by the prosecution. The original decision to prosecute was heavily\ncriticized by another judge not directly involved with the case.\nThese results suggest that the seriousness of the crime is the key factor affecting the\nlikelihood that an offence will be heavily reported but that other factors such as alleged\njudicial leniency and the unusual nature of some crimes are also significant news values.4\nWhat is also clear is that high profile crimes such as the Baby `P' case and the Soham\nmurders can remain prominent in news coverage long after the trials have concluded. In\nthese cases it was subsequent events such as an attack on Ian Huntley in prison or an\nappeal by a prisoner convicted in the Baby `P' murder which triggered further discus-\nsion of these offences. There is also considerable cross-referencing of past cases in the\nreporting of `new' crimes.\nIn Table 1 we provide details of the proportion of the most serious offences of child\nkilling and sexual abuse which are reported as attracting life or indeterminate sentences.\nThe table also contains information on how frequently the details of minimum tariffs are\nreported.\nThe clearest finding from this analysis is that information about minimum tariffs\nattached to these sentences is less frequently reported in the tabloids than it is in the\nbroadsheet press. There is quantitatively less information about details of the most\nserious sentences reported in this segment of the media. Table 2 provides details of the\naverage sentences for different crimes across the media. There are no obvious patterns\nand this is in line with previous research which has found that the tabloid media overall\ndo not report disproportionately on crimes which have attracted allegedly lenient sen-\ntences (Hough and Roberts, 1999). They will however in some cases focus on `leniency'\nwhen this is perceived to occur.\nIn Table 3 we provide details of the pattern of reported offender profiles across the\nmedia. Tabloids are significantly less likely than broadsheets to provide information\nabout the relationship between victim and offender. As in reporting of minimum terms\nattached to life and indeterminate sentences, there is quantitatively less information\nTable 1.

Where the offender\u00advictim relationship\nis stated, clear patterns can be seen. With regard to child killings the perpetrators are\noverwhelmingly reported as being parents or step-parents across all newspaper catego-\nries. In cases of sexual abuse where a relationship is stated, the perpetrator is rarely\nidentified as a stranger in any newspaper category. Broadsheets are more likely than\ntabloids to identify parents as being perpetrators of sexual abuse but in all types of news-\npaper, the most common perpetrator identified is a person known to the family such as a\nneighbour or a friend. Although it may appear that the most reported sexual threat to\nchildren comes not from `stranger danger' but from the immediate known environment\nof home and neighbourhood, an important qualification should be made in the sense of\nwhat is understood to be a `stranger'. A neighbour might be defined as someone who is\n`known' but some high profile cases have involved killings by neighbours who had a\nprevious and unknown history of sexual assault. It is the unknown part of their history\nwhich defines them in some public debate as being potentially dangerous and has led to\nboth media and public demands for access to such information.\nIn the next set of tables we examine who was reported as commenting on sentences\nand what they actually said about the tariffs. Table 4 gives a breakdown of who was\nreported as commenting across different parts of the media. Across all sections of the\npress criminal justice professionals were the most commonly quoted commentators on\nthe appropriateness of sentencing. Within this category judges were by far the most fre-\nquent contributors, accounting for 59 per cent of all comments from criminal justice\nprofessionals. What is also noticeable is the substantial degree of editorializing in the\ntabloids, and to a lesser extent in the regional press, but which is absent from the\nbroadsheets.\nTable 5 provides details of whether the different groups who made comments on sen-\ntencing expressed approval or disapproval at the sentence handed down. We have pro-\nvided categories which differentiate between comments which express the view that the\nsentence was severe and warranted (appropriate long) and those who argue that the sen-\ntence was short but correct (appropriate short).\nTable 3. Reporting of victim\u00adoffender relationships\nUnspecified\n(%)\nStranger\n(%)\nParents, step-\nparents or\nother relatives\n(%)\nPeople known\n(friends,\nneighbours or\ncarers) (%)\nTotal\nN\nWe found that criminal justice professionals, and in particular judges, were the main\nsource of comment which expressed the view that sentences were appropriate. They\njustified both long- and short-term sentences. There was one exception to this which\ninvolved a case in which the Sun reported that a judge had `hit out' at sentencing guide-\nlines which prevented him from imposing an indefinite sentence on an offender who\nthe judge described as `a very real risk to children' (18 March 2010). Interventions\nfrom politicians and newspapers were always on the basis that sentencing had been too\nlenient. Newspapers reinforced this perception that sentencing was too lenient by using\nvox pops. This could be done in the form of a direct quotation from a member of the\npublic expressing disapproval at a sentencing decision but it could also be achieved\nby citing public anger as in a comment from the Sun that a decision to hand down a\nsuspended sentence to a mother who had been repeatedly convicted for child cruelty\n`sparked outrage' (19 January 2010). Table 6 provides a breakdown of approving/\ndisapproving comments on sentencing by newspaper category. This demonstrates that\nthe tabloid and regional press account for all comments critical of sentences for being\ntoo short. In contrast the broadsheets did not contain a single instance where a com-\nment critical of a specific sentence length was made in a news report, though the Daily\nTelegraph did feature two editorials which made criticisms of sentencing in general.\nIn reports of child killings, we found that almost all the negative comments on sen-\ntencing were attached to very high profile cases. In the tabloids 14 out of the 16 criti-\ncisms of sentencing were concentrated on the `Baby P', Khyra Ishaq or Soham murders.\nFor instance, the life sentence with a minimum term of 40 years given to Ian Huntley was\nTable 4.

A different pattern\narises in the comments tied to cases of sexual abuse. Here we did find that a great deal of\ncritical commentary on sentencing centred around cases where allegedly short sentences\nwere handed out. One case which involved a man who had been given a suspended\nsentence for repeatedly sexually abusing a young girl over several years attracted nearly\nhalf the critical comments on sentencing.\nWhile the central focus of the study was reports where specific sentences were stated\nwe also examined commentaries on sentencing which did not mention a specific\nsentence in a case. We found 21 of these of which 19 involved criticism that sentencing\nwas too short. All but three of these appeared in the tabloid press. Most of the criticism\nwas expressed either in the form of editorial/comment pieces or in letters to the editors,\nthough the tabloid press also featured two critical comments from victim support groups.\nOverall the editorial comments which criticized sentence length tended to be much\nlonger and more emotive than the commentary provided by judges which justified their\nsentencing decisions.\nOur final set of tables list the result of the YouGov polls on public attitudes. Table 7\nshows that 82 per cent of the public believe that sentences given for such crimes against\nchildren are too short. This figure is higher than poll results for perceptions of general\nsentencing leniency in the criminal justice system and reflects the intense public antipa-\nthy towards offences against children. For readers of the five largest tabloids the average\nfigure is 88.6 per cent. For Sun and Daily Mail readers, the figure is 91 per cent.\nBroadsheet readers appear less negative about sentencing policy. For readers of the four\nlargest broadsheets the proportion who thought sentences too short was 67.5 per cent.\nThis average figure however masks significant variations: 85 per cent of Daily Telegraph\nreaders saw sentences as being too lenient while for Guardian readers the figure was 46\nper cent. Socio-economic status is also related to attitudes, with lower socio-economic\ngroups exhibiting more punitive attitudes, though these differences are quite modest in\ncomparison to the variations linked to newspaper consumption.\nThe poll results presented in Table 8 indicate that there is a great deal of public\nconfusion about the `the indeterminate sentence for public protection'5 (IPP). This is a\nrelatively recent tariff, which is frequently employed in cases of serious crimes against\nchildren. Overall, 67 per cent of the population believe these sentences for crimes\nagainst children are too short. There were again significant variations in responses\nbetween readers of tabloids and broadsheets: 75.5 per cent of tabloid readers thought\nTable 6. Proportion of comments on the appropriateness of sentencing by newspaper category\nToo short\n(%)\nToo long\n(%)\nAppropriate\nlong (%)\nAppropriate\nshort (%)\nTotal\nN\nIPP sentences were too short while the average for broadsheet readers was 51 per cent.\nIt was also noticeable that the proportion of `don't knows' for broadsheet readers (20%)\nwas nearly double that of tabloids (11.5%). This may be because tabloids and their\nreaders tend to see the criminal justice system as being `soft' in general and thus feel\nconfident in putting forward an opinion. Alternatively it may be because they have been\ninfluenced by some of the tabloid criticism of indeterminate sentences which we exam-\nine in our qualitative analysis below. It is also clear that socio-economic status is related\nto attitudes with those in higher occupational groups being less likely to see IPP\nsentences as being too short, though again it is clear that this a much weaker predictor\nof attitudes than newspaper consumption.\nThematic Analysis\nIn this section we examine in detail the nature of news accounts and how they may con-\ntribute to public knowledge about sentencing policy and attitudes towards it.

Such intrinsic difficulties are likely to be exacerbated by the manner in\nwhich crimes are reported. Journalists sometimes pack large amounts of detail in a few\ncolumn inches, as for example in this report from The Times, which cites multiple\noffences, dates and sentences relating to the same person:\nIn cases involving very young child complainant witnesses, a delay between the alleged offence\nand the making of an allegation or the hearing of the trial, did not, by itself, automatically\nprevent the evidence of the child from being considered by the jury. The Court of Appeal,\nCriminal Division, so held when granting applications for leave but dismissing appeals by\nSteven Barker: (i) against his conviction on May 1, 2009, at the Central Criminal Court (Judge\nKramer, QC and a jury) for an offence of anal rape of a child, under 13 years of age, contrary\nto section 5(1) of the Sexual OffencesAct 2003, and (ii) against his sentence of life imprisonment\nwith a minimum term of 10 years, imposed on May 22, 2009, by the same court. The defendant\nwas also imprisoned at the same time for 12 years concurrent, for causing or allowing the death\nof a child, known as `Baby P', contrary to section 5 of the Domestic Violence, Crime and\nThe meaning of certain types of sentence is also unclear in some newspaper reports.\nIn the aftermath of the Baby `P' case, there were complaints that the mother was given\nan indeterminate sentence but with a minimum of just five years. The Attorney General's\noffice issued a statement saying that it could review minimum tariffs imposed on inde-\nterminate sentence prisoners, but made this clarification:\nIt is important to understand that such prisoners are not released automatically after the\nminimum term has been served \u00ad they are only released when the independent Parole Board is\nsatisfied that their continued detention is no longer necessary to protect the public. (Daily\nThis confusion was also evident in the reaction to the indeterminate sentence given to\nJunaid Abuhamza in the Khyra Ishaq case. This sentence was criticized by both the\nvictim's relatives and a politician for being too short:\nIshaq Abu Zaire raged after his ex was led away with her child-torturing lover, who could\nserve just 7-and-a-half years. `If it was up to me they would have got much longer'. (Sun, 13\nI think their actions were inexcusable. If it was up to me they would have got a much longer\nsentence. They knew what they were doing was wrong. (Mirror, 13 March 2010)\nIf it was up to me they would have got a much longer sentence than they were given. (Daily\nKhalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr ... added: `There is a sense they\nhave got off lightly here. I and many other feel there should have been murder convictions.'\nThis perception was also evident in some public responses to the case. Following the\nconclusion of the case the Sun printed a letter from a member of the public: `The patheti-\ncally short sentences given to Angela Gordon and her partner show why our prisons are\nfull. There is no deterrent to make people behave within the law' (Sun, 18 March 2010).\nOther confusions may arise because of the different accounts which are sometimes\ngiven about the same sentences. In the Khyra Ishaq case for example, the Guardian\nreported for the mother and stepfather these were `indefinite' and that the mother would\nserve `at least 15 years before becoming eligible for parole':\nHeadline: Indefinite jail terms for couple who starved seven-year-old to death: `Harsh and\ncruel' mother must serve at least 15 years ...\nA mother and stepfather who starved a seven-year-old child to death were given indefinite jail\nsentences yesterday for manslaughter. Angela Gordon, 35, was told by a judge at Birmingham\ncrown court that she would serve at least 15 years before becoming eligible for parole. Her\npartner, Junaid Abuhamza, 31, was told he would serve a minimum term of seven and a half\nBut the headlines for the Sun and the Mirror stressed that the mother will be freed from\nprison in five years:\nHeadline: OUT IN 5\u00bd YEARS ... MUM WHO STARVED KHYRA: Fury at killer's sentence.\nThe cruel mum who killed her skeletal daughter Khyra Ishaq may be freed from prison in just\nfive years. Angela Gordon was sentenced yesterday to 15 years in jail for the seven-year-old's\nmanslaughter and cruelty to her five other children. But the judge told her she will only serve\nseven-and-a-half years \u00ad minus nearly two years that have passed while she has been in custody\nSuch variations in reporting the same sentence were not uncommon in our sample.\nAcross all instances of child killing, where a life sentence was given out and the\nsentence was reported more than once we found that in 43 per cent of cases (6/14)\nthe sentence was reported differently in different newspapers. Most commonly some\nreported a life sentence with a minimum and other reported it as a term sentence.\nThe same pattern could be observed in relation to indeterminate sentencing. For instance\nVanessa George was reported as receiving a seven-year jail term in the Sun for sexually\nabusing children in her care (10 February 2010). However in the Western Mail the sen-\ntence was reported as being an indeterminate sentence with the proviso that `she must\nAnother source of potential confusion and controversy is variations between sen-\ntences given for different crimes and the issue of how appropriate are these tariffs. Such\narguments do not only relate to crimes against children but they tap into generalized\nbeliefs about the supposed leniency of sentencing and irrationality in the justice system.\nHere for example, a commentary in the Daily Telegraph (15 March 2010) is introduced\nwith the phrase: `Headline: It's simple \u00ad punishment should fit the crime; Philip Johnston\nsays he can't be the only one left confused by the current trends in sentencing.'The jour-\nnalist makes the point about public confusion by comparing different cases:\nPeter Chapman, the vile killer of Ashleigh Hall, the teenager who met him on Facebook, had\npreviously spent five years in jail for raping two women at knifepoint. How is that possible?\nFrances Inglis, who killed the son she loved with a dose of heroin because he was in a coma\nfrom which she feared he would never recover, is serving at least 10 years in jail. How could\nthat possibly merit twice the punishment meted out to Chapman? ... Confused? You are not\nThe Sun in more colourful language makes the same point about variations in sentenc-\ning while also linking this to the argument that dangerous people should not be released\nfrom prison:\nEditorial: Legal lunacy ...\nRyan Yates was considered a serious danger to women when he was freed from prison.

No order or restriction was going to make a blind bit of difference toYates'behaviour.\nA cell, locks and prison bars were the only things which would have made the public safe.\nInstead our laws meant Yates HAD to be freed despite the knowledge he was a serious risk. On\nthe flipside, a law-abiding businessman finds himself out of pocket and with three penalty\npoints on his licence because he blew his nose while behind the wheel of his van. Not a van\ndoing 70mph on the motorway, but one in stationary traffic with the handbrake on ... Common\nsense is clearly in short supply in legal circles. (Sun, 28 January 2010)\nIt was also apparent in our research that there were substantial variations in sentenc-\ning for crimes that were in some respects similar. For example, on 27 January 2010, the\nMirror reported that a computer expert had been sentenced to nine months in jail for\npossessing images of child abuse. He had fled to the USA after a first court appearance\nbut was later extradited: `Headline: 9 MONTHS JAIL FOR CHILD PORN PERV'\n(Mirror, 27 January 2010). Three days later, the Western Mail reported that a former\npolice employee, found to have indecent photographs on his computer, had avoided jail.\nSome of these pictures were described as being in the `serious' indecent category and he\nhad been sharing photos with another sex offender. The sentence given was a three-year\ncommunity order and he was reported to be `much loved' by family and friends:\n`Headline: Former police employee avoids jail over child porn' (Western Mail, 30\nWe can also compare the reporting of two cases in which men had a sexual relation-\nship with underage girls. In the first of these a man, said to be an alcoholic, was jailed for\n18 months for having sex with a 14-year-old girl:\nHeadline: MAN, 38, HAD SEX WITH GIRL\nAn alcoholic of 38 who slept with a schoolgirl was jailed for 18 months yesterday and put on\nthe Sex Offenders' Register for 10 years ... The guilty plea by Madden, from York Drive,\nBelfast, was on the agreed basis he had sex with the youngster after they had been drinking.\nA judge said there was `no excuse whatsoever in entering into any sexual relationship with such\nAlthough there is `no excuse' according to the above judgment, the sentence in the\nsecond case is quite different. Here a soldier from Sandhurst who is accused of having\nsex with a 13-year-old girl is reported to have been spared jail. In this case, the girl was\nsaid by a judge `to have made all the running':\nA soldier at Sandhurst who had sex with a 13-year-old girl was spared jail by a woman judge\nwho said the victim was `precocious' and `made all the running.' (Daily Mail, 9 January 2010)\nAlongside these apparent contradictions and confusions, there is a strong current of\nopinion expressed in editorials and comment pages that sentences are too low. This is\npartly stated as a moral argument that serious crimes require substantial punishment, but\nis also linked to a debate about public safety. The first of these is clear in the following\nexample from the Sun, where a mother is reported to have left her children in a `pigsty'\nhome as she went on a `booze and drug bender'. The focus of the story is the `outrage'\nsaid to have been sparked by the judge who ordered a suspended sentence and that fol-\nlowing a further offence she has again escaped jail. The rationale for the sentences or\nwhat the relationship is between the suspended sentence and a curfew which is men-\ntioned are all sidelined by the moral judgements around which the report is based:\nHeadline: Booze mum left four tots in this sty\nThis is the pigsty home where a mum left her four kids to go on a 24-hour booze and drug\nbender.

She was so drunk she\ncouldn't remember the third trip, Lancaster Crown Court was told. But Judge Norman Wright\nrefused to jail her AGAIN and ordered another curfew. He said: `I am going to give you one\nConcerns over public safety are highlighted by the reporting of a case such as that\nof Thomas Smith in February 2010. He was a convicted sex offender who had moved\nback to an area where his past history was largely unknown and had then murdered a\nneighbour and also killed and raped her young daughter. As The Times reported:\nA convicted sex offender who raped and murdered a 10-year old girl and killed her mother has\nbeen handed down one of the longest ever sentences in Scotland ... Strathclyde Police are now\nreviewing how 26-year-old Smith, a known sex offender, was able to strike again.

First the\nright for public information about offenders who have been released and second the\nquestion of whether dangerous criminals should have much longer sentences.

The fact that the killer has now been given an indefinite sentence is subsumed to\nthe main argument on the need for public warnings:\nAn ex-senior policeman demanded the nationwide introduction of Sarah's Law to control\npaedophiles yesterday.

But it's just\nwindow-dressing if weak judges and feeble sentencing guidelines ensure violent, dangerous,\ncallous criminals are never banged up in the first place.

(Sun, 1 April 2010)\nWe will now close this article by drawing together the key features of coverage, con-\nsidering their impact on public understanding and attitudes and asking what academics\nand those working within criminal justice can do to promote a more informed citizenry.\nConclusion\nThe picture of press reporting of sentencing that emerges from our qualitative and\nquantitative analysis is a chaotic and confusing one. There appear to be wide variations\nin the sentences handed down for what appear very similar crimes and there is rarely a\ndeveloped rationale for these discrepancies. There is also a great deal of uncertainty\nover the period that offenders will be incarcerated. The same sentence is frequently\nreported differently in different newspapers. Against this backdrop, there is a strong and\nconsistent editorial line in the tabloids which is highly critical of the judiciary and the\ncriminal justice system. This manifests itself in a steady drumbeat of criticism in\nrelation to sentencing guidelines and the behaviour of judges, together with demands\nfor tougher sanctions and notification legislation. These are justified both for public\nsafety and in the name of a moral concern at the abhorrence of the crimes. While\ncriminal justice professionals are frequently cited in all sections of the press their\ncontributions are usually quite short and rarely extend to more than a sentence or two.\nIn the tabloid press their attempts to justify their decisions tend to be drowned out by\neditorials and comment which are critical.\nThe pattern of newspaper reporting that we encountered might be expected to gener-\nate widespread public dissatisfaction and confusion over the nature of sentencing policy.\nThis is what we found. Public attitudes towards sentencing in this area appear very harsh.\nAlthough socio-economic status correlates negatively with punitiveness it is a very weak\npredictor in comparison to media consumption. Our research design does not allow us to\nmake strong statements regarding the directionality of this relationship and part of the\nreason why newspaper consumption is such a strong predictor of punitive attitudes is\nlikely to be due to those with liberal attitudes being drawn to titles like the Guardian or\nthe Independent.6 It is also likely that a paper such as the Guardian has a readership with\nexperience in areas like social policy and sentencing decisions. However evaluating the\nresults of this study in line with previous research does suggest that press coverage is a\nsignificant driver of punitive attitudes reasons (Brillon et al., 1984; Doob and Roberts,\nreason why participants respond so punitively in opinion polls is due to the fact they\nanswer with the worst offences in mind and that in evaluating sentencing policy, they\ntend to recall cases where allegedly lenient sentences are handed out. This pattern of\ncoverage, as our analysis shows, is particularly visible in the tabloid press where there is\na heavy concentration of comment on particularly notorious crimes and a steady stream\nof criticism in relation to sentencing decisions. What is also clear is that there is a great\ndeal of public misunderstanding about the IPP, which is now a key element of the\nsentencing regime in this area. Two-thirds of the public believe these sentences are\n`too short'. Even among Guardian readers who are widely seen as comprising the liberal\nintelligentsia, with a wide readership among senior public sector workers including\nmany criminal justice professionals, the proportion who saw these sentences as being too\nshort or who answered `don't know' was 54 per cent. One factor contributing to this is\nlikely to be the lack of explanation in most press coverage of when those on indetermi-\nnate sentences are likely to be released. Without explanation that these offenders have no\nautomatic right of release after their minimum term has been served, it is likely that there\nis an assumption that they will automatically be freed. Clearly this new sanction has not\nsucceeded in reassuring the public that those who pose a threat to society will remain\nincarcerated.\nThis research has illustrated some of the misconceptions and confusion regarding\nsentencing policy in relation to crimes against children and how the media may be a\ncontributory factor. However as Roberts (2008) argues, attempts to insulate the criminal\njustice system from a misinformed public are now seen as `isolationist, elitist and even\nundemocratic'. One possible solution is for members of the criminal justice system\nto engage in more outreach and education in order to explain better and justify their\nsentencing decisions. This has been the approach taken by the Home Office who have\npublished and distributed leaflets about sentencing policy and the operation of the crimi-\nnal justice system (e.g. Home Office, 2001). However Green (2006) has questioned the\nutility of this approach. He argues that one-way expert to public communication flows\nmay be insufficient to produce durable changes in public attitudes. One reason for this\nis that experts and many in the public have different frameworks of understanding for\nthe factors underlying criminality and how it might be countered. The cool dispassionate\nanalysis of crime favoured by experts may not resonate with the more affective frame-\nworks held by many in the public who tend to connect better with the emotional and\nmoralistic arguments put forward by the tabloids and populist politicians. While such\neducational initiatives may produce short-term changes in attitudes, they do not allow\nthe public `to work through the ambivalent attitudes that crime and punishment often\nproduce and to develop considered views' (Green, 2006: 146). The consequence being\nthat `emotive media coverage and populist rhetoric may be enough to undermine any\ngains these programmes produce'(Green, 2006: 146). Green suggests that an alternative\nwould be to employ deliberative opinion assessments such as `Deliberative Polls',\n`Citizen Juries', `Consensus Conferences', `Study Circles', `National Issue Forums' or\n`Planning Cells' (Ackerman and Fiskin, 2004). Deliberative polls involve recruiting\nstratified random samples of the population who spend extended periods hearing\nbalanced presentations from experts and debating the issues among themselves. These\nsessions are televised in order to make the process more transparent and engage those\nnot directly taking part. Green (2006) points to the success of a 1994 deliberate poll\nconducted in Manchester on crime and punishment issues. The `follow-up assessments\nindicated that participants tended to change their opinions markedly and durably because\nof the deliberation process and most often in a liberalising direction, revealing a sharp\ndecline in enthusiasm for punitive, incarceral responses to crime' (2006: 134). But the\nimpacts of such exercises are likely to be felt most by those who participate directly.\nA single televised message is much less powerful since it is situated in a plethora of\ncompeting and often contradictory information streams. Television audiences can\nbe reached but this requires the consistent repetition of clear alternatives and their\nendorsement by high status, credible sources (see Philo and Berry, 2011). For this to\nhappen would require politicians and other `primary definers' to reshape media agendas\nand the core content of messages on what `works' in relation to crime and penal policy.\nAt present the financial cost of punitive approaches and incarceration is forcing at least\nsome politicians to rethink traditional approaches. It is a timely moment to renew calls\nfor the media to adopt a more responsible and accurate reporting of crime and for spe-\ncialists in this area to press for a more informed debate on criminal justice policy.\nNotes\n1. We would like to thank the NSPCC for contributing funding to this study.\n2. This decision was eventually overturned following a series of controversial legal cases which\nremoved the power of home secretaries to set tariffs in such cases (Green, 2006).\n3. Megan's Law is a scheme in the United States, which allows the publication of information\nabout convicted paedophiles. It arose following the murder of seven-year-old Megan Kanka in\nNew Jersey in 1992 by a convicted child sex offender who lived in the same neighbourhood as\nthe victim.\n4. News values refer to the characteristics of a story which make it newsworthy. These include\nfactors such as immediacy, negativity, consonance, meaningfulness, cultural proximity and\nunexpectedness (see Harcup and O'Neill, 2001).\n5. Indeterminate sentencing for public protection (IPP) was introduced as part of the 2003\nCriminal Justice Act and has been used by the judiciary since April 2005. The new measure\nmeans judges set a `tariff period' that the offender must serve. However after this has expired\nrelease is not automatic instead `a release direction can only be made if the Parole Board is sat-\nisfied that the risk of harm the offender poses to the public is acceptable' (Ministry of Justice,\n2010a). In practice `this means that indeterminate sentence prisoners could remain in prison\nfor many more years on preventative grounds after they have served the punitive period of\nimprisonment set by the trial judge'(Ministry of Justice, 2010a). Indeterminate sentences have\nbeen widely used since their introduction particularly in relation to serious offences against\nchildren. The Department of Justice statistics show that 1001 IPPs were handed out in 2009\n6. In order to address more directly the question of how the media influence attitudes further\nstudies would need to employ focus group or interview research to trace the sources of audi-\nence beliefs and examine the conditions under which people accept or reject media accounts\nReferences\nAckerman BA and Fiskin JS (2004) Deliberation Day.
