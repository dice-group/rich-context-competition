Results from recent research suggest that\nenvironmental factors in utero or early life may have a\nprofound influence on the initiation of insulin resistance4.\nIt has been observed that individuals with low birth weight\n(BW) are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD),\ntype 2 diabetes and some other chronic diseases5\u00ad9. These\nepidemiological observations plus evidence from exper-\nimental studies has led to the developmental plasticity\nhypothesis that the risk of developing some chronic non-\ncommunicable diseases in adulthood is influenced not\nonly by genetic and adult lifestyle factors but also by\nenvironmental factors acting in early life; metabolic\nchanges among those individuals with low BW may be\nthe result of foetal adaptations to inadequate intrauterine\nnutrition; and individuals developmentally adapted to one\nenvironment may be at risk when exposed to another\nAlthough BW is the most commonly used index of foetal\ngrowth, it may not be the most biologically pertinent\noutcome in reflecting foetal nutritional status and its\nimpact on human health12,13. In contrast to the link\nbetween low BW and a group of chronic diseases, a\npositive association has also been persistently observed\nbetween BW and attained body mass index (BMI), a\nmeasurement of body fat distribution4,14, and persons who\nare overweight or obese, measured as high value of BMI,\nare at increased risk for CVD and type 2 diabetes1.\nThe nutrition available to the foetus represents a\nbalance between the interests of the mother and of the\nfoetus15; foetal nutritional status is determined by both\npregnancy needs (foetal growth and maternal metab-\nolism) and nutritional supply16. In general, food or\nnutritional supply is not a major concern in the developed\ncountries.

Hence, it\nwould be expected that taller mothers, generally, are more\nlikely to have relatively large babies compared with\nshorter mothers; however, it may mean that tall mothers\nand their babies are at a relatively higher risk of\nundernutrition as well, because they need more food\nsupply for foetal growth and the maintenance of normal\nmaternal metabolism. On another hand, it would also\nsuggest that short mothers and their babies are at relatively\nhigher risk of overnutrition because they demand less\nfood to supply their needs. To describe this phenomenon,\nwe propose the Foetal Nutritional Status Index (FNSI),\ncalculated by dividing the child's BW (kg) by the mother's\nheight (m2). We hypothesise that both foetal over- and\nundernutrition may be associated with a poorer cardio-\nvascular risk profile among children; this may help explain\nthe growing prevalence of insulin resistance in modern\nsociety.\nWe tested our hypothesis using data from the US Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) and applied the FNSI to examine its\nrelationship with cardiovascular risk factors among the\nNHANES III children aged 5\u00ad11 years who had the\nnecessary information needed for this analysis.\nMethods\nStudy population\nData for this analysis were obtained from the NHANES III\nstage probability sample of about 40 000 persons including\nnon-institutionalised population of the USA excluding\nreservation lands of American Indians. Of these, 3109\nold had information on BW and mother's height collected\nduring household interview as well as a non-fasting blood\nsample collected at a mobile examination centre (MEC).\nyears had birth certificate information, which contains the\nofficial record of BW, gestational age and other birth-\nrelated information. Details of the planning, sampling,\noperation, informed consent procedures and measures\ntaken to maintain confidentiality of information have been\nMeasures\nBirth weight and mother's height\nThe information on BW and mother's height was obtained\nfrom the questions asked in a household interview of the\nparents or guardians of children aged 2 months to 11\nyears: `How much did the child weigh at birth?' and `How\ntall is the child's mother/are you?' For children aged 2\nmonths to 6 years, their parents or guardians were asked\nfor permission to obtain copies of the children's birth\ncertificates from the natal dataset prepared by the Division\nof Vital Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics; it\nprovides accurate information on BW, gestational age and\nbirth order. Other interview variables are described\nBlood lipids\nNon-fasting blood samples were obtained at the MEC for\nchildren aged 5\u00ad11 years. Serum total cholesterol values\nwere determined at the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention using a modified ferric chloride technique\nmeasured in serum following the precipitation of other\nlipoproteins with a polyanion/divalent action mixture and\ntriglycerides (TG) were measured enzymatically using a\nHitachi 704 autoanalyser (Boehringer-Mannheim Diag-\nnostics).\nAnthropometric measurements\nA standardised protocol was used for all anthropometric\nmeasurements and all examiners were trained in the\nstandard procedures for obtaining measurements18.\nDuring the physical examination, participants wore only\nunder-shorts and disposable paper shirts, pants and foam\nslippers. Body weight was measured with an electronic\nload cell scale to the nearest 0.01 kg. Standing height was\nmeasured without shoes in the Frankort horizontal plane to\nthe nearest 0.1 cm using a fixed stadiometer. BMI (kg/m2)\nwas derived from weight and height. Waist circumference,\nbuttocks circumference, hip circumference and thigh\ncircumference were measured by trained technicians.\nWaist-to-hip ratio was calculated as waist circumference\nover hip circumference. Skinfolds were measured using\nHoltain skinfold callipers to the nearest 0.1 mm at four\ndifferent anatomic body sites (supraspinal, subscapular,\ntriceps and biceps). Independent measures were taken at\neach body site by two technicians, resulting in a minimum\nof two skinfold observations for each site when the\ndifference between the two measurements at a given site\nwas within a pre-specified tolerance limit. The subscap-\nular-to-triceps skinfold ratio was calculated as subscapular\nskinfold over triceps skinfold.\nBlood pressure\nBlood pressure (BP) was measured three times during the\nhousehold interview (trained technologists) and three\nmore times during the MEC examination (physicians)\nusing mercury sphygmomanometers and a standard\nprotocol19. The available measurements (six or fewer) of\nthe first Korotkoff sound were used to calculate the\naverage of systolic BP (SBP)17.\nCriterion of metabolic syndrome\nThe metabolic syndrome (MS) in children is evolving and\nthere is no general agreement about the overall\nassessment of this syndrome. However, research indicates\nJ Liu and C Sempos\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

For instance, childhood BP is a predictor of\nadulthood BP21; those who had higher SBP levels\nin childhood were more likely to have arterial stiffness in\nadulthood22; and the patterning of the risk clustering seen\nin adults is present in healthy adolescents and obesity is\nthe predominant correlate of cumulative risk23. Therefore,\nin this study, we used a cluster of cardiovascular risk\nfactors that are associated with insulin resistance to define\nMS. Abnormal levels of cardiovascular risk factors were\ndefined using the sex-specific third quartile of SBP,\nTG, subscapular-to-triceps skinfold ratio (an indicator of\ncentral obesity), and the first quartile of HDL-C (Table 1).\nThe MS was defined as the presence of two or more\npositive components.\nConfounding variables\nOther variables in the analysis included the child's age at\ninterview (years), race (1 \u00bc white, 0 \u00bc non-white),\nmother's age at the child's birth (years), mother's smoking\nstatus during the pregnancy (1 \u00bc yes, 0 \u00bc no) and sex\n(when necessary).\nStatistical analyses\nAll analyses were conducted using Stata/SE 8.2 for\nWindows (StataCorp). All analyses incorporated the\nsampling weights to calculate means, percentages and\nregression coefficients and the complex survey design to\ncalculate standard errors. To examine if the reported BW is\nreliable, we used the sub-sample of 985 children who were\n5\u00ad6 years old and had BW information from both birth\ncertificate and house interview to compare the differences\nin BW between the two sources. Using Cronbach's a24, we\nfound that the reported BW (mean \u00bc 3341.4 g) and the\nrecorded BW (mean \u00bc 3339.2 g) were highly consistent\nwith one another (Cronbach's a \u00bc 0.99). Therefore, we\ndeveloped the FNSI using the reported BW (kg) over\nmother's height (m2) for the entire sample and the recorded\nBW (kg) over mother's height (m2) for the sub-sample. The\nassociation between the FNSI and BW and mother's height\nwas examined by sex in two ways. First, the three variables\nwere treated as continuous variables and Pearson\ncorrelation coefficients were calculated. Then the Pearson\nx 2 statistic was computed between the FNSI (in quintiles)\nand mother's height (inquartiles) and BW (inquintiles); this\nstatistic was corrected for the survey design using the\nsecond-order correction of Rao and Scott and converted\ninto an F statistic25.\nThe means of cardiovascular risk-related variables were\ncompared and the trends of the means of cardiovascular\nrisk-related variables were tested by sex among children\nwithin different quintiles of the FNSI after adjustment for\nthe child's age, mother's age at the child's birth, maternal\nsmoking status and race. Multiple logistic regression\nmodels were used to assess the association between these\ncardiovascular risk factors and the FNSI after adjustment\nfor the confounding variables listed above. The cardio-\nvascular risk factors, including central obesity (1 \u00bc third\nquartile of subscapular-to-triceps skinfold ratio, 0 \u00bc else),\nhigh BP (1 \u00bc third quartile of SBP, 0 \u00bc else), high TG\n(1 \u00bc third quartile of TG, 0 \u00bc else) and low HDL-C\n(1 \u00bc first quartile of HDL-C, 0 \u00bc else), and MS (1 \u00bc any\ntwo or more of the cardiovascular risk factors, 0 \u00bc else)\nwere regressed on four indicator variables created to\nrepresent the FNSI quintiles (with the third quintile as the\nreference group). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs) were computed. Logistic regression\nanalyses were also repeated on examining the association\nof these cardiovascular risk factors and BW in quintiles\n(the third quintile as the reference group).\nfemales) aged 5\u00ad6 years had additional information from\nthe birth certificate including measured BW, gestational\nage and birth order, we also conducted a similar analysis to\nassess the ORs for these cardiovascular risk factors and MS\namong this sub-sample with adjustment for gestational age\nand birth order with sex combined, as there were not\nenough children in this age group to conduct analyses by\nsex. In addition, an interaction term between sex and\nfoetal nutritional status was created and its relationship\nwith cardiovascular risk factors examined.\nResults\nThe FNSI was highly and positively associated with BW\n(Pearson correlation coefficients in the entire sample: 0.89\nnegatively associated with mother's height (in the entire\nTable 1 Sex-specific cut points for metabolic syndrome components*\nFemales Males\n* The sex-specific third quartile of systolic blood pressure (SBP), triglycerides (TG) and\nsubscapular-to-triceps skinfold ratio were used to define high blood pressure, high TG level and\ncentral obesity, and the first quartile of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was used to\ndefine low HDL-C level.\nFoetal nutritional status and cardiovascular risk 1069\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

The distributions of BW in quintiles and of\nmother's height in quartiles according to the FNSI in\nquintiles are shown in Figs 1 and 2, respectively. The\nPearson x 2 statistics suggest these variables are not\nindependent from each other (P , 0.001). It is clear that\nthe majority within the first quintile of the FNSI are those\nbabies with a relatively smaller BW (67.7% of males and\n66.6% of females with BW ,2.9 kg) and with a relatively\nmother's height .1.63 m); while within the fifth quintile of\nthe FNSI, most subjects are those babies with a relatively\nfemales with BW .3.7 kg) and with a relatively shorter\nheight ,1.63 m). The means (ranges in parentheses) of the\nFNSI, BWand mother's height, and means or percentages of\nthe confounding variables, by quintiles of the index for the\nentire sample are shown in Table 2. Compared with those in\nthe higher quintiles, those in the lower quintiles have a\nlower proportion of white mothers, younger average\nmother's age at birth and higher proportion of reported\nmaternal smoking (P-values for trends ,0.05). There are\nsimilar results for the sub-sample (data not shown).\nTable 3 summarises the adjusted means for two groups\nof cardiovascular risk factors, the variables related to\nbody fat distribution and the variables related to lipids\nand blood pressure. For males, except for the mean level\nof HDL-C in the first quintile, there were no statistical\ndifferences in variables related to body fat distribution or\nlipids and blood pressure. For females, the mean levels of\nmost measurements related to body fat distribution\nincreased with increasing value of the FNSI (P-values for\ntrends ,0.05). Those in the fifth quintile had the highest\nlevels of the anthropometric measurements, highest\nlevels of TG and the lowest levels of HDL-C. However,\nin comparison to the reference group, the mean levels of\nsubscapular-to-triceps skinfold ratio were higher in those\nwithin the first (P , 0.05) and second quintiles\nThe prevalence and adjusted OR of the cardiovascular\nrisk factors are shown in Table 4. In males, the odds for\nthose in the first FNSI quintile was 2.4 times higher in\nthe low HDL-C category (P , 0.01) and 2.1 times higher\nin the MS category (P \u00bc 0.01) in comparison to those in\nthe reference group. In females, approximately 24% of\nthose in the first and fifth quintiles of the FNSI had central\n(1.5\u00ad4.8) for the fifth quintile). In addition, over one-third\nof those in the fifth quintile of the index had higher TG\napproximately two times higher for those in the first and\nfifth quintiles compared with those in the reference group\n(P , 0.05). When the analyses were conducted using BW\nin quintiles (Table 5), the results from males were almost\nidentical to those using the FNSI. In females, however, no\nassociations between the cardiovascular risk factors and\nBW were observed.\nTo examine the impact of gestational age and birth\norder on the relationship between foetal nutritional status\nand cardiovascular risk factors, we repeated the logistic\nregression analyses among the sub-sample with additional\nadjustment for gestational age and birth order (Table 6).\nThe results are very similar to those of the entire sample\nexcept for low HDL-C level. There were no interactions\nbetween sex and cardiovascular risk factors (data not\nshown) except for the lower level of HDL-C; it indicates\nthat females in the fifth quintile were more likely to have\nFig. 1 Distribution (%) of birth weight (BW) in quintiles according to the Foetal Nutritional Status Index (FNSI) in quintiles\nJ Liu and C Sempos\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. ReadCube, on 28 Apr 2017 at 16:06:27, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms.\nDiscussion\nTo overcome the limitation of using BW alone to reflect\nfoetal nutritional status, we propose using the child's BW\nand mother's height \u00ad two easily obtained and relatively\naccurate measurements \u00ad to create the Foetal Nutrition\nStatus Index (FNSI): an index reflecting the relationship\nbetween maternal maintenance needs (mother's height)\nand foetal growth (birth weight). We argue that although\nmany factors may affect foetal growth, maternal mainten-\nance needs will have a tremendous modifying effect on\nfoetal growth when other factors are relatively stable. It is\nalready noticed that the neonatal phenotype is highly\nassociated with maternal size and body composition26. For\ninstance, maternal height is often used as a predictor of\nbirth outcome27 as well as a rational proxy of maternal\nnutritional needs16. It is expected to have relatively larger\nbabies from taller mothers and to have relatively smaller\nbabies from shorter mothers; this means that the taller\nmothers need relatively more food supply and shorter\nmothers need relatively less. As observed from Figs 1 and\n2, the subjects within the lowest quintile of the FNSI are\nmore likely to be lighter babies with taller mothers; in\ncontrast, the subjects within the highest quintile of the\nFNSI are more likely to be heavier babies with shorter\nmothers. These results suggest that babies from taller\nmothers are relatively more susceptible to undernutrition\ncompared with those from shorter mothers; while foetal\ngrowth among these shorter mothers is relatively more\nsusceptible to overnutrition compared with that among\ntaller mothers.\nWe reasoned that if both foetal nutritional insufficiency\nand foetal overnutrition elevate cardiovascular risk, there\nshould be evidence that these circumstances are related to\nthe components of MS. We hypothesised that both foetal\nnutritional insufficiency and foetal overnutrition may be\nassociated with elevated cardiovascular risk among\nchildren. In comparison with the reference group, the\nresults from the entire sample suggested that the FNSI has\na similar cardiovascular risk pattern as BW in males; the\nsubjects in the lowest quintile of either the FNSI or BW\nhave higher risk of MS and abnormal HDL-C. In females,\nBW was not associated with MS and cardiovascular risk\nfactors; however, those within the highest quintile of the\nFNSI have higher risk of abnormal cardiovascular risk\nfactors and MS. These results indicate that foetal nutritional\nstatus has an impact on cardiovascular risk profiles among\nchildren and that BW may not be a good indicator of foetal\nnutritional status, at least among female children.\nOur analyses suggest that those children who were\nsubjected to a nutritionally insufficient or an overly\nnutritious environment in the foetal stage may have higher\ncardiovascular risk factors levels, although the impact may\nbe slightly different between the sexes. In general, among\nfull-term singletons, male infants weigh approximately\ninfants are expected genetically to be heavier than their\nfemale counterparts, mothers bearing males consumed\nmore energy during pregnancy than mothers bearing\nfemales30; consequently, taller mothers with male infants\nare relatively more easily affected by foetal nutritional\ninsufficiency. Thus, if the metabolic pattern is pro-\ngrammed during foetal life as suggested by the develop-\nmental plasticity hypothesis10,11, then males would be\nexpected to have a higher level of risk for an abnormal\nmetabolism pattern among those subjected to a nutrition-\nally insufficient environment in the foetal period than\nfemales similarly exposed. On the other hand, if\novernutrition also affects the metabolic pattern in later\nlife then females would be more likely to have a higher\nFig. 2 Distribution (%) of maternal height (MHT) in quartiles according to the Foetal Nutritional Status Index (FNSI) in quintiles\nFoetal nutritional status and cardiovascular risk 1071\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Our findings support the\nhypothesis that both foetal under- and overnutrition may\ncontribute the development of insulin resistance, which\nmay help to explain the epidemic of obesity and its related\nchronic diseases.\nSeveral studies have noted the impact of maternal\nfactors on cardiovascular risk profiles in later life. In a\nstudy of the relationship between BW and cardiovascular\nrisk factors in 477 Indian children aged 8 years, it was\nfound that the most insulin-resistant individuals were from\nthose whose parents were short, but who had grown the\ntallest by 8 years of age31. A follow-up study on young\nadults who were born during a longitudinal nutritional\nsupplementation trial in Guatemala was conducted to\nexamine the relationship between fasting glucose level\nand maternal nutritional status, and an inverse association\nwas found with birth size among women born to fatter\nmothers and men born to short mothers32. Results from the\nCebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey also\nindicated that males born small to tall mothers who were\nrelatively poorly nourished during pregnancy tended to\nhave the highest low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels\nin adolescence16. In addition, an inverse relationship\nbetween maternal height and childhood BP was observed\namong UK adolescents33. However, using the FNSI to\nreflect foetal nutritional status and examine its cardiovas-\ncular risk association is novel. Although our findings\nsupport the hypothesis that both foetal under- and\novernutrition may be associated with abnormal cardio-\nvascular risk factors, it is important that additional studies\nbe performed to confirm these results and determine the\nimpact of using the FNSI to examine foetal nutritional\nstatus on cardiovascular risk factors among children.\nThere are several specific limitations in our study that\nneed to be addressed. First, the mother's height used for\nderiving the FNSI was self-reported height from household\ninterview. However, mothers from the current analyses\nwere relatively young and the average age of mothers at\nthe child's birth was approximately 25 years; the results\nfrom studies of the NHANES III suggest that the self-\nreported heights are reliable among younger adults34,\nespecially among younger female adults35. Second, the\nmeasurement of TG level was from a non-fasting blood\nsample because of the participants' young age. This may\naffect the relationship between foetal nutritional status and\ncardiovascular risk factors in the analyses; however, results\nfrom some studies indicated that non-fasting TG levels\nwere positively associated with central obesity among pre-\nschool children36 and were a good predictor of CHD risk\namong adults37. Third, there were not enough samples to\nexamine the ethnic differences observed among the\ndifferent quintiles of the FNSI.\nNotwithstanding these limitations, the strength of this\nstudy is that it is based on the NHANES III sample design\nTable 2 Current age and birth-related variables by quintiles of the Foetal Nutritional Status Index (FNSI) and sex: the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988\u00ad94)\nFNSI quintile\nP for linear\ntrend\nJ Liu and C Sempos\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.
