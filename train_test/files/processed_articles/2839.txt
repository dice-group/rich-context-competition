This is especially the case for countries applying the exemp-\ntion system in international taxation, like Germany.\nThe analysis is based on data provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank's Micro-\ndatabase Direct Investment (MiDi) database. Specifically, data on German\nforeign affiliates in the manufacturing sector which are directly and wholly-\nowned by a German parent company is used for the analysis. Host countries\nincluded are the EU member countries (as of 2007) and the most advanced\nNon-EU OECD countries. In total, information contained in yearly data on\n587 German affiliates abroad over 7 years is explored.\nThe analysis is based on the widely known Lintner model of dividend smooth-\ning, which is frequently seen as a relevant description of firms' dividend\npayout behavior. The Lintner model is a partial adjustment model sug-\ngesting that firms have a target dividend payment, which is a fraction of\nits current earnings. The model leads to an empirical specification relating\ndividends paid to lagged dividends and current earnings of the firm. How-\never, the basic Lintner model has been established for dividend payments\nto public shareholders, but not the intra-firm case and moreover it does not\ninclude taxes as determinants of dividend payments. Thus, two issues prior\nto exploring the tax effect within the Lintner framework arise: (i) it has\nto be established that the basic Lintner model also is suitable to analyze\ncross-border intra-firm payout behavior; and (ii) the Lintner model has to\nbe augmented to include taxes as determinants of dividend payments.\nEmpirical analysis of the basic Lintner model implies that this model seems\nto be valid for analysing cross-border intra-firm dividend payments, even if\nemphasis is put on the isolation of \"true state dependence\" in payout be-\nhavior. The existence of \"true state dependence\" implies that payment of\ndividends in earlier years has a genuine behavioural effect on future divi-\ndend policy, as suggested by the Lintner model. Yet, compared to studies\nanalysing the public shareholder sphere, the target-payout ratio is lower and\nthe speed of adjustment is higher in the intra-firm context. From a more\nsubstantive perspective these differences are in line with the theoretical view\nsuggesting that dividend payments are less relevant for signalling and con-\ntrolling (agency) aims in the parent-subsidiary sphere.\nConcerning the second issue raised, the basic Lintner model is augmented\nin a way that the target dividend payment is not merely a fraction of the\nfirm's current earnings but also depends on other factors like the taxation\nof dividends paid, the firm size or the debt level of the affiliate. Estimating\nempirically the augmented Lintner model reveals that taxes do play a signif-\nicant role for the repatriation behavior. In particular, the results imply that\na one percentage point decrease in the dividend tax rate would result in a\n3.5 (1.6) percent increase in dividends repatriated if the coefficients derived\nare evaluated at the overall mean value of dividend payments (mean value\nof positive dividend payments).\nNicht technische Zusammenfassung\nDiese Studie untersucht, ob Dividendensteuern sowohl aus statistischis-\ncher als auch aus \u00a8\nokonomischer Sicht eine relevante Wirkung auf das Vol-\numen von nach Deutschland repatriierten Dividenden haben. Bisher liegt\nkaum empirische Evidenz \u00a8\nuber den Einfluss von Dividendensteuern auf intra-\nFirmen Dividendenzahlungen \u00a8\nuber die Grenze vor. Dies ist insbesondere f\u00a8\nur\nL\u00a8\nander wie Deutschland der Fall, welche das Freistellungsverfahren in der\nInternationalen Besteuerung anwenden. Die Analyse st\u00a8\nutzt sich auf Daten\naus der \"Microdatabase Direct Investment\" (MiDi) der Deutschen Bundes-\nbank. Es werden in der Analyse Daten \u00a8\nuber direkte Deutsche Tochterge-\nsellschaften des verarbeitenden Sektors im Ausland verwendet, welche zu\nhundert Prozent im Eigentum einer Deutschen Muttergesellschaft stehen.\nAls Gastl\u00a8\nander werden alle EU Mitgliedstaaten mit Stand 2007, sowie die\nh\u00a8\nochstentwickelten nicht-EU OECD L\u00a8\nander inkludiert. Insgesamt wird In-\nformation aus j\u00a8\nahrlichen Daten \u00a8\nuber 587 Deutsche Tochterunternehmen im\nAusland \u00a8\nDie Analyse st\u00a8\nutzt sich auf das Lintner Modell der Dividendenpolitik, welches\ndie Dividendenzahlungen eines Unternehmens in Abh\u00a8\nangigkeit der laufenden\nGewinne und fr\u00a8\nuherer Dividendenzahlungen analysiert. Das Lintner Modell\nist ein partielles Anpassungsmodell, welches impliziert, dass Unternehmen\neinen bestimmten Anteil des Gewinnes als Dividendenzahlung anstreben.\nDieses Modell resultiert in einer empirischen Spezifikation, welche die gezahlte\nDividende zu den im Vorjahr gezahlten Dividenden und den laufenden Gewin-\nnen und Verlusten in Beziehung setzt. Nachdem das Lintner Modell f\u00a8\nur\ndie Erkl\u00a8\narung von Dividendenzahlungen an individuelle Anteilseigner en-\ntwickelt wurde, nicht aber f\u00a8\nur intra-Firmen Dividendenzahlungen und es\nzudem Steuern als Determinanten von Dividendenzahlungen nicht enth\u00a8\nalt,\nm\u00a8\nussen bevor der Effekt von Steuern mithilfe des Lintner Modells analysiert\nwerden kann zwei Punkte gekl\u00a8\nart werden: Erstens muss festgestellt wer-\nden, ob das urspr\u00a8\nungliche Lintner Modell auch f\u00a8\nur die Analyse des Divi-\ndendenzahlungsverhaltens im grenz\u00a8\nuberschreitenden intra-Firmen Kontext\ngeeignet ist. Zweitens muss das Lintner Modell um Steuern als Determinan-\nten von Dividendenzahlungen erweitert werden.\nDie empirische Analyse zeigt, dass das Lintner Modell geeignet ist, um\ndas Dividendenzahlungsverhalten im grenz\u00df\"uberschreitenden intra-Firmen\nKontext zu analysieren, sogar wenn Pfadabh\u00a8\nangigkeit in der Dividendenpoli-\ntik explizit ber\u00a8\nucksichtigt wird. Pfadabh\u00a8\nangigkeit impliziert, dass Dividen-\ndenzahlungen in fr\u00a8\nuheren Jahren eine direkte Auswirkung auf zuk\u00a8\nunftige\nDividendenzahlungen haben, wie es das Lintner Modell vorhersagt. Je-\ndoch zeigt sich, dass im Vergleich mit den Ergebnissen von Studien in\nBezug auf individuelle Anteilseigner die Anpassungsgeschwindigkeit h\u00a8\noher\nist. Dieser Unterschied ist konsistent mit theoretischen Modellen, welche\neine geringe Relevanz von Dividendenzahlungen zum Zweck des Signal-\nisierens (signalling) und der Kontrolle (agency) im Mutter-Tochter Zusam-\nmenhang aufzeigen.\nUm dem zweiten Punkt Rechnung zu tragen, wird das Lintner Modell er-\nweitert, so dass die angestrebte Dividendenzahlung nicht nur eine Funk-\ntion des Gewinnes (Verlustes) ist, sondern auch von anderen Faktoren,\nwie zum Beispiel der Besteuerung der ausgesch\u00a8\nutteten Dividende, der Un-\nternehmensgr\u00a8\no\u00dfe oder dem Verschuldungsgrad der Auslandstochter abh\u00a8\nangt.\nDie empirische Sch\u00a8\natzung des erweiterten Lintner Modells ergibt, dass Steuern\neine signifikante Rolle f\u00a8\nur das Repatriierungsverhalten spielen.\nDie Ergebnisse der empirischjen Analyse implizieren, dass eine Senkung\ndes Dividendensteuersatzes um einen Prozentpunkt zu einer Steigerung der\nrepatriierten Dividende um 3.5 (1.6) Prozent f\u00a8\nuhren w\u00a8\nurde, wenn die Regres-\nsionskoeffizienten am Mittelwert der gezahlten Dividende (am Mittelwert der\nDividenden mit positiven Euro-Wert) evaluiert werden.\nContents\n2 The basic Lintner model 2\n2.1 The model framework . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\n2.2 Survey of existing studies applying the basic Lintner model . 3\n2.2.1 Public shareholder sphere . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\n2.2.2 Cross-border intra-firm sphere . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n2.3 Relevance of the basic Lintner model for cross-border intra-\nfirm dividend payments of German firms . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n2.3.1 Methodological considerations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n2.3.2 Dividend data . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n2.3.3 Descriptive evidence on firm-level data . . . . . . . . . 13\n2.3.4 Econometric results for the basic Lintner model . . . . 13\n3 Do taxes have an impact on the amount of dividends repa-\n3.1 Dividend taxes and intra-firm dividend payments - Survey of\nthe empirical literature . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14\n3.2 An augmented Lintner model . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\n3.3 Taxes and additional determinants of dividends . . . . . . . . 17\n3.3.1 Taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\n3.3.2 Other determinants of dividends . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n3.4 Econometric results for the augmented Lintner model . . . . 21\n3.5 Robustness checks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22\n1 Introduction\nDividend repatriations of foreign affiliates to domestic parent companies\nand their determinants, respectively, are an important topic, both from\nmicro- and macroeconomic viewpoints (e.g. Altshuler and Grubert, 2002).\nFrom the micro-perspective the choice of whether to repatriate earnings\nfrom a foreign subsidiary is a relevant decision in multinational financial\nmanagement. From the macroeconomic viewpoint, the timing and extent\nof dividend repatriation may have direct consequences for the level of tax\nrevenues, employment and investment in the home and the host country\nof Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Thus, if dividend taxes significantly\ndetermine firms' repatriation policies, they may also be directly connected\nwith micro- and macroeconomic consequences.\nIt is a stylized fact that high dividend taxes reduce dividends paid (see\nGordon and Dietz, 2006). This tax effect is predominantly established in\nstudies dealing with dividend payments to public shareholders. In contrast,\nevidence on the impact dividend taxes have on cross-border intra-firm divi-\ndend payments is rather scarce, even though some evidence is available for\ncredit system countries, the US in particular. Evidence for exemption sys-\ntem countries, like Germany1, is even scarcer. However, even in the latter\ncase dividend taxes may impact on the volume of dividends repatriated as,\nfor instance, host countries of FDI might levy withholding taxes on repatri-\nated profits.\nThis paper analyzes the impact dividend taxes exert on the dividends\nrepatriated from foreign affiliates to their German parent company. The\neffect dividend taxes have on intra-firm cross-border dividend repatriation\npolicies can be analyzed by a new and powerful dataset, namely the Micro-\ndatabase Direct Investment (MiDi) provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank.\nThis database includes firm-level data of German parent companies and their\naffiliates abroad. Specifically, based on the Lintner model of firms' dividend\npayout decisions (see Lintner, 1956) the paper focusses on the cross-border\ndividend payments of wholly-owned foreign affiliates (direct participating\ninterests, Lipponer, 2008) in the manufacturing sector to their parent com-\npany in Germany.\nThe analysis is based on the Lintner model, as this model is consistent\nwith a second empirical stylized fact about firms' dividend decisions, namely\nthe dividend smoothing behavior of firms (see e.g. Gordon and Dietz, 2006).\nMoreover this model is frequently seen as \"the best description of the divi-\nnoted, however, that the original intention of the Lintner model was not to\nexplain cross-border intra-firm dividend payments. Rather, the focus was\n1Germany effectively applies the exemption system also prior to 2001 by exempting\ndividends via double tax treaties and having an extensive treaty network (see Grubert,\nto describe dividend payments of firms to public shareholders. Additionally,\nthe \"basic\" Lintner model does not directly contain taxes as a possible de-\nterminant of dividend policy. Thus, two issues arise: Firstly, the empirical\nrelevance of the Lintner model for the specific dividend payment decision\nconsidered in this paper has to be explored. Secondly, the basic Lintner\nmodel has to be augmented to capture the impact of dividend taxes on the\nexpected value of dividend payments.\nWith respect to the first issue raised, we find that the Lintner model\nis indeed suitable for analyzing cross-border intra-firm dividend payments,\nalthough the target payout ratio and the degree of dividend smoothing are\nrelatively low and the adjustment to the target payout ratio occurs rather\nquickly. Yet, one has to bear in mind that our analysis also shows that the\nexpected value of dividends remitted is higher for firms that initially pay\na higher dividend. Based on an \"augmented\" Lintner model we find that,\nbesides the variables stressed by Lintner and the initial dividend payment,\ntaxes as well as an affiliate's indebtedness and size significantly determine\ndividend repatriation decisions. Specifically, the results imply that a one\npercentage point decrease in the dividend tax rate would increase dividends\nrepatriated by 3.5 percent if evaluated at the overall mean dividend payment\n(semi-elasticity of about -3.5). Evaluated at the mean of positive dividend\npayments a semi-elasticity of -1.6 is derived. These results are broadly com-\nparable to the values derived by prior studies focusing on Multinational\nEnterprises (MNEs) from the US.\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section two outlines the basic Lintner\nmodel and provides an overview of studies analyzing its empirical relevance.\nFurther, section two includes some methodological considerations for ana-\nlyzing dividend decisions and it elaborates on the usefulness of the basic\nLintner model for analyzing the cross-border intra-firm dividend decisions\nof German companies. Section three presents results from the estimation of\nan augmented Lintner model which also captures various additional deter-\nminants of firms' dividend policies, notably dividend taxes. The augmented\nLintner model is thereby introduced, and the results of related literature as\nwell as the regression results are presented. Section four summarizes.\n2 The basic Lintner model\n2.1 The model framework\nThe basic Lintner model is essentially a \"partial adjustment model\". Thus,\nthe model begins with the following equation describing dividend payments\nDIVit = d(DIV \nit\nwith: i = firm i, t = year, d = speed of adjustment coefficient, DIVit =\ndividend payment of firm i in year t, DIV \nit\n= desired (long-run) dividend\npayment, it = error term.\nIn a panel context, the error-term is written as it = ci + t + it with t\nbeing time-specific effects usually modeled as time dummies, ci are (random\nor fixed) firm-specific time invariant effects and it is the remainder error\nterm. Substituting DIV \nit\nby rProfitit with Profitit being the current\nyear's earnings after taxes of the firm and 1  r > 0 being the desired\nlong-run target payout ratio and rearranging gives\nDIVit = drProfitit + (1 - d)DIVit-1 + it (2)\nThe most important implications of the Lintner model given in Equation\n(1) and Equation (2) can be summarized as follows (based on Marsh and\n1. After tax earnings are the most important determinant of dividends.\nRecursively solving Equation (2) shows that current and past values\nof Profitit are the main determinants of dividends.\n2. Firms' managers focus on dividend changes.\nThis is directly derivable from Equation (1). Lintner (1956) formulates\nhis model in this way. Yet he conducts his empirical analysis based on\nEquation (2).\n3. Firms have a desired, long-run payout ratio (r).\nThis implies that r derivable from Equation (2) is significantly different\nfrom zero.\n4. Firms smooth dividend payments.\nDividend changes follow shifts in earnings, yet due to technological,\ninstitutional and psychological inertia, firms will smooth dividends.\nIn other words, the level of dividends paid in t - 1 has an impact on\ndividends paid in t.2\n2.2 Survey of existing studies applying the basic Lintner\nmodel\nWe have separated the empirical studies using the basic Lintner model into\ntwo categories: the first deals with the dividend payout in general, mainly\ninvolving dividends paid to public shareholders, and the second specifically\n2A number of theoretical models explain why firms smooth dividends. Among them\nare signalling and agency models. The first sees dividends as a means for managers to\nsignal \"true profitability\" to shareholders and the latter argues that the board of directors\nrequires dividend payments as a device to control selfish managers (see Gordon and Dietz,\nconcerns cross-border intra-firm dividend payments. The former papers are\nfurther detailed into early studies, including the seminal work of Lintner,\nrecent studies and studies dealing with German firms. We provide three\nmeasures to characterize the studies: the estimated long-run payout ratio\n(r), the speed of adjustment coefficient (d) and the median adjustment lag\n(). The latter shows the time period necessary to close the gap between the\nactual and the target dividend payment by 50 percent after a disequilibrating\nshock has occurred.3 Table (1) in the appendix shows the results derived.4\n2.2.1 Public shareholder sphere\nLintner (1956) uses aggregate data from national accounts. He reports a\nspeed of adjustment coefficient of 30 percent and a target payout ratio of\n50 percent. The median adjustment lag is about two years. These results\nPanel A), using firm-level data in order to better reflect the individual firm\ndecision. Brittain (1964) provides another set of results by generalizing\nLintner's model via introducing depreciation allowances, personal income\ntax rates on dividends and other explanatory variables, based on aggregated\nBrittain differ markedly from the average reported in Table (1), as the speed\nof adjustment is rather low (0.15) and the averaged long-run payout ratio is\nthe highest of all studies surveyed (0.90).\nRecent studies are those of Van Eije and Megginson (2008), who use\nData-Stream and Worldscope firm-level data with a focus on European coun-\ntries and Skinner (2008), who uses data on US firms from Compustat. Van\nEije and Megginson (2008) report a higher speed of adjustment coefficient\nand a target payout ratio comparable to that of the Lintner benchmark.\nSkinner (2008) reports a markedly lower speed of adjustment coefficient and\nthus a higher median adjustment lag (see Table (1)).\nStudies based on German firm-level data are Behm and Zimmermann\nWhile the speed of adjustment is much lower than Lintner's, the averaged\nlong-run payout ratio is almost equal. Da Silva et al. (2004) use data on\nyears of accounting data exist. They find a slightly lower speed of adjust-\n3The median adjustment lag () is calculated as (ln(0.5)/ln(1 - d)) (see Pindyck and\n4Most studies focus on the US and other highly developed OECD countries. With\nrespect to other countries, for example Glen et al. (1995) found that the speed of adjust-\nment lies between 40 percent in Zimbabwe and 90 percent in Turkey and the target payout\nratios are between 30 and 40 percent. Adaoglu (2000) points out a speed of adjustment\nof 100 percent in Turkey with a payout ratio of 50 percent.\nuse data on 220 industrial and commercial firms in Germany. In particular,\ntheir finding points to a more flexible dividend policy as firms are willing\nto cut the dividend when profitability is only temporarily down. The re-\nsults of Andres et al. (2009) are consistent with a lower degree of dividend\nsmoothing of German firms compared to firms from the US or the UK.\n2.2.2 Cross-border intra-firm sphere\nThe Lintner model is also used to model cross-border intra-firm dividends.\ndividends repatriated from US affiliates abroad). A third study (Lehmann\nand Mody, 2004) uses data from current accounts and analyzes inter alia\naggregate dividend payments from abroad to Germany. Compared to the\nresults for dividends paid to public shareholders, the speed of adjustment\ncoefficients of these studies are much higher, and therefore the median ad-\njustment lags are lower. Thus, these results imply that dividend smoothing\nis not as relevant in the cross-border intra-firm case as it is for the public\nshareholder sphere.5\ncomparable to those reported for dividend payments to public shareholders,\nthe target payout ratio derived by Lehmann and Mody (2004) is virtually\nvalidity of the Lintner model for the cross-border intra-firm dividend case.\nOverall, the empirical studies reported in Table (1) are in favor of the\nLintner model. However, smoothing seems to be much more important\nfor the public shareholder sphere than for cross-border intra-firm dividend\npayments. Nevertheless, our summary of results also implies considerable\nheterogeneity between studies, especially concerning the speed of adjustment\nand hence the median adjustment lags.\nIt must be noted that the studies included in Table (1) are based on the\nlinear OLS estimator. Yet, as dividend payments of an individual firm can-\nnot be negative, the dependent variable is left censored. Using the OLS esti-\nmator for firm-level data therefore probably leads to inconsistent estimates,\nas the conditional expectation of the model is non-linear in the parameters\nand the regressors (see Wooldridge, 2002, p. 525). Hence, an estimator for\ncensored and corner-solution data, the Tobit estimator, is better suited for\ntesting the Lintner hypothesis of dividend smoothing in these cases. Indeed,\nthe study of Desai et al. (2001) also applies this estimator and finds a speed\n5Among the early papers applying the Lintner model in the cross-border intra-firm\ncontext is Scaperlanda and Mauer (1972). According to Hines and Hubbard (1990), Sca-\nperlanda and Mauer also find much higher speeds of adjustment than found in studies for\npayouts to public shareholders.\n2.3 Relevance of the basic Lintner model for cross-border\nintra-firm dividend payments of German firms\n2.3.1 Methodological considerations\nAs previously outlined, persistence in dividend payments is a crucial feature\nof the Lintner model. More specifically, the Lintner model postulates what\ncan be called \"true state dependence\" in terms of Heckman (1981a, p. 91ff).\nThus, the payment of dividends in year t0 has a genuine behavioral effect\non future dividend policy in the sense that an otherwise equal firm which\ndoes not pay a dividend in year t0 will behave differently in the future. The\ncoefficient on the lagged dividend variable in the Lintner model is intended to\nisolate true state dependence and to signal the extent of dividend smoothing\nbehavior of firms.\nYet, firms' dividend policies also differ due to firm-specific, unobserved\nheterogeneity. In particular, for firm-specific reasons not related to the be-\nhavioral smoothing effect postulated by Lintner, firms pay (or do not pay)\ndividends. In this case, past dividend payments have no effect on the prob-\nability of paying dividends in the future (Baltagi, 2008, p. 217) and thus\nthey are not part of an equation modelling dividend payments. Rather, the\neffect is captured by firm-specific time invariant effects.\nPanel data allow us to include both a lagged dependent variable cap-\nturing the behavioral effect, as well as unobserved heterogeneity (i.e. firm-\nspecific time invariant effects) in the same empirical model. Loudermilk\n(2007) stresses that unobserved affiliate-level heterogeneity is potentially\nimportant in explaining repatriated dividends. If one does not control for\nthis unobserved heterogeneity - that is, by using a pooled estimator instead\nof a panel data estimator, the lagged dividend variable in the Lintner model\nacts as a proxy for such unobserved effects. An upward bias in the effect of\nthe lagged dependent variable arises (see Hsiao, 2003, p. 218ff for examples).\nImproper treatment of unobserved heterogeneity gives rise to a relationship\nbetween past and future dividend payments which is \"spurious\" (\"spurious\nstate dependence\") in terms of Heckman (1981a). In this case a significant\n(and positive) effect of the lagged endogenous variable in the Lintner model\nmay not be related to behavioral dividend smoothing as postulated by Lint-\nner (1956). Thus, neglecting unobserved affiliate-level heterogeneity results\nin a biased estimate of the degree of dividend smoothing.6\n6So far, only a few empirical studies have attempted to examine the influence of mod-\nelling firm-specific, unobserved heterogeneity on the degree of smoothing behavior in the\nLintner model. A notable exception is Loudermilk (2007). She examines the determi-\nnation of the share of payouts to firms' shareholders made as share repurchases versus\ntraditional cash dividends within the Lintner framework. In doing so, she explicitly mod-\nels the impact of unobserved heterogeneity on the coefficient of the lagged dependent\nvariable. Moreover, dealing with firms' dividend policies, Benito and Young (2003) also\nstress the importance of modelling unobserved heterogeneity. They analyze the incidence\nof dividend omissions and cuts as functions of financial characteristics including cash flow,\nSeveral approaches are proposed in the literature to estimate dynamic\nnon-linear panel data models with firm-specific unobserved heterogeneity.\nOne crucial point therein is to cope with the \"initial conditions problem\",\nwhich occurs when the first period for which we observe an outcome is\nnot the beginning of the underlying stochastic process (Benito and Young,\nserved in-sample values of the endogenous variable. This issue is aggravated\nif the initial condition is correlated with the time invariant firm-specific ef-\nfects. Then, it is important to model the relationship of the initial condition\n) with the firm-specific time invariant effects (ci). A first approach\nis to consider the DIVit0\nas uncorrelated with ci. Yet, this assumption basi-\ncally implies that DIVit0\nis exogenously given and fixed, which might not be\nthe case. A second approach, which models DIVit0\nas correlated with ci, is\nto approximate, for example via a Probit model, the conditional distribution\ngiven ci and the exogenous variables (Heckman, 1981b). A third\napproach is to model ci as a function of DIVit0\nand the exogenous vari-\nables (Wooldridge, 2005). The latter approach has the advantage of being\napplicable to corner-solution problems. Thus, in this study we apply this es-\ntimator.7 Specifically, we estimate the following corner-solution model (see\nDIVit = max(0, drProfitit + (1 - d)DIVit-1 + it) (3)\nwith: it = ci +t +it and it  Normal(0, 2\n\n), t = 1,. . . ,T. As mentioned,\nthe initial conditions problem is handled by specifying a distribution for ci\ngiven DIVit0\nand the exogenous variables. Thereby either the \"Chamberlain-\napproach\" (Equation (4)) or the \"Mundlak-approach\" (Equation (5)) may\nbe applied. The first approach models ci as a function of DIVit0\nand of\nall exogenous explanatory variables across all time periods. The second\napproach includes the time average of all exogenous explanatory variables\ntogether with DIVit0\nc\n, Profit; \n= a + bDIVit0\n+ mProfiti + i (4)\n\n).\nc\n, Profit; \n= a + bDIVit0\n+ mpi. + i (5)\nwith pi. = 1/T T\nProfitit.\nleverage, investment opportunities, investment and company size.\n7The approach of Heckman (1981b) is for binary endogenous variables.\n8The definitions of variables included in Equation (3) are the same as those in section\nIn both cases, coefficients of time-constant exogenous variables, like\ncountry dummies, are not identified if included in Equation (4) or Equa-\nof ci in Equation (3) by the right side of Equation (4) or Equation (5) gives\nthe corner-solution model which can be estimated by a standard random\neffects Tobit estimator. These estimates thus control for firm-specific un-\nobserved effects and measure inter alia how within-firm changes in current\nearnings impact on dividends paid, given the level of lagged dividends paid\nThe Wooldridge (2005) estimator has the advantage of allowing the\ncalculation of Average Partial Effects (APEs) from the estimated Tobit-\ncase of corner-solution applications - such as, for example, the repatriation\ndecision of foreign affiliates, the Tobit coefficient is not the parameter of in-\nterest.9 Rather, for an economic interpretation of the estimates one should\nderive APEs which are better suited for evaluating the economic importance\nof variables.

Although the MiDi database does not di-\nrectly provide figures for dividends paid by affiliates abroad to their German\nparents, it provides sufficient information to allow the calculation of divi-\ndend payments according to the rules of the \"Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch\"\n(HGB; German Code of Commercial Law). German parent companies have\nto deliver inter alia balance sheet data to the MiDi database according to\nHGB standards.11 The method of dividend calculation applied here there-\nfore follows HGB standards.

The same\noutlier analysis is conducted for variable p32.\niv) The MiDi database provides balance sheet data converted into Euros.\nAs we use data from balance sheets of different years (e.g. t and\nt+1) the issue of exchange rate stability arises. Balance sheet data\nin local currencies are not given in the MiDi database. Moreover, the\napplication of the bilateral Euro exchange rate to convert the data\ninto local currencies is complicated for several reasons: (a) different\naffiliates have different accounting dates so that the Euro exchange\nrate to be applied varies over affiliates within a particular host country\nand a given year; (b) as the balance sheet items are expressed in 1,000\nEuros, they might be rounded values. Hence, a perfect replication of\nthe balance sheet data in local currency would not be possible even if\nthe \"correct\" Euro exchange rate were known; (c) a substantial share of\naffiliates report their balance sheet data to the Deutsche Bundesbank\nin different currencies in different years.14 Given these problems, a\nperfect transformation of the Euro data into local currencies is not\n14For example, the database contains affiliates which report their balance sheet state-\nment denominated in the local currency of the host country in year t, in Deutschmarks in\npossible. To cope with the exchange rate stability problem we calculate\nan average Euro exchange rate using the exchange rate data provided\nby the MiDi. The exchange rate used (Forexjt) is based on the average\nover the exchange rates used by all affiliates which have their balance\nsheet statements denominated in the local currency of the host country\nin a given year. Thus, affiliates which use other currencies (usually\nthe Deutschmark and the Euro) are not included in this average. We\nprimarily use this variable to construct an additional control variable\nin the regressions. Yet, as a robustness check we also transform the\ndata using this exchange rate before (to end up with data in local\ncurrencies) and after (to end up with data denominated in Euros again)\nthe calculation of the dividend variable and estimate the model with\nthese \"converted\" data.\nv) To check the plausibility of the derived dividend data it is compared\nwith the dividend data provided in the Deutsche Bundesbank's DiKap\ndatabase.

The reason for the exclusion of service sector industries\nis that the balance sheet data of these industries (e.g. holding companies,\nfinancial intermediaries) would inflate the balance sheet items. Yet, their\nparent companies may be active in any industry, whether it be manufactur-\ning or services, i.e. they also comprise German holding companies. The host\ncountries of German FDI considered are the EU-15 (without Germany), the\nnew EU member states (NMS-12) and all non-EU OECD-countries exclud-\ning Mexico, South Korea and, in the analysis in section 3, due to missing\ntax data, Iceland and Turkey.\nt+1 and in Euros in t+2. Transforming the Euro data using the exchange rate data given\nby the Midi database would result in using balance sheet items (e.g. p32) denominated in\nlocal currency of the host country and in Deutschmarks (e.g. forward lag of p31) in the\ncalculation of the repatriated dividend in year t.\nOnly those affiliates abroad which are wholly and directly owned by an\nincorporated German parent company (direct participation16) are included\nin the sample. This is for two reasons: First, to cope with agency prob-\nlems which might be reduced by using wholly owned affiliates (e.g. Da Silva\net al., 2004) and, second, to have to model only one bilateral relationship\n(Germany and the respective host country of FDI). Thus, we neither model\nrelationships between an affiliate and other affiliates of a common parent,\nnor between an affiliate and its several parent companies.17\nbeen chosen because data on capital reserves contained in the MiDi database\nare plausibility checked with the beginning of 1999 by the Deutsche Bundes-\nbank. 2005 is the most recent year in the MiDi database when the analysis\nhas been undertaken.

Hence, the vast majority of\naffiliates is incorporated. Moreover, only affiliates with a balance sheet total\nof at least 3 mn Euro are included to cope with changes in the balance sheet\nthreshold over time. To sum up, definitions and sources of our variables used\nin the empirical analysis are given in Table (2) in the appendix.\n16Lipponer (2008, FN 5 and 6): \"In the case of German foreign direct investment,\nit is the resident investors which are subject to reporting requirements (. . . ). Affiliated\ninvestors are those which have come together specifically to establish the investment en-\nterprise, which pursue economic interests jointly by holding participating interests in one\nor more enterprises or who are closely related to each other (direct related by blood or\nmarriage) or are connected with each other as defined in section 15 of the Companies Act\n(Aktiengesetz).\" A direct investment enterprise is classed as \"dependent if the Investor\nholds more than 50% of the shares or voting rights. If a \"dependent\" enterprise holds a\n100% participating interest in another enterprise than this enterprise and any additional\nenterprise fulfilling the condition of a 100% participating interest are also regarded as\n\"dependent\".\"\n17The effects dividend taxes have on indirect participating interests are analyzed by\n18In the sample used in the present study, 85 percent of affiliates have been included in\nthe MiDi database since 1996 and thus the dividend generation process started well before\n2.3.3 Descriptive evidence on firm-level data\nTable (3) in the appendix shows descriptive evidence on the firm-level data\ntaken from the MiDi database. The distinction between dividend payers and\nnon-payers (about 47 percent of our sample) clearly reveals similarities with\nregard to the size of affiliates and FDI stock, but also marked differences with\nregard to indebtedness, current earnings and profits according to the balance\nsheet. In particular, profits according to the balance sheet are negative for\nnon-payers. The mean dividend paid is 1.2 mn (overall) and 2.7 mn (payers)\nEuro. For the \"converted\" dividend variable the means are 1.1 mn and 2.3\nmn, respectively.\n2.3.4 Econometric results for the basic Lintner model\nThe results for the basic Lintner model are presented in Table (4) of the\nappendix. These results intend to show whether the Lintner model can be\napplied to the research problem at hand. Part one of Table (4) shows the\nresults for the pooled Tobit estimator (balanced panel). Short-run Tobit\ncoefficients as well as short-run APEs are given. This estimator does not\nmodel the panel structure and thus might lead to an upward bias in the\ndegree of state dependence (dividend smoothing) as outlined in (2.3.1). The\nstatistically highly significant coefficient of the lagged dependent variable,\nthe corresponding speed of adjustment coefficient and the target payout\nresults imply that the gap between actual and target payout ratio is reduced\nPart two of Table (4) shows the results derived applying the Wooldridge-\nestimator (Chamberlain-approach). Modelling unobserved firm heterogene-\nity in dividend payments indeed leads to a drop in the coefficient on the\nlagged dependent variable and of the APE to 0.11 and 0.04, respectively.\nAccordingly, the speed of adjustment coefficient increases to 0.89 (APE of\nPart three of the Table shows the results using the Mundlak-approach.\nApplying this approach does not alter the results. Finally, the impact of\nusing a balanced panel is analyzed in the model shown in the final column,\nwhich is based on the pooled Tobit estimator and the unbalanced panel in\nwhich affiliates that are in the sample for at least three consecutive years\nin part one (balanced panel). This suggests that sample selection problems\nare of minor importance here.\nHence, these results imply that once we have controlled for unobserved\ntime-invariant firm-specific time invariant effects dividend smoothing is less\nan issue for German multinational firms' dividend policy. The effects of\ndisequilibrating shocks are absorbed rather quickly. However, one has to\nbear in mind that the coefficient on the initial condition (DIVit0\n) is positive\nand highly statistically significant. Thus, firms paying higher dividends at\nthe beginning of the sample period also have higher expected dividend pay-\nments. This represents an additional channel of inertia in dividends paid.\nMost importantly however, the results imply that the Lintner model seems to\nbe valid for analyzing cross-border intra-firm dividend payments. Yet, com-\npared to studies analyzing the public shareholder sphere, the target-payout\nratio is lower and the speed of adjustment is higher. From a more sub-\nstantive perspective these differences are in line with the view that, for the\nparent-subsidiary sphere, dividend payments are less relevant for signalling\nand controlling (agency) aims. Other instruments like detailed informa-\ntion on balance sheet positions or internal reporting systems and incentive\nschemes (e.g. internal job promotion) are available to parent companies to\nmonitor and influence the performance and the behavior of their affiliates'\nmanagers. Dividend smoothing and target payout ratios should be lower for\ncross-border intra-firm dividend decisions.\n3 Do taxes have an impact on the amount of div-\nidends repatriated?\nAfter having established that the Lintner model is applicable for the cross-\nborder intra-firm case, the model has to be augmented to capture the effect\nadditional variables exert upon dividend payments. However, before the\naugmented Lintner model is presented and the various variables used in\nthe estimation are introduced, a brief summary of related literature on the\nimpact dividend taxes exert on dividend payments is given.\n3.1 Dividend taxes and intra-firm dividend payments - Sur-\nvey of the empirical literature\nLiterature on the impact of dividend taxes on dividend remittances with a\nfocus on German MNEs is scarce. The use of holding companies and owner-\nship chains of German companies' outward FDI, i.e. indirect participating\ninterests (Lipponer, 2008) including partial ownership, has recently been ex-\nplored by Weichenrieder and Mintz (2008). Ownership chains are inter alia\nused for the \"routing\" of dividends across third countries in order to lower\nthe tax burden. The findings of Weichenrieder and Mintz (2008) show the\nimportance of withholding taxes as a determinant for the design of own-\nership chains of German MNEs. Weichenrieder and Mintz (2008) further\nargue that the gains from using holdings and ownership chains may be ex-\npected to be larger for profitable firms that pay large dividends. Thus, one\nmay expect holding companies to be usually used by firms with large profits,\nas gains in the form of avoided dividend taxes are high. Thus, establishing\na tax effect on dividend payments, even in the case of holding companies\nexcluded from the analysis, as we have done in this study, would emphasize\nthe importance of withholding taxes for repatriation decisions. Hence, this\nstudy presents evidence complementary to that given in Weichenrieder and\nMintz (2008). Note that Weichenrieder and Mintz also base their analysis\non the MiDi database. However, they do not directly model dividends as a\nfunction of dividend taxes.\nAlthough not explicitly referring to the Lintner model, some empirical\nliterature which aims to determine the sensitivity of dividend repatriations\nto tax costs emerged in the US. This literature increasingly focusses on\nalternatives to dividend repatriations19, which \"is a costly alternative from\na tax perspective\" (Altshuler and Grubert, 2002, p. 74). The standard\nmodel employed by these studies can be summarized as20:\nwith: DIVi = dividend payment of foreign affiliate i to its US parent, Taxi\n= tax on dividend payments, Yi = affiliate's after tax income; Zi = vector\nof other affiliate characteristics, Xi = vector of the characteristics of the US\nparent, i = error term.\nHines and Hubbard (1990) use US aggregate time series data on repatria-\na differentiation between various repatriation channels (interest paid to the\nparent to service debt capital contributions and royalty payments). For div-\nidend payers who are in a deficit credit position, the tax on dividends has a\nnegative effect on distribution. The payout ratio increases by 0.16 percent-\nage points upon a one percentage point decrease of the tax variable. Using a\nTobit specification, Altshuler and Newlon (1993) again find a negative and\nsignificant impact of the dividend tax on affiliates' dividend remittances.\nAlso, higher affiliate net profits increase dividend payments. Evaluated at\nthe mean, the coefficient on the tax variable indicates that an increase in\nthe tax rate by one percentage point decreases the dividend payout ratio by\n0.054 percentage points, which translates into approximately a 1.5 percent\ndecrease in dividend payments. (ibidem, p. 108)\nFrom the mid-1990s onwards, a series of closely linked papers emerged.\nAltshuler et al. (1995a,b) show that the permanent components of tax costs\ndo not affect dividend payments, while transitory components do. This\nresult is in line with the \"new view of dividend taxation\". They also estimate\na Lintner-like model. Based on this model they find that a reduction in the\ntax rate implies an increase in the overall payout ratio (Altshuler et al.,\n20Note, as most of these studies use cross-sectional data we use the subscript i (affiliate\ni) instead of it.\nGrubert (1998) challenges these findings and argues that the results are\ndue to the omission of alternatives to profit repatriation. Distinguishing\nvarious alternatives to dividends, his findings suggest that dividends and\nother repatriation taxes significantly alter the composition of payments of\nan affiliate to its US parent. In particular, the \"tax price of dividend repa-\ntriation discourages dividends, but they do not increase retained earnings.\"\n(ibidem, p. 284) Moreover, including all dividend payments by foreign af-\nfiliates, i.e. not only those paid to their US parents, suggests that even in\ncountries applying an exemption system (e.g. Germany), the withholding\ntax rate enters statistically significant in his model.\nAltshuler and Grubert (2002) add yet other alternatives to dividend\nrepatriation. Including certain types of triangular relationships, which are\nimportant in the US case, they find that \"the coefficient for the local with-\nholding tax on dividends is negative, as expected, and highly significant.\"\nFollowing the large and temporary tax cut on dividend income by the US\nJobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 200321, Chetty and Saez\n(2005) examine the effects of dividend taxation on payout policies. They\nconclude that the rise in regular dividend payments . . . offers perhaps the\nclearest evidence thus far in the literature that tax policy does matter for\ndividend payout policies.\" (p. 828)\nIn a further study on the effects of the temporary dividend tax cut of\nrespond to the tax cut, as the likelihood of a dividend increase following the\nAn analysis of the effect of repatriation taxes on dividend payments\nof US affiliates abroad to their US parents based on the Lintner model is\nconducted by Desai et al. (2001). They find that a one percent change in\nthe dividend tax rate also changes the volume of dividends repatriated by\nabout one percent. Desai et al. (2001, p. 849) conclude that repatriation\ntaxes \"reduce the volume and efficiency of financial flows between affiliates\nand their American parents.\" These results are confirmed in Desai et al.\nTo summarize, the available empirical evidence implies that dividend\ntaxes do matter for cross-border intra-firm dividend payments. Yet, this\nresult is predominantly established for countries applying the credit system\nin international taxation.\n21The US Jobs Growth Act creates a temporary tax holiday that reduces the US tax\nrate on repatriations from foreign subsidiaries from 35 percent to 5.25 percent (see Blouin\n22See Blouin and Krull (2008) for details on the characteristics of firms which repatriate\nunder the US Jobs Growth Act.\n3.2 An augmented Lintner model\nTo analyze the impact taxes and other variables exert on dividend payments\nthe Lintner model is augmented as follows (see, e.g. Khan, 2006, for a similar\napproach):\nDIVit = d(DIV \nit\nwith:\nit\n= rProfitit + zTaxjt + wMit + sNjt + hFkt (9)\nSubstituting and rearranging gives\nDIVit = drProfitit +dzTaxjt +d(wMit +sNjt +hFkt)+(1-d)DIVit-1 + it\nwith: it = ci + t + it. Thereby, Mit, Njt and Fkt are matrices of variables\ncapturing additionally relevant determinants of dividends varying over affili-\nates (i), host countries (j) or German industries (k). The long- and short-run\nimpacts of taxes on dividends are given in Equation (9) and Equation (10),\nrespectively (z and dz).\n3.3 Taxes and additional determinants of dividends\nIn the case of cross-border dividend payments, the relevant dividend tax rate\nis not only determined by any withholding tax rates levied by host coun-\ntries of FDI on dividends. In addition, one must consider rules contained\nin double taxation agreements (DTAs) as well as any unilaterally binding\ntax laws. Germany has signed DTAs with all host countries included in our\nanalysis. Thus, the withholding tax rates on dividends as given in the DTAs\nare relevant. Germany applies the exemption method in international taxa-\ntion, implying that dividends repatriated are not further taxed in Germany.\nYet, due to stipulations concerning the deductibility of operating costs this\nexemption is provided only for 95 percent of the dividends repatriated since\n1999.23 Five percent of repatriated dividends are taxed by the German cor-\nporate income tax rate (including local business tax rates and the solidarity\n23Art. 8b/7 of the German Koerperschaftssteuergesetz (German corporate income tax\ninally Art. 8b/7 stipulates that 15 percent of a foreign dividend are effectively taxed due\nto stipulations concerning deductibility of operating costs. As these 15 percent were\nagainst the EU Parent Subsidiary Directive this rate was reduced later in 1999 via the\n\"Steuerbereinigungsgesetz\" (Dezember 1999) to 5 percent. In the current German Koer-\nperschaftssteuergesetz the stipulations contained in Art. 8b/7 reappeared in Art. 8/5 and\nalso had a broader focus (from 2002 onwards). Thus, the 95 percent exemption has been\nsurcharge). Moreover, for EU host countries of German FDI, the Parent-\nSubsidiary-Directive (PSD) applies. The latter inter alia stipulates that the\nwithholding tax rates on dividends be set to zero. Yet, only 14 countries\napplied the PSD throughout the whole sample period (the old EU-member\ncountries), ten countries have applied it from 2004 onwards (the NMS which\njoined the EU in 2004) and two EU-member states (Bulgaria and Romania)\nhave applied the PSD from 2007 onwards. Thus, the applied dividend tax\nrate and its variability over time and host countries, respectively, depend on\n(i) the host country (EU member country or third country), (ii) the with-\nholding tax rate according to the DTA and (iii) the German overall tax rate\non corporate income. The dividend tax rate (Taxjt, in percent) which is\nused in the empirical analysis is calculated as:\nwith: j = withholding tax rate on dividends of host country j according to\nDTA (proportion); j is zero if PSD applies; DE = overall corporate income\n= assumed gross return of Euro 100 distributed as dividend.24\nDividends are only one means of transferring funds from the subsidiary\nto the parent. Another means is share repurchases by the affiliate which\nare subject to capital gains taxes. Thus, dividend repatriation policy might\nalso depend on the taxation of share repurchases made by the affiliate. It\nis likely that dividend payments decrease if the taxation of capital gains is\nreduced. To capture the influence of share repurchases on dividend policy,\nwe follow Poterba (2004) and apply a \"tax discrimination factor\" (TDjt) in\nour analysis. TDjt measures the net or post-capital gains tax return from\nshare repurchases in percent of the net or after dividend tax rate dividend\npayment (having an equal gross return of Euro 100). With respect to capital\ngains taxes, one has to bear in mind that most of the DTAs signed by\nGermany preclude a withholding tax on capital gains at source (according to\n2008). Moreover, those host countries which have not included Art. 13/5 in\ntheir DTA with Germany (i.e. Australia, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Cyprus,\nSlovak Republic, New Zealand and Norway) also do not levy capital gains\ntaxes on shares repurchased. Thus, capital gains realized through share\nrepurchases are not taxed at source. Furthermore, Germany applies the\nexemption method in case of capital gains. Yet, as in the case for dividends,\nonly 95 percent of capital gains received have effectively been exempted since\n2004 due to stipulations concerning the deductibility of operating costs (see\nis calculated as:\n24For example, Taxjt\nfor j being an old EU member country and t being 2005 is 0 +\nTDjt = (\nTDjt = (\nwith: j = withholding tax rate on dividends of host country j according to\nDTA (proportion); j is zero if PSD applies; DE = overall corporate income\ntax rate of Germany (proportion); 0.05 is due to 95 percent exemption25.\nWe expect that a higher Taxjt reduces the expected value of dividends\nrepatriated, as the Euro value of one unit dividend repatriated is reduced.\nThus, a negative sign of the short- and long-run tax coefficient is expected.\nFurthermore, as an increase in TDjt implies that transferring funds by share\nrepurchases is relatively cheaper (in terms of tax burden borne), a negatively\nsigned coefficient of TDjt is expected, too.\n3.3.2 Other determinants of dividends\nBesides the Lintner-type variables, (DIVi,t-1, Profitit) and the initial divi-\ndend payment (DIVit0\n) we include several variables that have been shown as\nimportant determinants of repatriation policies in theoretical and empirical\npapers.\nA first group of determinants of dividends contained in the Mit, Njt and\nFkt matrices in Equation (10) relates to liquidity of the affiliate. Internal\nand external debt plays a role here: Firms with greater debt ratios and likely\nhigher claims from interest expense on their earnings are less likely to pay\ndividends (Brown et al., 2007, p. 19). Higher debt constrains liquidity and\nthe tight liquidity position of affiliates should then have a negative impact\non the ability and willingness to pay out dividends. Therefore, we use a\nfirm-specific debt indicator (debtit) of long- and short-run company debt in\nthe empirical analysis. Note, as an affiliate's debt might be simultaneously\ndetermined with dividends paid, the one-year lagged debt variable is used.\nA negatively signed coefficient is expected.\nNote, that debt financing of affiliates might also be used as a device to\ncontrol the affiliates. Higher debt may reduce agency problems between the\nparent company and the affiliate in a similar way to dividend payouts (e.g.\nBrown et al., 2007, footnote 14). This agency argument is also related to a\ncountry's risk level, as it is usually maintained that an affiliate in a culturally\nor institutionally distant and/or politically risky country would present a\n25For example, Taxjt\nis zero due to the\nPSD and the 95 percent exemption applies to foreign dividends and foreign capital gains\ngreater agency risk to the parent. Therefore the parent would desire a\nhigher degree of control of the affiliate's investment behavior. \"Under such\nconditions, the parent might require higher intra-firm dividend payments\n[...] than it requires from its other affiliates in less risky or more familiar\nmarkets.\" (Lundan, 2006, p. 57) This argument is confirmed, for example,\nby evidence presented in Lehmann and Mody (2004), who find on the basis\nof aggregate data that the payout ratio appears to be lower for less risky\ncountry risk factors may explain the positive country effects on dividend\nremittances for certain countries. Thus, we include a proxy for the level\nof a host country's political risk (Riskjt) in the augmented Lintner model.\nAs the level of risk decreases with an increase in the value of Riskjt, a\nnegatively signed coefficient is expected.26 Note that it is conceivable that\naffiliates which are partially owned pay higher dividends than wholly-owned\nfirms, as local influence is possibly higher in the former (e.g. Desai et al.,\n2006). To cope with this channel of agency problems, only wholly-owned\naffiliates are used in the empirical analysis.\nAnother group of determinants focusses on investment and growth op-\nportunities either in the host or the home country, and is also related to\nthe liquidity issues discussed above. On the one hand foreign affiliates with\nattractive investment opportunities may finance their new capital expendi-\ntures inter alia by reducing or omitting dividends to their parent companies.\nThe host country real growth rate (Growthjt) is used to proxy for growth\nopportunities of the affiliate. Since we include only manufacturing affili-\nates in our analysis, we use the aggregate growth rate of the manufacturing\nsector of each host country of German affiliates. We expect a negative\nrelationship with dividends. On the other hand repatriated dividends may\nincrease if growth opportunities in the home country (Germany) are soaring.\nIndustry-level real growth rates (Growthkt) are used to capture investment\nopportunities in Germany.\nThe size of the affiliate (Sizeit) is considered as another firm-specific\nfactor determining the expected dividend repatriated. In their empirical\nstudy on UK repatriation, Bond et al. (2005) find that \"larger firms tend\nto have higher dividend payout ratios\" (p. 60; also see Benito and Young,\n2003). This might be due to the higher market power of larger firms which\ncould ceteris paribus translate into higher dividend payouts. Furthermore,\nthe size variable may capture the age of the firm, as older firms are larger\nand are expected to pay higher dividends due to lower growth opportunities\nand larger retained earnings. In a similar vein, Brown et al. (2007) include\nfirm size among the set of covariates in their study of the effect of executive\nshould be financed more by local indebtedness and thus lower dividends should follow.\nYet, given the level of debt - as implied by the ceteris paribus condition in an econometric\nanalysis - a higher country risk should lead to higher dividends.\nstock ownership on dividend payouts, yet no results are displayed on this\nTable (2) in the appendix also includes the details of the variables used\nin the subsequent empirical estimation and Table (5) also displayed in the\nappendix shows the descriptive evidence for the additional control variables\nused.\n3.4 Econometric results for the augmented Lintner model\nApplying the Tobit estimator proposed by Wooldridge (2005) leads to the\nresults displayed in Table (6) given in the appendix to the paper. In the\nsecond (based on the Chamberlain-approach; model 1) and the third (based\non the Mundlak-approach; model 2) column results for the full model, in-\ncluding all variables discussed above, are given. As the results are robust\nwith respect to the approach used to model affiliate-specific effects, the re-\nmaining models contained in Table (6) are based on the computationally\nsimpler Mundlak-approach. Models 3 to 5 differ from model 2 by excluding\ninsignificant control variables one at a time. Model 6 is our \"preferred\"\nmodel in the sense that it contains only statistically significant variables.\nFinally, in model 7 the dividend tax rate (Taxjt) is substituted by the tax\ndiscrimination factor, TDjt, which incorporates the taxation of capital gains.\nModels 2 to 6 of Table (6) reveal that dividend taxes indeed impact neg-\natively on the expected value of the repatriated dividends from wholly and\ndirectly owned foreign affiliates. This is also the case if Taxjt is substituted\nby the tax discrimination factor (model 7). An increase in TDjt, which\nmight arise either if the capital gains tax rate decreases or the dividend tax\nrate increases (ceteris paribus), leads to a fall in expected dividends repa-\ntriated. Thus, using TDjt reinforces the results derived by applying the\ndividend tax rate.\nConcerning the control variables included, the Lintner-type variables\n(lagged dividend and current year's earnings) and the initial dividend pay-\nment as well as an affiliate's size and indebtedness enter statistically sig-\nnificant. The proxies capturing the growth opportunities as well as a host\ncountry's political risk level fall short of statistical significance. Due to the\nrelatively high level of political stability in the host countries included, the\ninsignificance of Riskjt is not unexpected. Moreover, the insignificance of\nGrowthkt might be an indication for the rather poor growth performance of\nGermany over the majority of years considered in the analysis. The insignif-\nicance of Growthjt is somewhat unexpected. It might be an indication of\nthe location of many German affiliates in countries where growth is rather\nsluggish during the sample period. Moreover, the inclusion of a full set of\n27Note that most of the models estimated also include Forexjt\nas defined above as an\nadditional variable in the Njt\nmatrix.\ntime dummies might partly capture the effect of both variables, Growthjt\nand Growthkt.\nTable (6) gives an impression which variables impact significantly (pos-\nitively or negatively) on repatriated dividends. Yet, in order to derive the\neconomic effects of these variables, APEs are more useful than Tobit co-\nefficients. The second and third column of Table (7) show the short- und\nlong-run APEs derived based on model 6 of Table (6).\nUsing the short-run APEs shown in column two of Table 7 implies that\na one percentage point decrease in the dividend tax rate increases the con-\nditional expectation of dividend payments by about 43 thsd. Euro. This\nresult implies that, if Germany would abandon the taxation of 5 percent\nof dividends repatriated which leads to a decrease of the dividend tax rate\nfrom about 2 percent to zero for EU member host countries, dividends repa-\ntriated by foreign affiliates in these countries would increase by about 86\nthsd. Euro.\nEvaluating the effect of a one percentage point decrease in the dividend\ntax rate at the overall mean value of dividends repatriated by affiliates (1.2\nmn Euro) implies a semi-elasticity of dividends with respect to the dividend\nincreases slightly to about 45 thsd. Euro (cf. column three of Table 7) or a\nsemi-elasticity of about -3.7. If the mean of positive dividend payments (2.7\nmn Euro) is used the semi-elasticities derived are -1.6 and -1.7, respectively.\n3.5 Robustness checks\nThe remaining columns of Table (7) (models 8 and 9) include further robust-\nness checks. Model 8 gives estimates for the preferred model 6 being esti-\nmated using the Chamberlain-approach rather than the Mundlak-approach.\nAgain, the results are robust with respect to the way affiliate-specific effects\nare modelled. Model 9 shows that the substantive results already contained\nin model 6 of Table (6) do not change if we use \"converted\" balance sheet\ndata to derive the dividend variable instead of using Forexjt as an additional\ncontrol variable. The estimated tax effect remains statistically significant\nFinally, note that the coefficients of the Lintner-type variables as well as the\ncoefficient of the initial dividend payment are also in this case in line with\nthe results displayed in Table (4).\nThe aim of this study is to explore whether dividend tax rates have a statis-\ntically and economically relevant impact on the expected value of dividend\nrepatriated from foreign wholly-owned manufacturing affiliates to their Ger-\nthe Lintner model. As this model does not directly model cross-border\nintra-firm dividend payments, in a first step the empirical relevance of the\nLintner model for such cases is analyzed. Then the basic Lintner model\nis augmented to capture the effects of additional variables on the expected\ndividend payment. Our results imply that dividend taxation has an impact\non firms' payout policies. Specifically, we derive a semi-elasticities of about\n-3.5 (evaluated at the overall mean) and -1.6 (evaluated at the mean of posi-\ntive dividends), respectively, implying that a one percentage point change in\nthe dividend tax rate will change dividends repatriated by 3.5 (1.6) percent.\nIt has to be stressed, that our analysis is based on direct participations in\nthe manufacturing sector only. Thus, the analysis complements the results\nderived by Weichenrieder and Mintz (2008), which show that dividend taxes\nimpact on the location of holding companies and the structure of interna-\ntional ownership chains by German MNEs in general. Holding companies are\npredominantly used to channel profits of highly profitable affiliates. Thus,\nestablishing a tax effect even in case of direct participations underlines the\nrole of dividend taxes for repatriation decisions of firms.\nReferences\nAdaoglu, C., 2000.
