Therefore, understanding the\nmolecular mechanism by which vascular EC dysfunction\narises under HG conditions may be useful for both the pre-\nvention and treatment of diabetic vascular complications.\nMany reports have shown that calcium is an important\nregulator of endothelial function in diabetes,6\u00ad8 and\nmitochondria constitute one of the largest intracellular\ncalcium pools.

Mitochondrial calcium uniporter\n(MCU) is the pore-forming subunit of the Ca2+ uniporter\nion channel located on the mitochondrial inner membrane\nthat mediates Ca2+ uptake into the matrix, regulating\ncytoplasmic Ca2+ signalling.9\u00ad11 MCU is essential for glu-\ncose-induced increases in adenosine triphosphate (ATP)\nconcentration in pancreatic -cells,12 and its knockdown\nreduces agonist- and depolarization-induced mitochon-\ndrial Ca2+ sequestration, ATP production, and d-glucose-\nstimulated insulin secretion.13 However, the role of MCU\nin hyperglycaemia-induced EC dysfunction has not been\nexplored.\nWe propose that MCU is the critical protein responsible\nfor mitochondrial Ca2+ overload in EC dysfunction caused\nby hyperglycaemia. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter reg-\nulator 1 (MCUR1) is also essential for the formation of\nMCU complex and may regulate its function, enabling\nmitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and the maintenance of normal\ncellular bioenergetics.14 Reactive oxygen species (ROS)\noverproduction, increased apoptosis and compromised\nwound-healing ability contribute to the development of\npathological conditions associated with endothelial dys-\nfunction.15,16 Thus, in this study, we used human umbilical\nvein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to investigate the\ninvolvement of MCU and MCUR1 in hyperglycaemia-\ninduced mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, ROS overproduc-\ntion, apoptosis and decreased wound-healing ability.\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture and treatment\nHUVECs were purchased from the American Type Culture\nCollection (Manassas, VA, USA) and were cultured in low-\nglucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)\ncontaining 10% foetal bovine serum, 100U/L penicillin and\n. Cells of passages\n3\u00ad7 were used for experiments. As described in previous\nstudies, the cells were treated with different concentrations\nmM glucose was considered\nthe `normal glucose' (NG) condition. Once the optimal glu-\ncose exposure time and concentration had been established,\nexperiments involving 30-min pre-treatment with the MCU\ninhibitor ruthenium red (RR; 0.2\nmM) (Sigma, St. Louis,\nMO, USA) or MCU activator spermine (sper; 2mM) (Sigma)\nwere carried out. As an osmotic control, treatment with\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction\nTotal RNA was isolated from HUVECs using Total RNA\nKit I (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA) and reverse\ntranscribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) with a\nReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA Remover\nkit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). In all, 50-ng samples of this\ncDNA were then subjected to real-time polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR) on a Mastercycler nexus X2 PCR\nSystem (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using SYBR\nGreen I and TaqMan probes and primers targeting MCU\n(forward: TTCACCTCTTCTGGGAGCAG; reverse:\nCTCTGGCTTCTGG) and -actin (forward: GAGAC\nAGCCA). Values for each unknown were determined by\nthe 2-Ct method, using -actin as a reference sequence\nand standard curves derived from samples of known RNA\nquantities.\nWestern blotting\nTotal protein extracts (30\n\u00b5g) were electrophoresed on a\n10% sodium dodecyl sulphate\u00adpolyacrylamide gel. The\nseparated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a\npolyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, which was\nblocked with a 5% skimmed milk solution for 2h at 25\u00b0C\nand incubated with primary antibodies against MCU and\n4\u00b0C. After washing, the blots were incubated with a goat\nanti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated\nAntigen\u00adantibody complexes were visualized using ECL\nWestern Blotting Detection Reagents and an ImageQuant\n350 instrument (GE Healthcare, Marlborough, MA, USA).\nOnce stripped, the membranes were further probed with an\nantibody against -actin as a loading control. Greyscale\nvalues were calculated from blots using ImageJ software.\nMeasurement of [Ca2+]mito and [Ca2+]cyt by\nlaser confocal microscopy\nChanges in [Ca2+]mito and [Ca2+]cyt were detected by\nincubating HUVECs for 30min at 37\u00b0C in the dark with the\nCa2+ indicators Rhod-2 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene,\nOR, USA) and Fluo-3 AM (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China) at\nfinal concentrations of 2 and 5\u00b5mol/L, respectively. After\nincubation, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-\nbuffered saline (PBS) and analysed by capturing fluores-\ncence images using a confocal microscope equipped with\nan argon\u00adkrypton laser. Fluorescence deriving from Rhod-2\nIntracellular ROS measurement\nIntracellular ROS levels were measured using the\n2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) assay. After\ntreatment, HUVECs were stained with 10\n(Beyotime, Haimen, China) for 30\nmin at 37\u00b0C in the dark,\nbefore being washed twice with PBS. ROS production was\nthen assessed using a fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Tokyo,\nJapan) with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) green filter\nnm excitation/emission). Fluorescence intensi-\nties were determined using ImageJ software.\nMeasurement of mitochondrial O\n- levels\nChanges in mitochondrial O\n- levels were measured using\nMitoSOX Red (Yeasen, Shanghai, China), which targets\nmitochondria and fluoresces when oxidized by O\n- .\nSubcultured HUVECs were loaded with MitoSOX Red,\nwhich was dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO)\nand used at a final concentration of 5\nmin\nat 37\u00b0C in the dark, and washed twice with PBS.\nMitochondrial O\n- levels were then assessed using a fluo-\nemission filters, respectively, and fluorescence intensities\nwere determined using ImageJ software.\nFlow cytometric analysis of EC apoptosis\nTo quantify HUVEC viability, cells were stained with both\nannexin V and propidium iodide (PI) using an Annexin\nV-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences,\nFranklin Lakes, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions. The proportion of apoptotic cells was deter-\nmined using a FACSAria instrument (BD Biosciences).\nWound-healing assay\nHUVECs were plated on six-well plates and grown over-\nnight to near confluence. A cell-free area was made in each\nwell by scraping a 10\n\u00b5L pipette tip across the cells, and\nculture was then continued. Images were taken 0, 18 and\n36h after creating the wounds, and cells migrating into the\ncell-free space were quantified.\nStatistical analysis\nData are expressed as means\u00b1SEM. Comparisons between\nmore than two groups were performed using one-way anal-\nysis of variances (ANOVAs) and a post hoc Tukey test.\nComparisons between two groups were performed using\nunpaired t-test. p-values <0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant. When individual studies are demonstrated, there\nare representative of at least three independent studies.\nResults\nEffects of glucose on MCU and MCUR1\nexpression in HUVECs\nAs shown in Figure 1, the lowest glucose concentration\nmM) slightly elevated MCU and MCUR1 mes-\nsenger RNA(mRNA) and protein expression in HUVECs,\nalthough this effect was not statistically significant.\nHowever, HG significantly increased both the mRNA\nand protein levels of MCU and MCUR1 in these cells\n(p<0.05) in a time-dependent manner.

Moreover,\ntotal ROS and mitochondrial O\n- levels in HUVECs\ntreated with HG were remarkably higher than in cells\nexposed to the NG and Mnt condition (p<0.05) (Figure\n2(b)). There was no significant difference in [Ca2+]mito,\n[Ca2+]cyt, total ROS and mitochondrial O\n- levels between\nNG and Mnt group (p>\nonly increased the expression of MCU and MCUR1 but\nalso resulted in heightened calcium and oxidative stress\nlevels in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of HUVECs.\nEffects of glucose on HUVEC apoptosis and\nwound healing\nAs shown in Figure 3(a), HUVEC apoptosis increased sig-\nnificantly following treatment with HG for 72\nh. In addi-\ntion, the degree of wound closure in the HG group was\nsignificantly lower than that in the NG and Mnt groups\n(Figure 3(b)). There was no significant difference in apop-\ntosis and wound healing between NG and Mnt groups\n(p>0.05) (Figure 3). These results suggest that HG expo-\nsure can impair ECs function.\nRole of MCU in hyperglycaemia induced\nincrease in HUVEC calcium and ROS levels\nTo explore the role of MCU in calcium and ROS changes in\nECs during hyperglycaemia, HUVECs were pre-treated for\n30min with RR or sper, which inhibits and activates MCU,\nrespectively, and exposed to HG for 72\nh. [Ca2+]mito was\nsignificantly reduced in the HG+RR group and elevated in\nthe HG\n+\nsper group (p<\n[Ca2+]cyt did not significantly differ following these treat-\nments, compared to the HG group.As shown in Figure 4(b),\nin comparison with HUVECs treated with HG only, total\nROS and mitochondrial O\n-\nlevels were significantly lower\nin cells treated HG+RR, and significantly higher in those\nexposed to HG+sper. These results demonstrate that MCU\nplays a crucial role in hyperglycaemia-induced mitochon-\ndrial calcium overload and oxidative stress in HUVECs.\nRoles of MCU in hyperglycaemia induced\nHUVEC apoptosis and compromised wound-\nhealing ability\nAs shown in Figure 5(a), compared to the HG group, apop-\ntosis was less frequent among HUVECs treated with\nRR and more frequent among those administered\nHG+sper. Also in comparison with the HG-treated group,\ngap closure was significantly accelerated and retarded by\nRR and HG\n+\nsper treatment, respectively. These\ndata indicate that MCU exerts an important effect on hyper-\nglycaemia-induced EC apoptosis and wound healing.\nDiscussion\nMitochondrial Ca2+ overload has been implicated as a criti-\ncal mediator of cellular dysfunction under hyperglycaemic\nconditions,7 but the key signalling events linking hypergly-\ncaemia with increased mitochondrial Ca2+ have so far\nremained elusive. Here, we demonstrate for the first time\nthat hyperglycaemia-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ overload\ndepends on MCU activation, leading to increased mitochon-\ndrial ROS levels and HUVEC dysfunction.\nFirst, our results showed that HG increased HUVEC\nMCU and MCUR1 expression at transcriptional and trans-\nlational levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner.\nMoreover, HG resulted in elevated Ca2+ and ROS levels\nin these cells, increased their rate of apoptosis and\nFigure 1.

Hyperglycaemia\nwas thus found to induce EC dysfunction, as reported in\nprevious studies.16,19 Furthermore, our data suggest that\nMCU and MCUR1 are upregulated in ECs after HG expo-\nsure, providing evidence for the role of the MCU complex\nin diabetic vascular diseases.\nMCU is a mitochondrial inner membrane uniporter that\nmediates mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+ and controls its con-\ncentration within this organelle.20 Previous studies have\nshown that excessive mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake has delete-\nrious effects, including ROS overproduction,21 sensitization\nto apoptosis,22 and activation of the permeability transition\npore and subsequent cell death pathways.23,24 Our results\ndemonstrate that hyperglycaemia results in increased MCU\nexpression and impaired cell function. However, little is\nknown of the significance of MCU in HG-induced EC dys-\nfunction. In order to address this gap in our knowledge, we\nexposed HUVECs to an inhibitor or an activator of MCU\nprior to HG treatment. The Ca2+ overload, heightened oxi-\ndative stress, increased apoptosis rate and decreased wound-\nhealing ability induced by hyperglycaemia, and these effects\nwere negated by MCU inhibition. Conversely, the MCU\nactivator spermine was found to exacerbate HG-induced EC\ndysfunction. These results support the conclusion that MCU\nis clearly an important mediator of the detrimental effects of\nHG on EC function.\nConsistent with previous results,25,26 we found MCU to\nbe associated with oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.\nKnocking down endogenous MCU has been shown to\ndecrease mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and attenuate the death\nof HeLa cells and primary cerebellar granule neurons result-\ning from oxidative stress.25 In addition, Sripetchwandee\net al.26 established that iron overload could result in cardiac\nmitochondrial dysfunction, including increased ROS pro-\nduction, membrane depolarization and swelling, and showed\nthat these effects could be prevented by MCU blockers.\nMCU is also necessary for store-operated Ca2+ entry-\ndependent breast cancer cell migration.27 Our results con-\nfirm an essential role for MCU in the Ca2+ overload that\nleads to deleterious consequences for ECs. However, further\ninvestigation is required to identify the signalling pathways\ndownstream of MCU involved in EC dysfunction.\nTo conclude, our study suggests that hyperglycaemia\nresults in enhanced expression of MCU and MCUR1,\nleading to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. Subsequent\nexcessive generation of ROS due to heightened mitochon-\ndrial activity may then eventually cause endothelial dys-\nfunction. We propose that MCU plays an important role in\nFigure 4.
