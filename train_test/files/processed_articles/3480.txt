Heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure and extubation time\nwere measured before drug administration, immediately after the end of drug administration,\n10 min after the end of drug administration, immediately after extubation and 5 min after\nextubation.\nResults: A total of 120 patients were included in the study (30 per group). Systolic and diastolic\narterial pressure and heart rate after drug administration were significantly lower in all three\ndexmedetomidine groups compared with controls. Extubation times in the 0.75 and 1.0 mg/kg\ndexmedetomidine groups were significantly longer than in the control group.\nConclusion: Intravenous infusion of 0.5 mg/kg dexmedetomidine 30 min before the end of surgery\nattenuated the haemodynamic responses during emergence without prolonging the extubation\ntime. Dexmedetomidine doses higher than 0.5 mg/kg did not exert additional positive effects on\ncardiovascular responses, but did significantly prolong the extubation time.\n",

The present study aimed to deter-\nmine the optimal dose of dexmedetomidine\nfor attenuating the haemodynamic response\nduring emergence from anaesthesia.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists\n(ASA) status I or II, scheduled for total\nlaparoscopic hysterectomy between August\nHospital, Catholic University of Korea,\nSuwon, South Korea, were enrolled.\nPatients with asthma, hypertension, dys-\nrhythmia, morbid obesity (body mass\nindex > 25 kg/m2) and those who required\ntransfusion during surgery were excluded\nfrom the study.\nPatients were randomly allocated in\nequal numbers to one of four groups:\ncontrol group S (saline), group D0.5\n(0.5 mg/kg dexmedetomidine), group\nThe group allocation and names were\ncoded and remained concealed until com-\npletion of the statistical analyses. Rando-\nmization was performed using a block\nrandomization technique with opaque\nsealed envelopes, performed by an anaes-\nthesiologist who was not involved in the\nanaesthetic management of the patients or\ndata collection. Random numbers were\ngrouped in blocks in an allocation ratio\nof 1:1 for the four study groups. Study\ndrugs were prepared by nurses who were\nnot involved in the study; all of the drugs\nwere diluted in a total volume of 50 ml\nnormal saline.\nAll patients provided written informed\nconsent. The study protocol was approved\nby the institutional review board of\nand listed on a World Health Organization-\nAnaesthesia induction and maintenance\nIn the operating room, routine monitoring\nwas performed, including blood pressure\nmeasurement, electrocardiography, pulse\noximetry and capnography. Anaesthesia\nwas induced with 2\u00ad2.5 mg/kg propofol\nand 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. After endotra-\ncheal intubation, anaesthesia was\nmaintained with 6\u00ad8 volume% desflurane\nand 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen.\nMechanical ventilation was adjusted to\nmaintain the end-tidal carbon dioxide par-\ntial pressure at 30\u00ad35 mmHg. During sur-\ngery, 6 ml/kg per h Ringer's lactate was\ninfused; if blood loss occurred, the equiva-\nlent volume of 6% hydroxyethyl starch was\nalso infused.\nIn all patients, intraoperative opioids\nwere not administered and local anaesthetic\nwas not infiltrated into the laparoscopic\nincision site.\nArterial blood pressure and heart rate\nthe preoperative values by increasing or\ndecreasing the concentration of desflurane\nduring surgery. Severe hypertension (defined\nas systolic arterial pressure [SAP]\n> 180 mmHg) or tachycardia (defined as\nheart rate > 100 beats/min lasting > 3 min)\nduring the extubation period that could not\nbe controlled by increasing the concentra-\ntion of desflurane were treated with intra-\nvenous 20 mg/kg nicardipine or 0.5 mg/kg\nesmolol, respectively. After administration\nof the study drug, hypotension (defined as\nintravenous bolus of ephedrine; bradycardia\n(defined as heart rate < 50 beats/min) was\ntreated with a 0.5-mg intravenous bolus\nof atropine.\nEmergence from anaesthesia\nApproximately 30 min before the antici-\npated completion of surgery, an anaesthesi-\nologist blind to the drug and group\nallocation administered the study drug\nintravenously over 10 min. In addition,\n0.5 mg/kg ketorolac tromethamine was\ngiven intravenously 10 min before the antici-\npated end of surgery; 5 min before the\nanticipated end of surgery the desflurane\nconcentration was decreased to 5 volume%.\nDesflurane was discontinued at the end of\nsurgery and the lungs were ventilated with\n100% oxygen. Residual neuromuscular\nblockade was reversed with 6 mg/kg glyco-\npyrrolate and 0.15 mg/kg pyridostigmine in\nall patients. Extubation was performed once\nthe patient was breathing spontaneously.\nHeart rate (HR), SAP and diastolic arter-\nial pressure (DAP) values were recorded\nbefore study drug administration, immedi-\nately after the end of drug administration,\n10 min after the end of drug administration,\nimmediately after extubation and 5 min after\nextubation. The extubation time was defined\nas the time between discontinuation of\ninhalation agents and extubation.\nStatistical analyses\nThe number of patients required in each\ngroup was determined using a power calcu-\nlation based on data from our preliminary\nstudy of dexmedetomidine and its influence\non the haemodynamic responses (unpub-\nlished). This calculation established that 30\npatients were required in each group for a\n\u00c1 \u00bc 18 and SD \u00bc 20 for the SAP parameter.\nRecruitment was increased by 10% to com-\npensate for unexpected loss.\nThe within-group data for SAP, DAP\nand HR were analysed using repeated-\nmeasures analysis of variance (ANOVA);\nbetween-group differences were analysed\nusing the Student's t-test. Comparisons\namong groups were made using covariance\nanalysis followed by Bonferroni post-hoc\ntesting. Extubation times were compared\nbetween groups using one-way ANOVA\nfollowed by Dunnett T3 post-hoc testing.\nA P-value < 0.05 was considered to be stat-\nistically significant. All statistical analyses\nwere performed using SPSS\u00d5 software, ver-\nsion 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\nResults\nA total of 132 patients were randomized into\nthe study. Of these, 12 were excluded due to\ntransfusion or change to open abdominal\nhysterectomy. Of the remaining patients, 30\npatients were allocated to each intervention\ngroup and received the allocated treatment\n(Figure 1). Baseline patient characteristics\nand the duration of surgery and anaesthesia\nwere similar in the four groups (Table 1).\nHypertension requiring treatment with\nnicardipine was observed in three patients\nin group S during extubation, but not in any\nof the dexmedetomidine groups. Tachycar-\ndia requiring treatment with esmolol\noccurred during extubation in significantly\nmore patients in group S than in\nthe dexmedetomidine groups (P < 0.05,\nTable 1). The number of patients who\nreceived ephedrine for hypotension after\nadministration of the study drug did not\ndiffer significantly among the four groups.\nHowever, significantly more patients in the\ntreat bradycardia after administration of the\nstudy drug compared with group S\nThe SAP was significantly lower in all\nthree dexmedetomidine groups compared\nwith group S at all times from 10 min after\nthe end of drug administration (P < 0.001,\nFigure 2).

The\nsecond, biphasic pressure effect involved a\nlonger lasting reduction in mean arterial\nblood pressure, with concomitant decreases\nin HR and cardiac output.21 Dexmedetomi-\ndine also reduced plasma noradrenaline\nlevels for >4 h at all four doses.21 In the\npresent study, dexmedetomidine was infused\nover 10 min, and no biphasic blood pressure\nresponses were seen, even with a dose of\n1.0 mg/kg.

In\naddition, Bicer et al.22 reported that patients\nwho received 1.0 mg/kg dexmedetomidine\ndemonstrated a prolonged extubation time\ncompared with a control group after sur-\ngery. In the present study, although extuba-\ntion times were prolonged in group D0.75\nand D1.0 compared with group S, these\ndoses may deserve consideration for provid-\ning haemodynamic stability throughout\nemergence and recovery in particular cir-\ncumstances (such as in patients with myo-\ncardial ischaemia).\nThe present study has a number of\nlimitations. First, because 0.5 mg/kg dexme-\ndetomidine was the lowest dose tested, it is\nnot possible to state that this is the min-\nimum required dose. Bloor et al.21 reported\ndetomidine decreased mean arterial blood\npressure by 14% and 16%, respectively, in\nhealthy volunteers. Therefore, a dexmede-\ntomidine dose <0.5 mg/kg may be sufficient\nto attenuate cardiovascular responses\nduring anaesthesia emergence. Secondly,\nthe occurrence of coughing or other\nairway reflexes was not investigated. The\npresence of the endotracheal tube leads to\nreflex responses, the most common of\nwhich is coughing, which can cause hyper-\ntension and tachycardia. Dexmedetomidine\nhas been reported to facilitate tolerance of\nthe endotracheal tube and to significantly\nreduce coughing during extubation.14\nThirdly, the sample population consisted\nof only young adult female patients who\nwere relatively healthy. It needs to be\ndetermined whether the present findings\ncan be generalized to male patients, and\nother age groups.\nIn conclusion, intravenous infusion of\nthe end of surgery attenuated haemo-\ndynamic responses during emergence, with-\nout prolonging the extubation time, in\npatients undergoing total laparoscopic hys-\nterectomy. Dexmedetomidine doses higher\nthan 0.5 mg/kg did not exert additional\npositive effects on the cardiovascular\nresponses, but did significantly prolong the\nextubation time.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nNone declared.\n*\n*\nTime (sec)\nFigure 5.
