Although prevalence rates vary de-\npending upon the definition applied, current population\nestimates indicate that about one fifth of adults over the age\nof 60 experience some degree of visual impairment (Eye\nDiseases Prevalence Research Group, 2004; Lighthouse\nSteinmetz, 2006). These impairments often result from age-\nrelated eye disorders that are less amenable to correction\nwith glasses or contact lenses, such as glaucoma, cataract,\nmacular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy (Prevent\nBlindness America, 2008). Although visually impaired\nolder adults generally retain some degree of residual vision\ning to visual impairment after a lifetime as a sighted person\nis a difficult experience (Brennan & Cardinali, 2000;\nindicated by research examining quality of life. Visually im-\npaired older adults score consistently lower than their unim-\npaired peers on two common indicators of quality of life:\nThey rate their life satisfaction lower and are between two\nand five times more likely to experience depression\n(DiNuzzo, Black, Lichtenstein, & Markides, 2001; Horowitz,\n1996). Concerns about the diminished quality of life of\nvisually impaired older adults are magnified by the adverse\noutcomes associated with low quality of life, including\npoorer physical health and increased risk of mortality\n(Lyyra, Tormakangus, Read, & Rantanen, 2006; Maier &\nAlthough the negative effects of visual impairment on\nquality of life are well documented, we know little about\nthe underlying mechanisms. Several mediating processes\nare suggested by studies reporting that greater visual im-\npairment is associated with having more activity limitations\nand fewer economic, social, and psychological resources\nVerbrugge & Patrick, 1995; Vu, Keeffe, McCarty, & Taylor,\n2005). However, few studies directly examine these associ-\nations as possible explanations for the lower quality of life\nof visually impaired older adults. The handful of studies\nthat have explored this issue focus on a single explanation\nrather than on a more comprehensive set that would allow\nan assessment of their relative contributions. Existing stud-\nies also are limited by their tendency to rely on relatively\nsmall nonrepresentative samples and cross-sectional data.\nOur study addresses these limitations by using two waves\nof nationally representative data to examine four potential\nexplanations for the negative impact of visual impairment\non quality of life, as indicated by depressive symptoms and\nlife satisfaction, among older adults. The explanations cen-\nter on the effect of visual impairment on activity limitations\nVisual Impairment and Quality of Life Among Older\nAdults: An Examination of Explanations for the\nRelationship\nRobyn Lewis Brown1 and Anne E. Barrett2\n1Department of Sociology, DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois.\n2Department of Sociology, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida.\nObjectives. We examine 4 potential explanations for the lower quality of life reported by older adults with greater visual\nimpairment.\nMethods. Using 2 waves of data from a nationally representative sample of older persons (a subsample of the Americans'\nChanging Lives Study, 1986 and 1989), we run residual change regression analysis to assess the extent to which the effect\nof visual impairment on quality of life, indicated by depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, is explained by changes in each\nof the following: (1) activity limitations; (2) socioeconomic resources, measured as income and financial strain; (3) social\nresources, indicated by social integration and perceived support; and (4) psychological resources, measured by self-efficacy.\nResults. Higher levels of visual impairment are associated with more depressive symptoms and lower life satisfaction\nover the 3-year period. Each hypothesized mediator plays a role in explaining the effect of visual impairment on declines\nin quality of life; however, the strongest mediating effects are found for self-efficacy.\nDiscussion. By identifying multiple pathways through which visual impairment diminishes quality of life among older\nadults, this study highlights the importance of multipronged intervention efforts.\nKey Words: Coping resources--Quality of life--Visual impairment.\nand economic, social, and psychological resources. Because\neach of these processes points to a different intervention ap-\nproach, clarifying our understanding of the underlying\nmechanisms is a precursor to enhancing the quality of life\nof visually impaired older adults.\nExplanations for the negative consequences of visual\nimpairment for quality of life\nThe influence of vision loss on activity limitations is one\npossible mechanism that reduces quality of life. Visual im-\npairments require a renegotiation of basic activities of daily\nlife, such as bathing and dressing, as well as instrumental\ntasks, like housekeeping and running errands. Compared\nwith other common age-related conditions, visual impair-\nment more strongly impacts the ability to carry out such\nVisually impaired older adults experience greater activity\nlimitations--and a steeper decline over time--than those\nwithout visual impairment (Brennan, Su, & Horowitz,\net al., 2002). Although these patterns suggest that increases\nin activity limitations may underlie the negative effect of\nvisual impairment on quality of life, this possibility has not\nbeen directly examined using large samples of adults with a\nwide range of visual functioning. However, studies using\nsmall samples of adults with visual impairments suggest\nthat activity limitations make a modest contribution to ex-\nplaining the diminished quality of life of visually impaired\nadults. For example, a longitudinal study using a sample of\n51 respondents diagnosed with bilateral age-related macu-\nlar degeneration revealed that the strength of the association\nbetween degree of visual impairment and depressive symp-\ntoms diminished with activity limitations controlled, but the\nrelationship remained significant (Rovner & Casten, 2002).\nVisual impairment also may reduce quality of life by\nchallenging one's economic security. Compared with the\nunimpaired, visually impaired individuals have lower in-\ncome and greater financial strain (Horowitz et al., 2005;\nTielsch et al., 1991)--factors that predict lower quality of\nSocioeconomic status (SES) is typically included in stud-\nies of visual impairment and quality of life, but, to our\nknowledge, it has not been examined as a potential media-\nit is treated as a control variable because financial con-\nstraints are a risk factor for visual impairment, as evidenced\nby the observation that common eye diseases are often un-\ndiagnosed or untreated among people of limited means\n(Horowitz et al., 2005; Horowitz, Brennan, & Reinhardt,\n2005). Though receiving less attention, the opposite causal\ndirection also seems likely: Visual impairment may prompt\nor exacerbate financial hardship. Research finds that the ef-\nfect of visual impairment on quality of life remains significant\nwith indicators of SES controlled (Congdon, Friedman, &\ntest of the mediating role of socioeconomic resources re-\nquires longitudinal data in order to disentangle the likely\nbidirectional relationship between visual impairment and\nsocioeconomic resources.\nA third explanation for the negative effect of visual im-\npairment on quality of life centers on social resources. Vi-\nsual impairment is associated with lower social integration\nand perceived support (Mitchell; the Australian National\nHealth and Medical Research Council, 2001; Reinhardt\nwell-being (Miech & Shanahan, 2000; Turner & Brown,\n2010). The challenges of maintaining supportive social ties\nare illustrated by research and personal accounts document-\ning frequent expressions of pity or sympathy toward people\nwith visual impairments, as well as social avoidance\nresources in explaining the diminished quality of life of\npeople with visual impairments may be modest. Providing\nsupport for this claim, a community study of Dutch older\nadults finds that social support does not account for the\ngreater psychological distress reported by people with vi-\nsual impairments compared with their unimpaired counter-\nparts (Ormel et al., 1997). This conclusion is limited,\nhowever, by two features of the study. It relies on cross-\nsectional rather than longitudinal data and does not present\nanalyses permitting the consideration of the unique mediating\nrole of social resources independent of personal resources\nand activity limitations. Research employing samples lim-\nited to persons with visual impairments also suggests that\nsocial resources account for only a modest portion of varia-\ntion in depressive symptoms. For example, a longitudinal\nstudy of 313 older adult applicants to a vision rehabilitation\nagency found that greater family support was associated with\nfewer depressive symptoms at baseline but was not associ-\nated with changes in depressive symptoms over a one-year\nperiod; in contrast, greater friend support predicted a decline\nin symptoms over time but was not associated with baseline\ndepressive symptoms (Reinhardt, Boerner, & Horowitz, 2009).\nSimilar to its impact on social resources, visual impair-\nment may reduce quality of life by diminishing psycholog-\nical resources such as self-efficacy--a concept referring to\nthe perceived ability to control one's life circumstances\n(Bandura, 1997). Persons with greater visual impairments\nreport less control over their life circumstances and envi-\nronment, which is associated with lower quality of life\ncross-sectional study of Dutch older adults previously\nmentioned indicates that self-efficacy partially mediates\nthe association between visual impairment and psycholog-\nical distress (Ormel et al., 1997), the analyses did not allow\nfor an examination of the explanatory contribution of this\npsychological resource relative to other potential media-\ntors. The explanatory capacity of self-efficacy receives\nadditional, albeit indirect, support from a study of older\nadults seeking vision rehabilitation services (n = 584),\nwhich finds that lower feelings of self-efficacy are associ-\nated with increased risk of subthreshold and major depres-\nsion (Horowitz, Reinhardt, & Kennedy, 2005). However,\nthe study did not consider the independent influence of\nself-efficacy, and because data were cross-sectional, it is\nnot clear whether declines in self-efficacy over time pro-\nvide a further explanation for reductions in quality of life\namong people with visual impairments.\nIn summary, studies documenting the negative effect of\nvisual impairment on activity limitations and the avail-\nability of socioeconomic, social, and psychological re-\nsources point to several pathways generating diminished\nquality of life among visually impaired older adults. How-\never, few studies directly examine potential explanations\nfor the effect of visual impairment on quality of life, and\nnone of those of which we are aware examine the relative\ncontributions of multiple explanations. Studies also are\nlimited by their tendency to use data drawn from small\nnonrepresentative samples comprised entirely of persons\nwith visual impairments (e.g., Reinhardt et al., 2009;\nRovner & Casten, 2002). Although such examinations are\nuseful for understanding within-group variation among\npeople with visual impairments, they provide limited in-\nsight into the mechanisms generating diminished quality\nof life among those with visual impairments--compared\nwith their unimpaired counterparts. Another limitation is\nintroduced by the reliance of most studies on cross-\nsectional data (e.g., Horowitz et al., 2005; Horowitz,\nvents an examination of changes not only in quality of life\nover time but also activity limitations and resources that\nmay influence them. Addressing these limitations, we ex-\namine four potential explanations for the diminished qual-\nity of life of visually impaired older adults using two\nwaves of a nationally representative sample followed over\na three-year period. We test the following three hypotheses\n(with each referring to effects net of control variables):\nHypothesis 1: Compared with their less impaired coun-\nterparts, older adults with greater visual impairment report\nlower quality of life and greater decline in quality of life\nbetween the two waves.\nHypothesis 2: Compared with their less impaired coun-\nterparts, older adults with greater visual impairment report\nmore functional limitations and fewer socioeconomic, so-\ncial, and psychological resources. They also report greater\nincreases in functional impairment and greater declines in\nthese resources over the two waves.\nHypothesis 3: The negative effect of visual impairment\non quality of life is partially mediated by each of the follow-\ning factors: functional limitations and socioeconomic, so-\ncial, and psychological resources. Collectively, these factors\naccount for the negative effect of visual impairment on\nquality of life.\nDesign and Methods\nData\nData are drawn from the first two waves (T1 and T2) of\nthe nationally representative Americans' Changing Lives\nwho were between 60 and 96 years at T1. The lower age\nboundary was derived from evidence indicating that beyond\n60 years the prevalence of visual impairment increases sub-\nstantially among White--and particularly among African\nAmerican--older adults (Eye Diseases Prevalence Re-\nsearch Group, 2004). The baseline study implemented a\nmultistage stratified area probability sampling strategy with\nAfrican Americans and individuals over 60 sampled at\ntwice the rate of their counterparts. The second wave had a\nsuccess rate of 73% among this sample. Although two addi-\ntional waves of data were later conducted (in 1994 and\n2006), we limit our analyses to the first two waves of the\nstudy because of the large number of cases lost after T2.\nMore than 40% of the respondents aged 60 years or older at\nT1 did not complete the T3 survey, and more than 75% did\nRespondents with missing or incomplete data at T2 (n =\n448) and those of race\u00adethnic groups other than White or\nAfrican American (n = 25) are excluded from analyses.\nOmitted respondents reported significantly more depressive\nsymptoms, lower life satisfaction, and greater visual impair-\nment at T1 than those included in the study sample. These\npatterns suggest that our results may underestimate the ef-\nfects of visual impairment on quality of life.\nMeasures\nSummary statistics for all study variables are found in\nTable 1. We examine two indicators of quality of life that\nhave been argued to assess different dimensions: (1) depres-\nsive symptoms, based on psychiatric standards of life qual-\nity and (2) life satisfaction, viewed as an overall assessment\nof life experiences (Campbell, 1981; Campbell, Converse,\nconceptually similar, depressive symptoms reflect present\nemotional affect, whereas life satisfaction represents more\nstable and cognitive dimensions of life quality (George,\nThe depressive symptoms measure is an abbreviated\nform of the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies\u00ad\nDepression scale (National Center for Health Statistics,\nhigh reliability (a =.83) and produces results similar to the\nfull scale (National Center for Health Statistics, 1980). Re-\nspondents were asked how often in the past week they felt\neach of the following (with responses of hardly ever, some\nof the time, or most of the time): depressed, that everything\nwas an effort, sleep was restless, happy, lonely, that people\nwere unfriendly, enjoyed life, poor appetite, sad that people\ndisliked me and that I couldn't get \"going.\" Life satisfaction\nis assessed by responses to the question, \"Now please think\nabout your life as a whole. How satisfied are you with it?\"\nResponses range from not at all satisfied (1) to completely\nsatisfied (5). Prior research indicates that this single-item\nmeasure is consistent with multiple-item life satisfaction\nOur focal independent variable is visual impairment, mea-\nsured at T1. The Americans' Changing Lives Study uses\ntwo items to assess self-reported visual impairment. The\nfirst item asks whether respondents use a visual aid (1 = yes,\n0 = no). Those answering affirmatively are asked how well\nthey can see even with a visual aid--not at all well, not too\nwell, somewhat well, quite well, or very well. Using the\nsame five response categories, those who do not use a visual\naid are asked how well they can see. We elected to combine\nthese measures because the majority of the sample (94.5%)\nreport using some forms of visual aid; but, we control for\nthe use of visual aids in all analyses (see control variables\nbelow). Higher scores on the visual impairment indicator\nreflect greater self-assessed impairment. It should be noted\nthat self-report measures of visual impairment used in survey\nresearch are found to describe visual impairment less precisely\nthan clinical measures (for a review, see Horowitz, 2004).\nHowever, because visual acuity is only one aspect of visual\nfunction, self-assessments may provide a fuller understand-\ning of functional visual status (Horowitz, 2004; Smeeth &\nIliffe, 1998). We note that visual impairment was not as-\nsessed at the second wave, thus preventing an examination\nof change in vision over time. We also note that additional\nanalyses were conducted examining visual impairment as a\ndichotomous variable (coded 1 for not at all well and not\ntoo well and 0 for somewhat well, quite well, and very well\nin response to the question of how well one can see). Re-\nsults did not differ substantively from those using the indi-\ncator capturing the full range of responses (i.e., visual\nimpairment predicts lower quality of life and the pattern of\nmediation is similar). We retain the continuous measure to\nprovide a clearer understanding of the association between\ndegree of visual impairment and changes in quality of life.\nWe explore four sets of potential mediators of the effect\nof visual impairment on quality of life. For each, we exam-\nine baseline (T1) levels of these factors, as well as changes\nin levels from T1 to T2 (D Variable = T2 Value - T1 Value).\nHigher values on the change measure reflect greater change\nfrom T1 to T2, with positive values reflecting increases and\nnegative values reflecting decreases. The t tests of differ-\nences between mean values from T1 to T2, as reported in\nTable 1, reveal several significant differences: On average,\nincome, social integration, and self-efficacy declined,\nwhereas financial strain increased.\nActivity limitations are assessed by a standardized index\n(a =.84) drawn from 12 items that gauge ability to perform\nactivities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities\nof daily living (IADLs). The ADLs include tasks related to\nself-care, such as bathing, dressing, and grooming; IADLs\ninclude tasks that one must be able to perform in order to\nlive independently, such as housekeeping, grocery shop-\nping, and meal preparation. Responses were none, a little,\nsome, a lot, or cannot do (coded 0 to 4).\nSocioeconomic resources are assessed by two measures--\nincome and financial strain. Total household income before\nhigher. Responses were coded to the midpoint of each cate-\ngory, and means were imputed for missing cases (n = 311).\nFinancial strain is a standardized index (a =.79) using three\nitems assessing how difficult they found their financial situ-\nation, meeting monthly payments on bills, and their finances\nworking out at the end of the month. Responses ranged\nfrom not difficult (0) to extremely difficult (4).\nSocial resources are measured by two indices: social\nintegration and perceived support. Social integration is a\nstandardized index (a = .74) summing responses to four\nitems--two tapping informal social integration (i.e., fre-\nquency of visiting with friends and talking on the telephone\nwith friends, neighbors, or relatives) and two measuring\nTable 1. Means and Standard Deviations of Variables (N = 1,221)\nCharacteristics Range M (SD)\nDepressive symptoms\nLife satisfaction\nActivity limitations\nEconomic resources\nSocial resources\nPersonal resources\nControl variables\nNote: *significant at .01; **significant at .001 (two-tailed t test of mean\ndifferences in T1 and T2 variables).\nformal social integration (i.e., frequency of attendance at\nchurch or club/organization meetings and frequency of vol-\nunteering). Responses to each item range from never (0) to\nmore than once a day (5). Perceived support is a standard-\nized index (a =.72) that sums responses to six items assess-\ning the extent to which friends or relatives make the\nrespondent feel loved and cared for. Responses to each item\nrange from not at all (0) to a great deal (4).\nOur psychological resource measure, self-efficacy, is a\nstandardized index based on the degree to which respon-\ndents disagree or agree with five statements: \"All in all, I\nam inclined to feel that I am a failure\"; \"I can do just about\nanything I set my mind to\"; \"Sometimes I feel that I am\nbeing pushed around in life\"; \"There is really no way I can\nsolve the problems I have\"; and \"At times I think I am no\ngood at all.\" Responses--ranging from strongly agree (0) to\nstrongly disagree (3)--were coded so that higher values\nreflect greater self-efficacy. The Cronbach's alpha for this\nindex (.69) is at the threshold of acceptability. We retain\nthis measure because evidence of its validity and reliability\nhas been reported (e.g., House, Lantz, & Herd, 2005;\nMaciejewski, Prigerson, & Mazure, 2000). Providing further\nsupport for the construct's validity, our data reveal patterns\nconsistent with research using other samples. Lower self-\nefficacy is associated with reporting more depressive symp-\ntoms, lower life satisfaction, and greater visual impairment\n(e.g., Ormel et al., 1997). Patterns consistent with those\nobserved in other samples also are found for the social distri-\nbution of self-efficacy, such as lower self-efficacy among\nwomen and those of lower SES (e.g., Turner & Roszell, 1994).\nControl variables include sociodemographic characteris-\ntics, use of a visual aid, chronic conditions, and baseline\nmeasures of quality of life. Sociodemographic characteris-\ntics are age (years, ranging from 60 to 96), gender (1 =\nwomen, 0 = men), race/ethnicity (1 = African American, 0 =\nWhite), and education (number of years of school com-\npleted, ranging from 0 to 17). The use of a visual aid is a\ndichotomous variable (1 = yes, 0 = no). Chronic conditions\nare indicated by a count of the following 10 conditions cur-\nrently experienced: arthritis or rheumatism; lung disease;\nhypertension; heart disease, heart attack, or other heart trou-\nble; diabetes or high blood sugar; cancer or malignant tu-\nmors; circulation problems; stroke; fractured or broken\nbones; and bladder problems/incontinence. Baseline mea-\nsures of depressive symptoms and life satisfaction (col-\nlected at T1) are measured using items identical to those\ntapping these dimensions of quality of life at T2. An exam-\nination of the latent roots and latent vectors of a pairwise\ncorrelation matrix including all study variables and variance\ninflation factors provided no evidence of multicollinearity.\nAnalytic Strategy\nWe use residual change regression models (Allison,\nvisual impairment at T1 on changes in quality of life from\nT1 to T2. In order to investigate potential explanations for\nthis effect, we compare the coefficient and level of signifi-\ncance for visual impairment before and after the hypothe-\nsized mediator is added to the model, with a reduction in the\nmagnitude of the effect of visual impairment on quality of\nlife providing support for the mediational hypothesis. We\nuse Sobel\u00adGoodman tests to formally assess the extent to\nwhich a mediator carried the influence of visual impairment\nto quality of life (MacKinnon & Dwyer, 1993; Mackinnon,\nWe present six regression models for each of the two in-\ndicators of quality of life. Model 1 regresses the dependent\nvariables (i.e., depressive symptoms and life satisfaction at\nT2) on the T1 measures of visual impairment, use of a vi-\nsual aid, age, gender, race\u00adethnicity, education, and chronic\nconditions. It also includes T1 measures of quality of life in\norder to assess the influence of visual impairment on\nchanges in quality of life from T1 to T2. Models 2 through\n5 each include a hypothesized mediator. Model 6 includes\nall variables entered in previous models in order to assess\ntheir collective role in explaining the effect of visual impair-\nment on change in quality of life.\nResults\nAs part of our examination of whether the Sobel\u00adGoodman\ncriteria for mediation are met (Mackinnon et al., 1995;\nPreacher & Hayes, 2004), we conducted ordinary least\nsquares (OLS) regression predicting each of the hypothe-\nsized mediators as a function of visual impairment, use of\na visual aid, age, gender, race\u00adethnicity, education, and\nchronic conditions. These analyses, presented in Table 2,\nreveal that visual impairment is significantly associated\nwith each of the following hypothesized mediators at T1:\nactivity limitations, income, financial strain, social integra-\ntion, and self-efficacy. Visual impairment also is a signifi-\ncant predictor of change fromT1 toT2 in activity limitations,\nfinancial strain, social integration, and self-efficacy. Each\nof these associations is in the expected direction: Greater\nvisual impairment predicts more limitations and financial\nstrain and fewer resources. The finding that visual impair-\nment predicts increases in financial strain is also noteworthy\nbecause it provides support for the argument that visual im-\npairment influences financial hardship rather than simply\nbeing a consequence of it.\nTable 3 presents the results of OLS regression analyses\nexamining the effect of visual impairment (ba) on depres-\nsive symptoms. Net of the control variables and baseline\nmeasure of depressive symptoms, greater visual impairment\nsignificantly predicts an increase in depressive symptoms\nover the three-year period (Model 1). We note that use of a\nvisual aid is not significantly associated with change in de-\npressive symptoms.\nModels 2 through 5 test our hypothesized mediators of\nthe influence of visual impairment on change in depressive\nsymptoms. Model 2 reveals that baseline levels and in-\ncreases in activity limitations significantly predict increases\nin symptoms between the waves, and they jointly account\nfor about 28% of the relationship between visual impair-\nment and depressive symptoms. Additional analyses (not\npresented) indicate that each accounts for about half of the\nobserved mediating effect. Model 3 demonstrates that\nhigher baseline levels and increases in financial strain are\nassociated with more symptoms and they collectively ex-\nplain about 12% of the influence of visual impairment on\nTable 2.

Mediation tests of each economic re-\nsource (not shown) reveal that baseline financial strain ac-\ncounts for the majority of this effect. Model 4, which\nexamines social resources, indicates that higher baseline\nlevels and increases in social integration predict declines in\nsymptoms between waves. Separate tests show that baseline\nlevels and increases in social integration play nearly equal\nroles in explaining the elevated symptoms of more visually\nimpaired older adults. Contrary to a large body of research\n(e.g., Turner & Brown, 2010), we do not find that perceived\nsupport significantly predicts depressive symptoms. How-\never, we note that cross-sectional analyses using the first\nwave (not presented) indicate that perceived support pre-\ndicts depressive symptoms with the effects of visual impair-\nment, social integration, and the control variables held\nconstant. Of the mediators that we examined, psychological\nresources play a largest role in accounting for the elevated\ndepressive symptoms of the visually impaired (Model 5).\nHigher baseline levels and increases in self-efficacy are as-\nsociated with declines in symptoms and account for about\n35% of the association between visual impairment and\nchange in depressive symptoms. When the collective contri-\nbution of the four hypothesized mediators is considered\n(Model 6), the coefficient for visual impairment is reduced\nby 64% and does not reach significance.\nTable 4 presents the results of the regression of life satis-\nfaction on visual impairment. Greater visual impairment\npredicts a decrease in life satisfaction from T1 to T2 (Model\n1). We also note that using visual aids emerges as a signifi-\ncant variable; it predicts increases in life satisfaction be-\ntween the waves. Model 2 demonstrates that activity\nlimitations and changes in activity limitations--both signif-\nicant predictors of declines in life satisfaction--explain\nabout 26% of the relationship between visual impairment\nand change in life satisfaction, with further tests (not pre-\nsented) revealing that baseline impairment plays a larger\nrole. Turning to economic resources, 38% of the relationship\nbetween visual impairment and change in life satisfaction is\nexplained by the effect of financial strain (Model 3). Sepa-\nrate mediation tests (not shown) reveal that financial strain\naccounts for the largest proportion of this effect. Model 4\nreveals that the positive effects of social integration and per-\nceived support and increases in social integration on life sat-\nisfaction account for 33% of the effect of visual impairment\non change in life satisfaction over the three-year period.\nSeparate analyses (not shown) reveal near-equivalent medi-\nating effects of baseline level and change in social integra-\ntion. Of the four sets of explanations that we examined, the\nstrongest effects are found for psychological resources. Both\ninitial levels and changes in self-efficacy are significant pre-\ndictors of quality of life (Model 5). With self-efficacy con-\ntrolled, the effect of visual impairment on change in life\nsatisfaction declines by 61% and is no longer significant,\nwith further tests (not presented) revealing that nearly all of\nthis effect is explained by baseline level of self-efficacy. In\nModel 6, which includes all variables entered in previous\nmodels, the effect of visual impairment on change in life\nsatisfaction declines by 97% and fails to reach significance.\nTable 4.

Furthermore, none of the studies\ndirectly testing explanations for this relationship examine\nmultiple processes or employ longitudinal data. Drawing on\nprevious research documenting the associations of visual\nimpairment with activity limitations and economic, social,\nand psychological resources, we examine each of these sets\nof factors as a potential explanation for the lower quality of\nlife of visually impaired older adults. We explore these pos-\nsibilities using a two-wave panel study of a nationally rep-\nresentative sample of adults aged 60\u00ad96 years.\nOur findings provide further evidence of the negative ef-\nfect of visual impairment on quality of life and a range of\nfactors that influence it. Consistent with previous work and\nsupporting our first hypothesis, we find significantly greater\ndeclines in quality of life, as indicated by more depressive\nsymptoms and lower life satisfaction, among older adults\nwho report a greater degree of visual impairment. Our re-\nsults also support our second hypothesis. We find that expe-\nriencing greater visual impairment is significantly associated\nwith more activity limitations and fewer socioeconomic, so-\ncial, and psychological resources at baseline. In addition,\ngreater visual impairment significantly predicts increases in\nactivity limitations and financial strain and declines in so-\ncial integration and self-efficacy over three years.\nWe elaborate on prior studies of visual impairment by\nexamining multiple processes that may contribute to re-\nduced quality of life. The results for depressive symptoms\nand life satisfaction support our third hypothesis predicting\nthat the negative effect of visual impairment on change in\nquality of life is partially mediated by each of the following\nfactors: activity limitations and economic, social, and psy-\nchological resources. We further hypothesized that these\nfactors collectively explain the negative effect of visual im-\npairment on quality of life. We find that these factors ex-\nplain 64% of the effect of visual impairment on depressive\nsymptoms and 97% of its effect on life satisfaction. With\nthese four sets of factors included in the models, visual im-\npairment significantly predicts neither depressive symp-\ntoms nor life satisfaction.\nAlthough we find some evidence to support each of the\nfour processes we examined, the results reveal that their\ncontributions to explaining the lower quality of life of more\nvisually impaired older adults, compared with their less im-\npaired counterparts, vary. Self-efficacy plays the largest me-\ndiating role. It accounts for about 35% of the effect of visual\nimpairment on depressive symptoms and over 60% of the\neffect on life satisfaction. Considerably smaller--though\nsignificant--mediating effects are observed for other expla-\nnations that we examined. However, the magnitude of these\neffects differed for depressive symptoms and life satisfac-\ntion. Our findings suggest that economic and social re-\nsources play larger roles in explaining the effect of visual\nimpairment on more stable and cognitively based appraisals,\nsuch as life satisfaction, compared with more emotional di-\nmensions of life quality, as indicated by depressive symp-\ntoms. An exception is found for activity limitations, which\nnearly equally account for the effects of visual impairment\non depressive symptoms and life satisfaction.\nThese patterns have implications for interventions aimed\nat increasing the quality of life of older adults with visual\nimpairments. In general, our findings suggest the value of\npursuing multiple interventions that improve physical func-\ntioning, economic circumstances, social involvement, and,\nparticularly, perceptions of control over one's life. How-\never, they also reveal that interventions may have different\ndegrees of success for reducing depressive symptoms com-\npared with enhancing life satisfaction. Assessments of life\nsatisfaction, given their more cognitive than emotional na-\nture, may be more strongly impacted by efforts to improve\nthe structural features of the lives of visually impaired older\nadults, such as reducing financial strain and providing op-\nportunities for greater social integration. Consistent with\nthis conclusion, we find that use of visual aids is associated\nwith improvements in life satisfaction but not depressive\nsymptoms. Although our study suggests that improving\nstructural conditions is important, particularly to enhancing\nlife satisfaction, the findings also imply that intervention ef-\nforts will be limited if they fail to consider more subjective\naspects of living with a visual impairment--particularly its\neffect on one's sense of personal agency.\nOur study contributes to the literature by identifying mul-\ntiple pathways through which the quality of life of visually\nimpaired older adults may be improved; however, its limita-\ntions should be noted. Although this represents the first at-\ntempt (of which we are aware) to explore multiple\nexplanations for the visual impairment--quality of life as-\nsociation using longitudinal data, our study includes only\ntwo waves and spans just three years. Across the explana-\ntions we examined, we find that in some instances, baseline\nlevels (i.e., of activity limitations and resources) exert stron-\nger mediating effects than do changes over the study period,\nwhereas in other cases, the reverse is true. These patterns\nshould be reexamined using data following adults over a\nlonger span of time. We also are limited in our ability to\nassess change in visual impairment over time. Common\nage-related eye disorders, such as glaucoma, cataract, and\nmacular degeneration, tend to be associated with a gradual\ncourse of decline (Harvey, 2003). As a result, we may be\nunderestimating the extent to which visual impairment re-\nduces quality of life over time. The ability to consider\nchanges in visual impairment also would allow for a clearer\nassessment of the potentially bidirectional relationship of\nvisual impairment and economic resources. We find that\ngreater visual impairment predicts increases in financial\nstrain but is unable to determine whether financial strain in-\nfluences degree of visual impairment.Another possible con-\ncern is that our data were collected two decades ago. We do\nnot believe that this limitation renders our study irrelevant\nfor understanding the association between visual impairment\nand quality of life because, while there have been some ad-\nvances in the treatment of aging-related eye disorders (most\nnotably for the treatment of cataract; Harvey, 2003), visual\nimpairment remains a common problem and the use of aids\ndoes not eliminate its negative effect on quality of life.\nIn addition to examining effects of visual impairment on\nquality of life as they unfold over a longer time span, future\nresearch should examine whether the strength of the effects\nor underlying processes vary across segments of the elderly\npopulation. Sources of potential variation include gender,\nrace\u00adethnicity, and SES, as well as the community-dwelling\npopulation compared with nursing home residents; each of\nthese contrasts points to variation in levels of resources\nto address challenges faced in later life, including visual\nimpairment.\n"
