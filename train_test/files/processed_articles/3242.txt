Introduction\nThis paper sets out to help explain the empirical puzzle, why estimates of asset corre-\nlations based on equity prices tend to be considerably higher than correlation estimates\nfrom default rates. Since correlation estimates arguably constitute the most important\nfactor driving the credit risk of a loan portfolio, sorting out the empirical puzzle is highly\nimportant for credit risk modelling.\nWe explore the hypothesis that the empirical puzzle is created by different statistical\nproperties of the estimation methodologies which are applied dependent on the type of\nhistorical data. More specificly, we ask if the downward bias of correlation estimates that\nhas already been detected in previous work by Gordy and Heitfield (2000) offers a sufficient\nexplanation for the observed differences in estimates. Furthermore, our results allow to\nquantify this downward bias dependent on the risk characteristics of credit portfolios.\nIn order to measure a potential downward bias in the estimates of asset correlations, we\ncarry out a clinical simulation study. This setup avoids typical limitations of comparing\nasset correlation estimates from historical default rates and equity returns. More precisely,\nthe sample of firms for which stock prices are available is typically too small for a meaning-\nful comparison with the corresponding default rates because default events are rare. Even\nif default rates are available for a sufficiently large sample of firms, this sample typically\nincludes non-listed firms which precludes estimating their asset correlation from equity\nreturns. The key advantage of a simulation study instead is the possibility to estimate\ncorrelations from stock prices and default rates consistently since both time series are\ngenerated by the same data generating process (DGP), based on the same Merton-type\nmodel.\nIt is not obvious from the outset if the estimation from stock prices or from default rates\nis more efficient. On the one hand defaults are rare events which require a longer time\ninterval between two observation dates compared to equity data which are available on\na daily basis. As a consequence, time series of default rates are based on yearly counted\n1We have benefited from comments by Thilo Liebig, Christoph Memmel, Peter Raupach, Marliese Uhrig-\nHomburg and participants of the Annual International Conference of the German Operations Research\nSociety (GOR) in Karlsruhe 2006 and the seminar on \"Banking Supervision and Financial Stability\" at the\nDeutsche Bundesbank.\ndefaults and often contain not more than ten to twenty observations. As they cover a\nrelatively long time period, they are vulnerable to regime shifts, for example structural\nbreaks in the evolution of the economy or the introduction of a new bankruptcy code. On\nthe other hand trading activities can generate additional noise in the stock prices. In this\ncase, correlation estimates based on market prices may be perturbed by factors unrelated\nto credit risk, for example a sudden drop in the demand or the supply of assets.\nFor the estimation of asset correlations from stock prices we employ the usual estimation\nmethodologies from the literature. In the case of correlation estimation from default rates,\nvarious methodologies have been applied in the literature. The most general approach\nwould be to use model-free estimation techniques, employed first by Lucas (1995) and\nlater refined by De Servigny and Renault (2002). However, it has been noted, for example\nby Gordy and Heitfield (2000), that a model-based estimation may provide more efficient\nestimates, given the model describes the true DGP well enough. Therefore, we employ\nthe asymptotic single risk factor (ASRF) model2 which is consistent with a Merton-type\nmodel and which has gained great popularity as theoretic foundation of the internal ratings\nbased approach in the Basel II framework.3\nIn order to avoid an inadvertently preferential treatment of stock returns, perturbations of\nstock prices from factors unrelated to credit risk are accounted for in a robustness check.\nFor this purpose we assume that the asset correlations follow a stochastic process. More\nprecisely, we introduce mean-reverting asset correlations as model error in the stock re-\nturns while still employing an estimation methodology based on a Merton-type model that\nassumes constant correlations. Although this model error affects also the estimation from\ndefault rates, we expect that its impact is smaller than for equity prices. Therefore, this\nprocedure should provide a more realistic comparison between the correlation estimation\nfrom default rates and from stock prices.\nGrundke (2007) includes a comprehensive overview of the existing empirical work on the\nestimation of asset correlations. Numerous empirical studies have so far produced quite\ndiverse results. De Servigny and Renault (2002) compare sample default correlations and\ndefault correlations inferred from a factor model, which uses empirical equity correlations\nas proxies for the asset correlation. They find that the link between both default correlation\nestimates, although positive as expected, is rather weak, which adds to the puzzle that\n3See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2005). The ASRF model provides under certain as-\nsumptions an asymptotic justification that capital charges for single exposures are portfolio invariant as\nthey add up to the capital charge of the total portfolio. For the purpose of estimating asset correlations\nwe do not need this asymptotic argument but we still refer to the model as the ASRF model because it\nhas become widely known under this name.\nwe intend to explain. The result is robust against replacing the Gaussian copula by a\nt\u00adcopula. Furthermore, the volatility of the riskless interest rates appears not to have\na direct impact on asset correlations. The authors neither give an explanation for the\nweak link between default rate based and stock price based correlation estimates nor do\nthey test the assumption that equity correlations are good proxies for asset correlations.\nRoesch (2003) reports to our knowledge the lowest estimates of asset correlations which\nare estimated from default frequencies of German corporates in a factor model and vary\nemploy a similar sample of German firms but differentiated between buckets characterized\nby size and default probability. The correlation estimates for the buckets considerably\nvary between one and fourteen percent. Dietsch and Petey (2004) use samples of French\nand German firms and obtain results which are between those of Roesch and those of\nDuellmann and Scheule.\nLopez (2002) instead estimates asset correlations from stock prices. For this purpose he\nemploys a version of the ASRF model which is calibrated to the multi-factor model of\nthe KMV Portfolio Manager software. His correlation estimates for a sample of medium\nand large US corporates lie between 10 and 26 percent. These asset correlation levels are\nconfirmed by Zeng and Zhang (2001) and D\u00a8\nullmann et al. (2007), both also estimating\nfrom KMV data. In the Basel II framework the asset correlation parameter depends on\nthe probability of default (PD) and for medium-size corporate borrowers also on firm\nsize. Depending on the PD and neglecting the regulatory firm size adjustment, the asset\ncorrelation varies between twelve and twenty four percent. Although the asset correlation\nis a supervisory set parameter, it was originally calibrated to the economic capital of credit\nportfolios of large international banks which motivates their inclusion in the list of previous\nempirical results.\nIn summary the above mentioned empirical studies show that correlation estimates vary\nconsiderably. They are usually higher if they are based on stock prices than if they are\nbased on default rates. In this paper we will explore possible explanations for this result.\nOur results may give guidance in which circumstances equity returns and in which default\nrates are more appropriate for the estimation of asset correlations. Finding that differences\nin estimation methodologies cannot explain the variation in the correlation estimates would\nsuggest that the previously observed differences are instead caused by other reasons, for\nexample, by sample mismatches.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the Merton-type credit risk\nmodel together with the DGP both for the stock prices as well as for the time series of\n4Modelling the (unconditional) default probabilities as time-varying and driven by macroeconomic fac-\ntors may have contributed to the relatively low correlation estimates.\ndefault rates. The model and the DGP form the basis of our simulation study. Section 3\ncomprises the estimation from stock prices and default rates. The simulation results\nincluding a comparison of the estimation methodologies and an analysis of a model error\nin the form of stochastic asset correlations are presented in Section 4. Section 5 summarizes\nand concludes.\n2. Simulation Model and DGP\nSelecting the Merton Model as the underlying model of the DGP is motivated by the fact\nthat it provides a structural link between default events and stock price returns. More\nspecificly we use a multi-firm extension of the Merton (1974) model with N identical\nfirms. Furthermore, this extension is consistent with the ASRF model.5 Later, the model\nis perturbed by a model error due to stochastic correlations in the DGP.\n2.1. Asset Value Model and Data Generating Process\nIn the following we consider a portfolio of N homogenous firms. In the Merton (1974)\nmodel the asset value of every firm i is assumed to follow under the physical measure P a\ngeometric Brownian motion of the form\ndVi,t = \u00b5Vi,t dt + Vi,t dWi,t, (1)\nwhere Vi,t denotes the asset value at time t of firm i, \u00b5 the drift and  the volatility\nparameter of the stochastic process. Since we assume all firms to be homogenous, \u00b5,  and\nthe initial firm value Vi,0 = V0 are identical for every firm. In order to capture dependencies\nbetween firms, the Brownian motion Wi,t is decomposed into two independent Brownian\nmotions, a common systematic risk factor Xt and and a firm-specific risk factor Bi,t:\ndWi,t =\n\n dXt + 1 -  dBi,t. (2)\nEquation (2) gives the standard representation of a single factor model and explains why\nthe parameter  is commonly referred to as the asset correlation. Note that the model\nassumes that the asset correlation  is the same for all pairs of firms. This assumption\nis typical for empirical studies as it allows this parameter to be estimated from a cross\nsection of firms.\nSimulating the time-continuous asset value process requires an appropriate discretisation.\nThe common Euler scheme only gives good numerical results if the drift of the diffusion\ncoefficients is constant. Since we allow later on for stochastic correlations, the use of a\nhigher order scheme is recommended.6 Starting with constant correlation, the asset value\nof firm i at time t + t is defined as follows:\nVi,t+t = Vi,t + Vi,t(r + )t + Vi,t \n\nt Wi,t + Vi,t\ni,t\nwith Wi,t =\n\nXt + 1 - Bi,t.\nIn Merton-type models, the equity value Ei(Vi,t, h) of firm i at time t represents a call\noption on the firm's asset value Vi,t with the time to maturity h. It's value is given by the\nwell-known Black and Scholes (1973) formula:\nEi(Vi,t, h) = Vi,t (d1) - e-r hD (d2) (4)\nlog Vi,t\nD\n\n\nh\n\nh.\nWhile the asset values are simulated from the DGP given by equation (3), the corre-\nsponding equity values, which are the basis of the correlation estimation, are inferred from\nequation (4).\nEquation (4) requires that the riskless short-term interest rate r is deterministic. This\nimplicit assumption can be motivated inter alia by the findings of De Servigny and Re-\nnault (2002) that interest rate volatility does not significantly affect asset correlations, the\nestimation of which is the purpose of our study. The risk horizon h is set to one year in\nthe simulation study following common risk management practice. A constant debt value\nD is justified as this variable is used as a calibration parameter to achieve a given PD of\nthe firm. Since all firms are homogeneous in terms of PD, D is also constant.\n2.2. Simulation of Default Events\nThe default rates need to be simulated in line with the DGP from the previous subsection.\nFor this purpose, they are based on a portfolio of N borrowers whose asset values follow\nthe DGP given by equation (3). Borrower-dependent PDs can negatively affect correlation\nestimates as standard models assume some kind of PD homogeneity across borrowers. In\norder to study the best case in terms of estimation accuracy, all firms in the portfolio are\nassigned the same PD.\n6In Kloeden and Platen (1992), chapter 10, the Milshtein scheme is recommended for short time intervals\nas it increases the order of strong convergence from 0.5 in the Euler scheme to 1. The increase in convergence\nis loosely spoken caused by accounting for the second order term of the It^\no-Taylor Expansion.\nSince borrowers can only either default or survive, holding the set of borrowers fixed\nintroduces a survivorship bias. More precisely, the credit quality of the borrowers in the\nsample slowly increases over time as the borrowers with a negative evolution of their asset\nvalues drop out which also causes the sample size to decline.7 In order to control for these\neffects, we do not use a fixed set of borrowers but assume a homogeneous portfolio in\nwhich borrowers are reassigned every year to rating classes defined by fixed PDs. This\nprocedure is implemented in the simulations by setting asset values and portfolio size back\nto the original values V0 and N from the beginning of the first year.\nThe number of defaulted firms is given in every year by the number of firms of which the\nasset values fall below the outstanding debt value D at the end of the year. The default\nprobability PD at time t of a default at time t + h given the information about the firm\nvalue for each firm in the homogeneous portfolio is consistent with the Merton (1974)\nmodel and given by\nPD = P(Vi,t+h < D) = P Vi,t exp (\u00b5 -\n) \u00b7 h + (Wi,t+h - Wi,t) < D ,\nwhich leads to\nPD = P\n\n\nWi,t+h - Wi,t\n\nh\n<\nlog D\nVi,t\n)h\n\n\nh\n\n = \nc\n\nh\nwith\nc =\nlog D\n)h\n\nFollowing standard procedure, the risk horizon h is in our simulation constant and set to\none year. As the one\u00adyear default probability of each firm equals the probability that the\nasset return Wi,t+h -Wi,t of the period with length h falls below the distance-to-default c,\ncounting these events in every simulation run provides the numerator of the default rate\nof the portfolio. Note that with the static risk horizon h, cases in which the asset value\nfalls below the default threshold before the end of the period but the borrower is \"cured\"\nbefore the year end, are not counted as defaults.\n2.3. Stochastic Asset Correlation\nComparing estimates of asset correlations from equity prices and default rates may be\nconsidered as giving an undue preference to the first method. The reason is it uses much\nmore observations because stock prices are available with a higher frequency than default\nrates. In order to balance this effect we introduce a misspecification that is likely to appear\nalso in real equity prices but which affects the estimation from default rates less.\nFor this purpose we allow for stochastic asset correlations. The results can also contribute\nto answer the question how fluctuations in asset correlations over time affect the estimation\naccuracy given that their stochastic nature is not accounted for in the estimation method.\nStochastic asset correlations are not the only way to produce estimation noise and \u00ad if\nsystematic \u00ad to influence default correlations. Stochastic volatility of asset values offers an\nalternative approach which can also be motivated by empirical findings in stock markets.8\nIn this case, equation (4) which relates asset values to equity values no longer holds which\nimplies a considerable technical burden for the simulation analysis to generate equity\nvalues. Therefore, we prefer stochastic asset correlations which do not affect (4).\nThe case of stochastic asset correlations is implemented as follows. The deterministic asset\ncorrelation  in equation (2) is replaced by a stochastic variable t such that the stochastic\ninnovations dZi,t are given by\ndWi,t =\n\nt dXt + 1 - t dBi,t. (7)\nConsistency with the case of a deterministic correlation  suggests that the long-run mean\nof the stochastic correlation equals . For this purpose, we impose an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess for the stochastic asset correlation with long term mean . Given that asset\ncorrelations \u00ad contrary to interest rates and default correlations9 \u00ad are not necessarily\npositive, we assume the following Vasicek process under the physical measure P:\ndt = ( - t)dt + dZt. (8)\nThe parameter  denotes the mean reversion parameter and  the volatility of the mean\nreversion process. The stochastic innovations dXt, dBi,t and dZt are at any time t pair-\nwise independent increments of Brownian motions. The stochastic process of the asset\ncorrelation in discrete form is given by\nt+t = t + ( - t)t + \n\n3. Methods for Estimating Asset Correlations\n3.1. Estimation From Stock Prices\nThe estimation of asset correlations from stock prices is based on the structural model\ndescribed in Section 2. We differentiate between a direct estimation method which es-\ntimates asset correlations directly from equity returns and an indirect and conceptually\nbetter founded method, which requires in the first step to estimate the asset returns from\nwhich in the second step asset correlations are estimated.\nFollowing Duan et al. (2003), asset correlations are approximated in the first, direct method\nby pairwise equity correlations, which are estimated from stock returns. Estimating asset\ncorrelations directly from equity prices is quite common in empirical studies and can be\nmotivated by the equivalence of using equity and asset values in the limiting case when\nthe length of the time horizon approaches zero. Using equity returns to estimate asset\ncorrelations has nevertheless been often criticized because it ignores the leverage in the\ncapital structure. This is, however, considered a minor concern for high-grade borrowers.10\nSince correlation estimation from market prices competes with an estimation from default\nrates particularly for less risky borrowers for which default events are even more scarce, we\nfocus exactly on this segment for which the leverage argument should be a minor concern.\nThe first estimation method is based on stock returns without converting them first into\nasset returns. Therefore, it is referred to in the following as \"direct\" estimation method.\nAsset correlations are estimated by the mean of the pair-wise correlations of all firms:\n^\nPW =\nN\ncorr[log[Ei], log[Ej]], (10)\nwhere Ei denotes the vector that collects the equity returns of firm i over time.\nThe second, \"indirect\" estimation method consists of two steps. In the first step, the asset\nvalues are estimated from stock prices and liabilities and transformed into log-returns. In\nthe second step, the asset correlations are estimated from the asset returns of the first\nullmann\net al. (2007) who obtained the asset values of non\u00adfinancial companies from the MKMV\nmodel. We employ the MKMV method of estimating asset values from equity prices and\nbalance sheet information. As given in Bohn and Crosbie (2003), MKMV uses a two step\nalgorithm with m iteration steps to estimate the asset value and its standard deviation \nfrom a time series of equity values.\n(1.) Set m = 0 and use ^\n(0) = 0.3 as a starting value, with r, T, D given exogenously.\n(2.) Compute ^\ni,t\n= BS-1(Ei,t, ^\n(m)) from the Black/Scholes formula BS(.), given\nby equation (4), for all t.\n(3.) Compute the standard deviation ^\n(m+1) of the logarithmic asset value returns.\n(4.) Stop if |^\n(m)|  , else increase m by one and return to (2.).\nThe algorithm produces Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimates of the volatility and the\nasset value11 and is superior to the method employed before by Jones et al. (1984).12\nAfter having estimated the asset values in the first step and following Pitts (2004), a\nrandom effects model13 is employed in the second step to estimate the asset correlations.\nBesides the time-dependent random effect ~\nXt and the idiosyncratic disturbance term ~\nBi,t,\nthe only explanatory variable in the parsimonious model is a firm-dependent intercept i\nfor every firm:\n log[Vi,t] = i + X\n~\nXt + B\n~\nBi,t, where ~\nXt, ~\nSince we assume a homogenous portfolio, i is constant across firms. Pitts (2004) uses the\nML estimates from the random effects model to estimate the asset correlation by taking\ninto account that ^\nX\ncorresponds to 2t and ^\nB\nto 2t(1 - ) in equation (3). The\nasset correlation estimator ^\n is then given by\n^\n =\n^\nX\n^\nX\n+ ^\nB\nFollowing the common procedure that asset correlations are directly estimated from equity\nreturns, we apply the random effects estimator as well directly to stock price returns.\nSummarizing, we employ two approaches for the estimation of asset correlations, both for\nthose estimated from equity returns and for those estimated from asset returns (the latter\nbeing inferred before from equity returns). The first approach is based on the sample\ncorrelation of a time series of equity or asset returns and the second approach is based on\nthe random effects model.\nFinally, we replace the constant asset correlation by a stochastic variable which follows an\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process. Since we investigate this case as an example of model risk\nand a robustness check, we do not account for this feature in the parameter estimation\nand apply the same estimation methods as described in this subsection.\n12See Duan et al. (2003) for a discussion of the ML estimation in this context.\n13See Hsiao (2003) for further details on random effects models.\n3.2. Estimation of Asset Correlation From Default Rates\nThis subsection describes the ML and the Method-of-Moments (MM) methodologies which\nwe employ to estimate asset correlations from default rates, generated from the DGP\ndescribed in Section 2. In principle, default correlations can be estimated directly from\nobserved default events as in Lucas (1995) and then reverted back into asset correlations.\nHowever, to improve estimation efficiency we make use of the model structure in the\nestimation procedure. From equation (3) follows for the probability of default:\nPD = P\nWi,t+h - Wi,t\n\nh\n<\nc\n\nh\n= P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n=Xt\nXt+h - Xt)\n\nh\n(\n=Bi,t\nBi,t+h - Bi,t)\n\nh\n<\nc\n\nh\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law of large numbers implies that the default rate of the time period from t to t + h\nconverges for large portfolios and long time series to the conditional default probability\nP\nWi,t+h - Wi,t\n\nh\n<\nc\n\nh\nXt = x = P\nBi,t\n\nh\n<\nc -\n\nx\n\nh\n\nwhich is obviously a function depending on the realization x of the common risk factor X\ngiven  and c.\nSince Bi,t is an increment of a Brownian motion, Bi,t\n\nh\nis standard normal distributed.\nTherefore, we get for the conditional default probability\ng(x; , c) = \nc -\n\nx\n\nh\n\n.\nThe corresponding density of the default frequency DFt is given in the limit by\nf(DFt; , PD) =\n\n\nexp -\nt\n\nNote that the time intervals for which the series of default frequencies (DFt)t=1,...,T is\ncomputed do not overlap.\nMaximizing the log-likelihood function\nLL(PD, , DF1, . . . , DFT ) =\nT\nlog [f(DFt; , PD)] (17)\nleads to the following ML estimator:14\n^\n =\nT\nT\nT\nT\nThe estimator is called the Asymptotic Maximum Likelihood (AML) estimator as it re-\nquires a large bucket of firms and a long time series.\nBesides the ML methodology, Gordy (2000) also employs an MM estimator for the expected\ndefault rate \u00af\np and the asset correlation . It is based on matching the first and second\nmoment of g(X) with the empirical first and second moment of the default rates:15\nE[g(X)] = \u00af\nwhere 2(.) denotes the cumulative bivariate Gaussian distribution function. The left\nhand side of (20) is computed by the sample variance of the default frequencies and \nis backed out numerically. We refer to this estimation as the Method-of-Moments (MM)\n4. Comparative Static Analysis\n4.1. Simulation Setup and Performance Measures\nThe estimation methodologies for asset correlations presented in the previous Section 3 are\nanalyzed in a comparative static analysis. Its setup is designed to be fair to both estimation\nmethodologies while minimizing the computational workload to the extent possible. The\nasset correlation estimators are applied to the same homogeneous portfolio of firms in\neach simulation run. Stock prices and default rates are generated consistently. In order to\nachieve generality of the results, the model parameters of the simulated portfolio, namely\nthe asset correlation , the probability of default PD, the number of borrowers or portfolio\n14The standard errors of the estimator are given in the Appendix of D\u00a8\n16We have also considered a modified MM estimator with a \"finite sample adjustment\". The results are\nsufficiently close to the original estimator that we omit them to conserve space. For further reference on\nboth estimators see Appendix C of Gordy (2000).\nsize N and the length of the time series Y are varied in the comparative static analysis.\nThe parameter values of the DGP are shown in Table 1.\nThe range of asset correlations is mainly motivated by the parameter values in the risk\nweight functions for wholesale credit exposures in Basel II and previous empirical results.17\nThe default probabilities are set to correspond with rating grades, i.e. 0.5% with BBB,\n1.2% with BB and 2% with B+. As the accuracy of an estimation from default rates is\nexpected to decline with lower PDs due to the scarcity of default events, borrowers with\nhigher ratings than BBB should only be considered if this estimation method still performs\nwell in this credit category.\nThe minimum of 5 years for the length of the time series of default rates is inspired by the\nregulatory minimum requirements in Basel II for the estimation of PDs. The maximum\nof 40 years is close to the maximum length that is currently available in the industry, e. g.\nin rating agency databases.\nParameter Values of the Data Generating Process\nThis table shows the 24 parameter sets of asset correlation, length of time series\nand default probability which were used for the data generating processes.\nValues Number of values\nFor each of the twenty-four different parameter combinations, 10,000 simulations are run.\nThe parameters of the asset value process which are the same for all simulation runs are\narguably most critical of these parameters is the asset volatility . It's value is in line\nwith empirical findings by Eom et al. (2003). The debt value D is a free parameter and\ncalibrated to the desired PD by means of equation (5). The three PDs correspond with\nthe empirical estimates for the three rating classes BBB-, ... and B+. The portfolio size\nN is set to 5,000 borrowers, which is enough for a meaningful estimation of default rates\nwhile still being realistic for portfolios of real banks.\nAsset returns are simulated for weekly time intervals. Since defaults are rare events, the\n17See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2005), para 272 and for previous empirical results\nSection 1.\ngenerated default rates are calculated on a yearly basis. In order to ensure consistency\nbetween default rates and stock prices, the yearly default rates are generated from the\nsame asset returns. For this purpose, the weekly random asset returns Wi,t+t - Wi,t\nare summed up in every year and divided by\n\n52 to obtain the standardized yearly asset\nreturns. The default rates are computed by counting how often negative yearly asset\nreturns reach or exceed the distance-to-default, given by equation (6).\nIt turns out that the performance of an estimation from stock prices does not further\nimprove if weekly stock prices are simulated for more than fifty firms and over more than\ntwo years. Therefore, we employ for the correlation estimation from market prices only a\nsubset of fifty firms and two years of market prices, notwithstanding that we use the full\nsample of 5,000 firms and 40 years for the generation of default rates.\nThe following two indicators are used to measure the estimation performance of the two\nasset correlation estimators based on stock prices and also for the three estimators based\non default rates in each of the 24 parameter settings:\nS\nS\n^\ns - ,\nRoot mean squared error: RMSE = 1\nS\nS\n(^\nThe root mean squared error (RMSE) is a hybrid measure which brings together the bias\nand the standard deviation of the estimator.\nThe performance analysis of the asset correlation estimators is structured as follows: The\nestimators based on default rates are analysed in subsection (4.2), followed by the esti-\nmators which require stock prices in subsection (4.3). In subsection (4.4) the robustness\nof our results is explored in the presence of a model error introduced by stochastic asset\ncorrelations.\n4.2. Performance Results of Estimators Based on Default Rates\nThe performance measures bias and RMSE of estimations from default rates are listed in\nTable 2, given an asset correlation of 10%. The PD varies between 0.5% and 2.03% and\nthe sample length for yearly default rates varies between 5 and 40 years. For every PD\nand sample length, bias and RMSE are given for the AML and the MM estimator.\nConsidering first a sample length of 40 years, the bias is less than a percentage point with a\nvarying sign, dependent on the PD and the estimation method. For shorter sample lengths\nthe bias becomes increasingly negative, indicating that the estimator is biased downwards\nin small samples. For the shortest time series of only 5 years, the bias increases up to\nthree percentage points (for the MM estimator) which is quite substantial given the true\nasset correlation is only 10%. The results indicate that the correlation estimators based\non default rates are substantially downward biased in small samples. The relation between\nbias and PD is ambiguous. For a relatively long default rate history of at least 20 years\nand PDs up to 1.2% the generally negative bias becomes positive if the AML estimation\nmethod is applied.\nThe RMSE also increases if the sample length is gradually reduced from its maximum\nvalue of 40 years. An RMSE that is roughly 50% of the true asset correlation value for\nthe highest PD of 2.03% and sample lengths up to 10 years reveals the limitations if asset\ncorrelations need to be estimated from default rates.\nComparing the two estimation methods, the MM estimates are more strongly biased down-\nwards than the AML estimates. The lower downward bias of the AML method becomes\nmore visible for shorter sample lengths and for lower PDs. For the RMSE as performance\nmeasure, the differences are ambiguous. Although for sample lengths of 10\u00ad40 years the\nAML estimator has the lower RMSE, the difference is smaller in relative terms than in the\ncase of the bias. Furthermore, in the 5-years case, the MM method performs slightly better\nin terms of RMSE than the AML estimator but the difference is arguably immaterial in\npractice.\nFigure 1 shows the distribution function of the estimation errors for the AML and the\nMM estimator, given an asset correlation of 10%. It reveals that the downward bias is\nstronger with the MM estimator. Furthermore, the distribution of this estimator is much\nless symmetric and positively skewed. The last finding indicates that erroneously high\ncorrelation estimates occur more often with the MM rather than the AML method. The\nsuperior performance of the AML estimator, in particular its lower downward bias, is\nplausible as it makes better use of the model structure.\nIn order to measure the impact of the level of the true correlation parameter, Figure 2\nshows the sample density distribution of the estimation error of the AML estimator, given\nasset correlations of 10% and 25%. Both density distributions clearly show that the bias\nstrongly depends on the value of the correlation parameter. For the higher correlation of\n25%, the mean bias is stronger and estimates are much more scattered than for a correlation\nof 10%. These results signal a strong dependence of the estimation performance on the\ntrue asset correlation.\nTable 3 describes the performance of both estimators, given an asset correlation of 25%.\nCompared with the results in Table 2 for a correlation of 10%, the downward bias strongly\nBias and RMSE of the AML and MM Estimator With a True Asset\nThis table shows the bias and RMSE of asset correlation estimates for the\nAsymptotic Maximum Likelihood (AML) method and the Method of Moments\n(MM), separately for three default probabilities (PD) and four sample lengths\nY of yearly default rates.\nBias\nRMSE\nFigure 1.

Even for the longest sample length of 40 years the bias rises to 5 percentage\npoints, also depending on the estimation method. Contrary to the findings for an asset\ncorrelation of 10% in Table 2, the bias is always negative. For the shortest time series of\n5 years it can increase to 13 percentage points or around 50% of the true asset correlation.\nAgain, the bias also depends on the estimation method, with the AML method coming\nout as superior in all parameter constellations.\nThe results for the bias also hold qualitatively if the RMSE is considered as performance\nindicator. The higher correlation increases the number of defaults, which could raise the\nexpectation that the performance improves over Table 2. However, this is not the case as,\nfor example for 5 years, the RMSE is still roughly 50% of the true correlation value.\nSummarizing, we find that estimates from default rates are typically downward biased.\nThis negative bias increases with shorter sample lengths, high correlations, lower PDs,\nand is higher for the MM-estimator than if the AML-estimator is applied. The level of\nthe true correlation parameter also has a strong impact on the estimation performance.\nIncreasing the asset correlation from 10% to 25% reveals not only a stronger downward\nBias and RMSE of Asset Correlation Estimates as Pairwise Stock Price\nCorrelations and Based on the Random Effects Model\nThis table shows the bias and RMSE of asset correlation estimates from stock\nreturns.

This finding confirms the need to\nconsider not only the bias but also the RMSE when evaluating the small sample properties\nof the estimators.\n4.3. Performance Results of Estimators Based on Stock Prices\nAs described in Section 3, we employ a direct and an indirect estimation method to infer\nasset correlations from market prices. The direct method uses equity returns whereas\nthe indirect method requires first inferred asset returns from which asset correlations are\nestimated in a second step.\nThe two performance measures for the direct method, bias and RMSE, are shown in\nTable 4. We consider again three PDs and two asset correlation values. Furthermore,\nasset correlations are estimated based on a sample of equity returns both by the mean of\npairwise sample correlations and in the framework of a random effects model. Comparing\nthese two methods first, we find that the sample correlations are less biased and have a\nlower RMSE for all three PDs and for both asset correlation values. This observation is\nconfirmed by Figure 3 which presents the cumulative distribution of estimation errors.\nAlthough the mean sample correlation of equity returns is still downward biased, bias\nand RMSE are by far smaller than in the case of using default rates for the estimation\nFigure 3. Distribution of Estimation Errors Based on Stock Prices\nThis figure shows the interpolated distribution function of errors in asset cor-\nrelation estimates, both for pairwise sample correlations and a random effects\nmodel.

According to Table 3, even with the longest sample length of 40 yearly\ndefault rates, the RMSE of the AML estimator is still 0.06% or double the RMSE of the\ncorrelation estimates based on equity returns in Table 4. The superior performance of the\nestimation from market prices also depends on the parameters of the DGP. It becomes\nceteris paribus more pronounced with higher PDs and higher asset correlations.\nWhereas Table 4 presents the estimators' performance for the direct method, Table 5\ngives the corresponding performance indicators for the indirect estimation method, based\non inferred asset returns. Comparing first the results of the sample correlation estimates\nwith those of the random effects model, we find that the latter method is superior in terms\nof bias but that both methods are nearly indistinguishable in terms of RMSE. Given the\nsmall absolute values of the downward bias for both methods, the difference in the bias is\nimmaterial.\nThe similar performance of both indirect estimation methods based on asset returns con-\ntrasts with the results for the asset correlation estimation from equity returns, given in\nTable 5, where the sample correlations emerged as the superior estimation method.\nConsidering that the indirect method of using inferred asset returns instead of equity\nreturns is the theoretically better founded method, its superior performance is plausible.\nThe random effects model applied to the asset returns exploits the model structure of the\nDGP better than the other methods. Therefore, it should be expected to be at least as\nFigure 4.

If equity returns are used instead of asset returns the input\ndata to the estimation are already misspecified. As a consequence, estimators are more\nrobust against model errors if they pose less assumptions about the underlying model as,\nfor example, in this case the mean sample correlation.\nFinally, Figure 4 compares the distribution of estimation errors of the AML method based\non default rates with the estimation based on the sample correlation of asset returns. It\nshows the substantially higher downward bias and also the fatter tails of the estimation\nerrors, produced by the AML method.\nSummarizing, we find that both, the direct estimation from equity returns and the indirect\nestimation from asset returns are superior to an estimation of asset correlations from\ndefault rates, both in terms of the bias and the RMSE. This holds even if a relatively short\nsample of two years of weekly equity returns is compared with a sample comprising 40 years\nof yearly default rate observations. Comparing the direct and the indirect estimation\nmethod we find that the indirect estimation is superior. The out-performance depends\nalso on the estimation method and the true parameters of the DGP. With increasing\nPDs and higher asset correlations, the out-performance of the direct estimation method\nbecomes more visible. Nevertheless, the differences in estimation accuracy between the\nsample correlation estimates based on equity returns and the estimates of the RE model\nbased on asset returns may still be negligible in practice. In other words, the more simpler\nmethod of a direct estimation from equity returns can produce quite reasonable estimates.\nThese results hold in the absence of a model error, i. e. if the estimation is based on data\ngenerated from the model of the DGP. In the following section we explore, how robust\nthey are against a model error, more specifically if asset correlations are no longer constant\nover time but follow an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.\n4.4. Estimation Performance Under Stochastic Correlations\nThere is substantial evidence in the literature that asset correlations fluctuate over time.18\nIf correlations follow a mean-reverting process with a sufficiently short half-life, the ran-\ndomness may have a stronger effect on correlation estimates from stock prices as they rely\non a much higher data frequency compared with correlation estimates from default rates.\nIf this hypothesis proves to be true, the result from the previous section that correlation\nestimation from default rates is strictly preferable may no longer hold.\nIt can be argued that accounting only for the model error of a mean-reverting process\nof the asset correlations unduly benefits the estimation from default rates relative to the\nestimation from market prices. Since the required time series of default rates are typically\nlong, estimation from default rates is arguably much more susceptible to structural brakes,\nintroduced for example by changes in the legal framework, which are not considered. Given\nthat the estimation from market prices has emerged as clearly superior in the case of a\ncorrectly specified model, it seems, however, justified to focus on a model error that affects\nmainly the already superior estimation method. In this case the results can be considered\nalso as a robustness check for the superiority of the estimation from market prices.\nThe \"robustness check\" of stochastic asset correlations requires specifying the mean rever-\nsion parameter  and the volatility  in equation (8) in Subsection 2.3. The parameters\nThe values of the mean  are given by the constant asset correlations used before. The\nparameters  and  are set such that the asymptotic 90% confidence interval of the\nstochastic correlation is given by  \u00b1 10%.19 The value of one for  corresponds with a\nTable 6 presents the correlation estimates, based on default rates, employing the AML\nand the MM method. Since the asset correlation is stochastic, we assume an average\ncorrelation of 10% for the DGP to facilitate a comparison with results in the previous\nsection for a constant asset correlation. For five and 10 years the results are ambiguous\nbut for 20 and 40 years the bias is higher in the case of stochastic correlations. The\nRMSE is always higher in this case but the difference is below one percentage point. The\nsensitivity of the estimation performance to PD and to the number of years is similar to\nthe previous results in Table 2. The better performance if asset correlations are estimated\nfrom equity returns instead of from default rates is confirmed by Figure 5 for the case of\nstochastic correlations.\nTable 7 corresponds with Table 6 but with an average asset correlation of 25% instead\nof 10% in the DGP. Although both bias and RMSE increase, the sensitivity to PD, the\nlength of the time series and the estimation method (MM or AML) is similar.\nSummarizing, introducing mean-reverting asset correlations increases the RMSE if the\nestimation is based on default rates but not substantially. This result supports the hy-\npothesis that a mean-reverting asset correlation has only a minor impact on the estimation\nperformance.\n19The confidence level is obtained from the asymptotic distribution of t\nfor t   which is given by\n\n.\n20The half-life time is given by the formula -ln(0.5)\n\n.\nBias and RMSE of the AML and MM Estimator With a Mean Asset\nCorrelation of 10% and a Stochastic Asset Correlation Process\nThis table shows the bias and RMSE of asset correlation estimates for the\nAsymptotic Maximum Likelihood (AML) method and the Method of Moments\n(MM), separately for three default probabilities (PD) and four sample lengths\nY of yearly default rate observations.

Although the indirect estimation based on asset returns instead of stock returns is\nbetter founded in theory, the results from the previous section indicate that the differences\nbetween both cases are minor. Given the substantially lower computational burden, we\napply only the direct method that uses stock prices as input. We do not present the\nresults for the random effects model with stock price data as this model already proved to\nbe inferior when applied to stock returns in the case of a constant correlation.\nThe numbers in Table 8 show a clear deterioration in the estimation performance, measured\nby RMSE, compared with Table 4. For an asset correlation of 0.25, a sample length of\nbias instead stays nearly unaffected.\nFigure 6 compares the estimation errors if the asset correlation is estimated by pairwise\nequity return correlations both without and with stochastic correlation. It confirms the\nfinding of a higher dispersion of errors if the asset correlation follows a stochastic process.\nSummarizing, the observed stronger increase in the RMSE for the estimation from market\nprices compared with the estimation from default rates confirms our expectation. Our\nresults indicate that choosing between the use of market prices or default rates as data\nbasis of the correlation estimation requires taking into account a trade-off: The closer\nthe Merton model describes real world processes, the better estimates based on market\nprices perform. If the model is instead misspecified, for example as it is agnostic to the\nFigure 6.

The reason for the smaller\ndifference in estimation accuracy between both estimation methods is that the estimation\nfrom default rates requires less assumptions on model structure which renders it more\nrobust against model misspecifications.\n5. Summary and Conclusions\nLinear factor models, based on the classic Merton (1974) model, have become a corner-\nstone of credit risk modelling in the literature as well as in industry practice. In this model\nframework, default dependencies are typically captured by asset correlations. These key\nparameters of a model are usually estimated either from time series of stock prices or\ndefault rates. In this paper we explore to which extent differences in small sample prop-\nerties of the respective estimators are responsible for the substantial diversity in empirical\nestimates of asset correlations. For this purpose, we carry out a comprehensive simulation\nstudy in which the time series of default rates and stock prices of realistic length are gen-\nerated from the same model, i. e. the same DGP. Furthermore, we introduce a model error\nin the form of stochastic, mean-reverting asset correlations. We compare the performance\nof the estimators from default rates with those from stock prices, using the bias and the\nRMSE as benchmarks. Our main findings are:\n\u00b7 Estimates from default rates are typically downward biased. This negative bias\nincreases with shorter sample lengths, high correlations, lower PDs, and if the MM\nestimator is used instead of the AML-estimator.\n\u00b7 The level of the true correlation parameter has a strong impact on the estimation\nperformance. Increasing the asset correlation from 10% to 25% increases not only\nthe downward bias, but also produces more scattered estimates, particularly in the\ntails.\n\u00b7 Both, the direct estimation of asset correlations from equity returns and the indirect\nestimation from asset returns are superior to an estimation from default rates, both\nin terms of bias and RMSE. This holds even if a relatively short sample of two years\nof weekly equity returns is compared with a sample comprising 40 years of yearly\ndefault rate observations.\n\u00b7 Comparing the direct and the indirect estimation method we find that the indirect\nestimation based on inferred asset returns is superior. The better performance de-\npends also on the true parameters of the DGP. With increasing PDs and higher\nasset correlations, the out\u00adperformance of the direct estimation method becomes\nmore visible.\n\u00b7 If the constant asset correlation is replaced in the DGP by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess, the superiority of an estimation from equity prices instead of default rates\ndiminishes but it does not disappear in the studied case.\nThese findings have implications for the interpretation of empirical studies of asset corre-\nlations and for future risk modelling:\n1. Our results indicate that different small sample properties may have contributed to\na large extent to the differences in correlation estimates which emerged in previous\nempirical studies but they cannot fully explain them.\n2. If time series of market prices of equity and default rates are available, it is generally\nrecommendable to estimate asset correlations from market prices. The differences\nin accuracy between the two market-price based estimation methods, i.e. the sample\ncorrelation based on equity returns and the RE model based on asset returns, may\nstill be negligible in practice. In other words, the more simpler of the two methods of\na direct estimation from equity returns already produces quite reasonable estimates.\n3. We have observed relatively high RMSEs even in a clinical study in which the model\nis correctly specified which is unlikely in practical applications. This finding strongly\nadvocates that care must be taken if correlation estimates are applied in credit risk\nmodelling. The simulation setup used in this paper presents a way to quantify the\nestimation error.\nIntroducing a model error through stochastic, mean-reverting correlations is certainly only\none of many plausible alternatives. Other causes of model errors which are also plausible\ngiven results from other empirical work, are, for example, a t-distribution of asset returns\nfollowing Mashal et al. (2003) or a cross-sectional diversity of asset correlations, inspired\nby D\u00a8\nullmann et al. (2007). A more comprehensive analysis of the effect of various model\nerrors is left for further work.\nReferences\nAng, A. and Chen, J.
