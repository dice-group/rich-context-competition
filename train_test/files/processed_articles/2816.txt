Over\nthe past two decades, major German banks, like other banks around the globe, have increased\ntheir international exposure through both cross-border lending and by the establishment of\nbranches and subsidiaries abroad. Therefore, internationally oriented German banks nowa-\ndays rely heavily on the development of their foreign claims. However, even though the\nexpansion into foreign markets creates opportunities for banks to better diversify their credit\nportfolios by exploiting the less-than-perfect co-movement of international business cycles,\nGerman banks continue to focus strongly on developed countries in their portfolios.\nIn this paper, we investigate which country-specific determinants lead German banks\nto overweight some countries and underweight others in their international credit portfolios\nagainst a mean-variance based benchmark. We ask which geographical, institutional, and\nregulatory frictions cause German banks to leave opportunities for diversification unexploited.\nTo this end, we construct from the Deutsche Bundesbank's External Position Reports of\nGerman Banks a bank-country panel for the years 2003 to 2007 for large, internationally\noriented German banks and a representative set of 35 countries from all regions of the world\nwhich comprehensively reflects the investment opportunity set of German banks.\nOur results show that banking regulations are important determinants of German banks'\ninternational credit portfolios. Countries with stricter capital adequacy and entry require-\nments tend to be overweighted, primarily due to a lower level of banking market competition.\nGerman banks also overweight countries with larger and more developed banking markets,\nand tend to follow their domestic clients abroad in order to maintain existing lending rela-\ntionships. Geographical factors, in contrast, do not seem to matter. German banks' credit\nportfolios do not appear to be determined by country factors which cannot change over time.\nInstead, there is reason to believe that changes in and convergence of banking regulations\nand deepening of banking sectors around the world may result in banks holding more diversi-\nfied international credit portfolios, making them more stable and resilient to country-specific\nshocks.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nDie globale Finanz- und die noch andauernde Schuldenkrise haben die Rolle gro\u00dfer, global\nausgerichteter Banken sowie deren Bedeutung f\u00fcr das Verst\u00e4ndnis internationaler Finanzin-\ntegration verdeutlicht.

In fact, when the first signs of financial turmoil began to show in 2007,\nthe foreign claims of banks reporting to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) stood\n1990. Banks from Germany have likewise increased their international exposure through\nboth cross-border lending and the establishment of branches and subsidiaries abroad. BIS\ndata also reveal that Germany has been one of the top source countries of worldwide foreign\nclaims for the past two decades. Moreover, at the end of 2007, foreign activities were already\nmore important than domestic activities for major German banks, making up between 50\nand 70% of their total assets. Therefore, internationally oriented German banks nowadays\nrely heavily on the development of their foreign claims.\nThis implies that internationally active banks should decide on new business with the\nrisk and return of their foreign portfolios in mind. At the same time, the expansion into\nforeign markets creates the potential for banks to diversify across countries by exploiting the\nless-than-perfect co-movement of business cycles around the world. For instance, Kose et al.\n(2008) point out that notable business cycle asynchronicity between industrial countries on\nthe one hand, and emerging market economies and developing countries on the other, con-\ntinues to exist to this day. However, banking flows are primarily concentrated on developed\nmarkets (Milesi-Ferretti and Tille 2011). Large, globally oriented German banks also focus\nstrongly on developed countries in their portfolios.\nIn this paper, we investigate which country-specific determinants lead German banks\nto overweight some countries and underweight others in their international credit portfolios\nBenjamin B\u00f6ninghausen: Munich Graduate School of Economics, Ludwigstra\u00dfe 28, 80539 Munich, Ger-\nmany.

More specifically, we ask which geographical,\ninstitutional, and regulatory frictions cause German banks to leave opportunities for diversi-\nfication unexploited. Our results show that banking regulations are important determinants\nof the international credit portfolios of German banks. We present robust evidence that\ncountries with stricter capital adequacy and entry requirements tend to be overweighted,\nprimarily due to a lower level of banking market competition. German banks also overweight\ncountries with larger and more developed banking markets. Furthermore, we find that Ger-\nman banks tend to follow their domestic customers abroad in order to maintain existing\nlending relationships. Geographical factors, in contrast, do not seem to matter.\nOur results are based on the Deutsche Bundesbank's External Position Reports of German\nBanks. This unique dataset contains micro-level data on the foreign exposure of all German\nbanks, including their branches and subsidiaries abroad. From this dataset we construct a\nbank-country panel for the period between 2003 and 2007 for large, internationally oriented\nGerman banks and a representative set of 35 countries from all regions of the world that\ncomprehensively reflects the investment opportunity set of German banks.\nWe compare the actual international credit portfolios of the banks in our sample to bench-\nmark portfolios we would expect to observe in the absence of country-specific frictions. The\nbenchmark portfolios are derived using a mean-variance approach \u00e0 la Markowitz (1952,\nlatter use an unpublished aggregate, locational BIS dataset on the cross-border assets1 of\nbanks from France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States in 23 coun-\ntries around the world to identify barriers to international diversification. They estimate\nprobit models and find that the probability of a country's being overweighted decreases with\nthe severity of capital controls, and increases with a survey measure of trust among residents\nin the destination country. A major drawback of their study is that they concentrate on\ncross-border exposure only. However, large global banks have significantly increased their\nlending through foreign affiliates over the past two decades. The average bank in our sample,\nfor instance, relies on branches and subsidiaries for about 40 to 50% of its foreign credit\nexposure. Moreover, solely focusing on cross-border lending might give a distorted view due\nto potential substitution effects because some loans that used to be extended cross-border\nmay be granted locally once an affiliate has been set up (Garc\u00eda-Herrero and Mart\u00ednez Per\u00eda\n2007). Our dataset, in contrast, allows us to consider the consolidated foreign exposure of\nindividual banks and, crucially, to account for heterogeneity in banks' international portfolio\nstrategies.\n1We focus more precisely on the credit portfolios of banks rather than their entire asset portfolios.\nGarc\u00eda-Herrero and V\u00e1zquez (2007) compile a bank-level dataset of international banks\nfrom eight major industrial countries to quantify the potential gains from international diver-\nsification. They find that international banks which allocate a larger share of their assets to\nforeign subsidiaries are able to achieve higher risk-adjusted returns, particularly in emerging\nmarkets. Banks' actual international asset portfolios are found to leave these opportunities\nlargely unexploited in comparison to the results from a mean-variance optimisation. How-\never, their results should be taken with caution, too, as they cannot account for parent bank\nand branch lending. Furthermore, the authors do not have information on ultimate lending\ndestinations and, hence, implicitly assume that claims by foreign subsidiaries are exclusively\nagainst counterparties in the country of location. Our dataset does not suffer from these\nshortcomings since we are able to identify actual destination countries for the parent bank,\nits foreign branches, and its foreign subsidiaries.\nThis paper also relates to empirical research on the determinants of the stocks and flows\nof international assets. Based on augmented gravity regressions, a number of studies inves-\ntigate the importance of distance in explaining international financial flows. Whereas Portes\net al. (2001) and Portes and Rey (2005) find that distance, proxying information costs,\nstill massively impedes cross-border flows of equities and bonds, the evidence in Aviat and\nCoeurdacier (2007) is that the effect of distance on bilateral bank asset holdings is massively\nreduced once goods trade is accounted for. The issue does not appear to be settled, though.\nFor instance, Heuchemer et al. (2009) detect significant distance and border effects using an\naggregated bilateral dataset of European cross-border loans.\nWe consistently find that more distant countries are not systematically underweighted.\nThis is a strong result because we are able to isolate the hypothesis that distance constitutes\na barrier in international lending via informational asymmetries from the conjecture that it\nmight have a positive effect on portfolio holdings through diversification opportunities, which\ntend to increase with distance (eg, Portes et al. 2001). Since diversification opportunities are\naccounted for in the benchmark portfolios against which we evaluate actual international\ncredit portfolios, the evidence in this paper suggests that informational asymmetries do not\nmonotonically increase with distance to the destination country. This is in line with Buch\net al. (2010) who do not find an effect of distance on the probability of a country's being\noverweighted either.\nHowever, we find strong evidence that banking regulations affect the over- or under-\nweighting of countries in German banks' international credit portfolios. More specifically,\nGerman banks are particularly attracted to countries with higher entry and capital adequacy\nrequirements. We show that this is due to lower levels of competition and efficiency in these\ncountries. As a consequence, German banks might be able to generate excess returns through\nsuperior management skills and technologies needed to run international operations.\nCompetition among banks for domestic customers also seems to be an important factor\nin the composition of international credit portfolios. German banks' international lending\nappears strongly driven by the desire to maintain existing relationships with domestic client\nfirms when those venture abroad and set up operations in a foreign country. This follow-your-\ncustomer motive has been established by several studies (see, eg, Goldberg and Saunders 1980,\nlending decisions of German banks.\nMoreover, German banks tend to overweight countries with deeper, more developed bank-\ning markets which might offer better opportunities for diversification. The level of risk-taking\nin the banking sector of the host country appears to matter as well. We observe that the\nbanks in our sample increased their lending to countries with riskier banking sectors. This\nmay have happened either deliberately to raise profits or ignorantly due to a failure of risk\nmanagement systems that reduced risk perception.\nThe credit portfolios of German banks do not seem to be determined by country factors\nwhich cannot change over time. Instead, there is reason to believe that, in the long run,\nchanges in and convergence of banking regulations as well as financial deepening of banking\nsectors around the world will result in banks holding more diversified international credit\nportfolios. A structural change in the portfolio composition of German banks may already\nhave set in. While their exposure to developed countries contracted by roughly 30% between\npicture is that cross-border bank flows to developed countries in general, and the United\nStates and Europe in particular, contracted to a significantly larger extent during the financial\ncrisis than to emerging and developing countries (Milesi-Ferretti and Tille 2011). This process\nis desirable from the point of view of financial stability because it should reduce the deviations\nfrom our benchmark portfolios and leave banks with portfolios that make them more stable\nand resilient to country-specific shocks.\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the dataset and characterises the\nactual international credit portfolios of German banks. The methodology and properties of\nthe benchmark portfolios are outlined in Section 3, while the frictions of interest and the\nempirical strategy to identify them are discussed in Section 4. The estimation results are\npresented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.\n2 International credit portfolios of German banks\nData on international credit portfolios are from the Deutsche Bundesbank's External Po-\nsition Reports of German Banks. This dataset contains monthly micro-level data on the\nexternal assets and liabilities of German banks, including their branches and subsidiaries\nabroad. Moreover, foreign assets and liabilities are broken down along a number of different\ndimensions such as destination country, asset class, counterparty sector, currency denomina-\ntion, and maturity.2 The richness of the dataset makes it highly suitable for investigating\nthe international diversification of bank credit portfolios. Three advantages stand out in\nparticular.\nFirst, data are available at the bank level. While we are interested in the country-\nspecific frictions due to which banks' portfolios deviate from optimally diversified benchmark\nportfolios, individual banks might differ in their country exposures for reasons other than the\nfactors we are able to observe. For instance, banks may have a lot of experience and expertise\nin a certain market or other competitive advantages. There may also be banks which single\nout certain strategically important countries in their international portfolio strategy. The\nbank-country dimension of our dataset allows us to control for such unobserved heterogeneity\nin our econometric analysis (see 4.1). This is a significant improvement over the dataset used\nSecond, reporting is not confined to the external positions of bank headquarters but\ninstead includes those of foreign affiliates as well. This is important since banks have not\nonly increased their cross-border exposures over the past two decades but also their lending\nvia branches and subsidiaries (see, eg, Clarke et al. 2003).3 A glance at the data reveals the\nimportance of foreign affiliates for internationally oriented banks. The average bank in our\nsample relies on branches and subsidiaries for about 40 to 50% of its foreign exposure, with\npercentages even ranging into the 90s as banks become larger and more internationally active.\nMoreover, there is reason to suspect substitution effects in international lending between the\nbank headquarters and their foreign affiliates. Some loans which used to be extended by\nthe parent bank may be granted locally once a foreign affiliate has been set up.4 Hence,\nfocusing only on either cross-border or affiliate lending would give a biased picture of banks'\ninternational diversification and its determinants. In contrast to Garc\u00eda-Herrero and V\u00e1zquez\n2For a more detailed documentation, see Fiorentino et al. (2010).\n3Cross-border lending refers to lending conducted directly by the parent bank, ie from a banking group's\nheadquarters, rather than by its foreign affiliates. We will therefore use these terms interchangeably. Likewise,\nwe will also occasionally refer to lending via foreign affiliates as local lending.\n4Also see Garc\u00eda-Herrero and Mart\u00ednez Per\u00eda (2007) who investigate the mix of international banks' foreign\nclaims between cross-border and local affiliate lending.\n(2007) and Buch et al. (2010), our dataset makes it possible to analyse a bank's consolidated\nforeign exposure by summing cross-border and affiliate lending.5\nFinally, foreign exposures are reported for the actual country of destination. This is\nanother improvement with respect to other datasets that contain no information on lending\ndestinations such as the one used by Garc\u00eda-Herrero and V\u00e1zquez (2007). Their implicit\nassumption that claims by foreign subsidiaries are exclusively against counterparties in the\ncountry of location may be appropriate in most instances. However, international banks\nalso use financial centres as \"hubs\" in order to lend to foreign clients outside those centres.\nTherefore, our data can be seen as providing a further refinement in that regard.\n2.2 Sample selection\nWe use the detailed information on foreign claims to focus our analysis along a number of\ndimensions and to construct a dataset best suited to addressing our research question.\nFirst, we focus on a specific set of banks. The key question of the paper is why banks\nwhich can be assumed to diversify internationally overweight some countries whilst under-\nweighting others. We therefore require that the banks in our sample be sufficiently large\nand internationally oriented. For Germany, we identify those banks as the major commercial\nbanks and the head institutions of the savings and co-operative banks. We exclude individ-\nual savings and co-operative banks as well as small or mid-sized banks due to their focus\non domestic activities. Specialised lenders are not included either since they pursue distinct\nbusiness models (eg, mortgage lending, business development loans, car financing).\nOur final bank sample consists of 18 institutions. Compared to all other German banks,\nthe banks in our sample have a considerably larger exposure to foreign countries. For example,\nwhile the banks in our sample have a significant credit exposure in roughly 50 countries, the\naverage number of countries to which all other German banks have substantial exposure is\nclose to zero. The banks in our sample also have significantly more foreign affiliates than\nthe other banks. Whereas the former have, on average, a branch and/or subsidiary in about\nten countries, the latter only have a local presence in approximately three foreign countries.\nOverall, the banks in our sample are sufficiently large and internationally oriented to pursue\nan international diversification strategy.\nSecond, we constrain our investigation to the period between 2003 and 2007. We exclude\nthe global financial and debt crisis years since our research question appears most reasonable\n5Whereas Garc\u00eda-Herrero and V\u00e1zquez (2007) rely entirely on foreign subsidiaries data from Bankscope,\nBuch et al. (2010) cannot include subsidiaries as part of a banking group since their data are locational. In\nour dataset, the foreign subsidiaries of large, internationally active banks often account for as much as 20 to\n30% of consolidated foreign exposure.\nin \"normal\" times, ie relative tranquillity in financial markets. In times of financial distress,\nhowever, we would expect short-term motives (eg, loss reduction) to dominate strategic\nconsiderations by banks, such as the international diversification of credit portfolios.6\nThird, we focus on loans to the non-bank private sector.7 Table 1 shows that this lend-\ning aggregate is the most important component of German banks' total foreign claims over\nthe entire sample period (42% in 2007). Holdings of foreign bonds and commercial paper\n(33%) and credit to foreign banks (18%) are less important. We do not include bonds and\ncommercial paper since we cannot be sure that this asset category does not capture securi-\ntised assets. This might be problematic due to the fact that securitisation was particularly\nprevalent during our sample period in the run-up to the global financial crisis and driven by\ndifferent considerations. Likewise, we exclude credit to foreign banks which is predominantly\nshort-term in nature and not driven by long-term portfolio considerations. Foreign equity\n(5%) is unimportant with regard to the international exposure of German banks.\nTable 1: Foreign claims of German banks, by asset class\nCredit to foreign banks\nForeign shares (any sector)\nNotes -- This table shows the foreign claims of all German banks broken down by asset class. Data are from the Deutsche\nBundesbank (External Position Reports of German Banks). All exposures are in e mn.\nFinally, despite constraints on the availability of equity indices, which are the basis for\nthe calculation of benchmark portfolios (see 3.1), we are able to construct a dataset that\nincludes a representative sample of 35 countries covering all major regions of the world (see\nTable A.1). This set of countries covers about 85% of the total foreign non-bank credit by the\nbanks in our sample. By capturing a substantial amount of cross-country heterogeneity and\n6In the robustness section, we later check whether our results change if we exclude the year 2007. The\nfirst stage of the crisis already began in 2007 and was largely confined to the interbank market.\n7D\u00fcwel et al. (2010) use the same database in a different context and make similar choices.\npotential diversification opportunities, we can expect to gain insights into the country-specific\ndeterminants of German banks' international credit portfolios.\nWe consolidate the loans to the non-bank private sector for all 18 banking groups over the\nsample period by summing the exposures of the parent bank and all of its foreign affiliates.\nThat is, we assume that German parent banks do not only consider their foreign branches as\npart of their international strategies, but also their foreign subsidiaries. This is reasonable\ndue to the tendency of international banks to incorporate branches and subsidiaries in their\ninternational strategy and the special importance of internal capital markets for German\nbanks. McCauley et al. (2010), for example, show that the foreign affiliates of German banks\nin particular depend more heavily on internal capital markets for funding than those of other\ninternational banking groups. This suggests that the foreign affiliates of German banks are\nparticularly integrated with their parent. We therefore include them in the analysis.\nFigure 1 shows the development of credit to the foreign non-bank private sector between\nof the 18 sample banks to the representative set of 35 countries. In each case, there is a\nAll German banks, worldwide Sample\nNotes -- Data are from the Deutsche Bundesbank (External Position Reports of German Banks).

Both aggregates also move remarkably in tandem, indicating\nthat our sample is highly comprehensive and representative along both the bank and country\ndimensions. Overall, our sample consistently accounts for 70% or more of all foreign credit\nby the entire German banking system. We will refer to this sample here and in the following.\nThe top ten lending destinations of German banks at year-end 2007 are presented in\nTable 2 from both an aggregate and a micro-level perspective. The aggregate figures in the\nleft-hand panel show the relative country weights in banks' international credit portfolios\nafter summing the different country exposures over all banks in our sample. In the right-\nhand panel, we exploit the micro nature of our dataset and provide summary statistics on\nthe basis of individual credit portfolios.\nTable 2: Primary lending destinations of German banks (year-end 2007)\nAggregated Disaggregated\nMedian Std dev\nNotes -- Data are from the Deutsche Bundesbank (External Position Reports of German Banks). Aggregate figures (left-hand\npanel) obtain after summing country-specific exposures across banks. Disaggregated statistics (right-hand panel) are based\non credit portfolios of individual banks. All figures refer to the sample of 18 internationally oriented German banks and the\nrepresentative set of 35 countries.\nThe United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) are by far the most important\nlending destinations for the banks in our sample. On aggregate, the US account for almost\n40% and the UK for roughly a third of total lending of lending to foreign non-banks. Six\nof the remaining top lending destinations are located in Western Europe (about 17%), the\nother two being Japan (3%) and Poland (1.5%). Together, the ten countries account for\nmore than 90% of total lending to non-banks. The micro-level perspective is mostly in line\nwith the observations at the aggregate level. The US and UK continue to be the two primary\ntarget countries for non-bank credit. Western European countries remain important as well,\neven though the rank ordering changes. Interestingly, Japan is no longer among the top\nlending destinations. In contrast, while Russia was not among the top ten countries based\non aggregate data, it ranks in ninth place on the basis of disaggregated data.\nA closer look at the disaggregated data provides further interesting insights into bank\nheterogeneity in portfolio holdings. For example, the standard deviations are large and\nfrequently a multiple of the respective medians for all countries except the US and UK.\nThis indicates that German banks take quite different views on the desirability of lending\nto specific countries. This heterogeneous behaviour is not confined to emerging economies\nlike Russia or Poland, but is observable in highly developed economies like France or the\nNetherlands as well. Overall, the descriptive analysis of the primary lending destinations\nsuggests that it is crucial to control for bank heterogeneity in our empirical investigation of\ncountry-level frictions.\n3 Benchmark portfolios\nThe goal of this paper is to examine which country-specific frictions drive a wedge between\nbanks' actual portfolios and benchmark portfolios, ie portfolios we could expect to observe as\nthe outcome of optimal international diversification in the absence of those frictions.8\nIn a fashion similar to Buch et al. (2010) and Garc\u00eda-Herrero and V\u00e1zquez (2007), we\ncompute these benchmark portfolios by applying the Markowitz (1952, 1959) mean-variance\nframework on the basis of representative assets. We make some amendments to the bench-\nmark portfolios in order to make them more suitable for our analysis. Most importantly, we\naccount for the fact that portfolio weights obtained from mean-variance optimisation over\nrepresentative assets are invariant to the size of the respective economies and their capacity\nto absorb credit. We therefore introduce more realism by correcting for credit demand.\nRepresentative assets. We interpret a bank's benchmark international credit portfolio\nas arising from an optimal choice from a universe of representative assets -- one for every\ncountry in our sample. The decision to lend to a particular country or, more precisely, its\nnon-bank private sector can be regarded as granting a loan to a \"typical\", representative\ncompany in that country.9 It is this company's economic and financial situation which the\nrepresentative asset is intended to proxy.\n8There may exist other frictions in portfolio allocation. For instance, rebalancing any kind of investment\nportfolio will generally entail some additional fixed transaction costs. In many cases the expected benefits\nwill not outweigh those costs, leading to more stable portfolios than would be the case without them. These\nfrictions differ by asset class, and can be quite substantial in the allocation of bank credit (especially as\ncompared to more standardised transactions, such as commodity contracts on futures exchanges). While we\nfocus on country-specific frictions in this paper, we account for the fact that fixed transaction costs may deter\nbanks from massively rebalancing their credit portfolios.\n9Here and in the following, whenever we refer to a country, we mean that country's non-bank private\nsector (see 2.2 for our choice of lending aggregate).\nThe mean-variance framework then captures the trade-off between risk and return that\nbanks face when lending internationally: all other things equal, they will prefer countries in\nwhich loan repayments are expected to be higher or less volatile. Crucially, in a portfolio\ncontext banks may even consider lending to a country for which repayments are expected to\nbe relatively low, or volatile, or both. The rationale is that banks can exploit less-than-perfect\ncorrelation between one country's loan repayments and those in the rest of the portfolio to\nimprove the risk-return profile of their international credit portfolio as a whole. Hence,\nthe benefits of international portfolio diversification are greater the less aligned a country's\neconomy with the business cycles of other countries.\nTo measure banks' expected risk and return in international lending, we would ideally\nlike to use corporate bond indices. However, we found data availability to be too limited\nfor non-Western countries.10 Since the benefits of portfolio diversification result in large\npart from the inclusion of countries with relatively asynchronous business cycles, a sample\ndominated by developed countries (from the Western hemisphere) with strong business cycle\nco-movements would underestimate the potential for international portfolio diversification.\nHence, we choose a stock market index (from MSCI Barra) as the representative asset, ie\nwe map the international credit allocation problem into one among national equity indices.\nThis allows us to construct a dataset with a representative sample of 35 countries from all\nregions of the world which comprehensively reflects the investment opportunity set of German\nThe firm-value model by Merton (1974) provides a compelling rationale for the idea that\nthe stock market should contain information about creditworthiness. In a nutshell, the payoff\nto holders of a company's risky debt is interpreted as the sum of safe debt, ie the face value,\nand a short put option on the company's asset value with strike price equal to the face value\nof debt. A firm's debt value and default probability thus depend on the development of its\nasset value: while the expected rate of return on the firm's asset value raises the value of\nrisky debt and reduces the probability of default, the opposite holds for the volatility of the\nasset value. Since the value of a firm's assets is not observable, industry models descending\nfrom Merton-type firm-value models infer the asset value and its development over time from\nthat of a company's stock.12\n10This has also been pointed out by Buch et al. (2010) who use government bond indices as representative\n11The broader country coverage by using equity instead of corporate bond indices also leads to higher\ncross-country heterogeneity in the frictions we examine. Therefore, we should be better able to identify the\nrelevant effects.\n12That is the case, for instance, in Moody's KMV. For details on this and other credit risk models, see\nWe take that as the starting point for our optimisation and proxy a country's represen-\ntative firm by the return moments of its respective MSCI Barra stock market index.13 Each\nequity index in isolation is characterised by expected return  and standard deviation . It\nfollows from above that banks will, ceteris paribus, prefer companies from countries with\nhigher 's and lower 's. In addition, the pairwise correlations  of national indices proxy\nfor the degree to which equity markets (and business cycles) in the respective countries move\ntogether. At lower values of , banks are more likely to engage in diversification between\ncountries.\nTable 3 reports regional return characteristics at the end of 2007 for our sample of 35\ncountries. Interestingly, monthly mean returns are highest in South America and South &\nSoutheast Asia (1.9% each), and lowest in Western and Eastern Europe (0.7% each). Despite\na relatively high figure for the developed region of North America (1.4%), mean returns in\nregions consisting primarily of developing and emerging economies tend to exceed those\nin developed regions (also see Table A.2). However, Western Europe and North America\ncarry substantially lower individual risk. Their return standard deviations of 5.3 and 5.5%,\nrespectively, are lower than those of any other region in the world. This suggests that their\nlending environments are more stable than other parts of the world. In contrast, the regions\nwith the highest mean returns, South America and South & Southeast Asia, are also those\nwith the highest standard deviations (10.6 and 9.4%, respectively). This indicates a risk-\nreturn trade-off in international lending.\nThe return correlations presented in Table 3 underline the potential diversification gains\nthat might be realised by lending abroad. As expected, correlations are consistently higher\nwithin than between regions. The correlation between Western Europe and South & South\nEast Asia (0.28), for instance, is less than half that of Western European countries amongst\neach other (0.65). Returns are also highly correlated between Western Europe and North\nAmerica (0.59), while correlations are significantly lower with all other regions of the world,\nwhich consist predominantly of emerging an developing economies. Returns in the latter\ngroup of countries are far from being perfectly aligned with each other as well. This suggests\nthat explicitly discriminating between single regions and countries in the emerging and de-\nveloping world, rather than treating them as a homogeneous block, may further increase the\nbenefits from diversification.\n13To keep our analysis tractable, we only borrow from industry models that stock prices contain valuable\ninformation on the development of a firm's creditworthiness, but do not employ any of the sophistications (eg,\nas introduced in Moody's KMV). At the cost of losing some precision, this should still give a broadly accurate\nand consistent picture across countries. Moreover, one may argue that national equity indices only reflect the\nfinancial health of large, publicly listed companies and might give an incomplete view of the representative\ncompany whenever smaller, non-listed companies are doing better or worse. While this may be the case at\na point in time, it would have to occur systematically and for protracted periods of time to present a major\nshortcoming of our approach.\nTable 3: Return characteristics, by region (year-end 2007)\nMonthly return Correlations\nNotes -- All values are based on calculations using nine years of monthly euro/deutschmark returns on the 35 representative\nassets in the sample. Reported are intra-region medians over constituent countries (see Table A.1). For correlations, values are\nmedians over pairwise correlations between individual countries of the respective groups.\nPortfolio optimisation. At the portfolio level, banks are assumed to minimise the\nreturn volatility  for any given level of expected return , or maximise  for any given\nlevel of . They are assumed to borrow at a risk-free rate r in the interbank market14 and\noptimally invest the funds in the risky representative assets under short-selling constraints.15\nOptimality is achieved when the Sharpe ratio -r\n\nof the overall portfolio is maximised. This\nis the case for any point on the capital market line connecting the risk-free asset and the\ntangency portfolio of risky representative assets on the efficient frontier. Any bank preferring\nhigher 's and lower 's will choose a portfolio along that line, regardless of its degree of risk\naversion. This portfolio is simply a mixture of the riskless asset and the tangency portfolio.16\nMore risk-averse banks invest more in the former and less in the latter, but the composition of\nthe risky tangency portfolio is the same for all banks.17 The optimal relative country shares\n14We focus on large international German banks (see 2.2) that rely heavily on short-term interbank loans\nto fund their operations rather than retail deposits.\n15Recall that we are ultimately interested in international bank loan portfolios. We rule out the possibility\nof short selling because, in that context, it lacks an intuitive explanation and does not appear economically\nsensible.\n16This separation theorem was first put forward in Tobin (1958), even though, in the strict sense, it applies\nto unconstrained portfolios only.\n17This holds to the extent that banks possess homogeneous information and expectations. More impor-\ntantly, it also requires that all banks be able to realise returns in the same way. We are aware that this\nassumption may be somewhat restrictive. For example, a bank located in the western part of Germany might\nhave closer ties to, or more precise knowledge of, markets in, say, the Benelux countries. It may therefore\nfind itself at an advantage over other German banks in picking borrowers and exploiting profit opportunities.\nIn all probability, the optimal portfolios will thus not be completely identical across banks: for any given\nbank, they are likely to differ somewhat with respect to the computed portfolio. The computation of bank-\nindividual benchmark portfolios at this stage would hence require knowledge of their specific expertise and\nstrategy towards particular countries, which are naturally unobserved. However, one can reasonably assume\nthat these are inherent traits of individual banks with little, if any, change over time. This allows us to\naccount for heterogeneity later by including bank-country specific effects in our regression analysis (see 4.1).\nfrom mean-variance optimisation can then be obtained as the weights of representative assets\nin the tangency portfolio.\nThe inputs for the optimisation (ie, expected returns, standard deviations, and correla-\ntions) are unobserved and need to be estimated from historical returns. Hence, we use a\nrolling-window approach on the basis of monthly returns. This yields a portfolio for each\nyear-end in the sample period.18 We also account for the caveat that the optimality and\nout-of-sample performance of the computed portfolios can often be severely impaired when\npoint estimates are treated as if they were known with certainty. That is because optimal\nportfolios are very sensitive with respect to the inputs. In particular, mean returns are sub-\nject to estimation error (see, eg, Michaud 1989). Neglecting this often leads to portfolios that\nare unrealistically exclusive, ie contain only very few of the initial assets, and are unstable\nover time.19 To mitigate this, we employ the portfolio resampling technique from the asset\nto parametrically bootstrapping from a distribution characterised by the estimates of the\nexpected returns, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients. The idea is to calculate\na separate efficient frontier and optimal representative-asset portfolio for each draw, with\nthe bootstrapped optimal portfolio obtaining as the average of optimal portfolios from those\ndraws.20 Indeed, the resampled portfolio weights turn out to be more balanced and much\nless volatile.\nAccounting for credit demand. The weights from (resampled) mean-variance opti-\nmisation over representative assets do not consider potential credit demand. A small country,\nfor example, does not possess the same capacity to absorb credit as larger countries do. How-\never, pure mean-variance optimisation may assign a weight well above the small country's\nshare of credit demand relative to the countries in the portfolio. Sensible benchmark port-\nfolios ought to account for this and be anchored around the relative credit demands of the\nother countries in our sample. In line with the terminology introduced by Black and Litter-\n18We choose the length of the rolling window to be 9 years due to a trade-off. On the one hand, we\nrequire that the window be long enough to give reasonably reliable parameter estimates. We would like to\ncharacterise returns through the business cycle in order to learn about country fundamentals as well as to\nlimit the impact that short-term developments, for instance, stock market rallies, might have. The use of\n120 months of data, as very often done in the asset allocation literature, would therefore seem appropriate.\nOn the other hand, restrictions on the availability of the indices mean we would have to drop several Eastern\nEuropean countries with a major foreign bank presence (see, eg, de Haas and van Lelyveld 2006, Havrylchyk\nand Jurzyk 2011), and potentially strategic importance for German banks in particular. However, we can\ninclude those countries at the quite limited cost of reducing the window length by just one year to 9 years.\n19The latter would be a particularly undesirable property since we mentioned earlier on that, in the presence\nof (fixed) transaction costs, banks should be expected to shy away from massively rebalancing their credit\nportfolios on an ongoing basis.\n20We make 1,000 draws and trace out each efficient frontier along 100 equally divided returns between the\nminimum and maximum returns. For a detailed description of the procedure, see Scherer (2002) or Michaud\nman (1992), those relative credit demands can be thought of as neutral starting points for an\ninternational credit portfolio. Mean-variance optimisation then provides the bank with views\non the relative merit of investing in different countries from a diversification perspective, so it\ncan adjust the neutral weights accordingly. As credit demand is frequently proxied by GDP\nin the literature and, for our purposes, it also has the desirable property of being largely\nunaffected by the country-specific frictions of interest, we use relative GDP shares as neutral\nanchors.21 Since it is unclear how much confidence a bank would place in mean-variance op-\ntimisation as opposed to the neutral weights at any given point in time, we employ a simple\nheuristic and define the final benchmark weight for a country as the unweighted average of its\nweight from resampled mean-variance optimisation and its relative GDP share.22 However,\nour results are robust to alternative weighting schemes which put gradually more weight on\nthe outcome from mean-variance optimisation and less on relative GDP shares.\n3.2 Deviations from the benchmark\nTable 4 gives a first overview of how German banks' actual portfolios deviate from the\nbenchmark portfolios for the top ten lending destinations at the end of 2007. The degree of\noverweighting is the difference between a country's median actual weight and its benchmark\nweight according to the optimisation procedure outlined in 3.1.\nEight of the ten most important lending destinations are overweighted to varying degrees\nrelative to the benchmark, while Italy and Russia are underweighted. The US and UK\nare the two most overweighted countries in German banks' credit portfolios (13.9 and 10.5\npercentage points, respectively).23 Even though the actual weight on the US is about twice\nthat of the UK, their degrees of overweighting are quite similar. This is due to the much\nhigher benchmark weight for the US. In contrast, Russia is heavily underweighted (\u00ad9.2\npercentage points) relative to a similarly high benchmark weight of 10.2%.\nOverall, Table 4 indicates a significant potential for diversification by lending to un-\nderweighted countries. In the next section, we analyse empirically which country-specific\nfrictions explain why countries are over- or underweighted.\nas a credit-demand proxy in different contexts.\n22Similar heuristics are often applied in other contexts with multiple plausible decision criteria, but in\nwhich no single criterion is clearly superior. For instance, the shares of national central banks in the European\nCentral Bank's capital are calculated using a key which is the unweighted average of countries' population\nand GDP shares. Also see Altman et al. (2002), who propose a \"fifty-fifty\" weighting scheme as a simple and\ntransparent reference point in the context of shock analysis.\nTable 4: Overweighting for top ten lending destinations (year-end 2007)\nCountry Overweighting Actual weight Benchmark weight\nNotes -- Data are from the Deutsche Bundesbank (External Position Reports of German Banks). Overweighting is defined as\nthe difference in percentage points between actual and benchmark weights. Actual weights are median country shares based on\nthe credit portfolios of individual banks. Benchmark weights are calculated according to the methodology in 3.1. All figures\nrefer to the sample of 18 internationally oriented German banks and the representative set of 35 countries.\n4 Empirical setup\n4.1 Estimation framework\nWe use the benchmark portfolios as the reference point for banks' actual international credit\nportfolios to investigate the impact of country-specific frictions with the following econometric\nmodel:\nowcbt\n=  + INTEGct\n + INSTct\n + Xct\n + cb\n+ cbt .\nHere, owcbt\n= wcbt\n- optct is the degree of overweighting of country c in bank b's interna-\ntional credit portfolio at the end of year t, ie the difference between the actual weight wcbt\nand the optimal weight optct from the benchmark. cb is a bank-country specific effect that\ncaptures individual bank behaviour towards specific countries in our dataset.\nFor instance, some banks may be better able to exploit investment opportunities in certain\ncountries due to greater expertise or experience in a market while others may single out\nstrategically important countries without the aim to diversify. Due to the bank-country\ndimension of our dataset we can control for such unobserved time-invariant bank-country\nspecific heterogeneity. This is a major advantage over the study by Buch et al. (2010).\nThe country-specific frictions are included in the vectors INTEGct and INSTct, and\nare described in the subsection below. INTEGct is a matrix of variables that measure\nthe degree of economic integration. Variables included are geographical distance (DIST), a\ndummy variable which indicates whether the lending destination has a common border with\nGermany (BORDER), and its relative importance as a destination for German foreign direct\ninvestment in the real sector (FDI). We also check whether eurozone membership (EURO)\nbiases banks' credit portfolios towards eurozone countries.\nINSTct controls for the institutional and regulatory framework. It includes variables on\nthe overall institutional environment (INSTITUTION) and the degree of private monitoring\nin the destination country (PMI). Moreover, we account for banking regulations such as\nentry requirements in the host country (ENTRY), regulatory requirements regarding bank\ncapitalisation (CAPITAL), while restrictions on non-traditional bank activities are measured\nby RESTRICT. We also control for whether the destination country hosts a major financial\ncentre (CENTRE).\nXct is a matrix of additional control variables. The country-specific frictions are described\nin greater detail in the following. Table A.3 provides a summary of their definitions and data\nsources. As most of the variables do not vary over time, we estimate the model by random\neffects. We do use fixed effects, though, to check the robustness of the results for the time-\nvarying variables in our model. Also note that we cannot include bank variables in the\nregression as level terms since the regression coefficients would be zero by definition.24 As a\nfurther robustness check, however, we later exploit the bank-level dimension of our dataset\nby including interaction terms to identify whether the banks in our sample differ in their\nreactions to frictions.\n4.2 Country-specific frictions\nThe previous section has shown that German banks' actual credit portfolios deviate from\nour benchmark portfolios. In line with the literature on international banking, we identify\nthe following frictions which might cause the over- or underweighting of countries in banks'\nportfolios.\n(1) Economic integration. We expect the degree of economic integration with Ger-\nmany to be an important determinant of banks' deviations from the benchmark portfolios.\nTo measure economic integration we use the following variables:\nDistance (DIST) is measured as the log great-circle distance between the most important\ncities or agglomerations of Germany and the destination country. It has long been used in\n24This is the case because we look at countries' shares in the international credit portfolios of German\nbanks. Those are defined as percentages. Hence, even though larger banks, on average, extend more credit\nto any given country than smaller banks, the portfolio shares for each bank in any given year always add up\nto 100%. Equivalently, the over- or underweightings for a bank will add up to zero. The regression coefficient\nof any bank variable in levels will therefore be zero as well.\nestimating gravity equations in international trade, and has recently been investigated in the\nliterature on the international holdings and flows of financial assets as well.25 That literature\nhas identified two rival hypotheses for the impact of distance (see, eg, Portes et al. 2001).\nAccording to the first hypothesis, the absolute level of holdings or flows should increase with\ndistance since business cycle correlations tend to decrease with distance (also see Table 3).\nThis indicates a positive relationship between distance and absolute holdings or flows. The\nsecond hypothesis postulates that distance is a proxy for the severity of informational frictions\nbecause information flows are generally lower between more distant countries. This suggests\na negative relationship between distance and absolute holdings or flows.\nIn this paper, we explicitly model diversification opportunities and evaluate international\ncredit portfolios relative to the benchmark portfolios containing optimal country weights.\nThe benchmark portfolios already account for the first hypothesis from above, according to\nwhich the potential for diversification increases with distance. Hence, our regressions amount\nto a test of the hypothesis that informational frictions increase monotonically with distance,\nand that more distant countries should be less overweighted, or more underweighted, relative\nto the benchmark. This suggests a negative coefficient on DIST.\nAs an alternative measure, we include a dummy indicating whether a destination coun-\ntry borders on Germany (BORDER) . By the same reasoning, we would expect a positive\nrelationship between BORDER and the degree of overweighting.\nOutward foreign direct investment in the real sector (FDI) is included to account for\nthe fact that banks may follow domestic companies when those venture abroad and set\nup operations in a foreign country.26 This decision might not be primarily driven by the\ndesire to seek a particular foreign exposure but to retain an already existing customer base\nat home. In a way, this follow-your-client motive can be viewed as competing with that of\ninternational diversification. This may be particularly relevant in a bank-dominated financial\nsystem like Germany where many firms rely on their so-called \"Hausbank\" for funding rather\nthan on capital markets (see, eg, Onetti and Pisoni 2009). To investigate the follow-your-\nclient motive, we use a country's share in the real-sector outward FDI stocks of German\nnon-banks.27 In line with the follow-your-customer hypothesis, we would expect a positive\nimpact on overweighting.\n25See Portes et al. (2001) and Portes and Rey (2005) for cross-border trade in equities, corporate bonds,\nand government bonds, and Aviat and Coeurdacier (2007) for bilateral bank asset holdings.\n26This rationale for the international activity of banks has been stressed as early as Goldberg and Saunders\nof the follow-your-client motive than earlier contributions (eg, Yamori 1998, Brealey and Kaplanis 1996).\n27We do not include FDI by banks or other financial firms in that measure. The establishment of subsidiaries\nin a foreign country by banks would not only be reflected in an increase of the FDI measure, but also of that\ncountry's overweighting in banks' portfolios. We would therefore introduce simultaneity into our estimation.\nEurozone membership (EURO) might also affect whether a country is overweighted or\nunderweighted against the benchmark. Hence, we include a dummy variable which takes on\na value of one if a country is a member of the eurozone, and zero otherwise. Several empirical\nstudies provide evidence that the adoption of the euro may enhance financial integration.28\nKalemli-Ozcan et al. (2010) mention different potential channels explaining those results.\nThey identify the elimination of exchange rate risk and legislative-regulatory reforms along\nwith the introduction of the euro as important drivers. In any case, eurozone membership\nshould be positively related to the degree of overweighting.\n(2) Institutional and regulatory environment. Over- or underweighting is also\nlikely to depend on the institutional and regulatory environment in the destination country\nwhich is measured by the following variables:29\nThe overall institutional environment (INSTITUTION) variable captures the quality of\ngovernance in a country. It is the simple average of six governance indicators compiled by the\nWorld Bank (see Table A.3 for a list). Higher values indicate a more developed institutional\nenvironment. We expect INSTITUTION to be positively associated with the overweighting\nmeasure.\nWe also include the Private Monitoring Index (PMI) to examine whether scrutiny from\nprivate market forces helps explain deviations from the benchmark. The index mainly reflects\nthe amount of financial information banks have to disclose to the public. Higher values are\nassociated with stricter requirements. On the one hand, we would expect banks to steer clear\nof markets with higher reporting requirements. This effect would unfold solely through local\noperations as banks' cross-border operations would remain unaffected. On the other hand,\nbetter private monitoring of banks is positively associated with a higher level of development\nin the banking sector (Barth et al. 2006, 2008). Furthermore, countries which require banks\nto provide the public with a significant amount of information might apply similar reporting\nstandards to non-banks as well. In that case, higher index values would indicate increased\ntransparency on the part of borrowers. This would enhance the ability of banks to screen\nor monitor potential borrowers and thereby increase the attractiveness of the destination\ncountry. Hence, the relationship between PMI and overweighting may also be positive.\nThe Entry into Banking Requirements Index (ENTRY) measures the restrictiveness of\nrequirements that banks have to meet in order to obtain a banking licence. It considers\n28Lane (2006) and Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2005) provide evidence of a eurozone bias in the international\nholdings by euro-area countries in bonds and equity, respectively. Similarly, Blank and Buch (2007) detect a\npositive and significant impact of the euro on the bilateral foreign assets held by banks.\n29These indices are constructed from the World Bank's Bank Regulation and Supervision Database ac-\ncording to the methodology in Barth et al. (2001). We use values from the second and third waves to capture\nwhether it is necessary to submit, for instance, organisational charts, financial projections\nand information, the prior banking experience of managers and directors, or the sources of\nfunds for capitalisation. The effect of this restrictiveness on the degree of overweighting is not\nclear a priori. On the one hand, greater requirements make it harder for banks to obtain a\nlicence. This hampers banks' ability to serve their potential clients through local operations.\nTo the extent that those cannot be fully substituted by lending from banks' headquarters,\nthis would imply a tendency for countries with stricter requirements to be underweighted,\nor less overweighted. On the other hand, (foreign) banks may be attracted by more heavily\nregulated markets if they hope to reap higher profits due to lower competition, mainly from\ndomestic banks (see, eg, Focarelli and Pozzolo 2005). Such opportunities for excess profits\nare not reflected in the benchmark. Banks might therefore also overweight countries with\nstricter requirements.\nThe Capital Regulatory Index (CAPITAL) captures regulations pertaining to bank cap-\nitalisation. It considers factors such as minimum capital requirements, the stringency with\nwhich losses have to be deducted from reported capital, or the assets allowable as capital.\nThe potential impact of capital regulation on overweighting is through banks' local opera-\ntions or, more precisely, subsidiaries. In contrast to branches, subsidiaries are incorporated\nunder local law and are legally separate entities from their parent banks. The latter generally\ndo not assume responsibility for the liabilities of their subsidiaries. Therefore, subsidiaries\nneed to be capitalised independently and have to comply with the capital regulations in the\nhost country.30 While more demanding regulations might reduce the attractiveness of a lend-\ning destination, they could also give (large) foreign banks a competitive edge over (small)\ndomestic banks because they may be better able to raise capital than domestic institutions.\nRestrictions on bank activities (RESTRICT) might also affect the propensity of banks to\noverweight a destination country in their portfolios. For example, banks may want to engage\nin business other than traditional lending. Prohibitions or limitations on such business might\nbias banks against a particular market more generally. This, in turn, could have a negative\nspillover effect on the amount of standard bank loans granted. We investigate this by using\nan index measuring the restrictions on banks with regard to securities, insurance, or real\nestate business as well as the ownership of non-financial firms. Since higher values imply\n30However, Cerutti et al. (2007) point out that the distinction between branches and subsidiaries has\nbecome rather blurred in practice. Parent banks have increasingly used \"ring-fencing\" provisions to limit the\nresponsibility for their branches, too. Host countries are likely to differ in the degree to which they allow\nbanks to negotiate such provisions. While we do not possess data on that, countries with more stringent\ncapital regulations might also be less inclined to relieve parent banks from their responsibility to support\ntheir branches. Then, the estimated effect of capital regulations would also work through the channel of\nbranches.\ngreater restrictiveness, we would expect a negative relationship between RESTRICT and the\ndegree of overweighting.\nFinally, we account for the presence of financial centres (CENTRE).31 Controlling for\nfinancial centres is necessary because our lending aggregate also contains lending to insur-\nance companies and other financial institutions, which are, technically, non-banks. Since\ninternationally oriented banks are highly active in the money markets, the overweighting we\nobserve for countries with financial centres is partly the consequence of lending to non-bank\nfinancial counterparties located there. However, overweighting a financial centre for that\nreason cannot be considered a strategic decision to seek exposure to a specific country risk.\nFor variable definitions and data sources see Table A.3.\nOur regression analysis proceeds as follows. As a baseline, we estimate different models\nincluding the frictions related to economic integration and the institutional and regulatory\nenvironment. We then augment those by additional country controls for the level of competi-\ntion and development of banking markets as well as the degree of risk-taking in the banking\nsector. Finally, we present a number of further robustness checks of our results. Tables A.4\nand A.5 show descriptive statistics and correlations, respectively, of all variables used in the\nregressions.\n5.1 Baseline results\nWe first estimate a model with the frictions related to economic integration (Model 1). To\ncontrol for the institutional environment in the host country, we add our overall governance\nindicator (Model 2). We then account for banking regulations instead of the overall institu-\ntional framework (Model 3), before including all institutional and regulatory variables jointly\n(Model 4). The results are presented in Table 5.\nIn line with the follow-your-customer hypothesis, we find a large and significantly positive\nrelationship between outward foreign direct investment in the real sector (FDI) and the degree\nof overweighting in all regressions. This is consistent with the view that existing economic\nintegration in the real sector promotes financial integration.\nThe euro area dummy (EURO), in contrast, is positive but insignificant indicating that\nthe impact of the euro on credit market integration might be limited. This contrasts with\n31In line with the literature, the countries classified as financial centres in our dataset are Ireland, Switzer-\nland, and the United Kingdom.\nTable 5: Baseline results\nDIST\nBORDER\nFDI\nEURO\nCENTRE\nINSTITUTION\nPMI\nENTRY\nCAPITAL\nRESTRICT\nNotes -- Robust standard errors (clustered at the bank-country level) in parentheses.

Marginal effects on INSTITUTION, PMI, ENTRY, CAPITAL, and RESTRICT are reported for a change\nby one respective sample standard deviation. ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1, 5, and 10% levels, respectively. All\nestimations are based on the sample of 18 internationally oriented German banks and the representative set of 35 countries. For\nvariable definitions and data sources, see Table A.3. Descriptive statistics and correlations are provided in Tables A.4 and A.5,\nrespectively.\nLane (2006), who analyses the bilateral composition of international bond portfolios and\nshows that euro area member countries disproportionately invest in one another relative to\nother country pairs. He interprets this as evidence for a euro area bias.32 Jappelli and\nPagano (2008) find a positive effect of the euro on bond and stock markets as well. However,\na considerable body of empirical literature also suggests that credit markets have integrated\nmuch more slowly than bond or stock markets, and that they are still separated along national\ndue to the fact that we only consider large, internationally oriented banks that are better\nat managing exchange rate risk and for which, as a consequence, eurozone membership may\nDistance from and a common border with Germany do not seem to have an impact on the\ninternational credit allocation of German banks either. Since diversification opportunities\nrelated to distance are incorporated in the benchmark portfolios, both variables capture\ninformational asymmetries. If informational frictions increase monotonically with distance,\nwe would expect more distant countries to be less overweighted, or more underweighted,\nrelative to the benchmark. Our results suggest this is not the case as the coefficients on both\nDIST and BORDER turn out to be insignificant.35 This is in line with Buch et al. (2010) who\ndo not detect a significant relationship between distance and the probability of a country's\nbeing overweighted either.\nWhile most frictions related to economic integration do not matter, frictions related to the\ninstitutional environment in general, and banking regulations in particular, do. The positive\nand significant coefficient for ENTRY, for instance, suggests that banks overweight countries\nwith stricter entry requirements. Focarelli and Pozzolo (2005) argue that banks may be\nattracted by more heavily regulated markets if they hope to reap higher profits due to a\nlower level of competition. This corresponds to findings of Barth et al. (2004) and Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-\nKunt et al. (2004).36 They show that financial systems with greater entry restrictions record\nhigher net interest margins and overhead expenditures due to a lower level competition\n32Further evidence on bond and equity portfolio composition is provided by De Santis and G\u00e9rard (2006).\nKalemli-Ozcan et al. (2010) more closely investigate the underlying channels of the euro's effects on financial\nintegration. They find that the euro's impact on financial integration is primarily driven by the elimination\nof currency risk. Legislative-regulatory convergence has also contributed to the spur of cross-border financial\ntransactions, while trade in goods does not play a key role in explaining the euro's positive effect on financial\nintegration.\n33Adam et al. (2002)and Baele et al. (2004) show that there are persistent interest rate differentials in\nthe medium and long term in the corporate loan and the consumer credit markets. More recent evidence is\nprovided by the European Central Bank (2011).\n34More generally, German banks' foreign exchange exposure is fairly limited, indicating that they hedge\nthemselves against those risks (Deutsche Bundesbank 2011).\n35To check whether these results are robust to collinearity between DIST and BORDER, we re-run the\nregressions dropping each variable in turn. The coefficients remain insignificant throughout.\nthan other countries. This is consistent with our results. Once we include the average net\ninterest margin and stock market capitalisation in the host country as additional controls,\nENTRY loses significance (see Table 6). A lower level of banking sector competition and\nefficiency may allow foreign banks to generate excess profits due to superior management\nskills and technologies required to run international operations. Such profit opportunities\nare not reflected in our benchmark.\nOpportunities for excess profits could also explain the results for RESTRICT and CAPI-\nTAL. The positive coefficient for RESTRICT indicates that banks overweight countries with\nstricter activity restrictions. This may again be the consequence of reduced competition\nand efficiency in a destination country's banking sector as shown by Barth et al. (2004) and\nDemirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt et al. (2004). The evidence is weak, however, as RESTRICT turns out to\nbe insignificant in many regressions. CAPITAL, in contrast, is significant in all regressions.\nGerman banks appear to overweight countries with stricter capital requirements, which might\nreduce the competitive strength of low-quality banks vis-\u00e0-vis high quality banks. This may\nincrease lending rates and encourage the entry of foreign banks (Boot and Marinc 2006).\nFurthermore, the subsidiaries of (large) foreign banks might have easier access to capital\nthrough their parents and, hence, be better able to meet higher capital requirements than\n(small) domestic banks. This may allow them to increase their lending and market share\nrelative to locally incorporated banks.\nINSTITUTION, the aggregate governance indicator, is insignificant in most regressions.\nThis contrasts with the Private Monitoring Index (PMI). Its positive and significant coeffi-\ncient suggests that German banks overweight countries with higher reporting requirements\nfor banks. Barth et al. (2006, 2008) offer an explanation for this. They show that better\nprivate monitoring of banks is positively associated with a higher level of development in the\nbanking sector. This is consistent with our results. Once we control for the level of banking\nsector size and development, PMI becomes insignificant (see Table 6). This indicates that\nthe positive effect of PMI on overweighting is primarily through its impact on the size and\ndevelopment of the banking sector in the host country. CENTRE is positive and significant\nas well underlining the need to control for the presence of financial centres.\n5.2 Additional country controls\nAs a first robustness check and to learn more about the channels proposed above, we augment\nthe regression containing all frictions (Model 4) by additional country controls.37 The results\nare presented in Table 6. The ratios of private credit to GDP (PCRDGDP) and stock market\ncapitalisation to GDP (STMKTCAP) control for the size and development of banking and\n37All additional controls are from the World Bank's Financial Structure Database (Beck et al. 2010).\nfinancial markets (Models 5 and 7). In addition, we include the average net interest margin\n(NIM) and the log average Z-score of the banking sector (ZSCORE) as proxies for the level\nof competition and bank risk-taking in the host country, respectively (Models 6 and 7).\nThe ratio of private credit to GDP (PCRDGDP) has been used as a proxy for the size\nand development of banking markets (see, eg, Driessen and Laeven 2007, Beck et al. 2010).\nCountries with more developed banking systems should have deeper markets with better\ndiversification opportunities. Moreover, banking sector development is likely to depend on\nthe institutional and regulatory environment in the host country, both on the characteristics\nwe are able to control for and those for which we are not. Hence, PCRDGDP may also be\nregarded as a robustness check for the impact of the frictions we investigate and as capturing\n\"residual\" frictions. Since frictions should decrease with banking sector development, we\nwould expect PCRDGDP to be positively related to the degree of overweighting. This is\nwhat we find. In line with our hypothesis, PCRDGDP turns out to be significantly positive\nin all regressions.\nWe also include the ratio of stock market capitalisation over GDP, which is often regarded\nas an indicator for the relative size and level of development of financial markets (Driessen\nand Laeven 2007, Beck et al. 2010). In contrast to PCRDGDP, STMKTCAP is significantly\nnegative, indicating that German banks tend to underweight countries with larger and more\ndeveloped stock markets, possibly due to a lower demand for bank finance and greater com-\npetition with other non-bank intermediaries and financial markets. This is supported by the\nfact that countries with higher net interest margins are overweighted by German banks as\nsuggested by the positive and significant coefficient for NIM. The net interest margin is often\nused to measure the operational efficiency and competitive nature of a banking sector, where\nhigher margins are generally associated with less competition (Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt et al. 2004,\nBeck et al. 2010).38 Interestingly, ENTRY becomes less significant once we include NIM in\nthe regression. This supports our earlier interpretation that ENTRY may proxy for the level\nof competition in the banking sector.\nFinally, we include the Z-score of each country's banking system. The Z-score measures\nbank stability, with higher scores indicating greater stability (see, eg, Boyd and Nicol\u00f3 2005,\nLaeven and Levine 2009).39 If banks preferred countries with a more stable banking system,\n38The net interest margin (NIM) equals interest income minus interest expense divided by interest-bearing\nassets. As a further robustness test, we replace NIM by the ratio of overhead costs divided by total assets\n(OVERHEAD). Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt et al. (2004) argue that OVERHEAD is an alternative indicator for the level\nof efficiency and market competition, since higher overhead costs reflect greater cost inefficiencies and market\npower. The coefficient for OVERHEAD turns out to be significant and positive in line with the hypothesis\nthat German banks tend to overweight countries with a less efficient and competitive banking sector. The\nresults are not reported for the sake of brevity.\n39It is defined as the ratio of the return on assets plus the capital ratio divided by the standard deviation\nof the return on assets. If profits are normally distributed, the Z-score is the inverse of the probability of\nTable 6: Results including additional country controls\nDIST\nBORDER\nFDI\nEURO\nCENTRE\nINSTITUTION\nPMI\nENTRY\nCAPITAL\nRESTRICT\nPCRDGDP\nSTMKTCAP\nNIM\nZSCORE\nNotes -- Robust standard errors (clustered at the bank-country level) in parentheses.

Descriptive statistics and correlations are provided in Tables A.4 and A.5,\nrespectively.\nwe would expect them to overweight countries with a higher Z-score. This is not the case.\nIn contrast, our results suggest that German banks tend to overweight countries with a\nless stable banking system in their portfolio as indicated by the significant and negative\ncoefficient for ZSCORE. Since, on average, net interest margins declined over the sample\nperiod, the banks in our sample might have increased their lending to less stable countries\neither deliberately to raise their profits or ignorantly due to a failure of risk management\nsystems that reduced risk perception.\nThe results for ZSCORE also support the mechanisms of our benchmark portfolio model.\nIf the risks banks incurred in the run-up to the crisis are not fully captured by this model,\nwe would expect countries to receive a lower benchmark weight due to smaller risk-adjusted\nreturns once we control for these risks. In particular, countries exposed to a high level of\nbanking sector risk should receive lower benchmark weights. Hence, these countries should be\neven more overweighted in our model. The negative and significant coefficient for ZSCORE\nindicates that this is the case. The results for ZSCORE, therefore, do not only suggest that\nbanks increasingly lent to countries with less stable banking sectors, but also supports the\nmechanisms of our portfolio model. They also indicate that the results for the other control\nvariables are robust even if we control for the level of banking sector risk.\nOverall, our results suggest that German banks tend to overweight countries with larger\nand more developed banking markets that offer greater opportunities to generate excess\nprofits due to a lower level of competition and efficiency. We also find evidence that the\nbanks in our sample lent to more risky countries, possibly to raise their profits or due to a\nlower risk perception. More importantly, however, the results for the remaining variables are\nlargely unchanged. Only ENTRY and PMI become insignificant in line with our hypothesis\nthat they may proxy for the level of competition and development in the banking sector.\n5.3 Robustness checks\nAs a last step, we perform several tests to check the robustness of our findings. The results are\nreported in Table 7. First, we test whether our results are robust with respect to the sample\nperiod from 2003 to 2007. Even though the most severe period of the financial crisis started\nin September 2008 with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the first stage of the crisis already\nbegan in 2007. For example, starting in August 2007 banking flows slowed down primarily\namong developed countries due to increased uncertainty among banks (Milesi-Ferretti and\nTille 2011). A priori, we would think that this should not affect our results because the first\ninsolvency. More specifically, it indicates the number of standard deviations below the expected value of a\nbank's return on assets at which equity is depleted and the bank is insolvent (Roy 1952, Hannan and Hanweck\nstage of the crisis was mainly limited to the interbank market, while we focus on non-bank\ncredit. However, to check the robustness of our results, we restrict our sample period to the\nSecond, we test whether our results are robust to the country sample. We are partic-\nularly concerned that our results may be driven by the inclusion of the US and UK since\nthey dominate in German banks' international credit portfolios (see Table 2). For this rea-\nson, we exclude both countries from the sample and re-estimate our model. The results are\npresented in Models 10 and 11 of Table 7. They confirm our findings for ENTRY and PMI.\nCAPITAL also remains significant and positive. In addition, EURO becomes positive and\nsignificant, possibly because the non-eurozone countries US and UK are both heavily over-\nweighted against the benchmark. FDI, in contrast, is insignificant once we exclude the UK\nand US. However, if we exclude both 2007 as well as the UK and the US, FDI is significantly\npositive again. Furthermore, in all other robustness checks FDI remains significant and pos-\nitive. Hence, the overall evidence is in support of the follow-your-customer hypothesis for\nGerman banks. The results of the other control variables are also unchanged.\nIn addition, we exploit the bank-level dimension of our dataset by including interaction\nterms between the country-specific frictions and bank size, proxied by total assets, to identify\nwhether banks react differently to country-specific factors. The size of a bank can be regarded\nas a measure of its international orientation or its experience in different lines of business\nwith a variety of customers. Larger banks may also have stronger incentives to diversify\ninternationally (Focarelli and Pozzolo 2005). Deviations from the benchmark induced by a\ncountry-specific factor might differ across banks, for instance because it may be easier for\nlarger banks to overcome informational asymmetries than smaller banks. Since we already\nfocus on a group of large and internationally oriented German banks, however, we would not\nexpect major differences in reactions for our sample. Indeed, we find that the interaction\nterms turn out to be insignificant, whereas the level terms remain very similar in both\nmagnitude and significance. The country-specific frictions we identify as being important\ndeterminants of international credit portfolios seem to affect all German banks in largely\nequal measure. This supports our choice of bank sample.\nWe also test whether our results change if we re-estimate all models for those banks that\nare considered systemically important by the Deutsche Bundesbank. Furthermore, we check\nwhether the results are robust to the exclusion of all countries that host an international\nfinancial centre. Even though this considerably reduces the total number of observations,\nthe results remain unchanged. Finally, we estimate our model with the fixed instead of the\nrandom effects estimator to test the robustness of the time-varying variables and confirm our\nresults. The results of these robustness tests are not reported for the sake of brevity.\nTable 7: Robustness checks\nDIST\nBORDER\nFDI\nEURO\nCENTRE\nINSTITUTION\nPMI\nENTRY\nCAPITAL\nRESTRICT\nPCRDGDP\nSTMKTCAP\nNIM\nZSCORE\nNotes -- Robust standard errors (clustered at the bank-country level) in parentheses.

Descriptive statistics and correlations are provided in Tables A.4 and A.5,\nrespectively.\n6 Conclusion\nGerman banks have massively increased their foreign exposure over the past two decades\nby both an increase in their cross-border activities and the establishment of branches and\nsubsidiaries abroad. Therefore, major German banks are now heavily dependent on the de-\nvelopment of their foreign assets. At the same time, business cycles across the world continue\nto exhibit notable asynchronicity, giving rise to international diversification opportunities.\nIn this paper, we investigate which country-specific determinants make German banks\noverweight some countries and underweight others in their international credit portfolios.\nMore specifically, we ask which geographical, institutional, and regulatory frictions cause\nGerman banks to leave opportunities for diversification unexploited. To this end, we construct\na bank-country panel for the period between 2003 and 2007 on the basis of the External\nPosition Reports of German Banks, a unique dataset provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank.\nFor large, internationally oriented German banks and a representative set of 35 countries\nfrom all regions of the world, we compare banks' actual international credit portfolios to\nmean-variance based benchmark portfolios that we would expect to observe in the absence\nof country-specific frictions.\nThe results show that banking regulations are important determinants of the credit al-\nlocation of German banks. We present robust evidence that countries with stricter capital\nadequacy and entry requirements tend to be overweighted, primarily due to excess profits\nresulting from a lower level of banking market competition. Moreover, German banks are\nfound to overweight countries with larger and more developed banking markets. In contrast,\ngeographical factors do not appear to matter. There is no evidence that informational asym-\nmetries are obstacles to international lending which increase monotonically with distance.\nWe also find support that German banks, in order to maintain existing lending relationships\nat home, follow their domestic customers abroad when those set up operations in a foreign\ncountry. Finally, the level of risk-taking in the host-country banking sector seems to matter\nas well since we observe that the banks in our sample increased their lending to countries\nwith riskier banking sectors.\nGerman banks' credit portfolios do not seem to be determined by country factors which\ncannot change over time. Instead, there is reason to believe that, in the long run, changes\nin and convergence of banking regulations as well as financial deepening of banking sectors\naround the world will result in banks holding more diversified international credit portfolios.\nDeviations from our benchmark portfolios should then gradually disappear and leave banks\nwith portfolios that make them more stable and resilient to country-specific shocks.\nReferences\nAdam, K., T.
