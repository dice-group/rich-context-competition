Der wichtigste An-\nsteckungsmechanismus ist eine beideitige Interaktion zwischen den Meinungen sekund\u00e4rer\nMarktinvestoren und dem Koordinationsversagen unter den Gl\u00e4ubiger der Finanzinsititu-\ntion.

As the\nepigraph suggests, such considerations were central during the failure of Northern Rock\nin 2007. But, notwithstanding important progress in developing top-down stress-testing\nmodels to help guide financial stability policy, quantifying the role of information conta-\ngion in systemic risk analysis has proven elusive.\nIn this paper, we present a tractable approach to quantifying information contagion\nand integrate it into the Bank of Canada's stress-testing model (the Macro-financial Risk\nAssessment Framework, or MFRAF). The model is calibrated to representative balance\nsheet data for the six largest Canadian banks, and we quantify the information conta-\ngion that arises from a stress-test scenario conducted by the IMF as part of its 2013\nFinancial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for Canada. Our results suggest that in-\nformation contagion is significant \u00ad the probability of one major bank entering distress\ndue to contagion alone is nearly 20% and the extreme tail associated with the system-\nwide distribution of bank losses is materially larger. We decompose the aggregate losses\nto the banking system into those arising from solvency risk, funding liquidity risk and\ninformation contagion.\nThe analytical foundation of our approach stems from the global games literature,\nwhich synthesizes the pure panic-based and fundamental-based views of bank runs. Work\nin this tradition (Morris and Shin, 2003; Rochet and Vives, 2004; Goldstein and Pauzner,\n2005) suggests that poor fundamentals can trigger self-fulfilling beliefs about a financial\ncrisis. A bank's funding liquidity risk is driven by credit and market losses, funding\ncomposition and maturity profile, and concerns over the bank's future solvency. A cred-\nitor receives a noisy signal about their bank's losses, and decides to withdraw based on\nexpectations over the signals of other creditors.\nA bank's market liquidity risk, by contrast, is driven by the perception of secondary\nmarket investors over the macroeconomy. This, in turn, drives the haircut that investors\nimpose on banks' illiquid assets. When the macroeconomy is in a `bad' state, the haircut is\nlarge, while when the macroeconomy is in a `good' state, the haircut is small. Importantly,\nthese investors cannot observe the state of the macroeconomy or the losses that banks\nsuffer. They can, however, observe whether a bank has failed or not, and impute from\nthis the state of the macroeconomy.\nThus, the coordination failure between a bank's creditors interacts with the views\nof secondary market investors. The interaction gives rise to vicious (as well as virtuous)\ncycles that can drive otherwise solvent banks into illiquidity. Pessimism about the macroe-\nconomy influences the haircut applied to illiquid assets by secondary market investors,\nhampering a troubled bank's recourse to liquidity. This influences the incidence of bank\nruns which, in turn, makes investors more pessimistic and drives down the recourse to\nliquidity of other banks in the system.\nWe demonstrate that for an arbitrary number, N  2, of banks, vicious/virtuous\ncycles between investors and creditors end after, at most, N rounds. This result allows\nus to operationalize our model, since it ensures that the contagion dynamics will always\nconverge and terminate after a finite number of iterations. We can, therefore, readily\nimplement the model within a simulation based stress-test exercise. The result also ensures\nthat we can quantify the extent of information contagion. Banks that turned illiquid\nduring the first iteration suffered from liquidity risk. While, banks that turned illiquid\nduring subsequent iterations did so because of contagion risk.\nOur framework is intended as a demonstration of how information contagion can be-\ngin to be quantified in stress-testing work. As such, we make a number of simplifying\nassumptions. First, we abstract away from network externalities caused by the cascading\ndefaults of a bank's counterparties. Second, we suppose that the loss distributions are\nidentical for all banks and, thus, equal to the loss distribution of an `average' bank. Third,\nall banks are assumed to have the same Tier 1 capital buffers, liquid assets, and common\nreturns. Section 4 considers the implications for quantifying information contagion of\nrelaxing these assumptions.\nThe paper can be viewed as bridging the gap between the literature on top-down stress-\ntesting models and the literature on information contagion. Elsinger, Lehar, and Summer\n(2006) and Alessandri, Gai, Kapadia, Mora, and Puhr (2009) are early contributions to\nthe literature on systemic stress-testing. They describe frameworks used by the Austrian\nCentral Bank and the Bank of England to quantify system-wide bank losses in ways\nthat explicitly characterize bank balance sheets and allow for macro-credit risk, network\ninteractions, and fire sale effects. Aikman, Alessandri, Eklund, Gai, Kapadia, Martin,\nMora, Sterne, and Willison (2009) and Gauthier, Souissi, and Liu (2014) demonstrate\nhow these frameworks might be adapted to quantify funding liquidity risk. But these\nanalyses eschew any consideration of the information contagion channel considered here.\nThe literature on information contagion is sizeable, so we only mention some important\nrecent contributions here. Acharya and Yorulmazer (2008) analyze the ex ante response of\nbanks to adverse news about other banks. In their two-bank model, information contagion\noccurs when bank loan returns have a common systemic risk factor \u00ad the failure of one bank\nconveys adverse information about the common factor. This raises the borrowing costs of\nthe surviving bank and, in order to maximize the joint probability of survival, both banks\nlend and take on correlated investments. Acharya, Gale, and Yorulmazer (2011) present\na model in which the lack of arrival of good news about the value of an asset used as\ncollateral to roll over short-term debt can be associated with a sudden collapse in the debt\ncapacity of firms. And Allen, Babus, and Carletti (2012) use a network setting to tackle\nthe link between commonality in bank asset portfolios and information contagion. With\nlong-term debt, the asset structure of the banking system does not matter for welfare.\nBut when debt is short-term and portfolio quality opaque, adverse signals about bank\nsolvency can trigger foreclosures by creditors. Greater commonality in bank portfolios\nincreases the likelihood of information contagion.\nRecent work by Li and Ma (2013) also considers the same contagion channel that we\ndo \u00ad namely an adverse selection problem which results in mutually reinforcing bank runs\nand fire sales. But while we emphasize the sequential determination of market prices and\nfailure conditions, Li and Ma derive a simultaneous equilibrium for the pooling price of\nassets and the failure conditions. Their focus on regulatory transparency and ex ante\nequilibrium asset prices also contrasts with our emphasis on stress-testing and systemic\nrisk measurement.\nEmpirical studies of bank contagion typically test whether news of a bank failure\nadversely affects other banks using indicators such as stock price reactions and bank risk\npremia (Calomiris and Mason, 2003; Hasan and Dwyer, 1994). More recently, Iyer and\nPeydro (2011) use evidence from the failure of a large Indian bank to show how direct\ncontagion can be amplified by information spillovers as banks with higher exposure to the\nfailed bank suffered larger withdrawals by their depositors.\nThe paper proceeds as follows. We present the model in Section 2 and discuss the\nquantitative application of it in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss the implications of\nrelaxing our simplifying assumptions. A final section concludes.\nThe banking system consists of two banks indexed by b  {1, 2}. We consider a one-year\nstress test horizon punctuated by three dates: the start of the year (t = 0), an interim date\nat six months (t = 1), and the end of the year (t = 2). The interim date comprises two\nrounds. In Round 1, some short-term creditors of a bank have an opportunity to withdraw.\nIn Round 2, outside investors in the secondary market for banks' risky assets revise their\nviews on the macroeconomic fundamentals governing the economy. Additionally, short-\nterm creditors of liquid banks can decide whether to withdraw or rollover their loans.\nIf funding liquidity risk does not materialize, then the illustrative balance sheet for\nbank b at the end of t = 2 resembles Table 1.\nAssets Liabilities\nRisky assets Y b - Sb\n- Sb\nLTb Long-term Debt\nLiquid assets Mb STb Short-term Debt\nEb - Sb\n- Sb\nCapital\nTable 1: Balance sheet of bank b at the end of t = 2\nIn Table 1, the asset-side of the balance sheet comprises safe and liquid assets (Mb > 0)\ncarried over from t = 0, as well as risky but illiquid assets. The net value of these risky\nassets depends on the investment return Y b and on the credit losses Sb\n] and\nSb\n], written down at t = 1 and t = 2 respectively. Sb\nand Sb\nare drawn i.i.d. from\na probability distribution function fb(S), with cumulative distribution function Fb(S).1\n1The assumption that losses at t = 1 and t = 2 are drawn i.i.d from the same distribution simplifies\nexposition of the model. Our results continue to hold if different loss distributions for losses are assumed\nThe liability-side of the balance sheet consists of long-term debt, LTb, that matures\nat t = 2, and short-term debt maturing at t = 1, STb, that can be rolled over. Residual\ncapital after credit loss write-downs is denoted by Eb-Sb\n-Sb\n, where Eb is bank b's starting\ncapital plus income earned over the stress-testing horizon net of dividend payments to\nexternal shareholders. We suppose that each bank has a distinct pool of short-term\ncreditors. These creditors hold a unit of short-term debt at t = 0 that can be rolled over\nduring either Round at t = 1. They are also indifferent between consumption at t = 1\nand t = 2.\nAt the interim date, banks have the opportunity to sell risky assets on the secondary\nmarket to a distinct pool of deep-pocketed outside investors who consume at the final date,\nt = 2. The price per unit of asset sold depends on the `haircut' on the asset value imposed\nby these outsiders. The haircut, in turn, depends on macroeconomic fundamentals which\nwe represent by the binary variable m  {0, 1}. When macroeconomic fundamentals\nare `good', m = 1, and the haircut, hg\n (0, 1), is low. Accordingly, bank b receives\ng\n (0, 1) per unit of asset sales. But if macroeconomic fundamentals are `bad',\nm = 0, the haircut, hb\n (0, 1) is high and bank b receives b\n< g\nfor the asset,\nimplying that hb\n> hg\n.\nWe suppose that although the state of the macroeconomy is drawn at t = 0, it is\nunobservable to all agents. Moreover, as we discuss in Section 2.1, while creditors de-\ncide to rollover after receiving noisy signals about banks' losses, outside investors cannot\nobserve banks' losses, from which they could have otherwise inferred m. Instead, the\noutside investors entertain a common knowledge prior belief, w1\n= Prob m = 1 , that\nfundamentals are good. The expected price that bank b obtains from selling a unit of the\nrisky asset to an outside investor is thus\ng\nb\nBank b is insolvent at t = 2 if Sb\n+ Sb\n> Eb, i.e. its capital is insufficient to cover its\nlosses. If Sb\n> Eb, then it is already insolvent at t = 1. If Sb\n Eb, bank b is solvent at\nt = 1, but may become illiquid if the fraction of short-term creditors who withdraw (in\neither first or second rounds) is too large. In what follows, a bank that is illiquid at t = 1\nis assumed to be insolvent at t = 2.\nThe fraction of short-term creditors who withdraw from bank b during Round 1 of\nt = 1 is denoted b\n [0, 1]. At the end of Round 1, bank b is either liquid or illiquid \u00ad a\nstate that we denote by b\n {0, 1}. Thus bank b is illiquid in Round 1 whenever\nb\n> b Sb\n\nY b - Sb\nThe fraction b Sb\nis the ratio of bank b's recourse to liquidity at t = 1 (the sum\nof liquid assets plus proceeds from illiquid assets to outside investors) to its short-term\nliabilities. If b\n b Sb\n, then bank b is liquid in Round 1 (b\nOutside investors are able to revise their beliefs about the macroeconomy at the start\nof Round 2 of t = 1. Since macroeconomic fundamentals affect banks' credit losses and,\nhence, their recourse to liquidity, outside investors can infer the state of the economy by\nobserving if banks were illiquid or liquid in Round 1. Formally, outside investors determine\nand so the new expected price for banks selling risky assets in\ng\nb\n.\nIf bank b turns illiquid in Round 1, it continues to remain illiquid in Round 2. If,\nhowever, bank b is liquid in Round 1, then it becomes illiquid in Round 2 if the cumulative\noutflow of short-term creditors who withdraw in Round 1, b\n, and Round 2, b\n, exceeds\nits ratio of liquid assets to short-term liabilities, b Sb\n. Bank b remains liquid in\nRound 2 provided b\n+ b\n b Sb\n.\nTable 2 summarizes the timing of events in the model.\n1. State m realized 1. Interim shock 1. Belief updated 1. Final shock\n2.

Dividends paid\nTable 2: Timeline of events\n2.1 Withdrawal of short-term creditors\nThe decision of short-term creditors to withdraw from bank b in Round 1 is assumed to be\nindependent of their decision to withdraw in Round 2. This assumption implies that the\nendogenous fraction of creditors who withdraw in Round 2, b\n, is independent from the\nfraction of creditors who withdraw in Round 1, b\n, which materially simplifies the analysis.\nWe model the creditors' decisions in both Rounds by binary-action simultaneous-move\ncoordination games. Table 3 summarizes the payoffs to an individual creditor during\nRound 1. Conditional on the creditor rolling over the claim in Round 1, their payoffs\nfrom withdrawing or rolling over in Round 2 is also summarized in Table 3.\nSolvent Insolvent\nTable 3: Payoffs to a short-term creditor\nAs Table 3 makes clear, if the creditor withdraws, then the bank returns 1 unit of\nfunds. The creditor receives this payoff (which is immediately consumed) regardless of\nthe outcome for the bank.2 But if the creditor rolls over, the payoff depends on the\noutcome for bank b at t = 2. If bank b is solvent, then the creditor receives 1 + rb. In the\n2This allows us to preserve the global strategic complementarity assumption needed to solve the\ncoordination game.\nevent of insolvency, however, the creditor receives nothing. Insolvency can arise either\nbecause of a liquidity run at t = 1 or because of excessively large credit shocks.\nConditional on receiving the loss Sb\n, bank b becomes insolvent at t = 2 with probability\nNb(Sb\n) = Prob Eb - Sb\n- Sb\n\n\n\n\n\n> Eb\n1 - Fb(Eb - Sb\n) if Sb\n Eb - Sb\n, Eb\n< Eb - Sb\n.\nIf Sb\n> Eb, then the bank is always insolvent at t = 2 for all realizations of Sb\n. In this\nsituation, it is a dominant strategy for all short-term creditors to withdraw in Round 1.\nBy contrast, when Sb\n< Eb - Sb\n, the bank is always solvent at t = 2 and the dominant\nstrategy for creditors is to roll over during both Rounds. In the intermediate range, the\nprobability of insolvency is non-zero and \u00ad with common knowledge over the loss Sb\n\u00ad the\nmodel exhibits the well-known multiplicity of equilibria in pure strategies highlighted by\nDiamond and Dybvig (1983). `Sunspots' determine whether all creditors withdraw their\nclaims in Round 1 during t = 1, or no creditor withdraws in any Round.

We allow for the possibility of imperfect common knowledge by\nsupposing that each short-term creditor, i, of bank b receives a noisy signal xb\nid\n= Sb\n+ id\nin\neach round, d, for realized credit losses. The noise terms for each creditor are independent\nacross banks and rounds, and id\nis uniformly distributed over the interval [- , ].3 All\n3The support for the loss Sb\nmust satisfy, 0 < Eb - Sb\n- , and Sb\n> Eb + .\nshort-term creditors follow a switching strategy, i.e. there exists xb\nd\nsuch that if creditor\ni receives a signal xb\nid\n> xb\nd\n, then the creditor withdraws in Round d. But if xb\nid\n xb\nd\n,\nthen creditor i does not withdraw in round d. Creditor i thus uses the signal xb\nid\nto\ninfer the distribution of the distribution of signals received by other creditors and thus\nthe likelihood that they withdraw. The conditions for the unique equilibrium at which\nliquidity risk materializes are summarized in Proposition 1 below.\nProposition 1. Critical illiquidity threshold. In the limit of vanishing private noise,\n 0, there exists a unique equilibrium in threshold strategies characterized by an illiq-\nuidity threshold, Sb\nd\n, and a signal threshold, xb\nd\n, for each bank b in Round d. Creditor\ni withdraws the claim against bank b in Round d if and only if xb\nid\n> xb\nd\n, and bank b is\nilliquid if and only if Sb\n> Sb\nd\n, where xb\nd\n Sb\nd\n. The illiquidity threshold is implicitly\ndefined by the indifference condition for the expected payoff to a creditor between rolling\nover and withdrawing:\nFb Eb - Sb\nd\nb Sb\nd\n; d\n=\nThe illiquidity threshold is increasing in the bank's equity, Eb, liquid assets, Mb, and\nreturns, rb, but is decreasing in its short-term debt level, STb. Finally, the threshold is\nalso increasing in the investor's belief, wd\n, and the prices, g\nand b\n.\nProof. See Appendix A.\nThe comparative statics for the critical thresholds are intuitive. First, as the bank's\nequity, Eb\n, increases, it has more resources to withstand shocks at the interim and final\ndates. The bank's probability of insolvency at t = 2 is lower and, hence, creditors are\nmore willing to roll over during either Round. Second, as Mb, the level of liquid assets\nincreases, the bank has greater recourse to liquidity and is better able to satisfy creditors\nthat choose to withdraw. Creditors, in turn, are more willing to roll over their claims.\nThird, as the promised return by the bank, rb, increases, creditors benefit from waiting\nuntil t = 2 instead of withdrawing early during either Round at t = 1 and receiving only\none unit of funds. Fourth, as short-term debt levels, STb, rise, the bank has less recourse\nto liquidity to meet withdrawals. This prompts creditors to withdraw earlier. Finally,\nincreases in investor beliefs in Round d, wd\n, and the secondary market prices for risky\nassets all improve the bank's recourse to liquidity and encourage roll overs.\nAlthough the results of Proposition 1 hold for both Rounds at t = 1, it is possible for\noutside investors' beliefs about macroeconomic fundamentals to change between Round 1\nand Round 2. In particular, if outside investors are initially pessimistic about the prospect\nof a good state, i.e. w1\nis low, this may precipitate liquidity risk in one bank during Round\n1. On observing this outcome, investors update their beliefs and become more pessimistic,\n, reducing the second bank's recourse to liquidity in the process.\nTo formalize these ideas, note that Bayes' rule implies that\n=\n|  = g\n|  = g\n|  = b\nSince the circumstance under which bank 1 turns illiquid is independent of those for\nare independent, and Prob 1\n|  = g\n|  =\ng\n|  = g\n. If bank b turns illiquid in Round 1 (b\n= 1), then conditional\non  = g\n, outside investors assess the likelihood of such an event to be\nProb b\n= 1 |  = g\n= Prob Sb\n> Sb\nd\nwhere the critical threshold Sb\ndH\nis given by the solution to\nGb Eb - Sb\ndH\nb Sb\ndH\n; g\n=\nAn analogous definition holds for the critical threshold Sb\ndL\nwhen the macro-economy is\nin a bad state, and the haircuts are large. Propositions 2\u00ad4 present the key results of our\nmodel.\nProposition 2. Virtuous liquidity. If both banks are liquid at the end of Round 1,\n. Consequently, both banks remain liquid at the end of Round 2.\nProof. See Appendix B.\nSuppose that, at the start of Round 1, outside investors hold an optimistic view of\nmacroeconomic fundamentals, i.e. there is a high prior of a good state and w1\nis large.\nThis, in turn, results in both banks remaining liquid at the end of Round 1. At the start\nof Round 2, outside investors update their belief upwards since all banks are more likely\nto remain liquid, i.e. w2\n. The banks' recourse to liquidity improves which increases\nthe critical thresholds. Both banks continue to remain liquid and solvent.\nProposition 3. Vicious illiquidity. Suppose bank 1 is liquid and bank 2 is illiquid at\nthe end of Round 1. The investor become more pessimistic, w2\n, whenever:\n= 0 |  = g\n= 0 |  = b\n<\n= 1 |  = b\n= 1 |  = g\nIf the downward revision of the belief is large enough, then bank 1 will also become illiquid\nat the end of Round 2.\nProof. See Appendix C.\nOutside investors entering Round 1 with pessimistic views regarding the economy\n) can render bank 2 illiquid. When updating beliefs at the start of Round 2,\noutside investors must compute and compare four different conditional probabilities. If\nthe inequality in (7) is satisfied, outside investors conclude that it is less likely for bank\n1 to remain illiquid when assets are good quality than it is for bank 2 to turn illiquid\nwhen assets are bad quality. The failure of bank 2 has a greater weight in the investor's\nBayesian updating \u00ad there is a downward revision of beliefs and a more pessimistic view\nof asset quality.\nTo study the consequences for haircuts, we suppose that (i) banks are identical, except\nin their reliance on short-term funding, i.e, STb > STb; (ii) small shocks are more likely\nthan large ones, so that fb = fb = f satisfies f < 0; (iii) the probability that bank b\nturns illiquid in Round 1 when macro-fundamentals are good is bounded from above, so\nthat 1 - G Sb \n< \u00af\nG, where \u00af\nG is defined in Appendix D. Under these assumptions, we\nobtain the following proposition.\nProposition 4. Price and spread effects. For a given initial belief, w1\n, and \"bad-state\"\nprice, b\n, an increase in the \"good-state\", g\n, increases the price spread,  = g\n- b\n.\nThis, in turn, strengthens the pessimism condition and increases the range of parameters\nwhere the investor's belief is revised downwards.\nOn the other hand, for a given \"good-state\" price, g\n, an increase in the \"bad-state\"\nprice, b\n, leads to a decrease in the price spread. This weakens the pessimism condition\nand reduces the range of parameters where the investor's belief is revised downwards.\nProof. See Appendix D.\nAs the spread between good and bad state secondary market prices increases, the\nprobability that bank 1 remains illiquid when assets are bad quality also increases. At\nthe same time, the probability that bank 2 turns illiquid when asset quality is bad (relative\nto the probability that it turns illiquid when asset quality is good) also increases. When\nthe increase in the relative probability that bank 2 is illiquid is greater than the relative\nprobability of bank 1 being illiquid, the net effect is to increase the range of parameters\nover which the pessimism condition of Proposition 4 holds. The opposite holds when the\nprice spread decreases.\nWith updated beliefs, there are two possible outcomes at the end of Round 2: bank\n1 remains liquid or turns illiquid. If it remains liquid there is no additional information\nfor outside investors and their beliefs remain unchanged. But if bank 1 turns illiquid,\ninvestors turn pessimistic. In both cases, there are no further actions possible in further\nrounds. Generalizing to an arbitrary number, N, of banks, the following proposition\nsummarizes the result.\nProposition 5. Convergence. In a game involving N  2 banks, the cycles of Bayesian\nupdating by investors and withdrawal by creditors terminates after, at most, N rounds.\nProof. See Appendix E.\nProposition 5 has two practical implications for the quantification of contagion risk\nin banking systems. First, it ensures that the contagion dynamics will always converge\nand terminate after a finite number of iterations. We can, therefore, readily implement\nthe model within a simulation based stress-test exercise. Second, the result ensures that\nwe can quantify the extent of information contagion. Banks that turned illiquid during\nthe first iteration suffered from liquidity risk. While, banks that turned illiquid during\nsubsequent iterations did so because of contagion risk. The severity of the information\ncontagion can also be measured in terms of the change in the outside investors' beliefs, i.e.\n- wd\n, where d  N is the iteration where the contagion dynamics terminated.\nA large and positive w indicates a significant downward revision of beliefs by outside\ninvestors, which greatly hampers secondary market liquidity. By contrast, a small and\npositive w implies limited information contagion. and, if w is negative, it implies that\ninvestors are optimistic following the updating of beliefs.\n3 Stress testing and simulations\nWe now integrate the model into the Bank of Canada's Macro-financial Risk Assessment\nFramework (MFRAF) and study how an extreme stress scenario for the Canadian economy\nmight induce information contagion across the banking system. Figure 2 provides a high-\nlevel overview of MFRAF. The stress scenario has a direct impact on corporate and\nhousehold defaults, resulting in credit losses for banks and an adverse impact on their\ncapital buffers. Banks are directly connected to each other via interbank linkages, and\nthe interbank network clears via the Eisenberg and Noe (2001) algorithm \u00ad banks repay\ntheir interbank counterparties a sum that is proportional to the original amounts due,\ncausing counterpart credit losses. Bank balance sheets are thus brought together and\nintegrated with the interbank network to generate illustrative distributions for system-\nwide losses to the banking sector.\nStress Scenario\nModule 1: Core Credit Risk\nCredit losses due to (non-bank)\nborrowers' default\nModule 2: Funding Liquidity Risk\n+ Information Contagion\nLosses due to interactions\nbetween funding strategies and\nsolvency concerns\nModule 3: Network Effects\nLosses due to interbank\ncounterparty defaults\nSystemic Risk\nFigure 2: Schematic description of the modular structure of MFRAF\nFigure 3 illustrates how funding liquidity risk and information contagion are incorpo-\nrated into MFRAF. Following an episode of stress, liquidity risk can materialize endoge-\nnously as creditors decide whether or not to withdraw based on their perceptions of the\nfuture solvency of the bank (which depends on the severity of losses incurred by year-end\nand initial capital) relative to a supervisory threshold. The supervisory threshold is set\nat 7% for the ratio of tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets. If the threshold\nis breached, creditors withdraw en masse, leading to some banks failing from illiquidity.\nSecondary market investors update their beliefs regarding the macro-economy and adjust\nthe price for banks' risky assets accordingly. This, in turn, influences the withdrawal de-\ncisions of creditors for other banks across the banking system. If (pessimistic) perceptions\nare widespread, then contagion takes hold in the manner outlined in Section 2.1.\nIn what follows, we present results which abstract from the interbank network in\norder to isolate the influence of the information contagion channel. Section 4 considers\nthe implications of relaxing this assumption.\nStress Scenario\nCorporate and\nhousehold defaults\nCredit losses for banks\nBanks' capital falls\nBanks' creditors review\nlosses\nRun on banks\nInvestors update beliefs\non the macro-economy\nNo runs\nBanks default\nInterbank network\nSystemic losses\ndistribution\nFigure 3: Flow chart for MFRAF.\n3.1 Stress-test scenario\nThe scenario considered as part of the 2013 FSAP envisages a disorderly default in a\nperipheral euro-area country, which results in a banking crisis and recession in the euro\narea. The global economy weakens and the ensuing financial market turbulence results\nin an adverse shock to the Canadian economy. Specifically, the Canadian economy faces\na large negative foreign demand shock, falling commodity prices, and a loss of business\nand consumer confidence, all of which leads to a sharp contraction in domestic demand.\nTighter lending standards and house price declines ensue, generating a persistent recession\nmore severe than those experienced since the 1980s.\nTable 4 describes the scenario and places it in historical perspective. The decline in\nthe macroeconomic variables is mapped into loan default rates on bank balance sheets,\nwith different rates being derived for different sectors.4 The average default rate across\nWe run MFRAF under a `hybrid' calibration of the 2013 FSAP exercise, taking some\ninputs from the banks own bottom-up stress-tests, and others from regulatory filings.\n4The domestic sectors include: Accommodations, Agriculture, Construction, Manufacturing, Whole-\nsale, Canadian governments, Financial institutions, Small business loans, Residential mortgages (unin-\nsured), Home equity lines of credit (uninsured) and Consumer loans.\nrecession\nrecession\nrecession\nReal GDP\ncontraction (peak to\ntrough, per cent)\nDuration of recession\n(number of\nconsecutive quarters\nof negative growth)\nPeak increase in\nunemployment rate\n(percentage points)\nHouse price\ncorrection (peak to\ntrough, per cent)\nTable 4: Stress-test scenario and historical comparison\nSince much of the data is confidential, we only present aggregate results of the calibration\npublicly reported by the IMF in its 2013 FSAP exercise. Table 5 summarizes the data\nused along with the sources from which the calibration is based. Banks' balance sheet are\ncalibrated using data from 2013Q1. The average common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital\nFor the solvency risk module, banks' exposures at default (EAD), mean probabilities\nof default (PD) and loss given defaults (LGD) for different economic sectors were taken\nfrom the bottom-up stress-test results. The mean PDs, together with the co-variance\nmatrix for defaults across sectors are used to generate a sequence of PDs for each bank,\nacross the different sectors using a Student's t-distribution with 4 degrees of freedom.\nAveraging over the realizations, the aggregate expected loss to the banking sector is $35\nbillion CAD, with a standard deviation of $25 billion CAD.\nBanks' balance sheets are calibrated using data from the first quarter of 2013. The\naverage core equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of banks is 8.9 percent. For the liquidity\nrisk module, data on banks' liquid and illiquid assets were obtain from the Net Cumulative\nCash Flow (NCCF) returns that all Canadian deposit-taking institutions must submit to\nthe Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) on a monthly basis.5\nLiquid assets are those that are unencumbered and eligible for central bank open market\noperations. These include, for example, cash and deposit accounts with the Bank of\nCanada, government securities (e.g., Canadian, U.S, Euro-area), bankers acceptances and\nNational Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities (NHA MBS), which are government\ninsured.\nTo derive secondary market haircuts, we begin with a detailed breakdown of banks'\n5For further information see www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/Eng/Docs/NCCF.pdf.\nModule Variables Source\nSolvency Risk\nEAD, PD, LGD (by\neconomic sectors)\nBottom-up stress test,\nreported by banks\nHistorical covariance\nmatrix of defaults\nBank of Canada internal\nmodel\nOperating income\nBottom-up stress test,\nreported by banks\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquid assets Regulatory data\nIlliquid assets Regulatory data\nSecondary market haircuts\nBank of Canada\ncalibration, based on\nliaison with market\nparticipants\nLiabilities subject to a run\nRegulatory data and Bank\nof Canada calibration\nbased on international\nliquidity standards for the\ninclusion of funding\ninstruments ranked by\ntheir stability\nNetwork Effects Interbank exposures Regulatory data\nTable 5: Data sources and calibration\nassets into securities and loan portfolios. The securities include: sovereigns, mortgage-\nbacked securities, asset-backed securities, corporate commercial paper, corporate bonds,\nequities, precious metals and other commodities. The loans include: residential mortgages\n(insured and uninsured), personal loans, credit cards, and business and government loans.\nFor each of these items, we determine a haircut under normal, or `good' economic con-\nditions and also under stressed, or `bad' conditions. Since transaction-level data was not\navailable to back out the haircut, our estimates were based on conversations with banks\nand other market participants. We subsequently averaged over all loans and securities of\nall banks to obtain hg\n= 0.8. Consequently, the per unit prices that banks\nobtain for there assets are H\n= 0.2, respectively.\nRunnable liabilities for banks are obtained by aggregating different funding instru-\nments and maturity profiles. We obtain data on maturing liabilities OSFI. We take into\naccount international liquidity standards to weight the different funding instruments by\ntheir stability or likelihood to be rolled over. We then use the cumulative stock of debts\ncoming to maturity within the first six-months of the stress-test horizon to represent the\nrunnable liabilities in the interim date. On average, these represent 35% of total liabilities\nacross the six banks. Finally, The interest rate that each banks pays to its creditors was\ncalculated as the banks' weighted average cost of funding.\nFor each bank, we compute the probability that its capital falls below the 7% regula-\ntory threshold. This probability is calculated by averaging over 100x100 realizations of\nthe interim and final date solvency shocks for each bank. We subsequently conduct an\nattribution analysis to determine the contributions of solvency risk, liquidity risk and in-\nformation contagion to this probability. Table 6 summarizes the key findings of the stress\ntest.\nOn average, the probability that a bank's capital ratios breaches the regulatory thresh-\nold of 7% following the shock is 47%. In a crisis, uncertainty about the assets on a bank's\nbalance sheet increases and creditors become highly sensitive to a breach of the minimum\ncapital requirement. A bank that breaches the threshold is deemed to be insolvent for\nthe purposes of the exercise.6\nRisks\nBank Solvency Liquidity Contagion Total\nTable 6: Decomposition of risks\nA bank's balance sheet liquidity (BSL) is the ratio of its recourse to liquidity (the sum\nof liquid assets and sale of illiquid assets at the initial pooling price) and its liabilities\nthat are subject to rollover risk.7 Assuming that secondary market investors hold prior\n= 0.5, the average BSL is \u00af\na BSL ratio greater than one. For moderate shocks, and in the absence of information\ncontagion, these banks are never illiquid. Whereas banks 1, 3, and 6 turn illiquid with\npositive probability, even without information contagion.\n6Clearly, the standard criteria of negative net worth entails lower solvency and liquidity risk.\n7The BSL measure is different from the LCR and should not be viewed as a proxy for the LCR. The\ndenominator for the BSL represents liabilities subject to withdrawal at the interim date in the model and\nis calculated as all liabilities with a maturity date falling within six months of the start of the exercise.\nThe LCR, on the other hand, considers cash outflows over a one-month horizon only. The two measures\nalso differ in their assumptions on the proportion of liabilities that are subject to withdrawal, and on the\nhaircuts to illiquid assets.\nWhen we turn on the information contagion channel, secondary market investors up-\ndate their belief about the macro-economy following the failure of banks 1, 3, and 6, and\nturn pessimistic. This, in turn, reduces bank 4's recourse to liquidity and its BSL ratio\nfalls below one. The probability that bank 4 is illiquid increases by 19.2%.\nThe system-wide loss distribution is determined as follows. Insolvent banks losses are\nequal to their credit shocks plus a bankruptcy cost, equal to 2.25% of risk-weighted assets.\nBanks that fail because of illiquidity suffer an additional bankruptcy cost, equal to the\nspread between the initial secondary market price (where w1\n= 0.5) and the price offered\nby investors after the contagion dynamics play out, multiplied by banks' illiquid assets.\nThus, the losses are proportional to the extent of information contagion.\nLosses/Total Assets (%)\nLiquidity Risk and Contagion Risks (%)\nSolvency Risk\nContagion\nLiquidity\nSolvency\nFigure 4: Aggregate loss distribution\nFigure 4 shows how the three types of risk impact on the aggregate loss distribution\n(expressed as a percentage of total banking system assets). When only the direct impact\nof the stress scenario is considered (the red line called `solvency risk'), maximum system-\nwide losses do not exceed 2% of total assets. Average losses amount to less than 0.5%\nof total assets. Funding liquidity risk fattens the tail, however (the blue line, called\n`liquidity'). The tail of the distribution is fattened even further with the inclusion of\ninformation contagion risk (light blue shaded area) \u00ad now losses approach 3% of system\nassets. Thus, the failure to account for contagion risk can significantly underestimate the\nextent of systemic risk. Banks considered liquid in isolation can very easily be rendered\nilliquid due to a failure to internalize the system-wide effects of fire sales by pessimistic\nagents.\nTable 7 presents a second set of simulations in which the stock of runnable liabilities\nfor banks 2 and 5 are increased such that their BSL ratios are equivalent to bank 4. Banks\n2 and 5 continue to withstand liquidity risk in Round 1. But following revisions to priors,\nthe pooling price falls and their BSL ratios fall below one. This increases the probability\nof both banks succumbing to illiquidity due to contagion effects.\nRisks\nBank Solvency Liquidity Contagion Total\nTable 7: Decomposition of risks with lower BSLs for banks 2 and 5\nWe also investigate how changes in the prior belief, w1\n, and the price spread g\n- l\ninfluence liquidity risk and contagion. The top panel of Figure 5 plots the total probability\nof liquidity risk as a function of initial beliefs. As secondary market investors become\noptimistic that macro-economy is in a good state, the probability of liquidity risk falls.\nThe three different curves in the top panel reflect changes to the haircut, hb\n, in the bad\nstate. For the 10% (20%) curve, the haircut is increased by 10% (20%) relative to the\nbaseline case (the 0% curve). Consequently, the price that investors offer in the bad state,\nb\n, is reduced by 10% (20%) relative to the baseline. A decrease in the low quality price\nincreases the price spread and liquidity risk is heightened as a result. The middle panel\nof Figure 5 depicts the liquidity risk after the first round of contagion dynamics. As the\nprior belief increases, the first-round liquidity risk decreases more rapidly than the total\nrisk. But, as demonstrated in the bottom panel of Figure 5, the decline in first-round\nliquidity risk is supplanted by an increase in contagion risk. When the price spread is\nlarge, the first-round liquidity risk is higher for larger values of the belief. As the belief\ncontinues to increase, the liquidity risk is replaced by contagion risk and total liquidity\nrisk is unchanged. Figure 5 thus corroborates the theoretical result in Proposition 4.\n4 Relaxing the simplifying assumptions\nThe stress-test results in the previous section were for a banking system wherein all banks\nhave the same assets and credit losses, but differ in terms of their liability structures.\nMoreover, we ignored knock-on credit contagion between banks via the interbank market.\nIn what follows, we relax these assumptions and investigate their implications for the\nstress-testing results.\n4.1 Interbank credit contagion\nWe introduce the interbank contagion effects module described in Figures 2 and 3. As\nGauthier et al. (2014) describe, this module is based on the Eisenberg and Noe (2001)\nLiquidity + Contagion Risks\nLiquidity Risk\nInitial belief in round 1 (w\nContagion Risk\nFigure 5: Decomposition of liquidity risk and contagion\nclearing algorithm. Following realizations of t = 1 solvency shocks, runs by short term\ncreditors and information contagion, and solvency shocks at t = 2, a subset of banks\nturn insolvent. Some of these banks may also have obligations to other solvent and\ninsolvent banks, which cannot be serviced in full. The partial default of insolvent banks\non their claims to solvent banks may, in turn, force the solvent banks into insolvency,\nas they cannot service their own interbank obligations in full. The Eisenberg and Noe\n(2001) algorithm formalizes this dynamic and calculates an endogenous `clearing-vector'\nof payments that banks make to each other, and, thus, estimates the interbank losses.\nIn addition, we assume that banks that turn insolvent due to network effects suffer a\nbankruptcy cost equal to 2.25% of risk-weighted assets.\nFor our stress-test simulations we use a snap-shot of the Canadian domestic interbank\nnetwork from 2013Q1. The data is drawn from the `Interbank and Major Exposure Re-\nturn'. This return collects information on exposures between the six Canadian Domestic\nSystemically Important Banks (D-SIBS), as well as their total exposures to other financial\ninstitutions, both domestic and foreign (for a certain number of geographical areas), and\ntheir major exposures to key domestic and foreign counterparties. The return is filed on a\nmonthly basis and contains granular information on interbank exposures across different\ninstruments, including: secured lending (repos), money market placements (including de-\nposits and bankers acceptances), unsecured lending (including contingent lines of credit),\nmarketable debt and equity securities, and Over\u00adthe\u00adCounter derivatives exposures. For\nthe stress-test, we aggregated exposures across all instruments. The average exposure is\nFigure 6 illustrates the aggregate loss distribution with network effects. We clearly see\na fattening of the tail of the loss distribution. To further investigate the effects, Figure\nLosses/Total Assets (%)\nLiquidity and Contagion Risk, and Network Effects (%)\nSolvency Risk\nNetwork\nContagion\nLiquidity\nSolvency\nFigure 6: Aggregate loss distribution with network effects\n7 plots the cumulative loss distributions with and without network effects. As expected,\nthe loss distribution with network effects dominates the loss distributions without net-\nwork effects in a first-order stochastic dominance sense. Moreover, the area between the\ncumulative loss distribution with network effects and the cumulative distribution without\nnetwork effects measures the contribution of interbank network contagion to the aggregate\nloss distribution.\nLosses/Total Assets (%)\nCumulative Probability (%)\nNetwork\nContagion\nLiquidity\nFigure 7: Cumulative loss distributions\n4.2 Heterogenous balance-sheets\nWe finally consider the case where the different banks have different asset portfolios and\nloss distributions. To this end, we more fully utilize the granular balance sheet data and\nbottom-up stress-test results provided by the banks. Figure 8 reports the aggregate cumu-\nlative loss distribution. We note the following. The cumulative probability of obtaining\na loss-to-total-assets ratio of 0.5% with network effects is, roughly, 65%. Compared with\nFigure 7, where we assumed a homogenous asset portfolio for banks, the cumulative prob-\nability was only 50%. The influences of information contagion and liquidity risk remain\nlargely unchanged. The analysis, thus, suggests that, while network effects are less pro-\nnounced with heterogenous balance sheets, the results for liquidity risk and information\ncontagion remain robust.\nLosses/Total Assets (%)\nCumulative Probability (%)\nNetwork\nContagion\nLiquidity\nFigure 8: Cumulative loss distributions with heterogenous balance sheets\n5 Conclusion\nOur paper has proposed a tractable method for capturing information contagion in a top-\ndown stress-testing framework. The key transmission mechanism is a two-way interaction\nbetween the adverse selection of secondary market investors and the coordination failure\nbetween the creditors of financial institutions. Bank runs emerge endogenously and the\ninitial beliefs of investors crucially determines the trajectory of systemic stability. We\nshow, in particular, that pessimism amongst investors can reduce banks' recourse to liq-\nuidity, with the inability to fire sell assets readily making them more susceptible to runs.\nThis, in turn, generates a wave of investor pessimism.\nWe illustrate how such dynamics play out in a realistic stress-testing exercise, using the\nIMF's 2013 FSAP scenario calibrated to Canadian banking data. Information contagion\nis shown to be potentially significant in this context, notwithstanding the simplifying\nassumptions used.\nSystemic financial crises are invariably associated with large-scale information con-\ntagion. A proper understanding and quantification of the channels through which such\ncontagion spreads is crucial for effective systemic-risk management. Our model represents\na small first step towards an operational framework for dealing with this most challenging\nissue.\nA Proof of Proposition 1\nWe establish the existence of a unique Bayesian equilibrium for each bank, b, in threshold\nstrategies. Morris and Shin (2003) show that only threshold strategies survive the iterated\ndeletion of strictly dominated strategies.\nEach creditor, i of bank b uses a threshold strategy, xb\nid\nis round d, whereby debt\nis rolled over if and only if the private signal suggests that the credit shock is small,\nxb\nid\n< xb\nd\n. Hence, for a given realization of the shock Sb\n, the proportion of creditors who\ndo not roll over debt is\nb\nd\nSb\n, xb\nd\n= Prob xb\nid\n> xb\nd\n|Sb\n= Prob id\n> xb\nd\n- Sb\nxb\nd\n- Sb\n-\nThe critical mass condition states that bank b is illiquid when the credit shock reaches\na threshold Sb\nd\n, such that\nb\nd\n(Sb\nd\n, xb\nd\n) =\nMb + d\nY b - Sb\nd\nA creditor who receives the signal xb\nd\nis indifferent between rolling over its debt and\nnot. Thus, the indifferent condition is\nGb Eb - Sb\nd\nb Sb\nd\n; d\n=\nEquation (9) defines the critical signal, while Equation (10) defines the critical thresh-\nold for bank b. In the limit  0, it is easy to verify that xb\nd\n Sb\nd\n.\nB Proof of Proposition 2\nThe belief at the end of round 1 is\n= Prob i\n= 0 |  = g\nProb j\n= 0 |  = g\nProb i\n= 0 |  = g\nProb j\n= 0 |  = g\n+ Prob i\n= 0 |  = b\nProb j\n= 0 |  = b\nTo show that w2\n, we must have that\nProb i\n= 0 |  = g\nProb j\n= 0 |  = g\n Prob i\n= 0 |  = g\nProb j\n= 0 |  = g\n+ Prob i\n= 0 |  = b\nProb j\n= 0 |  = b\nwhich, on rearranging, yields\nProb i\n= 0 |  = g\nProb j\n= 0 |  = g\n> Prob i\n= 0 |  = b\nProb j\n= 0 |  = b\nwhich is always true.\nC Proof of Proposition 3\nThe belief at the end of round 1 is\n= Prob i\n= 0 |  = g\nProb j\n= 1 |  = g\nProb i\n= 0 |  = g\nProb j\n= 1 |  = g\n+ Prob i\n= 0 |  = b\nProb j\n= 1 |  = b\nConsequently, for w2\n, we must have that\nProb i\n= 0 |  = g\nProb j\n= 1 |  = g\n< Prob i\n= 0 |  = b\nProb j\n= 1 |  = b\nwhich is identical to the condition in Equation (7).\nD Proof of Proposition 4\nLet us define\n=\nG Sb\nG Sb\nwhich is the left-hand side of the pessimism condition, and\n=\nwhich is the right-hand side.

In the first case, investors\nupdate their beliefs and become pessimistic, but there are no further actions to take. In\nthe third case, Proposition 2 implies that investors become optimistic when they update\ntheir beliefs, and no banks suffer from illiquidity. Finally, if only one bank defaults, then\ninvestors may become more pessimistic when they update their beliefs. In the worst case,\nthis will lead to the second bank turning illiquid in Round 2, after which there are no\nfurther actions, and the game terminates.\nInduction Hypothesis: In the case of N > 2 banks, the game terminates after, at\nmost, N Rounds.\nInductive Step: In the case of N + 1 banks, suppose that at the end of N Rounds,\nthere are N + 1 - k banks liquid and k banks illiquid, where k  N + 1. If k = N + 1,\nthen all banks are illiquid, and the game ends. If k = N, then for the lone liquid bank, in\nround N + 1, investors update their beliefs and post a new pooling price. The creditors\nof the bank subsequently decide whether or not to withdraw. If they do not withdraw,\nthen the bank remains liquid, and there is no further information to be gained for the\ninvestors, and the game terminates. If, however, they all withdraw, then the bank turns\nilliquid. While investors update their beliefs, there are no further actions to take and,\nhence, the game also terminates. For k < N, it follows that in round N + 1 - k there\nwere no new banks turning illiquid, and, hence, beliefs did not update, implying that the\ngame terminated.\nReferences\nAcharya, V., D.
