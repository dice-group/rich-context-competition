NHANES III was based on a complex,\nstratified, multistage, probability-cluster design from which a\nrepresentative sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized\nUnited States population was drawn. In NHANES III, children\n5 years of age, persons 60 years of age, Mexican Americans,\nand non-Hispanic blacks were sampled at a higher rate than\nother persons. Participants or their parents or guardians were\ninterviewed. Participants provided blood samples, which were\ntested without personal identifiers. Serum rubella IgG antibody\ntiters were measured on surplus serum samples available for\npersons 6 years old.\nInterview questions addressed the study participant's demo-\ngraphic characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, sex, year\nand place of birth, place of residence, income, birthplace of\nparticipant's head of household, household crowding, the abil-\nity to identify a regular clinic or physician, United States mil-\nitary service, marital and employment history, and parity and\ngravidity for women. A history of rubella vaccination or disease\nwas not obtained. For this analysis, race/ethnicity was defined\nby self-report as \"non-Hispanic white,\" \"non-Hispanic black,\"\nand \"Mexican American.\" Persons who did not select one of\nthese 3 groups were classified as \"other\" and analyzed only with\nthe total population. Detailed descriptions of the sampling and\nsurvey design have been previously published [11].\nWe received state-specific data on rubella vaccination re-\nCDC. For persons aged 6\u00ad19 years, a variable was created des-\nignating whether rubella vaccination was required for school\nentry, under the assumption that the person entered school at\n5 years of age in the same state in which he or she was born.\nLaboratory methods. Serum samples were tested for rubella\nIgG antibody by indirect EIA (California State Department of\nHealth Services, Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory, Berke-\nley, CA) [12]. The absorbance of the rubella viral antigen (VA)\nwell minus the absorbance of the uninfected cell as nonspecific\n(NS) control antigen well was used to calculate a VANSp\nrubella virus (RV) value. To determine the international unit\n(IU) value, a regression analysis was done and a standard curve\nwas calculated using the RV values for the 10 IU, 40 IU, and\n100 IU rubella standards and their squares. Positive rubella con-\ntrol standards consisted of World Health Organization or CDC\n100 IU. Rubella seropositivity for NHANES III was defined as a\nserum rubella IgG titer of 10 IU by EIA.\nStatistical analysis. All estimates were weighted to rep-\nresent the total United States population and to account for\noversampling and nonresponse to the household interview and\nphysical examination [13, 14]. Prevalence estimates and SEs\nwere calculated with Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) for mul-\ntistage sample designs [15]. Exact 95% CIs were calculated for\nthe prevalence estimates by the method of Collett [16]. Uni-\nvariate and multivariate analyses were stratified by age (subjects\npredictor variables were applicable only to the adult population\n(e.g., marital status, occupation, education, military history,and\npregnancy and childbirth history for women). We limited our\nadult analysis to those aged 20\u00ad49 years, because for persons\naged 50 years, rubella seropositivity was stable at 190%. To\nscreen for possible predictors of rubella seropositivity, differ-\nences in seroprevalence were evaluated without correction for\nmultiple comparisons by means of a univariate t statistic from\na general linear contrast procedure in SUDAAN. Variablesdem-\nonstrating a univariate association with rubella seropositivity\nat were included in the multivariate analysis. Indepen-\ndent predictors were further determined by use of multivariate\nlogistic regression. Variables with a Satterthwaite-adjusted F\nstatistic with were considered significant [15]. Potential\nconfounding effects of a variable on the remaining cofactors\nwere evaluated on deletion from the model. No additional con-\nfounders were found.\nwere selected for the survey, 76% ( ) were inter-\nviewed and examined and 69% ( ) had serum sam-\nples available to measure rubella antibody.

It is possible that waning vaccine-associated im-\nmunity was responsible for the decreased rubella seropositivity\nrates seen in this group of adolescents and young adults [17,\n18]. However, the current RA 27/3 vaccine has been reported\nto provide persistent, long-term immunity [19]. It is more likely\nthat the sharp drop in rubella incidence in the 1970s followed\nby the slow rise in rubella vaccination coverage from 1969\nthrough 1998 (figure 1) resulted in a \"lost generation\" of young\npeople who missed acquiring rubella antibodies because they\nwere born too late to be exposed to circulating wild-type rubella\nduring childhood but born too early to receive mandatory ru-\nbella vaccination at school entry. Consequently, the childbear-\ning-age population in the United States contains a birth cohort\nUnited States birth cohort in the 20th century (figure 2).\nOur data indicate that although tremendous progress has\nbeen made in increasing rubella seropositivity in young chil-\ndren, particularly among non-Hispanic blacks and persons liv-\ning in poverty, rubella susceptibility among adolescents and\nyoung adults remains a surprisingly large problem, especially\nfor Mexican Americans born in the United States, women who\nwere never married who have not delivered a child, and persons\nwho are unable to identify a routine clinic or health care pro-\nvider. Although the overall United States rubella herd immunity\nrubella epidemics, it has been unable to prevent occasional\nrubella outbreaks [20\u00ad22] or births of CRS-affected infants [5,\n9]. Consequently, achieving elimination of rubella and CRS will\nrequire maintaining high rubella vaccination coverage of chil-\ndren and increasing rubella vaccination coverage of adults of\nchildbearing-age. In addition, enforcement of state laws re-\nquiring a second dose of measles, mumps, rubella vaccine for\nschoolchildren, instituted in 1989 to protect those with primary\nmeasles vaccine failure, may also improve rubella seropositivity\nin adolescents.\nTable 5.

Data are OR (95% CI).\na OR for age from models stratified by sex and adjusted for race/ethnicity, marital status, child care\noccupation, military service, and ability to identify clinic and provider.\nRubella seropositivity in the United States varies by age, race/\nethnicity, and birthplace. Mexican Americans born outside the\nUnited States have significantly higher rubella seropositivity\nthan do those born in the United States, probably because those\nborn outside the United States were infected with rubella in\ntheir native country. In addition, Mexican Americans aged 6\u00ad19\nyears have significantly higher rubella seropositivity when their\nheads of households were born outside the United States, com-\nhold who was born outside the United States is a surrogate\nmarker for increased exposure to rubella, possibly via visitors\nwho import rubella into the United States or through increased\ntravel outside the United States. Similarly, the significantly\nhigher rubella seropositivity in non-Hispanic blacks aged 6\u00ad19\nyears and 20\u00ad49 years may indicate increased exposure to wild-\ntype disease in this population as well [23].\nAdults aged 20\u00ad49 years with a history of medical or military\noccupations had significantly higher rubella seropositivity than\ndid those who did not, indicating the benefit of employer-\nprovided and/or employer-mandated rubella immunization.\nPersons aged 20\u00ad49 years who had ever worked in child care\nhad lower rubella seropositivity, a troubling association because\nchildren with rubella or CRS can easily transmit the virus to\npregnant caretakers who are susceptible to rubella. However,\nonly a relatively small number of child care workers were iden-\ntified in this subgroup; therefore, the sample size may not be\nadequate to describe this population.\nOne limitation of this study is the lack of sufficient data to\nestimate seroprevalence for other minority groups beyond non-\nHispanic blacks and Mexican Americans. Also, the study did\nnot include participants from United States territories, posses-\nsions, or commonwealths, although residents of these areas are\nUnited States citizens and eligible to move anywhere within the\nUnited States. Because no information on rubella vaccination\nwas collected, the effect of rubella vaccination on rubella se-\nropositivity could not be determined. Specific information on\naccess to immunization services was not collected; only sur-\nrogate variables on whether the person could name a clinic\nand/or health care provider were available.\nthe United States rubella vaccination strategy was immunizing\nthose currently at risk of having a pregnancy complicated by\nrubella (e.g., women of childbearing age). This remains true\ntoday. Premarital rubella immunization of women may have\nraised rubella seropositivity in women of childbearing age be-\ncause the rubella seropositivity in married women aged 20\u00ad49\nyears did not vary significantly by pregnancy or childbirth his-\ntory. However, premarital immunization policies have probably\nbecome less effective in vaccinating women before childbearing\nbecause an increasing number of births in the United States\nthe United States, 22% of non-Hispanic white infants, 69% of\nnon-Hispanic black infants, and 39% of Mexican American\ninfants were born to unmarried women [25].\nFor women aged 20\u00ad49 years who were never married, ru-\nbella seropositivity did not rise significantly after 1 pregnancy\nbut rose only after a live birth. Although this suggests that\nmany reproductive health care providers follow guidelines for\npostpartum rubella immunization [26, 27], the delay in im-\nmunizing some women of childbearing age means that current\nvaccination practices will not always protect firstborn or even\nsecondborn children from CRS, especially when the mother is\nunmarried. This is supported by CRS surveillance data acquired\nof infants with indigenously acquired CRS had at least 1 pre-\nvious live birth [28]. Therefore, rubella immunizationprograms\nshould seek out and immunize rubella-susceptible adolescents\nand adult women before their first pregnancy, regardless of\nmarital status or stated intention to delay childbearing.\nSeveral barriers still remain to improving rubella vaccination\ncoverage in persons of childbearing age. A major barrier in the\nUnited States is limited access to preventive health care by\nrubella-susceptible populations [29, 30]. Because rubella vac-\ncination is not mandated and provided for adults as it is for\nchildren (at school entry), targeted and more complicated strat-\negies are needed to ensure that adults of childbearing age are\nrubella-immune. Also, some health insurance policies may not\npay for adult vaccinations [31]. A fourth barrier to adult im-\nmunization is concern about possible adverse events. Although\none center reported a possible association between chronic ar-\nthropathy and rubella vaccination in women [32, 33], recent\nstudies by others have not replicated these findings [34\u00ad37].\nA fifth barrier is the ignorance of many adults, including\nsome physicians, of the importance of adult immunizations\n[38, 39]. Indeed, physicians may lack adequate training in vac-\ncine-preventable diseases [39]. Therefore, formal immunization\ntraining regarding the importance of immunizing both pedi-\natric and adult patients should be incorporated into all primary\ncare residency training and continuing medical education pro-\nClinicians should use every opportunity to vaccinate ado-\nlescents and young adults who lack documentation of rubella\nimmunity [27]. Eliminating rubella and CRS in the United\nStates will not occur until national rubella vaccinationprograms\nare expanded to include rubella vaccination coverage for\nwomen of childbearing age [21], especially unmarried women\nventable diseases, such as measles and polio, close collaboration\nwith other countries to intensify rubella immunization efforts\nwill be necessary to entirely eliminate rubella [5, 40].\n"
