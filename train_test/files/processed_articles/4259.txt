    "abstract": "Abstract\nLittle research exists on the nature of the interactions between gifted students and technology, specifically the phenomenon\nof gifted adolescents using Internet-based learning tools. This qualitative study explores how students use the Renzulli\nLearning System (RLS), an online educational profile with a matching database that provides enrichment resources. The\nstudent sample included nine identified gifted and talented seventh- and eighth-grade students in an urban school district\nin Connecticut. Most of the students had been using RLS for about 2 years. The students participated in an electronic\nquestionnaire and were interviewed during two semistructured interviews. The research questions were centered on how\nthe students were using RLS at school. Student answers suggested several themes regarding the effectiveness of RLS as a tool\nfor school success, its engaging quality, and selective independence.\n",

Students using RLS have\nopportunities to explore, discover, learn, and create using\ncurrent technology resources independently and in a pre-\nscreened web environment.

Chancey2\nand Micah N. Bruce-Davis2\n Keywords\nRenzulli, gifted, adolescent, online\n2 SAGE Open\nspecifies a wide range of domains in which students could\ndemonstrate high levels of talent or show the potential for\nsuch talent (U.S. Department of Education, 1993). While\nearlier definitions of giftedness were based almost exclu-\nsively on a general intelligence factor, often defined by IQ\nthat definition to other abilities and measures (e.g., Borland,\nFor the purpose of this study, another expanded opera-\ntional definition of giftedness is used. Renzulli (1978)\ndefined gifted behaviors as the result of above-average abil-\nity, high levels of task commitment, and high levels of cre-\nativity combined and applied to any potentially valuable area\nof human performance. Under this definition, gifted learners\nare those who have the potential to demonstrate gifted behav-\niors in one or more areas, and the goal of gifted education\nprograms is to develop such behaviors. This is also the defi-\nnition of giftedness underpinning the RLS.\nMeeting the Academic Needs of Gifted Learners\nExceptionally capable students exhibit characteristics that\nchallenge the efficacy of the traditional American educa-\ntional system (Karnes & Bean, 2001; Plucker & Callahan,\nThose that demonstrate advanced ability in one or more aca-\ndemic areas may be poorly served by age-based placement\nTomlinson, 1999), and asynchronous development of abili-\nties may pose difficulties for strictly acceleration-based ser-\nmay also differ from their peers in their preferred thinking\nstyles (Sternberg & Grigorenko, 1993) and in their ability to\nmake intuitive conceptual connections (Sak, 2004). The\nCouncil for Exceptional Children (2002) stated that, to serve\ngifted students appropriately, teachers should match their\ninstructional strategies to the specific learning needs of the\nstudents and that the students should receive an appropri-\nately differentiated curriculum or have access to the full\nrange of curriculum (through distance education, accelera-\ntion, or other specially designed programs).\nThere is disagreement within the field of gifted education\nas to what would constitute the best curriculum and instruc-\ntion for gifted students (e.g., Borland, 2003; Renzulli et al.,\ncurricular models that showed some evidence of being effec-\ntive with gifted learners. These models generally involved\ninquiry-based learning within academic disciplines or fields.\nThe Schoolwide Enrichment Model (SEM; Renzulli & Reis,\nedness and in turn is the foundation for the design of RLS,\nwas one of the models with the longest history of use and\nresearch. In the SEM, a talent pool of students with the\npotential for gifted behaviors is identified through a variety\nof measures (Renzulli, Reis, & Smith, 1981). Identified stu-\ndents are then eligible for a continuum of services, including\ndifferentiation based on assessed interests and learning\nstyles. Curriculum compacting also is used to eliminate\ninstruction in material already mastered and allows for sub-\nstitute alternative learning activities (Reis, Burns, & Renzulli,\nidentified students to complete Type III projects: investiga-\ntive activities and artistic productions in which the learner\nassumes the role of a firsthand inquirer: thinking, feeling,\nand acting like a practicing professional, with involvement\npursued at a level as advanced or professional as possible\n(Renzulli, 1977). Research on the SEM has demonstrated\nimproved teacher attitudes toward student work as well as\nlong-term effects of Type III projects on students'later career\nBarriers to Differentiation in the Regular\nClassroom\nAlthough there is a general consensus in the gifted education\nliterature that some form of differentiation is necessary to\nmeet gifted students'learning needs (Council for Exceptional\nVanTassel-Baska & Stambaugh, 2005), and teachers may\nagree that addressing academic differences is important for\nsuccess (Hootstein, 1998), differentiation has not been\nimplemented consistently. Researchers at the National\nResearch Center on the Gifted and Talented studied the\nextent to which gifted students received differentiated\ninstruction in regular classrooms in the United States\n(Archambault et al., 1993) and found that third- and fourth-\ngrade teachers made only minor modifications in the regular\ncurriculum to meet the needs of the gifted students, regard-\nless of whether they taught in public or private schools or the\nlocation and ethnic diversity of the school. Moon et al. (1995)\nfound that 50% of the teachers they surveyed did not differ-\nentiate instruction. VanTassel-Baska and Stambaugh (2005)\nnoted that the pattern of research findings stayed consistent\nfor over a decade. As a result, gifted students are often not\nchallenged in the classroom (Tomlinson, 1997), and they\noften spend much of the day tutoring others in cooperative\nlearning groups or reviewing curriculum that they mastered\nyears ago on their own (Robinson, 1990; U.S. Department of\nSeveral reasons for the lack of differentiation for gifted\nstudents have been identified. Structural reasons include too\nlittle planning time, lack of administrative support, large\nclass sizes, and pressure to focus on low-achieving students\n(National Association for Gifted Children, n.d.; Tomlinson,\nmay be unclear about their professed beliefs regarding indi-\nvidual differences, perceive no need to differentiate for\nSwicord et al. 3\nadvanced learners, or even hold negative attitudes toward\nrelated to teacher knowledge and skills. Teachers may receive\nvery little training in the needs of gifted students, be unable\nto manage effectively a differentiated classroom, have insuf-\nficient subject matter knowledge for in-depth explorations,\nor be uncomfortable modifying a predesigned curriculum\nthese obstacles may be addressed through professional\ndevelopment (Hultgren & Seeley, 1982; Reis & Westberg,\ning additional tools available to teachers.\nMeeting Gifted Learners' Needs Through\nTechnology\nIndividualized learning via the Internet holds promise as stu-\ndents pursue study based on interests and skills rather than\n2007). Students already use the Internet and other technol-\ntypically spent approximately 8.5 hr each day using media;\n2 hr of that time was spent using multiple media and more\nthan 1 hr was spent using a computer (Roberts, Foehr, &\nthat 87% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 used the Internet, and\nhalf of those used it daily (Lenhart, Hitlin, & Madden, 2005).\nStudents who use the Internet at home are frustrated because\nthey cannot use technology how, when, and where they want\nin their classes (Project Tomorrow, 2006), and they believe\nthat technology can enrich their learning experience (Lenhart\nSchools' technology infrastructure is also growing. By June\nrooms had access to online Internet technology (CEO Forum\non Education & Technology, 2000). According to Azzam\n(2006), more than half of teachers use technology in their\nclassroom instruction.\nResearch has linked technology and educational attain-\nment in U.S. classrooms. For example, Bain and Ross (2000)\nfound that careful alignment between content-area learning\nstandards and carefully selected technology can significantly\nincrease student achievement scores. When evaluating the\nresults of a school system's technology grant, R. Cradler and\nCradler (1999) reported that teachers observed significant\nchanges in their students' skills and knowledge acquisition\nupon completion of their first multimedia project. In a fol-\nlow-up study, \"teachers reported increased student knowl-\nedge in: research skills; ability to apply learning toward\nreal- world situations; organizational skills; and interest in\nengagement in technology results in positive gains, measur-\nable and assumed. However, little research has explicitly\nfocused on gifted students' learning through technology.\nAnderson (2004) identified four capacities of online media\nthat are important to gifted students in that they allow gifted\nstudents to have autonomy in their learning: flexibility of\ntime and place of learning, vast quantities of content, varied\nformats of content, and rich contexts of synchronous and\nasynchronous communication. This study explores gifted\nstudents' use of a particular online system (RLS) that pos-\nsesses these capacities and addresses some of the barriers to\ndifferentiation listed in the previous section.\nMethod\nIn this study, qualitative procedures were used to investigate\nthe phenomenon of engagement in gifted adolescents. The\nfocus of this basic, interpretative qualitative study was devel-\noping an understanding of students' interpretations of work-\ning with RLS and the meaning that \"attributed to their\ntion gathered from the students enabled a first step to under-\nstanding how students engage and react to participation in an\nonline learning system.\nThe central question of this study was related to gifted\nadolescent students and their engagement with an online\nenrichment program called the RLS. The following research\nquestions guided this study:\nResearch Question 1: How are the selected adolescents\nusing RLS?\nResearch Question 2: What are the perceived effects of\nusing RLS on school behaviors?\nNine middle school students in Grades 7 and 8 were\nselected to participate in this study. These students attended\na public school in an urban district in Connecticut, had been\nidentified for the school district's gifted program, and were\ncurrently using RLS. The students' gifted teacher selected\nthe students based on a set of researcher-created criteria,\nincluding usage of RLS, participation in the gifted program,\nand exhibiting a range of school behaviors indicative of\nengagement in the regular core curriculum.\nThe selected public school system has about 23,000 stu-\ndents, one of the largest school systems in Connecticut. The\nfree or reduced lunch, as compared with the state average of\n26.9%. The district is diverse in race and ethnicity with a\nthe state average on Connecticut's Mastery Test. The K-8\nschool visited in this study is in the largest city in the state\nroom in a trailer behind the school, along with two other\nclassrooms.\n4 SAGE Open\nThe students were identified for the gifted program on the\nbasis of teacher recommendation, academic and effort\ngrades, Connecticut Mastery Test scores, and online quar-\nterly assessments. Students met as a team with the gifted pro-\ngram teacher 1 day per week and attended regular classes the\nremaining 4 days per week. Transportation to one of the two\nschools with gifted programs was provided for all of the dis-\ntrict's identified students. A child was required to meet aca-\ndemic and behavioral standards to remain in the gifted\nprogram.\nStudents involved in the study ranged in age from 12 to\n14 (four eighth graders and five seventh graders). Of the\nnine students, three were male and six were female. Among\nthe eighth graders, the genders were evenly split. There\nwere four females and one male in the seventh-grade group.\n(see Table 1.)\nRLS\nThe RLS was designed to assist teachers with differentiating\nor individualizing assignments for students based on inter-\nests, learning styles, and expression styles. The program\nfocuses on understanding what each student's interests,\nlearning styles, and expression styles are and then providing\na list of thousands of activities and assignments that the stu-\ndent can engage in that reflect the student's individual needs\nand preferences. The program is student centered and focuses\non the development of a product. When students first log in\nto RLS, they are given a questionnaire that identifies the stu-\ndents' top 3 interests, top 3 learning styles, and top 3 expres-\nsion styles. Based on that information, a profile is developed\nscreened resources) is populated to match each student's pro-\nfile. Teachers can then guide students through self-directed\nlearning projects or assignments utilizing sources from the\nstudent's personalized list of educational resources.\nData Collection\nData was collected through an online questionnaire and in-\ndepth interviews with selected students, using a semistructured\nprotocol. Each participant completed an electronic ques-\ntionnaire (Appendix A) before being interviewed. The\nresponses to the questionnaire helped the first author assess\nthe appropriateness of the interview questions, and pro-\nvided primary data directly from the hands of the partici-\npants. An interview then was conducted in school during 1\nweek, and subsequent interviews were conducted within 2\nweeks following the first interviews. Student quotes used\nin this discussion derive from the interviews.\nThe first interview (Appendix B) established a base for\nunderstanding and established trust. The second interview\nenabled elaboration of comments and questions addressed in\nthe first interview and sought the participants' checks on the\nfirst interview through specific questions (i.e., What did you\nmean when you said . . .?\"). The interviews, lasting from\n30 min to 45 min were taped and transcribed as soon as pos-\nsible following the interview. The first author took notes on\nthe students' responses in addition to relying on the tapes.\nThe interviews took place in an empty classroom in the\nschool. The first author continuously rephrased the students'\nresponses and asked if she was conveying the meaning that\nthey intended. All students agreed that the rephrasing was\naccurate, indicating that the researcher had accurately inter-\npreted their answers.\nData Analysis\nWhen reviewing the data gathered in answer to the research\nquestions, the first author noted recurring themes that\nemerged. The initial open codes were developed based on\nparticipant responses to the questionnaires, and to notes\nfrom the interviews (Creswell, 2007). Once the interviews\nwere transcribed, the first author indicated which text seg-\nments represented the open codes. After an analysis of all\nthe transcribed interviews the first author developed ana-\nlytic codes (Creswell, 2007) pertaining to the research\nquestions and occurring across most of the participants.\nThe following three codes were developed into three of the\nmajor themes:\n1. RLS is a desirable tool for getting good grades;\n2. RLS is for school use only, not for beyond school\nassignments;\n3. RLS is enjoyable.\nFor example, Mark's statement, \"I really don't use other pro-\ngrams because rls gives me all the information that I need\"\nwas coded as \"RLS is a desirable tool for getting good\ngrades.\"\nValidity\nResearcher effects were checked by having two others\n(a psychologist who has worked in the field of gifted educa-\ntion and a master teacher of urban gifted children working\nTable 1. Participants' Demographics.\nAlias Ethnicity Gender Grade Age\nSwicord et al. 5\nin a context similar to the sample) review the study and\nfindings. Both readers concurred that the findings were\nconsistent with their experiences working with similar stu-\ndents in similar situations.\nFinally, the first author's orientation to RLS was impor-\ntant in contributing to the study's trustworthiness. The\nresearcher believes that RLS is an effective way to enhance\nand enrich learning for gifted students. With that understand-\ning, the researcher reflected on the transcripts and observa-\ntions to put aside as much bias as possible in understanding\nand describing the phenomenon.\nResults\nThree major themes emerged from the data gathered through\nthe research questions. One additional finding emerged from\nthe content of student comments.\nTheme 1: RLS is a Useful\nTool for Attaining Good Grades\nThe first, most dominant theme emerged from students' per-\nceptions of need and desire to attain high grades, and the use\nof RLS as a vehicle to achieve very good grades. These stu-\ndents very much wanted to have tools at their disposal that\nmade it easy and likely that they would be successful in\nschool. Cindy thought it made her more organized, which\nhelped her get better grades. \"I can separate my topics within\nmy project. Instead of one pile of information I can be orga-\nnized and get better information.\" Mark also liked that \"it has\nresearch that you want and not what you don't need.\" He\nadded that RLS was \"easier to use than wide-based databases\nbecause they have a whole bunch of things but Renzulli cat-\negorizes what you need.\"\nIn addition to the assistance that RLS provided for them in\ntheir projects, students noted that they gained general knowl-\nedge as well, which helped them be more successful in\nschool. Cheryl believed she had gained keyboarding skills\nfrom reading all the projects and that she was \"way more\nknowledgeable than before RLS. I've gained so much knowl-\nedge even with the assignments that are given.\" Jamil thought\nthat using RLS had improved his work ethic and helped him\nfocus academically. \"I work harder on schoolwork now and I\nhave better products.\" He ended one interview by stating,\n\"Renzulli is great!\"\nTheme 2: RLS is Just for School\nThe second notable theme that emerged focused on how stu-\ndents viewed RLS as a school program, not for personal use\nat home. It did not appear to have much relevance or exten-\nsion into their lives beyond school other than homework. As\nAlicia put it, \"everything in Renzulli is about school. All the\ntopics you should learn in school are in there.\" Dari agreed.\n\"School is about learning new things and that's what Renzulli\ndoes. We learn about other cultures and traditions and that's\nwhat school does too so it's like a bonus for me.\" Hayley\nconfirmed the school connection but admitted the potential\nfor other benefits with this comment: \"it's still doing work\nbut it's more helpful to the student.\"\nTheme 3: Enjoyment and Fun\nThe third theme that became clear was that the students\nregarded RLS as adding an element of fun to schoolwork.\nThey all enjoyed doing hands-on activities within the\nsites. Each was able to recall a few activities and a few\nprojects. Cindy remembered doing projects on Amistad\nand WWII, and she was able to recall deducing from her\nShakespeare project on whether Shakespeare was actually\nthe author of his plays. Rahul, whose favorite class is\ngeography, did a project on Argentina. Dari recalled creat-\ning her own tie-dye T-shirt while doing a study of the\n1960s and also learning about a country in South America.\nCindy thought online learning \"is funner [sic] to learn\nbecause you know what you are looking for, you're inter-\nested and it's usually good information that will help you\nin the future.\"\nTheme Four: The Independence Paradox\nAnother finding that was notable, partly so because it\nappeared contradictory, was that though these students pre-\nferred to try to achieve independently they also made com-\nments about the need to be networked, to have friends in the\nright places, and to work together beyond the school experi-\nence. They essentially wanted to have a support group they\ncould depend on, but only when they needed it.\nNaomi embraced the independence she gained through\nI used to be completely dependent on the teacher and if the\nteacher didn't say it, I'm not going to do it. Your wish is my\ncommand. Renzulli gives me more independence because\nyou use your imagination and knowledge to do what you're\ndoing.\nBut later, she alluded to the potential need for a helping\nhand. \"I think having a lot of friends is really helpful. They\nall have their own different ways of helping you out.\"\nDiscussion\nRLS appeared to be regarded as a tool for achieving an end,\nthe end being to get good grades. The students saw RLS as an\neasy and efficient way to help them get good grades, which\nwas for them evidence of success in school and in life. They\nliked using RLS because it did help them complete school\nprojects with a high level of quality. As with the teacher\n6 SAGE Open\ncomments in the J. Cradler et al. (2002) study on the use of\nmultimedia projects, students in this study reported increased\nability in research and organizational skills.\nStudents in this study indicated that they were able to\nwork on individualized interest projects, a positive change\nfrom findings pointing to a lack of differentiation in most\nVanTassel-Baska & Stambaugh, 2005). Students fondly\nrecalled a diverse number of research topics pursued\nthrough the use of RLS including projects focused on the\ngeography of Argentina, events in the 1960s, and ques-\ntions of authorship for the works credited to Shakespeare.\nThe personalized list of electronic resources provided by\nRLS enabled students to pursue in-depth projects on top-\nics of interest in an organized and efficient manner with-\nout the teacher needing to have in-depth knowledge of\neach of the topics or go searching for quality resources for\neach topic.\nRLS provides two of the four aspects of online learning\nthat Anderson (2004) identified as important for gifted stu-\ndents: a large quantity of resources and varied formats of\nresources. Students not only appreciated the wide variety\nof resources, but also appreciated that the resources were of\nhigh quality, enabling them to complete projects in a more\nefficient manner. Students often reflected that the resources\nwere just what they needed and that the format of RLS\nenabled them to organize their findings. However, Anderson\nalso stated that gifted students appreciate flexibility with\ntime and place to complete assignments; but students in this\nstudy tended to only work on RLS projects while at the gifted\nprogram site, and not at home.\nThese gifted students' involvement with RLS can also be\ndescribed in terms of what was not the case. They did not\nseem to see it influencing aspects of their lives beyond\nschool, did not use it very often for fun outside of school\nprojects or simply to learn about topics unrelated to school\nassignments.\nThe results of this study are limited to the sample used\nfor the study. The themes of this study are based on the\nresponses of nine adolescent students in an urban, midsized\nNew England city in 2009. In addition, these results are\nbased on the perceptions of students identified for and par-\nticipating in a program for gifted and talented seventh- and\neighth-grade students. Furthermore, data was gathered over\na short period of time at the end of a school year by one\nresearcher. Finally, interpretations are limited to the kinds\nof data available to the researcher, which were students'\nwritten and oral responses to written and oral questions,\ninformal observations at the school, and informal discus-\nsions with the gifted program teacher and district director\nof evaluation. However, most of the information and result-\ning interpretations of data were fairly straightforward and\nconsistent with the literature. All these considerations\nshould be taken into account when attributing any stated\nresults to other groups or ages.\nConclusion\nTeachers and administrators need to know how and why stu-\ndents work within a program such as RLS if such programs\nor their characteristics are to be replicated, refined, and\nimproved.\nThis study demonstrated how gifted adolescents per-\nceived one online learning system to be helpful in achieving\ngood grades and enjoying the learning process at school. The\nthemes and implications that emanated from this study sug-\ngest some recommendations that educators and school\nadministrators should consider in enhancing their own ven-\nues for gifted students, whether at the individual, class,\nschool, or district levels. For an online learning system to be\nused extensively by gifted students, students need to be\nencouraged by gifted program teachers and regular class-\nroom teachers to use the program. In addition, some gifted\nstudents need to be encouraged to view the learning process\nas a lifelong endeavor.\nIn this technological age, there are many ways that schools\ncan employ tools and strategies to deal with the individual\nneeds that students bring to school. This study examined one\ntool, the RLS, which students found to be beneficial. Teachers\ncan benefit from any tool that assists them in meeting the\nbroad range of abilities, interests, and performance levels in\ntoday's classrooms. School administrators have an opportu-\nnity to provide teachers with ongoing professional training,\nto establish peer support in using new tools, and to encourage\nteachers to be creative in their incorporation of new strate-\ngies and tools with an emphasis on meeting the needs of\ngifted and talented students. Online learning, such as RLS, is\nstill a rich area for future research. For example, how can\nteachers use RLS to individualize the core curriculum for\ngifted students in all their classes? Why do adolescent stu-\ndents see a tool like RLS as strictly a \"school only\" tool,\nespecially when it is accessible from home and elsewhere? It\nis likely that the reader may discern additional potential areas\nfor future study as well.\nFinally, there is great promise in the students themselves.\nThese students clearly appreciated a good tool that helps\nthem and is enjoyable. They also wanted to succeed and had\nvery positive images of themselves and their future suc-\ncesses. Educators and others should be inspired by the\nstrengths and ambitions of these young people as they enter\ninto their young adult lives, striving to be the best they can\nbe, using the resources available to them. Hopefully, the suc-\ncesses described here within the context of the phenomenon\nof the RLS are an inspiration to all educators as they continue\nto find and create resources that will stimulate, organize, and\nchallenge young gifted minds.\nSwicord et al. 7\nAppendix A\nOnline Questionnaire\nName------------------ Age------ Grade----------\nThank you for taking a few minutes to help me under-\nstand how you use the Renzulli Learning System (RLS).\nPlease give me as much detail as you can, even if you are not\nsure what you're writing is directly related to the question.
