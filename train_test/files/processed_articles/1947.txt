The existence of psychological\nbenefits is less clear, however, due to methodological\nlimitations common to investigatory studies. Two of\nthese limitations are the difficulty of establishing\nappropriate control groups and the large variety of\nhighly specific measures of psychological function\navailable for consideration of effects. To address\nthese limitations, we identified 63 pairs of mono-\nzygotic twins from the National Survey of Midlife\nDevelopment in the United States who were discor-\ndant for the amount of vigorous exercise in which they\nengaged regularly. The twins who regularly engaged in\nvigorous exercise experienced greater positive psycho-\nlogical functioning than their nonexercising co-twins as\nmeasured by the latent factor representing the vari-\nance common to 8 measures of mood, optimism,\ncontrol over life, and interpersonal aspects of personal-\nity. The magnitude of the difference was in excess of\n.4 standard deviations.\nThe physiological benefits of exercise for purposes of\nboth prevention and rehabilitation of chronic disease\nare well established (Fletcher et al., 1992; Haskell,\n1984). At the popular level, exercise is strongly asso-\nciated with positive psychological functioning as well.\nIn spite of this, most people (perhaps 70%) in devel-\noped, western populations do not engage in regular\nvigorous exercise (Brawley & Rodgers, 1994;\nHamdorf et al., 2002), and attrition rates in exercise\nprograms are high (Raglin, 2001). For example, the\nauthors of one study of an effective behavioral inter-\nvention in exercise program adherence were pleased\nto report reduction of 6-month drop-out rates from\nthat adherence may be driven by psychological bene-\nfits that are not experienced to the same degree by all\nparticipants. For example, there is evidence that\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genotype may\nbe associated with endurance performance and adher-\nence to exercise programs even in the absence of\ndifferences in baseline levels and changes in physio-\nlogical measures in response to exercise (Thompson\net al., 2006). Understanding why and the extent to\nwhich there may be individual differences of this kind\nthat contribute to exercise adherence is important in\naging populations, given the substantial evidence for\nthe importance of regular exercise in maintaining\nphysical health. Moreover, there is growing evidence\nthat links among cognitive decline, depression symp-\ntomatology, and deteriorating physical health in the\nelderly may be reversed or slowed by physical exercise\nIndeed, it is challenging to summarize research\nfindings in this area succinctly. There are many\nreasons for this, but they can be grouped along two\nlines. First, psychological benefits can be measured in\nvarious ways, and results tend to differ depending on\nthe specific measure of positive psychological func-\ntioning used, the nature of the exercise engaged in,\nand the degree to which this level of exercise is habit-\nual to the study participants. For example, findings of\nincreases in positive mood are clearest when regular\nexercisers undertake vigorous exercise at a level with\nwhich they are familiar (Salmon, 2001). In contrast,\nstrenuous exercise in sedentary people has generally\nbeen associated with increased negative mood or\ndecreased positive mood (Petruzello et al., 1997).\nPerhaps because of this, findings of increases in\npositive mood tend to be clearer and stronger than\nfindings of decreases in negative mood (McIntyre et\nsamples may not yield the same results as community-\nbased samples. For example, assessment of effects of\nexercise on psychopathological symptomatology in\ncommunity samples is subject to floor effects when\nthe sample has too little symptomatology to show\nimprovement with exercise (Salmon, 2001). And\nstudies of stress resistance show varying results\ndepending on the nature and timing of the induced\nThe Psychological Benefits of Vigorous\nExercise: A Study of Discordant\nMZ Twin Pairs\nWendy Johnson and Robert F.

For example, there is evidence\nthat, during exercise, cardiovascular responses to\nmental stress increase (Rouselle et al., 1995), though\nemotional responses to mental stress decrease (Girodo\nThe variation in results and its diverse sources\nsuggest that an approach to the measurement of posi-\ntive psychological functioning that can summarize\npositive psychological functioning may help to clarify\nthe nature and extent of its association with exercise.\nWe employed such a measure in this study, making use\nof a latent variable tapping the variance common to\neight measures of positive psychological functioning.\nLatent variables have substantial advantages in mea-\nsurement of psychological constructs. They represent\nthe systematic confluence of measured variables; as\nsuch, they represent unidimensional constructs in their\npurest form (Bollen, 1989). The observed variables\nserving as indicators of a latent variable all contain\nrandom and/or systematic measurement error, but the\nlatent variable is free of this.\nThe second group of reasons for complexity in\nresults of studies investigating the psychological effects\nof exercise involves the possibility of self-selection.\nBroadly stated, the effect of exercise on psychological\nfunctioning may not be causal. Rather, to the extent\nthat exercise appears to confer psychological benefits,\nit is possible that some unmeasured constitutional or\nenvironmental variable distinguishes the people who\nexercise from those who do not in that the exercisers\nrespond to the world in general -- and to exercise in\nparticular -- more positively than the nonexercisers.\nMore specifically, it is possible that people who\nchoose to exercise vigorously and regularly tend to\nenjoy it, and everything else, more than those who do\nnot choose to exercise. Perhaps they also experience\nmore positive and less negative mood, less depression\nand anxiety, greater control over their lives, higher\nself-concept, and/or greater resistance to stress than\nthose who resist exercising (Salmon, 2001).\nIt is of course not possible to measure exhaustively\nevery variable that could exert such a causative influ-\nence. Studies of monozygotic (MZ) twins reared\ntogether in childhood but discordant for level of exer-\ncise in adulthood, however, can usefully minimize,\nthough not completely eliminate, such possible effects.\nThis is because such MZ twins are matched on genetic\nand childhood environmental background, and thus\nthe nonexercising twins serve as controls for these\nkinds of variables in relation to their exercising co-\ntwins. There is evidence that this is relevant: there\nappear to be both general familial and genetic influ-\nences on both the tendency to exercise (e.g., Perusse et\nresponse to exercise (Kartodihardjo & Klissouras,\n1976). MZ twins are also the same gender, which\nmeans that whatever effects of sex may be present are\nalso controlled. The use of this design makes it more\nlikely that any differences between exercising and\nnonexercising MZ co-twins in psychological measures\ncan be attributed to the amount of exercise they get.\nWe made use of such a sample of discordant MZ twin\npairs in this study. Thus, the purpose of this study was\nto investigate the existence and magnitude of psycho-\nlogical benefits of habitual vigorous exercise,\ncompensating for the limitations of previous studies\nby using a latent summary variable of positive psycho-\nlogical functioning in a sample of MZ twin pairs\ndiscordant for level of exercise.\nParticipants and Measures\nThe MZ twin pairs discordant for level of exercise in\nthis study came from the MacArthur Foundation\nSurvey of Midlife Development in the United States\n(MIDUS). The base sample consists of 998 twin pairs\ndistributed roughly according to population through-\nout the continental United States and ranging in age\nmissing or indeterminate zygosity information. The\nsample is 58% female; about 92% listed their race as\nCaucasian. Additional description of the sample and\nits recruitment is given in Johnson and Krueger (2004)\nThe MIDUS participants completed a series of self-\nreport questionnaires including questions on health,\nlifestyle, and psychological functioning. Level of exer-\ncise was assessed in two questions (one for each\nseason), `During the summer/winter, how often do you\nengage in vigorous physical activity (e.g., running or\nlifting heavy objects) long enough to work up a\nsweat?'. Response choices were `several times a week\nor more', `about once a week', `several times a\nmonth', `about once a month', `less than once a\nmonth', and `never'. The responses to each question\nwere coded so that they represented estimated\nnumbers of exercise sessions per month: `several times\na week or more' was coded as 13.5, `about once a\nweek' was coded as 4.5, `several times a month' was\ncoded as 3, and so forth. The estimates for the two\nquestions were averaged. The resulting variable had a\nstandard deviation of 5.1. Overall, the sample\nmembers may have exercised slightly more than\naverage, as only 55% said they exercised once a week\nor less. Still, only 26% said they exercised three times\na week or more and 25% said they exercised about\nonce a month or less. Because the variable was signifi-\nbecause MZ twins share a common age and gender\nwhich can inflate their apparent similarity, we\nregressed the effects of age and gender from the exer-\ncise variable using the data from the full sample.\nThere were no significant main effects of gender.\nWendy Johnson and Robert F.

As the figure makes clear, the distribution\nwas bi- or perhaps tri-modal. Most participants fell in\nthe lower or upper ranges of the distribution. We\nmade use of this in order to select MZ pairs function-\nally discordant for level of exercise by requiring that\none member of each pair score below \u00ad.42 (in the\nbottom 47% of the distribution), while the other\nscored above .87 (in the top 28.5% of the distribu-\ntion). This meant, roughly, that those we classed as\nnonexercisers exercised at most three times per month,\nwhile those we classed as exercisers exercised at least\nfemale) MZ twin pairs who met this discordance crite-\nTo measure psychological function, we made use\nof eight variables, adjusted to remove the effects of\nage and gender. We purposely selected trait measures\nof positive personality functioning that have shown\nsubstantial genetic influence (Bouchard & Loehlin,\n2001), as well as measures of positive attitude and\nmood that are more state-like in nature, because we\nwere interested in constructing a latent variable that\ncould transcend the questions raised by the existing\nliterature regarding timing and continuity of effects. In\naddition, we wanted to include variables that show\nsubstantial genetic influence. Variables with substan-\ntial genetic influences should show substantial\nsimilarity in MZ twins, thus creating a base of similar-\nity between MZ co-twins that should sharpen the\neffects of nonshared environmental influences relevant\nto the pairs' discordance for exercise, thus making\nstronger our test for such effects.\nParticipants quantified their experience of good\nmood by rating how much of the time in the past\nmonth they felt six forms of positive emotion (e.g.,\n`cheerful' and `full of life') on a 5-point scale ranging\nfrom `all the time' to `none of the time'. Full-sample\nalpha for this scale was .91. Participants also indicated\nthe extent to which the adjective `optimistic' described\nthem on a scale of 1 to 4 and rated their expected sat-\nisfaction with their lives 10 years in the future on a\nscale of 1 to 10. We combined standardized scores on\nthese two items to form a scale we called Optimism\n(alpha = .41). The MIDUS questionnaires also\nincluded questions about the degree to which partici-\npants perceived they had control over various aspects\nof their lives, assessed on a scale from 1 to 10. The\nquestions read, `How would you rate the amount of\ncontrol you have over your __ these days?' and life\naspects queried were health, work situation, financial\nsituation, contribution to the welfare and well-being\nof other people, overall relationship with children,\nmarriage or close relationship, sexual aspect, and life\noverall. Full-sample alpha for the scale formed from\nthe mean response to these ratings was .73.\nParticipants who did not have spouses, close relation-\nships, or children and thus did not respond to these\nitems received scores based on the mean of the items\nto which they did respond.\nThe remaining five variables we used assessed per-\nsonality based on the Big Five Model (Extraversion,\nTwin Research and Human Genetics April 2007\nPsychological Benefits of Exercise\nFrequency of vigorous exercise\nFrequency\nDistribution of frequency of vigorous exercise in full sample.

Each scale consisted\nof 4 to 7 adjectives chosen from existing trait lists and\nTrapnell & Wiggins, 1990). Alphas for the scales in\nthe pilot study used to develop them were .74, .78,\nAgreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness, and\nAgency respectively). For this study, because we were\nfocusing on positive psychological functioning, we\ndid not include the Neuroticism variable. There were\nno mean or variance differences between MZ twin\npairs discordant for exercise and the rest of the\nMIDUS twin sample on any of the eight measures of\npsychological function.\nAnalysis and Results\nTable 1 shows the means and standard deviations for\nthe eight measures of psychological functioning in\nexercisers and nonexercisers. As expected, with only\none exception, exercisers showed more positive\npsychological functioning. Consistent with many\nresults of studies of psychological benefits of exer-\ncise, however, the benefits did not appear to be\nconsistent or clear-cut. Paired-sample t tests showed\nat least marginally significant differences in five vari-\nables, but only two were significant (p < .05) after\nBonferroni correction for multiple testing. Stated so\nthat positive statistics favor exercisers, effect sizes of\ndifferences ranged from \u00ad.05 (ns) for Optimism to\nshared substantial common variance however, as sug-\ngested by the correlations among them shown in\nTable 2. In the full sample, factor analysis indicated\nthat the first factor, with an eigenvalue of 3.33,\nexplained 42% of the variance. The lowest loading\non this factor was .44 from Conscientiousness.

In doing so, we thought of our vari-\nables as reflecting different aspects of positive\npsychological functioning. In this conceptualization, it\nis the variance common to them all that captures the\nconstruct we believe to be important in the association\nbetween exercise and positive psychological function-\ning. That is, it is not, for example, extraversion per se\nthat is associated with exercise. Rather, it is the sur-\ngency of positive mood and active engagement in life\nthat often drive the overt sociability that our extraver-\nsion measure taps that is associated with exercise, and\nanalogous statements can be made for all the eight\nvariables that make up our latent variable.\nA factor model of this kind allows for the calcula-\ntion of model parameters in each group. We set one\nfactor loading in the first group to 1.00 and the factor\nvariances equal to identify the model. To establish that\nmeasurement of the involved constructs is consistent\nfrom group to group and thus that any observed dif-\nference in the latent factor means actually indicates a\ngroup difference, it is necessary that it be possible to\nconstrain factor loadings, intercepts, and residual vari-\nances equal across groups without significant loss of\nmodel fit (Meredith, 1993). It was possible to do so in\nparameter estimates are shown in Table 3. The table\nshows that each measure of psychological functioning\nhad substantial loadings on the general factor. The\nlatent factor mean for the exercising group was set at\n0 in establishing the model; that for the nonexercising\ngroup was freely estimated at \u00ad.31. This difference\nwas significant (p = .03, two-tailed). The factor vari-\nance for each group was .51, indicating that the latent\nvariable had about half as much variance as the eight\nstandardized variables underlying it. This factor\nvariance meant that the mean difference had an effect\nWe carried out several tests of the consistency of\nthe latent factor mean difference in psychological\nfunctioning we observed between exercisers and\nnonexercisers. First, we wanted to establish that the\ndifference we observed in the sample of discordant\ntwins was not the result of some odd combination of\ncircumstances in an unusual group of twins. The\nremainder of our sample consisted of both MZ and\nDZ twins who were not discordant for level of exer-\ncise. A median split on the exercise variable in this\ngroup (without regard to pair status) produced a\nlatent factor mean difference with an effect size of .37\n(p = .01, two-tailed), indicating a very similar effect in\nexercisers and nonexercisers without co-twin control.\nSecond, we wanted some evidence that it was the dis-\ncordance for level of exercise rather than some\ndifference related to the assignment of twin numbers\nor simply the separation of pairs that drove the latent\nmean difference in psychological functioning. The\nlatent mean difference in MZ twins concordant for\nlevel of exercise had an effect size of \u00ad.09, which was\nnot significant (p = .49, two-tailed). Third, we wanted\nto demonstrate that the effect held in the full sample\nof MZ twins, whether or not they met our definition\nof discordance for level of exercise. In the full sample\nof MZ twins, the correlation between the pair differ-\nence in level of exercise and the pair difference in\npsychological function latent variable factor scores\nwas .21 (p < .001), indicating that the effect did hold\nthroughout the sample of MZ twins.\nFinally, though our data were contemporaneous,\nmaking inference of causal attribution impossible, we\ntabulated some data related to the direction of effect.\nMore substantive differences in psychological func-\ntioning between twins discordant for exercise than\ndifferences in exercising between twins discordant for\npositive psychological functioning would suggest that\nexercise drives the improvement in psychological func-\ntioning rather than vice versa. To evaluate this, we\nused the mean differences in positive psychological\nfunctioning between exercisers and nonexercisers as\nboundaries to identify MZ twins discordant for posi-\ntive psychological functioning. This yielded 58 pairs in\nwhich one member of the pair scored above the mean\non positive psychological functioning for exercising\ntwins in the group discordant for exercising, and the\nother member of the paired scored below the mean for\nnonexercising twins. This formed a group of twins dis-\ncordant for level of psychological functioning; they\nhad a mean difference with an effect size of .47. The\nlower functioning group reported exercising on\naverage five times per month and the higher function-\ning group reported exercising on average seven times\nper month. Given the categories into which our data\nhad been separated, this meant that distinction\nbetween the groups was only possible because we had\nParameter Estimates from Factor Model with Two Groups --\nExercisers and Nonexercisers\nStandardized\nFactor Residual\nVariable loading variance\nFactor variance: .51\nFactor mean, MZ exercisers .00\nFactor mean, MZ nonexercisers \u00ad.31\nSignificance of difference .03\nStandardized effect size .43\nNote: MZ = monozygotic.

Thus,\nan MZ twin difference in psychological functioning\ncomparable to that for exercise yielded little difference\nin level of exercise, hinting that the preponderant\ndirection of effect is from exercise to positive psycho-\nlogical functioning. Corroborating this, only nine\npairs, or about 15%, were members of both the group\ndiscordant for exercise and the group discordant for\nlevel of psychological functioning.\nThe association between exercise and positive psy-\nchological functioning could also result from selection\neffects: there may be genetic influences common to\nboth positive psychological functioning and involve-\nment in exercise. To test this, we made use of the\nco-twin control method. In this analysis, the discor-\ndant twins served as quasi-experimental controls for\neach other in comparing mean levels of positive psy-\nchological functioning by level of exercise. Greater\nassociation between level of exercise and positive\npsychological functioning in DZs than in MZs, as\nmeasured by a significant interaction term involving\nzygosity and level of exercise, would provide evidence\nfor genetic influences common to both positive psy-\nchological functioning and involvement in exercise.\nThe interaction term, however, was not significant\nDiscussion\nThis study made use of a sample of MZ twin pairs dis-\ncordant for level of vigorous exercise to investigate the\npsychological benefits associated with regular exercise.\nBecause prior investigations of such benefits have pro-\nduced results that have varied from study to study\nwith the specific measures of psychological function-\ning used, we made use of a latent variable reflecting\nthe variance common to eight measures of psychologi-\ncal functioning. As has been the case in prior studies,\nexercise was not associated with better functioning on\nall of our individual measures. The latent variable,\nhowever, did show a significant mean difference\nbetween the two groups, with an effect size in excess\nof .4. This finding is important in developing an\nunderstanding of the ways that regular exercise con-\ntributes to maintenance of physical health. This may\nbe especially true in aging populations, as exercise\nmay reduce the rate of physical deterioration with age,\nand thus vulnerability to both mental and physical\nage-related diseases.\nEvidence for the specific mechanisms linking brain\nand body is just now emerging. For example, it is\nbecoming clear that the presence of depressive symp-\ntoms (or the absence of the kind of positive\npsychological functioning we measured in this study)\ncontributes to the development of excessive inflamma-\ntion or immune response, which in turn can contribute\nto the development of cardiac and autoimmune dis-\neases (Miller & Blackwell, 2007). Moreover,\ndepressive symptoms precede the development of\nAlzheimer's disease, although it is not known whether\nsuch symptoms are an early manifestation of the\ndisease, or play some causal role in the development\nof the disease. The relations between brain and body\nmay be particularly important in aging groups, as all\nof the body's systems become less resilient with age.\nTo the extent that exercise helps to maintain physical\nand/or psychological resilience, it may be particularly\nhelpful in maintaining overall quality of life at older\nages. These are questions for future research.\nAddressing these questions using longitudinal studies\nthat allow the observation of how the importance of\nexercise in maintaining physical and psychological\nhealth and the links between them change with age\nwill clearly be important.\nAlthough our study did have an important finding\nthat generates important questions for future research,\nit is also subject to some limitations. First, although\nnational in scope, our sample is somewhat wealthier,\nbetter educated, Caucasian, and female than the\nUnited States as a whole. This makes generalization of\nour results to the full population of the United States\ndifficult and makes inferences about the applicability\nof the psychological benefits of exercise that we\nobserved to populations in other parts of the world\ntenuous. Second, the measures we used were all\nderived from self-report in a survey questionnaire\nformat, a rather weak way of measuring exercise in\nparticular. We have no way of knowing, for example,\nthe actual intensity of exercise engaged in by partici-\npants who reported that they exercised vigorously, or\nwhether these participants experienced measurable\nimprovements in physical fitness. In addition, it is pos-\nsible that, because they believed that exercise should\nmake them feel better, our exercising participants\nreported that it did. Because we thought this might\naffect perceptions of life satisfaction most directly, we\navoided such measures in our construct of positive\npsychological functioning.\nThird, our data are contemporaneous rather than\npredictive, making it impossible to draw inferences\nabout the causal nature of the associations we have\nobserved. That is, it remains possible that those with\nhigher positive psychological functioning were more\nlikely to engage in vigorous exercise, while those with\nlower positive psychological functioning shied away\nfrom exercise. This would be an example of the well-\nknown epidemiological `healthy worker effect' (Li &\nSung, 1999). We were, however, able to provide some\ninformation suggesting that the preponderant direc-\ntion of effect flows from exercise to positive\npsychological functioning, and there was no explicit\nevidence for genetic influences common to positive\npsychological function and exercise. It would be valu-\nable in future work to assess the degree to which\npsychological functioning changes in MZ twins who\nare initially concordant for little exercise when only\none is randomly assigned to begin an exercise\nprogram, as well as to determine if there are psycho-\nlogical markers that predict which of such a pair of\nWendy Johnson and Robert F. Krueger\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

These questions, however, can only be\naddressed using longitudinal data. Finally, the size of\nour sample of MZ twins discordant for level of exer-\ncise was rather small at 63 pairs, limiting our power\nto detect effects.\nIn spite of these limitations, our study has some\nimportant strengths. The control for genetic and child-\nhood environmental background provided by our\nsample of MZ twins is very general -- it encompasses\nall physical and behavioral variables influenced by\nthose backgrounds, whether we can specify them or\nnot. In addition, our use of a latent factor model made\nit possible to assess positive psychological functioning\nat a very general level without measurement error.\nThe variance common to our measures of psycho-\nlogical functioning reflects a positive, expansive sense\nof capacity to cope with life. Our evidence that exer-\ncise contributes to this sense is consistent with\nSalmon's (2001) theory of exercise training as stress\nadaptation. Drawing on Lees and Dygdon's (1988)\nargument that exercise can initially be unpleasant but\ncan over time become pleasant due to counter-\nconditioning, or the suppression of an unwanted\nresponse to a stimulus by the conditioning of a com-\npeting (e.g., endorphin) response, Salmon (2001)\nnoted that the effects of counter-conditioning rou-\ntinely extend beyond the originally aversive stimulus\nin nonhuman animal experiments so that counter-con-\nditioning becomes a more general form of `toughening\nup' (Gray, 1982). For example, after developing toler-\nance to exposure to cold water through\ncounter-conditioning, animals also display tolerance to\nuncontrollable electric shock, and vice versa (Weiss et\nIn nonhuman animals, this kind of toughening up\nreflects not just reduced sensitivity or greater resilience\nto stress, but also reduced anxiety and depression as\nevidenced by the similarity of effects to those of anxi-\nolytic and antidepressant drugs (Gray, 1982).\nInvestigations of the specific neurochemical pathways\ninvolving serotonin, norepinephrine, and the endoge-\nnous opioid systems are in process (Salmon, 2001).\nWe thus speculate that experience of the toughening-\nup process involved in engagement in vigorous\nexercise may generalize to other areas of life, provid-\ning the psychological resources needed to exert more\neffective control of emotional, relational, and intellec-\ntual as well as physical areas of life. In addition, we\nspeculate that the toughening-up process involved in\nengagement in vigorous exercise may be one way to\ndevelop the psychological characteristic fundamentally\nunderlying resilience (Ciccehetti & Garmezy, 1993;\nThis theory about the psychological benefits of\nexercise and evidence supporting it may contribute to\nour understanding of the way in which exercise bene-\nfits physical health as well. McEwen (1993; McEwen\n& Wingfield, 2003) has suggested that organisms cope\nwith stress through the adaptive process of allostasis,\nor the active maintenance of physiological stability\nthrough the production of hormones, neurotransmit-\nters, and cytokines that regulate metabolic,\ncardiovascular, and immune responses. Regulation of\nthis process of allostasis takes place in the brain\n(McEwen, 2004). When allostasis is activated too\noften or inefficiently managed, individuals are more\nvulnerable to stress-related physical diseases. The\ncounter-conditioning involved in generating reduced\nsensitivity or greater resilience to stress as a result of\nvigorous exercise may be the very mechanism that\nenables the individual to maintain better allostatic\nbalance and resist physical illness, thus linking brain,\nbody, and behavior.\nThe particular form of our study highlights an\nimportant aspect of these psychological and physical\ncounter-conditioning processes, to the extent they\nexist. Because we made use of MZ twins, we know\nthat the differences in psychological functioning we\nobserved cannot be attributed to genomic differences.\nAt the same time, the specific mechanisms hypothe-\nsized to be involved in the counter-conditioning\nprocesses are highly biological and thus must also\ninvolve genetic action. It is very likely that the appar-\nent contradiction between an absence of genomic\ndifferences and differences in manifestation of pheno-\ntypes that depend on genetic action will be resolved\nthrough understanding how genetic expression varies\nacross different social and personal contexts of physi-\ncal exercise. Our results thus serve as an inspiration\nfor future sociogenomic research.\n"
