Even when sitting down\nfor a drink on a market square, the aim is usually to enjoy ourselves and watch other people rather than\nto observe the aspect ratio of the market square. Nevertheless, the perceived aspect ratios of public\nspaces seem important design considerations to use in architecture with likely implications for the\nperceived \"atmosphere,\" \"spaciousness,\" or \"openness\" of them. You would expect that one would\nwant to know what the perceived characteristics are before undertaking such large building projects\nthat may determine the appearance of a city for centuries. Even though we rarely notice that our visual\nperception is not in agreement with physical reality, a large body of research has shown convincingly\nPerception of length to width relations of city squares\nthat visual space is considerably distorted, particularly in the depth direction. See for example Gillam\n(1995) or Hecht, van Doorn, and Koenderink (1999) for a review. Distances are for example often\nunderestimated and may even depend on the texture of the ground surface (Sinai, Ooi, & He, 1998).\nHowever, detailed quantitative data on how the perceived aspect ratio of public spaces is related to\nphysical parameters are sparse. There are some documented cases where the physical aspect ratio was\nmanipulated so as to obtain a certain perceptual effect. Panofsky (1925) for example reported that the\nperceived aspect ratio of the St Paul's square in the Vatican is circular. However, actually, it is an oval\nwith an aspect ratio of roughly 1.4 (as measured on Google Maps, satellite image). In the present study,\nwe wanted to find out (1) how the aspect ratios of large public spaces are perceived, (2) how observers'\naspect ratio estimates relate to observers' distance estimates, and (3) how the perceived aspect ratios\nare affected by the viewers' position on the square.\nEarlier studies have shown that there are considerable systematic distortions in the visual space in\nthe psychophysics laboratory (e.g. Cook, 1978; Foley, 1980) as well as in large, open, outdoor spaces\n& Haber, 1993; Wagner, 1985). In particular, distances are usually underestimated, that is a depth\ncompression, relative to fronto-parallel distances (e.g. Loomis, da Silva, Fujita, & Fukusima, 1992;\nLoomis, da Silva, Philbeck, & Fukusima, 1996; Wagner, 1985). Wagner for example measured per-\nceived distance, perceived angles, and perceived area spanned by arbitrarily positioned flag-poles in a\nlarge open field. Wagner found that there was a considerable compression in the \"in-depth\" dimension\nrelative to fronto-parallel distances. Likewise, there were considerable flattening effects of perceived\nangles. Hecht et al. (1999) also reported a tendency for observers to perceive angles on buildings to\nbe less pointed or obtuse than veridical. Loomis and Philbeck (1999) raised the questions whether the\nin-depth compression, which they termed the anisotropy of the visual scene, is invariant for differ-\nent scales. Loomis and Philbeck used an L-shaped probe that was placed in the scene to measure the\nperceived aspect ratio at different locations in the scene. Interestingly, they found that the anisotropy\nwas invariant across scale for monocular viewing, but not for binocular viewing. They attributed this\nfinding to the fact that the reliability of binocular disparity as a depth cue falls off with increasing\ndistance to the observer.\nHe, Wu, Yarbrough, and Wu (2004) argued that the visual system builds a sequential representa-\ntion of the world starting with a ground surface area with a clear optical gradient close to the observer.\nThey refer to this model as the sequential-surface-integration-process (SSIP). The ground surfaces\nfarther away are \"glued\" to the closer areas. However, with increasing edges and occlusions in the\nground surface textures, the representations are more and more biased toward a default value lead-\ning to an increasing compression in the depth dimension as well as an upward slope of the perceived\nground surface. Ooi, Wu, and He (2006) used local luminous L-shaped probes viewed in otherwise\ncomplete darkness. They measured perceived egocentric distance to the probes using a blind-walking\nparadigm. They found that the perceived aspect ratio was indeed related to the perceived distance.\nLi and Durgin (2010) also found, in agreement with the SSIP, that the perceived slope of ground\nsurfaces was exaggerated with increasing distance from the observer. From the studies mentioned\nabove, it is hard to predict what would be the perceived aspect ratio of a large space, such as a city\nsquare that completely surrounds the observer. First, the observer is not merely judging distance but\nrather a ratio of orthogonal distances. And, the latter is not necessarily done by independently esti-\nmating length and width. Second, the typical sizes of city squares are much larger than the ranges\nthat are typically described in the vision literature. Scale is an important consideration in the present\ncontext because at such large sizes as city squares, the accuracy of binocular disparity as a depth cue\nrapidly decreases with increasing distance (see for example Loomis & Philbeck, 1999). Third, city\nsquares are closed spaces. That is, they are delimited by houses and walls and are not drawn on the\nground plane of an otherwise open field. The SSIP (He et al., 2004) predicts that the anisotropy of the\nvisual space increases with increasing number of ground surface edges and occlusions. Fourth, no\nprevious studies have reported what the perceived aspect ratio of the entire space is for large closed\nspaces such as city squares. Previous studies have measured the perceived local aspect ratio in the\nscene instead of the shape of the entire space in which the observer is located (e.g. He et al., 2004).\nAnd, finally, it is also not immediately evident whether the location of the observation point within a\ncertain environment matters.\nLet us consider a naive model in which distances in depth are always underestimated relative to\nlateral distances. And let us further assume that when the observer is standing at the edge of a city\nsquare, the distance in front of the observer to the opposing facade is the depth dimension and the\ndistance between the two lateral facades of the city square is the lateral distance. In that case, the obser-\nvation point should matter on a city square when judging its aspect ratio, which we define here as the\nratio of the long side over the short side of the city square: If standing on the long side of a rectangular\ncity square, the depth dimension is the short side of the city square, whereas if one is standing on the\nshort side, the depth dimension is the long side. It is also reasonable to consider the perceived aspect\nratio as the ratio of the perceived distances rather than the physical distances. Stevens (1975) argued\nthat perceived intensity could be described for many modalities as a power function of physical inten-\nsity. In our naive model, we also express the perceived distance as a power function. Given a constant\ndepth compression factor, the perceived aspect ratio would then respectively be as in Equations (1a)\nStanding on the short side:\n\n^ = (c * l)a/wa = ca a.(1a)\nLikewise, standing on the long side:\n\n^ = la/(c * w)a = c2a a,(1b)\nwhere \n^ is the perceived aspect ratio and  is the physical aspect ratio (length/width). l is the physical\ndistance along the long side of the city square (that is, the length), and w along the short side of the\ncity square (that is, the width). The parameter c indicates the compression factor in depth relative to\nthe width and is applied to either the width or the length of the city square depending on the observa-\ntion point. Therefore, the viewpoint would matter for the perceived aspect ratio. We did thus not add\na specific parameter for compression in the lateral dimension because the depth compression factor,\nc, is a relative parameter with respect to the lateral compression. The power exponent is indicated by\nthe parameter a. Please note that the absolute size has dropped out of Equations (1a) and (1b), but that\nthe exponent a is maintained.\nIn Figure 1(a), we have plotted how the perceived aspect ratio would be affected by viewing posi-\ntion when the distance in depth is underestimated by a factor of 0.75 relative to the lateral distance and\nan exponent a of 1. The dashed red and blue curves are for standing on the short respectively the long\nside. Figure 1(b) shows how the perceived aspect ratio would change as a function of the physical as-\npect ratio with a compression factor c of 0.75 and an exponent a of 0.75. As can be seen in Figure 1(b),\nwith a power exponent of less than 1, the perceived aspect ratio increases progressively less than the\nFigure 1.

A veridical percept (that is a depth\ncompression of 1) is shown as a solid black line.

For a power exponent larger than 1, the perceived aspect ratio would become\nprogressively more than the physical aspect ratio. Note that at this point in the paper the values for a\nand c have been chosen for illustration reasons only. However, compression factors c of 0.75 and ex-\nponents a of 0.75 are not unreasonable choices given the literature (e.g. Loomis et al., 1996; Wagner,\n1985). Wagner for example reports that fronto-lateral distances were perceived as about twice the size\nof distances in the \"in-depth\" dimension. Several other distance\u00addepth relations have been put forward\n(1a) and (1b) in their effect of viewing position can be derived from these distance\u00addepth relations\nsuch as the Gilinski (1951) distance function, although in that particular case the absolute distance\ndoes not drop out of the aspect ratio equations as it does in Equations (1a) and (1b) in the current\npaper. That is, the absolute size of a city square would be a factor in the Gilinski equation, whereas\nin our model absolute size is irrelevant. Note also that we have assumed the values of a and c to be\nconstant across the entire visual field although that would not necessarily be the case (cf. Koenderink,\nAs demonstrated above, there are some relatively simple reasons to expect effects of observer\nposition on the perceived aspect ratio of large public spaces but whether the perceived aspect ratio can\nbe modeled as such remains to be determined experimentally. It is for example a priori not unthinkable\nthat both the width and length of the city square are considered by the observer as egocentric, that is\n\"in-depth\" distances. Then, the compression factor c would apply equally in every direction. In that\ncase, there would not be an effect of viewing position at all. In order to determine what people see, we\nasked observers in two experiments to make direct aspect ratio and distance estimates at five different\npositions on five different city squares in Delft, the Netherlands. In the first experiment, participants\nset the aspect ratio of a small handheld rectangle to match the perceived aspect ratio of the city square\ndirectly. In the second experiment, participants were asked to report the city square's perceived length\nand width separately.\nThe participants and locations were the same for both experiments. They differed only in the tasks,\nwhich are described in Sections 3.1 and 4.1, respectively.\nParticipants\nSix female and five male (under)graduate students at the Delft University of Technology took part\nin both experiments. All participants reported having normal or corrected-to-normal vision. They re-\nceived a compensation of 10 euro per hour for their participation. All participants were naive and gave\nwritten, informed consent. Being local students, the participants were of course familiar with the city\ncenter of Delft. All experiments were in agreement with local ethical guidelines, Dutch Law and the\nDeclaration of Helsinki.\nLocations\nWe did the experiments on five different public squares in the historical city centre of Delft, the\nNetherlands, namely Bastiaansplein, Beestenmarkt, Burgwal, Markt, and Paardenmarkt. Photographic\nimpressions of these five squares, their locations and their aspect ratios are shown in Figure 2. All five\nsquares are within walking distance of each other. We measured all city squares' dimensions manu-\nally using a 100-m measuring tape. The five city squares were chosen such that they covered a range\nin aspect ratio from about 1.0 to as large as 7.1. The true physical dimensions of each city square are\nsummarized in Table 1.\nOn each city square we defined five observation points as shown in Figure 3. The observation\npoints were marked with numbered (10 cm high) flags stuck into the pavement.\nProcedure\nBoth experiments were conducted over a period of two days with five participants on day 1 and six\nparticipants on day 2. The weather on day 1 was cold and sunny, whereas day 2 was cold and cloudy.\nThe experiments took about five hours per day in total. The order in which the squares were visited on\nday 1 was Bastiaansplein, Beestenmarkt, Burgwal, Markt, and Paardenmarkt. The order was reversed\non day 2. On each city square, the five observation points were visited twice by all participants in the\nsame order. In the first pass, participants did the task for Experiment 1 and in the second pass they did\nthe task for Experiment 2.\nTask\nAt each observation point on a city square, participants were asked to turn and look around 360 degrees\n(on the spot) and subsequently adjust the two sliders on a device for masking photographs (an Easel\nMask from LPL Co. Ltd., shown in Figure 4) such that the aspect ratio of the rectangle on the device\nresembled the perceived aspect ratio of the rectangular shape of the city square. The participants were\nnotified that the task comprises the perceived shape, and not their best cognitive guess. The units on\nthe rulers on the sides were removed. The setting of the sliders was recorded by drawing the resulting\naspect ratio on an underlying piece of paper. The device was always held in portrait orientation with\nthe sliders at the left and the bottom. Participants were also asked to indicate their relative orientation\non the city square with a little \"x\" on the paper.\nResults\nWe measured the length and width of the rectangles drawn by the observers. We divided the length by\nthe width to obtain what is henceforth called the indicated aspect ratio.\nThe indicated aspect ratios averaged across participants are shown in Figure 5(a) for each obser-\nvation point on the five city squares. The error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. At a first\nvisual inspection of Figure 5(a) it can be seen that the indicated aspect ratios are in general lower than\nthe physical aspect ratio. The difference between the two is getting larger with increasing physical\naspect ratio of the city square.\nWe did a 5  5 (city square  observation point) repeated measures ANOVA with the indicated\naspect ratio as the dependent variable and participants as independent replications. We applied a\nGreenhouse-Geisser correction on the degrees of freedom for the main effect of city squares and its\nFigure 2.

There were significant main effects of both differences between\ncity squares and also between different observation points.\nThe indicated aspect ratios were lower at observation point 2 (midway the short side of the city\nsquare) than at observation point 4 (midway the long side of the city square). The fact that our results\ncould be fitted with our model suggests that there is indeed a compression factor in depth relative\nFigure 5.

Furthermore, the underestimation of the aspect ratio increases with increasing\nphysical aspect ratio as predicted by assuming that distance estimation increases as a power law with\nincreasing physical distance.\nIn the second experiment, we wanted to find out whether the results are task dependent. In this ex-\nperiment, we asked people to make separate judgments of the perceived length and width of the city\nsquares. From these two distance estimations, we calculated the aspect ratio by simply dividing the\ntwo. The obtained ratio from the separate length and width estimates is henceforth called the calcu-\nlated distance ratio.\nTask\nAt each of the five observation points on each square, the participants were asked to estimate two\ndistances, namely the length and the width of the city square. The participants were asked to estimate\nhow many times a stick of approximately 1.2 m fitted in each distance. It was explicitly emphasized\nthat it was their perception that counted, and that they had to reconsider their estimates anew at each\nviewing position. During the task, the stick was held horizontally and frontally in the field of view of\nthe participants by one of the experimenters. Participants were not told the exact length of the stick in\ncentimeters to prevent interference of prior knowledge of sizes and distances in known units, such as\nmeters.\nResults\nThe calculated distance ratio for each city square and observation point is shown in Figure 5(b). On\na first visual inspection of Figure 5(b), it may be seen that the calculated distance ratios, determined\nin this indirect way, are close to veridical except for the most elongated city square, that is Burgwal,\nwhich showed a calculated distance ratio that is considerably lower than the physical aspect ratio.\nAs in Experiment 1 we did a 5  5 (city square  observation point) ANOVA with repeated\nmeasures. We applied a Greenhouse-Geisser correction to the degrees of freedom for city square and\nits interaction effect. There was a significant main effect of the city square (F\nbut there was no significant main effect of the observation point (F\nwas no significant interaction effect (F\ngender as independent between-groups factors in the design, but, as in Experiment 1, there was neither\na significant effect of day nor of gender.\nWe then fitted the two models developed in Equations (1a) and (1b) simultaneously to the data\nusing a least-squares criterion, with the physical aspect ratio and the observation point (2 and 4) as\npredictor values. If the value for the observation point was \"two,\" then Equation (1a) was used, else\nEquation (1b) was used. When averaging the data across participants, we found a compression factor c\nfits for each participant ranged between 0.91 and 1.25 for the compression factor c and between 0.59\nand 0.93 for the exponent a. The best-fitting model is shown in Figure 6(b).\nFinally, we calculated the correlation across participants between the mean indicated aspect ratios\nacross all city squares and observations points, and the mean calculated distance ratios across all con-\nSummary\nThe averaged calculated distance ratios were close to veridical for all city squares, except for the most\nelongated city square, the Burgwal. In contrast to Experiment 1, we did not find a significant depend-\nency of the distance ratios on the observation point. When fitting the model from Equation (1), we\nfound that the compression factor c was larger than 1 (but as already suggested by the above ANOVA\nresults, a value of 1 was within its confidence interval). The exponent a was significantly lower than 1,\nindicating that the aspect ratio was progressively more underestimated when the city square was more\nelongated.\n5 Discussion\nIn both experiments, we convincingly found that observers were indeed able to estimate the city\nsquares' aspect ratios, and that in both cases their estimates increased monotonously with the physical\naspect ratio. However, there were some marked differences between the results of Experiments 1 and 2.\nIn Experiment 1, we found that participants underestimated the aspect ratios of city squares, irrespec-\ntive of the observation point, except when the city square's aspect ratio was close to 1 (Paardenmarkt).\nIn Experiment 2, the calculated distance ratio was only lower than the physical ratio for the most elon-\ngated city square (Burgwal) while the calculated distance ratios for the other four city squares were\nclose to veridical. Taken all together, we could say that the underestimation of the aspect ratio was\ngetting more pronounced when the city square was more elongated and that it was more pronounced\nfor Experiment 1 than for Experiment 2.\nThe indicated aspect ratio was typically smaller than the actual aspect ratio, except for the smallest\nphysical aspect ratio (1). In this case, the aspect ratio was slightly overestimated. Taken as a whole,\nthese results suggest that the aspect ratio is biased toward some intermediate value. Indeed observers\nprefer a template over a \"correct\" setting. These findings are very hard to explain in terms of a model\nof vision as inverse optics. Apparently, observers are hardly concerned with the issue of veridicality.\nThere is no evolutionary pressure toward veridicality as such. Rather, the evolutionary pressure is\ntoward optimal efficaciousness in the interaction with the world that relies on optical factors. But a\ndemand for optimal efficaciousness runs counter to a demand for veridicality (Hoffman, 2009; Mark,\nMarion, & Hoffman, 2010). Agents need a fast and reliable optical interface, rather than a system that\nbuilds a veridical representation (Koenderink, 2010).\nWe also found indications that the observation point had an effect on the direct measurements\n(Experiment 1) of the perceived aspect ratio consistent with a compression factor c in depth lower\nthan 1. A depth compression factor c of 0.85 seems in line with previous findings in the literature (e.g.,\nWagner, 1985). However, in Experiment 2, using the indirect method of letting observers estimate\nlength and width independently, we found that all observation points were not significantly different\nfrom a compression factor equal to 1. The difference in the results of Experiments 1 and 2 suggests to\nus that observers may be judging the aspect ratio in Experiment 1 as if one dimension of the square is\na \"dimension in depth,\" and a second dimension is a \"lateral\" dimension, whereas in Experiment 2,\nboth dimensions may be seen as egocentric distances. That is, in Experiment 2, when only one distance\nis estimated at the time, the lateral distance may also be estimated as if it is an egocentric distance,\nfor example by summing the distances from the self to nearest parts of the lateral facades rather than\nlooking across the city square to judge the distance along the frontal facade. Other explanations are\npossible; the current explanation is just one of them.\nWhy the exponent a is so much smaller in Experiment 1 (0.5) than in Experiment 2 (0.78) is not\nclear. We also found that there was no correlation across participants between Experiments 1 and 2.\nIn other words, it is not predictable on the level of the individual what the perceived aspect ratio of a\ncity square will be using different tasks to measure the perception of the same city square. At present,\nwe have no explanation for these two findings. The fact that the observers' task can affect perception\ncan however readily be found in the literature (e.g., Koenderink, van Doorn, Kappers, & Todd, 2001;\nIn conclusion, first, in general the length/width aspect ratio is underestimated. Second, the under-\nestimation is larger in a direct task than in an indirect task. And, third, the observation point matters\nwhen the aspect ratios are measured in a direct manner, with larger underestimations of the aspect ratio\nwhen standing on the short side of the city square than when standing on the long side. Given the sizes\nof the effects reported in the current paper, it seems prudent in urban planning to consider not only\nthe physical aspect ratio but also the manner in which the city square is to be typically perceived and\nwhere the principal viewing points on the city square are.\n"
