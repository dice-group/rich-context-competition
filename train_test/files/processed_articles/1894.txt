Previous studies have reported a positive association between urine mercury levels and the\nnumber of dental amalgams, but this relation has never been described in a nationally representative\nsample in the United States.\nAims and Methods: Using household interview, dietary interview, dental examination, and laboratory\ndata from the 1999\u00ad2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the association\nbetween mercury concentrations and dental restorations was examined in US women of reproductive age.\nResults: In women of childbearing age, approximately 13% of all posterior dental surfaces were restored\nwith amalgams and the average urinary mercury level in women was low (1.34 mg/l). It is estimated that\nan increase of 1.8 mg/l in the log transformed values for mercury in urine would occur for each 10 dental\nsurfaces restored with amalgam.\nConclusions: Although the findings do not address the important issues of adverse health effects at low\nthresholds of mercury exposure, they do provide important reference data that should contribute\nsignificantly to the ongoing scientific and public health policy debate on the use of dental amalgams in the\nDuring the previous decade, there have been significant\nefforts by the federal government and the dental\nprofession to review and disseminate the existing state\nof knowledge regarding mercury amalgam dental restoration\nsafety. In 1993, the US Public Health Service issued an expert\npanel summary report concluding that mercury amalgam\nwas a safe and effective dental restorative material.1 2 The\nAmerican Dental Association's Council on Scientific Affairs\ncomprehensive review in 1998 reached a similar conclusion.3\nNevertheless, the safety of mercury amalgams remains a\nconcern and a topic of numerous recent scientific publica-\ntions. Because of continuing concerns, the Food and Drug\nAdministration issued a request for information regarding\nAlthough mercury has serious health effects at high\nexposure, debate continues regarding adverse health effects\nat low levels of mercury exposure from fish and dental\namalgams.5 The existing epidemiological literature on the\nhealth effects related to low levels of elemental and inorganic\nmercury exposure should be considered incomplete. Many\nstudies have been small, cross-sectional convenience sam-\nples, or used relatively short follow up times. There is also the\ntechnical limitation that urinary mercury values reflect a\ncombination of both recent exposure and body burden, and\nthe two are imperfectly correlated. The World Health\nOrganisation has called for chronic mercury exposure studies\nthat would be useful in defining a threshold of biological\neffects below the level of 25 mg/l in urine, and that are not\nlimited by insufficient statistical power, or inconsistent\nmeasures of exposure or outcome.6 To address some of these\nissues, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial\nResearch began funding two children's amalgam trials in\n1996. Both two-arm trials are to be conducted over a seven\nyear period on elementary aged children living in the\nnortheastern United States and Portugal.\nMercury exists in several oxidation states: metallic or\nelemental mercury (Hg0), inorganic mercury (IHg: including\nHg+ (mercurous salts) and Hg++ (mercuric salts)), and\norganic mercury (principally methylmercury (MeHg), but\nalso ethyl-, phenylmercury, and others). Mercury absorption\nand relative toxicity depend on its chemical form. All forms of\nmercury are neurotoxic depending on dose, but MeHg has the\ngreatest potential neurotoxicity, with Hg++ less so. Both Hg0\nand Hg++ are nephrotoxic. Vapour inhalation is the principal\nroute of exposure to elemental mercury, which is then\noxidised to Hg++ and excreted in the urine.\nIt is estimated that the majority of the daily intake of\nmercury compounds is MeHg derived from dietary sources\n(contaminated fish) and to a lesser extent, elemental\nmercury from mercury vapour in dental amalgams.7 8 In\n1999, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry\nissued a public health statement on mercury, stating that\ndental amalgam was a major source of elemental mercury\nexposure in the general population. Other common sources of\nelemental mercury exposure are certain occupations, house-\nhold products such as batteries, thermostats, fluorescent\nlights, and thermometers, and also contaminated air near\nmedical incinerators and coal burning power plants.9\nApproximately 95% of MeHg in fish is absorbed by the\ngastrointestinal tract10 and MeHg has a biological half-life of\nabout 70 days.11 Total blood mercury is a principal biomarker\nfor MeHg exposure but it is thought that a small amount of\nblood MeHg is metabolised to IHg and excreted in the urine.8\nHistorically, the composition of dental amalgam has\nchanged very little with the mixture containing copper, tin,\nsilver, and up to 50% of elemental mercury by weight.\nand Nutrition Examination Survey; IHg, inorganic mercury; MeHg,\nmethylmercury\nwww.occenvmed.com\ngroup.bmj.com\noem.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nMercury vapour can be released from amalgam restorations\nthe generated mercury vapour is inhaled, with 80% absorbed\nvia the lungs and distributed to the brain and kidneys.7 18 19\nElimination is via the urine and faeces,20\u00ad22 and up to 40% of\nthe absorbed mercury is eliminated within 30 days following\nvapour exposure.23 It is estimated that for every 10 dental\namalgam surfaces, mercury urinary concentrations will\nAccurate national estimates of IHg body burden among\npersons with dental amalgams are essential for any popula-\ntion based risk assessment.

The aim of our study is\ntwofold: (1) to describe the relation between dental restora-\ntions and urine mercury concentrations using a nationally\nrepresentative sample of women of childbearing age; and (2)\nto produce models that improve our understanding of risk\nindicators for increased urinary mercury for women in the\nMETHODS\nStudy population\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a representative\nsample of the civilian, non-institutionalised population in the\nyears of age, persons 60 years and older, non-Hispanic blacks,\nand Mexican Americans. Furthermore, all women who\nindicated that they were pregnant at the time of the\nscreening interview were selected into the sample, and low\nincome white persons were over sampled in 2000. An\nNHANES protocols and informed consent was obtained from\nall participants, with parents or guardians providing consent\nfor individuals less than 18 years of age. The NHANES is\nconducted by the National Center for Health Statistics of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

We excluded 125\nwomen who did not participate in the examination at a\nmobile examination centre and 71 women who lacked urine\nmercury or creatinine data. We excluded 107 participants\nlacking information on dental restorations and 12 women\nwho were edentulous. Three individuals with extremely high\nlevels of urine, blood, and hair mercury were excluded\nbecause it was unlikely that their mercury exposure was\nrelated to dental amalgam. The final analytical study group\nMercury\nUrine specimens were analysed by flow injection cold vapour\natomic absorption by the Division of Laboratory Sciences at\nCDC's National Center for Environmental Health.25 The limit\nof detection for urine mercury was 0.14 mg/l.

Each posterior tooth has five coronal\nsurfaces: mesial (the front facing interproximal side),\nocclusal (the chewing area of a tooth), distal (the interprox-\nimal side towards the tonsils/pharynx), buccal (the cheek\nside), and lingual (the tongue side). We also derived the\nnumber of occlusal surfaces restored with dental amalgam. If\na tooth had all five dental surfaces restored, we assumed that\nthose surfaces were restored with a fabricated dental crown\nand we excluded those surfaces from the amalgam deriva-\ntion. The extent of amalgam restored surfaces was calculated\nby summing the derived surfaces, dividing by the number of\ndental surfaces evaluated, and multiplying by 100.\nCovariates\nDemographic and health behaviour data were obtained from\na home interview questionnaire and an MEC interview. Race/\nethnicity was categorised as non-Hispanic black, Mexican\nAmerican, non-Hispanic white, and ``other''. Persons identi-\nfied as ``other'' were included in the total population\nestimates but not in the regression analyses. Educational\nattainment was categorised as having some college educa-\ntion, completing high school, or not completing high school.\nUsing guidelines established by the National Institute on\nAlcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, an individual's reported\naverage alcohol consumption over the past 12 months was\ncategorised as moderate or heavy drinker, light drinker, or\nabstainer.27 Information for both education and alcohol\nconsumption was available only for persons 20 years of age\nor older when we conducted our study. Persons with a serum\ncotinine level of 10 ng/ml or higher were classified as current\nsmokers.\nRecent dental care utilisation was dichotomised as either\nhaving a dental visit in the past 12 months or not. Fish and\nshellfish information was obtained from a MEC dietary\ninterview. Following the 24-hour dietary recall, respondents\nwere queried regarding consumption of various species of\nfish or shellfish during the past 30 days. Individuals were\ngrouped into either having consumed any fish and/or\nshellfish within the past 30 days or not. Age was analysed\ninformation was obtained from self-report and MEC preg-\nnancy test results.\nWe used information on lean skeletal muscle mass, fasting,\nand urine creatinine to correct for urine dilution effects as\npart of the modelling process and is detailed further in the\nDiscussion section. Lean skeletal muscle mass (kg) was\nestimated with a validated prediction equation.28 The\nreported number of whole hours since food or drink was\nlast consumed was used to determine fasting status. Fasting\nwas used as a discrete variable and ranged from 0\u00ad46 hours.\nUrine creatinine levels (mg/dl) were measured with a\nBeckman Synchron CX3 Clinical Analyser which uses the\nJaffe\n` rate reaction.29 We used creatinine in urine as a\ncontinuous variable for this analysis. In the medical\nliterature, both unadjusted and creatinine corrected urinary\nmercury values are commonly reported. We include both\napproaches in our results to allow for comparisons with other\nstudies in the literature.\nData analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed with SUDAAN soft-\nware (Version 8.0; RTI, Research Triangle Park, NC) and SAS\nsoftware (Version 8.02; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). We\nused sample weights to account for the unequal probability of\nselection and non-response to the study to produce estimates,\nregression coefficients, and related standard errors. Standard\nerrors were calculated in SUDAAN using the delete 1\njackknife method. The mercury geometric means were\nobtained with the GEOMETRIC option in SUDAAN and\nstandard deviations were calculated in SAS using the\nalgorithm described in the Appendix. Because mercury was\nnot normally distributed in blood or urine, we used the\nnatural log transformation. Weighted Pearson correlation\ncoefficients and related p values were calculated in SAS.\nLinear regression models were used to estimate unadjusted\nand adjusted coefficients and related standard errors with\np , 0.05 considered statistically significant. The log transfor-\nmation of urine mercury and creatinine corrected urinary\nmercury were used as dependent variables. All independent\nvariables were modelled as previously described; regressions\nwere performed separately for the total number of derived\namalgam dental restorations and the extent of amalgam\nrestorations. We used non-automated stepwise regression\nmodelling to assess the relation between the covariates.\nParsimonious models were determined by covariate exclusion\nwith criteria for inclusion set at p , 0.05 using the Wald F-\nstatistic. We assessed for potential interactions throughout the\nmodelling process but no significant interactions were found.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents the sample size and distribution by selected\nhad reported a dental visit within the past 12 months, 25.7%\nwere smokers, and nearly 78% had consumed some fish and/\nor shellfish in the past 30 days.

A similar\nfinding was observed for creatinine corrected urinary\nmercury concentration (b = 0.06). Given that women in\nthis study group had approximately nine dental amalgam\nsurfaces (n = 8.7), we estimate that dental amalgams\ncontribute approximately 0.6 mg/l to the overall log trans-\nformed urinary mercury concentrations for the average\nwoman in the USA. Kingman and coworkers estimated\nthat an increase of nearly 0.5 mg/l in the log transformed\nvalue for total urinary mercury concentration would occur\nmen.24 On the non-log scale, our findings indicate that for\nevery 10 dental amalgam surfaces, creatinine corrected\nurinary mercury concentration would increase by 1.8 mg/g.\nFor context, we found that 75% of women in the USA had\napproximately 12 restored posterior dental surfaces or less,\nand within this group, the average creatinine corrected\nurinary mercury concentration was 0.81 mg/g (urine mercury\nconcentration was 1.03 mg/l) (data not shown).\nOur findings suggest that the background urinary mercury\nconcentration for dentate women of reproductive age (that is,\nurine mercury levels for women with no dental restorations)\n(data not shown).

One\nstandard approach has been to divide urine mercury by urine\ncreatinine to produce a creatinine corrected urinary mercury\nlevel. We used this derivation as the dependent variable for\nregression analyses presented in table 5. In an alternative\napproach, we used urinary creatinine as an independent\nvariable along with the other covariates of fasting status and\nlean skeletal muscle mass to adjust for the effects of urinary\ndilution on mercury levels. The results of these regression\nanalyses produced similar beta coefficients for the dental\namalgam exposure covariates. Additionally, urine creatinine\nlevels, leaner skeletal muscle mass, and length of the fast\nwere significantly associated with log transformed urine\nmercury levels in a parsimonious multivariate linear model\n(data not shown).\nTable 3 The mean number, percent extent, and related standard errors (SE) for dental surfaces by selected characteristics for\nCharacteristic\nTotal posterior\nsurfaces\nRestored posterior\nsurfaces\nRestored occlusal\nsurfaces\nAmalgam\nposterior surfaces*\nAmalgam\nocclusal surfaces*\nExtent of amalgam\nsurfaces*\nMean (SE) Mean (SE) Mean (SE) Mean (SE) Mean (SE) % (SE)\nAge\nRace/ethnicity\nPregnant\nEducation\u00c0\nCotinine smoking status`\nAlcohol consumption\u00c0\nFish and/or shellfish consumption\nHad a dental visit past 12 months\n*Derived ``amalgam'' surfaces.\n\u00c0Information for education and alcohol available only on 20\u00ad49 year olds.\n`A smoker is defined as having a cotinine level of 10 ng/ml or higher.\nTable 4 Correlations between mercury concentrations and selected characteristics for women aged 16\u00ad49 years: United\nCharacteristics\nOriginal scale values Log scale values\nBlood\u00c0 Urine` Creatinine1 Blood Urine Creatinine\nR (p value) R (p value) R (p value) R (p value) R (p value) R (p value)\nR: weighted Pearson correlation coefficients calculated in SAS.\nUrine Hg and creatinine adjusted values, n = 1626.\n*Derived ``amalgam'' surfaces.\n\u00c0Total mercury in blood (mg/l).\n`Urine mercury (mg/l).\n1Creatinine corrected urine mercury (mg/g).\n372 Dye, Schober, Dillon, et al\nwww.occenvmed.com\ngroup.bmj.com\noem.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nTotal mercury in blood, an indicator of MeHg exposure,35\nremained a significant indicator for urine mercury concen-\ntrations in the parsimonious models, whereas fish or shellfish\nconsumption did not. The multivariate regression results\npresented here are consistent with the metabolism of MeHg\nto IHg8 and suggest that MeHg exposure from fish\nconsumption contributes to urinary mercury levels. It is also\npossible that IHg levels due to amalgam exposure are a\ncomponent of total blood mercury, particularly in women\nwith low fish consumption.\nIt has been reported that the elimination of mercury from\nblood following removal of dental amalgam reflects a half-\nlife of approximately 30 days.36 In addition to seafood\nconsumption, Vahter and coworkers have reported that IHg\nin maternal and cord blood and mercury in fetal tissues\nincreases as the number of maternal dental amalgam\nincreases.37 Additionally, it has been reported that mercury\nin breast milk at the time of birth was associated with the\nnumber of dental amalgam restorations and fish consump-\ntion, but after two months of lactation, only fish consump-\ntion remained significant.38 Consequently, the speciation of\nmercury is an important consideration for assessing exposure\nand evaluating health risks.\nWhile pregnant women have higher plasma volumes and\nhigher globular filtration rates (GFRs), independent effects of\npregnancy on urine IHg were not significant during the\nregression modelling. We also investigated potential effects of\nmoderate/severe renal impairment (GFR ,60), proteinuria,\nand a very high recent dietary protein intake on urinary\nmercury levels, and found no relation to urinary mercury\nconcentrations. Although selenium may interact with mer-\ncury,39 40 serum selenium data was not available to address\nthis issue.\nAlcohol is a competitive substrate for the hydrogen\nperoxide catalase pathway in red blood cells that oxidises\ninhaled elemental mercury into its divalent inorganic form,\nwhich is subsequently excreted in the urine. Although a\npositive association with alcohol intake and mercury exhala-\ntion has been reported,41 Kingman and coworkers found a\nnegative association between alcohol consumption and\nurinary mercury.24 Others have reported no association\nbetween alcohol and urinary mercury.42 43 Our findings also\nsuggest a lack of an association, but the relatively low overall\nconsumption of alcohol per person limited our ability to\naddress this issue.\nSocioeconomic influences significantly affect the utilisa-\ntion of dental care. Because poverty/income information was\nunavailable at the time of this analysis, we used education\nand dental visit information to mitigate this limitation.\nAlthough we were unable to use information on education\nfor persons 16\u00ad19 years of age, we did analyse the data for\n20\u00ad49 year olds and found no significant contribution to the\nTable 5 Linear regression results (coefficients (b), standard errors (SE), and p values) for log transformed urine mercury and\ncreatinine corrected urine mercury concentrations in women aged 16\u00ad49 years for selected characteristics: United States,\nCharacteristic\nLog transformed urine mercury concentration Log transformed creatinine corrected urine mercury\nUnadjusted models Multivariate model* Unadjusted models Multivariate model\u00c0\nb (SE) p value b (SE) p value b (SE) p value b (SE) p value\nAge\n16\u00ad19 years Reference Reference Reference\nRace/ethnicity\nNon-Hispanic white Reference Reference Reference\nPregnant\nNo Reference Reference\nEducation`\nSome college Reference Reference\nCotinine smoking status1\nNon-smoker Reference Reference\nHad a dental visit past 12 months\nNo Reference Reference\nFish and/or shellfish consumption in\nNo Reference Reference\nAlcohol consumption`\nAbstainer Reference Reference\nNA, not applicable.\n\u00ad, indicates that the covariate was not included in the model.\n*Model 1: most parsimonious model when dependent variable is log transformed urine mercury (mg/l).\n\u00c0Model 2: most parsimonious model when dependent variable is log transformed creatinine corrected urine mercury (mg/g).\n`Information for education and alcohol available only on 20\u00ad49 year olds.

As a practical matter, large numbers of women in\nthis age range are home makers, and have never been\nemployed. Further, as a nationally representative sample, the\nfrequency of persons employed in mercury exposed occupa-\ntions in NHANES (that is, certain manufacturing jobs, dental\nworkers, etc) is comparatively small. Also, we found no\nrelation between general employment status and urinary\nmercury concentrations.\nAlthough very small amounts of mercury are known to\noccur in tobacco products,44\u00ad46 our final regression models\nindicated a significant inverse association between smoking\nand urinary mercury levels. We do not have an explanation\nfor this finding. We believe it is potentially due to an\nunidentified confounder, such as dental health care beha-\nviour, rather than representing a true biological effect.\nThere are additional study limitations. Our cross-sectional\ndesign does not permit definitive evaluation of causality or\ntemporal relations. Because we used posterior dental restora-\ntions as a surrogate for amalgam fillings, misclassification of\nexposure may have affected our findings. We minimised this\nbias by discounting any restored surface area indicative of a\nfabricated dental crown. Additionally, some of the dental\nsurfaces could have been restored with non-amalgam\nmaterials; however, this misclassification error most likely\nwould have underestimated the magnitude of the association\nbetween urinary mercury and dental amalgams. Although we\ncannot quantitate this error, it is notable that our findings are\nsimilar to the Kingman et al study which used actual clinical\ninformation on amalgam restorations. The strength of this\nstudy is its use of a nationally representative sample not\nselected by multiple risk indicators or other potentially\nconfounding factors.\nThis is the first study to evaluate the relation between\ndental restorations and mercury concentrations in a nation-\nally representative sample in the United States.

Although our findings do not\naddress the important issues of adverse health effects at low\nthresholds of mercury exposure, they do provide important\nreference data that should contribute significantly to the\nongoing scientific and public health policy debate on the use\nof dental amalgams in the USA.\n"
