It was to use his nose to draw\nimages that were upside down. Only when his hapless human sidekick reoriented the image would its\nsubject matter become clear: A car or tree or a human's face would emerge from what just moments\nbefore had seemed a meaningless graphic jumble http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwNrG9a22nc.\nIn the field of human perception, this phenomenon is rather more formally known as the Inversion\nEffect. It manifests in a range of situations such that physical orientation of an image determines its\ninterpretability: Images that easily are interpreted when presented right side up are rendered meaningless\nwhen presented upside down. In the case of the Thatcher Illusion (Thompson, 1980), for example, only\nwhen a previously inverted image is presented right side up does it become clear the well-known face\nactually has incorporated into it gross structural anomalies (see, for example, Bartlett & Searcy, 1993).\nWhole body representations are similarly prone to the effects of physical inversion. Point-light\nwalkers--usually a high-value stimulus from which observers can almost instantly interpret complex\nand detailed information (Johansson, 1973)--become a far less reliable source of information when\npresented upside down (Ikeda, Blake, & Watanabe, 2005; Pavlova & Sokolov, 2000; Proffitt &\nBertenthal, 1990; Sumi, 1984). Moreover, the consequences to interpretability of physical inversion\nseem to be generalized: They manifest across a range of tasks including detection of figures in visual\nSeeing the world topsy-turvy: The primary role of kinematics\nin biological motion inversion effects\n*Corresponding author.\n121 Fitzgerald S-A, Brooks A, van der Zwan R, Blair D\nAccounts of the mechanisms underlying these effects usually focus on the consequences of physi-\ncal inversion for configural or structural processing (Bertenthal & Pinto, 1994; Dittrich, 1993; Proffitt\nIn the case of both faces and point-light walkers, the consensus view has been that mechanisms spe-\ncialized for those respective types of body representations are so highly tuned to the \"normal\" or\nright-side-up structure that disruptions imposed by physical inversion undermine the entire stimulus\nprocessing sequence (Freire, Lee, & Symons, 2000; Leder & Bruce, 2000; Maurer, Le Grand, &\nMore recently, however, evidence has emerged suggesting the story may be more complex. Troje\nand Westhoff (2006) argue that, in the case of biological motion perceptions at least, the explanatory\npower of the so-called \"shape inversion effect\" is insufficient. They posit an alternative account in\nwhich motion or kinematic processing also plays a role. According to their model, there is an hier-\narchy of contributions to the inversion effect such that disruption of structural processing plays a\nsecondary role to disruption of kinematic processing. That is, while the processing of structural cues\nremains relatively uncompromised when point-light figures are presented upside down, the processing\nof kinematic cues is strongly compromised (Troje & Westhoff, 2006).\nInterestingly, Johnson and Tassinary (2005) independently propose a model for the perception of\nsex cues that is consistent with Troje and Westhoff's (2006) account of inversion effects. Like Troje\nand Westhoff, Johnson and Tassinary propose a structure/kinematic processing hierarchy, but one that\nmediates not biological motion perceptions generally but sex discriminations specifically. In particular,\nJohnson and Tassinary propose that, when discriminating the sex of an individual, structural cues are the\nprimary and direct driver of sex perceptions and that kinematic cues are secondary, or indirect indicators.\nIn the context of inversion effects, Johnson and Tassinary's model is consistent with Troje and West-\nhoff's: It predicts that under inversion conditions, perceptions arising from the processing of structural\ncues should be more robust to inversion than perceptions driven by the processing of kinematic cues.\nThere is some evidence to support those two models, but it is controversial. Barclay et al. (1978)\nfirst reported that inversion of point-light walkers leads to systematic misperceptions of the sex of the\nwalkers such that inverted females look male, and inverted males look female. Mather and Murdoch\n(1994), investigating the mechanisms that give rise to perceived sex, proposed that kinematic cues\n(rather than structural cues) mediate sex perceptions. They argued that the inversion effects reported\nby Barclay et al. may have been mediated by confusions driven by the relative velocities of hip and\nshoulder markers in Barclay's original point-light displays. While the idea that kinematic rather than\nstructural cues drive sex perceptions contradicts the model proposed by Johnson and Tassinary (2005),\nMather and Murdoch's account of the effect is consistent with the idea that inversion disrupts the pro-\ncessing of kinematic rather than structural information.\nWith that in mind, the general aim of the experiments described here was to investigate the impact\nof inversion on biological motion processing. More specifically, the experiments reported here inves-\ntigated the impact of inversion on sex discriminations made on the basis of structural and kinematic\ncues. Experiment 1 shows that sex discriminations made on the basis of structural cues alone are unaf-\nfected by inversion. Sex discriminations made on the basis of kinematic cues are disrupted by inver-\nsion, but only for male point-light walkers. Experiment 2 shows those effects persist when kinematic\nsex cues are paired with coherent structural sex cues. Together, these experiments confirm a sex cues\nprocessing hierarchy that is consistent with the models of biological motion processing proposed by\nboth Troje and Westhoff (2006) and Johnson and Tassinary (2005). In that hierarchy, structural cues to\nsex are more resilient to orientation changes than are kinematic cues.\nParticipants\nParticipants comprised seven males and seven females (age-range: 21\u00ad56 years). All had normal or\ncorrected-to-normal vision. Prior to testing, each participant received an information sheet explaining\nthe experimental task and informed written consent was obtained. Experiments were conducted in\naccordance with the Helsinki Declaration (2008).\nDesign\nA repeated-measures design was used in both experiments. Using a two-alternative forced-choice\n(2AFC) paradigm, participants discriminated each of a series of point-light walkers (presented in ran-\nRole of kinematics in biological motion inversion effects 122\ndomized order) as \"male\" or \"female.\" The independent variables were strength of sex cues (structure\nmodel/kinematic model--see below) and point-light orientation (upright vs inverted). The dependent\nvariable was proportion of \"male\" responses for each type of stimulus (model combination 1 orientation)\nshown. Analyses of the data were conducted by using the PSY statistical program (Professor Kevin\nBird, University of NSW, Kensington NSW, Australia).\nApparatus\nStimuli were presented on a 19\" monitor positioned 37 cm from each participant such that 1 cm\nsubtended 1\u00b0 of visual angle. Participants indicated their responses using a standard QWERTY key-\nboard (M and Z keys signalling female or male counterbalanced across participants). PointLightLab\n(Version 4.5.10), a custom-developed program, was used to generate point-light walker stimuli.\nStimuli\nThe point-light walker stimuli used for these experiments were adapted from 13 models constructed\n50 males) using the techniques described elsewhere (Troje, 2008). The 13 models provided describe a\ngender continuum that steps from an extreme female model (continuum value 26) in single standard\ndeviation units to an extreme male model (continuum value 16). The model at 0 on the continuum\nrepresents the average from all the walkers.\nEach of Troje's original models is composed of two sets of information. There are structural\ncoordinates defining the starting locations of each of the 15 point-lights (structure cues) from which\neach walker is composed--see Figure 1. Those coordinates vary the locations of the point-lights as a\nfunction of the strength of the sex cues: The positions of the 15 points, with respect to each other, is\ndifferent for each model on the original continuum. Paired with each of those points is also kinematic\ninformation that describes changes in location of each joint coordinate over time for each particular\nmodel. That path information is such that each joint travels a predictable track that returns to its origi-\nnal starting position each complete (two steps) walking cycle. In that way, in the original continuum,\neach of the 13 models varies simultaneously in both structural and kinematic cues to sex.\nFor the stimuli used here, we separated, for each point-light at each point along the continuum,\nthe structural and kinematic cues and then recombined those separate cues in unique ways to create\nnew walkers that vary in the strength of sex cues carried by structure, by kinematics, or by both. For\nexample, the starting positions of the 15 point-lights used to describe the structure of the objectively\nsex-neutral walker (structural cues, model 0) can be paired with the kinematic (path) information from\nthat same model in the standard configuration. Here, we describe that model in terms of its structure/\nkinematic components as 0/0. Similarly, it is possible to pair the sex-neutral model structural cues with\nthe kinematic cues from the 25 female walker for a unique model described here as 0/25. In those\ntwo examples, the structural information about the sex of the walker has been held constant while the\nkinematic cues to sex have changed. It is similarly possible to combine the -5 model structure with the\nwalkers that vary in the strength of their structural sex cues but which simultaneously are equal in terms\nof their kinematic cues to sex. Those pairing manipulations for each experiment are detailed below.\nStimuli were in sagittal view and each walker subtended an average visual angle of 16.7\u00b0 in height\nand 6.8\u00b0 in width. All 15 points of light were depicted as white dots, each with a luminance level of 160\ncd/m\u00b2 and were presented on a gray background of 12.5 cd/m\u00b2. The Michelson contrast [(Lmax 2Lmin)/\n(Lmax 1 Lmin)] between the luminance level of the white points of light and background was 0.42.\nProcedure\nParticipants were seated in a light and sound-attenuated room. Instructions were presented both orally\nand in written form on the computer screen before testing commenced. Participants were asked to\nrespond as quickly and accurately as possible. Testing was completed in a single session. All par-\nticipants completed an initial practice block comprising 10 trials for the purpose of task familiariza-\ntion. During and after practice, participants were encouraged to ask questions of the observer. Stimuli\nwere presented in blocks (see below) with block orders randomized between participants. Within each\nblock, stimuli were presented in randomized orders within and across participants. Presentation dura-\ntion for each stimulus was 1000 ms, which equates in this case to one point-light walker step. The\ninterstimulus interval was 1000 ms. Participants indicated for each stimulus observed whether they\nbelieved the walker to be \"male\" or \"female.\"\n123 Fitzgerald S-A, Brooks A, van der Zwan R, Blair D\nAs already noted, Troje and Westhoff's (2006) account of the inversion effect, which marries with\nthe sex processing model of Johnson and Tassinary (2005), is that perceptual impairments are driven\nprimarily by the impacts of inversion on kinematic, not structural, processing. While they note in their\npaper that inversion effects manifest with respect to multiple perceptual tasks, the paradigm via which\nthey provide empirical support for their model focuses specifically on a direction discrimination task.\nThe question arises whether the impact of inversion on kinematic processing will be observed in\nrelation to other discrimination tasks.\nExperiment 1 was designed specifically to address that question by asking observers to judge the\nsex of upright and inverted walkers. As already noted, Barclay et al. (1978) have previously demon-\nstrated sex discriminations are subject to an inversion effect, but here the mechanism giving rise to\nthose effects is unpacked. Specifically, the impact of inversion on structural and kinematic sex-cue\nprocessing was separately probed using two novel point-light continua. In the first, sex was differ-\nentiated only by structural cues. Kinematic cues did not distinguish between walkers. In the second\ncontinuum, the opposite was true: Kinematic cues were the only reliable cues to sex because structural\ncues were constant. It was predicted that inversion of the point-light models would affect sex percep-\ntions based on kinematic cues, but not sex perceptions based on structural cues.\nFigure 1. Stimuli were created using structural and kinematic (path) information derived from models of point-\nlight walkers provided by Troje (2008). A. Each walker is composed of a set of point-lights at specific starting\ncoordinates (top figure) and then motion is imposed along a specific kinematic path (bottom figure). B. Those two\npieces of information can be separated to control for, in this example, structure while varying path. In both figures,\nthe structural information is consistent with a 0 model walker from Troje's original continuum. The top figure is\nthe 0 structural model paired with the 25 (female) model motion path. The bottom figure is the 0 structural model\npaired with the 15 (male) model motion path. C. In these figures, motion is held constant while structure is varied.\nThe top figure is the 25 structure paired with the 0 model motion path. The bottom figure is the 15 structure\npaired with the 0 model motion path. Inversion can be achieved by rotation of these figures through 180\u00b0.\nRole of kinematics in biological motion inversion effects 124\nMethods\nTwo different sets of 13 walkers were used here. In the first set, structural information varied: The\ncoordinates for each of the original 13 point-light walker models were paired, in every case, with\nkinematic information from the sex-neutral (0) walker model (structure varies, kinematics constant).\nIn the second set of walkers, structural cues to sex were held constant while kinematic cues varied:\nThe structural coordinates for the 0 walker were paired with the 13 different sets of path information\nfrom each of the original 13 models (structure constant, kinematics vary). For each of the models thus\nproduced, both upright and inverted exemplars were created. Two blocks of stimuli were presented\nsuch that the effects of structural and kinematic information could be tested separately. Each block\ncomprised 260 trials with order randomized (13 exemplars  2 orientations  10 repeats).\nResults\nFor each model tested, at each orientation, the mean proportion of \"male\" responses was calculated\nacross participants. Those data are illustrated in Figure 2. As that figure shows, when kinematic (path)\ninformation is held constant (panel A.), changing structural information about sex leads to systematic\nchanges in the proportion of times each model is judged as looking \"male\" and those changes are\nsimilar for both upright (solid line) and inverted (dashed line) walkers. Models with strong female\nstructural cues almost never are judged as looking male. As the strength of the male structural cues\nincreases, so do the proportions of times the models are judged as male at both orientations. That pat-\ntern is not replicated when holding structural cues constant. Varying the kinematic information about\nsex (panel B.) leads to a similar pattern of change in the proportion of \"male\" responses when walkers\nare upright. However, that pattern changes when walkers are inverted. For inverted walkers with only\nkinematic cues signalling sex, the proportion of \"male\" responses initially increases as the strength\nof the cues to femaleness decrease. The function peaks for the weakest male models. As the strength\nof the male cues continues to increase, the proportions of times the inverted walkers are judged as\nmale systematically declines. That is, when information about sex is carried only by kinematic cues,\ninverted male walkers look increasingly female as cues to maleness increase.\nPlanned contrasts were run to test for a main effect of orientation on each of the two different\nmodel sets. Dealing first with the \"Structure\" condition, orientation had no effect on perceived sex\n= 0.31, p = .59). Conversely, and as predicted, orientation did have a systematic impact when\nwalker sex was defined by kinematics (F1,13\nmodel (neutral structural cues to sex paired with strong kinematic cues) was judged as female at a rate\nalmost at chance (t13\nFigure 2. Proportion of \"male\" responses for each model at each orientation tested. The two components\ncomprising each walker are shown on the abscissa. Mean proportions are shown on the ordinate. A. Holding\nkinematic cues constant and varying structural cues to sex leads to predictable and systematic changes in the\nperceived sex of the 13 different walkers tested.As sex cues change systematically from extreme female structure\n(26/0 model) to extreme male structure (16/0 model), the proportions of \"male\" judgements increases for both\nupright (solid line) and inverted (dashed line) walkers. B. Holding structure constant and varying kinematic cues\nto sex gives a different result. In this case, inversion leads to the weakest male walkers (0/0, 0/11, 0/12, 0/13)\nlooking most male. Inversion reduces the perceived maleness of the most extreme male (0/14, 0/15, 0/16)\nwalkers. Error bars represent 1 standard error.\n125 Fitzgerald S-A, Brooks A, van der Zwan R, Blair D\nAnother way of representing those data are shown in Figure 3. For each participant, a differ-\nence score was calculated by subtracting the proportion of \"male\" responses for each upright model\nfrom the proportion of \"male\" responses for each inverted model. 95% confidence intervals were then\nconstructed for each set of models. As shown in Figure 3, structural cues (blue) to sex were almost\nunaffected by orientation: Almost every interval captures 0. The pattern is very different for kinematic\n(red) cues. As maleness increases, there is a systematic decline in the difference scores, consistent with\ninverted walkers looking increasingly female.\nConclusion\nResults of Experiment 1 support the hypothesis that inversion significantly affects sex perceptions\nbased on kinematic cues but not sex perceptions based on structural cues. In particular, and as illus-\ntrated in Figures 2 & 3, inversion has little effect on sex perceptions generated by point-light models\nvarying only in structural sex cues. Models with strong female cues are perceived as female, models\nwith strong male cues are perceived as male. That pattern changes when sex cues are carried by\nkinematic information. In that case, and just as when structure carries sex information, upright walk-\ners are reliably discriminated as female and male in a pattern consistent with the kinematic sex-cue\ninformation carried in each walker. When those walkers are inverted, female walkers generally are\nperceived as female. Male walkers with weak sex cues are perceived as male. However, as male sex\ncues increase in strength, walkers increasingly are perceived as female.\nAs such, present data tie together two key biological motion processing models. First, the present\ndata suggest that of the two processing streams (Troje & Westhoff, 2006) contributing to perceptions\nof the sex of point-light walkers, the kinematic is more detrimentally affected by inversion than is the\nstructural. Those effects could be mediated via an orientation-tuned disruption to match with the stored\ntemplates (see Troje & Westhoff, 2006). That is consistent too with Johnson and Tassinary's (2005)\nsex processing-specific model. Johnson and Tassinary argue that structure-based discriminations are\nmore robust to the detrimental impacts of inversion than are discriminations based on kinematic cues.\nThe results reported here are consistent with their proposal that structure serves as the primary, direct,\nand therefore more inversion-resilient cue to sex, while kinematics play a secondary role that is more\nsusceptible to inversion effects.\nFigure 3. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) for difference scores for each model set. For each participant, a\ndifference score was calculated by subtracting for each model tested their proportion of \"male\" responses to\nupright walkers from their proportion to inverted walkers. 95% CIs were then constructed for each model. A score\nof 0 means there were no differences between performances on upright and inverted walkers. Positive scores\nindicated inverted walkers look more male. Negative scores indicated inverted walkers look more female. The\nblue interval is for models where the sex cue is carried by structural cues. The red interval is for models where the\nsex cue is carried by kinematic cues. Models are shown on the colored labels on the abscissa.\nRole of kinematics in biological motion inversion effects 126\nThese data are not without precedent. Barclay et al. (1978) has previously reported that observers\nreliably reported upside down male point-light walkers as female and vice versa for female walkers.\nWhile the present findings support only the first of those two outcomes, they are to our knowledge\nthe first reported replication of Barclay et al.'s physical inversion/sex inversion relationship. Those\ndifferences may be associated with the effects of signal strength observed in these data. Quite clearly\nsex discriminations were most disrupted for those inverted walkers defined by strong male kinemat-\nics. Those walkers, like Barclay's, were perceived as female when inverted, suggesting perhaps that\nat least for the male walkers used by Barclay, structural cues were not salient and their observers used\nkinematic information to make their sex discriminations. That account cannot explain why Barclay's\nfemale walkers were judged by observers to be male.\nIn summary, data from Experiment 1 support the proposal that inversion has a greater detrimental\nimpact on the processing of kinematic cues than it does on the processing of structural cues to sex.\nMost importantly, in that respect, these data are consistent with Troje and Westhoff's (2006) suggestion\nthat inversion effects are driven by a disruption to kinematic processing ahead of structure process-\ning, and with Johnson and Tassinary's (2005) sex processing-specific model in which structure is the\nprimary cue to sex. That summary is based on a unique feature of the data reported here: Observers\nbased their sex discriminations on either kinematic or structural cues. The question thus arises whether\ncompatible patterns of responding would manifest for point-light walkers in which both carriers simul-\ntaneously were available. That is, if walkers varied in terms of both their structural and their kinematic\ncues to sex would the same effects be observed? That question is addressed by Experiment 2.\nIn Experiment 1, the advantage of the methodological approach adopted was that it afforded the ability\nto isolate the inversion effects arising with respect to kinematic and structural processing individually.\nAs noted above, that approach also has associated with it some limitations: In regular point-light\nwalkers, sex typically is conveyed by the dual cues of structure and kinematics simultaneously. So,\nwhile data from Experiment 1 are consistent with the view that inversion has a more catastrophic\nimpact upon the observer's ability to exploit kinematic than structural cues to sex, at least for male\nwalkers, the question does arise as to whether such effects would be maintained when both carriers\nsimultaneously are available.\nTo that end, Experiment 2 was conducted to test the impact of inversion on perceptions of point-\nlight walkers comprised simultaneously of structural and kinematic cues to sex. Specifically, two\nobjectively sex-structured walkers (structure levels 21 female and 11 male) were paired with both\nfemale and male kinematic cues in combinations that were either complementary (female/female) or\ncontradictory (male/female) in terms of sex cues. In Experiment 2a, combinations comprised female\nand male structural walkers onto which seven different levels of female kinematic cues were imposed.\nIn Experiment 2b, the combinations comprised seven levels of male kinematics. Upright and inverted\nversions of each stimulus set were created.\nUsing those stimuli, and based on the data from Experiment 1, it was predicted that inversion\neffects would manifest only on walkers with male kinematics. In particular, it was predicted that\nsystematically different performances for upright and inverted walkers would not manifest in sex dis-\ncriminations for the stimuli used in Experiment 2a (where both female and male structures had female\nkinematics). It was predicted that differences between performances on upright and inverted walkers\nwould be observed in Experiment 2b (where both female and male structures had male kinematics).\nA secondary aim was to investigate the tuning of structure-based supremacy in driving perceptual\noutcomes. Put simply, we tested the effect of signal strength on perceptual outcomes for each type of\nwalker in each of the orientations in which they were presented.\nExperiment 2a: Female kinematics\nThe aim of Experiment 2a was to test the impact of inversion on sex discriminations of point-light\nwalkers in which the structural cues were female or were male and the kinematic cues all female.\nBased on the data from Experiment 1, it was predicted that, if inversion effects are driven by kinematic\nrather than structural cues, there would be no systematic effects of inversion on sex discriminations\nfor female and male structural point-light walkers when those were paired with female kinematics.\n127 Fitzgerald S-A, Brooks A, van der Zwan R, Blair D\nMethods\nMethods were as described above with the following changes: Two different sets of structural coordi-\nnates, those of the 21 (female) model and those of the 11 (male) model had paired with them seven\ndifferent kinematic models, each carrying female sex cues of different strengths: 26, 25, 24, 23, 22,\n21, & 0. For each of those 14 models, an upright and an inverted version was created and the stimuli pre-\nsented as a single randomized block comprised 280 trials (14 exemplars  2 orientations  10 repeats).\nResults\nAs previously, results here are expressed as mean proportions of male responses across participants\nfor each structure/kinematic sex cue combination--Figure 4. Proportions less than 0.5 are consistent\nwith systematically \"female\" responses, proportions greater than 0.5 are consistent with systemati-\ncally \"male\" responses. Female kinematic cues are represented along the x-axis from strongest on the\nleft to weakest on the right (so in decreasing strength of female sex cue). As can be seen in Figure 4,\nwhen female kinematic cues were paired with a female structural cue, point-light walkers look female\nwhen the kinematic cues to sex are strong and look increasingly male as the strength of the female\nkinematic cues diminish. That pattern of discriminations is consistent for both upright and inverted\nwalkers although it does appear, for the strongest kinematic cues, that inversion reduces the salience\nof the female cues to sex (see General Discussion). When female kinematic cues are paired with a\nmale structural cue, the point-light walkers look more male as the female kinematic cues weaken in\nstrength. Indeed, only when female kinematics were imposed on the objectively female (21) structure\ndid participants reliably report the walkers as looking female. When paired with the objectively male\nstructure (11), even the strongest female kinematic cue (26) did not give rise to perceptions that\nreliably were female: A post hoc t-test on the proportion of \"male\" responses for the 11/26 model\nshowed the rate of responding not to be different from 0.5 (t13\nall these data, there seems to be no systematic effect of stimulus inversion.\nPlanned orthogonal contrasts tested the main effects of orientation (upright vs inverted walkers)\nand kinematic sex cue signal strength. As predicted, no main effect of orientation was observed for\neither the objectively female (21) structure (F1,13\n= 0.67, p = .43). That is, no systematic effect of orientation was observed for either set of\ncombinations when the kinematic sex signal was female. The strength of the female kinematic cues did\ninfluence perceptions: Perceived sex changed systematically as a function of female kinematic signal\nstrength for both the female (F1,13\nsummary, there were no systematic effects of stimulus inversion on the perceived sex of structurally\nfemale and structurally male point-light walkers when those walkers carried female kinematic cues.\nExperiment 2b: Male kinematics\nThe aim of Experiment 2b was to test the impact of inversion on sex discriminations of point-light\nwalkers in which the structural cues were female or were male and the kinematic cues all male. Based\nFigure 4. A. Mean proportions of \"male\" responses for upright (solid line) and inverted (dashed line) point-light\nwalkers with female structure (21) imposed on female kinematics (26 to 0).

That is, female (21) and male (11)\nResults\nUsing the previous conventions, Figure 5 shows the mean sex discrimination performances for the\nstimuli tested here. The patterns of responding are very different from Experiment 2a: There is little\neffect of male kinematic sex cues strength, except when those were paired with the female structural\ncues. That is likely to be a ceiling effect. All the upright walkers tested here were very often perceived\nto be male. There was a strong and systematic effect of inversion and that effect was impacted by the\nstrength of the male kinematic sex cue. In particular, inversion systematically reduced the proportions\nof times every stimulus tested was perceived to be male.\nThe main effect of orientation was significant for both the objectively female-structured walkers\nboth cases, the proportion of \"male\" discriminations was significantly reduced by inversion, suggest-\ning inversion made the walkers look more female. Male kinematic sex cue strength had no systematic\neffect on sex discrimination performances for upright walkers with female (F1,13\n= 0.1, p = .76) structures. Similarly, male kinematic sex cue strength had no effect on\nsex discrimination performances for inverted male structures (F1,13\nkinematics significantly affected performance when paired with female structure (F1,13\nSpecifically, and as in Experiment 1, stronger male kinematics, when presented upside down, looked\nless \"male\", although even for the combination of female structure with the strongest male kinematic\nsex cue the walkers never were reliably reported as looking female (t13\nand as predicted, when point-light walkers carry male kinematic cues to sex, inversion affects sex\nperceptions and does so when combined with both female and male structural cues.\nConclusion\nExperiment 2 had two primary aims. Experiment 2a was designed to test the impact of female kin-\nematics on sex discriminations of point-light walkers in which the structural cues were female or\nwere male. Experiment 2b was designed to test, on the same structural cues, the impact of inversion\non perceptions driven by male kinematic sex cues. It was predicted that systematic inversion effects\nwould be seen only for walkers with male kinematics. The data confirm that prediction. While sex dis-\ncriminations of walkers containing only female kinematic cues to sex were mediated by the strength of\n129 Fitzgerald S-A, Brooks A, van der Zwan R, Blair D\nthose cues, there were no systematic differences in those effects produced by inversion. In comparison,\nsex discriminations of walkers containing only male kinematic cues showed only weak tuning for the\nstrength of the cues (probably a ceiling effect) but strong effects of inversion. For every stimulus, the\nproportion of \"male\" responses elicited was reduced when the stimulus was inverted. In summary,\nExperiment 2 confirms that inversion effects are mediated by the effect of the change of orientation on\nthe processing of kinematic sex cues when those cues are male. In addition, Experiment 2 shows that\nthose effects on kinematic processes are, for the structural configurations used here, independent of the\nsex of the structural cues presented with them.\nWith that in mind, data from Experiments 2a and 2b provide further confirmation of the models of\nbiological motion processing described by Troje and Westhoff (2006) and by Johnson and Tassinary\n(2005). Troje and Westhoff proposed that the inversion effect is due primarily to impairments, when\nfigures are upside down, of the visual system's ability to interpret task-relevant kinematics. In terms of\nsex discriminations, the data reported here confirm a critical role for kinematics in inversion effects.\nSimilarly, these data are consistent with Johnson and Tassinary's proposal that sex perceptions are\ndriven directly by structural cues--a process these data suggest is not orientation-tuned--and indi-\nrectly by kinematic cues. These data suggest that kinematic signals can systematically influence sex\nperception, but only in a secondary relationship to more heavily weighted structural information.\n5 General Discussion\nThis study was designed to investigate the mechanisms mediating inversion effects on biological\nmotion perceptions. As noted above, traditional accounts of the mechanisms of those effects have\nfocused on the impact of orientation changes on structural processing mechanisms (Bertenthal &\nsentation upside down, it classically has been argued, catastrophically impacts upon the visual sys-\ntem's ability to exploit learned structural relationships and that, in turn, impacts on myriad perceptual\nare not limited to, discriminations of biological sex (Barclay et al., 1978). More recently, however,\nthe explanatory power of the so-called \"shape inversion effect\" has been called into question (Troje\n& Westhoff, 2006). At least in the case of biological motion processing, there is reason to believe\nthe impacts on perception resulting from physical inversion may arise primarily as a consequence of\nresulting distortions in the visual system's ability to process kinematic information (Troje & Westhoff,\n2006). What is interesting about that proposal is that Johnson and Tassinary (2005) also developed an\naccount of biological motion processing, this time for the mechanisms giving rise to sex perceptions\nspecifically, that holds that sex perceptions arise primarily through structural processing. They propose\nthat kinematic sex cues play a secondary role. In terms of inversion effects--turning their hypothesis\non its head, so to speak--their model predicts that the weaker driver of sex perceptions, kinematics,\nwill, when processing cues changed by orientation, be more deleteriously impacted than structural\ncues. That is, both models predict that sex perceptions mediated by structural cues will be more robust\nto orientation changes than sex perceptions mediated by kinematic cues.\nThe primary goal of the experiments reported here was to test that prediction. In Experiment 1,\nparticipants judged the sex of point-light walkers composed of independent structural and kinematic\ncues to sex. Sex cues were carried either by structural or by kinematic cues. The only systematic\neffects of inversion were observed for kinematic cues, and only for male kinematic cues. In those\ncircumstances, the proportions of times walkers were judged to be male were reduced. The goal of\nExperiment 2 was to further test that relationship between orientation, structural cues, and kinematics.\nIn Experiment 2, kinematic sex cues were paired with objective female or male structural cues. The\ndata confirmed that orientation not only selectively impacts on the processing of kinematic cues, and\nthat those effects are specific to male kinematics, but that those effects occur relatively independently\nof the structural cues that are present. In addition to that, signal strength did not, in the case of male\nkinematics at least, have an across-the-board impact--only for the inverted female-structured walkers\ndid greater signal strength result in reduced male responses. No similar tuning effects were observed\nwhen male kinematics were paired with either female or male structures. In summary, the data are\nevidence that kinematic signals can influence sex perceptions even when sex-specific structural cues\nare available: while structural cues are primary when walkers are right side up, kinematic signals can\ndrive perceptions when those same walkers are presented upside down.\nRole of kinematics in biological motion inversion effects 130\nIn addition to those systematic effects, there were a number of point-light walker models that seem\nto give rise to different patterns of responding depending on their orientation. In Experiment 1, the pro-\nportions of \"male\" responses for the most sexually ambiguous models (using the structure/kinematic\nconvention), the 0/0 and 1/0 models, were lower than might be expected given the systematic changes\nacross the rest of the models. Similarly, in Experiment 2a, two models, 21/26 and 21/25, generated\nhigher than expected proportions of \"male\" responses. In neither case is it clear why given the overall,\nand systematic, changes across all the point-light walker models. One possible interpretation of those\npatterns is that they reflect processes first described by Barclay et al. (1978). In that first description of\npoint-light walker inversion effects, Barclay's observers reported that turning the walkers upside down\nseemed to change their sex. The same is true here: For those four models that seem \"out of pattern,\"\nthere is a tendency for observers more often to perceive the models as being of the opposite sex to the\nobjective cues present when the cues are presented upside down. Whether those reports reflect a true\nperceptual reversal of the perceived sex, or perhaps a response bias (\"it does not look female so it must\nbe male\") requires further investigation.\nThe other effect that manifests in these data is the so-called \"male bias.\" Here, for both the structure\n(upright and inverted) and kinematics (upright only) continua, point-light walkers that actually carried\nweak female cues were misperceived as male. The male bias previously has been reported to manifest\nnot only for point-light walkers (Troje, Sadr, Geyer, & Nakayama, 2006; Troje & Szabo, 2006), but\nalso for hands (Gaetano, Brooks, & van der Zwan, 2012; Gaetano, Brooks, van der Zwan, Hayward, &\nOxner, 2013; Gaetano, van der Zwan, Blair, & Brooks, 2014), and for faces (Hess, Adams, Grammer,\n& Kleck, 2009). That it manifests here in both conditions suggests that for point-light walkers at least,\nthe bias is driven by both structure and kinematics processing mechanisms. Again, the mechanisms\nmediating that effect need systematic investigation.\nWhile the outcomes reported here support the major existing models, they also give rise to at least\none important additional question: Why does inversion selectively disrupt the processing of kinematics\ncharacteristic of males, to the point where in some cases sex is reliably misperceived (Experiment 1,\nsupported by patterns in Experiment 2)? While physical/perceptual inversion relationships have previ-\nously been reported (Barclay et al., 1978), our data suggest they arise specifically in cases involving\nmale kinematics. Because the effect arose with respect to two types of point-light walkers--one in\nwhich sex was defined by a single carrier (Experiment 1), and a second in which dual carriers were\npresent (Experiment 2)--the effect seems unlikely to be a stimulus-based artifact. But the question of\nwhy the visual system is particularly susceptible to the effects of inverting male kinematics or perhaps\nconversely, why characteristically female motion shows no comparable effect, remains unanswered.\nData from both orientations tested here show that the presence of female kinematics is factored into\nresulting sex perceptions. So, we know at least that the absence of an orientation effect with respect\nto female kinematics cannot be based on a complete reliance when processing those walkers on their\nsex-specific structural cues.\nOverall then, the present data provide novel insight into an effect that has for many years interested\npsychophysicists and laypeople alike. Inversion, as we know from demonstrations like the Thatcher\nIllusion (Thompson, 1980) and the artistry of a pencil-nosed puppet, has a serious negative impact on\nthe ability to process visual information, including in the case of human body representations. Here,\nwe have shown that that impact is caused in large part by impairment of kinematic processing abilities.\nSimultaneously, our data show that kinematics do nonetheless feature into judgements of sex, even\nwhen structural information is available. As such, we provide support for the complimentary--with\nrespect at least to inverted-figure processing--models proposed by Troje and Westhoff (2006) and\nJohnson and Tassinary (2005). Taken together, their models and our data suggest that in the case of\nbiological motion processing structural and kinematic cues contribute hierarchically to sex percep-\ntions. Specifically, mechanisms processing structural cues are relatively robust to inversion. Mecha-\nnisms processing kinematic cues are not.\n"
