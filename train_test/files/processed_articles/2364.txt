The method was tested by using the 2005 assault data from\n121 jurisdictions in Virginia as a test case. The analyses of these data show that some different crime types are correlated and some\ndifferent crime parameters are correlated with different crime types. The analyses also show that certain jurisdictions within Virginia\nshare certain crime patterns. This information assists with constructing a pattern for a specific crime type and can be used to\ndetermine whether a jurisdiction may be more likely to see this type of crime occur in their area.\n1. Introduction\nThe National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is\na crime reporting program for local, state, and federal law\nenforcement agencies that provides a wealth of incident level\ndata for use in analysis. It is part of the Uniform Crime\nReporting (UCR) Program which is administered by the FBI.\nThe UCR Program provides a nationwide view of crime based\non data submitted through state programs or directly to the\nnational UCR Program and has been operational for around\nmeet law enforcement need for the 21st century. This vast\nsystem houses information on offenses, victims, offenders,\nproperty, and persons arrested, as well as the incident itself.\nThe data of NIBRS are well structured and readily available\nfor researchers and law enforcement agencies to assist with\nunderstanding the intricate nature of crime.\nAkiyama and Nolan [1] outlined the structure of the\nNIBRS data set and provided methods for understanding\nand analyzing the data. Dunn and Zelenock [2] also describe\nand test procedures to facilitate the use of this vast system.\nBuilding on these initial works, many authors continue\nto investigate how this storehouse of data can be turned\ninto useful information for researchers and law enforcement\nagencies. Much of the work employs descriptive statistics\napplied in various sophisticated ways to extract information\nfrom the files. For example, Thompson et al. [3] apply\ndescriptive statistics to examine intimate partner violence\nand make connections between this crime and other crimes\nthat occurred in the same incident. They were able to show\na link between intimidation and more serious violent crimes\nand extract information about the relationships between the\nvictim and the offender from the NIRBS data that helps\nto better understand this type of crime. Snyder [4] used\nlogistic regression techniques to predict the arrest of juvenile\nrobbery offenders. More recently, Addington and Rennison\n[5] used logistic regression models along with the NIBRS and\nthe National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data for\npredicting rape cooccurrence to provide a critical initial look\nat rapes that occur with other crimes.\nFor criminologists the NIBRS data holds the answers\nto many long-standing questions about crime, criminal\noffending, and crime victimization. However, gaining access\nto some of these answers has remained difficult because of\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\ne Scientific World Journal\n2 The Scientific World Journal\nthe size and complexity of the data. Effective techniques,\nsuch as data mining and clustering, for criminal justice data\nare of increasing importance to both the research and law\nenforcement communities [6]. In recent years, clustering\ncategorical data has gained more importance because it is one\nof the fundamental methods in data mining [7]. Clustering\ncrime data, as with other categorical data, is unsupervised\nlearning that aims at partitioning a data set into groups of\nsimilar items. The goal is to create clusters of data objects\nwhere the within-cluster similarity is maximized and the\nbetween-cluster similarity is minimized. Over the years,\nmany clustering algorithms have been developed and tested.\nSome clustering techniques have developed specifically for\nuse with categorical data. Abdu [8] presented three new\nclustering algorithms that were applied to the clustering of the\nNIBRS data. Two of his approaches combine spectral analysis\nand clustering techniques that are scalable to large data sets\nsuch as the NIBRS.\nClustering categorical data poses a challenge not encoun-\ntered in clustering numerical data because the attribute\ncategories are not ordered and defining a metric with which\nto measure the distance between data objects in a data\nset becomes a challenge. Many of the algorithms that have\nemerged for clustering categorical data rely on the occur-\nrence/cooccurrence frequencies of attribute values in the\ndata set to determine clusters of similar data objects. The\nbasic goal is to choose a set of attribute categories that\nprovide a summary of the data objects in a cluster. There are\na wide range of clustering algorithms for categorical data,\nincluding K-modes [9], STIRR [10], CACTUS [11], ROCK\ngood summary can be found in [8]. The clustering algorithm\nused in this research is a mathematically well-defined model\nimplemented in a polynomial time algorithm that guarantees\nan optimal solution [16].\nDue to the lack of well-defined mathematical models\nand optimization goals, most existing graph theory clustering\napproaches could not guarantee a proper clustering result in\ngeneral cases. For example, agglomerative hierarchical clus-\ntering methods could not produce proper clusters with larger\nsizes, while divisive hierarchical methods could not produce\nclusters with smaller sizes, and clusters with large difference\nin their sizes and k-core method may produce clusters with\nsmall edge-cuts, and so forth. Many papers and articles have\nmentioned these problems and frustration among users (e.g.,\nsee [17\u00ad19]). Even the most popular commercial software,\nSAS, is unable to produce proper outputs for some simple\ndata.\nThe purpose of this paper is to present a novel multidi-\nmensional clustering method for the NIBRS data. We firstly\noutlines a new measure, called the likelihood index, that helps\nexamine quantitatively how likely a crime is to occur in a\nparticular jurisdiction. This measure compares a vector that\ndescribes a jurisdiction with a vector that represents a crime\ntype. Then according to the defined distance between these\ntwo vectors, we can determine how closely the jurisdiction\naligns with that crime type. The data used in this study\nwere obtained from the 2005 NIBRS which is stored at the\nNational Archive for Criminal Justice Data at the University\nTable 1: NIBRS indexes used.\nSegment Index\nNumber of\nsubindexes\nVictim indexes\nType of victim 3\nVictim age 3\nVictim sex 2\nVictim race 5\nVictim ethnicity 3\nVictim residence status 3\nAggravated assault/homicide\ncircumstances\nType of injury 6\nOffender indexes\nOffender age 3\nOffender sex 3\nOffender race 5\nAdditional\nindexes\nJuvenile 1\nViolent crime 1\nMultiple victims 1\nMultiple offenders 1\nMultiple offenders and victims 1\nMultiple offenders and one\nvictim\nOne offender and multiple\nvictims\nOne offender and one victims 1\nof Michigan. This work explores the following research\nquestions. Do specific crimes exhibit certain quantifiable\ncharacteristics? Do different types of crimes share similar\nquantifiable characteristics? Do jurisdictions of a state cluster\nwith respect to different crime types? What is the likelihood\nthat if one type of crime is occurring in an area, other types of\ncrime with similar quantifiable characteristic will also occur\nin that area?\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2\nwe summarize the data unit of analysis and preparation. In\nSection 3 we introduce the methods to deal with the data\nmatrix and take Virginia as a case study. Section 4 provides\nsome additional results and Section 5 gives the conclusions\nof the research.\n2. Data Unit of Analysis and Preparation\nThe data sets available in the NIBRS provide a wealth\nof incident level data about each reported crime. As for\nmassive data set. The data and tools are made available by\nUniversity of Michigan for use by law enforcement agencies\nand researchers. In order to devise a manageable set of data\nfor preliminary testing of techniques and for preliminary data\nanalysis, only the 2005 data on assaults were explored. From\nThe Scientific World Journal 3\nVirginia were selected for examination. These represent all\njurisdictions within Virginia with populations greater than\nchosen jurisdictions.\nFor this study, 21 indexes from the NIBRS were chosen\nfrom the 246 available indexes. These 21 indexes were deemed\nimportant to provide the relevant characteristics of the vic-\ntim(s), offender(s), and the circumstances of each incident.\nThe selected particular indexes were listed in Table 1.\nIn order to facilitate the selected analysis techniques, the\ndata was expanded from one column, with many possible\nentries, to multi columns that contained zero or one. For\nexample, the Offender Segment index contains the sex of\nthe offender and has the possible entries of male, female, or\nunknown. This index column was split into three individual\ncolumns where an entry in the three columns of (1 0 0) means\nturns the column for sex of the offender to three columns. All\ncreated columns were binary (0/1) columns that were used\nto help classify the characteristics of the incident. From the\nexpansion of the original 21 indexes, 57 binary columns were\ncreated. This led to the creation of a 121 \u00d7 57 Crime Data\nMatrix, where each row  represents the th jurisdiction and\neach column  represents the th parameter related to the\nincident (e.g., offender sex, victim resident status) or a crime\ntype (e.g., hate crime, drug dealing). The Crime Data Matrix\nconstruction is pictured below:\nCrime Data Matrix =\n[\n[\n[\n.\n.\n. d\n.\n.\n.\n]\n]\n]\nwhere ,\nis the entry of the th crime index from the th\njurisdiction.\nNormalization of the rows of the matrix was completed by\ndividing each row entry by the population of the jurisdiction.\nThis gave a per person rate for each crime parameter or each\ncrime type. Normalization of the columns was completed\nby averaging the columns and subtracting the average from\neach entry in the column. Then each entry in the column\nwas divided by the vector length of the column. Equation (2)\nshows these normalization step-by-step operations.\n,\n\nnumber of occurances of crime parameter or crime type\npopulation of the jurisdiction\n,\n,\n ,\n- \nwhere \nis the average of the th column,\n,\n\n,\n\nwhere \nis the vector length of the th column.\n3. Finding Patterns in the Data\nThis section explains several different analyses that were\nperformed on the data in the matrix described above in order\nto attempt to answer the research questions listed in Section 1.\nThese analyses include comparing the columns of the matrix\nto determine the correlation of crime parameters to crime\ntypes and to determine the correlation of different crime\ntypes. Also there were two analyses performed comparing the\nrow vectors to develop the likelihood index and to cluster the\njurisdictions by crime types.\n3.1. Correlation of Crime Parameters and Crime Types (Com-\nparing the Column Vectors). The motivation for comparing\nthe different crime parameters to crime types is to determine\nif there are some characteristics that can tell us about the\nlikelihood of a crime type to occur in a certain jurisdiction.\nEach crime type may have factors that contribute to a specific\ncrime appearing in a certain place. An overall increase in\ncrime in an area may or may not correlate to an increase in\nany one particular type of crime, say hate crime, in that area.\nHowever, there may be individual parameters whose increase\nmay indicate an increase in a particular type of crime. For\nexample, if juvenile offenders are up in a certain area, this\nmay indicate that hate crimes will also be up in that area.\nAlso crime type vectors were compared against each other\nin a similar way. For example, crimes like juvenile gang were\ncompared against hate crime to see if these crime types also\nhave a correlation.\nIn order to determine the relationship between the th\nparameter (th column of the Crime Data Matrix) and any\nother column (another parameter or another crime type), the\ncorrelation coefficient (cosine of the angle between the two\ncolumn vectors over the norm of the vectors) was calculated.\nEach of the columns of the crime data matrix forms a vector in\na 121-dimensional space and the vectors can be geometrically\ncompared, with the correlation between two parameters\nrepresented by the cosine of the angle in this space. For\nexample, the column for the juvenile offender could be\ncompared against the column for hate crime or the column\nfor hate crime can be compared to the column for gang-\nrelated crime. These comparisons are made by calculating the\nangle between these two columns to determine if there is any\nrelationship and how strong that relationship may be. This\nmethod can assist in determining whether two columns vary\ndirectly, inversely, or separately.\nFor this comparison of two column vectors, the variation\nin two vectors must be transformed to eliminate the effects\nof mean differences. Once the mean deviation is determined,\nthen the correlation can be determined by the cosine of\nthe angle between the vectors. As an example, let  =\n) be the column for juvenile offender and let\n4 The Scientific World Journal\nIndependent cities\n(1) Alexandria\n(2) Bedford\n(3) Bristol\n(4) Buena Vista\n(5) Charlottesville\n(6) Chesapeake\n(7) Clifton Forge\n(8) Colonial Heights\n(9) Covington\nFigure 1: The clustering results of 121 counties in Virginia according to hate crime.\n) be the column for the hate crime\nindicator. To find the correlation coefficient of this two\ncolumns calculate the following:\n\n= cos \n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe sign of the answer is ignored, since either a strong positive\nrelationship (close to 1 meaning that the two angles are in\nthe same direction and close to one another) or a strong\nnegative relationship (close to -1 meaning that the two angles\nare in opposite directions, but nearly opposite one another)\nindicates that the vectors appear to be related in some way.\nIn doing this comparison, with one vector fixed and\ncomparing it to all other vectors and itself, we form a\nrow vector of size 57. Consider the example that compares\nthe hate crime vector with all other vectors. We construct\nanother vector that we refer to as the Hate Crime Character\nVector of size 57, which contains all the cosine \n(the\ncorrelation coefficient of the th parameter with respect to\nhate crime). A new vector is formed from all these correlation\ncoefficients (1\n), where each of the 57 parameters\nhas a correlation coefficient vector associated with it. Now\nconsider the corresponding components in the Hate Crime\nCharacter Vector. Table 2 tells us how hate crimes are related\nto aggravated assault crimes. Among those crimes, juvenile\ngang (0.4058) has higher correlation with hate crime, while\nthe others, for example, argument (0.1325) and drug dealing\nTable 3 also shows similar evidence that for victim's age,\nthe age group less than 18 is also more correlated to hate crime\nthan the other two age groups. Many such comparisons can\nbe observed using these correlation coefficient vectors.\n3.2. Analyses of Jurisdictions (Comparing the Row Vectors).\nBy using the correlation coefficients, a 57-dimensional vector,\ntwo data analyses can be performed, each of which indicates\nthe likelihood of a particular crime for each jurisdiction.\nThe first one is a numerical index, called the likelihood index\nassigned to each of the 112 jurisdictions. The second one is\na clustering analysis of all jurisdictions. Jurisdictions with\nsimilar recorded crime patterns (adjusted corresponding to\ncorrelation coefficients) form clusters.\n} be the likelihood index vector\nwhere \nis the likelihood index between jurisdiction  and a\nparticular crime (e.g., hate crime) or crime parameter (e.g.,\njuvenile offender). For this comparison of two row vectors,\nthe variation in two vectors must be transformed to eliminate\nthe effects of mean differences. Once the mean deviation is\ndetermined, then the correlation can be determined by the\ncosine of the angle between the vectors. As an example, let  =\n) be the row for the Norfolk jurisdiction and let\n) be the row for the hate crime indicator. To\nfind the correlation coefficient of these two rows calculate the\nfollowing:\n\n= cos \n=\n\n\n\n \nTable 4 gives the top 30 jurisdictions of Virginia with respect\nto the hate crime likelihood index and also provides the data\non the clustering of the jurisdictions discussed in the next\nsection.\nThe Scientific World Journal 5\nTable 2: Hate crime correlation coefficient vector values for other\ncrimes.\nCrime type\nHate crime correlation\ncoefficient (\n)\nGangland (organized crime\ninvolvement)\nTable 3: Hate crime correlation coefficients for age of victim.\nAge of victim Hate crime correlation coefficient (\n)\n3.3. Using the Correlation Coefficients to Cluster the Jurisdic-\ntions. To begin the clustering, a weighted complete graph\nwith 121 vertices is formed. The weight on each edge is the\ncorrelation coefficient between the jurisdictions. The novel\ngraph theory clustering method we proposed in [20] is used\nto find all the dense (highly weighted) subgraphs of the\ncomplete graph. A distinguished feature of this method,\nnonbinary hierarchical tree, clearly highlights meaningful\nclusters which significantly reduces further manual efforts for\ncluster selections. The results of clustering the jurisdictions\nwith respect to hate crimes are also displayed in Figure 1 and\nIt can be seen that of the top 30 jurisdictions with respect\nto hate crimes, 12 of the top 15 are in Cluster A and the others\nare in Cluster B. The remaining 91 jurisdictions also fall into\nCluster B. The 12 higher hate crime rate counties (cities) are\nshowed in Figure 1 (in red and blue).\n4. Additional Results\nSimilar analyses where performed with respect to other crime\ntypes: drug-dealing, juvenile gang, and gangland (organized\ncrime involvement). The results are summarized in Tables 5\u00ad\nTable 6 summarizes the drug dealing vector comparison\nwith the offender parameter vectors.\nTables 5 and 6 summarize the comparison of the drug\ndealing vector with other crime parameter vectors. Each of\nthe other crime parameters related to the victim and the\noffender was compared to the drug dealing vector. A high\nvalue for this correlation coefficient implies that there is a\ncorrelation between this crime parameter and drug dealing.\nAgain, the motivation for comparing the different crime\nparameters to crime types is an attempt to determine if there\nTable 4: Likelihood index and clustering for hate crime.\nName Cluster Hate crime\nlikelihood index\nare some characteristics that can tell us about the likelihood\nof a crime type to occur in a certain jurisdiction. For\nexample, the correlation between the drug dealing vector and\nindividual victim is 0.5789, which is much higher than the\ncorrelation between drug dealing and victim type business\nseem to imply that for jurisdictions where the individual vic-\ntim crimes are evident they may also have the likelihood for\ndrug dealing related crimes. The tables show the correlation\ncoefficient values: the correlation values in bold show a higher\ncorrelation with the drug dealing crime type than the other\nparameters in that category.\nTable 7 summarizes the drug dealing vector comparison\nwith the other crime types.

The methods investigated in this research yielded\npromising preliminary results. The methods were applied\nonly to the assault data from 2005 but can easily be extended\nto other crime types and to other years to validate these results\nand also provide longitudinal investigation.\nThe comparison between the crime type vector and the\nindividual parameters vectors helped in two cases (hate\ncrimes and drug dealing) to determine which factors was\nmore related to those crimes. The different types of analyses\nthat were conducted on the jurisdictions helped to validate\none another. The likelihood index looked at whether a certain\ncrime pattern existed in that jurisdiction, while the clustering\n8 The Scientific World Journal\nmethod sought to cluster all the jurisdictions based on the\ncrime patterns of that jurisdiction. This information could be\nuseful to assist law enforcement agencies or policy makers\nin determining which jurisdictions share common challenges\nthat could possibly be addressed through cooperation and\nsharing resources between jurisdictions.\nThe next steps would be to utilize this same approach for\ndata from other states or perhaps a larger region to examine\nif the same information is observed from the analyses. It will\nbe interesting to see if Virginia data and other states have\nthe same patterns or if different patterns emerge. Further\nresearch and refinement of these methods should yield tools\nthat would provide researchers, law enforcement agencies,\nand government officials with a means to find patterns of\ndifferent crime types and possibly identify jurisdictions that\nmay be likely to experience that type of crime.\nConflict of Interests\nPeixin Zhao, Marjorie Darrah, Jim Nolan, and Cun-Quan\nZhang certify that there is no actual or potential conflict of\ninterests in relation to this paper.\n"
