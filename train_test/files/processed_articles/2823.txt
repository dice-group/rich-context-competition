An important role is hereby assigned to the credit channel of monetary policy\ntransmission that emphasizes the monetary policy response of bank lending. Existing studies\non the bank lending effects of monetary policy in Germany assume that industry-specific bank\ncredit growth does not differ between industries. In our view, however, a distinction of bank\nlending by industry is important since cyclical and structural differences between industries\nhave a potentially strong effect on bank credit growth. The present paper shows that such\n'industry effects' primarily reflect bank credit demand effects. Using the industry dimension\nof microeconomic bank lending data and information on the industry composition of bank\ncredit portfolios, the present paper investigates the sensitivity of bank lending to changes in\nbank credit demand and monetary policy in Germany.\nIn order to determine the sensitivity of bank lending to changes in bank credit demand and\nmonetary policy, we specify dynamic panel data models along the lines suggested in Ehrmann\nand 5 banking groups. The banking group and industry dimension of the data permits the\nidentification of bank lending effects, which result from banking group specific differences in\nthe industry composition of bank credit portfolios.\nThe empirical analysis shows that bank credit growth predominantly responds to changes\nin industry-specific factors. Strong effects arise from industry-specific output growth and\nindustry-specific inflation. Banking group effects are weak in comparison to industry effects.\nThe effect of monetary policy changes on industry-specific bank lending differs between in-\ndustries. The sensitivity of bank lending to changes in monetary policy hence depends on the\nstructure of bank credit portfolios.\nNicht-Technische Zusammenfassung\nIn Europa gibt es eine anhaltende Diskussion zu den Transmissionsmechanismen monet\u00a8\narer\nImpulse.

Both types of transmission\nchannels predict bank lending to change in response to monetary policy actions. While the\ndirection of the change is the same in the credit and interest rate view, the underlying reasons\ndiffer. The credit channel view explains monetary-policy-induced movements in bank lending\nwith changes in bank loan supply, whereas the interest rate channel stresses changes in bank\nloan demand. Apparently, the correlation of monetary policy shocks with loan demand and\nloan supply and the consequent role of interest rates as joint determinant of credit demand\nand credit supply precludes the unique identification of the interest rate and credit channel\neffects of monetary policy.\nIn order to identify the loan supply effects of monetary policy, empirical studies typically rely\non disaggregated macro- or microeconomic data. These illustrate the distributional effects of\nmonetary policy by stressing the within-group and between-group heterogeneity of banks in\nterms of asset size (e.g., Kashyap and Stein, 1995), liquidity (e.g., Kashyap and Stein, 2000),\nand capitalization (e.g., Peek and Rosengren, 1995). When stressing bank characteristics,\nthe identification of bank credit supply effects rests on several assumptions. Firstly, it is\nassumed that bank heterogeneity in bank size, liquidity, and capitalization reflects cross-bank\ndifferences in the severity of asymmetric information problems and consequently differences in\nthe ability of banks to offset monetary-policy-induced changes in deposits with other types of\nfinance. Cross-bank differences in bank characteristics are not allowed to reflect differences in\nbank customers. Secondly, the response of bank lending to changes in bank credit demand is\nassumed to be homogenous across all banks.2 Thirdly, banks are assumed to serve customers\n1Katharina Raabe (corresponding author): Universiteit Maastricht (FdEWB), Department of Eco-\nK.Raabe@algec.unimaas.nl.; Ivo J.M. Arnold: Universiteit Nyenrode, The Netherlands; Clemens J.M. Kool:\nUtrecht School of Economics, Universiteit Utrecht, The Netherlands. This research was conducted at the\nDeutsche Bundesbank. We would like to thank the banking and financial supervision department and the\nresearch centre of the Deutsche Bundesbank for their hospitality. We are also grateful to the statistics de-\npartment of the Deutsche Bundesbank for providing the bank level data and to Ingo Steinert for explanations\nregarding their structural pattern. We also want to thank Andreas Worms, Michael K\u00a8\notter, Stephanie Stolz,\nNatalja von Westernhagen, Thilo Liebig, Heinz Herrmann, and participants of the Deutsche Bundesbank sem-\ninar for interesting discussions and valuable comments. This paper represents the authors' personal opinions\nand does not necessarily reflect the views of the Deutsche Bundesbank.\n2For details see Deutsche Bundesbank (2001), Worms (2003) and the theoretical and empirical review on\nwhich do not differ in terms of bank credit demand. These are strong assumptions and their\npotential violation suggests the persistence of the identification problem.\nThe identification bias is likely to be particularly strong for Germany for two reasons. The\nfirst reason refers to the housebank principle in German banking. German banks belong\nto banking groups which confine their business to customers which differ in the degree of\nbank dependence: commercial banks are the housebank to large corporations and savings\nand cooperative banks are the housebanks to small- and medium-sized firms.3 Small firms\ntend to be more dependent on banks as source of external finance than large firms. The\ngreater bank dependence results from credit market imperfections, which are more severe\nfor small than for large firms given that reporting and accounting standards become more\nstringent with firm size. Credit market imperfections therefore cause the portfolio of savings\nand cooperative banks to be biased towards bank-dependent firms and that of commercial\nbanks to be biased towards firms with access to non-bank sources of finance (cf. Deutsche\nBundesbank, 1998a, 2002a). In view of these relationships, banking groups are likely to differ\nin the extent to which they (i) face changes in credit demand and (ii) adjust credit supply.\nThe second reason refers to the existence of pronounced cross-industry differences in credit\ndemand. The Deutsche Bundesbank (1996) attributes these to heterogeneities in the cycli-\ncal and structural characteristics of industries. The cyclicality of industry output affects the\nneed for external finance through its impact on the availability of internal funds of finance.\nCross-industry differences in bank credit demand reflect dissimilarities in the amplitude and\nfrequency of cyclical fluctuations and in the sensitivity of cash flows to cyclical demand\nchanges. Structural characteristics such as the degree of capital intensity, firm size distribu-\ntion, or openness to trade emphasize industry differences (i) in the costs of maintaining and\nexpanding production structures and (ii) in the severity of credit market imperfections as\nsource of differences in credit demand.\nExisting studies on the bank lending effects of monetary policy primarily assume that bank\ncredit demand does not differ between debtors in general and industries in particular. The un-\nderlying analyses involve the estimation of bank lending functions for the aggregate economy,\nwhere macroeconomic aggregates approximate credit demand.4 Although the macroeconomic\ndata are useful since they are available for long time periods at relatively high frequencies,\nthe underlying models only illustrate the bank lending effects of credit demand changes for\nthe average industry. Differences in credit demand across industries are ignored. In addition,\nmacroeconomic data do not control for possible differences in the monetary policy response\nthe bank lending effects of monetary policy in chapter 2. This is comparable to the credit channel assumption\nthat the interest rate sensitivity of credit demand does not depend on firm size.\n3See Elsas and Krahnen (2004) for evidence on the role of housebanks as source of finance for small and\nlarge firms in Germany.\nof industry-specific bank lending. The effectiveness of monetary policy is thus considered to\nbe independent of the industry structure of bank credit portfolios. Furthermore, most studies\ndo not account for possible cross-banking group differences in the response of bank lending to\nchanges in bank credit demand or monetary policy. Instead, they typically provide evidence\nfor an aggregate measure of all banks, disregarding cross-banking group effects.5\nIn our view, however, knowledge regarding the industry effects and banking group effects\nof bank lending is important as the results illustrate whether the effectiveness of monetary\npolicy depends on the industry composition of bank credit portfolios and on the institutional\nsetting of the banking system. The results may help to anticipate the effect of banking sector\nconsolidation and industry specialization on future monetary policy efficacy. This paper is\nmotivated by these considerations. We do not impose the assumption of homogenous bank\ncredit demand, but use the industry dimension of bank lending data to identify the response\nof bank credit supply to changes in industry-specific bank credit demand and monetary policy\nin Germany. We do not only compile evidence for the aggregate banking sector. Instead, we\ndistinguish the savings banking group and the sub-groups of the credit cooperative banking\nsector in order to identify the bank lending effects which are due to cross-banking group\ndifferences in the industry composition of bank credit portfolios. We hypothesize that in-\ndustries and banking groups determine the response of bank lending to changes in bank\ncredit demand and monetary policy. In particular, we argue that changes in bank lending are\nindustry-specific and that the industry composition of a bank's loan portfolio determines the\neffectiveness of monetary policy through credit channel effects.\nWe discuss two questions. Firstly, are changes in the industry-specific volume of bank credit\nexplained by bank lending effects of monetary policy or do they reflect changes in industry-\nspecific bank credit demand?6 Secondly, does the sensitivity of bank lending to changes in\nmonetary policy or bank credit demand differ between industries or between banking groups?\nWe address these problems for Germany using the Bundesbank database on bank lending and\nbank balance sheet information. The answer to these questions will show that industry bank\nlending predominantly responds to changes in industry bank credit demand rather than to\nmonetary policy changes. Furthermore, the results lend very strong support to the existence\nof industry effects of bank lending, whereas banking group effects are comparatively weak.\nEvidence in favor of credit channel effects of monetary policy crucially depends on the choice\nof industry and banking group. In view of these findings, we conclude that empirical studies\nwhich do not control for the industry structure of bank credit provide an incomplete view on\nthe bank lending effects of bank credit demand and monetary policy. The underlying results\n5The notable exceptions are K\u00a8\nin empirical studies for Germany.\n6Throughout this paper, we cannot control for the response of bank lending to monetary-policy-induced\nchanges in credit demand. However, to the extent that monetary policy affects industry output or industry\nprice only with a lag, changes in the volume of bank loans can still predominantly be attributed to changes\nin bank credit demand. Also see section 7 for additional caveats of the present empirical analysis.\nonly reflect the impact of the average industry. However, neglecting banking group effects is\nunlikely to affect the overall conclusions as to the determinants of bank lending.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing evidence on the credit\nchannel effects of monetary policy via bank lending in Germany. Section 3 describes the\nGerman banking industry. Within this framework, the discussion stresses the balance sheet\nstructure of the main banking groups and the industry structure of the corresponding loan\nportfolios. Section 4 discusses the empirical model and the empirical estimation strategy.\nSection 5 presents the industry and bank data and describes the bank outlier detection pro-\ncedure. Section 6 reports the empirical results from dynamic panel estimations and robustness\nchecks. We will ask whether differences in the response of bank lending to changes in bank\ncredit demand and monetary policy are explained by effects associated with banking groups\nor industries. We conclude in section 7.\n2 The Credit Channel Effects of Monetary Policy in Germany\nThis section reviews the existing empirical evidence on the bank lending effects of monetary\npolicy. Common to the existing studies is that they typically do not determine the response of\nbank lending to changes in bank credit demand.7 When studies control for the bank lending\neffects of bank credit demand, they do not allow bank credit demand to differ between\ndifferent types of customers.8 Given the lack of evidence on the response of bank lending\nto changes in bank credit demand, this section primarily analyzes the existing evidence with\nrespect to the bank lending effects of monetary policy.\nThere is a wide range of studies on the bank lending effects of monetary policy in Europe.\nBecause individual firm and bank-level data are only available to a limited extent, the empirical\ninvestigations largely rely on aggregate data.9 Aggregate studies can be criticized for providing\nan incomplete view on the bank lending effects of monetary policy because they only identify\nthe monetary policy response of bank lending associated with the average bank and average\ndebtor. Empirical studies with disaggregated lending data provide more insights on monetary\npolicy transmission since they distinguish the monetary policy response of the individual\ncomponents of bank lending. The corresponding evidence in, for example, Dale and Haldane\nuppers\nto the type of bank loan and to the choice of banking group.\n7Dale and Haldane (1995) implicitly allow for differences in bank credit demand between the corporate\nand household sector. Unfortunately, the analysis does not identify the response of bank lending to changes\nin bank credit demand.\nH\u00a8\nulsewig, Winker, and Worms (2004), and H\u00a8\nulsewig, Mayer, and Wollmersh\u00a8\nWhile studies using disaggregated data allow for more detail on the determinants of bank\nlending, they still provide an incomplete view. This is because they identify the bank lending\neffects of monetary policy by exploiting the between-group but not the within-group dissim-\nilarities of agents and markets. For example, Kakes and Sturm (2002) capture differences\nin bank size by estimating separate models for different banking groups. The corresponding\nevidence allows for behavioral asymmetries between different banking groups, but not be-\ntween banks within each banking group. In contrast to macroeconomic and disaggregated\nstudies, microeconomic studies exploit heterogeneities within samples to identify the bank\ncredit demand and the bank credit supply effects of monetary policy.\nMany microeconomic studies for European countries including Germany build on BankScope\ns, Fazylov, and\nMolyneux, 2002).10 Although the corresponding studies employ similar data, they differ in\ntheir conclusions regarding the credit channel effects of monetary policy in Germany: credit\nchannel effects through bank lending are particular to De Bondt (1998), but do not prevail\nin Favero, Giavazzi, and Flabbi (1999) and Altunba\u00b8\nresults hence appear to be sensitive to the choice of estimation method and sample period.\nBesides this aspect, the evidence from BankScope data is also subject to a large sample bias.\nIn order to avoid this bias, Ehrmann et al. (2003) and Worms (2003) use microeconomic data\ncompiled by the Deutsche Bundesbank. Both studies empirically account for the response of\nbank lending growth to changes in bank lending demand and monetary policy by estimating\ndynamic panel models using bank-specific bank asset size, liquidity, and capitalization as loan\nsupply proxy variables and macroeconomic measures of economic activity as loan demand\nvariables. The evidence from both studies points to the transmission of monetary policy\nshocks through bank lending, although cross-study differences prevail as to the source of bank\ndistributional effects. Ehrmann et al. (2003) stress cross-bank differences in liquidity, while\nWorms (2003) emphasizes cross-bank heterogeneities in liquidity and capitalization. Worms\n(2003) shows that bank size per se only captures cross-bank differences in the bank lending\neffects of monetary policy when the analysis controls for short-term interbank deposits. As\nregards loan demand factors, Ehrmann et al. (2003) find bank lending to respond to inflation,\nbut not to output growth. Worms (2003), in contrast, documents a positive response of bank\nlending growth to an increase in real output and hence bank credit demand.\nTo summarize, existing studies report ambiguous results regarding the bank lending effects of\nmonetary policy in Germany. The ambiguity prevails for micro- as well as for macroeconomic\nanalyses. Furthermore, existing empirical studies differ in the cross-sectional dimension of\nthe estimations. Some studies only exploit a single data dimension and divide the banking\nsample by either bank size, bank liquidity, or bank capitalization. Other studies also split\nthe sample along a second dimension, using the maturity of bank credit, the banking group,\n10We only refer to those studies which contain Germany. See Angeloni, Kashyap, and Mojon (2003) for a\ncompilation of microeconomic studies that document the credit channel effects of monetary policy in European\ncountries.\nor the group of debtors as additional model criterion. Among the existing studies, only\nWorms (2003) controls for a possible industry bias in bank lending. However, he models the\ninterdependence between loan supply and industry indirectly by including a weighed average\nof real sectoral output as measure of bank credit demand. The resulting estimates do not\nallow for inferences as to the industry-specific effects of bank lending and as to the response\nof bank lending to industry-specific changes in bank credit demand.\nA common caveat applies to the existing empirical studies. When identifying the bank\nlending effects of monetary policy, the empirical literature does not control for the observation\nthat the identification of the bank credit supply effects is not only complicated by possible\nheterogeneities in bank credit demand and in the response of bank lending to changes in bank\ncredit demand, but also by the balance sheet effects of monetary policy. The complication\narises because balance sheet effects cause the volume of bank lending to be simultaneously\ndetermined by bank credit supply and bank credit demand side effects. The supply side\neffects are at the core of the credit channel theory of monetary policy transmission. This\ntheory argues that the balance sheet (net worth) position of potential borrowers such as firms\ninfluences the credit supply decisions of banks. For example, bank credit supply is predicted\nto decline in response to a monetary contraction given the associated deterioration in the\nbalance sheet position of firms (cf. Bernanke and Gertler, 1989).11\nIn contrast to bank credit supply, a monetary-policy-induced decline in net worth has an\nambiguous effect on bank credit demand: it may expand or contract. On the one hand, firms\nmay demand more bank credit in order to be able to finance fixed and inventory investment\nand to preserve liquidity. On the other hand, firms may not change or even reduce bank credit\ndemand in the wake of a monetary contraction. This response requires firms to be swift in\nadjusting production to the monetary-policy-induced decline in output demand so as to reduce\nthe variable costs of production and to avoid the costs associated with undesired inventory\naccumulation. In addition, bank credit demand may decline when firms delay physical capital\ninvestment in anticipation of lower future interest rates.\nOverall, the balance sheet effect of monetary policy causes bank credit supply to contract,\nwhile bank credit demand may expand or contract. Unfortunately, we can only stress this\ncaveat. Similar to existing studies, the present analysis cannot identify the balance sheet\neffects on bank credit supply or bank credit demand. However, this shortcoming is not\nexpected to affect our conclusions regarding the bank supply effects of monetary policy given\nthat existing empirical research lends no or weak support to the existence of balance sheet\neffects of monetary policy in Germany. Evidence against the existence of balance sheet effects\nand Arnold and Vrugt (2004). Von Kalckreuth (2003) reports supportive evidence. However,\nthe balance sheet effect of monetary policy is small.\n11Also see Trautwein (2000) for a literature review on the balance sheet effects of monetary policy and on\nthe relationship between a firm's balance sheet position and its access to bank credit.\n3 Banks and Industries in Germany: An Overview\nIn order to provide the framework for the subsequent discussion, this section describes the\nGerman banking system.12 To this end, we compile quarterly data from the monthly bank\nbalance sheet statistics and the quarterly borrower statistics of the Deutsche Bundesbank for\nspecifically interested in the balance sheet structure of the main banking groups and in the\nindustry structure of bank credit portfolios.\nThroughout this study, we emphasize the industry distribution of aggregate and short-term\nbank credit. The focus on short-term lending is motivated by existing studies which point\nto an immediate response of short- rather than long-term lending to changes in monetary\npolicy (Gertler and Gilchrist, 1993; Kakes and Sturm, 2002). Short-term loans are also\nlikely to respond more (i) to cyclical fluctuations in bank credit demand factors like industry\noutput and prices and (ii) to changes in monetary policy since they are renewed at shorter\nintervals than long-term loans. We also focus on short-term lending because long-term credit\nis determined by factors that cannot easily be constructed given the available information.\nBecause data on, for example, expected output and prices are unavailable at a low level of\nindustry aggregation, we cannot estimate our empirical model for long-term lending without\nincurring the risk of reporting biased and inconsistent estimates due to an omitted variable\nbias. Surely, the omitted variable bias may also affect the results for the model with aggregate\nlending, where aggregate lending is computed as the sum of short-, medium-, and long-term\nbank credit. The evidence on aggregate lending should therefore be viewed as reference point\nto judge the plausibility of the results for short-term lending.\n3.1 The Structure of the German Banking Sector\nThe financing system in Germany is a bank-based system, with banks being the most import-\nant source of external finance. The banking system can be divided into two main categories:\nuniversal banks and specialized banks. At the end of 2003, the German banking sector con-\nbanking system is hence a universal banking system. Given this property, the present analysis\ndisregards specialized banks and focuses on the three main universal banking groups, i.e., the\nsavings, cooperative, and commercial banking sector.\nEach of the main banking groups can be divided into two tiers. The first tier consists of\nfew large head institutions, which are the Land banks, cooperative central banks, and the\nbig banks for the savings, credit cooperative, and commercial banking sector, respectively.\nThe second tier is composed of many primary institutions: local savings banks in the savings\nbanking sector, credit cooperatives in the cooperative banking sector, and regional and private\n12See Hackethal (2004) for an extensive discussion of the properties of the German banking sector.\nbanks in the commercial banking sector. Commercial banks and the head institutions of the\nsavings and credit cooperative sector operate product portfolios which differ from those of\nthe primary savings and credit cooperative banks. The head institutions of the savings and\ncredit cooperative banking sector are the central bank to the corresponding primary (local)\nbanks and offer universal banking services to larger foreign and domestic banks and to non-\nbank customers (cf. Hackethal, 2004). Particular to the head institutions of the savings\nbanking group is their role in providing services to the government of the state in which they\nare located. Considering commercial banks, they structure their product portfolio around\ninvestment and wholesale banking activities, predominantly serving large rather than small-\nand medium-sized clients.\nTable 1 reports summary statistics for the head and primary institutions regarding the distribu-\ntion of total assets, bank capitalization, liquidity, short-term interbank claims, and non-bank\ntween the head and primary institutions are reflected in the descriptive statistics of the bank\nbalance sheet variables. Primary institutions are on average better capitalized than their\nrespective head institutions even though they are smaller. Besides, local savings banks and\nregional and private commercial banks tend to be more liquid than Land banks and big banks,\nwhile the primary institutions of the cooperative banking sector are on average less liquid than\ntheir central institutions. Regardless of the banking group, a comparatively large share of\nliquidity is accounted for by short-term interbank claims. With the exception of regional and\nprivate commercial banks, primary institutions hold a larger share of interbank claims than\ntheir respective head institutions.\nConsidering the distribution of lending to non-banks14, the primary institutions in each bank-\ning sector lend on average more to non-banks than the respective head institutions. The\ndifference is particularly pronounced for the credit cooperative sector: lending by central in-\nstitutes accounts on average for 17 percent of total assets, while the corresponding number\nfor credit cooperatives is 60 percent. The central institutions' low involvement in non-bank\nlending is attributable to their main role as central bank to the primary credit cooperatives.\nIn this function, they act as clearing institutions for interbank transfers between credit coop-\neratives and assist primary credit cooperatives in accessing financial markets and in serving\nAs regards the share of industry bank credit to non-bank credit, the primary and head insti-\n13As regards local savings banks, the descriptive statistics refer to public savings banks only. The present\nstudy excludes private savings banks since they operate under a different institutional setup. The existence\nof significant differences in the balance sheet structure of public and private savings banks is confirmed by\nthe test statistics of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for almost all sampled balance sheet items. The\nANOVA test statistics are available on request.\n14Non-bank lending involves bank credit supply to domestic businesses, private households, government,\nand foreign non-banks.\ntutions of the commercial or savings banking group do not differ in the degree of industry\nlending. A comparatively large share of aggregate non-bank lending is allocated towards\nindustries (i.e., businesses and self-employed), exceeding 50 percent and 40 percent of total\nnon-bank lending for the commercial and savings banking group, respectively. Pronounced\ndifferences again prevail between the primary and head institutions of the credit cooperative\nsector: industry lending by central credit institutes and primary credit cooperatives accounts\non average for approximately two-third and four-ninth of total non-bank lending, respectively.\nConsidering the share of short-term lending to total lending, we find considerable differences\nbetween head and primary institutions for all banking groups. Except for the credit co-\noperative sector, head institutions provide on average less short-term finance than primary\nbanks.\nThe entries in Table 1 also demonstrate that there are not only differences in the balance sheet\nstructure within each banking group, but also between banking groups. These differences are\nexpected to affect the conclusions regarding the bank lending effects of monetary policy for\nindividual banking groups. For example, banks belonging to banking groups with a relatively\nlarge amount of liquid assets (group i) might be better able to insulate their lending activities\nfrom monetary policy changes than banks in banking groups with only few liquid assets (group\nj). If this holds, cross-bank differences in liquidity might be a less important source of bank\nlending effects of monetary policy in group i than in group j. This in turn suggests that\nbanking group differences in liquidity may affect conclusions regarding the strength of the\nbank lending effects of monetary policy.\nBecause they constitute the focal point of the present empirical analysis, we confine the\ncomparison to the primary institutions of the banking groups. As is evident from Table 1,\nthe largest and most liquid banks operate in the savings banking sector, while the smallest\nand least liquid banks belong to the group of credit cooperatives. The regional and private\nbanks in the commercial banking sector report the largest share of bank capital, exceeding\nthat of savings and cooperative banks by more than 90 and 60 percent, respectively. The\ndescriptive analysis also shows that each banking group reports a high share of non-bank\nlending to total assets. Whereas the primary institutions of the credit cooperative and savings\nbanking sector report on average comparable shares of non-bank lending to total assets, the\ncorresponding share tends to be lower for the commercial banking group. This reflects the\ngreater involvement of commercial banks in lending to banks.16\nHowever, when looking at the share of total industry lending to non-bank lending, the primary\ninstitutions of the commercial banking sector lend on average more to industries than savings\nbanks and credit cooperatives. The descriptive evidence suggests that the difference in\nthe average share of total industry lending reflects considerable differences in the role of\nbanking groups as source of short-term finance to industries. Regional and private commercial\npercent, and 8 percent for commercial, credit cooperative, and savings banks, respectively.\nbanks tend to be more heavily engaged in short-term finance than credit cooperatives or\nsavings banks. In fact, short-term lending to industries as share of total industry lending is\napproximately twice as large for commercial banks than for credit cooperatives and savings\nbanks. The apparent weakness of savings banks and credit cooperatives in short-term finance\nis attributable to their practice of confining business to local areas. Superior knowledge of\nlocal market conditions facilitates assessments regarding the long-term creditworthiness of\ndebtors, which yields a comparative advantage in long-term lending.\nIn order to ascertain the statistical significance of cross-banking group differences in the\nbalance sheet structure, we analyze the variance properties of the bank characteristics by\nmeans of a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Table 2 reports the ANOVA test statistics\nfor asset size, liquidity, capitalization, short-term interbank claims, and the volume of bank\ncredit. Panel A contains the results for the three main banking groups, i.e., commercial,\nsavings, and credit cooperative banks and panel B summarizes the evidence for six sub-\ngroups of the credit cooperative banking group. Using the classification scheme of the\nDeutsche Bundesbank, the credit cooperative sub-groups are commercial cooperatives, rural\ncooperatives, Raiffeisen banks, Sparda banks, PSD banks (Post-, Spar-und Darlehensvereine),\nand civil servants banks. We deem this distinction necessary to control for banking group\ndifferences in the balance sheet structure and for differences in the type of customer.\nA comparison of the mean squared values in Table 2 illustrates that the hypothesis of equal\nmeans can be rejected for all bank characteristics and for each banking group sample. The\nevidence thus points to statistically significant differences in the balance sheet structure of\nbanking groups. This in turn suggests that conclusions regarding the bank lending effects of\nmonetary policy changes might be sensitive to the choice of banking group. To control for\nthis possibility, we will therefore estimate industry-specific bank lending functions by explicitly\nallowing for individual 'sub-group' effects.\n3.2 The Industry Structure of Bank Loan Portfolios\nSo far, the description of the structure of the German banking sector is confined to the\ndistribution of lending to the grand total of industries. This section extends the analysis in\nthat it stresses the industry structure of bank credit portfolios. Table 3 reports lending to\nindustry i in total lending by banking group for eight industries at the one-digit industry level\n(main industries) and for nine industries at the two-digit industry level (manufacturing sub-\nsectors).17 Given the focus of the present analysis, we only stress the distribution of aggregate\nand short-term lending as provided by commercial banks (big banks, regional, and private\nbanks) and by the primary institutions of the savings and credit cooperative banking group.\n17Given a change in the industry classification scheme, the bank lending data display a break in 1995:1.\nBecause the descriptive statistics are robust to the 1995:1 observation, the entries in Table 3 refer to the\nWe express aggregate and short-term lending to industry i as share of, respectively, aggregate\nand short-term lending to the grand total of industries. Because the industry distribution of\naggregate and short-term credit is largely comparable, we provide a general discussion.\nThe statistics in Table 3 point to cross-industry differences in the distribution of bank credit.\nBanks predominantly lend to industries which account for the largest share of output in the\naggregate economy: the service, wholesale and retail trade, and manufacturing industry.\nCooperative, savings, and commercial banks hold on average, respectively, 69 percent, 81\npercent, and 89 percent of their bank loan portfolio with these sectors.18\nAs regards the remaining main industries, the volume of bank credit tends to be more evenly\ndistributed across sectors. Agriculture and construction primarily obtain bank finance from the\ncredit cooperative banking group, with rural credit cooperatives and Raiffeisen banks being\nthe primary source of bank finance.19 The importance of credit cooperatives for agriculture\nand construction reflects the regional character of (i) credit cooperatives and (ii) agricultural\nand constructing firms: lenders and borrowers confine their activities to a particular local\narea. In adopting a regional focus, credit cooperatives have superior knowledge of local\nmarket conditions, which facilitates assessments regarding local economic prospects and the\ncreditworthiness of potential debtors.\nThe share of bank credit is on average smallest for the finance and insurance industry. One\npossible explanation for this relationship are large operating surpluses in the finance sector\nwhich reduce the need for external finance in general and bank finance in particular.20 Next to\nthe finance industry, the energy sector also receives comparatively little credit from commercial\nbanks and from the primary institutions of the savings and credit cooperative banking group.\nAlthough not reported in Table 3, the Land banks are an important source of finance to the\ndirected towards the energy sector, with short- and long-term bank credit accounting for 28\nand 60 percent, respectively. The importance of Land banks as source of long-term finance\n18The data suggest that approximately half of these shares is accounted for by lending to the service sector.\nWhile lending to the service sector is certainly substantial, no clear conclusions prevail as to the sector's\nabsolute importance as recipient of bank lending. The reason is that the Bundesbank borrower statistics\nreport bank lending to the service sector as residual of bank lending to the remaining industries. For the\nremainder of this paper, this shortcoming should be kept in mind when interpreting the empirical evidence\nfor the service sector.\n19Raiffeisen banks and rural credit cooperatives grant 26 (19) percent and 16 (12) percent of aggregate\n(short-term) credit to agriculture, respectively. In comparison, the corresponding number for commercial\ncredit cooperatives is 6 (5) percent. The cross-banking group differences are less pronounced for lending\nto the construction industry. Raiffeisen banks, rural credit cooperatives, and commercial credit cooperatives\nrespectively.\na standard deviation of 2.30 percent for the finance and insurance sector (own computation using the OECD's\nSTAN database for Industrial Analysis). In comparison, operating surplus accounts for at most 31 percent of\nvalue added for the remaining industries.\nto the energy sector is attributable to the components of this sector: mining and quarrying;\nelectricity, gas, and water supply. Given the importance of each of these sub-sectors for the\nfunctioning of the economy, general interest is with the maintenance and improvement of the\nunderlying infrastructures. Maintenance requires large fixed expenditures, while infrastructure\ninvestment involves costs which tend to be sunk. In order to encourage investment, Land\nbanks grant favorable access to especially long-term finance even though investment per se\nmight not be profitable.\nTurning to the sub-sectors of the manufacturing industry, lending to each of the sectors only\naccounts for a small share of total bank credit, with the share of bank credit to each sector\nbeing positively related to its size in the aggregate economy. Lending to the manufacturing\nsub-sectors hence tends to be unevenly distributed. The share of bank credit is compara-\ntively small for the coke and chemicals, rubber and plastic, and non-metallic mineral goods\nproducing sector. However, it is relatively large for the wood and paper, machinery and\ntransport equipment, food, and metals producing sector. In fact, lending to these sectors is\nof approximately the same magnitude as lending to the finance and transport sector.21\n4 Empirical Model\nThe remainder of this paper stresses industry-specific cyclical determinants of bank credit\ndemand as factors which have a strong effect on bank lending to industries.22 Besides\ncyclical credit demand factors, we will also stress the role of monetary policy as determinant\nof industry-specific bank lending and test for credit channel effects of monetary policy via\nbank lending. The corresponding evidence allows for inferences as to the importance of the\nindustry structure of bank credit portfolios as determinant of monetary policy effectiveness and\nindustry performance through the availability of industry-specific bank credit. Furthermore,\nwe test whether conclusions are robust to the choice of aggregate and short-term bank credit.\nThe remainder of this section presents the industry-specific bank lending functions and the\nmethodological approach that will be employed to identify the industry effects of bank credit\ndemand and monetary policy.\n4.1 Empirical Estimation Framework\nIn order to identify the response of bank lending to changes in bank credit demand and\nmonetary policy, we apply the dynamic panel estimation framework of Ehrmann et al. (2003),\n21Similar conclusions prevail for descriptive statistics that control for the 1995:1 structural break in the\nindustry bank lending series by dropping the corresponding observation from the analysis. The break results\nfrom a redefinition of the industry classification scheme.\n22In the ideal case, one would also like to explain cross-industry differences in the distribution of credit\nwith structural industry characteristics. Unfortunately, the small number of industries and the unavailability\nof structural industry data of sufficient quality prevent an analysis along this line.\nWorms (2003), and Gambacorta and Mistrulli (2004) to estimate a set of bank lending\nfunctions. Although we use the same structural estimation framework, the analysis adds to\nthe existing work by exploring the industry dimension of bank lending. Equation (1) describes\nthe empirical bank lending function for bank b and industry i.23\nLbi,t\n= b\n+\np\nij\nLbi,t-j\n+\np\nrM,t-j\n+\np\nIPi,t-j\n+\np\nPricei,t-j\n+\n+\np\nrM,t-j\n+ bi,t\nThe coefficient b\nis a bank-specific intercept that is included to allow for fixed effects across\nbanks and bi,t\nis an i.i.d. random variable with zero mean and constant variance, i.e.,\n).

The autoregressive parameters ij\nare assumed to\nbe the same across banks, but heterogeneous across industries. Furthermore, they may differ\nacross banking groups. In order to control for cross-banking group differences, we estimate\nthe model for individual banking groups.\n is the first log-difference operator of variable V defined as   log Vt\n- log Vt-1\n. With\nthe exception of the money market interest rate, the first log-difference transformation is\napplied to all variables. The money market interest rate enters in first differences. Ehrmann\net al. (2003) motivate the first-difference structure of the empirical model by stressing that\nthe monetary policy effect on bank lending is confined to new loans. They hence interpret\nthe first log-difference of bank credit as flow variable and introduce the level of loans as\nstock variable. When suggesting this measure of new loans, Ehrmann et al. (2003) fail to\nrecognize that the first difference is an imperfect measure of new bank loans since it reflects\nthe net effect of new loan issues and loan repayments. Unfortunately, the present study can\nonly acknowledge this shortcoming, but cannot resolve it because of data unavailability. As\na consequence, reductions in the volume of loans outstanding may reflect a decline in new\nloan issues or a net increase in loan repayments.\nIPit\napproximates industry-specific output at time t which serves as a measure of cyclically\ndetermined industry-specific bank credit demand. Priceit\ndenotes the industry-specific price at\ntime t and is included to capture cyclical fluctuations in industry-specific price developments\nand their effect on bank credit demand. Unfortunately, industry output and industry price\ndo not only determine the external financing needs of industries, but also influence the\n23Also see section 6.4 and appendix C for alternative model specifications. An appealing alternative spec-\nification of model (1) stacks bank lending by industry for all industries and captures industry effects with\nindustry dummies. Given the large number of banks and industries, computational limitations preclude the\nrealization of this approach in the present framework.\nperceptions of banks as to the riskiness of industries. The importance of industry output\nand industry prices as measures of risk implies, however, that a unique identification of bank\ncredit demand effects with output and prices is infeasible. These variables may also affect\nbank credit supply through balance sheet effects.24 For example, a decline in industry output\nand a decline in industry prices reduces the willingness of banks to grant loans since both\ndevelopments worsen the balance sheet position of firms, which leaves them more risky.\nIndustry output may also determine the access to bank finance because it influences the\nability of sectors to offer collateral in return for external finance. Given that banks perceive\nindustries with little collateral to be more risky, lending to these industries is likely to be\ncomparatively low. This relationship suggests that output may affect bank lending beyond\nthe effect suggested by cross-industry differences in bank credit demand. Unfortunately,\nwe can only acknowledge the caveat that industry output and industry prices are imperfect\nmeasures of bank credit demand effects but cannot distinguish the bank credit demand and\nbank credit supply effects inherent to output and inflation. The empirical evidence for these\nvariables therefore needs to be interpreted with some caution.\nMonetary policy actions are represented by the change in the three-months money market\ninterest rate rM\n. We assume that the interest rate is strictly exogenous to bank lending.25\nIn order to identify the bank lending effects of monetary policy, the money market interest\nrate (rM,t-j\n) at time t-j is interacted with bank characteristics (Xb,t-1\n) at time t-1. The vector\nof bank-specific characteristics Xb\nincludes asset size (TA), liquidity (A), and capitalization\n(K) at time t-1. Bank characteristics are introduced with one lag to avoid an endogeneity\nand Mistrulli, 2004). Appendix B contains a formal definition of the bank characteristics.\nWorms (2003) and Ehrmann and Worms (2004) show that the tight relationship between\nthe primary and head institutions of the savings and credit cooperative banking sector causes\nbank asset size to be an inappropriate proxy variable of the bank lending effects of monetary\npolicy. One explanation is that interbank operations enable small banks to shield their loan\nportfolio and funding possibilities against monetary policy shocks by providing a relatively\nunconstrained access to central bank money. In that sense, the interbank market helps to\nredistribute liquidity within the banking sector from banks with excess liquidity to banks\nin need of liquidity. This in turn moderates financing constraints for small banks. As a\nconsequence, the interest rate sensitivity of small bank lending does not have to be higher\nthan that of large banks. Bank size might also be an inappropriate measure of information\nasymmetries because savings banks as well as credit cooperatives back their funds with\nmutual guarantees. This serves to recapitalize banks and creates a type of insurance scheme\nfor creditors in case of bank insolvency. The existence of these insurance schemes implies that\n24We thank Heinz Herrmann for rising this point. Also see section 2 for a corresponding note.\n25See Worms (2003) for empirical evidence as to the robustness of the interest rate response of bank lending\nto the assumption of exogeneity.\ninformation asymmetries may not affect the lending behavior of banks. Consequently, size\nappears to be an inadequate variable to identify the loan supply effects of monetary policy\nand alternative better measures might be bank capitalization or bank liquidity.\nThe present model employs a 'broad' and 'narrow' measure of bank liquidity. The main\ndifference concerns the way short-term interbank claims are treated. The 'broad' measure of\nliquidity includes short-term interbank claims and is defined as the ratio of cash plus securities\nplus short-term interbank claims over total bank assets. For this definition, possible significant\nrelationships between bank liquidity and the monetary policy response of bank lending can\nbe driven by short-term interbank claims (cf. Worms, 2003 and Ehrmann and Worms, 2004).\nIn order to determine whether short-term interbank claims indeed drive liquidity effects, we\nfollow Worms (2003) and split the broad measure of liquidity into two components: (i) a\n'narrow' part of liquidity defined as the ratio of cash plus securities over total bank assets and\n(ii) the share of short-term interbank claims to total assets. Both components are separately\nincluded in estimations of model (1).26 The corresponding models will subsequently be\nreferred to as narrow liquidity and interbank specifications.\nWe summarize the bank lending effects of changes in monetary policy and changes in bank\ncredit demand by computing the long-run elasticities of bank lending with respect to the\nexplanatory variables in model (1).27 The industry-specific long-run coefficients LR,i\nare\ndefined as the sum of the lags of the variable in question divided by one minus the sum of\nthe coefficients on the lagged bank credit variable: LR,i\n=\nJ\nij\nij\nthe long-run coefficients are a non-linear function of the estimated parameters, we derive the\ncorresponding standard errors by means of the standard delta method.29\nWe hypothesize the long-run coefficient estimates in model (1) to enter with the following\nsigns. Motivated by the negative effects of higher interest rates on bank reserves, we expect\nbank lending to decline in response to a monetary contraction. The distributional effects of\nmonetary policy are anticipated to be such that the response of bank lending to monetary\npolicy changes is less pronounced for larger, more liquid, and better capitalized banks. This\nholds if the coefficient on the interaction term between each bank characteristic and the\ninterest rate is positive. Ambivalent conclusions prevail with respect to the expected effect of\nindustry output growth on bank lending growth. On the one hand, good economic conditions\nincrease the number of investment projects with positive net present value and hence the\n26The subsequent analysis will thus report the results for a broad and narrow definition of liquidity and for\nshort-term interbank claims.\n27We follow the existing literature when referring to long-run elasticities (e.g., Deutsche Bundesbank, 2002b;\ninterpretation views the 'long-run' coefficient as the lasting response of bank lending growth to changes in\neither bank credit demand or monetary policy.\n28The properties of the residuals do not change with J=5.\n29To conserve on space, we only report the short-run coefficient for the one-period lag of the normalized\nbank characteristics. The short-run coefficients for the remaining variables are available on request.\ndemand for bank finance. On the other hand, economic growth stimulates internal cash\nflows, which may reduce credit demand. Because evidence in favor of a negative relationship\nbetween output and bank lending is hardly existing, the long-run coefficient on output growth\nis expected to be positive.30\nFinally, industry inflation is anticipated to stimulate bank lending growth.31 This relationship\nholds for demand- as well as supply-side-driven developments in prices. On the supply side,\nindustry inflation due to higher input prices may cause firms to demand more bank credit to\noffset the effect of higher production costs on short-run profits. In order to observe this effect,\noutput prices need to exhibit short-run price stickiness; a phenomenon accounted for by, for\nexample, menu costs. On the demand side, industry inflation may reflect good economic\nconditions and promising investment opportunities for firms. Similar to the argument for\nindustry output, good investment opportunities may increase the demand for external finance.\nThe present analysis does not explicitly account for merger-driven changes in the German\nbanking system and hence does not control for the effects of mergers on the individual\ncharacteristics of the merging banks. The appropriateness of this approach is suggested by\nWorms (2003) who finds the long-run bank lending effects of monetary policy to be the same\nfor samples which do not control for mergers and for samples which treat a merged bank\nas single bank for the pre- and post-merger sample period. Besides, implementation lags\nbetween the time a merger is officially announced and the time a merger is legally realized\nmakes it difficult to determine the date of a merger. For these reasons, we will eliminate\nmost merger effects with the outlier detection procedure introduced in section 5.\nThe system in equation (1) represents a fixed effects dynamic (unbalanced) panel with large\nT and large N. Lagged values of the dependent variable are included to control for an omitted\nvariable and endogeneity bias. Because the lagged dependent variable is correlated with the\nerror term, dynamic panel models are typically not estimated with the static panel fixed\neffects estimator. Doing so would introduce a finite sample bias of order 1\nT\nfor N  \nand fixed T (see Nickell, 1981; Kiviet, 1995). In order to avoid biased and inconsistent\nestimates, Arellano and Bond (1991) suggest the use of a generalized method of moments\n(GMM) estimator. Recent studies have challenged this method. Blundell and Bond (1998)\nand Blundell, Bond, and Windmeijer (2000) have shown that the first-differenced GMM\nestimates are biased downwards in the direction of the within-group estimates and Alvarez\nfor evidence in favor of a positive relationship between bank lending and output. Altunba\u00b8\ns, Fazylov, and\nMolyneux (2002) report a positive output coefficient for medium-sized and undercapitalized banks and a\nnegative coefficient for small-sized and under- or overcapitalized banks in Germany.\n31Ehrmann et al. (2003) and Gambacorta and Mistrulli (2004) report evidence of a positive price effect on\nbank lending.\nand Arellano (2003) show that the GMM estimator is close to the fixed effects estimator for\nlarge T. Furthermore, Jung (2005) illustrates that Arrelano and Bond's (1991) test of serial\nresidual correlation may build on inconsistently estimated residuals. Because these are used\nto decide on the optimal over-identifying restrictions, coefficient estimates are likely to be\ninconsistent.\nIn view of these points and given a comparatively large set of data points in the time dimen-\nsion, we estimate the dynamic panel model by using the fixed effects estimator. Besides, the\nuse of the fixed effects estimator is also motivated by the evidence from the Hansen J-statistic\naccording to which the over-identifying restrictions in the present set of GMM estimations\nare invalid regardless of the instrumentalization. In order to ensure that the presence of au-\ntocorrelation in the residuals it\ndoes not result in inconsistent and inefficient estimators, we\ncompute White-period standard errors (Arellano, 1987), which are robust to arbitrary serial\ncorrelation and time-varying variances in the residuals. We test for the existence of first-order\nand second-order serial autocorrelation by regressing the within regression residuals against\ntheir one- and two-period lag. The underlying model allows for fixed effects and White-period\nIdeally, the analysis of the industry-specific bank lending effects of changes in bank credit\ndemand and monetary policy would build on firm-level as well as bank-level data. Bank-level\ndata allow for the identification of the credit channel effects of monetary policy through bank\nlending and firm-level data allow for assessments regarding the operation of a credit channel\nthrough balance sheet effects. Even though firm-level data are available from the corporate\nbalance sheet statistics of the Deutsche Bundesbank, they are not useful for our purpose\nbecause they are only available at an annual frequency and subject to a large firm bias.33\nGiven the unavailability of adequate firm-level data, we determine the bank lending effects\nof changes in credit demand and monetary policy for industry aggregates. Industry data are\ncompiled for industries at the one- and two-digit industry level. The latter are sub-sectors of\nthe manufacturing industry (see Appendix A).\nBank-level data on bank-specific credit supply to individual industries and bank-specific bal-\nance sheet variables are respectively obtained from the quarterly borrower statistics and\nmonthly bank balance sheet statistics of the Deutsche Bundesbank for the period 1992-2003.\nBecause data in 2003 display patterns that are irreconcilable with those in earlier years, we\n32Note, the conclusions regarding the existence of serial autocorrelation are robust to the way in which\nthe first- and second-order autocorrelation coefficient is computed. A simple least-squares estimator without\nfixed effects and White-period standard errors produces comparable results.\nbank lending series are subject to a structural break in 1995:1. Resulting from a redefinition of\nthe industry classification scheme, the break is particularly pronounced for some sub-sectors\nof the manufacturing industry. In order to avoid that the empirical results capture the ef-\nfect of the structural break, the 1995:1 observation is, first of all, dropped from all industry\nestimations. Unfortunately, the residuals of the corresponding estimations are frequently se-\nrially correlated and the long-run coefficients therefore biased and inconsistent. In a second\nstep, the bank lending specifications are re-estimated with the 1995:1 observation. Because\nthe consequent error terms tend to behave better and given that the long-run coefficients\nfrom estimations with and without the 1995:1 observation compare well in terms of sign,\nthe present paper reports the evidence from specifications with the 1995:1 value. However,\nwe confine the analysis to those industries for which the structural break is less pronounced.\nThis implies that four out of nine sub-sectors of the manufacturing industry are not further\nThe bank-specific balance sheet and lending data display seasonal patterns. For each bank,\nthese are removed by means of the centered-moving average method. This is an admittedly\nsimple adjustment procedure which can be criticized for ignoring, for example, working day\nand leap year effects. However, it is the preferred method in the present analysis because\nit is applicable despite the large number of cross sections. Furthermore, a comparison of\nthe seasonally adjusted and non-adjusted series shows that the centered moving average\nprocedure captures seasonal fluctuations well.\nInformation on industry production and industry prices is available from the New Cronos\ndatabase at a monthly frequency for most industries. For some industries, industry output is\napproximated with industry value added. The corresponding data are provided by the German\nfederal statistical office. The monthly data on industry output and prices are converted into\nquarterly data to match the frequency of the bank lending data. While data on industry\nthe industry-specific price index against a constant and the contemporaneous value of the\naggregate price index and use the coefficient estimates from ordinary least squares (OLS) to\nextrapolate the missing values on industry-specific prices. Industry prices for the wholesale\nand retail trade, finance and insurance, transport and communication, and service sector are\nnot available from the New Cronos database. Instead, we construct them using information\non nominal and real value added from the German statistical office for the whole sample\n34The following sub-sectors are eliminated: (i) basic metals and fabricated metals products, (ii) machinery\nand transport equipment, (iii) electrical and optical equipment, (iv) wood and products of wood and cork;\npulp, paper, and paper products.\n35Note, the German statistical office reports data on nominal and real value added jointly for the (i)\nwholesale and retail trade sector and (ii) transport and communication sector. Unfortunately, we cannot\ndisentangle the industry-specific price for each of these sectors, but have to rely on the composite price\nmeasure.\nThe New Cronos database and the Bundesbank quarterly borrower statistics occasionally dif-\nfer in terms of industry aggregation. In particular, the borrower statistics tend to refer to\ncomposites of industries rather than to individual units. In order to adopt the same level\nof industry aggregation, the New Cronos data on industry production and industry charac-\nteristics are also combined across some industries. The composite indices are constructed\nby controlling for the relative importance of the single industries in the composite. Limited\nby data availability, the weights are approximated as the 1992-2002 ratio of annual value\nadded of industry i to aggregate value added of the industries included in the composite.\nSince the weights are time-invariant, the use of the 1992-2002 average as weight seems to\nbe innocuous.\nIn order to ensure the reliability of the empirical results, the quarterly data are screened\nalong different lines. Firstly, the data are checked for outliers. Outlier detection concerns\nthe relationship between variables as well as the distribution of variables. One relationship\nconcerns the need of banks to meet their balance sheet constraint. For the requirement that\ntotal assets equal total liabilities, the study keeps all but 5 data points.36 Another relationship\nis defined as the need to have positive entries for credit supply and total assets. In the present\nsample, at most 18 data points for industry-specific loans and 47 data points for total assets\ndo not meet the non-negativity constraint. These observations are excluded from the sample.\nAs regards the distribution of variables, the outlier detection procedure is predominantly\nimplemented for variables in levels. The exception concerns the volume of bank credit and\ntotal bank assets. In order to avoid the exclusion of very large and very small banks on\nthe ground of sheer size, the outlier detection procedure for total assets and the volume of\nbank credit is implemented for their first log-differences.37 Regardless of the variable, outliers\nare detected by using the sequential outlier rejection (SOR) algorithm described in Corney\n(2002). In contrast to standard methods like the z-score or box plot method, this outlier\ndetection procedure adopts a sequential approach which accounts for the effect of outliers\non the standard error in the sample. Furthermore, the SOR approach does not assume the\nnormal distribution of banks at any point in time. This property is particularly valuable since\nthe hypothesis of normally distributed banks can be rejected for all sampled variables (see\nTable 1 and Table 3).\nThe SOR algorithm requires the data to be repeatedly clustered using any clustering algo-\nrithm. The present analysis uses k-means clustering for each of the main banking groups,\nwith k = 2.38 For each repetition, the sum-squared error for k-means is computed, which\ndescribes the sum-squared deviation of each data point in the sample to the nearest clus-\n36A data point is a single time observation associated with an individual bank (e.g., the observation\n38The large number of observations and computer limitations preclude the definition of more than two\nclusters.\nter center. The data point that contributes most to the sum-squared error for k-means is\nexcluded from the sample. For each point in time and each banking group, the clustering\nalgorithm is iteratively applied to the dataset. The number of iterations is roughly equal to\n5 percent of the number of banks at each point in time.39 That is, the first step of the\nprocedure treats 5 percent of all banks at each point in time as potential outlier. The second\nstep builds on the iteratively excluded observations from step one and determines the actual\nnumber of outliers by using the second difference of the sum-squared error term. Under\nthe assumption that the sum-squared error rate is driven by outliers, the second derivative\nis close to zero and the cumulative sum thereof is constant for the sequence of data which\nexcludes atypical observations. In the present study, we exclude any data point as outlier if\nit explains more than one percent of the cumulative sum of the second derivative. Similar to\nother outlier detection methods (e.g., the box plot method and the z-approach), the choice\nof threshold is arbitrary.\nThe analysis is confined to institutions which have the status of a monetary finance institute\n(MFI) throughout the whole sample period. The restricted focus is necessitated by a change\nin data definition. Until 1998:4, non-MFIs were treated as financial institutions and the\nDeutsche Bundesbank borrower statistics reported lending by these institutions to enterprises\nand households. As of 1999:1, non-MFIs are treated as enterprises and the borrower statistics\ndo no longer report lending by, but credit supply to these institutions. In order to avoid that\nthe definitional change of non-MFIs from being creditors to being debtors biases the results,\nwe exclude banks with a non-MFI status in any quarter during the sample period. This leads\nto a loss of 1400 data points from the commercial banking group and 208 data points from\nthe cooperative banking group.\n6 Empirical Results\nThis section reports the empirical results of the fixed effects dynamic panel estimation. In\nsection 6.1, we first describe the different samples for which the benchmark model (1) is\nestimated. Section 6.2 then reports ANOVA test statistics that help to structure the analysis\nof the empirical results from the dynamic panel in section 6.3. We conclude the present\nsection with robustness tests of the benchmark model (1).\nThe empirical model is estimated for different combinations of banking groups. Table 4\nsummarizes the composition of the samples. One sample jointly includes the primary (local)\ninstitutions of the commercial, savings, and credit cooperative sector. This group is subse-\n39The number of iterations depends on the availability of data for a given banking group at a particular\npoint in time. The results are not sensitive to a larger number of iterations.\nquently referred to as the aggregate banking group. Group-specific effects are captured with\nbanking group dummies for the savings and commercial banking group. Because the dum-\nmies turn out to be statistically insignificant in almost all specifications, weak or no banking\ngroup effects appear to exist for savings and commercial banks relative to credit cooperatives.\nIn view of this finding, the subsequent evidence for the aggregate banking group refers to\nthe results from estimations without banking group dummies. We also estimate the model\nfor the credit cooperative banking sector, with banking dummies for the commercial credit\ncooperative banking group and Raiffeisen banks. In contrast to the aggregate banking group,\nthe dummies turn out to be statistically significant for most industry bank lending functions.\nIn order to allow for the possibility of parameter heterogeneity across banking groups, another\nsample is separately defined for the three main sub-groups of the credit cooperative banking\ngroup (i.e., rural, commercial, and Raiffeisen banks) and for savings banks. The importance\nof possible panel heterogeneity is suggested by the ANOVA evidence in section 3.1 that points\nto structural differences between (i) the savings and cooperative banking group and (ii) the\nsub-groups of the cooperative banking sector. When estimating individual models for the\nsavings and credit cooperative banking group, we assume cross-bank homogeneity in the\ninterest rate elasticity of loan demand and hence cross-bank similarities in the distribution\nof bank-dependent and bank-independent customers within each individual banking group.\nWe do not estimate an individual model for the commercial banking group or for the head\ninstitutions of the savings and credit cooperative banking sector because they operate product\nportfolios which differ from those of the local savings and credit cooperative banks. Besides,\nestimates for an individual sample of commercial banks are not reported since the number\nof cross sections is low. The fixed number of observations causes the fixed effects estimator\nand the robust covariance matrix estimates to be inconsistent although T is relatively large.\n6.2 Analysis of Variance Tests\nThe representation of the results is complicated by the cross-sectional dimension of the\nstudy. To condense the analysis, this section first reports test statistics of one- and two-\nway analyses of variance which illustrate the sensitivity of the results to the choice of bank\ncharacteristic, the choice of aggregate and short-term lending, and the choice of industry and\nbanking group. The test statistics are computed for the long-run coefficients of model (1)\nirrespective of the significance properties of the coefficient estimates. If we would confine\nthe analysis to industries for which significant estimates are reported, ANOVA would not\nbe feasible. Despite the inclusion of insignificant estimates, the results are still deemed to\nbe illustrative. On the one hand, we only compute test statistics for variables for which\nmost industry-specific long-run estimates are statistically significant, i.e., for industry output\ngrowth, industry inflation, and the interest rate change. Test statistics are not reported for the\ninteraction terms because of pronounced differences in their statistical significance across the\ndifferent bank lending specifications. On the other hand, the insignificant industry-specific\ncoefficient estimates on either industry output growth, inflation, or the interest rate change\ncompare well with the significant estimates in terms of sign and magnitude regardless of the\nchoice of bank characteristic.\nWe first investigate whether the long-run coefficient estimates for industry output growth,\ninflation, and the interest rate change are influenced by the choice of bank characteristic,\ni.e., bank asset size, capitalization, broad/narrow liquidity, or short-term interbank claims.\nBecause the results from the one-way analysis of variance are robust to the choice of banking\ngroup and do not differ for aggregate and short-term lending, we only report the results for\nthe aggregate banking group and for short-term lending.40 The results in Table 5 (columns\n3 to 6) show that the null hypothesis of equal coefficients across bank characteristics cannot\nbe rejected. The choice of bank characteristic hence does not significantly affect the long-run\nsensitivity of bank lending with respect to either industry-specific bank credit demand or the\nmoney market interest rate.\nWe next ask whether the long-run coefficients of the sampled variables depend on the choice\nof aggregate and short-term bank lending. Because the coefficient estimates are insensitive\nto the choice of bank characteristic, we only report the one-way ANOVA test statistics for\nbank asset size. The evidence in Table 5 (columns 7 to 10) points to the equality of the\nlong-run coefficients of industry output growth and interest rate changes for aggregate and\nshort-term lending. Considering inflation, conclusions regarding the determinants of bank\nlending growth differ for aggregate and short-term credit. The discrepancy in the long-run\ncoefficients is attributable to the sub-sectors of the manufacturing sector.41\nWe conclude the discussion by formally testing whether differences in the bank lending ef-\nfects are accounted for by banking groups or by industries. To this end, we compute the test\nstatistics of a two-way analysis of variance. Given the one-way ANOVA test statistics, we\nonly report the results for short-term lending and bank asset size, noting that the evidence\nfor aggregate lending and the remaining bank characteristics does not differ.42 Table 6 sum-\nmarizes the results. The analysis of variance shows that differences in the responsiveness of\nshort-term bank lending growth to industry output growth and industry inflation are attribu-\ntable to industries, but not to banking groups.43 That is, the evidence stresses discernible\nindustry dissimilarities in the bank lending effects of industry output growth and inflation.\n40The results for the remaining banking groups are available on request.\n41Despite differences in the long-run response of short-term and aggregate lending to industry inflation, we\nonly discuss the evidence for short-term lending to conserve on space. The results for aggregate lending are\navailable on request. Note, ANOVA tests for the main industries only do not find significant differences in\nthe long-run coefficients of industry inflation for aggregate and short-term lending.\n42The ANOVA test statistics for estimations with bank capitalization, liquidity, and interbank assets and\nfor aggregate lending are available on request.\n43We replicate the analysis of variance for a sample that excludes the construction sector. The restricted\nfocus is motivated by the unexpected positive interest rate response of bank lending to this industry. We find\nthe ANOVA results to be robust to this sample adjustment.\nIn contrast to output growth and inflation, differences in the long-run bank lending effects\nof interest rate changes are explained by banking groups and industries. However, industry\neffects appear to be the more important source of variation in the bank lending effects of\nmonetary policy. This conclusion builds on the observation that the F-value for the industry\neffect exceeds the corresponding value for the banking group effect.\nThe ANOVA evidence illustrates that industries are the more important source of differences\nin the bank lending effects of industry credit demand and monetary policy. In addition, we find\nthe results regarding the bank lending effects of industry output growth, industry inflation,\nand monetary policy to be insensitive to the choice of aggregate and short-term lending.\nMotivated by these findings and to condense on space, the following section presents and\ndiscusses the empirical panel evidence on the determinants of industry-specific short-term\nbank lending growth for the aggregate banking group.\n6.3 Evidence from Industry-Specific Bank Lending Functions\nThe empirical evidence from the benchmark model (1) is discussed in two parts. In a first\nstep, we report the response of bank lending growth to changes in bank credit demand (i.e.,\nindustry output growth, industry inflation) and to changes in the money market interest rate.\nWe then discuss the interaction terms between bank characteristics and monetary policy to\ndraw conclusion as to the existence of credit channel effects of monetary policy through bank\nlending. Table 7 summarizes the coefficient estimates for the industry-specific bank lending\nfunctions.\n(i) The Bank Lending Effects of Loan Demand and Monetary Policy\nWe report evidence for individual industries and for the grand total of industries. The evidence\nfor the grand total of industries is our benchmark in the discussion of the industry-specific bank\nlending functions. Besides, when emphasizing the results for the grand total of industries,\nwe can compare the present empirical findings with the evidence of earlier studies which do\nnot adopt an industry-specific focus. In order to facilitate the readability of the results, we\nlabel industries by using abbreviations. For example, the finance and insurance industry is\nsubsequently introduced as finance sector and the transport and communication sector is\nreferred to as transport sector. Appendix A provides details. Because the evidence in section\n6.2 shows that the choice of bank characteristic does not affect the long-run sensitivity of\nbank lending with respect to industry output growth, industry inflation, or the money market\ninterest rate, we provide a general discussion of the results regarding the industry-specific\nbank lending effects of bank credit demand and monetary policy.\nConsidering the response of bank lending growth to industry output growth, the entries in\nTable 7 illustrate that bank lending to the grand total of industries increases in response to\nhigher output growth. The positive output response of lending to the grand total reflects\nthe statistically significant and positive response of lending to growth in agriculture, con-\nstruction, trade, services, and the food manufacturing sector. At least for the construction\nsector, the positive reaction of bank lending is influenced by the 1992-1995 re-unification\nconstruction boom period that induced heavy investment. Opposite relationships exist for\ntotal manufacturing and for the sub-sectors of the manufacturing industry. This suggests\nthat manufacturing firms demand less bank credit in response to output growth.44 Possible\nreasons are (i) higher internal flows of finance, which reduce external financing needs and/or\n(ii) the absence of promising future economic prospects, which yield disincentives for invest-\nment. The relevance of the second point is suggested by the continuous decline in the share\nof manufacturing value added in aggregate value added during the last decade.45 Next to the\nmanufacturing industry, we also find an inverse relationship between bank lending growth and\noutput growth for the finance sector. In contrast to the manufacturing industry, the finance\nsector accounts for an increasingly larger share of aggregate value added. The decline in bank\nlending may therefore reflect the effect of higher internal cash flow and the consequent lower\nneed for bank finance.\nAs regards the response of bank lending growth to inflation, it is significant and positive\nfor the grand total of industries. The positive reaction of bank lending to the grand total\nof industries reflects the positive response of bank lending to almost all industries. The\nexceptions are the transport and machinery and transport equipment manufacturing sector.\nIn contrast to expectations, bank lending to these sectors significantly contracts in response\nto higher industry inflation.\nTurning to the interest rate response of bank lending, the evidence confirms the view that\nhigher interest rates cause lending to the grand total of industries to contract. The decline in\nbank lending reflects the negative effect of higher interest rates on bank reserves and credit\nrationing on the part of banks in response to an increase in the risk of loan default. The\nevidence in Table 7 also illustrates that this response is a weighed average of the interest rate\nreaction of all industries. We find unanimous cross-industry differences in the nature of the\ninterest rate response of bank lending. On the one hand, the negative interest rate response\nof lending to the grand total of industries reflects lower bank credit supply to the energy,\nmanufacturing, and transport industry, with the interest rate effect being most pronounced for\nthe first two sectors. We attribute the strength of the effect for the energy and manufacturing\nindustry to the comparatively high capital intensity of production, which is associated with\na higher probability of loan losses (cf. Deutsche Bundesbank, 1996). For the manufacturing\nsector, the decline in lending reveals the negative interest rate effects of bank credit supply to\nthe chemicals and coke, rubber and plastic, and textiles producing sector. At least the textiles\nproducing sector is again more capital-intensive in comparison to the remaining industries.\n44Also see Deutsche Bundesbank (1996) for a similar conclusion.\n45The ratio of value added for manufacturing to value added for the grand total of industries declined from\nOn the other hand, a monetary policy contraction induces higher lending to the construction,\ntrade, and finance industry and to producers of non-metallic mineral goods. The positive\ninterest rate response of lending to construction is not consistent with expectations. However,\nit can be explained with the structural and cyclical characteristics of the construction sector.\nAs regards the structural properties, the construction industry is characterized by a large share\nof small firms, which predominantly obtain bank credit from local credit cooperatives and\nregional savings banks.46 Knowledge of local market conditions and local debtors reduces\ninformation asymmetries and fosters housebank relationships. Housebank relationships, in\nturn, facilitate the access to bank finance in general and in periods of high interest rates and\nlow demand in particular. Considering cyclical factors, the positive interest rate response of\nbank lending reflects the demand-driven re-unification boom in construction. Even during\nthe 1991-1992 period of high interest rates, demand for residential buildings and production\nplants was high and even continued to increase.\nThe positive interest rate response of bank lending to the finance industry can be explained\nin terms of risk considerations. To explain, a contraction in monetary policy increases the\nprobability of loan default of firms in all industries. While the riskiness of firms in all industries\nincreases, banks may perceive firms in the finance sector to be less risky because they are\nexposed to more stringent financial regulation and supervision than firms in the non-financial\nsector. In view of this relationship, the positive interest rate response of lending to the finance\nand insurance sector may describe the effort of banks to channel a larger share of their bank\ncredit portfolio towards relatively less risky firms in the finance sector.\nThe entries in Table 7 point to pronounced cross-industry differences in the magnitude of\nthe bank lending effects of output growth, inflation, and interest rate changes. The largest\nresponse of bank lending to changes in monetary policy, industry inflation, and output growth\nis observed for the sub-sectors of the manufacturing industry. Indeed, bank lending to these\nsectors tends to be more responsive than bank lending to the manufacturing aggregate or to\nthe grand total of industries. Next to the sub-sectors of the manufacturing industry, bank\nlending also responds comparatively strongly to output growth in the finance industry and\nto inflation in the construction and energy sector. The finance, construction, and energy\nindustry and the sub-sectors of manufacturing have in common that the share of credit to\nthese sectors is comparatively small (cf. Table 3). Bank lending thus seems to be more\nresponsive to output growth and inflation in industries that only account for a small share of\na bank's loan portfolio. This in turn suggests that banks primarily re-distribute credit between\nindustries to which bank lending is relatively small and that the overall industry composition\nof a bank's loan portfolio is accordingly comparatively stable.\nOverall, the evidence illustrates that the use of bank-level data on lending to the grand total\nof industries (i.e., aggregate lending) only provides an imperfect view on the bank lending\neffects of credit demand and monetary policy. Our results indicate that the direction and\nstrength of aggregate bank lending effects depends on the industry structure of bank credit\nportfolios. This finding is particularly interesting for the definition of monetary policy as it\nshows that the effectiveness of monetary policy depends on industry structure.\n(ii) Are there Bank Lending Effects of Monetary Policy?\nSo far, the discussion has focused on the direct effects of monetary policy. This section\nanalyzes the empirical results for the interaction between bank characteristics and monetary\npolicy in order to identify the distributional effects of monetary policy on industry-specific\nbank lending. As will become evident, conclusions as to the existence of cross-bank differences\nin the interest rate response of bank lending are sensitive to the choice of bank asset size,\ncapitalization, liquidity, and short-term interbank claims.\nThe analysis of the interaction terms is subject to a shortcoming. As stated, the significance\nproperties of the interaction terms preclude tests regarding the relative contribution of indus-\ntries and banking groups as source of variation. Visual inspection of significant interaction\nterms points, however, to considerable differences in the sign and magnitude of the under-\nlying credit channel effects across industries as well as banking groups. The differences are\nsuch that a separate discussion of the coefficient estimates of all interaction terms is valuable\nin its own right. However, this is beyond scope given the large number of industry-specific\nbank lending models by bank characteristic, banking group, and loan maturity. We can only\nacknowledge that conclusions regarding the credit channel effects of monetary policy depend\non the choice of model specification and stress the interaction terms for short-term bank\nlending growth for the aggregate banking group.\nExisting studies question the usefulness of capitalization and liquidity as proxy variables of\nthe bank lending effects of monetary policy. Gambacorta and Mistrulli (2004) argue that\nthe capital-to-asset ratio is an inappropriate measure of bank capitalization. The reason is\nthat bank capital does not illustrate the riskiness of a bank's portfolio. It therefore does not\ncorrectly describe the severity of information asymmetries which, however, determines the\nability of banks to obtain non-reservable funding. Kashyap and Stein (2000) contemplate\nthat liquidity may provide a distorted view on the importance of bank balance sheet effects.\nThis is because liquidity is also determined by cash that banks cannot freely use since it is\nsubject to reserve requirements. Furthermore, Worms (2003) notes that bank lending reflects\nthe liquidity preferences of banks, with more liquid banks lending less. If this holds, cross-\nbank differences in the interest rate sensitivity of bank lending are not uniquely attributable to\ncross-bank differences in liquidity. We only mention these weaknesses associated with some\nbank characteristics, but do not control for them for two reasons. Firstly, the share of cash\nin total assets relative to other liquidity components is low. Secondly, quarterly data on the\nriskiness of capital are not available in the present dataset. Even though capitalization and\nliquidity might be imperfect identifiers of bank credit supply effects of monetary policy, we\nreport the results for these bank characteristics because we still assume that these variables\ninfluence the response of bank lending to interest rate changes.\nTable 7 contains the industry-specific bank lending effects of monetary policy associated with\ncross-bank differences in asset size, capitalization, liquidity, or short-term interbank claims.\nConclusions regarding the bank lending effects of monetary policy transmission are sensitive\nto the choice of bank characteristic and vary with the choice of industry. The evidence lends\nstrong support to the existence of bank size effects in monetary policy transmission. For the\ngrand total of industries and for almost all sampled industries, a monetary policy contraction\ncauses bank lending of large banks to adjust less than bank credit of small banks. That is,\nlarge banks are better able to insulate their lending activities against monetary-policy-induced\nchanges in the availability of reservable and non-reservable funds of finance. Inconsistent with\nthe credit channel theory, the interest rate response of bank lending to the finance industry is\nmore pronounced for large than for small banks. This finding possibly reflects the importance\nof commercial banks as source of lending to the finance industry (cf. Table 3) and the fact\nthat commercial banks are on average larger in terms of asset size than savings banks and\ncredit cooperatives (cf. Table 1). Insignificant effects are recorded in estimations for the\nconstruction and transport sector and for the non-metallic goods producing sector.\nIn contrast to bank asset size, cross-bank heterogeneities in capitalization do not explain\ncross-bank differences in the interest rate sensitivity of bank credit to the grand total of\nindustries and to most individual industries. The exception is lending to agriculture, finance,\nservices, and manufacturing. Except for the agricultural sector, better capitalized banks\nadjust lending less than poorly capitalized banks. The insignificance of bank capitalization\nlends support to the view that a risk-unadjusted measure of capitalization may imperfectly\napproximate the degree of information asymmetries.\nCross-bank asymmetries in the monetary policy response of bank lending to some industries\nare also attributable to cross-bank heterogeneities in the share of liquid assets. As discussed,\nthe liquidity effects of monetary policy are separately identified for a broad and narrow measure\nof liquidity and for short-term interbank claims in order to determine whether short-term\ninterbank claims affect the bank lending effects associated with liquidity. The evidence shows\nthat broad and/or narrow liquidity significantly attenuates the interest rate response of lending\nto the grand total of industries and to the agricultural, construction, trade, transport, textiles,\nand food industry. The evidence lends comparatively weak support to the role of short-term\ninterbank claims as determinant of the liquidity effects of monetary policy. Indeed, significant\nshort-term interbank effects are confined to very few industries: construction, trade, and\ntransport. This suggests that short-term interbank claims are a weak driving source of liquidity\neffects. In addition, because interbank claims are insignificant in explaining the interest rate\nresponse of credit supply to industries for which bank asset size possesses explanatory power,\nbank asset size appears to capture the bank lending effects of information asymmetries. That\nis, the evidence in the present study does not lend support to the finding of Worms (2003)\naccording to which interbank claims dwarf the effects associated with bank asset size.\nComparing the magnitude of the distributional effects of monetary policy, differences prevail\nacross bank characteristics. Indeed, cross-bank asymmetries in the interest rate response of\nbank lending are least pronounced for bank asset size and most pronounced for estimations\nwith bank capitalization and short-term interbank claims. The evidence hence reveals that\nbank size is not the main determinant of cross-bank differences in the response to monetary\npolicy changes. However, the relative importance of the capitalization effect should not be\noveremphasized because we define capitalization without correcting for bank risk. Besides\nthese results, the entries in Table 7 suggest that the strength of bank lending effects of\nmonetary policy differs between industries. In contrast to direct monetary policy effects,\nthe cross-industry differences appear to be unrelated to the relative weight of industries in a\nbank's credit portfolio.\nTable 7 also reports the one-period lags of the bank characteristics. Even though the co-\nefficients do not have an intrinsic meaning, they illustrate in combination with the direct\ninterest rate effect whether bank characteristics or monetary policy changes drive the sig-\nnificance of the interaction terms. The evidence tends to be mixed. For the grand total of\nindustries, the significance of the coefficient on the interest rate change and the short-run\nbank characteristic illustrates that the significance of the interaction term is attributable to\nthe direct bank lending effect of monetary policy and to cross-bank differences in any of\nthe bank characteristics. For the industry-specific bank lending functions, the distributional\neffects of monetary policy are determined by either monetary policy or bank characteristics,\nby both variables, or by none. For example, the significance of the interaction term on asset\nsize and capitalization in the estimation for total manufacturing is driven by the direct effect\nof monetary policy but not by bank characteristics. For the transport sector, the absence of\ncredit channel effects in estimations with asset size seem to be driven by asset size given the\nevidence in favor of significant interest rate effects.\nOverall, the evidence lends comparatively weak support to the transmission of monetary policy\nchanges through bank lending. The conclusions as to the bank lending effects of monetary\npolicy are sensitive to the choice of industry. This in turn points to the existence of industry\neffects of monetary policy through bank lending. In view of this finding, studies for the grand\ntotal of industries are likely to provide an incomplete view on the bank lending effects of\nmonetary policy.\n(iii) Cross-Study Comparison of the Results\nFor the grand total of industries, our evidence can be compared with that of existing studies.\nThe present results for the grand total of industries match those in Ehrmann et al. (2003) and\nWorms (2003) only partly. One possible source of divergence are differences in the definition\nof bank credit. While the earlier studies define bank credit for lending to households and\nthe grand total of industries, we do not include household lending.47 Another source of\nheterogeneity concerns the outlier adjustment procedure. Ehrmann et al. (2003) and Worms\n(2003) identify outliers by assuming the normal distribution of banks, while we allow for\nskews in the distribution. The studies thus define outliers along different lines, which leads\nto the exclusion of different observations. The most striking difference, however, concerns\nthe estimation methodology. Earlier studies estimate the dynamic panel model with GMM.\nWe find this estimator to be inapplicable. Neither for the long sample period 1992-2002\nidentifying restrictions for our set of GMM estimations. We do not estimate the model for\nthe short sample period with the fixed effects estimator because the finite sample bias would\nbe stronger.\nOur results are in line with those of Ehrmann et al. (2003) according to which bank lending\ngrows in response to output growth and inflation and declines in the wake of monetary\ncontraction. Furthermore, the present results are consistent with those in Ehrmann et al.\n(2003) according to which cross-bank differences in the interest rate sensitivity of aggregate\nbank credit cannot be attributed to differences in capitalization, but to differences in liquidity.\nHowever, the present study reports evidence that lends support to the existence of bank size\neffects in monetary policy transmission. In contrast to Worms (2003), the size effects are\nnot driven by interbank claims since they also prevail in estimations which do not control for\ninterbank claims.\n(iv) Synthesis\nSummarizing the results of the industry-specific bank lending functions, the evidence shows\nthat bank lending growth is industry specific, being driven by cyclical changes in industry\noutput growth and industry inflation and hence by factors of industry-specific bank credit\ndemand. We find significant differences in the bank lending effects of industry output growth,\nindustry inflation, and monetary policy changes between industries. Furthermore, regardless\nof the industry, the evidence lends weak support that banks differ in their lending response to\nmonetary policy changes. If at all, cross-bank differences in the monetary policy response of\nbank lending are primarily attributable to bank asset size effects. Overall, it appears that bank\n47Ehrmann et al. (2003) and Worms (2003) do not report evidence for short-term lending but for aggregate\nbank credit. Because our results for aggregate and short-term lending do not differ, we generalize our results\nwhen comparing them with earlier studies and do not make a distinction between short-term and aggregate\nlending.\nlending growth predominantly depends on bank credit demand and on the relative importance\nof industries in a bank's loan portfolio.\n6.4 Robustness Tests\nIn order to determine the robustness of the empirical findings, we modify the structure of\nthe benchmark specification (1) along several lines. Table C.1 in appendix C summarizes\nthe different models. To conserve on space, we only provide a verbal description of the\ncorresponding evidence.48 One set of estimations eliminates output growth and inflation from\nthe benchmark model to test whether industry demand factors dwarf the bank lending effects\nof monetary policy changes. The test is motivated by the evidence from the benchmark\nmodel according to which bank lending growth is predominantly determined by industry\noutput growth and industry inflation rather than by monetary policy. The results for the\nmodified model confirm those for the benchmark specification. We find the magnitude of\nthe direct monetary policy effects on bank lending to be in the range suggested by the\nbenchmark specification. The evidence in favor of credit channel effects of monetary policy\nthrough bank lending is still comparatively strong for asset size, but relatively weak for the\nremaining bank characteristics. Furthermore, the coefficient estimates from the augmented\nspecification closely resemble those from the benchmark model.\nAnother set of estimations re-estimates the benchmark model with more than one bank char-\nacteristic. One specification interacts each bank characteristic individually with monetary\npolicy (Table C.1, model B), while a second model interacts two bank characteristics with\neach other as well as with monetary policy (Table C.1, model C).49 We include more than\none bank characteristic simultaneously to control for the possibility that models with only\none bank characteristic report evidence that also captures the effects associated with other\ncharacteristics. More precisely, we take into account the likely interdependence between bank\nasset size and liquidity and bank capitalization and liquidity: large or better capitalized banks\nmight be more liquid than small or poorly capitalized banks. For Germany, the interdepen-\ndence may also extend to asset size and interbank claims. Worms (2003) and Ehrmann et\nal. (2003) have shown that interbank claims attenuate the effects of asset size and domi-\nnate the liquidity or capitalization effects of monetary policy. Although the present evidence\nillustrates that asset size explains the average interest rate response of banks in estimations\nwhich do not control for interbank claims, interbank claims may still capture part of the size\neffects. However, when including more than one bank characteristic, the models with single\n48The coefficient estimates for all robustness tests are available on request. Note, existing studies on the\nbank lending effects of monetary policy also test for the differential response of bank lending by eliminating\nthe effect of time-variant variables on bank lending with either time dummies or macroeconomic variables (cf.\ndummies since they capture the level effect of those variables we are particularly interested in, i.e., monetary\npolicy and the proxy variables of bank credit demand.\nand double interactions yield evidence which largely confirms the findings of the benchmark\nspecification. Bank lending growth is predominantly determined by bank credit demand and\nnot by monetary policy or the distributional effects of monetary policy. The strength of the\nunderlying effects significantly differs between industries.\nThe evidence from the model with more than one single interaction term (Table C.1, model\nB) suggests the independence of the effects associated with each single bank characteris-\ntic. For example, when significant, the effects associated with bank capitalization are still\ncomparatively strong, while bank size effects are relatively small. In fact, the strength of sig-\nnificant bank size, capitalization, liquidity, and interbank effects does not vary much between\nthe benchmark and augmented model. We therefore conclude that distributional effects of\nmonetary policy reveal size and capitalization effects which are not driven by interbank claims\nor bank liquidity. Similarly, interbank assets do not influence the evidence on bank liquidity\neffects. For most bank lending functions, interbank assets are statistically insignificant and\nbroad liquidity effects reflect the effects associated with narrow liquidity.\nThe model with double interaction terms (Table C.1, model C) tests whether cross-bank\ndifferences in the interest rate response of bank lending depend on the interdependence of\neffects associated with (i) interbank claims and either bank asset size, capitalization, or\nliquidity and (ii) liquidity and either bank asset size or capitalization. The hypothesis is that\nthe effect of interbank claims or liquidity on the interest rate response of bank lending is\nsmaller for large and better capitalized banks. Summarizing the results, we find the double\ninteraction terms to be statistically insignificant in almost all industry bank lending functions.\nThe only significant responses are recorded for estimations with interbank claims and either\nasset size, capitalization, or narrow liquidity. When significant, the evidence tends to be\ninconsistent with expectations: interbank effects on bank lending are smaller for (i) small\nbanks (machinery and transport equipment sector), (ii) poorly capitalized banks (electrical\nand optical equipment sector), and (iii) less liquid banks (construction, services, wood and\npaper producing sector). Anticipated relationships prevail for the grand total of industries.\nWe find the interbank effects of monetary policy on bank lending to be smaller for large\nbanks. In addition, interbank effects are smaller for liquid banks in estimations for the rubber\nand plastic and machinery and transport equipment sector.\nAs an alternative test we ask whether the results are sensitive to the way we define the\nexplanatory variables of the benchmark specification. The model in equation (1) includes\nindustry-specific bank lending, output, and inflation without weighing each of these compo-\nnents by the corresponding bank-specific aggregate. In expressing loans in absolute terms, we\nulsewig, Mayer, and Wollmersh\u00a8\nauser (2005), among others. In reality, banks\noperate portfolios, with lending to industry i being part of a diversification strategy. The rel-\native importance of industries in a bank's portfolio hence differs. In order to control for\ndifferences in the importance of industries, we redefine the industry-specific variables relative\nto the aggregate (Table C.1, model D). Doing so, we do not only control for differences in the\nrelative importance of industries, but also for structural breaks which result from redefinitions\nin the composition of industries. Furthermore, we can also control for the effect of those\nmergers which do not appear as outliers. When using ratios, merger-driven jumps in lending\nare ameliorated or even eliminated. The results do not differ qualitatively from those of the\nbenchmark specification: bank lending growth is determined by bank credit demand rather\nthan by monetary policy. Conclusions regarding the distributional effects of monetary policy\non bank lending do not differ much between the base and augmented specification.\nSo far, the robustness checks involve structural changes of the base specification, using\ncircumstances as caused by German re-unification. Particular to this process is above average\ncredit demand by all industries (cf. Deutsche Bundesbank, 1996). In order to assess the\nsensitivity of the results to re-unification effects, we also estimate the benchmark specification\nshorter time period do not differ qualitatively from those obtained for the longer time period.\nThe only exception is the manufacturing industry. In contrast to the long sample period, bank\nlending to this sector is predicted to expand in response to industry inflation and to contract in\nreaction to higher interest rates. Conclusions regarding the existence of bank lending effects\nof monetary policy also change for bank asset size. In contrast to the long sample, the interest\nrate response of bank lending does no longer decrease with asset size, but increases. The\nrelationships for output growth and the remaining bank characteristics do not change. The\nevidence for manufacturing is hence influenced by German re-unification. Visual inspection of\nthe data shows that the results are driven by differences in the time-series pattern of inflation\nwhile the share of short-term credit to manufacturing declined. Manufacturing prices only\nOverall, conclusions as to the response of bank lending to changes in monetary policy and\nbank credit demand are robust to alternative model specifications. Regardless of the model,\nwe find strong evidence that credit supply effects of monetary policy are small. Significant\ncross-industry differences still prevail, which demonstrates that the sensitivity of a bank's\ncredit portfolio to monetary policy changes or economic conditions clearly depends on the\nindustry composition of a credit portfolio.\n7 Conclusion\nThis paper has used a unique dataset with bank-level data on bank balance sheet items and\nbank industry lending to investigate the bank lending effects of bank credit demand and\nthe credit channel effects of monetary policy, we explicitly focused on the industry effects\nof bank lending and estimated bank lending functions for eight industries at the one-digit\nindustry level and for five sub-sectors of the manufacturing industry at the two-digit industry\nlevel. The bank lending functions were defined for aggregate and short-term lending and\nfor five individual banking groups. In line with existing studies, we used bank asset size,\ncapitalization, liquidity, and short-term interbank claims as proxy variables of cross-bank\ndifferences in the severity of information asymmetries.\nOur empirical findings lend strong support to the existence of industry effects of bank lending:\nindustries are the more important source of variation in the bank lending effects of bank credit\ndemand and monetary policy, with strong effects arising from industry output growth and\nindustry inflation. Banking group effects are comparatively weak. This in turn suggests that\nthe institutional setting of the German banking system might be a relatively unimportant\ndeterminant of bank lending growth. The evidence lends mixed support to the credit channel\ntheory according to which cross-bank differences in the interest rate response of bank lending\ncan be explained with cross-bank heterogeneities in bank asset size, capitalization, liquidity,\nand short-term interbank claims. Again, the conclusions are very sensitive to the choice\nof industry and also depend on the choice of bank characteristic and banking group. We\nconclude that the credit channel effects of monetary policy through bank lending are weak\nand that the industry composition of bank credit portfolios determines bank lending growth\nand - more important from an economic policy perspective - the effectiveness of monetary\npolicy.\nWe expect that the evidence in favor of industry effects of bank lending would also prevail\nin estimations which solve one major limitation of the present analysis. We estimated a\nreduced-form model which imposes the simplifying assumption that monetary policy does\nnot immediately affect bank credit demand, but only bank credit supply. That is, we do not\ncontrol for the sensitivity of loan demand to monetary policy changes. Of course, bank credit\ndemand is likely to respond to monetary policy changes because of, for example, balance\nsheet effects. Unfortunately, we can only acknowledge, but not address this shortcoming.\nAnnex A Data Sources and Descriptions\nThe following overview lists the industries for which data on economic activity and prices are\ncompiled. The second column labels the industry as it will be abbreviated throughout the\npaper.\nIndustry Abbreviation Source\nGrand total NC\nMining and quarrying; Electricity, gas, and water supply Energy NC\nTotal manufacturing NC\nFood products, beverages and tobacco Food NC\nTextiles and textile products Textiles NC\nWood and products of wood and cork Wood NC\nPulp, paper, paper products, printing, and publishing Paper NC\nCoke, refined petroleum products, and nuclear fuel Coke NC\nChemicals and chemical products Chemicals NC\nRubber and plastics products Rubber and plastic NC\nOther non-metallic mineral products Non-metallic mineral NC\nBasic metals and fabricated metal products Metals NC\nMachinery and equipment, n.e.c.

An aggregation of sectors is necessitated by the definition of industry sectors in the\nBundesbank borrower statistics. The following industries are treated as a single unit: (i)\nwood and paper; (ii) coke and chemicals; (iii) machinery and transport equipment.\nWith few exceptions, monthly data on the industry production index and industry price\nindex are compiled from the New Cronos database of Eurostat (NC). The monthly data\nare converted into quarterly data. Industry data on agriculture, services, wholesale and retail\ntrade, finance and insurance, and transport and communication are obtained from the German\nstatistical office (GSO).\nData on bank characteristics are compiled from the Bundesbank's monthly bank balance\nsheet statistics. The following variables are used:\n\u00b7 Total assets (TA)\n\u00b7 Bank capital (K)\n\u00b7 Liquidity (A)\nBank capital includes subscribed capital, reserves, capital represented by participation rights\nand the fund for general banking risk. Liquidity is defined as the sum of cash; balances with\nthe central banks; treasury bills, treasury certificates, and similar debt instruments issued\nby public authorities (eligible for refinancing); debt securities; shares and other variable-yield\nsecurities; claims on credit institutions with an agreed maturity or redeemable at notice of\none year or less (short-term interbank claims).50\nData on bank-specific lending to eight main industries and nine sub-sectors of the manufactur-\ning industry are compiled from the quarterly borrower statistics of the Deutsche Bundesbank.\n50The determinants of liquidity are ranked according to liquidity. From the top to the bottom, liquidity\ndeclines. See B\u00a8\nAnnex B Variable Description\nThe vector of bank characteristics Xb\nin equation (1) includes variables related to bank\nefficiency and profitability: total assets (TA), liquidity (A), and bank capital (K). In line\nwith existing studies (cf. Ehrmann et al., 2003; Gambacorta and Mistrulli, 2004; Worms,\n2003), the level of bank-specific capital Capb\n, broad liquidity Bliqb\n, narrow liquidity Nliqb\n,\nand short-term interbank claims Ibkb\nis normalized with respect to the average across all\nbanks and time according to\nCapbt\n=\nKbt\nTAbt\n-\nT\nT\nNb\nNb\nKbt\nTAbt\nBliqbt\n=\nAbt\nTAbt\n-\nT\nT\nNb\nNb\nAbt\nTAbt\nNliqbt\n=\nAbt\n- Ibkbt\nTAbt\n-\nT\nT\nNb\nNb\nAbt\n- Ibkbt\nTAbt\nIbkbt\n=\nIbkbt\nTAbt\n-\nT\nT\nNb\nNb\nIbkbt\nTAbt\nrespectively. The bank characteristics are expressed in terms of total assets to de-trend these\nseries. To this end, we assume that bank capitalization, liquidity, and interbank claims follow\nsimilar trends as asset size. Total assets (TA) are also normalized with respect to the mean\nacross all banks, but de-trending requires the normalization for each single data point. This\nyields the following measure of bank asset size\nSizebt\n= logTAbt\n-\nNb\nNb\nlogTAbt\nNormalization with respect to the average across all banks means that the indicator variables\nSize, Cap, Bliq, Nliq, and Ibk sum to zero over all observations. Because of this property, the\ninteraction terms in equation (1) in the main text are on average equal to zero. In addition,\nthe coefficient estimate 1j\ndirectly reflects the average effect of monetary policy on bank\ncredit growth.\nAnnex C Alternative Model Specifications\nTable C.1 summarizes the main differences between the benchmark model and the alternative\nmodel specifications.\nTable C.1: Summary of Model Specifications\nBenchmark Model\nAugmented Model A\nAugmented Model B\nModel 1: SIT for Size, Cap, Bliq,\nModel 2: SIT for Size, Cap, Nliq,\nModel 3: SIT for Size, Cap, Ibk,\nModel 4: SIT for Size, Cap, Ibk, Nliq.\nAugmented Model C\nModel 1: DIT for Size, Ibk,\nModel 2: DIT for Cap, Ibk,\nModel 3: DIT for Nliq, Ibk.\nModel 4: DIT for Size, Cap.\nAugmented Model D\nmodel (see equation C.1).\nAugmented Model E\nIn order to control for the relative importance of industries in a bank's portfolio relative to the\naggregate (panel D in Table C.1), the benchmark specification in equation (1) is rewritten as\n\nLbi,t\nLb,t\n= b\n+\np\nij\n\nLbi,t-j\nLb,t-j\n+\np\nrM,t-j\n+\np\n\nIPi,t-j\nIPt-j\n+\np\n\nPricei,t-j\nPricet-j\n+\n+\np\nrM,t-j\n+ bi,t\nAnnex D Tables\nN Mean Stdev Skew.
