    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe aim of this study was to define neurodiversity in a scientific manner so it can be researched in further studies without\ninvolving disorders defined by psychiatry or popular beliefs about neurodiversity in the autistic community. Neurodiversity\nwas defined as the primary factor output by factor analysis of a data set of human behaviors which contains evenly distributed\ntraits of all sorts that cover all of human diversity. Neurotypical function was defined as the second factor. The study used\nmany different traits and a large sample to find the full extent of neurodiversity, and to provide evenly distributed traits. The\nresult was a test with 145 scoring items and 5 control items that could give participants a neurodiverse and a neurotypical\nscore, and an indication that the participant was neurodiverse, neurotypical, or mixed. It was found that the neurodiversity\nscore was independent of gender and age, and that the prevalence appears to have remained unchanged. There were\npossible differences in racial prevalence that need further research. The results correlated to many disorders defined by\npsychiatry, and also with several factors in personality tests. People who had been diagnosed with these disorders had\nconsiderably higher neurodiversity scores. The idea that neurodiversity was at the extreme end of a normal distribution was\nnot supported, rather it was found that neurodiversity had its own normal distribution overlapping typical traits.\n",

Instead, this literature primarily deals with disorders\ndefined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American\nASDs are diagnosed based on difficulties in communica-\ntion and social domains. Notably these involve a priori\nassumptions about species-typical behavior. However, our\nliving environment has changed considerable in the last hun-\ndred years. Evolution is ongoing but still, recent research has\nshown that urban upbringing causes mood and anxiety disor-\nders, as well as Schizophrenia (Lederbogen et al., 2011).\nMood and anxiety disorders are frequent comorbidities to\nASDs. There is also a hypothesis that autism might be an\n\"Intense World Syndrome\" (Markram, Rinaldi, & Markram,\n2007). It is claimed that ASD diagnoses has increased\nrecently (Centers for Disease Control, 2008), and these find-\nings might account for part or all of this recent increase in\ndiagnosis.\nRegarding causes for autism, theories of imbalanced\ngenomic imprinting (Badcock & Crespi, 2006), neurological\ndamage (Eigsti & Shapiro, 2003), and genetic defects\n(Mendelsohn & Schaefer, 2008) have been proposed. Few of\nthe theories are mutually compatible, and most of them focus\nonly on narrow aspects of the autism spectrum. Some\nresearchers have interpreted this diagnostic elusiveness as\n1Independent Researcher\nCorresponding Author:\nEmail: leif@rdos.net\nAutism, Personality, and Human\nDiversity: Defining Neurodiversity in an\nIterative Process Using Aspie Quiz\nLeif Ekblad1\n Keywords\nautism, neurodiversity, personality, experimental psychology, psychology, social sciences, psychiatry, behavioral sciences,\nfactor analysis\n2 SAGE Open\nevidence that there is no single explanation for autism\nSo far genetic and epigenetic studies have only managed to\nexplain 10% to 20% of all autism cases, many of which seem\nto involve clusters of copy number variations (CNVs). No sin-\ngle mutation could account for more than 1% of autism, mak-\ning it etiologically very heterogeneous (Geschwind, 2009).\nEpigenetic factors may play a role in the development of the\nautistic phenotype. A large twin study concluded that suscepti-\nbility toASD is moderately heritable and involves a substantial\nshared twin environmental component (Hallmayer et al., 2011).\nThe substantial environmental component to ASD susceptibil-\nity is likely the result of the referral bias inherent in any dys-\nfunction-based model used to diagnose ASD. Furthermore,\nASD, ADHD, and other neuropsychiatric disorders seem to\nshare a common genetic origin (Lionel et al., 2011).\nSupport for the neurodiversity concept comes from a\nrecent genome-wide analysis study (Voineagu et al., 2011).\nThe study found that discrete, coexpressed gene modules are\nassociated with autism but not single genes. More than 200\ngenes were expressed differently in autistic compared with\nnonautistic brains. Furthermore, these genes regulate the\ndevelopmental patterning of the frontal cortex and temporal\ncortex.\nEven less studied, due to complexity, is the relationship\nbetween autism and other personality traits. Mathematical\nabilityhasbeenlinkedtoautism(Baron-Cohen,Wheelwright,\nBurtenshaw, & Hobson, 2007) and autistic traits have been\nsuspected to be an independent personality dimension\n(Wakabayashi, Baron-Cohen, & Wheelwright, 2006).\nWhile the initial reason for the research was related to a\nspecific hypothesis about the cause of neurodiversity, the\naim of this presentation is to remain open regarding the\ncauses of ASD and neurodiversity, while still wanting to\nremove cultural and environmental issues as much as possi-\nble. It was anticipated that a large part of several high-preva-\nlence disorders defined in the DSM, and typically thought to\nbe part of neurodiversity, could be explained in terms of\nhuman diversity rather than as dysfunctions. Unlike other\nresearch that specifically focuses on the disability aspect of\nASD, this study did not evaluate traits according to their pos-\nsible contribution to disability.\nNeurodiversity today is defined in an arbitrary way as\nDSM diagnoses are. This research defined neurodiversity as\nthe primary factor output by factor analysis of a data set of\nhuman behaviors which contains evenly distributed traits of\nall sorts that cover all of human diversity. Neurotypical wir-\ning was defined as the second factor. This provided a scien-\ntific definition that could be used in replication. The main\nproblem in providing a test that can score neurodiversity and\nneurotypical wiring using these definitions was to find the\nfull span of the neurodiversity spectrum, and to ensure that\nthe traits used were as independent as possible while still\nbeing relevant. This required a very large population being\ngiven a large set of questions.\nMethod\nThe primary hypothesis in this study was that factor analy-\nsis of a broad ASD-related test would generate two consis-\ntent factors that could be used to score neurodiversity and\nneurotypical wiring. The tool used in the research (Aspie\nQuiz) was developed in an iterative process in six different\nphases.\nInvestigation Phase\nThis was the first phase in the iterative process of creating a\nneurodiversity test. The objective was to create a reliable test\nfor the autism spectrum, and then to find as many traits as\npossible that correlated to the reliable test.\nInformation about year of birth, gender, and diagnostic\nstatus (no diagnosis, self-diagnosed, or professionally diag-\nnosed) for AS/HFA/PDD (Asperger's syndrome, high func-\ntioning autism, and pervasive development disorder) and\nADD/ADHD (attention deficit disorder, with or without\nhyperactivity) was collected in all versions. In some ver-\nsions, diagnostic status for autism, dyslexia, dyscalculia,\ndyspraxia, bipolar, schizophrenia, Tourette, oppositional\ndefiant disorder (ODD), and nonverbal learning disorder\n(NLD) have been collected.\nthe dual-factor nature of Aspie Quiz was first eminent.\nAutomatic score calculation and relevance estimation was\ndeveloped after this, and gave a list of 485 items and their\nrelevance estimates and factor loadings. Versions that did not\noriginally use factor analysis for score calculation were\nrecalculated to be able to use the items (and factor loadings)\nin later analysis.\nConsolidation Phase\nThis was the second phase. The objective was to find the best\nitems from the investigation phase and to create a stable core\nwith these items. The versions were labeled R1 to R7.\nData collection started in February 2007. There was a\nneed to iterate the item selection process in seven steps\nbefore a stable core emerged. This phase generated rele-\nvance estimates and factor loadings for 50 items in the\nAutism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) test and for another 211\nitems.\nValidation Phase\nThis was the third phase. The objective was to test (and\nrefine) the stable core of items from the consolidation phase\nby adding various professional psychiatric instruments. The\nversions were labeled S1 to S12.\nData collection started in June 2007. This phase tested\nand produced relevance estimates and factor loadings for 405\nnew items.\nDiagnostic Phase\nThis was the fourth phase. The objective was to try to pro-\nvide diagnostic advice to participants. The versions were\nData collection started in January 2008. There was a high\ndependence between the selected target diagnoses. This\nmade differential diagnosis impossible, that is, some partici-\npants got every possible diagnosis as an advice, while others\ngot none. For differential diagnosis, one would need to\ninclude negative aspects of the target diagnoses.\nFinal Phase 1\nThis was the fifth phase. The objective was to produce a final\nversion. Final Version 1 existed in 16 different releases (F1-F15\nand FI). In some of these releases, the most promising instru-\nments from the item selection phase were run once more. This\nwas to get correlations that were guaranteed to be against the\nsame item selection. A few new instruments were also tested.\nThe combined Final Version 1 data set was constructed by\ncombining all English language answers to 16 different\nreleases of Final Version 1.\nFinal Version 1 was launched in mid-April 2008 and run\nFinal Phase 2\nIn the sixth phase, a second final version (Final Version 2)\nwas created to have six identical dimensions on the Aspie\nand neurotypical sides in the spider diagram that presented\nscores to participants (see below).\nDifferent releases of Final Version 2 existed to test new\nitems. The core always had the same 145 scoring items and\n5 control items. Different releases saved results in different\ndatabase tables.\nThe Final Version 2 data set was created by combining\nFinal Version 2 releases.\nIn this phase information about year and month of birth,\ngender, country, ancestry, and diagnostic status (no diagnosis,\nself-diagnosed, or professionally diagnosed) for AS/HFA/\nPDD and ADD/ADHD, OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive\nDisorder), and Social Phobia were collected.\nFinal Version 2 was launched in late October 2009 and\nUsed items and their properties are presented as supplemen-\ntary information (see supplementary table, available in the\nonline version of this article at http://sgo.sagepub.com/\nsupplemental).\nDuring the peer-review process, data collection contin-\nversion used the Final Version 2 items.\nRecruiting Participants\nLinks to a Swedish and English Aspie Quiz version were ini-\ntially posted to a few selected autism community sites (Aspie\nforum Yahoo group, http://www.aspiesforfreedom.com, and\nhttp://www.wrongplanet.net). A year later, many people had\nrecommended Aspie Quiz and had posted links to many dif-\nferent sites. The continued recruitment process depended on\nAspie Quiz becoming a popular self-test on autism commu-\nnity forums. Many people added links to their blogs or live\njournals. Some people posted links to very popular general-\ndiscussion forums.\nUser Account Registration\nUser accounts were introduced in the validation phase (ver-\nsion S2). A user id was stored with all answers from version\nParticipation\nThe referral report for the Final Version 1 contains 229 dif-\nferent links that 10 or more participants had used to do Aspie\nQuiz. Aspie Quiz attracted on average 300 participants a day\nfrom many different locations. The test can easily be found\nwith search engines and Google returns 62,200 hits for\n\"Aspie Quiz.\" Participation was neither controlled, nor\nrandom.\nData Analysis\nFactor analysis was done with MVSP (Multivariate Statistic\nPackage, Kovach Computing Services). Kaiser's rule was\nused to extract factors. The standardize data option was\nchecked so rarer traits gained increased significance. The\ncenter data option was not checked. Unanswered items were\nset to 0. There were no attempts to remove duplicate answers\nin the database, but up to the validation phase each IP address\ncould only enter a single answer.\nDataFit was used to try to match the score difference dis-\ntribution to different mathematical functions. DataFit\nincludes a bell curve distribution function, but this function\nprovided poor fits to the score distribution. Some distribu-\ntions looked like two overlapping bell curves, and therefore\na dual bell curve formula was introduced in DataFit (a \u00d7\nexp((-(x - b)2) / (2 \u00d7 c2)) + d \u00d7 exp((-(x - e)2) / (2 \u00d7 f2)) + g).\nItem Selection\nLorelei based on our personal experience, on characteriza-\ntion by Martha Kate Downey (Downey), Roger Meyers\n(Meyer), and Tony Attwood (Attwood), and on items bor-\nrowed (but reworded) from the AQ questionnaire (Baron-\nCohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, & Clubley, 2001).\n4 SAGE Open\nIn the investigation phase, the aim was to test as much as\npossible that could be related to neurodiversity, as this was\nrequired by the definition of neurodiversity. New items\nmostly came from online discussions and polls on autism\ncommunity forums like http://www.wrongplanet.net and\nhttp://www.aspiesforfreedom.com.\nItems from the investigation phase were used as a starting\npoint for selecting the most unique and relevant items possi-\nble in the consolidation phase. The method used for selecting\nthe most relevant and unique items was based on two differ-\nent reports. The first report was based on all items that had\npreviously been tested, but that was not part of the current\nitem selection. It listed a number of these items with the low-\nest correlations with all other items along with their rele-\nvance estimates. The second report used items in the current\nitem selection. It listed which of the current items had the\nhighest dependence, presenting items in pairs, with their rel-\nevance estimates.\nAs the neurodiversity definition required evenly distrib-\nuted traits, the goal was to create a heterogeneous set of\nitems. The elimination criterion was to throw out items that\nwere most similar to others, but among those that were simi-\nlar, the most relevant were selected and the ones that dis-\ncriminated least well between Aspies and neurotypicals were\neliminated. Some of the added items were removed again\nbecause there already existed similar items in the instrument\nthat hadn't been tested together before. The selection method\nadded items with the lowest correlations to other items, so\nthat Aspie Quiz would cover the widest possible range of\ntraits with the fewest possible items.\nTwo additional reports were also used in the item selec-\ntion process. One of these listed percentage of \"?\" answers\nfor items in the current item selection. Too high percentages\nof \"?\" answers indicated an item was hard to answer for par-\nticipants, and items with above 10% of \"?\" answers were\ngenerally not considered acceptable. The other report listed\nwell-known environmental problems. The goal was to elimi-\nnate environmental problems, and therefore a group of items\nwith known environmental background was used in the\ninstrument as a reference to be able to spot and eliminate\nitems with high correlations to them.\nIn the validation phase, various professional psychiatric\ninstruments were added to try to find new relevant items and\nto assess correlations between instrument scores and Aspie\nQuiz scores. A new report was created to find new relevant\nitems and to discard similar items. This report listed the items\nin the current version. For each listed item, it listed all items\nin the current version that had a correlation with the item that\nexceeded 90% of the listed item's relevance estimate. This\nrelied on an empirical finding of a linear relationship between\nan item's relevance estimate and average correlation with\nother items (Figure 1). Without this method, the requirement\nin the neurodiversity definition of evenly distributed traits\nwould not be met. The cutoff at 90% was an empirical finding\nthat provided good results. Items from the professional\npsychiatric instruments were included in this report. After\nnew items from the professional instruments had been tested\nin the instrument, items that looked promising (high relevance\nestimate and low correlation to other items) were added as\nexperimental items in the next version.\nControl Items, Ordering, and Uncertain Response\nControl items were introduced in the validation phase. They\nwere selected among existing item pairs that had large nega-\ntive correlations (typically in the range of -.55 to -.65).\nFive pairs of control items were added early in the valida-\ntion phase. These items were designed such that one of the\nitems in the pair would normally be answered positively by\nAspies while the other would normally be answered posi-\ntively by neurotypicals. When somebody answered both\nitems with \"yes\" or \"no,\" this was considered as a control\nitem inconsistency. Participants were allowed to answer no\nmore than one item inconsistently. This arrangement made it\nimpossible to receive high or low scores just by checking\n\"yes\" or \"no\" on all items.\nStarting in the validation phase, items were presented in\nrandom order to ensure that people didn't know the objective\nof items by looking at nearby items. This also mixed up con-\ntrol items with ordinary items.\nThe \"?\" (I don't know) choice was checked by default to\ndetect unanswered items. Posting answers with too many \"?\"\nchoices was disallowed by requiring a total Aspie and neuro-\ntypical weight sum of at least 200 (see also below).\nScoring\nAspie Quiz had three answer alternatives: \"no\" (score 0),\n\"sometimes\" (score 1), and \"yes\" (score 2). It also had a \"?\"\n(don't know) alternative. When the \"?\" alternative was\nchecked, the item would not be part of scoring. This was\nFigure 1. Average correlation with other questions versus\nrelevance estimate for all questions.\nachieved by producing a total weighted score of answered\nitems (sum of weight factors multiplied by scores), dividing\nthis by the maximum possible score (sum of weight factors\nmultiplied by 2) and finally multiplying it by 200. This pro-\ncedure was used for the Aspie score and the neurotypical\nscore separately.\nFactor loadings were used for score calculation from the\nmiddle of the investigation phase. This resulted in two differ-\nent scores based on factor loadings: Aspie score and neuro-\ntypical score. Aspie score was based on the primary\n(neurodiversity) factor and neurotypical (nonautistic) score\non the secondary factor of Principal Components Analysis\n(PCA). The average of an item's factor loading in all ver-\nsions the item had been part of was used. These factor load-\nings were multiplied by 100 and rounded to integers and\ngave the Aspie and neurotypical weight factors for items in\nthe instrument. To increase span of scores, if Aspie weight\nfactor and neurotypical weight factor were positive, the\nlower weight factor was replaced by zero and the higher\nweight factor was replaced by the difference between weight\nfactors.\nParticipants got the judgment \"very likely Aspie\" (neuro-\ndiverse) if their Aspie score was at least 35 points higher than\ntheir neurotypical score, and \"very likely neurotypical\" (neu-\nrotypical) if their neurotypical score was at least 35 points\nhigher than their Aspie score. The interval in-between was\njudged as \"both Aspie and neurotypical traits\" (mixed). The\ncutoff was set to 35 late in the investigation phase so that\n80% of diagnosed AS/HFA/PDD would get their diagnoses\nconfirmed.\nCalculating Relevance Estimate for Items\nIn the investigation phase,Aspie Quiz asked for self-reported\ndiagnostic information about AS/HFA/PDD. As it was\npointed out to all subjects that the data were analyzed anony-\nmously and people were taking part voluntarily, this self-\nreport was seen as sufficient for classifying subjects into\nAspie control group. The neurotypical control group was\nconstructed based on the referral information that web\nbrowsers send back to a website. Referral sites unrelated to\nautism were included in the neurotypical control group. The\nAspie control group and neurotypical control group allowed\ncalculating the relevance estimates for each item.\nIn the middle of the investigation phase, scoring was\nchanged to use factor loadings. From then on, participants\nwere grouped based on the total instrument scores.\nParticipants that got \"very likely Aspie\" were assigned to the\nAspie (neurodiverse) group while participants that got \"very\nlikely neurotypical\" were assigned to the neurotypical group.\nThe relevance estimate for an item was calculated as the cor-\nrelation between answers from these groups. The neurotypi-\ncal control group based on referrer sites, and self-reported\ndiagnostic information was no longer needed for relevance\nestimation, and was only used as a sanity check.\nComparing With Other Instruments\nThe AQ (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) was used to validate item\nselection in the consolidation phase. It was run as voluntary\nin experimental version 4 (R4).\nIn the validation phase, the following professional instru-\nments were used to validate Aspie Quiz and to do a prelimi-\nnary check for the relation to neurodiversity:\n1. SPQ-A, Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, that\nwas developed in 1991 by Adrian Raine, Department\nof Psychology, University of Southern California, Los\nAngeles. The test measures schizotypal traits in\nadults. Its validity and factor structure have been\nchecked (Axelrod, Grilo, Sanislow, & McGlashan,\n2. LSAS, Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, that was\ndeveloped by M. R. Liebowitz. The test measures\nsocial phobia. Its psychometric properties have been\nchecked (Heimberg et al., 1999). It was run as volun-\ntary in stable version 4 (S4).\n3. MDQ, Mood Disorder Questionnaire (Hirschfeld\net al., 2000). The test measures Bipolar traits and was\nrun as voluntary in stable version 8 (S8).\n4. The General Adult ADD Symptom Checklist that was\ndeveloped in 1995 by Dr. Daniel Amen, University of\nCalifornia, Irvine School of Medicine (unpublished).\nThe test measures ADD symptoms in adults. It was\nrun as voluntary in stable version 9 (S9).\n5. Vinegrad RevisedAdult Dyslexia Checklist (Vinegrad,\n1994). The test measures dyslexia in adults. It was run\nas voluntary in stable version 10 (S10).\n6. Tourette Syndrome Diagnostic Confidence Index\n(Robertson et al., 1999) was modified for self-assess-\nment. The test is used to identify Tourette syndrome\nin a life-perspective and gives a score proportional to\nseverity. It was run as voluntary in stable version 11\n7. The Giftedness in Adults test that was developed by\nLinda Kreger Silverman, the Gifted Development\nCenter (unpublished), was run as voluntary in stable\n8. The Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26; Garner, Olmsted,\nBohr, & Garfinkel, 1982). The test measures eating\ndisorders and was run as voluntary in neurodiversity\nIn Final Version 1, the following professional instruments\nwere used to check the relation to neurodiversity:\n1. AQ was run as voluntary in F1.\n2. The short version of International Personality Item\nPool Representation of the NEO (IPIP NEO) that was\ndeveloped by Dr. John A. Johnson, Professor of\nPsychology, Penn State University. Scoring\n6 SAGE Open\nalgorithms and factor loadings were acquired by per-\nsonal communication. The test is a Big Five type per-\nsonality test. It was run as voluntary in F2.\n3. SPQ-A was run as mandatory in F6.\n4. The General Adult ADD Symptom Checklist was run\nas mandatory in F7.\n5. LSAS was run as mandatory in F8.\n6. Tourette Syndrome Diagnostic Confidence Index\nwas run as mandatory in F9.\n7. Vinegrad Revised Adult Dyslexia Checklist was run\nas mandatory in F10.\n8. EQ,EmpathyQuotient(Baron-Cohen&Wheelwright,\nGrouping Traits\nInitially, a particular item's relation to a group was calculated\nby averaging intercorrelations to items in a group for the\nitem checked, excluding self-correlation. A report was used\nthat listed the correlation for all presently used items to all\npresently used groups. The highest correlations (up to 90%\nof the highest correlation) were listed in a particular color,\nwhich made it easier to see misplaced items. This method\nwas effective when most of the items were already placed in\nconsistent groups, but often failed when novel groupings\nwere attempted.\nTo remedy this, a new method using a different approach\nto factor analysis was developed to aid in creating novel\ngroups. The raw material used was changed so that items\nwith higher scores in the neurotypical group were inverted (a\n0 score become a 2 score and the reverse). In the factor anal-\nysis program, data were centered to remove as much as pos-\nsible of the primary factors related to neurodiversity. In this\nconfiguration, the primary factor only explained about 22%\nof the variance, and the secondary explained 3%, giving a\nmuch better material for finding subfactors in the material.\nTo be relevant for the current groups, the factors were rotated\nto maximize loadings on presently used groups. Using these\nmaximized factor loadings, an item's relation to a group\ncould be calculated and presented in an updated report that\nused a mixture of the methods. These factor loadings were\nalso used to calculate group scores for participants.\nGrouping of traits started with some arbitrary groups\nbased on diagnostic categories. After discovering the dual-\nfactor nature of the data set, it became desirable to try to\ngroup traits in symmetrical Aspie and neurotypical groups.\nAfter the spider diagram was introduced in the validation\nphase, which has anAspie and neurotypical side, this became\neven more desirable. This aim was realized with Final\nVersion 2 when the Aspie social group was finally con-\nstructed and validated to be reasonably consistent.\nEthical Issues\nThe research followed principles in human research accord-\ning to the Helsinki Declaration. As the study was performed\nindependent of an institution, there was no institutional\nreview board available. To comply with applicable ethical\nrequirements on research on human subjects, the study was\nconstructed in such a way that participants could not be iden-\ntified. Participants got informed about the objectives of the\nstudy, and had to indicate they accepted this before they\ncould fill out the survey.\nInitially, the following text was presented to partici-\npants: \"The goal of this test is to evaluate neurodiversity\ntraits in people with formal neuropsychiatric diagnosis\nand self-diagnosed neurodiverse people to compare them\nwith people in the general population. The goal is to sur-\nvey traits that currently are not believed to be part of the\nneurodiversity/autism-spectrum. The goal is also to pub-\nlish the result of the evaluation in a scientific journal.\nYour answers will be saved in a database. To avoid mul-\ntiple answers from the same person, IP-addresses will be\nsaved in a separate table, without a link to the quiz results.\nEach IP could only enter one answer into the database. To\nget to the quiz you must accept that your answers are\nsaved.\"\nAfter removing the requirement to save IP addresses to\navoid multiple answers, and no longer doing research on new\ntraits, the text was changed to \"Statistics/results are saved in\na database. The statistics might be published, used as\nresearch-data or checked in order to calibrate the test. We do\nnot save IP addresses or other personal information.\"\nResults\nFactor Stability\nA central issue in the construction of Aspie Quiz was the sta-\nbility of the factors used for scoring. These factors were\nrequired to be highly stable. Factor congruence coefficients\nwere calculated for the two first factors of PCA (neurodiver-\nsity and neurotypical factor). Factor congruence coefficients\nbetween phases are presented in Table 1. It can be seen that\nAspie Quiz converged as average factor congruence coeffi-\ncients approached and exceed .99. In the final version, factor\ncongruence coefficients between releases, and even with dif-\nferent sets of items, are much larger than for instance factor\ncongruence coefficients between genders (Figure 2a) or age\ngroups (Figure 2b). This shows that the item selection pro-\ncess was completed. Even in the very first versions, factor\ncongruence coefficients between disparate item selections\nwere high.\nFactor Analysis Results\nThe 95% confidence interval for explained variance for all\nfor the third factor. Analyzing males and females separately\ngave overlapping 95% confidence intervals. Explained vari-\nance for neurodiversity factor was correlated .71 to male\nneurodiversity rate (percentage of males that got \"very likely\nAspie\"). Explained variance for neurotypical factor was cor-\nrelated .62 with number of items that neurotypicals scored\nhigher on.\nIn the final phase, the neurodiversity and neurotypical\nfactor loadings had no correlation, the neurodiversity and\nthird factor loadings had a .5 correlation, and the neurotypi-\ncal and third factor loadings had no correlation.\nConnections Between Measures\nExplained variance seemed to relate to male neurodiversity\nrate and to the number of neurotypical items. Another rela-\ntion was between neurodiversity rate (and especially the\nmale rate, but also the female and overall) and explained\nvariance for neurodiversity factor. There were also relations\nbetween number of neurotypical items and factor analysis\nresults, primarily explained variance for neurotypical factor,\nbut also for factor congruence coefficients. This indicates\nthat too few neurotypical items degrade factors.\nAverage Scores\nAverage scores per gender in Final Version 1 were Aspie\nscore 94 and neurotypical score 109 for males, and Aspie\nAverage scores per gender in Final Version 2 were Aspie\nscore 93 and neurotypical score 113 for males, and Aspie\nneurotypical scores had a -.96 correlation.\nNote, by checking the middle alternative on all items, a\nparticipant would get Aspie score 100 and neurotypical score\nScore Distribution Approximations\nFigure 3 show the score difference (Aspie score \u00ad neuro-\ntypical score) distributions for all participants.

Scores do not seem to be normally distributed.\nAttempting to match score distributions with a single bell\ncurve provided poor results. Instead, it seemed like the\nscore distributions were composed of two independent\noverlapping bell curves.\nThe best match for the total data set gave 99.7%\nexplained variance for 10th-order polynomial, 99.4% for\ndual bell curve, and 91.1% for single bell curve. For the\ntotal diagnosed AS/HFA/PDD population, it gave 98.2%\nfor 10th-order polynomial, 98.1% for dual bell curve, and\n92.6% for single bell curve. The average explained vari-\nance for all answers in 32 individual versions were 90.8%\nfor 10th-order polynomial, 90.3% for dual bell curve, and\n79.6% for single bell curve. Conservative estimate and the-\noretical considerations (see \"Discussion\" section) favor the\ndual bell curve.\nScore Stability\nFigure 4 shows score difference for registered users who did\nAspie Quiz twice. Most registered users have a small score\ndifference, but there are some outliers that seemed to have\nmanipulated their results.\nWhen analyzing all registered users who did Aspie Quiz\ntwice, the average Aspie score difference was 17.1 and the\naverage neurotypical score difference was 17.6.

There were 18,639 answers saved by regis-\ntered users. In all, 14,916 users had only entered a single\nanswered more than twice. This means that 7.4% of the reg-\nistered users had done Aspie Quiz more than once. As the\nreason for registering a user account was to be able to follow\nup on score stability, this should be an upper limit for how\nmany answers are from the same individual.\nGroups\nGrouping of traits ended up with six symmetrical groups on\nthe Aspie (neurodiverse) and neurotypical side. The groups\nwere talent, compulsion, social, communication, hunting,\nand perception. Figure 5 shows a typical Aspie profile in the\nspider diagram used to present results to participants.\nPrevalence of Neurodiversity\nBecause of the way participants were recruited, it was not\npossible to directly calculate prevalence of neurodiversity in\nthe general population. Rate of neurodiversity in the final\nversion was around 30% for males and around 40% for\nfemales. Some referrer links recorded in Aspie Quiz with\nmany participants showed as low rates as 10% to 15%. A\nguess is that the rate in the general population might be 10%\nto 15%. The much higher average scores in the total popula-\ntion is indicative that participants' own feelings about being\ndifferent was an important factor when people decided to do\nAspie Quiz or not.\nFigure 4. Score difference distribution based on registered\nusers who did Aspie Quiz twice. Figure 5. An example of an Aspie profile in the spider diagram.\nFigure 6 shows that most participants were young males.\nThe age distribution seemed similar to how the number of\nASD diagnoses had increased during recent years (King &\nBearman, 2009). The primary group that took Aspie Quiz\nwas young people, presumably because of increased aware-\nness and that most people diagnosed with ASD are young.\nFigure 7 shows the neurodiversity rate per gender and\nbirth year (5-year intervals). The neurodiversity rate seems\nto be stable and not related to year of birth.\nGender Bias in Prevalence\nA data set with no gender bias in participation was required\nto study a possible gender bias. The data set selected included\nonly people born up until 1970 from Final Version 2. It con-\n36% of the males scored as neurodiverse, while 34% of the\nfemales scored as neurodiverse. It therefore seemed like nei-\nther interest rate nor neurodiversity rate was related to\ngender for people born up until 1970. Additional evidence\nfor the absence of a gender bias comes from the fact that\nmale:female gender ratio for all participants correlated .84\nwith female:male gender ratio of participants that scored as\nneurodiverse, indicating that a bias in male participation\nresulted in a similar bias in fewer males scoring as neurodi-\nverse. It seems likely that the lower scores and higher partici-\npation rate of young males is a cultural issue that is related to\npopular beliefs about ASD.\nRacial Bias in Prevalence\nThe U.S. sample was used to study the racial prevalence\nbecause the proportion of different ethnic groups is well\nknown from U.S. census information. Table 2 presents ances-\ntry information for the U.S. sample for Final Phases 1 and 2.\nNative American Indians had higher than expected participa-\ntion rates and higher neurodiversity rate in all three data sets.\nAsians had the expected participation rate, but lower neuro-\ndiversity rates in all three data sets. People ofAfrican descent\nhad only about 1/5th of the expected participation rate, but a\nsimilar neurodiversity rate in all three data sets. These differ-\nences were significant at p < .05 in each of the data sets.\nRacial Differences in Factors\nTable 3 presents factor analysis results for various popula-\ntions. Native American Indians, in the United States, and as\na total group, had higher than expected explained variance\nfor the neurodiversity factor in both data sets. Asians had\nlower than expected explained variance for the neurodiver-\nsity factor. Africans and Europeans were intermediate.\nNeurodiversity Contribution to DSM Diagnoses\nand Personality\nIt was found that many professional tests correlated to Aspie\nscore difference. These were initially run during the valida-\ntion phase, and then rerun in the final phase. Results for the\nvalidation phase are listed in Table 4 and results for the final\nphase are listed in Table 5. The AQ test had the highest\ncorrelation.\nAnother way to analyze neurodiversity contribution to\nDSM diagnoses was to check neurodiversity rate for people\nwho had indicated they had been diagnosed with various\nDSM diagnoses. In Final Version 2 (H3), 63% of diagnosed\nASD, 62% of diagnosed Social Phobia, 56% of diagnosed\nOCD, and 44% of diagnosed ADD/ADHD scored as neuro-\ndiverse. In all, 28% of the participants scored as neurodi-\nverse in this data set, which indicates that all of these\ndiagnoses had considerably higher neurodiversity rates than\nthe average rate.\nA traditional personality test correlated well with Aspie\nQuiz scores. The IPIP NEO Big Five personality question-\nnaire had two factors that were highly correlated to Aspie\nFigure 6. Demographics of participants in Final Versions 1 and 2.\nFigure 7. Rate of very likely Aspie per gender and birth year in\n5-year intervals from Final Version 2.\nscore, the extraversion factor and the neuroticism factor. The\nconscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness factors had\nsmall (but significant; Table 5) negative correlations to Aspie\nscore. It was also found that the factor structure of Aspie\nQuiz was more stable than the factor structure of IPIP NEO.\nThere was a .9 factor congruence coefficient between the\nfactor analysis of only the Aspie Quiz part compared with\nanalyzing the Aspie Quiz part and the IPIP NEO part. This\nTable 2. Ancestry Information.\nAncestral group Participants U.S. census rate 2010 (%) Participation rate (%) Very likely Aspie rate (%)\nNote. Demographic data from the U.S. sample.

To compare the AQ test with Aspie Quiz it\nwas necessary to administer both tests to the same popula-\ntion. This was first done in the consolidation phase (n = 684).\nAnalysis gave a correlation between AQ score and Aspie\nscore of .81, a correlation between AQ score and neurotypi-\ncal score of -.84, and a correlation between AQ score and\nscore difference of .83. In all, 81% of diagnosed AS/HFA\nscored above the cutoff in the AQ test compared with 75% in\nAspie Quiz (6% difference). A total of 66% of all males\nscored above the cutoff in the AQ test compared with 58% in\nAspie Quiz (8% difference). A total of 50% of all females\nscored above the cutoff in the AQ test compared with 43% in\nAspie Quiz (7% difference).\nThe AQ test consistently gave higher scores in all groups\n(but primarily in the whole group and the male group).\nA second attempt to compare the AQ test with Aspie Quiz\nthe Aspie Quiz and the AQ test. This resulted in the same\ncorrelations between scores as in the consolidation phase.\nUsing DataFit's linear regression analysis between AQ\ntest score and various Aspie Quiz scores from the Final\nVersion 1 gave the following equations for converting the\nAQ test score to Aspie Quiz scores:\nIn an evaluation of theAQ test (Woodbury-Smith, Robinson,\n& Baron-Cohen, 2005), control group 2 scored on average\n16.4. Recalculating this score to Aspie Quiz scores using\nthe above formulas gave Aspie score 70 and neurotypical\nscore 138. In Aspie Quiz' neurotypical control group, 95%\nmeans that Group 2 in the AQ test evaluation is slightly\nmore neurotypical than Aspie Quiz' neurotypical control\ngroup.\nBaron-Cohen suggested an AQ score of 32 or above\nshould be considered an indication of autism (Baron-Cohen\net al., 2001). A recalculation of this AQ score to Aspie Quiz\nscore difference give 35, which is the current cutoff for being\nneurodiverse in Aspie Quiz.\nIn a later paper (Woodbury-Smith et al., 2005), it was sug-\ngested that a cutoff at 26 was optimal. This corresponds to an\nAspie Quiz score difference of -4. The cutoff to neurotypical\nTable 5.

Correlations between various instruments and Aspie Quiz score difference run the Final Phase 1. Results are sorted in correlation order. All\nconditions/factors have significant correlations (p < .0001).\nin Aspie Quiz was set to -35 for symmetry reasons. The\nrange between -34 and 34 was judged as mixed in Aspie\nQuiz.\nUsing the above cutoffs, it was possible to calculate mis-\nmatches between professional AS/HFA/PDD diagnosis and\nAspie Quiz results. In Final Version 1, 13% of diagnosed AS/\nHFA/PDD tested as neurotypical, 21% as mixed, and 66% as\nnosed AS/HFA/PDD tested as neurotypical, 24% as mixed,\nWhen comparing results between the AQ test and Aspie\nQuiz, the following was observed:\n59% of diagnosed AS/HFA/PDD scored above the cutoff\nin the AQ test compared with 70% in Aspie Quiz (11%\ndifference)\n42% of all males scored above the cutoff in the AQ test\ncompared with 46% in Aspie Quiz (4% difference)\n45% of all females scored above the cutoff in the AQ test\ncompared with 50% in Aspie Quiz (5% difference)\n16% in the neurotypical control group scored above the\ncutoff in theAQ test compared with 19% inAspie Quiz\n(3% difference)\nAspie Quiz consistently gave higher scores in all groups\n(but primarily in the diagnosed and female group and to a\nlesser extent in the whole group and the control group).\nThese findings seem to show that Aspie Quiz has different\nproperties than the AQ test, which is expected when they\nwere constructed with different goals in mind. Some of the\nproperties of professional diagnosis, like more males receiv-\ning ASD diagnoses, seem to be reflected in the AQ test, but\nnot in Aspie Quiz.\nProblems With Online Questionnaires\nThere are potential problems with data quality when using\nonline questionnaires. As Aspie Quiz has become a popular\nself-test in the autistic community, many people there today\nknow how to get low or high scores on Aspie Quiz. This\ncould cause biased results, but fortunately, only a minority of\nthe answers seem to come from the autistic community In\npopular wrongplanet.net site, which was the major contribu-\ntor from the autistic community. In Final Version 2, 4,146\nparticipants were from wrongplanet.net (2.4%). It therefore\nseems likely that only a minority of the participants in the\nFinal Version 1 came from the autistic community, and that\neven fewer did in the Final Version 2.AsAspie Quiz contains\nmany novel questions with unknown linkage to Autism\nSpectrum Conditions (ASC) outside of the autistic commu-\nnity, this increases chances of truthful answers. Other prob-\nlems include participants not being honest, leaving items\nunchecked, or tending to answer positively (or negatively)\non everything to get the scores they want. These problems\nwere addressed with control items and requiring certain\nnumber of items to be answered. Results indicated that these\nmethods worked.\nFurther Details and Data\nDetailed results from the software-generated evaluation used\nto construct Aspie Quiz can be found at http://www.rdos.net/\neng/aspeval. The source code can be found in a SVN reposi-\ntory at http://rdos.net/vc/viewvc.cgi/trunk/aspie-quiz/\nDiscussion\nThe aim of Aspie Quiz was to find a way to score neurodiver-\nsity traits in a novel way, independent of diagnostic catego-\nries. The actual diversity of the items used was not planned in\nadvance, rather was discovered in the construction process.\nThe main idea was to find traits. To exclude environmental\nproblems, a group of common environmental problems were\nused to spot issues closely related to environment.\nAspie Quiz defines the terms Aspie (neurodiverse) and\nneurotypical itself, based on factor analysis. This is not cir-\ncular as traits were not selected based on diagnostic criteria,\nor based on prevalent stereotypes, but in an automatic item\nselection process. The result that the Aspie Quiz neurodiver-\nsity definition maps well to ASD diagnosis and the AQ test is\nbecause ASDs are based on the same traits as those that got\nselected in Aspie Quiz, and not because of how Aspie Quiz\nwas constructed.\nAspie Quiz' neurodiversity definition might differ from\nthe traditional definition, which is not based on scientific\nresearch, but on people's opinions. In addition to defining\nneurodiversity, Aspie Quiz also defines neurotypical func-\ntion. About half of the traits define neurodiversity, while the\nother half defines neurotypical function. Often, neurotypical\ntraits are described in terms of problems or absence of func-\ntion. The intention is that the traits in Aspie Quiz should rep-\nresent evolved traits, and problems can never evolve. Instead,\nsome traits could have evolved in the neurotypical population\nand then be absent in the neurodiverse population, causing\nproblems in a culture based on neurotypical preferences. For\nexample, having problems with verbal instructions is placed\nin the neurotypical talent group, implying that being good (or\naverage) with verbal instructions is an evolved neurotypical\ntrait, and having problems with verbal instructions is the\nabsence of this trait. For social and communication traits, the\npicture is slightly different. Here there really is no absence of\ntraits, but rather the social and communication issues related\nto neurodiversity are pure differences. The absence of typical\nsocial and communication traits are the central issues in ASD\ndiagnosis, but the presence of other social and communica-\ntion traits is not considered, which means that many of these\ntraits are virtually unknown of. It took a lot of effort to pro-\nduce the symmetric neurodiverse and neurotypical social and\ncommunication groups because these traits are differences\nrather than presence/absence of function.\nAspie Quiz does not support the idea that neurodiversity is\nsimilar to Asperger's syndrome or the entire autism spectrum.\nTo begin with, it was the intention to produce a test that could\npredict an Asperger's syndrome diagnosis, but when the dual-\nfactor nature of the material was discovered, this aim was\ndropped. The term Aspie was retained as that term was thought\nto represent the positive aspects ofAsperger's syndrome rather\nthan the negative aspects described in DSM. In the final form,\nAspie Quiz'Aspie category maps pretty well with the ordinary\nneurodiversity definition that includes ASD, ADD/ADHD,\nDyslexia, Dyscalculia, Dyspraxia, and Tourette syndrome, as\nis evidenced by the correlations scores on professional tests\nfor these conditions have with Aspie Quiz scores.\nThe idea that neurodiversity/autistic traits lie on the\nextreme end of a normal distribution is not supported by\nAspie Quiz, rather the neurodiversity traits seem to have its\nown normal distribution overlapping the normal distribution\nof typical traits. This property was also reflected in the fact\nthat factor analysis produced two factors rather than a single\nfactor. The scores based on these two factors were almost\ninverse, implying that the traits involved in typical function\nand neurodiverse function are mutually exclusive. The two\nfactors combined explained 70% of the variance, and thus of\nhuman diversity, leaving only 30% for other types of varia-\ntion in the traits used in Aspie Quiz.\nConclusion\nThe study found support for the usefulness of Aspie Quiz as\na tool to assess neurodiversity in an unbiased manner. Aspie\nQuiz neither has a gender bias nor an age bias in key psycho-\nmetric properties, like traditional ASD-related test and\nscreening procedures have, which makes it suitable to assess\nneurodiversity.\nThe data from Aspie Quiz contradict the view that neuro-\ndiversity is a cultural or social construct, as all the traits are\ncorrelated to each other, pointing to an inherited rather than\nsocial component. The absence of other major factors of\nhuman variation in the factor analysis of Aspie Quiz speaks\nagainst the idea that neurodiversity is one of the many pos-\nsible dimensions of human diversity, rather pointing to neu-\nrodiversity being the major component of human diversity.\nThe connection to traditional personality traits agrees with\nthis interpretation.\n"
