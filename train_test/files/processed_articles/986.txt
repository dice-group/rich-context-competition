The Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study used three cognitive\ninterventions (memory, reasoning, or speed of processing) in order to improve cognitive abilities. In this article, we\nevaluate ACTIVE's ability to avoid extensive decline in health-related quality of life (HRQoL).\nMethods. ACTIVE enrolled 2,802 adults aged 65 or older and randomized them into one of three cognitive inter-\nventions or a no-contact control group. Researchers obtained data on 2,147 participants at the 24-month follow-up. We\nmeasured HRQoL by using the eight Short Form-36 scales, and we defined clinically relevant decline on each as a drop of\n0.5 standard deviations from baseline. We defined extensive HRQoL decline as clinically relevant drops on four or more\nShort Form-36 scales, and we assessed this by using multiple logistic regression methods that adjusted for\nsociodemographic, cognitive, and health status covariates, and incorporated propensity score derived weights in order\nto adjust for potential attrition bias.\nResults. We found that 25.0% of ACTIVE participants had extensive HRQoL decline. Participants in the speed-of-\nprocessing intervention arm were less likely to have extensive HRQoL decline (adjusted odds ratio \u00bc 0.643; p \u00bc .004)\ncompared with controls, and participants in the memory and reasoning arms were equivalent to controls (adjusted odds\nDiscussion. Although all three intervention arms improved cognitive ability, only the speed-of-processing arm\nprotected against extensive clinically relevant decline in HRQoL.\nONE of the common issues facing older adults today is the\nfear of declining cognitive ability and the onset of dif-\nficulties with activities of daily living (ADLs) that is associated\nwith this decline (Pathy, Morley, & Sinclair, 2006). Difficulties\nwith basic, instrumental ADLs (IADLs), and cognitive ADLs are\nthe primary risk factors for nursing home placement, which is\nperhaps the greatest concern facing older adults (Kane, Kane, &\nLadd, 1998). These concerns are well founded. Research has\nshown that declines in cognitive abilities lead to increased risk of\ndeveloping difficulties with IADLs, that the accumulation of\nIADL limitations leads to increased risk of developing difficulties\nwith basic ADLs, and that, taken together, these functional\ndeclines are associated with increased likelihood of nursing home\nplacement (Wolinsky, Callahan, Fitzgerald, & Johnson, 1992,\n1993). Research has also shown that once older adults are placed\nin nursing homes, their risk of mortality is heightened, even after\nadjusting for a variety of functional status and comorbidity\nmeasures (Aneshensel, Pearlin, & Schuler, 1993; Wolinsky et al.,\n1992). Failure to thrive is thought to play an important role in this\nprocess (Braun, Wykle, & Cowling, 1988; Wolinsky, Stump, &\nCallahan, 1997). There is also evidence suggesting that after\ncognitive decline in elders has been documented, a triage process\nis often initiated, resulting in decreased proclivity for appropriate\nhealth services use, including both inpatient and outpatient\nservices (Wolinsky, Culler, Callahan, & Johnson, 1994;\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that there exists a multitude of\ninterventions for older persons with cognitive impairment\n(Rowe & Kahn, 1998). Few interventions, however, have been\ntargeted at delaying or preventing the onset of cognitive\ndisabilities in cognitively intact older adults (Ball et al., 2002).\nThis is unfortunate, given that many basic cognitive abilities\nand processes are related to measures of functional status, the\nneed for care, and quality of life. Therefore, improving cog-\nnitive function might have short- and/or long-term effects on\ndaily activities related to independent living and might also\ndelay (or prevent the need for) nursing home placement, while\nensuring the independence and dignity of the aging population.\nIn their recent, thorough, and compelling review of the accu-\nmulated longitudinal evidence supporting the cognitive reserve\nhypothesis, Fratiglioni, Paillard-Borg, and Winblad (2004,\np. 343) concluded that there could be little doubt that ``an active\nand socially integrated lifestyle in late life protects against\ndementia and [Alzheimer's disease].'' However, investigators\nhave not adequately studied the subsequent effects of main-\ntained cognitive ability on the daily functioning of older adults\nand their quality of life (Ball et al., 2002). It was for that purpose\nthat the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute of\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2006 by The Gerontological Society of America\nNursing Research sponsored the Advanced Cognitive Training\nfor Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study (Jobe et al.,\n2001). The primary objective of ACTIVE was to test the\neffectiveness and durability of three distinct cognitive inter-\nventions in improving the performance of older adults on basic\nmeasures of cognition and measures of cognitively demanding\ndaily activities (e.g., food preparation, driving, medication use).\nPrevious reports from ACTIVE have strongly supported the\neffectiveness and durability of the three cognitive training\ninterventions in improving the targeted cognitive ability (Ball\net al., 2002). This article takes the next logical step by focusing\non the ability of the three ACTIVE cognitive interventions to\ndelay clinically relevant declines in health-related quality of life\n(HRQoL) during the first 24 months after their delivery.\nConsistent with standard conceptualizations of the disablement\npresumed etiological mechanism is that the decline of cognitive\nabilities increases the likelihood of difficulty in performing\nADLs and IADLs, which in turn leads to a deterioration in\nHRQoL (Ball et al.; Jobe et al., 2001). Evidence of the close\nassociation between cognitive function and HRQoL supports\nthis conceptualization: (a) Higher cognitive function is related\nto higher HRQoL (Lloyd, Boyle, Bell, & Thompson, 2000);\n(b) decline in cognitive function is associated with lower\nHRQoL (Carmelli, Swan, LaRue, & Eslinger, 1997) and higher\nmortality (Wolinsky & Johnson, 1991); and (c) improvements\nin cognitive function are correlated with improvements in\nHRQoL (R. A. Cohen et al., 1999). Thus, preventing the loss of\ncognitive ability would likely also prevent decline in HRQoL.\nMETHODS\nDesign\nACTIVE was a single-blind, randomized controlled trial with\nthree treatment arms and a no-contact control group. Each\ntreatment arm consisted of a 10-session intervention for one of\nthree cognitive abilities (memory, reasoning, or speed of\nprocessing). Researchers provided a four-session booster train-\ning to a random subsample of trained participants approxi-\nmately 11 months after training. Data collection personnel were\nblind to participant treatment assignment. Training exposure\nand social contact were standardized across interventions so\nthat each intervention served as a contact control for the other\ntwo interventions. Therefore, the design allows for testing both\nsocial contact effects (via the contact control group) and retest\neffects (via the no-contact control group) on outcomes. Follow-\nup interviews occurred immediately following training and at\n12 and 24 months after training. For further details, see Jobe\nSample\nStudy organizers recruited from six field sites a large sample\nof adults aged 65 or older (including a substantial proportion\nof African Americans) who were living independent of formal\ncare but at risk for loss of functional independence. From\nipants across these sites by using a variety of sampling frames\nand recruitment strategies described elsewhere (Jobe et al.,\nparticipants. In addition to age, exclusion criteria were (a)\ncognitive impairment (a Mini-Mental State Examination\n[MMSE] score less than 23; Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh,\nhygiene, bathing, or dressing; (d) diagnosed Alzheimer's\ndisease; (e) history of stroke in the previous 12 months; (f)\ncancer with limited life expectancy; (g) current chemotherapy\nor radiation treatment; (h) communication problems; (i)\na planned move from the study site area; (j) scheduling con-\nflicts that would preclude participation in study activities; and\n(k) prior involvement in similar cognitive training studies. In\nrefused to complete screening or enroll in the study. Common\nreasons for ineligibility included MMSE scores less than 23\nparticipants into the trial. At 24 months, researchers obtained\nfor attrition were death (12.2% of 655), refusal to continue\nparticipating in the study at some point after baseline data\ncollection (37.9%), and investigators' inability to locate\nparticipants (33.0%) at the 24-month follow-up. Attrition (and\nthe reasons for it) was not associated with intervention or\ncontrol group status (overall retention rates were 80.1%, 79.4%,\ncontrol groups, respectively).\nInterventions\nEach of three interventions was directed at a specific cognitive\nability: memory, inductive reasoning, or speed of processing.\nFor each intervention, Sessions 1\u00ad5 focused on strategy\ninstruction and exercises to practice the strategy. Sessions 6\u00ad\n10 provided additional practice exercises but introduced no new\nstrategies. A trainer's manual contained scripted content for each\nof the 10 sessions. Reasoning training focused on inductive\nreasoning (the ability to solve problems that follow a serial\npattern and that manifest in executive functioning). Researchers\ntaught participants strategies for identifying the pattern or\nsequence required to solve a problem. Training exercises\ninvolved identifying patterns in both laboratory-type reasoning\ntasks and in everyday activities (e.g., understanding the pattern\nin a bus schedule). Memory training focused on verbal episodic\nmemory, which deals with acquisition and retrieval of in-\nformation acquired in a particular place at a particular time.\nInvestigators taught participants mnemonic strategies for re-\nmembering lists and sequences of items, text material, and main\nideas and details of stories and other text-based information.\nTraining exercises involved recalling laboratory-like episodic\nmemory tasks as well as tasks related to everyday activities\n(such as recalling a shopping list). Speed training focused on\nvisual search and the ability to identify and locate visual\ninformation quickly in a divided attention format, with and\nwithout distraction. Participants practiced speeded tasks on\na computer and were allowed to proceed to more complex tasks\nand faster and faster presentation speeds at their own pace. For\nfurther details, see Jobe and colleagues (2001).\nThe Short Form-36 (SF-36) is the most widely used HRQoL\ninstrument in the world (Brazier, Harper, & Jones, 1992;\nMcHorney, Ware, & Raczek, 1993; Stewart, Hays, & Ware,\n1992). It was developed through iterative data reduction\nexperiences with a variety of precursor measures used in the\nMedical Outcomes Study. A detailed description of the devel-\nopment procedures is available elsewhere (Ware, 1996), as is\nthe exact wording of the items (Ware & Kosinski; Ware et al.).\nOf the 36 items, 35 make up eight scales: physical function-\ning (10 items), role limitations due to physical functioning (4\nitems), bodily pain (2 items), general health perceptions (5\nitems), vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role lim-\nitations due to emotional problems (3 items), and mental health\n(5 items).\nWithin scales, we imputed missing data by using a prorated\nmethod as long as the participant answers at least half of the\nitems within a scale. Simply put, we imputed the average of\nthose items for any unanswered items in that scale. Consistent\nwith national norms, imputation occurred for less than 5% of\nthe cases, and this did not vary by scale. Because of the\ndifferent numbers of items and response options in each scale,\nwe transformed raw scores to range from 0 (worst health) to\n100 (best health). These could also be rescaled (normed) to\nnational data having a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of\n10 by applying the appropriate algorithm (Ware et al., 2000).\nThis study assessed whether the cognitive interventions re-\nsulted in clinically relevant changes in HRQoL. It was, there-\nfore, necessary to establish criteria for such change. It is well\nto 0.50 standard deviations are small, effect sizes of 0.50 to\n0.80 standard deviations are medium, and effect sizes of 0.80\nstandard deviations or greater are large. Although others have\nargued for different categorical cut-offs, the most widely cited\nof these alternative categorical cut-offs for meaningful change\nare very close to Cohen's 0.50 standard deviation (or medium)\nthat the mean estimated meaningfully important difference was\nFurthermore, if there are seven response options for each\nquestion in the scale, an effect size of 0.50 standard deviations\nis remarkably close to estimates of human abilities to\ndiscriminate between two feeling states (Miller, 1956). Thus,\nwe used the 0.50 standard deviation effect size in this study in\norder to define clinically relevant change in a single SF-36\nscale; we defined extensive HRQoL decline as clinically\nrelevant change in four or more of the eight SF-36 scales.\nAttrition Bias\nLoss to follow-up may introduce attrition bias, even in well-\ndesigned trials. One method of adjusting for potential attrition\nbias is to weight the data based on participation rates within\npropensity score quintiles. This method was developed by\nRubin (1979) in order to adjust for the absence of random\nassignment in observational studies, subsequently popularized\nby Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983), and illustrated by D'Agos-\ntino (1998). We obtained the propensity scores from a multiple\nlogistic regression model of attrition at 24 months by using the\nset of cognitive intervention dummy variables and the covar-\niates (see below). Attriters were more likely to be older (ad-\nwere associated with attrition. Overall, the propensity model for\nattrition fit the data reasonably well (Hosmer\u00adLemeshow\nstatistic p value \u00bc .418; C statistic \u00bc .632), and, following\nstandard methods, we weighted the data for the multivariable\nlogistic regression by the inverse of the participation rate within\npropensity score quintiles. For comparative purposes, we also\npresent here equivalent models that we did not weight to adjust\nfor the potential attrition bias.\nCovariates\nIn addition to adjusting for potential attrition bias in the\nmultiple logistic regression analyses, we included 10 covariates\nin order to ensure that the estimated effects of the cognitive\ninterventions on extensive decline in HRQoL were fully inde-\npendent from the effects of other background factors. The\ncovariates included age, gender, race, education, cognitive\nfunction, basic ADLs, IADLs, cognitive ADLs, comorbid med-\nical conditions, and depressive symptoms. We measured age in\nyears. We measured gender as a binary contrast of men (coded\n1) versus women (coded 0). We measured race as a binary\ncontrast of Caucasian (coded 1) versus African American\n(coded 0). We measured education in years. We measured\ncognitive function by using the MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975).\nWe assessed ADLs based on self-reports of difficulty in task\nperformance related to bathing, dressing, and hygiene consis-\ntent with the Minimum Data Set (J. Morris & Morris, 1997;\nJ. N. Morris et al., 1997). Similarly, we measured IADLs\nconsistent with the Minimum Data Set by using self-reports of\ndifficulty in task performance for preparing meals, doing\nhousework, managing finances, managing health care, using the\nphone, shopping, and traveling (J. Morris & Morris; J. N.\nMorris et al.). We measured cognitive ADLs by using the\nnumber of items correct on the Everyday Problems Test, which\nis based on 14 common problem-solving scenarios (e.g.,\nmedication labels, transportation schedules; Willis, 1994), each\nof which has two test items. We measured comorbid medical\nconditions by using the Older American Resources and\nServices protocol (Fillenbaum, 1988), which counts the number\nof self-reported chronic diseases. Finally, we measured de-\npressive symptoms by using the 12-item version of the Center\nfor Epidemiological Studies\u00adDepression scale (Radloff, 1977).\nAnalysis\nWe drew the data used in this analysis from ACTIVE's\nbaseline and 24-month follow-up assessments. The analytic\nsample consisted of the 2,147 participants who completed the\n24-month assessment, and we weighted the data by the inverse\nof the participation rate within propensity score quintiles for\nthe multiple logistic regression models of extensive decline in\nHRQoL at the 24-month follow-up (Hosmer & Lemeshow,\n1989). In these models, we initially regressed extensive decline\nin HRQoL on a set of dummy variables representing the three\ncognitive intervention groups in order to obtain the crude effect\nestimates. We then added the covariates into the model in order to\nobtain the independent effects of the three cognitive interven-\ntions. We evaluated model fit by using the Hosmer-Lemeshow\nstatistic (desired homoscedasticity exists when the p value is\nnot significant; Hosmer & Lemeshow), and the C statistic\n(values greater than 0.50 indicate meaningful improvement over\nchance, and values approaching 0.70 are considered good;\nRESULTS\nDescriptive\nTable 1 contains the means (or percentages) of the covariates\nand SF-36 scale scores at baseline for the participants in each\nof the ACTIVE treatment arms. Overall, the 2,147 ACTIVE\nparticipants who were successfully interviewed 24 months after\nwere Caucasian, and mean educational attainment was 13.6\nyears. The mean MMSE score was 27.5, the average number of\nADLs with difficulty was 0.3, the average number of IADLs\nwith difficulty was 4.3, the mean number of successful answers\non the Everyday Problems Test was 19.2, the average number\nof depressive symptoms was 5.0, and the mean number of\nchronic conditions was 2.2. We observed no significant dif-\nferences in the distribution of any of these covariates across\nthe four treatment arms. The overall mean scores on the\nlimitations (physical), 66.1 on bodily pain, 87.0 on social func-\ntioning, 80.2 on mental health, 75.5 on role limitations (emo-\ntional), 62.0 on vitality, and 69.6 on general health perceptions.\nThe only significant difference on the distribution of the SF-36\nscale scores across the four treatment arms involved the role\nlimitations (physical) scale, on which participants in the rea-\nsoning intervention averaged 4.3 points fewer than the grand\nmean. The relatively high mean scores on the SF-36 scales,\nespecially in terms of social functioning, mental health, and role\nlimitations (emotional), indicate that these ACTIVE partic-\nipants were well adapted to their life situations, which was\nlikely a function of their high average educational attainment,\nexcellent MMSE scores, and limited levels of difficulty with\nbasic, instrumental, or cognitive ADLs.\nTable 2 shows the mean changes from baseline to the 24-\nmonth follow-up interview for each of the SF-36 scale scores\nfor the participants in each of the ACTIVE treatment arms.\nThese are crude (unadjusted) differences. In terms of the simple\nchange (i.e., gain/loss) scores, there were no significant dif-\nferences for any of the eight SF-36 scales across the treatment\narms. This reflects on the insensitivity of any of the individual\nSF-36 scale scores in detecting changes over time (Wyrwich,\nTierney, Babu, Kroenke, & Wolinsky, 2005). Table 3 shows\nthe percentage of participants by treatment arm with clinically\nimportant declines (i.e., 0.50 standard deviations) on each of\nthe SF-36 scales. Although the participants in the speed\ntreatment arm always had the lowest percentages, only the\ndifferences for bodily pain were statistically significant.\nTable 1.

Here we observed a statistically\nsignificant difference in the total number of clinically important\ndeclines, with participants in the speed-training treatment group\naveraging about 0.3 fewer declines on the eight SF-36 scale\nscores than their counterparts. More importantly, although\n25.0% of the participants overall had extensive decline in\nHRQoL (i.e., clinically relevant declines on at least four of the\neight SF-36 scales), the distribution of extensive decline was\nsignificantly different across the four treatment arms: 28.0% for\nparticipants in the memory group, 26.7% for participants in the\nreasoning group, 19.5% for participants in the speed group, and\n25.8% for participants in the control group. This differential\ndistribution was highly statistically significant (p \u00bc .006).\nMultiple Logistic Regression\nTable 5 contains the crude odds ratios (Models 1a and 1b)\nand AORs (Models 2a and 2b) obtained from the two multiple\nlogistic regression models of extensive decline in HRQoL. We\nweighted one set of models (Models 1a and 2a) to adjust for\npotential attrition bias using the standard propensity score\nmethod; the other set of models (Models 1b and 2b) was\nunweighted. Models 1a and 1b provide the crude odds ratios for\nthe four treatment arms (the control group is the reference\ncategory). As shown, and consistent with the above cross-\nclassification results, participants in the speed-training group\nhad lower odds of having extensive decline in HRQoL\ncompared with the control group, with 37.6% lower odds in\nthe weighted model (1a) and 31.4% lower odds in the\nunweighted model (1b). The risk of extensive decline in\nHRQoL for participants in the memory and reasoning training\ngroups did not differ from that of participants in the control\ngroup (weighted or unweighted). When we added the 10\ncovariates into Models 2a and 2b, there was no appreciable\nchange in the protective effect of being in the speed-training\ngroup. As is shown in Model 2a, among the covariates, age,\nrace, education, and depressive symptoms had statistically\nsignificant effects, with a 2.9% increase in the odds for\nextensive decline associated with each year of age, 21.1% lower\nodds for Whites (compared with Blacks), a 6.8% decrease in\nthe odds for extensive decline associated with each year of\neducation, and a 2.2% decrease in the odds associated with each\ndepressive symptom. The effects of the covariates shown in\nModel 2b (the unweighted analyses) were equivalent, although\nthe marginally statistically significant effects of race and de-\npressive symptoms shown in Model 2a were no longer statis-\ntically significant. Overall, Model 2a fit the data fairly well\nDISCUSSION\nACTIVE is the largest randomized controlled trial yet\nconducted that focuses on improving cognitive performance\namong older adults (Jobe et al., 2001). Moreover, it is the first\nsuch trial specifically designed to avoid or postpone cognitive\ndecline in normally functioning older adults in order to halt or\nslow the adverse consequences of such cognitive decline\n(including increases in basic, instrumental, and cognitive\nADLs; lower HRQoL; and higher health services use; and\nnursing home placement). Previous research has shown that the\nthree distinct cognitive interventions in ACTIVE were all\nsuccessful in improving their proximal cognitive outcomes\n(Ball et al., 2002). We have shown here that the speed-of-\nprocessing training intervention was also successful in reducing\nextensive decline in HRQoL over the first 24 months of follow-\nup. Indeed, after adjustment for all of the covariates,\nparticipants in the speed-training arm of ACTIVE had 35.7%\n(p \u00bc .006) lower odds of experiencing extensive decline than\nparticipants in the control group.\nTable 4.

As previously reported,\nspeed training had a substantially greater effect on improving\nits proximal cognitive outcomes than did either of its counter-\nthe reasoning-, and 26% of the memory-trained participants\ndemonstrated reliable cognitive improvement (defined as a gain\nin score greater than or equal to at least one standard error of\nmeasurement) at the immediate post-test (Ball et al). Moreover,\nparticipants in the speed-training group who also received\nbooster training had statistically significant improvements\nin ADL and IADL functioning 12 months after baseline,\nwhereas participants in the reasoning- and memory-training\ngroups did not.\nNonetheless, these findings beg an important question. What\nis it about speed-of-processing training that matters, at least in\nterms of HRQoL? Although the answer cannot be definitively\ndetermined from the ACTIVE study, it is likely that neuro-\nbiologic and psychosocial factors play important roles. Of the\nthree cognitive interventions, speed of processing is the most\nclearly procedural. That is, speed of processing operates\nthrough sensory-motor elaboration and repetition, whereas the\nmemory and reasoning interventions emphasize or require the\nexplicit learning of new concepts. Procedural tasks have a\nbroader pattern of regional brain activation (i.e., neostriatum\nand cerebellum in addition to neocortex) than do explicit\nmemory tasks (Cabeza & Nyberg, 2000), and this may\ncontribute to the greater sense of well-being captured by the\nHRQoL ratings. The psychosocial part of the explanation is that\nsuch improved brain activation or structure may delay the onset\nof (if not reduce the risk for) ``slowing down,'' which is the\nsingle most dreaded fear of older adults, even though the\nmajority of them clearly recognize that they will ultimately face\n``a slower pace of life'' (Cape, 1983, p.18). Therefore, to the\nextent that participants in the speed-of-processing intervention\ndelayed or avoided tempo reductions, these older adults were\nable to retain higher (i.e., baseline) perceptions of their HRQoL\ncompared with their counterparts.\nThe failure of the memory and reasoning interventions to\nsignificantly reduce the risk of extensive decline in HRQoL\nwarrants further comment. It is possible that these null findings\nmay be somewhat artificial. First, although all three cognitive\ninterventions were designed to have substantial comparability\nin terms of the number and length of sessions, there were\ndifferences in delivery structure. The speed-of-processing inter-\nvention involved more performance feedback from the trainer\nto the participant throughout the training process than did either\nthe memory or reasoning interventions. Moreover, the feedback\ndelivered in the speed-of-processing intervention was more\nconcrete than that delivered in either the memory or reasoning\ninterventions. Because the HRQoL measures were subjective\nself-evaluations, they may have been more sensitive to the\nincreased and more concrete performance feedback associated\nwith the speed-of-processing intervention. Second, although\nthe 10-session standard delivery package was adequate for the\nspeed-of-processing intervention, it may not have been suf-\nficient to reach the necessary thresholds for either the memory\nor reasoning intervention. That is, the exposure (or training)\nthreshold for producing the desired effect for the memory and\nreasoning interventions may require going well beyond 10\nsessions. Although both of these possible explanations (i.e.,\ndifferential performance feedback and differential training\nthresholds) for the null findings for the memory and reasoning\ninterventions are plausible, they must be considered rather\nspeculative, inasmuch as they cannot be addressed in these\ndata.\nWe must recognize an important limitation in the design of\nthe ACTIVE study. Although ACTIVE was a randomized\ncontrolled trial, which maximizes internal validity, its partic-\nipants were not recruited to be representative of the population\nat large, which limits external validity (Shadish, Cook, &\nCampbell, 2002). Indeed, the exclusion criteria for ACTIVE\nintentionally screened out individuals with extant functional or\ncognitive decline. Because of this, ACTIVE participants were\nlikely more resilient at baseline and less likely to decline by the\ntime of the 24-month follow-up than the average older adult.\nOne can observe this in the lack of functional decline in the\ncontrol group. This possibility notwithstanding, 1 in 4 ACTIVE\nparticipants did experience extensive decline in HRQoL during\nthe observation period. Thus, although it is clear that the\nACTIVE interventions improved cognitive abilities and that\nthese improvements continued through 24 months (Ball et al.,\n2002), most of the participants did not experience functional\ndecline during this time. Therefore, it is possible that expected\ndifferential functional decline across treatment groups in the\nfuture, as this select cohort enters more fully into an age of\nfunctional loss, will contribute to additional and/or stronger\nobserved protective effects against extensive decline in\nWhat remains to be seen is whether the indisputable and\nprotective effect of the speed-of-processing intervention on\nextensive decline in HRQoL reported here will be replicated\nwhen other, more objective outcomes are considered. After all,\nthe SF-36 is a subjective and self-reported measure. This is not\na criticism of the SF-36. Indeed, due to its very nature, re-\nsearchers must assess HRQoL by using subjective self-reports,\nand postponing or eliminating declines in HRQoL among\nolder adults is critically important. Nonetheless, one wonders\nwhether the protective effect of the speed-of-processing\nintervention will translate into more appropriate and reduced\nlevels of health services utilization and resource consumption\nand, ultimately, into greater longevity. Examining these more\nobjective outcomes is the next step in the ACTIVE study.\n"
