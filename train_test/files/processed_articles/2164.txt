Similarly, studies increasingly show a link\nbetween neighborhood residential environment and positive parenting behavior. However, less is known about how the\nresidential environment influences parental social support. To address this gap, we examine the relationship between\nneighborhood concentrated disadvantage and collective efficacy and the level and change in parental caregiver perceptions\nof non-familial social support.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: The data for this study came from three data sources, the Project on Human\nDevelopment in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) Study's Longitudinal Cohort Survey of caregivers and their offspring, a\nCommunity Survey of adult residents in these same neighborhoods and the 1990 Census. Social support is measured at\nWave 1 and Wave 3 and neighborhood characteristics are measured at Wave 1. Multilevel linear regression models are fit.\nThe results show that neighborhood collective efficacy is a significant (\u00df = .04; SE = .02; p = .03), predictor of the positive\nchange in perceived social support over a 7 year period, however, not of the level of social support, adjusting for key\ncompositional variables and neighborhood concentrated disadvantage. In contrast concentrated neighborhood\ndisadvantage is not a significant predictor of either the level or change in social support.\nConclusion: Our finding suggests that neighborhood collective efficacy may be important for inducing the perception of\nsupport from friends in parental caregivers over time.\nCitation: Tendulkar SA, Koenen KC, Dunn EC, Buka S, Subramanian SV (2012) Neighborhood Influences on Perceived Social Support Among Parents: Findings\nEditor: Attila Szolnoki, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Hungary\nCopyright: \u00df 2012 Tendulkar et al.

In\ncontrast, inadequate parental support or social isolation has been\nlinked to diminished parental well-being, mental health problems,\nand damaging parenting practices [7\u00ad11]. The residential context,\nor neighborhood environment, has been identified as an important\ndeterminant of both positive and negative parenting [12\u00ad15]. For\nexample, in a study of mothers and their 3-year old children,\nKlebanov et al. (1994) found that neighborhood poverty was\nnegatively and associated with maternal warmth, even after\nadjusting for salient family variables such as family poverty.\nDespite the accumulation of evidence on the importance of\nparental perceived social support and the residential environment\nfor parenting, only a few studies have examined the effect of the\nresidential environment itself on parental perceived social support.\nAlthough small in number, these studies suggest that the\nresidential or neighborhood environment shapes parent's per-\nceived social support. For example, in a study of single African-\nAmerican mothers, Ceballo and McLoyd (2002) found that for\nmothers, living in a disordered community environment charac-\nterized by low maternal neighborhood ratings, high violent crime\nrates and a high percentage of families living in poverty, the\npotential positive effect of parental social support, on nurturing\nparenting behaviors was significantly attenuated [16]. In another\necological study of neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and\nchild maltreatment rates, Garbarino and Sherman (1980) found\nhigher child maltreatment rates in neighborhoods with fewer\neconomic resources [9]. They concluded this finding was\nexplained by diminished access to social resources in the\nneighborhood.\nWhile these studies suggest that parental perceived social\nsupport may be contextually patterned, or influenced by\nfeatures of the neighborhood environment, there is insufficient\nempirical evidence to demonstrate a conclusive relationship. In\nparticular, it is unclear whether social ties (i.e. social\nrelationships) are more salient than the ``activation'' of these\nsocial ties to engage in collective action, a concept termed\nneighborhood collective efficacy. Collective efficacy is com-\nprised of two related constructs: mutual trust (referred to as\nsocial cohesion) and the willingness of neighborhoods to\nintervene for the public good (referred to as informal social\ncontrol) [17]. Collective efficacy has been examined in relation\nto outcomes such as partner violence [18], self-rated health [19]\nand adolescent suicide [20].\nStudies have examined the two sub-components of collective\nefficacy \u00ad neighborhood level informal social control and social\ncohesion \u00ad independently in relation to family functioning. For\nexample, Kohen et al (2008) found associations between residing\nin neighborhoods with low social cohesion and maternal\ndepression and family dysfunction. Similarly, in another study,\nresearchers reported that an increase in neighborhood informal\nsocial control was associated with a decrease in neglectful and\npsychologically harsh parenting [15] However, we found only one\nstudy that examined neighborhood collective efficacy in relation to\nauthoritative parenting of African American caregivers, in\nneighborhoods with increasing collective efficacy. However we\nfound no studies which examine collective efficacy in relation to\nparental perceived social support though we hypothesize that these\nphenomena are related.\nWhile few studies examine neighborhood characteristics in the\ncontext of parental perceived social support, numerous studies\nlink neighborhood economic deprivation to a wide range of\nnegative health and mental health related outcomes [22\u00ad26]. It is\nbelieved that neighborhood social ties and interactions as well as\nnorms and collective efficacy represent two important pathways\nthrough which economic deprivation impact individual out-\ncomes. For example, parents who reside in economically deprived\nneighborhoods may have limited access to social resources and\nfeel more socially isolated, making them less likely to engage in\ncollective social action [27,28]. In contrast, parents living in\nresource rich environments characterized by mutual trust and the\npotential for collective action, may be more likely to share\nparenting strategies, resources and feedback and ultimately feel\nmore supported.\nGiven the current gaps in the literature and the theoretical\nrelationships described above, we use data from a longitudinal\nstudy of parents to explore three research questions: First, to\nexamine whether there is an association between neighborhood\nconcentrated disadvantage and collective efficacy and the level\nof perceived social support parents report from friends at one\npoint in time (cross-sectional analysis), second to examine\nwhether neighborhood concentrated disadvantage and collec-\ntive efficacy induce changes in perceived social support over time\n(longitudinal analysis) and third to examine whether there is an\ninteraction between neighborhood concentrated disadvantage\nand collective efficacy in both the cross-sectional and longitu-\ndinal analysis. We focus on both cross-sectional and longitu-\ndinal analyses, given that social support can fluctuate over the\nMethods\nEthics Statement\nThe Harvard School of Public Health Human Subjects\nCommittee determined that this research was exempt (Protocol\nStudy Design\nData for these analyses came from the Project on Human\nDevelopment in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN), a landmark\nfamily, and neighborhood-level causes and consequences of youth\nexposure to urban violence [31]. The PHDCN consisted of two\nmain components: (1) a community survey (CS), collected from 1994\u00ad\n1995 of residents living in urban neighborhoods which was aimed\nat understanding the social, economic, organizational, political,\nand cultural structures and processes of those neighborhoods [32]\nand (2) a longitudinal cohort survey (LCS) of children, adolescents, and\nabout the structural (i.e. socio-demographic) characteristics of each\nneighborhood, PHDCN investigators also linked these two data\nsources to the 1990 US Census [33]. For this study, we utilized the\n1990 Census measure given its proximity to the Wave 1 data\ncollection, started in 1994. In order to be consistent, we also\nutilized the 1990 census data in the longitudinal analysis.As\ndescribed below, we used data from the LCS to construct the\nparent-level variables; data from the CS and Census were used to\nderive the neighborhood-level variables.\nCommunity Survey (CS). To obtain a sample of participants\nfor both the CS and LCS, PHDCN investigators began by\ndividing the city of Chicago into 847 populated census tracts,\nwhich were then collapsed to form 343 ecologically meaningful,\ngeographically compact, homogenous neighborhood clusters\n(NCs). The neighborhood clusters were approximately 8000\npeople large and were homogenous on key census indicators.\nThis was in contrast to the 77 communities in Chicago, which\nconsisted of approximately 40,000 people each and were less likely\nto represent ``true'' neighborhoods. For the CS, investigators used\na three-stage cluster sampling design. At the first stage, city blocks\nwere randomly sampled within each of the 343 NCs. At the second\nstage, dwelling units were randomly sampled within each city\nblock. In most cases, all dwelling units in a NC were selected,\nthough in large NCs, census blocks were sampled using probability\nproportional to size sampling methods. At the third stage, one\nadult resident (aged 18 and over) within each dwelling unit was\nrandomly selected and interviewed for the CS. CS respondents\nranged in age from 18 to 83, were predominately female (65%),\nand representative of the neighborhoods from which the LCS\nsample was drawn. While residents were interviewed from all areas\nof Chicago, a greater percentage of respondents were included in\nthe CS that represented the NCs of the LCS.\nLongitudinal Cohort Survey (LCS). To obtain a sample of\nparticipants for the LCS, investigators stratified the 343 NCs into 7\nlevels of race/ethnicity and 3 levels of socioeconomic status (SES),\nresulting in 21 strata and 80 NCs (note: three strata did not\ncontain any NCs). A list of all dwelling units in the 80 NCs was\nenumerated, and probability proportional to size sampling\nmethods were used to select blocks, dwelling units, and persons\nwithin dwelling units. Households with children (and pregnancies)\nwere selected to participate in the LCS. All household members\nwere invited to participate in the study, which followed parents (i.e.\nNeighborhood Influences on Parental Social Support\nindividuals who spent the most time caring for the child and\nresided with the child at least 5 nights per week) and children ages\n2001) across three waves of data collection.\nFor all LCS cohorts except 0 and 18, both parents and children\nwere interviewed. Separate research assistants administered the\nparent and child interviews. Interviews took place primarily in-\nperson, though participants who declined to complete in-person\ninterviews were interviewed via phone. Interviews were conducted\nin Spanish, English, and Polish and interpreters were provided for\nparticipants who spoke other languages. Participants were\ncompensated between $5\u00ad$20 per interview depending on their\nage and the wave of data collection. Child participants were\ninterviewed on a range of topics including language development,\nsubstance use, values, and sensation-seeking traits, while parents\nwere interviewed on topics including family structure, parent-child\nrelationships, and family mental health.\n(75% completion) [34]. Wave 1 data collection occurred between\n(85.9% completion) and Wave 3 data collection occurred from\nWave 3 LCS were used in this study. The PHDCN data presents a\nunique opportunity to examine a longitudinal cohort of children\nand families and assess neighborhoods from an independent\nsample of neighborhood residents from urban Chicago.\nFull and Analytic Samples\nand 18 completed an interview for the LCS. Therefore the original\n12, 15 and 18 years old (i.e. 1 child per row). Parental caregivers of\n18 year olds were not eligible for inclusion in this study mainly\nbecause they were not asked the outcome of interest. Multiple\nchildren could be nested within a caregiver but since the dataset\nwas at the child level and we were interested in caregiver level\ndata, we selected one row per parental caregiver (i.e. one child\nrow) to use in our analysis. All the variables used in the analysis\nwere caregiver level variables, which were identical across all\nchildren in the same family (e.g. all children with the same\nparental caregiver, had the same educational level recorded for\nthat caregiver). We also noted that some caregivers changed from\nWave 1 to Wave 3 and therefore we excluded them from our\nanalysis. Technically nobody was excluded from the analytic\nsample size through these steps therefore we did not implement a\nsensitivity analysis. At this stage our analytic sample size was 2782.\nWe did exclude approximately 3% of parents from the model\nanalysis as these parents did not have complete data on the\noutcome of interest at Wave 1 and Wave 3. As this number was\nless than 5% of the overall sample we did not implement a\nsensitivity analysis.\nFinally, we only included parents with complete parental\nperceived social support data (i.e. parents with no missing\nresponses on the 7 items). We choose to include participants with\ncomplete data, rather than impute in order to be conservative in\nour estimates.\nMeasures\nThe variables in this study came from measures included in the\nCS, LCS, or Census and tapped information about parents and\nthe neighborhood environment. These measures are described\nbelow.\nPerceived Social Support. Perceived social support from\nfriends and family members was assessed among parents using a\n20 item Provision of Social Relations (PSRP) instrument (Table 1),\nwhich queries parents about the social support they receive from\nfamily members and friends [35]. For this study, we examined\nperceived support from friends only, given our hypothesis that this\ntype of social support would be strongly related to the\nneighborhood environment. Support from friends was measured\non a Likert-type scale (response options were 1 = very true;\n2 = somewhat true; 3 = not true) with eight items measured at both\nWave 1 and Wave 3. The PSRP was not implemented at Wave 2,\ntherefore we were restricted to analyzing this measure at two\nwaves. The items comprising this scale demonstrate good internal\nconsistency reliability in this sample (a = 0.75).\nWe used these data to create several different representations of\nperceived social support among parents. First, we derived a mean\nsocial support score for each parental caregiver, based on the\naverage response to the eight social support items at each wave.\nSecond, we constructed two representations of this mean score for\neach set of analyses. For the cross-sectional analysis, we utilized the\nmean score for each caregiver at Wave 1. For the longitudinal\nanalysis, we calculated a difference score (Wave 3 mean minus\nWave 1 mean) for each parent caregiver. We constructed a\ndifference score rather than controlling for baseline social support,\nbased on evidence that controlling for the baseline score of a\npredictor in a longitudinal model can result in spuriously inflated\nNeighborhood Features. Measures of the neighborhood\nenvironment tapped both structural or socio-demographic\nmeasures of communities and social characteristics or attributes\nof social relationships of each neighborhood and came from either\nconstruct two measures of neighborhood environment. The first\nwas neighborhood concentrated disadvantage, which was derived\nby PHDCN investigators using a factor analysis from variables\ncollected in the 1990 Census [27]. This factor included items that\ncorresponded to percent below the poverty line, percent on public\nassistance, percent unemployed, percent female-headed\nhouseholds, percent under age 18, and percent African American.\nThe second measure, neighborhood collective efficacy, was\nconstructed from LCS caregiver reports. In the LCS, respondents\nwere asked to indicate their level of agreement with twelve\nstatements; six items measured neighborhood informal social control\nor willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good or (i.e. if\nchildren were spray-painting graffiti on a local building) and six\nitems measured social cohesion, or connectedness between neighbors\n(i.e. this is a close knit community). To generate neighborhood-\nlevel values for these variables, we calculated a mean neighbor-\nhood score across the 12 items. We grand-mean centered all\nneighborhood measures to facilitate interpretability. This proce-\ndure allows us to interpret the outcome for a neighborhood with\nthe average level of each neighborhood measure.\nCovariates. Throughout our analyses, we controlled for\ncovariates obtained via parental self-report at Wave 1 of the\nLCS. These included: age (continuous), race/ethnicity\n(0 = White,1 = Black, 2 = Hispanic, 3 = Other), education (0 = less\nthan high school, 1 = high school, 2 = greater than high school),\nsex (0 = female, 1 = male), household salary (0 = more than\nmarital status (0 = married, 1 = single, 2 = partnered). Given that\nwe imputed household salary information for approximately 4% of\ncases, we included an imputation indicator.\nNeighborhood Influences on Parental Social Support\nAnalytic Approach\nWe began by conducting univariate and bivariate analyses to\nexamine sample demographic characteristics, the distribution of\nand interrelationships between the predictors and outcomes, and\nevaluate the extent of missing data present. We then utilized multi-\nlevel linear regression for the cross-sectional analysis (i.e. examine\nthe association between neighborhood concentrated disadvantage\nand collective efficacy on mean levels of social support at Wave 1)\nand longitudinal analysis (i.e. examine the association between\nneighborhood concentrated disadvantage and collective efficacy\non the change in social support from Wave 1 to Wave 3). For both\nthe cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, we constructed all\nregression models in a sequential fashion. Specifically, we began\nby fitting a null or intercept-only model. We then introduced the\ncovariates into the model, individually. First we examined\nneighborhood concentrated disadvantage and collective efficacy,\nindividually in models with the demographic variables. Second, we\nexamined the two neighborhood variables in the model simulta-\nneously. And finally, we introduced an interaction term of the two\nneighborhood variables. We reported parameter estimates and\nstandard errors, and variance estimates for each model. We\nperformed all analyses in SAS 9.1. All models were estimated using\nResults\nSample Demographics\nTable 2 shows the demographic characteristics of this sample at\nWave 1. The sample was predominantly female (95%), Hispanic\n(42%) and included 47% of parents had less than a high school\neducation. Approximately 43% of the sample reported earning less\nthan 20,000 dollars a year. The majority of the sample was\nmarried (56%) and the mean age was 33 years.\nMeans and Correlations\nMean comparison analyses were conducted to determine\nassociations between the demographic variables and both the level\nand change in caregiver perceived social support (See Table 2). No\nsignificant gender differences in the level of social support were\nobserved. However, white caregivers as compared with all caregivers\nin other racial/ethnic groups (p,.0001), caregivers with more than a\nhigh school education as compared with less educated caregivers\n(p,.0001), caregivers with a household salary greater than 50 K\n(p,.0001) and married caregivers, as compared with caregivers with\nall other marital status types (p,.0001) had a significantly higher\nlevel of social support at Wave 1. In contrast, there were no\nsignificant associations between any of the demographic variables\nand change in social support, with the exception of gender (p = .0106).\nCross-Sectional Analyses Focusing on Mean Levels of\nSocial Support\nIn Table 3 we present the results from multi-level linear\nregression models examining the adjusted associations between the\nneighborhood variables and parental caregiver mean levels of\nsocial support. The null model (not shown in table) describes the\nmean level of social support in this sample of parental caregivers\ncovariates, neighborhood concentrated disadvantage and collec-\ntive efficacy were not significantly associated with caregiver level of\nsocial support. As noted in Table 4, while 1.2% of the variation in\nparental caregiver perceived social support at Wave 1 was\nattributable to neighborhood variations in social support, this\neffect was rendered null when compositional (i.e. caregiver)\ncharacteristics were introduced into the model.\nLongitudinal Analyses Focusing on Change in Social\nSupport\nTable 5 presents the results from the multi-level linear\nregression models examining the adjusted associations between\nthe neighborhood variables and change in the caregiver level of\nsocial support. The null model (not shown in table) describes the\nmean change in social support in this sample of parental caregivers\ncovariates neighborhood collective efficacy was positively and\nsignificantly associated with the changes in a caregiver's perceived\nsocial support (\u00df = .04; SE = .02; p = .03), such that each one unit\nchange in neighborhood collective efficacy was associated with .04\nincrease in caregiver perceived social support from Wave 1 to\nWave 3. However, neighborhood concentrated disadvantage was\nnot significantly associated with the change in caregiver perceived\nsocial support. The interaction between neighborhood collective\nefficacy and concentrated disadvantage was also not significant.\nFinally, as noted in Table 6, while .1% of the variation in the\nchange in parental caregiver perceived social support was\nattributable to neighborhood variations in social support, this\neffect was rendered null when compositional (i.e. caregiver)\ncharacteristics were introduced into the model.\nDiscussion\nParental social support has been linked to positive parenting\npractices in the empirical literature [4,6]. Additionally, studies\nTable 1.

However, little is known about whether and how the\nneighborhood environment impinges on or promotes parental\nsocial support. This study was conducted to address this\nknowledge-gap by exploring the influence of neighborhood\nstructural and social processes on the level and change in parental\ncaregiver perceived non-familial social support.\nOur study found support for a relationship between neighbor-\nhood collective efficacy and change in parental perceived social\nsupport however we did not find support for the relationship\nbetween neighborhood collective efficacy and level of perceived\nsocial support. Discrepant findings between longitudinal and cross-\nsectional models are not uncommon in the literature [38]. Our\nfindings seemed to suggest that neighborhood collective efficacy\npresented no immediate effect on a parental caregiver's level of\nperceived social support, but that the effects of collective efficacy\ncould accumulate over time and have a lagged effect on the\nchange in a caregiver's level of perceived social support. In order\nto explore this further, we tested the interaction between length of\nresidence in a neighborhood and collective efficacy. The\ninteraction term was not significant, suggesting that the beneficial\neffect of neighborhood collective efficacy on parental perceived\nsocial support is not stronger for longer term residents.\nThe observed one unit change in individual perceived social\nsupport for a .04 increase in collective efficacy is important when\nwe consider that these effects are applied across the population to\nmany caregivers. While this effect is small, it is ``spread'' across the\npopulation and community-wide interventions to promote neigh-\nborhood collective efficacy (in addition to individual level\ninterventions to promote social support) may be a more efficient\nway to promote parental perceived social support across\ncommunities.\nOther studies have found similar positive effects of living in\nneighborhoods with high collective efficacy for other outcomes\nTable 2.

It is possible that parents living in neighborhoods\ncharacterized by high collective efficacy and collective support\nmay be more likely to feel individually supported. This important\nfinding persisted, even in models adjusting for neighborhood\nconcentrated disadvantage. This suggests that living in a\nneighborhood characterized by collective action can induce the\nfeeling of being supported in parental caregivers, irrespective of\nthe socio-demographic resources available in a neighborhood.\nThis study is innovative from multiple perspectives. First, it fills\nan important gap in the literature by examining how support-\ninducing neighborhood processes, such as collective efficacy, may\ninfluence an important potential determinant of parenting--\nnamely parental perceived social support. Second, this study is\ninnovative in its use of a longitudinal approach to this question,\ngiven evidence that social support can fluctuate over the lifespan\n[29,30]. Finally, unlike other studies of parenting and neighbor-\nhood context [13], our neighborhood variables were not derived\nfrom the participants themselves, but from an independent sample\nof residents from urban Chicago.\nDespite these strengths, we acknowledge several limitations to\nthis research. First, social support was measured via a self-report\ninstrument which may not reflect the actual receipt of social\nsupport [39]. Despite this limitation, there is evidence that unless\nsocial support is perceived, it cannot be used [30]. Second,\nneighborhood characteristics utilized in this study were only\nmeasured at time point. It is possible that neighborhood\ncharacteristics changed over time. Third, it is possible that\nindividual caregivers with high or low social support elected to\nmove into particular neighborhoods. This may have influenced\nour findings away from the null. In order to address this limitation\nwe implemented a rigorous adjustment for key caregiver level\nvariables that could potentially explain selection into a particular\nneighborhood. In future studies, we will explore the use of analytic\nstrategies such as instrumental variable analysis to address the issue\nof selection. Fourth, we recognize that administratively defined\nneighborhoods do not necessarily equate with ``socially meaning-\nful'' neighborhoods. However every effort was made to ensure that\nthe neighborhood clusters selected for this study approximated\nlocal neighborhoods and were internally homogenous on key\ncensus indicators. Fifth, parental perceived social support was only\ncollected at two time points, Wave 1 and Wave 3, therefore we\nwere restricted to a two wave longitudinal analysis. We recognize\nthat this is a limitation of our study. It is possible that social\nsupport is erroneously measured as low at Wave 1 and high at\nWave 2, suggesting there is improvement in parental perceived\nsocial support from Wave 1 to Wave 2. when in fact this is\nattributable to measurement error [40]. Despite this limitation, we\nbelieve the presentation of both cross sectional and longitudinal,\nalbeit a two wave longitudinal model is a strength of this study.\nSixth, while there are methods for constructing ecometric\nneighborhood measures of collective efficacy (e.g. systematic social\nobservation) we utilized a measure constructed from the\naggregated responses of individuals. While an ecometric measure\nwould possibly capture the concept of collective efficacy as a\ncollective characteristic, as suggested by Subramanian et al. (2002),\nthese types of measures may fail to capture the ``perceived social\ndynamism'' that is an important component of a community's\nsocial capital. Furthermore these approaches are not yet well\ntested and are both time and cost intensive. Seventh and final, our\nstudy has limited generalizability to individuals living in neigh-\nborhood such as urban Chicago, and particularly to female\ncaregivers as our sample was predominately female. Despite this\nlimitation, the PHDCN was uniquely set up to allow us to move\nbeyond traditional census and parental reported measures to\ncapture neighborhood characteristics. It is also important to note\nthat Chicago was chosen by PHDCN researchers because of the\nracial/ethnic and socioeconomic diversity seen across each\nneighborhood.\nIn future studies we intend to expand on this research and\nincorporate different measures of social support, by interviewing\nboth the recipients and the providers of social support. We also\nhope to examine other types of social support, beyond emotional\nsocial support. For instance, instrumental social support may be\nparticularly sensitive to neighborhood characteristics. Finally, we\nalso intend to examine fluctuations in neighborhood attributes\nover time and relate these to changes in individual outcomes.\nImplications\nOur finding that neighborhood environment matters for a\nparent's perception of feeling supported can inform the develop-\nment of neighborhood level interventions for bolstering parental\nsocial support. An intervention designed to promote individual\nparental caregiver perceived social support would benefit from the\ninclusion of a community-wide effort to promote neighborhood\ncollective efficacy. Collective efficacy stems from the shared belief\nby neighborhood individuals that they are capable of making a\ndifference in their community and consequently are actively\nengaged in this process. This would not preclude providing\ninterventions to enhance individual social support, however, a\ncommunity-wide intervention would likely be a more efficient way\nto intervene and the potential benefit would be distributed across\nthe population. Ultimately, an intervention that could promote\nparental social support would have great potential to improve\nparenting practices.
