Bennett et al.\nIntroduction\nAround the world, populations are ageing because more\npeople are becoming older, and older people are living longer.\nChina records the largest population of adults aged 60+ years\nin the world [1]. It has an average life expectancy of 73 years\nolder population). In China as elsewhere, although the mor-\ntality risk increases with age, not every one of the same age\nhas the same risk of dying. This variable vulnerability to death\nand other adverse outcomes among people of the same age,\nknown as frailty, can be operationalised in a frailty index (FI)\n[3]. For any individual, an FI can be calculated as a count of\nthe number of health deficits they have accumulated, which is\nexpressed as the proportion of health deficits considered [3].\nFor example, in a health survey that recorded 50 deficits, a\nperson with no deficits would have an FI of 0/50 = 0; one\nwho had accumulated 20 deficits would have an FI score of\nindependently validated by several groups and shown to be\nclosely related to the risk of death [4\u00ad12].\nIn general, vulnerability to death and other adverse out-\ncomes is said to arise from the `loss of physiological reserve',\nwhich can be quantified according to a reliability theory of\nageing that is rooted in engineering concepts [13, 14]. The\nbody thus is seen as a complex system with significant redun-\ndancies that diminish as deficits accumulate. When redun-\ndancy is exhausted, the system can accumulate no new\ndeficits without failure. Characteristically, redundancy exhaus-\nsuch a quantifiable submaximal limit to frailty (i.e. a limit at\nFI < 1.0) is of considerable interest. If a quantifiable limit to\nfrailty is verifiable, it has the potential to aid public health\nplanning, as well as to assist clinical decision-making in being\nable to better estimate risks. The Chinese Longitudinal Health\na severe test of the hypothesis of a limit to frailty, because it\ncontains data on a large number of people, who at the age of\n80+ years, have lived past the average life expectancy for their\ncohort, and who therefore would be candidates to exceed the\nlimit to frailty. Another group has shown that levels of frailty\nincrease exponentially in the CLHLS from ages 65 to 100\n[11], indicating that the CLHLS is composed of people in\nwhom worsening of health prior to death can be expected. In\nthese community dwelling, very old Chinese people, our\nobjectives were: to evaluate whether there is a quantifiable,\nsubmaximal limit to the number of health deficits that people\ncan accumulate; to examine the behaviour of deficit accumu-\nlation close to this limit and to determine the relationship\nbetween frailty and mortality.\nMethods\nParticipants and setting\nThis is a secondary analysis of data from the first four\nCLHLS. The data set contains baseline information on\nChina's 31 provinces. The survey was designed to include\nas many centenarians as would participate, yielding 2,418\nrespondents over the age of 100. For this study, centenar-\nians were omitted due to their disproportionate represen-\ntation, potential problems with age verification and\npotentially suspect generalisability, which is a subject of a\nseparate study by our group. A further 241 respondents\nwere omitted due to incomplete baseline data. The four\n912 eligible people, respectively, with mortality recorded in\nDeath data were obtained through death certificates, next\nof kin or neighbourhood committees, and all mortality\nrespective follow-up) were lost to the follow-up. The\nCLHLS used questionnaires, completed by respondents\nand/or next of kin, to record data on personal, family\nand household characteristics, lifestyle and diet, economic\nresources, social support, and physical, cognitive and psy-\nFrailty index\nThe FI was created following a standard procedure [18].\nSymptoms, signs, disabilities and diseases were considered\nas health deficits, if they: were associated with the health\nstatus; had a prevalence >1%; generally increased with\nage, recognising that some age-related adverse conditions\nbecome less common in extreme old age due to survivor\neffects; did not saturate (i.e. were found to be present in\nmost people at an early age, quantified here as a preva-\nlence of 80%) and in their aggregate, represented several\nphysiological systems [18]. Each variable was re-coded as\n0 (absence of deficit), 1 (presence of deficit) or missing.\nof which had been used by another group to construct\nother variables that met the above criteria. Of these 45\nvariables, 4 were excluded due to saturation, 2 because\nthey were not age related and 1 (`Feel lonely and isolated')\nbecause it was considered to reflect social vulnerability\nmore than frailty. For each individual, the FI score was\ncalculated by summing the deficits present and dividing\nby the 38 deficits considered (Supplementary data are\navailable in Age and Ageing online, Appendix A). No indi-\nvidual at baseline had >5% missing data. For individuals\nin whom variables had missing data, we excluded the\nvariables from the denominator and the numerator.\nOutcomes were described using all data points for four\ncycles (over 10 years). The recorded date of death was\nverified by police registry and death certificate upon\navailability. The data were obtained from Duke\nUniversity, Center for the Study of Aging and Human\nLimit to frailty in very old, community-dwelling people\nStatistical analysis\nTo identify the upper limit to frailty, for each wave, the dis-\ntributions of the FI, its maximal value and the 0.95 and\n0.99 quantiles were identified. The rate of deficit accumula-\ntion was calculated as the slope of the least squares mean\nvalue of the FI (on a logarithmic scale) in relation to age.\nTo evaluate whether the rate of deficit accumulation slows\nwith increasing frailty, the best fit log of the FI was evalu-\nated in relation to age, having separated the data into 95\nand 99th percentiles, as detailed elsewhere [15].\nBinary logistic regression was used to evaluate the rela-\ntionship between the baseline FI and mortality at each\nwave. Kaplan\u00adMeier analysis was used to estimate the\n7-year survival in relation to the FI. To compare the impact\nof age, sex and frailty on mortality, Cox proportional\nhazards regression models were employed. Proportionality\nof hazards assumption was tested by correlating corre-\nsponding sets of scaled Schoenfeld residuals with a suitable\ntransformation of time for each estimate. All analyses were\nperformed using SPSS version 15.0 for Windows or codes\ndeveloped using Matlab version 7.1 (Matsoft, Inc.).\nResults\nPeople who were frailer tended to be older, more often\nwomen, less likely married and had no formal education\n(Table 1). The statistical density distributions (Figure 1)\nwere typically skewed, with long right tails. Consistent with\noverall worsening health, the mean FI value increased from\ntive wave. Even so, an upper limit to frailty was observed at\nthe outset and was not exceeded: at each wave, 99% of\nrespondents had FI scores <0.7 (Figure 1). No one at base-\nline had an FI > 0.7; one person did at a subsequent wave,\nbut survived for only a few months thereafter.\nThe mean of the logarithm of the FI was highly corre-\nlated with age (r = 0.97 at baseline). This mean increased at\n3.2% per year (Supplementary data are available in Age\nand Ageing online, Appendix B). In all four waves, the mean\nvalues of the FI increased exponentially as a function of\nage. At the 95 and 99th percentiles of the FI, the slope of\nthe mean FI values (in relation to age) was not statistically\nsignificantly different from zero, indicating no more deficit\naccumulation with age at the highest levels of the FI.\nThe relationship between the death rate and baseline FI\nscores was well represented by logistic curves for each\nfollow-up interval (Figure 2A). The death rate for those\nwho were healthiest at baseline (i.e. baseline FI = 0)\nyears. At each wave, 100% 2-year mortality was observed at\nFI values close to 0.67 (i.e. the 2-year death rate from wave\noccurred at baseline FI values >0.45.\nKaplan\u00adMeier survival analysis showed decreasing cu-\nmulative survival probabilities for increasing FI (Figure 2B).\nThe proportional hazards analyses indicated that an indivi-\ndual's deficit count, age and sex were significant predictors\nof survival for baseline, 2-year and 4-year death data\n(Supplementary data are available in Age and Ageing online,\nAppendix C).\nDiscussion\npeople aged 80\u00ad99 years as the accumulation of deficits\nand evaluated the behaviour of deficit accumulation in rela-\ntion to mortality so that we could test whether a limit to\nfrailty was present. In this high-risk group of very old\nadults, a 99% limit to frailty was observed at an FI value of\n0.7, with little change in the shape of the distribution of the\nFI over 7 years. Consistent with earlier analyses [14], we\nobserved deceleration in deficit accumulation in relation to\nage with increasing FI scores. The data showed a consistent\nand non-trivial increase in the death rate as a function of\nthe FI, as well as the expected acceleration in mortality at\neach wave. Even so, in this evidently high-risk group of\nvery old adults, the hypothesised limit to frailty was never\nexceeded.\nIn addition to the consistent limit, the distributions of\nthe FI wave were characteristically skewed [20] and showed\na marked decrease in the area under the curve with each\nsubsequent wave (Figure 1A).

Bennett et al.\ndistributions of the FI values stayed about the same\n(Figure 1B). Over 7 years, there was little change in the\nmode, and a small decrease in the proportion of people\nwith FI = 0 (the so-called `zero state' of frailty). This\nappears to reflect the nature of system failure and proper-\nties of the limit. Without a limit, it might be expected that\nan increased mean FI would arise from the mode shifting\nto the right and the maximum value approaching unity.\nInstead, the distribution shows that even though there is a\nsmall increment in the FI mode, and a small decrement in\npeople with FI = 0, there is no corresponding increase in\nthe proportion with the highest FI values. That is due to\ncomplete mortality as the limit is approached (at 2 years,\nwith FI = 0.67). This is also in keeping with a report from\nCanada on adults aged 70+ years at baseline [14].\nAs before, the average rate of deficit accumulation decel-\nerated in relation to age as the FI increased [3, 14, 20]. In\nother words, as respondents became frailer, they accumu-\nlated deficits at a slower rate. This result supports the\nconcept of physiological redundancy exhaustion [13, 14],\nunderstood as follows. Any system with a large amount of\naccumulated damage can only tolerate a finite amount of\nadditional damage without failure. In consequence, slopes\nof deficit accumulation in relation to age eventually attenu-\nate to zero because further deficit accumulation is not pos-\nsible. This is not because of a lower risk of death, but\nrather due to higher one: the alternative to further deficit\naccumulation is less likely improvement than it is death.\nMortality, as it relates to frailty, has been examined in\nCLHLS data before and showed, as here, that deficit\naccumulation is tightly linked to the risk of death, indicating\nthat frail adults are more likely to die [11, 19]. What this\nstudy adds is the exploration of the limit. Note too, that as\nwe used an older sample (the youngest respondents here\nwere 15 years older than in other CLHLS studies) the\ndeath rates were notably higher, even for those fittest at\nbaseline and particularly for the 7-year outcomes. Another\nrecent report from China found a similarly high mortality\nrate for adults aged 85 and older from the Beijing\nLongitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) database [21]. These\nreports suggest that at this age, at least in China during the\ntime periods observed, high levels of deficit accumulation\nwere lethal.\nOur data must be interpreted with caution. The baseline\ncohort included 36% who were centenarians, whom we\nFigure 1.

Additional analyses of this group\nalso showed a consistent limit to the FI at 0.7 (data not\nshown); even so, the study of centenarians appears to be es-\npecially susceptible to local influences, sex compositions\nand familial effects, making generalisation uncertain [22, 23].\nFor these reasons, we have focused on this more restricted,\nbut still very elderly sample. The data also chiefly come\nfrom self or informant reports, although in work on other\naspects of the FI, we have found no difference between esti-\nmates based on self-reported, observer-assessed or test\ndata, as long as the usual criteria for selecting health deficits\nare applied [24]. Despite these limitations, important proper-\nties of the FI (high correlation with age, highly associated\nwith mortality and a submaximal limit at 0.7) held here [1, 3,\ndefined by a frailty phenotype [29]. How these findings can\nbe applied to the phenotype requires additional investiga-\ntion; the data here do not allow the phenotype to be identi-\nfied. In any case, a recent report suggests that difficulties in\noperationalising the frailty phenotype limit its utility in the\nThe high death rates and the empirical limit to frailty\nhave important implications for understanding health in\nolder adults. Previously, we have considered frailty chiefly in\nyounger samples (mostly 55+ years) from several nations.\nImportant properties of frailty observed there also seem to\nhold here. Notable results of this study include what did\nnot happen in a large sample with a high mortality rate; the\ndistribution changed little and the limit was not exceeded.\nInstead, with time, fewer people survived and even fewer\nhad little wrong with them. Especially for healthcare deliv-\nery systems which view as normative patients with just one\nsingle illness, as exemplified in ideas such as diagnostic par-\nsimony and the `most responsible diagnosis', this increase\nin frailty will pose important challenges. The FI quantifies\nthe vulnerability to adverse outcomes of people with many\nhealth problems.
