The objective of this\nstudy is to assess the independent association of WBC types and other inflammatory markers with the presence of\nreduced ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI), a marker of subclinical peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\nMethods & Results--Cross-sectional study in 3949 individuals 40 years of age without known cardiovascular disease\nwho participated in the 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). PAD was defined\nas an ABI 0.9 in at least 1 leg. After adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, the odds ratios of PAD\ntypes and inflammatory markers were simultaneously included in the full model, the corresponding odds ratios were\nConclusions--Monocytes were the only WBC type significantly and independently associated with PAD in a\nrepresentative sample of the U.S. population after adjustment for other inflammatory markers. These findings reflect the\npotential role of circulating monocyte counts as markers of atherosclerosis. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol.\nKey Words: NHANES  subclinical atherosclerosis  peripheral arterial disease  white blood cells  monocyte count\nAtherogenesis is a chronic inflammatory process charac-\nterized by early leukocyte recruitment that continues\nthroughout plaque maturation and rupture.1,2 Indeed, white\nblood cell (WBC) count elevation has been consistently\nassociated with cardiovascular events.3,4 However, WBC\ncount includes several cell types with potentially different\npathogenic roles in atherogenesis. Although monocyte-mac-\nrophages play a central role in atherogenesis,5\u00ad7 little atten-\ntion has been paid to the association of monocyte count with\nsubclinical atherosclerosis. Few studies have assessed the\nassociation of specific WBC types with cardiovascular end\npoints,8 and these studies have not evaluated the specific\ncontribution of circulating monocytes with respect to other\nWBC types and markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive\nprotein (CRP) and fibrinogen.9\u00ad11\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is strongly associated\nwith increased levels of inflammatory markers, including\nWBC count, CRP, and fibrinogen.12\u00ad14 The objective of this\nstudy was to assess the association of circulating blood\nmonocytes and other WBC types with the presence of\nreduced ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI), a highly\nspecific marker of PAD.15\u00ad18 We were specifically interested\nin the independent contribution of each cell type after\nadjustment for CRP, fibrinogen, and traditional cardiovascu-\nlar risk factors.\nMethods\nSince the 1960s, the National Center for Health Statistics has\nconducted the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys\n(NHANES), a series of cross-sectional surveys designed to provide\ndata representative of the noninstitutionalized civilian U.S. popula-\nmeasurements were only available in NHANES since 1999.

In addition\nto these exclusion criteria, some individuals who were eligible for\nthe examination (40 years) might not have received the examina-\ntion due to the following multiple reasons: (1) casts, ulcers, dress-\nings, or other conditions of the participant interfered with testing, (2)\nparticipant could not understand the test instructions, (3) participant\nbecame ill and the test could not be performed, (4) there was an\nequipment failure, (5) participant refused, (6) participant came late or\nleft early from the MEC and the LED examination could not be\nperformed, or (7) some other reason. As a result, these eligible\npersons will have missing data for the ABI variables. Overall 5083\nindividuals 40 years of age had a valid ABI measurement.\nIndividuals with a known history of stroke, myocardial infarction,\nangina, and congestive heart failure (n749) were excluded. We also\nexcluded participants with ABI values 1.4 (n68)19 and those with\nindividuals in the present study.\nAnkle Brachial Index\nA specific protocol was used to measure ABI in NHANES 1999 to\n2002.20 Systolic blood pressure was measured on the right arm\n(brachial artery) or the left arm if only choice, and both ankles\n(posterior tibial arteries) with a Doppler device (Parks Mini-\nLaboratory IV, model 3100, Parks Medical Electronics). Systolic\nblood pressure was measured twice at each site for participants 40 to\n59 years of age and once at each site for participants 60 years of\nage. The left and right ABI measurements were obtained by dividing\nthe ankle systolic blood pressure for each side respectively by the\nsystolic brachial blood pressure, or by using the mean pressures for\nparticipants with 2 blood pressure measurements at each site. PAD\nwas defined as an ABI value 0.9 in at least 1 leg.21\nWBC Counts, C-Reactive Protein, and Fibrinogen\nWBC count was determined on a Coulter Counter Model S-PLUS JR\n(Coulter Electronics). Target coefficients of variation were 3.0%.\nHigh-sensitivity CRP was measured using latex-enhanced nephe-\nlometry on a Behring Nephelometer Analyzer System (Behring\nDiagnostics, Inc) with NA Latex CRP Kit (Behring Diagnostics,\nInc). The intra-assay coefficient of variation was 3.2%. Fibrinogen\nwas determined by a comparison of the clotting time from a sample\nwith that of a standardized fibrinogen preparation obtained on a\nCoagamate XC Plus automated coagulation analyzer (Organon\nTeknika). The intra-assay coefficients of variation ranged from 1.7 to\n3.9%. Details about laboratory procedures and quality control in\nNHANES are available elsewhere.22\nOther Variables\nAge, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking were assessed by self-report.\nObesity was defined as a body mass index 30 kg/m2. Hypertension\nwas defined as mean systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg, mean\ndiastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, or a self-report of a physician\ndiagnosis or medication use. Mean blood pressure was composed of\nup to 4 readings on 2 separate occasions. Hypercholesterolemia was\ndefined as a total cholesterol 240 mg/dL, or a self-report of a\nphysician diagnosis or medication use. Diabetes was defined as a\nfasting glucose 126 mg/dL, or a nonfasting glucose 200 mg/dL,\nor a self report of a physician diagnosis or medication use. Glomer-\nular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by the Modification of Diet\nin Renal Disease (MDRD) Study formula.23 Mild kidney dysfunction\nStatistical Analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using svy commands in Stata\nversion 8 to account for the complex sampling design and weights in\nWBC type counts and CRP were markedly right skewed and were\nlog-transformed for statistical analysis. They were described as\ngeometric means and 95% confidence intervals. Pearson correlations\nbetween WBC types and inflammatory markers were calculated.\nWBC types, CRP, and fibrinogen were divided into quartiles\naccording to the weighted distribution of the whole sample. Because\nof the small number of distinct levels, basophil count was grouped in\nrespectively), and eosinophil count was grouped in 3 categories (\nrespectively). Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds\nratios for the prevalence of PAD in quartiles 2 to 4 of inflammatory\nmarkers compared with the first quartile. Tests for trend across\nincreasing quartiles (or prespecified cutoffs for eosinophils and\nbasophils) were computed by introducing variables with the median\nlevel for each quartile in the regression models.\nThree sets of multivariable models were used to examine the\nassociation of WBC types, CRP, and fibrinogen in a hierarchical\nfashion. Model 1 adjusted for age, sex, and race. Model 2 further\nadjusted for traditional risk factors (smoking status, obesity, hyper-\ntension, diabetes, hypercholesteremia, and GFR). Model 3 adjusted\nsimultaneously for WBC types, CRP, and fibrinogen in addition to\nthe covariates included in Model 2.\nResults\ncount, CRP, and fibrinogen were higher in PAD cases\ncompared with non-cases (all P0.001; Table 1). Among\nWBC subtypes, only monocytes and neutrophils were signif-\nicantly higher in PAD cases.\nCRP and fibrinogen were strongly correlated (r0.54), but\ntheir correlation with WBC subtypes was weaker (r0.30 for\nall WBC subtypes; Table 2). Among WBC types, neutrophils\nwere the most strongly correlated with CRP and fibrinogen.\nTABLE 1.

In risk factor adjusted models, the odds\nratios comparing the prevalence of PAD in the highest versus\nfibrinogen. Basophils or eosinophils were not associated with\nPAD in either model (data not shown).\nWhen WBC types, CRP, and fibrinogen were introduced in\nthe models in addition to traditional cardiovascular risk\nfactors, monocytes and fibrinogen were still associated with\nPAD prevalence (Table 3, Model 3). The odds ratios com-\nparing the prevalence of PAD in the highest versus the lowest\nIn subgroup analysis, the association of monocyte count with\nPAD was similar irrespective of the presence or absence of\ntraditional risk factors and other inflammatory markers (not\nshown).\nDiscussion\nMultiple lines of evidence indicate that inflammation plays a\npivotal role in atherogenesis, and that inflammatory markers\nsuch as WBC count may aid in the detection of individuals at\nhigher atherosclerotic risk.24 In this cross-sectional study of\napparently healthy men and women, an elevated monocyte\ncount was significantly associated with PAD after adjustment\nfor traditional risk factors. This relationship was not present\nfor other WBC types, and it was independent of CRP and\nfibrinogen.\nWBC is a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular\nevents,25\u00ad28 and for the prevalence and progression of sub-\nclinical atherosclerosis.29,30 A recent meta-analysis concluded\nthat, among WBC types, neutrophils were more strongly\nassociated with future coronary events than monocytes,31 but\nnone of the studies described in this meta-analysis simulta-\nneously controlled for other WBC types, CRP, or fibrinogen.\nIn our study, neutrophils were more strongly associated with\nCRP and fibrinogen than monocytes, and adjusting for CRP\nand fibrinogen virtually eliminated the association of neutro-\nphils with PAD. Inflammation is associated with virtually all\nstages of vascular disease including atherogenesis, plaque\nrupture, and end-organ damage secondary to ischemia and/or\nembolism. It is conceivable that monocyte counts may be\nmore strongly related to early development and progression\nof atherosclerosis,32,33 but once established atherosclerotic\ndisease is present, they do not strongly influence the risk of\nevents. Quantification of the predictive ability of monocyte\ncounts will require fresh evidence from prospective studies\nwith serial measurements of WBC counts, differentials, and\nother inflammatory markers.\nThere is extensive evidence for the active contribution of\nmonocytes to atherosclerotic lesion development.34.35 The\ninfiltration of circulating monocytes into the blood vessel\nwall, where they are transformed into lipid-laden foam cells,\nis one of the earliest events in the development of atheroscle-\nrotic lesions. Monocytes are believed to play a critical role\nnot only in initiation of atherosclerosis, but also at multiple\nstages including promotion of plaque instability and remod-\neling after a myocardial insult.36\nThe classical immunophenotypic marker for monocytes is\nCD14, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor.37 However, at\nleast 2 distinct subpopulations of monocytes can be distin-\nguished from the expression patterns of membrane surface\nantigens. About 10% of monocytes coexpress CD16, the\nlow-affinity Fc-gamma receptor III. CD14/CD16 mono-\ncytes are considered \"proinflammatory monocytes\" as they\nefficiently produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-),38\nwhile producing little antiinflammatory cytokine\nmonocytes.39 Levels of TNF- are known to correlate with\ncarotid intima\u00admedia thickness.40 In addition, CD14/\nCD16 monocytes are expanded in hypercholestremic pa-\ntients,35 negatively correlated to HDL cholesterol levels,35\nand associated in a dose-dependent fashion with the expres-\nsion of the more positively charged apo E4.35\nIn a small case\u00adcontrol study, Schlitt et al found CD14/\nCD16 monocytes to be significantly associated with the\nprevalence of coronary artery disease,41 but the retrospective\nTABLE 2.

Because Schlitt et al measured monocyte\nlevels in cases after occurrence of clinical events, it is\nimpossible to determine in this study whether CD14/\nCD16 levels contributed to the event or were a consequence\nof it. The evaluation of the role of CD14/CD16 mono-\ncytes in atherosclerosis progression and cardiovascular out-\ncomes in prospective studies should be a research priority.\nIn our study, fibrinogen was also independently associated\nwith the prevalence of PAD after taking into account CVD\nrisk factors, WBC differentials, and CRP. The finding is\nconsistent with previous reports demonstrating fibrinogen to\nbe associated with incident CHD events as well subclinical\natherosclerosis adjusting for other inflammatory markers.42\u00ad45\nIn the Caerphilly study, controlling for CRP did not diminish\nthe effect of fibrinogen for incident CHD indicating it to be a\nmore specific CHD risk factor.43 In a population sample of\nclinically overt atherosclerotic disease, elevated fibrinogen\nlevels was related to carotid IMT independently of a wide\nrange of important confounding variables including CRP.44\nBaseline fibrinogen levels have also been observed to be\nassociated with higher carotid intimal thickness (IMT) levels\nin a 5-year follow-up in the Edinburgh Artery Study.45 Higher\nfibrinogen levels may potentially promote atherosclerosis by\nincreasing platelet adhesion to the subendothelium as well\naffecting endothelial function.46,47 Our and previous findings\nsupport the role of fibrinogen as an independent marker of\ngeneralized atherosclerotic lesions in major arterial beds.\nThe strengths of our study include the rigorous methodol-\nogy and extensive quality control of NHANES procedures,\nthe use of a nationally representative sample, and the use of\na validated and specific measure of PAD. Our findings,\nhowever, must be interpreted in the context of certain\nTABLE 3.

Because of the cross-sectional design, we could\nnot determine whether circulating monocytes are directly\nrelated to the atherosclerotic process or their recruitment is\nstimulated by the presence of atherosclerotic lesions. Our\nstudy lacked information on monocyte subtypes as well on\nthe presence of viral or bacterial infections that may be\nimplicated in atherogenesis and may affect monocyte count.\nWhether an elevated monocyte count has direct vascular or\nprothrombotic effects, is merely increased secondarily to\nprevalent atherosclerosis, or is simply a marker of an uncer-\ntain environmental or infectious stimulus remains to be\ndetermined. Confirmation of these findings in prospective\nstudies is of critical importance. Finally, in our study WBC\ndetermination was performed once; factors such as infections,\nday-to-day variations, as well as variability in WBC determi-\nnation may have potentially effected our findings by catego-\nrizing participants with lower levels as having higher levels\nand vice versa.48 It is generally considered that impact of such\ndilution bias underestimates the true associations with CVD\ntion of monocyte count with PAD observed in our study is\npotentially likely to be underestimated.\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrates for the first time an independent\nassociation between monocyte count and peripheral arterial\ndisease defined as a reduced ankle-brachial blood pressure\nindex in a large population based study. More detailed\ncharacterization of the association between different mono-\ncyte populations and clinical and subclinical atherosclerotic\noutcomes is needed to better characterize the role of inflam-\nmatory cells in atherosclerosis.\nReferences\n1.
