    "abstract": "Abstract\nBoth children and adults exhibit moderate conformity behaviors when facing group pressure. While some studies purport that\nchildren conform more with age, others have shown the opposite. The publicity of decision-making might be a major factor\ninfluencing the development of children's conformity behavior. In this study, we recruited 295 Chinese children aged 9\u00ad15 years.\nWe observed no significant correlation between children's age and conformity behaviors when their answers were kept confi-\ndential. However, older children showed stronger conformity behaviors when their answers were made public. According to\ncultural evolutionary theory, with age, children find group acceptance and social recognition increasingly more important, which\nexplains why older children are more likely to conform--namely, doing so has adaptive value. Further research should explore the\ncross-cultural coherence of this phenomenon and the genuine motivation behind children's conformity behaviors. Meanwhile,\ndesigning a more reliable and valid experiment would also be a fruitful direction.\n",

Conformity refers to the\ncommon phenomenon that individuals' behaviors or attitudes\nbecome consistent with those of other group members under\nthe real or imagined pressure from those group members\nmity usually has negative connotations--such as a lack of\nindependence and assertion--it is nevertheless important for\nadapting to a changing society in most cases. Conformity is an\nimportant mechanism for social learning and can help indi-\nviduals learn social information quickly and accomplish\nsocialization smoothly (Boyd & Richerson, 1985). Formal\ncultural evolution theory holds that conformity promotes the\ndevelopment of cultural diversity and in-group stability (Hen-\nConformity tends to appear at around age 3 and persists into\nadulthood (Corriveau & Harris, 2010). Furthermore, children's\nconformity has been shown to increase with age. Costanzo and\nShaw (1966) investigated participants' conformity behavior at\ndifferent ages and found that conformity was lowest among\nthose aged 7\u00ad9; it then increased with age to an asymptotic\npoint at 11\u00ad13 years of age. Other researchers have reported\nonly a slight increase in conformity between 3 and 10 years of\nage (Hamm & Hoving, 1969; Iscoe, Williams, & Harvey,\nthey age, children's conformity behavior approaches that of\nadults--that is, children become more sensitive to the unan-\nimous majority opinion. According to cultural evolutionary\ntheory, this conformity is adaptive. However, a few studies\nhave shown that children become less prone to conform with\nage. For instance, some researchers showed that children's\nlevel of conformity decreased significantly between 3 and 10\nyears of age (Bishop & Beckman, 1971; Cohen, Bornstein, &\n1 Department of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China\n2 Beijing Key Laboratory of Applied Experimental Psychology, Beijing, China\n3 School of Government, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China\nCorresponding Author:\nXiangping Liu, Department of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, 1512\nEvolutionary Psychology\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/evp\nCreative Commons CC BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further permission\nprovided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nreported a decline in conformity responses between 3 and 17\nyears of age, while Ceci and Bruck (1993) concluded that the\nyounger the children are, the more susceptible they are to\ninformation given by others.\nUsing mathematical models and experimental studies,\nresearchers have identified various factors that can influence\nindividuals' conformity behaviors such as the objects of con-\nformity (e.g., parents or peers; Costanzo, 1970), cognitive\nstyle (Witkin, Moore, Goodenough, & Cox, 1977), gender\n(Chen, Corriveau, & Harris, 2013), and task difficulty. These\nfactors may be the reason for the lack of consistency in study\nresults. For instance, a recent study found that 7-year-olds, but\nnot 3-year-olds, copied others more on difficult trials than on\neasy trials (Morgan, Laland, & Harris, 2015). For the easy\ntrials, children aged 3\u00ad9 years showed no significant differ-\nences in conformity. In another study, a sample of Caucasian\nfemales aged 7\u00ad15 years conformed more than did African\nAmerican females of a similar age range (Iscoe, Williams, &\nyears conformed more than did their Anglo-American coun-\nThe impact of gender, race, and task difficulty on children's\ntendency to conform has been previously explored. However,\nthere have been few studies on the effect of the publicity of\ndecision-making on the development of children's conformity\nbehavior. Researchers have suggested that in an anonymous\ncontext, in both childhood and adulthood, individuals con-\nsciously or unconsciously make judgments and decisions by\nreferring to others' behaviors and opinions in order to ensure\nthat they have acted properly (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955;\nHornsey, Majkut, Terry, & McKimmie, 2003). By contrast,\nin public conditions, individuals tend to go against their own\nopinions to match those of the majority in order to avoid group\nisolation or obtain a positive assessment from others (Mann,\nolds to make a judgment anonymously under the pressure of a\nunanimous majority opinion; later, the children were informed\nthat their judgment would be revealed and were given the\nopportunity to revise the decision. They found that most of the\nchildren with the minority opinion chose to alter their judgment\nto fit with the majority. Thus, children appear to be differently\nsensitive to the unanimous majority opinion depending on\nwhether their responses are anonymous or public.\nOur study examines the influence of publicity on children's\nconformity behavior from a developmental perspective. We\npresume that older children are more likely to conform in a\npublic context. Previous studies have demonstrated that older\nchildren are more sensitive to group opinions compared to\nyounger children (Morgan et al., 2015). Additionally,\nAloise-Young (1993) found that conformity can be used stra-\ntegically by children to manage others' evaluations of their\npublic self after 8 years of age. The potential conflict that\ncould arise from standing alone against a majority, based on\npast experience, compelled children to avoid such conflicts by\ngiving the same response as the majority (Haun & Tomasello,\n2011). Therefore, the older the children, the more readily they\nwill go against their own judgments and respond in a way\nconsistent with the majority when they are in conflict with\nother group members.\nSpecifically, children may show less conformity as they\ngrow older in an anonymous context. Previous studies have\nshown that, in early childhood, the mechanism for integrating\nsocial information into decision-making is immature. Thus,\nyounger children are more likely to rely on guidance from\nothers when they encounter uncertain or difficult problems\n(Corriveau & Harris, 2010; Herrmann, Legare, Harris, &\nWhitehouse, 2013; Williamson, Meltzoff, & Markman,\n2008). However, they appear to grow more decisive with age.\nChildren continue to accumulate historical experience through\nconstant study and practice, which in turn makes children rel-\natively likely to stand firm in their opinion when faced with\nconflicting views, especially in an anonymous context\n(Rebecca & Deborah, 2014). In fact, individuals' degree of\nconfidence is a strong predictor of whether they ultimately\nrevise their initial judgment (Minson & Mueller, 2012; Mor-\ngan, Rendell, Ehn, Hoppitt, & Laland, 2011; See, Morrison,\nIn summary, we assume that children are more likely to\nconform in a public context, whereas they will be less likely\nto in an anonymous context. To test this hypothesis, we con-\nducted an experimental study in which children aged 9\u00ad15\nyears were asked to execute a modified Asch conformity task.\nWe measured participants' preestablished convictions in order\nto help eliminate bias in our results. Previous studies on the\nconformity of young children typically used the classical Asch\nparadigm, with the index of conformity being whether chil-\ndren's answer was consistent with the majority. However, that\nparadigm does not account for the possibility that children\nmade the same answer as the unanimous majority indepen-\ndently, without feeling pressured by other members of their\ngroup. Thus, if the results of the preestablished convictions\nmeasurement are incompatible with those of the formal task,\nwe then can say that the minority children submitted to group\npressure when giving their judgment publicly. In this experi-\nment, three participants were chosen as the size of the majority\nin order to guarantee optimal results.\nMaterial and Method\nParticipants\nA total of 309 children were recruited through broadcasts and\nflyers at a primary school from Grades 3\u00ad6 in Gansu Province.\nUltimately, 295 nine- to fifteen-year-old children participated\nin the study with the consent of their guardians (14 children's\nguardians did not provide informed consent). All children were\nHan Chinese and had normal vision and were without color\nblindness or mental illness. Furthermore, none was receiving\npsychological treatment. Each of the participants received\nUS$10 in return for their participation in the experiment.\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nModified Asch Paradigm\nOur experiment used the modified Asch paradigm created by\nZhang, Deng, Yu, Zhao, and Liu (2016). First, participants\nwere given the following instructions: \"Please determine\nwhether the pair of pictures shown on the left side of the screen\nare uniform in size. Meanwhile, the decisions from the other\nthree students will appear on the right side of the screen; you\ncan either choose to ignore or refer to their answers. Please try\nto make your own judgment. Press the Y button if you believe\nthat the two pictures are the same size. If not, please press the\nN button. To continue the experiment, please press Q when you\nare ready.\" Then, pictures and other participants' judgment\nappeared after a 500-ms period, during which a fixation point\nwas displayed. Another 500 ms was given before the start of the\nnext trail. We prepared 12 pairs of pictures, 6 of which were\nuniform in size. The conformity information was always unan-\nimous and always incorrect (i.e., it showed \"N\" when the two\npictures were actually the same and \"Y\" when they were differ-\nent). Children completed 24 trials in total, which took about 10\nmin or so. We ran the experiment on a PC with a 19-in. display\n2.0 (Psychology Software Tools Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). The\nscreen background was black with white text for instructions.\nAll the pictures were presented in green, and participants were\nabout 60 cm from the display. The viewing angle was about 3.\nProcedure\nThe entire experiment was approved by the ethics committee of\nthe psychology laboratory at Beijing Normal University. On the\nfirst day of the experiment, participants were asked to indicate\nwhether each pair of pictures was uniform in size. The results of\nthis experiment were regarded as participants' preestablished\nconvictions. Over the next 2 days, participants completed the\nAsch paradigm under public and anonymous conditions, respec-\ntively. In the public condition, we told children that all partici-\npants' answers (including their own and those of the three other\nstudents) would be shown to each other. By contrast, in the\nanonymous condition, each participant was told that he or she\nwould be able to see the choice of the other three students but\nthat these students would not know the participant's final deci-\nsion. Participants did not know the age or gender of the three\nother students. To avoid sequence effects, we randomly divided\nparticipants into two groups. The first group completed the pub-\nlic condition on the second day and the anonymous condition on\nthe third day, while the second group completed the conditions\nin reverse. All participants entered the 15-m2 laboratory, which\nwas appropriately lighted, alone and completed the preestab-\nlished convictions test and Asch paradigm presented on a PC.\nResults\nData Reduction\nA total of 27 participants' data were excluded: 6 voluntarily left\nduring the experiment, 9 failed to complete the experiment\nbecause of physical discomfort or a time conflict, and 12 had\nerror rates exceeding 2 standard deviations (SDs) in the Asch\ntask. Thus, the final data analysis included data from 268 valid\nsubjects (females: n \u00bc 126, Mage\n(IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).\nCorrelations Between Age and Conformity\nAll participants showed 100% correct answers on the preestab-\nlished convictions test. Thus, if participants made the incorrect\njudgment in the formal task, they would have shown confor-\nmity to the unanimous majority. Therefore, we used the error\npercentage in the Asch task as an indicator of conformity.\nA higher error percentage would imply a greater tendency to\nconform. We found that age was not significantly correlated to\nconformity in the anonymous condition (i.e., anonymous\ncorrelated in the public condition (i.e., public conformity;\ncorrelated with age (r \u00bc .704, p < .001) and public conformity\n.011, p \u00bc .855). There is substantial evidence that females,\ncompared to males, are more likely to conform (Bond & Smith,\nindeed show greater conformity than males in the public con-\nformity between females and males was not significant in the\ndefined gender as a dummy variable and conducted a hier-\narchical multiple regression analysis to understand the spe-\ncific relationship between age and conformity in the public\ncondition. The error percentage was set as the dependent vari-\nable in this analysis. Gender and grade were included in the\nfirst step of the regression equation and age in the second step.\nThe results indicated that age still positively predicted con-\nformity in the public condition even after controlling for error\npercentage and grade (see Table 1).\nRepeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)\nFurthermore, we conducted a repeated measures ANOVA to\ncompare the mean differences between error percentages that\nhad been split across ages and conditions. The main effect of\ncondition was not significant, F(1, 261) < 1. The main effect of\nThe error percentages increased with age (see Table 2). The\nCondition \u00c2 Age interaction was critically significant, F(6,\nrevealed that the error percentages increased with age in public\n2), while the same was not significant in anonymous condition,\nZhang et al. 3\nDiscussion\nWe used a modified Asch paradigm to investigate the devel-\nopment of conformity behaviors under public and anonymous\nconditions using 268 nine- to fifteen-year-old children. We\nfound that children' conformity behaviors were relatively sta-\nble with age in the anonymous condition. However, children\nshowed greater conformity with age when they had to make a\ndecision in public. We measured participants' preestablished\nconvictions to ensure that the results were more valid; in other\nwords, it ensured that children's conformity behaviors in the\nAsch task were actually due to the effect of the unanimous\nmajority rather than random choices.\nIt is not difficult to understand why children would sub-\nmit to the unanimous majority. Early studies by Asch (1956)\nand Deutsch and Gerard (1955) argued that conformity\nbehaviors are, in most cases, adaptive. Indeed, the theory\nof cultural evolution explains that conformity behaviors pro-\nmote in-group consistency and help individuals acquire\nappropriate behavioral norms (Henrich & Henrich, 2007).\nChildren, as a vulnerable group in society, tend to lack\nadaptive conventional knowledge and thus are perhaps able\nto account for their weaknesses through conformity. There-\nfore, they conformed to majority in both public and anon-\nymous conditions.\nWe found that children showed a greater tendency to con-\nform with age in the public condition, which is consistent with\nour assumptions. Previous studies have shown that, with age,\nchildren become more adept at adjusting their degree of con-\nformity according to the privacy of their response (Haun &\nTomasello, 2011). When making decisions in public, the older\nthey were, the more children would submit to others' opinion,\neven if they knew the others' opinion was wrong. Similarly,\nthere is evidence that children manage others' evaluations of\ntheir own public images at the age of eight onward, as part of\nseeking group acceptance and a more positive self-concept\n(Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004). These studies all revealed that,\nas age increases, children become increasingly concerned with\nothers' opinions. Accordingly, they show greater conformity in\npublic. Our results also support these conclusions.\nWe found no significant differences in children's confor-\nmity tendency across ages in the anonymous condition, which\nis not consistent with our assumptions. Previous research found\nthat older children possess more advanced cognitive abilities,\nare more confident, and are less reliant on social information\nwhen compared to younger children, especially when they\nwould not have to worry about pressure from the majority\n(Rebecca & Deborah, 2014). This means children would show\nless conformity in the anonymous condition with age. How-\never, we found that children's conformity tendency changed\nlittle in the anonymous condition across ages. This implied that\n9- to 15-year-olds have developed relatively stable conformity\ntendency. Previous experience has taught them that it is useful\nto be in line with the majority, even though they know their\nchoices will not be seen by others. Moreover, this evolved\nbehavioral strategy was free from specific environmental influ-\nences. Another possible reason for this is that our pattern judg-\nment task is too simple for children aged 9\u00ad15. Preestablished\nconvictions test showed that children of different ages may\nhave the same degree of confidence in their judgments. How-\never, the distinction between younger and older children in\nconformity is only evident when the experimental task has a\ncertain degree of difficulty (Hanayama & Mori, 2011). In addi-\ntion, females show more conformity to the unanimous majority\nthan males when making decisions publicly but not when they\nare made anonymously, and this pattern has been observed in\nprevious studies (Lee, 2006). Researchers believe that females\nare usually expected to be gentle and submissive, and females\ntend to behave more in conformity with expectations (Cross,\nOur research has some limitations. First, previous research\nhas shown that children are highly sensitive to social informa-\ntion (Fusaro & Harris, 2008). It is possible that, because the\nunanimous majority's judgments in our task were always\nwrong, children engaged in speculation about the purpose of\nthe trial. Additionally, their conformity behaviors might have\nbeen affected by their repetitive encountering of information\nthat is inconsistent with their preestablished convictions.\nFuture research might seek a better balance (half vs. half)\nbetween consistent and inconsistent tasks. Second, Corriveau\nand Harris (2010) pointed out that being from a collectivist\nculture (e.g., China) influences the results of conformity\nexperiments; in particular, when using the Asch paradigm,\nchildren from such cultures are more likely to conform to the\nmajority. This is because they are more concerned with social\nexpectations. Future research should explore the cross-cultural\nTable 1.

Mean Error Percentages Between Ages and Conditions.\nAge (Number) Female Ratio (%)\nAnonymous Public\nNote. SD \u00bc standard deviation.\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nconsistency in the development of children's conformity beha-\nviors when making public decisions. Finally, while previous\nliterature has suggested that children's conformity behavior is\nadaptive, we did not directly investigate children's motivations\nin this study. Any number of motivations might compel indi-\nviduals to conform, and it would be necessary to understand\nthese motivations in order to fully understand the development\nof children's conformity behaviors. Future research should\nindeed examine the perspective of motivation.\nDespite these limitations, we believe our findings are mean-\ningful. When in a public situation, children become increas-\ningly likely to conform to others' opinions as they age even in\nthe event of the other individual's opinions being wrong, while\ntheir conformity behaviors remain relatively stable in anon-\nymous situations. This finding emphasizes the impact of group\nstress on children. It is adaptive to learn how to better get along\nwith the group as early as possible. Humans have evolved a\nseries of behavioral strategies, such as conformity, to benefit\nfrom groups through long-term social life and culture. Older\nchildren seem to be better than younger children at maintaining\ntheir image in front of a group through conformity, because\nthey show more conformity in a public choice. This tendency\nensures that children engage in smooth socialization. Our\nresearch supports the theory of cultural evolution and provides\nsome clues on how conformity behaviors develop.\n"
