With the exception of a few studies (5,\n11), little research has focused on national changes in adult\nbeverage consumption by sociodemographic groups, body\nweight status, and weight-loss intention. To our knowledge, no\nresearch has examined these factors simultaneously. The dis-\nproportionate effect of obesity on minority and low socioeco-\nassociation between intention to lose weight and weight control\nbehaviors (15\u00ad17), the significant effect of even modest weight\nloss on the elimination or reduction of adverse health conditions\nassociated with obesity (18), and evidence suggesting that cal-\nories in liquid may be less well compensated than calories from\nsolid foods (19, 20) make this is an important area of study.\nAlthough the complex interactions between factors that cause\nobesity are not fully understood, it is widely accepted that\na positive energy balance (higher caloric intake than energy\nexpenditure) leads to weight gain (21, 22). Reduction of SSBs in\nthe adult diet may help prevent weight gain and promote weight\nloss. Such efforts may offer relatively simple, low-cost solutions\nto weight reduction and are consistent with recommended bev-\nerage consumption patterns (23, 24). Moreover, the identifica-\ntion of variations in beverage consumption by subpopulation\ngroups will be useful for the development of targeted policies or\nnutrition programs aimed at reducing intake of ``empty calo-\nries'' among adults, particularly those from SSBs.\nThe purpose of this study was to describe national changes\nconsumed, consumption location, and type of beverage among\nUS adults by sociodemographic characteristics, weight category,\nand weight-loss intention. This analysis does not attempt to\nestimate the effect of SSB intake on obesity incidence, given our\nreliance on cross-sectional data. Other research, supported by\nlongitudinal data, provides strong evidence for a causal relation\nbetweenSSBintakeandincreasedbodymassindex(BMI;inkg/m2)\n1 From the Departments of Health Policy and Management (SNB), Center\nfor Human Nutrition and International Health (YW), Johns Hopkins Bloom-\nberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD; the Department of Health\nPolicy and Management, Columbia Mailman School of Public Health,\nNew York, NY (YCW); and the Department of Society, Human Develop-\nment and Health, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA (SLG).\n2 Supported by the Department of Health Policy and Management at the\nBloomberg School of Public Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Founda-\n3 Address reprint requests and correspondence to SN Bleich, Department\nof Health Policy and Management, Bloomberg School of Public Health,\nJohns Hopkins University, 624 North Broadway, Room 451, Baltimore,\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nSupplemental Material can be found at:\nData and design\nNationally representative data from the third National Health\nbased survey designed to collect information on the health and\nnutrition of the US population.

For example,\nDISCUSSION\nThe 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends\ndrinks without added sugar (24).

Overall, SSB consumption declined steeply with\nage, which may be partially because of a cohort effect (ie,\nyounger generations have increased their SSB consumption)\nSSB drinkers (72%) and were the highest consumers of SSB\ncalories (289 kcal/d) compared with older age groups.

Yet, the extent to which this maps to changes in beverage\nconsumption is not well known. This study offers useful in-\nformation about SSB consumption patterns by weight-loss in-\ntention. Our results indicate that overweight-obese adults trying\nto lose weight (compared with those without weight-loss in-\ntention) are moving in the right direction. In both surveys, the\npersons with weight-loss intention compared with persons with-\nout this intention. This suggests that persons trying to lose weight\nare drinking less SSBs and selecting SSBs with lower energy\ncontent. Yet, per capita consumption of SSBs increased among all\nweight groups over the period regardless of weight-loss intention.\nHowever, differences between the groups are small, which in-\ndicates that greater efforts are needed to empower persons trying\nto lose weight to adopt healthy eating behaviors.\nBothsimilaritiesanddifferencesarefoundbetweenourfindings\nand previous research. This study is consistent with previous work\nthatidentifiedaconsistentupwardtrendincaloriesfromSSBs(5,7,\n9\u00ad11, 32) and high SSB consumption at home (5). Compared with\ntrends in US children and adolescents, in whom the percentage of\nand in whom per capita caloric consumption of SSB increased\n(30), we observed increases inboth thepercentage ofSSB drinkers\nand the quantify of SSBs consumed among adults. This study\nimproves our understanding of adult beverage consumption by\nfocusing on variations by sociodemographic characteristics,\nweight status, and intention to lose weight.

To achieve this goal, one possibility might be to reduce the\nstandard serving size of SSBs in the workplace (eg, from a 20-oz\nbottle to a 12-oz can), given our finding of increased consumption\nper drinking occasion. Another might be to reduce the ready\navailability of SSBs, which undermines initiatives aimed at re-\nducing consumption, or to replace SSB beverage options with\nnoncaloric alternatives. This latter strategy has been effective in\nadolescents (33). Efforts to reduce SSB consumption in the\nworkplace, where we found that young adults consume a fifth of\ntheir SSB calories, would complement the growing interest\namong employers of investing in health-promotion strategies\n(34). An additional approach might be to encourage the current\ntrend toward decreased SSB consumption among overweight-\nobese persons trying to lose weight, an easy and concrete, be-\nhavioral target that may be best encouraged by physicians and\nhealth care professionals.\nIn general, strategies that promote reductions in SSB intake\nmay be easier to attain than strategies that promote increases in\nphysical activity, given the time trade-off between energy intake\nneed to walk for 50 min (rather than sit) to burn off 1 can (12 oz)\nAdditional research is needed to understand the drivers of\nincreased SSB consumption among subgroups with higher in-\ntake. For example, the recent Institute of Medicine report that\nfocused on food marketing to children (35) found that ethnic\nminorities living in poorer neighborhoods have fewer healthier\noptions (36, 37). From a policy perspective, targeted programs\namong these subpopulations, promoting reduced consumption of\nempty calories, may be useful for reducing the upward trend in\nconsuming SSBs.\nThe present study has several limitations.

Previous research indicates that adults underreport\ntheir dietary consumption by '25% (38, 39). In addition, re-\nstrained eating has been associated with underreporting of ca-\nloric intake (40). Therefore, the true difference in SSB\nconsumption between persons with weight-loss intention and\npersons not trying to lose weight may be smaller than our results\nindicate. However, available evidence does suggest better recall\naccuracy with packaged beverage items such as SSBs (41). A\nsingle 24-h dietary recall may not accurately represent usual\ndietary intake for a person. Lack of reliability of the dietary\nrecall for overall eating habits will reduce the precision of our\nPercentage of overweight-obese US adults (aged !20 y) consuming beverages and per capita caloric contribution on the\nsurvey day, by weight-loss intention and beverage, in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nNot trying to lose\nweight\nTrying to lose\nweight\nNot trying to lose\nweight\nTrying to lose\nweight\nConsumed beverages on the\nsurveyed day (%)\nPer capita caloric contribution\n(kcal/d)\nDaily caloric contribution among\ndrinkers (kcal/d)\n1 All values are means 6 SEMs. Overweight-obese was defined as BMI (in kg/m2) ! 25.

Inaccuracy exists in\nconverting reported beverage consumption to energy intake\nbecause the assumptions on serving size and food composition\nare defined by the food and nutrient database. This standard\ndatabase assumes a representative nutritional content for a given\nfood or beverage. The inevitable variation in actual intake and\nreporting bias may introduce measurement errors, particularly\nfor the estimation of total energy intake. However, this error is\nlikely less significant for packaged, standard-sized beverages.\nSecond, although we used multivariate regression models to\nadjust for demographic variables, our inferences on secular\nchanges and beverage consumption patterns between the 2 sur-\nveys may remain constrained by changes in other demographic\nvariables, but the 2 samples had comparable distributions of sex,\nage, employment status, and income status. Third, the NHANES\ndata are cross-sectional, which only allows us to address asso-\nciations rather than causality. Fourth, the intention-to-lose-\nweight question asks respondents about the previous 12 mo,\nwhereas the 24-h recall focuses on 1 d. Temporal differences may\nlimit our ability to fully capture eating practices of persons trying\nto lose weight. In addition, differences in survey methods between\nassisted interviewing for the dietary interview, but NHANES III\ndid not) may affect the comparability of data overtime.\nTo conclude, SSB consumption has increased dramatically in\nthe past decade in the United States, in parallel with the rising\nprevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Large epidemiologic\nstudies provide strong evidence for the independent effect of\nSSBs on weight gain and type 2 diabetes (1, 4). Efforts to en-\ncourage replacing SSBs with low-caloric or noncaloric alter-\nnatives may be an important strategy to reduce consumption of\nempty calories. Physicians and public health professionals are\nwell positioned to identify and promote concrete behavioral\ntargets aimed at decreasing adult SSB consumption, making\nawareness of these changes critical among that group.
