A previous\nstudy showed the most common etiology of\nvitreous hemorrhage in children was blunt\nor penetrating trauma,6 while the main\ncauses of vitreous hemorrhage in adults\nwere posterior vitreous detachment and\ndiabetic retinopathy.2 While multiple studies\nhave investigated the prognosis for vitreous\nhemorrhage caused by proliferative diabetic\nretinopathy or trauma, less is known about\nthe outcomes for patients with dense\nvitreous hemorrhage, even though it\nfrequently causes more devastating compli-\ncations. Therefore, we undertook this study\nto better understand the etiologies and visual\nprognosis following early vitrectomy\nfor dense vitreous hemorrhage in adults\nwith non-traumatic and non-diabetic\nretinopathy.\nMethods\nEthics approval and patient recruitment\nThe study was approved by the institutional\nreview board of Shandong Eye Institute,\nJinan, China and conformed to the guide-\nlines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Medical\nrecords of patients who underwent early\nvitrectomy for dense vitreous hemorrhage\nwere reviewed. All patients underwent a\ncomprehensive ophthalmic examination\nincluding VA, applanation tonometry, slit-\nlamp examination, gonioscopy, indirect\nophthalmoscopy and B-scan ultrasound.\nThe severity of vitreous hemorrhage was\nscored on a 5-point scale, which was\nmodified from a previous study: Grade 0\n(no vitreous hemorrhage); Grade 1 (minimal\nvitreous hemorrhage, optic disk and retinal\nvessels were clearly visible); Grade 2 (mild\nvitreous hemorrhage, most of the optic disk\nand retinal vessels were visible); Grade 3\n(moderate vitreous hemorrhage, optic disk,\nor retinal vessels were barely visible); Grade\n4 (severe vitreous hemorrhage was too dense\nto allow visualization of the optic disk).7,8\nWe included cases of adults who underwent\nearly vitrectomy for vitreous hemorrhage of\nGrade 3 or 4 that had a follow-up of at least\n6 months. We excluded cases of vitreous\nhemorrhage caused by trauma or prolifera-\ntive diabetic retinopathy.\nSurgery and postoperative assessment\nFor these dense vitreous hemorrhage eyes,\nsurgery was carried out once a retinal tear or\ndetachment was detected. If no retinal tear\nor detachment was found, we discussed\noptions with the patient and suggested a\nvitrectomy if predisposing factors were\nidentified. If no tear or retinal detachment\nwas found and the patient had a history of\nvascular disease in the eye, we advised a\nvitrectomy if VA remained low and showed\nno improvement for 1\u00ad3 weeks.\nAll patients were operated on at the\nShandong Eye Hospital, a tertiary academic\nreferral center. Data were retrieved from\nthe original medical record, including basic\npatient information, clinical manifestation,\nstructured operation notes and standardized\nfundus drawings. All operations were\nperformed by the same surgeon (G.Y.)\nwith the Alcon Accurus 800 (Alcon, USA).\nBriefly, a standard three-port vitrectomy\nwas performed under retrobulbar or\ngeneral anesthesia, depending on the indi-\nvidual preference of the surgeon. In the\ncombined procedures, we started with\nphacoemulsification of the lens and implant-\nation of an intraocular lens. During vitrec-\ntomy, meticulous shaving of the vitreous\nbase was done under a wide-angle viewing\nsystem with assisted scleral indentation.\nFibrovascular tissue and tractional mem-\nbrane were removed using a combination of\nsegmentation and delamination, primarily\nwith an intraocular scissor or a microvitrec-\ntor tip. Hemostasis was maintained by\nraising intraocular pressure or by using\nendodiathermy. For the retinal vein occlu-\nsion eyes, laser photocoagulation was per-\nformed. All tears were treated with laser\nphotocoagulation or external cryotherapy.\nAt the end of the surgery, balanced salt\nsolution, air, C2F6/C3F8 gas or silicone oil\nwas adopted as an intraocular tamponade\nagent.\nPostoperatively, patients were observed\nevery day for the first week, weekly for 4\nweeks and monthly thereafter. VA and\ncomplications were recorded during the\nfollow-up. Statistical analysis was per-\nformed using SPSS software (version 16;\nSPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). VA before\nand after surgery was compared using the\nWilcoxon signed-rank test. P < 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nidentified. The mean age of the patients\nThere was no sex bias (58 female vs. 47 male)\nor eye bias (57 left eyes vs. 48 right eyes). The\nmost common etiologies of dense vitreous\nhemorrhage with non-traumatic and non-\ndiabetic retinopathy were retinal vein occlu-\nsion (RVO)(61 eyes), retinal tear (24 eyes)\nand retinal vasculitis (11 eyes). Other etiol-\nogies included polypoidal choroidal vascu-\nlopathy (6 eyes) and retinal macroaneurysm\n(3 eyes). The mean age of the patients with\nRVO, retinal tear and retinal vasculitis was\nthe mean age of the patients with polypoidal\nchoroidal vasculopathy and retinal macro-\naneurysm was 67.5 years for both. Among\nthe eyes with RVO, branch retinal vein\nocclusion (BRVO) ranked first, with super-\nior temporal BRVO the predominant type\n(Table 1).\nDuring surgery, 47 eyes with RVO were\nfound to have neovascular membrane\n(NVM). Of these, 33 eyes with BRVO, 2\neyes with central retinal vein occlusion\n(CRVO) and 4 eyes with hemi CRVO were\nfound to have retinal NVM. Moreover, 2\neyes with CRVO had disk NVM and 6 eyes\nwith BRVO had both retinal and disk NVM.\nAdditionally, retinal NVM was also detected\nin 8 eyes with retinal vasculitis. The results\ndemonstrated that most of the dense vitreous\nhemorrhage eyes with RVO (77.0%) and\nretinal vasculitis (72.7%) presented with ret-\ninal and/or disk NVM (Table 2).\nIn the vitreous hemorrhage eyes, B-scan\nultrasound may discover a posterior vitre-\nous detachment, retinal tear or retinal\ndetachment and provide important\nTable 1.

In\nthe present study, preoperative B-scan ultra-\nsound revealed dense vitreous opacity in all\neyes, retinal tear in 5 eyes and retinal\ndetachment in 26 eyes. Intraoperatively,\nretinal tear was found in 24 eyes and retinal\ndetachment was confirmed in 48 eyes.\nB-scan ultrasound identified a retinal tear\nor detachment in eyes with dense vitreous\nrespectively.\nApart from determining the etiology of\ndense vitreous hemorrhage, another area of\nconcern for the clinician is VA. In the present\nstudy, VA was recorded preoperatively and\npostoperatively. There was improvement in\nand the median postoperative VA was 0.6\n(logMAR:0.22).Theimprovementislargeand\nDuring the mean follow-up period of 14.5\nmonths (range, 6 months to 2 years), 20 of\nthe 70 phakic eyes developed cataract.\nElevated intraocular pressure (over\nwhich nine were controlled by medication\nand one eye with CRVO developed neovas-\ncular glaucoma. Among all the cases, three\neyes had to be reoperated for a macular\npucker after 3 months and four eyes devel-\noped an inferior rhegmatogenous retinal\ndetachment at 2\u00ad3 months after surgery,\nwhich was repaired by repeat vitrectomy.\nRecurrences of vitreous hemorrhage were\nnoted in one eye with polypoidal choroidal\nvasculopathy and one eye with retinal arter-\nial macroaneurysm at one month after sur-\ngery, with both eyes achieving stability after\na second vitrectomy.\nDiscussion\nMany clinicians favor a conservative strat-\negy for the management of vitreous hemor-\nrhage as vitrectomy is an invasive procedure\nwith well-known risks, including cataract,\nglaucoma, retinal tear or retinal detachment.\nHowever, conservative treatment for a long-\nstanding dense vitreous hemorrhage may\ncause marked visual disability due to the\ntoxic effect of the hemorrhage on the retina\nand the formation of epiretinal membranes.\nAs surgery or conservative treatment has its\nadvantages and disadvantages, treatment of\ndense vitreous hemorrhage poses a dilemma\nto the ophthalmologist. The present study\nwas designed to investigate the etiology of\ndense vitreous hemorrhage with non-trau-\nmatic and non-diabetic retinopathy and\ndetermine the prognosis of early vitrectomy\nfor these patients.\nPreoperatively, all the patients underwent\na B-scan ultrasound to look for the presence\nof a posterior vitreous detachment, retinal\ntear or retinal detachment. B-scan ultra-\nsound is a well-established method for\nevaluating vitreo-retinal anatomy in the\npresence of vitreous hemorrhage. Its use in\ndetecting large retinal tears is well docu-\nmented but in patients with small, multiple\ntears or dense vitreous hemorrhage, its use is\nlimited.9 In this series, B-scan ultrasound\ndetected a preoperative retinal tear or retinal\nrespectively. Although dense vitreous hem-\norrhage may interfere with the accuracy of\nthe examination, B-scan ultrasound can still\nprovide important information to surgeons\nTable 2.

Our findings illu-\nstrated the most common etiologies for\nthese patients were RVO, retinal tear and\nretinal vasculitis.\nFor dense vitreous hemorrhage asso-\nciated with a retinal tear or rhegmatogenous\nretinal detachment, early surgery is recom-\nmended as there is a higher incidence of\nvitreoretinopathy and more likelihood of a\npoorer visual outcome.10 For eyes with\ndense vitreous hemorrhage, in which a ret-\ninal tear cannot be ruled out, early surgery is\nalso advocated. A previous study demon-\nstrated that 67% of dense vitreous hemor-\nrhage eyes appeared to have retinal tears and\neven 39% had retinal detachment in a\nconservative and prospective follow-up,\ntherefore delayed management can be asso-\nciated with an adverse visual outcome for\nAlong with retinal tears, we documented\nother etiologies that were associated with\ndense vitreous hemorrhage in the present\nstudy, including RVO, retinal vasculitis,\npolypoidal choroidal vasculopathy and ret-\ninal macroaneurysm. All these etiologies can\nbe attributed to an ocular vasculopathy. For\ndense vitreous hemorrhage caused by a\nretinal vasculopathy, the hypoxic retinal\ntissue may produce vascular endothelial\ngrowth factors (VEGF) and release inflam-\nmatory mediators, thereby inducing the\ncomplications of macular pucker, tractional\nretinal detachment and neovascular glau-\ncoma.13\u00ad16 There are several benefits to\nperforming early vitrectomy for vitreous\nhemorrhage secondary to the retinal vascu-\nlopathy, including RVO and retinal vascu-\nlitis. First, vitrectomy removes the opaque\nvitreous hemorrhage and clears the visual\naxis, which can improve vision. Second,\nvitrectomy reduces the expression of\nVEGF, which is a vital factor in neovascu-\nlarization. When vitrectomy is combined\nwith anti-VEGF agents or laser photo-\ncoagulation, it may improve the prognosis\nThird, thorough evaluation and treatment\nof eyes with NVM may reduce complica-\ntions that cause a decrease in vision, such as\ntractional retinal detachment and macula-\noff retinal detachment.22\nBased on the results of this study, we\nrecommend an early vitrectomy for dense\nvitreous hemorrhage with non-traumatic\nand non-diabetic retinopathy. Early vitrec-\ntomy can remove the opaque vitreous, clear\nthe visual axis and restore vision. However,\ntaking a more aggressive approach might\nimpose risks on individuals who could have\nhad a good outcome with conservative\ntreatment. Although the outcome for VA\nTable 3.
