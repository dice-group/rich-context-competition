Subjects were classified using a modification of the Global Ini-\ntiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\ninto the following mutually exclusive categories using the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV\n),\nforced vital capacity (FVC), FEV\n/FVC ratio, and the presence of respiratory symptoms: severe COPD,\nmoderate COPD, mild COPD, respiratory symptoms only, restrictive lung disease, and no lung disease.\nProportional hazard models were developed that controlled for age, race, sex, education, smoking sta-\ntus, pack years of smoking, years since quitting smoking, and body mass index.\nResults: A total of 1301 deaths occurred in the 5542 adults in the cohort. In the adjusted proportional\nhazards model the presence of severe or moderate COPD was associated with a higher risk of death\nConclusions: The presence of both obstructive and restrictive lung disease is a significant predictor of\nearlier death in long term follow up.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an\nimportant cause of morbidity and mortality in the\nUnited States.1 The diagnosis of obstructive lung disease\nhas traditionally depended on the presence of symptoms such\nas chronic cough or chronic sputum production.2 New\ninternational guidelines for the diagnosis of obstructive lung\ndisease depend almost exclusively on measured lung function\nto diagnose and classify disease.3 Lung function is not\nroutinely measured in most patients, and a significant\nproportion of the population with abnormal lung function has\nno diagnosed lung disease.4\nImpaired lung function has previously been shown to\npredict mortality, although most previous studies have not\nused clinical criteria to classify COPD, and none to our knowl-\nedge have looked at the effect of restrictive lung disease on\nWe applied spirometric criteria for the diagnosis of obstruc-\ntive and restrictive lung disease to a cohort of 5542 subjects in\nwhom pulmonary function measurements had been per-\nformed as part of the First National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES I). We searched the NHANES\nI follow up database for death in the follow up period of up to\n22 years and determined the significant predictors of death in\nthis cohort.\nMETHODS\nThe National Center for Health Statistics conducted NHANES\nof the civilian non-institutionalised population of the United\nStates.12 13 Follow up surveys of the adult participants (aged\nhospitalisation records, vital status, and death certificates (for\nhad been successfully traced and death certificates were avail-\nQuestionnaire data\nParticipants in NHANES I completed an extensive question-\nnaire that included age, race, sex, and education level. Partici-\npants were classified as having <12 years or >13 years of\neducation. A nationally representative subset of participants\ncompleted a cardiorespiratory module that included a series of\nquestions about the presence of respiratory symptoms and the\ndiagnosis of respiratory disease. Pulmonary symptoms in-\ncluded in the analysis (used to define an asymptomatic subset\nof the population to calculate equations for lung function and\ndefine a subset of the cohort with only respiratory symptoms)\nwere cough (defined as a positive response to \"Have you ever\nhad a cough first thing in the morning in the winter?\" or\n\"Have you ever had a cough first thing in the morning in the\nsummer?\"), sputum, (defined as a positive response to \"Have\nyou ever had any phlegm from your chest first thing in the\nmorning in the winter?\" or \"Have you ever had any phlegm\nfrom your chest first thing in the morning in the summer?\"),\nand wheeze (defined as a positive response to \"Have you ever\nhad wheezy or whistling sounds in your chest?\"). Participants\nwere also asked whether they had physician diagnosed\nchronic bronchitis (non-allergic), emphysema, or asthma.\nComplete smoking histories were obtained for all partici-\npants. Current smokers were defined as those who reported\nthe use of cigarettes, cigars, or pipes at the time of the survey,\nand former smokers were those who reported any prior use of\ncigarettes (at least 100 cigarettes), cigars (at least 50), or pipes\n(at least three packages of tobacco), but no current use. Long\nterm \"intensity of use\" data were available only for cigarettes.\nPack-years of cigarette use were calculated by multiplying the\naverage number of cigarettes smoked daily by the number of\nyears smoked and dividing the product by 20.

The procedures used have been described\npreviously.13 Subjects were excluded from the analysis if they\neither did not perform spirometric tests or had results that\nwere not reliable. Data were included from subjects who did\nnot have \"reproducible\" measures (to be reproducible the FEV\nand FVC from two reliable measurements had to be within 5%\nfor most subjects).18 Values used in the analysis included FVC,\nFEV\n, and the FEV\n/FVC ratio. Predicted values of FEV\nand\nFVC were determined by performing linear regression (strati-\nfied by sex and by using age and height as predictors) on a\nsubgroup of participants who were white never smokers who\ndid not report respiratory symptoms or physician diagnosed\nlung disease. The results from these regression models (men:\nFEV\nwomen: FEV\n0.451) were applied to the data from all participants to obtain\npredicted values of FEV\nand FVC. An adjustment factor of\n0.88 was used to estimate predicted values for black\nparticipants.19 Using a modification of the Global Initiative for\nChronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria for COPD,\nparticipants were classified into the following mutually exclu-\nsive categories using FEV\n, FVC, the FEV\n/FVC ratio, and the\npresence of respiratory symptoms: severe COPD (FEV\n<50% predicted), moderate COPD (FEV\n>80%), symptoms only (presence\nof respiratory symptoms in the absence of any lung function\nabnormality), restrictive lung disease (FEV\n<80% predicted), and no lung disease.\nDeath\nDeath certificate data were collected on NHANES I partici-\npants who died during the follow up period up to 1992 and\nwere included in the NHANES I follow up database. We\nsearched this database for all deaths and for deaths where\nCOPD or related conditions (asthma, bronchiectasis; ICD-9\ncodes 490\u00ad496) were listed as either the underlying cause of\ndeath or as any cause of death.\nBody mass index\nWeight and height were measured at the examination.

The\nfollowing standard classifications were used: <18.5 kg/m2\nAnalysis\nOur primary outcome of interest was death, and the main\npredictor of interest in our analysis was baseline lung\nfunction. Analyses were performed using the statistical pack-\nages SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), SUDAAN (RTI,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC, USA) and SPSS (SPSS Inc,\nChicago, IL, USA). The results were similar in analyses\nperformed both with and without the NHANES I sampling\nweights and complex design incorporated. Only the un-\nweighted data are presented.\nCox proportional hazard regression models were developed\nusing the SUDAAN procedure SURVIVAL to account for differ-\nential follow up in NHANES I participants. Time of follow up\nwas used as the underlying time metric.For deaths,the exit date\nwas the date of death reported on the death certificate and, for\nsurvivors, the exit date was the date the participant was last\nknown to be alive. Plots of the log-log survival curves for each\ncovariate were used to show that the proportional hazards\nassumptions were met. Lung function category, age, sex, race,\nsmoking status, education level, body mass index, pulmonary\nfunction level, pack-years of cigarette smoking, and years since\nlast smoked were included in the regression models and the\nmodels were evaluated for interactions.\nRESULTS\nnationally representative NHANES I survey. From this sample,\n6913 (also nationally representative) participated in the cardio-\nrespiratory survey and examination. We excluded 1371\nsubjects who either did not have pulmonary function testing\ndone or had results which were not reliable, leaving 5542 in\nthe final cohort for analysis. Subjects excluded because of\nmissing or unreliable pulmonary function data were more\nincluded in the final cohort. During the follow up period,\ncohort analysed.\nThe demographic characteristics of the cohort at baseline\nare shown in table 1.

The prevalence\nof all classes of COPD and restrictive lung disease increased\nwith increasing age (table 1).\nThe median duration of follow up of the cohort was 17.9\nyears (interquartile range (IQR) 15.4\u00ad19.0). During the follow\nup period 1301 participants died. Subjects with severe COPD\nhad the highest death rate (70.7%) during the follow up\nperiod, although this proportion varied with smoking status\n(table 2). Of those with severe COPD at baseline who died\nduring follow up, 23.1% had COPD listed as the underlying\ncause of death and an additional 24.6% had COPD listed as a\ncontributing cause of death (table 2, all subjects).\nIn the univariate proportional hazards model, all lung func-\ntion impairment classifications--together with age, race, sex,\neducation level, and smoking--were associated with an\nincreased risk of death (table 3, fig 1). The number available\nfor follow up at each time interval is shown in table 4. In the\nmultivariate model severe COPD, moderate COPD, mild COPD,\nand restrictive lung disease were all associated with an\nincreased risk of death (table 3). Adjustment for covariates\ndiminished the effect of lung function impairment on\nmortality--for example, the hazards ratio for severe COPD\nTable 3 Proportional hazards model for death among all subjects in univariate and\nmultivariate models\nUnivariate models Multivariate model*\nHazards\nHazards\nLung function\nAge\nRace\nSex\nEducation\nSmoking status\nPack years\nYears since regularly smoked\nBody mass index (kg/m2)\n*Models adjusted for lung function category, age, race, sex, education, smoking status, pack years of\nsmoking, years since regularly smoked, and body mass index.\n**Severe COPD = forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV\n)/forced vital capacity (FVC) <0.70 and FEV\n<50% predicted; moderate COPD=FEV\n>80%; symptoms only=presence of respiratory symptoms in the absence\nof any lung function abnormality; restrictive lung disease=FEV\nFrom the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1971\u00ad5 and follow up to 1992.\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier curve for death among 5542 participants\nstratified by degree of lung function impairment (number available\nfor follow up at each time interval is shown in table 4).

Fewer than half of\nthose who had moderate or severe COPD at baseline and died\nhad a diagnosis of COPD listed anywhere on their death\ncertificate.\nOne difference between this and previous studies of the\nrelation between lung function and mortality is the use of\nGOLD criteria to define baseline lung function. Previous stud-\nies have used quintiles or tertiles of FEV\ncontinuous FEV\nof >50% as the referent group.7\nMost other studies which used only FEV\nto categorise\nsubjects may include both subjects with restrictive disease and\nthose with obstructive disease.11 23 Prior analyses of the\nNHANES I data, which included deaths up to 1987, only used\nFEV\nto classify lung disease,6 24 although one did incorporate\ntransfer factor (which was available on a subset of the\ndatabase) into the analysis.6\nAn interesting finding in our analysis was that, in never\nsmokers, moderate or severe COPD did not have a significantly\nincreased mortality risk. This is consistent with previous find-\nings that obstructive lung function impairment related\nprimarily to asthma is less lethal than that related to emphy-\nsema or chronic bronchitis.21 Conversely, never smokers with\nrestrictive lung disease had an increased mortality hazard\nsimilar to that seen in current and former smokers. Former\nsmokers with either severe or moderate COPD had a mortality\nrisk similar to that seen in current smokers. This could be\nrelated to the observation that some former smokers may\ncontinue to lose lung function at an accelerated rate.25\nTable 4 Number available for follow up at each time interval\nTable 5 Proportional hazards model for death among subjects stratified by smoking\nstatus in univariate and multivariate models\nUnivariate models Multivariate model*\nHazards\nHazards\nCurrent smokers\nFormer smokers\nNever smokers\n*Models adjusted for lung function category, age, race, sex, education, smoking status, pack years of\nsmoking, years since regularly smoked, and body mass index.\n**Severe COPD = forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV\n)/forced vital capacity (FVC) <0.70 and FEV\n<50% predicted; moderate COPD=FEV\n>80%; symptoms only=presence of respiratory symptoms in the absence\nof any lung function abnormality; restrictive lung disease=FEV\nFrom the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1971\u00ad5 and follow up to 1992.\n392 Mannino, Buist, Petty, et al\nwww.thoraxjnl.com\ngroup.bmj.com\nthorax.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nThe precise mechanisms by which lung disease causes early\nnon-respiratory mortality are unknown, but may be related to\nchronic muscle wasting, autonomic dysfunction, systemic\ninflammation, oxidative stress, or other factors.26\u00ad31 Another\npossibility is that mechanisms leading to reduced pulmonary\nfunction may cause death from other causes, but there may be\nAs was shown in a smaller study in Tucson, Arizona,32 our\nanalyses suggest that COPD is under-reported on death\ncertificates. This could be due to one of several factors: (1) the\ndeceased may never have been diagnosed with COPD, (2) the\ndeceased may have been diagnosed with COPD but the person\ncertifying the death did not feel this was a factor in the death,\nor (3) the death certificate may have been completed by a per-\nson unfamiliar with the medical history of the deceased\nThis analysis has certain limitations. Lung function was\nonly obtained at the baseline examination so we could not\ndetermine the effect of lung function decline on mortality.22 23\nSmoking status, which is an important predictor of mortality,\nwas not independently validated with biomarkers. Diagnosed\nlung disease and respiratory symptoms were all self-reported\nand not independently validated. Data on total lung capacity,\nwhich are needed for the strict definition of restrictive lung\ndisease,34 were not available so it is possible that some subjects\nclassified as restrictive had other pathology or normal lung\nvolumes.35 Finally, 15.5% of subjects had non-reproducible\nspirometric parameters, with this proportion being much\nhigher among subjects with lung disease. The net effect of\nthese final two biases would classify people with normal lung\nfunction as having restrictive or obstructive lung disease and\nwould probably underestimate the effect of restrictive or\nobstructive lung disease on mortality.\nIn conclusion, both obstructive and restrictive pulmonary\nimpairment are associated with an increased risk of mortality\nduring follow up. This finding may be clinically important,\nparticularly with regard to restrictive lung disease which can\nhave several different aetiologies and requires clinical evalua-\ntion. Increased use of spirometric testing in the periodic adult\nhealth screen, which is being promoted by the National Lung\nHealth Education Program,36 would probably increase the\nearly detection of both restrictive and obstructive lung\ndiseases.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAuthors' affiliations\nD M Mannino, S C Redd, Air Pollution and Respiratory Health Branch,\nDivision of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects, National Center\nfor Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nAtlanta, GA, USA\nA S Buist, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR, USA\nT L Petty, Health One, Denver, CO, USA\nP L Enright, University of Arizona, Tuscon, AZ, USA\nREFERENCES\n1 Mannino DM, Homa DM, Akinbami L, et al.
