    "reduced_content": "OBJECTIVE -- To describe the extent of adoption of diabetes care management processes in\nphysician organizations in the U.S. and to investigate the organizational factors that affect the\nadoption of diabetes care management processes.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Data are derived from the National Survey of\nPhysician Organizations and the Management of Chronic Illness, conducted in 2000\u00ad2001. A\ntotal of 1,104 of the 1,590 physician organizations identified responded to the survey. The extent\nof adoption of four diabetes care management processes is measured by an index consisting of\nthe organization's use of diabetic patient registries, clinical practice guidelines, case manage-\nment, and physician feedback. The ordinary least-squares model is used to determine the\nassociation of organizational characteristics with the adoption of diabetes care management\nprocesses in physician organizations. A logistic regression model is used to determine the asso-\nciation of organizational characteristics with the adoption of individual diabetes care manage-\nment processes.\nRESULTS -- Of the 987 physician organizations studied that treat patients with diabetes, 48%\neither do not use any or use only one of the four diabetes care management processes. A total of\n20% use two care management processes, and 32% use three or four processes. External incen-\ntives to improve quality, computerized clinical information systems, and ownership by hospitals\nor health maintenance organizations are strongly associated with the diabetes care management\nindex and the adoption of individual diabetes care management processes.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Policies to encourage external incentives to improve quality and to\nfacilitate the adoption of computerized clinical information technology may promote greater use\nof diabetes care management processes.\nAlarge body of evidence suggests\nthat diabetes is inadequately man-\nrandomly sampled survey of 488 adults\nwith diabetes living in 12 metropolitan\nareas in the U.S., followed by a review of\nmany of their medical charts, only 45% of\nrecommended processes of diabetes care\nwere delivered. Only 24% of adults with\ndiabetes underwent three or more HbA1c\ntests over a 2-year period (1).\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) show that 37% of patients\nwith diabetes achieved the target goal of\nlevels 8.0%, percentages that did not\nchange significantly from a similar 1988\u00ad\npatients with diabetes had normal blood\n40% had elevated blood pressure\nmg/dl. Only 7% of adults with diabetes in\n, blood pressure, and total cho-\nlesterol (2).\nThe locus of actual care delivery for\nmuch of diabetes management is the phy-\nsician organization. No large-scale sur-\nveys have previously been conducted to\ndetermine the extent to which physician\norganizations have adopted innovations\nknown to improve the care of diabetes. It\nis also not known which organizational\nand market characteristics are associated\nwith implementation of diabetes care im-\nprovements. This study presents data\nfrom the first major physician organiza-\ntion survey ever conducted in the U.S. to\naddress these two questions. The Na-\ntional Study of Physician Organizations\nand the Management of Chronic Illness\n(NSPO) was a national telephone survey\nof medical groups and independent prac-\ntice associations (IPAs) with 20 or more\nphysicians (3). The NSPO collected data\nthat can determine the prevalence of dia-\nbetes care improvements and can explore\nwhich characteristics of physician organi-\nzations associate with their greater adop-\ntion. To address deficiencies in the\nmanagement of diabetes and other\nchronic conditions, Wagner et al. (4) de-\nveloped the Chronic Care Model (5,6).\nThe Chronic Care Model includes six\ncomponents, two (health care organiza-\ntion and community resources) that in-\n                                                \nFrom the 1School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California; 2Family and\nCommunity Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California; and the 3Depart-\nment of Health Studies, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.\nE-mail: rli@uclink.berkeley.edu.\nAbbreviations: CMP, care management process; HEDIS, Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set;\nHMO, health maintenance organization; IOM, Institute of Medicine; IPA, independent practice association;\nIT, information technology; NSPO, National Study of Physician Organizations and the Management of\nChronic Illness.\nA table elsewhere in this issue shows conventional and Syste\n`me International (SI) units and conversion\nfactors for many substances.\n\u00a9 2004 by the American Diabetes Association.\nE p i d e m i o l o g y / H e a l t h S e r v i c e s / P s y c h o s o c i a l R e s e a r c h\nvolve the larger health care system\nsurrounding the physician organization\nand four internal components (decision\nsupport, delivery system redesign, clini-\ncal information systems, and self-\nmanagement support) that take place\nwithin the physician organization.\nThe NSPO gathered data from physi-\ncian organizations on four care manage-\nment processes (CMPs) derived from the\ninternal Chronic Care Model compo-\nnents. These four CMPs are 1) use of clin-\nical practice guidelines in conjunction\nwith physician reminder systems (deci-\nsion support and clinical information sys-\ntems), 2) case management (delivery\nsystem redesign), 3) performance feed-\nback to individual physicians (clinical in-\nformation systems), and 4) disease\nregistries (clinical information systems).\nThese four CMPs were chosen because a\nnumber of studies have demonstrated\nthat they improve clinical outcomes for\npatients with diabetes. A meta-analysis\nand a Cochrane review found that re-\nminder systems (placing practice guide-\nlines at the point of care) improved\ndiabetes control (7,8). Compared with\ncontrol subjects, those undergoing case\nmanagement, in planned nurse-run dia-\nbetes clinics or by telephone, had im-\nproved glycemic control in several studies\n(9\u00ad12). Pooled data from three studies\nshowed that performance feedback to\nphysicians was associated with a slight\nimprovement in diabetes control (8). Di-\nabetes registries, if used to bring patients\nat risk into care, have been shown in a\nMayo Clinic study to reduce HbA1c\nlevels\ncompared with control groups (13). Par-\nticularly for diabetes, the introduction of\nseveral of these care management inter-\nventions is more effective than the use of\nvey asked physician organizations about\ntheir use of patient self-management pro-\ngrams (3), but not in specific relation to\ndiabetes; therefore, data about this CMP\nare not reported here.\nMETHODS -- The NSPO was con-\ndefined as an organization composed of\nphysicians belonging to one practice, op-\nerating in either one office or at many lo-\ncations. An IPA was defined as an\norganization through which physicians\ncontract with managed care plans and in\nwhich physicians work solo or in small\npractices that are independent of each\nother.\nA number of strategies were used to\nincrease the response rate, including\nmaking up to 25 phone calls to the phy-\nsician organization. In addition, informa-\ntion about support for the project from\nvarious professional groups and leaders\nwere faxed or mailed to certain groups.\nParticipants were paid $150 and sent a\nsummary feedback report to use for\nbenchmarking with other physician orga-\nnizations around the country.\nPopulation studied\nthe telephone survey. Information on\nnonrespondents is limited. Nonrespon-\ndents did not differ from respondents by\nsize or by state, but IPAs had a signifi-\ncantly higher response rate than medical\n117 organizations stating that they did\nnot treat patients with diabetes, leaving\n987 physician organizations included in\nour study. Among these were 645 medical\ngroups and 342 IPAs. The NSPO was de-\nsigned to measure the organizational\ncharacteristics and extent of adoption of\nCMPs for physician organizations with at\nleast 20 physicians. A number of ques-\ntions in the survey attempted to deter-\nmine the use of these CMPs for the care of\npatients with diabetes. Further informa-\ntion about the development, administra-\ntion, and content of the survey is available\nDependent variable\nTo assess physician organizations' use of\ndiabetes CMPs, the survey asked whether\nthe organization had implemented the\nfour diabetes CMPs discussed above: clin-\nical practice guidelines in conjunction\nwith physician reminder systems, case\nmanagement, performance feedback to\nindividual physicians, and disease regis-\ntries. All four diabetes CMPs are signifi-\ncantly correlated with each other (P \nagement index using these four diabetes\nCMPs to measure the extent of adoption\nof diabetes CMPs in each physician orga-\nnization. The index range is 0\u00ad4; an or-\nganization received one point for each of\nthe four CMPs adopted. The internal con-\nsistency reliability (Cronbach ) of the di-\nabetes care management index was 0.64.\nIndependent variables\nWe used four groups of independent vari-\nables: external incentives for a physician\norganization to improve quality, comput-\nerized clinical information technology in-\nfrastructure, relationship with health\nmaintenance organizations (HMOs), and\nownership of the physician organizations.\nTo assess external incentives, the sur-\nvey asked seven questions: whether the\nphysician organization received addi-\ntional income from health plans for scor-\ning well on quality measures; whether the\nphysician organization got public recog-\nnition for quality; whether it received bet-\nter contracts from health plans for quality;\nand whether physician organizations\nwere required to report Health Plan Em-\nployer Data and Information Set (HEDIS)\ndata, outcomes data, results of quality\nprojects, or patient satisfaction data to an\noutside organization. The first three of the\nexternal incentive questions were defined\nas categorical variables, coded as 1 or 0.\nFor the last four questions, we created a\ncomposite measure with the organization\nreceiving one point for each kind of re-\nporting to an outside organization. The\nrange of this composite measure is 0\u00ad4.\nAltogether, we had four independent\nvariables for the external incentives.\nClinical information technology was\nmeasured by a single clinical information\ntechnology (IT) index. The components\nof this index included whether the physi-\ncian organization had a computerized\nproblem list, physician progress notes, list\nof medications prescribed, medication or-\ndering reminders and/or drug interaction\ninformation, laboratory results, and radi-\nology results. We assigned one score for\neach of the six IT components; the result-\ning index measure ranges from 0 to 6.\nThe relationship of a physician orga-\nnization with HMOs was assessed by two\nmeasures: the percentage of revenue from\ncapitation and the percentage of risk del-\negation to the physician organization for\nhospital admission of HMO and point-of-\nservices patients.\nOwnership of physician organiza-\ntions was categorized as ownership by an\nHMO or hospital system, ownership by\nphysicians in the organization, or owner-\nship by nonphysician managers and\nothers.\nLi and Associates\nControl variables\nControl variables included the type of\nphysician organization (medical group or\nIPA), the practice type (primary care only,\nspecialty care only, or multispecialty\ngroup with both primary and specialty\ncare), organization age, size of the organi-\nzation, and the degree of HMO penetra-\ntion at the county level.\nModel specification\nWe used a multivariate ordinary least-\nsquares regression model to predict the\neffects of organizational characteristics on\nthe extent of adoption of diabetes CMP in\nphysician organizations. We also used a\nlogistic model to explore each of the four\nCMPs separately because the answers for\nadoption of individual diabetes CMPs are\ncategorical yes/no variables.\nRESULTS -- The descriptive statistics\non the extent of adoption of diabetes\nCMPs in physician organizations are re-\ngroups and IPAs surveyed that treat pa-\ntients with diabetes, the average score on\nthe diabetes care management index was\n1.7. In other words, physician organiza-\ntions on average used fewer than two of\nthe four components of the diabetes care\nmanagement index. A total of 26% of\nphysician organizations used none of the\nfour diabetes care management processes,\ntwo processes, 19% used three processes,\nand 13% used all four processes. Physi-\ncian performance feedback was the most\ncommonly reported CMP for diabetes,\nused by 48% of physician organizations,\nfollowed by 43% using diabetes case\nmanagers, 40% having a diabetes registry,\nand 39% using physician guidelines and\ntied to reminder systems (Table 2). Inter-\nestingly, the physician organizations that\nused more of the diabetes CMP also used\nmore CMP for congestive heart failure,\nasthma, and depression.\nTable 3 shows the results of the ordi-\nnary least-squares regression for factors\naffecting adoption of diabetes CMPs. All\nfour external incentives to improve qual-\nity are strongly associated with a physi-\ncian organization's use of diabetes CMPs.\nRequiring physician organizations to re-\nport HEDIS and other quality data to out-\nside organizations is strongly associated\nwith increasing the diabetes care manage-\nment index score. Reporting one addi-\ntional kind of quality data to an outside\norganization is associated with increasing\nthe diabetes care management index score\naverage diabetes care management index\ning all four kinds of quality data to an\noutside organization use 2.2 diabetes\nCMPs, whereas physician organizations\nthat did not report quality data to an out-\nside organization use only 1.5 diabetes\nCMPs on average. Compared with physi-\ncian organizations that did not receive the\nindicated incentive for quality, physician\norganizations that received outside in-\ncome for quality improvement use 0.20\nmore diabetes CMPs (12% increase from\nthe mean, P  0.05).

A one-point increase in the IT\nindex is associated with an increase of\nindex. That is, organizations that score 0\non the clinical IT index use only 1.5 dia-\nbetes CMPs, whereas an organization that\nscores 6 on the IT index uses 2.2 diabetes\nAmong the variables that assess the\nrelationship between physician organiza-\ntions and health plans, the percentage of\nrevenue from capitation has a very small\npositive influence of 0.002 on the diabe-\ntes care management index (P  0.05). In\nother words, a physician organization\nthat is fully capitated uses 0.3 more dia-\nbetes CMPs than a physician organization\nthat is reimbursed only on a fee-for-\nservice basis.

The results of the lo-\ngistic regressions of use of individual\ndiabetes CMPs are similar to the results\nfor the overall diabetes care management\nindex and are not presented.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Our study is the\nfirst to provide national data on the use of\ndiabetes CMPs among physician organi-\nzations. Our results demonstrate that ex-\nternal incentives for quality, clinical IT\ncapability, and group ownership by an\nHMO or hospital system are associated\nwith increased use of diabetes CMPs.\nOn average, physician organizations\nhave adopted fewer than two of the four\ncomponents of the diabetes care manage-\nment index. More than 25% of the physi-\ncian organizations studied that treat\npatients with diabetes do not use any di-\nabetes CMPs at all, and an additional 22%\nuse only one of these CMPs. This is un-\nfortunate, because the CMPs have been\nshown, in most studies, to be associated\nwith improved diabetes outcomes (7\u00ad\n13,15). These findings are consistent with\nthe conclusion of the report Crossing the\nQuality Chasm by the Institute of Medi-\ncine (IOM) (17), in that the gap between\nscientific knowledge and routine practice\nin diabetes treatment remains large. The\nIOM report also argued that low quality is\nprimarily the result of a failure at the or-\nganizational level rather than that of indi-\nvidual physicians. The IOM proposed the\nimplementation of organizational pro-\ncesses for quality and emphasized the im-\nportance of providing physician\norganizations with incentives for quality-\nenhancing processes.\nOur regression results support the\nconclusions of the IOM report. They dem-\nonstrate that incentives for physician\norganizations to improve quality are asso-\nciated with greater adoption of diabetes\nCMPs. Physician organizations being re-\nquired to report on quality to outside or-\nganizations, receiving income, gaining\npublic recognition for high quality care, or\ngetting better contracts for quality are\nmore likely to adopt diabetes CMPs.\n14% increases, respectively, in the use of\ndiabetes CMPs in physician organiza-\ntions.\nOur findings also support the role\nplayed by clinical IT infrastructure. IT fa-\ncilitates better chronic illness care by giv-\ning physicians access to patient\ninformation, enabling identification of at-\nrisk populations, and providing decision\nsupport at the point of care. Without IT\ninfrastructure, it is difficult to generate a\nregistry of diabetic patients and to provide\ntools for patient tracking and follow-up.\nDespite these benefits, few physician orga-\nTable 3--Ordinary least-squares regression results for organizational factors that affect the\nadoption of overall diabetes CMPs in physician organizations\nRegression\ncoefficient\nStandardized\nregression\ncoefficient\nExternal incentives for quality\nRelationship with HMOs\nPercentage of HMO and point-of-service patients\nfor whom hospital utilization management\nis delegated to the group\nOwnership (comparison group is physician-owned groups)\nControl variables\n\u00b7Specialty type (comparison group is multispecialty\ngroups)\nLi and Associates\nnizations studied had robust IT capabili-\nties. Using an IT index with a range from\n0 to 6, the mean IT index score for physi-\ncian organizations surveyed is only 1.33.\nResources and tools to create greater IT\ninfrastructure in physician organizations\nmay stimulate increased adoption of dia-\nbetes CMPs.\nWe also found that physician organi-\nzations owned by HMOs or hospital sys-\ntems used more diabetes CMPs than\nphysician-owned physician organiza-\ntions. This result may be explained by the\nfact that HMO- and hospital-owned phy-\nsician organizations have more resources\navailable to implement CMPs.\nOur study has several limitations.\nFirst, the study relied on physician orga-\nnization leaders (almost always the med-\nical directors or president) to report on\nthe adoption of diabetes CMPs. There\nmay have been a tendency to overreport\nthe adoption of CMPs, in which case the\nactual extent of use of these CMPs may be\nlower than what we have reported. Sec-\nond, we asked organizations yes/no ques-\ntions regarding use of a particular CMP.\nWe have no information on how many\npatients are affected by a CMP, or the clin-\nical outcomes associated with the use of\nthat process. Third, the cross-sectional\nnature of the data leads to an inability to\ndraw conclusions about cause and effect.\nFor example, if a physician organization\ncould get better contracts for quality, it\nmay be more likely to implement CMPs in\nthe organization. On the other hand, it is\nalso likely that a physician organization\nthat has implemented CMPs is more likely\nto obtain better contracts that include in-\ncentive bonuses for quality. A fourth lim-\nitation is that the NSPO only surveyed\norganizations of 20 or more physicians.\nWe have no information on organizations\nwith fewer than 20 physicians.\nCMPs--the institution of physician\nreminder systems based on clinical prac-\ntice guidelines, case management, perfor-\nmance feedback to individual physicians,\nand use of disease registries--have been\nassociated with improved glycemic con-\ntrol in patients with diabetes.\nThe survey reported here demon-\nstrates that few medium- and large-sized\nphysician organizations have adopted all\nthese processes and that 48% of these\nphysician organizations have instituted\nnone or only one of these processes. This\nstudy identifies some factors that seem to\nincrease the likelihood of physician orga-\nnizations adopting CMPs for diabetes.\nSome of these factors are external quality\nreporting, additional payment for better\nquality, sophisticated clinical information\nsystems, organizational size, and owner-\nship of the physician organization by an\nHMO or hospital system. Policies and\npractices that promote these characteris-\ntics may help spread improvement in di-\nabetes care.\n"
