    "reduced_content": "Of the almost 1 million annually diagnosed cases of pelvic in-\nflammatory disease (PID), 20% occur among adolescents.1 Be-\ncause reproductive health concerns are the most common rea-\nsons for emergency department (ED) visits among adolescent\ngirls, it is critical that ED providers are knowledgeable about\nthe diagnosis and treatment of PID. The objective of this study\nwas to evaluate adherence to the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC) PID treatment guidelines among a na-\ntionally representative sample of adolescent ED PID visits.\nMethods | This study was considered exempt from formal re-\nview by our institutional review board. We conducted a retro-\nspective cross-sectional analysis of the National Hospital Am-\nHospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey is an annual, na-\ntional probability sample survey of hospital EDs conducted by\ntheNationalCenterforHealthStatisticsbranchoftheCDC.2 The\neligible study population included all sampled ED visits by fe-\nthe diagnosis of PID captured by International Classification of\nDiseases, Ninth Revision codes. Our outcome measure was ad-\nherence to CDC recommended PID treatment guidelines by\nevaluating whether patients were prescribed antibiotics that\nwere considered first- or second-line treatment for PID for the\nrespective year based on the published CDC sexually transmit-\nted disease treatment guidelines for PID management.3 Given\nthattheCDCtreatmentguidelineschangedin2006,wealsocal-\nculatedtheaverageproportionofappropriatelytreatedPIDcases\nbefore and after the 2006 CDC treatment guideline change. We\nused descriptive statistics and logistic regression with appro-\npriate weighting to account for the complex survey methods to\ncalculate all estimates and perform all analyses.\nResults | During the study period, there were an estimated\ntibiotics that adhered to the CDC recommended treatment\nPID cases received appropriate antibiotic therapy. This in-\nchange (P = .01). The most common antibiotic regimen found\namong inappropriately treated patients was the combination\nof ceftriaxone sodium and azithromycin (17.1%).\nDiscussion | To our knowledge, this analysis represents the first\npopulation-based assessment of recent compliance with CDC\nrecommended treatment guidelines for adolescent ED pa-\ntients diagnosed with PID. Only 37% of PID cases were treated\naccording to the CDC treatment guidelines in our study. Fur-\nthermore, the common use of a third-generation cephalo-\nsporin and azithromycin suggests that clinicians may errone-\nously believe that PID treatment is identical to cervicitis\ntreatment and/or that patients are incapable of adherence to\ndoxycycline. This finding has substantial implications be-\ncause inadequate treatment of PID may lead to serious long-\nterm sequelae such as chronic pelvic pain or tubal infertility.\nAdditionally, the lack of adherence to the CDC guidelines sug-\ngests a need to further study strategies for optimal diffusion\nand acceptance of the CDC guidelines.\nOur finding of low adherence to the CDC treatment guide-\nlines is consistent with those of other single-center studies and\nstudies of adult populations.4-6 However, to our knowledge,\nour study is the first to evaluate whether treatment adher-\nence had changed since the dissemination of the CDC 2006\nsexually transmitted disease treatment guidelines. Even with\nthe sizeable increase in the percentage of patients who were\ntreated appropriately from prior to 2006 to afterward, more\nthan 50% of patients are still not receiving treatment consis-\ntent with national guidelines. Furthermore, these nationally\nrepresentative data demonstrate the need and potential high\nimpact of using the ED as a strategic setting to further under-\nstand these issues and change clinical practice.\nMonika Goyal, MD\nAdam Hersh, MD, PhD\nXianqun Luan, MS\nRussell Localio, MS, PhD\nMaria Trent, MD, MPH\nTheoklis Zaoutis, MD, MSCE\nAuthor Affiliations: Children's National Medical Center, George Washington\nUniversity, Washington, DC (Goyal); Center for Clinical Epidemiology and\nBiostatistics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania,\nPhiladelphia (Goyal, Localio, Zaoutis); Leonard Davis Institute, University of\nPennsylvania, Philadelphia (Goyal); University of Utah, Salt Lake City (Hersh);\nChildren's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Luan, Localio,\nZaoutis); Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland (Trent).\nCorresponding Author: Dr Goyal, Children's National Medical Center, 111\nMichigan Ave NW, Washington, DC 20010 (mgoyal@cnmc.org).\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Goyal had full access to all the data in the study and\ntakes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data\nanalysis.\nStudy concept and design: Goyal, Hersh, Localio, Trent, and Zaoutis.\nAcquisition of data: Goyal and Luan.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Goyal, Hersh, Luan, Localio, Trent, and\nZaoutis.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Goyal, Luan, Localio, and Trent.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: Hersh, Luan,\nLocalio, Trent, and Zaoutis.\nStatistical analysis: Goyal, Luan, and Localio.\nObtained funding: Goyal.\nStudy supervision: Localio and Zaoutis.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nDownloaded From: http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

Preordering could preempt hunger-based,\nspontaneous selections and eliminate the sensory cues--\nevocative smells and sights--that lead to less healthy choices.\nWe examine whether having students preorder their entr\u00e9e\n(main dish) improves the healthfulness of entr\u00e9es selected for\nlunch.\nMethods | The Cornell University institutional review board ap-\nproved this study and waived written consent, yet teachers,\nstaff, school administrators, and parents were notified. In 2 el-\nementary schools in upstate New York, students use an elec-\ntronic system to preorder their lunch entr\u00e9e. The schools are\nlocated in a predominantly white (96.6%) county where 55%\nof students receive free or reduced-price lunches. Over a\nrooms (grades 1-5) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 condi-\ntions. In weeks 1 and 2, all classrooms preordered as usual. In\nweek 3, 4 classrooms discontinued preordering but resumed\npreordering in week 4. (Because this could lead to contami-\nnation of behavior in week 4, we omit these observations.) In\nweek 4, 5 classrooms discontinued preordering. Five class-\nrooms never stopped preordering.\nSales records, including school, grade, classroom, stu-\ndent identifiers, and daily entr\u00e9e choice, were collected for 272\nstudents. Entr\u00e9es with the greatest nutrient density on any\ngiven day were coded as healthy while others were coded as\nunhealthy. Data were analyzed with Stata 12 (StataCorp) using\na mixed-effects logistic model with students nested within\nclassroom.\nResults | When students preordered their entr\u00e9e, 29.4% se-\nlected the healthier entr\u00e9e compared with 15.3% when preor-\ndering was not available (Table). Conversely, the less healthy\nentr\u00e9e was chosen 70.8% of the time by students who preor-\ndered, and students who ordered in the lunch line selected the\nless healthy entr\u00e9e 85.7% of the time (Table). When students\ndid not order but instead selected their entr\u00e9e as they en-\ntered the lunch line, it appears that hunger-based, spontane-\nous selection diminished healthy entr\u00e9e selection by 48% and\nincreased less healthy entr\u00e9e selection by 21% (Table).\nConsumption data (not reported), which were collected in\nthe cafeterias via a visual estimation technique, support this\nrobust result and suggest preordering the entr\u00e9e also affects\nselection and consumption of side items. Together, both con-\nsumption and selection data demonstrate how a simple envi-\nronmental change--preordering--can prompt children to\nchoose healthier food.\nDiscussion | In a school setting, preordering can effectively lead\nstudents to pick healthier entr\u00e9es. Students who selected their\nentr\u00e9e in the lunch line, where decisions are biased by aro-\nmas and sights of tasty, less healthy foods, decreased selec-\ntion of healthy entr\u00e9es by 48% and increased selection of less\nhealthy entr\u00e9es by 21%. Though this research did not change\nthe layout of the lunch line, students precommitted to a lunch\nentr\u00e9e outside of the cafeteria, effectively modifying the de-\ncision environment. A smarter lunchroom is not confined to\nthe space within the cafeteria walls.\nWhereas this research used a computerized preordering\nsystem, paper-based systems are easy, inexpensive, and an im-\nmediately implementable alternative. The ease of implement-\ning these systems can allow future research to examine the ef-\nfectiveness of these systems on the selection of entr\u00e9es, side\nTable.

Dependent variables were\nhealthy entr\u00e9e and less healthy\nentr\u00e9e. Healthy and less healthy\nentr\u00e9es were determined using a\nnutrient-based method.\n \nDownloaded From: http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc. User on 11/20/2015"
