    "abstract": "Abstract\nThere is great emphasis recently on improving the quality of early childhood education in the United States. Within quality\nrating improvement systems, classroom quality is often reported at the center or program levels. Yet little is known about\nteaching quality at the center level or the influence of center characteristics on teaching quality. Specifically, this study\nexamines the extent to which the quality of emotional support provided by the teacher is associated with characteristics of\nthe center (e.g., prior turnover rates) and center director (e.g., education, management practices). Findings from Head Start\nFamily and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) 2009 data indicated that emotional support dimensions were differentially\npredicted by characteristics of the center and the director, including prior teacher turnover rate and director job satisfaction.\nHowever, highly regulated indicators of center quality (e.g., student:teacher ratio) did not substantially explain emotional\nsupport.\n",

For\nexample, the Race to the Top Early Learning Challenge and\nthe new Head Start performance standards have increased the\npressure for states and programs to use appropriate assess-\nments of classroom quality (National Research Council of the\nNational Academies, 2008). This is a well-founded focus\ngiven that an abundance of literature has established a link\nbetween classroom quality and children's outcomes (e.g.,\nBurchinal, Vandergrift, Pianta, & Mashburn, 2009; Curby et\nHealth and Human Development [NICHD] Early Child Care\nThe growing attention to the importance of quality has\nresulted in many states adopting quality rating improvement\nsystems (QRISs) intended to hold centers accountable to\nstandard definitions of quality. Levels of quality are typically\nconveyed to perspective parents and policy makers at the\ncenter level through indicators such as stars or medals (Tout\net al., 2010), which summarize a variety of ratings into a\nsingle, easily interpreted rating. In many states, including\nVirginia and Minnesota (Tout et al., 2010), these ratings\nincorporate measures of classroom quality for some or all\nclassrooms in a center (Zellman & Perlman, 2008). Due to\ncost considerations, classroom observations are often com-\npleted in only a subset of classrooms in a center. Particularly,\nwhen a small proportion of classrooms are observed in a\ncenter, this approach necessarily assumes that the selected\nclassrooms are a good representation of the center (Karoly,\nZellman, & Perlman, 2013). The purpose of this study is to\nquantify the degree to which one aspect of classroom quality,\nemotional support, is a center-level phenomenon and to\nbegin to unravel the influence of center and center director\ncharacteristics on classroom quality.\nClassroom Quality and Children's\nOutcomes\nChildren's experiences in early childhood classrooms can\nestablish a cycle of future social success or failure (Campbell\n& von Stauffenberg, 2008). In classrooms, the quality of\nteachers' interactions with children is one of the most salient\nfeatures children experience (Pianta, 1999). These interac-\ntions are often divided into three domains: emotional sup-\nport, classroom organization, and instructional support. In\nparticular, emotionally supportive interactions between chil-\ndren and the adults who care for them positively influence\n1University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA\n2George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nKatherine M.

Consequently, children\nin classrooms with more supportive teachers display more\nadaptive learning behaviors and better academic outcomes\n(Graziano, Reavis, Keane, & Calkins, 2007; Hamre & Pianta,\n2005; Rimm-Kaufman, Curby, Grimm, Nathanson, & Brock,\n2009), and lower rates of problem behaviors, negative affect,\nand aggression (Howes et al., 2008; NICHD Early Child\nCare Research Network, 2003; Zinsser, Bailey,\nCenter-Level Influences on Classroom\nQuality\nBeyond the individual classroom, a smaller body of research\nthe center level, which may contribute to quality teaching\nand children's achievement. Early childhood centers are\nmore than a series of contiguous classrooms, operating inde-\npendently with no effect on each other. Although center cli-\nmate may be a more distal influence than the classroom\n(Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006), center-level policies and\nthe center director affect classroom practice, which in turn\ncan affect child outcomes. In other words, children attending\nearly childhood programs are influenced not just by their\nteachers and close peers but also by the less immediate and\nindirect features of the early childhood environment, includ-\ning structural (teacher\u00adchild ratios), procedural (hiring deci-\nsions), and interpersonal features (employee job satisfaction)\nof the center in which the child's classroom operates.\nSalary, Education, Student\u00adTeacher Ratio\nSome of the most tangible aspects of early childhood center\nmanagement have to do with how staff members are paid,\ntheir levels of training, and the ratios of children to adults in\neach classroom. There is a great deal of variance in the\nannual salaries of administrators of early childhood educa-\ntion centers, with top earners receiving nearly US$60,000\nmore per year than the bottom 10% of center directors (U.S.\nBureau of Labor Statistics, 2014). Furthermore, director edu-\ncation has been found to be a predictor of overall program\nquality (McCormick Center for Early Childhood Leadership,\n2012), although the directionality of the association cannot\nbe assumed. Bloom describes center directors as \"gate-keep-\ngraduate-level training for center administrators, Bloom and\nothers have shown that more highly educated directors are\nbetter able to support high-quality teaching (Bloom &\ntors who completed the advanced certificate program\nreported greater perceived competence and decision-making\ninfluence, and higher commitment to their centers than direc-\ntors in a control group. Bloom and Sheerer also observed\nsignificant differences in teacher quality, as measured by the\nEarly Childhood Classroom Observation Scale, across the\ntraining and control groups, indicating that directors' educa-\ntion may have pronounced impacts on the quality of teach-\ners' interactions with children.\nRatios have long been considered a critical component of\nprogram quality (Howes, 1982), whereby smaller\nteacher:child ratios are considered indicators of higher qual-\nity. As such, child care centers are required to operate within\nacceptable ratio ranges as determined by state accrediting\nbodies and Head Start performance standards. Therefore\nratios may not statistically relate to measures of quality\nbecause of these restricted ranges. Mashburn et al. (2008)\nfound that there was a small positive correlation between\nratio and classroom emotional support at the classroom level.\nSupportive Management\nThere is a positive relationship between the quality of center\nmanagement practices and the quality of children's learning\nenvironments (Lower & Cassidy, 2007). Directors who are\nable to foster a sense of community for teachers may facili-\ntate positive attitudes toward teaching and help them be more\ncommitted to and satisfied with their jobs, all critical compo-\nnents of a high-quality education (McGinty, Justice, &\nUnsatisfied teachers are more likely to contemplate leav-\ning their position while more satisfied teachers feel more\ncommitted to the field of early childhood education (Saari &\nJudge, 2004). Turnover rates for preschool teachers have been\npreviously documented at 25% to 50% annually; compara-\ntively, public elementary school teacher turnover is about 7%\nannually (Barnett et al., 2010). The instability of the preschool\nteacher workforce has been attributed to a variety of condi-\ntions associated with early childhood education, such as iso-\nlationism, perceived lack of career reward, and lack of\npreparation (McGinty et al., 2008). Stress and low overall job\nsatisfaction especially contribute to teacher turnover\ndegrade teachers' abilities to be emotionally supportive\n(Jennings & Greenberg, 2009). Teachers who experience\nhigher levels of stress at work are less consistent in their emo-\ntional support and also tend to have students who display\ngreater negativity and aggression (Zinsser et al., 2013).\nTurnover can have a large effect on a center. High turnover\nrates year over year are likely to be an indicator of poor qual-\nity for a center. However, center directors may also counsel\nunderperforming teachers out, giving the director an opportu-\nnity to affect program quality by hiring new teachers (Zinsser,\n2013). Recently, turnover rates were additionally affected by\nchanges in Head Start policies. The Improving Head Start for\nSchool Readiness Act of 2007 stipulated timelines for new\nZinsser and Curby 3\nminimum education requirements for classroom teachers--\nby 2011 all classroom teachers needed a minimum of an asso-\nciate's degree and by 2013 half of all classroom teachers\nwithin a center were required to hold a bachelor's degree or\nhigher. Thus, centers employing a larger number of underedu-\ncated teachers likely have turned over a number of positions,\nhiring replacement teachers who meet the new requirements\nand may provide higher quality instruction.\nDirector Job Satisfaction and Management\nChallenges\nAlthough there is a large quantity of research on the impact\nof management styles on teachers' job satisfaction, to our\nknowledge school administrators' own job satisfaction has\nnot received the same attention. Our ecological view of early\nchildhood centers, where the quality of teachers' interactions\nwith children may in part be influenced by adult interper-\nsonal relationships in the center and broader organizational\nfactors, necessitates that we consider the director's commit-\nment to and satisfaction with his or her job as well. A frus-\ntrated or burned-out administrator may be less enthusiastic\nor engaged in the running of a center, may provide less sub-\nstantive feedback and professional development for teachers,\nand may be less persistent in ensuring that a program has\nsufficient resources to promote children's success and\nteacher well-being.\nTo some degree, directors' satisfaction with their jobs\nmay be related to the challenges they face, how they priori-\ntize responsibilities, and the decisions they make about how\nto handle those challenges. Despite all working under the\nsame performance standards, even administrators in Head\nStart show remarkably little agreement about the relative\nimportance of their various job responsibilities, such as\nmaintaining financial records and providing a positive envi-\nronment for teachers and students (Zinsser, Curby, & Ullrich,\nin press). Directors' decision-making styles are related to the\nquality of adult interpersonal relationships within the cen-\nter--team decision making increases staff motivation, dedi-\nFurthermore, administrators hold different opinions on the\nrelative importance of various instructional techniques, cur-\nricula, and professional development (Zinsser et al., in press),\nwhich may influence teachers' classroom practices and\nteacher\u00adchild relationships. This ecological view of early\nchildhood centers, where the quality of teachers' interactions\nwith children may in part be influenced by organizational fac-\ntors, necessitates program evaluation approaches that respect\nthe shared experience of teachers within centers.\nThe Present Study\nBronfenbrenner's bioecological systems model\n(Bronfebrenner & Morris, 2009) provides a natural platform\nfor the present investigation given that it nests the individual\nchild within concentric circles of proximal and distal influ-\nences. Attention to center-level influences on teacher quality\nis particularly important when implementing accountability\nefforts such as QRISs, which often sample teachers for\nobservation as an indicator of center quality. Although there\nhas been a great deal of research on classroom quality, analy-\nses typically only nest children within teachers, but not\nteachers in centers. Recent evidence suggests that variations\nin early childhood classroom quality ratings are attributable,\nto some extent, to the center in which a classroom is housed\n(Karoly et al., 2013), but the degree to which characteristics\nof the center or center director (e.g., salary, management\nstyle, commitment to the field, prioritization of social and\nemotional learning) may account for some of the center-level\nvariance is largely unknown. Thus, a basic, yet important\nline of inquiry focuses on the amount of variance in class-\nroom observations that is attributable to the center. If the\ncenter-level variance is low, then a large proportion of teach-\ners should be observed to produce a reliable and accurate\nestimate of a center's classroom quality.\nThe present study seeks to answer the following research\nquestions: (a) To what extent are ratings of classroom\nEmotional Support dimensions attributable to the centers?\n(b) Which characteristics of a center or its director best pre-\ndict aspects of teachers' emotional supportiveness? To\naddress these goals, the present study used a large-scale,\nnationally representative data set to estimate the amount of\ncenter-level variance in emotional support. Subsequently,\ncenter-level predictors were added to assess the degree to\nwhich classroom emotional support could be associated with\ncenter-level phenomena.\nMethod\nParticipants\nData come from the Head Start Family and Child Experiences\nSurvey (FACES) 2009 cohort (United States Department of\nHealth and Human Services, Administration for Children\nand Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation,\n2013), a nationally representative sample of Head Start pro-\ngrams, centers, classrooms, children, and their families. In\nthe FACES study, multistage clustered sampling was used to\nselect programs, centers, and classrooms with probability\nproportional to size. The full sample included 60 programs, 2\ncenters per program, and up to 3 classrooms per center for a\ntotal of 486 classrooms. The analysis sample for the present\nthese were the center-based classrooms (non-home visiting)\nfor which classroom observation data were available.\nAdditional demographic information for teachers can be\nthree-and four-year-old children (49.8% female) who were\nHispanic; and 36.0% Hispanic/Latino.\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

FACES = Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey.\nMeasures\nIn-person interviews were conducted with center directors dur-\ning the fall of 2009. During these interviews, directors reported\non program characteristics and management practices, as well\nas personal workplace experiences, commitment, satisfaction,\nand experience. Observations of classroom quality were con-\nducted by trained research assistants in the spring of 2010.\nClassroom-level variables\nDimensions of emotional support.Observations of Emo-\ntional Support dimensions were coded using the Classroom\nAssessment Scoring System (CLASS Pre-K; Pianta, La Paro,\n& Hamre, 2008) over four contiguous observation cycles\nwithin a day. Each observation cycle consisted of a 20-min\nobservation followed by a 10-min rating period. During each\nrating cycle, 10 dimensions of quality in teachers' interac-\ntions with children were coded. Each dimension was scored\non a Likert-type scale from 1 = low to 7 = high. Based on\ntheoretical (Hamre & Pianta, 2007) and empirical (Mashburn\net al., 2008) work, three domains are typically formed from\n10 dimensions: Emotional Support, Classroom Organization,\nand Instructional Support. The present study focuses only on\nthe dimensions that constitute classroom Emotional Support:\nPositive Climate, Negative Climate (reversed when aggregat-\ning), Teacher Sensitivity, and Regard for Student Perspec-\ntives. Positive Climate describes the extent to which teachers\ncreate an emotional atmosphere conducive to learning. Teach-\ners whose interactions foster relational closeness, enthusiasm,\nand respect rate highly on Positive Climate. Negative Climate\nrefers to teachers' expressed irritability, anger, or aggression.\nTeacher Sensitivity captures teachers'interactions that support\nindividual student needs, academic or emotional. Regard for\nStudent Perspectives describes the degree to which the teach-\ners' interactions with students and classroom activities place\nan emphasis on students' interests, motivations, and points\nof view, rather than being teacher-driven (Hamre & Pianta,\n2007). Prior to data collection, raters completed training and\npassed a reliability test, which consisted of being within 1\npoint of the gold standard rating 80% of the time (Moiduddin,\nStudent:Teacher ratio. During each CLASS cycle, observ-\ners recorded the total number of children in the room and the\ntotal number of adults. From this, a ratio of children to adults\nwas averaged across the observations.\nCenter-level variables\nJob satisfaction. Directors reported on their Job Satisfac-\ntion via 5-point anchors ranging from 1 (strongly disagree)\nto 5 (strongly agree) on three items, such as \"I really enjoy\nmy present job\" ( = .81).\nManagement challenges.Directors reported their experi-\nences with 11 possible challenges (e.g., staff turnover or not\nenough funds for supplies and activities) on a 3-point scale\nreflecting the degree to which such issues made their jobs\nharder (0 = not at all harder, 1 = somewhat harder, or 2 = a\ngreat deal harder;  = .78).\nPrior turnover rate.The rate of prior turnover was com-\nputed by dividing the total number of teachers who left the\ncenter in the prior year and needed to be replaced by the total\nnumber of teachers employed by the center.\nSteps to address turnover. FACES directors were asked to\nreport which of seven strategies they were using to address\nturnover of staff (e.g., increasing teacher salaries, providing\nmore or better training or education subsidies). Responses\nacross all seven items were summed and final scores range\nfrom 0 (no steps to address turnover) to 7 (all strategies are\nbeing utilized).\nSupportive management practices.Directors reported on\nefforts to support center staff using a 5-point Likert-type\nscale (four items, such as my program \"helps teachers feel\nthat they are part of a team,\"  = .92). During the interview,\ndirectors also reported their highest level of education and\ntheir annual salary in whole numbers\nData Analysis\nAnalyses were conducted in a Hierarchical Linear Modeling\n(HLM; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002) framework to account\nZinsser and Curby 5\nfor the fact that the multiple teachers were nested within each\ncenter. The first step in our analysis was to run an uncondi-\ntional model for each outcome (Positive Climate, Negative\nClimate, Teacher Sensitivity, and Regard for Student\nPerspectives). This answered our first research question by\nproviding an estimate for each variable of the amount of\nvariance at the center level, quantified as an intraclass cor-\nrelation coefficient (ICC).\nNext, the student\u00adteacher ratio variable was added as a\npredictor at Level 1. Finally, Level 2 variables were added to\nthe model. All variables were grand-mean centered during\nanalysis. HLM software does not report standardized coeffi-\ncients, so all effects are reported with unstandardized coef-\nficients. Notably, classroom sampling weights were used to\nadjust for the probability of classroom selection and class-\nroom-level response, such that results are representative of\nthe entire Head Start 2009 cohort of teachers and centers\n(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,\nAdministration for Children and Families, Office of Planning,\nResults\nThe degree to which there was center-level variance in each\nof the emotional support dimensions was calculated by run-\nning unconditional models, which partition the variance in\neach outcome into classroom-level and center-level compo-\nnents. Each ICC is calculated as the proportion of center-\nlevel variance divided by the total variance. ICCs from the\nunconditional models are presented in Table 2. ICCs were\nsignificant for Positive Climate (ICC = .18), Teacher\nSensitivity (ICC = .23), and Regard for Student Perspectives\n(ICC = .34), but not for Negative Climate (ICC = .05).\nBecause the goal of the analyses was to look at the contribu-\ntion of center-level predictors, and Negative Climate did not\nhave significant center-level variance, Negative Climate was\ndropped from additional analyses. For the remaining dimen-\nsions, the significant ICCs indicate that a portion of the vari-\nance in classroom quality can be attributed to the centers.\nFinal models with all predictors are presented in Table 2.\nEach model provided an intercept that can be interpreted as\nthe mean level for the outcome when all classroom and cen-\nter variables had the average level (because they were cen-\ntered at the grand mean). Positive Climate had an intercept of\n5.38. In terms of predictors, surprisingly, Prior Turnover\nRate (b = 0.24, p < .05), the only significant predictor, was\npositively related to Positive Climate. In other words, centers\nwith higher turnover the previous year had higher levels of\nPositive Climate. For Teacher Sensitivity, the intercept was\n4.74. Once again, Prior Turnover Rate was positively related\nto the outcome (b = 0.32, p < .01). For Regard for Student\nPerspectives, the intercept was 4.52. Job satisfaction was the\nDiscussion\nThree findings are notable from this study. First, portions of\nvariance in some dimensions of emotional support can be\nconsidered to be center-level characteristics. Second, emo-\ntional support dimensions were differentially predicted by\ncharacteristics of the center and the director. Third, typical\nindicators of center quality do not substantially explain class-\nroom quality in the form of emotional support.\nCenter-Level Variance\nThere was a wide range of variance attributable to the center\nlevel. Estimates ranged from an insignificant amount of vari-\nance in Negative Climate to 34% in Regard for Student\nPerspective. Thus, in some instances and to some extent,\ndimensions of emotional support can be viewed as a charac-\nteristic of the center. These dimensions are typically aggre-\ngated together; however, the amount that they have variance\nattributable to the center varied substantially across\ndimensions.\nNegative Climate\nNegative Climate, while an indicator of classroom quality\nand a predictor of child outcomes (Curby & Chavez, 2013),\nmust be considered in a different way from the other three\ndimensions of emotional support. The fact that Negative\nClimate does not have (much) center-level variance suggests\nthat this is primarily a characteristic of a classroom and\nnot a center. However, this should not be taken to mean that\ncenter-level supports would not be useful. Rather,\nTable 2.

HLM = hierarchical linear modeling; ICC = intraclass correlation\ncoefficient.\n6 SAGE Open\ncenter-level support should be given individually to those\nteachers who struggle with Negative Climate in their class-\nrooms. In instances of classrooms with persistent Negative\nClimate, interventions would likely be most effective if they\nfocused on working with centers to support individual\nteachers on classroom climate, rather than applying more\nuniversal center-level interventions.\nGenerally, these results do not support the use of the\nCLASS instrument as an indicator of center quality, such as\nin QRIS programs, in instances when few teachers from a\ncenter are sampled as only a small proportion of teachers'\nclassroom practices are indicators of center quality. These\nresults are in alignment with those of Karoly and colleagues\n(2013) who suggested that center-level evaluations of class-\nroom quality will be best estimated using a larger proportion\nof randomly selected classrooms. This finding is especially\nimportant to communicate to center directors and state QRIS\nadministrators. When a large proportion of classrooms are\nnot sampled, few inferences can be made about the center,\njust as teachers should not be judged based on a handful of\nobservations or children.\nPredictors of Emotional Support\nTurnover.Turnover rate, generally considered a negative\nindicator of center quality, was actually found to be a posi-\ntive indicator of emotional support. We had expected to find\na negative effect because turnover is likely to bring in less-\nexperienced teachers who require additional training, and\nteachers who are leaving on their own will may be choosing\nto do so because of negative characteristics of the center.\nHowever, as was alluded to above, it is possible that turn-\nover may also reflect purposeful counseling-out of under-\nperforming or underqualified teachers on the part of a center\ndirector. Although these data do not allow us to explain the\ncause of high turnover rates, it is notable that these data\nwere collected shortly after the most recent Head Start\nReauthorization Act (2007), which raised teacher education\nrequirements. Therefore, in this 2009 sample, turnover may\nhave been increased relative to past cohorts as the 2011\ndeadline for new education minimums approached. Unfor-\ntunately, this explanation cannot be tested with prior years'\nFACES data, because 2009 was the first year in which the\nentire CLASS measure was administered. One potential\nexplanation for this positive association between quality and\nprior turnover rates is that newly hired teachers may be bet-\nter educated than those they are replacing. It may also be\nthat teachers who were hired more recently have been\ntrained in ways that reflect more recent conceptualizations\nof classroom quality and are thus better able to teach in\nmore emotionally supportive ways. Head Start Directors\nmay also be hiring teachers differentially. Directors may be\nhiring teachers who are more knowledgeable about the\nCLASS measure because it is commonly being used to eval-\nuate program quality. Furthermore, recent qualitative work\nhas shown that teachers who score higher on CLASS Emo-\ntional Support actually conceptualize their role in emotion\neducation differently from lower scoring peers (Zinsser,\nShewark, Denham, & Curby, 2014). Either way, directors\nmay be aware of these differences when interviewing pro-\nspective new hires or using such differences to make hiring\ndecisions.\nDirector job satisfaction.The other significant predictor of\ncenter variance in emotional support was center director job\nsatisfaction. Directors who enjoy their jobs, feel they are\nmaking a difference, and are committed to early childhood\neducation tended to have teachers who scored higher on\nRegard for Student Perspectives. Regard for Student Per-\nspectives includes the degree to which teachers are over-\ncontrolling (low end) or give students autonomy and respon-\nsibility (high end). It may be that teachers who give students\nautonomy are easier to work with and are contributing to a\nmore positive workplace environment. Perhaps this is easier\nto see in the opposite: Teachers who are over-controlling\nmay be very particular in how they feel their classroom\nshould operate and may be less accepting of director input.\nThus, a center director's feelings of efficacy could be dimin-\nished, resulting in lower job satisfaction. We believe that this\nassociation is important to communicate to center directors\nas well, as it underscores the interconnected ecology of pre-\nschool centers. Directors' own workplace experiences are\nindirectly related to children's experiences in the classrooms\nthrough their teachers. Thus, directors who wish to positively\naffect children may benefit from some degree of\nself-reflection.\nSeeking additional predictors of center-level variance.Except\nfor the predictors discussed above, the majority of hypoth-\nesized predictors of center-level variance were not predic-\ntive. Many structural characteristics of centers that are\nheavily regulated and for which there are resources avail-\nable to directors (e.g., education level, management chal-\nlenges such as insufficient technical assistance, and\nsupportive management practices such as providing orien-\ntation to new teachers) were not related to emotional sup-\nport dimensions. For example, student:teacher ratio, which\nconceptually should be related to emotional support, was\nnot related in these data. However, unsurprisingly, the regu-\nlations around ratios result in little variance, and therefore\nany effects of these ratios has already been felt throughout\nthe programs. We suspect a similar reason was at play with\ncenter director education levels, where all directors had at\nleast some college and the majority had a bachelor's degree\nor greater. Thus, any effects of education would have to be\noperating within the higher end of education. Conversely,\nthere was a great deal of variance in center director salaries\nbut salary was not a significant predictor in any of our mod-\nels. We expect that this lack of association is due in part to\nthe fact that Head Start grantees determine pay scales based\nZinsser and Curby 7\non local factors such as cost of living. Although within a\ngrantee's jurisdiction more effective center directors may\nbe paid more, when examining data nationally, we cannot\nassume that all highly paid directors in urban areas with\nhigh costs of living are more effective managers than their\nrural peers\nAnother reason for the lack of associations may be that\nthe characteristics captured in these scales of challenges and\nsupportive techniques are not telling the whole story. There\nhave been calls for research to identify what effective center\ndirector management practices look like in the early child-\nhood field (Muijs, Aubrey, Harris, & Briggs, 2004). Still,\nthe majority of research on early childhood leadership has\nfocused on more tangible aspects of program administra-\ntion, including compliance with health, safety, legislative,\nand contractual requirements; coordinating family and\nsocial services; and financial management (e.g., Osgood &\nStone, 2002). Even the recently formed Head Start National\nCenter on Program Management and Fiscal Operations is\nprimarily focused on structural components such as \"fiscal\nplanning . . . risk management, governance, data collection\nand analysis, and budgeting and cost allocation\" (Education\nDevelopment Center, 2014). Future research utilizing less\nstructurally focused measures will be necessary to identified\nwhich characteristics of centers and/or center directors\naccount for shared variance in classroom emotional support\nquality.\nAlthough broader, the well-known work conducted by\nBloom and colleagues (Bloom, 2010; Bloom & Sheerer,\napproach. In response to decades of research into early\nchildhood teacher turnover, job satisfaction, and burnout,\nBloom worked to develop assessment tools focused on\norganizational climate and work attitudes (Bloom, 2010)\nto help program administrators identify organizational\nthreats to teacher retention and quality of care. The Early\nChildhood Job Satisfaction Survey captures teachers'\nexperiences of workplace satisfaction and frustration as\nwell as experiences of support and professional growth\n(Bloom, 2010). Although it is more emotionally focused,\nthis instrument has not been extensively used to examine\ndirectors' experiences or the associations among direc-\ntors, teachers and emotionally supportive classroom\npractices.\nIn predicting children's emotional experiences in pre-\nschool, measures that tap into emotional climate and emo-\ntionally relevant management practices may be most\nbeneficial for identifying the role of emotions in early child-\nhood education and connecting workplace climate with\nteacher and child social and emotional competencies\n(Zinsser, 2013). When present, a culture and climate of sup-\nport within a Head Start center can have positive impacts on\nteachers' job satisfaction and commitment (McGinty et al.,\n2008) and the quality of children's learning environments\nLimitations and Future Directions\nIt is notable that a majority of the predictors included in these\nmodels were not able to significantly explain the center-level\nvariance in Emotional Support. This could be due to limita-\ntions in measurement. The variables selected and included in\nthese models are somewhat indirectly related to the mea-\nsured outcomes. It is possible that there are other center-level\nindicators of center directors contributing to emotional sup-\nport, such as the employment of a mental health consultant or\nadoption of a social-emotional learning curriculum, which\ncould be included in future analyses. Future work should\nalso consider role of assistant directors in a center.\nBeyond such structural components, there are few mea-\nsures that capture non-structural center director elements\nwhich may influence classroom emotional support quality.\nMeasures that assess the process of a director constructing an\nemotionally supportive climate and culture may better eluci-\ndate the connections between teachers' workplace experi-\nences and their use of supportive classroom practices. Future\nwork to develop such measures would benefit both research\nand practice if paired with professional development.\nAlthough generalizable to Head Start in 2009, we do not\nknow the degree to which features of Head Start make this\nstudy's findings unique to that context, nor do we know how\nchanging policies have continued to reshape Head Starts and\nthereby change this study's findings. Future work will need\nto continue to explore the stability of these findings over\ntime and in different early childhood contexts.\nConclusion\nInitiatives such as the Race To The Top Early Learning\nChallenge encourage the development of a high-quality early\nchildhood workforce. Thus research into the potential path-\nways of influence on teachers and students is increasingly\nnecessary. In particular, it is important to know how center-\nlevel contextual factors lay the foundation for supportive\nteacher\u00adchild interactions. Findings indicate that center-level\ncharacteristics explain meaningful portions of variance in\neach dimension of emotional support except Negative\nClimate but that these dimensions were differentially pre-\ndicted by characteristics of the center and the director,\nincluding director job satisfaction. Based on these results we\nnow know that a substantial proportion of teachers' class-\nroom behaviors can be explained by factors at the center\nlevel. At the same time, this study draws into question the\ntrend of QRIS programs utilizing aggregate observations of a\nsmall sample of teachers to represent center quality, because\nonly a third of teachers' classroom practices are representa-\ntive of center-level quality.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n8 SAGE Open\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: The authors are\ngrateful for an award from the Inter-university Consortium for\nPolitical and Social Research for training in the FACES datasets.\nThe authors also wish to acknowledge the Research Open Access\nPublishing (ROAAP) Fund of the University of Illinois at Chicago\nfor financial support toward the open access publishing fee for this\narticle.\nReferences\nBarnett, W.
