Concern regarding\neffects on anaemia, nutrition, growth and intellec-\ntual development, and specific disease syndromes,\nhas led to increasing advocacy for mass deworming\n[3], with new recommendations for treatment in\ntwo special, relatively unstudied groups \u00ad pregnant\nwomen and preschool children [4]. Our study\naddresses the effects of treatment in these two\ngroups.\nMost people with helminths are unaware of their\ninfection, probably because helminth-induced\nimmunomodulation reduces host responses, allow-\ning parasite survival and minimizing tissue damage\n[5]. This immunomodulation may \"spill-over\",\naltering responses to unrelated organisms (viruses\nWe aim to determine whether these immunomod-\nulating effects are sufficient to reduce the efficacy of\nimmunization and increase susceptibility to infec-\ntious diseases in childhood; and, if so, whether they\ncan be removed by deworming. In particular, it is\nproposed that the high prevalence of helminth\ninfections in the tropics contributes to the low effi-\ncacy of Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immuniza-\ntion and high incidence of tuberculosis in this\nregion [16\u00ad18]. BCG is frequently given to\nneonates, before acquisition of helminth infection,\nso the finding that exposure to helminths in utero\ncan influence the neonatal response to BCG may be\nparticularly important [19,20], but the implications\nof observed changes in immune responses for\nvaccine efficacy are not known. We planned, there-\nfore, to study both the effects of maternal\nhelminths and of deworming during pregnancy,\nand the effects of acquisition of helminths and\nof deworming in early childhood, on responses\nto immunization and on disease incidence in\nchildhood.\nHelminth infections are generally considered\ndetrimental. However, recent evidence suggests that\nthey may have some benefits, protecting against\nabnormal immune responses associated with atopic\nand autoimmune disease [21\u00ad23]. Indeed, trials to\ninvestigate the treatment of such conditions with\nhelminths are in progress [24,25]. Helminths may\nalso have a beneficial effect on the response to\nother pathogens, perhaps protecting against severe\nmalaria [26], or modulating the progression of HIV\nThis trial is therefore designed to investigate the\nbalance of detrimental and beneficial effects of early\nexposure to helminths and of their treatment. Here\nwe describe how the design of the trial evolved in\nresponse to changes in policy regarding deworming\nin pregnancy, to preliminary findings, and to results\nfrom concurrent research. We show that the final\nprotocol involves a novel factorial design, examin-\ning related interventions not in the same study sub-\njects, but in pregnant women and their offspring.\nThis design gives efficiency with regard to logistics,\ncost and trial burden in the community, but is also\npertinent to policy, as interactions between the\ninterventions, or additive effects would be impor-\ntant during implementation.\nHypotheses\nOur initial hypothesis anticipated that maternal\nand childhood helminth infection would have\ndetrimental effects on the response to childhood\nimmunizations and to infectious diseases in\ninfancy. However, our preliminary findings [23],\nsuggested possible benefits in relation to disease\nmediated by poorly regulated inflammatory\nresponses. Thus our current hypotheses, amended\nin response to preliminary findings, are that 1)\nmaternal and childhood helminth infections\nreduce the effectiveness of childhood immunizations\nand increase susceptibility to viral and bacterial infec-\ntious diseases, while reducing the incidence of\ndiseases mediated by poorly-regulated inflammatory\nresponses; 2) treatment of maternal and childhood\nhelminth infection improves the effectiveness of\nchildhood immunizations and modulates disease\nincidence in childhood, with both beneficial and\ndetrimental effects.\nDesign\npresumptive treatment with albendazole in preg-\nnancy and early childhood and commenced in June\ndesign (the \"preliminary study\") have been\nHealth Organization (WHO) recommended that\npregnant and lactating women with schistosomiasis\nno longer be excluded from treatment, but be given\npraziquantel individually or during mass treatment\n[4]. Therefore, the study was discontinued and\nredesigned to include the use of praziquantel in\npregnancy. The revised design is presented here.\nRecruitment using the revised design (the \"main\nThe study is a clinical trial with three ran-\ndomised interventions at two times, two in preg-\nnant women, and one in their children. For this we\npropose the designation, a 2  2(2) factorial\ndesign (Figure 1).\nDeworming in pregnancy and early childhood 43\n44 AM Elliott et al.\n(1) During pregnancy, women are randomized to\nalbendazole versus placebo and praziquantel\nversus placebo: women receive a) praziquan-\ntel  albendazole, b) praziquantel  placebo, c)\nalbendazole  placebo, or d) placebos only. All\nwomen are treated with both drugs after delivery.\n(2) At age 15 months their children are random-\nized to three-monthly albendazole or placebo, to\ncontinue to age five years. This randomization is\nindependent of the mother's. Children provide\nstool samples at annual visits and are treated for\nhelminths found.\nThe two intervention times create two phases.\nThe first addresses effects of maternal helminths\nand maternal treatment, with immunological\noutcomes measured at age one year, and clinical\nevents analysed from age zero to 15 months. The\nsecond addresses the duration of effects of maternal\nhelminths and maternal treatment, and effects of\nacquisition of helminths and of three-monthly\ntreatment with albendazole in childhood.\nSetting\nThe study area comprises Entebbe Municipality\nand Katabi subcounty, a peninsula in Lake Victoria,\nUganda (Figure 2) occupied by semiurban, rural\nand fishing communities. The prevalence of\nhelminths among pregnant women is 66% [23]\n(Schistosoma mansoni, 23%; hookworm, 38%;\nMansonella perstans, 22% [20]); the prevalence of\nHIV, 13% [28]. Malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea\nare common in young children. Atopic disease is\nexpected to be sufficiently common to be assessed\nRecruitment and follow-up\nParticipation of the Ministry of Health, Entebbe\nHospital and the community were, and are crucial\nto preparation for the study, recruitment and\nfollow-up. Before the study began, the research\nFigure 1 A clinical trial with three randomised, placebo-\ncontrolled treatments at two times: a 2  2(2) factorial\ndesign\nFigure 2 Study setting\nteam collaborated with the Ministry and Hospital\nto provide training in prevention of mother-\nto-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) and implement\nPMTCT using nevirapine [29] in Entebbe.\nConcurrently, maternity staff participated in plan-\nning the study and trained in data and sample\ncollection. Research procedures were integrated\ninto antenatal and maternity routines.\nMeetings were also held with community leaders.\nThe study area comprises 57 villages, each with\nan elected executive. Each committee appointed\nvolunteer assistants, two at first, supplemented\nas the study expanded, to a total of approximately\n150 volunteers. Volunteers visit participants twice\na month to make simple checks on the baby's\nhealth, and attend monthly meetings to provide\nfeedback. They receive a bicycle and a small\nallowance. Their work is supervised by full-\ntime field-workers, and verified by routine\nchecks with participants and spot-checks at their\nhomes.\nStudy procedures are outlined in Figure 3.\nRoutine follow-up visits are at six, 10 and 14 weeks\n(polio, Diphtheria, tetanus, Pertussis, Haemophilus\nand hepatitis B immunization), six months, nine\nmonths (measles immunization) and one year.\nThereafter children are seen quarterly, to receive\nstudy medication; vitamin A is given six-monthly.\nMothers bring participating children for interim\nvisits if they are sick.\nNevirapine for PMTCT and antiretroviral\ntherapy, if required, for HIV-positive participants,\nare provided through the Hospital.\nInformation and consent\nWritten and verbal information is provided\nin English and the vernacular. Documents written\nin the vernacular are checked by back-translation.\nConsent is recorded by signature or thumb-\nprint. Before enrolment, women consent for partic-\nipation during pregnancy and for their expected\ninfants' participation to age one year. There\nis no lower age limit for inclusion: all pregnant\nwomen (including those younger than 18 years)\nare entitled to give consent in Uganda, and investi-\ngation of the interventions among a represen-\ntative population, including the youngest women\nwhose helminth prevalence might be highest\n[30], was considered appropriate. After the baby\nis delivered, mothers are given written information\nto take home for the fathers. When infants are\none-year old, information is provided, and\nconsent obtained, for the trial of treatment in\nchildhood. The mother or father (or guardian if\nboth are deceased or unavailable) consents for the\nchild.\nParasitology\nStool and blood samples are obtained from women\nat enrolment and delivery; from children at annual\nvisits. Stools are examined using the Kato-Katz\nStrongyloides [31,33]. Two Kato-Katz slides are pre-\npared from each sample, each examined within 30\nminutes for hookworm, the following day for other\nparasites. Blood is examined for Mansonella by a\nmodified Knott's method [34]. Intensity of infec-\ntion is assessed by egg counts in stool and microfi-\nlarial counts in blood.\nInterventions\nDeworming women during pregnancy and after\ndelivery\nThe interventions during pregnancy are given as a\nsingle treatment, at any time during the second or\nthird trimester.\nThe randomization code was prepared by the\ntrial statistician using Stata version 7 (College\nStation, Texas, USA). Numbers were allocated in\n1) Praziquantel  albendazole\n2) Praziquantel  placebo matching albendazole\n3) Placebo matching praziquantel  albendazole\n4) Placebo matching praziquantel  placebo\nmatching albendazole\nChewable albendazole and matching placebo\ntablets were supplied in bulk (GlaxoSmithKline,\nBrentford, UK). Praziquantel tablets, (Medochemie\nLtd, Limassol, Cyprus) were used to prepare identi-\ncal praziquantel 300 mg and placebo capsules\n(Almedica Europe Ltd, Deeside, UK). Colleagues in\nEntebbe, not otherwise involved in the study,\nprepare opaque, sealed envelopes, numbered\naccording to the randomization code, containing a\nsingle dose of albendazole 400 mg (or matching\nplacebo) and 12 capsules of praziquantel (or match-\ning placebo).\nInterviewer-counsellors allocate treatment in\norder of the randomization sequence to women\nenrolling at the antenatal clinic and observe the\ntreatment. Each woman receives 400 mg albenda-\nzole (or matching placebo) and praziquantel cap-\nsules (or matching placebo) equivalent to a dose of\n40 mg/kg; leftover capsules are discarded.\nSix weeks after delivery all women receive alben-\nadditional anthelmintic treatment if indicated by\nstool results (such as prolonged treatment for\nStrongyloides). This was considered necessary, to\navoid prolonged delay in treatment of women for\nDeworming in pregnancy and early childhood 45\n46 AM Elliott et al.\npotentially damaging helminth infections. Of\nconcern for interpretation of the results of the trial\nis the possibility that there might be an effect on\nthe infant, mediated through breastfeeding, of\ntreating the mother after delivery. By treating all\nwomen after delivery, any such effects are kept as\nsimilar as possible between the intervention groups\n(although, unavoidably, the reduction in worm\nloads in those treated during pregnancy may mean\nthat effects of the second treatment are not\nidentical between groups). A second option, treat-\ning only those not treated during pregnancy, would\nhave meant that any effect of treatment during\nbreastfeeding would be confined to the groups not\ntreated during pregnancy, creating uncertainty\nabout whether treatment during pregnancy or after\ndelivery was more important in determining\noutcomes in the children. The third option, not\ntreating women after delivery, or waiting for, say, a\nyear, was not considered to be ethical, due to\nFigure 3 Study procedures\nthe resulting neglect of treatment or prolonged\ndelay.\nDeworming children aged 15 months\nto five years\nThe intervention in childhood is albendazole or\nplacebo given three-monthly.\nA second randomization code, for treatment of\nchildren, was prepared by the trial statistician using\nStata version 7.

Children receive\n200 mg (5 mL) albendazole syrup (or matching\ning syrup from each bottle is discarded. Children\nreceive 400mg albendazole or matching placebo\nthree-monthly from age two to five years. Nurses\ngive and observe the treatments.\nStool samples from children are examined at\neach annual visit; helminths found are treated.\nAll clinical staff and participants will remain\nblinded to treatment allocations for women and\nchildren until the study is complete.\nOutcomes\nThe principal outcomes are:\n1) Immunological responses to BCG and tetanus\nimmunization\n2) Incidence of infection in childhood with malaria\nand Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n3) Incidence of infectious and atopic disease events\nin childhood (pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria,\nmeasles, tuberculosis and vertical HIV transmis-\nsion; atopic eczema, urticaria, allergic rhinitis\nand conjunctivitis, wheeze).\nSecondary outcomes are anaemia, growth and\ndevelopment.\nImmunological responses to\nchildhood immunisations\nCellular responses to antigens from BCG and to\ntetanus toxoid will be measured using whole blood\ncytokine assays [20,35], providing data on the type\nand quantity of cytokine produced. Measurements\nwill be made in samples obtained at age one, three\nand five years.\nBCG is a live, attenuated strain of Mycobacterium\nbovis. Immunization usually leads to scarring at the\ninoculation site and sometimes to complications\nsuch as abscess formation, lymphadenopathy or\ndisseminated disease [36]. Examining our\npreliminary data, we realized that helminth-\ninduced changes in the response to BCG might\ninfluence not only cytokine responses, but also scar\nsize [20] and perhaps the incidence of complica-\ntions. Therefore, in the final protocol, these\noutcomes are systematically documented at age\nsix weeks and one year, and as illness events if\nappropriate.\nTetanus immunization induces antibody produc-\ntion, required for its beneficial effect. Antibody will\nbe measured at age one, three and five years.\nAssessment of responses to measles immunization\nwill be performed in a substudy.\nIncidence of infection\nHelminth infection may influence disease expres-\nsion for malaria [26], and our preliminary data\nsuggest a possible beneficial effect on disease\nincidence in children aged two to three years\n(unpublished data). However an effect on incidence\nof infection is perhaps unlikely, since this depends\non biting by infected mosquitoes. To make this\ndistinction, malaria parasitaemia will be deter-\nmined at annual visits. In view of the potential\npublic health importance of understanding the\neffects of helminths on malaria, measurement of\nanti-malarial antibody was added to the planned\nmeasurements, in the final protocol, as an\nadditional surrogate measure of incidence of\nOn the other hand, recent data suggest that\nBCG immunization may protect against infection\nwith Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as\nagainst disease [38]. If so, helminth infection\nmay modulate this protective effect. Thus, in\naddition to the outcome of tuberculosis disease\n(planned from the outset, and discussed below)\nwe will estimate the incidence of tuberculosis\ninfection at annual visits by examining the cellular\nresponse to antigens (such as early secreted antigen-\n6) present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis but\nnot BCG.\nDeworming in pregnancy and early childhood 47\n48 AM Elliott et al.\nIncidence of disease events\nThe initial protocol focussed on infectious disease\noutcomes. In response to preliminary results and\nconcurrent research, atopic diseases outcomes were\nadded.\nDisease events are documented at clinic visits.\nPneumonia is defined as cough, with difficulty in\nbreathing, and fast breathing (defined by age), with\nor without abnormal breath sounds [39]. X-rays dis-\ntinguish clinical and radiological pneumonia [40].\nDiarrhoea is defined by the mother's report, with\nstool frequency recorded [41]. Malaria is defined as\nfever with parasitaemia, but this definition will be\nreviewed as data on asymptomatic parasitaemia at\nroutine visits accrues, allowing a definition related\nto asymptomatic parasite counts to be developed\n[42]. Measles is defined by standard clinical criteria,\nconfirmed by measurement of specific IgM [43].\nTuberculosis suspects are investigated using gastric\naspirates, lymph node aspirates, or material from\nother sites, for culture using BACTECTM (Becton\nDickinson, Sparks, Maryland, USA). Where positive\ncultures cannot be obtained, a diagnostic algorithm\nData from clinic visits are supported by data col-\nlected at twice-monthly, community visits.\nVertical transmission of HIV infection is deter-\nmined by viral RNA assays (HIV-1 RNA 3.0 assay;\nBayer plc, Newbury, UK) in cord blood and at age\nsix weeks; by HIV-antibody tests at age 18 months.\nAtopic eczema, urticaria, allergic rhinitis, allergic\nconjunctivitis and wheeze are defined using criteria\nfrom the International Study of Asthma and\nAllergies in Childhood (ISAAC) [46], modified to\nsuit our young age-group. Documentation of clinic\nevents will be complemented by ISAAC-based ques-\ntionnaires at age one and four years.\nAnaemia, growth and development\nOur principal objectives relate to immunological,\ninfectious and atopic disease outcomes. However,\neffects on anaemia, growth and development are\nimportant for evaluation of overall risks and\nbenefits of deworming.\nHaemoglobin is measured in women at enrolment\nand delivery; in cord blood, and in children at\nannual visits.\nGrowth is assessed by birthweight, weights at all\nroutine visits, and measurements of height, head\ncircumference and mid upper-arm circumference at\nannual visits.\nIntellectual function is assessed at age 15 months, by\ntrained clinical staff, using a culturally appropriate\ntool (the Kilifi Developmental Inventory; Wellcome\nTrust Unit, Kilifi, Kenya). A new tool will be devel-\noped for assessment in children aged five years.\nStatistical considerations\nThe analyses will have two components: analysis of\nthe intervention trial (which is randomized) and\nanalysis of the effects of helminths (which is obser-\nvational).\nMajor analyses will be conducted for each phase\nof the study.\n(1) When all children complete age 15 months,\nanalyses will address effects of maternal\nhelminths and maternal treatment on outcomes\nin infancy.\n(2) When all children complete five years, analyses\nwill address the duration of effects originating in\npregnancy, and effects of acquisition of\nhelminths and of three-monthly albendazole\nbetween age one and five years.\nUnblinded analyses conducted before the end of\nthe trial, such as Phase 1 analyses, will be performed\nby the trial statistician. Other staff will see only\naggregated data.\nAnalysis of the interventions in pregnancy\nand of maternal helminth infection\nThe interventions in pregnancy will be analysed by\nintention to treat. Effects of presumptive treatment\non study outcomes for the whole study population\nwill be examined. Three subgroup analyses are\nplanned, as follows, because effects are expected to\nbe stronger when mothers have susceptible species:\n(1) effects of albendazole if mother had any species\nsusceptible to albendazole at enrolment;\n(2) effects of albendazole if mother had hookworm\nat enrolment (the commonest infection, most\nresponsive to albendazole [20]);\n(3) effects of praziquantel if mother had schistoso-\nmiasis at enrolment.\nInteractions between the treatments will be\nexamined.\nIt is possible that effects of helminths during\npregnancy, established before the interventions are\ngiven, may not be altered or reversed by the inter-\nventions. Further, some species of helminth, such\nas Mansonella, are unlikely to be affected by the\ninterventions. Thus it will be of interest to examine\nthe effects of helminth infection at enrolment on\nthe study outcomes, in addition to the effects of the\ninterventions on the study outcomes. The analysis\nof the effects of helminths at enrolment will obser-\nvational. Differences in effect according to\nhelminth species and intensity of infection, will be\nexamined. This analysis will use logistic or Poisson\nregression or Cox proportional hazards methods (as\nappropriate to each outcome), to take account of\npotential confounding factors including maternal\nage and tribe, maternal malaria or HIV infection\nduring pregnancy, the socioeconomic status of the\nfamily and location of residence.\nThis general approach will be used for analysis of\neffects of maternal helminths and maternal treat-\nment on study outcomes when children reach 15\nmonths, and again at five years. At five years, analy-\nses will adjust for the acquisition and treatment of\nhelminths in childhood.\nAnalysis of the intervention in childhood\nand of the acquisition of helminths between\nage one and five years\nThe intervention in childhood will be analysed by\nintention to treat, for the whole study population.\nNo subgroup analyses are planned.\nAnalysis of the effects of acquisition of\nhelminths will employ categories such as never\ninfected versus ever infected; age at first infection;\ntotal number of annual visits at which infection is\nfound and will take account of potential confound-\ning factors, as discussed above in relation to effects\nof maternal helminths.\nThe effects of the intervention in childhood, and\nof acquisition of helminths, will be adjusted for\neffects of the interventions and of helminth status\nin pregnancy.\nInteractions between maternal and childhood\ninterventions will be examined.\nTwin and triplet pregnancies\nWomen with twin or triplet pregnancies are\nenrolled, and treatment given as for singleton preg-\nnancies. In the analysis allowance will be made for\n\"clustering\" by mother.\nSample-size\nConsiderations regarding sample size evolved with\nthe change in study design to include praziquantel\nas a second intervention in pregnancy, and with the\nacquisition of data from the preliminary part of the\nstudy, as outlined below.\nA cohort of 2500 women has been recruited. This\nsample-size was planned for the initial design (pre-\nsumptive treatment with albendazole in pregnancy\nand early childhood), as sufficient to detect effects\non immunological outcomes and common disease\nevents, and with the hope of detecting an effect on\nincidence of tuberculosis in children under five\nyears old. No information was available for inci-\ndence of tuberculosis in children in the study area.\nIn a well-documented community in South Africa\n3.5 times the incidence in adults [47]. The esti-\nmated overall incidence in Uganda was 320/\nunder-fives might be conservative. It was estimated\nthat, for the effect of albendazole in pregnancy, or\nfor a binary, combined variable for exposure to\nhelminths in utero and/or in childhood (expected to\narm and median follow-up of three years would\ncases p.a. between groups. This estimate of effect\nwas large. However, the study seeks to examine the\npossibility that helminths are crucial to the large\ndifference observed in efficacy of BCG between\ntemperate regions (often above 70%) and the rural\ntropics (close to 0%) [61]. If this was so, then a large\neffect was expected. It was noted that, for compari-\nson of the effects of three-monthly albendazole\nversus placebo in childhood, extension of the\nfollow-up period might be required.\nFollowing the change in study design and acqui-\nsition of data from the preliminary study the power\nof the study to detect important effects and interac-\ntions between interventions was reviewed, assuming\nfollow-up to age five years. In the preliminary study,\napproximately 90% of enrolled mothers were seen\nat delivery and 85% had live babies who entered\nfollow-up. Of live babies, 75% were seen at one\nyear. Although follow-up in the main study has\nbeen better than in the preliminary study, the\nfigures from the preliminary study (with an esti-\nmate of 10% loss to follow up per year after one\nyear) were used when the power of the study was\nreviewed. Estimates may, therefore, be conservative.\nPreliminary results suggest that the sample-size\nwill be adequate for immunological objectives.\nFollowing neonatal BCG immunization, we\nobserved a difference in mean log10\nproduction of\nthe cytokine, gamma interferon, in response to\ncomparing\ninfants of mothers with hookworm to infants of\nmothers without worms, and a difference of 0.28\nbetween infants of mothers with hookworm\nwho did, or did not receive albendazole [20].\nEstimating attendance of 1594 infants at one year,\nand 1046 children at five years, and standard\ncytokine\nto detect differences between intervention arms at\ncytokine response for the whole population, 0.16\nfor the subgroup whose mothers had\nfor those whose\nmothers had schistosomiasis.\nFor clinical outcomes, Tables 1 and 2 illustrate the\nsmallest treatment effects that the study will detect,\nDeworming in pregnancy and early childhood 49\n50 AM Elliott et al.\nTable 1 The incidence of infectious and atopic diseases in childhood.

There was concern that inter-\nventions in pregnancy might lead to serious adverse\nbirth outcomes, so a data monitoring committee\n(DMC) was established to monitor these and other\nserious adverse events. Further, because a transient\nincrease in HIV load following anthelmintic treat-\nment [50] might cause an increase in vertical HIV\ntransmission, results for HIV RNA assays performed\nin HIV-exposed infants at six weeks of age are\nalso reported to the DMC. Ethical considerations\nspecific to the interventions, are as follows.\nAlbendazole versus placebo in pregnancy\nAlbendazole treatment during pregnancy can have\na benefit for anaemia in areas of high hookworm\nprevalence [51]. Therefore women with haemoglo-\nbin below 8g/dL are excluded and referred for treat-\nment of hookworm (Table 3); haematinics and\npresumptive treatment for malaria (interventions\nwith a similar or greater benefit for anaemia in\nAdditional suggested benefits of albendazole in\npregnancy include improvements in birthweight\nand infant survival [53\u00ad55] but these have not been\ndemonstrated in controlled trials.\nTeratogenicity is a concern in the use of benzim-\nidazoles during pregnancy (reported in animals, but\nnot in humans) [56]. Therefore women are enrolled\nafter the first trimester.\nPraziquantel versus placebo in pregnancy\nBefore our study started, no investigations of prazi-\nquantel treatment in pregnancy had been per-\nformed. Although presumed safe, based on animal\nstudies, its use was therefore avoided in pregnancy;\nbreastfeeding was discontinued for 72 hours after\ntreatment to avoid toxicity to the infant. The WHO\nconsultation of 2002 recommended use of prazi-\nquantel during pregnancy based on a lack of evi-\ndence of toxicity in a small number of pregnant\nwomen treated for cysticercosis, and in large\nnumbers treated inadvertently during mass-\ntreatment campaigns, and on concerns regarding\nprolonged neglect of treatment of schistosomiasis\nin women of child-bearing years [4]. However, the\nanecdotal data for cysticercosis do not provide\ninsight into the effects of killing intravenous schis-\ntosomes. In particular, the systemic and transpla-\ncental immunological effects of treatment of\nschistosomiasis in pregnancy are unknown; the\nbenefits and risks for maternal and neonatal health,\nremain uncertain.\nPersistent diarrhoea with blood is the pathologi-\ncal effect of chronic schistosomiasis mansoni most\nlikely to show an immediate response to treatment,\nso women with these symptoms are excluded and\nreferred for investigation and treatment (Table 3).\nProlonged neglect of treatment is avoided in this\nstudy by treatment of all women after delivery.\nThree-monthly albendazole versus placebo\nin children aged 15 months to five years\nSince our study was planned, results have been pub-\nlished describing a trial of deworming in children\nunder five years old in Zanzibar [57,58]. Outcomes\nincluded growth, anaemia and cognitive develop-\nment. This study showed no statistically significant,\nTable 3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria Exclusion criteria\nResident in study area Anaemic: haemoglobin 8 g/dL\nPlanning to deliver in Entebbe General Hospital Clinically apparent severe liver disease\nWilling to participate in the study Diarrhoea with blood in the stool\nWilling to know her HIV status Midwives assess pregnancy to be abnormal\nIn the second or third trimester of pregnancy History of adverse reaction to anthelmintic drugs\nAlready enrolled in an earlier pregnancy\noverall benefit of deworming. Subgroup analyses\nfound that mebendazole was associated with a\nreduction in wasting malnutrition in children\nunder 30 months, and in moderate anaemia for\nchildren under 24 months. The observation of\nbenefit principally in the youngest children, with\nthe lightest worm burdens, was the reverse of the\nresult expected. The authors suggest that the\nyoungest children might be particularly vulnerable\nto the effects of helminths, or that inflammatory\nprocesses during the response to initial helminth\ninfections might have a particularly severe effect.\nThe inconclusive and unexpected nature of these\nresults, added to the possibility that intensive\ndeworming may have adverse effects on atopic\ndisease and on severity of malaria, suggests\nequipoise of potential beneficial and detrimental\neffects, supporting the need for further study.\nEthical approval\nApproval was given by the Science and Ethics\nCommittee, Uganda Virus Research Institute;\nthe Uganda National Council for Science\n& Technology; the London School of Hygiene &\nTropical Medicine.\nDiscussion\nThere is increasing advocacy for deworming, with a\nrecent focus on pregnancy and early childhood.\nTogether with concern regarding effects on\nanaemia, nutrition, growth and development, there\nis intense interest in the hypothesis that helminths\nimpair the response to vaccines and increase\nsusceptibility to infectious diseases, while perhaps\nprotecting against immunologically-mediated\nconditions such as atopic and autoimmune disease\nand severe malaria. There is increasing evidence of\nthe importance of prenatal exposures (including\nexposure to helminth infection) for health out-\ncomes in later life. Despite the potential importance\nof such effects for health policy, few investigations\nhave been conducted to determine the magnitude\nof the proposed effects of helminths, or the ability\nof treatment to modify them.\nOur study design has three aspects of particular\nnote. First, is the intention to examine effects of\nhelminths and of their treatment in the same study.\nAnalysis of the effects of helminths is pertinent,\nbecause their magnitude is uncertain, but must take\naccount of confounding with factors such as\npoverty and malnutrition. Examining the results of\ntreatment in a randomized trial may provide more\nrigorous evidence of helminth-induced effects. This\nis illustrated in Table 4 by a detailed breakdown of\nresults regarding the effects of maternal helminth\ninfection on the incidence of infantile eczema from\nour preliminary study [23]. Although based on\nsmall numbers, and given the proviso that the\nanalysis of effects of helminths requires adjustment\nfor confounders, the results seem to show, in the\nplacebo group, the albendazole-treated group and\noverall, that the rate of eczema was about five times\nhigher in infants whose mothers never had\nhelminths (none-none) compared with those\nwhose mothers had persistent helminths (any-any).\nIn all helminth-status groups, the rate of eczema\nwas higher in the albendazole-treated group than\nthe placebo group (except none-any where both\nrates were zero and numbers small). A small effect\nof albendazole among those whose mothers never\nhad helminths (none-none) may be attributed to\nclearing of infections not detected by the single\nstool examination; a large effect among those\nwhose mothers cleared their infection (any-none)\nsuggests that the risk of eczema was highest in\ninfants of mothers who had helminths that were\ncleared by treatment. Thus data suggesting an effect\nof helminths can be supported by evidence suggest-\ning a reversal of their effect by treatment. At the\nsame time, the effects of a policy of presumptive\ntreatment in pregnancy can be considered.\nSecond, we have chosen to examine effects of\nboth albendazole and praziquantel during preg-\nnancy in the same trial. This is relevant, since\ndeworming policy is likely to recommend both in\nregions where geohelminths and schistosomiasis\nare coprevalent [59,60]. However, there is increas-\ning evidence that immunological effects vary\nbetween helminth genera. Studying these two treat-\nments in a factorial design will allow us to examine\ntheir effects both separately and together.\nThird, we have chosen to incorporate a trial of\nthe effects of deworming in young children in the\nsame cohort as a trial of deworming in pregnancy.\nThis again reflects emerging policy. Some losses are\ninevitable between pregnancy and childhood, so\nthe number of people randomized in the childhood\ncomponent differs from the number randomized\nduring pregnancy, and the people themselves,\nbeing mother and child are different. Despite this,\nthe interventions are related and may have interact-\ning or additive effects; hence the proposed, novel\ndesignation, a 2  2(2) factorial design. This\napproach is, as far as we know, unprecedented, but\nis particularly relevant to the implementation of\nrelated interventions in mothers and children,\nwhen important interactions, such as potentiation\nof effects of interventions in pregnancy by inter-\nvention in childhood, may occur.\nIn addition to achieving scientific goals, the\ncombining of objectives is a matter of expediency.\nDespite uncertainty regarding the benefits and risks\nDeworming in pregnancy and early childhood 53\n54 AM Elliott et al.\nTable 4 Associations between incidence of infantile eczema, maternal helminth infection and treatment with albendazole during pregnancy\nIncidence rates for eczema in infants age 0\u00ad15 months*\nMaternal helminth infection status Mother received placebo Mother received albendazole Overall\nPerson\nyears of Number of Rate Number of Rate Number of Rate\nIn pregnancy At delivery follow-up episodes (95% CI) episodes (95% CI) episodes (95% CI)\n*Data from the preliminary study. Multiple events occurring in the same infants are included in these crude rates. A more detailed analysis, allowing for multiple episodes using a\nrandom effects model, is presented elsewhere [23].\nof deworming in pregnancy and young children,\nenthusiasm for these policies means that the\nwindow of opportunity for conducting such studies\nis likely to be short. Indeed, our ability to detect\neffects of the acquisition and treatment of\nhelminths in young children may be limited by the\non-going provision of albendazole in Uganda by\ncommunity-based distributors and on twice-yearly\n\"child days\"; this extra treatment is, however, mon-\nitored in the study, and uptake is likely to be similar\nbetween the randomized groups.\nThe study has several potential limitations. First,\nthe sample-size may be insufficient for evaluation\nof rare outcomes. Interpretation of the effects of\nhelminths on the response to immunization\ndepends, ultimately, on incidence of disease, thus\nrare outcomes of particular interest include tubercu-\nlosis and measles. The likely incidence of tuberculo-\nsis infection and disease in the cohort remains low\nand uncertain. The incidence of measles may\nincrease in older children as vaccine-induced protec-\ntion wanes, but depends, among other things, on\nvaccine coverage in the community. Similarly, while\neffects on infantile eczema are of interest, effects on\nlong-term risk of asthma will be of greater impor-\ntance. Follow-up is currently planned to age five\nyears, but longer follow-up may be required to\nobtain conclusive results for such conditions.\nSecond, the results may not all be generalisable.\nCommunities differ in important respects, such as\nspecies and intensity of helminth infection, nutri-\ntional status, and exposure to non-pathogenic\nmycobacteria that may influence immunity to\ntuberculosis [61], to pathogens (such as malaria and\nHIV), to allergens, and to pollutants that may influ-\nence responses to allergens [62\u00ad64]. Similar studies\nare needed in other settings.\nAdvocacy for deworming has created a climate in\nwhich delayed or infrequent deworming may be\nthought unethical. To our knowledge, the only\nclearly demonstrated benefit of deworming in preg-\nnancy is a reduction in hookworm-associated\nanaemia and the benefits of frequent de-worming\nfor children under five are uncertain. In the absence\nof proven benefit, and given the possibility of detri-\nmental effects such as teratogenicity, promotion of\natopic disease or increased severity of malaria,\nplacebo-controlled trials remain appropriate.\nSafeguards to prevent neglect of severe anaemia, or\nof tissue-damaging infections, can be incorporated\ninto the study design, as described.\nThis is the first trial undertaken to examine the\neffects of helminths, and of deworming in preg-\nnancy and young children, on immunological,\ninfectious disease and atopic disease outcomes in\nchildren. The design will allow the role of\nhelminths and benefits of deworming to be eluci-\ndated in relation to the more conventional\noutcomes of anaemia, growth and development,\nalso. The results are expected to inform policy and\nto enhance understanding of both detrimental and\nbeneficial effects of helminth infection.\n"
