    "abstract": "Abstract\nYouth violence is a costly social problem. This study compared the risk and needs of nonviolent\nyouth offenders, with those who had committed violent offenses only (violent only) and those who\nhad committed violent and nonviolent offenses (violent plus) to determine whether violent youth\nwere a different ``type'' from nonviolent youth. The case files of 3,744 youth offenders (3,327 males\nand 417 females, between 12 and 18 years old) were retrospectively coded, before official recidivism\nrecords were obtained. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), w2, and Cox regressions were\nconducted. Violent-plus youth were younger; higher in their total risk and all criminogenic needs;\nmore likely to have several noncriminogenic needs; and at higher risk of any reoffending, violent\nreoffending, and nonviolent reoffending than nonviolent youth. Violent-only youth had the same\ntotal risk and risk of general and violent recidivism as nonviolent offenders but presented different\ncriminogenic and noncriminogenic needs and risk of nonviolent recidivism. Compared to violent-\nonly youth, violent-plus youth were younger, had higher total risk and criminogenic needs on five\ndomains, were more likely to have several noncriminogenic needs, and were at higher risk of all\ntypes of reoffending (except sexual reoffending), suggesting subtypes of violent youth offenders. The\nimplication is that nonviolent and violent youth offenders require different dosage and types of\nintervention.\n",

Studies in United States and United Kingdom estimated that\nthe tangible and intangible costs of violent crimes, which include those committed by youth,\namounted to billions per year (Institute for Economics & Peace, 2013; Shapiro & Hassett, 2012).\n1 Research for Evidence-based Practice, Social Service Institute, Singapore\n2 Centre for Research on Rehabilitation and Protection, Ministry of Social and Family Development, Singapore\nCorresponding Author:\nGerald Zeng, Centre for Research on Rehabilitation and Protection, Ministry of Social and Family Development, 512\nEmail: gerald_zeng@msf.gov.sg\nYouth Violence and Juvenile Justice\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nyvj.sagepub.com\nNotwithstanding the volatility of youth violence trends (Butts & Snyder, 2006; Cook & Laub, 2002),\nthe substantial costs of each violent act (McCollister, French, & Fang, 2010) confirm that violent\noffending by youth requires attention. By virtue of their young age, persistent violent offending\nby youth can result in longer term costs and potentially be more damaging when compared to adult\nviolence. For the above-mentioned reasons, a better understanding of youth violence is critical for\nadvancing prevention and intervention efforts.\nTypological Distinction Between Violent and Nonviolent Youth Offenders\nOffender typology involves classifying offenders into theoretically meaningful or practical cate-\ngories, on the basis that not all offenders are the same (Clements, 1996; Moffitt, 1993). Although\nthe development of reliable and valid offender typologies has its challenges (Byrne & Roberts,\n2007), offender categories are still useful in understanding offending behavior and in predicting\nreoffending (Schmidt, Campbell, & Houlding, 2011). It has also been successfully applied in offen-\nder treatment and management, for example, a meta-analysis showed that matching the intensity of\ntreatment programs to offenders' risk categories was effective in reducing recidivism (Andrews &\nThere is a substantial volume of past research on typologies of delinquents (see brief review by\nLoeber, Farrington, & Waschbusch, 1998). In particular, Loeber and colleagues examined a group of\nyoung offenders termed as ``serious violent juvenile offenders.'' By identifying their unique risk and\nprotective factors, developmental trajectories, and criminal careers, from longitudinal studies using\nself-reports and official records, their research put forward violent delinquents as a category separate\nfrom general delinquency (Loeber & Farrington, 1998).\nRecent research has continued to uncover evidence for a violent group of youth offenders, across\ndifferent operationalization of violent behavior, some of which included combinations with other\noffense types (e.g., violent substance abuser) and offender characteristics (e.g., violent chronic\noffender). Using a large, representative sample of 18,614 adolescents, Vaughn, Salas-Wright,\nDeLisi, and Maynard (2014) identified a severe 5% group who not only showed higher levels of vio-\nlence but also higher levels of substance abuse, and other delinquency behaviors. Baglivio, Jack-\nowski, and Greenwald (2014) used an actuarial risk assessment instrument to characterize serious\nviolent chronic (SVC) youth offenders and found that their reoffending was predicted by a different\nset of risk and protective factors compared to the non-SVC youth offenders. Another study found\nthat the risk factors that predicted the severity of reoffending were different for serious violent offen-\nders, violent property offenders, property offenders, and sex offenders (Mulder, Vermunt, Brand,\nBullens, & Van Marle, 2012). These studies were conducted in Western countries, with majority\nof the samples comprising youth of non-Asian descent.\nAlthough there are overlaps across cultures on their definitions of criminal behavior, the devel-\nopment of deviant behaviors can differ due to cultural norms, morals, religion, taboos, and expec-\ntations (e.g., Bhugra, Popelyuk, & McMullen, 2010; Lahlah, Van der Knaap, Bogaerts, & Lens,\n2013). For example, studies showed that cultural factors are related to the risk and protective factors\nof violent offending (e.g., Flanagan et al., 2011; Soriano, Rivera, Williams, Daley, & Reznik, 2004).\nGiven the lack of research on violent typology among Asian youth offenders, it is useful to examine\nthe dichotomy of violent and nonviolent offenders along with the risk and needs associated with each\ngroup in this population.\nThe distinction between violent and nonviolent offenders has important practical implications for\nlaw enforcers and rehabilitation practitioners in Singapore and other Asian contexts. If the previous\nfinding that violent offenders are a more severe group compared to nonviolent offenders is replicated\n(e.g., Baglivio, Jackowski, & Greenwald, 2014; Mulder et al., 2012), it warrants a sharper demarca-\ntion in intensity of treatment and amount of resources allocated between these two groups.\nSubtypes of Violent Youth Offenders\nLoeber and Stouthamer-Loeber (1998) postulated that youth who are on the overt developmental\npathway will show progression specialized in aggression and violence. In addition, some youth can\nbe on multiple pathways, such as both the overt and the covert pathways (covert pathway involves\nconcealing behaviors such as burglary and theft) or move between pathways (Loeber & Hay, 1994).\nThis suggests a subtype specializing in violent offending and a subtype that is versatile, engaging in\nboth violent and nonviolent offending.\nWith regard to the specialization/versatility of violent delinquents, the extant criminal career lit-\nerature presents a mixed picture. The question of whether there is specialization in particular types of\noffending behavior is important because it determines whether specificity is needed in rehabilitation\n(e.g., targeted treatment and selective detention). Although many researchers had strongly purported\nthat youth offending is predominantly versatile (e.g., Brame, Mulvey, Piquero, & Schubert, 2014;\nFarrington, Synder, & Finnegan, 1988; Piquero, 2000), there has also been evidence of specializa-\ncontrasting literature has been difficult, due to the lack of agreement about the definition of specia-\nlization and shortcomings in methods of analyzing for the presence of specialization (e.g., Baker,\nture has emerged, with research showing that specialization/versatility can vary across individual\ncharacteristics such as peer influence and marriage (McGloin, Sullivan, Piquero, & Pratt, 2007; Tho-\nmas, 2015) or situational variables such as alcohol influence (McGloin et al., 2007). Therefore, crim-\ninal career research and the closely related field of offender typology have to examine\nspecialization/versatility further.\nThe question of specialization can also be addressed by testing for profile differences between\nyouth offenders categorized as specialized violent offenders and those categorized as versatile vio-\nlent offenders. The reasoning is that if different profiles are observed, then there is evidence for a\nspecialized group and a versatile group. This simple approach may provide a less ambiguous set\nof findings on the existence of specialization, to augment criminal career research. Subtypes of vio-\nlent offenders have not received much attention in typology studies and have been examined in only\na handful of studies (Colins, Vermeiren, Schuyten, & Broekaert, 2009; Mulder et al., 2012; Smart\net al., 2003; Vaughn, Salas-Wright, DeLisi, & Maynard, 2014). Generally, versatile violent youth\noffenders have a greater number of risk factors compared to specialized violent youth offenders\n(Smart et al., 2003; Vaughn et al., 2014). Even fewer studies have gone beyond risk factors to exam-\nine recidivism of the groups. For example, Mulder and colleagues found that versatile violent youth\noffenders have higher recidivism compared to the violence specialists. None of the studies used\nactuarial risk assessment tools to characterize the groups.\nRisk and Criminogenic Needs\nOne practical framework which can be used to examine violent offender typology is the risk, need,\nand responsivity (RNR) framework (Andrews, Bonta, & Hoge, 1990) considering its utility in offen-\nder rehabilitation (see meta-analyses by Andrews et al., 1990; Hanson, Bourgon, Helmus, & Hodg-\nson, 2009). The RNR framework and its actuarial risk assessment tool, Youth Level of Service/Case\nManagement Inventory (YLS/CMI), have previously been used in studies examining heterogeneity\nin other offender types, such as youth sex offenders (Zeng, Chu, Koh, & Teoh, 2015) and gang and\nnongang affiliated youth offenders (Chu, Daffern, Thomas, & Lim, 2012).\nThe RNR framework rests on three core tenets: (i) the intensity of the intervention should match\nthe level of risk, (ii) criminogenic needs that are malleable should be targeted to reduce the risk of\nreoffending, and (iii) intervention delivery should be tailored according to an offender's learning\nstyle and abilities for higher responsivity (Andrews et al., 1990). Identification of risk level and rel-\nevant criminogenic needs associated with each offender subtype informs the type and level of inter-\nvention needed (Clements, 1996). It is also useful to examine noncriminogenic needs, which have\nimplications for the tailoring of interventions to ensure responsivity.\nJuvenile Justice in Singapore\nSingapore is an independent island state in South East Asia with a population of 5.5 million\n(Singapore Department of Statistics, 2015). Many statutes are based on the English common law\n(e.g., the Criminal Procedure Code, 2012), but there are some statutes that are based on legislation\nfrom other jurisdictions; for example, the Penal Code (2008) is based on the Indian Penal Code,\nwhich was (nonetheless) first formulated by the English. As such, there are similarities in the way\nthat offenses are defined when compared with the above-mentioned countries. Pertaining to crime\nstatistics, youth arrests account for about 10% of all arrests in Singapore (Singapore Police Force,\nNot all young offenders who commit offenses are charged in the juvenile court (Ministry of\nSocial & Family Development, 2014). In line with a graduated approach in juvenile justice, first-\ntime offenders who have committed minor crimes may be placed on diversionary programs. For\nthose who are charged and convicted by the court, they may be required to undergo community reha-\nbilitation which often includes probation or required to reside in a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre\n(custodial facility for youth offenders) for a period of time.\nIn the early 2000s, there was a collective move by the youth and adult correctional services\ntoward using structured and empirically informed approach to assess youth offenders' risk and\nneeds. The RNR framework was introduced to provide a theoretical and empirical-based approach\nto conduct offender assessment and rehabilitation. The YLS/CMI, and subsequently the YLS/CMI\n2.0, was chosen as the primary risk assessment measure to assess the risk and needs of youth offen-\nders (J. R. Chua, Chu, Yim, Chong, & Teoh, 2014). Within the Singaporean context, YLS/CMI 2.0's\ncoding criteria and cutoffs for risk categories were modified and developed, respectively, for asses-\nsing the local youth offenders and in accordance with the local legislation and procedures.\nPresent Study\nThis study compared nonviolent youth offenders with violent youth offenders who had committed\nviolent offenses only (violent only) and who had committed both violent and nonviolent offenses\n(violent plus) on YLS/CMI total risk scores, criminogenic and noncriminogenic needs, and risk\nof recidivism. In addition to overall recidivism, common forms of recidivism, violent, nonviolent,\nand sexual were examined. The aim was to determine whether violent youth were a different type\nfrom nonviolent youth based on differences in risk levels, rehabilitation needs, and reoffending pat-\nterns. By further differentiating violent youth, this study also explored whether there were subtypes\nof violent youth offenders (i.e., a specialized group and a versatile group).\nBased on previous findings of a higher risk profile of violent offenders in contrast with nonvio-\nlent offenders (e.g., Baglivio et al, 2014; Mulder et al., 2012), it was hypothesized that violent\nyouth offenders (i.e., violent only and violent plus) would have higher YLS/CMI risk scores and\ncriminogenic needs, higher frequency of noncriminogenic needs, and higher risk of reoffending as\ncompared to nonviolent youth offenders. However, the pattern of differences in risk and needs\nbetween violent only and nonviolent youth and between violent plus and nonviolent youth were\nexpected to differ (Mulder et al., 2012; Vaughn et al., 2014). This study also sought to examine\nthe hypothesis that violent-only youth offenders would differ from violent-plus youth offenders\non risk and needs.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe sample comprised of 3,744 youth who were charged with criminal offenses between January\n2004 and December 2008 and were referred to the Ministry of Social and Family Development for\neither probation within the community or residence at a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre (custodial\ntion and 99.0% (480 of 485) of youth under custodial orders for that period of time; the remaining\ncases could not be coded as a result of missing information or file retrieval difficulties. There were\nAs this study was specifically interested in violent nonsexual offenders (who are typologically\ndifferent from sexual offenders; e.g., Craig, Browne, Beech, & Stringer, 2006; Van Wijk et al.,\nmitted both nonviolent and violent offenses. A small proportion, 2.4% (89 of 3,657), had records of\norders.\nProcedure\nApproval for the study was obtained from the Ministry of Social and Family Development before\ncommencing with data collection. Two psychologists, one probation officer, and five research\nassistants reviewed and coded participants' case files retrospectively, between January 2011 and\nSeptember 2012. The case files were obtained from the Ministry of Social and Family Develop-\nment and consisted of (a) psychological reports, (b) presentence reports, (c) charge sheets, (d)\nstatement of facts, (e) any previous assessment and treatment reports, and (d) school reports. Psy-\nchological and presentence reports contained detailed information pertaining to several key areas:\npersonal, family, psychiatric, and criminal offending histories as well as the current offending\nbehaviors and risk management issues. Prior to the study, the raters had completed a 3-day training\nby accredited trainers on administering YLS/CMI. They were also briefed on the procedures in\nreviewing and coding the case files.\nDisagreements in coding were resolved through discussions. Interrater reliability for YLS/CMI\nratings was assessed by the raters separately coding a random sample of 31 files. The intraclass cor-\nrelation coefficient (ICC) for single rater (using absolute agreement definition; ICC) was .63 (good)\nfor the YLS/CMI total score (see Cicchetti & Sparrow, 1981, for classification of ICCs). The ICCs\nfor the eight domains were .43 (fair) for prior or current offenses/dispositions, .50 (fair) for family\ncircumstances/parenting, .60 (good) for education/employment, .50 (fair) for peer relations, .49\n(fair) for substance abuse, .45 (fair) for leisure/recreation, .55 (fair) for personality/behavior, and\n.48 (fair) for attitudes/orientation.\nMeasures\nOffender group. Our study adopted Farrington's (1998) definition for violent acts, which is behavior\nintended to cause, or intended to and actually causes injury. Youth were categorized as nonviolent\noffenders if their index offenses comprised only offenses without the intent to cause injury, such as\ntheft, fraud, and drug use. Those who had committed violent offenses exclusively, such as physical\nassault, rioting, and robbery, were categorized as violent-only offenders. Violence against animals or\nproperty was not included (Farrington, 1998). None of the youth were convicted of family violence.\nThose who had committed both violent and nonviolent offenses were categorized as violent-plus\noffenders.\nRisk and criminogenic needs. The localized version of YLS/CMI 2.0 was used to code for YLS/CMI\ntotal risk scores, which is the risk of reoffending and the eight criminogenic needs (prior or current\noffenses/dispositions, family circumstances/parenting, education/employment, peer relations, sub-\nstance abuse, leisure/recreation, personality/behavior, and attitudes/orientation). A total of 42\nitems on the domains prior or current offenses/dispositions (e.g., ``three or more prior convictions''),\nfamily circumstances/parenting (e.g., ``inadequate supervision''), education/employment (e.g., ``low\nachievement''), peer relations (e.g., ``some delinquent friends''), substance abuse (e.g., ``chronic\ndrug use''), leisure/recreation (e.g., ``could make better use of time''), personality/behavior (e.g.,\n``physically aggressive''), and attitudes/orientation (e.g., ``antisocial/procriminal attitudes'') were\nrated as either yes or no. The total number of endorsed items on each domain reflects the level of\ndomain-specific criminogenic needs. The YLS/CMI total risk scores were computed by summing\nup the domain scores. Previous meta-analyses showed that the YLS/CMI assessment ratings had\nmodest to moderate predictive validity (see Olver, Stockdale, & Wormith, 2009; Schwalbe, 2007,\nfor reviews). It also had moderate predictive validity for use in the Singaporean context (Chu\net al., 2015). There have been fewer studies on the reliability of YLS/CMI, but there is evidence\nof fair to excellent interrater reliability of the domain scores and total score (Rocque & Plummer-\nNoncriminogenic needs. The YLS/CMI assessment also has a 51-item section that assesses the presence\nof noncriminogenic needs for individualized intervention (Andrews et al., 1990); items are rated as\n``yes'' or ``no.'' Only the following items were coded as the required information was consistently col-\nlected and recorded in the reports: chronic history of offenses, financial/accommodation problems,\nhistory of bullying, history of running away, history of sexual/physical assault, peers outside age\nrange, poor problem solving skills, poor social skills, underachievement, and gang membership.\nAge at first charge. Age of the youth at first charge was derived using birth date and date of the first\ncourt charge.\nRecidivistic outcomes. Recidivism data were obtained only after the completion of coding of all the\nother variables. The cutoff date for recidivism was April 20, 2011. The youth was considered to have\ngeneral recidivism, if there had been either a conviction of any offense, violent, sexual, nonviolent,\nor other types of offenses, following the initial court order, or a breach of court orders. Violent reci-\ndivism (e.g., physical assault, rioting, and robbery), nonviolent recidivism (e.g., theft, fraud, and drug\nuse), and sexual recidivism (e.g., indecent exposure, molestation, and peeping) were also measured.\nStatistical Analyses\nAll analyses were conducted using SPSS version 19.0. Comparisons were made between violent-\nonly and violent-plus groups and the reference group, nonviolent. Comparisons were also made\nbetween violent-only and violent-plus groups. Continuous dependent variables were analyzed using\nMANOVA, followed by univariate tests with adjustment of Type I error using Benjamini and Hoch-\nberg's procedure (1995). This procedure of adjustment for false discovery rate (FDR) is more pow-\nerful than adjustment for familywise error rates. Following significant univariate tests, post hoc\ncomparisons were conducted using Hochberg's GT2 to control for Type I error (Field, 2013). Cate-\ngorical dependent variables were analyzed using w2, likewise with the control of FDR.\nTo analyze whether group membership predicted differences in general recidivism, and specific\ntypes of recidivism, Cox regressions were conducted, which can account for differences in follow-up\nperiod for recidivism among the youth.\nResults\nDescriptives\nTable 1 details the breakdown of the nonviolent, violent-only, and violent-plus groups by sex, ethni-\ncity, current offense(s), and recidivism. The nonviolent group committed 2.84 offenses on average,\nwhile the violent-only group committed 1.54 violent offenses on average; the violent-plus group com-\nmitted 2.74 nonviolent offenses on average and 1.62 violent offenses on average. The mean follow-up\nGroup Differences in Risk and Criminogenic Needs\nTable 2 displays the means and standard deviations of the nonviolent, violent-only, and violent-plus\ngroups on the YLS/CMI.

Violent-plus youth were also more likely to be involved in\ngangs than their nonviolent counterparts. These findings are in line with literature showing differ-\nences in the risk factors for violent youth vis-a\n`-vis nonviolent youth and associations between risk\nfactors and violence (Baglivio et al., 2014; Mulder et al., 2012; Valois, MacDonald, Bretous,\nFischer, & Drane, 2002; Zhou et al., 2014). The findings on total risk scores and recidivistic out-\ncomes also parallel findings of higher risk scores and reoffending behavior in previous studies\nLikewise, violent-only and nonviolent youth had differing risk and needs, and risk of nonviolent\nrecidivism, though there were fewer number of differences compared to the comparisons of violent-\nplus and nonviolent youth. The consistent differences between the nonviolent youth and the two var-\niants of violent youth on a number of profile characteristics suggest that it is valid to distinguish\nyouth offenders on the basis of whether they offended violently. The findings offer additional evi-\ndence for violent offender types (Loeber & Farrington, 1998; Loeber & Stouthamer-Loeber, 1998)\nand the premise that offenders are heterogeneous (Clements, 1996; Moffitt, 1993) in a culturally dis-\ntinctive, non-Western youth offender sample. Beyond profile differences, the findings also imply\nthat the level of effective dosage and the appropriate targets of intervention vary between violent\nand nonviolent youth offenders. For example, in line with the risk principle of RNR (Andrews\net al., 1990), the intensity of intervention to reduce reoffending among violent-plus youth should\nbe higher relative to that needed for nonviolent youth. According to the need principle, intervention\nto address pertinent criminogenic needs should reduce negative peer influence for violent-only\nyouth but not for nonviolent youth.\nSubtypes of Violent Youth Offenders\nThere is preliminary evidence for subtypes of violent youth offenders. The pattern of differences in\nthe comparisons between violent-only and nonviolent youth and between violent-plus and nonvio-\nlent youth was largely dissimilar. The only parallels were higher needs on the peer relations and per-\nsonality/behavior domains and higher likelihood of being involved in gangs, having poor problem-\nsolving skills, and history of sexual/physical assault.\nTable 6. Prediction of Recidivism Type from Groups (Cox Regression).\nRecidivism Type B SE Wald df p HR 95% CI\nMore importantly, differences were found in the direct comparisons between the violent-plus and\nthe violent-only groups. Violent-plus youth had higher total risk scores and criminogenic needs on\nfive domains and were at higher risk of general, violent, and nonviolent reoffending. No differences\nwere observed for sexual reoffending (like what was found for comparisons between these two\ngroups and nonviolent youth), which is not surprising, given the overall low base rate of sexual reof-\nfending in this sample. Furthermore, low rates of sexual reoffending have been found among Sin-\ngaporean youth offenders, even for youth who have sexually offended (Zeng, Chu, & Lee, 2015).\nViolent-plus youth were also more likely to have history of delinquent behavior (i.e., running away),\nhistory of aggression (i.e., bullying), and be involved in gangs. These findings are significant\nbecause (i) it confirms the typology literature on violent subtypes (Loeber & Stouthamer-Loeber,\nspecialization in violent offending behavior (Besemer, 2012; Osgood & Schrek, 2007; Thomas,\n2013). It is also interesting that profile differences in line with what past studies have found between\ngroups constructed from delinquent records accumulated over a duration of delinquent careers\n(Smart et al., 2003; Vaughn et al., 2014) were observed between groups comprising mostly of\nfirst-time offenders. This raises the possibility that specialized violent offenders and versatile violent\noffenders may be identified as early as at the point of their first convictions.\nOverall, violent-plus youth, or the criminally versatile, appear to be the most high-risk offender\ntype among the three groups. In addition, the observation of lowest age at first charge among ver-\nsatile violent youth suggests that they would be at risk of persistent future offending (Gann, Sullivan,\n& Ilchi, 2015), though it is noted that the age differences between them and the other two groups\nwere very small. Findings imply that rehabilitation for versatile violent youth needs to be adminis-\ntered at a high intensity and also incorporate program that break the cycle of continuous offending.\nStrengths and Limitations\nThe present study has a number of strengths and limitations. Strengths include a large, representative\nyouth offender sample across several cohorts, a non-Western sample, the inclusion of breach during\ncourt orders in the measure of recidivism to minimize underestimation of reoffending among those\nwho were on custodial orders, and the use of time to recidivism, a more sensitive measure of reci-\ndivism than other measures (Maltz, 1984).\nThe use of a large number of coders to conduct coding may have affected the effect sizes and\nICCs. Using Cohen's guidelines (1988), the effect sizes ranged from small to moderate. The size\nof offender group differences on risk and criminogenic needs was either small or moderate, with\nr ranging from .06 to .36. The strength of associations between offender group and risk factors was\nsmall, with F ranging from .05 to .17. Although it was expedient to have many coders for such a\nlarge sample, it could have introduced more variance to the data. Likewise, the ICCs of YLS/CMI\ncould have been affected and were mostly fair according to Cicchetti and Sparrow's guidelines\nSince this was a retrospective study conducted after youth offenders have exited the justice sys-\ntem, there was no information on self-reported offending behavior. Therefore, time to recidivism\ncould not account for instances of reoffending which had gone undetected by authorities. In addition,\nwithout data on self-reported offending prior to the current offense, the frequency of offending could\nnot be reliably measured among these first-time entrants to the justice system and controlled for\n(e.g., Piquero, 2000). Farrington, Snyder, and Finnegan (1988) had cautioned that ``despite problems\nof concealment and forgetting, self-reports may be more useful than official records in studies of\nspecialization based on numbers of different types of offenses committed during offending careers''\nAnother limitation of the study is that the majority of the sample comprised male youth offenders.\nCaution should be exercised in generalizing the findings to female youth offenders, given that there\nare gender differences in aggression, the development of aggression (Loeber & Stouthamer-Loeber,\n1998), and risk factors for aggression (Penney, Lee, & Moretti, 2010; Stephenson, Woodhams, &\nCooke, 2014; Valois et al., 2002). It would be useful for future studies to examine violent offender\ntypology among female youth offenders.\n"
