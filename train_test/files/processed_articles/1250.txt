We examined the associations between academic performance\n(AP), cognitive functioning (CF), and increased BMI in a nationally representative sample of children.\nMethods and Procedures: Participants were 2,519 children aged 8\u00ad16 years, who completed a brief\nneuropsychological battery and measures of height and weight as a part of the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey, a cross-sectional survey conducted between 1988 and 1994. Z-scores were calculated for each\nneuropsychological test, and poor performance was defined as z-score <2.\nResults: The association between BMI and AP was not significant after adjusting for parental/familial characteristics.\nHowever, the associations between CF remained significant after adjusting for parental/familial characteristic, sports\nparticipation, physical activity, hours spent watching TV, psychosocial development, blood pressure, and serum lipid\nprofile. Z-scores on block design (a measure of visuospatial organization and general mental ability) among overweight\nchildren and children at risk of overweight were below those of normal-weight children by 0.22 (s.e. = 0.16) and 0.10\n(s.e. = 0.10) unit, respectively (P for trend <0.05). The odds of poor performance on block design were 1.97 (95%\nnormal-weight peers.\nDiscussion: Increased body weight is independently associated with decreased visuospatial organization and\ngeneral mental ability among children.

The short- and long-\nterm associations between overweight and a range of adverse\nhealth-related outcomes are well established and raise the level\nof importancefor understanding overweight as a major public\nhealth concern for children and adolescents. Few studies have\nbeen specifically designed and conducted to examine the asso-\nciation between overweight and cognitive functioning (CF),\npossibly because of the general assumption that overweight or\nobesity per se is not a primary risk factor for poor cognitive\nperformance, but merely predisposes or exacerbates other risk\nfactors for cardiovascular diseases (2). Limited number of stud-\nies have provided some evidence that increased body weight\nstatus per se is associated with lowered CF in men (2,3). It is\nless clear whether these findingshold true for children because\nof inconsistent conclusion from previous studies. Li observed\nthat among Chinese elementary school children, severely obese\nchildren had significantly lower intelligence quotient than the\ncontrols (4). Mo-suwan et al. found that an association between\noverweight status and poor school performance existed among\nThai children from grades 7 to 9 but not 3 to 6 (ref. 5). However,\nDatar et al. concluded that among American kindergartners,\nsignificant differences in test scores by overweight status were\nexplained by parental education and home environment rather\nthan overweight status per se (6). These inconsistent findings\nmay be related to the biosocial complexities of childhood over-\nweight, academic performance (AP), and CF. Parental factors,\nsuch as the provision of a stimulating home environment, play\ncritical roles in the development of overweight, less satisfactory\n1Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, the Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, South Carolina, USA; 2Department of Medicine,\nVanderbilt Epidemiology Center, Institute for Medicine and Public Health, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville,\nTennessee, USA; 3Clinical Research Center for Excellence, VA Tennessee Valley Health Care System, Nashville, Tennessee, USA; 4Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and\nCritical Care Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA; 5Department of Psychiatry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA; 6Division of Health\nand Family Studies, Institute for Families in Society, University of South Carolina, South Carolina, USA.

Confounding effects may be part of\nthe association observed from some studies, whereas in other\nstudies, over-controlling for some factors, particularly physi-\ncal activity and television (TV) watching, for which obesity\nmay be as much a cause as a consequence, was also a \nconcern.\nGiven the limitations of previous studies, we undertook a\ncross-sectional analysis to examine the associations between\nAP, CF, and increased BMI while focusing on the mediating or\nconfounding effects of socioeconomic characteristics, physi-\ncal activity, TV viewing, and cardiovascular risk factors among\nschool-aged children enrolled in the Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).\nMethods And Procedures\nStudy population\nsurvey of the US noninstitutionalized civilians living in households.\nThe sampling scheme was a stratified, multistage probability design\nwith oversampling of African Americans and Mexican Americans\nto allow more precise estimates for these subpopulations. Detailed\ndescriptions of the survey have been published elsewhere (7).\nNHANES III included medical and cognitive examinations, and\ninterviews conducted with survey children and proxy respondents. A\ntest with reliable data collected and English as the test language. As\nthe primary goal of this study was to examine abnormally increased\nbody weight, we excluded 163 underweight children (BMI < 5 per-\ncentile). Forty-four children who were in the neonatal intensive care\nunit for >2 weeks and forty-one children in need of special educa-\ntion or suffering from a learning disability or health-related impair-\nment were also excluded. A large number of additional children were\nexcluded because of missing information pertaining to confounder\nor mediating factors, e.g., iron test, blood lead (n = 300), parental\nand familial socioeconomic status (SES, n = 264), physical activity\nand sports participation (n = 129), TV viewing hours (n = 22), tradi-\ntional cardiovascular disease risks (n = 412), and psychosocial status\n(n = 9). After exclusions, 2,519 children and adolescents remained\nfor primary analyses.\nMeasurements and variable definitions\nAP/CF. AP/CF was assessed using standardized neuropsychological\ntests conducted in the mobile examination center. Trained examiners\nadministered tests in a standardized environment using uniform pro-\ncedures. An automated data-recording system was used to improve\nadherence to the protocol, help assure accurate timing of the tasks,\nand streamline data collection. The examination consisted of a series\nof four tests, including the block-design and digit-span subtests of the\nWechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Revised (WISC-R), and the\nreading and arithmetic sections of the Wide Range Achievement Test,\nRevised (WRAT-R).\nOn the block-design test, the child replicates two-dimensional geo-\nmetric patterns using a set of three-dimensional cubes; this subtest is\na measure of nonverbal reasoning and visuospatial construction. The\ndigit-span test assesses attention and working memory by asking the child\nto repeat a series of increasingly long number of sequences forward and\nthen backward. The WRAT-R arithmetic test consists of oral and written\nproblems ranging from simple addition to calculus, whereas the read-\ning test assesses letter recognition and word-reading skills. The WISC-R\nblock-design and digit-span tests were age-standardized to a mean of 10\nwith a s.d. of 3 and WRAT-R arithmetic and reading scores were age-\nstandardized to a mean of 100, with an s.d. of 15 (ref. 7). For this study, a\nz-score was calculated for each test using the respective standard mean\nand s.d. Thus, for each individual test, a person scoring at the mean of the\nsample and another person scoring an s.d. above the mean would have\nz-scores of 0 and 1, respectively. In addition to the individual test score,\na global AP/CF indictor was created by summing the z-scores of the four\nAP/CF tests and divided by 4.\nOverweight and at risk of overweight. Body weight was determined\nthe nearest 0.1cm with standardized measuring equipment \n(Holtain\nHeight Stadiometer). BMI was calculated in kilogram per meter square\nand then converted to a sex- and age-specific BMI percentile value\nusing a computerized formula derived from the 2000 Centers for Dis-\nease Control Growth Charts (8). In accordance with recommendations\nof the expert panel on childhood obesity (9), we assigned each partici-\npant to an overweight BMI stratum (95th percentile), an at risk for\noverweight BMI stratum (85th to 94th percentile), or a normal BMI\nstratum (<85th percentile).\nPotential mediating/confounding factors. The NHANES III did not\ninclude measures of parental cognitive ability or the quality of the home\nenvironment. Consequently, we relied on ethnicity (non-Hispanic\nwhite, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American and other eth-\nnicities), education (<12 years, high school, college, or higher), marital\nstatus of the family head, family income, and dwelling condition as sur-\nrogates. The definitions of these indicators can be found in our previous\npublication (10). There is some evidence that watching TV is associated\nwith a greater likelihood of childhood overweight (11\u00ad15). Displace-\nment theory also suggests that as children spend more time watching\nTV, they spend lesstime participating in more \"valuable\" activities, such\nas reading and doing homework (16), resulting in adverse effects on AP\nand cognitive development. We therefore included a parent-reported\nmeasureof child's TV watching--assessing the total number of hours of\nTV watched the previous day. The children were also asked \"How many\ntimes per week do you play or exercise enough to make you sweat or\nbreathehard?\" These activities did not exclude school-related involve-\nments such as physical education. The children were classified as being\nphysically active mostdays of the week if children reported participat-\ning in physical activity at least five times per week as recommended\nby the SurgeonGeneral's Report on Physical Activity and Health (17).\nA question was also asked concerning the number of sport teams and\nexerciseprograms the children participated in within the past year, not\nincluding physical education or gym class. Those who reported playing\non one or more sport teams or exercise programs were classified as a\nparticipation group, otherwise as nonparticipation one.\nBlood pressure (BP) has been demonstrated to be linearly associated\nwith block-design scores and the comobility between high BP and over-\nweight is relatively high among children and adolescents (18,19). During\nthe examination conducted in mobile examination center, the physician\ntook three BP measurements after the child was quiet and undisturbed\nfor at least 5 min. The first and fifth Korotkoff sounds were measured\naccording to the standardized measurement protocols recommended by\nthe American Heart Association. The average of the second and third BP\nmeasurements was recorded as the final reading for each subject. Total\ncholesterol was measured enzymatically and serum triglyceride levels\nwere measured regardless of the examinee's fasting status. Iron deficiency\nhas been well known to be associated with poor CF, and high prevalence\nof iron deficiency was observed among overweight and obese children\nand adolescents (20,21). We used the definitions of iron deficiency pro-\nposed by Looker et al. based on laboratory tests of transferrin satura-\ntion, free erythrocyte protoporphytin, and serum ferritin (22). A child\nwas considered iron-deficient if any two of these three values of iron\nstatus were abnormal for age and gender. General health status of a child\nwas rated by parent or proxy as excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.\nA dichotomous variable was used to compare children in fair or poor\nhealth with children having excellent, very good, or good health. Anxiety\nis known to influence test performance and was measured by heart rate in\na previous study (18). During the NHANES, cognitive tests were admin-\nistered with a focus on decreasing subject anxiety. Nevertheless, it may\nbe that a difference in anxiety level between subjects with various BMI\narticles\n \ncontributed to the difference in test performances; therefore, we included\nthe heart rate as a potential confounder. This study also selected several\nindicators derived from parents' or proxy's rating to measure children's\nbehaviors and social skills: (i) whether the child had ever seen a mental\nhealth professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, or psychoanalyst) about\nany emotional, mental, or behavioral problems, (ii) whether the child had\never been suspended, excluded, or expelled from school, (iii) whether the\nchild was shy and slow to make new friends, and (iv) whether the child\nhad difficulties getting along with others.\nStatistical methods\nAs recommended by the National Center of Health Statistics, we used\nthe SUDAAN software (SAS-callable version, 8.0.2; Research Triangle\nInstitute, Research Triangle Park, NC) with appropriate weighting and\nnesting variables to produce accurate national estimates adjusting for\nthe oversampling of specific population groups. We used the linear\nregression model as primary adjustment tool to estimate the adjusted\nmean z-score on cognitive outcomes for each level of BMI; pairwise\ncomparisons were performed to assess the statistical difference of\nz-score between normal-weight children (referent group) and children\nat the risk of overweight, and overweight children. A critical two-sided\nP value of 0.05 was used to identify statically significant difference.\nTo assess the mediating/confounding effects from various factors on\nthe association between BMI with AP/CF, we conducted mediation\n\nanalyses according to the methods discussed by Baron andKenny (23)\nand Holmbeck (24). The difference of AP/CF test z-score between BMI\ncategory is reduced when mediating variable or confounder is included\nin the model than when not included.As the supplementary analyses,\nwe also repeated all the regressions described above on all subjects\n(N = 3,903) who had valid data of any AP/CF tests to examine potential\nbiases caused by exclusion of a large portion of the subjects due to vari-\nous reasons. The Bonferroni adjustment was not considered because\nof the exploratory nature of the study and creation of the indicator for\nglobal functioning.\nResults\nThe average age of the weighted population was ~12 years,\nwith subjects divided equally by gender for both included\nand excluded groups (Table 1).

A poverty index ratio <1.30, the federal cut-point for eligibility for\nthe Food Stamp Program, was classified as low. eThe z-score for global AP/CF was created by summing the unweighted z-scores of the four individual tests and divided\nby 4. fChildren who reported being active most days of the week were defined as children who reported participating in physical activity at least five times per week as\nrecommended by the Surgeon General's Report on Physical Activity and Health (17). gDetails of the definition of iron deficiency can be found in ref. 22. *P < 0.05, **P <\n0.01 (Cochran\u00adMantel\u00adHaenszel test for categorical variable and t-test for continuous variable).\narticles\n \nsizes associated with being overweight or at risk of overweight\non the test scores were relatively small. Among all estimates, the\nmaximum effect size was the age\u00adgender-adjusted difference of\nblock-design z-scores between normal-weight and overweight\nchildren, which was statistically significant but twice the s.e.\nonly. The effect size of overweight on block-design test was only\n0.22 (s.e. = 0.11) after adjustment for a comprehensive list of\nconfounding and mediating variables.\nWhen test z-scores were dichotomized and performance with\nscore below 2 was defined as \"poor,\" the proportions of poor per-\ntic, reading, block-design, and digit-span test, and 1.67 for global\nfunctioning (data not shown) among study population. Because\nof the reduced statistical power from dichotomizing continuous\nvariables, the logistic regression yielded a different picture to\nthat obtained from linear regressions using continuous z-score\nas the outcome variable. Among all AP/CF measures, only block\ndesign demonstrated a strong and significant association with\nbody weight status (Table 3). The proportion of poor performers\non this task was nearly doubled (odds ratio = 1.97) among chil-\ndren at risk of overweight and tripled (odds ratio = 2.80) among\nsignificantly from those excluded on most of the character-\nistics selected. Compared with participants included, those\nexcluded were more likely to be non-white and to have a low\nfamily SES. Excluded subjects had low z-scores on all cognitive\ntests, high rates of emotional or behavioral problems, and were\nmore likely to be rated by their parents as having poor health.\nidentified as overweight or at risk of overweight, significantly\nhigher than the corresponding proportion among the children\nexcluded. Finally, the proportion of children participating on\nsports teams or programs was also significantly higher among\nthe group of subjects included.\nEstimated from linear regressions (Table 2), the age\u00ad\ngender-\nadjusted trends of the association between BMI and all AP/CF\ntest were statistically significant, and z-scores of test decreased\nas the percentile of BMI increased. The trends of the associa-\ntion with AP were quickly diminishing where adjustments were\nmade for parental and familial SES. The trends for block-design,\ndigit-span tests and global functioning remained statistically\nsignificant even when the adjustments were further made for all\npotentialconfounding/mediatingvariables.Generally,theeffect\nTable 2 Adjusted mean difference (s.e.) of AP/CF test z-score from the hierarchy regression models: sample of 2,519 children\nAdjusted for\nNormal weight\nAt the risk of overweight\nOverweight\nArithmetic test\nReading test\nBlock-design test\nDigit-span test\nGlobal functioning\nAP/CF, academic performance and cognitive functioning; NHANES III, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; ref, reference; SES, socioeconomic\nstatus.\naIncluding age, gender, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black and Mexican American, and other ethnicities), family income (low, middle, and high) educa-\ntion attainment of family head (<12 years, high school, college, or higher), marital status of the family head (single, not), dwelling condition (1 person/room, <1), general\nhealth status (good, poor), iron deficiency (yes, no), physical activity level (physically active, and inactive), sports team/program participation (yes, no), systolic and diastolic\nblood pressure, pulse rate (beats/min), serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, history of school suspension (yes, no), seeking psychological supports (yes, no), number\nof good friends, whether feel shy when meeting others (yes, no). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 (for the contrast between normal-weight group and at risk of overweight group,\nnormal-weight group and overweight group).\narticles\n \nimpairment in visuospatial organization and general men-\ntal ability (as measured via block design) in a large sample of\nschool-age children. This association remained robust even\nafter adjusting for parental and familial SES and other poten-\ntial confounders such as sports participation, physical activity\nlevel, hours of TV watching, psychosocial development, BP,\nand serum lipid profile. There was a suggestion of a \"dose\u00ad\nresponse\" effect of body size on cognition functioning. When\ntest scores <2 s.d. from mean were defined as \"poor,\" the odds\nof poor performance in visuospatial organization and general\nmental ability were doubled and tripled, respectively among\noverweight children compared to their normal-weight peers.\nThese estimates were obtained after adjustment for all potential\nconfounding/mediating variables. Supplementary analyses on all\nsubjects (N = 3,903) who had valid data of any AP/CF showed\nthat the estimates remained unchanged and the associations\ndescribed above was not sensitive to exclusion of a large portion\nof the subjects due to the reasons previously described.\nDiscussion\nUsing a nationally representative sample, we documented an\nassociation between BMI percentile category and cognitive\nTable 3 Adjusted OR (95% CI) of poor performance in AP/CF tests: sample of 2,519 children aged 8\u00ad16 years, United States,\nAP/CF tests\nNormal weight\nAt risk of overweight\nOverweight\nArithmetic test\nReading test\nBlock-design test\nDigit span test\nGlobal functioning\nAP/CF, academic performance and cognitive functioning, CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio; NHANES III, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey;\nSES, socioeconomic status.\naPerformance with z-score <2 was defined as \"poor.\" bSee the footnote of Table 2 for the list of confounding/mediating variables.\narticles\n \nand stroke implicated in the cognitive decline associated with\nincreased body status, such as low-degree inflammation of blood\nvessels in the brain because obesity or overweight has been iden-\ntified as a proinflammatory state.\nOther mechanisms to explain the declined CF have been sug-\ngested, with recent attention being paid to impaired insulin recep-\ntor signaling, low levels of leptin in brain, and altered glucose\nmetabolism (30,31). Physiologically, hyperinsulinemia is linked\nto disturbances in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling that\naffect several brain regions, including those (e.g., frontal lobes,\nhippocampus) involved in planning and organizing, which are\nelements of the block-design task. It is unclear whether these\nmechanisms may apply to the associations we observed among\nchildren and adolescents overweight or at risk of overweight. It\nhas been reported, however, that even in the absence of diabetes\nmellitus, insulin resistance associated with accelerated \nage-related\ncognitivedecline(32\u00ad34).Anotherpotentialexplanationisrelated\nto the effects of sleep apnea. As is well known, increased BMI is\nrelated to an increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea in children\nand adolescents (35). As is true for adults, children with obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea have detectable cognitive deficits presumably due\nto hypoxemia in addition to the general effects of sleep disrup-\ntion (36\u00ad39). Some authors have speculated that psychosocial\nfactors within the family may play a role in both the origins of\nobesity and its cognitive consequences (40), and the learning dif-\nficulties and poor cognitive performance present in overweight\nchildren may reflect parental psychopathology or SES rather than\nproblems that resultfrom the child's increased weight status. This\nstudy demonstrated that controlling for parental SES diminished\nthe association between overweight and APs but such factors did\nnot account for poor performance in areas of visuospatial organi-\nzation and general mental ability.\nPerhaps the greatest limitation of this study was that due to\nits cross-sectional design, a causalrelationship between weight\nstatus and AP/CF couldnot be determined. Both weight status\nand AP/CF are strongly influenced by genetic factors, and any\nobserved covariation could have been due to the concomitant\nexpression of genotype without weight status and AP/CF being\ncausally related to one another. The samples of the study may\nrepresent only \"normal\" children, as \"abnormal\" children who\nhad been institutionalized or in special schools (classes) were\nexcluded. Therefore, the ability to identify a strong association\nmay have been constrained by not sampling those who were\nemotionally, cognitively, or behaviorally abnormal. Thanks to\ncomputer technology, the AP/CF tests can be administered in\na carefully controlled fashion with extremely accurate mea-\nsurement in NHANES III, making this study able to detect the\nsubtle effects of increased body size on important elements of\nneuropsychological functioning. Interpretation requires cau-\ntion at this point given the nature of the study design. Our\nfindings, however, trigger important questions--chief among\nthem being whether the associations observed in our sample\nduring childhood lead to larger deficits during adulthood or\nmake persons more vulnerable to biologic perturbation, and\nthus lead to decreased social functioning, and make difference\nto survival in later life? Seeking answers to these questions\nat risk and overweight children, compared to their normal-\nweight peers.\nIn this study, AP was assessed by WRAT-R, a brief and widely\nused instrument designed to measure basic school perfor-\nmances rather than comprehension, reasoning, and judgment\nprocesses. Both reading and arithmetic subtests reflect large\npart of the social, economic, and cultural knowledge and are\nstrongly influenced by the parental or familial SES characteris-\ntics. This might be the major reason that age\u00adgender-adjusted\neffect sizes of weight status were significant but adjustment for\nSES reduced these effect sizes substantially to a level without\nstatistical significance. Our observation is consistent with a\nprevious study which found that among American kindergart-\nners and first-grade students, overweightwas a marker for but\nnot a cause of poor AP and that worse AP can contribute to\nparent or family SES characteristics (6). It was found, however,\nthat lower educationalachievement among adults is associated\nwith obesity and obese adolescents consider themselves worse\nstudents (25). It is unknown whether the findings from adults\napply to children or in instances in which objective measures\nof school performance, as we did in this study, are used.\nThe finding that decreased CF was associated with increased\nweight status is consistent with studies demonstrating decre-\nments in memory, abstract reasoning, and attention in adults\nwith increased body weight. It has been observed that a signifi-\ncant portion of obese individuals between the ages of 20 and\n64 years reported \"some difficulty thinking\" (26). Cognitive defi-\ncits on tests of motor speed, diminished performance on tests of\nmotor speed and manual dexterity, and executive function have\nbeen identified among middle-aged and older obese adults (27).\nPoor performance on memory tasks is common among obese\nindividuals across the adult lifespan (28). Admittedly, part of the\nassociation observed among adults is explainable by a reverse\ncausation. Those with poorer cognitive ability to begin with\nmay both do worse in school and select a lifestyle (i.e., high TV\nwatching, poor dietary intake, low physical activity) that pro-\nmotes weight gain. This study, however, further demonstrated\nthat this association may exist among overweight children or\nchildren at risk of overweight without clinically diagnosed\ndiabetes mellitus or the multiple medical comorbidities such\nas vascular disease and cardiac disease that often characterize\nadult patients. The significant relationship with decreased block-\n\ndesign subtest captured in both linear and logistic regression was\nparticularly intriguing. Block design, a measure of visuospatial\norganization and general mental ability (29), has been shown\nto be sensitive to brain damage, particularly nondominant right\nhemisphere lesions with parietal lobe involvement. The impor-\ntance of these findings can be judged by noting that the adverse\neffects of increased body weight status on cognition functioning\nstart playing as early as in childhood. The general assumption\ndoes not hold true that increased body status is not a primary\nrisk factor for poor cognitive performance, but merely predis-\nposes or exacerbates other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\nCognitive decline may occur in younger persons without the\npathophysiological vascular changes typically associated with\naging.
