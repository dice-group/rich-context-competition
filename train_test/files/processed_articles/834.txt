    "abstract": "Abstract\nStudy objective--Relative risks are fre-\nquently assumed to be stable across popu-\nlations but this may not apply in\npsychiatric epidemiology where sociocul-\ntural context may modify them. Such eco-\nlogical eVect modification will give curved\nassociations between aggregated risk fac-\ntor and outcome. This was examined in\nconnection with the ecological association\nbetween suicide rates and an aggregate\nindex of religiosity.\nDesign--Ecological study of associations\nbetween suicide rates and an index of\nreligiosity, adjusted for socioeconomic\nvariation. The eVect of stratification of the\nstudy sample according to levels of religi-\nosity, was examined.\nSetting--26 European and American\ncountries.\npeope aggregated by country.\nOutcome measures--Age and sex specific\nMain result--Adjusted for socioeconomic\nvariation, negative associations of male\nsuicide rates with religiosity were appar-\nent in the 13 least religious countries only\np=0.026). Associations between religiosity\nand female suicide rates did not vary\nacross countries.\nConclusion--The bent ecological associ-\nation was apparent only after adjustment\nfor socioeconomic variation suggesting\nthat, rather than confounding, ecological\nmodification of individual level links be-\ntween religion and male (but not female)\nsuicide risk is the responsible mechanism.\nThis concurs with micro-level findings\nsuggesting that suicide acceptance de-\npends not only on personal but also on\ncontextual levels of religious belief, and\nthat men are more sensitive to this\nphenomenon than women. In psychiatric\nepidemiology, relative risks vary with the\nexposure's prevalence. This has important\nimplications for research and prevention.\nSuicide rate variations remain poorly under-\nstood. Given rising trends internationally that\nremain unexplained,1 the search for macro-\nlevel correlates of suicide remains as relevant as\nit was when Durkheim initiated it.2 Suicide rate\nvariations have been linked with local diVer-\nences in unemployment,3 4 divorce,3 5 income\nlevels,6 education,2 7 per capita alcohol intake,8\nbirth rates9 and, repeatedly, religious\noften contradictory.\nIn ecological research, the choice which\ncountries or communities to study is governed\nby data availability more often than by a priori\nhypotheses. Suicide rates of American states,10\nor Western European countries9 have all been\nstudied in connection with religion. One study\ncompared countries as diVerent in religious\ncontext as Israel and Japan.6 The statistics used\nin these studies give linear associations between\naggregate levels of risk or protective factors and\nsuicide rates, implying fixed regression coeY-\ncients across the exposure range.\nInferences made from ecological associa-\ntions may concern eVects on group rates, but\nmost often eVects on individual risk.14 Thus,\nnegative ecological associations between indi-\nces of religion and suicide rates are frequently\ntaken to imply that, therefore, religious people\nare at lower risk of suicide than non-religious\npeople. The slope of the regression line is, in\nsuch cases, used to calculate relative risks.15\nHowever, cross level bias frequently invalidates\nconclusions concerning individual risks drawn\nfrom ecological patterns.14 16 Even when eco-\nlogical confounding, the first source of cross\nlevel bias, is controlled for, the possibility\nremains that the religious composition of indi-\nviduals' countries modifies the risk they run\ngiven their personal levels of religiosity. It is\nwith this contextuality, ecological eVect\nmodification,14 that this study is concerned.\nEcological eVect modification implies, at the\nindividual level, that relative risks are not con-\nstant but variable according to the risk factor's\nprevalence. It has received little attention\npresumably because relative risks, whose use\noriginates in the epidemiology of chronic\nsomatic disorder, are often assumed to be\nstable across populations.17 However, relative\nrisks in social psychiatry are unlikely to be cul-\nture free. Churchgoing protects better against\ndepression in religious compared with non-\nreligious communities.18 Unemployment is a\nstronger risk factor for suicidal behaviour when\nit is rare.19 Positive life change predicts recovery\nfrom depression better in populations bereft of\nsuch events.20 Moreover, men may be more\nsensitive to such contextual eVects than\nwomen. In contrast with suicide rates of\nwomen, those of men depend strongly on social\nand economical change.21 Levels of suicide tol-\nerance in men, but not women, depend on\nbeliefs prevalent locally, as much as on their\npersonal convictions.22\nWhen present, a twofold ecological associ-\nation exists between exposure prevalence and\nDepartment of Social\nPsychiatry, University\nof Groningen, PO Box\nGroningen, the\nNetherlands\nJ Neeleman\nDivision of\nPsychological\nMedicine, University\nof Wales College of\nMedicine, CardiV\nG Lewis\nCorrespondence to:\nDr Neeleman.\nAccepted for publication\noutcome numbers. Firstly, as in any ecological\nstudy, relative numbers of risk free and at risk\npersons vary with changing exposure preva-\nlence. Secondly, rates of the outcome in these\ntwo groups will change when exposure preva-\nlences vary. This implies that regression coeY-\ncients for the association between exposure and\noutcome should diVer according to the preva-\nlence of the exposure giving a curved or bent\necological regression line. This has been shown\nto apply to the association between regional\nindices of religiousness and suicide rates in the\nAgainst this background this study's purpose\nwas to examine whether a bent regression line\nfits ecological associations of international sui-\ncide rates with indices of religion better than\nthe straight line usually drawn in comparable\nring when units of analysis diVer in more\naspects than the variable of interest only, may\nalso aVect the shape of the regression line and,\nwhen uncontrolled, increase or obscure curvi-\nlinearity because of ecological eVect\nmodification.16 Socioeconomic confounding\nwas therefore adjusted for before examination\nof the shape of the regression line.\nIt remains disputed which aspects, if any, of\nreligion are most relevant to health outcomes.\nSocial integration may be the principal media-\ntor of religion's beneficial eVects on health2 24\nbut personal religious commitment, irrespective\nof social integration, may also be relevant.6 22 25\nFrom data on religious aYliation, attendance,\neducation and personal devotion, available\nfrom a large scale international survey con-\nsuicide rates was selected for further study.\nThe issue at stake, the contextual variability\nof relative risks in psychiatric epidemiology, has\nwide relevance. The inability of ecological\nresearchers to agree on whether or not suicide\nrates are related to levels of, for instance,\nunemployment3 27 is likely to be simply because\nof the fact that such general questions cannot\nbe answered. When unemployment is rife, it\nwill be a weaker risk factor for suicidal\nbehaviour than when it is rare19--this will\nstrongly aVect ecological patterns. The topic is\nalso relevant for public health oYcials; reduc-\ntion of the prevalence of risk factors whose\nindividual level eVect is subject to ecological\neVect modification, may concentrate the risk in\nthe most vulnerable.28\nMethods\nSAMPLE\nCountries were selected if (a) they had a\nJudaeo-Christian tradition, (b) they reported,\nin 1990, suicide and population counts to the\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) using\nICD-9 codes, and (c) World Values Survey\n(WVS) data were available for them. WVS was\ncarried out by structured interview (375 items)\non random population samples (>18 years old)\nin 43 countries across the world26 to explore\nlinks between economic advance and\nindividualisation.29 Stratified random sampling\nwas used in most countries but in some, such as\nthe USA, minority groups were oversampled.\nSampling weights, allocated to all respondents,\nallowed restoration of national samples' repre-\nsentativeness for international comparisons.26\nTwenty seven countries met criteria (a) and (b)\nbut Finland was excluded as computerised\ninstead of face to face interviews were used\nthere.29 The 26 countries included in the\ngiven in the legend to table 2.\nReligious variables\nWVS contains items concerning religious aYli-\nupbringing (overall missing 195 of\n22 questions concerning personal beliefs and\npractices (for example, \"Do you find comfort\nand strength from religion\"). In Czechoslova-\nkia, five questions only of the 22 had been\nasked. Excluding Czechoslovakia (n=1396),\nmissing scores on nine (40%) or more of the 22\nitems with the highest missing rate in Poland\nents in Czechoslovakia (0.6%) had one or more\nmissing scores. The 22 items were subjected to\nprincipal component (PC) analysis applied to\nthe pooled dataset (weighted for sampling\ndiVerences) yielding a main PC (religiosity)\naccounting for 48.8% of total item variance.\nMissing scores were imputed using best subsets\nregression giving values for all but one respond-\nent. PC extractions of the 22 belief/practice\nitems (five in the case of Czechoslovakia) were\nalso run on national samples individually. The\ncorrelation between PCs based on these respec-\ncorrelation between the PC for Czechoslovakia\nbased on its five items and the PC obtained for\nthis country by imputation of values to the 17\nvidual countries, aggregate values for religious\naYliation and religious upbringing were ob-\ntained by calculation of proportions. Aggregate\nvalues for religiosity and church attendance\nwere obtained by calculation of national pro-\nportions of respondents scoring above the\nrespective median for the pooled sample.\nsuicide, and suicide combined with undeter-\nmined death, were calculated using data\nobtained from WHO.30 Spearman's rank order\ncorrelation between suicide and combined\nsuicide/undetermined death rates was 0.66\n(p<0.001). After exclusion of Chile, which uses\nthe undetermined death category idiosyn-\nthe large eVect of Chile's undetermined death\nrates, suicide rather than combined suicide/\nundetermined death rates were used further.\nPossible socioeconomic confounders\nNational birth rates,32 average income levels (in\neducation enrolment levels,32 divorce,26 and\nunemployment rates26 were obtained. For\nIceland and Eastern Germany, birth, GNP, and\nhigher education rates were unavailable.\nLeast squares regression of logarithmically\ntransformed male and female suicide rates was\nused. Independent aggregate variables were\nstandardised to the entire aggregated dataset so\nthat regression coeYcients represent change in\nthe outcome associated with one standard\ndeviation's shift on independent variables. The\neVect of weighting for WVS sample sizes (to\nreflect higher precision of measures aggregated\nfrom larger samples) was assessed.33 When\nmore than one rate per country was\nmodelled--that is, when age was considered as\na confounder (compare with age standardisa-\ntion), Huber's adjustment of standard devia-\ntions was made to account for national rate\nclustering.34 Missing scores of socioeconomic\nconfounders were imputed using best subsets\nregression34; the eVect of this was assessed by\ncomparing regression coeYcients before and\nafter imputation\nFirstly, crude associations were obtained by\nlinear regression of male and female suicide\nrates on the separate religious and socioeco-\nnomic variables. Secondly, from a multiple\nregression model for suicide rates containing\nall religious variables, the best performing\nassociation of suicide rates was selected for fur-\nther analysis. Thirdly, a regression was speci-\nfied for suicide rates with the five socioeco-\nnomic confounders only as covariates. Using\nthis model's coeYcients, a summary con-\nfounder index was calculated for each\ncountry.33 Fourthly, associations of suicide\nrates with the best performing religious vari-\nable were adjusted for confounding, by con-\ntrolling for the five separate socioeconomic\nvariables jointly, and by using the summary\nconfounder score instead. Finally, F tests for\ninteraction were used to assess whether asso-\nciations of suicide rates with the religious vari-\nable diVered between age groups and between\ncountries scoring above and below the median\nfor the religious variable.\nResults\nNegative associations were apparent between\nsuicide rates and all four religious variables,\nmost pronounced for religiosity and weakest\nfor attendance and stronger for women and the\nelderly than for men and the young. Religiosity\nwas selected for further analysis as this variable\nonly contributed significantly to sex specific\nmultiple regressions containing all religious\nvariables (table 1).\nTable 1 Crude ecological associations of the natural logarithm of sex and age specific suicide rates with religious and\nsocioeconomic variables in 26 countries, 1986\u00ad90; standardised regression adjusted for national clustering of rates (n=156)\nStandardised independent variables\nRegression coeYcient; p value\nInteraction with sex\nmale suicide ratesa female suicide ratesb\naOnly religiosity (-0.45 (-0.80 to -0.09); p=0.017) contributed to a multivariate model containing all religious variables.

Higher birth rates were associated\nwith lower suicide rates but more so for women\nthan men. Similarly, associations of suicide\nrates with the summary confounder index,\ncapturing information on all five confounders,\nwere stronger with female than male suicide\nrates. Size and statistical significance of these\nassociations were hardly aVected by missing\nvalue imputation or by weighting for WVS\nsample sizes (table 1).\nFull adjustment using the separate socioeco-\nnomic indices removed the association of\nreligiosity with male but not female suicide\nrates. For both sexes, the link between religios-\nity and suicide rates depended on age irrespec-\ntive of adjustment for socioeconomic con-\nfounding.

These were stronger for women and the\nelderly than for men and the young, and largely\nattributable to confounding by socioeconomic\nvariation. The complete removal of the overall\nassociation of male suicide rates with religiosity\nafter adjustment for confounding is probably\nattributable to the extent to which socioeco-\nnomic diVerences were controlled for, no\nprevious studies having adjusted for five diVer-\nent potential confounders simultaneously.\nDespite absence of an overall adjusted\nassociation between religiosity and male sui-\ncide rates, stratification of the sample accord-\ning to exposure levels revealed contrasting pat-\nterns in the two subsamples with negative\nassociations in the least and positive (although\nnot significantly so) ones in the more religious\nnations. Ecological eVect modification is the\nmost likely explanation for this but other possi-\nbilities need consideration. Ecological\nconfounding--that is, variation of suicide rates\nbetween countries for reasons unrelated to\nreligiosity--may also aVect the slope of the\nregression line. When confounding is present\nalongside eVect modification, the net eVect\nmay be to increase curvilinearity, or to decrease\nor even obscure it. However, the variation of\nregression coeYcients for male suicide is\nunlikely to be attributable to residual con-\nfounding for the following reasons. Adjustment\nwas not limited to one or two confounders but\nbased on five separate indicators obtained from\ndiVerent sources. Secondly, by using a multi-\nvariate summary confounder score the prob-\nlem of controlling for many confounders\nsimultaneously was alleviated and adjustment\ntherefore likely to have been more eYcient,\nespecially in the age stratified analyses based on\nsmall numbers of rates.33\nThe possibility also has to be considered that\n\"overadjustment\" may, artificially, introduce\ncurvilinearity. However, this is unlikely to\naccount for the curved shape of adjusted\nregression line for male suicide rates because\nanalyses using the summary confounder score\n(constraining the association between suicide\nrates and confounders to be on a straight line)\nwere similar to those using the separate\nconfounders. In ecological studies, lacking data\non individual exposure status, there can be no\ncomplete certainty about whether or not\nconfounding is adequately controlled for.\nSome may argue that other variables, such as\nalcohol consumption levels8 should have been\nincluded while others may consider it inappro-\npriate to adjust for variables such as divorce or\nbirth rates, which may be intermediaries\nbetween religion and suicide. Within the\nconstraints of these analytical imponderables,\nthe most convincing support for ecological\neVect modification as the responsible mech-\nanism for the curved regression line for male\nsuicide rates derives from its good fit with other\nevidence. A similar curvilinearity has been\ndemonstrated, independently, for the same\nassociation across Dutch provinces where\nsocioeconomic diVerences are small and un-\nlikely to aVect the slope of the regression line.23\nThe association between suicide acceptability\nand religiosity in men, but not women, is\nmodified by levels of religiosity in respondents'\ncountries providing direct evidence of eVect\nmodification taking place between the variable\nunder study here and an individual level proxy\nfor suicidal behaviour.22\nThis study certainly has limitations. The\noutcome variable, oYcially recorded suicide, is\nsubject to reporting biases that may relate with\nreligion's national dominance.35 However, this\ncannot account for the age and sex diVerences.\nFurthermore, its eVect would be expected to be\nmost pronounced in the most religious\ncountries--in contrast with the male pattern\nobserved. Extrapolation from WVS samples to\nentire nations depends on sampling methods\nand sample sizes. Despite its scale, care was\ntaken in WVS to ensure unbiased\nsampling29--the availability of individual sam-\npling scores enhanced the reliability of aggre-\ngate values. Weighting for sample sizes did not\naVect regression coeYcients supporting the\nreliability of the aggregate values. Further-\nmore, the ranking of countries according to\nreligious score is comparable to rankings pub-\nlished by others who used diVerent methods.36\nWhile the extent of missing values in WVS was\nsmall, proportions of missing socioeconomic\nscores were high for some countries whose\nsummary scores had to be imputed using non-\nmissing values. However, this hardly aVected\nregression coeYcients so that resulting bias is\nunlikely. To facilitate comparison of eVect size\nfor diVerent independent variables, these were\nstandardised. Although the use of standardised\nregression coeYcients has been criticised,37\ntheir use in the present analysis is valid as the\nstandard deviations used to obtain the stand-\nardised measures apply all to the same sample.\nMoreover, analytical decisions were based, not\non the size of regression coeYcients, but on\nmeasures of statistical significance that are\nunaVected by standardisation.\nx Ecological research that does not con-\nsider ecological eVect modification and\ncross cultural variation of relative risks,\nmay yield uninterpretable results.\nx The prevalence of religiosity modifies the\nstrength of its own ecological association\nwith male, but not female suicide rates\nacross 26 countries.\nx Especially where psychosocial variables\nare concerned, the exposure's prevalence\nis likely to aVect the slope of ecological\nregression lines.\nx At the micro-level, this may manifest itself\nas dependence of risk in exposed people\non the exposure's prevalence locally.\nx Relative risks in psychiatric epidemiology\nhave little meaning outside the study\ngroups in which they were originally\nfound to apply.\nWhen ecological confounding and eVect\nmodification are not present or controlled for,\nthe slope of the regression line is proportional\nto the relative risk or--in case of negative\nregression coeYcients--relative protection.15\nGiven the extent of control for socioeconomic\nconfounding and, for the male suicide rates,\nstratification of the sample by an ecological\neVect modifier, it can be argued that these con-\nditions are met so that, as indicated in figure 1,\ncomparable individual levels of religious belief\nare a protective factor against male suicide in\nless religious countries but not in more\nreligious ones. A variety of individual level\nmechanisms may underlie this type of eVect. At\nreducing prevalence of risk or protective\nfactors, psychological diVerences between the\nexposed minority and the non-exposed major-\nity are likely to be larger because of social\nselection. Minority groups may suVer margin-\nalisation while, conversely, increased levels of\nintragroup social support in small, close knit\ngroups may outweigh adverse eVects of re-\nduced integration in the majority.38 Individual\nlevel research indicates the likely relevance of\nthis type of contextual eVect for many psycho-\nFuture multi-level studies are needed,14 to con-\nfirm whether male and female suicide (or other\nill health) risks given certain degrees of\nexposure, relate diVerently to higher level char-\nacteristics such as peer group norms and com-\nmunity characteristics.40\nThis study generates interesting hypotheses\nand has theoretical implications for prevention\nand research in social psychiatry. Individual\nlevel inferences from ecological associations\nhave given ecological research a poor\nreputation.41 However, when macro-level con-\nsequences of ecological eVect modification are\nconsidered, patterns surface with potential\npublic health importance. The relative impact\nof reduction of risk, or increase of protective\nfactors, on suicide rates, will vary from\ncommunity to community. Reduction of risk\nfactor prevalence may lead to concentrating\nrisk in those, the most vulnerable, who are\nbeyond reach by such programmes. Relative\nrisks, lists of which tend to be published,42\nshould not be applied outside original study\npopulations and only be used cautiously to\nestimate the likely impact of risk factor reduc-\ntion on aggregate outcomes such as suicide\nrates.43 Ecological eVect modification is often\nconsidered as a methodological nuisance16 but\ndemonstration of its relevance for given risk\nfactors may guide individual level research to\nexplore sociocultural processes that may diVer\nbetween the sexes and modify eVects of\nexposure to risk.\nFunding: The Wellcome Trust.\nConflicts of interest: none\nThis work was done at the Department of Psychological Medi-\ncine, Institute of Psychiatry, London SE5 8AZ where JN was\nsupported by a Wellcome Training Fellowship in Epidemiology.\nThanks are due to the ESRC Data Archive, University of Essex,\nColchester, for providing access to the WVS data.\n1 LaVecchia C, Lucchini F, Levi F.
