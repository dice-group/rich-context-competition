Participants were assessed using the Community Attitudes Toward Sex Offender Scale\n(CATSO). Of the participants, 32.3% (n = 43) of the participants were female and 67.7% (n = 90) were male. Years\nof experience working directly with adolescent sexual offenders of participants ranged from 0 to 18 years (M = 2.48\nyears, SD = 3.48). The number of months participants received sexual offender training ranged from 0 to 60 (M = 3.44,\nSD = 9.48). No statistical differences in attitudes were found between females and males toward adolescent sexual offenders.\nNo statistically significant relationship was found between years of experience and the four factors on the CATSO survey\n(Social Isolation, Capacity to Change, Severity/Dangerousness, and Deviancy). A significant relationship was found between\nexperience and the Deviancy factor. No statistically significant relationship was found between months of training and\nattitudes. Overall, attitudes toward adolescent sexual offenders were positive.\n",

Inevitably, professional attitudes toward\nsexual offenders, and other deviant populations, affect social\nservice delivery and, in particular, the nature and the quality\nof services provided (Ward, Connolly, McCormack, &\n(1993), assessment of the professional's general attitude is\nnecessary to successful therapeutic intervention, as it is\nlikely to influence the client's response to change. It could\nalso be argued that professional attitudes toward sexual\noffenders significantly affect other services for victims of\nabuse and those associated with them, because such attitudes\ncan become part of the framework of expert knowledge\nResearch interest into professional attitudes and beliefs\ntoward sexual offenders, while developing in recent years,\nremains limited. Stermac and Segal's (1989) study into cog-\nnitive factors surrounding adult sexual contact with children\ngenerated considerable debate when it compared sex offender\nand professional attitudes in this area (Murphy, 1991; Ward\net al., 1996). The study, while largely focusing on sexual\noffender cognitions, also suggested that some clinicians\n(social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and nurses)\nmay view adult sexual contact with children to be a partial\nargued that if this finding is replicated, it raises serious con-\ncerns about the adequacy of education in the sexual abuse\narea. Hanson, Gizzarelli and Scott (1994) study of profes-\nsional reactions to child molesters' behaviors noted the need\nfor professionals to be aware of offenders' strategies for\nexternalizing blame and generating sympathy. According to\nWard et al. (1996), the failure to do so may result in inadver-\ntent collusion with offenders' cognitive distortions and inef-\nfective therapy.\nOther studies examining professional attitudes regarding\nchild sexual abuse have generally considered comparisons\nbetween professional groups within the practice field\npared attitudes toward child sexual abuse among social\nworkers and professionals within the judicial system.\nStatistically significant differences were found across the\ngroups. Social workers, the police, and district attorneys\nwere found to be strong advocates for victims, while public\ndefenders showed themselves to be strong advocates for\nalleged offenders, and judges held more neutral attitudes\nthan any other group. Saunders concluded that conflict\nremains between professionals on the most appropriate way\nto deal with sexual abuse cases.\nIn a similar study, Trute, Adkins, and MacDonald (1992)\nfound that there were significant differences in the attitudes\nof police in comparison to child welfare workers and com-\nmunity mental health personnel. Police officers did not think\nthat sexual abuse was as widespread or affected victims as\nseriously, and viewed sexual offenders as a more deviant\ngroup than did the child welfare personnel. The police offi-\ncers also viewed treatment as more ineffective in curtailing\nchild sexual abuse than other groups. Interestingly, these dif-\nferences were moderated by the gender of the various profes-\nsional groups. Women tended to view sexual abuse as more\npervasive, treatment as more effective, and sexual offenders\nas a heterogeneous group coming from all spheres of society\n(Trute et al., 1992). These findings raised the question of\nwhether gender is active in shaping professional belief sys-\ntems, or whether the professional role over time shapes per-\nceptions and beliefs of the workers involved (Ward et al.,\nhealth counselors between 10 and 30 years of experience\ncounseling sexual offenders were surveyed following pilot\ninterviews. Female counselors reported feelings of increased\nvulnerability, paranoia, and vigilance regarding male sexu-\nally aggressive behavior compared with male counselors.\nPolson and McCullom (1995) conducted a qualitative\nstudy with several counselors who specialized in the treat-\nment of sexual offenders. Counselors interviewed worked\nwith sexual offenders and victims of sexual abuse. Four gen-\neral themes describing counselor attitudes and behavior\nemerged from the interviews: (a) developing a positive view\nof perpetrators, (b) managing dysfunctional client behaviors\nand beliefs, (c) controlling personal reactivity, and (d) limita-\ntions of counseling. In developing a positive view, counsel-\nors described constructing cognitive frames that view sexual\noffenders as vulnerable, impaired, or human. It was also\nhelpful to view the offenders as victims, realize that their\nfamilies still loved them, defend their right to treatment, and\nview them as individuals with problems (Polson &\nMcCullom, 1995). Polson and McCullom's study confronted\nsexual offenders'victim blaming and prodded them to accept\nresponsibility for their actions. If the offender did not admit\nresponsibility, the counselors worked to control their own\nverbal or nonverbal expressions of disgust. They also coped\nby co-counseling in-group work and tried to be nonjudgmen-\ntal, control personal issues, and be appropriate role models.\nors enrolled in one of eight counselor education master's\ndegree programs. They found that sexually abused student\ncounselors desired to see physically abused offenders more\nthan they desired to see a non-abused offender. They con-\ncluded that counselors should understand how their own\nbackgrounds influence their desire to see sexual offenders\nand the possible effect on the counseling outcome.\nNelson et al. (2002) conducted a study investigating\ncounselors' attitudes toward sexual offenders. There were\n437 counselors participating in this study who were mem-\nbers of the Association for Mental Health Counselors and\nthe International Association of Addictions and Offenders\nCounselors. The participants completed the Attitudes\nToward Sex Offender Scale (ATS; Hogue, 1993) and pro-\nvided personal background information. The results from\nthis study indicated that counselors tended to have positive\nattitudes toward sexual offenders and that experience, prep-\naration from training, and victim status were related to these\npositive attitudes.\nMore recently, Ferguson and Ireland (2006) conducted a\ncomparison study, investigating the attitudes toward sexual\nsic staff). The participants were provided with vignettes\ndepicting specific sexual offenses and were asked to com-\nplete a scale assessing attitudes toward sexual offenders. The\nresults of the study indicated that forensic staff were more\nlikely than students to view sexual offenders in positive\nterms, viewing them as individuals who could be rehabili-\ntated. Participants who reported being victims of sexual\nabuse, or that someone close to them had been abused,\nviewed sexual offenders less negatively than nonvictims.\nMen demonstrated less positive attitudes toward child incest\nand child indecent assault offenders than to stranger rapists.\nWomen held more positive views toward sexual offenders\nthan men, and this was consistent across offense type.\nIn a recent study, Balow and Conley (2008) used the\nCommunity Attitudes Toward Sex Offender Scale (CATSO)\nto examine the attitudes of 307 professional correction work-\ners. The population sample for this study consisted of parole\nand probation officers, prerelease center workers, adminis-\ntrative staff, client advisors, licensed addiction counselors,\nand registered nurses and case managers. The results of the\nstudy yielded a representative portrayal of perceptions across\ndiverse concepts of relative sex offenders. While the partici-\npants in this study perceived the sex offender population to\nbe dangerous, they clearly agreed that offenders are amena-\nble to rehabilitation. Participants did not differ in their\nresponses regarding the severity of a sex crime based on\nwhether the perpetrator knew the victim and perceived that\nemotional control is not substantially different than physical\ncontrol. With regard to wearing tracking devices, most\nagreed that they should, but opinions on this item were not\nparticularly strong (Barlow & Conley, 2008). It was likely\nthat the real world logistics of this affected opinions. One\nlimitation of this study was the lack of demographic informa-\ntion of participants. For example, no differences could be\nmade regarding the differences in attitudes among male and\nfemales, types of correction professionals, experience, train-\ning, or within different parts of the region in which the study\nThe aforementioned studies focused on the attitudes\ncounseling professionals and students had toward adult sex-\nual offenders. However, no study to date known to the\nresearcher has specifically examined counseling profession-\nals/paraprofessionals' attitudes toward adolescent sexual\noffenders.\nLiterature Review\nAttitude of the Public\nLevey and Howells (1994) asserted that the formal and infor-\nmal sources of information such as schools, family, peers,\nand the media have a significant impact on attitudes toward\nsexual offenders. Early community notification strategies\ncommonly included press releases, flyers, and door-to-door\nwarnings about the presence of sex offenders (Levenson &\nfederally mandated to post their sex offender registries online,\nhowever, the Internet appears to have become the primary\nsource of information about convicted sex offenders (Smith,\nWampler & Reifman, 2005). The goals of sex offender regis-\ntration and notification are to increase the public's awareness\nof sex offenders and to help people protect themselves and\ntheir children from sex crimes (Proctor, Badzinski, &\nResearch on public attitudes suggests that students\n(Valliant et al., 1994), police officers (Weekes, Pelletier, &\nBeaudette, 1995), and prison officers, not involved in sexual\noffender care (Hogue, 1993), hold negative attitudes toward\nchild sexual offenders. Specifically, they are viewed as dan-\ngerous, harmful, violent, tense, bad, unpredictable, mysteri-\nous, unchangeable, aggressive, weak, irrational, afraid,\nmentally ill, and morally wrong (Valliant et al., 1994; Weekes\nA public opinion survey in Washington indicated that\ncommunity notification policies, commonly known as\nMegan's Law, and that 80% of that group believed that the\nlaw was very important (Hindman, 1997; Valliant et al.,\n1994). The majority reported that they felt safer knowing\nwhere convicted sex offenders lived and speculated that\ncommunity notification might help offenders better manage\ntheir behavior because neighbors were watching them.About\nhalf of the respondents acknowledged the potential for vigi-\nlantism and 75% agreed that notification might make it more\ndifficult for sex offenders to reintegrate into communities\nwith regard to housing, jobs, and social support (Valliant et\nal., 1994). Females were significantly more likely than males\nto be frightened or angry about sex offenders moving into the\nneighborhood. Age was also a significant factor in the level\nof fear reported, with 30- to 40-year-olds expressing more\nconcerns than those over 50 or under 30 (perhaps because\nthose in their thirties are more likely to have young children).\nInterestingly, however, more than half of the parents reported\nno change in their own behaviors with regard to supervision\nof their children as a result of community notification\nAccording to Cochrane and Kennedy (2010), the News of\nthe World surveyed a random sample of 558 young adults\nbetween the ages of 18 and 24. Respondents were\n4 SAGE Open\noverwhelmingly (86%) in favor of the public having access\nto information about registered sex offenders. More than half\n(57%) believed that the public has a right to know about all\nconvicted child molesters living in the local area, while 29%\nbelieved that the public should be told only about those\njudged to pose a risk to children. Only 16% of those sur-\nveyed believed that convicted child molesters could live\nsafely in a community without posing a threat to youngsters.\nDespite their support for community notification, only 11%\nindicated a belief that children are safer now than they were\n5 years ago, and 69% did not believe that enough was being\ndone to protect potential victims from sex offenders\nParents and concerned neighbors often describe the goal\nof community notification as \"providing as much informa-\ntion as possible to safeguard against any potential threats\nsome residents have reported that notification actually\nincreased their anxiety because information about offenders\nis not usually accompanied by information about protecting\noneself or one's children from assault (Caputo, 2001;\nTuscaloosa, Alabama, who had experienced sex offender\nnotification, found that females and parents of minor chil-\ndren were more likely than males and nonparents to feel that\ncommunity notification was important (Caputo, 2001).\nParents and women expressed more fear of crime, in general,\nand of sexual assault, specifically (Caputo 2001).\nIn 2005, after the widely publicized murder of 9-year-old\nJessica Lunsford by a convicted sex offender in Florida, the\nstate of Florida became the first to pass \"Jessica's Law,\"\nincreasing penalties for sex crimes against children and\nrequiring electronic monitoring for child molesters who are\nversion of \"Jessica's Law,\" often including mandatory mini-\nmum sentences, electronic monitoring, and residence restric-\ntions prohibiting sex offenders from living near schools,\nparks, playgrounds, bus stops, or other places where children\ncongregate (Caputo, 2001; Martin, Pescosolido, Olafsdottir,\n& McLeod, 2007). The San Francisco Chronicle reported\nthat 73% of voters supported Jessica's Law in California\nThough the public and lawmakers are supportive of sex\noffender policies, scholars remain skeptical about the poten-\ntial of these laws to protect children or prevent sex crimes\nHindman, 1997). They suggest that community notification\nlaws are driven by emotional responses to sexual violence\nrather than by empirical data and that they provide misguided\nreassurance to citizens. The majority (80%) of mental health\nprofessionals surveyed believed that registries would have\nno impact on reducing the incidence of child sexual abuse,\nand 70% thought community notification would foster a\nfalse sense of security for parents (Malesky & Keim, 2001).\nAnother oft-cited concern is the potential for notification to\ncreate unintended consequences that interfere with offender\nreintegration by limiting opportunities for housing, employ-\nment, and social support (Levenson & Cotter, 2005).\nLevenson and Cotter (2005) conducted a study on sex\noffenders living in Florida and Kentucky. From one third to\nhalf of the participants reported experiencing some type of\nadverse effect from registration laws such as loss of employ-\nment, loss of housing, harassment, threats, or property dam-\nage. Some participants reported that family members or\nroommates (19%) suffered from some type of physical\nassault.\nTewksbury and Lees (2007) surveyed registered sex\noffenders living on campus. Their findings showed that only\none third of the offenders knew that their university retained\na sex offender registry that listed their name. Some negative\nconsequences of the campus registry included difficulties in\nstudent housing, employment, maintaining social relation-\nships, harassment, and feelings of doubt and fear. The vast\nmajority (79%) of student sex offenders were denied employ-\nment. Half of the offenders were treated rudely by the public\nand experienced losing a friend after they learned of their\nstatus as a registered sex offender, and 15.8% lost a signifi-\ncant other. Approximately 5.3% of offenders were assaulted\non and off campus. Student offenders (15.3%) reported\nreceiving harassing mail or phone calls. Just under a half\n(47.4%) reported being evicted or being denied campus\nhousing. Only 26.3% admitted a decline in their academic\nO'Keefe and Reid-Nash (1987) argued that the more a\nperson pays attention to crime in the media, the more his or\nher fear and concern increases, thereby making him or her\nmore attentive to the issue. A study conducted by Proctor and\ncolleagues (2002) on media and Megan's Law demonstrated\nthis phenomenon. Their findings showed a pattern in how the\nmedia portrays Megan's Law and how it affected public per-\nceptions. The results indicated that exposure to all types of\nmedia and the positive attention given to Megan's Law were\nstrongly connected to the participant's knowledge and accep-\ntance of the law. Their results revealed that participants who\npay attention to crime and the media were more likely to\nsupport criminal justice policies, and, in this particular study,\nthe participants were highly supportive of Megan's Law.\nProctor and Colleagues (2002) similarly found that\nMassachusetts's community notification law increased the\nlevel of specific knowledge concerning the issues of Megan's\nLaw but did not improve the general knowledge of the law.\nFindings suggested that news media reinforces the public's\nperception of Megan's Law and their positive belief that it\ndeters victimization. The media coverage also appeared to\nsway the public to ignore the shortcomings of the law such as\nits inability to reduce sex offenses and loss of support for\ndeveloping more effective ways to rehabilitate sex offenders\nAttitude of Counselors\nIn recent years, there has been a limited amount of research\ninto the attitudes of mental health counselors toward sexual\noffenders. Clinicians and researchers have noted the impor-\ntant role of maladaptive attitudes and distorted thinking in\nfacilitating or justifying sexual offenses (Abel et al., 1984;\nStermac & Segal, 1989). These attitudes and cognitive dis-\ntortions function to avoid negative self-evaluation and social\ndisapproval, and facilitate the disengagement of the offend-\ner's inhibitions regarding sexual offending (Stermac &\ntudes toward sexual offenders, and other deviant popula-\ntions, affect social service delivery and, in particular, the\nnature and the quality of services provided (Ward et al.,\nment of the professional's general attitude is necessary to\nsuccessful therapeutic intervention, as it is likely to influence\nthe client's response to change. It could also be argued that\nprofessional attitudes toward sexual offenders significantly\naffect other services for victims of abuse and those associ-\nated with them, because such attitudes can become part of\nthe framework of expert knowledge (Ward et al., 1995; Ward\nThe possibility that abuse supportive attitudes may be cul-\nturally reinforced is an additional reason for investigating\ncounselor attitudes toward sexual offenders. Mental health\ncounselors are also subject to social stereotypes and inap-\npropriate cultural messages about sex and violence (Ward\nas a pseudosexual act that is primarily motivated by male\nsociopolitical dominance (Burt, 1980; Donat & D'Emilio,\nfeminist movement, at least in part, because this form of vio-\nlence toward women was seen as a means of enforcing pre-\ncisely the gender roles that women were attempting to change\nthe fear of rape serves as a mechanism of social control\nhad a significant impact not only on etiological theories by\nchallenging the uncontrollable sex urge notion but also on\nthe way in which sexual assault has been defined, the way in\nwhich rape victims are perceived and treated, and finally in\nidentifying aspects of the culture that are rape-supportive\n(1980) feminist theory of rape described how culturally\nderived attitudes might facilitate sexual aggression. Burt\nsuggested that sex role, stereotypical beliefs, adversarial sex-\nual beliefs, and acceptance of interpersonal violence were\ncritical factors in mediating the link between culture and\nsexual aggression.\nResearch interest into professional attitudes and beliefs\ntoward sex offenders, while developing in recent years,\nremains limited. Stermac and Segal's (1989) study\ninto cognitive factors surrounding adult sexual contact with\nchildren generated considerable debate when it compared\nsex offender and professional cognitions in this area (Murphy,\nsexual offender cognitions, also suggested that some clini-\ncians (social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and\nnurses) may view adult sexual contact with children to be of\npartial benefit to the child. Murphy (1991) argued that if this\nfinding is replicated, it raises serious concerns about the ade-\nquacy of education in the sexual abuse area. Hanson and\nSlater (1993) in their study of professional reactions to child\nmolesters' behaviors pointed to the need for professionals to\nbe aware of offenders' strategies for externalizing blame and\ngenerating sympathy. According to Ward et al. (1996), the\nfailure to do so may result in inadvertent collusion with\noffenders' cognitive distortions and ineffective therapy.\nOther studies examining professional attitudes regarding\nchild sexual abuse have generally considered comparisons\nbetween professional groups within the practice field\npared attitudes toward child sexual abuse among social\nworkers and professionals within the judicial system.\nStatistically significant differences were found across the\ngroups. Social workers, the police, and district attorneys\nwere found to be strong advocates for victims, while public\ndefenders showed themselves to be strong advocates for\nalleged offenders, and judges held more neutral attitudes\nthan any other group. Saunders concluded that conflict\nremains between professionals on the most appropriate way\nto deal with sexual abuse cases.\nIn a similar study, Trute et al. (1992) found that there were\nsignificant differences in the attitudes of police in compari-\nson with child welfare workers and community mental health\npersonnel. Police officers did not think that sexual abuse was\nas widespread or affected victims as seriously, and viewed\nsexual offenders as a more deviant group than did the child\nwelfare personnel. The police officers also viewed treatment\nas more ineffective in curtailing child sexual abuse than\nother groups. Interestingly, these differences were moderated\nby the gender of the various professional groups. Women\ntended to view sexual abuse as more pervasive, treatment as\nmore effective, and sexual offenders as a heterogeneous\ngroup coming from all spheres of society (Trute et al., 1992).\nThese findings raised the interesting question of whether\ngender is active in shaping professional belief systems, or\nwhether the professional role over time shapes perceptions\nand beliefs of the workers involved (Ward et al., 1995; Ward\nPolson and McCullom (1995) conducted a qualitative\nstudy with several counselors specializing in the treatment of\nsexual offenders. All the counselors interviewed worked\nwith sex offenders and victims of sexual abuse. Four general\nthemes describing counselor attitudes and behavior emerged\nfrom the interviews: developing a positive view of perpetra-\ntors, managing dysfunctional client behaviors and beliefs,\n6 SAGE Open\ncontrolling personal reactivity, and limitations of counseling.\nIn developing a positive view, counselors described con-\nstructing cognitive frames that view the sex offender as vul-\nnerable, impaired, or human. It was also helpful to view the\noffenders as victims, realize that their families still loved\nthem, defend their right to treatment, and view them as indi-\nviduals with problems (Polson & McCullom, 1995).\nCarone and LaFleur (2000) conducted an experimental\nanalogue study with 236 counselors-in-training who were\nenrolled in one of eight counselor education master's degree\nprograms located in two Mid-Atlantic States. The student\ncounselors were asked to respond to demographic questions\nand were administered the Counselor Response Form (CRF)\nto determine the counselors' judgment of adolescent sexual\noffender clients. The counselors were also given one of three\ncase histories presenting different client personal abuse his-\ntories and instructed to respond to the CRF after reading the\ncase history. For each case history, the sexual offender per-\nformed vaginal intercourse with a 10-year-old girl on two\nThe results of this study revealed that counseling students\nhad a greater desire to work with a sexually abused adolescent\nsexual offender than with an adolescent sexual offender who\nwas not abused. The results might be attributed to the idea\nthat sexually abused offenders have learned offending behav-\niors. The counseling students may have perceived the sexu-\nally abused offender as a victim of abuse that caused him or\nher to learn the sexually offending behavior. Non-abused\noffenders may be less desirable to work with because a poten-\ntial rationale for their behavior cannot be determined. In addi-\ntion, non-abused offenders may be perceived by counselors as\nvictims of medical or biological problems who may be per-\nceived by counseling professionals who could provide more\nmedically based types of treatment (Carone & LaFleur, 2000).\nAccording to Borgers, Thomas, and Van Loon (1980),\ncounselor judgments affect the counseling relationship, and\nthe counselor's desire to work with certain clients is a judg-\nment that cannot be overlooked. As the need for juvenile\noffender counselors grows with the increasing rate of reported\nsexual offenses (Steen & Monnette, 1989), counselors will\nneed to explore their judgments about working with offender\nclients to make informed decisions about their clients (Carone\nBecause counseling students desired to see the sexually\nor physically abused adolescent sexual offenders more than\nthey desired to see the non-abused offenders, the develop-\nment of counseling relationships between counselors and\nnon-abused offenders may be affected (Graham, 1980;\nof counselor desire to see a client affect the counselor's\nprognosis of client treatment and the counselor's predicted\nlength of time the client will need counseling. Consequently,\ncounselors should consider how the characteristics of non-\nabused adolescent sexual offenders affect the counseling\nrelationship.\npleted survey packets containing the Attitudes toward Sex\nOffenders Scale (ATS) and personal background questions.\nThe findings of the study indicated that counselors tend to\nhave slightly positive attitudes toward sexual offenders and,\nin addition, that experience, preparation from training, and\nvictim status are related to positive attitudes toward sexual\noffenders. No relationship was found between counselor atti-\ntudes and sex, employment, parental status, or education.\nOne reason for the positive attitude of counselors, as con-\ntrasted with the negative attitude that prevails among the\ngeneral public, may be related to the professional field.\nCounselors typically are screened before entering into coun-\nselor education programs. They are then trained throughout\ntheir degree programs to be nonjudgmental, respectful, and\nto believe in client change. In counseling education pro-\ngrams, the majority of beginning counselors have been\nexposed to and trained in Rogers's person-centered counsel-\ning approach, which requires unconditional positive regard\nfor clients. Thus, it would be expected that counselors would\nbe less judgmental than the general public (Nelson, 2007;\nAccording to Scaletta (1995), another explanation is that\nthe counseling field is growing and counselors are being\nplaced in a wide range of professional settings. Therefore,\ncounselors may be open to providing services to chronic or\ndifficult clients such as sexual offenders. They may be confi-\ndent that sexual offenders will receive medical or punitive\ninterventions as needed.\nprobation, parole, and community correction workers.

The find-\nings in this study yielded a representative portrayal of per-\nceptions across diverse concepts relative to sex offenders.\nWhile respondents perceived that the sex offender popula-\ntion is dangerous, they clearly agreed that offenders are ame-\nnable to rehabilitation. They did not differentiate between the\nseverities of a sex crime based on whether the perpetrator\nknew the victim and perceived that emotional control was\nnot substantially different than physical control. With regard\nto offenders wearing tracking devices, most agreed that they\nshould, but opinions on this item were not particularly strong.\nIt is likely that the real world logistics of this affected opin-\nions.

These factors include Social Isolation, Capacity to\nChange,Severity/Dangerousness,andDeviancy.Confirmatory\nfactor analysis was used to test it and the 18-item instrument\nwas superior to the 30-item, original instrument. Results sug-\ngest that the 18-item, four construct model was superior,\np < .05. Cronbach's alpha was also used to determine internal\nconsistency of the constructs. Results from the analysis indi-\ncatedsufficient reliabilitywheretotal CATSO = .74.Reliability\ncoefficients greater than .70 suggest internal consistency\nData Analysis\nThe data was analyzed using two statistical techniques, the\nPearson product-moment correlation and analysis of vari-\nance (ANOVA). Mean scores were calculated to create vari-\nables to represent the four CATSO factors, Social Isolation,\nCapacity to Change, Severity/Dangerousness, and Deviancy.\nThe mean scores were generated based on the factors and\ntheir corresponding items illustrated in Table 3. Once the val-\nues were generated for the four factor variables, descriptive\nstatistics were run to determine whether there were differ-\nences in measures of experience, training, and gender. Means\nwere then generated with experience, training, and gender\nrepresenting the independent variables, and the four factor\nvariables of the CATSO representing the dependent vari-\nables. The Pearson product-moment correlation was used to\ndetermine the extent to which the demographic variables,\nlength of experience, and amount of training affected the par-\nticipants' attitudes toward adolescent sexual offenders. A\none-way ANOVA test was conducted to determine whether\nfemales and males differed in their attitudes toward adoles-\ncent sexual offenders.\nResults\nA total of 133 participants were included in the analysis.

The results of the analysis indicated\nthat there were no statistically significant correlations\nbetween length of experience working with adolescent sex-\nual offenders, months of training, and gender with overall\nattitudes toward adolescent sexual offenders. However, a\nsignificant relationship was found between the length of\nexperience and the Deviancy factor on the CATSO survey.\nNo significant differences in attitudes between females and\nmales toward adolescent sexual offenders were found based\non the mean scores.\nEffects of Experience, Training, and Gender\nExperience.No significant correlation was found between\nlength of experience working with adolescent sexual offend-\ners and participant attitudes. The findings of this study are\nnot consistent with previous studies that have found years of\nexperience working with sexual offenders as a contributory\nfactor in the development of attitudes (Carone & LaFleur,\net al. (2002) found a significant positive relationship between\nattitudes toward sex offenders and experience counseling sex\noffenders using a sample of professional counselors in a psy-\nchiatric setting.\nSanghara and Wilson (2006) found that experienced cor-\nrectional professionals compared with inexperienced correc-\ntional professionals endorsed fewer stereotypes regarding\nsexual offenders. The experienced group obtained signifi-\ncantly higher scores on the ATS than the inexperienced\ngroup, indicating that they held more positive attitudes\nThere are no current studies known to the researcher, exam-\nining the relationship between counselors' experiences and\nattitudes toward sexual offenders.\nRegardless of the counseling professionals'/paraprofes-\nsionals' length of experience in this study, their attitudes\ntoward adolescent sexual offenders were positive as indi-\ncated by a mean score of 2.48, with a range of scores\nbetween 1 and 6. Positive attitudes toward sexual offenders\nregardless of experience might be attributed to the fact that\nparticipants were asked to provide their opinions about\nadolescent rather than adult sexual offenders. Because ado-\nlescents are developmentally different than adults regard-\ning their moral, social, and cognitive development (Billick\nNicol, 2007), adolescent sexual offenders might be viewed\nmore positively than adult sexual offenders despite the\nlength of experience in this study.\nA positive relationship between experience and the\nDeviancy factor on the CATSO was found. Deviancy refers\nto atypical sexual behaviors generally defined in moral,\nlegal, or medical terms, such as rape, incest, pedophilia, pub-\nlic masturbation, and so on (Church et al., 2008; Hogue,\n2003). Perhaps, the more experience the counseling profes-\nsionals/paraprofessionals had working with adolescent sex-\nual offenders the more they witnessed varied sexual\nbehaviors. It might be safe to conclude that counseling pro-\nfessionals/paraprofessionals witness varied sexual behavior\npatterns while working with adolescent sexual offenders.\nThis finding suggests that with experience, participants wit-\nness an array of sexual behaviors that might be defined as\ndeviant. For instance, Rasmussen, McAnulty, and Mangum\n(2001) asserted that sexual offenders often act out sexually\n(i.e., masturbate, engage in uninhibited sexual fantasies, etc.)\nin an attempt to resist treatment. Sexual offenders also dis-\nplay sexually deviant behavior when they believe that treat-\nment will cause them to lose something, or their goals are not\nconsistent with those of their counselors. Sexual deviancy is\na common problem among convicted sexual offenders,\nregardless to whether they are receiving inpatient or outpa-\ntient treatment. Therefore, it is likely that sexual offenders\nwill engage in sexual deviant behavior while engaged in the\ntreatment process (Carich, Newbauer, & Stone, 2001;\nThe researcher expected that the length of experience\nwould have an effect on counseling professionals'/parapro-\nfessionals' attitudes toward adolescent sexual offenders.\nTable 5.

The findings also indicated a strong relation-\nship between experience and the deviancy factor. The\nrelationship between experience and deviancy should be\nexamined further to better understand the nature of the rela-\ntionship in future studies.\nTraining.No significant correlation was found between the\namount of training and participant attitudes toward adoles-\ncent sexual offenders. The number of months the participants\nreceived sexual offender training ranged from 0 to 60 (M =\n3.44). This finding is consistent with previous studies that\nhave found no significant relationship between training and\nattitudes toward sex offenders. Nelson, Herlihy, and Oescher\nsignificant relationship between attitudes and the extent that\nthey had received training for counseling sexual offenders.\nHowever, a significant positive relationship was found\nbetween attitudes and preparedness from training. In other\nwords, counselors felt prepared as a result of receiving train-\ning. As a result, counselors held more positive attitudes\ntoward sexual offenders when they felt prepared from their\ntraining. Herlihy et al. concluded that the lack of specific\nsexual offender training available to counseling profession-\nals/paraprofessionals that provide service to this population\nmay account for this finding. Typically, counselors receive\nspecialized training through their clinical experience.\nAlthough there was no significant correlation between the\namount of training and counseling professionals'/parapro-\nfessionals' attitudes, overall attitudes toward adolescent sex-\nual offenders were positive in this study. Positive attitudes\nmight have been attributed to other factors, such as familiar-\nity working with the adolescent offenders in general. In other\nwords, regular contact with adolescent offenders (sexual and\nnonsexual) might allow participants to view adolescent sex-\nual offenders no differently (Levy & Howells, 1994). Thus,\nbasic training to work with adolescent offenders in general\nmight have contributed to the positive attitudes toward this\ngroup. Frequent contact with adolescent sexual offenders\nmight have also contributed to why the counseling profes-\nsionals'/paraprofessionals' attitudes were positive regardless\nof the amount of sex offender training received.\nDespite no significant correlations between counseling\nprofessionals'/paraprofessionals'amount of training and atti-\ntudes, there is some evidence to suggest that training affects\ncounselor attitudes toward sexual offenders. Hogue (1993)\nfound that after training, participants' scores on the (ATS)\nincreased. After training, there was an increased belief that\nthey had skills to work with sex offenders, stronger beliefs\nthat counseling would stop offending acts, and a decrease in\ntheir perceived need for more information. The participants\nalso experienced a reduced concern about the reactions of\ncolleagues and an increased feeling of safety in their work.\nHogue's study underscores the need for increased training\nfor professionals who counsel sex offenders. Given these\nresults, it might be safe to conclude that training itself may\nnot influence attitudes, and thus, other variables (i.e., famil-\niarity with adolescent sexual offenders and basic training)\nworking with adolescent offenders should be considered.\nThere are no current studies known to the researcher examin-\ning the relationship between familiarity with adolescent sex-\nual offenders and basic training, with counselor attitudes\ntoward adolescent sexual offenders.\nGender. No relationship was found between gender and atti-\ntudes toward adolescent sexual offenders. In addition, a\nslight but insignificant difference in attitudes between\nfemales and males were found on the four factors that com-\nprise the CATSO. These findings are similar to previous\nstudies that have examined the relationship between gender\nand counselor attitudes toward sex offenders. Nelson et al.\n(2002) examined the relationship between gender and atti-\ntudes toward sexual offenders and found no significant dif-\nferences in attitudes related to gender. Ferguson and Ireland\n(2006) examined the attitudes of forensic staff and students\nusing the ATS and found a significant relationship between\ngender and attitudes. Although no statistical difference in\nattitudes between men and women were found, women atti-\ntudes were more positive than men. Ferguson and Ireland\nsuggested that their findings regarding women's attitudes\ntoward adolescent sexual offenders being more positive than\nmen were consistent with the findings from Radley (2001).\nRadley suggested that such gender differences might be\nexplained by women's tendency to be more empathic than\nmales.\nFor this study, there were no significant differences on\nmean scores between females and males on each CATSO\nfactor. On the Social Isolation factor, males were slightly\nmore positive. On the Capacity to Change factor, males were\nagain slightly more positive. On the Severity/Dangerousness\nfactor, females were slightly more positive than males. On\nthe Deviancy factor, no significant difference was found\nwhen comparing the means scores for this factor. The differ-\nences between females' and males' attitudes toward adoles-\ncent sexual offenders are not statistically significant to make\nadequate assumptions. Therefore, future research might\nexplore the relationship between gender of the adolescent\nsexual offender (female/male) and the gender of the counsel-\ning professional/paraprofessional to further assess its role in\nthe development of attitudes.\nLimitations\nThere are a number of limitations for this study. The study\ndid not include the kind of probability and stratification strat-\negies that are needed to ensure good external validity. That is\nto say, while convenience sampling was an acceptable, cost-\neffective method, it limited the sample to those participants\nfound in the chosen groups (i.e., counseling professionals/\nparaprofessionals) employed or trained within an adolescent\ntreatment facility in or around Michigan. Thus, the study was\npredicated on opinions from a restricted geographic area. A\ndrawback to the use of group administration was the possi-\nbility that participants may not have treated the survey as\nseriously when filling it out as part of a group than they\nmight have if they were permitted to fill it out unaccompa-\nnied. Another potential drawback to group administration of\nthe survey instrument concerned the participant's right to\ndecline participation)--namely, participants may have felt\npressured to participate in the survey because of the observa-\ntion that all others were participating despite the researcher's\nefforts at emphasizing the understanding that participants\nshould not feel compelled to participate. As such, conformity\neffect may have occurred because participation in the project\nbecame the norm defined by the behavior of fellow partici-\npants. Consequently, the results of this study might have\nbeen affected if participants did not truthfully answer the\nquestions.\nIn addition, because of the self-reported nature of the\nmeasure, participants were vulnerable to social desirability\nbiases, which may have affected the ability on the part of the\nresearcher to draw meaningful conclusions from the data.\nSocially desirable feedback can be defined as the tendency\nfor participants to present a favorable image of themselves,\nsuch as when participants \"pretend\" to conform to socially\nacceptable values and norms, avoid criticism, or gain social\nacceptance. Due to the fact that the CATSO included items\nthat could be deemed socially sensitive, socially desirable\nresponding is a potential limitation.\nUnlike previous studies examining counselors' attitudes\ntoward sexual offenders, this study used only one survey\ninstrument to measure counselors' attitudes toward sexual\noffenders rather than diverse assessment methods. Previous\nstudies have used diverse assessment methods to measure\ncounselors' attitudes toward sexual offenders. Carone and\nLaFleur (2000) used case histories of sexual offenders and\nthen administered a counselor response form to measure\nparticipant responses. Ferguson and Ireland (2006) used\nvignettes depicting specific sexual offenses followed by an\nattitude survey with staff working in a forensic setting and\nstudents. Carone and LaFleur (2000) used multiple instru-\nments (i.e., opinions about mental illness scale, general\nattribution questionnaire, and the level of familiarity ques-\ntionnaire) to assess counselor attitudes. This use of diverse\nmethods to measure attitudes might have improved the\nresearchers' chance to obtain useful data for a critical analy-\nsis and interpretation. The current study was limited to the\nCATSO and participant demographic information, limiting\nthe conclusions that could be drawn, such as the role the\nselected demographics (i.e., experience, training, and gen-\nder) play in the development of attitudes toward adolescent\nsexual offenders.\nThe correlational nature of this study was limiting--\nThat is, due to the correlational design of this study being\nprimarily descriptive in nature, causality could not be deter-\nmined. Specifically, it is difficult to say that the various\nprofessional demographic variables cause particular atti-\ntudes toward adolescent sexual offenders; it is only allow-\nable to say that certain attitudes co-vary with certain\nvariables. Future research could delve deeper into other\nimportant correlates of other contexts in which these cor-\nrelations occur. The researcher suggests using a mixed\nresearch approach (qualitative and quantitative) to further\nexplore counseling professionals'/paraprofessionals' atti-\ntudes toward adolescent sexual offenders.\nFuture Studies\nThe results of this study suggest several areas for future\nexploration. As noted, this study was the first to examine\nthe attitudes of counseling professionals/paraprofessionals\ntoward adolescent sexual offenders. Previous studies have\nexamined counselor attitudes toward adult sexual offend-\ners. Because adolescents are characteristically different\nfrom adult sexual offenders, and given the complexity of\nadolescent sexual aggression (Billick & Mack, 2005;\non examining counselor attitudes toward adolescent sexual\noffenders to better understand counselors' attitudes toward\nthis population.\nAlthough there was no significant correlations found\nbetween length of experience, amount of training, and gen-\nder with counseling professionals'/paraprofessionals' atti-\ntudes toward adolescent sexual offenders, this study should\nbe replicated in other adolescent residential treatment pro-\ngrams using similar research methods, variables, and instru-\nment. Replication of the current study might produce results\ndifferent from it and, thus, provide a different perspective as\nwell as add to the body of literature regarding counselors'\nattitudes and adolescent sexual offenders.\nFuture studies might also focus on other demographic\nvariables (i.e., education, amount of contact with adolescent\nsexual offenders, familiarity with adolescent sexual offend-\ners, culture, etc.) to identify variables that might influence\ncounselor attitudes toward adolescent sexual offenders.\nAlthough the aforementioned variables are different from the\nvariables examined in this study, examining other variables\nmight increase the chances of identifying the variables that\nmight affect counselors' attitudes toward adolescent sexual\noffenders. Successfully identifying demographic variables\nthat might influence counselors' attitudes toward sexual\noffender might provide implications for rapport building,\nspecifically with adolescent sexual offenders.\nAlthough adolescent and adult sexual offenders are\nviewed differently, there are many similarities to consider in\ntreating both the populations. For example, one similarity is\nthat there must be a good rapport between the offender and\ncounselor for treatment to be effective (Carone & LaFleur,\nFuture studies might compare counselor attitudes toward\nadolescent and adult sexual offenders to determine the attitu-\ndinal factors that appear to be common for both populations.\nThis, in turn, would have implications for treatment. In other\nwords, the results of future studies comparing the attitudes of\ncounselors toward adolescent and adult sexual offenders\nmight discover demographic variables significant to treating\nadolescent or adult sexual offenders. For instance, demo-\ngraphic variables that are found significant to engage adoles-\ncent sexual offenders in the treatment process might not be\nsignificant variables when treating adult sexual offenders.\nPer se, this might have implications for what counseling\ndemographic variables are more important treating adoles-\ncent or adult sexual offenders.\nAs noted, this study was limited to one instrument, the\nCATSO, to measure counseling professionals'/paraprofes-\nsionals' attitudes. Future studies should use multiple assess-\nment methods to measure attitudes. Previous studies\nexamining attitudes of counselors toward sexual offenders\nhave used multiple assessment methods (i.e., case vignettes,\nvarious assessment scales, etc.). Multiple assessment meth-\nods might produce a more useful and diverse range of data,\nthereby allowing more opportunity for an in-depth analysis\nand interpretation of findings.\nThe current study did not compare the attitudes among\nand between the types of counseling professionals/parapro-\nfessionals (i.e., therapists compared with family workers)\nrepresented in this study. Future studies using a sample of\ncounseling professionals/paraprofessionals should compare\nattitudes using similar demographic variables to identify\ndifferences in attitudes. Identifying differences between\ncounseling professionals/paraprofessionals might provide a\nbetter understanding of the relationship between certain\ndemographic variables and attitudes. Comparing counsel-\ning professionals/paraprofessionals attitudes might provide\nimplications for training and informing policy.\nConclusion\nAttention to the attitudes of counselors toward sexual offend-\ners is an important topic in the sexual abuse field, and is an\narea that is evolving. It is without question that prejudice\nagainst sexual offenders is a destructive force in society\nbecause it inhibits people from receiving the kind of care\n2006). Although Western culture has highlighted the preva-\nlence of sexually abusive behaviors, people within the cul-\nture continue to differ in their attitudes toward sexual\noffenders.\nDespite the counseling professionals'/paraprofessionals'\nlimited experience and training with adolescent sexual\noffenders in this study, their attitudes were positive. In addi-\ntion, there were no significant differences in attitudes between\nfemales and males toward adolescent sexual offenders.\nAlthough these results are somewhat encouraging, there is\nstill a limited understanding as to what variables might have\ninfluenced their attitudes. Therefore, research efforts must\nincrease to fully understand the variables that might influence\ncounselor attitudes toward sexual offenders. This, in turn,\nwould have implications for hiring practices, training for\ncounselors, and treatment for adolescent sexual offenders.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbel, G.
