The results indicate that many workers who suffer from health\nlimitations are directly accommodated by their employers, and that those who do not receive direct accommodation\nfrequently adapt to their limitations by altering theirjob demands or by changing jobs. These findings point to the\npotential for adjustments on both sides of the market: by employers, in the form of job accommodation, and by\nemployees, in theform ofjob change.\nMAINTAINING individuals with health limitations in\nthe labor force is one of the primary goals of the most\nrecent United States policy concerning those with disabili-\nemployees to make reasonable accommodations for individ-\nuals with health problems unless such accommodation\nwould cause an unreasonable hardship on business opera-\nOne of the hopes underlying the ADA is that accommodation\nat the onset of a health impairment will delay job exit and\nsubsequent movement onto the disability rolls.\nAlthough the Americans with Disabilities Act was written\ninto law in 1990, very little is known about the factors that\ninfluence an individual's ability to adapt to a health impair-\nment and continue working, or about the nature and the\nrange of accommodations and adjustments that individuals\nand their employers make to health limitations. What is\nknown is that a sizable number of men and women nearing\nretirement age report health limitations on their capacity to\nwork (Adams and Benson, 1992; Bound and Waidmann,\n1992), and that while many of these individuals leave the\nworkforce (Bound and Waidmann, 1992; U.S. Department\ncontinue working in spite of their reported health impair-\nDespite the fact that a majority of individuals who experi-\nence a work-limiting health impairment remain in the labor\nmarket, little research has been done on the factors facilitat-\ning their continued work. Rather, most of the research on\nhealth and labor force activity has focused on documenting\nthe importance of health in explaining early labor force exit\nfactors that contribute to early withdrawal (Bound, 1989;\nsome extent the absence of research on labor market activity\nfollowing the onset of a health limitation can be attributed to\na lack of the necessary data. Until recently the only surveys\ncontaining any information on such adjustments were the\nby the Census for the Social Security Administration.\nThe newly available Health and Retirement Study (HRS)\npermits further examination of this issue. A retrospective\nmodule in the first wave of the HRS contains detailed\nquestions about changes that a cohort of workers and their\nemployers made following the onset of a health limitation.\nThese data provide the information necessary to report the\nprevalence of worker adaptation and employer accommoda-\ntion among a cohort of men and women whose disabilities\noccurred prior to the passage of the Americans with Disabili-\nties Act.\nAs noted, a large body of literature exists on the effects of\nhealth on early withdrawal from the labor market. In con-\ntrast, relatively little research has been done on the factors\nthat facilitate continued work. This study focuses on this\nissue and examines the extent to which workers, through\ntheir own actions or those of their employer, adjust to their\nhealth limitations and continue working in the labor market.\nThe sample drawn is based on self-reports about health\nconditions that limit the amount or type of work that can be\nperformed. Analyses are performed separately for men and\nwomen to account for potential differences in the nature of\nthe disabilities faced, and the opportunities for and rewards\nof continued work.\nMETHODS\nSample Development\nThe analyses are based on data from the first wave of the\nHealth and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS contains\ncontemporaneous data on health, employment, income, and\nfamily structure for a nationally representative sample of\nhouseholds completed an interview in the first wave. (See\nJuster and Suzman, 1995, for a detailed discussion of the\nHRS data.)\nIn addition to contemporaneous health information, the\ninitial wave of the HRS (1992) includes a retrospective\nmodule of questions about the onset of current disabilities.\nThese questions were asked of individuals who reported that\ntheir health placed a limit on their current ability to perform\npaid work. The 1992 retrospective module is similar to the\n1978 Survey of Disability and Work; it includes questions\nabout the onset of the present health limitation; the respon-\ndent's job characteristics before and after the impairment\nbegan; the respondent's employment behavior, disability\nbenefit application and receipt; spouse's work effort; and\nspecific questions about employer accommodation follow-\ning onset. Based on this retrospective information about the\nonset of disability and its impact on employment, pre- and\npost-impairment work histories for all individuals impaired\nat the time of the 1992 interview are created.\nBecause the focus of this analysis is on the post-onset\nresponses of working individuals and their employers, the\nsample is restricted to those individuals who reported being\nimpaired at the time of the interview, became impaired\nduring their worklife, and were employed at its onset. After\nthese restrictions are applied and spouses and partners out-\nside of the appropriate age range are removed, the analytic\nwomen -- with complete information. Table 1 details the\ndevelopment of the analytic sample.\nKey Variables\nDisability. -- An important concern in any study of the\ncircumstances and behavior of people with disabilities is\nwhat definition of disability should be used to select the\nstudy population. The Americans with Disabilities Act\ndefines disability as a physical or mental impairment that\nsubstantially limits one or more major life activities, a record\nof such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an\nimpairment. This definition of disability is much broader\nthan ones based on the receipt of disability-related transfers\nor on a purely objective set of medical criteria that do not\nincorporate information about the individual's environment,\nresponsibilities, or human capital. Burkhauser and Daly\n(1996) suggest that this broader definition is useful when the\nresearch question focuses on individual responses to the\nonset of a health impairment and the factors that affect these\nresponses. There are many methods of operationalizing a\nbroader definition of disability (see LaPlante, 1991), but in\nTable 1. HRS Sample Development\nAnalytic sample criteria:\nCurrent disability began during worklife 1,355\nComplete information on key variables 1,192\nmost cases the selection depends largely on the availability\nof data.\nIn most nationally representative surveys of income and\nemployment the data available on health are self-reported\nand couched in terms of work limitations. The problems\ninherent in these types of data are well-documented (see\nsearchers have shown these measures to be highly correlated\nwith more objective measures of health (see Bound, 1991;\nStern, 1989). In addition, self-reported work limitations are\nknown to be highly correlated with reports on either chronic\nconditions or functional limitations (see, for example,\nBurkhauser and Daly, 1996). Thus, while self-reported\nmeasures of work limitations contain potential biases, they\ndo appear to adequately distinguish between those with and\nwithout a health impairment.\nAlthough an extensive set of contemporaneous health and\ndisability questions is available in the HRS, the retrospective\nmodule used in this study relies on a single self-reported\nwork limitation question to separate those with and without\nimpairments. Specifically, the question used in this research\nasks, \"Do you have any impairment or health problem that\nlimits the kind or amount of paid work you can do?\"\nIndividuals responding affirmatively to this question are\nclassified as being disabled. Throughout this article, disabil-\nity and impairment are used interchangeably to refer to\nindividuals who report that they have a work limitation as\nspecified in the above survey question.\nEmployment responses. -- HRS respondents with current\nhealth limitations who were employed at the onset of their\nimpairment were asked whether, at that point in time, they\nstayed with their employer, changed employers, or left the\nworkforce altogether. Individuals who remained with their\nemployer following onset are classified as having remained\nwith their employer; individuals who left their employer at\nonset and subsequently worked somewhere else are clas-\nsified as having changed employers; and individuals who left\ntheir employer following onset and had not returned to work\nby the time of the interview are classified as permanently out\nof the labor force.\nJob demands. -- Respondents with current health limita-\ntions who were employed at the onset of their impairment\nwere also asked to indicate the extent to which theirjob prior\nto onset required physical effort, lifting heavy loads, stoop-\ning, kneeling, or crouching, good eyesight, intense concen-\ntration, keeping a pace set by others, or skills in dealing with\npeople. Those employed after the onset of their impairment\nwere asked a similar set of questions about that job. Respon-\ndents were asked to report whether these descriptions were\ntrue of their jobs all or almost all of the time, most of the\ntime, some of the time, or none or almost none of the time.\nIndividuals who reported that they performed the task all,\nalmost all, or most of the time were classified as having a job\nwith that characteristic.\nIn the multinomial logit analysis the detailed job demands\nare collapsed into four summary categories. The categories\nare designed to represent the four basic dimensions of job\ntasks that can be described with the data. These categories\nare: (1) job is physically demanding, i.e., requires physical\neffort, lifting heavy loads, or stooping, kneeling, or crouch-\ning; (2) job is mentally demanding, i.e., requires intense\nconcentration or good eyesight; (3) job requires one to keep a\npace set by others; (4) job requires interaction with people. A\nreduction in job demands is defined as a movement from\nperforming a task all, almost all, or most of the time to\nperforming the task only some of the time or none of the time.\nEmployer accommodation. -- As with the job demand\nquestions, the employer accommodation questions were\nasked of individuals who were employed at the onset of their\nimpairment. Respondents were asked to report on whether\nthey received accommodation from their employer at onset,\nfirst employer after onset, and their current employer. The\nfirst of these questions asked, \"At the time your health\nstarted to limit your ability to work did your employer do\nanything special to help you out so that you could stay at\nwork?\" Those who changed employers following the onset\nof their health impairment were asked, \"Did your new\nemployer do anything special to make it easier for you to\nwork at the job?\" In addition, each person who reported that\nthey were accommodated by their employer was asked to\nprovide information on the type of assistance they received.\nRespondents were asked to report on eight specific types of\naccommodation, including: provide someone to help with\njob; shorten work day; allow schedule change; additional\nbreaks and rest periods; special transportation; alter the job\nduties to something respondent could do; training for new\nskills; and special equipment. Information from these ques-\ntions is used to describe the adaptations of workers following\nthe onset of a health impairment.\nAnalytic Strategy\nThe responses of workers and their employers to the onset\nof work-limiting health impairments are examined in stages.\nFor the first component of the analysis the sample is divided\ninto those who remained with their employer at onset, those\nwho changed employers, and those who left the labor force.\nMultinomial logit analysis is used to investigate the correlates\nof these three possible outcomes. This procedure is appropri-\nate for estimating the influence of the covariates on the\nprobabilities of being in one of the three choice groups. Under\nthis method the error terms are assumed to be independently\nand identically distributed as a log Weibull distribution.\nPrevious researchers have found age, race, and education\nlevel to be important determinants of health-related work\nloss (Haveman and Wolfe, 1990). Thus, the set of regressors\nincludes the age at which the health condition first began to\nlimit work, and dummy variables for African Americans,\nHispanics, and level of schooling. Age at onset is the age the\nrespondent recalls first being bothered by the health impair-\nment that currently limits work. Education is a categorical\nvariable distinguishing among individuals without a high\nschool degree, high school graduates, individuals with some\ncollege, and college graduates. The omitted category is\nindividuals without a high school degree. To account for the\nemployer side of the adaptation decision, information on\nemployer size and whether the employee was covered by a\nunion contract are also included as regressors. The employer\nsize variable is the respondent's estimate of the number of\nworkers the company employs in all locations. The analysis\nvariable is the natural logarithm of employer size. Union\nstatus is the respondent's report that he/she is covered by a\nunion contract.\nOther factors not captured by these variables, such as\nincome, occupation, and the severity of the impairment, may\nalso be important. Unfortunately, the HRS data contain very\nlittle information about income and occupation at the time of\nonset. The data do include each individual's reported health\ncondition at onset. Eight health condition categories are used\nto account for differences in the types of impairments across\nthe sample. The categories are: Cancers and Tumors; Muscu-\nloskeletal Conditions; Paralysis; Heart, Circulatory, and\nBlood Conditions; Respiratory Ailments; Gastrointestinal,\nMetabolic, and Endocrine Conditions; Neurological and Sen-\nsory Conditions; Emotional and Psychological Conditions;\nand miscellaneous health problems including: infectious dis-\neases, injuries and traumas, and reproductive health prob-\nlems. The health condition-at-onset variables are included\nonly as controls and are not discussed as part of the analysis.\nAfter the differences among those who remain with their\nemployer, change employers, and stop working are exam-\nined, the sample is restricted to those who continued to work\nfollowing the onset of their impairment. Within this sample,\nthe adjustments that both employers and employees made\nfollowing the onset of a health impairment are investigated\nby examining the prevalence of changes in job duties and\nemployers, explicit employer accommodation, and their\ninteractions.\nIn all of the analyses, results are reported separately for\nmen and women. Previous research has shown that occupa-\ntional differences and differences in job demands within the\nsame occupation produce different effects of disability\nacross men and women (Baldwin, Zeager, and Flacco, 1994;\nLoprest, Rupp, and Sandell, 1995). In addition, men are\ntraditionally more attached to the labor force and may have\nmore incentives to adapt or seek accommodation than\nwomen. These potential differences by gender suggest that\nseparate analyses are appropriate.\nAs part of the sampling scheme, the HRS oversamples\nAfrican Americans, Hispanics, and residents of the state of\nFlorida by a factor of 2. The sample weights provided on the\ncurrent release of the HRS are used to correct for this\noversampling of particular populations. Using the sample\nweights, the HRS should be roughly representative of the\nthe use of weighted data when performing the statistical tests\nresults derived by Manski and Lerman (1977) are used. In\nfact, because the effective sample size (for the purposes of\nstatistical tests; Kish, 1965) is only somewhat smaller than\nthe actual sample size, doing so makes little difference to the\nreported results.\nRESULTS\nTable 2 reports the proportion of individuals who were\nemployed at the onset of their impairment and remained with\ntheir employer, changed employers, or left the work force\nand had not yet returned to the labor market by the survey\nTable 2.

This table indicates that only about one-quarter of those\nwho became impaired while employed exited the labor force\nand had not yet returned. A majority of individuals (just over\none-half) continued with their employer at onset. The re-\nmaining individuals continued to work but changed employ-\ners. The patterns are similar among men and women, al-\nthough a slightly larger proportion of women than men left\nthe labor market.\nTable 3 reports the results of a deeper look into the\ndifferences between those who remained with their em-\nployer, changed employers, or stopped working. It displays\nthe coefficients and standard errors for a multinomial logit\nanalysis in which remaining with the employer at onset is the\nbaseline response. The coefficients can be interpreted as the\nfractional change in the odds of changing jobs or leaving the\nlabor force relative to the odds of continuing on the current\njob associated with a one-unit change in the explanatory\nvariable in question. The estimated effects of a change in\neach of the regressors on the probability of either changing\nemployers or leaving the labor force are reported in brackets.\nThe effects are evaluated at the mean of the dependent\nvariable. Descriptive statistics for the regressors are reported\nin Table 4.\nThe data in Table 3 show that older workers are signifi-\ncantly more likely to remain with their initial employer than\nto change employers, but are also more likely to stop\nworking after the onset of an impairment. Among men, the\ncoefficients on age at onset indicate that a one-year increase\nin the age at onset reduces the odds of changing employers\nrelative to remaining with the initial employer by .052, and\nincreases the odds of leaving the labor force relative to\nremaining with their employer at onset by .033. Thus, the\neffect of a one-year increase in age at onset is to decrease the\nprobability of changing employers by .01 percentage points,\nand to increase the probability of leaving the labor market by\nIn general, age at onset has a similar effect on the patterns\nof response among women. However, in some cases the\nmagnitude of the responses is greater. A one-year increase in\nage at onset among women reduces the odds of changing\nemployers by .087 and increases the odds of stopping work\nby .031. This implies that a one-year increase in age at onset\ndecreases the probability of changing employers by .02\npercentage points, but increases the probability of leaving\nthe labor force by . 12 percentage points, a magnitude almost\n15 times as large as the response among men.\nMen and women with at least a high school or college\ndegree are less likely to stop working than are high school\ndropouts; having a high school education decreases the\nprobability of leaving the labor force by about .18 percent-\nTable 3.

African\nAmerican females are less likely to change employers and\nare more likely to leave the labor force than are their White\ncounterparts.

Both men\nand women employed in large firms are significantly more\nlikely to remain with their employer at onset than they are to\nleave the labor force or change employers. This result is not\nsurprising, given that larger employers have greater re-\nsources and a larger number of employment opportunities\nthan small employers and thus may be more able to accom-\nmodate employees with disabilities. In addition, women\ncovered by union contracts are significantly less likely to\nleave their employer at onset. Being a union member de-\ncreases the probability that the mean woman will leave the\nlabor force by .04 percentage points. Union status has no\nsignificant impact on the responses of men. One possible\nreason for this difference in union effects on men and women\nis that men and women covered by unions work in different\njobs, and the jobs that women hold are more conducive to\ncontinued employment than those held by men belonging to\nunions. However, since the retrospective module of the HRS\ndoes not provide complete information about occupation and\nindustry at the onset of disability, a more thorough treatment\nof this effect is beyond the scope of this study.\nIn Table 5 the sample is reduced to only those individuals\nwho worked at some point after the onset of their health\nimpairment. Table 5 focuses on job duties before and after\nthe onset of an impairment. The results are reported sepa-\nrately for workers who remained with their employer at onset\nand for workers who changed jobs. The proportions repre-\nsent the fraction of workers who performed the listed tasks\nall, almost all, or most of the time, before and after the onset\nof their impairment. The net proportion reflects the change in\nthe proportion with a particular job demand following the\nonset of an impairment. The results indicate that with few\nexceptions a significant proportion of individuals working at\njobs with continual physical and/or mental demands reduced\nthese demands following the onset of a health impairment.\nThe net changes in physical job demands and working at a\nfixed pace were higher for workers who changed employers\nthan for workers who remained with their employer after\nonset. However, these differences were only significant for\nwomen. Overall, men and women who changed jobs were\nsignificantly more likely to report a reduction in job demands\nalong some dimension than men and women who remained\nwith their employer following the onset of a health condition\nTable 5.

Table 6 describes the prevalence of\nreported employer accommodation and compares the experi-\nences of workers who remained with their employer with the\nexperiences of workers who changed employers. Signifi-\ncantly more men and women who remained with their\nemployer after the onset of their health condition reported\nreceiving accommodation from their employer. About one-\nthird of the men and women who remained with their\nemployer indicated that they were explicitly accommodated.\nA significantly smaller fraction (14.1%) of men who\nchanged employers reported explicit accommodation on the\npart of their employer. The situation for women was slightly\ndifferent. Nearly one-quarter of the women with an em-\nployer other than their employer at onset reported that they\nwere accommodated.\nAmong workers who remained with their employer, ac-\ncommodation was most commonly provided in the form of\nan alteration in job duties, assistance with the job, a change\nin schedule or a shorter work day, and more breaks. There\nwere no clear patterns among workers who were accommo-\ndated by a new employer. The least common type of accom-\nmodation for both groups was special transportation.\nThe results from Tables 5 and 6 suggest that individuals\nwho change employers are significantly more likely to\nchange the demands of theirjob than those who stay, but that\nexplicit employer accommodation is more common for\nworkers who remain than for those who move to a new\nemployer. However, changes in job demands and employer\naccommodation are not mutually exclusive alternatives. In\nfact, men and women who were accommodated by their\nemployer at onset were more than three times as likely to\nreport ajob change than were individuals who remained with\ntheir employer at onset but did not report being accommo-\ndated. Although this does not account for differences in\nneeds among those who were and were not accommodated,\nthe results do suggest that in some cases job demands and\nreported accommodation go hand in hand.\nDISCUSSION\nAs is well recognized (Nagi, 1965; Pope and Tarlov,\n1991), work disabilities often reflect mismatches between an\nindividual's capacities and the physical or mental demands\nof a job. Thus, many individuals with health limitations on\ntheir capacities to work may be able to continue in the labor\nmarket by overcoming this mismatch. This study has docu-\nmented the kinds of adjustments that a cohort of workers and\ntheir employers made following the onset of work-limiting\nhealth impairments before explicit and comprehensive gov-\nernment protection of people with disabilities was in place.\nThe findings indicate that among those employed at the onset\nof their health limitation, a majority continued to work and\nthat, of these, a majority continued to work for the same\nemployer. In addition, more than one-third of those who\ncontinued to work for the same employer mentioned specific\nways in which their employer had accommodated them.\nNot surprisingly, age and education play an important role\nin determining the employment outcomes for workers fol-\nlowing the onset of a health impairment. Older workers are\nmore likely to stay with their original employer if they\ncontinue to work, but are less likely to continue in the labor\nmarket. This result is open to a variety of interpretations.\nOlder workers who leave their employer may be more\nseverely impaired, may not have a marketable set of skills to\ntransfer to a job more suited to their capacities, or may see\nthe costs of unemployment until retirement as less than the\ncosts of retraining or an extensive job search. Unfortunately,\nthe retrospective module of the HRS does not contain suf-\nficient information to determine why older individuals leave\nthe labor market.\nEducation has little effect on the likelihood that workers\nwill change employers, but workers with at least a high\nschool education were less likely to stop working after the\nonset of a health impairment. Like age, the lack of a high\nschool education may make it more difficult for workers with\nimpairments to find alternative employment that matches\ntheir capacities. Baldwin and Johnson (1994) argue that\nthese individuals -- those with less than average work\nTable 6.

Again, the retrospective data provide no\ninformation about why these individuals stopped working.\nAlthough other researchers have found differences in the\neffects of disability on men and women, few of the results\npresented here indicate gender-specific behavior. Men and\nwomen who continue to work following the onset of a health\nimpairment appear to make similar adaptations and receive\ncorresponding levels of employer accommodation. One\nresult that does indicate potential gender differences is in the\ndecision to leave the labor market or continue working\nfollowing onset. The findings indicate that women are more\nlikely to leave the labor market after the onset of an impair-\nment than are men. Although the data do not permit a direct\ninvestigation of the causes behind these findings, part of the\ngender difference might be explained by the relative impor-\ntance of male and female earnings in household budgets. In a\nmajority of households, particularly in this age cohort, men\nremain the primary earners. Thus, labor market withdrawal\nmay be more of an option for women than it is for equally\ndisabled men. This is only one among many plausible\nexplanations that open to investigation as more waves of the\nHRS data are collected.\nWhile the retrospective data provide little information\nabout the causes of the differences reported here, they do\ngive an impression of the groups at risk for leaving the labor\nmarket or changing employers following the onset of a\nhealth impairment. From these descriptive results one can\nspeculate about why certain groups are more successful than\nothers in either remaining with their employer after onset, or\nchanging employers but remaining in the labor market.\nOlder workers and workers with less than a high school\neducation may be insufficiently skilled to gain employment\nin an enterprise more suited to their post-onset capacities.\nPresumably, younger workers and workers with more edu-\ncation would have a larger set of opportunities and might\nfind it more beneficial to retrain in order to find new employ-\nment. To the extent that African American women face labor\nmarket discrimination, these women may find their opportu-\nnities for job change to be more limited. In general, these\nresults indicate that traditional factors associated with differ-\nential outcomes in the labor market also account for differen-\ntial outcomes in the post-onset employment responses of\npeople with disabilities.\nAmong those workers who continued to work following\nthe onset of an impairment, the findings indicate that many\nof those who remained with their pre-onset employer experi-\nenced a combination of reductions in their job demands and\nexplicit employer assistance. For those who changed jobs,\nadaptation occurred more often through changes in job\ndemands than through employer accommodation. The find-\ning that a significant fraction of employers made accommo-\ndations for their employees prior to the passage of the ADA\nSurveys of the Disabled (Burkhauser et al., 1992; Lando,\nthat nearly one-third of those who experience a disability\nreport some form of employer accommodation. These find-\nings support recent anecdotal evidence that suggests that\nemployer accommodation following disability is not uncom-\nmon (Chirikos, 1991) and may contribute to a worker's\nability to remain in the labor market.\nThe results presented here provide population-based de-\nscriptive information to support the anecdotal evidence that\n(a) employers often accommodate workers who suffer health\nimpairments, and (b) among workers who are not explicitly\naccommodated, changes in employers and job duties often\noccur. However, this does not imply that everyone who\nexperiences a health impairment will be able to continue\nworking. A large part of this determination will have to do\nwith the severity of the limitation (McNeil, 1993). This can\nbe true either because severity affects an individual's capac-\nity to continue working or because it affects an employer's\nwillingness and/or ability to make accommodations. Em-\nployers may be more likely to accommodate milder impair-\nments, while accommodation may be more essential for\nthose with more severe limitations. Although the retrospec-\ntive portion of the HRS data does not permit an investigation\nof the relationship between severity and accommodation or\nemployee adaptation, other research suggests that some\nemployers are willing to accommodate individuals with\nimpairments severe enough to qualify them for disability\nThis study highlights the possibility of adaptations to the\nonset of a disability on both sides of the labor market: by\nemployers (in the form of job accommodation) and by\nemployees (in the form of a reduction in job demands\nthrough changes in jobs and/or employers). In addition, the\nfindings suggest that employers, particularly large employ-\ners, play an important role in protecting impaired workers\nfrom work losses associated with the onset of a health\nimpairment. A natural next step to understanding the poten-\ntial impact of the ADA is to ask whether the changes in job\nduties and employer accommodations lengthen the active\nworking life of impaired workers. It will also be important to\ninvestigate which workers receive accommodation and un-\nder what circumstances. These are the types of questions that\nneed to be answered before the potential effectiveness of\nlaws such as the ADA can be evaluated.\n"
