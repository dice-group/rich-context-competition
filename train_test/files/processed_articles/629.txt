Dramatic\nchanges in the prevalence of cigarette smoking in the second\nhalf of this century in the United States (i.e., a reduction\namong men and an increase among women) have reduced\ncurrent smoking levels to approximately one quarter of the\nadult population and have reduced differences in smoking\nprevalence and smoking-attributable diseases between the\nsexes. Current smoking in the United States is positively\nassociated with younger age, lower income, reduced educa-\ntional achievement, and disadvantaged neighborhood envi-\nronment. Daily smokers smoke cigarettes to maintain nico-\ntine levels in the brain, primarily to avoid the negative effects\nof nicotine withdrawal, but also to modulate mood. Regular\nsmokers exhibit higher and lower levels of stress and\narousal, respectively, than nonsmokers, as well as higher\nimpulsivity and neuroticism trait values. Nicotine depen-\ndence is the single most common psychiatric diagnosis in the\nUnited States, and substance abuse, major depression, and\nanxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric comor-\nbid conditions associated with nicotine dependence. Studies\nin twins have implicated genetic factors that explain most of\nthe variability in vulnerability to smoking and in persistence\nof the smoking phenotype. Future research into the causes of\nsmoking must take into account these associated demo-\ngraphics, social factors, comorbid psychiatric conditions,\nand genetic factors to understand this complex human be-\nCigarette smoking, hereafter referred to as \"smoking,\" is the\nlargest single risk factor for premature death in developed coun-\ntries. Approximately one fifth of the deaths in the United States\nare attributable to smoking, and 28% of the smoking-attributable\ndeaths involve lung cancer, 37% involve vascular disease, and\ndeaths per year and 30% of all cancers in the United States are\nattributable to smoking (2). Lung cancer is the largest single\ncause of cancer-associated mortality (3) and is the most common\ncause of smoking-related mortality in the United States (4). The\nattributable risk from smoking for oral, pharyngeal, and esoph-\nageal cancers is substantial, although less than that for lung\ncancer (5,6). The attributable risk from both smoking and alco-\nhol consumption accounts for the majority of both oral and\npharyngeal cancers (5) and of esophageal cancer (7). Morbidity\nand mortality attributable to smoking would decline in the future\nif reductions in smoking prevalence were to be observed. How-\never, despite dramatic declines in adult male smoking preva-\nlence in the United States observed from the 1960s through the\n1990s (8), the decline in current adult smoking prevalence\nslowed by about 1990 (9), and recent surveys of current smoking\nin youth, defined as cigarette use on at least one of the last 30\ndays preceding the survey, show a statistically significant in-\nlence of current smoking among adults in the United States,\ndefined as smoking daily or smoking on some days (11), is now\nabout 23% in women and 27% in men and is statistically\nsignificantly higher in those less than 65 years of age; in those\nwith 9\u00ad11 years of education; in those below the poverty thresh-\nold; in whites, blacks, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives;\nand in military veterans (9,12\u00ad15). Projected demographic and\nsmoking prevalence trends suggest that the absolute number\nof current smokers in the United States, about 47 million\nindividuals in 1995, will continue to increase, especially in\nthose below the poverty threshold, in those with less than 13\nyears of education, and in those greater than or equal to 65 years\nSmoking prevalence in men worldwide is higher than it is in\nthe United States, while smoking prevalence among women\nworldwide is usually less than the prevalence in men, although\nit has equaled or exceeded that in men in some northern Euro-\npean countries (19,20). While annual per capita cigarette con-\nsumption has dropped in developed countries from a high of\ncreasing in developing countries (260% increase in China be-\ncigarette consumption has not changed substantially over the last\n25 years (20). Because of the delayed health effects of smoking,\nmorbidity and mortality in developing countries attributable to\nsmoking have not yet surpassed those in developed countries but\nare likely to do so in the next century (20,21).\nThe study of biomarkers in smoking-attributable cancer has\nconcentrated on measures of exposure (i.e., cotinine, NNAL-\nGluc1), dose (i.e., carcinogen\u00admacromolecular adducts, such as\n4-amino biphenyl hemoglobin adducts), micronutrients (i.e.,\n-carotene), and genetic factors that may modify these factors or\ntheir effects (22). The investigation of such biomarkers is predi-\ncated on the assumption that an enhanced understanding of\nmetabolic mechanisms will help to identify susceptible groups\nor individuals and direct future research or prevention efforts.\nAnother group of risk factors for lung cancer and other smoking-\nrelated cancers are those that are associated with smoking, its\ninitiation, and its persistence. We will review factors associated\nwith current and persistent smoking that have been studied by\nuse of pharmacologic, epidemiologic, behavior genetic, psycho-\nlogic, and psychiatric perspectives.

Improved understanding of these mecha-\nnisms may enable improved cancer prevention and control ef-\nforts.\nMETHODS\nThe purpose of this review is to describe and evaluate demographic, psycho-\nsocial, and biologic factors found to show statistically significant associations\nwith current and persistent cigarette smoking in order to make research recom-\nmendations concerning which covariates are important in the study of the human\nphenotype of cigarette smoking. Published English-language papers of all types\nuse of the portion of the MEDLINE\u00ae database from 1985 to the present and\nvarious combinations of the following terms: smoking, smoking cessation, epi-\ndemiology, prevalence, nicotine, cotinine, acetylcholine, nicotinic acetylcholine\nreceptors, lung cancer, oral cancer, drug abuse and dependence, alcohol depen-\ndence, depression, twin studies, and animal model studies. Reports from the\nSurgeon General, monographs, and internet sites were also searched for relevant\nstudies and evaluated for inclusion in this review. The purpose of the search was\nto gather studies on the cigarette smoking phenotype from the epidemiologic,\npharmacologic, psychiatric, and psychologic literature. Studies evaluated for\nassociated factors included the following: case\u00adcontrol and case\u00adcase studies of\ndemographic, genetic, psychiatric, and psychologic variables; factor analyses of\ncase series; twin studies; and animal model studies. To distinguish between\nstudies included or excluded, the criteria of sample size, validated or controlled\nmeasures of phenotype, established analytic approaches, and reasonable inter-\npretation were used for evaluation. The narrative method was used to provide\nexamples of the evidence presented in the studies reviewed. The method used to\nmake research recommendations was to identify those phenotypes that were\nconsistently and statistically significantly associated with current cigarette smok-\ning.\nAddiction to nicotine has been established as the psychophar-\nmacologic mechanism that maintains cigarette smoking behav-\nior (23). Nicotine activates the brain's mesolimbic dopaminergic\nreward system (24,25) and produces dependence resulting in\nphysical and neurobiologic withdrawal symptoms on abrupt ces-\nsation (26,27). In rodent and primate animal models of drug\naddiction, once study subjects are trained in a controlled sched-\nule paradigm to avoid the aversive effects of high concentrations\nof nicotine, nicotine is self-administered (28\u00ad31). Nicotine acts\nas an agonist for neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors\n(nAChRs)--pentameric ionotropic (Na+ and Ca2+) receptors\nfound presynaptically throughout the central nervous system\n(CNS) and postsynaptically in the autonomic nervous system--\nthat modulate the release of neurotransmitters and ganglionic\nnAChR numbers are increased, particularly the most common\nnAChR type in the mammalian brain, the 42 heteromer\n(36,37). The increased numbers of nAChRs upon chronic nico-\ntine treatment is associated with the development of behavioral\ntolerance to nicotine in animal models and is statistically sig-\nnificantly related to intensity and duration of smoking history in\nhuman postmortem brain (34,38). Nicotine also acts as an an-\ntagonist, not because the increased numbers of nAChRs are as-\nsociated with an increase in nAChR messenger RNA (39,40) or\na change in binding parameters of nicotine to the receptor (33\u00ad\n35) but rather because of a reduction in nAChR turnover and\naccumulation of nAChR at the cell surface (41). Short- and\nlong-term desensitization kinetics of 42 receptor suggest that\ndesensitization and inactivation are two different allosteric states\nthat may be responsible for the acute and chronic nicotine tol-\nerance observed in humans and in animals (41,42).\nSmokers of cigarettes increase smoking intensity, smoking\nrate, or inhalation to maintain levels of nicotine, as measured by\nplasma levels of nicotine in both ad libitum and laboratory\nsmoking settings (43\u00ad46). Measured nicotine levels in the arte-\nrial and venous circulation indicate that individual smokers can\nless than the equilibrium binding and activation concentration of\nl-nicotine to the 42 receptor, the predominant nAChR in the\nbrain, but is nearly equal to the effective concentration for in-\nNicotine absorption per cigarette has been measured both by\ngraphical methods from nicotine concentration curves obtained\nfrom plasma blood measurements (46) and by parametric calcu-\nlation by use of stable isotope studies of nicotine to cotinine\nconversion and nicotine and cotinine clearance values obtained\nin inpatient-infusion studies (47). These studies suggest that\nsmokers are extracting approximately 1\u00ad2 mg of nicotine per\ncigarette. The total amount of nicotine per cigarette measured by\nsmoking machines by use of human smoking parameters of puff\nvolume, duration, and frequency is about 2\u00ad3 mg per cigarette\n(50,51), suggesting that smokers absorb more than half of the\ninhaled nicotine. However, none of these methods measures the\npeak brain concentration of nicotine, which is presumed to be\nthe major pharmacologic factor that mediates reward, depen-\ndence, and the development of tolerance. Studies of dosing\nkinetics in animal models demonstrate the development of\nhigher levels of tolerance with higher peak concentrations\nOne behavioral mechanism responsible for differences in\nnicotine consumption may be related to variation in nicotine and\ncotinine metabolism (53\u00ad55). Nicotine from tobacco smoke is\nabsorbed quickly (in seconds) throughout the body on initial\ndosing (46,48) and then is eliminated with a half-life of 2\u00ad3\nhours (56). Nicotine is metabolized principally (80%) to coti-\nsible for much of the metabolism of cotinine (59) and for much\nof the activation of the potent tobacco smoke carcinogen NNK\n(60). The typical smoker experiences a nicotine concentration\nnadir in the morning after overnight abstinence and then smokes\nto increase nicotine levels over the first few hours of the day and\nto maintain a plateau throughout the remainder of the day (46).\nClearance of nicotine in humans is primarily diurnal, peaking at\nmidday, with spikes of increased clearance after meals, which is\nconcordant with increased human smoking rates early in the day,\nlowest smoking rates in the evening, and increased smoking\nmeasured by analysis of protein levels and in kinetic experi-\nments with liver samples (58,62,63). The basis for constitutive\ndifferences in activity has been associated with variant CYP2A6\nalleles encoding inactive enzyme (62,64\u00ad67). A statistically sig-\nnificantly reduced frequency of two CYP2A6 null alleles in\nnicotine (and alcohol)-dependent smoking-clinic patients versus\nnever nicotine-dependent individuals and a statistically signifi-\ncant negative association with the numbers of cigarettes smoked\nper week have been reported (68). This study needs to be rep-\nlicated in additional samples to confirm the possible role of\ninherited variation at the CYP2A6 locus in smoking behavior.\nMisspecification of the CYP2A6 genotype because of incom-\npletely specific CYP2A6 genotyping assays (64,67) may affect\nthe statistical significance of findings relating CYP2A6 alleles to\nsmoking behavior.\nPlasma and urinary nicotine and cotinine concentrations have\nrepeatedly been found to be associated with the number of ciga-\nrettes smoked per day (69\u00ad71). Since cotinine has a half-life an\norder of magnitude greater than that of nicotine, it is useful as a\nbiomarker in smoking surveys, smoking cessation trials, and the\nassessment of exposure to environmental cigarette smoke\n(72,73). Interindividual variation in the conversion of nicotine to\ncotinine and in the clearance of cotinine may have effects on\nnicotine consumption and dependence (53). For example, coti-\nnine levels were found to be higher in African-Americans than\nin Caucasian-Americans or Mexican-Americans, after adjust-\nment was made for reported cigarette smoking (74). While nico-\ntine metabolism was not found to be statistically significantly\ndifferent in African-Americans and Caucasian-Americans, mean\nnonrenal and total metabolism (clearance) of cotinine was\nshown to be significantly lower in African-Americans than in\nCaucasian-Americans (74,75). Calculation of nicotine intake per\ncigarette on the basis of the inpatient infusion studies also indi-\ncates that African-Americans absorb statistically significantly\nmore nicotine per cigarette smoked than do Caucasian-\nAmericans (75). This suggests that differences in the numbers of\ncigarettes smoked among African-American and Caucasian-\nAmerican smokers (76,77) may be influenced by metabolic dif-\nferences between the groups.\nEvidence for genetic determinants affecting the smoking phe-\nnotype has steadily accumulated both from studies of substance\nabuse in animals and from analysis of the contributions of ge-\nnetics and personality to substance abuse in humans (78,79).\nTwo recent linkage studies in humans (80,81) have indicated\nregions of the genome in which loci affecting nicotine depen-\ndence and ever smoking may be found with further work. How-\never, an appreciation of the neurotransmitter-related mecha-\nnisms involved in reward circuits in the human brain has\nsuggested many candidate loci potentially associated with nico-\ntine dependence (54). The first genetic association studies in\nhumans at dopaminergic loci (82\u00ad88) have reported statistically\nsignificant differences in the allele frequencies between smokers\nand nonsmokers at markers linked to the genes coding for the\nD1, D2, and D4 dopamine receptors and at the dopamine trans-\nporter, consistent with the dopaminergic reward hypothesis of\nnicotine dependence (89).\nAs in some previous studies of the D2 dopamine receptor in\ncase\u00adcontrol studies of substance abuse (90), the less frequent\nallele (A1) at a genetic marker flanking the dopamine receptor\nD2 coding sequence (DRD2) was found to be at a higher fre-\nquency in the collections of smokers versus nonsmokers (82,83).\nIn a sample of smokers undergoing a limited smoking cessation\nintervention, a protective association with a particular allele (al-\nlele 9) at the dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) was observed with\nsmoking status, age at smoking initiation, and history of quitting,\nand the protective association with smoking status was stronger\nin those individuals with DRD2 A2 genotypes (88). Since the\nDRD2 A1 allele has been found previously to be associated with\nlower D2 receptor densities (91) and the SLC6A3 allele 9 has\nbeen associated with excess dopamine after cocaine abuse (92),\nthis suggests that the protective association with smoking status\nobserved may be due to normal densities of DRD2 receptors and\nincreased synaptic dopamine that may provide some resistance\nto nicotine dependence (88). At the D4 dopamine receptor locus,\nallele DRD4.7, found previously to be associated with novelty\nseeking and substance abuse in some case\u00adcontrol studies (93),\nwas found in African-Americans, but not in Caucasian-\nAmericans, to be associated with smoking status, intensity, per-\nsistence, and initiation. In Caucasian-Americans, a statistically\nsignificant association of allele 4 of the DRD4 receptor (not\nassociated with novelty seeking) with smoking for the regulation\nof mood in depressed smokers was observed (87), suggesting\nthat the DRD4 locus may affect smoking behavior in depressed\nindividuals as well as increase vulnerability to nicotine depen-\ndence in some populations (86). These preliminary candidate\ngene studies need to be repeated in larger samples, in samples\nwith similar and different ethnic origins, and in family-based\nsamples to confirm the effect of these alleles on vulnerability to\nnicotine dependence, to explore the effect in samples that differ\nin allele frequency and smoking prevalence, and to control for\npotential confounding in case\u00adcontrol samples. Future studies\ninvolving neurobiologic candidate loci that potentially affect\nsmoking behavior should also emphasize the analysis of func-\ntional genetic polymorphisms or of linkage disequilibrium struc-\nture to identify haplotypes potentially carrying functional poly-\nGenetic epidemiologic studies using the twin-study design\n(95), where multiple genetic and environmental risk factors and\na threshold disease model are modeled by use of concordance\ndata in monozygotic and dizygotic twins, have estimated the\neffects of genetic and environmental factors on current smoking,\nsmoking initiation, and smoking persistence (96). A reanalysis\nof seven twin studies from Scandinavia, the United States, and\nAustralia estimated that a mean of 60% of the variance in risk of\nbeing a current smoker in men and women is accounted for by\nadditive genetic effects, with most studies demonstrating statis-\ntically nonsignificant shared environment effects (96). From the\nsame studies, the mean additive genetic effect on the liability to\nsmoking initiation (i.e., becoming a smoker) was estimated to be\n57%, with an estimated mean shared environmental effect of\n17%. From three of the studies where data were available to\nassess the relative contributions to smoking persistence, the\nmean additive genetic effect was estimated to be 69%, with\nstatistically nonsignificant estimated shared environmental ef-\nfects. A recent analysis of smoking initiation and persistence\namong twin pairs in the Vietnam Era Twin Registry found that\nthe best-fitting model included statistically significant additive\ngenetic factors (explaining 50% of variance in risk) and both\nshared (family, 30% of variance) and specific (to one twin)\nenvironmental factors (20% of variance) for smoking initiation.\nFor smoking persistence, however, only genetic and specific\nenvironmental factors were found to be statistically significant,\nexplaining approximately 70% and 30% of the variation, respec-\ntively (97). Thus, twin studies estimate that the majority of the\nliability to become and to remain a smoker is explained by\nadditive genetic factors. A variable remaining portion of the risk\nis estimated to be related to specific environmental effects, but\nthere is no consistent, statistically significant evidence for a\nshared or common environment effect.\nTo assess whether the decline in smoking initiation in men\nand the increase in smoking initiation in women have led to a\nchange in the interaction of genetic and environmental effects\nwith birth cohort, three large twin studies were reanalyzed that\n(98). Researchers tested heterogeneity of twin tetrachoric corre-\nlations across samples and across sex and found increased ge-\nnetic effects in men in two of the samples compared with the\nthird sample; however, there was no genetic heterogeneity by\nage cohort (98). The modeling of age-related changes in the\neffects of genetic and environmental factors in smoking initia-\ntion in adolescent twin pairs showed that genetic effects in-\ncreased with age; however, shared environmental effects, which\nexplain the majority of variation in risk at early ages (12\u00ad16\nyears), were not statistically significant in early adulthood (99).\nFamily studies of the relatives of substance-dependent individu-\nals ascertained in treatment settings, with control subjects lo-\ncated via a random-digit-dialing protocol, suggest that there are\nboth general factors increasing vulnerability to substance abuse\nand specific factors increasing vulnerability to specific drugs,\nincluding habitual smoking (100). Family studies of the siblings\nof alcoholic and nonalcoholic probands ascertained in treatment\nand nontreatment settings identified the sibling's own sex, birth\ncohort, and comorbid substance dependence as statistically sig-\nnificant predictors of habitual smoking (defined as a smoking\nhabitual smoking in the proband, but not other substance abuse,\nwas a statistically significant predictor of habitual smoking in\nsiblings, suggesting a specific risk factor for nicotine depen-\ndence.\nPersonality and behavioral studies have suggested why some\npeople are more likely to smoke and what smokers perceive that\nthey derive from smoking tobacco. Research in motives for\nsmoking posits a limited number of factors based on responses\nto questions concerning hypothesized reasons for smoking (102\u00ad\n104). These factors have been constructed from psychosocial\nmodels of various motives for smoking, such as smoking to\nmodify affect, smoking to relax, food substitution smoking, etc.\n(105). Investigation of the correlation structure among these hy-\npothesized motives for smoking provided consistent and statis-\ntically significant support for six of these factors: addiction,\nautomatic, stimulation, psychosocial, indulgent, and sensorimo-\ntor manipulation (105,106). Interfactor correlation analysis sug-\ngested that the first three factors loaded onto a second-order\npharmacologic factor and the last three loaded onto a nonphar-\nSmokers experience self-reported increases in arousal and\ndecreases in stress after smoking cigarettes, with absolute levels\nof arousal and stress peaking in midday and in the morning,\nrespectively (107). Smokers experience stimulation and se-\ndation simultaneously from each cigarette; however, they\nalso experience lower equilibrium levels of arousal and\nhigher equilibrium levels of stress than nonsmokers. After\nsmoking cessation, mean arousal and stress levels are increased\nand reduced, respectively, suggesting that smoking cigarettes\nmay contribute to the increased stress observed in smokers\nPersonality and temperament constructs that use question-\nnaires to measure heritable personality dimensions quantita-\ntively, e.g., Cloninger's Tridimensional Personality Question-\nnaire (79,109), have been used to investigate personality\ntraits. Novelty seeking, extraversion, impulsivity, and neuroti-\ncism have been identified as the personality factors found at\nhigher levels among smokers than among nonsmokers\nexhibit similarly increased sensation-seeking scores relative\nto nonsmokers suggests that, while increased sensation-\nseeking may increase liability to smoking initiation, it may\nnot be related to differences in nicotine dependence among\nsmokers.\nFagerstrom and colleagues proposed an eight-question\nquestionnaire (115), the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine\nDependence (FTND), in an attempt to provide quantitative\ninformation on nicotine dependence to assist in cessation\ntherapy. FTQ and FTND scores have been found to show\nstatistically significant associations with biochemical\nmeasures related to the quantity of cigarettes smoked (plasma\nnicotine, plasma or urinary cotinine, and expired CO)\nand are also associated with cessation outcome in trials without\nhave not been consistently correlated with percent abstinent\nat the end of the placebo-controlled trials with\nnicotine-replacement therapy; when they are predictive, they ex-\npopulation-based samples of smokers are statistically signifi-\ncantly lower than scores from smokers seeking cessation help\nA small fraction of active cigarette smokers are known\nas chippers or nondependent smokers, defined as smoking five\nor fewer cigarettes per day (119). Compared with regular\nsmokers, chippers were found to extract similar amounts\nof nicotine per cigarette and to exhibit similar elimination\nhalf-lives of nicotine but to be statistically significantly\nless nicotine dependent and to have begun their smoking\ncareers significantly more slowly (119\u00ad121). Regular smokers\nscored higher on pharmacologic smoking motive factors, and\nchippers scored higher on nonpharmacologic smoking motive\nfactors (122). Chippers and regular smokers both appear\nto smoke for affect management; however, unlike regular\nsmokers, chippers do not crave cigarettes and exhibit lower lev-\nels of smoking for stimulation and smoking to relieve negative\naffect.\nThe establishment of nicotine dependence in the American\nPsychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders (DSM), third edition, represented the noso-\nlogic and diagnostic recognition of this drug dependency (123).\nThe DSM-III/DSM-IV diagnosis of nicotine dependence\n(305.10) requires a minimum of three of seven diagnostic symp-\ntoms: tolerance, withdrawal, greater use than intended, persistent\ndesire to quit, great amounts of time spent smoking, activities\ngiven up or reduced due to smoking, and continued smoking\ndespite knowledge of having a persistent physical or psycho-\nlogic problem with the substance (123,124). The DSM-IV diag-\nnosis of nicotine withdrawal (292.0) requires four or more symp-\ntoms of eight to appear after abrupt cessation of tobacco use\n(124). A diagnosis of nicotine abuse is not recognized in either\nthe DSM-III-R or the DSM-IV, primarily because nicotine does\nnot meet two of the major criteria for a diagnosis of substance\nabuse. Specifically, nicotine is not considered to produce intoxi-\ncation, and a diagnosis other than nicotine dependence would\nnot be appropriate for maladaptive use of the substance (125).\nNicotine dependence is a model for drug dependence, where\ntobacco smoking fulfills the physiologic, behavioral, and social\ncharacteristics of a dependence syndrome, but it also acts as a\ngateway drug for other drugs of abuse (126). However, the mor-\nbidity and mortality due to the direct effects of tobacco smoking\nexceed the direct or indirect effects of other drugs of abuse or,\nindeed, of any other single behavior on a population level\n(2,127). In contrast to the FTQ/FTND, there are no explicit\nquantitative measures assessed in the DSM substance depen-\ndence criteria, which are derived from the alcohol-dependence\nsyndrome, a gradient of the severity of dependence comprising\nadditional behavioral elements rather than increased consump-\ntion per se (128\u00ad130). Analysis of the factor structure of DSM-\nIII-R nicotine dependence identified two factors named \"general\ndependence\" and \"failed cessation,\" suggesting that DSM-III-R\nnicotine dependence is composed of multiple psychopharmaco-\nlogic mechanisms that may differ in strength among smokers\nAmong 15- to 54-year-old civilian, noninstitutionalized\nAmericans (n  4414) surveyed for tobacco use in the National\nComorbidity Survey in 1991, lifetime DSM-III-R nicotine de-\npendence was found at a population prevalence of 26% in men\nand 23% in women and at a higher prevalence among at least\none-time tobacco users, i.e., 33% among males and 31% among\nNational Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) data\n(n  61 426), of those who used cigarettes on a daily basis\nnicotine dependence; when grouped by cigarettes smoked per\nday, the frequency of those reporting symptoms of dependence\nsmokers (n  1006) from the Minneapolis\u00adSt. Paul area sur-\nveyed in 1982, 90% were found to qualify for DSM-III nicotine\ndependence (135).

DSM-III-R nicotine dependence occurs in 56%\nof daily smokers in an 18-year-old New Zealand sample (n \n321) and in 51% of daily smokers in a young-adult Michigan\nadolescent smokers have not been studied. While consumption\nand dependence are statistically significantly associated for all\ndrugs of abuse, tobacco is similar to cocaine and the opiates in\nterms of its addiction liability; i.e., most users are dependent, in\ncontrast to users of alcohol, amphetamines, and cannabis\n(136,184). For example, among last year users of alcohol (n \ncocaine (n  3410) in a nationally representative U.S. popula-\ncally significantly more likely to be nicotine dependent (28%)\n(184). Also, only about 6%\u00ad12% of current smokers are inter-\nmittent (never daily) smokers (139); thus, the vast majority of\ncigarette smokers are daily smokers and, of these, the majority\nare nicotine-dependent smokers by DSM-III-R or DSM-IV cri-\nteria.\nStatistically significant associations have been found in dif-\nferent young adult and adult samples between smoking and de-\npression, anxiety, and alcohol dependence. A randomized trial of\nclonidine in heavy smokers provided a provocative etiologic link\nbetween depression and smoking that led to a number of cross-\nsectional and prospective studies (140). With the use of data\nCatchment Area (NIMH-ECA) Survey, ever smoking was found\nto be statistically significantly more prevalent in those with ma-\njor depression and with DSM-III alcohol dependence (adjusted\nfor major depression) than in those with no DSM-III diagnoses\nNutrition Examination Survey and the Center for Epidemiologic\nStudies Depression (CES-D) scores, current smoking was found\nto be significantly related to CES-D score (142). In a random-\ndigit-dialing telephone study of Latinos, current smokers were\nfound to have higher mean CES-D scores and were statistically\nsignificantly more likely to have experienced depressive symp-\ntoms than never smokers (143). In a smoking-cessation study\nsample, statistically significantly more smokers scored over the\nCES-D cutoff for depression than in a general population\nsample; depressed smokers scored statistically significantly\nhigher on the FTND than those below the CES-D cutoff (144).\nECA Survey, current smoking was found to be statistically sig-\nnificantly more prevalent in those with DSM-III generalizable\nanxiety disorder and DSM-III alcohol dependence but not in\nthose with DSM-III depression. These findings could result from\na lack of power, since the prevalence of depression observed in\nthe Durham survey was half that seen in the St. Louis survey\nmaintenance organization (n  1007), smoking was found to be\nstatistically significantly associated with other drug dependen-\ncies, major depression, and anxiety disorders (146). Further-\nmore, when adjusted for the presence of depression and anxiety\ndisorders, moderate (five to six of the criteria met) but not mild\n(three to four of the criteria met) nicotine dependence was as-\nsociated with a statistically significant increase in risk for all\nother drug dependencies compared with nondependent smoking\n(138). Similarly, when adjusted for other drug dependencies,\nboth mild nicotine dependence and moderate nicotine depen-\ndence significantly elevate risk for major depression, although\nnot for any anxiety disorder (138). In a 14-month follow-up\nperiod in this young adult sample, the presence of major depres-\nsion in current smokers resulted in an increased risk of becoming\nnicotine dependent or to progress from mild to moderate nico-\nAn unresolved problem in the established association be-\ntween depression and smoking is the issue of causality, since the\npotential for self-medication or precipitation of depression on\ncessation is inherent in the modulating effects of nicotine on\nneurotransmitter systems (24). For example, tobacco smoke, but\nnot nicotine administration, statistically significantly reduces\nlevels of monoamine oxidases A and B, which are essential\nmetabolic enzymes for many neurotransmitters (148,149), sug-\ngesting that other components of tobacco smoke may have a\nsubstantial effect on synaptic dopamine concentrations (150).\nMultiple methods were used in a sample of female twins to\nassess possible causal relationships between the statistically sig-\nnificant and reciprocally associated diagnoses of nicotine depen-\ndence and major depression in co-twins and in their families\n(151). With the use of the co-twin control method that compares\nobserved and expected rate differences between monozygotic\nand dizygotic twins, observed concordances rejected a causal\nmodel for one DSM-III-R diagnosis causing the other; in con-\ntrast, either a noncausal family environment or a noncausal ge-\nnetic model fits the observed data. Modeling of genetic and\nenvironmental factors indicated a statistically significant genetic\ncorrelation between the liabilities to smoking and major depres-\nsion, with specific environmental factors affecting the liabilities\nindependently and a common environmental factor influencing\nthe liability to smoking only (151). These data suggest that com-\nmon genetic factors may contribute to both daily smoking and\nmajor depression.\nThe relationship between tobacco and alcohol use and abuse\nSmoking and alcoholism are statistically significantly associated\nin population samples; e.g., 38% of ever smokers met the defi-\nnition of DSM-III-R alcohol abuse and/or dependence versus\nonly 16% of never smokers in a young Michigan sample (154),\nwhile 20% of ever smokers met the definition of DSM-III-R\nalcohol abuse and/or dependence versus only 8% of never smok-\ners in a North Carolina NIMH-ECA sample (145). DSM-III-R-\ndefined nicotine dependence and alcohol dependence were sta-\ntistically significantly associated with each other, with the\nassociation at the same level as that with major depression and\nsignificant association between the severity of DSM-III-R alco-\nhol dependence (as defined by numbers of positive criteria) and\nnicotine dependence (as defined by FTQ score) was observed in\na clinical (alcohol treatment) population where 88% of the al-\ncohol-dependent individuals are current smokers and 92% of\nthese smokers are defined as nicotine dependent by FTQ score\nModeling of the statistically significant associations between\nalcohol use disorders and nicotine dependence in a university-\nbased sample followed prospectively for 7 years, with individual\ndiagnostic data and family history interview data, supports both\nreciprocal influence and common vulnerability models (158).\nModeling of joint alcohol and tobacco use in a twin sample\nconsisting of two age groups found that shared environmental\nfactors are most important in early use (ages 12\u00ad16 years) and\nthat genetic factors are more important in later use (ages 17\u00ad25\nyears) (99). More important, the shared correlation for the effect\nof genetic factors, which explain approximately 50% of the al-\ncohol use and 50% of the tobacco use in older adolescents and\nyoung adults, is nearly unity, suggesting that substantially the\nsame genetic factors are operating in this sample to influence\nboth alcohol and tobacco use (99). With the use of the NAS-\nNRC World War II Twin Registry to investigate the genetic\neffects on multiple substance use, a twin model with a common\ngenetic pathway to tobacco, alcohol, and coffee use, with no\nenvironmental effects and separate pathways with both genetic\nand shared environmental effects for each substance, provided\nthe best fit to the data (159). Most of the genetic effect on\ntobacco consumption was found in the common genetic path-\nway, and most of the genetic effects on alcohol and coffee con-\nsumption were found in substance-specific pathways. Regres-\nsion analysis of heavy consumers of the three substances in the\nNAS-NRC Twin Registry found two independent latent factors,\none underlying heavy smoking and heavy alcohol use and one\nunderlying heavy smoking and heavy coffee drinking (160).\nSeparate factors contributing to the comorbidity of alcohol and\nnicotine dependence and to the comorbidity of nicotine depen-\ndence and coffee drinking may reflect independent regulation of\nthe multiple pharmacologic effects of nicotine and the paired\nPrevalence surveys indicate that some demographic vari-\nables--sex, age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES)--are\nconsistently associated with cigarette smoking. Specifically,\nmale sex, younger age, lower SES, and lower educational at-\ntainment are positively associated with current smoking preva-\nlence, while Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander ethnicity is\nnegatively associated with current smoking prevalence\ntween educational attainment and smoking prevalence is consis-\ntently observed in diverse population samples in the United\nStates (163), some non-U.S. populations show a reverse asso-\nciation, e.g., among females in Italy (164).\ncurrent smoking prevalence among adults less than 65 years of\nage has decreased in every demographic category except those\nwith less than 12 years of education (9). In those adults greater\nthan or equal to 65 years of age, stable to increased rates of\ncurrent smoking are observed in those with less than 12 years of\neducation, in women, and in African-Americans (9). The quit\nratio, defined as (former smokers)/(ever smokers), has increased\nin all groups; however, the rate of increase of the quit ratio has\nbeen slower in adults 65 years old or older. Combined with the\npostwar demographic bulge, the absolute number of older cur-\nrent smokers continues to increase despite a long-term decrease\nThe relationship between SES and smoking is complex, in-\nvolving a number of related factors. The statistically signifi-\ncantly increased risk of smoking prevalence in those below the\npoverty threshold (14) is concordant with a statistically signifi-\ncantly increased risk for the opportunity of exposure to tobacco\nproducts over the age period 6\u00ad13 years because of neighbor-\nhood disadvantage, at least in Baltimore (MD) (165). In this\nsame city, reduced levels of parental monitoring [statistically\nsignificantly associated with male sex of the child, reduced ed-\nucational achievement, and a history of psychiatric disorder in\nmothers (166)] are statistically significantly associated with in-\ncreased risk of smoking initiation (167). Cigarette acceptability\nand accessibility were the only school and neighborhood mea-\nsures statistically significantly associated with cigarette smoking\nrates in a study of Midwestern elementary schools (168). How-\never, neighborhood disadvantage is not always associated with\nincreased rates of cigarette smoking; adjusted for attitude toward\nsubstance use and availability (including cigarettes), neighbor-\nhoods with lower population density, suggesting economic ad-\nvantage, had higher rates of lifetime cigarette use in this Mid-\nIntensive marketing of tobacco products has likely played an\nimportant role in establishing the prevalence of smoking ob-\nserved today. Targeted promotion may be responsible for a men-\nthol cigarette brand being the most prevalent brand among Af-\nrican-American smokers and for brand recognition among\nzine, endorsement of cigar use by celebrities, and marketing to\nhigh SES consumers may have reversed a 20-year decline in\ncigar consumption, the beginning of which coincided with ad-\nThere is evidence, however, that a number of social environ-\nmental factors, especially at the regulatory level, have been\nworking to decrease the prevalence of smoking. Increasing so-\ncietal disapproval of smoking since the 1964 Surgeon General's\nReport (173) has resulted in workplace regulation of smoking,\namong other antismoking sanctions (174). However, a national\nported by workers themselves observed statistically significantly\ndifferent levels of workplace smoking restrictions by sex, age,\nsmoking status, and occupation of the worker (175). These dif-\nferences found between these sociodemographic factors and\nworkplace smoking restrictions parallel differences in smoking\nprevalence by sex, age, and educational attainment. Recent U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration regulations and measures in-\ncluded in the first states' attorneys' general tobacco settlement\nwere designed to modify the marketing behavior of the tobacco\ncompanies to susceptible youth populations and to contribute to\nsmoking cessation programs (176,177). Analysis of media cam-\npaigns designed to reduce smoking initiation and to increase\nsmoking cessation has demonstrated statistically significant as-\nsociations between targeted media and reduced rates of smoking\nin adolescent females (178). A combination of a large state tax\nincrease and tobacco control measures that included prevention,\ncessation, and environmental tobacco smoke programs was as-\nsociated with an increased average quarterly decline in cigarette\nsales, during a period in which average levels of educational\nattainment and income were decreasing (179).\nSUMMARY\nThe estimated number of worldwide current smokers of both\nsexes in 1996 exceeded one billion individuals (20). Research\ninto smoking behavior and pharmacology has established that\nmost smokers are smoking to maintain nicotine levels (30,45).\nRecent neurobiologic research (24) has established the proxi-\nmate molecular neurobiologic substrate of the mechanism that\nmaintains nicotine addiction. Nicotine dependence is signifi-\ncantly associated with substance abuse, anxiety disorders, and\ngenetic and environmental factors affecting smoking initiation,\ncurrent smoking, and persistence reveals that heritability is\nstable and more important than environmental factors (96).\nHowever, major secular changes in smoking prevalence support\nstrong effects of environmental determinants on smoking behav-\nior (175), as do consistent demographic predictors such as edu-\ncational attainment in the United States (13).\nNicotine dependence, major depression, and alcohol depen-\ndence are the three most prevalent specific psychiatric diagnoses\nin population samples in the United States, while substance\nabuse, anxiety disorders, and affective disorders are the three\nmost prevalent diagnostic categories (132,180). Nicotine depen-\ndence is significantly associated with each of these three cat-\negories, an example of the striking concentration of psychiatric\ncomorbidity in approximately one sixth of the U.S. population\n(180). The increased severity of nicotine dependence within the\nU.S. smoking population (118) and among those with psychiat-\nric comorbidity (181) suggests that smoking cessation programs\nmay be negatively affected (182), as has been observed\n(141,144). While it is the contamination of the nicotine delivery\ndevice with carcinogens, carbon monoxide, and cytotoxic com-\npounds that is the probable source of the attributable risk from\nsmoking in cancer and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases,\nan improved understanding of the neurobiologic mechanisms\nthat maintain nicotine dependence may provide the basis for\nreducing morbidity and mortality, through improved smoking\ncessation therapies. Methods to incorporate covariates known to\nbe significantly associated with smoking prevalence and behav-\nior, including age, sex, SES, psychiatric history, and previously\nidentified genetic loci, should be used in future candidate gene\nstudies. Research sample design and future analyses of the\nsmoking phenotype must address the consistent, statistically sig-\nnificant risks due to demographic, psychiatric, and genetic fac-\ntors to improve our understanding of the socioeconomic, psy-\nchosocial, and neurobiologic bases of this behavior.\nREFERENCES\n(1) Peto R, Lopez AD, Boreham J, Thun M, Heath C Jr. Mortality from\ntobacco in developed countries: indirect estimation from national vital\n(2) Cigarette brand use among adult smokers--United States, 1986.
