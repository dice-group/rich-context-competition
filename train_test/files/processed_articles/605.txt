Introduction\nIn 1969, Norman Bradburn showed that positive and negative affect are two separate, but\ninter-connected emotions with moderate negative associations [1,2]. Positive affect and emotions\ninclude happiness, joy, contentment, interest and love [3\u00ad7]; negative affect and emotions include\nsadness, guilt, fear, anger, and disgust [8\u00ad10]. While positive affect promotes health [11] and reduces\nrisk of mortality [12] via better psychological adjustment [13], negative affect increases risk of chronic\ndisease [14] as well as mortality [15] via vigilance, threat [16], and an unhealthy lifestyle [17].\nPositive affect, a predictor of creation [18] and openness [19], is linked to lower autonomic\nreactivity [20] and better physical and mental health [21]. Constant high levels of negative affect,\nhowever, predisposes individuals to emotional and health problems [8\u00ad10]. The overall role of\nnegative affect as a common risk factor for a wide range of emotional and psychiatric disorders, such\nas anxiety and depression, is well established, and may partially explain why several disorders tend to\nIn addition to their physical health effects [23], positive and negative affect have major implications\nfor diagnosis of mood disorders, particularly depression [24]. Positive and negative emotions compose\nmajor factors in mood disorders such as depression [25\u00ad27] and bipolar disorder [28]. As racial groups\ndiffer in their tendency to experience or express positive and negative affect [29,30], there is a need for\ncross-racial studies that compare racial groups for association between positive and negative affect [31\u00ad38].\nWhether or not race alters simultaneous experience and presentation of positive and negative affect\nis still unknown [29,30]. While some studies have suggested that the factorial structure of depression\nscales is invariant across racial groups [39\u00ad41], other studies have shown that the degree by which\npositive and negative affect correlate may depend on race and ethnicity [29,42,43]. While there is an\nongoing debate whether or not positive and negative affect similarly represent depression among Whites\nand Blacks [38\u00ad41,44\u00ad50], there are studies showing higher reliability of negative affect despite lower\nreliability of depression measures for Blacks compared to Whites [40,41,44]. Thus, positive and negative\naffect domains may differently compose the presentation of depression for Blacks and Whites [39].\nIn a recent study by Moazen-Zadeh and Assari, the item loading for the item \"I was happy\"\nto the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) measure was 0.68 and -0.66\nrespectively for Blacks and Whites [29]. In another study, by Assari et al., negative affect showed\nstronger correlations with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)-based diagnosis of\nclinical depression in Blacks compared to Whites, while positive affect was similarly linked to MDD\nacross race groups [45]. A national study found considerable variation in item loadings of the CES-D\nscale between Blacks and Whites. While negative affect items showed a better loading for Blacks, the\npositive affect items better loaded for Whites [5]. Canady et al. observed that the positive item \"was\nhappy\" had different loadings on a depression scale between Blacks and Whites [43]. All these studies\nsuggest that positive and negative affect may differently correlate between Blacks and Whites. These\nfindings may help us better understand why correlates of depression and affect vary for Whites and\nBlacks [51\u00ad53], and why Blacks, who report higher levels of depressive symptoms (negative affect), do\nnot endorse DSM criteria for the clinical disorder [29,45,54].\nWhile positive and negative affect are main factors in several depression scales [41,49,50,55],\ndifferent populations may differ in how they experience or express positive and negative affect\nsimultaneously [41,55]. Considering the gap in the literature on racial and ethnic variation in the\nneeded on moderating effects of race and ethnicity on the reciprocal links between positive and\nWe conducted the current study on racial differences in the bidirectional links between positive\nand negative affect, using a national sample of adults in the United States.\n2. Methods\nThis longitudinal study used data from MIDUS (http://midus.wisc.edu), a 10 year longitudinal\nadults (aged 25 to 74). The study was carried out by the MacArthur Midlife Research Network.\nThe main purpose of the study was to understand the role of psychosocial factors in age related\nvariation in physical and mental health over the life course [58\u00ad62].\n2.2. Data Collection\nThe survey used a multimodal data collection strategy, which was composed of a\ncomputer-assisted personal interview (CAPI), a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI), a\nmail questionnaire, a telephone interview, and a face-to-face interview. First, the study employed an\ninitial 30-minute phone interview followed by a set (two) of self-administered questionnaires (SAQs).\nSAQs were mailed to individuals who completed the phone interview [58\u00ad62].\nThe study protocol was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (IRB),\nand written informed consent was obtained for all participants. The study was funded by the National\nInstitute on Aging (NIA). Monetary incentives were given at both Wave 1 and Wave 2 for compensation\n(US $20 for completion of MIDUS 1 surveys and up to US $60 for completion of MIDUS 2 surveys).\n2.4. Participants and Sampling\nThe study used random digit dialing (RDD), which is a method for selecting people for\ninvolvement in telephone statistical surveys by generating telephone numbers at random in order\nto enroll a random sample of adults. The national RDD survey used telephone numbers within\nthe continental United States as the sampling frame. The study used an oversampling in five cities\n(related to geographic-specific agendas), resulting in a baseline RDD sample of 4244 individuals. The\nsibling sample was then generated by a random selection of 529 cases from the RDD sample that had at\nleast one sibling. Limited to siblings within a family that had the same biological mother and father, the\nstudy collected data from 950 siblings. The study also enrolled a twin sample, which used a two-part\nsampling design. The first part involved screening a representative national sample of approximately\n50,000 households for the presence of a twin (as part of ongoing national omnibus surveys). The second\npart involved contacting the twin households and attempting to recruit twins (also aged 25\u00ad74) to\nparticipate in the survey. Cooperating twins were asked to provide contact information for their\nindividuals were neither Whites nor Blacks, this study only included 5921 White and Black individuals.\nData collection of wave 1 was conducted in 1995 and 1996. The follow-up data collection was\nconducted in 2004 and 2005. Advance letters with an accompanying brochure were sent to all Time-1\nparticipants, to remind them about their past participation and to inform them that an interviewer\nwill contact them for the initial telephone survey in near future. After a phone interview, which lasted\n30 min on average, participants received two SAQs via mail [58\u00ad62].\nFrom the total 7108 participants who were enrolled at baseline (completing the phone survey at\n75% in the MIDUS (adjusted for mortality). Major causes for non-participation at MIDUS 2 included\nrefusal (12%), could not be contacted (10%), too ill to be interviewed (8%), or deceased [58\u00ad62].\nPredictor variables were those prominent in published research on survey participation and\nretention, including 7 core demographic variables and 10 physical health variables from either the\nbaseline telephone interview or the SAQ.\n2.7. Demographic Characteristics\nDemographic variables were collected at baseline in 1995 and included age (continuous), gender\n(0 = male (reference group), 1 = female), and race (0 = Whites (reference group), 1 = Blacks).\nSocioeconomic status. Socio-economic variables included educational level (1 = less than high\nschool, 2 = high school graduate or equivalent, 3 = some college, 4 = college graduate or more) and\npersonal income. Both variables were operationalized as continuous measures.\nPhysical Health. The following physical health variables were included in the study: self-rated\nhealth (SRH) (1 = worst, 10 = best), number of chronic medical conditions (CMC), and body mass\nindex (BMI). All measures were treated as continuous measures. While a higher score indicated better\nSRH, higher scores for CMC and BMI reflected worse health.\nPositive affect. Using a scale developed by Mroczek and Kolarz (1998), [63] positive affect was\nassessed using six items referring to the question: \"During the past 30 days, how much of the time did\nyou feel . . . \" Items included \"cheerful\", \"in good spirits\", \"extremely happy\", \"calm and peaceful\",\n\"satisfied\", and \"full of life\". Responses ranged from 1 (all of the time) to 5 (none of the time) for\neach item [63]. Mean positive affect scores were computed if at least one of the affect items were\ncompleted. Greater scores reflected more positive affect, with possible scores ranging from 1 to 5.\nInternal consistency (reliability) was very good ( = 0.91 for all, 0.91 for Whites, 0.92 for Blacks). Other\nNegative affect. Using a scale developed by Mroczek and Kolarz (1998), [63] negative affect was\nassessed in response to six items referring to the question: \"During the past 30 days, how much of\nthe time did you feel . . . \" Negative affect items included \"so sad\", \"nervous\", \"restless or fidgety\",\n\"hopeless\", \"worthless\", and \"everything was an effort\". Responses ranged from 1 (all of the time) to 5\n(none of the time) [63]. Mean negative affect scores were computed if at least one of the affect items\nwere completed. Greater scores reflected more negative affect, with possible scores ranging from 1 to 5.\nInternal consistency (reliability) was excellent ( = 0.86 for all, 0.86 for Whites, 0.87 for Blacks). Other\n2.8. Statistical Note\nWe used SPSS 20.0 for Windows (IBM Inc. Armonk, NY, USA) for data analysis. For univariate\nanalysis we reported frequencies, percentages, and mean (standard deviations) in the pooled sample,\nas well as based on race. For bivariate associations, we used independent sample t test, chi square test,\nas well as Pearson correlation test. For multivariable analysis, we ran a series of linear regressions in the\npooled sample, with positive and negative affect as independent and dependent variables, respectively.\nIn our first models, only demographics and socio-economics were controlled for. Subsequently, we\ncontrolled for health factors. First, we ran models without the interaction term. Then, we added the\nrace by affect interaction term. We ran models with wave 1 and wave 2 positive and negative affect\nas outcomes. In the next step, we ran models stratified based on race. Unstandardized regression\ncoefficient (b), standard error (SE), 95% Confidence Intervals (CI), and p values were reported.\n3. Results\nTable 1 presents the results of descriptive analysis in the pooled sample and also based on race.\nCompared to Whites, Blacks were younger, more frequently women, and had lower education and\nincome. Blacks had worse CMC, SRH and BMI compared to Whites. Blacks also had higher positive\naffect at baseline compared to Whites. Blacks and Whites were similar in negative affect at baseline.\nTable 2 presents the correlation matrix of the study variables in Whites and Blacks. While positive\naffect in wave 1 and 2 were correlated in both racial groups, the magnitude of the correlation between\npositive and negative affect were stronger for Whites than Blacks. Age was correlated with wave\n1 positive and negative affect in Whites but not Blacks. Education and income also showed better\ncorrelations with wave 1 and wave 2 positive and negative affect in Whites than Blacks.\nTable 3a summarizes the results of four linear regression models to test the effects of negative\naffect in wave 1 on positive affect in wave 1. Model 1-a only included demographic and socioeconomic\nfactors without any interaction term. Model 2-a included demographic and socioeconomic factors,\nhowever also added the race by negative affect in wave 1 interaction term. Model 3-a included health\nfactors as controls with no interaction term. Model 4-a included health factors as controls, with race by\nnegative affect in wave 1 interaction term.

Discussion\nIn our study, Black and White Americans differed in the magnitude of the inverse correlation\nbetween positive and negative affect at baseline and over time. According to our study, the negative\nassociation between positive and negative affect was weaker for Black compared to White Americans.\nThese differential correlations remained significant at baseline and over time, net of demographic,\nsocioeconomic, and health status.\nOur finding of a stronger link between positive and negative affect among White compared to\nBlack Americans is consistent with previous findings showing weaker negative association between\ndepressive symptoms and hopefulness among Whites than Blacks [67]. In the presence of similar\ndepressive symptoms, Blacks maintain higher levels of hope than Whites, [67] and Blacks who endorse\nhigh negative affect maintain high positive affect as well. Black-White differences also exist in the\nmagnitude of correlation between depression and evaluation of self [68]. Negative affect and depressive\nsymptoms differently negative feelings and cognitions about self in Whites and Blacks [68]. The weaker\neffects of depression and depressive symptoms on physical health outcomes, such as incident chronic\ndisease [69] and all-cause [70] and disease specific chronic disease [71], in Whites than Blacks are\nalso known. In one study, depressive symptoms predicted future clinical depression in Whites\nbut not Blacks [30], and in another study, race altered how depressive symptoms map on clinical\nCanady et al. found the item \"I was happy\" as the only item with different loadings between\nBlacks and Whites after applying the cross-group constraints [43]. In a recent study, Assari and\nMoazen-Zadeh found differences for several positive affect items, including the item \"I was happy,\"\non a depression scale for Blacks and Whites. The study showed worse item loadings for positive items,\nnamely \"as good\" and \"hopeful,\" in Blacks than Whites. In the final model with a very good fit to the\ndata, the item \"as good\" showed poor loading for Whites and Blacks, however, the item \"hopeful\"\nshowed good loading for Whites but poor loading for Blacks [42].\nA recent body of evidence has shown major racial differences in socioeconomic and health\ncorrelates of negative emotions [51\u00ad53]. Negative emotions better predict medical conditions, obesity,\nand mortality in Whites than Blacks [52,53]. Based on Black-White health paradox, defined as\nless frequent depression despite a higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions among Blacks\ncompared to Whites [54,72\u00ad82], adversities and negative emotions are more common among Blacks [69].\nOur findings may explain why emotional disorders are not as common as expected in Blacks.\nAccording to the \"undoing hypothesis,\" positive emotions are able to undo the harmful effects\nof negative emotions [5,7]. Maintaining higher levels of positive affect in the presence of negative\naffect in Blacks compared to Whites may explain the weaker effects of negative emotions on physical\nhealth of Blacks. In this view, positive affect operates as a buffer against harms associated with\nnegative affect [7,20]. This phenomenon can explain why depressive symptoms predict incident\nchronic disease [69] and mortality [52,53] for Whites but not Blacks. Inflammation also better correlates\nwith depression for Blacks than Whites [81,82]. This finding can also explain why depressive symptoms\npredict subsequent MDD among Whites but not Blacks [29]. This phenomenon may also explain\nwhy Blacks report better well-being (positive affect) than Whites, despite higher levels of stress,\npsychological distress, and depressive symptoms [83].\nOur findings are in support of the literature that suggests positive and negative affect are\nseparate but interconnected components of depression measurement, among both Blacks and\nWhites [25\u00ad27,44,84]. While this study investigated positive and negative emotions, there is a need to\nexplore racial differences in correlations between emotions and other domains of depression such as\nsomatic complaints and interpersonal problems [85\u00ad88]. Future research may also test if resources and\nassets such as self-esteem, social support, religion, or culture explain Black-White variation in the link\nbetween positive and negative affect.\nOur findings on Black-White differences in the link between positive and negative affect have\nmajor implications for measurement of depression and depressive symptoms in ethnically diverse\npopulations. Clinicians and researchers who work with racially diverse populations should be aware\nof race-specific links between positive and negative emotions. Compared to their White counterparts,\nBlacks with depression may endorse higher levels of positive affect, which may reduce chance of\ndiagnosis of depression. We argue that positive and negative items of depression should not be simply\nsummed among diverse populations. Instead, positive and negative domains should be considered\nas inter-connected but separate domains across racial groups. Domain-specific evaluation of mood\nmay be a better option than calculating a sum score of positive and negative items. Considering such\ncross-ethnic variations may help with more accurate diagnosis and treatment of depression among\nOur findings also have implications for epidemiological studies of depression across various racial\ngroups. The differential link between positive and negative affect based on race causes measurement\nbias for cross-racial measurement of mood outcomes, including but not limited to depression. Programs\nthat screen ethnically diverse samples for depression or depressive symptomatology should be aware\nof how race alters the concordance of positive and negative affect. There is still a need for further\nresearch on equivalence of depression, affect, and mood measurement among diverse racial and ethnic\ngroups [51,90,91]. Future research should focus on cross-racial validation of measures of depression.\nOur study is subject to at least three limitations. The major limitation of this study was not\nmeasuring culture [92,93]. Second, we did not include clinical diagnosis of MDD according to the\nDSM criteria (composite international diagnostic interview criteria were used). Third, we did not\nconsider race by gender differences in this study. Despite how the race by gender intersection may\nshape experience and expression of positive and negative emotions [94], limited sample size of Blacks\ndid not allow us to break our sample of Blacks to additional sub-groups. Despite this limitation, a\nunique strength of our study was using nationally representative data of American adults that resulted\nin nationally generalizable findings to the U.S. population.\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that positive and negative affect have a weaker negative\nassociation in Blacks than Whites, suggesting that in the presence of similar negative affect, Blacks\nmaintain higher levels of positive affect than Whites. These findings have health implications given the\nprotective effect of positive affect (the \"undoing hypothesis\"). It is unknown whether racial differences\nin the magnitude of the correlation between positive and negative affect explains previously observed\nBlack-White differences in psychosocial and medical correlates of depression. In addition, these\nfindings are also important for measurement of depression. This finding calls into question the\nmeasurement equivalence of affect, mood, and depression outcomes among Blacks and Whites.\n5. Conclusions\nIn summary, positive and negative affect are more concurrent in Blacks compared to Whites. This\nfinding has implications for cross-racial measurement of affect and mood, including depression.\nThis information may have implications for diagnosis and screening of depression in racially\ndiverse populations.\n"
