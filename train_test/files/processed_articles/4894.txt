Thus, this research,\nunlike most studies in the subfield, relies on lengthy panel\ndata to identify the origins of political intolerance by the\nsame individuals, and across three lineage generations (see\nAppendix A for wave panel summary). From this vantage\npoint, it is possible to compare the political intolerance atti-\ntudes of today with those of the past, and as a result, it is\npossible to speak confidently about trends in intolerance that\nresult from life cycle, generational, or period effects. The\nevidence can be used to enlighten the debate about the\ndynamics that are associated with intergenerational mainte-\nnance, acquisition, and reduction of intolerant beliefs.\nA second objective is to see how well Sullivan, Marcus,\nFeldman, and Piereson's (1981) model of generic tolerance\nwould perform when applied to the narrower question of the\nsources of intolerance toward a specific civil liberties dis-\npute: allowing a suspected communist the opportunity to run\nfor elected office. Although a number of studies examine\n\"focused intolerance\" toward specific target groups, none\nuses longitudinal data and so are limited in their ability to\nexamine the relative impact of the key predictors on one's\nwillingness to extend civil liberties over time. Because a\nstrategy employed here is to determine whether the genera-\ntions are more alike or unalike, and why, we examine the\ninfluence of the social, psychological, and political predic-\ntors and the presence of intolerance for each generation. Of\nimportance here is the extent to which changes in an indi-\nvidual's environment may create instability in attitudes, and\nwhich environmental factors significantly contribute to the\nchange.\nNot surprisingly, Stouffer's (1955) benchmark study dis-\ncovered great intolerance among theAmerican public toward\ncommunists, socialists, and atheists in the 1950s. However,\nas documented by the work of Nunn et al. (1978), intolerance\ntoward communists had dropped considerably by the 1970s.\nThe impact of this seminal study led many scholars to con-\nclude that tolerance in general, not just toward communists,\nin America had increased. Yet, Mondak and Sanders (2003)\nclaimed that the increase in tolerance was not wholly the\nconsequence of a general increase but in part reflective of\nchanges in group-specific attitudes. While it may well be the\ncase that communists were the least-liked group for most\nAmericans in the 1950s, that was coupled with high levels of\nintolerance for that particular group, the political context of\nthat time period was substantially different from the one that\nprevailed in the 1970s. It was argued, that most Americans\nwere still willing to deny political rights to disliked groups in\nthe 1970s; it was just that Americans' dislike of communists\nThe advantage of our approach is that it can explore the\nimpact of important contextual factors that condition an indi-\nvidual's intolerance toward communists spanning a 32-year\nperiod. It is not possible to obtain these results in prior stud-\nies and consequently, our findings shed new light on the vari-\nous ways these variables influence intolerance in a given\ncontext. In this way, investigating \"focused intolerance\"\ntoward a specific group provides a stringent \"test\" of the\ngeneralizability of the sources of intolerance to a very differ-\nent history era and political context (Peffley & Sigelman,\nThe results of this research, thus, present both unique and\nvaluable contributions to the study of political tolerance. In\nshort, we move beyond the common approach of focusing on\nwhy aggregations of individual attitudes vary over time and\nacross cohorts and instead explain why attitudes vary across\nindividuals. Unlike other studies of political tolerance, we\nhave the added advantage of \"before\" and \"after\" measures\nand lengthy panel data. Specifically, the research design\nencourages an effort to examine the relative impact of the\npredictors to intolerance for allowing a suspected communist\nto hold public office and to assess the consequences of how\nchanges in these determinants affect some of our most funda-\nmental hypotheses about the origins of intolerance.\nGiven the importance of intolerance from both a scholarly\n(Peffley & Sigelman, 1990) and a historical perspective\nwithin the United States, the ability to study the determinants\nof intolerance toward communists across time by the same\nindividuals provides a unique opportunity to help us under-\nstand attitudinal stability and discontinuity including the\nsources of change. Because we know very little about how\nstable intolerance beliefs are, and the extent to which the pre-\ndictors are relevant over an individual's life course, the\nobjective here is to provide a long-term examination that\nexplores age, period, and cohort variations in a specific civil\nliberties dispute. By considering attitude change in trends for\nwhether a suspected communist should be able to hold public\noffice, we contribute both to the literature on tolerance and\non social change more broadly.\nKey Concept\nPolitical Tolerance\nPeople are tolerant to the extent that they are willing to grant\nthe full rights of citizenship uniformly and without excep-\ntion. The general literature on democracy and political toler-\nance suggests one requirement is a dedication to the \"rules of\nthe democratic game and a willingness to apply them\nequally\" (Sullivan et al., 1982, p. 2). It follows that people\nare intolerant provided that they advocate any restriction of\npolitical acts that are otherwise permissible under law (Bobo\nTetlock, 1991); that is, any deviation from the commitment\nto the rights and liberties of others reflects some degree of\nTherefore, persons are considered intolerant to the extent\nthat they are prepared to refuse the legally recognized right to\nrun for office. Although there is no constitutional right to hold\nClark et al. 3\npublic office per se, there is support in extant research (e.g.,\nSanders, 2003) suggesting such a measure is pertinent to toler-\nance in the sense that it implicitly taps into a fundamental right\nguaranteed in a democracy. Tolerance requires that individuals\nrespect the right of people to express different views, and the\ndenial of the right to seek office to members of ideological\ngroups directly violates their right \"to try to win majority sup-\ndenying a suspected communist the opportunity to hold elected\noffice unequivocally measures intolerance.\nThe earliest empirical study of tolerance (Stouffer, 1955)\nutilized a similar measure designed to examine the extent to\nwhich Americans were prepared to extend procedural rights\nto groups on the left. It should come as no surprise that in the\n1950s, communists were cited as one of the most commonly\ndisliked groups in America. As such, virtually all Americans\nsupported depriving admitted communists of at least some of\ntheir political and civil liberties (Stouffer, 1955).1 Although\nopposition to communists may have decreased since the\n1950s, recent research suggests that they remain on the radar\nof most Americans and are not well liked in the United\nmunists rank as the sixth most commonly disliked groups in\nAmerica today, with about one in five Americans putting\ncommunists on their list of the three most disliked groups.\nMoreover, only 5.2% of the respondents expressed any\ndegree of positive affect toward communists as compared\nwith the 73.4% who disliked them. In short, it is clear that\nthere still remains a considerable amount of animus toward\ncommunists in the United States.\nAge\u00adPeriod\u00adCohort\nIn our approach, it is possible to compare the political intol-\nerance attitudes of three generations over time and as a result,\nit is possible to identify continuity and discontinuity arising\nfrom generational effects, life-cycle effects, and period\neffects. A cohort explanation argues that differences in atti-\ntudes are due to the social and cultural climate prevailing so\nthat members of a generation share the same formative\nexperiences, distinctive from the experiences of their adja-\ncent counterparts (Jennings & Niemi, 1981; Mannheim,\npolitical times shape the youth's first political experiences\nthat influence them for a lifetime. In contrast, an age or life-\ncycle explanation argues that distinctive patterns in attitudes\nare due to position in the life cycle (Mayer, 1992); that is,\nrespondents, regardless of cohort placement, will have simi-\nlar attitudes while in their youth, middle age, or when elderly.\nIt is also possible however, that political climate affects the\npublic at large so that attitudinal changes reflect period\neffects. Period or historical effects have a roughly common\nimpact on all or most segments of society (Mannheim,\nThere have been many suggestions in the literature that\nyounger people typically are more tolerant than older people.\nThis was originally attributed to a life-cycle effect, that is,\nthe tendency for people to become less tolerant as they age\nfound no evidence of this aging effect and indicate instead a\ngenerational effect so that recent cohorts are not only more\ntolerant than earlier cohorts but tend to remain so as they\nWilson, 1994). Overall, the picture emerging is one where\ntolerance attitudes are invariably the result of generational\nrather than life-cycle effects; because of their particular\nresearch design, however, these studies cannot answer ques-\ntions such as why individuals may be more tolerant as com-\npared with similarly situated individuals in the previous or\nlater generation, or how those tolerant and intolerant attitudes\ndevelop and change over the life cycle.\nThe basic problem in assessing age, period, and cohort\neffects is that two of the basic effects (either age and cohort,\nperiod and cohort, or age and period) are confounded. When\nolder persons are shown to be more conservative than\nyounger persons, this may result from aging but also from\nthe confounding effects of cohort (generational) differences\nin socialization. Thus, any inferences about the effect of age\nchanges on political attitudes derived from cross-sectional\nstudies must be viewed with considerable reservation. Unlike\nother studies of political tolerance, we have the advantage of\nlengthy panel data.\nIn the following section, we will begin with a discussion\nof several hypotheses regarding explanations of individual\nchange and a review of evidence pertaining to several central\nissues that arise from these hypotheses. The main question is\nto what extent, age, cohort, period, and individual character-\nistics contribute to the longitudinal explanation of intoler-\nance regarding the right of a suspected communist to hold\npublic office? This discussion provides the theoretical basis\nfor our presentation of findings. Next, we will describe the\ndata and measures used to test these hypotheses. In the final\nsection, we will present and discuss the results of our\nanalyses.\nExplanations of Change\nIn comparing generations with each other and with them-\nselves over time, one must be aware of four types of phe-\nnomena: (a) continuity and discontinuity as a function of (b)\nlife-cycle effects, (c) generational effects, and (d) period\neffects. It is important to distinguish between these three pro-\ncesses, because each has important and differing implica-\ntions for the shape of intolerant opinions.\nHypotheses\nThere have been many suggestions in the literature that age\nor life-cycle processes are important to attitude formation\n4 SAGE Open\nand change. Life-cycle effects represent differences attribut-\nable to aging-related developmental changes in the life\ncourse. In the \"conventional lifecycle effects model\" the\nresearch should demonstrate movement by the younger gen-\neration to the older one in which change in the older genera-\ntion has stopped (Jennings & Stoker, 2004). Accordingly, our\nfirst hypothesis is as follows:\nHypothesis 1 (H1): If intolerance represents a life-cycle\neffect, age-related patterns and changes will be marked by\nthe younger cohort (Gen 2) showing similar intolerance of\na communist officeholder as the parent cohort (Gen 1) at\nthe same point in the life cycle.2\nA related argument is the \"age-stability hypothesis\" that\nclaims that people change their minds little as they age\nhypothesis has been supported with respect to many social\nattitudes (see, for example, Cutler & Kaufman, 1975; Davis,\ntion is that as individuals' age and move through various\nstages of life, their attitudes become more stable over time.\nThe stability grows out of a learning process marked by\nhabituation and hardening through exposure and usage\n(Jennings & Markus, 1984). If the fact that attitude inconsis-\ntency is more prone to occur in the young, but as the indi-\nvidual ages, attitude stability increases, then the evidence\nsuggests that there is a highly formative stage in young adult-\nhood after which time the person becomes more resistant to\nenvironmental pressures that affect attitude change.\nGiven these considerations, our second hypothesis is for-\nmulated as follows:\nHypothesis 2 (H2): The second generation, given its\nposition in the life cycle, will exhibit less aggregate attitu-\ndinal stability than their parents.\nHowever, as the younger cohort ages and life experiences\nchange less, the expectation is that political intolerance atti-\ntudes will become increasingly stable up through middle age.\nThe assumption is that as they pass through time, the young\nwill demonstrate similar levels of attitudinal stability to that\nof their parents (or at least to the point at which the older\ngeneration was when it was in that age bracket).\nIn contrast, a generational explanation argues that differ-\nences in attitudes are due to the social and cultural climate\nprevailing so that members of a generation share the same\nexperiences, distinctive from the experiences of their adja-\ncent counterparts (Jennings & Niemi, 1981; Mannheim,\ncohort is uniquely socialized by a set of historical events.\nThe usual assumption is that certain events in history make\nan indelible imprint on the young, whereas older individuals\nare better equipped to resist its influence by their previous\nlife experiences. Studies of young adults during the volatile\nronments induced new political orientations.\nThere are valid reasons for expecting generational differ-\nences for intolerance. It has often been suggested that because\nof the unique experiences with communism during their\nimpressionable years, the parent generation will be more\nintolerant whereas their offspring (Gen 2), whose formative\npolitical experiences consisted of the Civil Rights Movement\nand the Vietnam War, will hold less repressive tendencies. In\nparticular, it is believed that the younger generation, having\nreached adolescence during \"the 1960s\" will carry with them\na permanent \"liberal\" tilt that could have serious conse-\nquences for political intolerance (J. A. Davis, 2004).\nIf correct, we hypothesize the following:\nHypothesis 3 (H3): The second generation is least likely\nto display political intolerance.\nRelated, we also surmise that intolerance should follow\nthe expected route, and so we contend the following:\nHypothesis 4 (H4): The most recent cohort (Gen 3, chil-\ndren born of the second generation) should exhibit less\nintolerance than their grandparents (Gen 1) but more\nintolerance than their parents (Gen 2), the young adults of\nFrom this perspective, the unique events occurring in the\nsecond generation apart from their parents and children.\nEvidence, however, suggests that strong political shocks\ncan affect young and old alike and leave a permanent\nimprint on one's attitudes and opinions. In situations where\nthe effects of contemporary societal circumstances reflect a\nmore uniform change, regardless of age, we tend to classify\nthem as period effects. Period effects can produce both\nindividual and aggregate change, often quickly and endur-\ningly, without any age-related differences. The sharp drop\nple, was almost entirely this sort of period effect, as\nAmericans of all ages changed their minds about their lead-\ners' trustworthiness.3\nWe can also expect some period effects. The third set of\narguments suggests that there will be a gradual improvement\nfor both Gen 1 and Gen 2 over time as the context in the\ncountry has gradually changed. Since the 1950s, intolerance\nof communists has waned considerably (see Nunn et al.,\nity toward the Soviet Union and communists began to soften\nsomewhat and polls showed less opposition to communism\nand greater tolerance for allowing a communist to speak in\nperiod of conservatism that rose to dominance when Ronald\nReagan became president and was accompanied by a belief\nthat the Soviet Union was not just unfriendly but an enemy.\nClark et al. 5\nTo the extent that intolerance is shaped by historical events,\nwe hypothesize as follows:\nHypothesis 5 (H5): Both Generations 1 and 2 should\nassign a similar priority to allowing a communist to run\nfor public office, witnessed as parallel shifts in political\nintolerance.\nIn sum, the longitudinal design provides the opportunity\nto explore the extent to which new generations of people\nenter the electorate and bring with them different life experi-\nences that can be expected to influence political attitudes dif-\nferently than previous generations. Alternatively, the basis of\nthe explanation may be found in the aging process itself--\nwhen environments become increasingly unstable in the pre-\nadult years (as individuals complete education, enter\nmarriage, the workforce, or the military, for example), they\nmay have more reasons to shift their attitudes and orienta-\ntions as they grow older (Lorence & Mortimer, 1985).\nSources of Political Tolerance\nThe earliest empirical studies (e.g., Stouffer, 1955) identified\nindividual-level factors that appear to enhance or impede\npolitical tolerance, including political, psychological, and\nsocial background variables. Indeed, education, age, religi-\nosity (including church attendance and one's interpretation\nof the Bible), social status, gender, race, political ideology,\ninterpersonal trust, party identification, political knowledge,\nand region have all been identified in the literature as\nimportant antecedents of tolerance.4 Realistically, we\nexpect to find that the impact of the predictors should work\nto differentiate members within a cohort and across cohorts\nBecause the bases of intolerance appear to vary with a\nnumber of possible influences, the present design provides\nthe opportunity to examine the direct effect of each of the\npredictors, and to also examine whether the relationship is\nconsistent across generations and time.\nData\nTo assess the effect of age, birth, and year on changes in\nintolerance, we rely on the Youth\u00adParent Socialization Panel\nsee also Jennings, Markus, & Niemi [and Stoker]).5 The\nlong-term political socialization project was compiled from\ninterviews with a national probability sample of 1,669 high\nschool seniors from the graduating class of 1965, and when\npossible, at least from one parent. Of the high school sample,\n1997, resulting in an unadjusted retention rate of 56% across\nthe 32 years. The three-wave parent panel consists of 898\nrespondents from an original sample of 1,562, for an adjusted\nretention rate of 57%. For ease of understanding and to avoid\nawkward labeling, the high school senior class is identified\nas Gen 2 or G2 and their parents as Gen 1 or G1.\nAdditional data consist of interviews in 1997 with Gen 2\nand their offspring (Gen 3 or G3), aged 15 and above. Self-\nadministered questionnaires were received from 778 of the\n54%. The availability of data for G2 and their offspring (G3)\nin 1997 provides the additional opportunity to explore the\nextent to which intolerant beliefs in the previous generation\nare reflected in the next.6\nHowever, less attention will be paid to contrasting the\nsecond generation with their children (e.g., contrasting G2\nwith G3). The absence of additional observations prevents us\nfrom knowing whether the patterns continue as the genera-\ntions age, and process historical experiences and social\nchange. The offspring generation is particularly problematic\nbecause discontinuity is more likely to occur within G3 as\nthey confront frequent disruptions--such as getting married,\nhaving children, deciding on a profession--that are associ-\nated with the aging process.\nDependent Variable\nWhereas tolerance presupposes that the individual dislikes\nthe group or groups in question, people are intolerant pro-\nvided that they advocate any restriction of political acts that\nare otherwise permissible under law.7 Because opposition to\ncommunists cannot be determined with the socialization\ndata set, our dependent variable taps intolerance toward\ncommunists rather than tolerance. To create the measure of\nintolerance of communists, we counted the number of \"dis-\nagree\" or \"don't know\" answers.8 Thus, respondents are\nconsidered intolerant to the extent they express ambivalence\nor a willingness to deny office-holding privileges to sus-\npected communists.\nOf course, if the purpose of this research was to track\ntrends in tolerance attitudes or measure the extent of generic\nintolerance in the United States, a simple dichotomy respond-\ning to a single question certainly constitutes a poor strategy.\nOur objective, however, is to provide a more focused inves-\ntigation of intolerance and how the antecedents of political\nintolerance affect the suppression of communist officehold-\ners across a substantial time frame of an individual's life-\ntime. By focusing on the \"disagree/don't know\" responses to\nholding office, a right that is codified by law, this represents\na valid measure of one specific manifestation of the phenom-\nenon. This dichotomous conceptualization of tolerance ver-\nsus intolerance is supported in the literature (on this point,\nMoreover, as noted in the introduction to this article,\nGibson (2008) found that much of the American public still\nexpresses some antipathy toward communists suggesting\nthat the issue of extending freedoms, such as allowing a\nsuspected communist to run for elected office, would be\n6 SAGE Open\nconsidered offensive by many. That is, Gibson (2008) dem-\nonstrated that communists remain a highly disliked group\nby most Americans and that a bit more than 50% of\nAmericans would be willing to ban a demonstration by\ncommunists. More importantly, the level of antipathy and\nintolerance toward communists in contemporary America\nis similar to that toward other groups, such as Radical\nMuslims and Atheists. So although the proclivity for intol-\nerance of communists may have waned since the 1950s, the\nunwillingness to extend freedoms to communists remains\npervasive among most Americans. Because communists\ncontinue to be one of the least-liked groups toward which\nAmericans hold high levels of antipathy and intolerance,\nthe sole measure utilized here provides for a more focused\ninvestigation of intolerance toward communists spanning a\nsubstantial period of American history. However, given that\nAmericans rank communists similar to other target groups\nconsidered more salient in contemporary society, we expect\nour analysis to contribute to a better understanding of the\nroots of intolerance that does not refer to any specific target\ngroup.\nMethod\nFinally, a quick word about the statistical analyses we use in\nthis research. To examine the questions posed earlier, this\nstudy will use quantitative methodology using two levels of\nanalysis--individual and aggregate. The aggregate purpose\nis to demonstrate continuity/discontinuity as well as to high-\nlight differences in attitudes at similar ages. The individual\napproach will attempt to explain the reasons for these pat-\nterns by assessing the effects of the social, psychological,\nand political determinants on tolerance attitudes.\nComparisons based on the occurrence of the predictors may\nshed light on the importance of each factor for attitude for-\nmation, including whether the impact is dependent on the\nrelative or absolute occurrence of the predictor. Moreover,\nwe can compare how changes in these factors result in modi-\nfications of intolerant opinions.\nAs the dependent variable is dichotomous, we have used\nprobit9 models to estimate the effects of the predictors on\nintolerance for communists to hold public office for each\npanel wave. The tolerance item is coded so that 1 indicates\nan intolerant response. The social, psychological, and politi-\ncal determinants were coded using dummy variables with\n\"1\" representing the presence of a particular characteristic,\nand \"0\" representing the absence of the characteristic. To\navoid perfect collinearity in the model, cases where the val-\nues of the independent variable consisted of three or more\ncategories, such as party identification, one value was used\nas the baseline measure in the model. The political knowl-\nedge and interpersonal trust predictors are indexes created by\ncombining several questions with larger numbers represent-\ning greater knowledge or trust, respectively (see Appendix B\nfor question wording).\nFindings\nTo more clearly illustrate the results of our analyses, the fol-\nlowing section is divided into three subheadings pertaining\nto the main effects we examine: \"Life-Cycle Effects,\"\n\"Generational Effects,\" and \"Period Effects.\"\nLife-Cycle Effects\nOur first hypothesis stated that if intolerance was defined by\na life-cycle effect, then age-related patterns and changes\nwould manifest themselves in the form of Gen 2 showing\nsimilar intolerance as Gen 1 (their parents) at the same point\nin the life cycle. Examining the percentage differences\nreported in Table 1, at the aggregate level, we find little evi-\ndence to support H1--as Gen 2 aged the percentage report-\ning intolerance of a communist taking office did not move\ncloser in line with the previous generation, an expected pat-\ntern associated with a life-stage explanation. Indeed, the gap\nbetween Gen 1 and Gen 2 widens from an initial percentage\ncally remaining at this level beyond.\nThese findings also suggest that attitudes toward electing\na communist to public office were an exception to the stan-\ndard \"age-stability\" hypothesis (H2), which claims that opin-\nions on controversial social issues are formed by early\nadulthood and change little with age. The increase in the con-\ntinuity coefficients reported in Table 2 is similar for the first\n.33, respectively; for a reporting of the consistency of\nresponses for each wave of data as compared with the next,\nsee Appendix C).10 That the aggregate movement was not\nexclusive to the younger generation provides support for the\nlifelong-openness theory, which emphasizes that lifelong\nchanges can occur.\nHowever, as the continuity coefficients in Table 2 sug-\ngest, the second generation, after experiencing more attitudi-\nnal fluctuations as it came of age, appears to become more\nstable by middle age. The addition of a third time period\ndemonstrates that these gains tended to remain very much in\nplace--particularly impressive given the much longer time\nspan represented by the third period. In contrast, however,\nthe continuity coefficients reported in Table 2 also suggest\nTable 1. Cross-Sectional Differences.\n% willing to deny\nan elected\ncommunist to\ntake office\nNote. The values reported here are in percentages unless otherwise\nindicated. A simple McNemar test reveals the difference is statistically\ndifferent (p < .05 for all items).\naBased on a comparison with the second generation.\nClark et al. 7\nthat the older cohort was somewhat more likely than the\nyoung to adhere to their earlier attitudes, and because the\n\"nature of the times\" affected the younger cohorts more, this\ndifferential propensity led to a widening gap in tolerance\nbetween the generations. We therefore find little evidence\nsupporting H2--that the second generation's position in the\nlife cycle will exhibit less aggregate attitudinal stability than\ntheir parents.\nGenerational Effects\nWith regard to H3, which states that Gen 2 is least likely to\ndisplay political intolerance, the figures reported in Table 1\nstrongly suggest that being socialized during the Vietnam\nWar\u00adCivil Rights era was quite a different experience from\nbeing raised before or after that time period. Coming of age\nduring this time of tumult, as the 1960s generation did, appears\nto have had the effect of rendering the group as strong advo-\ncates for upholding the rights of communists--especially\nwhen compared with both previous and later generations who\nwere not exposed to such a unique combination of events and\nchanges. Thus, we obtain evidence in support of H3.\nRelated to this finding, we also find support for our fourth\nhypothesis, which also explores generational dynamics and\nstates that the most recent cohort (Gen 3) will exhibit less\nintolerance than their grandparents (Gen 1) but more intoler-\nance than their parents (Gen 2), who came of age during the\n1960s. We can see that the disparity in tolerance opinions\nextends to Gen 2 and their offspring, and with three genera-\ntions to examine, there is evidence of differential experiences\nas demonstrated in intergenerational gaps. Examining the\npercentages reported in Table 1, a wide gulf favoring Gen 2\nexists that is reminiscent of the contrasts between Gen 2 and\ntheir parents (Gen 1). However, as Stouffer (1955) specu-\nlated, the aggregate results reveal a trend toward greater\nacceptance so that the third generation, although more intol-\ngrandparents' generation.\nAdditional evidence to strengthen these claims can be\nfound by considering \"time-lag cross-generational\" compar-\nisons (Table 3). Contrasting the generations contained within\nthe socialization project when they are at comparable ages\nillustrates pronounced secular movement over time, along\nwith generational contrasts, and the changing nature of polit-\nvery closely to the older half of Gen 3 as of 1997 (mean age\nalmost exactly the mean age of the younger half of Gen 1 in\n1973. We see further confirmation of a generational interpre-\ntation in Table 3.\nThese patterns illustrate that being socialized during the\nVietnam War\u00adCivil Rights era was quite a different experi-\nence from being raised before or after that time period. It is\nas though the unique political climate and social conditions\nwithin which the 1960s generation came of age conditioned\nthem to permanently, and increasingly, advocate for uphold-\ning a suspected communist's right to contest for public office\nas compared with the previous or later generations at the\nsame age.\nPeriod Effects\nThese aggregate findings can also address questions about\nlongitudinal developments in the commitment of the\nAmerican public in general (H5). This third model empha-\nsizes the role of changes in context that apply to the whole\npopulation. In this instance, a majority of both generations\nindicate a preference for intolerance by expressing a willing-\nness to deny an elected communist to hold public office. By\n1982, both generations had changed and become significantly\nless intolerant. In this case, the generations began apart and\nmoved with the times (Figure 1). The younger generation,\nhowever, presumably because of its still impressionable\nthe gap remains unchanged because the generations moved at\na corresponding rate. These findings provide support for the\ninfluence of period effects (H5) with intolerant opinions\nchanging in response to external events and conditions.\nIt is, however, important to bear in mind that the evidence\nof change and stability in intolerance attitudes discussed so\nfar have been primarily based on aggregate-level analyses,\nwhich do not allow us to examine how much \"individual-\nlevel\" changes are responsible for the patterns revealed.\nTherefore, it is important to examine whether the genera-\ntional discontinuity highlighted thus far occurs because of\nchanges in each generation's composition, or because they\nwere raised in different historical periods.\nGiven the emphasis on long-term trends, the impact of\nsocial and demographic changes holds a variety of poten-\ntially significant implications for intolerance attitudes.\nBecause opinions are strongly influenced by individual char-\nacteristics (e.g., one's occupation or educational attainment,\nlife histories, day-to-day experiences, peers, etc.), changes to\ntheir social and demographic conditions will produce\nTable 2.

As\nthe negative sign across columns 1 to 3 indicates, and consis-\ntent with previous findings, Gen 2 is consistently less likely\nto express intolerance than their parents, a finding that is sta-\ntistically significant over the entire panel period (although\nthe difference between the time periods is not statistically\nFurthermore, examining Table 4, it becomes clear that\nthe occurrence of the predictor and the impact is important\nfor attitude formation.

However, the negative\ncoefficients for both personal trust and political knowledge\nindicate that higher levels of both are associated with a\ngreater willingness to allow a suspected communist to hold\npublic office.

It is also worth\nnoting that the impact of education and political knowledge\non being less intolerant grew significantly over time.\nTable 4 also reveals variables that have only a tenuous\nrelationship with political intolerance. For instance, reli-\ngious individuals are politically intolerant to the extent that\nthey have a certain view of God and the Bible. The positive\nand significant coefficient for those who believe the Bible\nshould be taken literally indicates these individuals are\nmore willing to suppress rights than people with different\nviews. This is unsurprising because one of the factors that\nmade communism so threatening to Americans was its\nclose association with Godlessness, and as a consequence,\nthe phrase \"under God\" was added to the Pledge of\nAllegiance (Gibson, 1989). That this relationship is only\nreflects the influence of political events and increased\nopposition to communists documented during those years\n(Mayer, 1992). These findings regarding bible interpreta-\ntion are also important for other reasons, most importantly,\nthat they provide evidence of the theoretical mechanism\nunderlying the relationship between threat and intolerance\nwe believe to be in play. If a literal bible interpretation sim-\nply limited one's acceptance of communists, we would\nexpect that it would influence intolerance regardless of\ntime period. Instead, an examination of the coefficients for\nTable 3. Cross-Generation (Time-Lag) Comparison: Intolerance at Similar Ages.\nDiffer.a\nDiffer.a\nNote.

Trends for allowing a suspected communist to hold\npublic office.\nNote. Based on a comparison of the first (parents) and second (children)\ngenerations. The values reported here are in percentages located in\nClark et al. 9\n\"Bible's Belief--God's word\" reported in Table 4 shows\nthat the influence of religious beliefs on intolerance waxes\nand wanes with the salience of the communist threat. Last,\nparty identification and social class are not strong determi-\nnants of intolerance.\nAlthough the probit model provides statistical support\nfor the influence of the predictors on intolerance, the coef-\nficients do not lend themselves to intuitive interpretation.\nAfter converting the reported coefficients into probabili-\nties, we can generate predictions about the types of indi-\nviduals who would be more (or less) likely to be intolerant.\nThe most revealing way to do this is to begin by focusing\non a hypothetical individual. By using either the minimum\nor maximum values for the binary predictors and entering\nthe mean values of the continuous variables--political\nknowledge and interpersonal trust--we can calculate the\nchange in probability brought about by changes in those\nspecific variables. Table 5 shows the results of the calcula-\ntions of a hypothetical individual--one who is White, male,\nRepublican, attends church frequently, believes the Bible is\nthe literal word of God, has a high school education or less,\nand is from the South--and his predicted intolerance of a\ncommunist holding public office.12\nThe predicted probabilities say a good deal about the\ndirection and magnitude of these factors on intolerance and\nhow these relationships reflect age, period, or cohort\neffects. A higher score indicates a more intolerant view,\nwhereas a positive number in the change column (columns\n2, 4, and 6 of Table 5) means the predictor is associated\nwith greater intolerance as compared with the hypothetical\nindividual. Controlling for the effects of generation (see\nbold values in Table 5), we note that the baseline for the\nhypothetical individual representing the second generation\nwise identical individuals who differ only in cohort place-\nment--Gen 1 or Gen 2--a substantial degree of difference\nexists with regard to allowing a communist to run for public\noffice as indicated by the \"Intergenerational Differences\"\nshown at the bottom on Table 5 (12% gap in intolerance in\nBased on the \"over time\" readings, these results also sug-\ngest that despite the parents' greater inclination for intoler-\nance and the resulting generational gap, the impact generated\nby the predictors of intolerance are consistent across the gen-\nerations. As a result, the occurrence of a predictor and the\nposition in the life cycle that it was experienced work to dif-\nferentiate members within the cohort but not across cohorts,\nso that members from adjacent cohorts are more alike than\nthose within the same generation. Thus, in these analyses, the\nTable 4.

The tolerance determinants were coded using dummy variables with \"1\" representing the presence of a particular characteristic and \"0\"\nrepresenting the absence of the characteristic. To avoid perfect collinearity in the model, cases where the values of the independent variable consisted of\nthree or more categories, such as party identification, one value was used as the baseline measure in the model. The political knowledge and interpersonal\ntrust predictors are indexes created by combining several questions with larger numbers representing greater knowledge or trust, respectively. The\nmodel excludes the social class measure in 1965 as it does not exist for the younger sample.

The relative stability of these relationships to\nintolerance serves to differentiate members within the same\ncohort and also maintains the substantial gap between the\ntwo cohorts.\nTo continue the discussion of political intolerance and\nhow the effects of the predictors influence the patterns\nuncovered, the probit estimates and predicted probabilities\nfor the second generation and their children (Gens 2 and 3)\nare summarized in Tables 6 and 7. The absence of additional\ndata points limits the discussion somewhat because the aging\nprocess, particularly for Gen 3, is still very much in play.\nMoreover, political knowledge and social class have been\nexcluded from the models as these variables do not exist in\nthe 1997 survey. As we noted earlier, political knowledge in\nparticular can be a precondition for political tolerance and its\nexclusion may influence the remaining predictors to behave\ndifferently than in earlier analyses. These limitations aside,\nthe evidence presented suggests that the documented differ-\nences in opinions are due to generational effects. The Gen\n2\u00adGen 3 comparisons shown in Table 6 add further empirical\nevidence to this claim, indicating that the legacy of accep-\ntance (in Gen 2) does not extend to their offspring, Gen 3.\nTable 5. Probit Estimates Converted to Probabilities for Intolerance.\nNote. Change column indicates the associated change in probability for the binary variables representing a switch from 0  1 and the associated change\nin the continuous variables (personal trust and political knowledge) as an increase of one standard deviation from the mean (with standard errors in\nparentheses). Intergenerational difference represents the associated difference in probability of a switch in the hypothetical individual (one who is White,\nmale, Republican, attends church frequently, believes the Bible is the literal word of God, has a high school education or less, and is from the South) from\na member of the second generation to being a member of the first generation. In 1973 and 1982, the social class measure was added to the model and, for\nthe purpose of calculating the predicted probability of a hypothetical individual, has been set to represent a member of the middle class.\naThe standard errors for the probabilities have been calculated using the Clarify program designed to simulate quantities of interest for the most\ncommonly used statistical models, including a binary probit. On this point, see Tomz, Wittenberg, and King (2001).\nThe coefficient estimate for \"Generation--Second\" reported\nin Table 6 demonstrates that generation is a major contribu-\ntor to the explanatory power of our models.\nMore importantly, from a trend perspective, the influence\nof the predictors on political intolerance is consistent with\nthe earlier comparisons between the first and second genera-\ntions, and is reflected in both intragenerational and inter-\ngenerational discontinuities. As before, we find that the\nimpact of many of the predictors of intolerance is substan-\ntively large, and as a consequence, the generational gap is\nactually smaller than differences among members of the\nsame generation. For example, Table 7 shows that educa-\ntional attainment in particular works to differentiate mem-\nbers within, but not across, cohorts. As a result, members of\nadjacent cohorts are more alike (e.g., college graduates of\nGen 2 have a .29 predicted probability of intolerance as\ncompared with Gen 3's .41 predicted probability, resulting\nin a 12% intergenerational gap) than members within the\nsame cohort (i.e., a 27% intracohort gap between college\ngraduates and those without a college education, the refer-\nence group). That education remains a relatively stable fac-\ntor in terms of its connection to intolerance across the\ngenerations (regardless of the year obtained) suggests that\nthe impact stems from the amount of education achieved,\nirrespective of the educational environment when it was\ncompleted.\nLast, additional evidence for the \"generational cleavages\"\nexplanation comes from the cross-generation (time-lag) probit\nand predicted probabilities (not shown, available on request).\nThe analysis draws on same-aged individuals at different time\nperiods, thus ruling out the influence of life-cycle effects. The\nfigures demonstrate that rather than a convergence in opinions\nat similar ages (as is required with the aging explanation), gen-\neration is a major contributor to the explanatory power of the\nmodels (p < .01). Compared with their parents and children at\ncomparable moments in their life stage, the patterns tell a\nfamiliar story uncovered earlier: Members of the second gen-\neration are less intolerant in youth (8% difference) and middle\nage (11%) than their children or parents.\nConclusion\nThe analyses presented here have taken the tolerance discus-\nsion a step forward by focusing on a specific civil liberty and\ninvestigating the importance of three models--life cycle,\ngenerational, and period effects--that could account for\nintolerance patterns and trends. Moreover, the study provides\na stringent check of the generalizability of our current under-\nstanding of the sources of intolerance over an individual's\nlife span.\nTable 6.

Intergenerational difference represents\nthe associated difference in probability of a switch in the hypothetical individual from\na member of the second generation to being a member of the third generation.\nAt the outset, we outlined several questions we wished to\naddress. The first question asked how political intolerance\nchanged over time and across generations, and contingent\non the answer to this first question, what was the source of\nthe change? In terms of both of these questions discussed\nabove, the results make several important theoretical points.\nFirst, our results suggest that intolerance is not explained by\na life-cycle effect. Certainly, we find no support for the\nproposition that \"we all get more conservative as we age\" as\nthe evidence presented actually supports the contrary posi-\ntion. The Stoufferian prediction--a decrease in intolerance\nthrough cohort replacement--fits the facts very well. The\nlongitudinal and contemporaneous gaps in tolerance opin-\nions imply that the persistent age differences in political\nintolerance appear attributable to a generational argument.\nIn some cases, the gap between the first and second genera-\ntions is too large to explain away by the effects of aging\nalone. The older cohort was more intolerant than the two\nyounger generations, and the second generation became less\nintolerant rather than more, as expected by the life-cycle\nhypothesis, with age. The overtime generational compari-\nsons show that the difference is relatively constant, which\nundermines any sense of gradual and consistent change as\none ages.\nRather, the findings reveal that these age-based patterns\ncan be explained, for the most part, by the political, eco-\nnomic, and social environments in which the generations\nwere raised. The cohort differences are such that the more\nrecent generations are less intolerant than the earliest\ncohort. The differences in attitudes toward communist\nofficeholders continue even after controlling for composi-\ntional differences in race, gender, education, religiosity,\nparty identification, social class, region, personal trust, and\nknowledge. Put differently, when all else is equal, intoler-\nance declines considerably across birth cohorts. Thus,\nchange in intolerant attitudes is independent of other\nchanges in the population, as measured here. Moreover,\nbecause the study examines intolerance, when we observe\nthat more recent cohorts are less willing to deny the rights\nand liberties of others than the oldest generation (Gen 1) in\nall survey years, this reflects true generational differences,\nand not generational differences in opposition. These are\nthe major findings of this research.\nSecond, the evidence suggests the uniqueness of the\nsecond generation. The age-based patterns summarized\nearlier indicate that the most important influence on intol-\nerant orientations was the unique circumstances in which\nthe second generation first acquired their viewpoints. The\nyounger cohort was at the most politically impressionable\nages (under 30 years) during the turbulent decade of\nchange, the 1960s. Their preferences are definitely less\nintolerant than the cohorts who preceded or followed\nthem. The general pattern, regardless of the\nchanges taking place in their personal lives and society,\nwas a fundamental commitment to allowing a suspected\ncommunist to run for public office.\nIn general terms, period effects are causes of public opin-\nion that affect all cohorts at the same time and produce a\ngeneral shift in public opinion in some direction. The data\nshow a growing acceptance for communist officeholders\nover the panel period. Indeed, substantial positive aggregate\nmovement was captured suggesting the importance of his-\ntorical happenings regardless of cohort placement. In sum,\nthe contributions of the three age, period, and cohort dimen-\nsions suggest that cohort and period effects largely explain\nthe longitudinal modifications that occurred while age effects\nwere relatively unimportant.\nFinally, the focus on one specific manifestation of intoler-\nance as a test of the applicability of the Sullivan et al. model\nhas proven to be beneficial. Not only have the results con-\nfirmed the relevance of key predictors across birth cohorts\nand time periods but also how social and cultural changes\nmay influence the impact of these predictors to intolerance.\nFirst, the results reveal that the impact of many of the predic-\ntors is substantially large and works to differentiate individu-\nals \"within\" a generation. As a consequence, the generation\ngap is actually smaller than the intracohort differences among\nmembers of the same generation. Second, among the toler-\nance determinants, political knowledge and education emerge\nas strong predictors. This finding squares with the extant lit-\nerature because it is widely assumed that higher levels of edu-\ncation would expose individuals to differing viewpoints and\nSimilarly, a large body of research shows that increased\neducation--especially a college experience--tends to\nsocialize students to have more tolerant and cosmopolitan\nviews of the world (e.g., Bobo & Licari, 1989; Campbell,\nConverse, Miller, & Stokes, 1960; Erikson, Luttbeg, &\nTedin, 1991). The size and direction of the educational\ncoefficients illustrate the power of this relationship. An\nimportant and related point here is that although education\ncontinues to distinguish members within a cohort, the evi-\ndence demonstrates that, despite having obtained their\neducation under quite dissimilar conditions, the effect of a\ncollege degree works to \"minimize\" cross-generational\ndifferences. An expectation attached to higher education is\nthat absolute levels (sum of education achieved) are impor-\ntant because educational attainment works in a positive\ndirection in its influence on political tolerance (Nie et al.,\nThe impact of education on tolerance opinions may, how-\never, depend on relative (age, or historical and political\nperiod attended) levels or both (on this point, see Nie et al.,\n1996). That educational achievement remains a reasonably\nstable fixture in terms of its connection to intolerance across\nthe two generations, regardless of the year obtained, suggests\nthe impact stems from absolute achievement. Moreover, the\neducation relationship continues regardless of life stage sug-\ngesting a more permanent divergence between individuals at\nopposite ends of the educational spectrum and regardless of\ngenerational placement.\nThe existence of tolerant procedural norms is an impor-\ntant condition on which a modern democracy rests. These\ncomparisons offer illustrations and evidence that can be\nused to further our understanding about the formation and\ncontinuity of politically intolerant opinions. The longitudi-\nnal patterns indicate the source of support for allowing a\nsuspected communist to run for public office has more to do\nwith the formative experiences of the younger generations\nthan social and demographic differences. We realize, of\ncourse, that these conclusions are based on an examination\nof a single manifestation of intolerance using a four-wave\nnational panel study, but it seems to us that these findings\nare consistent with what a number of other scholars have\nconcluded about intolerance of communists. A number of\nempirical studies show that Americans remain deeply\ndivided in their views of communists and yet increasingly\nsupport their civil rights (Gibson, 1992; Mondak & Sanders,\nclusion but with the certainty that is only possible with panel\ndata.\nAppendix A-Research Design for\nLongitudinal Analysis of Political\nTolerance\nPrimary sample high school seniors (Gen 2) N\nTheir parents (Gen 1)\nAverage age\nTheir children (Gen 3)\nAverage age\nGenerational analysis (aggregate and individual levels)\nB.

All analysis is conducted using pooled data sets, but analysis\nconducted for the generations separately show similar results.\n7. Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus (1982) created the least-\nliked tolerance measure wherein they effectively argued\nthat to determine whether someone is extending tolerance\nto a group, such as communists, you first need to determine\nwhether they like that group. That is, extending civil liberties\nand rights to groups and/or individuals with which you agree\nor are indifferent toward does not measure tolerance. Rather,\nif you vehemently dislike or disagree with a group and/or\nindividual, but are willing to extend civil rights and liberties\nregardless, then you are truly practicing political tolerance.\nIn making this argument, Sullivan et al. effectively chal-\nlenged the standard means of measuring tolerance at the time\n(e.g., the method used by Stouffer, 1955, and Nunn, Crockett,\n8. The lack of recognition of these undeniable rights as dem-\nonstrated by a \"don't know\" or \"refuse to state\" also consti-\ntutes an intolerant response. As discussed previously, there is\nsupport in the tolerance literature (most notably, Mondak &\nSanders, 2003) for the position that a refusal to extend civil\nliberties to any group--regardless of affect or indifference--\nrepresents an intolerant attitude.\n9. The probit technique produces maximum likelihood estima-\ntions (MLEs), which are estimates of change on the cumula-\ntive standard normal distribution that results from a one-unit\nchange in the independent variable with the remaining vari-\nables held constant (Aldrich & Nelson, 1984).\n10. Continuity here refers to the level of response agreement\nbetween consecutive panel waves. Because the tolerance\nvariable is dichotomous, the resulting correlation is a phi-\ncoefficient. The phi-coefficient is a measure of the degree\nof association between two binary variables (for a more\nthorough discussion of the phi-coefficient and its usage,\nplease see An Introduction to Statistics by Professor Keith G.\nCalkins: http://www.andrews.edu/~calkins/math/edrm611/\nequations is calculated using the two-stage least squares (2SLS)\nprocedure. Because the error terms in panel data are likely to be\ncorrelated over time, the first stage is used to estimate an \"instru-\nment\" for the lagged intolerance variable from the prior panel\nperiod.
