In 2012, health care costs in the U.S. are estimated to be\n2.8 trillion dollars. By 2020, they are estimated to surpass 4.6 trillion dollars (Center for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services, 2011). Investigations into the factors that are associated\nwith health-enhancing or health-compromising behaviors thus have great practical utility.\nIndeed, a commentary recently published in Nature documented the results of a meeting\norganized by the U.S. National Science Foundation in which social scientists were asked to\nidentify \"grand challenge questions that are both foundational and transformative.\" The\nEvolutionary perspective on health psychology\nnumber one priority on this list of grand challenges was \"How to induce people to take care\nHealth psychology has emerged as a field of inquiry aimed at understanding the\npsychological factors that shape health-relevant behaviors. Health psychologists often\nappeal to social cognitive models of behavior, and the constructs within them, to\nunderstand, predict, and change behavior. The success of these efforts can be viewed from\na glass-half-full perspective. Meta-analytic reports demonstrate that many of these model\ndevelopment efforts result in small to moderate amounts of variance in behavior accounted\nfor (McEachan et al., 2011) and some success at behavior change (Webb and Sheeran,\n2006), and interventions that have a basis in these theories are typically more successful\nthan those that do not (Painter et al., 2008). For example, theory-based interventions to\ndecrease risky sexual behavior have been shown to increase condom use and decrease\nsexually transmitted infections in high risk populations (e.g., Bryan, Schmiege, and\nBroaddus, 2009; DiClemente et al., 2009), and interventions to increase physical activity\nhave had some success, particularly for the initiation of physical activity among sedentary\nOne could also view the success of these efforts from a glass-half-empty\nperspective. Current efforts to change health behavior are, in most domains, unsuccessful.\nAn obesity epidemic continues in Western countries and is rapidly expanding across the\nglobe (James, 2008). This, combined with sedentary lifestyle--another epidemic--\ncontributes to extensive morbidity and mortality from cancer (Calle et al., 2003), heart\ndisease (Manson et al., 1990), and type II diabetes (Dandona et al., 2004). HIV/AIDS\ncontinues to decimate young people's lives around the world, and more common sexually\ntransmitted infections (e.g., Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonnorrhoeae) increase the\nrisk of sterility and other negative health outcomes (Hillis et al., 1997). Despite public\nhealth efforts, approximately 25% of Americans still smoke cigarettes (Fiore et al., 2008),\nand only 5% of Americans achieve recommended levels of physical activity (Troiano et al.,\n2008). Even when interventions change behavior initially, behavioral change is difficult to\nmaintain (King et al., 2009; Johnson et al., 2010). In sum, current approaches to\nunderstanding and improving health behavior have substantial room for improvement\nWe propose that, just as evolutionary theory has significantly influenced the way\nthat psychologists understand topics such as morality (DeScioli and Kurzban, in press),\nsexuality (Thornhill and Gangestad, 2008), and cooperation (Cosmides and Tooby, 1992),\nit can add critical insights into how we understand, predict, and change health behavior. In\nthis paper, we first comment on the evolved psychology of health. We then provide\nexamples of theoretical perspectives and research programs used by evolutionary\npsychologists that may help generate novel hypotheses for understanding health behavior\nand, ultimately, construct novel interventions.\nEvolution and Health\nSince 1948, the World Health Organization has defined health as \"a state of\ncomplete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or\nEvolutionary perspective on health psychology\ninfirmity.\" Major lines of inquiry within health psychology thus investigate a broad range\nof behaviors, including smoking, exercise, diet, cancer screening, and safer sex. In our\nreview of theory and findings related to health, then, we address varied aspects of human\nevolved psychology that could influence each of these areas.\nAt first blush, it may seem reasonable to suggest that humans should have an\nevolved motivation to be healthy. After all, individuals in good health would be expected to\nsurvive longer and reproduce more than individuals in poor health. Such assumptions of\ndomain general psychological mechanisms that function to avoid disease and death or\npursue health implicitly or explicitly underlie existing theoretical perspectives within health\npsychology (e.g., terror management health model, health belief model; Goldenberg and\nArndt, 2008; Rosenstock, 1974). However, natural selection is not expected to favor traits\nthat maximize \"survival\" or \"health.\" Indeed, under many conditions, selection may favor\nphenotypes that are uncorrelated with or even negatively correlated with longevity and\nhealth (Getty, 2002; Kokko et al., 2002). Life history theory has developed to describe and\nunderstand the manner in which organisms allocate finite energetic resources and time to\nfitness-relevant systems such as somatic development and maintenance, intrasexual\ncompetition, courtship, child-rearing, etc. (these are sometimes categorized into domains of\n\"somatic\" and \"reproductive\" efforts; see Charnov, 1993; Stearns, 1989). Selection should\nnot favor the development of phenotypes that maximally invest in \"health\" processes,\nbecause the costs of these investments come at the expense of lifetime reproductive\nsuccess.\nMotivating Health is Not a Plausible Evolved Psychological Function\nInstead of evolving to motivate general adaptive behavior such as \"avoid death,\"\n\"reproduce,\" or \"be healthy,\" psychological adaptations are designed to take specific\ninformation from the environment, process that information, and output behaviors that were\nprobabilistically adaptive in the environments in which they evolved (e.g., Tooby and\ndomain specific information processing systems over abstract, domain general systems for\nseveral reasons. We mention two. First, just as organs that are specialized to perform\ndistinct tasks (e.g., circulate blood, filter wastes, produce gametes) have evolved instead of\na \"master organ\" that generally functions to \"survive,\" psychological systems that are\nfunctionally specialized have a selective advantage over domain general systems. The\nsystems that detect kinship and motivate incest avoidance, for example, use a different set\nof cues and lead to different behavioral outputs than the systems that detect infectious\nmicrobes and motivate pathogen avoidance (Lieberman et al., 2007; Tybur, Lieberman,\nKurzban, and DeScioli, in press). It is implausible that a master drive to pursue \"health\"\ngoverns all (or, indeed, any) of the myriad health relevant behaviors in the modern\nenvironment. Instead, the psychological mechanisms that influence some health-relevant\nbehaviors (e.g., drinking alcohol) likely operate distinctly from the systems influencing\nother health-relevant behaviors (e.g., getting regular cervical exams).\nSecond, to fulfill domain general functions such as \"avoid death\" or \"promote\nhealth,\" psychological mechanisms would require what has been referred to as \"fitness\nEvolutionary perspective on health psychology\nneed to know the long-term health outcomes of specific behaviors, and they would need to\nact in the specific manners that optimize such outcomes. This is certainly not the case with\nother fitness relevant behaviors. For example, no psychological mechanism functions to\nmotivate \"reproduction\"--otherwise, men would be strongly motivated to donate sperm,\nwomen would be motivated to donate eggs, and both sexes would be stridently opposed to\nany form of contraception. Instead, in the mating domain, functionally specific mechanisms\nassess qualities that have reliably correlated with mate value in conspecifics and output\nattraction to those conspecifics (e.g., if I am a man, be attracted to females with cues to\nfertility and genetic quality and compatibility; if I am a woman, be attracted to men with\ncues to genetic quality and compatibility and intrasexual competitive ability), which in turn\nenacts the series of behaviors that probabilistically led to conception in the environment in\nwhich the psychological adaptations evolved.\nThe existence of (preventable) health epidemics related to obesity, sexually\ntransmitted infections, and lifestyle oriented cancers is difficult to reconcile with a\nperspective positing the existence of a quasi-teleological motivation to engage in \"healthy\"\nbehaviors. Instead, it suggests that we have an evolved psychology that, while influencing\nhealth in the 21st century, does not primarily function to motivate good or bad health.\nRather than flipping a master \"health\" switch, different types of health behaviors likely\nrespond to different inputs, and, critically, different types of interventions. Applying this\nperspective may meaningfully advance how we understand health behavior and how we\nmight encourage change. We now explore a few examples of theoretical perspectives and\nhypothesized psychological systems that may be useful in understanding health-relevant\nbehavior.\nLife History Theory and Health\nAs stated previously, life history theory aims to understand the manner in which\norganisms allocate finite energy budgets toward different fitness-relevant systems. Based\non environmental and phenotypic conditions, individuals may follow different life history\nstrategies--that is, different strategic resource allocations. This perspective may be useful\nfor understanding, predicting, and changing a number of health behaviors. Here we address\nphysical activity (exercise), a health behavior that directly addresses strategic uses of\nenergy.\nIn modern Western societies, which are largely sedentary, physical activity is\nassociated with a variety of positive health outcomes (Warburton, Nicol, and Bredin, 2006).\nIn the calorie-limited environments in which the psychological systems influencing\nexercise evolved, however, rigorous or sustained physical activity entailed substantial\ndirect energetic costs, as well as costs related to the development and maintenance of\nmetabolically expensive muscle tissue. Some exertion provided offsetting benefits, such as\nrunning down prey, migrating and foraging over long distances, and protecting self and kin\nfrom predators and violent conspecifics. Hence, the psychology of physical activity should\nlead humans to be selectively active, with activity varying as a function of ecological and\nphenotypic conditions.\nOne of the major costs of exertion is increased vulnerability to long-term calorie\nEvolutionary perspective on health psychology\ndeficit. When individuals develop in environments indicative of relatively high risk of\ncalorie deficit, they may conserve energy by reducing activity. Human and non-human\nanimal literature is consistent with this perspective. For example, in a meta-analysis of 13\nScandanavian birth cohorts, lower than normal birth weight--potentially a cue to caloric\nstress in adulthood--was related to lower leisure time physical activity later in life\n(Andersen, 2009). In another study, low birth weight was not associated with\ncardiorespiratory fitness, but was related to a higher energy cost of running (Baraldi et al.,\n1991). In rats, mothers' undernourishment--potentially a cue to resource availability in the\nenvironment--predicts offspring physical activity regardless of post-natal food availability,\nwith offspring of malnourished mothers being less active (Vickers et al., 2003). Taken\ntogether, this suggests that life history strategies calibrated during early development may\ninfluence physical activity in adulthood. This framework could be used to predict who will\nbe at risk for low activity later in life. Moreover, future work in this area could develop\ndifferent interventions for increasing exercise depending on calibrated life history strategy.\nThis framework can also elucidate sex differences in the psychology of exercise.\nGiven the higher metabolic demands associated with pregnancy and lactation (up to 700\nmore kcals/day) physical activity in women is associated with higher trade-offs with\nreproductive effort. Indeed, research has shown that women's fecundity decreases with\nincreased energy expenditure (Ellison, 2003), and that the postnatal period of lactational\namenorrhea is sensitive to energy expenditure (Ellison, 2008). Men's reproductive\nphysiology, on the other hand, is generally less energetically costly and more robust in the\nface of reductions in energy availability or increases in energy expenditure. The quantity\nand quality of sperm production, for example, appears to be insensitive to short term\nchanges in energy availability (Bribiescas, 2006). Epidemiological data on current exercise\nbehavior are consistent with a higher cost for women of being physically active, as women\nreliably report lower levels of physical activity than men (Buckworth and Dishman, 2007).\nInterventions targeting increased exercise may thus be maximally effective if they tailor\ninterventions to evolved, sex-specific psychologies.\nLife history theory may also inform individual differences in a variety of other\nhealth-relevant behaviors. Human life history strategies vary along a continuum. Some\nindividuals allocate effort in a \"slower\" manner, with a focus on investment in embodied\ncapital, maintenance, and delayed reproduction, and some individuals allocating effort in a\n\"faster\" manner, with greater allocations toward earlier reproduction and mating effort\n(Ellis et al., 2009). Early life experiences hypothesized to shape life history strategies (e.g.,\nenvironmental instability) relate to a number of indices of risk in early adulthood, including\nage of sexual debut, number of sexual partners, and criminal activity (Belsky, Schlomer,\nand Ellis, 2012; Simpson et al., 2012). Other early life experiences (e.g., family\nsocioeconomic status) appear to shape the manner in which people respond to ecological\nthreats later in life, with individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds responding to\ncues to mortality threat by taking more financial risks, discounting the future, and reporting\nwanting children earlier (Griskevicius et al., 2011a,b). If certain health behaviors reflect\ngreater investment in slow versus fast life history strategies, interventions could target\nindividuals likely to engage in such behaviors based on relevant risk factors (e.g., stability\nof childhood environment), and could tailor intervention content to slow versus fast\nEvolutionary perspective on health psychology\nstrategists (Ellis et al., 2012). Further, such an appreciation for the role of early\ndevelopmental context could provide a more coherent understanding of the co-morbidity of\na number of health risk behaviors (e.g., early sexual debut, substance abuse, impulsive\nbehavior) than perspectives that assume such behaviors are associated simply because\nadolescents seek to be \"deviant\" or are the result of association with deviant peers (c.f.\nPsychological Systems for Courtship and Competition\nUnder a life history theory framework, investment in mating often comes at the\nexpense of investment in maintenance, survival, and, ultimately, health. Such tradeoffs\nbetween fertility and mortality can reflect behavioral tradeoffs--tactics used to improve\nintrasexual competitive ability. A collection of research demonstrates shifts toward costly\nmating tactics during periods of life in which intrasexual competition is high (e.g., Wilson\nand Daly, 1985) or after experimental primes indicative of mating opportunities (e.g.,\nGriskevicius et al., 2009). These costs may extend to behaviors that enhance courtship or\nintrasexual competitive ability at the expense of health. Hill and Durante (2008) describe\nevidence supporting this perspective. Women who were primed with intrasexual\ncompetition reported a greater willingness to tan and take diet pills, both of which\npresumably increase women's intrasexual competitive ability at the expense of health.\nHowever, this shift in health risk intentions did not extend to other health risks presumably\nunrelated to courtship and competition (taking cough syrup as a sleeping aid and painting in\nan unventilated room).\nPsychological mechanisms underpinning intrasexual competition have also been\nproposed as influencing eating disorders (see Ferguson et al., 2011). This hypothesis\ngenerally takes two forms. One suggests that women may strategically suppress their own\nfertility when intrasexual competition is intense by under eating, because such competition\nmay be associated with lowered offspring viability. The other suggests that restricted eating\nin Western societies may be a strategy for increasing physical attractiveness and\noutcompeting others for mates. Both hypotheses have received some empirical support\nThe psychological systems underpinning courtship and intrasexual competition may\nalso increase some healthy behaviors. In U.S. samples, men and women exercise in ways\nthat target physical attractiveness in a sex-specific manner (Jonason, 2007; Mealy, 1997).\nInterventions could capitalize on the connection between exercise and mating psychology,\nparticularly during periods of life associated with intense competition for mates. Further, if\ncourtship and intrasexual competition psychology influences both unhealthy (e.g., tanning)\nand healthy (e.g., exercising) behaviors, future research could investigate methods for\nencouraging one strategy over the other.\nPsychological Systems for Neutralizing Pathogens\nRecent studies concerning the \"behavioral immune system\"--psychological\nadaptations that function to neutralize pathogens--have addressed topics ranging from\nEvolutionary perspective on health psychology\npersonality to xenophobia and social cognition (see Schaller and Park, 2011, for a review).\nGiven that many of the issues tackled by health psychologists concern infectious diseases\n(e.g., HIV) or behaviors that are regulated by pathogen-avoidance mechanisms (e.g.,\neating), an application of this literature and theory may prove useful to health psychology.\nWe consider two such behaviors below: eating and sexual decision making.\nThe mouth is a vulnerable point through which pathogens can enter the body and\nwreak havoc. Each act of eating puts an individual at risk for ingesting pathogens housed\nwithin food (e.g., roundworms in pork) or on food (e.g., food that has been coughed on by a\ncontagious conspecific). Hence, some of the psychological mechanisms influencing dietary\ndecisions likely function to neutralize pathogens (Fessler and Navarrete, 2003; Flaxman\nand Sherman, 2000; Rozin and Fallon, 1987). Tybur et al. (in press) suggest that pathogen-\navoidance behaviors are triggered when systems weighing several factors (e.g., likelihood\nof pathogen presence; expected costs of infection; expected benefits of engaging in the\npotentially infectious behavior) estimate the net expected value of contact with an object as\nespecially low. Dietary interventions could target some of these putative inputs, such as\nlikelihood of pathogen presence. For example, interventions designed to reduce\nconsumption of meats processed by industrial farming could create a link between the food\nproduct and a pathogen cue, such as fecal contamination (e.g., Pollan, 2006).\nLike eating, sexual intercourse allows microorganisms a route through which to\nenter and colonize the body. Some microorganisms--sexually transmitted infections\n(STI's)--have evolved to take advantage of this route of transmission. Given sufficient\neducation on the risks of STI's, an optimal strategy for those who wish to minimize STI\nrisk would be to simply abstain from intercourse. The enduring prevalence of sexual\ninteractions in the face of such information suggests that the psychological systems that\nmotivate sexual behavior are not governed by such rational infection concerns. Barrier\nmethods (e.g., condoms) have been developed to mitigate the most infectious aspects of\npenile-vaginal intercourse (i.e., exchange of sexual fluids) while accommodating the\nevolved psychological systems that motivate sex. Nevertheless, people use condoms at a\nsuboptimal level for avoiding STI's, and increasing condom use is a major goal within\nhealth psychology.\nCondoms are not used for a variety of reasons, including the social stigma\nassociated with purchasing, carrying, and using condoms, and the smell and sensation of\nsex with condoms (Bryan, Schindeldecker, and Aiken, 2001). They are used to some extent\nbecause people are able to associate their use with decreased risk of STI transmission and,\nperhaps even more, appreciate their pregnancy prevention effectiveness (Cooper, Agocha,\nand Powers, 1999). To increase condom use, then, interventions must either attenuate the\ncosts associated with condoms (e.g., increasing sensation), or increase the net benefits of\nusing condoms. Such benefits could conceivably be increased by increasing perceptions of\nvulnerability to HIV and other STI's. However, rational perceptions of vulnerability to\nSTI's relate weakly and inconsistently to condom intentions (Gerrard, Gibbons, and\nBushman, 1996), and having previously had an STI and receiving STI education are\nnegatively related and unrelated to condom intentions, respectively (Sheeran and Taylor,\n1999). Moreover, decades of research have demonstrated that increasing fear of STIs is not\nan effective intervention strategy for motivating safer sexual behavior (Albarrac\u00edn et al.,\nEvolutionary perspective on health psychology\n2005). Tybur et al. (2011) recently suggested that, although attempts to manipulate\nobjective fear of STI's may not influence condom use, the psychological systems\nfunctioning to neutralize pathogens--and, critically, the ecological cues indicating\npathogen presence--might. They found that participants exposed to olfactory cues to\npathogens (notably, pathogens that are not specific to STI's) reported greater intentions to\nuse condoms over the next six months than participants in a control condition. These\nfindings suggest that psychological systems that evolved to detect pathogens--part of a\n\"behavioral immune system\"--may play an important role in decisions relevant to sexual\nhealth. Future interventions designed to increase condom use--or to encourage other sexual\nhealth behaviors that may be influenced by pathogen-avoidance psychology--may\ncapitalize on this connection.\nFuture Investigations into Evolutionary Health Psychology\nA marriage between evolutionary psychology and health psychology can yield\nsubstantial benefits to both areas. Evolutionary psychologists interested in topics such as\ncourtship, intrasexual competition, energy allocation, and pathogen-avoidance may gain\ncritical insights into the psychology of these domains by incorporating health-relevant\nmeasures into their investigations. Health psychologists interested in maximizing the\nexplanatory power of theories and the utility of interventions over disparate arrays of health\nproblems may find the modular perspective used by evolutionary psychologists helpful.\nWe generally suggest that these efforts can take two forms. First, although it is\nincreasingly recognized that the \"one-size-fits-all\" interventions commonly utilized in\nhealth psychology are suboptimal (Seefeldt, Malina, and Clark, 2002), health psychologists\nhave not been terribly successful in uncovering the critical factors that will define which\ninterventions have maximal utility for which groups (Cahill, Lancaster, and Green, 2010).\nAn evolutionary perspective can be used to categorize individuals into such groups, and to\ninform what types of interventions would be effective for these groups. Second,\nevolutionary perspectives can identify which specific inputs (e.g., cues to intrasexual\ncompetition; cues to pathogens) may affect which health behaviors. These inputs are\ncritically important in the development of intervention content.\nIn this paper, we have offered a few suggestions of how lines of research pursued\nby evolutionary psychologists have informed health behavior and can inform health\nbehavior further. This is only the tip of the iceberg. Though we have not reviewed in any\ndetail behaviors such as smoking, dental care, cancer screening, binge drinking, substance\nabuse, and adherence to medications, all of these are strongly related to health outcomes\nand could be informed by an evolutionary perspective. Our attempts at increasing health\nbehavior and decreasing risk behavior may have reached something of a glass ceiling of\neffectiveness. It is now time to apply innovative methods and novel perspectives if we hope\nto shatter that glass ceiling and have meaningful and sustained impact on morbidity and\nmortality. An evolutionary psychological perspective, with its carefully articulated theories\nof evolved psychological structure and function, is likely to be a highly fruitful avenue to\npursue as we seek to promote optimal physical, mental and social well-being, and not\nsimply the absence of disease.\nEvolutionary perspective on health psychology\nReferences\nAlbarrac\u00edn, D., Gillette, J.
