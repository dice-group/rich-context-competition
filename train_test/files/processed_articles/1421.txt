Menstrual histories, both as markers of\nphysiologic function and through their potential association with age at menopause, have also been investigated\nfor their links to health outcomes. This study used data from a cohort of women from the United States who\nprovided prospectively recorded data on their menstrual cycles for many years. Dr. Alan Treloar (University of\nMinnesota) originally recruited the women in the 1930s; the authors used data reported by these women from\n1930 through 1977. They identified nuanced characteristics of menstrual histories that were strongly predictive\nof the onset of menopause, focusing on measures of central tendency (the mean), variability (standard deviation),\nand serial irregularity (approximate entropy), the last of which quantifies a continuum that ranges from totally\nordered to completely random. They controlled for other characteristics known to affect age at menopause,\nincluding use of exogenous hormones, number of births, and extent of breastfeeding. Although cycle length and\nvariability increased with the approach of menopause, the authors found that serial irregularity decreased and\nwas a strong predictor of its onset. This finding constitutes an important piece of information not attainable with\nconventional statistical summaries of menstrual histories.\nage of onset; menopause; menstrual cycle\nAbbreviation: ApEn, approximate entropy.\nOver the past two decades, an expanding body of literature\nhas documented links between a woman's age at menopause\nand her health. Menstrual cycle patterns, as markers of phys-\niologic function and through their potential association with\nage at menopause, have also been investigated for their links\nto health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to identify\nmore highly nuanced features of menstrual histories than\nhave been examined previously and to demonstrate their\nrelation to age at menopause. These linkages are an impor-\ntant step toward a deeper understanding of the precursors of\na broad range of health outcomes.\nEarly menopause has been tied to a number of negative\noutcomes, including a higher risk of cardiovascular disease\n(1, 2), osteoporosis (2, 3), and higher all-cause mortality (4\u00ad\n6). Late age at menopause has been found to be associated\nwith a higher risk of breast (2, 7) and endometrial (2, 8)\ncancers. Menstrual cycle characteristics, most notably length\nof the intermenstrual interval, have also been identified as\nrisk factors for a variety of health conditions including poly-\ncystic ovary syndrome (9), coronary heart disease (10), and\nfound a link between diabetes and cycle characteristics,\nalthough recent work (15) found no association between\nadult-onset diabetes and mean cycle length, number of long\ncycles, or cycle variability.\nAlong with parity (4, 16), use of oral contraceptives (16),\nand age at menarche (17), menstrual cycle characteristics\nalso appear to be associated with age at menopause. While\nresults across studies appear to show consistent links with\nrespect to cycle length, findings about cycle variability are\nReprint requests to Dr. Maxine Weinstein, Center for Population and Health, Room 312 Healy Hall, Box 571197, Georgetown University,\nMenopause and Patterns of Menstrual Bleeding 783\nmixed. Late age at menopause is associated with longer\nmean cycle length (18, 19); similarly, short cycle lengths are\nassociated with early onset of menopause (2, 16). However,\nden Tonkelaar et al. (18) and Whelan et al. (2) found no\nsignificant relation between cycle length variability and age\nat menopause.\nWe examined the link between bleeding patterns\nthroughout a woman's reproductive lifetime and her age at\nmenopause; characteristics of the full menstrual history were\nconsidered. We identified characteristics of bleeding\npatterns that may provide prospective criteria for identifying\nthe menopausal transition. Prior studies of cycle characteris-\ntics have focused on first- and second-order descriptive\nstatistics (measures of central tendency and spread). As\ndescribed below, we used a measure of approximate entropy\n(ApEn) to add an important dimension to earlier work.\nWhereas a measure of spread such as the standard deviation\nor range captures the variability of cycles, ApEn is a\nmeasure that enabled us to quantify their serial irregularity.\nBecause common parlance with regard to menstrual cycles\nuses \"regularity\" to refer to statistical variability (women\ntypically report having regular or irregular cycles, meaning\nthat cycle lengths are not very variable or highly variable,\nrespectively), we paid particular attention to characterizing\nthe distinction between these two concepts. We also empha-\nsized the new information captured by ApEn and described\nhow it augments standard descriptive statistics in identifying\nfeatures of menstrual histories linked to age at menopause.\nWe performed two sets of complementary analyses. First,\nwe examined survival models following women from age 40\nyears forward (although we included information on events\nthat occurred before, as well as after, age 40 years) and\nexamined how cycle characteristics influence the age-related\nhazard of menopause. Second, we looked backward from\nmenopause and explored diagnostic characteristics of peri-\nmenopausal menstrual patterns. Thus, we explored both\nprospective and retrospective links between cycle character-\nistics and menopause.\nDr. Alan Treloar (University of Minnesota) initiated the\nMenstruation and Reproductive History Study in 1934.\nSubsequently renamed \"The Tremin Trust\" and deeded to\nthe University of Utah, it was directed by Dr. Ann Voda until\n1998, when the study moved to The Pennsylvania State\nUniversity under the direction of Dr. Phyllis Mansfield. The\noriginal goal was \"to define quantitatively the rhythm pattern\nof the human menstrual cycle through current recording of\ndates of onset and cessation of flow\" (20, p. 78). Over time,\nin addition to prospectively recorded data on onset and dura-\ntion of successive bleeds, women contributed data relating to\ntheir use of exogenous hormones, marital and reproductive\nhistories, surgical interventions, and a wide range of other\ninformation. A second cohort of women was recruited\nduring the 1960s, but our study used data from a subset of\nwomen drawn from the original recruits (born between 1908\nyears. The institutional review board at Georgetown Univer-\nsity (Washington, DC) approved this project.\nWe first used proportional hazards models to examine the\nrelation between age at menopause and a set of covariates.\nWomen entered exposure to the risk of menopause at age 40\nyears and exited because they were censored (either tempo-\nrarily or permanently) or reached menopause. We assumed\nthat exposure began at age 40 years because none of the\nwomen we observed experienced menopause before that\nage. Our sample was limited to 444 women who contributed\ndata before age 40 years. Reasons for exclusion prior to age\n40 years included death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal from\nthe study, sterilization, and use of exogenous hormones\nthroughout their history or without a defined endpoint.\nBecause we used cycle characteristics prior to age 40 years\nas predictors of onset of menopause, we also excluded three\nwomen all of whose observed cycles prior to age 40 years\nwere affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding. Data for the\n444 women were incorporated into our models until the\nwomen reached menopause or were (permanently) censored\nowing to death, loss to follow-up, or sterilization. Data on\nsurgical sterilization were not complete for some women:\ntype of procedure was not always reported. In some cases,\nwe knew only that a subject was \"sterilized\" and the date of\nthe procedure. It is possible that fallopian tubes were inter-\nrupted without interfering with the uterus or ovaries or that\nonly one ovary was removed (25 women reported unilateral\noophorectomies). However, we had too few cases (20\nunspecified \"sterilizations\") to estimate such an effect in our\nmodels. Therefore, we censored all women (those who\nreported a hysterectomy, unilateral or bilateral oophorec-\ntomy, or unspecified sterilization) at the time of surgery.\nTable 1 shows the number of women, by category,\nexcluded from the analysis. More than half were excluded\nbecause of only partial information on use of exogenous\nhormones. In principle, women recorded start and stop dates\nTABLE 1. Subjects excluded prior to age 40 years, by cause,\nfrom the analysis of data from the Menstruation and\nReproductive History Study (The Tremin Trust), United States,\n* Includes two subjects who were lost to follow-up immediately\nafter surgery and eight who had temporary breaks in their histories\nbut were censored for other causes immediately on their return.\n Includes hysterectomy, oophorectomy, and unspecified\nprocedures.\n Includes subjects for whom all cycles were affected by\npregnancy or breastfeeding and women who otherwise reported too\nfew cycles to allow calculation of the mean, standard deviation, or\napproximate entropy statistics in all of their 5-year age intervals prior\nCause for exclusion No.\nLoss to follow-up/withdrawal from the study* 185\nfor all sustained treatments (including oral contraceptives);\nhowever, many stop dates were missing, so we used a\nconservative approach in our analysis, excluding spells for\nwhich we were uncertain of hormonal status.\nObservations could also be (temporarily) censored for a\nvariety of reasons: hormonal treatments, pregnancy, breast-\nfeeding, and breaks in reporting. For hormonal treatments,\nwe censored data beginning with onset of treatment and\nextending 4 months following the end of treatment to allow\nfor hormonal washout. Similarly, women contributed data 4\nmonths after they reported the end of pregnancy or breast-\nfeeding.\nWe calculated the overall hazard of menopause by using\nKaplan-Meier estimates; we used Cox survival models to\nadjust for covariates (21). We calculated robust standard\nerrors of the hazard ratios that adjusted for clustering attrib-\nutable to multiple observations per subject. Although our\nprimary interest lay in the relation between age at meno-\npause and cycle patterns, we controlled for other factors\nknown or hypothesized to be associated with age at meno-\npause: age at menarche, number of pregnancies, breast-\nfeeding, and use of exogenous hormones. We examined the\neffect of cycle patterns after age 40 years, net of these other\nfactors, by using nested models.\nOur hazard models followed each subject until she reached\nmenopause or was permanently censored. Women were\ncensored as discussed above or if menopause was not\nconfirmed or was confounded by hormonal treatment. Our\nmodels included a set of variables that described each\nwoman's experience. These variables included fixed charac-\nteristics and several that change over time. Their distribu-\ntions in our population are summarized in table 2.\nDependent variable: age at menopause\nThis variable was defined as age at the start of the last\nreported menstrual cycle prior to confirmed menopause\n(defined as at least a year without report of a menstrual bleed\nor menopause confirmed by the participant or the director of\nThe Tremin Trust).\nMenstrual cycle characteristics before age 40 years\nMean and standard deviation. For each woman, we\ncalculated the mean and standard deviation of menstrual\ncycle lengths in four 5-year age groups. Models that used the\nmedian and interquartile range (data not shown) revealed no\nsubstantive differences in the results. We used only those\ncycles in which women were not pregnant, breastfeeding,\nwithin 4 months postpartum, or using exogenous hormones.\nFor some subjects, data were insufficient to calculate\nmenstrual characteristics in one or more of the age catego-\nries. This deficiency can occur because a subject had long\nbreaks in the information reported, but this cause was rare in\nour data. More commonly, women experienced cycles that\nwere excluded owing to their use of exogenous hormones,\npregnancy, or breastfeeding. Our models included a dummy\nvariable to allow for missing data, and we assigned the mean\nfor all women at that age as their value for the variable.\nApEn. To quantify irregularity, we used ApEn, a model-\nindependent statistic defined by Pincus (22), with further\nmathematical properties and representative biologic appli-\ncations given by Pincus (23), Pincus and Goldberger (24),\nPincus and Huang (25), Pincus and Singer (26), and Pincus\net al. (27, 28). ApEn was introduced to quantify regularity in\nsequences and time-series data, initially motivated by appli-\ncations to relatively short, noisy data (24, 26). This statistic\nhas been used extensively to characterize the degree of\nrandomness in a variety of applications that explore regu-\nlarity in physiologic systems, including patterns of hormonal\nsecretion and heart rate dynamics (27\u00ad31). ApEn assigns a\nnonnegative number to a time-series; larger values corre-\nspond to greater apparent process randomness or serial irreg-\nularity, and smaller values correspond to more instances of\nrecognizable features of patterns in the data. The opposing\nextremes are perfectly regular sequences (very small ApEn)\nand independent sequential processes (very large ApEn).\nTwo input parameters--a run length m and a tolerance\nwindow r--must be specified to compute ApEn, formally\ndenoted ApEn(m,r). Briefly, ApEn measures the logarithmic\nlikelihood that runs of patterns close (within r) for m contig-\nuous observations remain close (within the same tolerance\nwidth r) on incremental comparisons (22). ApEn(m,r) must\nbe considered a family of parameters; comparisons are\nintended with fixed m and r.\nFor this study, we calculated ApEn(m,r) values for all data\nwith well-established parameter values of m = 1 and r = 20\npercent of the standard deviation of the overall subject time\nseries, applied to running blocks of 50 data points. Because r\nthus specified had a value of less than 1.0 and because cycle\nlengths were reported in integer or full-day values rather\nthan as a continuous measurement, the choice of r for the\npresent analysis \"reduced\" to an application of ApEn with\nm = 1 and r = 0 (exact pairwise matches in the data). For\nthese m and r parameter values, and for series of 50 data\npoints as studied here, ApEn ranged from a minimal value of\n0 for perfectly regular series to a maximum of 1.493 for\ncompletely disordered series. Thus, a 10 percent change in\nApEn corresponded to an ApEn increment of approximately\n0.15 here. Multiple previous studies, including both theoret-\nical analyses and applications (22\u00ad30), have demonstrated\nthat the choice of m = 1 and r = 20 percent of the standard\ndeviation as parameters (as above) produces good statistical\nreproducibility (one ApEn standard deviation  0.06 under\nvery general conditions) for ApEn for time series of the\nkinds of lengths we analyzed.\nIn discrete-state space with r = 0, asymptotically, ApEn\nequals the information theoretical rate of entropy (23), inter-\npreted as the average information content per source output\nsymbol. In other model-based settings, ApEn can be evalu-\nated analytically by either multiple integral (continuous-\nstate) or sum (discrete-state) expressions (22). Further tech-\nnical discussion of the mathematical and statistical proper-\nties of ApEn, including robustness to noise and artifacts,\nrelative consistency of (m,r) pair choices, asymptotic\nnormality under general assumptions, statistical bias, and\nerror estimation for general processes, can be found in\nPincus (23), Pincus and Goldberger (24), and Pincus and\nHuang (25). To develop a more intuitive, physiologic under-\nMenopause and Patterns of Menstrual Bleeding 785\nstanding of the ApEn definition, a multistep description of its\ntypical algorithmic implementation, with figures, was devel-\noped in Pincus and Goldberger.\nBecause \"regularity\" in the context of menstrual cycles is\ncommonly used to describe cycles with low variation, we\nclarified how the two concepts differ. Figure 1 shows two\nrows of (hypothetical) data. In the top row are patterns of\ncycles, alternating high and low values, characterized by\nlow serial irregularity (indeed, both are perfectly regular;\nApEn = 0 for each). The graph on the left shows data that\nare highly variable--characterized by a high standard devi-\nation--while the graph on the right shows data that have\nlow variability (a low standard deviation). In the bottom\nrow are patterns of cycles characterized by high serial irreg-\nularity (high ApEn) and high and low variability (left and\nright, respectively). The ApEn value for the left panel of this\nrow is 1.31; for the right panel, it is 1.34. Thus, both of these\nseries are at least 85 percent maximally irregular. Yet,\ndespite the lack of obvious repetitive features in each of\nthese bottom panels, each has an ApEn value more than\n0.15 smaller than the maximal value, that is, at least 2.5\nApEn standard deviations below maximal irregularity.\nTABLE 2.

The graphs display the length in days (y-axis) of\nsuccessive intermenstrual intervals (the intervals between\nsuccessive onsets of menses) by age (x-axis) for two\ndifferent women. Statistics for these two women (mean,\nstandard deviation, and ApEn) are shown in figure 3.\nWoman 1's history reflects fairly level variability in cycle\nlength throughout most of her reproductive life; the vari-\nability of woman 2's cycles was greater. Variability (and\nmean cycle length) for both women increased as they\napproached the menopausal transition. For woman 1, ApEn\nvalues were high and level until the menopausal transition\nand then declined sharply. Until the menopausal transition,\nchanges in her cycle lengths appeared to be highly random\n(high ApEn); during the menopausal transition, her cycles\nwere highly variable but exhibited less randomness\n(declining ApEn). The cycles of woman 2 were character-\nized by greater variation in mean, standard deviation, and\nApEn statistics throughout most of her reproductive history,\nbut, as observed for woman 1, regularity increased (ApEn\ndeclines) during the menopausal transition.\nMenstrual cycle characteristics at age 40 years or older:\nmean, standard deviation, and ApEn\nWe included menstrual cycle information as time-varying\ncovariates, estimated for 3-year intervals, from age 40 years\nforward. A dummy variable was introduced into the model to\nenable us to assess whether the hazard for women for whom\ndata were missing for any interval was statistically signifi-\ncantly different from the hazard for those who reported data.\nIntervals for which data were missing were assigned the\nmean value at that age.\nOther covariates\nAge at menarche. When first recruited, subjects reported\nhow old they were at the time of their first menses. Because\nmost were college students at the University of Minnesota,\nrecall of age at menarche was probably fairly accurate, but\nthe majority reported their age only in completed years. This\ndeficiency is likely to underestimate the true relation\nbetween menarche and menopause if it exists. As shown in\ntable 2, mean age at menarche for these women was 12.4\nyears.\nNumber of births. This covariate was defined as total\nnumber of live- and stillbirths prior to age 40 years.\nMonths of breastfeeding. We defined this covariate as\ntotal months of breastfeeding for all births. As shown in table\n2, breastfeeding was not widely practiced. Less than a\nquarter of the women breastfed at all; for those who did,\naverage cumulative time, over all births, was less than 10\nmonths.\nUse of exogenous hormones prior to age 40 years. Although\ndata on cycles occurring during exogenous hormone use were\nexcluded, these substances may affect the timing of menopause\nlater in life. Therefore, a dichotomous variable indicating\nwhether the subject used exogenous hormones prior to age 40\nFIGURE 1.

(We also tested variables\nrepresenting hormone use within each 5-year age segment.\nNone of these variables was significant, and we therefore\nsimplified the model by using one dichotomous variable.)\nUse of exogenous hormones after age 40 years.

We included a dichotomous\nvariable to indicate whether the subject reported a birth after\nAlthough the Cox survival models allowed us to examine\nthe data prospectively, we also examined the data retrospec-\ntively to explore aggregate characteristics prior to meno-\npause in the subset of women for whom menopause was\nobserved. For these analyses, we aligned cycle information\nas of the date of menopause (time 0) and followed cycle\npatterns back over the years preceding menopause. We\nexamined the mean, standard deviation, and serial irregu-\nlarity (ApEn).\nRESULTS\nThe overall hazard of menopause (without covariates)\nwhen Kaplan-Meier estimates were used is shown in figure\n4. Consistent with earlier work on these data (2), median age\nat menopause was 50.5 years; 75 percent of women reached\nyears.\nResults of the hazard modeling are shown in table 3.\nModel 1 included the cycle patterns and other covariates\nprior to age 40 years for each woman. Age at menarche and\nnumber of births were inversely related to the hazard; corre-\nspondingly, later age at menarche and a greater number of\nbirths were associated with later age at menopause. We\nfound no statistically discernible relation between age at\nmenopause and use of hormones prior to age 40 years or\nnumber of months of breastfeeding. Cycle characteristics\nprior to age 40 years were not, in general, significantly\nrelated to age at menopause, although there was a marginally\nsignificant (p = 0.059) relation between high variability in\ncycle length at ages 35\u00ad39 years and earlier onset of meno-\npause.\nModel 2 introduced time-varying covariates for the mean,\nstandard deviation, and ApEn of cycle length after age 40\nyears. Relative to model 2, the improvement in fit of the\nmodel attributable to adding the cycle characteristics after\nFIGURE 2. Profiles of two women's histories of intermenstrual intervals. Data from the Menstruation and Reproductive History Study (The\nage 40 years was statistically significant (p < 0.001). After\nage 40 years, cycle characteristics were related to onset of\nmenopause: higher standard deviation was significantly\nassociated (p = 0.05) with increased hazard (i.e., earlier\nonset). ApEn was significantly and strongly, but inversely,\nassociated (p < 0.001) with the hazard. When the mean and\nstandard deviation were held constant, we found that the\nhigher the ApEn (the greater the irregularity), the lower the\nhazard. Lower ApEn after age 40 years--greater regu-\nlarity--was strongly predictive of the onset of menopause.\nOverall, as cycles became longer, more variable, and yet\nmore regular (with lower ApEn), the hazard of menopause\nincreased. A break in history after age 40 years was associ-\nated with a significantly lower hazard of menopause; in our\ndata, there was no discernible relation between a birth after\nage 40 years and the hazard.\nInsight into these results was most easily gained from the\n\"retrospective\" analysis, shown in figure 5. Cycle character-\nistics were aligned as of the onset of menopause, with time\nrunning \"backward\" from 0 (age at menopause). The\nfamiliar aggregate pattern of increases in both mean and\nstandard deviation during the menopausal transition can be\nseen (20). ApEn was equally striking: in the aggregate,\nApEn rose slightly (irregularity increased) until about 8\nyears prior to menopause, when it declined dramatically. In\nother words, regularity increased sharply in the years\npreceding menopause.\nFIGURE 3. Summary statistics for profiles of two women's histories of intermenstrual intervals.

Cox regression modeling of age at menopause on controls and cycle characteristics for data\nfrom the Menstruation and Reproductive History Study (The Tremin Trust), United States, 1930\u00ad1977\n A central assumption of Cox proportional hazards models is that the effect of a given variable is the same\nwithin any time segment. The Schoenfeld test (39) was used for proportionality of hazards to examine this\nassumption. The test resulted in a global 2 statistic of 13.88 (p = 0.79); no single 2 statistic exceeded a value of\n6.54. The Schoenfeld test is highly sensitive; the results supported use of the Cox proportional hazards model.\n Dummy variables were used to test for the effects of missing data on cycle characteristics (mean, standard\ndeviation, approximate entropy) in each 5-year age group. These indicators were not significant and were\ndropped from the model. The respondent's year of birth was also tested and was dropped from the model\nbecause it was not significant. Also tested was whether a more detailed characterization of hormone use prior to\nage 40 years (using 5-year age groups) would improve model fit. These variables were not significant, so two\ndichotomous variables (hormone use prior to age 40 years, hormone use after age 40 years) were used in the\nfinal models.\n\u00a7 Dummy variables were used to test for the effects of missing data on cycle characteristics after age 40\nyears (mean, standard deviation, approximate entropy). These indicators were not significant and were dropped\nfrom the model. Also tested was whether the length of a break in history after age 40 years was related to the\nhazard. It was not included in the final model because it was not significant.\n\u00b6 Robust standard errors that adjust for clustering attributable to multiple observations per subject.\nCovariate\nHazard\nratio\nStandard error of\nthe hazard ratio\u00b6\nHazard\nratio\nStandard error of\nthe hazard ratio\u00b6\nUse of hormones prior to age 40\nMean\nStandard deviation\nApproximate entropy\nCycle length, ages 40 years\nDISCUSSION\nWhelan et al. (2), who used these same data to explore\nfactors associated with age at menopause, found that short\ncycle length between ages 20 and 35 years was associated\nwith earlier onset of menopause, even while controlling for\nvariability, but that the effect of high variability, which was\nassociated with later onset, did not persist in the presence of\ncontrols for cycle length. Our study, in contrast, focused on\nthe joint effects of cycle characteristics while simultaneously\nadjusting for age at menarche, months of breastfeeding, and\nuse of exogenous hormones. Considered jointly, no statisti-\ncally discernible effect of cycle characteristics (mean length,\nvariability, and irregularity) between ages 15 and 39 years\nwas found on age at menopause. This result is in sharp\ncontrast to our finding that after age 40 years, both higher\nvariability and greater regularity were significant predictors\nof the onset of menopause. Our findings with respect to age\nat menarche and number of births are consistent with those\nof other researchers (4).\nWe speculate that the underlying causal mechanism relating\nboth breastfeeding and pregnancy to age at menopause lies in\nthe relation between follicular atresia and estrogen. Estrogen\nhas been found to be important in inhibiting follicular atresia\n(32\u00ad35), and it plays a significant role in stimulating follicle\ngrowth and maturation: Atretic follicles show a decreased\nestrogen-to-androgen ratio, evidence for the apoptosis-inhib-\niting and -inducing effect of the respective hormones (36).\nChanges in steroid levels most likely play a role in initiation of\napoptosis. When estrogen is withdrawn completely, apoptotic\nDNA fragmentation in the granulose cells of the ovary\nincreases. Estrogens inhibit apoptosis in the ovary, while\nandrogens and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists\npromote apoptosis (37). Atretic follicles show decreased\nestrogen production, an important factor in follicle survival\n(38). During pregnancy, estrogen levels are high, an environ-\nment that inhibits follicular atresia. During lactation, when\nestrogen levels remain low, apoptotic cell loss is promoted.\nThus, pregnancy delays onset of menopause, while lactation is\nassociated with earlier onset.\nBecause we expected that secular changes in nutrition,\nparticularly in use of fats, might affect age at menopause, we\ntested for, but did not find, an effect associated with birth\nyear. However, all women in the study were born within a\nfairly short time. Data currently being collected and entered\nfrom women who have been participating in The Tremin\nTrust study since the 1960s will enable us to examine\nwhether there has been such a change over time. We also\nfound that women who had a break in their reports after age\n40 years (although they subsequently resumed data\nrecording) were likely to have a later age at menopause\ncompared with women who provided uninterrupted data.\nThis result may be an artifact: the later the age at menopause,\nthe longer the exposure to the risk of interruption.\nA parallel can be drawn between the findings of this study\nand changes in patterns of hormonal secretion as women\napproach menopause. Matt et al. (31) compared healthy late\npremenopausal women (aged 39\u00ad49 years) with younger\nwomen (aged 26\u00ad29 years) whose menstrual cycles and\nbody weights were normal; ApEn scores for patterns of\nluteinizing hormone release for late premenopausal women\nwere lower (more regular) than for younger women (corrob-\norated by analyses from \"pulse identification\" algorithms).\nThe decrease in ApEn was followed by a pronounced\nincrease in ApEn scores for older postmenopausal women\n(30). These researchers hypothesized that the decrease and\nnonmonotonicity in ApEn luteinizing hormone evolution\nthat precede menopause may reflect system instability prior\nto dramatic state change. Our findings suggest that the\ndecline in ApEn characterizing cycle lengths may be an indi-\nrect marker of corresponding underlying hormonal changes.\nThis study shows that, while cycle length and variability\nincrease with the approach of menopause, regularity also\nincreases and is a strong predictor of its onset--an important\nFIGURE 5.
