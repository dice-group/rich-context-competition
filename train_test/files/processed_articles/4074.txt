The aim of the present study, there-\nfore, was to evaluate RNFL thickness in\nadult women with iron deficiency anaemia,\nand in age- and sex-matched healthy control\nsubjects.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study sequentially recruited women\naged 19\u00ad54 years who were diagnosed with\niron deficiency anaemia at the haematology\npolyclinic of Recep Tayyip Erdogan\nUniversity School of Medicine Research\nand Training Hospital, Rize, Turkey,\ndeficiency anaemia was defined as haemo-\nglobin (Hb) concentrations <12 g/dl and\nferritin concentrations <15 mg/l.\nWomen without iron deficiency anaemia\nwho were attending the Internal Medicine\noutpatient clinic of Recep Tayyip Erdogan\nUniversity School of Medicine Research and\nTraining Hospital, Rize, Turkey for routine\ncheck-up procedures were recruited as con-\ntrol subjects. Control subjects were required\nto be free from major disease (including solid\ncancers, haematological, renal and hepatic\ndiseases and rheumatological disorders).\nExclusion criteria for both patients and\ncontrol subjects were glaucoma, strabismus,\nretinal disease, corneal abnormalities,\nintraocular pressure >21 mmHg in either\neye, previous ophthalmic surgery or ocular\ntrauma, age-related macular degeneration,\nmyopia, hyperopia !3 diopters, use of ster-\noid or antiglaucoma drugs.\nThis study adhered to the tenets of the\nDeclaration of Helsinki and was approved\nby the ethics committee of Recep Tayyip\nErdogan University School of Medicine,\nRize, Turkey. All participants provided\nwritten informed consent before being\nincluded in the study.\nOphthalmic examination\nA detailed ophthalmic examination\n(including assessment of refractive error\nand intraocular pressure, slit-lamp examin-\nation, and fundoscopy) was performed for\neach study participant. All participants\nunderwent peripapillary RNFL thickness\nmeasurement via Cirrus\u00d5 HD spectral-\ndomain OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin,\nCA, USA). OCT was performed without\npupil dilatation and by a single investigator\n(K.T.). Peripapillary RNFL thicknesses of\nthe temporal, nasal, inferior and superior\nquadrants, as well as average RNFL thick-\nness, were assessed using an optic disc\nthickness (CAT), central subfield thickness\n(CST) and cube volume (CV) were mea-\nsured. Scans with signal strength <8 and\nthose during which blinking occurred were\nexcluded from the study.\nLaboratory analyses\nFull blood count was determined using\nstandard methods and automated haema-\ntology analyser (CELL-DYN Ruby; Abbott\nLaboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA).\nSerum iron and iron-binding capacity were\nevaluated photometrically with an Architect\nand serum ferritin was assessed via chemi-\nluminescent microparticle immunoassay\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as mean\u00c6SD.\nFollowing Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov testing\nfor normality of distribution, between-\ngroup comparisons were made using\nStudent's t-test or Mann\u00adWhitney U-test,\nas appropriate. Relationships between\nRNFL thickness and serum haemoglobin,\niron and ferritin concentrations, total iron-\nbinding capacity and mean corpuscular\nvolume (MCV) in the patient and control\ngroups were assessed separately using\nPearson's correlation coefficient analysis.\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS\u00d5 version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA) for Windows\u00d5, and P-values < 0.05\nwere considered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe study included 40 female patients with\niron deficiency anaemia (mean age\nand 40 age- and sex-matched healthy control\nrange 19\u00ad52 years). Clinical characteristics\nof the patient and control groups are given\nin Table 1. There were significant between-\ngroup differences in haemoglobin, serum\niron and ferritin concentrations, MCV and\ntotal iron-binding capacity (P < 0.001 for\neach comparison; Table 1).\nData regarding OCT parameters are\nshown in Table 2. RNFL thickness in both\nthe nasal and the inferior quadrants were\nsignificantly thinner in the patient group\nthan in the control group (P \u00bc 0.042 and\nP \u00bc 0.047, respectively). There were no other\nstatistically significant between-group\ndifferences.\nIn the patient group, there were signifi-\ncant positive correlations between inferior\nRNFL thickness and Hb concentration\nRNFL thickness and serum iron (r \u00bc 0.263;\nstatistically significant correlations in the\npatient group. There were no statistically\nsignificant correlations between RNFL\nthickness and any parameter in the control\ngroup.\nTable 1.

In contrast, children with\niron deficiency anaemia have been found to\nhave lower average, superior and inferior\nRNFL thicknesses compared with controls.7\nA further study evaluating RNFL thick-\nnesses in children with thalassaemia major\nor iron deficiency anaemia showed that\nRNFL thicknesses were decreased in all\nquadrants in children with thalassemia\nmajor, but in the inferior quadrant only in\nchildren with iron deficiency anemia.8 The\ninconsistencies between these studies and\nour own may be a result of differences in the\nstudy populations. It is possible that the\ncontinuing development of the nervous\nsystem in children may render their nerve\nfibres more sensitive to changes in serum\niron concentrations.\nIt is well established that iron per-\nforms important functions in the central\nnervous system, including nerve myelination\nand neurotransmitter synthesis.9\nOligodendrocytes are crucial for mye-\nlination, and iron deficiency adversely\naffects the normal functioning of these\ncells.10 Iron affects myelin synthesis, both\ndirectly as a cofactor of cholesterol and lipid\nbiosynthesis and indirectly as an oxidative\nmetabolism component in oligodendro-\ncytes.11 The high iron and transferrin levels\npresent in newborns underline the import-\nance of iron in the development of the\nnervous system.4 RNFL thicknesses in\nanaemic women were correlated with Hb,\niron and ferritin concentrations as well as\nwith total iron-binding capacity in the pre-\nsent study.\nThe reduced RNFL thickness in patients\nwith anaemia compared with control sub-\njects observed in the present study is likely\ndue to hypomyelination caused by iron\ndeficiency. Iron deficiency is known to play\nan aetiological role in neurally-mediated\nCorrection of anaemia led to improvements\nin brain function independent of iron levels\nin patients with anaemia unrelated to iron\nTable 2.

In\npatients with sickle-cell disease, vascular\nocclusions can lead to ischaemic retinop-\nathy, and these patients have thinner peri-\npapillary RNFL than healthy control\nsubjects.16 This may explain the correlation\nbetween ischaemic status and peripapillary\nRNFL thickness. Iron deficiency anaemia is\nknown to reduce spontaneous blinking rates\nby triggering dopaminergic dysfunction.17\nSince dopamine is the major retinal neuro-\ntransmitter,18 it would be logical to assume\nthat dopaminergic dysfunction was an add-\nitional factor for the RNFL reductions\nobserved in our study.\nMalnutrition and deficiencies in trace\nelements (including iron, zinc and copper)\ncause detrimental changes in the optic\nnerve.4 Trace element status in iron defi-\nciency anaemia is mainly influenced by\nmetabolic interactions between these elem-\nents.19 Decreases in peripapillary RNFL\nthickness may therefore be influenced by\ndeficiencies in other trace elements besides\niron.\nThe present study has several limitations.\nThe sample size was small and it was not\npossible to subdivide groups according to\nseverity and duration of anaemia. In add-\nition, we did not re-evaluate peripapillary\nRNFL thickness after iron supplementation\ntreatment.\nThe present study shows that iron defi-\nciency anaemia reduces RNFL thickness in\nadult women. Further studies are necessary\nto reveal the clinical importance of these\nfindings, and to determine whether these\nchanges could be reversed by treating the\nanaemia.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
