We\nidentified seven genes involved in AngII signalling pathways.\nConclusion: We here report novel insight of an extensive network of molecular pathways that fine-tuned by miR-\n132/212, suggesting a role for this miRNA family as master signalling switches in cardiac fibroblasts.

Hence, the AngII type 1\nreceptor (AT1\nR) is a prominent drug target in cardiovascu-\nlar medicine.

In brief, 8\u00ad10-week-old male Sprague-\nDawley rats (Taconic, Denmark) were sacrificed and\nhearts were rinsed in a preparation buffer (1.2 mM\nIE/ml Heparin). Arterial tissue and visible vasculature\nwere removed and ventricles were trypsinised twice for 10\nmin in 10 ml 0.08% Trypsin (BD, New Jersey, USA) sup-\nplemented with DNase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA).\nTissue fragments were washed, minced and incubated with\n9500 U Collagenase Type 2 (Worthington Biochemical\nCorp., USA) in HBSS (Gibco, Life Technologies, USA)\nand supplemented with DNase, for 70 min disrupted by\nswirling. The suspension was dissociated by thorough\npipetting in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine\ntomycin (PS) (Gibco, Life Technologies, USA) before\nbeing passed across a 100 \u00b5m filter (DB, New Jersey,\nUSA). Cells were incubated for 6 min on ice with 0.9%\n, 20 \u00b5M Tetrasodium EDTA for\nlysis of erythrocytes and washed before the suspension\nwas pre-plated for 1 h in cell culture dishes in\nDMEM/10%FBS/1%PS. After 1 h, the cultures were\nwashed thoroughly with PBS and the remaining adherent\ncells were cultivated for 3 days to sub-confluence (~80%)\nand used directly as specified in the text. Cells were\ndeprived of serum for 1 h prior to stimulation with 100 nM\nAngII (Sigma-Aldricht, St. Louis, USA).\nCell number and volume\nAfter 44 h, cultured cells were gently detached by 0.25%\nTrypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, USA).\nCells were resuspended and diluted in isotonic fluid and\ncounted in the range of 8\u00ad24 \u00b5m.
