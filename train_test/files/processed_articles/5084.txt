Repurposing online\ndata to design alternative views\nGabriele Colombo, Paolo Ciuccarelli and Michele Mauri\n Keywords\nImage, territory, geography, visualization, place, design\nIntroduction\nThe nature of data generated by humans and machines\nis increasingly more heterogeneous, visual, and geo-\ngraphical. Humans are producing more photos than\never before: from the array of figures that cyclically\nare used to underpin the increasing visuality of our\nsociety, one of the most striking is the one comparing\nthe amount of photographs taken every two minutes by\nAmericans only to those taken in the entire 19th cen-\ntury (Mirzoeff, 2016). Thanks to location-aware tech-\nnologies embedded in mobile devices, a large part of\nthis massive visual production is building up a corpus\nof visual material pinned to physical locations.\nCoverage of panoramic views by Google Street has\nexpanded to reach an unprecedented number of cities,\nremote areas, historical landmarks, and indoor loca-\ntions worldwide. Similar technologies have been\ndeployed by open communities with the goal of produ-\ncing an alternative crowd-sourced photographic map-\nping of our surroundings. Active satellites constantly\ngenerate streams of high-resolution footage of the\nground, online communities organize themselves with\nDIY technologies--such as balloon and kite map-\nping--to produce alternative photographic footage\nfrom above, and private companies sell drones able to\ncapture high-resolution maps and 3D models of the\nground.\nPictures taken and shared on social media, overhead\nimagery, and street-level photographic mapping consti-\ntute an incredibly rich corpus of location-based visual\nmaterial, partly available online. In the last years this\navailability inspired a number of reactions from\nresearchers, designers, and artists that have attempted\nat reusing this material with different intentions. Direct\nvisualizations of thousands of photos from social\nmedia, superimposition of similar images collected\nfrom the web, computer-generated collages of Google\nImage results, handpicked strips of street view imagery\nrearranged as catalogs: what seems to be a leading\nthread of these experiences is the use of location-\nbased visual material found online as raw footage,\nrepurposed to design, through more or less invasive\nmanipulations, alternative views and perspectives on\nour surroundings.\nDensityDesign Lab--Politecnico di Milano, Italy\nCorresponding author:\nPaolo Ciuccarelli, DensityDesign Lab--Politecnico di Milano, Via\nDurando, 10, c/o POLIteca--Politecnico di Milano, Milano 20159, Italy.\nEmail: paolo.ciuccarelli@polimi.it\nCreative Commons NonCommercial-NoDerivs CC BY-NC-ND: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Com-\nmons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) which permits\nnon-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work as published without adaptation or alteration, without further permission provided the\noriginal work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nBig Data & Society\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/bds\nTelling a story about urban changes using historical\nStreet View panoramas; visualizing the materiality of\nhigh frequency trading through location-based user-\ngenerated content and Street View imagery; make a\npoint about geographical visual stereotypes using col-\nlages of Google Image search results; inviting to recon-\nsider formal repetitions in human-built infrastructures\nby selecting and rearranging satellite footage: these\nexperiments resonate with the definition of a map as a\nsystem of proposition rather than a representation\n(Wood and Fels, 2008). They are artifacts designed\nwith a specific intention that goes beyond the mere rep-\nresentation of space: they highlight unexpected connec-\ntions, help to imagine alternative spatial configurations,\nor expose the way in which geographical landmarks are\nperceived.\nAlthough using various types of material and apply-\ning different techniques, one may identify three (some-\ntimes overlapping) approaches in which footage\ncollected online is repurposed:\n. Repurposing available satellite imagery with various\nstrategies (from the design of interfaces for accessing\nthe footage in novel ways to the superimposition of\ndata layers);\n. Adding materiality to an array of geo-coordinates\nthrough the selection and rearrangement of hetero-\ngeneous visual material found online;\n. Extracting visual signature of specific places--or\ntheir cliche\n\u00b4 d representation--by means of selection\nand visual manipulation of different sized collections\nof user-generated content.\nThe view from above: Repurposing\navailable satellite imagery\nThe view from above, once prerogative of the (military)\npower, is now a democratized view: with an incredible\nlevel of detail, submeter satellite footage covering\nextensive areas of the globe is now available to\nanyone. The fruition and exploration of this material\nis however limited to available services, with predefined\nexploration patterns and functionalities. Design has\nproved to be very effective in transforming available\nraw data sources into actionable knowledge, by struc-\nturing and presenting data and information in mean-\ningful ways (Bonsiepe, 2000). Terrapattern represents\nan effort to design an entry point into the increasing\navailability of high-resolution photographic mappings\nof the world (Figure 1). Described by the authors as\n``similar-image search for satellite photos,'' it offers a\nsimple interface for performing ``visual query by exam-\nple'' on satellite footage. It allows to search and localize\nvisual features that can reveal undiscovered stories\nabout humanity's impact into the world (including\nfracking wells, animal herds, logging roads, and con-\nstruction sites).\nTerrapattern is not the first and isolated attempt at\nexploiting satellite imagery to map human and natural\nactivities. Other experiments exploit the same view with\ndifferent techniques: from visual manipulations of the\nfootage itself to the superimposition of additional data\nlayers, performed through graphical annotation of the\nmaterial. Examples include the estimation of global oil\nsupply by monitoring and analysis of storage tanks seen\nfrom above (Orbital Insight, 2016); a ``near real-time\ndeforestation monitoring system'' to promote conserva-\ntion in the Andean Amazon region of South America\n(Amazon Conservation Association and Conservacio\n\u00b4 n\nAmazo\n\u00b4 nica, 2015); whale population assessment in the\nArgentinian coast (Fretwell et al., 2014); identification of\nwar signs and documentation of human right violations\n(The Enough Project and DigitalGlobe, 2010). Although\nstill limitedtoafew urbanareas,whatmakesTerrapattern\ndifferent compared to these examples is its exploratory\nnature and the promise of making the search process of\nsatellite footage available also to nonexpert users.\nA different response to the availability of highly accur-\nate photographic rendering of the view from above is the\none offered by artist Jenny Odell. In her Satellite\ninfrastructural elements (e.g., swimming pools, nuclear\ncooling towers, stadium, basketball courts) from Google\nEarth and reorganizes them, decontextualized from their\nbackground, into compact aggregates (Figure 2).\nSelection and decontextualization force to observe\nthose elements anew, reducing background noises. The\nauthor describes the project as an invite to exercise obser-\nvation of--and stimulate curiosity toward--``our own\ninimitably human landscape'' (Odell, 2013). The tech-\nnique, if applied systematically to footage from different\nareas, can provide a glimpse into the impact of man-\nmade landscape modifications, by region.\nAdding materiality to geo-coordinates\nthrough web imagery\nVisual elements can provide that material dimension\nthat is somehow lacking in most of (big) data-driven\nanalysis (Cardullo, 2015). Photographs and visual foot-\nage may be used to provide context and materiality to a\ncollection of geo-coordinates.\nThe project Officer Involved (2016), by Josh Begley,\nuses imagery from the web to add a visual layer to a\ndatabase on police brutality compiled by The Guardian.\nThe database contains data on people killed by law\nenforcement agencies in the United States in the last\ntwo years (including demographics, location, and\ndate). Officer Involved, featured in the online outlet\nThe Intercept, presents each of those location data as\nan image extracted either from Google Street View or\nGoogle Maps satellite footage, providing what Teju\nCole (2015) has defined ``an immersion in the environ-\nment of someone's last moments.'' The images, cap-\ntioned with the victim's name and the city where the\nkilling occurred, compose a large catalog of empty\nintersections, town sidewalks, and suburban streets.\nIsolated from the seamless continuum of Google\nMaps and reorganized as an array of elements, those\napparently insignificant places constitute a reminder of\nthe breadth of the phenomenon, providing at the same\ntime the specificity of each single killing (Figure 3). Josh\nBegley is not new to these kinds of interventions, work-\ning with visual footage in order to add context to (loca-\ntion) data. Previous examples include a collection of\nbird's-eye views of U.S. prison buildings (Begley,\n2012) as well as a catalog of satellite views of reported\ndeath locations of migrants trying to cross the U.S.\nBritish artist James Bridle (2012) worked in a similar\ndirection with the project Dronestagram. For almost\nthree years, he collected and posted on Instagram\n(cross-posting on Tumblr and Twitter) satellite images\nof locations of drone strikes as they occurred. Strike\ntime and location data were provided by The Bureau\nof Investigative Journalism, which at the time reported\non drone wars in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. The\naccount, in the words of the artist, contributed to make\ndrone strikes (and their location) ``a little more visible,\na little closer. A little more real.''\nThe project Scandaglio (2016), by Italian collective\nOfftopic Lab (www.offtopiclab.org) reuses Google\nStreet View imagery to visually enhance a mapping of\nabandoned areas undertaken by the municipality of\nMilan. The timeline feature embedded in Google\nStreet View, which allows to see images of a location\ntaken in the past by Google cars, is repurposed here as\na visual evidence machine. The project provides an\nexplorable interface of more than 100 locations in the\ncity (empty buildings, abandoned green areas, construc-\ntion sites) as captured by Google in different years,\nallowing monitoring urban development overtime\n(Figure 4).\nReconciling geo-coordinates with their surroundings\nis also the intention of the project ``A Network of\nFragments/Fragments from Networks'' by Benoi^t\nVerjat and Donato Ricci. The interactive installation,\npart of the exhibition Reset Modernity!, ``aims to make\nvisible local fragments of various networks used for\nHigh Frequency Trading.'' For each coordinate of\nthis network, a view of the surroundings is offered by\njuxtaposing content from different sources (Google's\nsatellite imagery, Google Street View, and Instagram),\nFigure 1.

According to\nMary Meeker's 2016 Internet Trends report, every\nday over three billion images are uploaded and shared\non Facebook-owned platforms and Snapchat alone\n(Meeker, 2016). With geotagging features becoming\npopular in most social media platforms, such a large\ncorpus of content, as well as the metadata attached to\nit, are increasingly exploited by researchers to study\nurban dynamics and structures (Crandall et al., 2009;\nHochman and Manovich, 2013; Hollenstein and\nPurves, 2010). The project Phototrails by Nadav\nHochman at al. (2013) uses large collections of geo-\ntagged Instagram images to compare ``global cities'\nvisual signatures.'' The observation of such visual sig-\nnatures is enabled by a series of transformations\n(together with specific measurements) applied on the\ncollected material: images are drastically reduced in\ntheir size and organized in different layouts, according\nto measured values or metadata (e.g., median hue,\nbrightness mean, time of upload). The techniques\nenable the detection of spatial and temporal visual pat-\nterns in large collections of geo-referenced images, and\nthe key transformation that makes it possible is the\nreduction of each element to a smaller size, where\ndetails are lost in favor of focusing the attention on\nformal features (Figure 6).\nA different technique for distilling a place signature\nfrom visual material collected online may be found in\nthe project ``CIRCA'' by Federica Bardelli (Figure 7).\nThe project aims at repurposing results from local ver-\nsion of Google Image Search to observe how national\nidentities are reciprocally represented and perceived by\ndifferent countries. In the part of the project dedicated\nto landscape observation, images of iconic buildings for\neach country are manually selected from the results\n(e.g., mosques for Turkey, the coliseum, and the leaning\ntower of Pisa for Italy) and then aggregated into com-\nposite visualizations based on each national image col-\nlections. The outcomes function as ``comparable\nrepresentations'' enabling the observation of ``the meta-\nmorphosis of specific cliche\n\u00b4 ,'' with the shifting of the\npoint of view.\nFigure 3.

In the series\ntitled ``The collective snapshot'' (2012), he selects\nsimilar-looking images of iconic landmarks and then\noverlays them to create what he defines ``an abstrac-\ntion of the places we have been'' (Wilson, 2012). The\ntechnique, similarly used by artist Corinne Vionnet in\nrepetition in photographic formats and compositions,\nproviding a reflection on the extent to which afford-\nable image capturing technologies have limited rather\nthan expanded our ability to look at our surround-\nings. The project Le Myope (2016) from Paris-based\nartist Vincent Sapajou offers a playful response to the\nsame argument. Described as a ``short-sighted\ncamera'' by the author, Le Myope is a connected\ncamera that doesn't take any new photograph but\ninstead shows its user an existing picture collected\nfrom the web, similar to the framed subject. The\ncamera, built on top of the similar-image feature of\nGoogle Search, comes with code and instructions for\nanyone to build their own.\nConclusions\ndenounced a lack of representation of our\nsurroundings, resulting in an essential inability to\nrelate with our environment:\nTelevision is 99% made of faces. Our surroundings are\nnever represented. I believe that this negation of the\nspace we inhabit is a very relevant fact: the inability\nto relate with our space and environment is linked to\nan absence of representation; and somehow, to a neg-\nligence about environmental issues. (Translation by the\nauthors)\nOur surroundings are now extensively mapped: by\nusers uploading photos on social media and community\nundertaking visual mapping projects, by Google cars\ndriving through cities and trekkers reaching remote\nareas, by satellites orbiting overhead and drones\nflying over fields and construction sites. Nevertheless,\nthis abundant visual footage risks to be lost in the digi-\ntal stream of visual production that, as argued by\nTrevor Paglen (2016) in a recent essay, is ``fundamen-\ntally machine-readable'' and ``can only be seen by\nhumans in special circumstances and for short periods\nof time.'' The presented projects constitute a positive\nreaction to put this footage at use: by experimenting\nwith a number of visual manipulation tech-\nniques--automatic collage, superimposition of thou-\nsands of photos, decontextualization, sampling--they\nextract this material from the stream of machine-\nFigure 7.
