The primary outcome was\nreceiving a Pap test and its relationship to initiation of\nsexual activity. A multivariable model was used to predict\nthe probability of having had a Pap test in the previous 12\nmonths.\nRESULTS: Thirty-three percent of the 2,513 women had\nnever had sex. Of these, 13.9% had had a Pap test in the\nprevious year. Sixty-seven percent of sexually-active\nwomen aged 15-24 reported receiving a Pap test (corre-\nsponding to 13.1 million tests). Approximately 59%\nwomen aged 15\u00ad20 years old who reported having initi-\nated sexual activity in the previous 3 years also reported\na Pap test in the previous year.\nCONCLUSION: The current guidelines recommend\nscreening 3 years after initiation of vaginal intercourse or\nat age 21, whichever is earlier. Contrary to the current\nguidelines, many young women who have not had sex or\nwho initiated sex within the previous 3 years reported\nhaving had a Pap test. Assuming that the patterns ob-\nserved in this study persist, there is an urgent need for\neducation regarding the need to adhere to guidelines to\nreduce the burden of potentially unnecessary Pap tests in\nyoung women.\nThe initiation of sexual activity has been used as\na sentinel event to start cervical cancer screen-\ning in the United States. Previous guidelines in the\n1990s advised women and their physicians to be-\ngin screening at age 18 or on initiation of sexual\nactivity.1\u00ad3 Recent advances in cervical cancer screen-\ning and an improved understanding of the natural\nhistory of human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical\ncancer have resulted in revised screening guidelines,\nincluding raising the age at which to start screening.\nIn general, these newer guidelines recommend that a\nwoman's first Pap test be delayed to either 3 years\nafter first vaginal intercourse (one guideline says\nwithin 3 years) or to age 21, whichever comes first.4\u00ad6\nTherefore, it is important to study the linkage be-\ntween age, first sex, and receipt of Pap testing to\ninform current and future cervical cancer screening\nguidelines. We examined the only national data\nsource that has information on both Pap testing and\nage at first sex to understand whether and how\nrecency of sexual activity is associated with Pap\ntesting rates among young women.\nFrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Coordinating\nCenter for Health Promotion, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control,\nEpidemiology and Applied Research Branch, and National Coordinating Center\nfor Health Marketing, National Center for Health Statistics, Division of Vital\nStatistics, Reproductive Statistics Branch, Atlanta, Georgia; and the Division of\nEpidemiology and Community Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis,\nMinnesota.*Dr. Glaser is currently at the University of Arizona College of\nMedicine, Tucson, Arizona.\nThe authors thank Mary White, PhD, Stephanie Ventura, MA, Julia Holmes,\nPhD, and Jami Leichliter, PhD, for sharing their knowledge of the survey and\nproviding input on the manuscript.\nPresented in part at the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists Cervical Cancer\nForum, September 12, 2008, Chicago, Illinois, and at the Practice Improvement\nin Cervical Screening and Management Committee's Symposium on Cervical\nCancer Screening and Management of Cervical Abnormalities in Adolescents and\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not\nnecessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention.\nCorresponding author: Mona Saraiya, MD, MPH, CDC, 4770 Buford High-\nFinancial Disclosure\nThe authors did not report any potential conflicts of interest.\n\u00a9 2009 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

The 2002\nNational Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) is an\nin-person, population-based survey of both males and\nfemales of reproductive age within households in the\nUnited States. The survey is designed to be nationally\nrepresentative of females and males aged 15\u00ad44 years\nliving in the United States.7 The response rate was\n80% among women and girls. Survey participants are\nqueried on a range of behaviors and attitudes related\nto sexual intercourse, family planning, and family\ngrowth. Women and girls aged 15\u00ad24 years as well as\nHispanic and African-American women were over-\nUnited States, completed the interview.\nThe outcomes of interest in our analysis were\ninitiation of sexual activity and its relationship to\nhaving a Pap test. Each female participant was asked,\n\"In the past 12 months, have you received a Pap test?\"\nEach female participant was asked if she had ever had\nsexual intercourse using the question, \"At any time in\nyour life, have you ever had sexual intercourse with a\nman, that is, made love, had sex, or gone all the way?\"\nFor the purposes of this part of the survey, intercourse\nwas defined as heterosexual vaginal intercourse. Re-\nspondents who reported that they had ever had\nheterosexual vaginal intercourse were defined as hav-\ning had sex. Additionally, each participant was asked\nher age of first vaginal intercourse (age at first sex)\nwith the question \"That very first time that you had\nsexual intercourse with a man, how old were you?\"\nMore than 99% of these respondents provided the\nspecific month and year at which first sexual inter-\ncourse occurred. Our analysis was limited to younger\nwomen, aged 15\u00ad24 years at the time of the interview,\nto allow for recency of first sexual intercourse and to\nallow us to capture key time periods (eg, 3 years after\nfirst sexual intercourse).8 We examined age at time of\ninterview using single age categories and various\ngroups (younger than 18, younger than 21) based on\nvarious screening guidelines.\nA multivariable model was used to predict the\nprobability of having had a Pap test in the previous 12\nmonths, with inclusion of the following potential\nfactors that may increase a visit to the doctor and\ntherefore increase likelihood of getting a Pap test: age\nsex (no sex, within previous 12 months, within previ-\nmonths and over), race and Hispanic origin (white,\nAfrican American, Hispanic), mother's education\n(less than high school, high school, some college,\nbachelor's degree or higher), pregnancy in the previ-\nous 12 months (yes, no), current use of hormonal\ncontraceptives (yes, no), and receipt of public assis-\ntance in the previous 12 months (yes, no). All analyses\nwere performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary,\nNC). Additionally, SUDAAN 9.0 (RTI International,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC) was used to take into\naccount the complex sample design of the NSFG.\nRESULTS\nhad sex, corresponding to 13.1 million.

Whether one examines our\nfindings by the earlier screening guidelines on when\nto start screening or by the current screening guide-\nlines,9 the number of potentially unnecessary Pap tests\namong young women and girls is important to docu-\nment. In 2002, when most respondents completed the\ninterview, the 1995 guidelines for performing cervical\ncancer screening stated that women and girls should\nbe screened after initiating sexual intercourse or at\nage 18, whichever is earlier. Given the sample and\ndesign of this survey, we can extrapolate our findings\nto the number of U.S. women. This means that\ntests were performed on the 4 million girls under the\nage of 18 years who had not had sex. The results also\nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists/Ameri-\ncan Cancer Society Guidelines, which recommend\nthat screening begin approximately 3 years after onset\nof sexual activity but no later than age 21.

In addition, among those women\nmillion who had first sex within the previous 3 years\nhad a Pap test in the previous 12 months. Or,\nalternatively, if one considers age 21, regardless of\nsexual activity, there were approximately 4.7 million\nwomen and girls younger than 21 who had had a Pap\ntest in the previous year.\nOur analysis of current behaviors among women\nand girls is important in the context of recent devel-\nopments in cervical cancer prevention, screening, and\nmanagement.

A concern with screening sooner than 3 years\nafter the onset of sexual activity is that screening is\nTable 2.

Additionally, treatment of transient HPV\ncervical dysplasia in younger women is associated\nwith adverse pregnancy outcomes.14,15 A recent pro-\nspective study in the United Kingdom shows that\nscreening women aged 20\u00ad24 years had no effect on\ncervical cancer rates in women younger than 30.16\nThis study is limited by the self-reported nature of\nsurvey data on sexual behavior and Pap tests. Studies\nconfirm that women are significantly more likely to\noverreport Pap tests compared with documentation of\nPap tests in the medical record and to confuse the Pap\ntest with a pelvic examination.17\u00ad19 We found that the\nprevalence of pelvic exams in the previous year was\nslightly lower than the prevalence of Pap tests at each\nsingle-year age group, possibly indicating less famil-\niarity with the pelvic examination terminology or\nconfusion with the terms.\nThe Pap tests reported are only those that oc-\ncurred in the 12 months preceding a respondent's\ninterview, not necessarily their first Pap test. There is\na possibility that many young women and girls might\nhave had their first Pap test earlier, and we may be\nunderestimating the number of women who might\nhave had their first Pap test and its relationship to\nonset or recency of starting sex. We could not exam-\nine how many women were supposed to have a Pap\ntest but did not get it because the NSFG does not ask\nwomen and girls whether they ever had a Pap test or\nhow often they get a Pap test.\nThe most recent survey of the NSFG was con-\nducted in 2002, during a time when screening guide-\nlines were changing, so it may not be entirely fair to\ncompare our findings with the current guidelines, but\nit gives us a sense of how onset and recency of sex are\nassociated with Pap testing. However, recent provider\nsurveys indicate that not much has changed since\ncologists reported that they would screen 18-year-old\n72% of certified nurse midwives stated they would\nscreen 18-year-old women within 1 month of starting\nthat half of physicians are likely to screen 18-year-old\nsexually nonexperienced women and that more than\nmonth of first sex (Yabroff KR, Saraiya M, Meissner\nHI, Haggstrom DA, Wideroff L, Yuan G, et al.\nSpecialty differences in primary care physician re-\nports of Papanicolaou test screening practices: a na-\npress.). Many reasons may exist for (over)performing\nPap tests in younger women and girls. Pap testing is\ncommon among young females who are receiving\nother reproductive health care.22 The practice of\nlinking Pap tests with both receipt of hormonal contra-\nception and prenatal care also has been documented in\nprevious studies,23,24 and they continue to be strongly\nTable 3.

In addition, concerns\nabout litigation, the misconception that cervical cancer\nis common and 100% preventable in young women,\nand a lower awareness of the natural history of HPV and\ncervical cancer also may play a role.\nIf the patterns observed in this study have per-\nsisted, there may be a need for further education and\nstronger interventions (ie, reminders, lack of reim-\nbursement) regarding current guidelines. Our current\nunderstanding of the course of HPV infection in the\nmajority of girls and young women and the financial\nand clinical burden of screening them underscores the\nimportance of providers' understanding the need for\nan increased interval between the age at which pa-\ntients report their first vaginal intercourse and the age\nat which they receive their first Pap test. Additionally,\nthese findings can help inform cost-effectiveness stud-\nies on current screening practices among girls and\nyoung women, especially as HPV vaccination cover-\nage increases. Because there are many unanswered\nquestions related to the HPV vaccine, such as dura-\ntion of protection, any change in screening recom-\nmendations as a result of the HPV vaccine is still years\naway. Currently, those who have received the vaccine\nshould continue to be screened regularly for cervical\ncancer, according to guidelines.25 Recommendations\nfor when to start screening among fully HPV-vacci-\nnated girls and women (especially those who have\nbeen screened before having had sex) have not\nchanged, but experts predict that they are likely to\nchange in the future.26 Cost-effectiveness studies have\nsuggested that both a change in the age to start\nscreening (25 years) and how often to screen (every\n3\u00ad5 years) would make the most epidemiological and\neconomic sense.27,28 As the paradigm for cervical\ncancer screening and prevention changes, continuous\nmonitoring of preventive behaviors, policies, and\ninterventions about timing of first sex, timing of first\nPap, HPV DNA testing, and HPV vaccines will be\nimportant to ensure that newer technologies are being\naccompanied by evidence-based practices.\nREFERENCES\n1.
