Richmond1\nFood insecurity has been associated with weight status in children and adults although results have been mixed.\nWe aimed to identify whether food insecurity was associated with BMI in young adults and whether this association\ndiffered by gender and was modified by food stamp use and the presence of children in the home. Cross-sectional\ndata from wave 4 (2007\u00ad2008) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were analyzed. Multiple linear\nregression was used to investigate the association between food insecurity and BMI in gender stratified models of\nyoung adult women (n = 7,116) and men (n = 6,604) controlling for age, race/ethnicity, income, education, physical\nactivity, smoking, alcohol use, the presence of children in the home, and food stamp use in young adulthood and/\nor adolescence. Food insecurity was more common in young adult women (14%) than young adult men (9%). After\ncontrolling for a variety of individual variables, food insecure women had a BMI that was on average 0.9kg/m2 units\nhigher than women who were food secure. This difference in BMI persisted after controlling for recent or past food\nstamp use and was not different among women with or without children in the household. No relationship was found\nbetween food insecurity and BMI in young adult men. Providers should inquire about food insecurity, especially when\ntreating obesity, and policy initiatives should address the role of access to healthy food in those facing food insecurity.\n1Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine, Department of Medicine, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; 2Clinical Research Program,\nChildren's Hospital Boston, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Correspondence: Holly C. Gooding (holly.gooding@childrens.harvard.edu)\narticles\n \nThe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add\nHealth), a nationally representative sample of over 15,000 par-\nticipants surveyed prospectively from adolescence into young\nadulthood, offers a unique opportunity to further clarify these\nrelationships between food insecurity and obesity. As young\nadulthood is a time of transition to self-sufficiency as well as\na critical time point in the establishment of adult obesity (28),\nthis age group may be particularly vulnerable to food insecu-\nrity and its effects on weight. Add Health also includes par-\nticipants from a wider variety of racial and ethnic groups than\npreviously studied and includes important data on parenting\nas well as receipt of supplemental assistance in young adult-\nhood and adolescence. This study uses data from Add Health\nto clarify the relationship between food insecurity and BMI by\ninvestigating whether food insecurity is differentially associ-\nated with BMI in young adult men and young adult women\nand whether a history of receiving food stamps or the presence\nof young children in the household modifies any association\nbetween food insecurity and BMI.\nMethods and Procedures\nParticipants\nThis study uses data from the fourth Wave of the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health (n = 15,701), a nationally representative\nschool-based study of adolescents enrolled in grades 7\u00ad12 at initial\nconsent was obtained at wave I and the study was approved by the insti-\ntutional review board at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill\n(29). Participants with missing data for sample weights were excluded\n(n = 901) because it was not possible to take into account the complex\nsurvey design for these individuals. Those currently pregnant (n = 487)\nwere excluded due to concern that their weight status might be influ-\nenced by factors different than in the nonpregnant population. Those\nwith height <58 inches or >84 inches, as well as those with weight <80\nlbs or >440 lbs (the maximum capacity of the scale used to weigh par-\nticipants), were also excluded due to concerns about biologic plausibil-\nity or measurement error (n = 264). In addition to these exclusions,\nthose who had missing data for either the dependent variable or for any\nof the key independent variables were excluded (n = 329). Because there\nwas a high nonresponse rate for income (~7%), income was imputed by\nGaussian normal regression in order to avoid selection bias. After this\nimputation and all exclusions, the final sample contained 13,720 young\nadults (87.4% of wave IV participants).\nOutcome measurements\nOutcome variable. BMI (weight (kg)/height (m2)) was the outcome\nvariable. BMI was calculated from measured weight and height when\navailable (98%) and from self-report in the small number of partici-\npants missing measured height and weight.\nPrimary predictor variable. The primary predictor variable of inter-\nest was self-report of food insecurity. Participants were asked \"In the\npast 12 months, was there a time when (you/your household were/\nwas) worried whether food would run out before you would get\nmoney to buy more?\" to which they responded yes or no. There was\na 99.9% response rate for this question. This question is the first item\nin the 18-item US Household Food Security Scale (30) and a positive\nresponse indicates individuals are either marginally food secure or\nfood insecure (Mark Nord, Economic Research Service, USDA, per-\nsonal communication). For the purposes of this analysis we will con-\ntinue to use the term \"food insecure\" to refer to those with a \npositive\nresponse.\nAdditional independent variables. Race/ethnicity was constructed\nfrom two questions from the third wave of the study regarding racial\nidentity and whether participants were of Hispanic/Latino origin, as\nthese questions were not asked at wave IV. Six racial/ethnic categories\nwere constructed based on participant responses: white, black/African\nAmerican, Hispanic, American Indian/Native American, Asian/Pacific\nIslander, and multiracial. Participant report of household income was\nconstructed as the midpoint of the income category chosen by the par-\nticipant. Income was imputed using the Gaussian normal regression\nimputation method for those 835 participants who either refused to\nanswer the income question or stated they did not know. The house-\nhold income variable was then transformed into a continuous measure\nthat was a ratio of household income relative to the poverty level in\n2008 (31) based on the number of household members reported by the\nparticipant.\nThe highest level of education achieved by the participant was collapsed\ninto four categories: less than high school (8th grade or less or some high\nschool), high school graduate, some college (some college or vocational/\ntechnical training beyond high school), and college graduate (completed\ncollege, some graduate school, or a masters or doctoral degree). Physical\nactivity was calculated as the sum of the number of physical activity epi-\nsodes reported in a typical week, with a range of 0\u00ad49 activities. Activity\nduration and intensity data were not available. Smokers were designated\nas those currently smoking tobacco on >10 days in the proceeding 30\ndays. Alcohol users were identified as those consuming alcohol on 1 or\nmore days a week in the past 30 days. Participants were coded as having\ndependent children at home if they reported any sons/daughters (biologi-\ncal, adopted, foster, or step-children) currently living in their household.\nFood stamp use/public assistance was considered present at wave 4 if the\nparticipant reported receiving any public assistance, welfare payments,\nor food stamps in the intervening years because the prior wave in which\nthey were surveyed. Food stamp use was considered present at wave 1 if\nthe mother or legal guardian reported that the household had received\nfood stamps in the prior month. Data regarding the duration of time\nparticipants received food stamps was not available.\nStatistical analysis\nAll analysis was performed using STATA SE 10.0 (Stata, College Station,\nTX). Survey sampling weights were applied to account for the unequal\nlikelihood of certain subpopulations being sampled. Bivariate analyses\nof the covariates of interest with the primary predictor variable were\ndone to test for significant relationships with 2-tests for categorical var-\niables and simple linear regression for continuous variables. A multiple\nlinear regression model was created to assess the association between\nfood insecurity and BMI controlling for potential confounders in the\noverall sample. Confounders were identified as those variables associ-\nated with both food insecurity and BMI in bivariate analysis or based on\nempiric evidence. Interaction terms were then created and added based\non either evidence from the literature or a priori hypotheses regard-\ning the differential effect of food insecurity for certain populations (i.e.,\nfemales, those raising children, those with an income <200% of the\nfederal poverty level). Results were then stratified by gender based on\nevidence from the literature for a differential association between food\ninsecurity and weight in women and men (10) and based on the signifi-\ncance of the interaction term for gender and food insecurity in the full\nmodel. Regression diagnostic procedures showed no evidence of multi-\ncollinearity, heteroscedasticity, or substantial influence from outliers.\nResults\nThe average age in this sample was 28.9 years. Females com-\nprised 48% of the total population and males 52%. The racial\nand ethnic makeup of the sample was similar to that of the\nUS population, with 66% of participants reporting they were\nwhite, 16% African American, 12% Hispanic, 4% Asian, and\n2% American Indian. Thirty percent were college graduates\narticles\n \nand the average household income was $60,000. Forty-five\npercent of participants had at least one child living in their\nhousehold. Thirty-two percent were smokers, 31% consumed\nalcohol on a weekly basis, and participants reported an average\nof 6 physical activities/week.\nThe demographic characteristics of those participants who\ndid and did not report food insecurity are listed in Table 1,\nstratified by gender. Significantly more female participants\nreported food insecurity than male participants (P < 0.001).\nFood insecurity was more prevalent in African Americans\nand American Indians compared to whites. Food insecurity\nwas also associated with lower income and lower educational\nattainment and a greater likelihood of having received public\nassistance or food stamps. Food insecurity was significantly\nmore likely to be reported by women with children in their\nhousehold and by individuals who smoked and who did not\nconsume regular alcoholic beverages. P values for most asso-\nAmong female participants, food insecurity was positively\nassociated with BMI (Table 2). Those who reported food inse-\ncurity had BMIs that were on average 2.39kg/m2 higher than\nthose who did not report food insecurity (Table 2, model 1).\nThis relationship was attenuated to 0.9kg/m2 but remained\nsignificant after controlling for other demographic and health\nbehaviorvariablesassociatedwithbothfoodinsecurityandBMI\nincluding age, race/ethnicity, education, household income,\nsmoking status, alcohol use, and physical activity (Table 2,\nmodel 2). However, among male participants we found no asso-\nciation between food insecurity and BMI (Table 3).\nFood insecurity was significantly associated with receipt\nof public assistance in adolescence and in young adulthood\n(P < 0.001, Table 1). However, neither recent receipt of pub-\nlic assistance/food stamps nor past receipt of food stamps in\nadolescence modified the relationship between food insecurity\nand BMI in either females or males (Tables 2 and 3, model\n3). Although the presence of dependent children in the house-\nhold was associated with a lower BMI in young adult women\n(Table 2, model 4), the interaction between food insecurity and\nthe presence of children was nonsignificant (Table 2, model 4).\nGiven reports in the literature regarding increased effects of\nfood insecurity on low-income individuals (32), we restricted\nour analysis to those reporting a household income <200% of\nthe federal poverty level and found no significant change in the\nassociations (data not shown). There was also no effect modi-\nfication of the relationship between food insecurity and BMI\nby educational attainment or race/ethnicity for either gender\n(data not shown).\nDiscussion\nThis is the first study to demonstrate that food insecurity is\nassociated with increased BMI in a nationally representative\nracially diverse sample of young adult women after controlling\nfor age, race/ethnicity, education, income, physical activity,\nsmoking, and alcohol use. Furthermore, this relationship per-\nsists after controlling for food stamp use and the presence of\nchildren in the household. Although other studies have found\nTable 1 Food security status of participants by demographic\ncharacteristics\nFemales\nFood\nsecure\nFood\ninsecure P value\nMales\nFood\nsecure\nFood\ninsecure P value\naAfrican Americans and American Indians differed significantly from whites\n(P < 0.001). bHigh-school graduates, participants with some college education,\nand college graduates all differed significantly from those without a high school\narticles\n \nthat food insecurity differentially affects individuals from vari-\nous racial and ethnic backgrounds (16,19) or only those below\nthe federal poverty level (32), we did not find an interaction\nbetween food insecurity and race/ethnicity nor income in this\npopulation. This study does not find an association between\nfood insecurity and BMI among young adult men.\nThis differential association in men and women is consist-\nent with findings from previous studies in other populations\n(6) but the reason for the differential association between\nfood insecurity and weight status in men and women remains\nunclear. Although others have hypothesized that food insecure\nwomen preferentially give available nutritious food to their\nchildren and are thus more apt to consume lower quality foods\nor alternate between overeating and hunger (7), we did not\nfind an interaction between food insecurity and the presence\nof children in the home in this large cohort of participants of\nchildbearing age. While women are more likely to participate\nin SNAP or other supplemental nutrition programs, we also\ndid not find evidence of an association between food stamp\nuse and BMI, nor a differential effect of food insecurity on BMI\nin those participants who did and did not report food stamp\nuse in adolescence or young adulthood. It is possible that\nfood insecure women make different nutritional choices than\nfood insecure men and other food secure adults. There may\nalso be genetic or hormonal differences that lead food inse-\ncure women to increase their adiposity stores in response to\nalternating periods of food scarcity and abundance (33). These\nremain areas for future research.\nThere are several important limitations to this study. First,\nthis study used a single-item question to assess food insecurity.\nThe USDA publishes both the full 18-item US Household Food\nSecurity Scale and a validated 6-item short form for the assess-\nment of food insecurity in adults (30). Our measure is the first\nitemonbothoftheseformsandisconsideredthemostinclusive\nquestion. While it is the least severe measure of food insecu-\nrity (34), recent work has demonstrated that this one question\nhas a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 85% for detecting\nfood insecurity as measured by the gold standard 18-item US\nHousehold Food Security Scale (35). Furthermore, using only\nthis question is likely to underreport food insecurity so results\nTable 2Associations between food insecurity and BMI in females\na (s.e.) a (s.e) a (s.e) a (s.e)\nRace/ethnicityc\nEducationd\nFood stamps young\nadulthoodh\nFS adolescence \u00d7 FI NS\nFS young adulthood \u00d7 FI NS\nChildren in household \u00d7 FI NS\nFI, food insecurity; FS, food stamps; HS, high school; NS, nonsignificant.\na indicates change per one unit BMI difference. bReference group is food secure. cReference group is white. dReference group is no high school diploma. eHousehold\nincome measured as percent relative to the poverty level. fReference group is nonsmokers. gReference group is <1 alcoholic drink per week. hReference group is no food\nstamp use reported. iReference group is no children in the household.\narticles\n \nremain conservative (Mark Nord, Economic Research Service,\nUSDA, personal communication). Second, questions regarding\nparticipation in the SNAP differed across waves, referencing\nimprecise lengths of time and sometimes including exposure\nto other public assistance programs, and data were collected\nbefore important revisions to the program in 2008. Finally, this\nis a cross-sectional study and therefore a causal relationship\nbetween food insecurity and BMI in young women cannot be\ndemonstrated by this analysis. We were unable to investigate\nthe longitudinal effects of food insecurity as this measure was\nonly added in Wave 4 of data collection. Analyzing longitudi-\nnal effects of food stamp exposure was also not possible due the\nmeasure changing as noted above. Future waves of Add Health\nshould retain the food insecurity question in order to assess\nthe effect of ongoing, new-onset, or resolved food insecurity\non weight gain as participants continue to age into adulthood.\nIn conclusion, food insecurity is related to BMI in this sam-\nple of diverse young adult women, but not in young adult men.\nProvidersshouldaskpatientsaboutfoodinsecuritywhenassess-\ning and treating overweight and obesity, especially in women. A\nsimple two-question screen is likely adequate with affirmative\nresponsestoeitherquestionconcerningforfoodinsecurity(35).\nProviders should refer patients with identified food insecurity\nto appropriate social services and should also provide informa-\ntion regarding how to choose healthy foods from these pro-\ngrams. Recent innovations in food assistance programs, such\nas the doubling of SNAP benefits if used at farmers markets or\nthe elimination of sugar sweetened beverages from some food\nbanks, may help to mitigate the adverse effects of food inse-\ncurity on weight. Future policy initiatives aimed at combating\noverweight and obesity should address the role of food insecu-\nrity with similar creative solutions that preferentially subsidize\nnutritious over unhealthy foods. Further studies are needed to\nassess the longitudinal relationship between food insecurity\nand weight status throughout the lifespan and to elucidate the\nmechanisms by which food insecurity impacts BMI.\n"
