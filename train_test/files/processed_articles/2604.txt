We used data from the Na-\ntional Electronic Injury Surveillance System\u00ad\nCooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance\n(NEISS\u00adCADES) project, a public health surveil-\nlance system based on the review of the clinical\nrecords from emergency departments.4\nthe 64 NEISS\u00adCADES hospitals reported a total\nof 188 visits to the emergency department on ac-\ncount of adverse events resulting from use of the\nfollowing stimulant medications: methylphenidate,\ndexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, am-\nphetamine with dextroamphetamine, and meth-\namphetamine (Table 1). Adverse drug events in-\ncluded unintentional ingestions or overdoses (61\npercent), adverse effects (33 percent), and aller-\ngic reactions (6 percent). Visits to the emergency\ndepartment resulting from intentional self-harm,\ndrug withdrawal, and drug abuse were excluded.\nEighty-two percent of adverse drug events occurred\nin children under 18 years of age, and 58 percent\noccurred in male patients of all ages. Twenty-six\npatients (14 percent) had effects of potential con-\ncern that may have been cardiovascular in origin\n(e.g., chest pain, stroke, syncope, tachycardia, hy-\npertension, or dyspnea). Cardiac-enzyme values,\ntelemetric recordings, or electrocardiograms were\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\nDownloaded from nejm.org on October 29, 2012. For personal use only.

In most patients (84 percent)\nthe adverse event was attributed to effects of\nstimulant medications alone; in 16 percent the\nadverse event was attributed to stimulant medi-\ncations in combination with other drugs. Sixty-\nseven patients (36 percent) were found to have in-\ngested medications that were not prescribed for\n81 stimulant-related adverse drug events were\nreported; from this we estimate that 3075 pa-\ntients presented to emergency departments na-\ntionally for adverse events from stimulant drugs\nprescribed for the treatment of ADHD.\nThe primary limitation of these surveillance\ndata is that they include only patients whose symp-\ntoms are documented by the treating clinician as\nbeing caused by use of the medication. Thus, the\nNEISS\u00adCADES project probably underestimates\nthe number of adverse drug events that are rare,\npreviously unreported, or difficult to diagnose in\nthe setting of an emergency department. Never-\ntheless, we found that visits to an emergency de-\npartment for adverse drug events due to stimu-\nlant medications are not uncommon. Clinicians\nshould recognize that unintentional overdoses of\nstimulant medications are an important cause\nof injury to patients, and they should investigate\ncardiovascular symptoms of potential concern\namong patients taking stimulant medications.\nClinicians should also report serious adverse\nevents to the FDA.\nAdam L.
