Although the extraction of such\nsummary statistics has been studied well in isolation, the relationship between these statistics\nremains unclear. In this study, we explored this issue using an individual differences approach.\nObservers viewed illustrations of strawberries and lollypops varying in size or orientation and\nperformed four tasks in a within-subject design, namely mean and variance discrimination tasks\nwith size and orientation domains. We found that the performances in the mean and variance\ndiscrimination tasks were not correlated with each other and demonstrated that extractions of\nthe mean and variance are mediated by different representation mechanisms. In addition,\nwe tested the relationship between performances in size and orientation domains for each\nsummary statistic (i.e. mean and variance) and examined whether each summary statistic has\ndistinct processes across perceptual domains. The results illustrated that statistical summary\nrepresentations of size and orientation may share a common mechanism for representing the\nmean and possibly for representing variance. Introspections for each observer performing the\ntasks were also examined and discussed.\n",

For example, grapes in a cluster appear\nsimilar, but upon closer examination, differences in colour, size and shape are apparent;\nsimilarly, children in the same age-group may resemble each other, but they exhibit large\ndifferences in size, character and mental states. Under these circumstances, people can\ncategorise objects, events and living states in our environment, estimate the average value\nor extent of variation and prepare for adaptive decision-making. Many studies have\ndescribed this visual ability as a statistical summary representation or ensemble\nrepresentation, and researchers in several fields have explored behavioural characteristics\nMareschal, Chubb, & Solomon, 2012) as well as the neurophysiological basis for such\nIt is important to note that studies of summary statistical representation can be roughly\ncategorised into two approaches: the psychophysical approach (e.g. Barlow & Tripathy,\nThese two approaches differ in the property of stimuli, the number of stimuli in a set, and the\nexperience of an observer of the mean extraction task.\nThe psychophysical approach has mainly used textures or random dots as stimuli; stimuli\nsets are composed of considerably large number of simple items including dots and Gabor\npatches; a few experienced observers participated in the experiment with a large number of\ntrials; the efficiency with which observers could extract summary statistics is tested using the\nideal observer analysis. Some psychophysical studies share stimuli with cognitive approach\nSolomon et al. used eight circular discs as stimuli set.\nHowever, the cognitive approach, with which the present study concerns, has used items\nmore complicated than the dots or Gabor patches, including circles with different sizes,\ndifferent facial expressions, sequence of different tones and others; the number of stimuli\nin a set ranged from 2 to 16, which is considerably smaller than those in the psychophysical\napproach; a large number of inexperienced observers participated in the experiment and the\nefficiency of extraction of summary statistics is tested using the precision of the extraction of\nmean values across the set size and presentation time. Noticeably, it has been suggested that\nthere are three pieces of behavioural evidence for the efficient extractions of summary\nstatistics. First, the precision of extraction of mean values remains constant regardless of\nsuggesting that the mean value is not calculated one at a time. Second, the precision of mean\nvalues is not affected by the presentation time (Chong & Treisman, 2003; Leib, Kosovicheva,\n& Whitney, 2016). Besides, Chong & Treisman (2003) demonstrated that observers could\nextract the mean value of the stimuli in a set at a presentation time as low as 50 ms. Third, the\nmean value is extracted even when information of an individual item is not recognised by the\nobserver, suggesting that summary statistics of stimuli in a set may be computed without\nPrevious researches in the cognitive approach illustrated that observers can extract\nstatistical values over a range of visual properties, including size (Alvarez, 2011; Ariely,\nand emotional expression (Haberman & Whitney, 2009, 2011). This ability is not limited\nto static and simultaneous events, as it is observed in sequentially presented events (Albrecht,\n2 i-Perception\ndynamic objects, such as expanding and contracting circles (Albrecht & Scholl, 2010).\nMoreover, the ability to represent statistical properties is not only limited to visual\nproperties but also observed for auditory properties such as extracting frequency\ninformation from sequences of sounds (Piazza, Sweeny, Wessel, Silver, & Whitney, 2013)\nand temporal variation of sounds (McDermatt, Schemisch, & Simoncelli, 2013). These\nrepresentations of statistical properties have been suggested to assist our judgement and\nbehaviour more efficiently than assessing each object or event individually (e.g. Alvarez,\nmay preserve cognitive resources, such as memory and selective attention load, and provide\nrich information about the environment rapidly and parsimoniously.\nAlthough there is an understanding of the possible existence of general summary\nit has not been tested whether different types of summary statistics share a common system or\nwhether dedicated systems exist for different summary statistics. Summary statistics include\nthe mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis and correlation (when more than one variable is\nobserved). Nevertheless, most studies investigated the mean, and some studies examine the\nvariance of items in a set; however, the relationship between these statistics has not been\ntested. This, therefore, poses the question of whether different types of summary statistics\nshare a common system or have distinct processes. For instance, is there a common\nmechanism supporting all summary statistic types, or are multiple mechanisms for a\nspecific summary statistic at work? When we calculate the variance of a data set formally,\nwe must first determine the mean value of the set. Does the statistical summary system work\nin the same manner or, unlike formal calculation, do distinct processes exist?\nTo clarify whether the summary statistical process is supported by a common or separate\nmechanism(s), we employed an individual difference approach. The approach has been\nemployed by many studies that explored the functional organisation of cognitive\n2008). Individual difference approaches are particularly useful for addressing questions of\ncognitive processes because they take advantage of the intrinsic variability present in a\nexamining how performance on different tasks is correlated, we can infer whether such\nprocesses are likely supported by a common underlying mechanism or independent\noperating mechanisms. For example, Haberman et al. (2015) used an individual difference\napproach to define the functional organisation of ensemble perception, testing whether the\ncognitive processes between high- and low-level ensemble representations are correlated.\nIn line with the approach, if the results from the mean and variance representation tasks\nare strongly correlated, then it is predicted that the mean and variance are supported by a\ncommon mechanism. However, the lack of a correlation indicates that different processes are\ninvolved in representing the mean and variance. Specifically, if different summary statistics\nshare a common system, then an individual who can precisely represent the mean value of a\nset of items should also be able to precisely represent the variance of the set. That is, there\nshould be a relationship regarding performance in mean and variance representation tasks. If\na positive relationship is observed, then it is predicted that a common summary statistics\nmechanisms exists for representing the mean and variance of a set of items. Alternative,\ndistinct mechanisms for the mean and variance suggest that multiple summary statistical\nprocessors specific to each type of statistical value exist. In other words, there are separate\n`cognitive mechanisms' for representing the mean and variance.\nYang et al. 3\nConcerning the introspections of observers, we asked them to describe how they\nperformed each task at the end of the experimental session. Although the explicit\nstatements may not necessarily predict the exact behavioural processes, it would be useful\nto know the strategy observers employed at the conscious level.\nConcerning the perceptual domains of items, we used size and orientation in this study, as\nboth domains have been well examined in mean and variance tasks (Chong & Treisman,\ndomains, most studies used discs and Gabor patches, respectively; however, we introduced\nmore familiar and realistic items such as illustrations of strawberries as the size stimuli and\nthose of lollypops as the orientation stimuli. The reason was to test whether an ability of the\nstatistical summary representation extends to a wide range of objects, as objects in the natural\nworld are multidimensional. It is important to know whether observers could extract\nsummary statistical values of illustrations with the same precision as observed for more\nprimitive objects. Thus, in addition to the primary objective, we explored whether\nrepresenting the mean and variance of sets of complicated items (i.e. illustrations of\nstrawberries and lollypops) could be represented in equivalent precision to simple items\nsuch as discs and Gabor patches. When we compared the results of complicated items\nwith the simple items, we used the results of the simple items in previous research because\nwe did not use the simple items in this study.\nAlong with exploring the relationship between the mean and variance in size and\norientation domains, we tested the relationship between performances in size and\norientation domains for each summary statistic (i.e. mean and variance) and examined\nwhether each summary statistic has distinct processes across perceptual domains.\nRegarding this issue, Haberman et al. (2015) revealed no correlation between the mean\nrepresentation of high- (i.e. emotional expression) and low-level items (i.e. orientation),\nthus arguing against a single domain-general ensemble mechanism. We tested this\npossibility using size and orientation domains. If performances in the size and orientation\ndomains in the mean or variance tasks are correlated, then the mean or variance may be\nrepresented via a common process.\nThus, this research had one primary and two secondary objectives, and it was conducted\nusing an individual differences approach. The primary objective was to test whether different\ntypes of summary statistics (i.e. mean and variance) share a common system or whether\ndedicated systems exist for each statistical value. In addition, we explored whether\nrepresenting the mean and variance of sets of complex items could be represented with\nequivalent precision to that for simple items such as discs and Gabor patches. Moreover, we\ntested whether a single domain-general mechanism supports multiple statistical\nrepresentations or whether domain-specific mechanisms are at work for the mean and\nvariance.\nExperiment\nObservers performed four tasks, namely mean and variance representation tasks combined\nwith size and orientation domain conditions. All tasks were performed with a within-subject\ndesign. Four measures were gathered. First, the correct rate for each comparison level was\ncalculated, and the discriminability threshold of each task in each perceptual domain was\nobtained. Second, the correlations between performances in the mean and variance\nrepresentation tasks in each domain were calculated. Third, the correlation between\n4 i-Perception\nperformances in the size and orientation mean tasks and that between performances in the\nsize and orientation variance tasks were calculated. In addition, introspections were obtained\nfrom each observer at the end of experimental sessions.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA total of 32 observers (19 females and 13 males), all with normal or corrected-to-normal\nvisual acuity, participated in all tasks. Fourteen observers were undergraduate students from\nMejiro University, the others were undergraduate and postgraduate students from\nOchanomizu University.\nAll observers provided informed consent prior to participation, and they were not\ninformed of the purpose of this study. This research was approved by the Mejiro\nUniversity's institutional review board.\nApparatus\nThe experiment was conducted in a normally lit room. Stimuli were displayed on an iMac\ndesktop computer monitor controlled by a Macintosh computer (Mac OS X). Stimuli were\ngenerated using Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner et al., 2007; Pelli,\n1997) for MATLAB (Version 8.4, Mathworks, MA). Observers viewed the screen with both\neyes, and they were seated approximately 60 cm from the screen.\nDesign\nWe considered two perceptual domains (size and orientation) and two types of summary\nstatistics (mean and variance). Concerning each domain, the participants were required to\nperform the mean representation task (i.e. mean task) and variance representation task (i.e.\nvariance task). Thus, there were four tasks in total. Each participant performed all four tasks,\nyielding within-subjects designs across two perceptual domains for two summary statistics.\nEach task comprised standard and comparison stimuli. We introduced four comparison\nlevels in each task. At the end of experimental sessions, each participant answered\nquestionnaires about how he or she performed the tasks.\nStimuli\nFigure 1 shows examples of item sets. Regarding the item for the size domain, we used an\nillustration of a strawberry created using PowerPoint. The item for the orientation domain\nwas an illustration of a lollypop, also created using PowerPoint. All items were presented\nagainst a light grey background.\nAll parameters used in both tasks were decided on the basis of pilot studies. To control the\nvariance of item sets, we used a fixed variance generation method in which the mean and SD\nof the samples randomly drawn from normal distribution were fixed to the expected value\nThe items of each domain were placed in a square cell with specific side lengths. The array\nwas divided into a 4 \u00c2 3 matrix. Each cell subtended a visual angle of 1.16 \u00c2 1.16. The entire\narray subtended 5.56 \u00c2 6.25. The items were arranged within the array. Each item was\ndisplayed at the centre of each cell.\nYang et al. 5\nSize domain. Figure 1(a) and (c) presents examples of items for the size domain. The size\nof an item was defined by a square of the side length of the item. Henceforth, side\n`length' denotes `size' in this domain for simplicity. The mean size of items in a set was\nrepresented as 1, and the size of each item in a set was expressed relative to the mean size.\nVariance was expressed as previously described (Tokita et al., 2016).\nIn the mean task, two stimuli were presented sequentially, namely standard and\ncomparison stimuli, in each trial (Figure 2(a)). The standard set consisted of 12 items (i.e.\nan illustration of strawberries) and the comparison stimulus consisted of a single item. In the\nstandard stimuli, a set of 12 items was presented in the array area. Lognormal Gaussian noise\nlnN (lnLength, ssize\n2 ), in which length and ssize\nrepresent the base length and SD of the\ndistribution, respectively, was added to the length of each item of a set independently. It\nhas been established that a lognormal distribution of circle diameters will produce a Gaussian\ndistribution of discriminable sizes after logarithmic transduction (Solomon et al., 2011).\nAlthough the items in this study were not discs, we introduced the same methods because\nboth tasks dealt with area.\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nBase size\nRelative size = Item size/Base size\nItem size\nFigure 1.

(c) and (d) Examples of\nstimulus sets.\n6 i-Perception\nThe size variance of the standard stimuli was fixed to a square of 0.14 in the relative size\nto the mean size of the standard set.\nIn each trial, all of the presented items were randomly scaled by a small multiplicative\nfactor to discourage the observers from basing their judgements on previously viewed items.\nFour multiplicative factors (1, 1.05, 1.1 and 1.15) were used, and the same factor scaled all\nitems in any one trial.\nRegarding the variance task, schematic views of stimulus presentation are shown in\nFigure 2(b). Stimulus presentation followed that described for the mean task except that\nboth arrays (i.e. standard and comparison sets) comprised 12 items. The array positions of\nthe standard and comparison sets were changed randomly; in half of the trials, the standard set\nappeared on the left side while the comparison set appeared on the right side, or vice versa.\nThe size variance of the standard set was fixed to a square of 0.14, as described for the\n0.26; thus, there were four comparison levels.\nIn each trial, the sizes of the item in a set were randomly scaled by a same multiplicative\nfactor as described for the mean task. The added scale factor could differ between the\nstandard and comparison sets; thus, the absolute mean size of items in a comparison set\ncould differ from that in the standard set. Specifically, the variance was controlled on the\nbasis of the relative sizes of items. This operation was necessary to ensure that observers\nwould perform the task by truly extracting the size variance of items and not by referring to\nthe size of outliers.\nOrientation domain. Stimulus presentation followed that for the size domain. The orientation\nof the sticks of lollypops varied (Figure 1(b)). Schematic diagrams of the trial sequence in\neach task are shown in Figure 3(a) and (b), respectively.\nIn the mean task, the base orientation of the items in the standard set was randomly\nchosen from orientations ranging from \u00c030 to \u00fe30 relative to vertical (\u00c0:\ncounterclockwise; \u00fe: clockwise). Gaussian noise N(0, sorien\n2 ) was added to the orientation\nof each item of a set independently. The orientation variance of the standard stimuli was fixed\nto a square of 13. There were four comparison levels: \u00c014, \u00c08, 8 and 14 relative to the\nmean orientation.\n(a) (b)\nStandard Stimuli\nBlank until response\nComparison Stimulus\nStandard stimuli\nBlank until response\nComparison Stimulus\nFigure 2. Schematic diagrams of trial sequences in the mean (a) and variance tasks (b) for the size domain.\nYang et al. 7\nIn the variance task, stimulus presentation followed that in the mean task except that both\narrays (i.e. standard and comparison sets) comprised item sets. The original orientation of the\nitems in the standard and comparison sets was randomly and independently chosen from\norientations ranging from \u00c030 to 30 relative to vertical. Thus, the original orientation could\ndiffer between the standard and comparison sets. Gaussian noise N(0, sorien\n2 ) was added to\nthe orientation of each item of a set independently. The variance of the standard stimuli was a\nthus, there were four comparison levels. Note that although the proper way of generating the\norientation variance may be with von Miles circular statistics, we used a conventional way of\nvariance computation, as the same way in the orientation variance discrimination task in\nprevious studies (Morgan, Chubb, & Solomon, 2008; Solomon et al., 2011). To test the\nvalidity of using the normal distribution in calculating the variance, we compared the\nprobability density function of von Mises circular statistics to that of normal distribution\nwith the variance values used in the present study and demonstrated that the von Mises\ndistribution with this variance value approximate to the normal distribution.\nProcedure\nA schematic view of stimulus presentation is shown in Figures 2 and 3. Observers completed\none 50-min session that consisted of a practice block of eight trials, followed by four\nexperimental blocks of 80 trials each (4 comparison levels \u00c2 20 repetitions), thus resulting\nin a total of 320 trials. The comparison levels and the order of trials were randomly mixed.\nThe order of blocks was counterbalanced across observers using a balanced Latin square,\nwhich controls for order effects. Observers were required to obtain correct rate of 100% in\nthe practice trials to ensure they fully understood the task instructions. A two-alternative\nforced choice procedure was used in all tasks.\nEach trial started with the display of a fixation cross for 500 ms followed by a blank\nscreen for 400 ms. The items in a set were first presented for 240 ms. The comparison item\nwas presented for 240 ms after a blank screen for 600 ms, and then a blank screen was\nshown until a response was recorded. The next trial automatically began 500 ms after the\nresponse. In the mean task for the size domain, observers were asked to decide whether\n(a) (b)\n(a) (b)\nStandard Stimuli\nBlank until response\nComparison Stimulus\nStandard Stimuli\nBlank until response\nComparison Stimulus\nFigure 3.

In the\nmean task for the orientation domain, observers were asked to decide whether the\norientation of the comparison item (i.e. sticks of lollypops) was clockwise or\ncounterclockwise to the mean orientation of the standard set. When they thought that\nthe comparison item was clockwise to the mean orientation, they pressed the right arrow\nkey; otherwise, they pressed the left arrow key.\nIn the variance task, observers were asked to decide which item set in a sequence had a\nlarger variance in size or orientation. When they thought that the variance on the right array\nwas larger than that on the left array, they pressed the `z' key; or otherwise, they pressed\nthe `c' key.\nNo feedback about the correctness of the response was provided for any of the trials. The\ncorrect rate on each block was presented at the end of the block to motivate each observer to\nfully engage in the experiment.\nAnalysis\nWe calculated the mean correct rates. We used these measures and performed the following\nfour analyses. First, we examined how precisely the observers represented the mean and\nvariance. In the size condition, the Weber fraction (Wf) and point of subjective equality\n(PSE) were measured. In the orientation condition, just noticeable difference (JND) and\nPSE were measured using the method of constant stimuli. The sizes or orientations for the\ncomparison item were plotted on the x-axis, and the proportion of larger or clockwise\nresponses for each comparison stimulus was plotted on the y-axis. Fits of psychometric\nfunction were done for means across observers. The plotted data points constructed the\npsychometric function approximated using a cumulative Gaussian function. Wf and JND\nwere defined as the smallest stimulus number change for which a correct response rate of 75%\nwas achieved. The PSEs were obtained as the values of the locations on the psychometric\nfunction at which the standard and comparative choice probabilities were equal to 50%.\nSecond, the correlations between the total correct rates in the mean and variance tasks for\neach domain were tested. Third, the correlations between the total correct rates in the size\nand orientation domains for each summary statistic were tested.\nResults\nData for two observers were excluded as follows. One observer did not understand the\ninstructions, as his or her correct rate under the difficult condition was higher than those\nunder easier conditions, which were less than 50%, suggesting that the observer had\nresponded oppositely. The other observer appeared to have difficulty in performing the\nmean orientation task, as she or he needed more than 3 s to respond in 8 of 20 trials.\nThus, data were collected for 30 observers.\nPerformance for the Mean and the Variance Tasks\nSize domain. Figure 4(a) shows the correct rate for each comparison level and the mean rate for\nthe mean task. Figure 4(c) shows the psychometric function created by the mean of choice\nfrequency of `larger' responses at the comparison level. The Wf of the mean task was estimated\nto be 0.08 (an 8% side length difference), whereas the PSE was estimated to be 1.09. The Wf\nYang et al. 9\nvalue was almost equivalent to the precision of averaging tasks in several studies that used\nsimple circular stimuli and found a diameter distance of 6% to 8% for a 75% correct rate\ncould extract a mean value from a set of complicated objects such as strawberries with the same\naccuracy observed for simpler circular items. The value of PSE was larger than 1, suggesting that\nthe average size of items in a set was overestimated compared with the comparison size. The\nresult was consistent with that of Tokita et al. (2016), who found that a nai\u00a8ve observer tended to\noverestimate the mean size of a set of circular items.\nFigure 4(b) shows the correct rate for each comparison level and the mean rate for the\nvariance task. Figure 4(d) shows the psychometric functions created by the mean `larger'\nresponse at each comparison level. The Wf was estimated to be 0.39 (in SD). The Wf value\nwas almost equivalent to the precision of the variance discrimination task in previous studies\nthat used discs as items in a set (Tokita et al., 2016; Ueda, Tokita, & Ishiguchi, 2014). In this\nstudy, the Wf was ranged from 0.35 to 0.42 for a 75% correct rate. Thus, it is indicated that\nobservers could discriminate the variance between sets of items such as strawberries, with the\nsame accuracy observed for simpler circular items.\nOrientation domain. Figure 5(a) shows the mean correct rates of observers along each\ncomparison level and the mean rate.

The JND of the mean task was estimated\nto be 10.9, whereas the PSE was estimated to be \u00c03.20. The JND was almost equivalent to\nthe precision of averaging tasks in a previous study that used Gabor patches (Yang, Tokita,\n& Ishiguchi, 2016). In their study, the JND was ranged from 8.6 to 11.5. Thus, it is indicated\nthat observers could extract the mean orientation of a set of items such as lollypops with the\nsame precision observed for Gabor patches. The PSE was smaller than 0, suggesting that the\naverage orientation of a set of objects was slightly biased toward the clockwise direction.\nAs bias was not systematically tested in any previous research, further investigation is\nnecessary to obtain the general picture.\nFigure 5(b) shows the correct rate at each comparison level and the mean response rate for\nthe variance task. Figure 5(d) shows the psychometric functions created by the average correct\nrate at each comparison level. The JND of the variance task was estimated to be 7.02. The JND\nwas also similar to the precision of the variance discrimination tasks in previous studies that\nused simple Gabor patches (Tokita & Ishiguchi, 2015; Ueda et al., 2014). Thus, it is indicated\nthat observers could discriminate the variance between sets of objects such as lollypops with\nsimilar precision as observed for simpler stimuli such as Gabor patches.\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nCorrect Rate\nRelative orientation of comparison item\nMean task\nCorrect Rate\nSD of comparison set\nVariance task\nRelative orientation of comparison item\nChoice frequency of \"clockwise\" response\nSD of comparison item\nChoice frequency of \"higher\" response\nFigure 5.

As shown in the figure, correlations\nbetween the mean and variance tasks were extremely weak in the size (r \u00bc .14, p \u00bc .37, 95%\nCI \u00bc \u00c00.18\u00ad0.51). Thus, precision in extracting the mean size of items in a set does not\npredict an observer's ability to represent size variance. This was also the case in the\norientation domain. The results imply that representations of mean and variance may\ninvolve independent, distinct processes across perceptual domains.\nCorrelation Between the Size and Orientation Domains for Each Summary Statistic\nFigure 6(c) and (d) shows the correlations between performances for the mean task in the size\nand orientation domains and those for the variance task in the size and orientation domains,\nrespectively.

The\nresults suggest that representation of the mean may be a general process, at least for the size\nand orientation domains.\nAs shown in Figure 6(d), although nonsignificant, there was also a moderate correlation\nbetween the size and orientation conditions in the variance task (r\u00bc .31, p \u00bc .09, 95%\nCI\u00bc \u00c00.06\u00ad0.60). Thus, it is uncertain whether precision in extracting the orientation\nvariance of items in a set may predict an observer's ability to precisely extract the size variance.\nClassification of Comments for Each Task\nAll observers were asked to complete a form consisting of four questions: (a) How did you\nestimate the mean size of a strawberry? (b) How did you discriminate the variance of\nstrawberry sizes? (c) How did you estimate the mean orientation of lollypops? (d) How did\nyou discriminate the orientation variance? The classifications of answers in each task are\nshown in Figure 7. We classified all answers using the keyword extraction method, which has\nbeen used to classify free descriptive data obtained from questionnaires (Beliga, 2014;\nKimura, 1995). Briefly, we created a database of answers for each questionnaire and\nsummarised the answers, and we extracted keywords based on usage frequency and\nrelevance to the tasks. Then, we organised the keywords to classify each answer to the\ngroup with similar keyword usage. Overall, the observers appeared to use various\nstrategies to perform each task. For both tasks in the size domain, observers commented\nthat they focused on the maximum and minimum sizes of strawberries and used the\ninformation to perform the tasks. Some observers noted that they focused on the larger\nitems and found it difficult to ignore them. Conversely, in the mean orientation task, most\nobservers commented that they make decision `at a glance' or `on intuition', suggesting that\nthey did not have particular strategy for extracting the mean. In the orientation variance task,\nobservers stated that they focused items with extreme orientations, which was similar to the\nstrategy used for the variance task in the size domain.\nDiscussion\nWe explored whether different types of summary statistics shared a common representation\nsystem or whether a dedicated system was employed for each statistic. In this experiment, we\nfocused on the mean and variance of items in a set as summary statistics in comparison and\nintroduced size and orientation as the perceptual domains of the items. To address the issue,\nwe employed an individual-differences approach that enabled us to infer whether a certain\nprocess is supported by a common underlying mechanism or involved distinct mechanisms\n(e.g. Haberman et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2012). We predicted that if different summary\nstatistics share a common system, then an individual who can precisely represent the mean\nvalues of the set should also be able to precisely represent the variance of the set. Namely,\nthere would be considerable correlation between performances in the mean and variance\ntasks. Our results revealed no significant correlation between performances in the mean\nand variance tasks for both domains, implying that the derivation of the mean and\nvariance are mediated by the distinct representation mechanisms for human observers.\nThus, we could conclude that estimation of the mean and variance may involve distinct\nunderlying mechanisms, at least for size and orientation domains. This does not deny the\npossibility of common underlying mechanisms for those summary statistics. It may be that\nthe representation mechanism for the summary statistics comprises multiple cognitive\nprocesses, and there could be some common underlying processes across perceptual domains.\nIn addition to the primary purpose, we tested whether representing the mean and variance\nof complex items could be performed with equivalent precision as observed for simple items\nsuch as discs and Gabor patches. We introduced familiar and realistic items, namely\nillustrations of strawberries for the size domain and those of lollypops for the orientation\ndomain. Our results demonstrated that observers could discriminate the mean and variance\nbetween sets of illustrations with precision equivalent to that for simple items. Thus, the\nfindings provide evidence that the statistical summary representation could extend to more\nrealistic and natural objects than discs and Gabor patches. Objects in the natural world are\nmultidimensional, and they differ in colour, size, shape and other factors.

Classification of the questions in each task: answers for the mean (a, b) and variance tasks (c, d)\nfor the size and orientation domains.\nthat the statistical summary representation ability evolved and developed in such an\nenvironment, it is to be expected that the statistical summary representation is effective\nwith more natural, complex items than discs and Gabor patches. Our findings are\nnoteworthy because few studies have attempted to prove this point. It should be noted\nthat the sizes of the components of the strawberry illustrations are correlated. When the\noverall size of the strawberry was increased, the red, green and black component areas were\nincreased by the same ratio. This may help observers to derive the mean value.\nMoreover, we tested the relationship between performances in the mean and variance tasks in\nthe size and orientation domains. We predicted that if different perceptual domains share a\ncommon mean representation system, then an individual who could precisely represent the mean\nsize of an item set should also be able to precisely represent the mean orientation of the set. In\nother words, there would be considerable correlation between performances in the mean size\nand orientation tasks. Our result revealed a significant correlation between the individual\nperformances in the size and orientation mean tasks, suggesting that a common\nrepresentation system exists across perceptual domains. In relation to this issue, Haberman\net al. (2015) found no correlation between low- and high-level perceptual domains (e.g.\norientation and facial expression), whereas they found correlation within the respective low-\n(e.g. orientation and colour) and high-level perceptual domains (e.g. person identity and facial\nexpression). Thus, they claimed that the statistical summary representation is not derived by a\nsingle, domain-general process. The relationship between perceptual domains depends on how\nproximal they are in the space. In line with their argument, our results suggest that orientation\nand size domains are close to each other in perceptual space and that the statistical summary\nmechanism for each domain are close or similar enough to result in similar output results, as\norientation and size are considered low- and middle-level perceptual domains, respectively. We\nalso tested whether estimation of the variance of items in a set shares a general representation\nmechanism across perceptual variables. We found a mild correlation between performances in\nthe size and the orientation variance tasks, although nonsignificant. There may be a common\nprocess for variance representation across perceptual domains. As only a few studies have tested\nvariance, further investigations are necessary to draw definitive conclusions on this matter.\nAdditionally, we obtained the observers' introspections while they performed each task.\nThe results demonstrated that the observers used various strategies to extract the mean and\nvariance, even with a short observation time of 240 ms, and that there were large individual\ndifferences in strategies across tasks and perceptual domains. The findings imply that there\nmight be some conscious and focused attention process in the statistical summary\nrepresentation, although automatic and distributed attention processes in the statistical\nsummary representations were claimed in previous studies (Chong & Treisman, 2003,\n2005). It should be noted that the introspections of observers might not necessarily reveal\nthe representation processes. Nevertheless, they revealed how observers performed each task,\nat least at the level of consciousness.\nIt should be noted that we used the undergraduates and postgraduate students as the\nobservers, it may be that the variance in the sample may be too low to find correlations.\nIt is necessary to use a larger variety of observers in future studies.\nFurther investigations are necessary to support the findings of this study more explicitly.\nThe following three investigations should be considered. First, it will be effective to test\nwhether the practice effect in the mean task transfers to performance in the variance task.\nIf the representation of variance is independent of the representation of the mean, the\npractice effect in the mean task would not transfer to the performance of the variance\ntask. Simultaneously, if the representation variance involves a common process across\nfeature domains, the practice effect in one task would be transferred to the second task.\nSecond, a post-cue method in which observers are informed of the demands of the task after\nviewing stimuli in each trial should be tested. In the post-cue procedure, the observers do not\nprepare a particular strategy for the task (i.e. mean or variance task) prior to stimulus\npresentation. If the mean and variance share a common representation mechanism, then\nthe performance in the post-cue procedure may not differ from that in the pre-cue\nprocedure. Third, to generalise the present results, it is necessary to use different types of\nvisual properties such as colour, position and speed. As we mentioned in the Introduction\nsection, the present study concerns types of stimuli used in the cognitive approach. It is,\nhowever, necessary to use stimuli set such as larger number of random dots, of moving dots\nand textures, which are used in the psychophysical approach.\nIn summary, our results revealed three important characteristics in representing summary\nstatistics. First, representations of the mean and variance may involve distinct processes, at\nleast for size and orientation domains. Second, size and orientation may share a common\nmechanism for representing the mean and possibly for representing variance. Third, despite\nindividual differences, human observers can extract the mean and variance of complex items\nfeaturing multiple dimensions. To provide a clear description of the statistical summary\nrepresentation(s), further work is required to determine the relationship between different\nsummary statistics across various perceptual domains.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: This work was partly supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of\nReferences\nAlbrecht, A.
