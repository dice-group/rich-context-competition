Continuous peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2\n), heart rate, mean arterial pressure\n(MAP), Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) and numeric rating scale pain scores were recorded before,\nduring and after the procedure. Patients completed a post-procedure satisfaction questionnaire.\nResults: Patients in the midazolam group (n \u00bc 30) experienced a significant decrease in MAP\nduring sedation compared with pre-sedation values. Patients in the dexmedetomidine group\n(n \u00bc 30) had significantly higher SpO2\nand RSS scores during sedation than those in the midazolam\ngroup. Overall satisfaction was higher in the dexmedetomidine group than the midazolam group.\nThere were no clinically significant complications in either group.\nConclusion: Dexmedetomidine has a good safety profile and is an effective sedative for use in\nupper gastrointestinal endoscopy.\n",

Conscious sedation enables\npatients to maintain their response to\nverbal and tactile stimuli without losing\ncardiovascular and ventilatory function.1\nThis form of sedation combines an opioid\nanalgesic and a benzodiazepine, and is\ncommonly used in upper gastrointestinal\nendoscopy.2,3 The a-adrenoceptor agonist\ndexmedetomidine dose-dependently reduces\narterial blood pressure and heart rate, and\ndecreases haemodynamic and plasma cat-\necholamine responses. It is used as a seda-\ntive, anaesthetic adjuvant, premedicant and\nanxiolytic, and has minimal adverse effects\non respiratory function.4\u00ad7 The aim of this\nstudy was to investigate the use of dexme-\ndetomidine compared with midazolam in\nconscious sedation for upper gastrointes-\ntinal endoscopy, and examine its effects on\nperioperative haemodynamics, sedation,\npain and patient satisfaction.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis retropective randomized study\nrecruited patients with ASA physical status\nI\u00adII8 who were scheduled to undergo elect-\nive upper gastrointestinal endoscopy\nat Union Hospital, Fujian Medical\nUniversity, Fuzhou, China. Exclusion cri-\nteria were: inability or unwillingness to\nparticipate or to give consent; ASA status\n!III; coexisting cardiac anomalies; aged\n<20 years or >60 years; allergy to study\ndrugs (midazolam, dexmedetomidine or opi-\noids); history of chronic alcoholism, sedative\nor narcotic analgesic drug abuse; advanced\nor decompensated liver or renal disease;\nuncooperative; and any serious illness.\nThe study was approved by the ethics\ncommittee of Fujian Medical University,\nChina and adhered to the tenets of the\nDeclaration of Helsinki. All subjects pro-\nvided written informed consent prior to\nenrolment.\nAnaesthesia\nUsing a computer generated randomization\nschedule, patients were assigned to undergo\nconscious sedation with either dexmedeto-\nmidine or midazolam and were taken into\nthe operating room without any premedica-\ntion. Patients in the dexmedetomidine group\nreceived 0.3 mg/kg dexmedetomidine bolus\ninjection and 1 mg/kg fentanyl citrate intra-\nvenous infusion 10 min before endoscopy,\nfollowed by 0.2\u00ad0.3 mg/kg per h dexmedeto-\nmidine continuous infusion until an appro-\npriate level of sedation was achieved.1\nPatients in the midazolam group received\n0.05 mg/kg midazolam bolus injection\nand 1 mg/kg fentanyl citrate intravenous\ninfusion 10 min before endoscopy, followed\nby 0.01 mg/kg midazolam at intervals of\napproximately 2\u00ad5 min until a satisfactory\nlevel of sedation was achieved.1 Additional\n0.01 mg/kg midazolam boluses were avail-\nable for rescue sedation, if required. In both\ngroups, additional and 1 mg/kg fentanyl\nboluses were available for rescue analgesia.\nStandard monitoring (electrocardiogram,\npulse oximetry and noninvasive blood pres-\nsure) was performed and antecubital venous\naccess for intravenous fluids was achieved\nwith a 20G intravenous cannula. All patients\nreceived prophylactic oxygen (1\u00ad2 l/min) via\na nasal cannula during the procedure.\nA physician was present throughout the\nprocedure and provided direct supervision\nof the endoscopist. All endoscopies were\nperformed using standard techniques1,2 and\nwere carried out by the same endoscopist.\nData collection\nAll patients were observed in the recovery\nroom until Aldrete post-anaesthesia\nrecovery score reached !9 (full recovery\nfrom sedation).9 The time to full sedation\nand full recovery were recorded for all\npatients. Complications occurring during\nand after endoscopy, including apnoea,\n< 85%, decreased blood pressure\n(<80% of basal value), HR <50 beats/min,\ncough or abnormal body movements were\nnoted. Patients' overall satisfaction was\nassessed via questionnaire immediately fol-\nlowing discharge from the procedure\nContinuous peripheral oxygen saturation\n), heart rate (HR) with telemetry and\nmean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded\nat the following time-points: 1, before sed-\nation; 2, full sedation, before endoscopy; 3,\n5 min after beginning of endoscopy; and 4,\nafter completion of endoscopy and discon-\ntinuance of drugs. Ramsay Sedation Scale\n(RSS)11 and numeric rating scale for pain\n(NRS)12 scores were recorded at time-points\n2 (full sedation, before endoscopy) and 3\n(5 min after beginning of endoscopy).\nStatistical analyses\nContinuous data were presented as\nmean \u00c6 SD and range. Between-group com-\nparisons were made using Student's t-test for\nnormally distributed data or Mann\u00ad\nWhitney U test for non-normally distributed\ndata. Within-group comparisons were made\nusing paired t-test for independent variables\nor Wilcoxon test for dependent variables.\nP-values <0.05 were defined as statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nassigned to receive either midazolam or\ndexmedetomidine (n \u00bc 30/group). Demo-\ngraphic and clinical data on the patients\nare shown in Table 1. There were no statis-\ntically significant between-group differences\nin sex distribution, age, weight or time to full\nsedation or recovery.\nData on clinical parameters at each time-\npoint are shown in Table 2. In the mid-\nazolam group, mean arterial pressure was\nsignificantly lower at time-points 2 and 3\ncompared with time-point 1 (P < 0.05 for\nboth comparisons). SpO2\nand RSS scores\nwere significantly higher in the dexmedeto-\nmidine group than the midazolam group at\ncomparisons).\nAccording to data obtained from ques-\ntionnaires, patients in the dexmedetomidine\ngroup rated their overall satisfaction with\nthe procedure higher than those in the\nTable 1.

A total of six patients (dexmede-\ntomidine group n \u00bc 1; midazolam group\nn \u00bc 5) thought that they required either\nmore or less sedation than they received.\nNo patient reported experiencing any severe\npain during the procedure. The amnesic\neffect was equivalent in both groups, with\nno patient reporting any recollection of\nintra-procedure events.\nA total of eight patients required add-\nitional sedation and analgesia (dexmedeto-\nmidine group n \u00bc 3; midazolam group\nn \u00bc 5). No patient experienced rebound\nhypertension, tachycardia or acute reversal\nof sedative and analgesic effects in either\ngroup. No patient required prolonged post-\nprocedure monitoring, unplanned admis-\nsion or subsequent medical attention.\nDiscussion\nUpper gastrointestinal endoscopy is a rou-\ntine procedure, but patients may experience\ndiscomfort and pain. Topical anaesthesia\nalone has been advocated for endoscopy in\norder to avoid the cost and risk of conscious\nsedation,13,14 but this approach is likely to\nbe less acceptable to patients and reduce\ntheir willingness to undergo repeat proced-\nures. Sedation is routinely used in upper\ngastrointestinal endoscopy,15\u00ad17 with care\ntaken to balance patient comfort and post-\nprocedure side effects. The most suitable\nagents for conscious sedation during upper\ngastrointestinal endoscopic procedures are\nstill being investigated. In common with\npared the sedatives dexmedetomidine and\nmidazolam. Our data showed that patients\nin the dexmedetomidine group experienced\nbetter peripheral oxygen saturation and RSS\nscores than those in the midazolam group.\nDexmedetomidine has been approved for\nsedation in critically ill patients in the\nintensive care unit, and during surgery,\nTable 2.

The\ninitial loading dose may cause adverse car-\ndiovascular reactions such as hypertension,\nhypotension, bradycardia or sinus arrest,\nespecially in patients taking medication\ncapable of producing negative chronotropic\neffects (e.g. b-adrenergic antagonists and\ndigoxin) or those with hypovolaemia.25\u00ad27\nAn infusion of 0.5 mg/kg per h has been\nshown to be highly effective in promoting\nsedation and analgesia for mechanical ven-\ntilation even without prior bolus.28,29 In the\npresent study, the bolus dose was reduced to\n0.3 mg/kg to avoid rapid haemodynamic\nchanges,26,27 and a continuous infusion of\n0.2\u00ad0.3 mg/kg per h was used. This relatively\nlow total dose may explain the absence of\nrespiratory and cardiovascular complica-\ntions in our study, and the low initial\nloading dose followed by continuous infu-\nsion of dexmedetomidine provided\nadequate, well controlled sedation. High\ndoses of sedative drugs are likely to cause\ncomplications, especially in high-risk\nAirway protection and the maintenance\nof cardiovascular stability are important\nresponsibilities of the endoscopist during\nupper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Oxygen\ndesaturation is a common complication\nduring sedation, possibly due to the overuse\nof sedative agents and subsequent lack of\nventilation.30 Patients in the dexmedetomi-\ndine group had higher SpO2\nthan those in\nthe midazolam group in the present study,\nindicating that dexmedetomidine had no\nsignificant respiratory depressive effects.\nSince dexmedetomidine binds to a2 recep-\ntors rather than gamma-aminobutyric acid\n(GABA) receptors, patients can be easily\naroused from sedation and experience less\nsignificant respiratory depression than those\nsedated using midazolam.31,32 Endotracheal\nintubation should be considered in patients\nwith poor respiratory status (SpO2\nor those who are deeply unconscious (RSS\nscore !6).\nHypotension resulting from cardiac\ninstability is a concern during upper gastro-\nintestinal endoscopy. The invasive nature of\nthe procedure can lead to patient anxiety,\nhyperventilation and arrhythmia. Dexmede-\ntomidine has been associated with brady-\ncardia, which can be reversed with drug\ntreatment and will resolve spontaneously\nafter weaning.28,29 No patient experienced\nclinically significant bradycardia in the pre-\nsent study, and there were no cases of\nrebound hypertension or tachycardia fol-\nlowing discontinuation of either drug.\nThis study has several limitations. First,\nthe retrospective nature of the study intro-\nduces potential bias in data collection and\nincomplete data for some patients.\nSecondly, the small cohort precluded reach-\ning statistical significance for all study end-\npoints, and much larger numbers of patients\nmust therefore be evaluated to confirm the\nsafety profile of dexmedetomidine. Thirdly,\nthe study included only low-risk patients\n(ASA I or II), since high-risk patients\n(ASA III\u00adIV) are generally sedated by\nanaesthetists in our institution. Finally,\nthis was a single-centre study and others\nmay have different findings.\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that\ndexmedetomidine has a good safety profile\nand is an effective sedative for use in upper\ngastrointestinal endoscopy.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of\ninterests.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
